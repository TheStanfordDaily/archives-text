# Honor Code
## Strength of the System Grows with University 
### Second in a Series) By BOB REZAK 
The strength of the honor
system at Stanford, since the
inception of the Honor Code in
1921, has grown as the Univer
sity has grown.
The success of the Honor Code
over the years has reached a point
where students think about it au
tomatically, but sometimes with
little understanding of what it
really means.
The responsibility for honorable
conduct in academic work has
rested squarely with the students
under the code. Students pledge
not only to observe the Honor
Code themselves, but to see that
others do likewise. This aspect of
the Honor Code is known as the
third person responsibility and is
considered to be the heart of the
code.
In general, students and fac
ulty members over the years
agreed that the code was work
ing well and that it could not he
strengthened by any regulation
arising out of a reinterprctation
of the code.
Within recent years, however,
there were some who felt there
was great strain on the code at the
point where second and third per
son responsibility ends — when,
for example, an examination is
taken out of the examination
room.
The question of whether stu
dents should be allowed to take
examinations out of the classroom
—a problem currently before the
student body—never was officially
stipulated in the Honor Code it
self.
In the fall of 1945, however,
the Honor Code Committee is
sued an orientation pamphlet to
students which stated that under
the honor system students arc
given such "traditional privi
leges" as taking their examina
tions outside the classrooms,
taking a break whenever they
please, going out of the building,
or talking to their friends, if
they so desire.
The same information was con
tained in a pamphlet, "You, the
Fundamental Standard, and the
Honor Code," which was distrib
uted on campus last quarter.
Some students have interpreted
this "privilege" as a right.
Last summer, a survey made by
Charles Goff, chairman of the
Fundamental Standard Committee,
reported that "the customary right
of students to take their exams
from the appointed room has been
questioned on four notable occa
sions."
One of the occasions occurred
in 1041 when a professor in
formed President Wilbur lie did
not believe group restraint on
cheating in examinations could
be effective if students left the
exam room. President Wilbur
took the matter before the AS
SU Executive Committee and
that body decided that no revi
sion of the Honor Code should
he made at that time.
According to Golf's survey, this
has been interpreted as indicating
the approval of Excom of the
existing practice of taking exams
out of class.
Another case resulted on Nov.
10, 1947, when the Honor Code
Committee recommended to Ex
com that "a student, wishing to
take an examination outside the
assigned room, first ' secure the
consent of the instructor."
The recommendation was re
jected.
Then on Nov. 12, 1947, the
Honor Code Committee pro
posed to Excom that "students
should he required to take their
examinations in the assigned
room if adequate seating facili-

Slies arc provided, and that ex
ceptions be left to the direction
"? of the professor."
This proposal was defeated also.
Finally, on Oct. 5, 1949, the
problem was again brought up for
solution and it was decided that
the Honor Code Committee would
contact department heads express
ing the students' feeling that they
should have the "privilege" of
taking exams out of the classroom.
The last case, though never ac
tually settled, more closely 'paral
lels the situation confronting the
student body today than do the
other three cases.
One solution to the problem
offered in 1949 was contained in
an Excom resolution which stip
ulated that "providing adequate
seating is provided in the exam
ination room, exams will be ta
ken out of the room only with
the consent of the instructor."
The chairman of the Honor Code
Committee that year, Donn Wells,
pointed out that some professors
have made a practice of refusing
to allow exams to be taken out,
while others freely permitted it.
Wells considered the • Excom
resolution, which stated that the
decision should rest with the pro
fessor, to be a "movement by the
students to protect their own sys
tem from the few who might use
this means of abusing the privi
leges of the Honor Code."
He said he did not see it as an
administrative curb.

Wells added that the interpre
interpretation of the code and
he offered would in no way in
hibit students from leaving exam
rooms or taking them out for
apparently legitimate reasons.
He said it would serve only as a
"check on those very few who
would take unfair advantage of
the privilege."
Sonic students expressed the
opinion that such a move, as out
lined by Wells, would weaken the
code and that the honor system
should carry unlimited privilege.
According to a report in The
Daily, others said the code is "only
as good as it is practical and that
because of the few who will not
respect the privileges, checks are
needed just as civil law is set up
to protect the many from the
few."
Both sides of student opinion
—that which favored the new
interpretation of tch code and
that which did not—were voiced
at nn open discussion of the plan
a few days after it was proposed.
Only 23 students took part" in the
discussion and only five expressed
the belief that the plan would
strengthen the code.
Somewhat disheartened, Wells
declared that "no interpretation of
the Honor Code is practicable
without the wholehearted support
of the students."

has been interpreted as indicating
the approval of Excom of the
existing practice of taking exams
out of class.
Another case resulted on Nov.
10, 1947, when the Honor Code
Committee recommended to Ex
com that "a student, wishing to
take an examination outside the
assigned room, first ' secure the
consent of the instructor."
The recommendation was re
jected.
Then on Nov. 12, 1947, the
Honor Code Committee pro
posed to Excom that "students
should he required to take their
examinations in the assigned
room if adequate seating facili-

Slies arc provided, and that ex
ceptions be left to the direction
"? of the professor."
This proposal was defeated also.
Finally, on Oct. 5, 1949, the
problem was again brought up for
solution and it was decided that
the Honor Code Committee would
contact department heads express
ing the students' feeling that they
should have the "privilege" of
taking exams out of the classroom.
The last case, though never ac
tually settled, more closely 'paral
lels the situation confronting the
student body today than do the
other three cases.
One solution to the problem
offered in 1949 was contained in
an Excom resolution which stip
ulated that "providing adequate
seating is provided in the exam
ination room, exams will be ta
ken out of the room only with
the consent of the instructor."
The chairman of the Honor Code
Committee that year, Donn Wells,
pointed out that some professors
have made a practice of refusing
to allow exams to be taken out,
while others freely permitted it.
Wells considered the • Excom
resolution, which stated that the
decision should rest with the pro
fessor, to be a "movement by the
students to protect their own sys
tem from the few who might use
this means of abusing the privi
leges of the Honor Code."
He said he did not see it as an
administrative curb.

Wells added that the interpre
interpretation of the code and
he offered would in no way in
hibit students from leaving exam
rooms or taking them out for
apparently legitimate reasons.
He said it would serve only as a
"check on those very few who
would take unfair advantage of
the privilege."
Sonic students expressed the
opinion that such a move, as out
lined by Wells, would weaken the
code and that the honor system
should carry unlimited privilege.
According to a report in The
Daily, others said the code is "only
as good as it is practical and that
because of the few who will not
respect the privileges, checks are
needed just as civil law is set up
to protect the many from the
few."
Both sides of student opinion
—that which favored the new
interpretation of tch code and
that which did not—were voiced
at nn open discussion of the plan
a few days after it was proposed.
Only 23 students took part" in the
discussion and only five expressed
the belief that the plan would

Somewhat disheartened, Wells
declared that "no interpretation of

The strength of the honor
system at Stanford, since the
inception of the Honor Code in
1921, has grown as the Univer
sity has grown.
The success of the Honor Code
over the years has reached a point
where students think about it au
tomatically, but sometimes with
little understanding of what it
really means.
The responsibility for honorable
conduct in academic work has
rested squarely with the students
under the code. Students pledge
not only to observe the Honor
Code themselves, but to see that
others do likewise. This aspect of
the Honor Code is known as the
third person responsibility and is
considered to be the heart of the
code.
In general, students and fac
ulty members over the years
agreed that the code was work
ing well and that it could not he
strengthened by any regulation
arising out of a reinterprctation
of the code.
Within recent years, however,
there were some who felt there
was great strain on the code at the
point where second and third per
son responsibility ends — when,
for example, an examination is
taken out of the examination
room.
The question of whether stu
dents should be allowed to take
examinations out of the classroom
—a problem currently before the
student body—never was officially
stipulated in the Honor Code it
self.
In the fall of 1945, however,
the Honor Code Committee is
sued an orientation pamphlet to
students which stated that under
the honor system students arc
given such "traditional privi
leges" as taking their examina
tions outside the classrooms,
taking a break whenever they
please, going out of the building,
or talking to their friends, if
they so desire.
The same information was con
tained in a pamphlet, "You, the
Fundamental Standard, and the
Honor Code," which was distrib

CHARLES GOFF
. . a customary right"
The strength of the honor
system at Stanford, since the
inception of the Honor Code in
1921, has grown as the Univer
sity has grown.
The success of the Honor Code
over the years has reached a point
where students think about it au
tomatically, but sometimes with
little understanding of what it
really means.
The responsibility for honorable
conduct in academic work has
rested squarely with the students
under the code. Students pledge
not only to observe the Honor
Code themselves, but to see that
others do likewise. This aspect of
the Honor Code is known as the
third person responsibility and is
considered to be the heart of the
code.
In general, students and fac
ulty members over the years
agreed that the code was work
ing well and that it could not he
strengthened by any regulation
arising out of a reinterprctation
of the code.
Within recent years, however,
there were some who felt there
was great strain on the code at the
point where second and third per
son responsibility ends — when,
for example, an examination is
taken out of the examination
room.
The question of whether stu
dents should be allowed to take
examinations out of the classroom
—a problem currently before the
student body—never was officially
stipulated in the Honor Code it
self.
In the fall of 1945, however,
the Honor Code Committee is
sued an orientation pamphlet to
students which stated that under
the honor system students arc
given such "traditional privi
leges" as taking their examina
tions outside the classrooms,
taking a break whenever they
please, going out of the building,
or talking to their friends, if
they so desire.
The same information was con
tained in a pamphlet, "You, the
Fundamental Standard, and the
Honor Code," which was distrib
uted on campus last quarter.
Some students have interpreted
this "privilege" as a right.
Last summer, a survey made by
Charles Goff, chairman of the
Fundamental Standard Committee,
reported that "the customary right
of students to take their exams
from the appointed room has been
questioned on four notable occa
sions."
One of the occasions occurred
in 1041 when a professor in
formed President Wilbur lie did
not believe group restraint on
cheating in examinations could
be effective if students left the
exam room. President Wilbur
took the matter before the AS
SU Executive Committee and
that body decided that no revi
sion of the Honor Code should
he made at that time.
According to Golf's survey, this
has been interpreted as indicating
the approval of Excom of the
existing practice of taking exams
out of class.
Another case resulted on Nov.
10, 1947, when the Honor Code
Committee recommended to Ex
com that "a student, wishing to
take an examination outside the
assigned room, first ' secure the
consent of the instructor."
The recommendation was re
jected.
Then on Nov. 12, 1947, the
Honor Code Committee pro
posed to Excom that "students
should he required to take their
examinations in the assigned
room if adequate seating facili-

Slies arc provided, and that ex
ceptions be left to the direction
"? of the professor."
This proposal was defeated also.
Finally, on Oct. 5, 1949, the
problem was again brought up for
solution and it was decided that
the Honor Code Committee would
contact department heads express
ing the students' feeling that they
should have the "privilege" of
taking exams out of the classroom.
The last case, though never ac
tually settled, more closely 'paral
lels the situation confronting the
student body today than do the
other three cases.
One solution to the problem
offered in 1949 was contained in
an Excom resolution which stip
ulated that "providing adequate
seating is provided in the exam
ination room, exams will be ta
ken out of the room only with
the consent of the instructor."
The chairman of the Honor Code
Committee that year, Donn Wells,
pointed out that some professors
have made a practice of refusing
to allow exams to be taken out,
while others freely permitted it.
Wells considered the • Excom
resolution, which stated that the
decision should rest with the pro
fessor, to be a "movement by the
students to protect their own sys
tem from the few who might use
this means of abusing the privi
leges of the Honor Code."
He said he did not see it as an
administrative curb.

Wells added that the interpre
interpretation of the code and
he offered would in no way in
hibit students from leaving exam
rooms or taking them out for
apparently legitimate reasons.
He said it would serve only as a
"check on those very few who
would take unfair advantage of
the privilege."
Sonic students expressed the
opinion that such a move, as out
lined by Wells, would weaken the
code and that the honor system
should carry unlimited privilege.
According to a report in The
Daily, others said the code is "only
as good as it is practical and that
because of the few who will not
respect the privileges, checks are
needed just as civil law is set up
to protect the many from the
few."
