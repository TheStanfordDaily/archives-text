# TUESDAY SERIES
## British Museum Is Described 
### BILL WRIGHT 
"The British Museum in Peace
and War" was the topic of the
Tuesday Evening Series lecture
presented by Frank Chalton
Francis, British librarian, last
night in Memorial Auditorium.
Francis, who has been connected
with the library division of the Mu
seum since 1926, is now head of the
Department of Printed Books.
Francis told of the beginnings of
the Museum, talked about many of
the collections which the library
has acquired, and described the ef
fects of wartime bombing.
His talk was accompanied by a
series of slides showing views of the
Museum building, the rotunda-type
main reading room, other sections
of the library, some of the destruc
tion during the war, and the recon
struction done afterward.
The Museum passed its 200 th
birthday last year and contains
about six million volumes, in
cluding the world's largest collec
tion of books in the English lan
guage.
Francis said the library receives
a copy of every book and manu
script which is printed in the United
Kingdom and many volumes from
other countries.
The Museum, which "is both a
museum of antiquities and a na
tional library," is perhaps the best
library in the world of scholars in
history or literature, according to
Francis.
Instead of a card catalog, the
main reading room, which puts
25,000 reference volumes at the
access of the public, lists its con
tents in book form, pasting in
printed slips every month.
During the war many of the more
valuable volumes were removed.
First they were taken to country
estates, but when munitions fac
tories and other structures impor
tant to the defense effort sprang up
around the old houses, the books
and manuscripts were placed un
derground.
The newspaper library lost 5,000
bound volumes in one raid, and in
the last major raid on London dur
ing the war, incendiary bombs de
stroyed from 150,000 to 200,000 vol
umes.
Francis was introduced by Pro
fessor Francis R. Johnson of the
English Department.
