# Freshmen Buy Activity Cards
## 
### 
Sale of freshman class cai'ds got
off to a big start at Branner and
Roble halls Monday evening and
yesterday, according to Walt Hays,
freshman class president.
A total of $205 was collected from
the two frosh women's dorms be
fore the cards were distributed.
When the tickets went on sale at
Roble, they were sold at the rate of
one a minute for 50 minutes. Al
together $515 worth were sold the
first night, with $90 worth being
sold yesterday morning.
Branner led in sales with 37 per
cent, followed by Roble with 28 per
cent, Encina with six per cent, and
the Village with one per cent. The
sales committee, headed by Mary
Ivy, will continue sale of tickets
through Feb. 1.
The tickets, which will, pay for all
class functions for the next four
years, covering everything from the
talent show to the Senior Ball, cost
$5. "This is only 42 cents a quar
ter," declared John Hancock, pub
licity chairman.
"The class must collect at least
$6,000 from ticket sales in order to
be able to function for the next
four Hancock added.
According to Hays the Encina
men will have a chance to raise
their percentage, as a representa
tive in each wing will be selling the
tickets.
Two stunts are to be used for
sales promotion. A picture of a
model will be put up in Encina and
for each 20 per cent of tickets sold
an article of clothing will be taken
off the model. A drawing will be
held the last day of the sales and
the winner will get a free dinner,
a ticket to a play, and an evening of
dancing in San Francisco for him
self and a date.
