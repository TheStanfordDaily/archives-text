# New Deadline Set For Quad Photos
## 
### 
The Quad, because of the upsweep
in the number of appointments
made yesterday, has announced that
it will definitely take pictures of
students today and tomorrow.
Only sophomores, juniors, and
seniors who have not been photo
graphed or who wish to have their
pictures retaken should show up at
the Quad office between 9 a.m. and
noon, and 1 and 5 p.m.
Editors Ralph Buchwalter and Jon
Stufflebeem indicate that they are
still disappointed about the turnout
so farâ€”B9 people in two days. They
had expected 100 people per day as
a minimum.
Buckwalter stated that he was es
pecially sorry that the women's res
idences had not turned out strongly
this year for their pictures.
No freshmen will be photographed
except those who have joined an
eating club or fraternity. Those who
have already had their pictures
taken may request to have their
pictures included with their clubs
or houses.
