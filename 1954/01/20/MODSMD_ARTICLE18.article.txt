DISRUPTS McCARTHY HEARING—Nathan Mills (center) is forcibly ejected from Senator Joseph
McCarthy's "Red" hearing in Boston after slugging it out with guards. Mills had shouted, "You're
a menace!" at McCarthy and started swinging when other spectators shouted, "Get him out!"
Mills is one of nine G-E employees at Lynn, Mass., who invoked the Fifth Amendment when
asked about Communism and espionage, and who were suspended by the company.
