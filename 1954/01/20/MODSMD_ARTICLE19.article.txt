### 
PANMUNJOM, Wednesday, Jan. 20 (UP)—Jubilant, singing Chi- 1
nese and North Korean prisoners marched to freedom today in a
dramatic climax to their three-year battle against return to Cota
munism.
The first of the 22,029 prisoners who rejected repatriation

k marched a mile and one-half from
their neutral zone camps to Allied
control at 8:52 a.m. (3:52 p.m. PST
Tuesday).
The transfer was orderly, despite
warnings by the Indian command
and the Communists that the liber
ation was a violation of the armi
stice.
The Reds,- in a last-ditch attempt
to win back their soldiers, began
broadcasting "come home" appeal
to the POW's during the night and
continued as the compounds rapidly
emptied.
The Communist commanders
charged only last night that tin
release of the prisoners would he
"armed abduction."
Five of the 2,000-Chinese and four
of the 1,000 Koreans taken from
compounds by 11 a.m. asked to re
turn to Communism, Indian guard
said.
But the rest gave no indication
they felt they were being "ab
ducted."
There was no report of the 317
Allied prisoners, including 21 Ainei
icans, who elected to stay with thi
Communists. The Reds, who wanted
the POW's held for a Korean pt ico
conference, had indicated that they
would not accept Indian delivery of
the POW's.
Chinese prisoners were the fit t
to reach the United Nations control.
They moved down a barbed wire
lane to waiting trucks. From there
the freedom trail led by truck and
ship to new homes on the Chinese
Nationalist island stronghold of
Formosa.
The Indian command hoped to
tunn back the prisoners at tin
rate of 1,500 per hour, completing
the job by 11 p.m. (fi a.m. PST
Wednesday).
The Koreans were loaded into
boxcars and were to be taken to
relocation centers on the east and
west coasts of South Korea.
President * Syngman Rhee hailed
the return of the anti-Communi; 1,
prisoners and said they had gn en
the Reds the "most resounding ide
ological defeat in their history."
