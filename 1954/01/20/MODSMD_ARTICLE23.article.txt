# CAMPUS OPINION
## Professor Presents Views on Honor Code 
### 
To the Editor:
Some of us on the faculty were once Stanford
tmdergraduates and grew up in the atmosphere of
the Farm. Few will have forgotten what it means to
live under a student government, the honor system
and — to mention a third Stanford institution which
bears upon the present discussion of classrooms and
examinations—the class average method tor com
puting grades. Although of the opinion that the is ue
is one to be handled by a properly functioning stu
dent government such as is ours, I venture to draw
the attention of your readers to one or two points oi
some importance.
The honor system reflects the transfer to the
students and their government of a function at one
time (and vainly) exercised by the faculty. 'I'his
function is to see. among other tilings, thai the ex
amination paper is the student's own and that no
student is robbed of his desert by a clas* average
which has been distorted through the dishonesty
of some other in the examination.
To give protection against infractions by the weak
willed or the overly-tempted the sanctions of the
individual conscience have been reinforced by what
seems to be called today "the third person," thi.it is,
the moral support of numbers and of the warning
tapping of a pencil.

If today I were a student impaled upon the class
average, (he sight of my class-mates, fine as I
might believe tlicm to be, leaving the room to pore
over their blue books tmid (he temptations to
which privacy exposes its all would laise serious
doubts in my mind ;c to how well the system was
in fact protecting that cardinal interest of mine and
my fellows: our grade-point standing.
The infirmities to which the tlcsh is heir are hot
all phy ical. IJndci the pre: i nt practice there must
inevitably be der lielion (And who shall cast the
first stone"') In the circumstances i:; the student in
terest properly protected Ivy the honor system so
long as some student: ieavt the room to«write their
blue-books outside?
Let me'add that I have made no requests of the
students in my dim • I should regret to see the
question kft to th< indr.> I tal professor to decide,
or to! that matter lo the individual department. It
ketone to the province > I Indent government and
should be ( mpu: .vide in its application. Hut that
is only one man'; opinion and carries no special
weight except tha' it owner was himself once a
Stanford under-rjduate.
