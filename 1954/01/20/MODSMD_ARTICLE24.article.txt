### PETE GROTHE 
"Take Care of My Little Girl," a picture that
Hollywood should have taken care not to produce,
recently appeared at Stanford's greatest safety-valve,
the Sunday Evening flicks. The result was the big
gest noise since a history prof announced he was

going to hold a midterm the Mon
day after the USC football game.
"Take Care of My Little Girl,"
presumably a daring expose on
sorority life, was a good idea.
But, like most good ideas in
Hollywood, it fell along the way
side. The fact that Hollywood
again failed to portray college
life as it really is was borne out
by the audience response of the
loudest assortment of instruments

and noisemakers this side of Spike Jones.
There were several "interesting" sequences in the
flick. One concerns Chad, the social wow of Chi
Omicron fraternity, which is absolutely THE best
at Midwestern University.
Chad, who apparently didn't have the grades to
enter Southern Cal, went to Midwestern and was
having trouble in French. If he didn't pass French,
he wouldn't graduate. This is where Liz comes in.
Liz, it turns out, is a whiz at French, and Chad

persuade'; her (in a reiif only equalled by Lassie's
licking ol hei two pupj>i< ) (Iml tic should write his
blue book lot him. Thi I.>allows in profound con
templation, is ebc;'tin< ; \ but she does it anyway.
Chad i.i .< i.•• iv that he announces, "Gee,
you're : well, Li/ I'm :'.uini> to toll every fellow in the
house what you did for me."
Chi Omicron, it appear . has no members of the
Honor Code Committee in its enrol Intent.
Ami then ( had "til oIY ti e classic of the night,
"The word <>! ihis is goih;; to spread around cam
pus, and iigoing to make you so popular that
you'll pi-d»,i(:!\ »t! chs'ted freshman queen."
We submit that this i. an interesting concept: all
you % have to do to get elected freshman queen is
cheat in a test.
There are other compelling parts to the picture:
(1) The fact that freshmen are portrayed by actors
at least 27 years old.
(2) The scene at the all-femme sorority formal
in which '.'irl dance with other girls and in which
girls cut in with ea< h other. This provoked deafening
response from the audience.
It was not inappropriate that "Take Care of My
Little Girl" got lie most, brutal mutilation in Sunday
Evening Movie catcall history. •
