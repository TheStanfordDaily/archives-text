### HELEN DEWAR 
As the line of ski-topped cars
swing off Palm Drive eastward
toward the Sierra slopes, skiing
again assumes an important po
sition among the galaxy of win
ter sports.
With a membership of nearly 250,
the Stanford Ski Club, one of the
largest extra-curricular groups on
campus, is the core of all Farm ski
ing activities. The president of the
club this year is Phil Zander.
The Ski Club was organized in
19:56 and in its first year had a
total membership of 41). Since
that time it has multiplied to the
extent that in 1947 it had nearly
1,000 members.
The ski team, directly affiliated
with the club, was organized in 1937.
The team, usually one of the best on
the Coast, was represented in the
1948 Olympics by Farm skiers Bob
Blatt, "Boots" Blatt, and Brynhild
Grasmoen. Stan Pyron is the coach
of this year's team, which has not
yet been chosen.
Each weekend scores of eager ski
ers, bunnies and expert racers alike,
head for Squaw Valley, Yosemite,
Dodge Ridge, Sugar Bowl, and a
number of other ski areas in the
Sierra. At Squaw Valley the club
provides a special $3 rate instead of
the usual $4 rate.
Tiie first big event scheduled on
the Ski Club calendar is the Win
ter Carnival taking place at Yo
semite on Feb. 5, (j, and 7. Giant
slalom, obstacle, and bunny races
will be held Saturday, followed that
night by the annual dance and ban
quet for the awarding of prizes to
be held in the Indian Room of the
Ahwahnee Hotel.
The Stanford Ski Club will de
fend its last year's championship
against Cal and San Jose State
at the yearly Tri-School Meet at
Soda Springs on Feb. 13.
On Feb. 2(5, 27, and 28, the Inter
collegiate Conference Division
Championships will be held in con
junction with the fifth annual Tres
idder Memorial Cup Meet at Yo
semite. The cup was given in honor
of Dr. Tresidder, former president
of Stanford University, by Bill
Janss, a Stanford Olympic skier.
The Farm team has won this meet
two times out of three.
The last mass movement to the
snow - covered slopes takes place
over spring vacation when 90 of
Stanford's avid skiers take in the
"Learn to Ski Week" at Sun Valley,
Idaho.
