should enhance Stanford's scoring
possibilities.

The Stanford varsity rugby squad had its lirst practice of the reason Monday. In charge were
Coach Pete Kmetovic and Assistant Coaches Joe Ruelz, Hob Ghilotti, and Marty Feldman.
The coaches immediately began the task of dividing and foiming varsity and junior varsity
teams out of the 85 aspirants who appeared on th" rugby field. They will have two weeks in
which to prep the team for its liist game.
The opener is scheduled lor lan. 30 at 2:' so p.m. on the rugby field against the San Francisco
Olympic Club.
A tentative schedule of 12 games confronts the rugby varsity. Some of the other teams included

on the schedule are California, COP -
Palo Alto Ramblers, and UCLA.
The Bruins are considered to be
the up-and-coming power in Pacific
Coast rugby circles.
Back to vie for the 15 position. 1
which comprise the first-string team
are many of last year's players.
In rugby most of the points are
made through penalty kicks, conse

quently kicker Dorsey Atkinson is
considered the most valuable re
turnee. He was one of the leading
tou t ; for the Indians last season.
Hesl All-Around
Ted Tanner is regarded as the
best all-around man, having played
every position last year, while Dick -
Monteith is considered to be the
best tackier.
Ron Cook, Ron Bush, Jack Lewis,
and Dick Crepeau are top break
away threats, while Hill Gary, Jim
McCainant, Sam Thornton, Tony
Mosich, Paul Revak, Howie Standi
fer, and Jarvis Watson are other ex
perienced players.
Some footballers out for the first
time include Ernie Doin, Bill Rog
ers, John Sevier, Tom Jacobs, Scott
Jones, and Walt Eagle.

Scrums Lost
Coach Kmetovic lost most of last
year's stellar scrums. They were
led by Marty Feldrnan and included
Norm Manoogian, Jack Bonetti,
Barry Smith, Len Mayrhofer, John
Stanton, and Dick Borda.
However, if Kmetovic can form a
substantial scrum line, the veterans
and new prospects in the backfield
should enhance Stanford's scoring
possibilities.
Incidentally, this season will mark
the 49th anniversary of rugby's in
novation at Stanford.
