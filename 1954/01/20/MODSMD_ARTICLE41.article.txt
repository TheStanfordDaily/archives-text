TWO IN ONE—A specially modified Boeing B-29 climbs over Seattle carrying its Douglas Sky
rocket for a supersonic flight. The mother ship carries the small plane to the desired altitude, then
drops it like a bomb. The pilot turns on rocket-firing switches and roars away. The Skyrocket
research plane has attained a speed of 1,238 miles per hour and an altitude of 79,494 feet.
