# '6-MP' Called Better Cure For Leukemia
## 
### 
New clinical trials of a recently
introduced drug, which were car
ried out by physicians of Stanford
Medical School and the San Fran
cisco Veterans Administration Hos
pital, have shown more encouraging
results in the treatment of acute
leukemia than have been obtained
by other known methods.
Called (J - mercaptopurine, or
"(i-MP" for short, the drug estab
lished a record of improvement
among nearly two - thirds of 13
patients aged 15 to 78. A prelimi
nary report of the investigation is
published in the current Stanford
Medical Bulletin.
By this showing, 6-MP appears
about four times more potent
against acute leukemia in adult pa
tients than the best previous reme
diesâ€”cortisone, ACTH, or the folic
acid antagonists. Moreover, it is less
toxic.
The report was prepared by Drs.
Byron E. Hall, Marvin D. Richards,
Forrest M. Willett, Thomas V.
Feichtmeier, and Paul M. Aggeler.
The physicians urged caution in
interpreting their results too op
timistically. They stated there is
much additional research to be
done.
Experience with acute leukemia
shows that although drugs may halt
the disease and the patient returns
to an apparently healthy condition,
a recurrence is to be expected. How
ever, 6-MP has proved effective in
treating such recurrences, too.'
