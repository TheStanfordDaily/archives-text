# Mrs. Lord Says U.N. Is 'Only Hope'
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Mrs. Mary Lord, the United
States' number one woman in
the United Nations, came to
Stanford yesterday, displaying
a missionary zeal for the cause
of the United Nations.
Mrs. Lord, who succeeded Eleanor
Roosevelt as the U.S. representa
tive on the U.N. Commission on Hu
man Rights, told The Daily that
American public opinion has been
swung over to the U.N. "in a real
istic way."
"Everyone was starry-eyed about
the United Nations at first," said the
48-year-old wife of wealthy New
York textile man Oswald B. Lord.
"Then a period of disillusion set in.
Now, there is a realistic acceptance
of what, the United Nations is. Peo
ple realize what its limitations are.
But they further realize that its ac
complishments have been spectacu
lar, that it has achieved marvelous
progress in eight years.
"And people are further coming
to realize that the U.N. is our only
hope.
"A recent survey by Princeton
showed that 84 per cent of the
people believe in some type of
world co-operation. Of the re
maining 16 per cent, nine per cent
are out-and-out isolationists and
the rest believe the world situa
tion to be hopeless. The trouble
is that way over 70 per ccnt of
those who believe in some type
of world co-operation don't do
anything about it. It is essential
that more people speak out for
the cause of the United Nations."
Mrs. Lord, whose indefatigability
is legend, struck out at the Bricker
Amendment (proposed by Ohio's
Republican Senator). She said that
the Bricker Amendment, which
would transfer power in foreign re
lations from the President to Con
gress, might harm United States
participation in the U.N., "although
I haven't 'Studied the situation well
enough to know in what specific
ways."
She told the lIR, which gave a
luncheon in her honor, "The at
tackers of UNESCO have been
guilty of falsifying the facts. They
have taken statements out of con
text, which have had the effect' of
completely distorting the real
facts."
Mrs. Lord, a member of the
wealthy Pillsbury (flour) family,
said that some of the strongest sup
port for international co-operation
came from church groups.
The lady wi,th the unforced smile
praised the Stanford campus. "I
was at the top of Hoover Tower to
day, and I must say, you have the
loveliest campus I have ever seen.
It's not like those crowded Eastern
campuses which edge right into the
city."
Mrs. Lord told Dr. James Wat
kins' U.S. Foreign Policy class an
anecdote about how closely the sat
ellites follow the example of the
Russians.
"When I was attending a confer
ence in Geneva last summer, an in
teresting thing happened. The var
ious satellite delegates walked into
the meeting, sat down at their places
and looked straight ahead without
saying hello to me.
"Then the Russian delegate en
tered and greeted me warmly. Im
mediately after, all the satellite del
egates came up and wished me a
friendly good morning."

day, and I must say, you have the
loveliest campus I have ever seen.
It's not like those crowded Eastern
campuses which edge right into the
city."
Mrs. Lord told Dr. James Wat
kins' U.S. Foreign Policy class an
anecdote about how closely the sat
ellites follow the example of the
Russians.
"When I was attending a confer
ence in Geneva last summer, an in
teresting thing happened. The var
ious satellite delegates walked into
the meeting, sat down at their places
and looked straight ahead without
saying hello to me.
"Then the Russian delegate en
tered and greeted me warmly. Im
mediately after, all the satellite del
egates came up and wished me a
friendly good morning."
Mrs. Mary Lord, the United
States' number one woman in
the United Nations, came to
Stanford yesterday, displaying
a missionary zeal for the cause
of the United Nations.
Mrs. Lord, who succeeded Eleanor
Roosevelt as the U.S. representa
tive on the U.N. Commission on Hu
man Rights, told The Daily that
American public opinion has been
swung over to the U.N. "in a real
istic way."
"Everyone was starry-eyed about
the United Nations at first," said the
48-year-old wife of wealthy New
York textile man Oswald B. Lord.
"Then a period of disillusion set in.
Now, there is a realistic acceptance
of what, the United Nations is. Peo
ple realize what its limitations are.
But they further realize that its ac
complishments have been spectacu
lar, that it has achieved marvelous
progress in eight years.
"And people are further coming
to realize that the U.N. is our only
hope.
"A recent survey by Princeton
showed that 84 per cent of the
people believe in some type of
world co-operation. Of the re
maining 16 per cent, nine per cent
are out-and-out isolationists and
the rest believe the world situa
tion to be hopeless. The trouble
is that way over 70 per ccnt of
those who believe in some type
of world co-operation don't do
anything about it. It is essential
that more people speak out for
the cause of the United Nations."
Mrs. Lord, whose indefatigability
is legend, struck out at the Bricker
Amendment (proposed by Ohio's
Republican Senator). She said that
the Bricker Amendment, which
would transfer power in foreign re
lations from the President to Con
gress, might harm United States
participation in the U.N., "although
I haven't 'Studied the situation well
enough to know in what specific
ways."
She told the lIR, which gave a
luncheon in her honor, "The at
tackers of UNESCO have been
guilty of falsifying the facts. They
have taken statements out of con
text, which have had the effect' of
completely distorting the real
facts."
Mrs. Lord, a member of the
wealthy Pillsbury (flour) family,
said that some of the strongest sup
port for international co-operation
came from church groups.
The lady wi,th the unforced smile
praised the Stanford campus. "I
was at the top of Hoover Tower to
day, and I must say, you have the
loveliest campus I have ever seen.
It's not like those crowded Eastern
campuses which edge right into the
city."
