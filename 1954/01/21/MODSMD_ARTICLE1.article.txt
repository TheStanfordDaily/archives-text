# Honor Code
## The
						Question of Exams Poses Some Problems 
### Third in a Series) By BOB REZAK 
Serious and concertcd ef
forts to obtain a uniform inter
pretation of the Honor Code in
all departments of the Univer
sity began with increased fer
vor in 1949.
Through the ASSU Executive
Committee, students proposed var
ious solutions to the problem of
whether or not students should be
allowed to take examinations out
of the classroom.
The Daily commented editori
ally that the Honor Code should
"remain a working ideal based on
trust rather than rules and regu
lations. This concept is the very
core of the code."
That feeling seemed to be shared
pretty generally by the rest of the
student body.
The editorial added:
"The Honor Code stands for
mutual trust among students
and between students and fac
ulty. That trust should not suf
fer when a student takes his ex
amination from the exam room
to a place where the tension is
not so great, where lie may relax
and do his best work . .
The issue regarding taking ex
ams out of the room came to a
head again last summer when

Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler spoke to the summer ASSU
Executive Committee.
He pointed out that the Honor
Code contains no specific regula
tion governing the taking of ex
aminations from the classroom. He
reported that many members of
the administration and faculty are
anxious lor a clear-cut rule in the
matter.

The dean told the student lead
ers they had the undisputed right
to settle the issue through their
elected councils. And he said that
the Academic Council, the legis
lative body of the faculty, in 1921
turned over the full administra
tion of conduct in examinations to
students.
He warned that unless student
action was forthcoming in the fall,
the Academic Council might feel
compelled to take action on its
own.
Professor Raymond Ilarriman,
then head of the Classics De
partment and a member of the
faculty here for 25 years, ap
pealed to the students to find a
solution to the problem before
the faculty is "forced to step in."
Last fall the problem was
dropped into the hands of the Ex
ecutive Committee by Charles
Got!, chairman of the Fundamen
tal Standards Committee, who
had attended the summer Excom
sessions at which the problem was
discussed.
Goff circulated a report which
stated that students are "unaware
their rights in the matter. They
are told they have the privilege of
writing an exam any place they
desire. But occasionally an in
structor will refuse them this
right, and they do not know by
what authority he is able to do
this."
"This," the report continued,
"weakens the Honor Code by
making it appear inconsistent to
the student body."
The Executive Committee,
realizing that it could not offer
a solution to flic problem with
out some specific information,
appointed a nine-member com
mittee composed of student
leaders and two faculty mem
bers to poll the faculty and find
out whether a problem does ex
ist.
The nine - member committee,
nfter a quarter-long survey which
brought them into contact with
the heads of 21 University de
partments, last week released a
report of its findings.
It said a problem does exist and
Recommended that a clear - cut
rule be devised to settle the ques
tion once and for all.
The committee also proposed a
plan calling for students in their
respective major departments to
meet and confer with faculty
members in the department and
together adopt a departmental
policy that will be binding.
And so, it appears, the students
are once more working together
on a project they worked feverish
ly together on 33 years ago—the
Honor Code.
