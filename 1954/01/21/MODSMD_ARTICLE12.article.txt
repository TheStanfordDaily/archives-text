### RUSS WILKS 
The revitalized Stanford Sports
Car Club launches its first pro
gram of competitive racing of
the year Feb. 7 when it competes
with cars from the Pacific Coast
at the Lodi Drag Strip near Stock
ton.
The Lodi Strip is hosting the
quarter of a mile drags which will
get under way in the morning and
continue on until 4 p.m. Although
there will not be any interclub rac
ing, Stanford will award four tro
phies to the members who perform
best, in each class.
There will be racing in the
straight American stock class, the
hopped-up stock class, and in the
two sports car division. One divi
sion consists of the Jaguars and
other foreign makes with engines
heavier than 1,500 cc. and the other
is run with cars that contain en
gines lighter than 1,500 cc. The drags
in these divisions are run on a cubic
displacement per weight basis.
The races are open to all students.
The Stanford group will leave from
the Cellar at 8:30 a.m.. Feb. 7.
The club was-founded in the fall
of 1052 and after a slow beginning,
which necessitated a complete over
haul of its organization, it has
broadened its scope of activities.
