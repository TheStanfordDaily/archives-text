### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 (UP) —President Eisenhower will send
Congress tomorrow a fiscal 1955 budget calling for about $66,-
000,000,000 in new spending with top emphasis on air power and
atomic weapons.
The President also has promised a 25-point tax reform plan.

Copies of the budget have
been distributed to newsmen
under a secrecy lid for simulta
neous release with the arrival of
the President's message at the
House and Senate tomorrow noon.
But Mr. Eisenhower outlined his
proposed spending plans for the 12
months, starting next July 1, in his
State of the Union message to Con
gress Jan. 7.
He said then that his administra
tion had slashed $7,000,000,000 from
former President Truman's spend
ing estimates for this year and plans
a further $5,000,000,000 cut in fiscal
1955.
That would mean federal spend
ing of about $6(5,000,000,000 next
year compared with this year's es
timated outlay of about $71,500,000,-
000, leaving a deficit of something
under $3,000,000,000.
The President's tax reform plan,
also promised in his State of the
Union message, would give relief to
certain groups of individuals, such
as working widows with children.
The spending proposals were al
most certain to encounter some
Congressional opposition. Chairman
John Taber (R., N.Y.) of the House
Appropriations Committee has said
the administration could hold
spending to $65,000,000.j)00 and bal
ance to budget next yetir.
In addition to reduced spending,
Taber's budget balancing assump
tions were based on his belief that
federal revenues will be larger next
year than the administration has
estimated.
The new budget will be the first
for which Mr. Eisenhqwer will be
wholly responsible. Lfist year he
contented himself wjth making
piecemeal revisions in the Truman
budget as his "new teahi" found its
footing.
