# Senate Backs Seaway Plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 20 (UP)—
The Senate voted tonight to let the
United States join Canada in build
ing the disputed St. Lawrence sea
way, giving President Eisenhower a
victory on the first major issue of the
new session.
The bill now goes to the House
and an uncertain fate. The House
Public Works committee, which in
cludes many seaway opponents, re
fused last year even to consider the
measure until the Senate acted.
The President requested the legis
lation earlier this month, calling it
necessary for both security and eco
nomic reasons.
Seaway backers, led by midwest
crners of both parties, contended it
is vital to permit iron ore shipments
to inland steel mills in event of war,
and for industrial development of
the midwest.
The bill, as passed by the Senate,
would create a government corpora
tion and permit it to borrow $105,-
000,000 from the Treasury to finance
this country's share of the seaway.
Canada has already voted to go
ahead with the project, which would
permit ocean-going vessels to reach
Great Lakes ports.
The project calls for a 27-foot
channel in the St. Lawrence river.
It involves construction of dams,'
locks, and canals in the International
Rapids section of the river near Og
densburg, N.Y., plus some dredging
and channel improvement in the
Thousand Islands section of the river.
Tolls will be charged to permit
eventual repayment of the loan.
