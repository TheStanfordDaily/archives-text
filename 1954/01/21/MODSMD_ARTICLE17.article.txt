# NEW HONOR CODE PLAN TABLED
## Plan Says OK to Take Exams From Classroom BULLETIN 
### BOB REZAK Associate Editor, The Daily 
The Executive Committee decided by a 10 to 4 roll-call vote at 11:15
last night to table until next week action on a motion by A 1 Ivey to
amend the ASSU bylaws to provide that students may take examina
tions out of the examination room except in special circumstances.
The Ivey proposal reads: "Examinations may be taken out of the
examination room except in circumstances where a majority of stu
dents in the class feel that the taking of examinations from the room
will be detrimental to their performance on the test."
Ivey suggested that his amendment be added to the ASSU Consti
tution as a third Honor Code Rule, following the first two rules which
provide for the maintenance of first and third person responsibility.
Excom also voted 8 tc- ■? not to approve the Carr committee report
which proposed that examination policy be decided at departmental
meetings.

The ASSU Executive Committee, other student leaders, and
approximately 45 interested students, last night tackled the
weighted problem of interpieting the Honor Code as it applie:
to the question of allowing students to take examinations out
of the classroom. The lengthy session lasted nearly four and a
half hours.

The discussion — a sometimes'*'
heated debate that was sparked by
flowery oratory from the floor —
centered around a plan proposed by
a special Excom sub - committee
which made a quarter-long investi
gation of the Honor Code and the
problem of whether or not students
should be allowed to take examina
tions out of the classroom.
The plan essentially calls for
the formulation of departmental
policies relating to the exam
question with the ultimate deci
sion being made together by de
partment faculty members and
major students within each de
partment.
Jim Mitchell, graduate student
representative to Excom and a
member of the sub-committee, pre
sented a minority report on the pro
posed plan which, he said, expressed
views held by himself, "at least a
few members of Excom, and various
students."
Mitchell said the "primary objec
tion to the operation of the code, '
other than those set forth in the
majority report, is in the reporting
and handling of a violation."
"Both faculty and students are
hazy on procedural methods of
reporting Honor Code violations
and refuse to report them be
cause of lack of knowledge of
procedure before the committee,
or lack of faith in the ability of
the committee to fairly dispose of
the case," he added.
The graduate representative sug
gested that the "only plan" which
would take care of both of these
problems is one providing for the
"acceptance of the students them
selves of tho responsibility to prop
erly administer their Honor Code."
He said this responsibility cannot
be shifted to a student-faculty com
mittee.
The faculty doesn't believe stu
dents are "in good faith" when
they leave the classroom, Mitchell
said, because there have been in
stances when there is no need
to leave the room, such as in a
one-hour objective test.
On the question of cheating, Don
Leighton, a senior, asked whether
there was much cheating taking
place.
Dave Carr, chairman of the sub
committee, said it was his opinion
that, the majority of the faculty be
lieves allowing students to take ex
ams out of the room gives students
an "added urge to cheat."
He emphasized that the faculty
does believe that taking a test out
of the room increasess the chances
of. cheating.
The whole discussion — some 45
minutes of it up until this point in
the lengthy session — grew tense
when Jim Jennings, third-year law
student, cited major criticisms of
the "departmental plan."
Jennings, who said he was a
member of an investigating com
mittee studying a smiliar prob
lem in 1041), declared the plan
i proposed by the present sub-coin
| mittec was "entirely inconsistent"
! with plans initiated in 1949.
"It is surprising," he" said, "that
in five years we could reach such
diametrically opposed ressults on
the Honor Code."
Several times the assemblage
broke out into spontaneous ap
plause for the law student, who
spoke only from briefly written
notes.
Jennings said it. was "odd" that a
group spends a whole quarter in
vestigating the problem and then

"decides the decision is not their
to make." The committee, he urged
"should decide yes or no on the plat
and tell Excom what to do."

Excom meeting will l>e published
in tomorrow's Daily.)
