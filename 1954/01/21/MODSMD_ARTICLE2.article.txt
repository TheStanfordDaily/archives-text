# Davis Says Stanford in Favor Of Engineering Corner Detour
## 
### 
Student and faculty reaction to the chaining off of Engineering
Corner has been overwhelmingly favorable, according to Stanford
Police Chief Gordon Davis.
"We have received a surprisingly large number of compliments
about the new plan," said Davis. "Faculty members appreciate it

+because of the lessened noise in the
Education Building and Engineer
ing Corner classrooms."
Davis commented that he has also
received letters of praise from stu
dents, both for the increased safety
in crossing to the Cellar and for the
better study conditions in the Edu
cation Library.
"One letter, for instance," said
Davis, "from a student said that this
is the first time since he came to
Stanford that he has found the
Education Building as enjoyable for
study as the Library.
The L-shaped area is roped off
between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. Stu
dents may cross in the street during
those hours. Automobiles that nor
mally travel that route need to de
tour either to Arguello or Serra
Street.
