SEOUL, Korea, Thursday, Jan. 21
(UP) — Freedom-bound anti-Com
munist war prisoners swarmed into
the Seoul railroad station and onto
ships at nearby Inchon harbor to
day on the first leg of their journey
to a new life under the United Na
tions.
The North Korean and Chine,<■
POWs were turned over to the U.N.
in a marathon release operation that
began at 8 a.m. yesterday and ended
at 1:30 a.m. today.
Meanwhile, the Indians said they
would decide later in the day what
to do with 347 pro-Red prisoner ,
including 21 Americans, whom the
Communists have refused to tak<
back. The Reds insist the Indian
keep them until a Korean peace con
ference decides their fate.
