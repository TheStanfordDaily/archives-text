# Pay Boost for Congressmen, Judges
## 
### 
Once again our nation's legislators may put
themselves in the unusual position of turning
down a raise.
Last week's recommendation by a special
Presidential Commission for pay-boosts for
Congressmen and federal judges brought im
mediate protests from the representatives and
senators themselves, cries of "Too much," and
"Unnecessary."
The recommended boo^ls—from $15,000 to
$27,000 a year for the Congressmen, from $25,-
000 to $34,000 for Supreme Court justices, and
similar boosts for lower court judges — are
large. They are also long overdue.
We can well understand that Congressmen

preaching economy may be embarrassed to
ask for a raise in an election year.
But the motives behind passage of this legis
lation would clearly be far from selfish. Gov
ernment salaries now are shamefully low,
compared to the wages men of the caliber we
want in our government might draw from pri
vate employment. These low government sal
aries are having the real and unfortunate effect
of limiting our Congress and courts to men
with independent means.
We urge November-minded Congressmen
to take account of the long-range values of such
a pay raise. Governments cannot be run by
economy alone. —Barbara Tuerk
