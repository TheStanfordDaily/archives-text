## Parking Revenue for Crew? 
### 
To the Editor:
In consideration of the recent proposal to study the
possibility of charging a parking fee for those at
tending stadium games, we think that aversion to
such a scheme would only be overcome if it was
known that the revenue would aid a specific athletic
group, such as the crew, which*is not now supported.
