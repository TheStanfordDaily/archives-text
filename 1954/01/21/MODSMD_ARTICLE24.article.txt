### DICK MANSFIELD 
Observe your neighbor in the Reserved Book
Room; is his brow dark with scholarly endeavor?
Does he cover the foolscap with notes which he will
later be unable to read? Does he present a picture of

studious application? If so, he is
probably reading the textbook
before him.
On the other hand, if he chuck
les to himself and doodles in his
notebook as he turns the pages of
the text, he is probably reading
the margins.
Most fascinating of all Reserved
Book Room pastimes (gathering
outside the door of the Reserved
Book Room to shout and sing

songs is not a pastime; it is a Study Break) is the
science of Marginology. Incorporating features of
psychology, cryptography, and patience, it deals in
the mystic drives which compel people to scribble all
over the reserved books.
In fargone times the cave man took a sharpened
bone and drew woolly mammoths on the wall of
his cave. The aboriginal of today slips into the Re
served Bnok Room, draws several books until he
finds one with wide margins, then gets out (a) a
greasy pencil or (b) a leaky pen and starts ex
pressing himself.
Some people like to underline the reserved books.
Usually they don't use a ruler; they just take pencil
in hand and underline a paragraph here, a mono
syllable there for about half an hour and then check
another required reading off the syllabus.

The Reserved Book Room philosopher will write his
bon mots and contributions to knowledge in the mar
gins when he's through underlining. Perhaps the
author will say, "Grover Cleveland vetoed everything
in sight." The philosopher will add sentiments such
as, "Crudely put!" Then comes the secondary phil
osopher, who comments on the first philosopher, to
wit: "No-good Republican!" Then perhaps a cave man
will come along and draw a picture of an elephant.
Which brings us, albeit haltingly, to people who
draw pictures in books. What inspires drawings of
daisies in the margin of u source reading on the
origins of chemical analysis? Or the crude but un
mistakeable likeness of a face on the title page of
American Constitutional Decisions? It's been a long
time since Big Game, but diagrams of cross-bucks
still turn up in the philosophy books.
Then come the fumblers who spill ink in the re
served books. One type of ink will soak through forty
pages of Economics in 10 seconds. Look for the silver
lining: It gives the book a sort of continuity, if you
please.
Then there are checkmarks and circles and ex
clamation points and stars. All of them are at
tached to irrelevant material; a dupe once read 150
pages of Political Science in little over an hour by
copying all the passages someone else had starred and
thereby acquired a good practical knowledge of how
many pages there were in the book. He subsequently
astounded his professor with an exam dissertation
which insisted that the executive branch of our gov
ernment is Wall Street. He is being investigated.
And while they're at it, they're going to try a little
Marginology. And about time too.
