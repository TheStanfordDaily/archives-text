## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Three of baseball's best, Rill
Dickey, Rabbit Marunville, and
Bill Terry, were yesterday voted
into baseball's Hall ot Fame.
Maranville led the voting with
209 votes out of 252 I>a 1 lot The
■ portswriters showed their usual
I'ji in in voting in the great short

top. Each year, Maranville waited
hopefully for a nomination to the
Hall, bill wa ; ju I voted down. Two
weeks ago be died, and this year
he was voted in with ease.
He was one of the most colorful j
playei of all time. He always knew
that the lam were the backbone of
the name and never let them down, j
He is best remembered for spark
in.' (he 1911 Braves from last place
to a world's: championship in three
months In a crficial game during
the stretch drive, he caught a key
pop-up behind his back.
Although he hit only .258 in 23
• ea: ons, he made up for it in the
timeliness of bis hits and the class
ol his deft nsive play. He played
Imm 1912 to 1935, and might have
played ten more years had not a
broken leg shortened his career. He
i one of four men to bat over 10,000 1
times.
Dickey was second in the bal- j
hifing with 2112 votes. Dickey and
Mickey Cochran rate as the top
rec iviyrs of all time. His 202
homers rule as all-time top for a
i itrher. although Roy Campaiiclla
figures In catch him some day.
Me taught over Ififl games a year
•fur I.! years, another -Hpu'k. His

3.'5 World Series games caught is
another mark. In 1931i, lie hit .362
and hatted in 107 runs in 112
games, lie hit .313 for his career.
Great Yankee hurlers such as
Lefty Gomez and lied Itu fling
were quick to credit Dickey for
most of their success. He was the
unsung hero of probably the best
Yankee team of all time.
Terry hit .341 in 14 seasons to
rate as eighth of all time. He hit
.401 in 19150 as the New York Giants
set a league batting mark of .319.
Only two of his seasons was he be
low the .ti(KJ figure. The bitter, out
spoken Terry was never too popu
lar as a player and then as a mana
ger. but at last, he has received the
credit he deserves.
Joe DiMaggio missed entering
the Hall hy 14 votes. Ted Lyons
and Dazzy Vance, who were great
winning pitchers for poor teams,
also just missed entering the Hall.
Gabby llartnett also received
heavy support. Perhaps the writ
ers are waiting for these men to
die before they are voted in.

and hatted in 107 runs in 112
games, lie hit .313 for his career.
Great Yankee hurlers such as
Lefty Gomez and lied Itu fling
were quick to credit Dickey for
most of their success. He was the
unsung hero of probably the best
Yankee team of all time.
Terry hit .341 in 14 seasons to
rate as eighth of all time. He hit
.401 in 19150 as the New York Giants
set a league batting mark of .319.
Only two of his seasons was he be
low the .ti(KJ figure. The bitter, out
spoken Terry was never too popu

credit he deserves.
Joe DiMaggio missed entering
the Hall hy 14 votes. Ted Lyons
and Dazzy Vance, who were great
winning pitchers for poor teams,
also just missed entering the Hall.
Gabby llartnett also received
heavy support. Perhaps the writ
