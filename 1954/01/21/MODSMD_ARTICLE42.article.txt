Students will have seen only half the Winter One-Acts when the
curtains close on the last act on Feb. 20. The other half is the effort
of backstage workers to produce

the plays.
And it's a mighty effort on a
budget of $300.
Right now the first (or unseen)
half is in progress. Most of the
planning is finished and the "mighty
effort" has started in Memorial Au
ditorium.
The prop crew has pust begun to
find the materials needed to build
sets and the rhythm of saws and the
banging of hammers is echoing
throughout the building.
The lighting crew can be found
working late at night on both physi
cal and esthetic problems—but so
far they have produced little more
than a variety of swear words and
a burned-out light bulb.
The stage manager, one of the ab
solute authorities in all backstage
work, may be seen scratching his
head at stacks of diagrams or
groups of puzzled stage workers.
Sound crew members are busy
learning the details of phonetics
and volume. A sensitive ear will
hear an occasional muffled scream
as sound technicians test their
equipment.
And. costume workers, the neo
phytes of the needle, may be seen
emerging from the costumc room
with remnants from past produc
tion.
