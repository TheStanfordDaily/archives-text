## Tax Break for Parents Of Students Approved 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 (UP) — The House Ways and-Means
Committee voted today to give a tax break to parents with children
in college.
It approved a change in the tax laws under which parents could
claim such children as income tax exemptions even if the stu-

dents earned more than $(>OO a year.
The change was one of 25 recom
mended by President Eisenhower in
his budget message.
The children would continue to
pay taxes on any of their earnings
above $(>OO. Under present law, a
taxpayer cannot claim as a de
pendent anyone earning more
than $600 a year.
The committee, engaged in a gen
eral overhaul of the tax structure,
took the action after rejecting on a
15-to-10 party-line vote a Demo
cratic proposal to increase individ
ual tax exemptions from $600 to
$700.
The committee also:
1. Voted to allow a person, even
though not a relative, to he
claimed as a dependent if he is a
member of the taxpayer's house
hold. The dependent could not
earn more than $600 a year and
the taxpayer would have to sup
ply at least half of his support.
The provision is aimed primarily
at homes with foster children
who have not yet been fully
adopted.
2. Voted to let installment buy
ers deduct six per cent of the un
paid balance of their purchases.
However, interest charges could not
be claimed elsewhere on the tax
form.
3. Approved a provision under
which an employee would not have
to count as income meals and lodg
ing furnished as part of his job—
provided the employee has to atcept
them to hold the job.
4. Approved a provision barring
taxpayers from deducting as busi
ness expense charitable contribu
tions of more than 20 per cent of the
taxpayers' total income. There now
is a similar restriction on corpora
tions.
