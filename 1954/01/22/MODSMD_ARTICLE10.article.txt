# Exams: In or Out of the Classroom?
## Students Give Opinions On Honor Code Plans 
### BARBARA TUERK 
Discussion on the question of taking examinations out of the
classroom at Wednesday night's Executive Committee meeting
centered on several main issues.
Many students who attended the meeting believed that an
answer to the question depended on the relative emphasis placed

on first and third person responsi
bility under the Stanford Honor
Code.
The following are among the
widely divergent opinions expres
sed by Excom members and ob
servers on this point:
Will Oxtoby, junior: "You can't
give a person the right to go in a
little cubicle all by himself, and
still be consistent with the third
person responsibility."
Jim Mitchell, graduate representa
tive to Excom: "The faculty did not
give us first person responsibility
when they gave us the Honor Code.
They gave us the right to administer
discipline in cases where it is nec
essary. They gave us a responsibility
which once was theirs and now is
ours—a responsibility to ensure that
the sheepskin with which we gradu
ate is a testament that we are peo
ple of integrity. We can fulfill this
responsibility only if we use self
restraint during examinations."
David Spencer, senior: "You just
are not on your honor in a foom
where every student is a proctor."
Chuck GofT, chairman of the Fun
damental Standard Committee: "If
the purpose of our Honor Code is
to maintain academic standing, let's
have our student proctor system. If
it's to teach us honor, we have to be
put in a position to choose between
honor and dishonor."
Jancen Knipe, senior: "Education
comes often through social pressure.
If the third person responsibility is
enforced, we're more likely to learn
honesty."
Jean Bobis, ASSU vice president:
"I think there can be a substitute
for social pressure, and that is so
cial thinking. Through better orien
tation of students we can give
everyone an idea of the difficulties
involved in taking exams from the
room."
David Carr, Men's Row represent
ative to Excom: "The Honor Code is
the responsibility of the Stanford
students collectively and not of the
students individually. We need third
person responsibility to preserve that
code. No one can say that taking
away that protection does not in
crease the temptation to cheat."
Pete Barney, senior: "We're all
going to be in situations in life
where there is no third person to
watch us. We have to learn to with
stand temptation. If the third per
son is the core of the Honor Code,
then the code isn't working."
Larry Tarlow, senior: "I think we
need the third person responsibility.
Couldn't we have a rule providing
that people could take exams out of
the room if two of them went to
gether?"
Lada Sobieski, sophomore: "Lots
of us are against the third person
responsibility provision because we
feel we should be raised to be honest
citizens and not Gestapo members
to spy on other students."
Many of the students at the
meeting criticized the recommen
dation made by the special com
mitee which studied the question
last fall. Among their objections to
that plan, which called for leaving
the final decision to departmental
majors, were the following points:
Jim Jennings, graduate student:
"The confusion of 12 or 14 different
programs will leave the individual
confused and not thinking much of
any of them."
Dave Jcnks, freshman representa
tive to Excom: "The primary factor
involved in the Honor Code is edu
cation and character building. This
process cannot differ from class to
class. We need a law that will hold
for the whole University."
