# Exams: In or Out of the Classroom?
## Students Give Opinions On Honor Code Plans 
### BARBARA TUERK 
Discussion on the question of taking examinations out of the
classroom at Wednesday night's Executive Committee meeting
centered on several main issues.
Many students who attended the meeting believed that an
answer to the question depended on the relative emphasis placed

on first and third person responsi
bility under the Stanford Honor
Code.
The following are among the
widely divergent opinions expres
sed by Excom members and ob
servers on this point:
Will Oxtoby, junior: "You can't
give a person the right to go in a
little cubicle all by himself, and
still be consistent with the third
person responsibility."
Jim Mitchell, graduate representa
tive to Excom: "The faculty did not
give us first person responsibility
when they gave us the Honor Code.
They gave us the right to administer
discipline in cases where it is nec
essary. They gave us a responsibility
which once was theirs and now is
ours—a responsibility to ensure that
the sheepskin with which we gradu
ate is a testament that we are peo
ple of integrity. We can fulfill this
responsibility only if we use self
restraint during examinations."
David Spencer, senior: "You just
are not on your honor in a foom
where every student is a proctor."
Chuck GofT, chairman of the Fun
damental Standard Committee: "If
the purpose of our Honor Code is
to maintain academic standing, let's
have our student proctor system. If
it's to teach us honor, we have to be
put in a position to choose between
honor and dishonor."
Jancen Knipe, senior: "Education
comes often through social pressure.
If the third person responsibility is
enforced, we're more likely to learn
honesty."
Jean Bobis, ASSU vice president:
"I think there can be a substitute
for social pressure, and that is so
cial thinking. Through better orien
tation of students we can give
everyone an idea of the difficulties
involved in taking exams from the
room."
David Carr, Men's Row represent
ative to Excom: "The Honor Code is
the responsibility of the Stanford
students collectively and not of the
students individually. We need third
person responsibility to preserve that
code. No one can say that taking
away that protection does not in
crease the temptation to cheat."
Pete Barney, senior: "We're all
going to be in situations in life
where there is no third person to
watch us. We have to learn to with
stand temptation. If the third per
son is the core of the Honor Code,
then the code isn't working."
Larry Tarlow, senior: "I think we
need the third person responsibility.
Couldn't we have a rule providing
that people could take exams out of
the room if two of them went to
gether?"
Lada Sobieski, sophomore: "Lots
of us are against the third person
responsibility provision because we
feel we should be raised to be honest
citizens and not Gestapo members
to spy on other students."
Many of the students at the
meeting criticized the recommen
dation made by the special com
mitee which studied the question
last fall. Among their objections to
that plan, which called for leaving
the final decision to departmental
majors, were the following points:
Jim Jennings, graduate student:
"The confusion of 12 or 14 different
programs will leave the individual
confused and not thinking much of
any of them."
Dave Jcnks, freshman representa
tive to Excom: "The primary factor
involved in the Honor Code is edu
cation and character building. This
process cannot differ from class to
class. We need a law that will hold
for the whole University."
Steve Horn, student manager for
1952-53: "Students don't realize the
departmental politicking that will be
involved in the formulation of any
departmental policy. The plan is just
ridiculous."
Al Brouse, junior: "The Honor
Code has to mean something to peo
ple just coming to Stanford. Put
ting them in a situation where they
don't understand what's going on on
upper levels just isn't right."
John Sprague, sophomore repre
sentative to Excom: "What about
freshmen and sophomores? They'll
be subject to decisions they don't
have any part in making."
Proponents of the plan answered
these criticisms several ways.
Among their answers:
Carol Folsom, former chairman of
Women's Council: "Under this plan
lower division students are encour
aged to go to the departmental meet
ings. Their voice certainly will be
heard."
Dave Carr: "Lower division stu
dents haven't had enough experience j
in any particular department to
understand the special problems in
volved in that department. And we
feel that the viewpoint: of the upper
division students will be representa
tive enough to reflect those of th»>
freshmen and sophomores."
Some students asked about pos
sible adverse reaction from faculty
members if students decide that ex
aminations may be taken out of the
classroom.
Dave Carr: "Most of the faculty
whom we interviewed thought ex
ams should not go out of the rooms.
We have to consider their reaction
to any proposal we pass."
Bill Dickinson, former chairman
of Men's Council: "If we don't main
tain the third person responsibility
we have a different honor system
from the one the Academic Council
entrusted to us in 1921. And the
whole thing might have to go back
to the Academic Council for new
consideration."
Jim Jennings: "Friction with the

faculty is not an issue. Let's not have
student government compromise on
a principle tjiat the majority of stu
dents believe in. The faculty gave us
an Honor Code to administer as we
see fit."
Chuck GofT: ' Maybe the Academic
Council won't like a plan based on
first person responsibility. But let's
be honest about this thing. Let's
find out where we stand once and
for all."
And finally students differed
about whether the entire question
should go to the student body for
a referendum. Among their opin
ions:
Bill Dickinson: "We all know that
students don't think before they vote
at these if they show
up at all."
Chuck Goff: "I'm for a referen
dum. Students make or break the
Honor Code, and if they aren't be
hind whatever decision we make
it'll be disastrous."
Steve Horn: "Excom should take it
on themselves to explain issues to
the students so a valid referendum

could be held."
Janeen Knipe: "Student voting
would be too individualistic. Discus
sions couldn't teach them enough
about the Honor Code so that their
votes would be valid."

of Men's Council: "If we don't main
tain the third person responsibility
we have a different honor system
from the one the Academic Council
entrusted to us in 1921. And the
whole thing might have to go back
to the Academic Council for new
consideration."
Jim Jennings: "Friction with the

faculty is not an issue. Let's not have
student government compromise on
a principle tjiat the majority of stu
dents believe in. The faculty gave us
an Honor Code to administer as we
see fit."
Chuck GofT: ' Maybe the Academic
Council won't like a plan based on
first person responsibility. But let's
be honest about this thing. Let's
find out where we stand once and
for all."
And finally students differed
about whether the entire question
should go to the student body for
a referendum. Among their opin
ions:
Bill Dickinson: "We all know that
students don't think before they vote
at these if they show
up at all."
Chuck Goff: "I'm for a referen
dum. Students make or break the
Honor Code, and if they aren't be
hind whatever decision we make
it'll be disastrous."
Steve Horn: "Excom should take it
on themselves to explain issues to
the students so a valid referendum

could be held."
Janeen Knipe: "Student voting
would be too individualistic. Discus
sions couldn't teach them enough
about the Honor Code so that their
votes would be valid."
Discussion on the question of taking examinations out of the
classroom at Wednesday night's Executive Committee meeting
centered on several main issues.
Many students who attended the meeting believed that an
answer to the question depended on the relative emphasis placed

on first and third person responsi
bility under the Stanford Honor
Code.
The following are among the
widely divergent opinions expres
sed by Excom members and ob
servers on this point:
Will Oxtoby, junior: "You can't
give a person the right to go in a
little cubicle all by himself, and
still be consistent with the third
person responsibility."
Jim Mitchell, graduate representa
tive to Excom: "The faculty did not
give us first person responsibility
when they gave us the Honor Code.
They gave us the right to administer
discipline in cases where it is nec
essary. They gave us a responsibility
which once was theirs and now is
ours—a responsibility to ensure that
the sheepskin with which we gradu
ate is a testament that we are peo
ple of integrity. We can fulfill this
responsibility only if we use self
restraint during examinations."
David Spencer, senior: "You just
are not on your honor in a foom
where every student is a proctor."
Chuck GofT, chairman of the Fun
damental Standard Committee: "If
the purpose of our Honor Code is
to maintain academic standing, let's
have our student proctor system. If
it's to teach us honor, we have to be
put in a position to choose between
honor and dishonor."
Jancen Knipe, senior: "Education
comes often through social pressure.
If the third person responsibility is
enforced, we're more likely to learn
honesty."
Jean Bobis, ASSU vice president:
"I think there can be a substitute
for social pressure, and that is so
cial thinking. Through better orien
tation of students we can give
everyone an idea of the difficulties
involved in taking exams from the
room."
David Carr, Men's Row represent
ative to Excom: "The Honor Code is
the responsibility of the Stanford
students collectively and not of the
students individually. We need third
person responsibility to preserve that
code. No one can say that taking
away that protection does not in
crease the temptation to cheat."
Pete Barney, senior: "We're all
going to be in situations in life
where there is no third person to
watch us. We have to learn to with
stand temptation. If the third per
son is the core of the Honor Code,
then the code isn't working."
Larry Tarlow, senior: "I think we
need the third person responsibility.
Couldn't we have a rule providing
that people could take exams out of
the room if two of them went to
gether?"
Lada Sobieski, sophomore: "Lots
of us are against the third person
responsibility provision because we
feel we should be raised to be honest
citizens and not Gestapo members
to spy on other students."
Many of the students at the
meeting criticized the recommen
dation made by the special com
mitee which studied the question
last fall. Among their objections to
that plan, which called for leaving
the final decision to departmental
majors, were the following points:
Jim Jennings, graduate student:
"The confusion of 12 or 14 different
programs will leave the individual
confused and not thinking much of
any of them."
Dave Jcnks, freshman representa
tive to Excom: "The primary factor
involved in the Honor Code is edu
cation and character building. This
process cannot differ from class to
class. We need a law that will hold
for the whole University."
Steve Horn, student manager for
1952-53: "Students don't realize the
departmental politicking that will be
involved in the formulation of any
departmental policy. The plan is just
ridiculous."
Al Brouse, junior: "The Honor
Code has to mean something to peo
ple just coming to Stanford. Put
ting them in a situation where they
don't understand what's going on on
upper levels just isn't right."
John Sprague, sophomore repre
sentative to Excom: "What about
freshmen and sophomores? They'll
be subject to decisions they don't
have any part in making."
Proponents of the plan answered
these criticisms several ways.
Among their answers:
Carol Folsom, former chairman of
Women's Council: "Under this plan
lower division students are encour
aged to go to the departmental meet
ings. Their voice certainly will be
heard."
Dave Carr: "Lower division stu
dents haven't had enough experience j
in any particular department to
understand the special problems in
volved in that department. And we
feel that the viewpoint: of the upper
division students will be representa
tive enough to reflect those of th»>
freshmen and sophomores."
Some students asked about pos
sible adverse reaction from faculty
members if students decide that ex
aminations may be taken out of the
classroom.
Dave Carr: "Most of the faculty
whom we interviewed thought ex
ams should not go out of the rooms.
We have to consider their reaction
to any proposal we pass."
Bill Dickinson, former chairman
of Men's Council: "If we don't main

departmental politicking that will be
involved in the formulation of any
departmental policy. The plan is just
ridiculous."
Al Brouse, junior: "The Honor
Code has to mean something to peo
ple just coming to Stanford. Put
ting them in a situation where they
don't understand what's going on on
upper levels just isn't right."
John Sprague, sophomore repre
sentative to Excom: "What about
freshmen and sophomores? They'll
be subject to decisions they don't
have any part in making."
Proponents of the plan answered
these criticisms several ways.
Among their answers:
Carol Folsom, former chairman of
Women's Council: "Under this plan
lower division students are encour
aged to go to the departmental meet
ings. Their voice certainly will be
heard."
Dave Carr: "Lower division stu
dents haven't had enough experience j
in any particular department to
understand the special problems in
volved in that department. And we
feel that the viewpoint: of the upper
division students will be representa
tive enough to reflect those of th»>
freshmen and sophomores."
Some students asked about pos
sible adverse reaction from faculty
members if students decide that ex
aminations may be taken out of the
classroom.
Dave Carr: "Most of the faculty
whom we interviewed thought ex
ams should not go out of the rooms.
We have to consider their reaction
to any proposal we pass."
Bill Dickinson, former chairman
of Men's Council: "If we don't main
tain the third person responsibility
we have a different honor system
from the one the Academic Council
entrusted to us in 1921. And the
whole thing might have to go back
to the Academic Council for new
consideration."
Jim Jennings: "Friction with the

faculty is not an issue. Let's not have
student government compromise on
a principle tjiat the majority of stu
dents believe in. The faculty gave us
an Honor Code to administer as we
see fit."
Chuck GofT: ' Maybe the Academic
Council won't like a plan based on
first person responsibility. But let's
be honest about this thing. Let's
find out where we stand once and
for all."
And finally students differed
about whether the entire question
should go to the student body for
a referendum. Among their opin
ions:
Bill Dickinson: "We all know that
students don't think before they vote
at these if they show
up at all."
Chuck Goff: "I'm for a referen
dum. Students make or break the
Honor Code, and if they aren't be
hind whatever decision we make
it'll be disastrous."
Steve Horn: "Excom should take it
on themselves to explain issues to
the students so a valid referendum

could be held."
Janeen Knipe: "Student voting
would be too individualistic. Discus
sions couldn't teach them enough
about the Honor Code so that their
votes would be valid."
Discussion on the question of taking examinations out of the
classroom at Wednesday night's Executive Committee meeting
centered on several main issues.
Many students who attended the meeting believed that an
answer to the question depended on the relative emphasis placed

on first and third person responsi
bility under the Stanford Honor
Code.
The following are among the
widely divergent opinions expres
sed by Excom members and ob
servers on this point:
Will Oxtoby, junior: "You can't
give a person the right to go in a
little cubicle all by himself, and
still be consistent with the third
person responsibility."
Jim Mitchell, graduate representa
tive to Excom: "The faculty did not
give us first person responsibility
when they gave us the Honor Code.
They gave us the right to administer
discipline in cases where it is nec
essary. They gave us a responsibility
which once was theirs and now is
ours—a responsibility to ensure that
the sheepskin with which we gradu
ate is a testament that we are peo
ple of integrity. We can fulfill this
responsibility only if we use self
restraint during examinations."
David Spencer, senior: "You just
are not on your honor in a foom
where every student is a proctor."
Chuck GofT, chairman of the Fun
damental Standard Committee: "If
the purpose of our Honor Code is
to maintain academic standing, let's
have our student proctor system. If
it's to teach us honor, we have to be
put in a position to choose between
honor and dishonor."
Jancen Knipe, senior: "Education
comes often through social pressure.
If the third person responsibility is
enforced, we're more likely to learn
honesty."
Jean Bobis, ASSU vice president:
"I think there can be a substitute
for social pressure, and that is so
cial thinking. Through better orien
tation of students we can give
everyone an idea of the difficulties
involved in taking exams from the
room."
David Carr, Men's Row represent
ative to Excom: "The Honor Code is
the responsibility of the Stanford
students collectively and not of the
students individually. We need third
person responsibility to preserve that
code. No one can say that taking
away that protection does not in
crease the temptation to cheat."
Pete Barney, senior: "We're all
going to be in situations in life
where there is no third person to
watch us. We have to learn to with
stand temptation. If the third per
son is the core of the Honor Code,
then the code isn't working."
Larry Tarlow, senior: "I think we
need the third person responsibility.
Couldn't we have a rule providing
that people could take exams out of
the room if two of them went to
gether?"
Lada Sobieski, sophomore: "Lots
of us are against the third person
responsibility provision because we
feel we should be raised to be honest
citizens and not Gestapo members
to spy on other students."
Many of the students at the
meeting criticized the recommen
dation made by the special com
mitee which studied the question
last fall. Among their objections to
that plan, which called for leaving
the final decision to departmental
majors, were the following points:
Jim Jennings, graduate student:
"The confusion of 12 or 14 different
programs will leave the individual
confused and not thinking much of
any of them."
Dave Jcnks, freshman representa
tive to Excom: "The primary factor
involved in the Honor Code is edu
cation and character building. This
process cannot differ from class to
class. We need a law that will hold
for the whole University."
Steve Horn, student manager for
1952-53: "Students don't realize the
departmental politicking that will be
involved in the formulation of any
