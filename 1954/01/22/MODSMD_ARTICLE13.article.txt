## What Do YOU Think? 
### 
The solution to the current debate over whether, under the
Honor Code, students should be allowed to take their exami
nation papers from a classroom lies in YOUR hands, as stu
dents of this University.
It is YO'UR code. It was given to you to administer and
apply when it was established 33 years ago.
It is YOUR responsibility now to consider and help resolve
the present debate.
That debate has wide ramifications which, possibly,
would touch not only our lives as students here, but also
the lives of those who might enroll decades hence.
The debate raises many vital questions that must be an
swered considerately and thoughtfully if the Code is to be
preserved.
Among these questions are:
Will a prohibition against students taking their examina
tions from a classroom violate and possibly crush the spirit
of the Code?
Is or should the emphasis of the Code be on first person or
third person responsibility?
These questions obviously are not simple. Each sug
gests tangential questions. Each poses particular prob
lems.
But each demand's consideration.
To encourage discussion of these essential questions
and other points linked with the Honor Code debate and
to provide means by which various opinions can be ex
pressed, The Daily urges its readers to make use of the
Letters to the Editor column.
For, we believe, it is only through such letters, joined with
editorials and articles in the newspaper and open discussions
and bull-sessions, that the complexities of the Honor Code
debate can be made clear and opinion marshalled into an
equitable and specific and lasting decision.
What do YOU think? We are waiting to hear.
