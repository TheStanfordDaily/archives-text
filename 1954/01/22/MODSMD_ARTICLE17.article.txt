# Dean Winbigler Favors Honor Code 'Ivey Plan'
## 
### HADLEY ROFF 
The so-called Ivey plan to settle the long-standing question of
whether students should be allowed to take their examination
papers from a classroom was said to "hold real promise" by Dean
of Students H. Donald Winbigler yesterday.
Several times he used the words "promise" and "a lot of possi-

bility" when discussing the plan,
which was conceived by A 1 Ivey ;
Village Representative and pre
sented by him to the Executive
Committee Wednesday evening.
The plan was authored by Ivey
during a break in the lengthy Excom
session as a counter proposal to the
departmental scheme submitted by
Dave Carr, Men's Row Representa
tive, and an Excom sub-committee
which had conducted an investiga
tion of the Honor Code during fall
quarter.
The dean, who said he was not
talking for the faculty but merely
expressing his own opinion, said
he thought the Ivey plan "would
help solve" what he called "the
present dilemma."
That dilemma, he intimated,
evolves from the faculty's desire
for a general rule prohibiting stu
dents from leaving the classroom
with their blue-books and the desire
of students to do so.
The dean, however, confidently
expressed the hope that the plan
might reconcile the desires of both
groups.
The plan—which would allow
students to take their tests from
a classroom unless, in an individ
ual class vote, they should de
cide otherwise—accomodates both
the first person and third person
tenets of the Honor Code, the
dean said.
Third party responsibility, he
thought, could be particularly mani
fested through calling for a class
vote, which, under the plan, may be
done either by a professor or a stu
dent.
Its prose polished somewhat since
its introduction to Excom, the plan
now reads:
"Students shall he allowed to
take examinations out of the ex
amination room. However, where
special circumstances require it
any student or professor may sug
gest to his class that the examina
tion may not be taken from the
examination room.
"The class will then vote on this
proposal. But under no circumstan
ces will the student's right to leave
the examination room without his
examination be impaired."
The dean spotted what he claimed
were several minor difficulties in
the plan, one being the administra
tion of the election. He said they
should be made as simple and di
rect as possible.
The plan, if adopted, would be
the section on the Honor Code in
incorporated as paragraph three in
the by-laws of the Constitution.
It would follow sections which dis
allow giving or receiving aid and
which call for the exercise of third
party responsibility.
Dean Winbigler said he thought
the Ivey plan to be better than the
Carr plan of holding departmental
votes.
The Ivey plan, he said, is more im
mediate and more specific whereas
he considered the other proposal to
be but evolutionary in nature.

It would follow sections which dis
allow giving or receiving aid and
which call for the exercise of third
party responsibility.
Dean Winbigler said he thought
the Ivey plan to be better than the
Carr plan of holding departmental
votes.
The Ivey plan, he said, is more im
mediate and more specific whereas
he considered the other proposal to
be but evolutionary in nature.
The so-called Ivey plan to settle the long-standing question of
whether students should be allowed to take their examination
papers from a classroom was said to "hold real promise" by Dean
of Students H. Donald Winbigler yesterday.
Several times he used the words "promise" and "a lot of possi-

bility" when discussing the plan,
which was conceived by A 1 Ivey ;
Village Representative and pre
sented by him to the Executive
Committee Wednesday evening.
The plan was authored by Ivey
during a break in the lengthy Excom
session as a counter proposal to the
departmental scheme submitted by
Dave Carr, Men's Row Representa
tive, and an Excom sub-committee
which had conducted an investiga
tion of the Honor Code during fall
quarter.
The dean, who said he was not
talking for the faculty but merely
expressing his own opinion, said
he thought the Ivey plan "would
help solve" what he called "the
present dilemma."
That dilemma, he intimated,
evolves from the faculty's desire
for a general rule prohibiting stu
dents from leaving the classroom
with their blue-books and the desire
of students to do so.
The dean, however, confidently
expressed the hope that the plan
might reconcile the desires of both
groups.
The plan—which would allow
students to take their tests from
a classroom unless, in an individ
ual class vote, they should de
cide otherwise—accomodates both
the first person and third person
tenets of the Honor Code, the
dean said.
Third party responsibility, he
thought, could be particularly mani
fested through calling for a class
vote, which, under the plan, may be
done either by a professor or a stu
dent.
Its prose polished somewhat since
its introduction to Excom, the plan
now reads:
"Students shall he allowed to
take examinations out of the ex
amination room. However, where
special circumstances require it
any student or professor may sug
gest to his class that the examina
tion may not be taken from the
examination room.
"The class will then vote on this
proposal. But under no circumstan
ces will the student's right to leave
the examination room without his
examination be impaired."
The dean spotted what he claimed
were several minor difficulties in
the plan, one being the administra
tion of the election. He said they
should be made as simple and di
rect as possible.
The plan, if adopted, would be
the section on the Honor Code in
incorporated as paragraph three in
the by-laws of the Constitution.
It would follow sections which dis
allow giving or receiving aid and
which call for the exercise of third
party responsibility.
