# STAFFORD—TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Off-Campus Men and Women Hear Talk on 'Academic Aims' 
### JIM MORREY 
The Stanford—Today and Tomor
row discussions continued yester
day with an address by Dr. John W.
Dodds, professor of English and di
rector of Stanford's Special Pro
grams in Humanities.
In an informal talk before off
campus men and 'women, Dr. Dodds
discussed the academic aims and
purposes of the University. Con
centrating mainly on the humani
ties program offered at Stanford, he
pointed out that the serious student
has a right to expect something
more from his education than the
group. The present idea is toward
considering a man educated if he
merely accumulates enough units
to graduate. Dr. Dodds said.
This is refuted by the Humani
ties Department program. Dr. Dodds
explained that each of the 65 stu
dents in the Humanities Department
is able to see clearly the relation
ship between his subject of special
ization and other liberal fields such
as history, art, and philosophy.

Stanford is a school where (his
aim ran he realized, he said. The
climax of (he program comes in
the senior year when all the stu
dents arc given a chance to utilize
their liberal arts knowledge in a
senior essay on their field of spe
cialization., At this point the stu
dent finds the seminars lie has at
tended combine with his devel
oped interest in a wide variety of
subjects to make him 9 truly edu
cated man.
Dr. Dodds concluded his talk by
briefly explaining the value and re
sult of the Honors Program. The
individual with a broad liberal arts
training is excellently equipped for
graduate study in any field. The
possible lack of interest in a liberal
arts education comes more from the
students than from private industry.
Testimony from the fields of busi
ness and law show clearly the pref
erence on the part of the employer
for the broadly educated graduate,
rather than for the technical spe
cialist.
