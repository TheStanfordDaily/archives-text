# Court Action on Founding Grant
## 
### 
Stanford trustees yesterday voted to ask court approval to in
crease its membership from 15 to 23, including three who would
be direct representatives of the Alumni..
The plan, since it involves amendment to the University's Found
ing Grant, will not be effective until it is approved by the courts,

it was emphasized by Lloyd W.
Dinkelspiel, president of the board.
The new members would be
elected by the existing board.
The three "alumni trustees"
would be elected from a panel
recommended by the Executive
Board of the Stanford Alunini As
sociation. They would serve five
year terms.
The five other new members
would be elected for ten-year term;
"We have had two purposes in
formulating this plan," Mr. Dinkel
spiel declaired. "One is to give more
direct representation on our board
to our steadily growing alumni body.
The other is to provide the board
with more manpower to handle the
increasing load of work occasioned
by development of the University
lands, fund raising, the decision to
move our Medical School, and other
problems."
Russel V. Lee of Palo Alto, presi
dent of the Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation, reported that the alumni ex
ecutive board supports the alumni
trustee plan.
"I predict this proposal will be
a source of great satisfaction to
alumni as individuals and will
greatly strengthen relations be
tween the Alumni Association and
the University administration,"
Dr. Lee stated.
Eleven of the University's current
trustees are alumni.
