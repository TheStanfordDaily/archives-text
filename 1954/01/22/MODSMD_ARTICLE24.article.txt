# Ex-Card Athlete Sentenced, Fined
## 
### 
Don Carlson, 21-year-old former
Stanford athlete, was sentenced to
six months in the county jail and
received a fine of $50 yesterday by
Judge Alfred W. Bowen in Palo
Alto Municipal court on charges of
petty theft.
Judge Bowen, however, suspended
the jail sentence and placed the ex
basketball forward on probation fox
two years.
The judge asked that Carlson be
given psychiatric treatment and or
dered him to make full restitution
for any and all sums of money he
had stolen.
Carlson pleaded guilty to a com
plaint issued by Stanford police Jan.
7 charging him with the theft of wal
lets and a wristwatch from the En
cina Gym.
Carlson told Judge Bowen he
would try to repay as many of the
persons he could remember whose
wallets he had stolen. The money
he cannot account for, he said, would
be placed in the Stanford student
loan fund.
Carlson has been ordered for in
duction into the Army Jan. 27, but
his attorney explained his induc
tion will be postponed until he L.
released from probation.
