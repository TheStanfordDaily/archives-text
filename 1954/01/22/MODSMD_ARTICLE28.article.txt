# The 						Honor Code
## Summing Up Present Issue: Suggested Plans and Solutions 
### Last of a Series) By BOB REZAK 
When the current issue of the
Honor Code first came to the at
tention of students last summer, the
Executive Committee was fast to
react with plans and solutions to the
question of whether or not students
should be allowed to take examina
tions out of the classroom.
The summer Excom, in a three
hour session, heard Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler explain that
several faculty members reported
increasingly large numbers, of stu-

dents were taking tests out of rooms.
He added that the administration
and faculty are anxious for a clear
cut rule.
The dean himself suggested that
the practice of leaving classrooms
—never fully defined in the Honor
Code—he curtailed and that fac
ulty members giving examinations
be made the final judge of who can
leave class with test papers.
Charles Goff, chairman of the
Fundamental Standard Committee,
recommended that the Honor Code
be amended to give students the un
questioned right to leave class (lur
ing tests. He advocated submitting
the issue to a student body referen
dum last fall.
A compromise plan was also pro
posed by Kay Watson, a representa
tive to summer Excom. That plan
suggested that the faculty establish
auxiliary rooms away from assigned

rooms where students could take
their tests.
And as summer quarter 1953
drew to a close, Excom voted to
recommend to the fall Excom that
the by-laws of the ASSU consti
tution he amended to give stu
dents the undoubted right to leave
examination rooms with their test
papers.
The fall Excom, in its first meet
ing, announced appointment of a
special subcommittee, headed by
Dave Carr, to study the whole Honor
Code-examination issue and make a
full report to Excom at a later date.
Such a report was presented to
Excom Jan. 13 along with a proposed
plan that the committee felt could
help alleviate the confusion and
problems over the Honor Code.
The Carr committee plan provided
that departmental policies be set by
discussions between departmental
staffs and departmental majors.
The committee considered the
"departmental plan" as a "compro
mise between a rigid policy and an
undirected one."
Basically, the committee declared,
the proposed departmental policy is
similar to the program of leaving
the question up to the discretion of
the professor. It differs, however, in
that it gives "greater formalization
and direction, and presents an ef
fective opportunity to hear student
voices."
The "departmental plan" would
work this way:
1. A major student in each de
partment would be selected to
confer with the head of his ma
jor department on adopting a de
partmental policy relating to the
examination question.
2. The maior student and the de
partment head would then confer
and plan a meeting of all faculty
members within the department
where a policy would again be
discussed.
3. Next, ail students within the
major department would be con
tacted and asked to attend a meet
ing of their respective departments
where a proposed departmental
policy would be presented for final
discussion and approval.
Excom voted not to approve this
plan Wednesday night.
If this plan were approved, it
would have meant various depart
ments would have different policies
relating to examinations. And once

such policies were approved, under
the plan, students would have been
expected to abide by them.
The latest plan, proposed by A 1
Ivey, Village representative to Ex
com, provides that the ASSU by
laws be amended to provide that
students "be allowed to take exam
inations out of the examination room.
However, where special circumstan
ces require it, any student or profes
sor may suggest to his class that the

examination shall not he taken from
the examination room."
The plan adds:
"Tjie class will then vote on this
proposal. But under no circum
stances vviil the students' right to
leave the examination room with
out his examination be impaired."
The "Ivey Plan" is still largely in
the thinking stage, having been
formulated during a 10-minute
break in Wednesday's Excom meet
ing by Ivey and Bob Margolis, a
member of Men's Council.
Wednesday's Excom tabled action
on the proposed plan until next
week's meeting.
Most student leaders now seem to
feel that a proper solution to the
whole examination issue will re
quire lots of effort and hard work.
The leaders—if Wednesday night's
Excom meeting was any indication—
seem to he making progress along
these lines and, more important, to
help maintain a cherished tradition
begun 33 years ago: The Honor Code.
