# Farm Props Costly

WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 (UP) â€”
President Eisenhower estimated to
day that government farm price
support losses will increase by more
than $100 million in fiscal 1955, even
if his controversial flexible support
plan is adopted.
He forecast a loss in his new
budget of $487,300,000, compared
with estimated 1954 losses of $326,-
300,000. However, the estimated net
spending on the main support pro
gram would total $1.1 billion, down
$47 million from this year.
The total outlay for farm pro
grams would be about $2,366,000,000,
down about $300 million from fiscal
1954.
The resident said "it is clear" that
Congress should reconsider the
support program "not only in the
interest of farmers, but also in the
national interest."
