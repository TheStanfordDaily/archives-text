# Boxers Drop Cal Poly
## 
### 
By DICK KOENIGSBERGER
The Stanford boxing team
showed a surprising and very
pleasing reversal of form last
night at the Pavilion, as they
defeated Cal Poly 5-3.
The match was not decided until
the last bout. Going into the
heavyweight battle Stanford led
4-3. Then Bob Birkie stepped in
and chased Poly's Jim Herra
around the ring to gain a unani
mous decision and win the match
for Stanford.
The Indian pugilists started on the
comeback trail quickly, after last
week's loss at the hands of Cal.
Stanford was victorious in the first
three bouts of the evening.
In the first fight of the night, and
one of the most exciting, Rocky
Tolley, fighting at 125 pounds, took
a unanimous decision from Poly's
Frank Hernandez.
Then Gary Sievert, giving a
beautiful boxing exhibition, swept
to Stanford's second straight vic
tory of the night. He too was a
unanimous victor.
Fred Dittmer, at 139, made it three
in a row, winning a split decision
from Alex PonovarofT.
Stanford had to forfeit the 147 lb.
division, but after the intermission,
Eric Hansen, at 156, made it 4-1
for Stanford by scoring a TKO' over
Bob Crolly in what was probably the
evening's most one-sided bout.
One hundred sixty-five pounder
Judd Morse of Poly then slammed
out a three round decision over
Doug Stocks. It was a close fight,
but Morse held a slight upper hand
all the way.
Len Doster, a newcomer to
Stanford boxing, gave it quite a
whirl before succumbing to Poly's
more experienced Ted Trumpeter
by a TKO at the end of the sec
ond round. Len was cut around
tbe eyes and was unable to con
tinue.
Then came Birkie, and in a match
which saw Poly's Herra not even
stop for breath in his'backward flight,
big Robert took an easy three round
decision.
It was a very satisfying evening
for the boxers and Coach Ray
Lunny. They are eagerly looking
forward to their rematch with Cal
a few weeks hence on home grounds.


ADVICE FROM POP--Bob Birkie, Stanford's undefeated heavy
weight boxer, is shown above receiving some fistic tips from
his father, Hans Birkie. The elder Birkie was a top-ranking
heavyweight in the 19305, and holds a decision over Jim Brad
dock, former champion. Bob won by a decision oved Cal Poly's
Jim Herra in last night's matches.
