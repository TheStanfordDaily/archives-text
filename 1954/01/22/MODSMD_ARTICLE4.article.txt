WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 (UP) â€”
The Marine Corps tonight announced
that 23 Marines are dead or missing
after a ship collision in Korea's In
chon harbor early today.
Five were listed as dead, 18 as
missing. A Marine Corps spokesman
said lie could not account for the
difference between the total of 23
announced here and the figure of 28
reported from Inchon.
It was the second worst naval dis
aster since the start of the Korean
war, exceeded only by the accidental
death of 30 men in a gun-turret ex
plosion on the USS St. Paul off the
east coast of North Korea on April
21, 1952.
