### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 (UP)â€”
Secretary of State John Foster Dul
les flew to Berlin today with a warn
ing that the Big Four foreign Minis
ters conference may decide the vital
issue of war or peace in Europe.
Reports from East Berlin indi
cated the Russians may try to side
track the meeting from the main is
sue of Germany and Austria to the
possible recognition of Communist
China.
A 12-man Red Chinese delegation
was reported to have arrived in East
Berlin. Soviet sources said it was on
hand to "observe the Big Four meet
ing, to which the Chinese Reds were
not invited."
Dulles said before taking off that
he was "not familiar" with the re
ports. This country insists the Chi
nese Communists have no place at
the meeting and that priority must
be given to German unification and
freedom for Austria.
Dulles said the Berlin meeting,
scheduled to start Monday, will "go
far" to indicate Europe's fate.
Dulles will confer in Berlin to
morrow with British Foreign Secre
tary Anthony Eden and French For
eign Minister Georges Bidault to
chart strategy in the talks.
