# Hemingway Feared Dead In Air Crash

### 
KAMPALA, Uganda. Jan. 24
(UP) —Ernest Hemingway, gen
erally rated the greatest of con
temporary American writers,

was feared today to have been
killed in the crash of a small
plane yesterday on the banks of
the Nile in the East African
jungle.
The wreckage was spotted from
the air in a lush tropical area teem
ing with wild animals and inacces- j
siblc by ground. The pilot of the
search plane reported he saw "no
sign of life."
The crash site was some three
miles south of the magnificent Mur
chison Falls, a 400-foot mountain
waterfall of the Nile. Hemingway
had been on safari in the jungle
with his fourth wife, Mary, and they
were reported to have taken the
plane trip to see the falls.
The wreckage was spotted about
400 miles northwest of the snowy
peak of Kilimanjaro, which the 55-
year-old novelist immortalized.
Their plane failed to make a
scheduled fuel stop yesterday at
Masindi, and authorities ordered a
search.
A British Overseas Airways Cor
poration passenger plane left its
route to hunt the small Cessna and
reported it saw the wreckage on the
banks of the river Nile. The pilot
radiQed there was no evidence of
survivors.
Even had the occupants of the
plane survived the crash, it was
doubtful they could make their
way to civilization, hut police of
this British protectorate dis
patched a launch up river from
Kutiaha Shores on Lake Victoria,
a settlement nearly 100 miles from
the falls, on the long-shot chance
of a rescue.
The area is a place of matted jun
gles where many natives have never
seen a white man and where the
mighty animals of the jungle reign
supreme.
Hemingway was touring Africa
on writing assignment for Look
magazine. He left New York last
fall accompanied hy his wife and
a magazine photographer. It was
not known who else was aboard
the plane besides the Heming
ways.
The author's first article on the
trip appeared Jan. 12 in Look, an
animal travelogue dealing with big
game hunting in the area he made
famous 20 years ago with his diary
novel "The Green Hills of Africa"
and the short story "The Snows of
Kilimanjaro."
Hemingway won the Pulitzer
Prize for one of his late novels, "Old
Man and the Sea," but two of his
earlier novels were probably better
known—"For Whom the Bell Tolls"
and his first success, "A Farewell
to Arms." His style set a pattern
for a whole generation of writers.
Africa had played a big part in
Hemingway's life. One of his great
passions was big game hunting and
he made dangerous expeditions to
the Dark Continent. During the
past months he has been flying and
trekking through the jungles he
loved so well.
Hemingway, a heavyweight, six
footer with a heavy grey beard, was
injured in italy during the first
World War and when it ended he
became one of the most famous ex
patriates to settle down on Paris'
Left Bank.

Hemingway was touring Africa
on writing assignment for Look
magazine. He left New York last
fall accompanied hy his wife and
a magazine photographer. It was
not known who else was aboard
the plane besides the Heming
ways.
The author's first article on the
trip appeared Jan. 12 in Look, an
animal travelogue dealing with big
game hunting in the area he made
famous 20 years ago with his diary
novel "The Green Hills of Africa"
and the short story "The Snows of
Kilimanjaro."
Hemingway won the Pulitzer
Prize for one of his late novels, "Old
Man and the Sea," but two of his
earlier novels were probably better
known—"For Whom the Bell Tolls"
and his first success, "A Farewell
to Arms." His style set a pattern
for a whole generation of writers.
Africa had played a big part in
Hemingway's life. One of his great
passions was big game hunting and
he made dangerous expeditions to
the Dark Continent. During the
past months he has been flying and
trekking through the jungles he
loved so well.
Hemingway, a heavyweight, six
footer with a heavy grey beard, was
injured in italy during the first
World War and when it ended he
became one of the most famous ex
patriates to settle down on Paris'
Left Bank.
KAMPALA, Uganda. Jan. 24
(UP) —Ernest Hemingway, gen
erally rated the greatest of con
temporary American writers,

was feared today to have been
killed in the crash of a small
plane yesterday on the banks of
the Nile in the East African
jungle.
The wreckage was spotted from
the air in a lush tropical area teem
ing with wild animals and inacces- j
siblc by ground. The pilot of the
search plane reported he saw "no
sign of life."
The crash site was some three
miles south of the magnificent Mur
chison Falls, a 400-foot mountain
waterfall of the Nile. Hemingway
had been on safari in the jungle
with his fourth wife, Mary, and they
were reported to have taken the
plane trip to see the falls.
The wreckage was spotted about
400 miles northwest of the snowy
peak of Kilimanjaro, which the 55-
year-old novelist immortalized.
Their plane failed to make a
scheduled fuel stop yesterday at
Masindi, and authorities ordered a
search.
