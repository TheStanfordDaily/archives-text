# Faculty Views on Ivey Plan Appear in Daily

posal for leaving the decision as

should leave the classroom up to
class vote—was first brought up
at last week's Executive Commit
tee meeting with no opportunity
for prior faculty consideration,
The Daily has since interviewed
heads of University departments.
The series begins today on
page 2.
