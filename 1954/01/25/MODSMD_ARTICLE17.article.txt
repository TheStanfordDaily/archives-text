BERLIN, Jan. 24 (UP)â€”Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to
day scheduled a session with V. M. Molotov of Russia just before

and get it off to a flying start.
For the first time in five years the foreign ministers of the

United States, Britain, France,
and Russia will meet tomorrow
at 3 p.m. (6 a.m. PST) in the
American sector of West Berlin.
Dulles and Molotov will meet, at
the Allied Control Authority build
ing in West Berlin, site of the
conference for its first week, just
before the full dress meeting opon
It will be the first meeting of U.S.
and Soviet foreign ministers since
1949.
Acting as spokesman for the
West, Dulles will discuss with
Molotov such procedural items as
who will be first chairman, how
the chair will rotate among the
four, and whether to have con
secutive or simultaneous transla
tion.
Dulles will propose that Bidault.
be the first chairman, and that he
serve for the first week. After that
Molotov would have the chair in
the second week of sessions at the
Soviet embassy in East Berlin.

President Eisenhower's proposals
for American - Soviet atomic talk
Preliminary contact on the subject
already has been made in Wash
ington.
In an East-West atmosphere as
chill as the wind whistling in from
N the Russian steppes, the Western
powers polished off their strategy
for the conference today with a
lOft-minute session.
Authoritative Western sources re
ported that Dulles, Georges Bidaull
of Fiance, and Anthony Eden of
Britain decided:
1. France will take the lead in
presenting the Western viewpoint
to the Soviets to promote the unity
between Germany and France.
2. No time limit should be set on
the conference, but it should bo
ended as soon as possible.
3. The West stands ready to con
sider any genuine Soviet proposal
for German unity, Austrian sover
eignty, or any other problem.
4. There can be no question of
having a five-power meeting with
Communist China unless it is on
some specific problem such as Indo
cina.
5. The West should not make any
new offer of security guarantees to
Russia until it sees what Molotov
may have up his sleeve.
