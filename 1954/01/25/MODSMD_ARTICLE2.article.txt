seph Szkjcti gave a stirring recital of great violin playing before
a capacity audience in Memorial Auditorium Saturday night.
Mr. Szigeti is not a flashy and dazzling virtuoso; the under
standing and loving care he bestows upon a composition offers

much more to ihe listener than*'
the usual displays of pyrotech
nics to which v/e have become
accustomed. The Ravel Sonata with
which lie opened (lie program is a
case in point. This bit of Gershwin
csque rhythm and Gallic wit re
quires the interpretative genius of a
Szigeti to perform it successfully;
this lacking, the Sonata could very
well become vapid and uninterest
ing. Szigeti certainly captured all
the zest, rhythm, and wit which
Kavel poured into the score. The
only pitfall for Szigeti was his oc
casion.illy faulty intonation; this is
especially noticable when he allows
the pitch to waver on half- or
whole-notes.
One of Szigeti's fortes is playing
unaccompanied works. The D ma
jor Sonata in this form by Prokofieff
provided Szigeti with a vehicle to
demonstrate hi mastery in this field
of violin playing. The Sonata fol
lows the party line: it is tuneful,
easy to understand.
Turning to the Beethoven "Spring" I
Sonata, Szigeti demonstrated his
versatility in handling the classics
as well as the moderns. Although his
tone and intonation left something to
be desired. S/i eti nevertheless pro
jected to the audience the warmth
and lis.'ht-hi irtedness of this youth
ful work. The sweet songfulnfcss of
the opening movement, and the pro
fundity of the second and fourth
movement: were brilliantly explored
by the performer and his excellent
accompanist. Carlo Busotti.
The performance of the Bach Par
tita in I) minor would exhaust the
eomplelt \(i abulary of superlatives.
Not only '!<>l S/.igeti have a mag
nificent conception of how it should
be performed, but also his tone was I
.so beautiful that it made one won
der if he had switched violins.
