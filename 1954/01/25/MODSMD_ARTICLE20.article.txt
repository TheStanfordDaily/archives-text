# CAMPUS OPINION
## Against Ivey Plan 
### 
To the Editor:
You request student opinion on the question of
taking exams from cla: ■ looms. 1 am generally against
it. The principle from which one ought to start is
often phrased: People are no damn good. To facilitate
practically undetectable cheating is, taking human
nature for what it'; worth, to invite cheating, and
my observation has been that this invitation has
not gone unaccepted.
With reference to the Ivey plan, think a bit of the
"social pressures" (112 w i h you'd ask this Bobis per
son to explain her comments; I can't figure out
whether she's for or against it; involved in a class
election of this type. Many people will feel they
have to vote "liberally," li this plan is adopted, it
will only work with a secret ballot. My personal
suggestion would lie an Ivy plan in reverse.

Establish the presumption that examinations
shouldn't lie taken from the classroom—this is,
after all, common procedure—and allow individual
classes, with the permission of their teacher—
to vote on individual cases. There may often be
gnotl reasons for taking exams out—and when
there are, it will he possible to do so. Ordinarily
there are not, and so the norm would embody the
general practice. This seems to me to partake more
of a privilege than a right.
Actually, I don't care much what you do, but will
send these thoughts along anyway for what they are
worth, 112 do strongly suggest that you bear in mind
that it's people you're working with. People always
act like people.
