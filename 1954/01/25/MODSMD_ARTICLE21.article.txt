# Emphasize First Person
## 
### 
Friday's Honor Code opinion story include?? the
view that you cun't give a person the right !o go
into a little cubicle by bimsdl and still be consistent
with third-person responsibility. This was mistakenly
attributed to me; rny only remark during Excom's
discussion was in partial clarification and support of
A 1 Ivey's proposal, : !n< â€¢ nicknamed the Ivey plan.

This view mentioned is not in itself erroneous,
but the obvious question to ask is: Is the Honor
Code basically dependent on third-person responsi
bility? I must agree wilh Chuck Golf's statement of
last Wednesday that the Honor Code must be based
on the lirst person or be little more than a student
proctoring system. WILL OXTOBY
