John W. Dodds: "Successful op
eration of the Honor Code depends
upon the willingness of the students
to see that violations of the Code
are punished. Unless the students
are willing to abdicate all sense of
responsibility in this regard it
would seem logical that they should
institute' a rule against students
leaving the room to take examina
tions.
"Moreover, students are in part
weak human beings and it would
be better not to throw tempta
tion too directly into their laps.
"If it seems desirable not to have
uniformity of procedure, it seems to
me that it would be better to have
each class polled automatically—as
each examination. If
this sort of polling was not done as
a matter of course, it would raise
peculiar and delicate problems each
time the poll was resorted to."
