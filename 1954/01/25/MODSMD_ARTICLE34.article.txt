James T. Wat kins IV: "The Honor
Code originally meant that the fac
ulty trusted the students. It did not
mean that every sudent must trust
every other student. The new pro
posal is unrealistic. If I were a stu
dent with my grade dependent on a
class average I would object to see
ing other students getting up and
leaving the classroom during exam
inations."
