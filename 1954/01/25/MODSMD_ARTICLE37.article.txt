# Cards Sweep Pair On Selleck's Tosses
## 
### DON STEVENS 
George Selleck's nine free throws in the final four minutes
enabled a hard-pressed Stanford five to defeat determined San
Jose State, 60-58, Saturday in the Pavilion.
In a game that was as loose as the Spartan game was tight, the
Indians hpahazardly whipped an unconditioned Athens Club of

Oakland, 81-58, Friday night as
every varsity man scored.
In Saturday's contest, it seemed
that the Spartans couldn't stop foul
ing Selleck and that Selleck couldn't
help making the free throws, most
of which came in the final four min
utes when every foul is worth two
shots.
The first half of the San Jose tilt
had all the ear marks of Friday's
contest, with the Spartans not being
able to hit from the floor and the
Cards fast breaking and rebounding.
The half was completely dominated
by the Indians who left the floor
with a 31-22 lead.
With Bob BondanZa, a junior
transfer from City College of San
Francisco, hitting for four straight
field goals at the outset of the sec
ond half, the Spartans closed the gap
to 48-44 as the third stanza ended.
San Jose took its first lead, 51-50,
moments later on a tip by center
Don Fausset. From that point the
lead changed hands, but the over
anxious Spartans kept fouling Sel
leck, trying to stop his garne-stall
ing antics.
The fouling cost San Jose the
services of Bondanza and Carroll
Williams on live personals in addi
tion to the nine vital free throws,
out of 11 tries, by Selleck.
The Athens contest Friday night
was just a matter of a well-condi
tioned, sharpshooting team defeat
ing a squad of unconditioned collegi
ate stars who play together only
about twice a week.

The first half of the San Jose tilt
had all the ear marks of Friday's
contest, with the Spartans not being
able to hit from the floor and the
Cards fast breaking and rebounding.
The half was completely dominated
by the Indians who left the floor
with a 31-22 lead.
With Bob BondanZa, a junior
transfer from City College of San
Francisco, hitting for four straight
field goals at the outset of the sec
ond half, the Spartans closed the gap
to 48-44 as the third stanza ended.
San Jose took its first lead, 51-50,
moments later on a tip by center
Don Fausset. From that point the
lead changed hands, but the over
anxious Spartans kept fouling Sel
leck, trying to stop his garne-stall
ing antics.
The fouling cost San Jose the
services of Bondanza and Carroll
Williams on live personals in addi
tion to the nine vital free throws,
out of 11 tries, by Selleck.
The Athens contest Friday night
was just a matter of a well-condi
tioned, sharpshooting team defeat
ing a squad of unconditioned collegi
ate stars who play together only
about twice a week.

George Selleck's nine free throws in the final four minutes
enabled a hard-pressed Stanford five to defeat determined San
Jose State, 60-58, Saturday in the Pavilion.
In a game that was as loose as the Spartan game was tight, the
Indians hpahazardly whipped an unconditioned Athens Club of

Oakland, 81-58, Friday night as
every varsity man scored.
In Saturday's contest, it seemed
that the Spartans couldn't stop foul
ing Selleck and that Selleck couldn't
help making the free throws, most
of which came in the final four min
utes when every foul is worth two
shots.
