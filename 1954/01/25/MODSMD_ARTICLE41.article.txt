## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Stanford's Braves added a pair of
lackluster victories to their record
as they topped the Dinah's Shack
squad, 76-64, and the San Jose State
junior varsity, 58-55, over the
weekend.
Both games were fairly close, but
the Braves appeared to be well off
their best form in the games, look
ing really good only in flashes.
Friday night Dinah's Shack took
an early lead as it outplayed the j
Brave starters. The Braves' sec- j
ond team showed up well in the
last of the initial period, hut Di
nah's held nil for a 15-12 lead at
the close of the quarter.
During the second canto the lead
changed hands with practically »tiv
ery point as a rough and tumble
contest developed.
Stanford utilized a full-court
press at times to hold down Dinah's
attack.
The Braves managed a one-point
edge, 50-49, at the end of the third
quarter, then Dinah's five tired and
faded in the fourth stanza as Stan
ford gradually eased to its winning
margin.
Aggressive little Boh Milton
and lanky Paul Perko, the deadly
hook-shot artist, were high for

the Braves with 17 points each.
Dick Carver of Dinah's paced the
game's scoring with 17 markers.
In the San Jose game, the lead
bounced hack and forth through
out the lirst half before the Braves
took a 31-29 advantage into the
locker room at the intermission.
San Jose fell behind, 50-41, going J
into the final period, but the Spar- |
tans came driving back, at one time j
sinking four straight from the floor, j
But the Braves made three points j
stand up at the final buzzer.

Bob McGralh and Dave Dunn
shared Brave scoring honors against
San Jose State, tossing in 10 points
each.
