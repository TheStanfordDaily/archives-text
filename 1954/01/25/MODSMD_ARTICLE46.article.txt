EATING CLUB BUILDING—which was dedicated on Big Game Day, Novermber 1951, contains
the seven Stanford clubs and a central lounge used by all the clubs. Each club unit comprises
dining room, kitchen, and living quarters for a cook. The club building is located just north of
Toyori Hall.
Stanford's seven eating clubs
submitted lists of new members
yesterday as the regular winter
quarter formal rushing session
came to a close. Club spokes
men emphasized, however, that
club rushing is continuing and
will continue on a year-around
basis.
Interclub Council president Buzz
Feinberg expressed himself as
"quite pleased" with the club rush
ing activities this year. "We've
been unhurried and I rthink all the
clubs have got good new men."
The clubs were permitted unlim
ited social contact with freshman
men from the end of autumn quar
ter on this year. Most clubs have
already held their pledge ban
quets, hut room for more new mem
bers remains in all the clubs, Fein
berg indicated.
