# Power Fails, Dorms Dark
## 
### 
A •short circuit "somewhere in
the line" caused a cutout located
in the northwest corner of the
Toyon parking lot to blow out at
11:38 p.m. Sunday, plunging parts
of Toyon, Branncr, the Eating
Club Building, and the Encina
Pools into temporary darkness.
Service was restored at about
10..'5il yesterday morning. During
the time of the failure and re
placement of service, electricity
was elusive in that area. Resi
dents of the dorms reported that
their ceiling lights remained on
while the outlets went dead. Elec
tric alarm clocks that failed to
w»rn their owners of 8 o'clocks
were commonplace.
