# Allies, Reds May Resume Peace Talks
## 
### 
PANMUNIOM, Tuesday, Jan.
26 (UP) —Allied and Communist
diplomatic officers met today for
the first time since last Wednes
day to seek resumption of pre
liminary negotiations for a Kor-1
ean peace conference.
Most United Nations diplomats j
and officers believed the deadlock !
here would be broken only in Berlin
where Russian Foreign Minister V.
M. Molotov today set the admission
of Red China to a five-power con
ference as the price of a Korean
peace settlement.
The negotiators were tied in a
double deadlock. The first to be
cleared was the United Nations de
mand that the Reds retract their
"perfidy" charges against the United
States before the preliminary talks
resume.
U.S. special envoy Arthur 11.
Dean broke off the preliminary
• talks last Dec. 12 over the "per
fidy" issue while the two sides
were stalemated on the lied insist
ence that Russia be seated at the
peace confrence as a neutral.
Some observers here felt the
chances to resume the preliminary
talks had improved with the easing
of the war prisoner crisis.
Meanwhile, U.N. diplomats said
they believed the Reds intended to
keep 21 unrepatriated American
POWs in the neutral zone until the
fulj peace conference has decided
their fate.
But Indian sources predicted the
pro-Red "men without a country"
would give up their lonely vigil
within two weeks. These sources
said the Allied POWs probably
would desert their compound as
soon as Indian troops pull out of
Korea around Feb. 1.
