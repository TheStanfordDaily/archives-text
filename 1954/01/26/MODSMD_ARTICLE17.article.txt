# BRICKER PROPOSAL
## Ike Urges Its Defeat 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (UP) -
President Eisenhower openly called
for defeat of the "Bricker amend
ment" today on grounds it would
cripple Allied defense plans and
"impair" hopes for peace, including
his famous atom-sharing plan.
His strong stand, contained in a
letter to Senate Republican Leader
William F. Knowland, signaled the
start of a bitter fight between the
administration and a Senate faction
led by Sen. John W. Bricker (R., O.)
which is seeking to curb Presiden
tial treaty powers.
Knowland said efforts to reach a
compromise will continue. Brick
er said the President was "mis
led," however, and declared lie in
tends to fight for his amendment
in its present form.
If no compromise is reached,
Knowland said a substitute propo
sal probably will be introduced with
both Republican and Democratic
backing.
Some Democrats have been hop
ing the chicf executive would take
a firm public stand so they can sup
port him without political risk —
since there is powerful voter sup
port for the Bricker amendment.
These Democrats presumably will
support a watered-down proposal
stating that treaties may not super
sede the U.S. Constitution.
Knowland said the Senate prob
ably will begin debate on the issue
Wednesday, instead of tomorrow as
originally planned.
The President, who has hereto
i fore held out hopes of some com
: promise with Bricker, said in his
j letter to Knowland he is "unal-
J tcrahly opposed" to the amend
ment in its present form.
"It would so restrict the conduct
of foreign affairs that our country
could not negotiate the agreements
necessary for the handling of our
business with the rest of the world,"
he said. »
