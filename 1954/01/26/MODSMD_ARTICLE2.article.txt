# Grid Tilt Set For Stockton
## 
### 
The Stanford-COP football game
this year will be played in Stock
ton.
,Official announcement of the site
choice will be made this morning,
The Daily learned yesterday.
Though it has been the school's
policy not t Â» play local independent
schools away from home, the deci
sion to play at Stockton Memorial
Stadium was made for two reasons:
less local gridiron competition and
larger gate receipts.
California i:> scheduled to play
Oklahoma in one of the nation's top
games at Berkeley that same after
noon, Sept. 18. It. was feared that
attendance at Stanford Stadium
would be mall, while a game such
as this played in Stockton would
draw a larger crowd, especially
since the Tiger defeated Stanford
last season, 2. r >-20.
Besides an increased attendance,
the ticket price scale at COP is
somewhat higher than at Stanford,
which wiii also bring an increase in
revenue (Stanford students will be
admitted free, though).
The Stockton game will be at
night, which will allow really am
bitious gridiron fans to view the
Bear-Sooner contest and then travel
! to the Indian game.
Stanford coaches have expressed
| satisfaction with playing the game
under the lights, for it will be good
practice for the following _week
when the Cards travel north to face
a strong Oregon eleven at night.
Despite playing at Stockton, this
season's football schedule is a good
one for,local fans. Besides the Tiger
and Oregon games, the only other
visiting tilts are with UCLA in Los
Angeles and Cal in Berkeley. Three
big games will be played at Stanford
against Illinois, Navy, and USC.
