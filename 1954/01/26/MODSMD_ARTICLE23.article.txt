# Russia Offers to End Korea talks Deadlock
## Proposal Hinges on West Meet With Red China 
### 
BERLIN, Jan. 25 (UP)—Russia offered today at the opening of
the Big Four conference to end the deadlock in Korean peace ne
gotiations if the West would admit Red China to a five-power
conference.
Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov warned at the same time that

►unless the European army plan i.-
scrapped, the Soviets might organ
ize a similar Eastern bloc.
Molotov's tough and generally un
compromising statement v. • '
| ded with demands that ouH
| the wrecking of the Western tie
| fense setup and the abandonment o.
j far-flung U.S. bases.

Secretary of State John Fostf
Dulles declined Molotov's invitation
to reply at once. He said the speech
included several new points and at
tacks on U.S. policy, and he wo. i
"prefer to sleep on it" until tomor
row.
Molotov put a meeting with
China at the top of his propo .-d
agenda for the present confer
ence. Germany, including Euro
pean security, and an Austrian
treaty were his second and third
points.
The West countered with its own
peace program. It was based on the
unification of Germany after all-
German elections, g u arantec
against anti-Soviet aggression, and
President Eisenhower's atomic pool
plan.
Eden offered the Soviets addition
al securities if they still felt un
easy over Western defense alliance •
—the European Defense Community
and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Bidault forthrightly endorsed
ZDC—the framework for the Eif -
pean army—and appealed to Mclo
tov to fall in with Mr. Eisenho
atoms-for-peace plan.
In drumfire order Molotov un
reeled the following demands
when his turn came to make an

opening statement:
1. Scrapping of EDC and U.S.
bases under threat that the Com
munist bloc might retaliate by
forming an Eastern defense setup.
2. Recognition of Red Chirm and
admission to the United Nations:
with a warning that until then a
Far Eastern peace settlement i - im
possible—and the implicit offer to
get on with the Korean peace nego
tiations when Red China is recog
nized by the West.
3. Calling of a Big Five confer
ence with China after the pre: ent
Berlin meeting.
4. Banning of atomic and hydro
gen weapons.
5. Dropping of plans for We~t
German rearmament within
EDC, failing which the reunifica
tion of Germany would be impos
sible and the chances of a new war
would be increased.
He proposed a solution of the
German problem on the basis of Al
lied wartime agreements. The uni
fication of Germany, he said, "is in
dissolubly bound up with whether
•it is going to be a peaceful oi an
aggressive Germany."
The Western speakers empha
sized that free all-German elec
tions must be the first step to
ward a German peace settlement.
The Russians insist on formation
of an all-German government be
fore elections.
"The peace treaty," Eden told
Molotov, "should be negotiated with
a representative all - German gov
ernment which must have the
right of all free democratic n
to associate with other nations for
peaceful purposes.
"A peace treaty drafted by the
four powers and imposed upon Ger
many would be entirely unsuitable
nine years after the end of hostili
ties. That is why we insist on free
elections as the esssential first btep."

Secretary of State John Fostf
Dulles declined Molotov's invitation
to reply at once. He said the speech
included several new points and at
tacks on U.S. policy, and he wo. i
"prefer to sleep on it" until tomor
row.
Molotov put a meeting with
China at the top of his propo .-d
agenda for the present confer
ence. Germany, including Euro
pean security, and an Austrian
treaty were his second and third
points.
The West countered with its own
peace program. It was based on the
unification of Germany after all-
German elections, g u arantec
against anti-Soviet aggression, and
President Eisenhower's atomic pool
plan.
Eden offered the Soviets addition
al securities if they still felt un
easy over Western defense alliance •
—the European Defense Community
and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Bidault forthrightly endorsed
ZDC—the framework for the Eif -
pean army—and appealed to Mclo
tov to fall in with Mr. Eisenho
atoms-for-peace plan.
In drumfire order Molotov un
reeled the following demands
when his turn came to make an

opening statement:
1. Scrapping of EDC and U.S.
bases under threat that the Com
munist bloc might retaliate by
forming an Eastern defense setup.
2. Recognition of Red Chirm and
admission to the United Nations:
with a warning that until then a
Far Eastern peace settlement i - im
possible—and the implicit offer to
get on with the Korean peace nego
tiations when Red China is recog
nized by the West.
3. Calling of a Big Five confer
ence with China after the pre: ent
Berlin meeting.
4. Banning of atomic and hydro
gen weapons.
5. Dropping of plans for We~t
German rearmament within
EDC, failing which the reunifica
tion of Germany would be impos
sible and the chances of a new war
would be increased.
He proposed a solution of the
German problem on the basis of Al
lied wartime agreements. The uni
fication of Germany, he said, "is in
dissolubly bound up with whether
•it is going to be a peaceful oi an
aggressive Germany."
The Western speakers empha
sized that free all-German elec
tions must be the first step to
ward a German peace settlement.
The Russians insist on formation
of an all-German government be
fore elections.
"The peace treaty," Eden told
Molotov, "should be negotiated with
a representative all - German gov
ernment which must have the
right of all free democratic n
to associate with other nations for
peaceful purposes.
"A peace treaty drafted by the
four powers and imposed upon Ger
many would be entirely unsuitable
nine years after the end of hostili
ties. That is why we insist on free
elections as the esssential first btep."
BERLIN, Jan. 25 (UP)—Russia offered today at the opening of
the Big Four conference to end the deadlock in Korean peace ne
gotiations if the West would admit Red China to a five-power
conference.
Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov warned at the same time that

scrapped, the Soviets might organ
ize a similar Eastern bloc.
