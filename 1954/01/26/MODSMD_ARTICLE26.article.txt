## A 						Modest Proposal 
### 
To the Editor:
Herein follows a modest proposal designed to recti
fy the existing condition at Stanford; in other words,
to abolish the police state.
Despite the ridiculous nature of the furor that has
arisen over the Honor Code, there are so many stu
dents apparently wholly misdirected I feel an intel
ligent appraisal of the question is in order.
F'irst let us look at the possible solutions:
1. We can enforce third person responsibility;
2. We can drop third person responsibility;
3. We can drop the Honor Code.
After an exhaustive examination of these proposals,
it is immediately apparent that proposal one is an
outlandish effrontery to our perfect Code, our per
fect school, and all we perfect individuals in the
school. Let us examine this dastardly proposal. The
Honor Code is, by its very nature, based on personal
honor. The honor of our fellow students is not in the
most remote sense our concern. What care we if he
cheats, ( renting an effrontery to the Code and the
society. What concern of ours is it that he upsets the
position of each individual in the grade curve, if I
may be so mundane? Finally, what concern of ours is
it that he denies himself the benefits of the Code—
those being the building of personal integrity and the
strengthening of character.
No, indeed, it is in no sense our responsibility
to guard our weaker fellows. Of what importance
is our signature in the registration book or on the
blue book pledge by which we promise to exercise
our third person responsibility. Our only concern is
with our personal integrity. It is obvious—indeed,
if is manifest that our signature should, and does
mean nothing.
Neither is plan three a solution. Drop the Code?
Why, that would be to question the unblemished

integrity of the average Stanford student. A proctor
system? What an outrage! Tluit implies that he is
subject to temptation—like any other human being.
Plan two is the only solution which fits our perfect
society. We must rise to demand that the effrontery
to our self-respect, created by third person responsi
bility be abolished. The scandalous existence of the
idea of third person responsibility precludes that
members of our society could possibly stoop to mis
representation of their academic work. Third person
responsibility must go!
However, the problem does not end here. We
must dictate to the doubting faculty that they shall
recognize that to which they have so long closed
their eyes —the spotlessness of our honor. Not only
do these men doubt us, but they enforce third person
responsibility.
Last quarter alone, the faculty submitted to the
Council for Student Control 100 per cent of all cases
suspected of cheating which appeared. Further,
one professor had the nerve to poll his class near
the end of last quarter to ascertain how many stu
dents had cheated in that class during the quarter.
The gall of this man to perpetrate this injustice
upon his students must not go without reprimand.
(The results of the poll—that If) per cent of the
class had cheated by their own admission in (he
course in the space of a quarter—does not interest
us here.)
There seems to be but one solution then. We must
get rid of third person responsibility on the student's
level and on the level of the professor. We must rise
to the challenge of this injustice and free ourselves
from the shackles of suspicion. Third person respon
sibility must go!
