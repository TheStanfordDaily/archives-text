# Honor Code—Ideals and Facts
## 
### 
To the Editor:
The present interest in the Honor Code shows both
an awareness of the value of ideals, and the reluctant
realization that the Code is to some extent being
violated. In dealing with the question of taking exams
from classrooms we must not confuse ultimate prin
ciples of Honor with actual facts.
Loyalties and values are relative. All Stanford
students are loyal to the Honor Code, but when
that loyalty comes in conflict with loyalty to their
friends, their family, or their own ambition, it is
possible that Code loyalty may come off second
best. And for the student with poor grades it often
matters little whether removal from the University

comes because of Honor Code violation or because
of failure to pass examinations—either way out is
a source of shame and embarrassment.
In taking tests in the classroom the student's valu
ation of honor, the feeling or responsibility to one's
fellow students not to rob them of the grades they
deserve, plus the inhibiting influence of nearby per
sons all contribute to help the student resist tempta
tion. But these influences decrease in proportion to
the distance the test is taken from the classroom.
Man's need for development requires freedom, but
his inclination for self-interest needs to be curbed,
especially when it works direct hardship upon his
fellows. ROBB CRIST
