# Student Discourtesy?
## 
### 
To the Editor:
While attending the wrestling match at the gym
against Cal Poly Saturday. I was again appalled by
the complete lack of courtesy on the part of many
Stanford undergraduates. Despite frequent requests
on the part of the coach to stop shooting baskets in
the gym during the progress of the match, the basket
shooting increased to such a point in the last match
that the referee could not hear the time signal.
I'm sure that many spectators (including myself)

went away with a lower opinion of Stanford. Not only
does this immature discourtesy reflect badly on Stan
ford, but it is also most disheartening to the guys
who are spending their time and effort representing
the school on the team. If the members of the under
graduate body do not want to support their teams, the
least that they can do is accord them the courtesy
of allowing them to conduct their contests without
interference.
