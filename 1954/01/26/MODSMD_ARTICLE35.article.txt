I. James Quilien. In the first place,
I have no personal objection to stu
dents taking "exams out of. the room.
However, I think it's unwise from
a long-term point of view since it
raises questions in the minds of oth
er students, and the basis of the
Honor Code is mutual trust and
confidence.
1 think any decision should be ap
plied universally throughout the
University, not left up to individual
departments or classes. In the
whole question of the Honor Code,
I think the basic responsibility is of
the individual to himself and his
own conscience and moral integrity,
and added to this is his responsibil
ity to the group.
