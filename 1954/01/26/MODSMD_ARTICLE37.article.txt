Claudio AIvarez-Tostado: If you
need a third person to make you
honest, what's the purpose of the
Honor Code? It should be some
thing that the individual himself
believes in. It is personal responsi
bility rather than third person.
My main objection to taking ex
aminations out of the classroom has
nothing to do with honesty. If the
Honor Code is going to work, it is
going to work any place. Byt I do
object to the inconvenience caused
for the professor, when he has spent
time looking for a suitable room
which will comfortably seat his
class, and then the students dash in,
grab their blue books, and run out.
Tests come in at all different times,

often much later than the specified
deadline, and it i.s just a disorderly,

mes;iy process.
I don't think the Ivey plan is
workable*. It would be too confusing
to have dilferent systems in differ
ent classes.
