Colonel I'eler .1. Kopcsak: When
an Army ROTC examination has
been given at various times during
a day, wo have found that the class
average ol student; taking the test
later in the day has been higher.
However, wu have no evidence to
indicate that this fluctuation is due
to cheating. Instead, it may well be
due to a various number of outside
reasons (longer time to study, etc.).
When I attended West Point, an
honor code was enforced, but there
was no suggestion of taking exams
from the classrooms.
At Stanford, certain non-Univer
sity exams are proctored by us by
law.
On all other tests, no strict policy
lias been set up by this department;
it has been left to the discretion of
the individual instructors. v So the
proposed law should have no change
on our policy, and we are willing

to co-operate with whatever the
University should decide.
