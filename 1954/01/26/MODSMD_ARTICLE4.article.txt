### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
Widely divergent views on
jonqressional investigating
committees were presented last
night to a near-capacity audi
ence in Cubberley Auditorium
by a five-man, student-faculty
panel.
Pointing out the evils of investi
gating committees, Elizabeth Gonser
stated that they employed "under
handed methods" such as guilt by
association.
To prevent the "curtailment of
intellectual inquiry," she sug
gested (hat the functions of inves
tigating committees he put in the
lap of the federal courts and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Frank Freidel, acting associate
professor of history, went into the
background of congressional inves
tigating committees. â€¢
On the credit side, he affirmed that
such committees have often gathered
otherwise difficult-to-obtain infor
mation for legislative purposes. They
can be "valuable instruments for
the federal government in the hands
of selfless patriots," he added.
On the other side of the ledger,
he admitted that investigating
committees have been used by
demagogues as "national sounding
boards for their own ptditical ad
vancement."
The inherent good in such com
mutes, he concluded, should not be
sacrificed by curtailing them for the
sake of these demagogues.
The question of immunity of wit
nesses was advanced by Tim Sharpe,
who advocated the proposed Brow
nell plan.
Under this plan, recommendation
from the Attorney General would
permit the committees to grant any
witness immunity from criminal
prosecution. In this case the witness
could not "hide" behind the Fifth
Amendment under penalty of a con
tempt of court citation.
Robert Horn, professor of politi
cal science, defended the commit
tees on the grounds that their
scope of inquiry is justified, their
procedure "generally good," and
defamation incurred may be traced
not to the committees hut to the
public. "Reform," he stated, "is in
(he hands of the people."
Concrete improvements for im
proving investigational procedures
were suggested by A 1 Brouse, who
said:
1. Investigating committees
should he selected with the pur
pose of gathering information for a
specific project, and llie Pftnds
given them should he earmarked
only for that purpose.
2. Meetings should be held in
closed executive sessions, with no.
press, radio, or television cover
age.
I>. Committees should have a
constant turnover of new mem
bers.
4. Full legal rights should lie
granted witnesses.
"After all," Blouse concluded,
"we arc a free people and to sur
render our liberties to hysteria
would be to embarrass ourselves in
front of history."
