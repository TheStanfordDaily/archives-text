I'ete Kinetovie. The second of the series will he about boxing coach Kay
Lunny.)

Pete Krnetovic is head rugby coach and assistant football coach
• t Stanford. However, Pete is much more than a coach. He is part
of a recent athletic legend that evolved on the Farm.
The Stanford 1940 Wow Boys were the last football squad to
go undefeated and untied through a regular season. After the

season was over, the Indians beat
Nebraska in th Rose Bowl.
Pete was a part of the Stanford
I ackfield that did the scoring for
(lie Wow Boys. That backfield also
included Frankie Albert, Norm
. ilandlee, and Hugh Gallarneau.
The line was composed of Fred
Meyers, Bruno Bandueci, Dick
Palmer, Vic Lindskog, Chuck Tay
lor, Ed Stamrn, and Stan Graff.
Pete and Stanford sports have
I• n familiar with each other for a
long time. Way back in HJ2B Pete
would journey from his home town
ol San Jose to watch Staolord loot
hull games.
At San Jose High School he
|:laye I outstanding football and
enhanced the strength of the
track squad with his 10-Hat 100-
yard dashes. Winn it came time
to go to college, Pete chose Stan
lord in spite of the fact that his
(wo older brothers h;nl previously
matriculated at San Jose State
College.
In his freshman year Pete played
. ith the undefeated yearling foot
ball squad. lie also continued to
run tin.' dashes. His sophomoro year
was spent on a relatively destitute
football team, it went down on the
record books as having ended the
,cason with a victory over Dart
mouth. It, was the only win for the
cason.

However, it was a very interest-
I ing season. Frankie Albert and
Pete were lost in the single-wing
tailback spot. They alternated be
tween tile first and third string.
Pete could run but couldn't pass,
and Albfe iad the reverse trouble.
By 1940 Tiny Thornhill stepped
out of the head coaching position.
Clark Shaughnessy migrated from
the University of Chicago, whore his
team had dropped a close 85-0 de
cision to Michigan and (11-0 contests
to Harvard and Ohio State.
No one dreamed that a losing

coach plus a losing team would re
sult in a fabulously successful sea
son. However, there were many
hidden factors.
Somewhere between Chicago and
Stanford, Shau ;hn< sy got togeiht r
with George Halas, Luke Johnson,
anyi Bernie Ma terson ol the Chi
cago Bears. They experimented with
the "T" formation during the sum
mer ol 1940. When Shaughnessy ar
rived on the Farm, he immediately
sold the "T" to the squad.
Through the "T," Albert was
i able to do ail of the passing he
wanted without having to run.
Kinetovie was available for run
ning purposes which involved no
passing responsibilities.
As the sea on progressed, how
ever, a great team .spirit coupled
with the element of surprise fur
nished by the new "T" made the

'40 team click; Pete Kmetovic had
great day. throughout the season.
In the Washington game lie scored
i lie . down to
spearhead a 20-10 win.
His g/.eatest thrill, however,
came in the Rose PJovvl. There, lie
was involved in one of the great
est scoring plays in Stanford his
tory. On a ;»i)-yard punt return
he set up the Nebraska team for

a devastating blocking exhibition.
When he ern sed the goal with the
decisive third touchdown, there
was not a Nebraska man on his
feet. Tin* final score of 21-115
closed a perfect season.
In his last year Pete played on a
hard-luck Indian squad which lost
three close games. Coach Shaugh
nessy and quarterback Albeit were
still around, but many fine- players
had graduated.
In that final season a funny inci
dent occurred to Albert. During the
years Pete had played with Albert,
Frankie had taunted Pete about his
habit of taking his pair of false teeth
out prior to a game. Pete had a
membership in the exclusive May
field Ike Club which required its
members to have missing denture.
Somewhere along the season the op
posit ion helped Albert to fulfill the
Mayfield Ike Club requirements.
After that, Pete was the antagoniz
er.
In the spring of his senior year,
Pete went into the Navy. He played
quarterback and helped in tall the
"T" at Great Lakes Naval Training
Center in 1942. He was discharged
in 11)45 and got to play halfback in
1946 for the Philadelphia Eagles and
in 1947 for the Detroit Lions. Be
l.veen football .seasons he was work
ing toward his M.A. degree at Stan
ford.
From 1948 on he held coaching as
]'_ nments at San Bernardino Val
ley College and USF.
In 1950 he was back at the fa
miliar athletic fields of Stanford.
He was working with a former
teammate from the great '40
v (|iiad. Chuck Taylor was the Ail-
American guard on that team.
Nowadays Pete is fairly busy with
his 90 - man rugby squad. After
school, however, he goes home to
his family in Menlo Park. He claims
that all his extracurricular activi
ties are consumed in raising his four
children.

Pete Krnetovic is head rugby coach and assistant football coach

of a recent athletic legend that evolved on the Farm.
The Stanford 1940 Wow Boys were the last football squad to
go undefeated and untied through a regular season. After the

season was over, the Indians beat
Nebraska in th Rose Bowl.
Pete was a part of the Stanford
I ackfield that did the scoring for
(lie Wow Boys. That backfield also
included Frankie Albert, Norm

The line was composed of Fred
Meyers, Bruno Bandueci, Dick
Palmer, Vic Lindskog, Chuck Tay

Pete and Stanford sports have

At San Jose High School he

was spent on a relatively destitute
football team, it went down on the

cason.

However, it was a very interest-
