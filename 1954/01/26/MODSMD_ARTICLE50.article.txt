# Breakers Rout Campo 37.14
## 
### 
Breakers I squad completely
overwhelmed a j;ame but outclassed
El Cumpo team by a 37-14 margin
on the hardwoods of tlje Pavilion in
last night's top mural thriller.
Both fives had trouble scoring as
an exceedingly stellar brand of de
fensive ball was the order of the
evening. However, the more expe
rienced Breakers crew managed to
hold a substantial lead from the
opening moments of the game.
Guard Dave O'Hara played ex
cellently for Breakers, turning in
the best defensive performance of
the contest. Larry Tarlow and Tur
ner Schley, both of Breakers, were
high scorers in the affair. Tarlow
hit for YA points while Schley
threaded the needle for a total of
eight.
In other game El Tigre topped
Breakers II 30-17.
