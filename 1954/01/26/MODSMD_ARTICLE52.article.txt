THE LAKE — Lagunita may be
empty, but there was a fine
puddle in front of the Pavilion
when the KGO-TV men arrived
for the Saturday night game.
Ingenious engineers construct
ed a bridge to carry them from
the shore to the operating is
land.


CONSOLIDATION—A techni
cian gathers a portion of the
cables connecting the cameras
and the truck. These are then I
bundled together with leather 1
straps, and suspended across I
the lobby of the Pavilion. From 1
there, they run out a window I
and into the back of the truck. *


NERVfc, CENTER—I he insidee of the TV truck are filled with electronic equipment, storage
space for cameras, monitors, and assorted equipment en route to the game. In this picture,
the two screens to the left of the picture are connected with two of the three cameras. Fur
ther to the left is the audio monitoring desk, where the soupd lot the program is controlled.
In front of him is a screen showing the picture as it is sent out; above him is another connected
to a receiver which shows what the transmitter is sending from San Frarn i:;co. To his right
are a mobile radio telephone and an intercom for communication with th? nn 'owave truck.


COMMENTARY — From here originates the voice of the pro
gram. In the center is Doug Pledger. To his left is the "agency
man," a representative of the advertising department. He cues
Pledger to advertisements, filler items, and score cards. He
also faces the screen of a TV receiver, watching the completed
program and commercials, and listens to it on one of two pairs
of headsets. The other set connects him with the program di
rector and cameramen. Pledger's wife accompanies him to the
games and acts as his spotter.


14 FIKS 1 CHECK—Technical director Warren Andreason watches one of the monitor screens in
side the Pavilion to determine the coverage one camera can handle. With him are a technician
and an unidentified Stanford student. It is now late afternoon, and a multitude of chores and
checks must be completed before the program goes on the air at 8:30.


ON THE AIR—A cameraman's job calls for intense concentra
tion. Ordinarily, he will be following the ball with one of four
possible lenses, keeping his ear tuned to the headset for in
structions from the program director, and keeping his camera
in adjustment. Red lights on the front and back of his camera
show when his picture is being broadcast.


CAMERA ALIGNMENT—A cameraman gives his equipment a
careful checkout. On the lens is a "Video Analyzer," a device
not unlike a slide projector. The pattern is projected onto the
camera, then piped out to the truck.
