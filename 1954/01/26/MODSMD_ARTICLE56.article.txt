# Electronic Hodge-Podge Sends Action to Viewers
## 
### JACK BYRNE 
On the TV screen before you,
Lawler turns, hooks, and sinks
another two - pointer. An elec
tronic hodge-podge has brought
this to you, but it has taken men
to produce it.
Getting a picture from the Stan
ford Pavilion to a Northern Cali
fornia home is no small feat. From
the Pavilion, a ganglion of cable
winds its way to the inside of a
truck. The video signal that has
been collected and selecte i here is
piped into a Pacific Telephone and
Telegraph truck, with a dish-shaped
reflector 011 top, which is parked
nearby. Here the picture is super
imposed on a microwave carrier,
and beamed to the top of Hoovei
Tower.
Atop Hoover Tower is a micro
wave relay point.. Here the signal
from the truck is amplified, and
then pointed via a parabolic re
flector to the PT&T office on New
Montgomery Street in San Fran
cisco. Here the signal is fed onto
an equalized cable pair, and wends
its way across to the KGO trans
mitter on Twin Peaks, housed in
the old Sutro mansion.
The men who juggle this signal
on its way to the viewer arc an
1111 impassioned crew. With the
exception of Doug Pledger, the
announcer, they remain absolute
ly deadpan throughout the oper
ation.
Inside the TV van, the program
director speaks to the technicians
before him and the cameramen in
side, as well as the agency man. A

low monologue carries the program:
"Take two (camera number two)
. . . set up the score on three; pre
pare to disolve to three. That score
right, Milt? OK, dissolve to three.
Fred, will you pick up the San Jose
section on two . .
Occasionally lie commends or
gives advice to the operator.
Inside the Pavilion, the announcer
sits flanked by his spotter and
agency man. The agency man wears
two headsets, one keeping him in
touch with the van and camera man
and the other carrying the voice
that is coming over the air.
As the announcer calls the
game, his eye seldom leaves for
more than a second the monitor
ing screen in front of him, which
shows what the viewer has on his
screen, hence what the announcer
must describe.
The camera man sweeps his cam
era back and forth, following the
ball as best he can. He arrived on
the scene at 3 in the afternoon, and
worked five hours setting up and
testing. It will be at least 10 be
fore the game is over, and another
hour after that before the crew will
be on their way back to the city. He
thinks wistfully of a beer . . .
Somewhere on the West Coast, a
viewer gets up long enough to go
get a beer out of the refrigerator.
Falling back into his soft, chair, he
mutters to himself about the cam
eraman who loses the play for a
moment, the commercial that runs
over into the playing time, or a
quick flip-over on the picture.
"Should be simple enough to avoid
that," he thinks. "I wonder how
those guys can get by with that . . ."

the Pavilion, a ganglion of cable
winds its way to the inside of a
truck. The video signal that has
been collected and selecte i here is
piped into a Pacific Telephone and
Telegraph truck, with a dish-shaped
reflector 011 top, which is parked
nearby. Here the picture is super
imposed on a microwave carrier,
and beamed to the top of Hoovei
Tower.
Atop Hoover Tower is a micro
wave relay point.. Here the signal
from the truck is amplified, and
then pointed via a parabolic re
flector to the PT&T office on New
Montgomery Street in San Fran
cisco. Here the signal is fed onto
an equalized cable pair, and wends
its way across to the KGO trans
mitter on Twin Peaks, housed in
the old Sutro mansion.
The men who juggle this signal
on its way to the viewer arc an
1111 impassioned crew. With the
exception of Doug Pledger, the
announcer, they remain absolute
ly deadpan throughout the oper
ation.
Inside the TV van, the program
director speaks to the technicians
before him and the cameramen in
side, as well as the agency man. A

low monologue carries the program:
"Take two (camera number two)
. . . set up the score on three; pre
pare to disolve to three. That score
right, Milt? OK, dissolve to three.
Fred, will you pick up the San Jose
section on two . .
Occasionally lie commends or
gives advice to the operator.
Inside the Pavilion, the announcer
sits flanked by his spotter and
agency man. The agency man wears
two headsets, one keeping him in
touch with the van and camera man
and the other carrying the voice
that is coming over the air.
As the announcer calls the
game, his eye seldom leaves for
more than a second the monitor
ing screen in front of him, which
shows what the viewer has on his
screen, hence what the announcer
must describe.
The camera man sweeps his cam
era back and forth, following the
ball as best he can. He arrived on
the scene at 3 in the afternoon, and
worked five hours setting up and
testing. It will be at least 10 be
fore the game is over, and another
hour after that before the crew will
be on their way back to the city. He
thinks wistfully of a beer . . .
Somewhere on the West Coast, a
viewer gets up long enough to go
get a beer out of the refrigerator.
Falling back into his soft, chair, he
mutters to himself about the cam
eraman who loses the play for a
moment, the commercial that runs
over into the playing time, or a
quick flip-over on the picture.
"Should be simple enough to avoid
that," he thinks. "I wonder how
those guys can get by with that . . ."
On the TV screen before you,
Lawler turns, hooks, and sinks
