### 
BERLIN, Jan. 26 (UP)—Secre
tary of State John Foster Dulles
rejected Russia's proposal for a
conference with Red China to
day, denouncing the Peiping re
gime as a "convicted aggressor"
which helped cause 150,000
American casualties in Korea.
Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov
brushed off Dulles' turndown and
formally proposed a five - power
meeting with the Chinese Commu
nists in May or June.
The United States, Britain, and
France accepted the Soviet agen
da for the conference, getting it
off to an unexpectedly fast start.
But Dulles warned bluntly that
he was agreeing to it only to skip
through the first item — China —
and get down to business on Ger
many and Austria.
Along with Dulles, Anthony Eden
of Britain and Georges Bidault of
France emphasized that, agreement
to the conference program present
ed by Molotov yesterday in no wise
indicated agreement with any part
of the substance of it. It was topped
by a proposal for the five-power
conference to discuss world peace.
Taking the floor at the start of
today's session to answer Molotov's
blast yesterday against the Western
defense system, Dulles saicl:
"I would like to state here
plainly and unequivocally what
the Soviet foreign minister al
ready knows—the United States
will not agree to join in a five
power conference with the Chi
nese Communist aggressors for
the purpose of dealing generally
with the peace of the world."
He recalled that the United Na
tions had condemned Red China as
an aggressor in Korea, where "its
aggressive armies joined with the
North Korean aggressors to kill and
wound 150,000 Americans."
The West startled Molotov by the
quick acceptancc of his agenda,
conference room spectators said.
Never before at a post-war meeting
ol East and West have such pre
liminaries been handlecl so quickly.
