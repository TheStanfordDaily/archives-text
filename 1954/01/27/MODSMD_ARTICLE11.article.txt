morc is from the Palo Alto Chil
dren's Theater.
Wendell Cole, the director of the
production, has designed the setting
which is unusual because of its size
and elaborate structure. The set
shows the dining room, two upstairs
bedrooms, the front, porch of the
house, the interior of the church,
and part, of a jungle background si
multaneously.
Because of the size, the set ex
tends across the curtain line onto
the extreme front of the stage, thus
eliminating the use of the curtain
during scene changes. Lighting ef
fects will indicate the IS) scene
changes by dimming the lights or
using special effects such as sunsets
and lightning.
LaVerne Weber has arranged the
lighting. St. Clair Williams has de
signed the costumes for the play.

through Jan. 30 and the next, week
end of Feb. 3 through ti. There are
a few tickets still available for $1
