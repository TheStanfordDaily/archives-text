SPARTAN GYM, San Jose,
Jan. 26 â€” Some names that
haven't been heard of recently
in Stanford basketball led the
way here tonight as the Indians
defeated San Jose State, 70-60.
Dave Epperson, six-five-and-a-
Half forward whose main activity
this season has been sitting on the
bench, and guard Ron Wagner, who
displayed a nifty set shot, provided
most of the impetus for the In
dians.
They tied center Russ Lawler for
high scoring honors for Stanford.
The trio collected 13 points each.
Epperson went into the game early
in the second quarter with the Cards
holding a slim 20-18 lead, and he
promptly scored seven of the In
dians' next 12' points as they boosted
their margin to 32-20.
Wagner connected for seven of
his tallies in the slow first period
which saw Stanford leading by
only one point. After Epperson's
splurge, the Indians cooled but
still maintained a 34-27 advantage
at half time.
After the intermission, however,
the Cards got their shooting eyes
back again and, fast breaking the
Spartans into the ground, they soon
had piled up a 17-point lead.
Late in the third period Coach
Bob Burnett began to empty his
bench as eventually all 12 men on
the squad here tonight saw action.
Ten of the dozen who played
scored, with only guards Bill Flan-
I
Iprs and Carlos Ben failing to find
he range.
San .lose managed lo otitscore
Stanford 20-1(1 in the last 111 min
utes, but it was never aide to gel
any closer than nine points.
San Jose's Carroll Williams, who
played the entire game with a
girrtpy leg. took high point honors
for the night with 17 markers
while Boli lljelm, who gave the
( aids plenty of trouble in the first
half with his jump shots, had 15

| digits.

Jose during the game hitting on 29
of 07 shots for 4'5 per cent while the
Spartans connected on but 17 of 56
from the floor for a mere !!() per
cent.
The only thing that kept San Jose
in the game at all was its proficiency
from the foul line as it hit on 2(5 out
of 32 charity tosses.,
Williams dropped in eight of nine
from the foul line in the last period
alone, and he had nine for 11 dur
ing the game.
