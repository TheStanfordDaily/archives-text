WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 (UP) —
Senate Republican leaders today of
fered a new compromise on the hot
ly disputed "Bricker amendment"
on the eve of a new "great debate"
on foreign policy powers of the
President.
Sen. Homer Ferguson (Pi., Mich.),
who drafted the new proposal, said
it was his "opinion" that the com
promise plan would eliminate the
controversial "which clause" of the
Bricker amendment.
Sen. John YV. Bricker (R., ().)

posal. He said any "reasonable
compromise" lie could accept must
contain the principle of the "which
clause," a provision that no treaty
shall become law of this country
unless Congress passes legislation
which would be valid without a

simple majority of Congress, or
even of the individual states, where
as the Constitution provides for
treaty ratification by a two-thirds
Senate vote.
Ferguson did not. say whether his
new compromise contains the "prin
ciple" of Bricker's "which clause."
He said it is acceptable to Senate
Republican Leader William F.
Knowland.
