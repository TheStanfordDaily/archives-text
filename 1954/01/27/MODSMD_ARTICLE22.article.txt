### 
(Editor's note: The Dally asked
(Ik- members of Kxeom Ihe fol
lowing question yesterday: "What
do you think of (lie Ivey Plan?"
Their statements appear below.
(The Daily could not contact
Dave Cnrr, Jim IVliteheil, .folm
Sprague, <»i Kudy Reich.)
Barbara Myer, Women's Dorms:
1 favor the Ivey nl«n with pmnhn-

His on the profes-'
sors being able t/
bring up the sub>
j ec t. of whethe: I
t. ho student J
.should leave th<
room with test?
There is a neec
for policy con
(fining the Hon
or Code ideally
Practically speak-

ing, 1 don't think uie operations oi
the Code should change.
Dave Jenks, Frosli Representa
fbe: Too many procedural prob-

ems would arise
'i'o rn the Ivey
D lan. I would
:]father see a rul
ing which would
| clearly give stU
.lents the right to
akc ( xarns out of
•lass, with no re
strictions. A pro
, essor could still
I late his prefer-

ence tnat exams do nol leave the
classroom, but it would be up to
the student to decide.
David Gihb. Graduate Represen
tative: I don't th<"k tV.orp should

be any restric
tions on the stu
dents' rig h t t
take exams iron
class, and such .
resolution woul
have a long-rang
effect of strength
ening especial 1.
the first as wci
as the third per
son responsibilit;

As a compromise, n. u u u.e i V ey j
Plan should satisfy all sides of opin- I
ion for the present.
Alice .In Kwong, Off - Campus: '

The Ivey Plan is weakbeoaiise it

d oesri't makil
enough provisioi ?■
for third persoi '
responsibility, th
core of the Code
The plan wouli
lay down a uni
versal rule for al
to follow ant
|wo u 1 d eonside:
faculty and stu- k
| dent opinion. Bur

I fefel its weak points outwejgn its
strong points. Too much tempta
» tion is offered the weak ones, who
must be kept in line by social pres
j sure, if nothing else.
Jackie Begien, Union Units: It's
fprriW" i>nrnvt'.nt to get a plan both

tudents and fac
ilty can approve.
The Ivey Plan is
veak in its lack
>112 provision for
hird person re
ponsibility. I' d
avor an amend
ment to say "stu
1e nt s may take
•xams out of the
•pom to an area

wnere third person responsibility
can operate."
Nancy Nicholson, Women's Row:
S t u-d en ts and Excom members

.should dec i d c
whether or no<
the proposec
amendment i;
realistic. I seij
j many obv i o u !
j loopholes in i •
now, the worst o
whi c h , is th a
so m e professor
will be afraid t(
bring the mattei

up lor class discussion in rear of
unfavorable class discussion.

A 1 Ivey, Village: The best things
about my plan are it« slrr>«t; on «tn-

dent responsibil
ity, its provisior
for student - fac
ulty discussions
and its adaptabil
ity to special sit
uations. The ad
ministration o 1
the vote c oulc
prove difficult
but can work i
the students an<

faculty are wholehearted behind it.
Janice Hunter, Senior Class: It is
evident we h™* a problem—let us

lace it realisti
< 'ally. I think we
leed constructive
iug g e s tions to
in prove th e
vorkability oi tiie
ve y Plan. I'm
Manning to talk
o as many sen
| ors as possible to
j sk their opi n -
I on s concerning

possiDie amendments.
Bob Mishell, Men's Malls: The
problem of takine te«ts from the

exam rooms is not
the real problerr
which confront:
us, but rather it
is a .symptom o
our attitude tc
the Code. Th(
basic prob 1 err
will not be af
fected by me r (
voting or rules
What we need ti

decide is first, if all ot us want to
be on the Honor Code, and second,
how we will educate ourselves to
use the Code judiciously. 1 believe
we must attack the real problem
and not the symptoms.
