# CAMPUS OPINION
## Honor Code Comparison 
### 
To the Editor:
Perhaps a comparison with two other schools might
help. At Antioch College, Ohio, an Honor System is
used whereby students may take tests home for
several days—even tests which involve half open
book and half closed-hook questions. There is no
pledge to sign.
At. (Hp University of Cincinnati, students are re
quired to deposit their books, papers, purses, etc.
at the front of the room while a roving proctor
watches their writing.
From experience during exams and discussions
with students at both schools, I believe there is

almost no cheating at Antioch and much at the Uni
versiy of Cincinnati. Is the difference purely a matter
of degree of trust? Not entirely: Antioch de-empha
sizes grades as much as possible. The U. of Cincin
nati emphasizes grades.
Responsibility toward the college community is
not fostered by a system which emphasizes individual
achievement in terms of point averages. I'm afraid
that Stanford students will cheat, despite the trust
placed in them, as long as they are taught to value
grades. Thus, the current discussions, however well
reasoned, cannot hope to improve honor at Stanford.
