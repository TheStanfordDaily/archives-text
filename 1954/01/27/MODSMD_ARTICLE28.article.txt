Thomas A. Bailey: The Honor
Code is a precious thing, but it will
break down if subjected to undue
strain, as it was at West Point sev
eral years ago. The taking of papers
from the room reduces the force of
second - person disapprobation and
increases the strain. No one is ar
guing that students may not leave
the room without their papers. J
feel that ori the whole the Code
works well, but a number of my
associates are becoming dissatisfied
with student enforcement.
The faculty permitted the student
body to have a Code, and they will
take it away if and when they feel
that the students are not doing their
job. If I were a student, I should
not want to " see a general exodus
of fellow students from the room.
Moreover, I should want to remain
in the room so as to save time and
benefit by any additional explana
tions from the instructor. If the in
structor on his part makes arrange
ments for alternate seats and proper
ventilation, there is little reason
why the student should need to take
his test elsewhere.
The great bulk of our students nre
honorable; a very few will always
try to cheat; a somewhat larger
number will cheat if unduly tempt
ed. That is why we have alternate
seats, if possible; and no one thinks
that his honor is impugned. That
is why we have expected the stu
dents to stay in the room. The Code
will collapse if we make cheating
too easy.
