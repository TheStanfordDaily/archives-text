Lieut. Col. Edward II. Robinson:
We are training men to be officers
in the United States Air Force. With
such students, their word must be
their bond.
From the point of view of the Air
Force, there has been no question
about the honor of our students.

We believe such honor to be pres
ent not only in students enrolled in
our program but in nil students at
tending Stanford.
We have had little trouble with
the Honou Code in the past, and
anticipate no more in the future.
We would consider any student not
capable of living up to the Honor
Code not Air Force ROTC mate
rial, and would immediately dis
miss him from the program.
