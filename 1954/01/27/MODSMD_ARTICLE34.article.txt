Capt. E. E. Lord: In my depart
ment we have such large classes
that it is necessary to give short
examinations, taking only part of
the lecture hour, to establish grades.
Therefore we can't let students take
their examinations from the class
rooms because of the time waste in
volved.
As to the problem in other de
partments: If a student is going to
obey the Honor Code, he will obey
in the classroom as well as .out.
Therefore there should be no reason
for students to leave the class.
II the problem is crowded /condi
tions, the size of classes should be
lessened rather than have students
leave the rooms.
