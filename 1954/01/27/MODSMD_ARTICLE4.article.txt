### BILL WRIGHT 
Norway's attitude toward communism was discussed by Kon
rad B. Krauskopf, professor of geochemistry at Stanford, last night
in Memprial Auditorium before a large Tuesday Evening Series
audience.
"Adventures in Norwayâ€”Scientific and Otherwise" was the

title of the talk. Dr. Krauskopf was'
in Norway from July 1952 until Au
gust 1953 doing research at the
University of Oslo.
He described his trip with the
Norwegian Geological Society to
northern Norway above the Arctic
Circle where the midnight sun
makes "it as pleasant at three in
the morning as it is at three in the
afternoon, which even California
can't boast."
Dr. Krauskopf said that the Nor
wegian attitude toward communism
is very much like our own. The Nor
wegians have rio use for communist
ideology, and they are very much
concerned about what the Russians
are doing.
But because Norway is a small
country and under its socialistic
government it already has many of
the benefits of which the Commu
nists usually boast, the Norwegians
"regard the Communist problem
with seeming calmness," he said.
"Norway has a long tradition of
tolerance, and its reaction is very
unfavorable toward anti-subver
sive activities in America. Nor
mal reaction is that America is
unduly excited and hysterical,"
The spy hunts and the Congres
sional investigations which arc
headline news in the United States
arc also displayed prominently in
Norwegian papers, Dr. Krauskopf
stated.
The speaker showed slides of his
trip to northern Norway where he
studied black, granite-like rocks for
the Norwegian Geological Survey
in hopes that the rocks would be a
clue to platinum, nickel, and chrom
ium deposits.
