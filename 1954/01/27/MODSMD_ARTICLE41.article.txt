# Phi Sigs Romp Over Fiji Five
## 
### 
Phi Sig 1 rolled to an easy 62-22
victory over Fiji 11 in mural play
last night in Encina Gym.
The Phi Sigs got off to an early
lead and were never headed. Rod
Irvine paced the Phi Sigs' first-hall
attack as they took a 27-12 half
time advantage.
In the second half the Phi Sigs
turned the game into a rout. Irvine,
Sparky Baker, and Paul Tavis rolled
in the points for the Phi Sigs. Irvine
was high for the game with 20.
Baker netted 14, and Tavis dropped
in 13.
The Fijis couldn't hit the basket,
j missing many easy shots. They also
had trouble on the boards, where
the tall Phi Sigs had a tremendous
advantage.
In some of Monday's games, Stern
1 won over the Chinese Club by
forfeit, the NHOTC slaughtered the
Roble Hashers 51-15, and Village
210 beat Encina 4W I 25-18.
