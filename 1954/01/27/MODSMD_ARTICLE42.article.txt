# Pro Grid Draft Begins Tomorrow
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Tomorrow will be the big day for a number of college football
players as officials of the National Professional Football League
gather together at Philadelphia lor the drafting of college gridders.
The meeting opens this morning with a discussion of television
problems. The drafting starts tomorrow and lasts two days, and a

number of Stanford loot hull players'
should be selected.
The player's draft is a dramatic
process. Tables are situated in a
large room, one for each of the 12
teams. Around the tables sit the
coaching stalls, business managers,
publicity men, and owners.
The first step in the draft is
the selection of the bonus team.
Each year a eluh is selected hy
lot, and il gets a choice of any
football player in the nation. 'I'll**
bonus picking continues each year
until no teams are left. This sea
son, live still remain: Cleveland
Hi owns, Chicago Cardinals, Green
Hit.v Packers, Pittsburgh Steelers,
and Baltimore Colts. (Cast year
the San Francisco 4 Iters won the
honus pick and selected end Harry
Haheoek.)
Then the regular selection process
begins. The team with lowest win
ning percentage lar;! season gets a
selection, followed by the second
to-last place team, and so forth up
to the first place club.
This is called the lirst "round" of
selecting. There are 15 rounds of
selection on each of the two days
(Thursday and Friday). With 12
teams, this means .'l6O players will be
chosen.
Card quarterback Boh Garrett is
one of the top pro prospects. It
has been announced that if the
bonus team does not select Gar
rett, the last-place Chicago Cards
will take him.
Needless to say, no one has any
choice ari to which team gets Gar
rett, but most of the Stanford coach
ing staff hope the Cleveland Browns
get the bonus pick. "Bob would be
another Graham if he could operate
out. of the "cup" defense they pro
vide for quarterbacks," one of tin*
mentors commented.
Other Card players that could be

selected are Sam Morley, John
Steinberg, Phil Wilson, Ted Tanner,
and Norm Manoogian. Not all ol
these players plan on entering pro
hall however, and this should affect
where and when they are picked.
Chuck Taylor, head football coach
at Stanford, has attended pro draft
sessions when he was an assistant
coach for the 49ers.
At first thought, one would think
selecting players woidd be a com
paratively simple process. Couldn't
a team simply list, on a sheet of
paper the players they want in
older, crossing them out when .some
one else selects them?
"It isn't that easy," Taylor said.
"Suppose your team is weak at the
guard position. Then the first sev
eral names on your list might l>e
guards. If the first guards on your
list are selected by someone else,
you. would take some of the lower
guards. But, on the other hand, if
your team gets the first, guards on
the list you might not want some
of the others."
For this reason, the teams use a
curd tiling system for their selec
tions. When the turn of a team
comes, the players and coaches
discuss whom they wish to select
and come upon a mutual agree
ment. This sometimes takes as long
as 20 minutes for just one selec
tion.
Some of the other top pro pros
pects besides Garrett are Notre
Dame's Neil Worden and Art Hun
ter, UCLA;; Paul Cameron, Minne
sota's Paul Giel, Kentucky's Steve
Roberts.
Players are eligible for the draft
when the class in which they stalled
graduates. Thus, all players start
ing college in 1950 are eligible, even
if they are not graduating this
spring.
