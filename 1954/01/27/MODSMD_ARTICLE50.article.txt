# 'Top Collegiate Player' Is Stanford Polo Coach
## 
### JIM MORREY 
They've tagged him the "Wis
consin Terror" and the "Stan
ford Sensation."
THEY are California polo ex
perts.
And HE is Allan Scherer, 22-
year-old Stanfprd graduate student
from Milwaukee, who has received
the highest rating of last season's
intercollegiate polo players, three
goals for indoor play and four goals
outdoors.
Now in Business School, Scherer
began his polo career as a sopho
more at Judson High School in
Phoenix, Arizona. As a senior at
Judson, Scherer, in the role of as
sistant coach and team captain,
could look back on many hard-rid
ing victories which netted the
school the Arizona state polo title
for three successive years.
Since his arrival at Stanford as a
freshman in 1949, Scherer has con
sistently shown himself to be a
beautiful horseman, an unusually
long hitter, and a smart stickman.
He now coaches the Stanford polo
ists, after leading the team as cap
tain for three years.
Stanford has had a colorful and
challenging polo history. It is the
only school on the West Coast play
ing polo. Before the war, Stanford's
polo teams were sponsored by the
ROTC.
But with the vanishing of the
cavalry, and with the support of
past enthusiasts like Allen Ross,
one-time manager of the Riding
School and team coach, and Bill
Decker, 1949 team captain, Stan
ford's team came into the ranks of
the known.
Success and Allan Scherer came
together at Stanford when the Farm
poloists won the coveted Verdier
Trophy as a result of scalping five
other teams to become undefeated
champions of the Pacific Coast Polo
League for the 1950 season.
Many other wins were credited to
the Indians after that. In 1951 they
won the San Francisco Indoor Tour
nament. And in 1952 Stanford was

invited for the first time to compete
in the Intercollegiate Indoor Tour
nament in New York City.
This invitation ushered in the
Cards' best and most activc sea
son since the Polo Association
was founded following the war.
During the years 1952-53, Stan-

ford entered the New York tour
nament twice. Although barely
squeezed out of first place both
times, they managed to defend
the honor of the West by scoring
a total victory over hard-driving
Yale.
Santa Barbara was also the site of
tournament play during'the 1952-53
season. Here the Indians scored one
tournament win, once again sparked
by Allan Scherer.
Scherer's association with the stick
and willow ball has not been con

fined only to Stanford, however. At
the number one spot he helped lead
the San Francisco Polo Club to vic
tory over an undefeated Honolulu
team in 1950. His unerring scoring
ability has chalked up goals for the
Golden Gate and San Mateo Polo
Clubs.
But some of his best showings
have taken place in Milwaukee. A
resident of Wauwatosa, he has worn
the yellow and green of the Mil
waukee Polo Club enough times to
become one of their hottest scorers,
having run up as many as ten goals
in one game. With the Milwaukee
professionals Scherer has helped de
feat two Hawaiian teams, and clubs
from Texas, Detroit, Chicago, and
St. Louis.
Under Schercr's coaching the
Indians can look forward to a good
spring season. Intramural match
es will sharpen up the team for
their Sunday visits to Golden
Gate Park for practice play and
for the coming Santa Barbara and
Yerdier Trophy tournaments.
Polo does not have the support
of the University's Athletic Depart
ment. All club members have to
finance their travels themselves,
which sometimes makes the going
tough. But their unity and deter
mination, combined with the helpful
interest of the new owner of the
Riding School, Colonel Alec Sysin,
has resulted in many fine past rec
ords and much to look forward to.
Coming are games with Bay Area
clubs, and the annual scheduled se
ries with New Mexico Military In
stitute during spring vacation. These
will give the Indian polo enthusi
asts another chance to show ofl
their spirit and ability.
