# The 						Code and Responsibility
##

EDITORIAL
Call it first person, call it third person, call it whatever you
want. The Stanford Honor Code rests on responsibility.
We believe that careful consideration of the meaning of this
responsibility can help answer the complex question—do students
have the right to take examinations out of the classroom?
The strongest responsibilty is that of each student for himself.
Each of us can guarantee his own honesty. But it is not possible
for an individual to guarantee the honesty of everyone else.
And the student can fully exercise his responsibility only if he
is free to take his examination wherever he chooses.
With these points in mind, v/e believe that Stanford's Honor
Code must rest on first person responsibility.
Yet we know that no one lives alone in the world, "an island
complete unto himself." It is unfortunate, but true, that some
students m(ay abuse the freedom which goes with responsibil
ity. Each of us owes a second responsibility to help these indi
viduals to abide by the Honor Code.
Of all solutions proposed for the problem of examinations leav
ing the classroom, the Ivey Plan suggested at last week's Execu
tive Committee meeting best allows us to fulfill both of our obli
gations.
In stating that "students have the right to take examinations out
of the classroom," the Ivey Plan assumes that each student will
bear the responsibility for himself in a free situation.
And yet, where there is good reason to believe that this first
person responsibility is not working, the plan provides that a class
may vote to keep exams in the room.
Under the present sys'em the burden of helping weaker stu
dents to withstand temptation falls on the individual professor or
student who must report a student who has cheated. Under the
new system, students in a class could exercise their responsi
bility to each other collectively as well, by voting to keep
examinations in the room.
However good the Ivey Plan sounds in theory, we hope that
Excom won't make a decision before giving careful consideration
to complex psychological problems involved in the class vote.
Such questions as "Will the vote be secret?" and "Will a simple
majority rule?" must be answered before the system can succeed.
Tonight, and possibly for some time in the future, Excom will be
discussing the Ivey Plan and the whole question of examinations
leaving the classroom. Tonight, as many students as possible
should go to the Excom meeting to help thrash out the compli
cated problems still unsolved.
Tonight, we are being asked to shoulder still a third responsi
bility to our Honor Code. And on our willingness to take on these
lesponsibilities rests that code.
