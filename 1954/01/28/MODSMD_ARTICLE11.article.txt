# IKE SAYS:
## Condon Should Have Chance To Hear Self 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (UP) â€”
President Eisenhower said today
that Rep. Robert L. Condon (D.,
Calif.) should be given a full op
portunity to clear himself of pro-
Communist charges if the nation is
to have decency and justice.
Mr. Eisenhower, who discussed
the Condon case at his news confer
ence, did not indicate whether the
administration itself will give Con
don a chance to prove or disprove
charges against him contained in
files of the Atomic Energy Commis
sion.
An AEC spokesman said he could
not discuss any individual security
case. He noted that the AEC did not
itself make public the pro-Red alle
gations against Condon.
These charges led the commission
to bar the lawmaker from top-secret
atomic tests in Nevada last year to
which all members of Congress
were invited.
Condon, at a second conuuittec
hearing today, completed his re
ply to some 11 "derogatory" state
ments about him in AEC liles. lie
denied he was ever a Communist
or a member of three groups la
beled subversive by the Attorney
General.
He denied he called Russia a "true
democracy" in 1943. He admitted
past membership in two groups later
labeled subversive, but said he quit
before they were publicly con
demned.
The President was reminded at
his news conference of a speech
he made last year emphasizing the
basic American right of an ac
cused person to meet his accuser
"facc to face." He was asked if
lie would apply this to the Condon
case.
Mr. Eisenhower said it is difficult
to apply an off-hand expression of
a conviction to a specific case in
which he had not been involved.
