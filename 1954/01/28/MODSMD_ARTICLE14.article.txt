# Russ Stall Big 4 Talks

### 
BERLIN, Jan. 27 (UP)--Russia
stalled the Big Four conference to
day with a demand for agreement
on a five-power meeting with Red
China before the foreign ministers
could take up Germany and Aus
tria.
V. M. Molotov pounded away for
90 minutes at the West's uncompro
mising rejection of his demand for a
meeting with China on global peace,
disarmament, and world trade. He
professed to see signs that the West
would give ground.
And after the third session broke
up, an official Soviet spokesman,
Fedor Lllyichev, insisted it would
not be possible to move on to Aus
tria and Germany until agreement
had been reached on China — the
first item on the program.
Molotov will be chairman of the
fourth meeting at 3 p.m. (6 a.m.
PST) tomorrow. Again the subject
will be Communist China. Secre
tary of State John Foster Dulles will
be the first speaker.
The West had hoped to move on
to Germany and Austria tomorrow,
in line with Dulles' proposal today
that the ministers take "no action"
on the Chinese conference and leave
it behind.
But the Russians made it plain
they had other ideas. The first
round deadlock showed signs of
draging out in a hopeless wrangle
over procedure.
One after another Dulles, Anthony
Eden of Britain, and Georges Bidault
of France said firmly that they
would not join Red China in a five
power conference.
Dulles added that they would not
even consider a limited mteting on
specific Far Eastern issues until a
Korean settlement is reached. But
he did suggest that exchanges on
Far Eastern questions might be car
ried out through regular diplomatic
channels.
Molotov spoke last. He didn't
budge an inch from his original de
mand. He also complained bitterly
about the West's "economic discrim
ination" against the Communist bloc.
He proposed three broad catego
ries of problems for discussion at a
Big Five conference:
1. Reduction of armaments, in
cluding atomic weapons.
2. Political issues and relaxation
of tension, including questions con
cerning China.
3. Economic problems, including
international trade.
