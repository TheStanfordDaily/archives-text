## We Didn't Come for Protection

To the Editor: ,
It apears that there is a confusion in the minds of
certain students and faculty members over two dis
tinct and important issues: Student. Government and
111** Honor Code. They are not. the same thing. Honor
is fundamentally individual group honor results
from the integrity of the group members.
The Honor Code assumes that Stanford students
will behave honorably; it imposes an individual re
sponsibility for integrity, with third-person responsi
bility as a check in case of violations. But the point
is that it is individual.
The fact that violations are tried by a student
council instead of a faculty hoard is completely in
consequential. There used to be student government
without an honor system; there could as well be an
honor system without student government.
No one has suggested that. Men's and Women's
Councils or some other group should station official
student proctors in examination rooms. But when the
individual is forced to remain hi the room with his
test so that he may be undei the watchful eye of a
roomful of fellow students, is there really a differ
ence? The implication is the same: that be is too
"weak" to be trusted, that his honor is not, reliable.
Then where is your honor code?
Of course first-person responsibility is more basic
than third-person responsibility. This is no police
late Admittedly there are some who f■ iI to live up
to tlie individual trust they cannot be entirely

screened out, by third-person responsibility or any
other method.
But to maintain the proper attitude toward honor,
it is essential that no one wink or connive at the dis
honesty of another; that is the essence of the third
person responsibility clause.
Morally, the principle of the Honor Code is thrown
out the window when students are forbidden to take
exams from the classroom. But even practically
speaking, this plan is no solution. II an individual is
going to cheat, he may "take a break" in the middle
of an exam, look up the forgotten material, then write
it in his blue book upon returning to the room. Or
are we to be forced to sit through a four-hour final
with no break whatsoever? Where work other than
examinations is considered in grading, there will still
be opportunity to cheat.
We did not come to Stanford to be "protected."
We therefore submit that the "traditional privilege"
of taking blue books out of the room during an ex
amination should be made a part of the Honor Code,
a guaranteed right for :«11 of the Stanford .tudenl
body.

of an exam, look up the forgotten material, then write
it in his blue book upon returning to the room. Or
are we to be forced to sit through a four-hour final
with no break whatsoever? Where work other than
examinations is considered in grading, there will still
be opportunity to cheat.
We did not come to Stanford to be "protected."
We therefore submit that the "traditional privilege"
of taking blue books out of the room during an ex
amination should be made a part of the Honor Code,
a guaranteed right for :«11 of the Stanford .tudenl
body.

To the Editor: ,
It apears that there is a confusion in the minds of
certain students and faculty members over two dis
tinct and important issues: Student. Government and
111** Honor Code. They are not. the same thing. Honor
is fundamentally individual group honor results
from the integrity of the group members.
The Honor Code assumes that Stanford students
will behave honorably; it imposes an individual re
sponsibility for integrity, with third-person responsi
bility as a check in case of violations. But the point
is that it is individual.
The fact that violations are tried by a student
council instead of a faculty hoard is completely in
consequential. There used to be student government
without an honor system; there could as well be an
honor system without student government.
No one has suggested that. Men's and Women's
Councils or some other group should station official
student proctors in examination rooms. But when the
individual is forced to remain hi the room with his
test so that he may be undei the watchful eye of a
roomful of fellow students, is there really a differ
ence? The implication is the same: that be is too
"weak" to be trusted, that his honor is not, reliable.
Then where is your honor code?
Of course first-person responsibility is more basic
than third-person responsibility. This is no police
late Admittedly there are some who f■ iI to live up
to tlie individual trust they cannot be entirely

screened out, by third-person responsibility or any
other method.
But to maintain the proper attitude toward honor,
it is essential that no one wink or connive at the dis
honesty of another; that is the essence of the third
person responsibility clause.
Morally, the principle of the Honor Code is thrown
out the window when students are forbidden to take
exams from the classroom. But even practically
speaking, this plan is no solution. II an individual is
going to cheat, he may "take a break" in the middle
of an exam, look up the forgotten material, then write
it in his blue book upon returning to the room. Or
are we to be forced to sit through a four-hour final
with no break whatsoever? Where work other than
examinations is considered in grading, there will still
be opportunity to cheat.
We did not come to Stanford to be "protected."
We therefore submit that the "traditional privilege"
