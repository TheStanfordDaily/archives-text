HOW TO WRITE FOR PUBLICATION
Chapter 104
The Letter Co the Kditor
All of us have seen the person who sits at the
breakfast table muttering darkly over his porridge

because his name isn't in the
paper. He sees this as an atrocity.
He is a sophomore; why isn't, his
name in the paper? Probably be
cause he has not. been exercising
his privileges and writing letters
to the Editor.
A Letter to the Editor is not
hard to compose, and it guaran
tee:; publication ol one' name il
the letter is puhli: bed, especially
if one happens to he NAME

WITHHELD.
Piok a controversial topic Any controversial topic
is topic enough. Letters to. the Editor range from
dissertation on the noisy, crowded library stacks to
notes scribbled on cardboard with crayon and af
fixed to the editi.i â€¢; desk with a stiletto, reading
"11 you value youi life don't go near the Tues
day Evening Series
Cordially,
The Black Viper."
Most people who write letters to the editor like
to discuss I lie caliber of the newspaper's content:
"Sirra:
Vouv recent failure to print (lie KZSI! schedule

was a scandal of the very first order! Cancel my
subscription.
Irate "
or
"Gentlemen:
You reflpntly remark upon the new pay
telephone at The Knoll, quoting the price
as lifteen thousand dollars. The telephone
cost. $14.5)5. Business Office."
or
"Cats:
Whoever wrote up the concert sure was a ,
square. That stuff wasn't Ilinilcmith; that
was real groovy Duke Ellington, and man!
What a cool kick.
Ileal Clone Kahut."
Then there are people who comment on current
problems ori campus:
"To the Editor:
I live at. Stem Hall; what can you do
about the food?
Hungry."
Others concern themselves with Current Events:
"Editor:
Although 1 am a Democrat, 1 am tolerant
But. what can we do about Ike?
Adlai."
But regardless of your topic, make it controversial
and you too can write for The Daily. The Daily wants
more letters to the editor. The rules are simple:
Write in English and sign your name. II yon like the
mystic touch, add a note asking that your name be
withheld. But. bring it over! Helps till the column.
