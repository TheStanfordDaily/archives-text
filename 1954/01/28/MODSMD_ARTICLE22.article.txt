(Editor's note. The following is an excerpt from
a letter to Stanford's Berlin Affiliation Committee
from Joan Steindorf, a Stanford graduate now
studying at the Free University of Berlin.)
Before 1 arrived in Berlin, T expected to find a
city very much impoverished by I he effects of the
war, the blockade, and tin isolation from the West.
The southwest part of Berlin is truly beautiful. There
are many parks and even forests and lakes. On every
street there are workers piling rubble on trucks or
building or reconstructing buildings. Marshall Plan
signs are everywhere.
I visited what had once been the center of the
city. If one thinks of the buildings that once stood
in the heart of Berlin, one can imagine a capital city
that equaled the beauty ol Washington, D.C.,
London, or Paris. Now this center is in ruins; a
Communist parade ground stands where the
flohenzollerine Palace stood at the end of the
war. The old National iVluseiun of Art and the Dorn
are mere skeletons of what they once were. The
Reichschancellery is leveled with the exception of
two gigantic stones which mark what was once
the entrance to llithi's hunker. The Reichstag and
the Brandenburg Tor are surrounded by fields of
weeds and are now mere silhouettes in the shadow
of one of the Russian War Memorials.
There are the other indications of the new order:
1 he Garden of Memories, the Volkspolizei with their
submachine guns, Stalin Allee in a blaze of color from
red flags and signs, repeating their message over and
over again: "Russia is your friend," "The U.S. de
stroyed, the Soviet Union rebuilds."
The rubble Of (he surrounding area of Fast Ber
lin has not yet been cleared away, and (here are mi
signs of workers beginning to clear. The fallacy of
these signs. Hags and false fronts presented by
Stalin Allee may be obvious to tourists and the

adults living in the East, hut what effects do they
have upon the youth who knows only the Parly
truth?
Northwest and southwest of the old center of Ber
lin are the industrial areas of present day West
Berlin. Temporary buildings are gradually evacu
ated and people move into the new low rent govern
ment housing projects. Most oppressive in the land
scape of this area are the large man-made mounds
of rubble, which have been covered with dirt and
soil. They have been planted with trees and shrubs
and, in a few years, will be new park areas for the
people of Berlin.
Between the old city center and Dahlem is the new
main street of West Berlin: Kurfuerstendamm. Here
the most elegant stores, night clubs, and apartments
are located, and the lights are burning as brightly
as before the war and blockade.
It is too early to make generalizations about the
people in Berlin, but perhaps a lew impressions
might be interesting. From the stories I have heard,
it is easy to see that the Berlincrs have suffered
greatly during the war and occupation. It must
have been terrible, a city aflame for many nights;
the house-to-house, lighting; women and girls hid
den in cellars; treasured household possessions
stolen.
But in spite of their bitter experiences, the. Ber
liners reveal a sense of humor that cannot be equaled.
They face the future with an energy seldom to be
matched. They are very alert, industrious people.
The entire atmosphere of life in Berlin is quite dif
ferent from the easy-going, lusty life of the Rhine
area.
Berlin and the other parts of Europe which I have
visited have revealed to me how destructive man
made war can be and how the man on the street
bears the greatest amount of suffering resulting from
war.
