The greatest, of them all, though,
was Pop Warner, t he man who added
more innovations to the game of
lootball than any other man, living
or dead. It was Warner, now in his
eighties, who said:
"Bob has gotten the greatest ma
jority of votes for this award since
it was started live years ago. He
has been a great athlete, an ideal
youth, and an inspirational leader.
II is wil.li great pleasure thai I give
him this trophy and watch."
Frank ie Albert, the man to
whom all other "T" formation
quarterbacks are but an imitation,
said, "I rank the passing of Gar
ret! righl alongside thai of Olio
Graham and Y. A. Tittle, whom I
consider to he (he finest throwers
in football. I think I'll make my
self some money by becoming
Boh s agcnl for (he nexl ten
years."
Chuck Taylor was even more
emphatic in his praise: "Two sea
sons ago, he had injuries that neces
sitated operations on bis throwing
elbow and on his shoulder. Despite
this, he came back, took over the
team, and became the finest passer J
have ever seen, college or pro."
Pappy Waldorf, California's able
headman and one of the glibbest
peas and chicken circuit speakers
in the trade, said, "Bob Garrett is
perfection incorporated . . . the most
accurate passer I have ever seen.
I was told that he had no speed.
But he looked pretty fast to me
when he ran (it) yards after a pass
interception with what looked like
half the Stanford student body as
interference."
Joe Kuet/, Stanford line coach,
said, "The (hing you don'l hear

in iK'li about is Bolt's defensive
improvement. Against COP, his
defense left something to be de
sired. But he gradually improved,
and became a steady, sure tackier.
And most spectacular of all, he
not only led the nation in pass
ing, Inil also in pas-, interceptions."
The Pop Warner Award, one of
the most coveted in football, annu
ally goes 1.0 the best Pacific Coast
gridder. Previous winners have
been Ed Leßaron, Russ Pomeroy,
Ollie Matson, and Jim Sears.
