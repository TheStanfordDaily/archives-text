# Big Epp, Athlete of Week, Shows Class Against SJS
## 
### 
Stanford's cagers held a slim 20-
18 lead over San Jose State early
in the second quarter Tuesday night.
The ball club wasn't clicking and
Coach Bob Burnett in an attempt
to get his gang going inserted Dave
Epperson into the contest to give
the Indians some needed backboard
strength.
Burnett was pleasantly surprised
as the tJ-ft. 5Me-in. senior not only
grabbed oil more than his share
of rebounds, hut provided a much
needed scoring punch. OtV this
performance Epperson has been
chosen the Daily "Athlete of the
Week."
Tuesday night's effort was Epper
son's best in Stanford regalia. He
tallied 13 points, hitting six times
from the floor and once from the
charity stripe.

Epperson, the only married man
on the squad, displayed quite an
array of shots as he connected on
hooks, pops, and tap-ins.
The Woodland athlete has
amassed a total of 4(5 points for
I lie season anil has been the num
ber six man on the squad ever
sinee SuzdaletT was injured.
Epperson is a good bet to see
plenty of action against Santa Clara
at the Cow Palace Saturday night.
