# Three Alumni Members Will Join Trustee Board
## 
### 
The Stanford Alumni Association will co-operate fully with
the Board of Trustees in its plan for appointment of three "alumni
trustees" for five-year terms, President Russel V. Lee of Palo
Alto announced yesterday.
The plan calls tor addition of eight members to the present

15 - man Board of Trustees, with
three of the eight lo be direct rep
resentatives of the alumni.
Dr. Lee pointed out that, while
many universities throughout, the
United States have alumni repre
sentation on their boards of trustees,
this will mark a new and significant
departure for Stanford of great im -
portance to alumni
Since under Hie University
charier (lie Stanford trustees are
required to elect their own mem
bers, the Alumni Association Ex
ecutive Board would serve as a
screening committee to consider
nominations and submit a repre
sentative panel to the trustees.
From this panel the trustees would
elect the three alumni members,
who would have the same status as
other trustees with the exception
that they would serve tor live rath
er than ten years, and would not
be eligible for re-election as "alum
ni trustees." (But they could be
named to ten-year terms if desired.)
The trustees will have to get court
authorization to change the Found
ing Grant before this now plan can
be put into effect. The proposed
change received trustee approval last
week.
Dr. Lee cited the Alumni Asso
ciation Executive Board resolution
pledging co-operation to the Board
of Trustees project:
. . This board approves the
suggestion of a plan for election
or appointment of alumni of Stan

ford as members of the Stanford
Board of Trustees and if such a
plan is put into effect, the Stan
ford Alumni Association Execu
tive Board will accept the respon
sibility of nominating Stanford
alumni for consideration by the
Board of Trustees for such elec
tion or appointment."
Trustee President Lloyd W Din
kelspiel gave two reasons for for
mulation of the new plan:
I "To give more direct represen
tation on our board to our steadily
growing alumni body."
2. "To provide the board with
more manpower to handle the in
creasing load of work occasioned by
development of University lands,
fund raising, the decision to move
our Medical School, and other prob
lems."
