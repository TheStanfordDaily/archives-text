# Munger Cites Frictions Causing African Revolts
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
The Airican revolts ol the past, present, and future aie a direct
result ol the friction between the forces of education and agita
tion, Dr. Edwin S. Munger of the American Universities Field
Staff, declared today in the second in a series of AUFS lectures
being held in Cubberley Auditorium this winter. The topic of
his speech was "Africa in Revolt.''^

There is a tremendous thirst for
education in Africa, reflecting it
self in the fact that there are over
2,000 African students in African j
universities, GOO studying in the
United States and many more seek
ing entrance.
Coupled with this educational
stimulus, Dr. Munger said, is the
ever-increasing number of revolts
against European intervention into
African affairs.
Triluvs considered the most
primitive and culturally unde
veloped by the original settlers
arc now the most Europcanized
and strongly nationalistic, he
pointed out. These countries lack
ing in original culture were eager
to pick up influences of European
culture and its accompanying na
tionalistic trends.
Many of the African tribes are
looking to the United States for aid
in their revolts for independence.
They admire the American ideals
of freedom.
The methods of handling colonies
in Africa vary distinctly, Dr. Mun
ger said. The aim of the Portuguese
is to spread Christianity within the
colony and keep it as a territory of
Portugal; whereas Belgium rests
most importance upon establishing
a strong economic foundation for
eventual self - government. The
French are willing to grant personal
independence, but aim, above all,
to keep their colonies. The British,
he said, in contrast are preparing
their subjects for rapid emancipa
tion.
"The picture in regard to revolts
is, indeed, a pretty unhappy one,"
he declared. Often news of the most
serious revolts never reaches the
American people. For instance, very
little was mentioned by the Ameri
can press about a revolution in 1947
on the island of Madagascar in which
40,000 to 100,000 persons were killed.
The revolution which occurred
three years ago in the Gold Coast
was well handled by the British and
now this colony seems to be one of
Africa's "most glittering hopes for
self rule," he pointed out.
He described the Man Mau na
tinalist revolts in Kenya in which
a relatively small number of agi
tators are attempting to terrorize
the loyal natives into submission.
The well - publicized .atrocity
stories apply mostly to natives, as
only 2!) Europeans have been
killed in the duration of the Mau
Mau revolt. Although the Mau
Mans cannot possibly win by mili
tary force, he said, they arc at
tempting to induce an economic
depression in Kenya.
The revolution in the Union of
South Africa has possibilities of
being the most serious in the long
run, Dr. Munger said. It involves a
population of 8 million Africans and
i 2.5 million Europeans.
