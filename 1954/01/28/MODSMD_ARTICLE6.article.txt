# VA Inspects Hospital Site
## 
### 
Top Veterans Administration of
ficials visited campus on Tuesday to
inspect again the Stanford land
which has been proposed as a pos
sible site for a 1,000-bed VA psychi
atric hospital.
The land in question, which was
studied by a VA site selection team
last fall, is located behind the East
man Kodak plant southwest of
school.
Stanford administrators accom
panied the VA party on their tour.
The officials said they have not yet
received a "formal proposal" for
the land from the VA.
Although emphasizing that they
are still looking at sites all over
northern California, the VA officials
said they hoped to reach a decision
soon, perhaps within 30 days.
Construction of the $23 million
hospital may begin within six
months, they said.
Earlier reports have indicated
that Stanford's site may be favored
because of the Stanford Medical
School's plan to move to the cam
pus.
The VA party included Harvey
V. Higler, veteran's administrator,
Adm. Joel T. Boone, chief medical
director for the VA, a VA construc
tion and real estate man, and a top
public relations man.
They were accompanied by All'
E. Brandin, Stanford's executive of
ficer for land development; Provost
Douglas M. Whitaker; Dean Wind
sor C. Cutting of the medical school;
and Robert J. Wert, assistant to the
President.
