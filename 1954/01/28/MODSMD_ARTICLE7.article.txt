# BRICKER ACT
## Legislators Draft New Proposals 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (UP)-
Confident Republican leaders draft
ed a proposed substitute for the
controversial Bricker amendment
today as the Senate opened its new
"great debate" on the President's
treaty powers before packed gal
leries.
Senate "Dean" Walter F. George
(D., Ga.) beat the GOP to the punch,
however, by introducing his own
substitute which omits the contro
versial heart of Sen. John W. Block
er's proposed constitutional amend
ment to curb the chief executive's
treaty-making powers.
Republican leaders did not imme
diately make their substitute plan
public. They left the way open to
supporting George's plan later but
made it clear they expect to fight—
and defeat — the Bricker amend
ment.
George said his proposal "in sub
stance" is in line with what he dis
cussed recently with President Ei -
senhower, who has declared him
self "unalterably opposed" to the
Bricker amendment in its piesent
form.
George's substitute is designed to
meet the claims of many Bricker
amendment supporters that the
piesent constitution allows treaties
or other international agreements to
write domestic law for the United
States.
1. That a provision of a treaty oi
other international agreement, thai
conflicts with the constitution "shall
not be of any force or effect." This
is the same as the first part of the
Bricker amendment, except that
George added the words "other in
ternational agreement."
2. That an international agreement
other than a treaty "shall become
effective as internal law in the Unit
ed States only by an Act of the Con
gress." That would cover compacts
by international organizations such
as the United Nations.
