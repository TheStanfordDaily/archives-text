# Excom Will Lead Honor Code Study
## Series of Oilier Plans Rejected 
### BARBARA TUERK 
In a five hour session, which
lasted until 12:30 yesterday
morning, the Executive Commit
tee decided to undertake a study
of the whole Honor Code.
In rejecting a series of plans, mo
tions, amendments, and suggestions
designed to solve the issue of exam
inations leaving the classroom, Ex
com members concluded the campus
could not solve the examination is
sue until the whole Honor Code is
clarified and re-interpreted.
With ASSU President Don Lozab
nick casting the deciding ballot,
Excom approved 8 to 7 the following
motion by ASSU Vice-President
Jean Bobis:
"That we sponsor an educational
program with the Fundamental
Standard Committee as the core to
define and clarify basic concepts
of the existing Honor Code and
educate students in this 1954 in
terpretation through living group
discussions."
To supplement and elaborate Miss
Bobis's motion, Excom adopted two
other proposals.
The first, by Village representative
A 1 Ivey called "for the appointment
of three members of Excom to work
with the Fundamental Standard
Committee to set up procedure and
begin work on that procedure im
mediately."
The second, a clarification by
Men's Row representative Dave
Carr, said, "That the committee draw
up an interpretation of the Honor
Code, a set of questions to be put
before the students, a system to be
followed in the educational program,
and that this committee report to
Excom next week.
In moving the adoption of an ed
ucational program, Miss Bobis ex
plained:
"Since 1921 our interpretation or
the words in the Honor Code has
changed. It's a semantic difficulty.
We aren't sure what terms like
first person and third person re
sponsibility mean now. We need
to clarify in our own minds just
what the 1954 Code is, in order to
think about it positively and con
structively."
Need for clarification was expres
sed by several Excom members who
reported that most students with
whom they talked during the week
were generally dissatisfied with
most of the plans suggested and
were vague as to the tenets of the
Code.
Among the ideas rejected at last
night's meeting were:
1. The so-called Ivey Plan,
which would have permitted stu
dents to take examinations out of
the classroom unless the class pro
hibited this by class-vote.
2. A midnight proposal by Junior
Class representative Rudy Reich
that "the student has the right to
take the examination out of the
room; however the professor may
request that students not do so.
3. > Several suggestions that exams
be taken only to areas where third
person responsibility might operate.
John Spragucr, Sophomore Class
representative; Bob Mishell, Men's
Halls representative; and Alice
Kwong, Off-Campus representative
were appointed by Lozabnick yes
terday to work with the Fundamen
tal Standard Committee. Members of
the Fundamental Standard Commit
tee arc Janeen Knipe, Kathy Padget,
Jane Wood, and Phil Hicks, chair
man.
