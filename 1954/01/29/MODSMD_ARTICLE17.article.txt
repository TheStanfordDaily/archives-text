# Ike Predicts Quick End For Economic Dip

### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 (UP) —
President Eisenhower predicted to
day the current "minor" economic
dip will end soon and promised
"bold" government action to prop
up the economy if it doesn't.
Mr. Eisenhower made the state
ment in a 35,000-word economic re
port which touched of! a flurry of
debate in Congress. He said the na
tion is "marvelously prosperous"
and never was in better shape to
ward off a business downturn.
The President conceded there
are soft spots—particularly agri
culture. There also is the "psy
chological danger, he said, that
fear of a business slump may pro
mote one.
But he said the "current readjust
ment seems likely to be brief and
elf - correcting," particularly if
Congress enacts his program for
taxation, farm price supports, so
cial security, public works, and for
eign trade.
Sen. Arthur V. Watkins (R.,
Utah), a member of the Joint Con
gressional Economic Committee
which will hold full-dress hear
ings on the President's report start
ing tomorrow, called it a "strong
and frank" analysis.
The CIO, however, criticized
the fact that Mr. Eisenhower did
not advance specific recommen
dations for increasing the federal
minimum wage.
The President's chief economic
adviser, Dr. Arthur F. Burns, will
lead off testimony before the eco
nomic committee. He will be fol
lowed by 54 other government, bus
iness, labor, and farm experts. The
committee must submit its own re
port to Congress by March 1.
Mr. Eisenhower's report evidently
gave the stock market a boost after
some further irregularity in the
early tradings.
From noon, when the message
was released, the market picked up
in all sections.
