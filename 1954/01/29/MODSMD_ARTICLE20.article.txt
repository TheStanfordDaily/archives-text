# Strategy Switch Surprises West

### 
BERLIN, Jan. 28 (UP) —Russia
proposed a 1954 world confer
ence on reduction of armaments
tonight in a sudden switch of
strategy to lobby Communist
China into international council
chambers.
Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov
offered a resolution at the Big Four
conference calling for the disarma
ment parley within the framework
of the United Nations, but leaving
the door open to the Peiping regime.
Molotov sprang the first big .sin
prise of the Berlin conference jut.i
after the foreign ministers had
agreed to sidetrack until next week
his firmly rejected demand for a
five power meeting with China.
The decision followed a charge
by Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles that Molotov was trying to
wreck the U.N. and set up a world
council of five ruling nations to
supercede it.
The Western ministers agreed to
put Molotov's five-power demand on
ice in order to move on tomorrow to
the two main subjects of this meet
ing—settlements for Germany and
Austria.
But the Soviets made it plain they
would insist on debating tomorrow
Molotov's disarmament resolution.
An official U.S. spokesman sug
gested that Molotov's move took
the West by surprise. After of
fering it, he said, Molotov looked
"hopefully" around the room.
Dulles murmured something hi .
neighbors could not understand.
Georges Bidault of France threw hi:,
arms in the air and said, "None of
us will be able to sleep tonic,ht if
we take up this matter now." An
thony Eden of Britain said, "I ■
not prepared to comment on thi:>
matter at this time."
Thereupon Molotov, chairman of
this fourth session, adjourned it.
Molotov's resolution, delivered
to newsmen by his press chief,
Fedor Ilychev, said in part:
"The governments of the U.S.A.,
United Kingdom, France, and U.S -
S.R., guided by the desire to
strengthen peace and reduce ten
sions in international relations, cori
sidering it necessary to take meas
ures to relieve the heavy burden of
military expenditures borne by the
people in connection with the arm
aments race, have agreed that the
Soviet Union, the United Stater, of
America, the United Kingdom, an-1
France would take measures within
the framework of the United Na
tions to convene in 1954 a world con
ference on the general reduction of
armaments with the participation of
both members of the United Nations
and non-member states."
