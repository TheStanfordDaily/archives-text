# Goodbye and Good Luck
## 
### 
It isn't easy to chalk up the usual "30" for
Volume 124. The experience of editing 7U is
sues of the peninsula's only morning news
paper has been too happy, 100 satisfying, too
exciting a one simply to step out of so sud
denly.
The paper in our readers' hands Monday
morning will be "just another Dtiily" to them.
Yet to you—Win, Bob, and Barbie—it will be
the beginning of a great new experience.
Of course, all has not boon a bed of roses.
We've had our frustrations too. Problems
such iis lack of funds; lack of time necessary
to devote complete understanding to the doz

ens of sundry campus groups and interests
that deserve publicity; perennial careless
ness that permeates the ranks of any non
professional newspaper all these will con
tinue to plague you.
Your success as editors will be measured by
your ability to meet these problems. We be
lieve you can and will. And perhaps, here,
this advice might hold: Take your jobs seri
ously, but never yourselves.
At any rate, our thanks to you for a superb
performance as associate editors Win, Bob,
and Barbie. And good luck. Volume 125. •
Hadley Roff and Sue Wheat
