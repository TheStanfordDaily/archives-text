## Cellar 'Walk-Outs' 
### 
ro the Editor:
I noticed in The Daily that the Cellar has Jost over
!200 this school year due to "walk-outs." My con
cience hasn't left me alone since I read it. I must,
idmit I have been guilty, in my : mall way, of com
nit.ting pail ol this grand felony.
However, like many other patrons of the Cellar,
I am no hardened criminal. hilt merely a little
absent-minded. Somehow, between the time I get
m.v coffee, shoot the luill for an hour, and then
leave, I have forgotten (he little white slip in my

pocket marked "0 5," finding it a month or so later
when I wash my clothes. I am sure there are many
other of my fellow purloiners who have had similar
.experiences.
As a simple solution to the problem, may I suggest,
for their own protection and to save their patrons
anguish of conscience, that the Cellar corporation
eliminate the middle man, collect their money when
service is given out, and put the gal in the little glass
cage behind the counter to help serve coffee in the
j'ush hour. JACK WENNBERG
