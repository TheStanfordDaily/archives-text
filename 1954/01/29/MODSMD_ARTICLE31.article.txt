# Encina Cook Transforms Weedy Grounds to Garden
## 
### DAVE SCOTT 
Any person who has taken a close look at the outside of Encina
has probably noticed the flowers and garden surrounding the
building. They're due to the efforts o£ one man—a cook at En
cina. His name is Salvador Parisi.
Parisi's flowers border the south and west sides of Encina. On

the south side or back side lie two
neatly cultivated rows—pansies and
begonias, both of which are now
partially in bloom. On the west side
is a whole bed of flowers, daisies and
other small plants, whose shades of
brilliant yellow and orange spark
up the side of the building.
Every morning for two hours
Parisi works on the garden on his
own, and gets no pay for it.
When asked about this service
to Encina, Parisi shrugs liis shoul
ders modestly and says,"I enjoy
doing it. It's my hobby." lie says
that it is good to gel outside and
work in the morning.
Parisi, a native of Argentina, came
to Stanford as a cook five years ago.
In his native country he was a gram
mar school teacher, instructing the
first, second, and third grades. Here
also he did spare - time gardening
when he was not teaching.
Through a friend at Stanford, Pa
risi got. his job as assistant cook at
Encina. After working here for a
short while, he noticed that nobody
was taking care of the garden and
"it was all old weeds." Since then
he has spent many hours on it.
Parisi is looking forward with
,«reat anticipation to Feb. 24. "I
get my papers then and become a
citizen," proudly declares the

slight, pleasant - looking Argen
tine.
Parisi plans to be a cook for a few
more years while he learns the Eng
lish language a little better. "When I
learn English better, he said, "I
hope to teach Spanish." In the mean
time, he says, he likes hi.s cooking
job "very much."
