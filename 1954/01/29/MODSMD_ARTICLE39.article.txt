### DON WEBSTER 
Stanford quarterback Bob
Garrett was selected yesterday
by the Cleveland Browns as
the bonus choice in the profes
sional football player draft.
Garrett was one of four Card
gridders 1 c> be selected. The other
three were ends John Steinberg,
Sam Morley, and Marv Tennefoss.
Steinberg was the choice of the
New York Giants, Morley went to
the Washington Redskins, and
Tennefoss was selected by the
Green Bay Packers.
II all lour decide to enter the
pro football ranks, it will bring to
six the Stanford alumni in that
field. The two currently active are
Sail Francisco 4 tier guard Bruno
Banducci and Chicago Bear end
Bill McColl.
The team to get the bonus choice
was decided by lot among several
pro clubs. The Browns won and
■ elected Garrett.
According to Stanford coaches,
it was the best possible team to
select. Garrett. "Bob should be
truly great, with the Brown type
of Cup' protection they give their
pa sec , one of thein commented.
Garrett himself was over
joyed. ' ( am perfectly delighted
to have been chosen by the
Browns. ! consider Paul Brown
one of (fie great coaches in the
game."
His status with Uncle Sam?
Still uncertain, "I'm in the Air
ROTC, but it is still not sure
whether or riot I will be called."
With Cleveland, Garrett will be ,
one ol a trio of outstanding quar
ter backs. Otto G r a h a m , now
reaching the twilight of his ca
reer, and George Ratterrnan have

held the line for Brown. A num
ber of experts believe Brown will
be grooming the Stanford passer
to take over Graham's .spot as
quarterback.
It will be a far different type of
ofl'ense for Garrett to play with.
Though the offensive formations
are similar (featuring short
passes), Brown has always called
the plays from the sidelines, while
at Stanford Head Coach Chuck
Taylor gave him almost complete
freedom at directing the attack.
Anot h e r player joining the
,Browns will be Carlton Massey,
big Texas end who teamed with
Garrett to star in the Shrine
East-West game. Massey was se
lected last year by the Browns.

After the honus selection, each
team had a player selection.
Steinberg was chosen on the
tenth round. The lanky end said
he would he "perfectly willing
to play with the (iiunts, if it
can he worked out to finish my
engineering requirements while
doing so."
Steinberg said he would be will
ing lo finish at a school near to
the Giants, such as Columbia or
NYU.
The last-place Chicago Cardi
nals, who had the first choice of
the regular selections, made a sur
prise choice in picking quarter
back Lamar McHan from Arkan
sas. Baltimore then chose Francis
(Cotton) Davidson of Baylor.
