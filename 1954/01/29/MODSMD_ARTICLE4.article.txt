### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 (UP)—Sen. John W. Bricker (R-O.), re
jecting all compromise accused President Eisenhower today of
trying to defeat his proposed constitutional amendment with argu
ments that are "untrue . . . emotional" and "utterly without
foundation."
Backer fired his bristling charges at the President before a

packed gallery during the second
day of the Senate's "great debate"
on his amendment to limit the Chief
Executive's treaty - making powers.
His voice rose in anger several times
when he referred to the "unbending"
opposition of Secretary of State John
Foster Dulles.
"Although the President's motives
are, as always, sincere, his advisers
have sold him a bill of goods," the
one - time GOP vice presidential
nominee asserted.
Meantime, Senate Republican
leader William F. Knowland (Calif.)
worked late into the night with other
Senate leaders seeking agreement
on a bi-partisan substitute for
Bricker's proposal. Knowland said
he expects the substitute to be in
troduced tomorrow.
Knowland made an unscheduled
visit to the White House with
chairman Eugene I). Millikan
(Colo.) of the GOP conference
committee and chairman Homer
Ferguson (Mich.) of the Republi
can policy committee. The three
Republicans then held a lengthy
conference with Senate Demo
cratic leader Lyndon B. Johnson
(Tex.) and Sen. Walter F. George
(I)-Ga.).
Knowland said he hopes to get
the President's backing for whatever
compromise agreement is reached
by the Senate leaders. While Mr.
Eisenhower is "unalterably" opposed
to the Bricker amendment as it now
stands, he has said he will compro
mise.
