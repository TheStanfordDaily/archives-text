# PUNTS AND PITCHES

### Pete Grothe 
Dear Phil:
To mo t of the students on campus, this is a day like any other. But j
to those of us on The Daily, it is a (lay not insignificant. It is the day when J
We change volumes, when you, the' new blood take over for those of us
who, like General Mac Arthur, should rightfully fade away. As you know,
it is the custom of the outgoing sports editor to write an open letter to
the man who will succeed him. Thus, we would like to get a few thoughts
oil' our chest before we relinquish the reins to you.
Tt ,1 " c *" loon policy this last volume to provide a comfortable balance

of campus and national sports news. We have tried to
see .that sports like soccer didn't get the squeeze be
cause of football play. And whenever possible, we
have tried to give murals good play. We have not
always been successful in carrying out this policy, but,
at least, it is an ideal we have striven for. For those
who like to digest their sports through cartoons, we
have put three highly able artists, Ron Freund, Eileen
Conaghan, Bob Haydock, to work and their front page
cartoons, portraits, and "Athlete ol the Week" draw
ings have been superb.
As our stint as sports editor is on its deathbed, we

(in ! help hut think ol the great athletes it's been our pleasure to watch: j
Boh Matliias, right now the best all-around athlete in the world; Bobby
(Barrett, the most accurate passer in foothalidom; Bill McColl, Hit- gar
gantuan end nied student with llu- ama/.ing hands; Boh Murphy and Jack
Shepard, the greatest pitchhig-eatchiug combination that Stanford has
ever known;
Gary Kerkorian, Harry Hugasian, and Norm Manoogian, three Armeni
ans who were intensely colorful athletes; Bob Simon, Howie Hertz, Sam
Moi'ley, Phil Wilson, Eric Soulhwood, Ron Cook, Ed Tucker, Jim Walsh,
Russ Pomeroy, Jim Ramstead, Ron Tomsie, George Selleck, Russ Lawler,
Joe Chez, and Je.ss Cone.
Dick Horn, Bob Meyers, Leo Long, Otis Chandler, Larry Heim, Bob
Frojen, Ted Tanner, Skip Crist, John Steinberg, Warren Goodrich, Olie
SuzdalefT, and so many, many more.
The above-mentioned have been more than outstanding competitors on
the field of athletic battle; call it trite if you will, but they have also re
flected the high sportsmanship which has been characteristic of Stanford
athletes. If you want a good contrast, just visit a school about 500 miles
to the S(juth.
Phil, always appreciate the coaches here a( Stanford. We wouldn't
trade them for any other couching stall' in the nation. Men like Chuck
Taylor, Dutch reining, Joe Ruetz, Everett Dean, Bob Burnett, Ray Dean
Pete Kmetovic. George Lynn, Tom Haynie, Ray Lunny, Bud Finger, Bob
Ghilotti, Dick Clegg, and Mai Elward are great in the true meaning of
thai much overworked word. My everlasting thanks go to them for Ihe
help and cooperation they have extended to us.
Also a nod to Al Masters, Don Liebendorfer, and Connie Jarvis. Masters
has a job in which there is no thanks or glory; he takes a difficult, thankless
task, and does an able job of it. Ljebendorfer, the Athletic News Publicist,
does better than bis compatriots who have much more financial and worker
assistance.
Connie Jarvis, one of the finest men that we know, is not. only the best
news source in the athletic department; he also is one of America's most
capable trainers.
And, finally, Phil, appreciate your staff to the hilt. Our abundant thanks
go to iron-man Bill Wright, efficient Russ Wilks, Elmore Seeds, Don
Stephen. l Irwin Johnson, Vic Casebolt, Dick Koenigsberger, Homer Smith,
and Ray Loynd. And to reporters Bob Durand, Ray Waddington, Bill
Jones, Neil MacPhail, Steve Hill, Frank Cancino, and Logan Pazdral. And
last and certainly least., to Lee Hansen, the girl who, with infinite courage,
has bucked a tradition and joined sports staff. Surprisingly, she has out
shone most of the men.
Well, that's about all, Phil. And if anyone ever tells you that I didn't
mean,well in my own simple way, kick 'em in the teeth for me, will yn?
The best ol luck to you and the sports staff in the next volume.
Sincerely,
Pete

Dick Horn, Bob Meyers, Leo Long, Otis Chandler, Larry Heim, Bob

The above-mentioned have been more than outstanding competitors on
the field of athletic battle; call it trite if you will, but they have also re
flected the high sportsmanship which has been characteristic of Stanford
athletes. If you want a good contrast, just visit a school about 500 miles
to the S(juth.
Phil, always appreciate the coaches here a( Stanford. We wouldn't
trade them for any other couching stall' in the nation. Men like Chuck
Taylor, Dutch reining, Joe Ruetz, Everett Dean, Bob Burnett, Ray Dean
Pete Kmetovic. George Lynn, Tom Haynie, Ray Lunny, Bud Finger, Bob
Ghilotti, Dick Clegg, and Mai Elward are great in the true meaning of
thai much overworked word. My everlasting thanks go to them for Ihe
help and cooperation they have extended to us.
Also a nod to Al Masters, Don Liebendorfer, and Connie Jarvis. Masters
has a job in which there is no thanks or glory; he takes a difficult, thankless
task, and does an able job of it. Ljebendorfer, the Athletic News Publicist,
does better than bis compatriots who have much more financial and worker
assistance.
Connie Jarvis, one of the finest men that we know, is not. only the best
news source in the athletic department; he also is one of America's most
capable trainers.
And, finally, Phil, appreciate your staff to the hilt. Our abundant thanks
go to iron-man Bill Wright, efficient Russ Wilks, Elmore Seeds, Don
Stephen. l Irwin Johnson, Vic Casebolt, Dick Koenigsberger, Homer Smith,
and Ray Loynd. And to reporters Bob Durand, Ray Waddington, Bill
Jones, Neil MacPhail, Steve Hill, Frank Cancino, and Logan Pazdral. And
last and certainly least., to Lee Hansen, the girl who, with infinite courage,
has bucked a tradition and joined sports staff. Surprisingly, she has out
shone most of the men.
Well, that's about all, Phil. And if anyone ever tells you that I didn't
mean,well in my own simple way, kick 'em in the teeth for me, will yn?
The best ol luck to you and the sports staff in the next volume.

Dear Phil:
To mo t of the students on campus, this is a day like any other. But j
to those of us on The Daily, it is a (lay not insignificant. It is the day when J
We change volumes, when you, the' new blood take over for those of us
who, like General Mac Arthur, should rightfully fade away. As you know,
it is the custom of the outgoing sports editor to write an open letter to
the man who will succeed him. Thus, we would like to get a few thoughts
oil' our chest before we relinquish the reins to you.
Tt ,1 " c *" loon policy this last volume to provide a comfortable balance

of campus and national sports news. We have tried to
see .that sports like soccer didn't get the squeeze be
cause of football play. And whenever possible, we
have tried to give murals good play. We have not
always been successful in carrying out this policy, but,
at least, it is an ideal we have striven for. For those
who like to digest their sports through cartoons, we
have put three highly able artists, Ron Freund, Eileen
Conaghan, Bob Haydock, to work and their front page
cartoons, portraits, and "Athlete ol the Week" draw
ings have been superb.
As our stint as sports editor is on its deathbed, we

(in ! help hut think ol the great athletes it's been our pleasure to watch: j
Boh Matliias, right now the best all-around athlete in the world; Bobby
(Barrett, the most accurate passer in foothalidom; Bill McColl, Hit- gar
gantuan end nied student with llu- ama/.ing hands; Boh Murphy and Jack
Shepard, the greatest pitchhig-eatchiug combination that Stanford has
ever known;
Gary Kerkorian, Harry Hugasian, and Norm Manoogian, three Armeni
ans who were intensely colorful athletes; Bob Simon, Howie Hertz, Sam
Moi'ley, Phil Wilson, Eric Soulhwood, Ron Cook, Ed Tucker, Jim Walsh,
Russ Pomeroy, Jim Ramstead, Ron Tomsie, George Selleck, Russ Lawler,
