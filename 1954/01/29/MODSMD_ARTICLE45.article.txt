The Stanford varsity rugby team will meet the S.m I'rancisco
Olympic Club on the rugby lield behind the sunken baseball dia
mond at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow. This practice game will mark the
opening of the rugby season in Northern California.
The Olympic Club should provide a stiff opening test for the

Card scrum line. Year in and year
out the strength of the Flying "O's"
has been in their big, experienced
scrums. Former Stanford men who
will probably start in the Olympic
Club line include Dave Brown, Dick
Hughes, Darrell Dentoni, Sarge Lit
tlehale, and John Rosecrans.
The aggressiveness and hustle that
has been displayed on the Card field
this week should offset the lack of
height and comparative inexperi
ence of the Indian scrums.
I!ol> Long, Hud Standifer, Paul
Kevak. Holt Brum, Don Carswell,
Dick Abraham, Hon Hush, and
Dick IVlonleitii are currently the
scrum first-stringers. Long, Hush,
Kevak, and Monteith were 011 last
season's football (earn, while Abra
ham is a giacl student who was a
regular on the '!»() foootball team.
Standifer is the most experienced
player and a mainstay in the
scrum.
In the backfield Stanford should
have a clear edge over the Olympic
Club because of a host of good backs.
It has been a long time since Coach
Kmetovic has seen the likes of this
season's backfield strength.
Sam Thornton, Juan Reynaud,
Sam Morley, Ron Cook, Dorsey At
kinson, Jim Stewart, and Don Muel
ler are tentative starters in the back
field. Cook and Atkinson are stal
warts from last year, while Reynaud
is a rugby player who learned the
game in his native Argentina.
A practice game with the Palo
Alto Ramblers will follow the first

♦
game. The Ramblers liould test the
overall strength and depth of the
Buck reserves. Dixon Smith, Bud
Carr, Mike Berberian, and Phil
Backer should see plenty of action
in this game if they are not u: ed
against the Olympic Club.
