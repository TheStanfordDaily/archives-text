An age-old rivalry on the bas

row night at the Cow Palace
when Stanford meets powerful
Santa Clara.

ford's speed and fast break against
Santa Clara's height and play

and deliberate.
The Cards, on the upsurge after
three wins in a row, will face an
aggregation that is essentially the
same team that flashed its way into
the quarter and semi-finals of the
NCAA tourney for the last two
years.
The Indians will be strengthened,
however, by the return of guard

appearance in the California series).
Suzdaleff is still a questionable
starter but will definitely see some
action, Coach Bob Burnett indi
cated.
Paced by (i-foot 9-inch All
American candidate Kenny Sears,
the proverbial 'Big Cat,' Santa
Clara has so far chalked up a 10
and three overall record and leads
the California Basketball Associ
ation standings with four straight
wins.
Although idle for the last two
weeks because of final examinations,
Bob Feerick's Broncos will enter the
game for the first time in six weeks
in prime physical condition. Sears
appears to have shaken off a back
injury, and guard Dick Garibaldi is
running again after a serious throat
infection.
Stanford will enter the game as
underdog. The Cards downed their
first nine opponents, but were then
struck by the injury jinx, and now
sport a thirteen and three record.
Under a tremendous handicap be
cause of injuries, Burnett appears
to have partially filled the gap left
by the loss of forward Ron Tomsic.
Barry Brown has been a steadily
improving performer at the forward
spot.
With the return of Suzdaleff,
the likewise improving Ron Wag
ner, and the already - proven
George Selleck, the Indians are at
near top strength at guard.
Burnett is expected to call on
either Suzdaleff or Wagner and Sel
leck at guards; Russ Lawler at cen
ter; Don DeLong and Brown at for
ward, with the fast improving Ep
person slated to see considerable
action in the event that Bronco
height proves damaging.
Feerick, despite Garibaldi's come
back, is expected to start the same
five who did so well in the tight
54-52 decision over USF: Seal's and
Jim Young at forward; Mickey
Mount at center; Gary Gatzert arid
Don Benedetti at guard.
The varsity game follows a fresh
man game between the two schools.
