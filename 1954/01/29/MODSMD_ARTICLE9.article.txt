# Willsrud Saves Poor Production of 'Eden'
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
The Stanford Players' current
production of Moss Hart's "The
Climate of Eden" is an ambitious
venture into philosophical com
edy-drama. Unfortunately, how
ever, the final effect is more talky
than philosophical, more melo
dramatic than dramatic, and only
occasionally comic.
Part of the trouble undoubtedly
lies in the play itself. Hart's long
pscudo - philosophical digressions
would be dull in any production,
and his tendency toward melo
drama would be difficult to con
ceal. The story moves slowly and
in all directions; one is never quite
sure who is supposed to be the
central character. ,
The play comes to life only
when Hart drops his pretensions
and writes conventional comedy
on his theme of sexual unconven
tionality. That erstwhile high
comedy writer Hart should con
sider "The Climate of Eden" his
best play only goes to show that
most authors arc incredibly poor
judges of their own work.
The chief interest of the play,
then,, is in its characters; but, with
one notable exception, the Stan
ford Players fail to create charac
ter.
The one exception is Astrid
Willsrud. As Olivia, a precocious
little girl on the brink of adoles
cence, she brings a depth of feel
ing and a dimension of reality to
the play that it otherwise lacks.
She is alternately funny, touching,
infuriating, and pathetic. She cre
ates a real and important person
ality.
Whatever life and movement
the play may have, it owes largely
to Miss Willsrud. Her perform

ance may not be perfect—it is a
little overly arch in the first
scenes, a little overly intense in
the last—but it is of thoroughly
professional caliber. In the con
text of the present production, it
is something of a triumph.
As the Rev. Mr. Harmston, Ros
siter Durfee enunciates his lines
clearly and with a usually pleas
ant inflection. He simply fails,
however, to create any particular
character, much less one of stature
enough to make his role believ
able. The extraordinary Mr.
Harmston becomes a nonentity.
Richard Learman, in the crucial
role of Gregory, struggles bravely
with the big dramatic scenes, but
his unfortunate habit of postur
ing and declaiming lends little
creditability to his efforts.
Virginia Steward as Mabel is
adequate, if not inspired, as are
Kathleen Duffy, Lawrence Lar
more, and Wallace Whipple as the
rest of the Harmston family. Da
vid Penhallow's Logan is unusual
to say the least.
The quality of the technical de
tails varies. The unit set is hand
some and remarkably uncluttered
for so small a stage. The lack of
a curtain is, however, often some
what distracting. The staging of
the "big scenes" seems unneces
sarily stereotyped, and the lush
musical backgrounds are some
times reminiscent of the silent
movies.
"The Climate of Eden," despite
Miss Willsrud's efforts, makes on
the whole for an only spasmodi
cally interesting evening. As pre
sented by the Stanford Players, it
seems a drama of character with
too much melodrama and not
enough character.

edy-drama. Unfortunately, how
ever, the final effect is more talky
than philosophical, more melo
dramatic than dramatic, and only
occasionally comic.
Part of the trouble undoubtedly
lies in the play itself. Hart's long
pscudo - philosophical digressions
would be dull in any production,
and his tendency toward melo
drama would be difficult to con
ceal. The story moves slowly and
in all directions; one is never quite
sure who is supposed to be the
central character. ,
The play comes to life only
when Hart drops his pretensions
and writes conventional comedy
on his theme of sexual unconven
tionality. That erstwhile high
comedy writer Hart should con
sider "The Climate of Eden" his
best play only goes to show that
most authors arc incredibly poor
judges of their own work.
The chief interest of the play,
then,, is in its characters; but, with
one notable exception, the Stan
ford Players fail to create charac
ter.
The one exception is Astrid
Willsrud. As Olivia, a precocious
little girl on the brink of adoles
cence, she brings a depth of feel
ing and a dimension of reality to
the play that it otherwise lacks.
She is alternately funny, touching,
infuriating, and pathetic. She cre
ates a real and important person
ality.
Whatever life and movement
the play may have, it owes largely
to Miss Willsrud. Her perform

ance may not be perfect—it is a
little overly arch in the first
scenes, a little overly intense in
the last—but it is of thoroughly
professional caliber. In the con
text of the present production, it
is something of a triumph.
As the Rev. Mr. Harmston, Ros
siter Durfee enunciates his lines
clearly and with a usually pleas
ant inflection. He simply fails,
however, to create any particular
character, much less one of stature
enough to make his role believ
able. The extraordinary Mr.
Harmston becomes a nonentity.
Richard Learman, in the crucial
role of Gregory, struggles bravely
with the big dramatic scenes, but
his unfortunate habit of postur
ing and declaiming lends little
creditability to his efforts.
Virginia Steward as Mabel is
adequate, if not inspired, as are
Kathleen Duffy, Lawrence Lar
more, and Wallace Whipple as the
rest of the Harmston family. Da
vid Penhallow's Logan is unusual
to say the least.
The quality of the technical de
tails varies. The unit set is hand
some and remarkably uncluttered
for so small a stage. The lack of
a curtain is, however, often some
what distracting. The staging of
the "big scenes" seems unneces
sarily stereotyped, and the lush
musical backgrounds are some
times reminiscent of the silent
movies.
"The Climate of Eden," despite
Miss Willsrud's efforts, makes on
the whole for an only spasmodi
cally interesting evening. As pre
sented by the Stanford Players, it
seems a drama of character with
too much melodrama and not
enough character.
The Stanford Players' current
