# Broncos Pull Away From Cards, 69-58
## Last Quarter Spurt Tells 
### ELMORE SEEDS 
A potent Santa Clara squad
came throucjh with one of its
better performances of the sea
son Saturday night to dump
Stanford, 60-58, before 3,360 in
the Cow Palace.
Paced by All-American candidate
Ken Sears, tiie Broncos turned what
was a tight ball game for three
quarters into a convincing win.
Sears pumped home 27 points,
high foi the ;ame, lie:.ides doing
yeoman work on the boards. Little
Geoigie Sellecl topped the Card
scorers with IV markers
Santa Clara appeared to be up
to its neck when the Indians raced
to a 12 I lead after four minutes
and a IH-M first-quarter margin.
Stanford was out-hustling, out
rebounding, ou(-defensing, out
shooting the Broncs.
But the complexion of the game
changed completely as Santa Clara
found the range and the Cards lost
it. The Cards hit on only 21 per
cent of their shots fr >:n the floor.
The Broncos grabbed a .'>2-28 ad
vantage al the half, fought off a brief
Card rally in the third stanza for a
two-point, tH If) lead at the three
quarter mark, and then pulled away,
in the linal period, outscoring the
Indians, 21 12.
A total of II! fouls were railed
in the game. The Broncos lost
both their centers, llerli Schocn
stcin and Mickey Mount, via the
five-foul route. Selleck also fouled
on' late in the fourth canto.
Besides Sears' high scoring pei -
formance, forward Jim Young and
guard Don Benedel.ti played out
standing ball for Santa Clara. Young
controlled more than his share of
rebounds and was flitting the bucket
from all corner:; of the court.
Bcnedetti dazzled the.- crowd with
a time-wasting display of one-man
ball control in the final minutes.
"Without him, the Broncos' deliber
ate style of "slow cm down" ball,
which worked so well in the final
quarter, would be lost.
Selleck displayed his usual tre
mendous hustle and all around
floor play to go with his deadly
shooting eye.
Dave Epperson was about the
only other Stanforditc who could
hit his hat, and most of his scor
ing came on I!) of 18 foul shots. He
liit three times Ironi the floor for
a total of Mi points.
Stanford's ball handling, and even
the rebounding, showed improve
ment over previous games, but very
few teams can hit. only 21 per cent
of its shots and hope to beat a ball
club of Santa Clara's caliber.
The victory was only the second
for a California Basketball Associa
tion team over a Pacific Coast Con
ference club thi., season.
California dropped its first game
to USF.
The Indians will return to con
ference action nt :t week end with
a pair of tilts against UCLA's dis
appointing Bruins in the tiny Wi-sl
wood gym.
