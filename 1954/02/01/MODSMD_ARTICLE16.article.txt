## All-German Government Expected To Be Soviet Unification Proposal 
### 
BERLIN, Jan. 31 (UP)—The Big Four Foreign Ministers headed |
today into a showdown on Germany as they perpared to shit; J
their meetings from the U.S. sector to the Soviet Embassy in Eat J
Berlin.
V. M. Molotov announced he would present Russia's plan foil
Germany at the first meeting in the new site today at 3 p.m. (9 a.n |
EST). Communist propaganda blasts made it plain he would!

demand an all-German government
as the initial move toward unifi.ea-1
tion.
The ministers took their first full
day's recess of the con yes
terday. But Western exerts met to
solidify and synchronize anew their
solid front on how Germany should
be reunited.
"The debris has been cleared
away," a Western diplomat said.
"Now we shall get down to business
today."
Authoritative sources reported
that the Western delegations were
agreed on the following conclusion *
from the first week of the meeting
1. The pace of the conference
was far better than they had dared
to hope.
2. The unity of Hie West held
firm and now is stronger than a<
the start of the conference. France
turned a deaf ear to Soviet hints
at a possible Indo-Chinese peace
resulting from a Big Five mediae;
with Red China. Britain gave
Molotov little encouragement in
his beckoning for new Western
trade.
3. The dominating issue of the
conference — Germany — has been
joined, and the ministers now are
ready to come to grips with the
problem.
Anthony Eden of Britain pre
sented the West's blueprint, for Ger
man unity and sovereignty Friday.
It called for free elections and fi
nally an all - German government
with which a peace treaty would be
negotiated.
The United States, Britain and
France were said to be in agreement,
that the best place to test. Soviet in
tentions would be in secret meeting .
Their view was that the regular
sessions, with reports going to the
more than 1,000 newsmen here,
tended to turn the conference into
a propaganda forum.
Certain "restricted" sessions will
be held this week. Only the four
ministers and two or three advis
ors each will meet. The West
agreed to keep the sessions as
secret as possible. If the Russians
decide to let out word of the pro
ceedings, the West will take that
to be a propaganda move and act
accordingly, informed sources said.
The ostensible purpose of the se
cret talks will be to discuss Molo
tov's demands for a five-power con
ference with China and for a world
disarmament conference. Both topics
were put over until the restricted
gathering this week.
