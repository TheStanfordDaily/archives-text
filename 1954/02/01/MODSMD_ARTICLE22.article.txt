# The 						Honor Code and Discussion
## 
### 
The Daily, by agreement within its Editorial
Board and staff, realizes two basic responsibili
ties as a newspaper in the Stanford community.
The first is to inform, to report as accurately
and fairly as possible the events of -the campus
and the news of the world.
. The second (and egually important respon
sibility) is to provide the students of Stanford
with the facts and ideas which are necessary
lor their own thought and discussion on the sig
nificant issues of the day.
One of those issues, we believe, is the pres
ent status of the Stanford Honor Code. It has
become an issue which involves more than the
settlement of a procedural problem of exami
nations. It has become an issue in which the
students and faculty are attempting to define
<j concept and philosophy which lie at the root
ol the life of this University.

And as such, it is an issue which demands
discussion and thought by the students and,
faculty. The Daily emphatically rejects the
attitude exemplified by recent comments of
"dlisqussion will kill the HonoS" Code" and
"let's just forget about the whole thing." In
stead, The Daily maintains that discussion and
thinking on the Honor Code should continue,
that a proper definition of the Honor Code can
not be achieved without discussion, and that
only by the expression of student opinion can
the Executive Committee reach a fair and rep
resentative decision on the Honor Code issue.
For these reasons, we will continue to pre
sent as much of that opinion and discussion as
our mechanical limitations permit. And we will
continue to hope that the students and faculty
give strong attention to the Honor Code and to
all such issues which are significant lo their
own lives and the life of Stanford.
