# They Need Our Funds

The Winter Quarter Charity Drive begins
today, and once again the students of Stanford
are being asked to contribute to the funds of
several worthwhile organizations.
And once again this editorial column adds
its opinion that the efforts of the ASSU Drives
Committee are being well spent. The desig
nated recipients of this year's drive are the
Community Chest and the Heart and Cancer

Funds. The values of the work of these or
ganizations gannot be guestioned. The need
for contributions is apparent.
The work in research and welfare which
these organizations perform can continue only
by contributions to such drives as the one here
this week. That work must continue. Those
contributions must continue.
We urge each student to give generously.
