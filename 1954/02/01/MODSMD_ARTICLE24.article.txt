## On Student Government 
### 
To the Editor:
IS STANFORD STUDENT GOVERNMENT
WORKING EFFECTIVELY?
Many might answer "yes," perhaps more would
say "no," and some might even query "What student
government?" If we hold that the activities outside
tlie academic realm are important and can be a
valuable creative experience for those that partici
pate in them, then it would seem desirable that these
activities function with a goal in mind, and that a
maximum of efficiency and a minimum of frustration
be had in the attainment of such goals.
In conducting a voluntary organization such as
(he ASSU and the various administrative hoards,
it is undoubtedly most desirable (bat various func
tional areas such as Foreign Scholarship and Card
inals operate with as much decentralization as pos
sible. By so doing, these groups can operate with
a maximum creative experience for their partici
pants. However, with decentralization there must
come coordination so that there can lie overall in
tegration of ideas and programs in order to secure
,'ffiriency.
Under the present, framework of the ASSU. it is
impossible to secure such coordination or long-range
planning. All the legislative and executive powers
of the Association are vested in the popularly elected
Executive Committee. The ASSU President is not
the master of his administrative house! Is it right

for the valuable time of the Executive Committee to
he taken up with such routine matters as a recital
of webk end pai'ties for rubber-stamp approval? What
are the proper functions of elected representatives?
Should not their task be to investigate, plan, and
legislate overall policies which then could be left,
to an administrative branch for implementation?
There is a need for an impartial study of the top
superstructure of the ASSU to:
1. Analyze and define the proper relationship of
elected representatives to the total organization.
2. Define the lines of authority between the ASSU
President and other administrative officers ami
agencies.
Analyze the present structure to see if all
functions that a coordinating body should under
take, such as integrated personnel recruitment,
are being fulfilled.
4. Ascertain the role of the judicial branch to
student government as a whole.
Many more problems calling for a careful study
could be posed—but it. must be up to the students of
Stanford to decide through their elected representa
tives if the challenge ahead to make student, govern
mnt effective is worth the effort involved!

a maximum creative experience for their partici
pants. However, with decentralization there must
come coordination so that there can lie overall in
tegration of ideas and programs in order to secure
,'ffiriency.
Under the present, framework of the ASSU. it is
impossible to secure such coordination or long-range
planning. All the legislative and executive powers
of the Association are vested in the popularly elected
Executive Committee. The ASSU President is not
the master of his administrative house! Is it right

for the valuable time of the Executive Committee to
he taken up with such routine matters as a recital
of webk end pai'ties for rubber-stamp approval? What
are the proper functions of elected representatives?
Should not their task be to investigate, plan, and
legislate overall policies which then could be left,
to an administrative branch for implementation?
There is a need for an impartial study of the top
superstructure of the ASSU to:
1. Analyze and define the proper relationship of
elected representatives to the total organization.
2. Define the lines of authority between the ASSU
President and other administrative officers ami
agencies.
Analyze the present structure to see if all
functions that a coordinating body should under
take, such as integrated personnel recruitment,
are being fulfilled.
4. Ascertain the role of the judicial branch to
student government as a whole.
Many more problems calling for a careful study
could be posed—but it. must be up to the students of
Stanford to decide through their elected representa
tives if the challenge ahead to make student, govern
mnt effective is worth the effort involved!
