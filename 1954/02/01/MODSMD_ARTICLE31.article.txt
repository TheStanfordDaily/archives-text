# Lowell Thomas, on S.F. Visit, Describes 'Tremendous Potentialities' of Cinerama
## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
Lowell Thomas, radio com- j
mentator, author, correspond
eat, producer ol motion pictures,
explorer, and world traveler, vis
ited San Francisco in a whirl
wind tour last week.
He took time out from a crowded
schedule tu explain to representa
tives from a group of Bay Area
newspapers, including The Daily,
the past history and future plans of
Cinerama, the new film medium
that Thomas described as "enabling j
the viewer to be 'on the spot' with I
the camera."
The t>2 - year - old Thomas, who,
despite his extensive travels, has !
managed to maintain a 22-year rec
ord of a live-times-a-week, twice- i
nightly news, broadcast and a 17-
year record of work for F'ox Movie
tone News, is the vice-president of
the Board of Cinerama Production
Corporation and co-producer and
narrator ol "This Is Cinerama," now
playing at the Orpheum Theater in
San Francisco.
This first Cinerama production,
co-produced by Thomas and Me
riam Cooper, has as its purpose
the demonstration of what the
Cinerama camera can do under
various conditions. Scenes from
the movie include shots of the
I.a Scala opera house in IVlilan,
scenes from a gondola in Venice,
and an airplane's-eye view of the
United States.
The brain child of Fred Waller
arid Hazard Reeves, Cinerama was
first shown to Thomas several years
ago. Thomas said he quickly

grasped its "tremendous potentiali- i
ties."
"Hollywood moguls had been in
to see it, had marveled, and didn't
know what to do with it," Thomas
recalled. "So 1 went to work with
Meriam Cooper to get Cinerama out
of the laboratory and into the mo
tion pieture theaters."
Thomas himself supervised the
European portion of the film, while

Cooper attended to the scenes shot
in the United States and wove the
film into a complete unit.
The realism of the roller-coast
er and plane ride sequences was
so great that, when the show
opened in New York, a nurse was
in attendance ready to give dra
mamine to theater patrons, Thom
as remarked.
At present, not too many theaters

are showing Cinerama, mainly be- j
cause of the costs involved in con- j
verting a theater to the demands of
the new medium- A semi-circular I
screen must be erected and seats ,
torn out to make room for the two |
side projectors which, combined j
with the image from the center pro- i
jector, give the three-dimensional I
effect of completely surrounding the I
viewer with sound and picture.
"If you want to compare Cin- J
ernma to the old-fashioned mo- ,
tion pictures," Thomas said, "it's j
the difference between ordinary
vision in which you see out of the
corners of your eyes, and looking
through a keyhole."
"II owe v e r„" he emphasized, .
"Cinerama should not he thought
of as competition (o Cinemascope i
or the regular movies. It's a to
tally new medium."
A new Cinerama production, en
titled "Thrills of Your Life" and
patterned on similar lines to "This
Is Cinerama," has already been
produced, but it may not be re
leased for some time since, accord
ing to Thomas, "the present show
looks as if it might run indefinitely."
In spite of the fact that Ciner
ama could be used to tell regular
screen plots, Thomas would like
to keep one-half to one-third of
the productions in the non-fiction
field, although not necessarily
travelogues.
He imagines something along the
lines of his early film "With Law
rence in Arabia, and Allenby in
Palestine," the first, movie to com
bine narration, sound, and music.
"I'd really like to do something
daring with Cinerama," he con
fided. "Something that no one else
has attempted to do. Maybe take
J a play like "Porg.v and Bess" ami
shoot it from the stage, combin
ing the theater and Hollywood."
Thomas expressed great faith in
the potentialities of Cinerama. He
indicated that the movies hud made
steady advances with the inventions
of sound and color, and Cinerama
marks a great step forward in the
art of motion picture story telling.

tives from a group of Bay Area
newspapers, including The Daily,
the past history and future plans of
Cinerama, the new film medium
that Thomas described as "enabling j
the viewer to be 'on the spot' with I
the camera."
The t>2 - year - old Thomas, who,
despite his extensive travels, has !
managed to maintain a 22-year rec
ord of a live-times-a-week, twice- i
nightly news, broadcast and a 17-
year record of work for F'ox Movie
tone News, is the vice-president of
the Board of Cinerama Production
Corporation and co-producer and
narrator ol "This Is Cinerama," now
playing at the Orpheum Theater in
San Francisco.
This first Cinerama production,
co-produced by Thomas and Me
riam Cooper, has as its purpose
the demonstration of what the
Cinerama camera can do under
various conditions. Scenes from
the movie include shots of the
I.a Scala opera house in IVlilan,
scenes from a gondola in Venice,
and an airplane's-eye view of the
United States.
The brain child of Fred Waller
arid Hazard Reeves, Cinerama was
first shown to Thomas several years
ago. Thomas said he quickly

grasped its "tremendous potentiali- i
ties."
"Hollywood moguls had been in
to see it, had marveled, and didn't
know what to do with it," Thomas
recalled. "So 1 went to work with
Meriam Cooper to get Cinerama out
of the laboratory and into the mo
tion pieture theaters."
Thomas himself supervised the
European portion of the film, while

Cooper attended to the scenes shot
in the United States and wove the
film into a complete unit.
The realism of the roller-coast
er and plane ride sequences was
so great that, when the show
opened in New York, a nurse was
in attendance ready to give dra
mamine to theater patrons, Thom
as remarked.
At present, not too many theaters

are showing Cinerama, mainly be- j
cause of the costs involved in con- j
verting a theater to the demands of
the new medium- A semi-circular I
screen must be erected and seats ,
torn out to make room for the two |
side projectors which, combined j
with the image from the center pro- i
jector, give the three-dimensional I
effect of completely surrounding the I
viewer with sound and picture.
"If you want to compare Cin- J
ernma to the old-fashioned mo- ,
tion pictures," Thomas said, "it's j
the difference between ordinary
vision in which you see out of the
corners of your eyes, and looking
through a keyhole."
"II owe v e r„" he emphasized, .
"Cinerama should not he thought
of as competition (o Cinemascope i
or the regular movies. It's a to
tally new medium."
A new Cinerama production, en
titled "Thrills of Your Life" and
patterned on similar lines to "This
Is Cinerama," has already been
produced, but it may not be re
leased for some time since, accord
ing to Thomas, "the present show
looks as if it might run indefinitely."
In spite of the fact that Ciner
ama could be used to tell regular
screen plots, Thomas would like
to keep one-half to one-third of
the productions in the non-fiction
field, although not necessarily
travelogues.
He imagines something along the
lines of his early film "With Law
rence in Arabia, and Allenby in
Palestine," the first, movie to com
bine narration, sound, and music.
"I'd really like to do something
daring with Cinerama," he con
fided. "Something that no one else
has attempted to do. Maybe take
J a play like "Porg.v and Bess" ami
shoot it from the stage, combin
ing the theater and Hollywood."
Thomas expressed great faith in
the potentialities of Cinerama. He
indicated that the movies hud made
steady advances with the inventions
of sound and color, and Cinerama
marks a great step forward in the
art of motion picture story telling.
