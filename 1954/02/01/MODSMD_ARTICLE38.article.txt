# Papoose Capers Run Wild To Thump Broncos, 85-53
## 
### BOB DURAND 
The Stanford Papoose cagers, playing their best game of the
season, gained sweet revenge Saturday evening when they rolled
to a surprisingly easy 85-53 triumph over the Santa Clara frosh at
the Cow Palace.
As Coach Dick Clegg said in the dressing room after the game,

"We've been gunning for this one.
It was a very satisfying win since
they were the only team to beat us
last year."
The taller but slower Bronco
freshmen were never in the contest
as the Indian yearlings combined an
amazing field goal percentage of 52
per cent, with an impenetrable half
court pressing defense to capture
their fifth victory of the year against
two losses.
The Papooses established sev
eral season highs during the game,
scoring 85 points, shooting I!) free
throws and making 27, plus sev
eral individual records.
liill Itoml hit new highs with Id
field goals and 24 points, while
Carl Isaacs' 15 free throw attempts
were also tops for the year.
Alter a fast start by both teams,
the Frosh took a controlling lead
in the first period, and from there
on it was a matter of how fast the

gap would widen.
The shifting man-to-man defense
forced the Broncos to shoot from
the outside, and the fast break
cracked the losers' defense time and
time again.
Carl Isaacs stole the rebounds
from his taller opponents; Beppo
Dyer, Hap Wagner, and Dick Far
man swiped Bronco passes, Bond
and Denis Mahoney provided the
offensive punch with their driving
layups and jump shots. Frank
Wright, who has been improving
steadily all year, played his best
game in a reserve role.
After his cagers had built up
quarter leads of 22-9, 38-22, and 60-
41, Clegg began substituting freely
in the final period and gave every
one on the bench a considerable
amount of action.
