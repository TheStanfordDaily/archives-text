## 
### 
SOUTH BEND, Ind., Jan. 31 (UP)
| —Frank Leahy, a gridiron master
mind who ranks along side Knute
Rockne as a Notre Dame immortal,
resigned today as coach of the Irish.
The 45-year-old mentor, one of
\ the most successful in the land,
! cited reasons of health—the out
growth of sudden illness during the
1958 season when he collapsed in
the midst of a game.
Leahy, reached tonight by news
men in Chicago, said doctors ad
vised him to give up his post. Hp
1 emphasized he was resolved to "give
up football entirely."
"It's a tremendous weight off my
mind to get out of the game, as
much as I love it,"he said. "I will
weigh three or four business offers.
Pro football is definitely out."
Leahy thus left behind a mark
that future generations of cAnrhes

may have a hard time equaling.
In a lifetime tenure since 1939,
he lost only 1!5 games, winning
107 and tying nine. In 11 seasons
at Notre Dame lie won X 7, lost 11.
and tied nine.
There was immediate speculation
that Terry Brennan, a bright Irish
star of the 1947 season, might be in \
line as Leahy's successor.
Brennan, a halfback, started |
coaching at Chicago's Mt. Carmel
High School and piloted his teams to i
three successive city championships. ;
Last year he coached the Notre J
Dame freshman squad as a Leahy

assistant and only recently backed
away from a vacant coaching spot,
at Marquette University.
Another possibility was Bernie
Crimmins, now bead coach at In
diana, who until two years ago
was Leahy's top assistant. It was
recalled that last week Crimmins
went to Texas A. and IVI. to talk
about a coaching berth but did
not take the job.
The announcement of Leahy's

resignation was made by the Kev.
Theodore Hesburgh, president of
Notre Dame, who said he acted "re
gretfully."
"Coach Leahy's record during his
11 years' tenure rivals even that of
the immortal Knute Rockne. More j
importantly, he has distinguished
himself as a fine Christian gentle
man who represented Notre Dame's
ideals to millions of Americans,
young and old," Hesburgh said.
Leahy's resignation came as a
surprise, since lie had declared at J
ihe end of the gTid season lie
expected to stay on the job.
But his illness was well known
to the nation.

SOUTH BEND, Ind., Jan. 31 (UP)
| —Frank Leahy, a gridiron master
mind who ranks along side Knute
Rockne as a Notre Dame immortal,
resigned today as coach of the Irish.
The 45-year-old mentor, one of
\ the most successful in the land,
! cited reasons of health—the out
growth of sudden illness during the
1958 season when he collapsed in
the midst of a game.
Leahy, reached tonight by news
men in Chicago, said doctors ad
vised him to give up his post. Hp
1 emphasized he was resolved to "give
up football entirely."
"It's a tremendous weight off my
mind to get out of the game, as
much as I love it,"he said. "I will
weigh three or four business offers.
Pro football is definitely out."
Leahy thus left behind a mark
that future generations of cAnrhes

may have a hard time equaling.
In a lifetime tenure since 1939,
he lost only 1!5 games, winning
107 and tying nine. In 11 seasons
at Notre Dame lie won X 7, lost 11.
and tied nine.
There was immediate speculation
that Terry Brennan, a bright Irish
star of the 1947 season, might be in \
line as Leahy's successor.
Brennan, a halfback, started |
coaching at Chicago's Mt. Carmel
High School and piloted his teams to i
three successive city championships. ;
Last year he coached the Notre J
Dame freshman squad as a Leahy

assistant and only recently backed
away from a vacant coaching spot,
at Marquette University.
Another possibility was Bernie
Crimmins, now bead coach at In
diana, who until two years ago
was Leahy's top assistant. It was
recalled that last week Crimmins
went to Texas A. and IVI. to talk
about a coaching berth but did
not take the job.
The announcement of Leahy's

resignation was made by the Kev.
Theodore Hesburgh, president of
Notre Dame, who said he acted "re
gretfully."
"Coach Leahy's record during his
11 years' tenure rivals even that of
the immortal Knute Rockne. More j
importantly, he has distinguished
himself as a fine Christian gentle
man who represented Notre Dame's
ideals to millions of Americans,
young and old," Hesburgh said.
