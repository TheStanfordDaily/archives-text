## 
### 
Frank Leahy's retirement, will be
a great loss to the coaching profes
sion, Stanford Coach Chuck Taylor
commented yesterday.
"Though I knew him only slight
ly, I have always had great respect
for him as a coach and as a man,"
Taylor said. "The coaching profes
sion will miss him."
An indication of his ability, the
coach said, is his outstanding rec
ord at Notre Dame.
Taylor had no. idea who would
be named as Leahy's successor,
hut said that "our own Joe Kuetz
should ecrtainly be considered.
He is extremely capable as a
coach."
(Ruetz played three years of foot
ball under Elmer Layden at Notre
Dame, in 1936 as a quarterback and
at the guard post in 1935 and 1937.
He was named All-American in his
final year. His coaching experience
includes a year as head coach at. St.
Mary's.)
