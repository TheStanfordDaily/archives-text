# Causes for Unusual Behavior Studied in Psychology Rat Lab

Hidden deep among the tem
porary buildings near the West
ern Civ library is the Stanford
Psychology Department rat lab
oratory.
The purpose of the laboratory is
to determine the causes of unusual
behavior in rats, and when possible,
to discover if these causes relate to
analogous behavior in humans.
Within its walls are rats of as
sorted ages and sizes, which arc
used for various experiments. Grad
uate students under the supervision
of the psychology department care
for the rats and conduct the experi
ments. Also in the building is a
large array of experimental appa
ratus, including mazes, discrimina
tion boxes, and activity wheels.
Among rats of a ccrtain a#c in
one room sonic arc left normal,
but others have their pituitary
glands removed to arrest their

growth at one stage. These dwarf
rats arc later tested along with
the normal ones to *cc whether
gland removal has affected their
reactions to their surroundings.
One experiment using both dwarf
and normal rats is conducted in a
water maze. A metal maze, consist
ing of a starting space and alleys
going left and right, is partially sub
merged in water. One alley ends
with a ladder for the rat to climb
out of the water; the other ends in
a blank wall.
Tests are made by lowering the
rat in a small cage until it is under
water, holding it there for 30 sec
onds, and then releasing it to choose
which way it will swim. If it swims
to the ladder, it is able to get out
of the water, but if it swims to the
other end, it cannot.
So far in this experiment, it has
been found that the submerged rats
continue to swim to the end where
they first swam. For some reason
they aren't able to change whether
they arc right or wrong.
However, if there is a long alley
between (he spot where the ral is
released and the spot where it
makes its choice, it begins and
continues to swim the right way.
/Ylso, removal from the water for
a few seconds before release
seems to produce the same effect.
A possibility, though not proved,
is that the shock of being sub
merged produces a sort of unadap
tability or "fixation" in the rat. It
doesn't know or care whether it's
doing the right thing.
Experiments such as these may
prove of great importance especially
when they conccrn physiological
processes, for they often furnish the
key to better understanding of hu
man nature.
