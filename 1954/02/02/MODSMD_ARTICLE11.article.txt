# BIG FOUR CONFERENCE
## Russia Proposes Reunited Germany — With Limits 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 1 (UP) —Russia
proposed today to reunite Ger
many under a ready-made peace
treaty barring it from Western
defense alliances, limiting its
armed forces, and leaving it buf
feted between East and West.
Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov
presented the Soviet blueprint for
Germany at the first session of the
Big Four conference in Communist
East Berlin.
Virtually every point he set forth
had been rejected by the West. An
official Western spokesman called
his scheme "very disappointing."
It clashed in all major respects

with the Anglo-American-French
plan presented in West Berlin last
week. That plan called for free
elections as the first step in re
uniting Germany, and finally the
negotiating of a peace treaty with
a sovereign German government.
Molotov handed the Western min
isters two documents—the draft of
a peace treaty for Germany, largely
unchanged from a draft pact the
Soviets proposed in 1952, and a plan
for binding an all-German govern
ment under the treaty.
He denounced the European De
fense Community as "an insuper
able obstacle to German unity,"
lambasted U.S. policy in genera],
and appealed to France to forsake

the EDC and work for closer asso
ciation with Russia.
The main points of the proposed
peacc treaty to be signed by Ger
many and all states which fought
against Germany:
1. Re - establishment of Ger
many as an integral state.
2. Withdrawal of all occupation
forces and liquidation of all for
eign bases on German territory
within a year of the conclusion of
the treaty.
3. Germans to be guaranteed full
freedom of expression, the press, re
ligion, political opinion, and public
meeting, regardless of race, sex, lan
guage, and religion.
4. Freedom of action for all "dem

ocratic" parties and organizations.
5. Banning of organizations hos
tile to "democracy" and peace.
6. Equal civil and political rights
for all former members of the Ger
man army, including officers and
•former Nazis, except those serving
sentences for crimes.
7. Germany forbidden to enter
any alliances directed against a
country which fought Germany.
8. No political or military obliga
tions contracted by East or West
Germany to be imposed on the
united Germany.
The treaty would fix the German
frontiers delineated at Potsdam, in
cluding the Oder-Neisse line as the
eastern border with Poland.
