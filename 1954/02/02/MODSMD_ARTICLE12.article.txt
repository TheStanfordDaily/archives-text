## Kreps Says Ike Report 'On Thin Ice' 
### BARBARA TUERK 
Dr. Theodore J. Kreps of Stan
ford's Graduate School of Busi
ness last night compared Presi
dent Eisenhower's Economic
Report to Congress with his
budget, and found that, "There
is a considerable amount ol
ska tiny over thin ice when you
look at the cold hard economic
statistics in the Report."
Speaking in Cubberley Audito
rium before a Political Union au
dience about half Palo Alto and half
student, Dr. Kreps indicated skep
ticism of Eisenhower's assumption
that the country is now in a period
of "readjustment" rather than re
cession.
He estimated that the numbei of
unemployed has already reached
the 3.2 million mark at which emer
gency measures are supposed to be
initiated according to the 1946 Full
Employment Act.
"The President's budget is
ship of high caliber will induce
ship of high caliber wil linduce
consumers to part with their
money even though their income
is declining," Pr, Kreps ex
plained, and added that he did not
feel that this hope would be ful
filled.
"My hunch is that if I were a
worker looking around and seeing
people being laid off all around me
112 would hang on to my money," he
said.
Dr. Kreps concluded by express
ing his belief that "before June 1"
Eisenhower will have abandoned his
legislative program as expressed in
the Report and the budget, and will
"take drastic measures to throw the
full force of the government into
the battle against deflation."
Before indicating that lie did
not think Eisenhower would fol
low strictly the legislative pro
gram in the Report and the bud tr
et, Dr. Kreps iravc the following
"cold, hard, objective economist's
aanlysis" of <hat program.
lie emphasized first, of all the con
flict. between the Report and the
budget.
While the Report speaks of public
works programs which could be
started if an emergency began, he
said, "significantly the budget makes
no allowance even for preliminary
planning for such spending."
In <hc same way, Dr. Kreps
said, Eisenhower's budget makes
no provisions for his Report's rec
ommendations for tax reduction,
«ir improved social security pay
ments.
Of the entire legislative program,
Dr. Kreps disapproved most strong
ly of the President's plans for giv
ing stockholders a tax loophole by
removing the "double tax" on divj
i dends.

started if an emergency began, he
said, "significantly the budget makes
no allowance even for preliminary
planning for such spending."
In <hc same way, Dr. Kreps
said, Eisenhower's budget makes
no provisions for his Report's rec
ommendations for tax reduction,
«ir improved social security pay
ments.
Of the entire legislative program,
Dr. Kreps disapproved most strong
ly of the President's plans for giv
ing stockholders a tax loophole by
removing the "double tax" on divj
i dends.
Dr. Theodore J. Kreps of Stan
ford's Graduate School of Busi
ness last night compared Presi
dent Eisenhower's Economic
Report to Congress with his
budget, and found that, "There
is a considerable amount ol
ska tiny over thin ice when you
look at the cold hard economic
statistics in the Report."
Speaking in Cubberley Audito
rium before a Political Union au
dience about half Palo Alto and half
student, Dr. Kreps indicated skep
ticism of Eisenhower's assumption
that the country is now in a period
of "readjustment" rather than re
cession.
He estimated that the numbei of
unemployed has already reached
the 3.2 million mark at which emer
gency measures are supposed to be
initiated according to the 1946 Full
Employment Act.
"The President's budget is
ship of high caliber will induce
ship of high caliber wil linduce
consumers to part with their
money even though their income
is declining," Pr, Kreps ex
plained, and added that he did not
feel that this hope would be ful
filled.
"My hunch is that if I were a
worker looking around and seeing
people being laid off all around me
112 would hang on to my money," he
said.
Dr. Kreps concluded by express
ing his belief that "before June 1"
Eisenhower will have abandoned his
legislative program as expressed in
the Report and the budget, and will
"take drastic measures to throw the
full force of the government into
the battle against deflation."
Before indicating that lie did
not think Eisenhower would fol
low strictly the legislative pro
gram in the Report and the bud tr
et, Dr. Kreps iravc the following
"cold, hard, objective economist's
aanlysis" of <hat program.
lie emphasized first, of all the con
flict. between the Report and the
budget.
While the Report speaks of public
works programs which could be
started if an emergency began, he
said, "significantly the budget makes
no allowance even for preliminary
planning for such spending."
In <hc same way, Dr. Kreps
said, Eisenhower's budget makes
no provisions for his Report's rec
ommendations for tax reduction,
«ir improved social security pay
ments.
Of the entire legislative program,
Dr. Kreps disapproved most strong
ly of the President's plans for giv
ing stockholders a tax loophole by
removing the "double tax" on divj
i dends.
