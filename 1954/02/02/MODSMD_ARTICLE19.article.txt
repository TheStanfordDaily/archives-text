## U.S. Will Not Make Issue Of Air Fight 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 (UP)—
The State Department said today it
has no plans to make a top-level
diplomatic issue of the mixed air
battle off Korea in which a Com
munist MIG-15 was shot down
while attacking a U.S. reconnais
sance plane.
But officials said the Red attack
on Jan. Jan. 22—first of its kind
since the Korean armistice—could
be placed before the armistice com
mission at Panmunjom as a truce
violation.
Military sources indicated that an
"undisciplined Communist pilot"
touched off the air battle and said
they do not believe it necessarily
foreshadows other similar attacks
in the area.
These sources said the Red pilot
broke away from a MIG formation
which flew out from North Korea to
investigate $nd bore down on the
reconnaissance plane. The Ameri
can plane's Sabrejet escort promptly
came to its defense and routed the
Reds.
The Air Force said the reconnais
sance plane definitely was over "in
ternational waters" when it was at
tacked. It did not give the nation
ality of the MIGs, but they are Rus
sian built and presumably were
based in North Korea. The flyers
could have been North Koreans,
Red Chinese, or even Russians.
Officials pointed out that a high
level protest would be difficult since
the nationality of the attacking
planes apparently was not deter
mined. In addition, the United
States does not have diplomatic re
lations with Red China.
