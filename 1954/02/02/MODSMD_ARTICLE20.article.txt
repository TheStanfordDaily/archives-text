WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 (UP) -
Senate Republican Leader William
F. Knowland (Calif.) said today he
believes President Eisenhower will
support a compromise version of the
Bricker amendment if certain basic
legal issues can be "clarified."
But day - long meetings among
Knowland, Sens. John W. Brickn
(R., O.), author of the controversial
proposal, Senate Republican and
Democratic leaders, Attorney Gen -
eral Herbert Brownell, Jr., and Mi
Eisenhower apparently removed
none of the roadblocks.
