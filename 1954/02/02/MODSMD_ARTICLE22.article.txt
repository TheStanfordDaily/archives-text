# What kind of Discussion?
## 
### 
Yesterday we expressed a basic belief in the
value of discussion, as related to the current
Honor Code issue and all such significant is
sues oi the day.
Today we are aware that we did not specify
that discussion on such broad topics as the
Stanford Honor Code deserves a special ap
proach, an approach which must be directed
toward an understanding ol the fundamental
problem involved iri the issue.
We believe that the fundamental problem in
volved in the Honor Code issue is this:
That Stanford does not know what the
llonor Code means, that Stanford does not
hove a clear definition <jI what type ol re
sponsibility the Honor ('.ode demands ol each
student. \
Individually, each student knows what he
thinks the Honor Code should mean. Individu
ully, each student lias defined the type of re
sponsibility he think:-; the Honor Code implies,
hut these individual definitions have not yet
been brought together to establish a collective
definition that would apply to such problems a.s
I.iking examinations from the classroom.
Ii is the duly ol the Executive Committee to

draw those individual definitions together and
establish that collective definition.
The first step in that direction was, we be
lieve, taken at last Wednesday's meeting ol
the Executive Committee. For the first time,
Excorn indicated that it was tired ol the "plans"
and the apparently unending discussion over
details, for the first time Excom indicated that
it wanted to achieve a basic definition of the
Honor Code through a process of interpretation,
education, and discussion.
Tomorrow night the committee which Ex
com appointed to plan this program will
make ils teporl. We hope that they will oiler
Excom, and the student:;, a program by which
discussion can be confined to a consideration
ol the fundamental question: "What cibes the
Honor C'.ode mean and what type ol respon
sibility does it imply?"
And we hope that the program of "education
and interpretation" will give the students of
Stanford a chance to define the Honor Code
themselves, so that a clear, collective definition
can be achieved. We hope that the discussion
involved in such a program will not be con
fused by negative appraisals of "plans" or
ready made interpretations
