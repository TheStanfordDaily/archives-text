# More Than a Word

We were surprised when we first read thai
the War Department plans to court-martial Cpl.
Edward S. Dickenson, the American prisoner
of-war who first chose to stay with the Commu
nists, and then agreed lo UN rehabilitators' per
suasion to return home.
We were even more surprised when wfi
learned thai the Department was planning to
punish American POW's who succumbed to
Communist torture and broadcast false germ
warfare confessions.
Our first emotion was pity pity for indi
viduals returning from three years of prison
camp hell to face disgrace <nid possibly more
imprisonment at home.
but even more deeply we fell fear —fear of
the peculiar kind of patiiotism which underlies
the "Get Tough" attitude toward the weaker
POWs.
We fear the mixed up kind of patriotism

which loves the word "America"and forgets
what the word stands for.
To us the word America implies humanity —
revulsion against the unnecessary punishment
of an individual whose only crime is human
weakness. And it implies honesty—the kind
of honesty which forbids us to court-martial a
man who carne home after we persuaded him
that his transgressions would be forgiven.
It's easy to defend a word. It's easy to de
mand vengeanceogainst anyone whose actions
harm the word "America."
It takes more time, more effort, to find out
I he basic concepts for which that word stands.
But iiulf.'ss we do not take the time to identify
those concepts, and make the effort to defend
them, we're in danger of finding ourselves with
neither the word "America" or the way-of
living for which it stands
