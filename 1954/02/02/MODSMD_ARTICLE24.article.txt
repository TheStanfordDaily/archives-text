### PETE GROTHE 
ON TTIF JUNIOR SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN
Today, for the first and definitely the last time,
Bull Session turns book reviewer. A comparatively
little-knowo book on one of America's best-known
men has come to our attention. It is of such unusual
worth that we devote this column to commending

it to your reading list. The title:
"McCarthy, the Man, the S( na
tor, the 'Ism'." McCarthy, inci
dentally, will speak in San Mateo
on Feb. 10.
Before going any farther, I
.should like to assure the Wiseon
•in Senator with the perpetual
live o'clock shadow that I am not
now, never was, and never will
be a member ol the Communist
party.

The book is penned by two talented young journal
ists:, Jack Anderson and Ronald W May, who know
McCarthy and spent more than a year of research
before writing the book.
Among the things that tins 388-page tome reveals
is that:
(1) The Wisconsin State Bar Association recom
mended that McCarthy fce disbarred because he
violated the Wisconsin Constitution in running for
the Senate. McCarthy, then a judge was required
by state law to resign his judgeship when running
lor the Senate so that he wouldn't use the prestige
of his judicial position to further his political aims
McCarthy didn't resign.
(11) In i!tl<i. when running for the Senate against
Bob l.al ollcl tc, McCarthy accepted help from the
Communist Party. And when he was later asked
it this was true, he said, "They're a legal party,
aren't they?"
(!{) In 1948, McCarthy accepted a $10,000 bribe from
Lustron Corporation when thai particular corpora
tion was being investigated by the committee Mc-
Carthy was on.
(4) A poll of all the Washington, DC. newsmen

and another vote by America's most distinguished
group of political scientists labeled McCarthy as
"the worst Senator of the 9(5."
(5) In all his years of wild accusations, McCarthy
has failed to put a single Communist behind bars.
((») McCarthy lias, paradoxically, voted the same
line as advanced by the Communists on every ma
jor issue of foreign policy, as laid down by the Daily
Worker, ever since the war. This is not to say that
lie's a Communist, hut rather, in voting against all
foreign aid appropriations which defeat the con
ditions from which communism spring, he has
played into the Kremlin's hands.
(7) Among the enthusiastic supporters of McCarthy
are Gerald 1.. K Smith, the anti-Semite agitator;
Upton Close, well-known Axis apologist; Conde Mc-
Ginley, editor of "Common Sense." which recently
called Eisenhower a ''Marxist stooge"; Jessie W.
Jenkins, only woman leader of Ku Klux Klan; and
Joseph Kamp, Nazi-endorsed propagandist.
(8) Herbert Philhrick, an FBI agent who spent
nine years in the Communis! party as a counter
spy said, "According to lite leaders of the Commu
nis! party, McCarthy has helped them a great deal.
The hind ol attacks he has made do three things
that the comrades like: they add greatly to the
((.illusion, putting up a smokescreen for the party
and making it more difficult than ever for people
to discern iust who is a Communist and who is
not; they make the party appear a lot stronger than
it actually is; and they do considerable damage
to the liberals whom the party fears most."
"McCarthy, the Man, the Senator, the Ism" seems
to point out that communism, like sin, should be
loathed by everyone. Isut that the question is not. how
loudly you proclaim your hatred of communism,
but rathei what method' you use to combat it The
method' ol McCarthy the authors suggest, leave
something to be desired
The book shows, in hard hitting fashion, why sev
eral European leaders recently said that McCarthy
h;us done America more harm in eight months than
Russian propaganda ha;, done in eight years.

Today, for the first and definitely the last time,
Bull Session turns book reviewer. A comparatively
little-knowo book on one of America's best-known
men has come to our attention. It is of such unusual
worth that we devote this column to commending

it to your reading list. The title:
"McCarthy, the Man, the S( na
tor, the 'Ism'." McCarthy, inci
dentally, will speak in San Mateo
on Feb. 10.
Before going any farther, I
.should like to assure the Wiseon
•in Senator with the perpetual
live o'clock shadow that I am not
now, never was, and never will
be a member ol the Communist
party.

The book is penned by two talented young journal
ists:, Jack Anderson and Ronald W May, who know
McCarthy and spent more than a year of research
before writing the book.
Among the things that tins 388-page tome reveals
is that:
(1) The Wisconsin State Bar Association recom
mended that McCarthy fce disbarred because he
violated the Wisconsin Constitution in running for
the Senate. McCarthy, then a judge was required
by state law to resign his judgeship when running
lor the Senate so that he wouldn't use the prestige
of his judicial position to further his political aims
McCarthy didn't resign.
(11) In i!tl<i. when running for the Senate against
Bob l.al ollcl tc, McCarthy accepted help from the
Communist Party. And when he was later asked
it this was true, he said, "They're a legal party,
aren't they?"
(!{) In 1948, McCarthy accepted a $10,000 bribe from
Lustron Corporation when thai particular corpora
tion was being investigated by the committee Mc-
Carthy was on.
(4) A poll of all the Washington, DC. newsmen

and another vote by America's most distinguished
group of political scientists labeled McCarthy as
"the worst Senator of the 9(5."
(5) In all his years of wild accusations, McCarthy
has failed to put a single Communist behind bars.
((») McCarthy lias, paradoxically, voted the same
line as advanced by the Communists on every ma
jor issue of foreign policy, as laid down by the Daily
Worker, ever since the war. This is not to say that
lie's a Communist, hut rather, in voting against all
foreign aid appropriations which defeat the con
ditions from which communism spring, he has
played into the Kremlin's hands.
(7) Among the enthusiastic supporters of McCarthy
are Gerald 1.. K Smith, the anti-Semite agitator;
Upton Close, well-known Axis apologist; Conde Mc-
Ginley, editor of "Common Sense." which recently
called Eisenhower a ''Marxist stooge"; Jessie W.
Jenkins, only woman leader of Ku Klux Klan; and
Joseph Kamp, Nazi-endorsed propagandist.
(8) Herbert Philhrick, an FBI agent who spent
nine years in the Communis! party as a counter
spy said, "According to lite leaders of the Commu
nis! party, McCarthy has helped them a great deal.
The hind ol attacks he has made do three things
that the comrades like: they add greatly to the
((.illusion, putting up a smokescreen for the party
and making it more difficult than ever for people
to discern iust who is a Communist and who is
not; they make the party appear a lot stronger than
it actually is; and they do considerable damage
to the liberals whom the party fears most."
"McCarthy, the Man, the Senator, the Ism" seems
to point out that communism, like sin, should be
loathed by everyone. Isut that the question is not. how
loudly you proclaim your hatred of communism,
but rathei what method' you use to combat it The
method' ol McCarthy the authors suggest, leave
something to be desired
The book shows, in hard hitting fashion, why sev
eral European leaders recently said that McCarthy
h;us done America more harm in eight months than
Russian propaganda ha;, done in eight years.
