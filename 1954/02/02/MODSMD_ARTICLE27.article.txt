# Adler: Present Generation Afraid to Think Out Loud
## 
### SUE WHEAT 
"Wo live in ihe first United States generation iii.it is afraid lo
think out loud."
This was the lamentation of educator Dr. Mortimer J. Adler in a
speech given to the Association of Catholic Newsmen at the Press
and Union League Club in San Francisco, Sunday night.

The occasion was the annual
presentation ol the 1953 McQuade
Memorial Award (For award win
ners see separate story.)
Adler, a Thomist and an Aristo
telian, is director of the Institute for
Philosophic Research and a promo
ter of the Great Books Foundation,
lie pointed out the similarity
of u teacher and a journalist. Al
though one deals wilh inculcat
ing theoretical principles and the
other more with disseminating
knowledge of current matters of
fact, both, he said, are "concerned
with variety of opinion."
And as sharers in the common
field of education, he said, "both
have the moral obligation to he
friendly toward controversy."
Judged by their obligation to as
sociate with controversy, Adler
said, "the media of mass communi
cation fail He cited biased presen
tation, coloring of facts, and with
holding of information as examples
ol the failure. "Those in teaching
and communication," he said, "are
exercising the right of free speech
but violate the duty."
The duty of free speech lies in the
use ol it, the slight, ascetic-looking
philosopher pointed out. He listed
two more specific duties entailed:
1. The avoidance of emotional, ir
relevant factors m Ihe presentation
oi a thesis.
2. The representation of all pos
sible alternative sides of a question.
Freedom of thought, Adler said,
"is Ihe basic freedom," indispen
sable to Ihe use of other subordi
nate hccdoms (speech, assembly,
worship). And without recogniz
ing Ihe need for controversy, he
said, we give up the prerequisite
for freedom of thought. Without
debate the mind is "coerced" into
pai tisanship.
Coerced partisanship, the fear to
discuss all sides of a question, he
said, is the situation existing in the
United States today.
Adler said Americans have even

coined ;i new phra.'e: "controversial
issue which means ;iii issue on
winch it is wrong lit stale any : ide
hut the "right" side.
Issue: he cited as being "contro
versial and thus subject to limited
discussion are: Communism vs. cap
italism, the question ol recognizing
Red China, and the question of a
world government.
Adler quoted St. Thomas Aquinas
as saying that, "agreement from au
thority is the weakest., not to he
used except by those who can't use
reason."
