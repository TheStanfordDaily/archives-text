# Colorful Ring Career Recalled by Ray Lunny
## 
### RAY LOYND 
I ho lights suddenly wont out for Card Boxing Couch Hay Lunny
in 1810.
It was the fourth round, the Oakland arena, a lightweight rnai.n
eventer. Favored Lunny was battering his opponent, Joe Galardo,
all over the ring. The crov/d was yelling, Galardo was in bad

shape. Blink! The fighters stood
tunned in the middle of a pitch
dark l ing. Someone had -yanked the
main switch, and the Oakland Au
ditorium was plunged into dark
ness.
It was live minutes before the
lights went on again," Lunny said.
"By thai time Galardo had rested
and it took me four more rounds to
catch him.' Lunny won on a TKO
in the eighth.
'I have .some idea gamblers pulleJ
the light switch," Lunny said con
fidently, but with the retrospection
ol amusement.
So spun one ol the more unusual
incidents in the victory - studded
boxing career ol Stanford's ring
leader. Lunny has coached the In
dians since 1947 and boxed profes
ionally Irom 1!)3M to l!) 42. But his
biggest boxing thrill occurred just
last year when he eoached Bob Bal
docchi to the Pacific Coast Intercol
legiate Light - Heavyweight Cham
pionship in Sacramento. Lunny
rates it as "my most gratifying ex
perience." >
Lunny was two steps from the
top of tlie light weight heap in
I MI. Soon the war, completely
ignoring King Magazine ami its
ranking Lunny the third best
lightweight in the world, inter
rupted a potentially loaded fu
ture. Lunny enlisted in the Coast
Guard in I!) 12 and spent !{'/•» years
on it Irigate in the southwest Pa
cific.
He followed with a stint in the
re.il estate business hid was shortly
hack in the game again, however,

Angeles. He was only 19 and felt

there on until 1942 il was one vic
tory after another up and down the
coast, the Bay Area and Los An
geles being the chief stops.
It soon became apparent that
Lunny was on the way up. From

| that initial bout in the Hollywood
Legion, Lunny went undefeated
until his ."Sfjlh fight!
He then smashed into leather
weight champion of the world
Chalky Wright in a non-title go in
San Francisco. Il was 1941 and
Lunny was silting pretty in the top
ten lightweights, ranked third in
ternationally.
Wright stung Lunny with his first
loss, capturing a 10-round decision.
But it wasn't a heartbreaker all the
way Lunny pocketed $.'5,000 for llie
job.
family continued lo box 15

times, dropping only a trio of re
maining fights and climaxing a
•spectacular career with a record
of 14 victories, a pair of draws,
and four defeats.
Lunny, whose boxing weight ran
between 130 and 135, was managed
by Joey Fox and Dutch Myers.
Lunny was a friend of many of the
top fighters and the wall above his
office desk is plastered with signa
tured photographs of all the good
one- Georgie Latka, Richard Le
inos, Fred Apostoli, Young Corbett
111 ("the smartest fighter I ever
>aw"), Vein Bybee ("the toughest"),
Wright ("the best all-around fighter
1 ever met"), Tony Conzoneri, and
many others.
When Lunny entered the service
his prominence was at its peak and
there was no end in sight. He fought
professionally three times while en
listed but his hands started giving
him trouble and it was but a ques
tion of time when he would have to
stop fighting.
Bespectacled, .'(4-year-old Tun
ny, father of a nine - year old
daughter and 2'/-i - year - old son,
says of his son's boxing future:
"I wouldn't want him to lie a
boxer hut 1 wouldn't object to
boxing in college. Amateur box
ing is all right, liul professional
. . . it's a strange business.
"You can be good and make no
money and be poor and make lots of
money. Purses depend on your abil
ity as a drawing card. Some guys
have a pleasing style and catch on
with the public. It's just like in
show business."
Lunny believes that the present
crop of fighters are good but lack
the over-all quality prominent in
the '20's.
"Boxing has gone down consider
ably," he commented. "It's been on
the downgrade since 1930. The
greatest period of boxing was be
tween 1910 and 1930. Since 193(1
there's been a greater interest by
kids in other sports due to increased
recreational facilities.
Lunny conducts elementary box
ing classes at Stanford out of which
he gleans material for bis team.

He then smashed into leather
weight champion of the world
Chalky Wright in a non-title go in
San Francisco. Il was 1941 and
Lunny was silting pretty in the top
ten lightweights, ranked third in
ternationally.
Wright stung Lunny with his first
loss, capturing a 10-round decision.
But it wasn't a heartbreaker all the
way Lunny pocketed $.'5,000 for llie
job.

times, dropping only a trio of re
maining fights and climaxing a

of 14 victories, a pair of draws,
and four defeats.
Lunny, whose boxing weight ran
between 130 and 135, was managed
by Joey Fox and Dutch Myers.
Lunny was a friend of many of the
top fighters and the wall above his
office desk is plastered with signa

Wright ("the best all-around fighter
1 ever met"), Tony Conzoneri, and
many others.
When Lunny entered the service
his prominence was at its peak and
there was no end in sight. He fought
professionally three times while en
listed but his hands started giving
him trouble and it was but a ques
tion of time when he would have to
stop fighting.

says of his son's boxing future:
"I wouldn't want him to lie a
boxer hut 1 wouldn't object to
boxing in college. Amateur box
ing is all right, liul professional
. . . it's a strange business.
"You can be good and make no
money and be poor and make lots of
money. Purses depend on your abil
ity as a drawing card. Some guys
have a pleasing style and catch on
with the public. It's just like in
show business."
Lunny believes that the present
crop of fighters are good but lack
the over-all quality prominent in
the '20's.
"Boxing has gone down consider
ably," he commented. "It's been on
the downgrade since 1930. The
greatest period of boxing was be
tween 1910 and 1930. Since 193(1
there's been a greater interest by
kids in other sports due to increased
recreational facilities.
Lunny conducts elementary box

I ho lights suddenly wont out for Card Boxing Couch Hay Lunny
in 1810.
It was the fourth round, the Oakland arena, a lightweight rnai.n
eventer. Favored Lunny was battering his opponent, Joe Galardo,
all over the ring. The crov/d was yelling, Galardo was in bad

shape. Blink! The fighters stood
tunned in the middle of a pitch
dark l ing. Someone had -yanked the
main switch, and the Oakland Au
ditorium was plunged into dark
ness.
It was live minutes before the
lights went on again," Lunny said.
"By thai time Galardo had rested
and it took me four more rounds to
catch him.' Lunny won on a TKO
in the eighth.

fidently, but with the retrospection
ol amusement.
