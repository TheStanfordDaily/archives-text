NEW YORK, Feb. I (UP)—Bob
by Thomson, whose dramatic play
olf homer won the 1951 pennant for
llie New York Giants, was traded
louighl lo the Milwaukee Braves
;11«»11• > willi catcher Sam Calderone
lor loin players and cash.
'I'hi' players received by (lie
Giants were pitchers Johnny Anln
nelli and Don Liddle, infielder Lilly
Klaus, and catcher Ebba St. Claire.
The amount of cash was not dis
closed.
Thomson earned himself a berth
among the Giants' all-time im
mortals on Oct 1951, when bis
ninth-inning home run, perhaps
llie most dramatic blow io the his
tory ill baseball, gave the Giants
a . r » to I victory over (he Brook
lyn Dodgers in llie (bird game of
Ihcir play-off series for (lie Na
tional League pennant.
That Thomson was on the trading
block 111 is winter was frequently re
ported, as the Giants obviously
•ought for new strength to build
up from their fifth-place finish last
.season.
As a man who hatted .288 last
season with 2(1 home runs, 106 runs
batted-in, and also as a versatile
player who can perform both in
<cnler field and al third base, Thom
son figured as the bait that could
bring strong players in exchange.
