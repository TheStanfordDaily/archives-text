### DAVE BROWNWOOD 
Unrversity President 112. E. Wallace Sterling last night said he
felt that the recent discussions on the Honor Code have been in
many cases "tending to push logic to an absurd conclusion,"
Sterling expressed His opinion in a discussion last night with
residents of Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Ventura at the Bowman

Alumni House as a part of the cur ♦
rent ''Stanford -Today and Totnor
row" series. The president, covered
a wiHe range of topics during the
discussion
In discussing the Honor Code,
Sterling compared the situation as
it existed when he first came to
Stanford with the present, rind ex
pressed apprehension regarding the
attitude of the students toward the
Code now
"At first, the understanding was
that leaving the classroom was a
matter of convenience for the sl.u
dent," Sterling said. It was always
arranged "out of courtesy between
the student and the professor."
Hut from ennveneince and coin
tesy, he added, the matter of Ink
ing exams from the classroom has
come to lie regarded as ;i right. At
this point "the philosophy of the
Code breaks down." For when
thought is directed along this line,
students are "lending to push
logic to an ahsurd conclusion," he
said.
At another point in the discussion,
Sterling said the University had no
definite policy regarding fraterni
ties, especially in the matter of al
lowing new chapters on eampu-
But in expressing his own opinion,
he stated, "I feel no justification for
the existence of anything around
the University which does not con
tribute positively to the welfare of
the University."

Ileuses arc valuable as living
units, Sterling explained. But he
bclievr:; thai, thru record of contri-
I billion to the University, can be im
proved Specific examples cited b>
the 11r«• -idant were "care of pri
vate property," "grades, and con
duct."
