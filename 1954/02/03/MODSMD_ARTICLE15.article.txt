# BRICKER PLAN
## Compromise Efforts Fail 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (UP) —
Republican - Democratic efforts to
draft a substitute for the Bricker
amendment collapsed today and
GOP leaders immediately intro
duced "piecemeal" legislation of
their own to curb the President's
treaty powers.
The Republican leaders were
forced into action after veteran Sen.
Walter F. George (D., Ga.) declared
flatly there was "no hope" for a
compromise in the drawn-out dis
pute and began rounding up votes
for his own substitute measure.
George also had sought to make
sure his substitute would he the
first to he considered when the
current "great debate," now in
its sixth day, is ended. But the
GOP leaders used a parliamentary
maneuver to obtain priority for
their proposals.
It was understood that the three
proposals offered by the GOP lead
ers had at least tacit White House
approval. The President had re
fused to go along with a fourth pro
posal—which also is the heart of the
George plan —to require Congres
sional approval of executive agree
ments as well as treaties.
The GOP proposals would:
1. Invalidate any treaty "or other
international agreement" which
conflicts with the Constitution.
2. Require a recorded roll call
vote on Senate ratification of trea
ties.
X Amend the Constitution to pro
vide that future treaties must not
violate the Constitution.
The GOP proposals would elimi
nate the controversial "which"
clause that has been the core of the
dispute between the White House
and the Ohio Senator and his back
ers. This clause says a treaty shall
become effective as internal law
only through legislation which
would become effective in the ab
sence of a treaty.
