# Students Request Serials at Flicks
## 
### 
The blood - curdling serials that
used to be a weekly feature at the
Sunday Night Movies are gone but
not forgotten. A campus-wide cam
paign to bring them back is be;ng
planned by a group of students.
"A Petition for Redress of Griev
ance" has already been distributed
in several of the Stern wings, and
the students behind the petition
plan to circulate one in every cam
pus living group by next week.
The petition reads as follows: "As
members of the Stanford student
body, we request that henceforth
the Sunday Night Movies (flicks)
shall include a serial on the pro
gram."
Richie Meyer, who helped write
the petition, explained: "We heard
many students complain when the
serials were discontinued, but no
body took any action. At the be
ginning of the quarter we decided
to do something about it."
