# France Spurns Russian Efforts, Backs Allies
## 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 2 (UP)—France spurned Soviet efforts to woo it
from the West today and joined the United States and Britain in a
firm rejection of Russia's satellite-style peace plan for Germany.
Foreign Minister Georges Bidault blocked what many diplo
mats regarded as the Kremlin's biggest play of ihe Big Four con-

ference—to break up the Western
alliance even at the cost of a Ger
man settlement.
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles spearheaded the Western re
jection of V. M. Molotov's proposals
for Germany. He talked tough to
Molotov, shredding his peace plan
and demanding that he get down to
business.
In one of the West's toughest
speeches of the conference, Dul
les branded as "foolish chatter"
Molotov's charge that the West
sought to revive German mili
tarism for a new war of aggres
sion.
The eighth session of the confer
ence and the second in Communist
East Berlin was wrapped in an at
mosphere of gloom. One after an
other the Western ministers told
Molotov they never could accept
the plan regarded as aimed at de
livering all Germany into the Com
munist camp as another satellite
state.
Bidault replied to Molotov's ap
peal for closer Franco-Soviet rela
tions with a cool assurance that
France was ready for closer rela
tions, but only in so far as the
Western Allies we re included.
"M. Molotov has !<•< it be un
derstood that he would desire to
see the formation of a European
system in which France and the
U.S.S.R. in agreement with Ger
many would seek together the.
means of safeguarding security,"
Bidault said.
"Such an objective seems emi
nently desirable to us, in so far as
no one would think of excluding
from such an alliance the two other
governments represented at this
table."
After hearing the Western min
isters lambast him, Molotov an
nounced that he would have a great
deal more to say on all-German
elections, and would offer new So
viet proposals on the subject. He
was expected to have his say to
morrow.
Dulles was chairman and first
speaker of the eighth session of
the Big Four confcrence of for
eign ministers.
He taunted the impassive Molotov
with such mistakes as the 1939 pact
with Nazi Germany, and said he
well might be mistaken again in his
charges that the Western powers
now were bent on aggression.

BERLIN, Feb. 2 (UP)—France spurned Soviet efforts to woo it
from the West today and joined the United States and Britain in a
firm rejection of Russia's satellite-style peace plan for Germany.
Foreign Minister Georges Bidault blocked what many diplo
mats regarded as the Kremlin's biggest play of ihe Big Four con-

ference—to break up the Western
alliance even at the cost of a Ger
man settlement.
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles spearheaded the Western re
jection of V. M. Molotov's proposals
for Germany. He talked tough to
Molotov, shredding his peace plan
and demanding that he get down to
business.
In one of the West's toughest
speeches of the conference, Dul
les branded as "foolish chatter"
Molotov's charge that the West
sought to revive German mili
tarism for a new war of aggres
sion.
The eighth session of the confer
ence and the second in Communist
East Berlin was wrapped in an at
mosphere of gloom. One after an
other the Western ministers told
Molotov they never could accept
the plan regarded as aimed at de
livering all Germany into the Com
munist camp as another satellite
state.
Bidault replied to Molotov's ap
peal for closer Franco-Soviet rela
tions with a cool assurance that
France was ready for closer rela
tions, but only in so far as the
Western Allies we re included.
"M. Molotov has !<•< it be un
derstood that he would desire to
see the formation of a European
system in which France and the
U.S.S.R. in agreement with Ger
many would seek together the.
means of safeguarding security,"
Bidault said.
"Such an objective seems emi
nently desirable to us, in so far as
no one would think of excluding
from such an alliance the two other
governments represented at this
table."
