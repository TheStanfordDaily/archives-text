# The 						Condon Case
## 
### 
The other night at dinner a hiend of ours
guestioned casually, "What's the mime of that
Communist from the State Department? You
know Lattimore?"

We broke in immediately,
"No one has ever convicted
Owen Lattimore of Commu
nism or anything else," arid
our friend agreed.
And yet we were vaguely
and guiltily aware that in our
mind, too. the name "Latti
more" was linked with the
idea "Communist."
And we started worrying
about another rnoie recent
case of a man in much the
same situation as Owen Latti
more—the case of Jack Con
don, California Congressman
named at last December's
Velde Committee hearings as
having attended a closed
Communist paity meeting in
Oakland.

In accordance with out extensive coverage
with those hearings, The Daily gave consider
able space to the dramatic charge that a
United States Congressman was linked with
the Communist party. We weie sure the
story would interest our leaders.
In the past weeks The Daily has tried to give
a proportionate amount of space to Condon's
denials of that charge and to Eisenhower's re-

guest that the Congressman be given a fair
chance to state his side of the case.
But we can't help wondering how many of
our readers, without really remembering either

our December or our January
stories, still vaguely link the
name "Condon" with the idea
"Communist."
Maybe Condon is a Com
munist. Maybe Lattimore is.
Again and again we say we
don't know, hut in this in
stance it's not enough just to
say thai "we don't know."
It's necessary to keep the
distinction between accusa
tion and guilt in the front of
our minds every lime we read
a newspaper or listen to a
conversation in which some
one is charged with Commu
nism.
In an age where irrespon
sible accusations are being
made — and refuted — dailv.

reading a newspaper is an enormously difficult
task. Reading only the headlines, reading one
day's paper and not the next, can leave us with
a grossly unfair idea about a man.
Perhaps never befoie has it been more diffi
cult to distinguish between truths and half
truths and untruths. But certainly never before
has it been moie necessary to make this distinc
tion. — Barbara Tuerk
