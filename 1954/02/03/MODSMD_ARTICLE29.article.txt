### DICK MANSFIELD 
Krogomeier stood pumping nickels into the Coke
machine. The Coke machine, of course, was empty,
and the coin return, of course, was broken, .so Krogo
meier stood there putting in a nickel, pulling the
handle, and accomplishing nothing. But he had plenty
of nickels. He seemed unperturbed; he occasionally

muttered to himself hut other
wise seemed calm and even
cheery.
Zilch wandered up. "What are
you doing, Krogomeier?" he said.
"J yam playin' dis machine,"
said Krogomeier, "and it mils' be
fixed on account of 1 ain't won
nothing." "Dolt," said Zilch,
""at is a busted Coke machine."
"Aha!" said Krogomeier, "I wun
nered where the little lemons an'

bells an' things was."
That's the trouble with the modern Coke machine
it looks like a one-armed bandit. But you can still
lind people who claim the old-fashioned Coke ma
chines were bandits in their own right. They swal
lowed nickels regardless of whether they had Cokes
to exchange or not. At the end of the south wing of
Toyon stands a Coke machine scarred and battered
by ireful club men who have played and lost. One
evening a youth stood and pounded on the Coke ma
chine for a considerable time. A gallery gathered.
"Wassamatta, Jack," .said somebody
"Trouble with this machine is that it only works
halfway," the youth replied. "Takes nickels fine, but
it doesn't supply Cokes."
An even more archaic model of Coke machine
once stood behind the wire desk al The Daily. It
was one of those l»i« square boxes with half n I'-mt
of icy slime in the bottom. You paid voiir nickel
and you fished around until you found a ( okt\ A

little hard (o hold onto the bottle, maybe, but it
was a Coke. Unless the handle got stuck. Then you
paid your nickel and went away fuming.
So they replaced this box with a grand new shiny
chromed-up job. In recognition of its merit, it was
placed behind the sports desk. It has a little win
dow in it and there is a sign behind the window
which says "Have a Coke!" When there are no more
Cokes to have, the little sign says "EMPTY."
"Built, in mechanical brain!" said a sports desk
editor after contributing his third nickel, dealing
the chrome a lusty kick.
Then there are the change-makers. Put in a
quarter and you get a Coke and four clicks at the
coin return. Or else you get no Coke but four
nickels. Or you get a Coke and combinations of
one, two, or three nickels with a green-lit edict
which says, too late, "NICKELS ONLY."
More sport can be got trying to figure out the func
tion of the coin-return. Press the button and you can
hear the wheels turning and the gears meshing. But
if you want your coin back, you have to wait for the
maintenance man.
At filling stations and elsewhere in the country
you iose money to broken Coke machines a dime at
a time; here al Stanford you pay a dime at the En
cina dispenser, which pours the Coke into cups so
that the frosh won't have bottles to pitch into the
court. There are plenty of arguments questioning
the merit of this machine/ on the grounds that ten
cents is too much to pay for half a cup of Coke.
But these points are trivial. No one minds losing an
occasional nickel to a game of chance. But where
does all that extra money go? A true puzzle. Let's
see if the Coke people couldn't be persuaded to use
the money to develop a coin-reLurn that, works. Or
else some heavy rubbei padding foi thai Toyon Coke
machine

placed behind the sports desk. It has a little win
dow in it and there is a sign behind the window
which says "Have a Coke!" When there are no more
Cokes to have, the little sign says "EMPTY."
"Built, in mechanical brain!" said a sports desk
editor after contributing his third nickel, dealing
the chrome a lusty kick.
Then there are the change-makers. Put in a
quarter and you get a Coke and four clicks at the
coin return. Or else you get no Coke but four
nickels. Or you get a Coke and combinations of
one, two, or three nickels with a green-lit edict
which says, too late, "NICKELS ONLY."
More sport can be got trying to figure out the func
tion of the coin-return. Press the button and you can
hear the wheels turning and the gears meshing. But
if you want your coin back, you have to wait for the
maintenance man.
At filling stations and elsewhere in the country
you iose money to broken Coke machines a dime at
a time; here al Stanford you pay a dime at the En
cina dispenser, which pours the Coke into cups so
that the frosh won't have bottles to pitch into the
court. There are plenty of arguments questioning
the merit of this machine/ on the grounds that ten
cents is too much to pay for half a cup of Coke.
But these points are trivial. No one minds losing an
occasional nickel to a game of chance. But where
does all that extra money go? A true puzzle. Let's
see if the Coke people couldn't be persuaded to use
the money to develop a coin-reLurn that, works. Or

Krogomeier stood pumping nickels into the Coke
machine. The Coke machine, of course, was empty,
and the coin return, of course, was broken, .so Krogo
meier stood there putting in a nickel, pulling the
handle, and accomplishing nothing. But he had plenty
of nickels. He seemed unperturbed; he occasionally

muttered to himself hut other
wise seemed calm and even
cheery.
Zilch wandered up. "What are
you doing, Krogomeier?" he said.
"J yam playin' dis machine,"
said Krogomeier, "and it mils' be
fixed on account of 1 ain't won
nothing." "Dolt," said Zilch,
""at is a busted Coke machine."
"Aha!" said Krogomeier, "I wun
nered where the little lemons an'

bells an' things was."
That's the trouble with the modern Coke machine
it looks like a one-armed bandit. But you can still
lind people who claim the old-fashioned Coke ma
chines were bandits in their own right. They swal
lowed nickels regardless of whether they had Cokes
to exchange or not. At the end of the south wing of
Toyon stands a Coke machine scarred and battered
by ireful club men who have played and lost. One
evening a youth stood and pounded on the Coke ma
chine for a considerable time. A gallery gathered.
"Wassamatta, Jack," .said somebody
"Trouble with this machine is that it only works
halfway," the youth replied. "Takes nickels fine, but
it doesn't supply Cokes."
An even more archaic model of Coke machine
once stood behind the wire desk al The Daily. It
was one of those l»i« square boxes with half n I'-mt
of icy slime in the bottom. You paid voiir nickel
and you fished around until you found a ( okt\ A

little hard (o hold onto the bottle, maybe, but it
was a Coke. Unless the handle got stuck. Then you
paid your nickel and went away fuming.
So they replaced this box with a grand new shiny
chromed-up job. In recognition of its merit, it was
placed behind the sports desk. It has a little win
