To the Editor:
Having classes six mornings a week we got a very
special pleasure out of sleeping late on Sunday. We
are quite sure our objections to having the luxury
of Sunday morning sack-time interrupted by the

pealing of (he carillon in Hoover Tower are shared
by many other students. Would it be possible to have
these beautiful notes stifled until sometime after
noon?
