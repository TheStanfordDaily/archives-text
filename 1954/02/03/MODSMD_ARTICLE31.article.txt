To the Editor:
We would like to criticize the criticism of the Stan
ford Players' production, "Climate of Eden" which ap
peared in last Friday's Daily. We attended the per
formance of the play on Thursday evening. The critic
attended the play Wednesday night. However, it
seems from his review that we did not see the same
production as he.
It is true that "Climate ol Eden'Ms not a realistic
light comedy. It was not meant to be. It is also not
a conventional comedy on a "theme of sexual un
conventionally.' Rather, we believe the theme was
that mannerisms, mores, and standards of behavior
are relative to their environment. But the father
says, "This is a way of life, not for everybody, but
for us." Therefore, in attempting this theme, the
author has not tiied to disprove the universats of
right and wrong. The presence of .1 church, sincere
in its own way, proves that
As freshmen (like the critic), we have not seen
enough of the great professional theater to know the
ultimate in dramatics; nevertheless, we were capti
vated by the fine drama and fine imight into charac

ter' which the whole cast, director, and author pro
vided. Very notable are the excellent set, the lighting,
and the special effects. We felt the music was timed
perfectly. (We also wonder how old the critic is that
he can refer back to silent movies.)
Finally, not in the least detracting from Miss Wills—
rud's excellent characterization, we felt that the
entire cast deserve laurels for their fine performances.
It is very unusual Cot' a play—every character of
which is a "good guy" to end up with a cast of
characters each liked as if he or she were the hero
or heroine. This was obviously due to the fine di
rection which made certain that there were unpre
tentious and dynamic personalities (the strongest of
which was Olivia played by Miss Willsrud).
If "The Climate of Eden" makes only for a "spas
modically interesting evening" as the reviewer
claimed, we then hope that the Stanford Players
continue such performances Perhaps not everyone
can appreciate this fine play, we think certainly a
drama critic should
