## S.F. Symphony Called Uneven In Concert 
### BARNEY CHILDS 
The San Francisco Symphony
•nade its 'annual appearance al
Stanford last night before a full
house under the baton of Sandor
Salgo. The program was au am- j
bitious one and, while its besl
portions were very good, the 1
evening was generally uneven.
Berlioz' "Benvenuto Cellini" ov
erture, the opener, was to me some
what, shapeless, especially in the
transitions between orchestral sec
tions that the composer seems to
favor; Mr. Salgo had good control of
the orchestra, but, used what, ap
peared to be an inordinate amount
of left hand.
The most impressive reading was
a razor-edge and sparkling per
formance of Hindemith's "Sympho
nic Metamorphoses on Themes of
von Weber," reflecting all the color,
bravura, and glitter in the score.
The work itself is an amusing one,
especially in the second movement,
and a great deal of this amusement
depends upon the clarity and pre
cision with which the intricate
supporting wind and string passages
come off; last night it was all there.
The demanding flute solo in the
third movement was first-rate.
Naouin Blinder anil Ferenc |
IVlolnar, concert-master and prin
cipal viola, respectively, were fea
tured as soloists playing Mozart's
"Sinfonia C'oncertante," K. 364;
Mr. Moinar played as every good
violist should, but Mr. Blinder
played Mozart like a fisherman
plays a trout. I have seldom been
so disappointed by a solo per
formance.
Mr, Blinder has a "goat" vibrato,
a tendency to rush the tempo, a bow
arm like a North Woods logger, and
his intonation gave me the Uncom
fortable feeling that three-quarters
of the time lie was playing one po
sition lower than was comfortable.
Mr. Salgo did what be could keep
ing Hie orchestra and Mr. Blinder
together, and Mi Moinar served
nobly in the role of catalyst. The
work is one of Mozart's finest, and
the fact that the music came through
in spite of the drawbacks of the so
loist. is a tribute to its composer
Brahms' "Fourth Symphony" is
one of my pet aversions, seeming
part of the time like "two vast and
trunk less of stone" and part
of the time like a soggy fig pud
ding, Mr. Salgo did •< well, man
aging to keep (he sense of the
symphony alive in spite of sor
ghum-like orchestration.
The San Francisco Symphony is
a good orchestra; no one who at
tended last night's performance can
deny this. I felt, however, that the
"big league" approach necessary to
realize full the orchestra's poten
tialities was not always present in
the conducting.

peared to be an inordinate amount
of left hand.
The most impressive reading was
a razor-edge and sparkling per
formance of Hindemith's "Sympho
nic Metamorphoses on Themes of
von Weber," reflecting all the color,
bravura, and glitter in the score.
The work itself is an amusing one,
especially in the second movement,
and a great deal of this amusement
depends upon the clarity and pre
cision with which the intricate
supporting wind and string passages
come off; last night it was all there.
The demanding flute solo in the
third movement was first-rate.
Naouin Blinder anil Ferenc |
IVlolnar, concert-master and prin
cipal viola, respectively, were fea
tured as soloists playing Mozart's
"Sinfonia C'oncertante," K. 364;
Mr. Moinar played as every good
violist should, but Mr. Blinder
played Mozart like a fisherman
plays a trout. I have seldom been
so disappointed by a solo per
formance.
Mr, Blinder has a "goat" vibrato,
a tendency to rush the tempo, a bow
arm like a North Woods logger, and
his intonation gave me the Uncom
fortable feeling that three-quarters
of the time lie was playing one po
sition lower than was comfortable.
Mr. Salgo did what be could keep
ing Hie orchestra and Mr. Blinder
together, and Mi Moinar served
nobly in the role of catalyst. The
work is one of Mozart's finest, and
the fact that the music came through
in spite of the drawbacks of the so
loist. is a tribute to its composer
Brahms' "Fourth Symphony" is
one of my pet aversions, seeming
part of the time like "two vast and
trunk less of stone" and part
of the time like a soggy fig pud
ding, Mr. Salgo did •< well, man
aging to keep (he sense of the
symphony alive in spite of sor
ghum-like orchestration.
The San Francisco Symphony is
a good orchestra; no one who at
tended last night's performance can
deny this. I felt, however, that the
"big league" approach necessary to
realize full the orchestra's poten
tialities was not always present in
the conducting.
The San Francisco Symphony
•nade its 'annual appearance al
Stanford last night before a full
house under the baton of Sandor
Salgo. The program was au am- j
bitious one and, while its besl
portions were very good, the 1
evening was generally uneven.
Berlioz' "Benvenuto Cellini" ov
erture, the opener, was to me some
what, shapeless, especially in the
transitions between orchestral sec
tions that the composer seems to
favor; Mr. Salgo had good control of
the orchestra, but, used what, ap
peared to be an inordinate amount
of left hand.
