Hidden on the top lloor of the
Main Library is a book called
"Robinson Ciusoe." Many
copies ol this book are scat

Howevet, this one is unusual be
cause it is written in Greenlandic
and is part ol the Bender Room's
collection of books and periodi
cals about Greenland.
The Bender Room it> the reading
room for almost all of the special
collections of the Main Library. In
this room, books may be obtained
from the collections of the Borel
Room (Californiana), the Felton Li
brary, and others. The Bender Room
also houses and services the gen
eral rare hook and manuscript col
lections of the University.
The room was named for Alfred
M. Bender, an Irish immigrant. He
came to San Francisco while still
very young and became a successful
businessman there. His interests in
cluded all of the graphic arts, tex
tiles, fine printing, and binding. He
was a philanthropist, and estab
lished several collections in the Bay
Area. II is reported that he gave

Among the general rare books of
the Bender Room is a complete, up

given to Stanford by Mrs. Hcnriette
Von Blon in memory of her son.
The books are characterized by col
orful illustrations and there are a
number that were put out by a Ba
varian press.
The Bender Room's potentiali
ties are not fully realized, accord
ing to Miss Hitchcock. Graduate
students and people in search of
term paper material wander up.
The books are listed in the main
card catalog and the special cards
to till out are found in the Ben

dcr Room. A librarian will get the
hook from the stacks for use.
No hooks can be taken from the
room and fountain pens are not per
mitted. This is to protect costly
hooks from unavoidable accidents.


PRETTIEST AND LARGEST — Miss Jeannette Hitchcock, wiio
heads the Special Collections and Rare Books Departments
in the Bender Room, examines two of the volumes in the room.
She is holding what she believes to be the prettiest book in the
collection, a leather-bound, gold-tooled copy of the first five
books of the Bible. On the table is the largest book, measuring
31 by 22 inches, containing the Offices of the Dead of the Roman
Catholic Litany. This volume was printed between 1690 and
1705 in Mexico. —Daily photo by Ernie Hartz
