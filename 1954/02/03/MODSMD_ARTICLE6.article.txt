# Blaze Quenched At Construction Site
## 
### 
A fire at the construction site of
the Eastman Kodak plant on Page
Mill Road caused about $500 dam
age Monday afternoon
A small house which contains the
plant's air-conditioning system was
damaged. The fire department re

caused by welding equipment which
workmen had forgotten to turn off
when they went home. The de
