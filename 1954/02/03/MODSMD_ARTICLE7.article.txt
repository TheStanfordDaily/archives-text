YELLOWSTONE'S COMPETITOR—A broken water main across the street from the BAC caused
a small geyser for about a half-hour at noon yes terday. PG&E workmen were removing a pipe
line which passed under another line. When th e active pipe was severed a spout about 50 feet
high occurred. Little damage was caused by Ihe broken line, and no campus buildings were
deprived of their water supply. The broken line carries water from Searsville Lake to campus
for irrigation purposes only. —Daily photo by Gil Neill
