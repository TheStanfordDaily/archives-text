# Free Trade Issue Debated
## 
### TONY HODGE 
It was a clear case of academician j
versus businessman in last night's
panel on "Free Trade: Pro and Con"
before a sparsely filled Cubberley
Auditorium.
Two Northern California busi
nessmen argued the case against
free trade while Stanford's Dr. Ed
ward S. Shaw of the Economics De
partment and Dr. Roger Gray, ag
ricultural expert for the Bank of
America, gave support to free trade.
Dr. Gray started off the debate ;
with the view that free trade is
not enough, that there are other
international problems which it
cannot solve. '"But," lie argued,
"it is a start." He maintained that
free trade, in common usage, is
actually "freer trade," and since
it comes from the classic idea of
competition, if should be our goal.
First to oppose Dr. Gray was Sam
Williston of the Cordero Mining
Company, who was concerned be
cause the United States ha:, had to
shut down its own mines since loi
eign metals being mined by cheaper
labor are flooding our markets. He
also was of the opinion that if ever
we were in need of metals badly,
"some other nations wouldn't send
any to us."
Following Williston was his do
bate partner, Dan Turrentien, Di
rector of Research for the Wine In
stitute, who attacked Di Gray as
"being too abstract,"
Turrentien cited the series oi
tariff reductions in this country
on wine and brandy, all amount
ing to more than 50 per cent,
while other nations did not re
duce these tariffs,
Dr. Shaw concluded that any
commodity on the U.S. market can
be claimed as strategic, even water.
"The big trouble behind this
question of free trade," he said, "is
that all industries want government
handouts and the wine industry
wants a handout in the form of a
protective tarff."
