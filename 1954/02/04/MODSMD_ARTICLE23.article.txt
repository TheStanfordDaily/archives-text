# Candy and Charity
## 
### 
At last someone has taken pity on those of
us with a sweet tooth, the unfortunate multi
tudes who simply cannot resist candy and ice
cream.
This weekend there's a moratorium on the
age-old advice to lay dov/n that chocolate and
spurn that strawberry sundae.
This weekend we're being urged to give in
to our weaknesses and stuff ourselves with all
the candy and ice cream we can eat and for
a worthy cause.
It's a benefit sale at the conlectionery in the
Town and Country Village, the shopping center
at the corner of Embarcadero and El Camino.
One third of all proceeds token in tomorrow,

Saturday, and Sunday will go to the Children's
Health Council of the Mid-Peninsula.
The Council, a new organization, is in need of
funds to carry out its purpose of helping local
children who need mental or physical care.
Among its projects are nursery schools for
mentally retarded and emotionally disturbed
children, a rehabilitation center with physio
and occupational therapy for emotionally dis
turbed older children.
Our taste for ice cream and our respect for
the Council's projects suggest to us a trip to the
the benefit sale. We suggest the same to Stan
ford students.
