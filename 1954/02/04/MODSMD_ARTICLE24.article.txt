# The 						Right of the Reviewer
## 
### 
The leviow of the Tuesday Series Concert in
yesterday's Daily drew considerable comment,
good and bad.
Some of the "bad" comment questioned: 1)
the right of the reviewer lo state his criticisms;
'?.) the right of the Daily to publish the review.
In view of such questions, we feel that it is
necessary to clarify our policy in regard to re
view articles.
Each review is presented as .the expression
of only one individual's opinions, and as such
is p/inled under the name ol that individual.
The reviewer is aware that his purpose is to
attempt to describe a concert, play, or book as
it appears to him, not as it appears to the audi
ence. He may mention the apparent reaction
of an audience to the performance of an artist,
but it would be impossible for him to present

a collective opinion on ""each detail of a per
formance.
And it is the reviewer's job lo consider de
tails of perlormance. That consideration, fo
cused on an aitistic effort, cannot be wholly
objective. Art itself implies a subjective inter
pretation and understanding. It is the privilege
and responsibility of the reviewer to choose
the manner in which he wishes to express his
own interpretation and understanding.
The Daily thus respects the rights of its re
viewers (and indeed every observer) to exoress
his own opinions and interpretations. If those
opinions or interpretations are questioned, the
Daily will respect a disagreement —if it con
cerns the performance itself and particular in
terpretations of that performance.
