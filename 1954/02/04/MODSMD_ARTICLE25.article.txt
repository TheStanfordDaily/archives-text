# PRIVATE LIFE

### LARRY CAHN 
FROM FORT ORD
Soldiers, like anyone else, have their thoughts,
doubts, hopes, and beliefs.
After being in the ser vice awhile you perceive a
rather general overall picture of exactly what this
peacetime citizen army thinks about, when time per
mits thinking.
This could go without saying, but for tho

there are few in the army to
day who want war. And those
that do are marked by a rather
childish immaturity both in ac
tual age and in thought. They still
believe they are playing cops and
robbers. They still want a taste
of combat,.
Many of fhe men wish to go
overseas. They feel that as long
as they are in the service I hey
might as well get, something out

of it, see things they haven't seen or aren't likely
to see again.
There is a general ease among the men with no
immediate shooting war. lint let (ho world news
heroine depressing for even a day with threat of
war, and (lie attitude of (In- troops becomes at
once more solemn.
Many still see no reason why they are in the army
and frequently ask the question, "What am 1 doing
here?" That's heard particularly at 4:30 a.m. on any
cold winter morning.
When our actual training—especially that which
involves hand-to-hand combat, digging foxholes,
stringing barb wire, and firing a seemingly impotent
rifle—is compared to M-bomb,s, many feel that such
a war as that we are learning to fight as infantry is
outdated. And that if another world war broke out,
it would be total war and the infantry soldier would
not be heard much of in the face of A and H-bombs
and deadly nerve gas.
One does learn how distinctive war of a total

nature can be, and a single man almost seems to
he useless regardless of his training. A bomb can
destroy so much and take so much life and property
that many feel a war would be of short duration
and might possibly erase mankind completely.
And in line with that same thought the majority of
men hope that the fear of such destruction will
serve as a caution to any nation which may tend
to become overly aggressive. 11 is only such a fear
that will prevent, war, many feel.
There is a strong hope and belief among the men
that some law will be passed which will shorten the
service time of a draftee. This, coupled with the pres
ent, law which permits a soldier to get out in 21
rather than 24 months if he is returning to school,
has caused many to feel that their service time may
not exceed much more than a year and a half.
There is little doubt that we are receiving fine
training, though at times it is tough physically and
mentally and is Hist plain miserable. But still some
completely shun instruction or the insistent plea of
instructors that what we learn here may sometime
save our lives. The majority, however, assimilate
as much as possible, but feel that what we are
learning to do—to kill, or be killed—is so far re
moved from actuality that there is a casual air most
of the time.
If there were war going on now, the attitude would
be more serious, there would be more concentration
by the men, and there would be an overall tension
and fear as to where ami when we would be using
our training. Now it seems as if we may never be
called upon to use it. But that thought, disappoints
only a few.
•For the most part it's difficult to take a man from
his place in civilian life, take away much of his free
dom, put him through severe training, and have him
retain his disposition and a good mental attitude,
when at times the question arises "What, am 1 doing
here?" and the answer is often so nebulous.
