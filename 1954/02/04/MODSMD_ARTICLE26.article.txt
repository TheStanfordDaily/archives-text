## Condon and Public Office 
### 
To the Editor:
In the editorial of the third, which urges more
caution in appraising Condon and Lattimore, it is
implied that, the "guilty beyond a reasonable doubt"
test, which wo use when we prosecute a man for a
crime, should also be applied when that man seeks
public office.
Traditionally, howevei when one desires public
i esponsihility it ha-; b» en necessary to r-:how not

merely that the state would be unsuccessful in a
criminal prosecution, but. that the candidate or ap
pointee is "above suspicion" in the minds of reason
able men.
It may well be that Condon and Lattimore are
not convictable. But from this it. does not follow that
they are qualified for public office.
