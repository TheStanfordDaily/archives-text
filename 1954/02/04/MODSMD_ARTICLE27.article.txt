						Question of Fact?
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I believe that your editorial of Feb. 5 about Ameri
can PO'Ws is not based on fact.
First, Colonel Schwable U.S.M.C., the man who
"confessed" to phony Red claims of U.S. germ war
fare (this case has recently received publicity), will
have his case examined by a board of inquiry. There
is no evidence as yet to substantiate your statement
that the War Department planned to punish Colonel
Schwable. Your editorial said the War Department
was planning to punish POWs who false germ
warfare confession- The Reds lorced germ warfare
confessions from An Force and flying personnel and
the War Department would nave no authority over

these men.
Second, I believe that you will find the U.S. said
they will forgive the 22 "brainwashed" POWs for
having gone over to the Communists, but they did not
promise immunity to punishment for dealing with the
enemy in order to obtain favorable treatment to the
detriment of fellow prisoners.
Are we to condone immunity to P.W.s who have
been condemned by fellow prisoners as informers
and murderers?
It is an insult, to the thousands of valiant. American
soldiers who suffered at the hands of the Reds and
yet did not falter in their loyalty to their country.
