# Charity or Plaques?
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I consider it thoroughly outrageous that a part of
the money to be contributed to the Winter Charity
Drive will be vised to buy a plaque for the living
group contributing the mo t per capita.
It seems to me that we ;it Stanford are old enough
to dispense with the ' gold tai " psychology, and see

that all the money we raise goes where it was in
tended and where it can do the most good; namely,
to charity.
1 suggest that this puerile scheme be dropped
forthwith, lot reasons cogently set out in Matthew
