# Leased Acres, Asters Help Finance Stanford
## 
### GERRY SMITH 
Out of 9,000 acres of land belonging to Stanford, approximately
1,000 are used for educational buildings, the arboretum, athletic
fields and golf course, and campus residences. What happens to
the other 8,000 acres?
The answer is that nearly every acre of land outside of that
listed above is put to work to help finance Stanford. Much land

rs leased on the tenant farmer plan/
by which farmers can lease land for
£i ■ specified length of time for pur
poses approved by the University.
In the past, land was leased to
tenants whenever possible. Before
construction of the Hetch - Hetchy
pipeline, which crosses Stanford
property, much land was virtually
useless for anything besides grazing
animals because of lack of water.
Now, Hetch-Hetchy water can be
used for any crop which brings in
enough money to pay for its pur
chase, such as flowers or strawber
ries.
At present, Stanford leases land to
20 tenants for several purposes. Ap
proximately 7,000 acres are used for
grazing beef and dairy cattle, 700 for
hay and grain, 125 for flowers, 35
for berries, and 200 for recreation.
This last includes the Searsville
Lake area, a vacation spot during
spring quarter and the summer
months.
A soil inventory of Stanford lands
was completed in 1948, revealing
eight types of land suited to differ
ent purposes. By this method, it
was possible to learn what crops to
plant where. For instance, the land
along San Francisquito Creek is
used primarily for flowers and the
sparsely watered land in the foot
hills serves for grazing.
Most flowers grown on University
land are asters. These are raised ei
ther by independent tenants or sub
lessees who get their land from ten
ants. One complication in raising

asters is that they develop a fungus
after one year on any piece of land
and must, he moved from place to
place.
But this disadvantage is nearly
balanced. In earing for them, the
growers rehabilitate the soil for
other crops which increases income
from the land.


ACRES AND ACRES—This is one of the many aster beds cul
tivated on Stanford property by tenant farmers currenily leas
ing acreage. In caring for the asters, the growers muyt use vaii
ous fertilizers which greatly enrich the soil. Then, when the
asters, which must be moved each year due to a fungus which
develops on them but doesn't affect any other crop, are trans
planted, the enriched soil causes a much larger yield of the next
crop planted there. -Daily photo by j.uk Byrne

In the past, land was leased to
tenants whenever possible. Before
construction of the Hetch - Hetchy
pipeline, which crosses Stanford
property, much land was virtually
useless for anything besides grazing
animals because of lack of water.
Now, Hetch-Hetchy water can be
used for any crop which brings in
enough money to pay for its pur
chase, such as flowers or strawber
ries.
At present, Stanford leases land to
20 tenants for several purposes. Ap
proximately 7,000 acres are used for
grazing beef and dairy cattle, 700 for
hay and grain, 125 for flowers, 35
for berries, and 200 for recreation.
This last includes the Searsville
Lake area, a vacation spot during
spring quarter and the summer
months.
A soil inventory of Stanford lands
was completed in 1948, revealing
eight types of land suited to differ
ent purposes. By this method, it
was possible to learn what crops to
plant where. For instance, the land
along San Francisquito Creek is
used primarily for flowers and the
sparsely watered land in the foot
hills serves for grazing.
Most flowers grown on University
land are asters. These are raised ei
ther by independent tenants or sub
lessees who get their land from ten
ants. One complication in raising

asters is that they develop a fungus
after one year on any piece of land
and must, he moved from place to
place.
But this disadvantage is nearly
balanced. In earing for them, the
growers rehabilitate the soil for
other crops which increases income
from the land.


ACRES AND ACRES—This is one of the many aster beds cul
tivated on Stanford property by tenant farmers currenily leas
ing acreage. In caring for the asters, the growers muyt use vaii
ous fertilizers which greatly enrich the soil. Then, when the
asters, which must be moved each year due to a fungus which
develops on them but doesn't affect any other crop, are trans
planted, the enriched soil causes a much larger yield of the next
crop planted there. -Daily photo by j.uk Byrne
Out of 9,000 acres of land belonging to Stanford, approximately
1,000 are used for educational buildings, the arboretum, athletic
fields and golf course, and campus residences. What happens to
the other 8,000 acres?
The answer is that nearly every acre of land outside of that
listed above is put to work to help finance Stanford. Much land
