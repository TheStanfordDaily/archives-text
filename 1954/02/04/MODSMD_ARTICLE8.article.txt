# SRI May Move from Village Location
## 
### HADLEY ROFF 
The Stanford Research Institute
may abandon its headquarters at
the Stanford Village, where it in
tended to construct a large, ultra
modern center, and settle instead in
the University's new industrial dis
trict ofl California Avenue, the In
stitute revealed yesterday.
Final decision to move the Insti
tute from the Village, where it has
been located since 1947, should
come "soon—in a matter of weeks,"

a spokesman lor the Institute said
Search for a new location for the
Institute, which is seriously over
crowded in its present quarters, was
undertaken when it became appar
ent that University attempts to pur
chase the Village might lengthen in
definitely or even fail. The Village
is owned by the federal government.
The University made its first
overture to purchase the former
military hospital more than a year
ago when the government de

elated if surplus. Washington
sources say that i) will be at least
another six weeks before any
conclusion is reached.
The University leased the prop
erty in 1947, converting most of the
barrack - like buildings into resi
dences and sub-leasing the remain
der to the SRI for laboratories and
offices.
Though indicating the Institute
would prefer to locate the new cen
ter at the Village, the spokesman

said SRI must decide quickly on a
site for the building if a full re
search program is to be carried out.
Present facilities at the Village, he
reported, are overly cramped, forc
ing some curtailment in the scope
of research activities. Some scien
tists, he said, are forced to work in
small cubicles that were built has
tily in the hallways of the long,
narrow buildings.
New construction at the Village,
he said, would be out of the ques

t lot 1 until title of the land is clearly
in the hands of the University.
In an attempt to retain the
famed Institute in the Village,
which is located in Menlo Park,
officials of that city yesterday
wired Congressman J. Arthur
Younger urging him to agitate for
quick sale of the property to the
University.
!f is believed that if the Univer
sity should come to terms with the
government within the next two or
three weeks, SRI would accept the
University's offer of 26 acres in the
Village and would locate their cen
ter there.
Otherwise the center will be lo
cated in a 30-acre area in the new
industrial district, behind College
Terrace, a site selected jointly by
University and Institute officials.
Institute officials hope to begin
construction of tbe center, wher
ever it may be located, before the
end of the year.
The Institute, which last year
handled more than $6 million in re
search projects, currently employs
more than 700 persons and expects
to add another 150 to the payroll
this ye;<i The Institute does work
in applied research and has been
employed by industry and the gov
ernment to conduct, experiments in
a wide range of subjects, including
radar and atomic energy .
The SRI was chartered by the
University Board of Trustees as a
separate corporation late in 1946.
It began with a staff of 20.
