# Reds Offer New Solution To German Peace Problem

### 
BERLIN, Feb. 3 (UP)—Russia tonight offered East and West Ger
mans the choice between the European army and permanent divi
sion of their land or reunion and a peace treaty.
• Foreign Minister V. Molotov threw into the Big Four con
ference a proposal for an all-German referendum on the question

"Do you favor a peace treaty or the - *
European Defence Community and
peace accords between West Ger
many and the Western powers?"
The United States, Britain, and
France promptly rejected the pro
posal as absurd.
An official U.S. spokesman said
it was a "loaded question," framed
to appeal to the desire of all Ger
mans for the unification of their
country.
Western delegates agreed that the
surprise proposal was one more
move in a carefully calculated So
viet campaign to wreck the EDC,
both in Germany and France.
Molotov, in a bitter tirade, blasted
the Western plan presented here
last week for reuniting Germany,
the EDC, and the Bonn govern
ment's peace pact with the West.
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles lashed back at Molotov's
broadside which accused the West
of scheming to mobilize a United
Germany on its side in advance.
He demanded a definite Soviet
plan for free all-German elections,
and warned that "great peril for us
all" lurked in the present stalemate
over Germany.
