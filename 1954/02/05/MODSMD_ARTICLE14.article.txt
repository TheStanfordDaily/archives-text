### HELEN DEWAR 
Dr. Carl B. Spaeth, Dean of the
Stanford Law School, last night
stressed the significance of India's
rapid agricultural, industrial, and
cultural rise in a talk entitled "India
in the World Community."
The talk was given in conjunction
withe the "Evening in India" pro
gram sponsored by the Community
Committee for International Stu
dents in Bowman Alumni House.
Dr. Spaeth declared that India is
making a great attempt to meet the
challenge of peacetime progress by
her agricultural extension program.
He showed a movie to illustrate the
importance of the agricultural ex
pert in the life of the Indian farmer.
He feels that India's neutrality is
merely a reluctance to join forces
that might lead her into war. "It is
the belief of many of, the Indian
people that the United States is as
much of a threat to India's peace as
Russia."
The main thing the West can do
about the problem facing India,
Spaeth explained, is to learn about
the "hearts and minds of India.
Deeds and two-way understanding
cannot be undermined by any high
power propaganda."
The program was concluded by a
panel discussion led by three Indian
students.
