## 
### 
Dr. Alfred Dc Grazia, associate
professor of political science, yes
terday said he would decline any
invitation to seek the Democratic
nomination for Congress in the lo
cal district.
It had been rumored in Demo
cratic circles in the Tenth District,
which includes Santa Clara, Santa
Cruz, and San Benito counties, that
the young professor might run for
the .seat now held by Republican
Charles Gubser, a Gilroy farmer
and former teacher.
When first approached about
the rumor several days ago, De
Grazia said that he was "con
sidering the matter seriously." He
said at that time that he had been
asked by several prominent Dem
ocratic leaders in the area to con
sider running for the post.
Primary reason for bowing from
possimle candidacy, the professor
said, is the large size of his family.
He has six children.
''And I believe it is important that
I stay with them," he said.
Referring 1 to the political situa
tion in the district, De Grazia said
that "it looks promising for the
Democrats." He said that Demo
cratic leaders have not as yet set
tled on any candidate, but have
several persons in mind.
De Grazia, aside from his teach
ing duties, also acts as executive of
ficer of the Committee on Research
in Social Sciences. Currently, he is
teaching a course entitled "'Political
Leadership."
