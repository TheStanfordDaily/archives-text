# Molotov: Troops Must Go First
## 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 4 (UP) —Russia
today proposed the withdrawal
of all occupation forces from
Germany before elections to be
run off by a stop gap all-Ger
man government free of "for
eign interference "
Foreign Ministei V. M. Molotov
unveiled the five-point Soviet plan
for Germany a! the tenth session
of the Big Four conference. He
rejected the West's plan for free
elections as the first step toward a
German peace treaty.
The West in turn rejected Mo
lotov's scheme. Some Western
spokesmen said it h id opened such
a wide gulf between East and West
on the German issue that it seemed
to rule out any agreement at this
meeting.
Secretary of Slate John Foster
Dulles said the liustian proposal
would expose West Germany "to
all the vast forces that lie to the
east of it,"and all Western Eu
rope to Communist arnuxl might.
Molotov's plan, differing only
slightly from one : übmitted by the
Kremlin in a note of Aug. 15, 1953,
contained these main poiots:
1. Formation of a provisional all-
German government by the East
and West German parliaments to
replace the existing Bonn and So
viet zone governm .its.
2. Preparation Ijj llie all-Ger
man government of a draft elec
toral law, verifh ation of condi
tions for holding '"free, democratic
elections," and the holding of all-
German elections "without inter
ference of foreign powers."
3. The government would repre
sent Germany in negotiation of a
peace treaty, and prevent Ger
many's "involvement in any coali
tion or military all;ance directed
against any pov which partici
pated in the war against Hitler
Germany."
4. "To insure for the German
people the right to manage their
national affairs themselves," the ex
isting East and West German gov
ernments would be advised to call a
meeting of plenipotentiaries of both
to agree on the procedure of form
ing an all-German government and
its composition, functions, tasks, and
powers.
5. The four ocupation powers
would withdraw all their occupa
tion forces from Germany before
the elections, except for limited
contingents left to "perform pro
tective functions arising out of the
tasks of control by the four pow
ers."
A British spoke.,man, terming the
plan unacceptable, said, "It is diffi
cult to see how the conference can
reach agreement on the German
question."

BERLIN, Feb. 4 (UP) —Russia
today proposed the withdrawal
of all occupation forces from
Germany before elections to be
run off by a stop gap all-Ger
man government free of "for
eign interference "
Foreign Ministei V. M. Molotov
unveiled the five-point Soviet plan
for Germany a! the tenth session
of the Big Four conference. He
rejected the West's plan for free
elections as the first step toward a
German peace treaty.
The West in turn rejected Mo
lotov's scheme. Some Western
spokesmen said it h id opened such
a wide gulf between East and West
on the German issue that it seemed
to rule out any agreement at this
meeting.
Secretary of Slate John Foster
Dulles said the liustian proposal
would expose West Germany "to
all the vast forces that lie to the
east of it,"and all Western Eu
rope to Communist arnuxl might.
Molotov's plan, differing only
slightly from one : übmitted by the
Kremlin in a note of Aug. 15, 1953,
contained these main poiots:
1. Formation of a provisional all-
German government by the East
and West German parliaments to
replace the existing Bonn and So
viet zone governm .its.
2. Preparation Ijj llie all-Ger
man government of a draft elec
toral law, verifh ation of condi
tions for holding '"free, democratic
elections," and the holding of all-
German elections "without inter
ference of foreign powers."

sent Germany in negotiation of a
