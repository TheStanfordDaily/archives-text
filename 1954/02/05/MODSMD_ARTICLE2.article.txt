## 
### 
Possible revision of the ASSU
constitution and by-laws was dis
cussed at Wednesday's Executive
Committee meeting.
Bob Mishell, who was appointed
to the present committee on con
stitutional revision last quarter,
suggested that the problem was a
lack ol specific delegation of re
sponsibilities in the ASSU' consti
tution and by-laws, with the result
that many ASSU officers are over
worked.
After discussion of Mishcll's re
port, Excom approved the follow
ing motion:
"That the present committee meet
this week and submit names for a
new committee lo revise the con
stitution, made up of students not
connected with ASSU administra
tion with the possible exception of
two members ol Excom; and that
this larger committee be charged
with the duties of defining the pur
pose ol the ASSU government, and
how that purpose is being carried
out, and submit recommendations
in the form of revised ASSU by
laws as to how this purpose can hest
be accomplished."
Other decisions approved by Ex
com were: the appropriation of
$1,0(10 to replace the Sunday Night
Movies' sound projector with avail
able second - hand equipment; or
ganizations not recognized by AS
SU may .be included in the Quad at
the discretion of the Quad and the
ASSU student manager; the ap
