The Honor Code issue is not dead.
Wednesday night the Executive Committee
heard a report from Vice-president Jeannie
Bobis on the progress of a special committee
which is formulating plans for a student dis
cussion program on the Code.
Although those plans have not been com
pleted, Excom approved a resolution of com
mendation to the committee for its work. And
we add our voice to Excom's commendation for
the following reasons:
1. The committee, composed of the members
of the Fundamental Standard Committee and
three members of Excom, has avoided the atti
tude of "let's get this thing settled real quick"
in favor of an attitude of "this takes time and
thought, so let's use both."
2. The specific plans v/hich the committee
had defined up to Wednesday night, if sup
plemented Ly additional plans, will provide a
good basis for a successful student discussion
program on the Code. The committee is pre
paring reports on <i history of the Code, an indi
vidual interpretation of the Code, and an indi
vidual analysis of how the Code is working
now.

3. The primary consideration ol the commit
tee is to develop and conduct a program where
by Stanford students can define the Code as
they want it and can improve their respect for
the Code by the process of discussion and defi
nition.
We believe that if the committee continues
its work in the manner in which it has been
conducted so far, the student discussion pro
gram will be successful. By thoughtful plan
ning and an avoidance of hasty action, much of
the emotional quality of previous considera
tions of the Honor Code may be removed.
Within a few weeks the committee should
complete its plans and preparations for the dis
cussion program'in campus living groups. By
that time the student body will have focused its
attention on the several basic questions which
should be considered in the clarification of the
Code.
Student interest in those questions is, we be
lieve, still strong. We hope that that interest
will be channeled into the type of program
which the ASSU committee has taken the first
steps to achieve.
