# The 						VFW and Private 'Witch Hunting'
## 
### 
Last week the Veterans of Foreign Wars is
sued a statement urging its 1,200,000 members
to turn over lo the FBI the names of persons
they suspect of Communist sympathies.
This program was proposed by VFW Na
tional Commander Wayne E. Richards, who
termed as subversive those who "speak out
emphatically against schools, churches, gov
ernment, and our way of life in general. If they
don't like it here, there's apt to be something
wrong with thern."
This week local and , f ;tate VFW posts have
token their own stand on this, most in direct
(jpposition to the national organization. Palo
Alto VFW Commander Alan H. Nichols has
followed the California VFW in stating there
will be no "witch hunting" by members of
his post. He added that he considers the FBI
the proper authority to handle this problem.
On this we agree. No super-patriotic group
of citizen watchdogs should or can usurp the
duties of the FBI. It has always been the right

of any individual to provide the FBI with infor
mation which will help fight crime. If he has
the facts, he should disclose them.
It has also been the right of any individual
to criticize, to "speak out emphatically"
against a local school board, the church, a
government action, or our capitalistic way of
life. These are controversial issues on which
loyal Americans do disagree.
The real wrong comes not when people
"don't like it here," as stated by Commander
Richards, but when they are unable to say what
they don't like. The wrong comes when the
tag "subversive" is attached to any individual
whose opinions are opposed to those held by
any specific group or individual.
We hope other posts will join with the Palo
Alto VFW in denouncing private "witch hunt
ing." Otherwise, we may find that we have
lost our most valuable possession—our faith
and trust in each other.
