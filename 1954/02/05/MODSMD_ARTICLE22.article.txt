### PETE GROTHE 
FRIDAY GRAB-RAG ,
Stanford has an athletic policy of having sports
events on a home-and-home basis. Al Masters, how
ever, departed with thai policy for one particular
institution. On Wednesday, the Stanford wrestling

team met San Quentin Prison
squad at the lalter's home
grounds.
"This," said an athletic de
partment spokesman yesterday,
"is an arrangement which I sus
pect will continue."
* * *
Speaking of San Quentin, a
Stanford trackman tolls us that
they have a track meet each
spring with every evenl included

except the pole vault. (This is the truth!) A special
event is the "Lifers 100, a 100-yard dash restricted
lo those who are serving lifetime sentences.
♦ * *
SEQUEL —I .»ast quarter, we ran an item on Mike
Hudson, ex-Daily sports editor, gambler, patron of
(he arts, and good guy. II alluded to the fact that
Hudson held tin international "Running Out Of Gas
On Palm Drive" award' for effecting that trick on 14
separate occasions. (This doesn't include the ap
proximate 40 other times he has run out of gas at.
other places.)
Yesterday, we drove up Palm Drive and noticed a
1048 green Pontiac; parked at Ihe side of Palm Drive.
Five hundred yards down the road we spotted a
figure trudging up Palm Drive with a gallon can and
a funnel.
Mike had done it for the 15th lime.
