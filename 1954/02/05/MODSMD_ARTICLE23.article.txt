# CAMPUS OPINION
## Agnew Visits: To Help Patients 
### 
To the Editor:
In the issue of Feb. 4 The Daily attempted to in
form students of the weekend projects to Agnew
State Mental Hospital. However, the projects are not
"tours" as was stated by The Daily. Although they
are an eye-opening experience, activity does not
merely involvn observation of those who are ill.
Members of the unit strive to establish contact
with the patients through music, conversation, and
games. Patients at the hospital have been compared
to passengers on a -hip which never seems to
come to port; tlui: the passengers soon grow tired

of talking to each other and quickly lose sight of
land. The goal of the project is to help the patients to
see the land again.
At the hospital on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
the unit'members share the responsibilities of meal
preparation, clean-up, and household chores. It is
an experience of living democratic principles, for the
ultimate responsibilities are up to group decision.
I would appreciate your clarification of the article
of the fourth.
Sincerely yoiars,
ELLEN BOGEN
(I'd note: Thank you.)
