To the Editor:
In response to McCormack, who "savagely
attacked the charity drive in your columns, let me
suggest that our aim in 1 his matter should be to
raise the largest possible amount of money for char
ity—whether that happens to l>e every penny col
lected or not.
Has it evoi occur red to him that more money
might bo gained, NET, with a plaque than without
one" I«ot 11 top l<itl<li11)■ ourselves People just

aren't much good. The reward motive, misplaced
though it may be in this case, is still operative, and
the opportunity of adding another piece to their
trophy room will, stir some groups into action, with-,
out, I think, dissuading those who would otherwise
have contributed.
Let us not live in an ivory tower or upon a moun
tain top Let us come down to earth and support the
charity drive instead of attacking it.
