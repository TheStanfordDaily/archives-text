# Trio of Drives Scheduled To Get Blood Donations
## 
### 
A blood drive is coming to campus again this year. In fact three
blood drives will be held this year, though each in a less concen
trated form than the monstrous record-breaking attempt of last
year.
The drives will be held Feb. 25 -26, April 21-22 23, and May
20-21.
Monday, representatives in campus living groups will pass out

permission slips to students wish- - *
ing to donate blood in the coming 112
drives. Any student between 18.and
21, except married women, must
have his parent's written permis
sion before he may donate.
Permission slips will also be
available in front of the Cellar for
off-campus students.
Sign-ups for appointments will I
begin Feb. 15. They will be taken j
for all three drives at that time.
Most of the blood collected at
Stanford will go to the Depart- j
ment of Defense blood pool where
it is used for making serum alhu- l
min and gamma globulin. Twen
ty-five pints will go to the Mills I
Hospital in San Mateo to replen
ish the blood fund there which
the Palo Alto Hospital draws on
in treating Stanford students.
Sonic of the blood will be shipped I
whole to Japan and Korea where it j
is still being used to treat there- .
cuperating Korean wounded.
This year's drive is being spon- |
sored by Cardinals and the junior :
class. Co-chairmen are Ken Schech- !
ter and Fred Stern. Schechter was '
chairman of last years' five - day j
drive in which 4,640 pints—a colle

giate world retort!—were collected.
This year the Red Cross will set
up headquarters in the Women's
Clubhouse and will take donors
from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Club
house has a 12-bed capacity.
