## WRIGHT ANGLES A Roster of Talent 
### 
The perennial crybabies who can't stand winners should have had cause
to howl and moan to their hearts' content this basketball season. A quick
survey of Johnny Wooden's roster of talent at UCLA should have been
enough to bring cries of "Break up the Bruins."
But the cries haven't been heard and they really haven't been neces
sary. The Bruins seem to have broken themselves up. Oh, the race isn't
over, ol course, and Cal has quite a quintet of its own up in Berkeley, of
course, but already UCLA seems to have blown its chance for the PCC's
southern crown. The Bruins dropped a vital doubleheader to Cal to
start the league campaign, and then bounced back like a medicine ball by
losing to the far-inlerior SC Trojans. So now the Bruins repose in the
FCC cellar, matching Stanford's one and three record.
Why has this happened to the team which was co-favored with Cal to
win the championship? Cal was favored because of two individual stars—
Hob IVlcKcen and Hob Matheny; UCLA because of a roster full of
basketball ability. Could it be that the Bruins have failed to knit be
cause they have too much talent Scan the list of Uclan manpower—
Livingston, Moore, Bragg, Bane, Naulls, Tal't, Ridgway, Miller, Ifibler.
Almost any group ol three, as a unit, could iuinp on to Stanford's first
string.

But Johnny Wooden seems to be
having the same problems Jess Hill
has had with SC's football corpo
ration (although perhaps this com
parison isn't fair to Wooden.)
He hasn't been able to consolidate
the line individual potential into a
devastating team push. He has shut
tled his stars on and ofi' the court,
trying to keep five men who are
"hot" in the game at the same time.
Sometimes this can pay big divi
dends. If you can pull the right men
off the bench at the right time. In
the long run, however, it usually
pays to rely on six or seven regu
lars instead of dipping down to the
third team.
I have only seen UCLA twice,
both times against weak Oregon.
The Bruins' scoring punch was fear
some; first, second, and third string
ers kept the ball pouring through
the nets. But something was lack
ing. They weren't smooth. They
mis s e d numerous opportunities.
Against Oregon it didn't matter, but
against Cal it was different.

The Bruins, nonetheless, look beyond their poor start and present last
place ranking and claim they are still in the PCC fight. They have a batch
of games left in the Westwood Gym, which has been a slaughter house
for invading teams. And Wee Willie Naulls (or should it be "Whee Willie"?),
the sophomore with the long arms, appears to have his confidence after
whipping home 16 points in seven minutes against SC.
This week end the Bruins will have a chance to move off the bottom
rung of the PCC ladder and demonstrate at the same time that the home
floor is the charm. And il you look at UCLA and Stanford objectively,
you find the evidence strongly in the Bruins' favor. Player for player,
the Bruins arc better than the Indian crew which Bob Burnett will send
into the Westwood shoe box.
Johnny Moore, the lanky junior from Gary, Indiana, who is a loose
jointed court magician on occasion, and Ron Bane, the sometimes-inter
ested sharpshooter, are as strong a pair of forwards as you can find on the
coast. Barie is a smaller edition of Bob McKeen (smaller in height, that
is), and he can be just as deadly as McKeen from around the key. He plays
half the time, though, in the lackadaisical manner which was his high
school style; otherwise he could be All-Coast.
Russ Lawler. the Card's long-legged hookshot specialist, is a better
center right now than either Naulls or Mike Hibler. But Naulls. y potential
terror, is beginning to improve, as 1 said above, and will be heard from
before too long. Ilibler, who was first string last year, is always good for
about a dozen markers.
Either of the Bruin guards will be a match for little George Selleck,
the cat-like Card playmaker. Oon Bragg, who was switched from forward
in midseason. is as fine an all-around star as IJCLA has had in years.
Hon Livingston, the roundman, the Bruins' little general, is the spark
plug. Thus the Selleck wizardry, which captivated LA fans last month, is
well challenged again.
With Morris Taft, the wisp-like sophomore guard; Eddie Miller, another
soph whose set-shot accuracy placed him on the first string when the
season opened; Don Ridgway, the Westwood hero of three years ago; and
so many more to back up the regulars, the Bruins should be too much for
the Indians this week end.
Just as they should have been too much for Cal and SC!

ested sharpshooter, are as strong a pair of forwards as you can find on the
coast. Barie is a smaller edition of Bob McKeen (smaller in height, that
is), and he can be just as deadly as McKeen from around the key. He plays
half the time, though, in the lackadaisical manner which was his high
school style; otherwise he could be All-Coast.
Russ Lawler. the Card's long-legged hookshot specialist, is a better
center right now than either Naulls or Mike Hibler. But Naulls. y potential
terror, is beginning to improve, as 1 said above, and will be heard from
before too long. Ilibler, who was first string last year, is always good for
about a dozen markers.
Either of the Bruin guards will be a match for little George Selleck,
the cat-like Card playmaker. Oon Bragg, who was switched from forward
in midseason. is as fine an all-around star as IJCLA has had in years.
Hon Livingston, the roundman, the Bruins' little general, is the spark
plug. Thus the Selleck wizardry, which captivated LA fans last month, is
well challenged again.
With Morris Taft, the wisp-like sophomore guard; Eddie Miller, another
soph whose set-shot accuracy placed him on the first string when the
season opened; Don Ridgway, the Westwood hero of three years ago; and
so many more to back up the regulars, the Bruins should be too much for
the Indians this week end.
Just as they should have been too much for Cal and SC!


JOHNNY WOODEN
—Too much talent?
The perennial crybabies who can't stand winners should have had cause
to howl and moan to their hearts' content this basketball season. A quick
survey of Johnny Wooden's roster of talent at UCLA should have been
enough to bring cries of "Break up the Bruins."
But the cries haven't been heard and they really haven't been neces
sary. The Bruins seem to have broken themselves up. Oh, the race isn't
over, ol course, and Cal has quite a quintet of its own up in Berkeley, of
course, but already UCLA seems to have blown its chance for the PCC's
southern crown. The Bruins dropped a vital doubleheader to Cal to
start the league campaign, and then bounced back like a medicine ball by
losing to the far-inlerior SC Trojans. So now the Bruins repose in the
FCC cellar, matching Stanford's one and three record.
Why has this happened to the team which was co-favored with Cal to
win the championship? Cal was favored because of two individual stars—
Hob IVlcKcen and Hob Matheny; UCLA because of a roster full of
basketball ability. Could it be that the Bruins have failed to knit be
cause they have too much talent Scan the list of Uclan manpower—
Livingston, Moore, Bragg, Bane, Naulls, Tal't, Ridgway, Miller, Ifibler.
Almost any group ol three, as a unit, could iuinp on to Stanford's first
string.

But Johnny Wooden seems to be
having the same problems Jess Hill
has had with SC's football corpo
ration (although perhaps this com
parison isn't fair to Wooden.)
He hasn't been able to consolidate
the line individual potential into a
devastating team push. He has shut
tled his stars on and ofi' the court,
trying to keep five men who are
"hot" in the game at the same time.
Sometimes this can pay big divi
dends. If you can pull the right men
off the bench at the right time. In
the long run, however, it usually
pays to rely on six or seven regu
lars instead of dipping down to the
third team.
I have only seen UCLA twice,
both times against weak Oregon.
The Bruins' scoring punch was fear
some; first, second, and third string
ers kept the ball pouring through
the nets. But something was lack
ing. They weren't smooth. They
mis s e d numerous opportunities.
Against Oregon it didn't matter, but
against Cal it was different.

The Bruins, nonetheless, look beyond their poor start and present last
place ranking and claim they are still in the PCC fight. They have a batch
of games left in the Westwood Gym, which has been a slaughter house
for invading teams. And Wee Willie Naulls (or should it be "Whee Willie"?),
the sophomore with the long arms, appears to have his confidence after
whipping home 16 points in seven minutes against SC.
This week end the Bruins will have a chance to move off the bottom
rung of the PCC ladder and demonstrate at the same time that the home
floor is the charm. And il you look at UCLA and Stanford objectively,
you find the evidence strongly in the Bruins' favor. Player for player,
the Bruins arc better than the Indian crew which Bob Burnett will send
into the Westwood shoe box.

"hot" in the game at the same time.
Sometimes this can pay big divi
dends. If you can pull the right men
off the bench at the right time. In
the long run, however, it usually
pays to rely on six or seven regu
lars instead of dipping down to the
third team.
I have only seen UCLA twice,
both times against weak Oregon.
The Bruins' scoring punch was fear
some; first, second, and third string
ers kept the ball pouring through
the nets. But something was lack
ing. They weren't smooth. They
mis s e d numerous opportunities.
Against Oregon it didn't matter, but
against Cal it was different.

The Bruins, nonetheless, look beyond their poor start and present last
place ranking and claim they are still in the PCC fight. They have a batch
of games left in the Westwood Gym, which has been a slaughter house
for invading teams. And Wee Willie Naulls (or should it be "Whee Willie"?),
the sophomore with the long arms, appears to have his confidence after
whipping home 16 points in seven minutes against SC.
This week end the Bruins will have a chance to move off the bottom
rung of the PCC ladder and demonstrate at the same time that the home
floor is the charm. And il you look at UCLA and Stanford objectively,
you find the evidence strongly in the Bruins' favor. Player for player,
the Bruins arc better than the Indian crew which Bob Burnett will send
into the Westwood shoe box.
Johnny Moore, the lanky junior from Gary, Indiana, who is a loose
jointed court magician on occasion, and Ron Bane, the sometimes-inter
ested sharpshooter, are as strong a pair of forwards as you can find on the
coast. Barie is a smaller edition of Bob McKeen (smaller in height, that
is), and he can be just as deadly as McKeen from around the key. He plays
half the time, though, in the lackadaisical manner which was his high
school style; otherwise he could be All-Coast.
Russ Lawler. the Card's long-legged hookshot specialist, is a better
center right now than either Naulls or Mike Hibler. But Naulls. y potential
terror, is beginning to improve, as 1 said above, and will be heard from
before too long. Ilibler, who was first string last year, is always good for
about a dozen markers.
Either of the Bruin guards will be a match for little George Selleck,
the cat-like Card playmaker. Oon Bragg, who was switched from forward
in midseason. is as fine an all-around star as IJCLA has had in years.
Hon Livingston, the roundman, the Bruins' little general, is the spark
plug. Thus the Selleck wizardry, which captivated LA fans last month, is
well challenged again.
With Morris Taft, the wisp-like sophomore guard; Eddie Miller, another
soph whose set-shot accuracy placed him on the first string when the
season opened; Don Ridgway, the Westwood hero of three years ago; and
so many more to back up the regulars, the Bruins should be too much for
the Indians this week end.
Just as they should have been too much for Cal and SC!
