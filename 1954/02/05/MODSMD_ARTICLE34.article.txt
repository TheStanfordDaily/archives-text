# Buggers Play COP Under Pacific Arcs
## 
### 
Tonight the Stanford varsity rug
by team travels to Stockton to meet
COP. The game will take place in
Baxter Stadium at 8:30.
A 30-man Indian squad will play
their second game. of the season,
having won a 6 to 5 thriller over the
San Francisco Olympic Club.
In spite of the fact that rugby is
only in its second season at COP,
the Tigers may prove to be a diffi
cult obstacle in the Indians' victory
path. COP will present a football
laden squad to oppose Stanford.
Last year the Cards edged COP
on a Dorsey Atkinson penalty kick
in the last minute of play.
