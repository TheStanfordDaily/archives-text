# Stanford's Red Barn Is Center of Riding Activity
## 
### JOANNE OLSON 
Every farm must have its barn, and Stanford is no exception.
The Red Barn, located beyond the golf course off Junipero Serra,
is the picturesque center of Farm riding activities and home of the
Stanford Riding School.
This year the Riding School has a new director, Colonel Alex

Sysin. Colonel and Mrs. Sysin
bought out the previous owners
and took over on the first of Janu
ary.
Colonel Sysin has a colorful his
tory as a horseman. He is a former
member of the Russian Imperial
Cavalry and is now an American
Horse Show Association judge.
Before coming to Stanford, Colo
nel Sysin was associated with the
Flintridge Hunter Trials Field in
Pasadena. At Flintridge he devel
oped what nationally known East
ern horsemen called one of the na
tion's best hunter and jumper
courses, and each spring presented
a hunter and jumper show.
The Red Barn offers many serv
ices to Farm •students: training in
both English and Western riding,
boarding facilities, and organized
and casual rides.
They have many plans for the
Barn, including a new jumping
course, riding ring, and stabling for
the school horses.
Colonel and Mrs. Sysin will
work under the University's
Physical Education Departments
as instructors in the riding
courses, and hope to offer a course
in jumping to interested students.
In addition to the horses used for
these courses, the Barn houses the
polo horses and a string oi show
hunters which the Sysins brought
with them.
