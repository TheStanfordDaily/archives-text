### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 (UP)—Sen. John W. Bricker (R„ O.) of
fered a compromise today for his amendment to curb the Presi
dent's treaty-making powers, and Republican leaders abandoned
hope of getting final action for another two weeks.
Bricker unveiled his compromise as Chairman Homer Ferguson

! (R., Mich.) of the Senate GOP Pol
icy Committee urged the Senate to
approve a much milder compromise
drawn up by the Republican leader
ship.
Meanwhile, A 11 orn e y General
Herbert Brownell, Jr., told a news
j conference he could not support a
version sponsored by Sen. Walter F.
George (D., Ga.). George, who has
considerable Democratic support,
said in turn lie cannot accept the
Bricker compromise.
Bricker's latest proposal retains
the principle of his original version,
but he offered to give up the ad
ministration - condemned "which"
clause that would require Congres
sional approval, and sometimes ac
tion by state legislatures, to permit
treaty provisions to become domes
tic law.
He substituted for it. a provision
that v/ould make a treaty or other
international agreement effective as
domestic law through Congressional
election alone or if two-thirds of
the Senate waives such legislation
i in the case of treaties.
Sen. Herbert Lehman (D., N.Y.)
called any attempt to make "a hasty
| political compromise" "wrong."
