# OLIE'S READY
## Card, Bruin Cagers Clash In Southland 
### RAY LOYND 
The Cards are stacked against
UCLA tonight as Boss Bob Bur
nett's basketballers whirl south
for a double-decker in West
wood's matchbox gym.
Guard Oleg Suzdaleff is finally set
to go and Stanford will throw its
top guard combine into the starting
lineup for the first time in confer
ence play this season. SuzdalefT,
top-scoring Indian next to potter
Ron Tomsic last year, boxed up his
knee early in January and has
played little since.
But tonight he's ready to fire up
Stanford's backcourt and start his
first conference game across from
perky George Selleck against the
highest-scoring basketball team in
UCLA history.
The Indians depart from the San
Francisco airport at 11 a.m. today
via Western Airlines and will board
up in the Hollywood Knickerbocker.
The two - game series, along with
that between USC and Cal across
the Bay, resumes conference play

after the Stanford-excluded South
ern Division trio called time out
three weeks ago to battle the books.
Although both squads enter the
game with identical 1-3 conference
records, tied for last place behind
the Bears and Trojans, UCLA is
loaded with paper evidence point
ing to a double victory.
Coach Johnny Wooden's Bruins
boast a strong height advantage
and (lie top rebounder in (he
league, guard Don Bragg; three
195.'] Southern Division second
team members: forward John
Moore and guards Bon Livingston
and Bragg; superior over-all team
shooting; a reserve, Dick Bidg
way, who was All-Conference in
1951; and their home gym. UC
LA is notoriously hard to beat
within its walls.
However: the Bruins and Indians
each dropped a pair to California
and split with USC. And both post
almost identical season records:
13-4 for Stanford and 12-5 for UC
LA. And Stanford, unlike UCLA,
once led Cal at half - time by 11
points.
Burnett will follow his usual
line-up except for replacing holler
man 5-10 Ron Wagner with 5-11
veteran Suzdaleff: springy 6-4 Bar
ry Brown and 6-2 Don DeLong at
