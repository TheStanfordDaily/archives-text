# Personally Valuable

Tli* Waiter Quarter Charity Drive was not
just another worthy cause asking for your
money, and the solicitor who tapped on your
floor was not just another person with hand ex
tended. We feel that the contributions made
by the American Cancer Society, the Heart As
sodation, and the Community Chest are per
sonally valuable to us now and will be for the
rest of our lives.
The Stanford YWCA is run largely on funds
budgeted by the Palo Alto Community Chest,
..mounting to over $5,000 lor 1953-54. As stu
dents here, we benefit from the Y luncheon dis
cussions, lectures, meeting places, and office
privileges available for our use.
In considering the personal value of con
tributing to the Cancer and Heart funds, who
can deny that many of our parents and relatives
now, and we ourselves in years to come, will
live longer because of research now in prog
ress? Heart diseases alone currently account
for one of every two deaths in this country, and
the cancer death rate is still rising.
Three charitable institutions whose work is

of undeniable worth to us individually, as a
community, as a nation—we think they deserve
more than a single week's loosely organized
presentation to the students, more than plastic
legs to be filled, and more than plaques and
prizes to be won..
Don't mistake us —we consider the element
of competition in working toward the highest
per capita contribution a healthy, worthwhile
means of overcoming our customary inertia.
But cannot the fact of having made the highest
per capita contribution be sufficient stimulus
and reward? We hope that the recent letter to
the editor spotlighted the bit of truth when it
stated that we no longer require the "gold star
psychology" of our Sunday school days.
In conclusion, we suggest that future campus
drives for such important charities as the Amer
ican Cancer Society, the Heart Association, and
the Community Chest spend more time inte
grating educational talks in living groups, post
ers, and pamphlets during the week previous
to the drive for contributions.
