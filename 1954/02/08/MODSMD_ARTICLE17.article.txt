## Example of 'Ostrich Age' 
### 
'To the Editor:
Thursday's letter criticizing your editorial on Con
fli'f'ssman Bob Condon is another frightening example
' jf the Ostrich Age. The writer urges that the "guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt" standard has no appli
cation to one Keeking public office. For the purposes
ol' argument let us accept that contention.
The learned writer goes on to say: "Traditionally,
however, when one desires public responsibility,
if has been necessary lo show not merely thai (he
stale would be unsuccessful in a criminal prosecu
tion, but thai (he candidate or appointee is above
suspicion in the minds of reasonable men." The
tradition the writer speaks of is lovely fantasy, hut
it has no basis in reality, past or present. Reason
able men may hope that it shall be so in the future.
Did such a tradition rule today, when guilt by
mere accusation rides high, we should have no man
worth his salt in public office; we still have some.
I,ike Caesar's wife our officeholders might be. but

such vapid, innocuous, ineffective leaders they
would be that it would be better to open wide our
gates to the armies of the Cominform than slowly
to perish from internal insipidity.
The Ostrich Age it is when our President grandly
says it's an American tradition (which it is) for
every man to have the right to face his accuser' but
when the President does nought to help maintain
this right, if in fact he hasn't substantially aided in
weakening it. The Ostrich Age it is when such as
the learned writer imply that guilt by association is
traditional with us (which it isn't) â€”how fares Mr.
Chief Justice Warren by this standard?
The rights of free men are not just desiccated
shibboleths to be resurrected every July Fourth, but
rather they are precious rights which we must fight
hard and honestly, decently and democratically, to
preserve and maintain here at home if we aren't to
have to bloodily wai at home and abroad.
