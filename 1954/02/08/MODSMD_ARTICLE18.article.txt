"Of the legislative program Dr. Kreps dis
approved most strongly of the President's plans for

"The real need in America has been to encourage
risk capital. In order lor business to get this in
abundance the investor must be encouraged to put
his money in shares. Hence the President's plan to

far-sighted reform that could be made to attract
investors, and thus help America finance new plants
and equipment."
It seems that America is built on risk capital and
its future depends on it A. II EDWARD
