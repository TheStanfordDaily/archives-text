# No 'Puerile Scheme'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In reply to Mr. McCormick's letter of Feh. 4 con
raining the "puerile scheme" of presenting a plaque
to the living group contributing the most per capita,
we of the Winter Drive Committee feel that Mr.
Mi Cormick has missed the point entirely by over
looking the $100 contribution to charity which ac
companies the plaque as an award. The plaque
it. elf will be merely an inexpensive recognition here
at Stanford to verify the much more important and
appreciated contribution to charity.

The plaque is offered as an incentive to the spirit
of competition (Mr. McCormick's "gold star psy
chology") which prevails in our society and which
is used as a means (o more important ends. In this
case it is a means to encourage more aid to the very
worthwhile and necessary charities of cancer, heart,
and Community Chest.
