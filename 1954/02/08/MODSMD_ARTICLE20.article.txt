# The 						Symphony Review
## 
### 
To the Editor:
The major objections to Mr. Childs' review of
Tuesday night's performance of the San Francisco
Symphony seem to lie not in whether or not the
evaluation is agreed to by all who read it, but in
the manner in which the evaluation is presented.
.Mr. Chillis' review of the "Benvenuto Cellini
Overture" is perfectly clear, and the criticism of
the Hindeniith piece is well done. Barney Childs'
greater understanding of contemporary music is
shown l»,v the way in which he presents his criti
i isms here. Although l*do not agree with his opin
ion of the llindemith selection, he has stated his
i ;tse clearly enough to induce me to try lo see his
point of view.
However, in the criticisms of Mozart's "Sinfonia
Concertante" and of Brahms' "Fourth Symphony"
Mi. Childs lets emotion run away with common
sense. Phrases such as "played Mozart as a fisherman
plays a trout," "bow arm like a North Woods logger,"
and "soggy fig pudding" have no place in an impar
tial review What possible analogy does Mr Childs

find between trout-fishing and playing Mozart?
Likening Brahms' "Fourth Symphony" to "Ozyman
dias" does not seem to be valid either; at least the
ages have not destroyed (he music yet. And how
many people reading the idea had any idea what was
meant by " 'goat' vibrato"? Or "sorghum-like or
chestration"? Or even "'two vast and trunk-less
legs of stone'"?
As for the evaluation of Brahms' "Fourth," it is
of minor interest to your readers whether or not
Mr. Childs likes the piece. It is the presentation
which should he judged here; the merits of the
composition have been weighed before.
If Mr. Childs would use fewer emotional words in
his reviews, and use more words that have a dis- i
eerniblp relation to the subject at hand, indignant
replies to his articles would pretty well cease. It
would be impossible for anyone to write a review
with which everyone else agreed; but opinions can
be stated without brutally personal references, and
fewer feelings would Ix- hurt if Mr. Childs would do j
just that -JOAN CORETELYOU 1
