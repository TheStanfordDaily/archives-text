# Bayar Will View Exhibit
## 
### JOANNE OLSON 
When President Celal Bayar
of Turkey visits the campus to
day, one of the things he will
see is an exhibit of materials
especially selected from the
Turkish collection of Hoover
Library.
The entire collection, one of the
most extensive in the country, num
bers over 5,000 .some of which
date from 1875, and includes Turk
ish periodicals, government docu
ments, educational materials, min
utes of the parliament, and hooks
on Turkey.
The special exhibit, which will be
open to the public from B:.'jo a.m.
to 1 p.m. tomorrow, will be ar
ranged on tables in the leading
room of Hoover Library.
One table will contain materials
on the War of Independence (1919
to 1922) and the period of transfor
mation from the Ottoman Empire to
the modern republic.
Another will hold government
records and legal and statistical re
ports. Outstanding in this category,
according to Hoover Library offi
cials, is the collection oi minutes of
the Ottoman Parliament, which,
with the collection of minutes for
Republican Turkey, covers the pro
ceedings in the Turkish parliament
from 1908 lo the present.
Turkish |>olitliterature is of
great importance, Library spokes
men said, and the collection con
tains many of the periodicals
which have been the main media
for political expression in the
twentieth century. They include
new political platforms, pamphlets
of comment on them, and histori
cal surveys of the policies framed
since the founding of the Repub
lic in 1923.
Also on display will be educa
tional materials—programs, reports,
and textbooks from primary to uni
versity level. These include infor
mation on the Village Institutes,
programs originated by the Turks to
train the peasants to teach each
other.
Since 80 per cent of the Turkish
population lives in villages of
less than 2,000 people, stories of
their lives and needs form an
important part of the national
literature. Some of these stories,
real ami fictional, will be part of
the exhibit.
The materials in the Turkish col
lection have been obtained through
Hoover Library representatives in
Turkey and through gifts from the
Turkish government, university, and
interested individuals. Most of those
from the early 20th century came
from the purchase of the Saadet
Dagdeviren library in Istanbul.
The special exhibit which Pres
ident Bayar will see was arranged
by Dr. Christina Phelps Harris,
professor in Hoover Institute and
Library anil curator of the Middle
East Collections, and Dr. Eleanor
Bisbee, research associate on Tur
key.
