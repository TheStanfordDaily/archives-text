## Braves Nudge Frosh 44-41; Trounce Stockton JC 88-61 
### BOB DURAND RAY WADDINGTON 
In an exciting but loosely played
basketball game on Friday, the jun
ior varsity Braves came from be
hind to the freshman
Papooses, 44-41, in the Pavilion.
The deciding factor, which
emerged out of the wild contest, was
the missing of 20 free throws by the
frosh, 11 coming in the final period.
The unusually low - scoring tilt
was marked by tight pressing de
fense and determined offense on the
part of both teams, although during
the -last half the ball would change
hands as many as six times without
a point being netted.
Mahoney Out
The Indian yearlings, who played
without their star forward Denis
Mahoney, got off to a fast start arid
by the time the first quarter had
ended they were leading the Braves,
15-7. Leading the early attack were
Carl Isaacs and Beppo Dyer, who
meshed 10 points between them.
In th<2 second period, Coach
George Lynn's JV's gained control
of the backboards and pulled up to
23-23, shortly before the intermis
sion, but two free throws by frosh
captain Hap Wagner gave the Pa
pooses a two-point, lead going into
the third quarter.
Braves GralÂ» Lead
Shortly into the half, Rob Mc-
Grath sank two charity tosses to
give the Braves a 28-27 lead, their
first of the game. However, with
Nick Vojvodich and Dyer leading
the way, the yearlings came back to
take a 41-36 advantage with but two
minutes to play.
John Hendricks and McGrath
then hit for field goals to make the
score 41-40, and finally Bob Milton
drove in for a layup to put the JV's
ahead to stay. The last Iwo mark
ers were also made by Milton on
free throws.

Coach George Lynn's Braves
romped to an easy 88-61 victory
over Stockton College in the Pavil
ion Saturday afternoon. TTie under
manned Stockton quintet fought de
terminedly, but were unable to halt
the Stanford attack as the Braves
went on their second highest scoring
spree of the season.
Every Stanford player broke into
the scoring column as Lynn took
the opportunity to substitute freely.
Top scorer in the affair was John
Hendricks, who garnered a total of
21 points. Hendricks is the only
Brave to top 20 points in a game this
season. Other high scorers for the
Braves were Gunnar Christiansen
with 13 and Battling Bill Tarr with
10.
Stockton Lead Fades
Stockton took an early first-quar
ler lead, but it had evaporated by
the time the buzzer sounded. Offi
cials' whistles shrilled continually
as zealous referees called 1(5 per
sonals in the first period. Going
into the second period on the bot
tom nf a 22-18 score, Stockton got
hot, sinking five for six from the
floor. However, Stanford countered
with a scoring flurry of their own,
paced by Tarr ' and Christiansen.
In the third quarter, the Braves
eased a little further out in front,
playing a steady type of game.
Quarter score: 64-51.
Final Period Collapse
The final period showed Stock
ton's game collapsing as three of
their starters fouled out. The Farm
players were scoring practically at
will as the game ended, 88-61.
High point man for the Stockton
ites with 15 was their classy little
guard Byron Cheney. Also contrib
uting to the Stockton effort were
Jim Choate and Tommy Vail, with
13 and 10 respectively.
