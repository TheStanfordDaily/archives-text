# Cards Waxed Twice by Bruins
## 
### RAY LOYND 
Stanford's horses ran for
three - quarters of the course
Friday and Saturday nights,
then faltered and sprawled in
the dust as UCLA whipped by
for a pair of 19-point victories
in the southland.
The double jolt further sealed the
Indians' position as low man in the
Southern Division race while ele
vating the Bruins to a 3-3 second
place tie with USC. Cal, bowing
once to SC, is two strides ahead, 5-1.
Except for Friday's affair produc
ing more baskets, it was the same
story both nights. First it was 92-
73 in an unusually fast-paced tilt,
Stanford leading by one at the
quarter, trailing by two at (lie half
and three-quarters mark, then com
pletely falling out of it in the fourth
stanza. Saturday strikingly fol
lowed Friday's pattern with UCLA
achieving a 77-58 win and plaster
ing a 1-5 won-lost record all over
Stanford's billboard.
George Selleck and linss Law
ler led Stanford's weekend scor
ing, potting 33 points, while for
the Hruins guard Ron Livingston
and forward Joli n ny IVI oo ie
hanged in 38. The restoration of
guard Oleg Suzdaleff was a boon
to the Cards, the 5 11 senior
pumping in 23 counters in tin
two contests.
The first game set and tied a hat
ful of Stanford-UCLA series rer
ords. The IGS points totaled the
highest combined score in the 2(>
years of competition between Un
learns, the 92 markers were the
highest winning score for UCLA
against Stanford, and Stanford's 73
digits tied its top losing score ever
recorded against the Bruins. The
match also missed by only three
points equaling the highest total
scoring record in the UCLA gym.

12. But Indian forward Barry Brown '
drove in with two layups, Lawler j
followed with a pair of hooks, and '
Stanford led 20-19 as the second j
quarter began.
In the next ten minutes the lead
changed hands II times, with Sel
leck connecting on two jump ami
push shots ami Lawler swishing a
trio of field yjoals, but reserve
Dick Ridgway was also potting for
j UCLA ami Johnny Wooden's
j quintet departed from a spirited
first-half scoring rash leading by

a thread, 44-42.
The hosts bounded ahead 53-46 in
the third period, but Suzdaleff hit
three times from the floor and for
ward Don DeLong bucketed three
gift tosses to close the gap to two
points, til - 5'J, starting the final
quarter.
Rapidly the Bruins began click
ing. The Ronnies, Bane and Living
ston, shot their team off to a 72-62
lead. It narrowed to 74-69 but
Wooden's charges soon drove the
Cards into the floor as Selleck
louled out and Moore and four re
serves started banging in freely.
Lawler finished with 20 counters,
Selleck and Suzdaleff 12 apiece.
The next evening another jam
med UCLA house saw the identi
cal thing happen over again, but
the seorekeeper wasn't as active.
Brown pushed the Indians to a
2-0 lead and they never trailed
for the remainder of the quarter,,
once racing to their biggest lead
of the series, 13-6, and entering
the second quarter ahead 14-11.
The advantage changed teams six
times before UCLA finally pulled
away on the shooting strength of
Moore and guard Don Bragg and
led 31 - 27 at half-time. Selleck

closed the margin to 39-37 midway
in the third quarter, but the white
shirted Bruins had advanced their
half-time lead to six points, 48-42,
as the climax quarter started off.
But again UCLA dominated the
last minutes of the game. Delxmg,
who had fouled three times in the
second quarter, suddenly got his
fifth. Livingston, high Bruin next to
Moore's 20 points with IG, fouled out
a few minutes later. Then Selleck,
high for Stanford with 18, collected
his fifth and Wooden and Bob Bur
nett began wildly shuffling their
players. It all ended a few minutes
later in a rash of reserve activity
and UCLA coasting in the winner.
