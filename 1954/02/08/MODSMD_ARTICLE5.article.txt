# CHAMBER MUSIC
## Concert Is Called 'Very Interesting' 
### RON ROSEN 
Featuring works by Bay Area
composers, Sunday's chamber music
concert proved to be a very inter
esting and profitable journey into
the fields of new music.
'ihe Divertissement for oboe, horn,
and bassoon by Leonard Ratner is
another shining light in this young
composer's, constellation oi compo
sitions. The work, borrowing skill
fully from Italian opera and the Vi
ennese waltz, is a delightful and
charming essay in the modern idiom.
What struck this reviewer most was
the beautiful blending of instru
ments. The reading given by Turner
Bledsoe, Irving Crawford, and Ste
phen Fox did full justice to the
music.
Herbert 15. Nanuey directed his
University Singers in three beau
tiful modal works by sixteenth
century composers, but the Three
Fuguing Tunes by William Bill
ings stole the show with their
; catching and difficult melodies.
The Sonata for bassoon and piano
by Barney Childs can best be de
scribed as a violent form of expres
sionism. As such, it does not take
advantage of the musical discoveries
of the twentieth century.
