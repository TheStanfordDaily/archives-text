Grant Johannesen, pianist, will present the fourth recital in this
year's ASSU Concert Series in Memorial Auditorium tonight at

The program which Johannesen
will play tonight will consist of "So

One," by Beethoven; "Landler,
Opus 171," by Schubert; "Sonata in
B Minor, Opus 58," by Chopin; four
"Lyric Pieces" by Grieg; and "Gas
pard de la Nuit" by Ravel.
Johannesen was born in Salt Lake
City, Utah, and is of Norwegian
descent. He began to imitate the
piano teacher around the corner be
fore he was five, and, soon after, he
began to take lessons from Mabel
Borg Jenkins. By the time he was
eight, he was composing musical
scores and putting on.theatrical en
tertainments.
Johannesen made his debut in
New York in 1944. Since then lie
lias played in North America,
South America, and Europe. In
addition to solo appearances, he
has played with many orchestras
on these continents, including the
New York Philharmonic, the Bos
ton Symphony, the San Francisco
Symphony, the Conservatoire Or
chestra and the Lamoreux Or
chestra of Paris, the Colon Or
chestra of Buenos Aires, and the
Netherlands Philharmonic.
He has played on the Telephone
Hour, the Standard Hour, and Piano
Playhouse. His recordings for Con
cert Hall Records and Vox Records
include albums of Schumann, Bee
thoven, Schubert, Grieg, and Cho
pin. .
Johannesen is interested in local
color and traditions. In Buenos
Aires at the Colon Theater he was
startled to find at his dressing room
door a figure clad in eighteenth
century style, including a white
powdered wig, who sprayed the cor
ridor with rose water to protect the
artist's throat and informed the
pianist he was due on the stage in
five minutes.
