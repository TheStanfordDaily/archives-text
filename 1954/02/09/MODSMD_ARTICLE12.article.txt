# Mme. Bayar Enjoys Tour
## 
### BOB REZAK 
Madame Reshida Bayar, the
67 - year - old wife of the presi
dent of Turkey, received a warm
Stanford welcome yesterday as
she accompanied her husband
on a fast-paced, abbreviated tour
of the campus.
The warmth of the greetings ex
tended to her came first from the
official Stanford reception commit
tee, from well-wishers who came to
get a glimpse of her, and from a
glowing California sun that beamed
down upon her soft grey hair which
was partially shielded by a small
black velvet hat.
The relatively quiet little wom
an, dressed simply in a neat black
suit, accentuated with a blue scarf
and a corsage of red roses, report
ed her impressions of Stanford
and the Bay Area through her
interpreter, Mrs. V. B. Pars.
Madame Bayar said she "appre
ciated a great deal" the exhibit of
materials from the Hoover Library
collection on Turkey.
"For the last two weeks," she
smiled, "1 haven't seen anything in
Turkish, therefore 1 enjoyed this ex
hibit."
The Turkish leader's wife, her
eyes twinkling under her gold
- framed spectacles, declared that
the exhibit gave her "pride to see
the interest of the people of the
United States in my language and
in my country's history."
Tl"! seemingly tireless lady told
repoiters that she does not choose
to be selective in her interests She
wants to go to all types of programs
and she has "reserved impressions,"
Mrs. Pars added.
Perhaps one of the most memo
rable events in Madame Bayar's
t;ip was a visit yesterday to a vet
erans' hospital in San Francisco,
said Mis. Pars. "She cried a little,
and as we were leaving she said to
me: 'If it were left to us women,
we wouldn't have war.'"
Only once during the neat two
hour official reception-tour wa~
Madame Bavst able to leave the
official party for a well-deserved
rest in the Catalog Room of the
Library. She chatted amiably with
visitors and exchanged her rose
| ♦•orsagc for a corsage of California
daphne which was presented to
l her by Dare Stark McMulliu, re
search sectetarv at Hoover Li
brary,
' How is Madame Bayar able to
keep up at such a fast pace?" some
j one asked Mrs. Pars.
"I don't know,"the interpreter
answered with a sieh "I have to
rur. after her
