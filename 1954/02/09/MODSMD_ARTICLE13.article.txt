# 'I Feel at Home', Says Bayar on Library Tour
## 
### HADLEY ROFF 
Looking somewhat tired when he first arrived on campus late
yesterday afternoon, Celal Bayar, the stubby, balding president
of Turkey, quickly revived in the booklined interior of towering
Hoover Library when he was shown part of the Library's exten
sive Turkish collection.
As he strolled past reading tables laid out with books and manu-

scripts detailing the history of
his country, his round, crinkled
face broke into a wide smile.
And, chatting rapidly with rank
ing Turkish officials accompanying
him on his fast-paced tour of the
United States, he said through in
terpreters, "I feel at home. I feel
at home."
At one point, coming upon a yel
lowed, much-creased newspaper, he
turned to his wife, Madame Bayar,
and excitedly pointed to a dim pic
ture on the front page.
"Do you recognize that pic
ture?" he asked.
And she, with a slight smile,
nodded.
The picture was of a thin, good
looking youth—Bayar back in the
turbulent early 1920's when he
was fighting to destroy the old
Ottoman Empire and establish a
republican government in Tur
key.
Bayar — the man who entered
Turkish politics in 1907 and who
served as prime minister for a while
under Ataturk and who now leads
his country as its third president—
dallied a long time over some of
the displayed books.
"These books bring back so many
memories," he said. "I could lose
myself in here."
After viewing the collection, Ba
yar was taken to the top of Hoover
Tower, then bathed in the pink
after-glow of a fading early spring
day."The view—it's very beauti
ful," he commented to University
President J. E. Wallace Sterling,
who acted as official host.
Back in the lobby of the tamed
library for a reception attended
by about 200 Palo Alto and Uni
versity officials, Bayar listened at
tentively as Dr. C. Easton Roth
well, director of the library,
praised his visit as a "sincere
sign" of goodwill between Tur
key and the United States.
The 70 - year - old chief-of-state
was then presented a black-leather
bound volume commemorating his
visit here by Dr. Sterling.
In accepting the book, Bayar pro
claimed his nation's "determination
to walk with the United States"
through the Cold War
"My country." he said—his eyes
intense behind his thick horn
timmed glasses, his jaw square
and Arm—"feels great pride in
working with the U.S. in its en
deavor to secure peace and pros
perity for the peoples of the
world."
Dressed nattily in a pin-striped
blue suit, Bayar displayed a fond
ness for children when, after being
welcomed by University officials
upon his arrival at the entrance to
Memorial Court, he stopped to
greet several small boys who tim
idly offered their hands.
Bayar—now head of the Turk
ish Democratic party, a rough
equivalent to the GOr in this
country — arrived here at 4:45
amid the blare of poHce sirens and
the ot the cirillou.
