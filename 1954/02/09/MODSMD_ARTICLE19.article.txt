# Tomorrow Is Important
## 
### 
Students of 19 different living groups heard
the concluding talks of the most recent "Stan
ford—Today and Tomorrow" series last night
as 11 administration leaders outlined the poli
cies, plans, and philosophies of Stanford Uni
versity.
We believe that those talks, and the open dis
cussion periods which followed, were of great
value to the student who wjas able to listen and
to participate. Every student at Stanford had
the opportunity to learn something about the
direction of Stanford and the men who are
shaping that direction. Every student who took
advantage of that opportunity by attending the
talk scheduled for his living group now has a
greater understanding of Stanford and its rela
hon to him. And those students are now aware
that their relation to Stanford does not end at
graduation, that it extends to the "tomorrow"

of the University and its graduates.
The "Stanford—Today and Tomorow" com
mittee, headed by Chairman Pete Sabin, de
serves commendation for its work to sustain
and improve the orientation program which
was begun last year. The result of that work
will be shown again and again as the Stanford
student discusses the policies and purposes of
Stanford with authority and understanding.
And although the program was focused into
the" three-wepk period just passed, it has not
ended. At any time of the year, the chairman
of a student group may request, through Sabin,
a talk by an administration leader to his group
of students.
We remind those chairmen of that opportun
ity. We remind all students of the value of
the "Today and Tomorrow" talks and discus
sions.
