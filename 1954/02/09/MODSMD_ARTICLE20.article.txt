# A 						Welcome Calm
## 
### 
After weeks of frantic maneuvering the Sen
ate seems to be enjoying the current respite in
the great Bricker amendment debate.
We're enjoying the cease-fire, too.
We hope it will give the administration, the
Senators, the Friends ol the Bricker amend
ment, the Opponents of the Bricker amendment
and everyone else, too —a chance to sit back
and look quietly at the issues behind the vast
confusion of plans, counter-plans, and compro
mise plans that snowballed into the newspa
pers last week.
Right now debate is centering on a provision
that executive agreements become effective as
internal law only by act of Congress. The
President and his Secretary of State have very
wisely expressed unconditional opposition to
this provision.
We believe that, given the necessary time to
look at the situation calmly, the Senators will
realize that Congress is not the place for de

tailed consideration ol executive agreements.
The very confusion that until last week char
acterized the Bricker amendment debate is
proof that Congress cannot possibly present
the strong front we need for effective negotia
tions with other nations.
For broad policy decisions we need partisan
debate and compromise. For the implementa
tion of these policies we need firmness and
unity. We need to be sure that agreements
made in pursuance of our staled policy will not
have to return to Congress for a second, and
very possibly, contradictory Verdict.
These propositions seem so self-evident to
us that we're sure they will in time seem
equally self-evident to most Congressmen. We
feel sure that the decision made in the present
atmosphere of relative calm will be a wise one.
And so we are glad that Congress has called
a halt in the middle of a round.
