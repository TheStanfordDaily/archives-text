WHY DAILY PHOTOGRAPHERS THKN (iRF/Y
It all started out. as a relatively easy afternoon. All
1 had to do was to print up a few pictures, run off th.e
engravings, and I was through. Or so they told me.
Symphony that night, so I was in sort of a hurry.
Well, about four my good friend Fnth Tnhnkp ptnrt.c

1o pound the darkroom door
down. Must have pictures of the
Lathrop Car Wash, on the double
of course; need them for the
morning paper. Did she have a
car? No, but she had a ride for
me.
Resigned to my fate, I was
loading the camera on my shoul
der when the fearless team of
Webster and Smith arrived. Had
to have pictures of a field of

asters, had to be taken before the sun sets, r nnching
slightly, I announced my departure lor Lathrop, as-
Miring my compatriots I would return in five v minutes.
Lathrop was, of course, deserted. AH of five girls
in the house, none of them dressed for such activities
a.s washing a car. However, they asked that I be
rated for "just a moment," while they dressed them
selves, in suitable raiment.
They were lovely, really beautiful. They were
wearing jeans, as advertised. BUT. every hair was
in place, every eyelash just so; they could have
slipped info u formal and been all set for a high
time, without even having to pick up a bobby pin.
VVc went outside.
A likely looking car was selected. Did anyone
happen to have a rag? No, but one would be there
in a matter of seconds, Five minutes and three hair

combings later, a bunch of car washing impedimenta
arrived. The girls didn't like it. It was wet. It looked
dirty. Too bad; I took the picture anyway. And not
a single eyelash showed in the final pictures, not
even the hair so you'd notice it. But on to the
asters.
1 returned to the Shack and picked up a car.
Knowing only generally where 1 was going, 1 headed
south of Foothill Road. I sav; no asters; I might
almost know an aster if I saw it, but I searched
diligently.
Finally, I encountered a group of Chinese coolies
toiling in the paddies. A likely source of information,
if I could make myself understood.
"Knowee where I findee asters? You savee?
Calchee pretty (lowers, sniff, sniff?"
"Well, those plants growing in Ihe field down
(here are asters —iust beyond that greenhouse. I'm
afraid they're not in bloom, but they're asters."
Bowing deeply from the waist and backing humbly
away, 1 strolled down and took the least expressive
picture that, appeared in The Daily all last week,
and that is an expansive statement.
So back to the old darkroom. Enter friend Jahnke.
"Would it kill you if we didn't use the Lathrop
picture tomorrow?"
"Yes. What about the asters?"
"Oh, we never planned on that for tomorrow."
And that, my Iriends, is why 1 flinch at the very
thought of an aster. The girls at Lathrop are under
the impression that I'm a vile, nasty, ill-tempered
person with advanced gastritis. Ruth is speaking lo
me again now, and I've apologized to most of the
other people 1 offended.
And thanks to a helpful lellow photog, I made it
to the symphony

loading the camera on my shoul
der when the fearless team of
Webster and Smith arrived. Had
to have pictures of a field of

asters, had to be taken before the sun sets, r nnching
slightly, I announced my departure lor Lathrop, as-
Miring my compatriots I would return in five v minutes.
Lathrop was, of course, deserted. AH of five girls
in the house, none of them dressed for such activities
a.s washing a car. However, they asked that I be
rated for "just a moment," while they dressed them
selves, in suitable raiment.
They were lovely, really beautiful. They were
wearing jeans, as advertised. BUT. every hair was
in place, every eyelash just so; they could have
slipped info u formal and been all set for a high
time, without even having to pick up a bobby pin.
VVc went outside.
A likely looking car was selected. Did anyone
happen to have a rag? No, but one would be there
in a matter of seconds, Five minutes and three hair

combings later, a bunch of car washing impedimenta
arrived. The girls didn't like it. It was wet. It looked
dirty. Too bad; I took the picture anyway. And not
a single eyelash showed in the final pictures, not
even the hair so you'd notice it. But on to the
asters.
1 returned to the Shack and picked up a car.
Knowing only generally where 1 was going, 1 headed
south of Foothill Road. I sav; no asters; I might
almost know an aster if I saw it, but I searched
diligently.
Finally, I encountered a group of Chinese coolies
toiling in the paddies. A likely source of information,
if I could make myself understood.
"Knowee where I findee asters? You savee?
Calchee pretty (lowers, sniff, sniff?"
"Well, those plants growing in Ihe field down
(here are asters —iust beyond that greenhouse. I'm
afraid they're not in bloom, but they're asters."
Bowing deeply from the waist and backing humbly
away, 1 strolled down and took the least expressive
picture that, appeared in The Daily all last week,
and that is an expansive statement.
So back to the old darkroom. Enter friend Jahnke.
"Would it kill you if we didn't use the Lathrop
picture tomorrow?"
"Yes. What about the asters?"
"Oh, we never planned on that for tomorrow."
And that, my Iriends, is why 1 flinch at the very
thought of an aster. The girls at Lathrop are under
the impression that I'm a vile, nasty, ill-tempered
person with advanced gastritis. Ruth is speaking lo
me again now, and I've apologized to most of the
other people 1 offended.
And thanks to a helpful lellow photog, I made it
to the symphony

It all started out. as a relatively easy afternoon. All
1 had to do was to print up a few pictures, run off th.e
engravings, and I was through. Or so they told me.
Symphony that night, so I was in sort of a hurry.
Well, about four my good friend Fnth Tnhnkp ptnrt.c
