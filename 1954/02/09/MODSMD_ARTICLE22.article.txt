SALT LAKE CITY, Feb. 6 (by
mail) — Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel,
president of the Board of Trus
tees. Stanford University, gave
a luncheon address before 135
Utah Stanford alumni at the
Third Annual Stanford Confer
ence held in Salt Lake City to
day.
Dinkelspiel spoke with optimism
and conviction on the topic "Stan
ford is on the move."
Dinkelspiel stated thnt the fact
(hat Stanford was "on the move" is
"self evident." "The president is a
great man. As for the faculty—there
never has been such a loyal group,
never has it been so happy." He
continued with praise for the stu
dent body, saying they were the
"greatest."
"The present group at Stanford is
felt by the administration to be bet
ter rounded, ready to face the
world," he said.
Highlighting the afternoon ses
sions was the lecture given by Dr.
George H. Knoles of the llistor)
Department. He spoke on "What
Lurope Thinks of the United

States," saying "the majority of
West Europeans side with us in
the cold war but they have a basic
uneasiness about whether Amer
ica possesses the qualities of
world leadership."
Knoles added that "Europeans
fear that the United States will lose
neither time nor opportunity to
Americanize the world." The feel
ing of Britain is expressed as "Brit
ish fear that England is sinking to
a third-class power, and is becom- j
ing an illegitimate 49th state."
Knoles concluded his speech
with the statement "Europe's I'av- j
vorahle opinion of the United
States is vital to the cause of
human freedom today."
Also lecturing from the Stanford
faculty were Frank George Miller,
Mineral Science; C. Easton Roth
well, Director of the Hoover Insti
tute and Library; and Virgil K.
Whitaker, of the English Depart
ment.
Miller, who discussed "More Oil
from the Earth," said the biggest
problem today is "not so much
the location of oil sources hut how
to get it out economically when
you do lind it." He said that "one
fourth of the world's oil is to Im»
found in the United States and
about half of the oil %ve have riis» >

covered has been left in the earth
because it can't be recovered eco
nomically."
The Hoover Library speaks on be
half not. only of scholarly under
standing but public understanding
of vital problems of the modern
world," Rothwell declared in his
presentation of "If the Hoover Tow
er Could Sp?ak."
Whitaker presented"The World
as Shakespeare Saw It." This
world, he said, was one where
"life was violent and intellectually
exciting." Whitaker went on to
say "the international scene of
Shakespeare's time was exactly
like ours, only darker. England
was alone in a hostile world and
the issues were the same as to
day's."
Concluding the conference a "fam
ily hour" consisting of a question
and answer period was moderated
by Dr. Knoles. Participating on this
panel were: Russel V. Lee, presi
dent, Stanford Alumni Association;
Jack W. Shoup, director, Stanford
Alumni Association; E. Howard
Brooks, Assistant Director of Ad
missions; Dinkelspiel, Miller, Roth
well, and Whitaker.
Dr. was on hand all day

the cold war but they have a basic
uneasiness about whether Amer
ica possesses the qualities of
world leadership."
Knoles added that "Europeans

neither time nor opportunity to
Americanize the world." The feel

found in the United States and
about half of the oil %ve have riis» >

covered has been left in the earth

as Shakespeare Saw It." This
world, he said, was one where
"life was violent and intellectually
exciting." Whitaker went on to
say "the international scene of
Shakespeare's time was exactly
like ours, only darker. England
was alone in a hostile world and
the issues were the same as to
day's."
