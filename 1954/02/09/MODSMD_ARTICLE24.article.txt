# Palo Alto Hoard Bans Three Movies
## 
### 
The Palo Alto Advisory Board on
Commercial Amusements has "re
quested" that three recent movie
releases not be shown in Palo Alto
until the films have been previewed
by the Board.
Board chairman Mrs. Lloyd Horn
by stressed that the request did
"not have the force of a life or
death ban," but that it was usually
followed by the movie house oper
ators.
The three pictures that were
placed in the "dubious" classifi
cation were the Lew Ayres thrill
er, "Donovan's Brain," "Man Cra
zy," and the latest Jane Russell
release, "French Line."
Mrs. Hornby stated that, the Board
was primarily interested in protect
ing the youth of the community,
and was "not trying to tell the
adults what they cannot see."
"We're primarily interested in
keeping the Mickey Spillane - type
material out," she said.
Action on a picture, which is
is routine on all films issued hy
any company, is made on the basis
of opinions in Hi independent
movie reviews. Agencies included
are the American Association of
University Women, Ihe Catholic
Legion of Decency, the Council of
Christians and Jews, and boards
maintained by (he film industry.
The Board may reverse its deci
sion after a special preview, if they
decide that a mistake has been
made.
