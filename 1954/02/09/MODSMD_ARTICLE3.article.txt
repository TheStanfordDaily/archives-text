One of Johannesen's more suc
cessful efforts was the Chopin B
minor Sonata, which received a
thoughtful and clearly delineated
performance. The reserve and lack
of the usual excesses which charac
terize Chopin performances can only
he admired. A bit of messy playing
in the last movement was the only
mar on Johannesen's performance.
The four Lyric Pieces by Greig
are also particularly suited to Jo
hannesen's talents. Especially effec
tive, in spite of an amazingly noisy
audience, was the songful Arietta.

a technician in the Puck, as well as

curacy encountered in the Chopin

beautifully played and called up all
the imagery which the composer
poured into this score.
