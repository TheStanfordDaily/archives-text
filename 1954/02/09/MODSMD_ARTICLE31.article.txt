## The 						Inside Pitch 
### 
For The Daily's series on "meet your coaches" we were given the much
welcomed assignment of writing the story on one of Stanford's most color
ful, but least known coaches, Billy Alhouse. Billy is Everett Dean's right
hand man on the baseball diamond.
The assignment necessitated an interview and getting an appointment
took a lot of doing. It seems Billy is such a valuable asset of Floyd Lowe,
Palo Alto realtor, that he is swamped with work from the moment he gets
to the office at 8 until he leaves at 3. But his day isn't over then because
he works with the baseball team from 3 until 6 before scurrying home to
cater to the wishes of his wife and 16-month old daughter.
When we contacted Billy he was very interested and went out of his
way to get us an interview. The only time he had available was his lunch

hour, so he took us out to lunch.
He rambled over his background
recalling many of the funny things
that he saw and took part in when
he played minor league baseball for
five years.
We were kept in a state of con
stant laughter. One story in par
ticular struck oui fancy. It was
about a big strapping boy from
North Carolina named Leo Muscle
shoulds. He was a Kiner, Williams,
and Mize all in one and had been
lambasting minor league pitching
for a 360 average.
But recently, as Billy related, he
had gone into a slump, going to bat
21 times without a hit. lit* had be
come hard to live with.
Then one afternoon w illl "the
Mighty Muscles" still in the slump,
it happened. The lead-oil hatter
doubled. Muscles came out of the

dug-out swinging :i couple of hats into Che on-rieck circle. The butter
laced a single into centerfiehl, lull (lie agile outfielder scooped il up
arid fiied a perfect strike to the pliite.
The runner from, second was a sure mil that is would have been a j
Mire out il MusHesholds hadn't sprung into action. TJie huge Southerner
ran into the battel '; box and slummed the outfielder'.*; throw over the j
i ight lield fence.
The crowd w:e. roaring and Muscles accepted their accolade as he trot
ted around the banes Needle**; -to say the hip guy was chased lrom the
game.
In the locket room Billy recalls Muscle;, telling him, "That, was the best i
hit I've gotten in three weeks, and they go and take il away from me."
I * ❖ ❖
I noticed in a sports column of a Bay Area paper some talk that
Notre Dame is looking for another Pacific Coast football foe in addition to !
USC. The column said that Stanford might be interested because il would
solve the athletic departments budget problems.
But it was also pointed out that Stanford didn't have the personnel to
match Notie Dame's rostei and that a game would be like "leading lambs
to slaughter. ' In fact, they aid, the only thing the schools have in common i
is young coaches
Well, we did a little back checking and discovered that Stanford and
Notre Dame have met on the gridiron twice. Stanford never won. The
Indians lost in 1942, 27-0, and they dropped their first meeting, a 1925
Rose Bowl clash, 27-10. That was one of the many.years when Notre Dame
was the top team in the country.
The first Stanford-Irish meeting brought, together two of the greatest
coaches of all time Knute Rockne and Pop Warner. It brought together
some footballers with great know-how the Four Horsemen (Elmer Lay
den, "Sleepy Jim" Crowley, Creighton Miller, and Harry Stuhldreher), the
Cards' All-Americans Jim Lawson, Ted Shipkey, and Ernie Nevers. It
produced a great game.
Although the Indians made more first downs, the Irish capitalized on
the breaks, and game star Laymen scored three TDs, going Bf> and (50 yards
to score on interceptions of Nevers' passes.
Hut, (putting from a Chicago Tribune write-up of the game, "Stan
lord surprised with its forward passing attack." (Interesting to note how
tfiings haven't changed in 2K years.)
"This style of offense, combined with a terrific fine-plunging attack
in which Nevers simply drove through (he Noire Dame line, made the
team dangerous at all times."
With the exception of the two passes which Layden picked off, the Card
passing attack (relatively a new gimmick to Western football) worked
well and accounted for a Nevers-Shipkey score.
Hut even then it seems that Stanford couldn't match Notre Dame on an
over-all personnel basis as the Indians employed 12 men, while Notre
Dame relied on 24.
This week end's series with USC should be a dilly if the games at Los
Angeles five weeks ago are any indication. In that pair Stanford gained its
only league victory to date, a (51-59 decision, but dropped the following
night's game, 71-09. USC will bring a .'i-Ii conference record into the
Pavilion and a 10-10 over-all mark. Both clubs are equal, despite the fact
that the Trojans dropped Cal over the week end. Stanford, had it hit
more than It! per cent of its shots in the second hall against Cal, would
have also gained a split in the series.
* * *
OUT ON TIIK t.IMH Dl'.l'T. Mark these predictions (which have proven
ftf) per cent accurate one per cent of the lime) for future reference.
Ron Tomsic will play in Stanford's last two games of the year against
California Feb. 20 and 27.
The baseball team's opening game Feb. 27 on the Sunken Diamond
against the Alumni will he one of (he lop attractions of the season as
the Alums will he loaded with talent.
UCLA will sweep its week end series with Cal and go on to win the i

Notre Dame is looking for another Pacific Coast football foe in addition to !
USC. The column said that Stanford might be interested because il would
solve the athletic departments budget problems.
But it was also pointed out that Stanford didn't have the personnel to
match Notie Dame's rostei and that a game would be like "leading lambs
to slaughter. ' In fact, they aid, the only thing the schools have in common i
is young coaches
Well, we did a little back checking and discovered that Stanford and
Notre Dame have met on the gridiron twice. Stanford never won. The
Indians lost in 1942, 27-0, and they dropped their first meeting, a 1925
Rose Bowl clash, 27-10. That was one of the many.years when Notre Dame
was the top team in the country.
The first Stanford-Irish meeting brought, together two of the greatest
coaches of all time Knute Rockne and Pop Warner. It brought together
some footballers with great know-how the Four Horsemen (Elmer Lay
den, "Sleepy Jim" Crowley, Creighton Miller, and Harry Stuhldreher), the
Cards' All-Americans Jim Lawson, Ted Shipkey, and Ernie Nevers. It
produced a great game.
Although the Indians made more first downs, the Irish capitalized on
the breaks, and game star Laymen scored three TDs, going Bf> and (50 yards
to score on interceptions of Nevers' passes.
Hut, (putting from a Chicago Tribune write-up of the game, "Stan
lord surprised with its forward passing attack." (Interesting to note how
tfiings haven't changed in 2K years.)
"This style of offense, combined with a terrific fine-plunging attack
in which Nevers simply drove through (he Noire Dame line, made the
team dangerous at all times."
With the exception of the two passes which Layden picked off, the Card
passing attack (relatively a new gimmick to Western football) worked
well and accounted for a Nevers-Shipkey score.
Hut even then it seems that Stanford couldn't match Notre Dame on an
over-all personnel basis as the Indians employed 12 men, while Notre
Dame relied on 24.
This week end's series with USC should be a dilly if the games at Los
Angeles five weeks ago are any indication. In that pair Stanford gained its
only league victory to date, a (51-59 decision, but dropped the following
night's game, 71-09. USC will bring a .'i-Ii conference record into the
Pavilion and a 10-10 over-all mark. Both clubs are equal, despite the fact
that the Trojans dropped Cal over the week end. Stanford, had it hit
more than It! per cent of its shots in the second hall against Cal, would
have also gained a split in the series.

For The Daily's series on "meet your coaches" we were given the much
welcomed assignment of writing the story on one of Stanford's most color
ful, but least known coaches, Billy Alhouse. Billy is Everett Dean's right
hand man on the baseball diamond.
The assignment necessitated an interview and getting an appointment
took a lot of doing. It seems Billy is such a valuable asset of Floyd Lowe,
Palo Alto realtor, that he is swamped with work from the moment he gets
to the office at 8 until he leaves at 3. But his day isn't over then because
he works with the baseball team from 3 until 6 before scurrying home to
cater to the wishes of his wife and 16-month old daughter.
When we contacted Billy he was very interested and went out of his
way to get us an interview. The only time he had available was his lunch

hour, so he took us out to lunch.
He rambled over his background
recalling many of the funny things
that he saw and took part in when
he played minor league baseball for
five years.
We were kept in a state of con
stant laughter. One story in par
ticular struck oui fancy. It was
about a big strapping boy from
North Carolina named Leo Muscle
shoulds. He was a Kiner, Williams,
and Mize all in one and had been
lambasting minor league pitching
for a 360 average.
But recently, as Billy related, he
had gone into a slump, going to bat
21 times without a hit. lit* had be
come hard to live with.
Then one afternoon w illl "the
Mighty Muscles" still in the slump,
it happened. The lead-oil hatter
doubled. Muscles came out of the

dug-out swinging :i couple of hats into Che on-rieck circle. The butter
laced a single into centerfiehl, lull (lie agile outfielder scooped il up
arid fiied a perfect strike to the pliite.
The runner from, second was a sure mil that is would have been a j
Mire out il MusHesholds hadn't sprung into action. TJie huge Southerner
ran into the battel '; box and slummed the outfielder'.*; throw over the j
i ight lield fence.
The crowd w:e. roaring and Muscles accepted their accolade as he trot
ted around the banes Needle**; -to say the hip guy was chased lrom the
game.
In the locket room Billy recalls Muscle;, telling him, "That, was the best i
hit I've gotten in three weeks, and they go and take il away from me."

For The Daily's series on "meet your coaches" we were given the much
welcomed assignment of writing the story on one of Stanford's most color
ful, but least known coaches, Billy Alhouse. Billy is Everett Dean's right
hand man on the baseball diamond.
The assignment necessitated an interview and getting an appointment
took a lot of doing. It seems Billy is such a valuable asset of Floyd Lowe,
Palo Alto realtor, that he is swamped with work from the moment he gets
to the office at 8 until he leaves at 3. But his day isn't over then because
he works with the baseball team from 3 until 6 before scurrying home to
cater to the wishes of his wife and 16-month old daughter.
When we contacted Billy he was very interested and went out of his
way to get us an interview. The only time he had available was his lunch

hour, so he took us out to lunch.
He rambled over his background
recalling many of the funny things
that he saw and took part in when
he played minor league baseball for
five years.
We were kept in a state of con
stant laughter. One story in par
ticular struck oui fancy. It was
about a big strapping boy from
North Carolina named Leo Muscle
shoulds. He was a Kiner, Williams,
and Mize all in one and had been
lambasting minor league pitching
for a 360 average.
But recently, as Billy related, he
had gone into a slump, going to bat
21 times without a hit. lit* had be
come hard to live with.
Then one afternoon w illl "the
Mighty Muscles" still in the slump,
it happened. The lead-oil hatter
doubled. Muscles came out of the

dug-out swinging :i couple of hats into Che on-rieck circle. The butter
laced a single into centerfiehl, lull (lie agile outfielder scooped il up
arid fiied a perfect strike to the pliite.
The runner from, second was a sure mil that is would have been a j
Mire out il MusHesholds hadn't sprung into action. TJie huge Southerner
ran into the battel '; box and slummed the outfielder'.*; throw over the j
i ight lield fence.
The crowd w:e. roaring and Muscles accepted their accolade as he trot
ted around the banes Needle**; -to say the hip guy was chased lrom the
game.
In the locket room Billy recalls Muscle;, telling him, "That, was the best i
hit I've gotten in three weeks, and they go and take il away from me."

I noticed in a sports column of a Bay Area paper some talk that
Notre Dame is looking for another Pacific Coast football foe in addition to !
USC. The column said that Stanford might be interested because il would
solve the athletic departments budget problems.
But it was also pointed out that Stanford didn't have the personnel to
match Notie Dame's rostei and that a game would be like "leading lambs
to slaughter. ' In fact, they aid, the only thing the schools have in common i
is young coaches
Well, we did a little back checking and discovered that Stanford and
Notre Dame have met on the gridiron twice. Stanford never won. The
Indians lost in 1942, 27-0, and they dropped their first meeting, a 1925
Rose Bowl clash, 27-10. That was one of the many.years when Notre Dame
was the top team in the country.
The first Stanford-Irish meeting brought, together two of the greatest
coaches of all time Knute Rockne and Pop Warner. It brought together
some footballers with great know-how the Four Horsemen (Elmer Lay
den, "Sleepy Jim" Crowley, Creighton Miller, and Harry Stuhldreher), the
Cards' All-Americans Jim Lawson, Ted Shipkey, and Ernie Nevers. It
produced a great game.
Although the Indians made more first downs, the Irish capitalized on
the breaks, and game star Laymen scored three TDs, going Bf> and (50 yards
to score on interceptions of Nevers' passes.
Hut, (putting from a Chicago Tribune write-up of the game, "Stan
lord surprised with its forward passing attack." (Interesting to note how
tfiings haven't changed in 2K years.)
"This style of offense, combined with a terrific fine-plunging attack
in which Nevers simply drove through (he Noire Dame line, made the
team dangerous at all times."
With the exception of the two passes which Layden picked off, the Card
passing attack (relatively a new gimmick to Western football) worked
well and accounted for a Nevers-Shipkey score.
Hut even then it seems that Stanford couldn't match Notre Dame on an
over-all personnel basis as the Indians employed 12 men, while Notre
Dame relied on 24.
This week end's series with USC should be a dilly if the games at Los
Angeles five weeks ago are any indication. In that pair Stanford gained its
only league victory to date, a (51-59 decision, but dropped the following
night's game, 71-09. USC will bring a .'i-Ii conference record into the
Pavilion and a 10-10 over-all mark. Both clubs are equal, despite the fact
that the Trojans dropped Cal over the week end. Stanford, had it hit
more than It! per cent of its shots in the second hall against Cal, would
have also gained a split in the series.
