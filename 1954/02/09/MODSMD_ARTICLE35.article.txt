### 
(Ed note: The following story
about the exploits of Ed Tucker,
former Stanford cage star, and
the Fort Lewis basketball team
was supplied to The Daily by the
Fort Lewis Public Information
Office, Tucker, the first Negro
athlete on the Farm, played for
Stanford from 1950 through 1952.
(Standing seventh among the
all-time Stanford scorers with 791
points, Tucker coached the Indian
junior varsity team last season
until he was drafted in January,
1953.)
FORT LEWIS, Wash., Feb. 7
Private Sebron (Ed) Tucker, former
Stanford University basketball star
who made All - Pacific Coast and
All-American honorable mention in
1951-52, is now a member of the
Fort Lewis Four - by - Fours cage
team.
The Army has deprived Tucker of
none of his court sharpness. He is
still the fast-running, dead-shoot
ing, seemingly tireless performer.
He still makes basketball look like
an easy sport with his "picture
plays."
His coach, Sergeant Chuck
Byrd, calls Tucker "the best of
fensive forward I've ever laid eyes
on—a regular scoring machine."
Statistics lor the Four by-Fours'
first 18 games this season (all vic
tories) show that Tucker has been
up to his oh I scoring t ricks He has
gathered 485 points on 210 lield
goals and (55 free throws. His big
gest splurge came just last Thurs
day, when he netted 65 points.
This crew has averaged 91.5
points per game thus far this year,
while its opponents, as a whole,
carry a 60.1 average.
Tucker, now a 22-year-old, 6-foot,
180-pounder, is a member of Head
quarters Company, 44th Infantry
Division, and employs a one-hand
push shot as his greatest, offensive
weapon. He scores consistently on
it from all areas ol the court, run
ning or set.
And when he goes in for a lay
up shot, the hall goes through the
hoop—every time. "He has the
secret of scoring on lay-ups," said
Byrd. "lie keeps possession of the
hall until he reaches the peak of
his leap. He releases the hall at
the height of his jumu. That's why
he doesn't miss them."
Tucker's sports background wends
its way back to l!)4(i. when he pulled
on his first basketball jersey for
Booker T. Washington High in Has
kell, Oklahoma. Although he also
participated in baseball and foot
ball, he drew most praise on the
maple court and was named to the
Oklahoma All-State prep team in
1948.
After the Tuckers moved to Cali

fornia, Ed led Compton Junior Col
lege into the national tourney at,
Kansas City, and although Comp
ton didn't win the title, Tucker was
selected as the most outstanding
man in the tourney. He was also
named to the Junior College All-
American team in 1949.
Ed's achievements at Stanford
were many.
lie scored 270 points in the
1951-52 season, leading the South
ern Division of the Pacific Coast
Conference. In 1951, against
Southern California, he scored 36
points to break the all -lime Stan
ford Pavilion scoring record of
famed Hank Luisetti by Iwo
points.
He was named to the All-Pacific
Coast Conference team in 1951 and
was given honorable mention on a
host of All-American teams includ
ing Associated Press and Collier's
Magazine.
Tucker's most exciting moment in

basketball came when he was re
sponsible for breaking UCLA's six
year Liome victory string. UCLA
was a point ahead when it elected
to take the ball out of bounds after
a Stanford foul. Only 45 seconds re
mained in the contest.
As the hall was thrown into
play, Tucker made a wild stab for
it. He came up with (be ball, sped
down court, and sank a lay-up to
put his team in front by (wo
points. He drew a foul while scor
ing (he basket and sank the free
throw to wrap up the game for
Stanford, 74-71, and end (he UC
LA victory skein.
Ever since his graduation from
Stanford, the pros have been hot on
the heels of this bundle of basket
ball talent.
But thus far, Ed has spurned all
play-l'or-pay offers. He wants to
follow in the footsteps of his broth
ers and enter the medical profes
sion.
