house, were driving back to campus
when the car driven by the vandals
forced theirs off the highway be
tween San Carlos and Redwood
C>ty As they left the car. the hood
lums started assaulting them.
All three were injured. They
were: Bob Stetson, who suffered a
broken right arm and a split lip;
Ted Riordan, who suffered a broken
nose; and John Booth, who suffered
severe bruises.
"'We have no idea why this
happened," Stetson said yester
day. "They must hsve just picked
11% to beat up at random â€” they
didn't seem to know any of out
names."
The three were able to get. only a
part of the license number of the
\a::dals tar.
