# 'Best Orator' Bryan Green's Life Varied
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Bryan Green, the renowned
English clergyman who will ad
dress a University Convocation
this Friday, has done everything
from rescuing the stricken in
London air raids to addressing
one of the largest gatherings
ever to assemble in America's
biggest church.
Canon Gieen, described as "the
best orator in the Anglican Church
(Episcopal and Church of Eng
land)," will spend a week at Stan
ford, giving nightly lectures in Mem
Aud on "Basic Cluistianity." He
will also address several church
services and will visit many of the
residences.
Green was born in London in 1901
and was graduated from London
University. He was ordained in
Southwark Cathedral in 1924.
By 1928, his speaking ability was
recognized, and he was sent
throughout Great Britain to give
missions. In 1931, Canon Green, be
cause of his facility with college
students, was appointed chaplain at
Oxford University.
In 1936. Green started a prac
tice for which he has become fa
mous. He made his first visit to
the United States and Canada
to conduct week - long missions.
Since then, he has been to the
United States eight times. He has
also given missions in India, Aus
tralia, the Gold Coast, Nigeria,
South Africa, and Sootland and
North Ireland. His missions are
so popular that he had to be
scheduled two years in advance
to appear at Stanford.
During the war. Green was a
chaplain with, the Signal Corps and
was in London during the blitz. He
spent much of this time doing dan
gerous rescue work.
In 1948, Green was appointed rec
tor of Birmingham, the second lar
gest city in England. His church, St
Martin's-in-the-Bullring, is in the
middle of Birmingham's slums, so
much of his work is with the poor.
Besides his duties as rector of
Birmingham and his speaking en
gagements, the dynamic clergy
man with the noted sense of hu
mor finds time to write regular
articles for England's largest pa
pers, author a hook, and do radio
and television work.
Canon Green appeared briefly at
Stanford four years ago. Despite a
tierce rainstorm, Memorial Church
was filled to capacity, and many
persons had to be turned away.
