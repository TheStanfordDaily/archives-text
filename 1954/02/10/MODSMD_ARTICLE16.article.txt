# Wilson: No U.S. Airmen To be Sent to Indochina

### 
WASHINGTON.. Feb. 9 (UP)—
Defense Secretary Charles E.
Wilson declared emphatically
today that no U.S. pilots will be
sent to Indo-China and said he
sees no reason to think the fight
ing there will erupt into "an
other Korea."
In a generally optimistic survey
of the Indochina war, Wilson told a
news conference it is "both possible
and probable" that French and na
tive forces can score a military vic
tory over thfe Communists without
direct American intervention.
But he added that "success would
be delayed" if Communist China
moved in as it did in Korea. He
said, however, that Red China's
ability to supply troops in Indochina
would be "very limited" because of
poor rail and water transportation.
French Defense Minister Rene
Fleven arrived in Indochina today
as advancing Communist armies
drove within artillery range of Lu
ang Prabang, the ancient capital of
Laos. Pleven was armed with "full
power" to take any steps necessary
to halt the Communist offensive.
"The war in Indochina is going
as well as can be expected at this
st»ige," Wilson said in a statement
to his news conference.
"The outcome of the war in In
dochina is highly important to the
free world, but I see no reason to
think Indochina will be another
Korea."
Wilson noted that 200 U.S. tech
nicians have been sent to Indochina
to service American planes fur
nished the French. But he said the
United States is not sending pilots
and "wc are not sending combat
troops."
He added, however, that Lt Gen.
John W. O'Daniel, U.S. Army com
mander in the Pacific, "might" go to
Indochina. O'Daniel, now here for
a briefing, presumably would head
a new U.S. military advisory mis
sion to help the French map strat
egy.
