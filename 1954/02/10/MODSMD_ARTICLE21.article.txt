# Big Four Slates Second Secret Session in Berlin
## Korea, Indochina Possible Topics Of Closed Conference Tomorrow 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 9 (UP) —The Big Four today unexpectedly sched
uled a secret session on the Far East Thursday, prompting specu
lation that Russia might be ready to bargain on Korea and Indo
chinese peace talks.
Soviet Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov readily agreed to the sec-

ond closed meeting this week. He
said it would be "useful." At first,
the West rejected his proposal for a
five - power conference with Rfd
China, but suggested limited talks
on Korea and possibly Indochian.
The announcement of the secret
meeting followed the 14th session of
the Big Four foreign ministers, at
which:
1. Molotov, in a speech of nearly
two hours, rehashed all his previous
demands on Germany—the issue on
which the conference is deadlocked
so tightly that it has decided to
abandon the subject.
2. The Western ministers one af
ter another told Molotov that if he
had nothing better to contribute,
there was no hope of agreement.
3. Molotov announced he would
introduce tomorrow a formal So
viet proposal for a European se
curity system, expected to ex
clude the United States.
Informed sources said Molotov
did not react when the Western
ministers suggested yesterday that
his proposed five-power conference
be pared down to meetings on spe
cific issues such as Korea and Indo
china.
Western diplomats suggested
later that Molotov might have
checked back to Moscow and pos
sibly Peiping, with the result that
he might be prepared to bargain
after all on limited talks about
Far Eastern problems.
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles, in a five-minute reply to
Molotov, said he had better get
something new to say, since "it will
not advance us very far if we con
tinue at this particular conference
to repeat over and over again what
has already been said.
