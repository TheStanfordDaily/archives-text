# Iranian Expert To Talk Today At Cubberley
## 
### 
Edward A. Bayne, an expert
on Iranian affairs and Middle
Eastern authority for the Ameri
can Universities Field Staff, will
give a talk today at 4:15 in Cub
berley Auditorium. The title of
his talk will be "The Prospects
of Democracy in Iran."
In a Daily interview, Bayne stated
that the comparative lack of activ
ity in Iran at the present time is
merely "a breathing space created
by Iranian leader General Fazlol
lah Zahedi, who is maintaining
peace by naked force."
As long as the army remains loyal
to Zahedi and the country remains

under the control of this strong
force, peace can be kept, he said.
The Iranian expert believes that
during the present time of compara
tive non - tension, the oil dispute
might, be brought to a successful
conclusion. He would not make any
predictions, though, as to the like
lihood of any future settlement of
the oil problem.
Bayne's last Iranian trip was in
11)53 when he observed first-hand
the conditions in that Middle East
ern hot-spot. Prior to 1053 he spent
two six-month periods in Iran dur
ing 1949 and 1950 as a special finan
cial adviser to the prime minister.
On Thursday night, he will
before members of the Hoover In
stitute and Library World Affairs
Discussion Group, and on Tuesday
night will participate in the Tues
day Evening faculty seminar.
Bavne is the third AUFS repre
sentative to speak on the Stanford
campus this year.
