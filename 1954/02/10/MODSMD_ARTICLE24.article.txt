## 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 9 (UP)—East Ger
many's anti - Communist under
ground defied a ruthless police cam
paign today and flooded the Soviet
zone with leaflets demanding free
elections to reunite Germany.
The Communists reacted swiftly
with stern repressive measures.
Jack-booted, goose-stepping police
marched into railway stations and
bus terminals to confiscate what
leaflets they could find and to track
down leaders of the anti-Commu
nist cells.
But the West Berlin "Fighting
Group Against Inhumanity" said
handbills printed on primitive
presses and home - made mimeo
graph machines were distributed in
all the zone's five provinces.
Anti - Communist signs appeared
again on the walls of buildings
alongside the Western foreign min
isters' plan for unity. East German
anger at Soviet Foreign Minister V.
M. Molotov's rejection of the plan
was bringing the East Germans to
the boiling point.
The Communists, apparently
afraid of inflaming the East Ger
mans even more, called off the ral
lies they had planned at which
Communist agitators were to have
praised Molotov's German propos
als.
A few rallies were held, the Neue
Zeitung, East Berlin newspaper,
said, but anti-Communist worker:
shouted down the speakers and d"
manded free elections, the release of
jailed workers, and lifting of the
ban on the Socialist party.
