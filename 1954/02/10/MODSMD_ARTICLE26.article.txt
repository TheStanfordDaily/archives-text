# It's Worth It
## 
### 
Joseph A. McCarthy, Republican Senator
from Wisconsin, is speaking in San Mateo to
night. He needs no further introduction, for
Probably most students have already formed
ili< u opinions about what he is and what fie
stands for.
Ye\ during this past week we have been dis
turbed by comments such as, "Why pay $1 .50
to listen to McCarthy?" or "I'd really like to go,
but he's just not worth the time and money."
We don't agree with Senator McCarthy.
Neither do we agree that our presence at his
Ik is an endorsement of his aims, methods, or
M r ornplishments.
Ifdlher, we believe that tonight oilers us u
i.no opportunity to observe at liist hand the
Hi-/ l controversial figure in the United States
I'-'lciy. McCarthy the "ism," has been debated
"H government levels, over the radio, in dor

mitory bull sessions. McCarthy the Senator
has filled newspapers with issues ranging from
Greek shipowners to investigations at Fort
Monmouth.
Yet McCarthy the man is known by very few.
That is why our interest in his talk tonight is
not expressed in partisan, emotional terms. We
are anxious to see him in person, to hear wliat
he has to say, to observe the reactions ol oth
ers listening to him.
We won't know all there is to know about
McCarthy alter tonight, but we will know him
a little better, and we shall have gained a
deeper understanding of his aims and the sen
timents he so vigorously upholds.
This knowledge and this understanding, we
feel, aie well wcith the lime and the price of
admission
