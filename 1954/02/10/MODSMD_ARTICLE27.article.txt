# Negotiate Now
## 
### 
Let's face facts. Right now the French and
f'l'-ir Indo-Chinese supporters seem unable to
low, let alone reverse, the steady advances ol
Hk- Communist led Vietminh forces.
I lb Chi Minh's Communists already control
much of Viet Nam, and as of yesterday morning
wore within 15 miles of the capital of Laos.
And areas nominally controlled by French
Jllion lorces are teeming with Communists.
Might now our alternatives in Indo-China
: '-mi uniformly unappealing.
■A/e could try to send the French Union forces
'■nough aid so they could defeat the Vietminh.
t.mkly we think such a victory would require
more aid than the United States alone could
- < utribute. And we don't think that the rest of
I!"* free world would support us in such a
policy.
Or we could continue our present policy:
■,i nd the French just enough aid to keep them
in the war, but net enough tor French victory.
This policy seems less purposeful every day.
The French don't like it. They see their men
dying and their budget being drained for the
sake of a territory they can never control again.
Other Asian nations don't like it. They see
''iily that the U.S. is pressing the French to ie
main in a country where the people do not
want them.
'I he Indo-Chinese people don't like it. For
over a decade French, Japanese, and now Corn
munists have been struggling over their land.
I hey want and deserve a respite from this long
battle.
And we don'l like il either. Aside from the
drain on our budget, we're aware that the
French may never support the F.uropean

army until we permit them to withdraw their
troops Irom Indo-China.
The remaining alternative is obvious—nego
tiate a peace and clear out of Indo-China.
Again we have to face facts. In Korea, where
we met the Communists after a battle in which
we had done as well as they, we were unable
to negotiate the kind of peace we wanted. In
Indo-China, after a battle which we have been
losing, we can be sure that Communist peace
terms will be doubly expensive. Chances are
the Communists will hold out for a settlement
which will leave the Vietminh in control of
Indo-China.
And yet, awful as it sounds at first, this last
alternative seems our only hope lor a long
range solution to the Asian problem.
Negotiated peace in Indo-China, whatever
the price, would be far less disastrous than
complete military defeat which now seems :
imminent lor French Union lorces.
Willingness to negotiate a compromise peace
would, quiet third-force fears that the U.S. is
determined to drag the world into anti-Commu
nist warfare, and win us much-needed confi- i
dence all over the world.
Most important ol all, only after we have es
tablished a working truce with Asia's Commu
nists can we begin the constructive policy of
trying to win them away from Russia's domi
nance.
Tor in Asia, as all over the world, our only
hope for the future rests on the assumption that
given experience with the realities of Russian
imperialism Asian Communists will see that
Russian expansionism is a far greater threat to
their independence than our capitalism.
