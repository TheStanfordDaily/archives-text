I have always had the highest respect for ihe honor
• I Stanford students and, up until the other day, 1
v innocent enough to think that people on this
- nmpus could be trusted. A few days aj>o it was
v.irmer than usual and so I left my Stanford jacket
itli my books on one of the racks in the library
lobby and went to the Cellar for lunch. When 1
' a me back 50 minutes later my jacket was gonp.

That was the first time T ever left, my jacket with
my books, and I don't think it speaks too well for
the respect of personal property at Stanford. Stan
ford is not the kind of school at which students can't
afford their own clothes, and I thought it was even
less the kind of school at which people steal from
others what they don't want to pay for themselves.
1 guess maybe 1 was wrong.
