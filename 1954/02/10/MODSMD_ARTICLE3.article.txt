### RUSS WILKS 
Dr. Ira L. Wiggins entertained
a large audience with movies
of Arctic life la.st night at the
Tuesday Evening Senes Al
though his lecture was "Eskimo
Whalers at Poiid Barrow, Alas
ka." Di Wiggins presented a
cross-section ol Eskimo activi
ties '
The movies, in color and black
and white, caught the dramatic and
lighter moments in the lives of the
600 Point Barrow Eskimos Most of
these were lighter moments too, for,
as Dr. Wiggins said. "Eskimos are
cheerful people and are always
laughing. Sometimes you think
they are heartless when they laugh

at tiagedy, but. they explain that
they know things are bad enough
and don't want to make them any
worse with signs of sorrow "
Di Wiggins, Stanford botanist
who has been on the faculty for 25
years, did emphasize teh whaling
season.
He described the whale hunt
while flic audience viewed the
scene. The whale which whs killed
was described as a "small one,"
being only 32 feet long and weigh
ing a mere 30 tons.
The Eskimos kill the whale with
a bomb which is shot from a gun.
The bomb, which is effective two
out of three times, is marked so
that ownership can be determined
when the bomb is recovered from
the whale.
A boat brings the whale to the
ice's edge, and hauling the mam
moth creature out of water usually
takes two hours. The task is similar
to a tug of war, whale vs. Eskimos.
Mucktuck, the outer skin of the
whale, is one of (lie tare delicacies
which the workers derive. Every
body who help*> butcher the whale
gets a share of the meat and blub
ber, said Dr. Wiggins.
This year the Point Barrow Eski
mos landed 19 whales for one of
their most productive seasons in
years, did emphasize he whaling
any.
The Eskimos are very much a part
of modern civilization as Miey have
foregone kayak- fei motor boats
and enjoy bubble gum and Coca-
Cola (at 45 cents a bottle).
Dr Wiggins, who headed the Arc
tic Research Laboratory at Point
Barrow for three years, touched
UDon the inhabitants'
dances, superstitions, and life in
genera! He found them honest
and cheerful' and easy to work
with.
