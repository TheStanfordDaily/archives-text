# 6,200 Cheer McCarthy Charges Of 'Twenty Years of Treason'
## Senator Delivers Lincoln Day Talk In San Mateo 
### 
SAN MATEO, Feb. 10 — As
Navy pennants fluttered color
fully overhead and a raspy loud
speaker blared out a military
march, Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy
strode into the enormous Fiesta
Building here tonight and for an
hour and a half held most of the
8,200 in the audience spellbound
with his strident charges against
"the treason of the last 20 years."
Referring frequently to the rec
ords of his investigating committees
the controversial political figure at
tempted to lay a case that during the
administrations of Franklin Roose
velt and Harry S. Truman Commu
nists were knowingly coddled in the
Army and in government services.
He told of an Army major who
refused to testify before McCarthy's
committee whether or not he was a
Red.
He told of an employee of the
Government Printing Office who,
though having access to secret
documents and plans, also refused
to testify as to possible Commu
nist party membership when
called before McCarthy's com
mittee.
He told of a member of the Loy
alty Board during the last adminis
tion who testified that the head of
the board had okayed the hiring of
Communists.
And as he recited these charges—
with frequent pounding of his fists
and emphatic arm motions—the au
dience listened avidly and fre
quently burst into prolonged ap
plause.
Several times he interrupted the
recital of a case involving Commu
nists to ask, "Can you hear me?
Can you all hear me?"
And the audience cried back,
"Yes, yes."
Twice he stopped abruptly and
with a swift, blazing glance around
the room arked:
"Do you want me to continue?"
"Yes, yes," was the seemingly un
animous answer, as an explosion of
hand-clapping interrupted.
Holding aloft a stack of official
looking documents all marked with
red and blue ink, with yellow mark
ers protruding abundantly from
each, he fairly shouted, "Here is the
evidence of the march of defeat
through victory which saw millions
turned into slaves. . . .
"Here is the evidence . . he
repeated in his characteristic rhet
oric.
Evidence collected by his commit
tee, the Wisconsite charged, has
demonstrated:
1) "That there is an army order
that Communists could and should
be commissioned in the army of
this country."
2) "That there is an army order
destroying the files on alleged com
munism."
Midway through his torrid ad
dress he peeled off the blue double
breasted coat of his suit, and with a
polite bow said. "I'm sure the ladies
will forgive me."
After reciting from the record of
his investigations he dwelled on the
plight of American soldiers held
prisoner by Reds in Korea.
"What happened to the 900 sol
diers held captive and never ac
counted for by the Chinese?" he
demanded.
"What happened to the 32
American airmen who the Chinese
claim were not to be treated as
prisoners of war because they
were caught behind the Manchur
ian border?"
Raising his right arm high, his
hand drawn into a fist, he declared,
"There was a time when no nation
on earth would dare do this to us.
"What's happened to our honor?"
"What can we do about it?"
His solution was to cut off aid to
allies—"alleged allies"—who insist
on trading with Red China.
"We're having an election soon,"
he reminded his intense audience.
"Here's one time when your voice
will be heard.
"Ask every candidate," McCarthy
urged, "the simple question—if we
send you to Washington, if we give
you the all-important job of man
ning the watchtowers of the nation,
will you take money out of our pock
ets and send it to allies who in turn
give it to our enemy who uses it to
build up his sinews of power?"
"We must do a job that shall be
i done — even though the sands of
. time are running out—that job is
i recreating a peaceful world in which
Communism will be no more," he
ended.
The hall was silent for a breath
less moment. Then the thunder
claps of applause burst forth ir.d

questions which were fired at him yesterday in a press conference held at the San Francisco In

SAN MATEO, Feb. 10 — As
Navy pennants fluttered color
fully overhead and a raspy loud
speaker blared out a military
march, Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy
strode into the enormous Fiesta
Building here tonight and for an
hour and a half held most of the
8,200 in the audience spellbound
with his strident charges against
"the treason of the last 20 years."
Referring frequently to the rec
ords of his investigating committees
the controversial political figure at
tempted to lay a case that during the
administrations of Franklin Roose
velt and Harry S. Truman Commu
nists were knowingly coddled in the
Army and in government services.
He told of an Army major who
refused to testify before McCarthy's
committee whether or not he was a
Red.
He told of an employee of the
Government Printing Office who,
though having access to secret
documents and plans, also refused
to testify as to possible Commu
nist party membership when
called before McCarthy's com
mittee.
He told of a member of the Loy
alty Board during the last adminis
tion who testified that the head of
the board had okayed the hiring of
Communists.
And as he recited these charges—
with frequent pounding of his fists
and emphatic arm motions—the au
dience listened avidly and fre
quently burst into prolonged ap
plause.
Several times he interrupted the
recital of a case involving Commu
nists to ask, "Can you hear me?
Can you all hear me?"
And the audience cried back,
"Yes, yes."
Twice he stopped abruptly and
with a swift, blazing glance around
the room arked:
"Do you want me to continue?"
"Yes, yes," was the seemingly un
animous answer, as an explosion of
hand-clapping interrupted.
Holding aloft a stack of official
looking documents all marked with
red and blue ink, with yellow mark
ers protruding abundantly from
each, he fairly shouted, "Here is the
evidence of the march of defeat
through victory which saw millions
turned into slaves. . . .
"Here is the evidence . . he
repeated in his characteristic rhet
oric.
Evidence collected by his commit
tee, the Wisconsite charged, has
demonstrated:
1) "That there is an army order
that Communists could and should
be commissioned in the army of
this country."
2) "That there is an army order
destroying the files on alleged com
munism."
Midway through his torrid ad
dress he peeled off the blue double
breasted coat of his suit, and with a
polite bow said. "I'm sure the ladies
will forgive me."
After reciting from the record of
his investigations he dwelled on the
plight of American soldiers held
prisoner by Reds in Korea.
"What happened to the 900 sol
diers held captive and never ac
counted for by the Chinese?" he
demanded.
"What happened to the 32
American airmen who the Chinese
claim were not to be treated as
prisoners of war because they
were caught behind the Manchur
ian border?"
Raising his right arm high, his
hand drawn into a fist, he declared,
"There was a time when no nation
on earth would dare do this to us.
"What's happened to our honor?"
"What can we do about it?"
His solution was to cut off aid to
allies—"alleged allies"—who insist
on trading with Red China.
"We're having an election soon,"
he reminded his intense audience.
"Here's one time when your voice
will be heard.
"Ask every candidate," McCarthy
urged, "the simple question—if we
send you to Washington, if we give
you the all-important job of man
ning the watchtowers of the nation,
will you take money out of our pock
ets and send it to allies who in turn
give it to our enemy who uses it to
build up his sinews of power?"
"We must do a job that shall be
i done — even though the sands of
. time are running out—that job is
i recreating a peaceful world in which
Communism will be no more," he
ended.
The hall was silent for a breath
less moment. Then the thunder
claps of applause burst forth ir.d
