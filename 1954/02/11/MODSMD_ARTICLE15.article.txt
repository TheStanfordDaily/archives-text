# Senator Willing To Address Political Union

### HADLEY ROFF 
SAN FRANCISCO INTERNA
TIONAL AIRPORT, Feb. 10—A
husky-voiced Sen. Joseph R.
McCarthy (R., Wis.) expressed a
willingness to address the Stan
ford Political Union when he was
approached by two Stanford stu
dents as he concluded a press
conference, shortly after his ar
rival here at this sweeping,
wind-swept terminal late this
afternoon.
The two students, Linda Wells
and Mike Hudson, both officers in
the Political Union, said the Sena
tor agreed "in principle" to speak on
the Stanford campus and asked them
to contact his Washington office to
arrange a specific date.
At the press conference, Mc-
Carthy, complaining frequently of
a "weak throat," said at the pres
ent time "there is far too much
Communist infiltration in Ameri
can colleges."
"One Communist professor," he
said, his heavy brow knitting in a
deep frown, "can do more damage
than a spy in an atom bomb plant."
Asked what the American youth
should do to combat Communism,
he answered that one of the most
important tasks that the American
people can do is to get rid of Com
munist teachers and professors.
Emphasizing with a short wag
of a stubby forefinger that he was
not saying that a majority of the
nation's professors were Commu
nists, he did assert that the work
of one or two Red profs in a school
"could not be undone by the rest
of the faculty no matter haw lai-ge
it may be." "As an example," he
snapped, "take once great Har
vard."
The junior Senator from Wiscon
sin said that he did not know the
exact number of Communists who
might be operating from within the
nation's campuses, but charged that
there were a large number of ac
tively teaching "Fifth Amendment
Communists." Presumably he meant
by that, educators who had sought
immunity under the Fifth Amend
ment to the Constitution.
"These Fifth Amendment Commu
nists," he added, "are dangerous be
yond words."
Though indicating several times
during the conference — held in a
small anteroom of the large Pan-
American Airways building here—
that he would purge all Communists
from the schools, the Senator said
that he was not in favor of wiping
out differences of opinion.
"A Communist teacher," he de
clared, "is under direct orders from
Moscow and is unable therefore io
act with a free conscience."
Discussing more general political
concerns, he said that he and his
party have a "duty to expose all the
details of 20 years of treason—and
I use that term advisedly," that he
alleges occurred during the Roose
velt and Truman administrations.
"I intend to continue to give the
American people all the facts about
the Communist coddling, as in the
case of Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter
White, tha went on under the Tru
man-Acheson leadership," he stated
with an emphatic nod.
McCarthy said he felt that the
vast majority of Democrats were
patriotic, but indicated that the
leadership of that party had acted
disloyally.
