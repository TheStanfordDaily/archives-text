# Needed: A Report
## 
### 
Senator McCarthy's visit to town reminds us
that for some time we have wanted to second
the Washington newsmen in-their efforts to get
a complete report from the administration on
its security firings.
Since last May the Republican administra
tion has fired 2,200 government employees as
"security risks." McCarthy implies that most of
these employees are Communists or "Com
munist thinkers." The Democrats say many are
loyal citizens, whose services are «>t value to
the government.
Washington newsmen have tiied to dig
ihrough to the bottom ol the confusion by tie
manding answers lor a tew obvious questions:
Who was fired? ,I'or what reasons? I low
many discharged "security lisks" were sns
peeled of disloyalty or Communism, and how
many were charged with personal unfitness
such as alcoholism, sexual perversion, oi»crim

inal behavior?
So far the newsmen have received a frus
trating run-around. Attorney General Brownell
referred them back to the Civil Service Com
mission which referred Ihem back to the Justice
Department again. And still they had no an
swers lor their questions.
II we're to look at the emotionally-loaded is
sue of Communists in government rationally,
we need facts on which to base our opinions.
We must know why the Republicans fired 2,200
government employees as "security lisks" be
lore we can properly evaluate Senator Mc-
Carthy's charges.
II President Eisenhower is as deter ruined as
he claims he is to remove Communism iri gov
ornment as an issue from the 1954 election, he
must begin by giving us the facts about his
house-cleaning.
