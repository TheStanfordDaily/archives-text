# An Unending Need
## 
### 
The need for whole blood i.s not one which
lasts only during a period of war, a period
when casualty lists, national pride, and a con
cern for "our fighting boys" justify bold black
headlines and dramatic publicity campaigns.
The need is one v/hich is continuous and
unending. It exists as long as the human body
stands frail against disease and the ravages o(
nalureand the inevitable disasters of a machine
age. It exists as long as there an persons alive
who are unable to pay the costs for the blood
they need to stay alive.
And because the need exists, Stanford will

again participate in a campus drive for the col
lection of whole blood. As a prerequisite to
that drive, scheduled for Feb. 25 26, parental
permission slips for students'under 21 are being
distributed on campus. Those slips must be
filled out and signed by it minor's parent before
blood can be donated.
We urge all students (and the staff) to con
sider the continuous need for blood and pledge
themselves to a donation in the coming drive.
We urge them to remember that the boldness
of headlines and the exuberance of publicity is
not the only criterion lor judging and acting on
a need.
