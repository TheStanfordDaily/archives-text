# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
If, was a cold, rainy day in the fall of 1950, and a
friend and I had a free hour thai we didn't know
what to do with. I had read in The Daily that an
English clergyman named Bryan Green, who had
been packing in immense crowds in San Francisco's
Grace Cathedral, was going to • " 1 ; n

Cubberley.
Having nothing better to do, I
went to Cubberley, dragging
along my very reluctant friend
whose atheism was abundant and
outspoken. My friend grumbled
all the way to Cubberley that
this was the last time that any
one was going to talk him into
hearing any minister.
At the end of the address, 1
asked my friend what he thought

of Bryan Green. He was silent, for about 10 seconds,
and then he said calmly, "lie's I lie best speaker I
i ver heard. I didn't necessarily agree with him on
every point, but he made me think like no one else
ever has before."
That was on Thursday. On Sunday, he was
scheduled to give the sermon in Memorial Church.
That Sunday it rained more fiercely than I have
ever seen it at Stanford. An unceasing drluge is
usually a perfect rationalization for people to stay
away from church. Nevertheless, the Church was
filled to capacity that morning, and hordes had to
he turned away.
When Bryan Green gave a week-long Mission in
New York several years ago, he drew 40.000 persons
i.i a week. On the final night, 9.000 packed into the
.VOOO capacity Cathedral to hear him.
Cancn Green, described as "the be-1 orator in ihe
Anglican (Church of England and Kpiscopal)" has a
fantastic drawing power. The above testifies lo that
But why? What, is his secret?
He has the talent, to speak lo an audience of 2 000
and yet make each individual feel lhat he is the
only one in the audience. He has Ihe drawing power
of Billy Graham, and yet uses none of Graham's
wild methods. Bryan Green has th< exquisite Kng
lish sense of humor of an Alec Guinness comedy, of
which he makes considerable use.
His speaking style is dynamic, yet he uses the
rationality of the mosl scholarly prof* sor He is

loath to quote loflily from the Bible, saying, "You
don't show people the validity of Christian living
by quoting scriptures to them."
One of ('anon Green's distinguishing character
istics is that he is crazily, wonderfully unorthodox.
He requested that he be able to meet with women
in their residence, between 10:.% and 11:110 p.m. Says
Green, "I've hied this system al other universities,
and il works perfectly. The gills leave their boy
friends at 10:30; then a strange Englishman walks
in, and they are so aghast that they have to listen to
what he's saying,"
When 1 was in England, Canon "Green invited me
to spend a few days with him and his family. One
day he took me out to a town called Uudly where he
was supposed to address a Methodist's Sunday After
noon group.It was a big occasion for the group, which
was celebrating its 25111 anniversary, and the hall
was packed.
Most speakers would begin by saying, "It's an
honor for rne <o he here Unlay," or some such
euphemism. But not I lie unorthodox Reverend
Green. lie began:
"First of all, let me say that I thoroughly abom
inate Sunday afternoon meetings. II seems to me
that every good Fnglishman should be taking Ins
Sunday afternoon- nap at this time, not going to a
stuffy church meeting."
Most speakers couldn't have gotten away with such
a statement, but he said it in such tone and with
such a twinkle in his eye that the assemblage roared.
It doesn't make any difference if you are of the
Protestant belief, the Catholic belief, the Jewish
belief. Or, indeed, of no belief at all. Green's talk will
cut party lines, so to speak. As he says in character
istic style, "I don't want to talk to solely Christian
congregations all the time. It's no fun il everyone
sits around agreeing with each other.''
I am tempted to say, "Hear Bryan Green at the
Convocation and at each one of In lectures." But.
I don't have to. II you hear him al the Convocation,
I feel confident that you will want to hear him at
every other opportunity.
Tomorrojv at 11 a m Bryan Green will speak to
the student body. He will be unorthodox; he will be
funny; he v/ill be scholarly; hut above all, he will
he penetrating—he will make n think.

such a twinkle in his eye that the assemblage roared.
It doesn't make any difference if you are of the
Protestant belief, the Catholic belief, the Jewish
belief. Or, indeed, of no belief at all. Green's talk will
cut party lines, so to speak. As he says in character
istic style, "I don't want to talk to solely Christian
congregations all the time. It's no fun il everyone
sits around agreeing with each other.''
I am tempted to say, "Hear Bryan Green at the
Convocation and at each one of In lectures." But.
I don't have to. II you hear him al the Convocation,
I feel confident that you will want to hear him at
every other opportunity.

If, was a cold, rainy day in the fall of 1950, and a
friend and I had a free hour thai we didn't know
what to do with. I had read in The Daily that an
English clergyman named Bryan Green, who had
been packing in immense crowds in San Francisco's
Grace Cathedral, was going to • " 1 ; n

Cubberley.
Having nothing better to do, I
went to Cubberley, dragging
along my very reluctant friend
whose atheism was abundant and
outspoken. My friend grumbled
all the way to Cubberley that
this was the last time that any
one was going to talk him into
hearing any minister.
At the end of the address, 1
asked my friend what he thought

of Bryan Green. He was silent, for about 10 seconds,
and then he said calmly, "lie's I lie best speaker I
i ver heard. I didn't necessarily agree with him on
every point, but he made me think like no one else
ever has before."
That was on Thursday. On Sunday, he was
scheduled to give the sermon in Memorial Church.
That Sunday it rained more fiercely than I have
ever seen it at Stanford. An unceasing drluge is
usually a perfect rationalization for people to stay
away from church. Nevertheless, the Church was
filled to capacity that morning, and hordes had to

When Bryan Green gave a week-long Mission in
New York several years ago, he drew 40.000 persons
i.i a week. On the final night, 9.000 packed into the
.VOOO capacity Cathedral to hear him.
Cancn Green, described as "the be-1 orator in ihe
Anglican (Church of England and Kpiscopal)" has a
fantastic drawing power. The above testifies lo that
But why? What, is his secret?
He has the talent, to speak lo an audience of 2 000
and yet make each individual feel lhat he is the
only one in the audience. He has Ihe drawing power
of Billy Graham, and yet uses none of Graham's
wild methods. Bryan Green has th< exquisite Kng
lish sense of humor of an Alec Guinness comedy, of
which he makes considerable use.
His speaking style is dynamic, yet he uses the
rationality of the mosl scholarly prof* sor He is

loath to quote loflily from the Bible, saying, "You
don't show people the validity of Christian living
by quoting scriptures to them."
One of ('anon Green's distinguishing character
istics is that he is crazily, wonderfully unorthodox.
He requested that he be able to meet with women
in their residence, between 10:.% and 11:110 p.m. Says
Green, "I've hied this system al other universities,
and il works perfectly. The gills leave their boy
friends at 10:30; then a strange Englishman walks
in, and they are so aghast that they have to listen to
what he's saying,"
When 1 was in England, Canon "Green invited me
to spend a few days with him and his family. One
day he took me out to a town called Uudly where he
was supposed to address a Methodist's Sunday After
noon group.It was a big occasion for the group, which
was celebrating its 25111 anniversary, and the hall
was packed.

Green, "I've hied this system al other universities,
and il works perfectly. The gills leave their boy
friends at 10:30; then a strange Englishman walks
in, and they are so aghast that they have to listen to
what he's saying,"
When 1 was in England, Canon "Green invited me
to spend a few days with him and his family. One
day he took me out to a town called Uudly where he
was supposed to address a Methodist's Sunday After
noon group.It was a big occasion for the group, which
was celebrating its 25111 anniversary, and the hall
was packed.
Most speakers would begin by saying, "It's an
honor for rne <o he here Unlay," or some such
euphemism. But not I lie unorthodox Reverend
Green. lie began:
"First of all, let me say that I thoroughly abom
inate Sunday afternoon meetings. II seems to me
that every good Fnglishman should be taking Ins
Sunday afternoon- nap at this time, not going to a
stuffy church meeting."
Most speakers couldn't have gotten away with such
a statement, but he said it in such tone and with
such a twinkle in his eye that the assemblage roared.
It doesn't make any difference if you are of the
Protestant belief, the Catholic belief, the Jewish
belief. Or, indeed, of no belief at all. Green's talk will
cut party lines, so to speak. As he says in character
istic style, "I don't want to talk to solely Christian
congregations all the time. It's no fun il everyone
sits around agreeing with each other.''
I am tempted to say, "Hear Bryan Green at the
Convocation and at each one of In lectures." But.
I don't have to. II you hear him al the Convocation,
I feel confident that you will want to hear him at
every other opportunity.
Tomorrojv at 11 a m Bryan Green will speak to
the student body. He will be unorthodox; he will be
funny; he v/ill be scholarly; hut above all, he will
he penetrating—he will make n think.
