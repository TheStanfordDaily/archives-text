# Russia's Proposal Unacceptable To Big Three Powers
## 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 10 (UP)â€”Russia
today proposed a 50-year pact of
non-aggression and mutual assist
ance for all Europe, ousting the
United States from the continental
defense system and killing the Eu
ropean army plan and the North
Atlantic alliance.
The West promptly rejected the
Soviet proposal.
Foreign Minister V M Molotov
presented it at the Big Four con
ference. His "European treaty or
ganization" shaped up as a Krem
lin substitute for NATO and EDC,
aimed at giving Russia domination
of Europe.
Molotov presented two documents
at the 15th session of'foreign min
isters. One was a diaft of the se
curity treaty. The other called for
the withdrawal of' all but a few
units of Big Four occupation forces
from Germany within six months of
treaty effectiveness
It said the Big Four could move
the troops back if either East or
West Germany were threatened.
Thus the Soviet army could sweep
back through Poland on any pre
text. with the armies of the Unit
ed States and Britain gone from
Europe.
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles turned down the scheme for
troop withdrawal. He said it would
"leave West Germany, and conse
quently much of Western Europe,
exposed to any threat of external
aggression." He also rebuffed Mo
lotov's call for a European collec
tive security conference to work out
the treaty.
