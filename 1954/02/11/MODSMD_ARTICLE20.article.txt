## It's NOT Worth It

To the Editor:
October HO, 1952 Daily editorial by Walt Mennipger
"What will happen if Eisenhowei is elected? A new
administration, a Republican ndmini tuition, will be
in power. McCarthy will have to tone down his at
tacks and he will have to fit his attitudes to those of
the Republican administration ... If the Republi
cans are electcd, McCarthy will have a superioi
Dwight Eisenhower."
II McCarthy's attitude is that of the administra
tion, thank God I'm a partisan Democrat. 1 sincerely
believe that McCarthy's attitudes ate those ol Mr.

Feeny (or .1 Parnell Thomas, if yon prefer) and his
kind, not of Mr. Eisenhower, whom McCarthy has
time and time again defied.
In the editorial of Feb 10, 1!)54, The Daily once
again puts its head in the sand and says, "Joe Mc-
Carthy? Who's he?" and "Let's .t' ; o hear him and see
what hei r - " There are those who dislike to contribute
either $1.50 or the publicity of a big crowd to the
Senator. They are neither to be pitied nor censured.
By now The Daily should realize who and what Mc-
Carthy is A lot of other folks do.
