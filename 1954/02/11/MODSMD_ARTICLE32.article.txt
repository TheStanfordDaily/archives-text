Eighty-two and two tenths per cent of students participating in
varsity football and basketball at Stanford in 1948 -49, 1949-50.
and 1950 51 have graduated, according to a survey conducted
by Director of Admissions and Faculty Athletic Representative
Rixford K. Snyder and Registrar Harvey Hall.
An additional 2.5 per cent will probably receive their degrees

this year. (Students who played in
the 1951-52 season included sopho
mores just beginning their varsity
careers. Since those men are now
seniors and will not graduate until
June, 11)54, the survey does not in
clude that or subsequent seasons.)
During this same three-year pe
riod, 75 per cent of ail men stu
dents at Stanford went through to
graduation. Approximately 77 per
cent of all freshmen who enter Stan
ford graduate, which is one of the
highest percentages in America, ar
cording to Snyder and Hall.
The varsity football and basket
ball players, during the three years
of the survey, maintained a 2.50
grade - point average compared to

2.57 for all men during this period.
Following is the breakdown of
the graduation figures for the three
years:

Dr. Snyder's and Dr. Hall's report
concludes:
"The above facts indicate (1) stu
dents who participate, in athletics at
Stanford do as well academicaly as
students wl*y do not; (2) students
who participate in athletics at Stan
lord graduate at a higher percent
age rate than those who do not.
"Stanford University is conduct
ing an athletic program which does
not demand an excessive amount of
the student's time. Student athletes
are NOT handicapped in their aca
demic records in spite of the high
standards maintained. They gradu
ate in a ratio higher than that of the
students at large and thus it is not
unfair to say that their primary
purpose in coming to Stanford is to
obtain an education and to gradu
ate."
