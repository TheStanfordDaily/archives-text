# Library Officials Cite Mutilations
## 
### 
Library officials announced re
cently that students have been mu
tilating bound volumes of periodi
cals to get information for assign
ment.. In order to keep the Library
complete, the destroyed volumes
must be replaced immediately.
However, the cost is great, and
many of them cannot be obtained
because the magazine or paper has
gone out of print.
Officials said that most destruc
tion is done with razors or sharp
knives and is not noticed until
someone wants that particular vol
ume. They also expressed the wish
that students would be more con
siderate. .
