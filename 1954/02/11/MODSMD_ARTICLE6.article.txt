### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 (UP)
â€”President Eisenhower today
rejected charges by some Re
publican spokesmen that Demo
crats are tainted with treason
and advised administration offi
cials to halt displays of "extreme
partisanship."
He made the statements at a news
conference when asked about re
cent GOP attacks on Democrats, in
cluding "political sadist" charges by
Presidential Assistant Sherman Ad
ams and "treason" accusations by
Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy (R., Wis.).
The President refused to discuss
individuals. But he said any claims
that all Democrats are tainted with
treason are completely untrue, po
litically unwise, and foolish.
He said the times are too seri
ous for extreme partisanship, and
added that he expects members of
his official family to show toler
ance for Democrats. He said this
also applies to GOP Chairman
Leonard W- Hal!
Democrats, who have beqn de
manding that the President put an
end to what some called a "rat alley
attack." appeared generally pleased
with Mr. Eisenhower's remarks.
Senate Democratic Leader Lyn
don B, Johnson said the Presi
dent's attitude "is one of a gentle
man and an American."
"It is unfortunate that his advis
ers have put him in a position
where he had to publicly rebuke
them," Johnson said. "I hope the
Republicans for once will take no
tice of his attitude so we can pro
ceed with the problems and busi
ness ahead in a spirit of reason and
unity."
