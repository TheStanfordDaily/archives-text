# Bayne Favors Oil Agreement
## 
### JOHN McFEE 
"Because democracy exists
only in a society where there is
stability, Iran, if it is to have de
mocracy, must obtain an oil
agreement and become stable,"
said Edward A. Bayne, Middle
Eastern authority for the Ameri
can Universities Field Staff, yes
terday afternoon in Cubberley
Auditorium, in a talk on "-The
Prospects of Democracy in Iran."
If Iran ever reaches an oil settle
ment, Bayne went on, democracy is
very possible because two starts
have already been made in that di
rection:
First, a constitutional structure
has existed in Iran since 1907 when
the newly-risen' middle class se
cured a constitution from the then
all-powerful Shah. A definite Irani
an parliament functions in which
there is free expression and other
democratic practices. However, the
landlords and the upper class com
prise most of the representatives.
Sccond, some democratic prog
ress has been made recently in the
villages which, according to Bayne,
are "the stable part of the popu
lation." During Mossadegh's rule,
each village was required to set up
a village council which comprised
several members of the commu
nity.
But in order for democracy to
flourish properly in the country,
continued Bayne, communications
must be established between the
government and the villages, some
thing which did not exist at all a
few years ago. To accomplish this,
Mossadegh had 10 per cent of the
gross village profit, turned over to
its council, which would use it for
improvements in the aiea, particu
larly for the building of schools.
This last move has three long
range effects, Bayne went on: A
definite credit relationship is es
tablished in the village; the til
lage gets schools which brings it
into close relationship with the
government s education depart
ment; and the school itself de
velops into a community center
which in turn has a definite con
tact with the government.
