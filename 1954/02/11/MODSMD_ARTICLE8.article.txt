# Organic Architecture Is Inevitable In America, Says Frank Lloyd Wright
## 
### DICK MANSFIELD 
Frank Lloyd Wright looked up
at the high ceiling ol Memorial
Auditorium. "We are gathered
here tonight, in a vacuum three
times the size that would be
necessary, . . he began,
The man who was introduced as
"our greatest living architect" lec
tured to an audience which filled
the auditorium to hear him last
night in the first major event of
his two-day visit to Stanford
Wright spoke on "organic archi
tecture," which he presented as the
"inevitable" answer in America to
the extremely stylized architectural
pattern which has been followed
ever since the Italian Renaissance.
This architecture, which in
America is merely "the American
version of the English version of
the French version of the Italian
Renaissance," typifies what
Wright called "Grandomania": a

tendency to "give mankind an in
feriority complex through the si 2£
and grandeur incorporated into
every architectural product.
The American answer — organic
architecture — sprang up ("not a
renaissance — this was something
entirely new!") about 60 years ago
to prevent "grandomania" from
overwhelming this country's archi
tecture.
Organic architecture, Wright said,
must "be born—be grown—like a
tree —like a flower—like anything
which grows from the ground." It
must be based on introspection and
an evaluation of "the freedom of the
individual perceived as such . .
But then the 84-year-okl archi
tect turned and severely criti
cized America's approach to the
culture necessary to these evalu
ations. "Americans ate juvenile—
all juvenile — when it comes to
culture," he said,
"Why does it take so long to get
an idea planted in the mind of a

young nation? We have no real
culture; look at the telephone poles
and wires which ruin our view of
the landscape , . "
Nature in the sense in which it
must be used in organic architec
ture does not imply the nature of
trees and flowers so much as "na
ture in the philosophical sense" and
man's relation to it, Wright asserted.
The new scale ol architecture—
what is it? "The human being,"
Wright said The democratic idea!
of man as an individual must be
emphasized in architecture.
"The task before us—not only in
architecture but in every walk of
life—is to know and distinguish be
tween mediocrity, the commonplace,
and the superior," he said. "Don't
be sold down the river on behalf of
any common man!"
Wright met briefly with interested
persons in the Little Theater after
his talk. He will meet with various
special groups today and leave the
campus this evening.

the auditorium to hear him last
night in the first major event of
his two-day visit to Stanford
Wright spoke on "organic archi
tecture," which he presented as the
"inevitable" answer in America to
the extremely stylized architectural
pattern which has been followed
ever since the Italian Renaissance.
This architecture, which in
America is merely "the American
version of the English version of
the French version of the Italian
Renaissance," typifies what
Wright called "Grandomania": a

tendency to "give mankind an in
feriority complex through the si 2£
and grandeur incorporated into
every architectural product.
The American answer — organic
architecture — sprang up ("not a
renaissance — this was something
entirely new!") about 60 years ago
to prevent "grandomania" from
overwhelming this country's archi
tecture.
Organic architecture, Wright said,
must "be born—be grown—like a
tree —like a flower—like anything
which grows from the ground." It
must be based on introspection and
an evaluation of "the freedom of the
individual perceived as such . .
But then the 84-year-okl archi
tect turned and severely criti
cized America's approach to the
culture necessary to these evalu
ations. "Americans ate juvenile—
all juvenile — when it comes to
culture," he said,
"Why does it take so long to get
an idea planted in the mind of a

young nation? We have no real
culture; look at the telephone poles
and wires which ruin our view of
the landscape , . "
Nature in the sense in which it
must be used in organic architec
ture does not imply the nature of
trees and flowers so much as "na
ture in the philosophical sense" and
man's relation to it, Wright asserted.
The new scale ol architecture—
what is it? "The human being,"
Wright said The democratic idea!
of man as an individual must be
emphasized in architecture.
"The task before us—not only in
architecture but in every walk of
life—is to know and distinguish be
tween mediocrity, the commonplace,
and the superior," he said. "Don't
be sold down the river on behalf of
any common man!"
Wright met briefly with interested
persons in the Little Theater after
his talk. He will meet with various
special groups today and leave the
campus this evening.
