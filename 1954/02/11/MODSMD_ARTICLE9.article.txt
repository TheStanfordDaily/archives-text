# The 						Frosh-Soph Jamboree: An Idea, A Challenge, A Rivalry, A Tradition
## 
### TOM PIERCE 
The annual Frosh-Soph Jam
boree, which will take place
Saturday, is the traditional ath
letic clash between the spirited
lower division classes. Unlike
coffee lines at the Cellar, Stan
ford Sadie, or the "no-smoking
on-lnner-Quad" rule, however,
the Jamboree is a relatively new
Stanford tradition.
The idea of a Jamboree originated
in the autumn of 1947 when the
freshman football team challenged
"any and all willing sophomores" to
opppose them in a game early in the
following quarter That year Chuck
Taylor, the coach who three years
later would send Stanford to the
Rose Bowl, was coaching the cocky
freshman gi idders
The sophomores, appalled but
willing, took up the challenge and
set a February date Practice for
both squads began at 'be opening
of winter quarter, with strict
training rules applied. Taylor an
nounced that his team would "use
a T formation, emphasizing plays
with top speed and deception,"
while the sophomores concen
trated on an aeiia! attack
About this time the idea caught
hold, and the classes began to or
ganize other contests to comple
ment the football game and pro
vide greater participation.
Within days the solitary contest
grew to be a full weekend of ri
valry between the classes.
The night before the big affair a
"jolly-up, no-date" dance was or
ganized at a well-known establish
ment west of the campus. The
\v wJ Cc..td .U« M.ti..,

women were admitted free. Also,
"in order that there will be enough
women." transportation was pro
vided from the Women's Row. At
the dance the beard-growing con
test was judged, and entertainment
was provided, featuring "Roaring 50
dancing girls, starring Fifi."
The contests the next day, be
sides the featured football game,
included such novelty events as
log rolling, an inner tube race, a
"new look" race, a tire pull, a

milk drinking contest, a rail-rid
ing event, and a wheelbarrow re
lay. A tug of war was also sched
uled.
In the evening a Jamboree Ball
was held in the Women's Gym.
Decorations were judged, a dance
contest accounted for the final
points, and the first Jamboree tro
phy was awarded.
The freshmen won the first Jam
boree. This, however, has not been
turned into a tradition.

The annual Frosh-Soph Jam
boree, which will take place
Saturday, is the traditional ath
letic clash between the spirited
lower division classes. Unlike
coffee lines at the Cellar, Stan
ford Sadie, or the "no-smoking
on-lnner-Quad" rule, however,
the Jamboree is a relatively new
Stanford tradition.
The idea of a Jamboree originated
in the autumn of 1947 when the
freshman football team challenged
"any and all willing sophomores" to
opppose them in a game early in the
following quarter That year Chuck
Taylor, the coach who three years
later would send Stanford to the
Rose Bowl, was coaching the cocky
freshman gi idders
The sophomores, appalled but
willing, took up the challenge and
set a February date Practice for
both squads began at 'be opening
of winter quarter, with strict
training rules applied. Taylor an
nounced that his team would "use
a T formation, emphasizing plays
with top speed and deception,"
while the sophomores concen
trated on an aeiia! attack
About this time the idea caught
hold, and the classes began to or
ganize other contests to comple
ment the football game and pro
vide greater participation.
Within days the solitary contest
grew to be a full weekend of ri
valry between the classes.
The night before the big affair a
"jolly-up, no-date" dance was or
ganized at a well-known establish
ment west of the campus. The
\v wJ Cc..td .U« M.ti..,

women were admitted free. Also,
"in order that there will be enough
women." transportation was pro
vided from the Women's Row. At
the dance the beard-growing con
test was judged, and entertainment
was provided, featuring "Roaring 50
dancing girls, starring Fifi."
The contests the next day, be
sides the featured football game,
included such novelty events as
log rolling, an inner tube race, a
"new look" race, a tire pull, a

milk drinking contest, a rail-rid
ing event, and a wheelbarrow re
lay. A tug of war was also sched
uled.
