## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Rev. Bryan Green, the English
minister who will address a Uni
versity Convocation at 11 o'clock
this morning, is an uncommon
man. Green, a middle - aged,
slightly - stocky Englishman with
graying curly hair and piercing
eyes, is one of the world's out
standing Christian leaders. He is
a striking personality, uncommon
in his unorthodoxy, striking in his
wit, and masterful in scholarly
abilities.
Tales are told the world ovei of
his unorthodoxy and of his trait
oi always speaking forthrightly.
From the pulpit of ont of Boston's
most fashionable churches, one in
which lie found the congregation

to be somewhat hypocritical, he
said, "1 think that Christ should
bate to he in this church."
Canon Green often visits the
factories iti England during their
lunch time. "It's not easy," says
Green, "because I have to com
pete with the food for their at
tention."
During one of these visits, a
Communist worker heckled,
"What arc you trying to do, ram
religion down our throats?"
The It e c to r of Birmingham
paused a minute and then an
swered, "Yes."
Once, a young couple came in
to ask whether they could be mar
ried l>y Canon Green.
"ilow Ion." have you known each

other?" asked the English clergy
man.
"Two days."
''Well, nonsense. Coine back in
six months and tell me you want
lo be married and I'll listen to
you."
Canon Green has long been
known for his ability to make
each member of a large audience
feel like he is the only one being
spoken to, mainly because of his
amazing audience perception. A
Stanford student recounts the
following experience:
"When Canon Green spoke to
Overflow crowds in San Francis
co's Grace Cathedral four years
ago, 1 went up to hear him. I was
rather disturbed, because in front

of me were two boys and a girl
who weren't paying attention and
were joking around while he spoke.
It disturbed ine because they ap
peared to be the only ones around
me who weren't intent upon his
words.
"Later I had the opportunity to
meet Bryan Green and I dis
covered to my amazement that he
had been cognizant of those same
three people, although there were
several thousand in the audience.
He said that he tried to vary his
talk a bit, just to draw their at
tention. It's the most amazing ex
ample of audience perception that
I have encountered."
Canon Green has spoken (o
turn-away crowds ail over the

world, drawing 40,(100 persons in
a week in New York City.
One of Green's best-known
characteristics is his indefatigable
energy. He spends two months of
the year traveling around the
world on speaking engagements.
The other ten, he acts as official
Chaplain of the city of Birming
ham; is rector of the city's largest
church; does work lor the poor;
writes weekly articles for Eng
land's largest papers; has regular
radio and television shows; and
raises a family of three on the
side.

"Later I had the opportunity to

covered to my amazement that he

ample of audience perception that
I have encountered."
Canon Green has spoken (o
turn-away crowds ail over the

world, drawing 40,(100 persons in

Bryan Green is an uncommon

on Green)
Rev. Bryan Green, the English
minister who will address a Uni
versity Convocation at 11 o'clock
this morning, is an uncommon
man. Green, a middle - aged,
slightly - stocky Englishman with
graying curly hair and piercing
eyes, is one of the world's out
standing Christian leaders. He is
a striking personality, uncommon
in his unorthodoxy, striking in his
wit, and masterful in scholarly
abilities.
Tales are told the world ovei of
his unorthodoxy and of his trait
oi always speaking forthrightly.
From the pulpit of ont of Boston's
most fashionable churches, one in
which lie found the congregation

to be somewhat hypocritical, he
said, "1 think that Christ should
bate to he in this church."
Canon Green often visits the
factories iti England during their
lunch time. "It's not easy," says
Green, "because I have to com
pete with the food for their at
tention."
During one of these visits, a
Communist worker heckled,
"What arc you trying to do, ram
religion down our throats?"
The It e c to r of Birmingham
paused a minute and then an
swered, "Yes."
Once, a young couple came in
to ask whether they could be mar
ried l>y Canon Green.
"ilow Ion." have you known each

other?" asked the English clergy
man.
"Two days."
''Well, nonsense. Coine back in
six months and tell me you want
lo be married and I'll listen to
you."
Canon Green has long been
known for his ability to make
each member of a large audience
feel like he is the only one being
spoken to, mainly because of his
amazing audience perception. A
Stanford student recounts the
following experience:
"When Canon Green spoke to
Overflow crowds in San Francis
co's Grace Cathedral four years
ago, 1 went up to hear him. I was
rather disturbed, because in front

of me were two boys and a girl
who weren't paying attention and
were joking around while he spoke.
It disturbed ine because they ap
peared to be the only ones around
me who weren't intent upon his
