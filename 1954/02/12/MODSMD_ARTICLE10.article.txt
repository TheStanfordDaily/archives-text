# His Purpose Here
## 
### 
Bryan Green will speak to Stanford today.
His address in Memorial Auditorium at 11 a.m. will open
a week of discussions, lectures, and informal conferences
on the theme of "Basic Christianity."
His theme is both broad and fundamental in scope. But
Canon Creen has indicated to people in all parts of the
world that his penetrating understanding of that theme is
also broad and fundamental.
His audience will not be composed wholly of those
whose lives are ingrained in the life of the church and the
Christian ethic. It will represent many brands of thought.
A large part of it will be composed of students of the"I don't
know" type of secularism.
Bryan Green will understand that audience. He will un
derstand the characteristics of the youthful, logical, gues
tioning mind. Because of that understanding, he will not be
speaking to an outmoded stereotype of yes-men. He will
be speaking to the Stanford student of 1954.
He will be eloquent and casual, sober and whimsical,
serious and witty. He v/ill demonstrate to all who see and
hear him a mastery of the arts of language and speaking.
But Bryan Green's choice of words and tone of voice are
important only in that they will help us to understand what
he is saying. His essential purpose is not to impress us with
personality or blind us into acceptance of his ideas and
faith. His essential purpose is to present those ideas and
that faith so effectively that we will think deeply about our
own.
We hope that the Stanford student will listen to him.
