# A 						New 'Tradition'?
## 
### 
Tomorrow night a couple hundred Stanford
students will recreate Hollywood's version of
a Parisian artists' ball—black and white cos
tumes, surrealistic decorations, balloons and
confetti, a jazz band—the whole works.
If this first Beaux Arts Ball proves the suc
cess its sponsors hope for it, it may well be
come an annual tradition.
We're all for new all-campus traditions to
replace hangovers like "Hello Day on Inner
Quad" and "Back to the Farm Clothes" that

most students consider outmoded.
To us the Beaux Arts Ball is proof of a pet
theory—that students will support all-campus
events, if those events are well planned.
We're tired of being told that students are
naturally apathetic and afraid to try anything
different. We're grateful to the Beaux Arts
Committee for giving us a chance to prove we
will respond to imagination and originality.
And we wish them "bonne chance" for to
morrow night's dance. —Barbara Tuerk
