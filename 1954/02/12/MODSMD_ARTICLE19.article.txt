## The 						'Real News'

To the Editor:
The Junior Senator from Wisconsin may be a
rabble-rouser in intent and by reputation, but he is
not one in effect. To this the unhappy audience in
San Mateo bore witness last night. The Senator's
opponents left the session bored (though relieved),
and his partisans showed the anguish of unfulfilled
emotional satisfaction. That Mr. McCarthy is a poor
demagogue and that his primitive platform antics
cannot stand comparison with such masters of the
trade as Huey Long, or Mussolini, or La Passionara,
is the real news that was made in the Fiesta Build
ing.
Some preconceived notion of The Daily's political
correspondent as to the kind of reaction a Senator
McCarthy ought to get from his listeners inclined him
to write in the number of Feb. 11 about an audience
"held spellbound," "listening avidly," and in the end
"silent for a breathless moment." "Then the thunder
claps of applause burst forth and beat on for min

utes."
Many who were in the' audience with me last
night will agree, I think, that the report imparts a
distorted impression of the evening. But the re
porter's rich beautiful prose goes some way in
showing us how a mediocre politician is nurtured
into a man of importance in world affairs.

(Ed. note: Even the most experienced profes
sional reporter is aware of the difficulty of gauging
audience reaction to a speech or rally. When a re
porter is necessarily focusing his attention on the
actual content of a speech, when he must remain
in one section of the auditorium throughout the
speech, it is inevitable that he may occasionally
err in his description of the reaction of the whole
audience. The Daily staff is aware of this problem.
Its efforts to report the news are conditioned by
that awareness.)
