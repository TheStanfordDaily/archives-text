# Large Crowds Greeted Green During His First Visit Here
## 
### J.A. HUNLEY 
When Bryan Green came to the United States in 1950, Stanford
was fortunate enough to be included on his itinerary. As part
of his series of talks in the Bay Area, Canon Green came to Palo
Alto on Nov. 30 and Dec. 3.
The English clergyman was greeted by large crowds at each

of his three talks. Despite heavy
downpours on Dec. 8. his sermon
on "Finding a Real Faith" filled
Memorial Church.
He also spoke in Cubberley Aud
itorium on "Religion and the Mod
ern Mind" and he conducted a ques
tion and answer session in the En
cina lounge.
He stated that of the three "in
sights of faith"—atheism, agnosti
cism, and theism, theism is "to me,
the most reasonable."
Also, he said, "I have no use for
a Christian who has no reasons.
I would not advise any man to be
come a Christian lightly. The
Christian insight of faith carries
with it the greatest moral respon
sibility of all faiths — Christians
' . must dedicate their lives to good
ness."
Among other statements he made
*' ftre: "You will never make people
.a iristians until you confront them
• with Christ. . . . Thoughtful peo
ple realize that you can't beat Com
.. uiunism with armed forces. You
need faith—sound, Christian faith."
