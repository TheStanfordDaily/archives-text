## McCarthy's San Mateo Speech Indicates Defiance to Ike's Plea 
### HADLEY ROFF G.O.P. chieftains 
Republican Senator Joseph R.
McCarthy (Wis.) made one
thing very clear when he visited
in the area Wednesday.
That is that he intends to continue
his ferocious attack not only against
the Democratic party but also
against some of the policies of his
own party, despite the plea by Pres
ident Eisenhower that Republican
speakers avoid "extreme partisan
ship."
This determination of his became
fully apparent when he talked with
newsmen in the afternoon and ad
dressed a large Lincoln Day gather
ing in San Mateo in the evening.
At the press conference he said,
"I plan to continue with the same
line of speeches."
And at the Lincoln Day rally he
declared, "I have no intention of
letting up on the Democrats to
put over the Eisenhower pro
gram."
McCarthy told reporters that, "I
intend to continue to give the cold
facts to all of the audiences I ad
dress. When this hurts, there are
bound to be screams of abuse, but
I do not think the President was
advising that we conduct a white
wash."
And he told the 6,200 persons who
nearly filled the Fiesta Building in
San Mateo that he does "not sub
scribe" to the appeal to temper
speeches.
Aside from these rather blunt
refusals to go along with Mr.
Eisenhower's request, McCarthy
gave other indications of differ
ences with the leaders of his
party and the policies pursued by
them.
For one thing, he urged that aid
be cut off to allies if they carry on
any sort of trade with Red China,
a scheme so far disregarded by his
party.
For another, he advocated the im
position of a blockade of the China
coast, a policy that through history
has led only to one thing—war—and
one that has so far been dismissed

The marked lack of the Senator's
party spirit was also evidenced by
his only passing, rather perfunctory
reference to Republican leaders in
this state —though usually it is a
matter of common courtesy among
politicians to speak highly of party
officials when visiting in their state.
And it was further indicated by
his only casual reference to Abra
ham Lincoln — he simply called
him. a "great American"—though
he was suposed to be speaking in
honor of that man at a celebra
tion signalizing the 100 th anniver
sary of the GOP.
The whole emphasis of his heated,
table pounding speech was primarily
on one man doing one job—the man
being McCarthy, the job. purport
edly being the uncovering of com
munism infiltration in this country.
Near the conclusion of his speech
he did say that he would support
Eisenhower if the former military
commander were to run for the
presidency again—but he said it
with a left handed curve.
'"I supported Eisenhower in 1952
and I would support him just as
actively today," he said, adding:
"Not that his record is perfect—
but that it is so much better than the
administrations of the last 20 years."
This came only after he had com
pleted building what he considered
a case establishing that the Demo
cratic administrations had acted
treasonably.
