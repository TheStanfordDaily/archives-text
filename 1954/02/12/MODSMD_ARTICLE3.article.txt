# Farm Drop Not Foreseen
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb 11 (UP)â€”A
tup Agriculture Department econo
mist predicted today that farm prices
and income will remain about the
same this year as in 1953, barring
bad weather or bad times.
The forecast of an even pace in
farm prices and farmer income in
1954 was given the committee by O.
V. Wells, head of the Agriculture
Department's agricultural marketing
service.
Simultaneously a Harvard econo
mist said the present high price
support program "prevented a farm
decline of major proportions."
The professor, John K. Galbraith,
was one of three economists who
attacked the administration's pro
posal for lower "flexible" farm price
props in testimony before the Sen
ate-House economic committee.
Most congressional leaders expcct
that Congress, in an election year,
will continue present high supports
at least another year.
