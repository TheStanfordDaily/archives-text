# DEFERMENTS, INJUNCTIONS, G.I. BILLS
## Vet Office Handles Draft Problems 
### JAY BECKER 
Practically every man of draft age
at Stanford enters the Veterans'
Records Office at least once a year.
This office, under Director W. J.
Findfcisen, handles Selective Serv
ice problems of students and is the
liaison between Stanford gov
ernmental agencies for v irans.
This is the oliiee which sends
tfrade transcripts to draft boards,
handles administration for veter
ans attending school under the
GI bill, and supplies the latest
draft information.
The office was established when
GI bills began to go into effect. Fin
deisen has handled students' Se
lective Service problems since the
bginning of autumn quarter, when
Richard L. Balch, Chief Counselor

for Men, took a short leave of ab
sence to go East.
When asked how draft law
changes would affect students,
Findeisen said that the possibility
of being drafted will probably re
main the same for most students
even though the law is changed.
This is because of the relatively
enviable position the student has
had in relation to others covered
by the Selective Service laws.
"Very few Stanford undergradu
ates have been drafted from school,"
said Findeisen. "Only one person
was drafted autumn quarter from
Stanford."
According to the law, to be in line
for a 11-S (student's deferment) the
freshman must be in the upper half
of his class, the sophomore in the

upper two-thirds and the junior in
the upper three-fourths. A senior
planning graduate work should be
in the upper half of his class.
However, unless a student plans
advanced work in medicine, engi
neering, or the physical sciences,
draft boards liave little disposi
tion to extend deferments beyond
the four years," said Findeisen.
"The student wlio begins graduate
work without a deferment is
walking on eggs," he said.
If a student has dropped behind
in his program for academic or oth
er reasons most draft boards would
be reluctant to grant a new defer
ment when the old one runs out.
But any student who may have a
time, money, or academic credit
hardship worked on him by being

drafted out of school before the end
of the quarter should see Findeisen
and have him write a letter to the
student's draft board. Usually they
will grant, a stay-of-induction until
the end of the quarter.
Barring a national emergency,
once deferred students will prob
ably be able to complete their stud
ies for the period specified.
"After all the guessing is over,
whether you are drafted or not de
pends on the demands of the local
Selective Service board and what
you want to do in relation to the
national interest, health, welfare,
and safety," sakl Findeisen. "Get
good grades and come to this office
with any Selective Service prob
lems or questions and you are fairly
safe."
