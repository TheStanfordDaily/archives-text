# Wright Calls Architecture Here Confused
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Frank Lloyd Wright, renowned
84 - year - old architect with the
George Bernard Shaw humor and
the delightful egotism to match, at
a press conference yesterday de
scribed Stanford as "a pitiful ex
ample of the wreckage of a great
architectural idea."
Wright, carrying a cane and
wearing a long jet-black coat with
a scarf and caved-in hat of the
same color, said, "Unfortunately,
the master architect (Frederick
Olmstead) didn't live to supervise
his own idea. As usual, trustees
and others managed to botch up
the idea.
"Stanford is a conrused mass of
unrelated buildings in an unrelated
style of architecture. If the idea of
the master architect had been fol
lowed, it would have been varied
and beautiful. Now, it's just var
ied."
A photographc r asked the
white-mancd architect to pose for
a picture. As he did Wright
smiled, "The worst feature of in
advertently becoming famous is
posing for pictures."
Wright continued, "The only ex
ample of the master hand staying
there to see that the plan went
through was at Southern Florida
at Lakeland, which I designed. But
there, we didn't have much captial.
"Here, at Stanford, there was a
reservoir of wealth, and this Uni
versity could have become an ex
ample of scholastic architecture."
Wright said that he didn't mind
eyesores, but that Stanford was a
soul sore, and that soul sores
strike deeper than eyesores. He
referred often to other parts of
our culture, indicating that archi
tecture suffered from the same
malady as politics and even our
daily life . . . "a lack of depth, a
lack of genius."
Wright, described as "the most
famous living architect," said, "We
are juvenile in regard to our cul
ture. You just have to pick up the
paper and turn on the radio. It's
quite as refreshing as taking the
cover off a cesspool."
Wright, who expressed cynicism
about modern architecture and cul
ture, ended on a hopeful note:
"Thirty years from now, we're go
ing to have some architecture. All
the old myths will be blown away.
And all will be fresh."
