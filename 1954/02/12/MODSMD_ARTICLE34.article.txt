# Tetanus, Typhoid Shots Are Offered
## 
### 
The Stanford Health Service is
now offering to all registered stu
dents immunization shots against
tetanus and typhoid. This program
is sponsored by the Student Health
Committee.
One of many medical services of
fered by the University, the shots
are free of charge. The program is
not advised for students already in
the ROTC, and is recommended
mainly for women and non-mili
tary men.
The Health Center suggests that
students interested in traveling
abroad this summer begin the im
munization program immediately,
since the length of time required
for these shots varies with the in
dividual.
Students who are in doubt about

the time which has elapsed since
they last were immunized should go
to the Health Service for informa
tion.

children's ward of the Palo Alto Hospital. They were donated by
the hospital staff in 1948 in memory of their first superintendent,
James Philips. —Daily photo by Jack Byrne
