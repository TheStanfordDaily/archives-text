# Card Ruggers Enter S.F. Tourney
## 
### FRANK CAMINO 
Pete Kmetovic's undefeated rugby
squad journeys to Balboa Soccer
Stadium in San Francisco to play a
round robin match tomorrow after
noon at 2:00.
The match will find the Indians
meeting COP, Olympic Club, Palo
Alto Ramblers, and the Petaluma
Leghorns, all in the same afternoon.

The match was arranged in
order to introduce rugby to the
San Francisco public and to alTord
Northern California Rugby Union
teams with competitive experience.
Approximately the same thirty
four man squad for Stanford that
traveled to Stockton last week will
make the trip. The squad will com
pete with Â«fu:h of the four other

teams for a quarter of a game.
This match should give the Card
serums much needed experience. Up
to now Bud Standifer and Dick
Abraham, the two most experienced
linemen, have given the scrum most
of its cohesion and drive. However
neophytes such as Donn Carswel!
and Dixon Smith are constantly im
proving with each game.
The powerful Card backfield will
display its poise once more. The
Indian backs, and more specifically
Dorsey Atkinson, have been the bell
weather of the ruggers. At the pres
ent time Dorsey is the leading In
dian scorer.
Dick Monteith, Ron Cook, Bud
Carr, Jack Lewis, and Don Mueller
are the other leading men in the
backfield.
Stanford's basketballers are the
second highest scoring team in the
Pacific Coast Conference's Southern
Division, according to official sta
tistics released yesterday.
