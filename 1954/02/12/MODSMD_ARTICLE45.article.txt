# Troy Invades Stanford Gym Tonight
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
USC Coach Forrest Twogood brings his "emphasis on youth" squad into the Stanford Pavilion
tonight and tomorrow night to battle with Bob Burnett's cellar-dweliing Indians. Loth conference
games will start at 8:30.
Front-running California (5-1) tangles with UCLA (3-3) in a pair of crucial tilts in Westwood.
It will be the third meeting of the year between SC (3-3) and Stanford (1-5) as the clubs split
a pair in Los Angeles in January, with the Indians winning 61-59 and losing 71-69.
Burnett expects to play the same type of game and hopes to beat the visitors by employing
speed. He figures that the Trojans are bigger, but that the Cards are faster, have quicker reflexes,

and are better shooters. He said,
"We'll simply try to get down the
court before they can get their de
fense set."
Dave Epperson, lanky Card for
ward, will get his first league start
ing assignment, replacing Barry
Brown. Epperson has provided a

much-needed scoring punch lately,
having tallied 40 points in the last
four games.
Olie SuzdalefT has been bothered
by the knee he reinsured in the first
minute of Friday's UCLA game, but
he is a probable starter. Burnett
commented that his playmaking co
captain played "courageously" in
the UCLA series.
Russ Lavvler, who was ham
pered by a flu bug last weekend,
is fully recovered and will be out
to maintain bis lead in the PCC's
individual scoring race. The big
center has tallied 100 points in
conference play and needs only
two points to bring his season
output to :too.
Co-captain Don DeLong will op
erate as the other forward, and old
reliable George Selleck will main
tain his guard spot.
Ron Wagner and Brown are
also expected to see plenty of ac
tion for the Indians.
SC, which is very much in the
pennant fight, surprised Cal last
week by dumping it Friday night,
53-49. They lost Saturday, 46-32.
The Trojans rely on seven play
ers and of these only Dick Hammer
is a senior. It is a well-balanced
club with each player about equal.
Again-t Cal, Troy played a slow,
deliberate ball control game and
tied up the Cal drives by clogging
the center with four men and allow
ing the BtTurs lo shoot from the
outside, which they did unsuccess
fully.
SC's main threat, if one must be
singled out, is ti-lt. sVfe-in. center
Koy Irvin, who was on the All-
Southern Division second team last
year. Irvin did a fabulous job hold
ing McKeen to 17 points in last
week's games. Irvin has a good hook
• hot and is strong under the boards.
Chet Carr will go at one for
ward for the Trojans. The (i-ft.-4
product from Benicia High is ail
other strong rebounder and has a
fine touch around the basket.
Last year he scored 2.1 points
against Stanford in one game.
Twoftood will employ either
sophomores Jack Dunne or Ralph
Pausig at the other forward spot.
Dunne, (» ft. .'{'i. in., shattered all
freshman scoring records last
year, hitting .'{.'{4 points for an

18.G average. Employing a dead
ly jump shot, he tallied 17 points
in SC's win over the Cards this
year.
Pausig has been used for his re
bounding punch, but has shown lit
tle in the way of scoring ability.
Captain Dick Welsh, bas
ket in the last three seconds defeat
ed Stanford down south, is the top
hustler on the squad.
Either sophomore Tony Psaltis or
senior Dick Hammer will go at the
other guard. Psaltis is the best
long-range gunner on the club and
is being touted as the next Ken
Flower, but so far hasn't lived up
to advance notice. Hammer is the
fastest man on the squad and was a
starter two years ago.
The Trojan scoring has been
bunched among the starters in their
three league victories which include
a decision over each conference foe.
Burnett believes the Indians
have a slim outside chance for
Division laurels as long as there
is a mathematical possibility. He
believes that if Stanford can't
make it, it will play the spoiler
role and knock one or two of the
hopefuls out of contention.


FINALLY GETS HIS CHANCE — Card guard Oleg Suzdaleif
banged up his knee shortly before Stanford's opening confer
ence series with SC early in January, but tonight gets his chance
to show the Trojans what they missed when he teams up with
perky George Selleck. Suzdaleff hit 23 against UCLA last week
end. —Photo courtesy Palo Alto Times
