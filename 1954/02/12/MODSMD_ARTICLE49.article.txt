Stanford's boxing team swept
to a decisive 5-3 victory over
Santa Clara last night at the Pa
vilion before an almost packed
house. Fighting before one of
the largest crowds ever to wit
ness a boxing match at Stanford,
Coach Ray Lunny's men did not
lose a single bout. The Broncos
accumulated their points on a
pair of forfeits and draws.
Turning to the bouts, and first to
the heavyweight brawl, the one that
drew in the crowd, Santa Clara
stuck a midget in the ring against
Stanford's ferocious Bob Birkie. And
Walter Conn, a comparative midget
pounds—certainly gave a good ac
count of himself, although Birkie
was awarded a split decision.
Conn cleverly fought Birkie by
backing up with his gloves down
in order to better watch and avoid
bis opponent. Though the decision
justly went to the more aggressive
Birkie, Conn demonstrated that
Stanford's undefeated heavy
weight still has a lot to learn
about the fine points of boxing.
In what was probably the best
boxing exhibition of the evening,
Stanford's Eric Hansen took a three
round decision from Dave Van Etten
in the 156-lb. division.
In the best streetside brawl of the
night, the Indians' Fred Dittmer,
139 lbs., smashed his way to a
bloody decision over Chuck Wis
wall.
The light-heavyweight match was
also quite a brawl. Stanford's stocky
Len Doster batled a much taller
and far reaching Tom Zajec to a
three-round draw.
In the night's most one-sided
light, fast-improving 125-pounder
Rocky Tolley of Stanford smashed
Santa Clara's Ed Kranz from one
side of the ring to the other, win
ning by a IKO in the third.
The 165-lb. bout was the second
draw of the evening. Doug Stocks of
Stanford and Curt Cole of Santa
Clara battled on even terms for the
regulation three rounds.
