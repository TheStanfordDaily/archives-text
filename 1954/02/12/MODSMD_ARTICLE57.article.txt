# THE 						DU PONT DIGEST
## Technical Sales 
### 
A major in glibness and a minor in
solid information —those were the
mythical requirements for a sales
man in the old days. But they really
never sufficed for a man selling the
products of chemical technology.
Today, the diverse applications of
Du Pout's 1200 products and prod
uct lines create a need for trained
sales personnel representing many
different technical backgrounds.
These men must deal intelligently
with problems in chemistry and en
gineering applied to such fields as
plastics, ceramics, textiles, and many
others.
Du Pont technical men are as
signed to various type* of technical
sales activity. In some spots they are
equipped to handle all phases of sell

ing. Tll others they deal mainly with
customer problems. Also, certain de
partments maintain sales develop
ment sections, where technical prob
lems connected with the introduction
of a new product, or a new applica
tion for an established product, are
worked out.
For example, a technical man in
one of Du Pout's sales groups was
recently called upon to help a cus
tomer make a better and less expen
sive hose for car radiators. Involved
were problems in compounding, such
as choice and amount of neoprene,
inert fillers, softeners, accelerators,
and antioxidants. Correct processing
methods also had to lx» worked out,
including optimum time and tem
perature of milling and extruding.
The successful completion of this

€P0NJ>

project naturally gave a good deal
of satisfaction to the customer as
well as Du Pont.
In another case a customer wanted
to reduce carbon contamination of
arc welding rod stock. A Du Pont
technical service man suggested
changes in cleaning procedures that
lowered contamination by 90 per
cent. The new process also reduced
metal loss during heat treatment—a
benefit that more than offset, the cost
of the additional cleaning operations.
Technical men interested in sales
work usually start in a laboratory or
manufacturing plant where t hey can
acquire needed background. Depend
ing on their interest and abilities,
they may then move into technical
sales service, sales development, or
direct sales.
In any of these fields, the man
with the right combination of sales
aptitude and technical knowledge
will find interesting work, and excep
tional opportunities for growth in the
Du Pont Company.

A major in glibness and a minor in
solid information —those were the
mythical requirements for a sales
man in the old days. But they really
never sufficed for a man selling the
products of chemical technology.
Today, the diverse applications of
Du Pout's 1200 products and prod
uct lines create a need for trained
sales personnel representing many
different technical backgrounds.
These men must deal intelligently
with problems in chemistry and en
gineering applied to such fields as
plastics, ceramics, textiles, and many
others.
Du Pont technical men are as
signed to various type* of technical
sales activity. In some spots they are
equipped to handle all phases of sell

ing. Tll others they deal mainly with
customer problems. Also, certain de
partments maintain sales develop
ment sections, where technical prob
lems connected with the introduction
of a new product, or a new applica
tion for an established product, are
worked out.
For example, a technical man in
one of Du Pout's sales groups was
recently called upon to help a cus
tomer make a better and less expen
sive hose for car radiators. Involved
were problems in compounding, such
as choice and amount of neoprene,
inert fillers, softeners, accelerators,
and antioxidants. Correct processing
methods also had to lx» worked out,
including optimum time and tem
perature of milling and extruding.
The successful completion of this

€P0NJ>

project naturally gave a good deal
of satisfaction to the customer as
well as Du Pont.
In another case a customer wanted
to reduce carbon contamination of
arc welding rod stock. A Du Pont
technical service man suggested
changes in cleaning procedures that
lowered contamination by 90 per
cent. The new process also reduced
metal loss during heat treatment—a
benefit that more than offset, the cost
of the additional cleaning operations.
Technical men interested in sales
work usually start in a laboratory or
manufacturing plant where t hey can
acquire needed background. Depend
ing on their interest and abilities,
they may then move into technical
sales service, sales development, or
direct sales.
In any of these fields, the man
with the right combination of sales
aptitude and technical knowledge
will find interesting work, and excep
tional opportunities for growth in the
Du Pont Company.
