The usually quiet atmosphere at the Leland Stanford Junior
Museum has changed. Now the sounds of hammers and spray
painting machines fill the air as workmen renovate and prepare
the museum for its first public opening in nine years.
The museum has been closed to the public since the end of

the war. According to Mrs. Helen
Cross, the associate director of the
Art Ciallery, it will open sometime
in April.
Previously, the museum has not
been well organized for display pur
poses. "There were too many items
on display," Mrs. Cross said, "and
the cases and lighting were poor."
The old cases have been thrown
away, for it was found to be more
expensive to renovate them than to
build new ones. Another of the
problems, that of lighting, will be
solved by eliminating natural light.
"We have always had trouble
from natural lighting," Mrs. Cross
said. "It faded our displays and
caused glares. From now on, we
will have one of the area's most
modern museums, featuring indi
rect lighting."
The University has appropriated
$28,000 for the renovation. Included
in the work is repainting the entire
museum, patching cracks in the
walls, installing 30 new display cab
inets, installing new lighting, wir
ing the museum for new electric
services, cutting fire escape exits on
the first and second floors, and re
labeling the exhibits.
Approximately 35,000 objects are
stored in the museum, although
only a small fraction are on display.
Behind the history of tlie museum
lies an interesting story. The Stan
fords were collectors of art objects,
and when Leland Jr. died, they de
cided to erect a museum in San
Francisco in his name.
Later they changed their minds,
however, and instead decided to
u>e the funds earmarked for a
museum to construct a university
—Stanford University. The couple
did C|{ree that a part of this mon
ey going into construction of a
university should lie used to huild
a private museum.
As a result, Stanford had the
largest privately endowed museum
in the world until two wings col
lapsed during the earthquake of
1906.
When the museum reopens, it will
be divided into periods. The rooms
include: Egyptian, Classical Greek,
European Art, Oriental Art, Histor
ical, and the Stanford Room. An
other feature will be a display of
pioneer furniture in the Braly col
lection.
There will be no admission charge
for students when the museum is
opened to the public.
Construction is being done by a
private contractor, and the painting
and plastering by the Corporation
Yard.
