### BILL WRIGHT 
Canon Bryan Green told the Stanford Convocation F"day
morning that 'Personality it> the teal creative force in the uni
verse.' But he didn't ';ay you liad to believe it.
Rathei. he uaid that to be .a wholr peison—an integrated per
son you niuyt believe 111 an ultimate powei, whether it be a

persona! or impersonal I'>l co.
The famed English •Minister, who
is official chaplain ot Birmingham,
spoke on the general theme of
ligion and the Modern Mind
Stanford students crowded Me
morial Auditorium and overflowed
into the Little Theatei to hear Can
on Gieen address the University'
first Convocation in foui years. Six
hundred were turned away
President J. Iv Wallace Slcrlinc.
as he introduced Canon Green,
called Ihc audience "the largest
student audience in this audito
rium that I have cvei .rrn
Green emphasized m his talk that
"'the only way you ' an get any con
viction about reality is to assemble
the data of youi experience and
from those data make a hypothesis
about the ultimate ''
"Anyone who is serious about
reality has a hypothesis," he added.
"And it is only a hypothesis
"I don't agree with my Knnian
Catholic brethren thai we can
prove God," he stated
But he did think a serious at
tempt at understanding reality
would show that there is something
personal—not just "motion - of mat
ter"—as the ultimate in the uni
verse. "It may or may nut be true,
but intelligent men have held it."
Green said lie could respect an
atheist, who think'- that 'behind this
world there is sm'iply an impersonal
force." He explained, I want him
to see my bypothrsis, but intellec
tually I must acknowledge hi.',
However, he was explicit in de
nouncing K'ose who arc 'glibly
orthodox" about 'religion They've
never questioned it, nevrt fought
about it. nevn hammered i< out."
"Some simply use it as an antidote
to Communism," Green said. "I
don't recomnienH Christianity as an
antidote to Communism."
"And I don't recommend it as an
antidote for youi nasty little
he continued, "And tlicv are little
sins! Most of us haven't enough ad
venture to be really big inner:,
"!f I see reality, whether as ?i
personal or an impersonal forrp,
it must dominate my life," Green
tyent on. "From this .von must
make a hypothesis about life it
self."
"And once I have my hypothesis,
I must be dedicated to it," Canon
Green said in conclusion, ''otherwise
1 am not. worthy ol respect."
