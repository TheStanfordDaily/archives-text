a lack ol held goals with a bar
tagp ol '}?. foul shots to gain a
split with a rugged USC team in
flip Pavilion Friday and Satur
day nights. The Cards dropped
the' first contest, 57-53, but
bounced back to gam a 72-67
verdict. *
The script was practically the
same toi both Stanford games, only
the ioles weie changed. Tl\e Tro
jan defense, which dropped three
men on Russ Lawler every time he
got the ball, completely shackled the
Indian scoring ace Friday night as
the big center only got eight points.
The ensuing evening, however,
this defense was Troy's undoing as
the key men, attempting to con
tain Lawler, fouled out of the game.
The result was that Lawler meshed
1L- out of 14 foul attempts and
walked otT the court with game
scoring honors at 24 'the team hit
on 32 out of 42 charity tries and
therein lies the story of the Car
dinal victory.

foot 5' .•-inch center ripped the
cords for 18 and 15 points on' suc
ceeding nights and almost led the

twice in the first minute of the sec
ond half, fouling himself out of the
game. This was an indication of
tilings to come. After grabbing the

and expanding it 42-39 on a Suzda

Stanford's eagers made up !ot
a lack ol held goals with a bar
tagp ol '}?. foul shots to gain a
split with a rugged USC team in
flip Pavilion Friday and Satur
day nights. The Cards dropped
the' first contest, 57-53, but
bounced back to gam a 72-67
verdict. *
The script was practically the
same toi both Stanford games, only
the ioles weie changed. Tl\e Tro
jan defense, which dropped three
men on Russ Lawler every time he
got the ball, completely shackled the
Indian scoring ace Friday night as
the big center only got eight points.
The ensuing evening, however,
this defense was Troy's undoing as
the key men, attempting to con
tain Lawler, fouled out of the game.
The result was that Lawler meshed
1L- out of 14 foul attempts and
walked otT the court with game
scoring honors at 24 'the team hit
on 32 out of 42 charity tries and
therein lies the story of the Car
dinal victory.
But it was a hard-earned vic
t"i y, aj, S('s Roy !rvin. Dick
Hammer, and Dick Welsh were
• ibr cause of much misery both
nights l» viu. with his fierce de
leo-.ivp uoih and devastating left
handed hook shots, was !bp key
performer on !hf court The 15-
foot 5' .•-inch center ripped the
cords for 18 and 15 points on' suc
ceeding nights and almost led the
Trojans to a twin killing
The Saturday night tussle saw the
lead change hands nine times and
the game tied 13 times. The Cards
managed a 20-19 fust-quarter ad
vantage But Troy. 1 idiilg with the
accurate set shots of Tony Fsaltis
and Hammer, captured a 3G-35 in
termission lead
Psaltis. however, fouled Lawler
twice in the first minute of the sec
ond half, fouling himself out of the
game. This was an indication of
tilings to come. After grabbing the
lead 39-38 on a Lawler charity toss
and expanding it 42-39 on a Suzda
leO pop - shot, the Trojans caught
j fire and moved away 51 to 44
II was flip beginning of thr end,
however, as Coacli Bob Burnett
i inserted peppy Ron Wagner, Leo
j and Bill Turner to rest
| DeLong, Lawler, and Suzdalrfl.
j Thr new life paid nfl' as Turner,
