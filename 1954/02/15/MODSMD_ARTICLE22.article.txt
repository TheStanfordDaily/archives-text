# A 						View of McCarthy
## 
### 
Last Wednesday night we saw and heard
Senator Joseph McCarthy in person.
After hearing his voice and the applause of
the crowd, after seeing his gestures and the
laces of his listeners, after watching the whole
performance of speaker and audience, we felt
that we had a greater understanding of Mc-
Carthy and McCarthyism than could ever be
derived from press accounts or even radio
and TV.
These were our conclusions:
1. McCarthy's appeal is not based or\\-fon
a play on emotions and a manipulation of
fear. However false his logic might be. how
ever perverted the reasoning power of his au
dience, McCarthy unguestionably uses
"logic" to appeal to "reason."
2. He is relatively successful in that effort.
The audience at last Wednesday's address in
Sari Mateo's Fiesta Building was not wildly
hysterical, nor was it indifferently curious.

Generally, we believe that the members ol
that audience who indicated approval of Mc-
Carthy did so with calm and rational ap
plause. We believe that a good half of the
audience felt sincere and "rational" approval
of the man and his comments.
That is the picture, those are the conclu
sions we perceived after seeing and hearing
McCarthy and his audience. Admittedly, it is
only one picture out of many and McCarthy's
speech was only one out of many and
Wednesday's audience was only one out ol
many. But if the picture we caught is gener
ally true, if the conclusions we reached are
generally valid, we would fear McCarthy and
his "ism" far more than we did when wp
thought in terms of "hysteria" and "emotion."
We would no longer chuckle over the ab
surdities of his logic and his charges.
We would be seriously worried over the
temper and direction of McCarthy and Amer
ica.
