# Give Us Both Sides

### 
In the past week several top administration
leaders, including President Eisenhower,
have expressed severe criticism of Demo
cratic leaders who are calling lor increased
qovernment action to prevent recession.
Sample comments:
From President Eisenhower, "We don't
have to listen to the prophets of gloom who
say we are going to go into a kind of stumble
or fumble or fall."
From Republican Chairman Leonard W.
Hall, "I sometimes wonder whose interests
the left-wingers think they are serving by
their incessant talk of slump, recession, and
depression."
From White House Chief of Staff Sherman
Adams, "The attempt by these political sad
ists ... to talk this country into a depression
(is a) perniciously evil device (for) attempting
lo destroy the confidence of the people in our
Government. It should be recognized (as) the
'fear deal'."
We realize there is a partisan difference of
opinion on the question of whether or not a
major recession is coming this year.
The Republican policy, as evidenced in
President Eisenhower's Economic Report to
Congress, is to deter recession by encourag
ing increased business and consumer spend
ing before throwing government resources
into the breach.
Democrats like Adlai Stevenson and Paul

Douglas believe that the government should
act immediately before recession has a
chance to spiral.
Republicans fear that Democratic warnings
will increase the chances for recession by
alarming consumers and encouraging them
to hang on to money which they should be
pouring back into the economy.
Democrats fear that* Republican assurances
will worsen recession by luring the public
into a complacent acceptance of government in
action.
Our first reaction to all this is that an issue
as important as the possibility of
should not be a partisan concern. A second
thought leaves us believing that the basically
different economic philosophies of the two
parties make this partisan debate inevitable.
It seems to us that both points of view can
be argued validly. We would like to hear
more detailed explanations from both Repub
licans and Democrats as to why they are pro
pounding their particular policies.
And so we resent Republican charges that
Democratic warnings represent a selfish at
tempt to gain power through a" "fear deal." In
any difference of opinion, each side has an
obligation to present its arguments as clearly
and often as possible, however irritating those
arguments may fc>e to those who hold the op
posite point of view.
