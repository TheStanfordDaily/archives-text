# A 						New Policy
## 
### 
Beginning today, The Daily is exercising a
new policy in the presentation of editorials.
All editorials will be unsigned, unless there
exists a strong and definite disagreement be
tween the members of the Editorial Board on
the opinion or interpretation expressed. When
such an editorial is published, it will be fol
lowed by the name of the writer. In that
form, it will not represent an editorial view of
The Daily itself.
Generally, we feel that there will be little
need for "signed editorials." Although the
present members of the Daily Editorial Board
(Editor, Managing Editor, Staff Editor, Asso
ciate Editors) represent different viewpoints

on local, national, and international issues, we
are fortunate in sharing essential beliefs and
attitudes which will determine The Daily's
editorial expression. Those views will be fur
ther conditioned by a consideration of the views
of the whole staff.
Inevitably, the opinions expressed will be
questioned by some readers. We welcome
any comment on those opinions, or indeed
any situation, through the Campus Opinion
column. Our ultimate purpose is to encour
age the expression and exchange of as many
ideas as possible. This, we sincerely believe,
is one of our major responsibilities in this
community.
