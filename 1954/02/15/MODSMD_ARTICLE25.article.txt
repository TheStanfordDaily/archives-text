# BULL SESSION
## FLORA AND FAUNA OF OUR FAIR UNIVERSITY: I 
### JACK BYRNE 
Today, devoted reader, let us discuss some of the
nimals inhabiting this territory, particularly those
vho live in the outstanding campus eyesore, Wood
pecker Lodge.
This noble edifice stands, or more eorrpctlv. leans.

n that area behind the Quad
)ffice, the Stanford Chaparral,
ind some minor outfit known as
fie lIR. Here in Woodpecker is
loused impedimenta of the Mu
ic Department, and some obsure
igency of the University which
cems to be concerned with the
iddressing of letters. Our ex
•ellent and little recognized sym
>liony orchestra, ditto the chorus,
neets in rehearsal here.

The band house has its bees, but tnis building is
n no way so severely limited. In its dirty white in
erior we have not only bees, but mice, owls, pre
umably bats, and Lord knows what else.
The bees swarmed last spring, and died exquisitely
n the process. Being attracted to the lights like
noths, tftey penetrated the insides of the fixtures,
ind roasted there. There is still about a quart of
emains inside one of the globes to tell the story of
hat sad day. The only redeeming feature to offset
he two-inch layer of corpses on the floor was the
lelightful odor of honey which permeated the area
or two days.
Mice occasionally make themselves seen. One
was in the habit of sitting in on bass section re
hearsal at the symphony. Another adventurous soul
look a stroll through the rehearsal one day, and was
loing just fine when he wandered into the first

violin section, predominately female, and approached
the concertrnistress.
"Eek!" quoth she, in the best comic strip style.
"Awk!" quoth director Salgo, and at the same time
began seeking cover, assistance, or other comfort.
A most edifying experience for all parties concerned,
save the mouse.
Then there are the Mad Owls of Woodpecker
Lodge. This duo lives in the rafters, soaking up cul
ture while listening to rehearsals. Orchestra librarian
Ed Forner constantly threatens them with annihila
tion, manager Turner Bledsoe appeals to the Music
Department that we must either have rain coats or
another unit credit, and Dr. Salgo just turns white
when the subject is mentioned. The floor bears elo
quent testimony to the presence of these birds.
If we don't have a bat or six in the building, it's
high time that a few were imported. Consider the
success of the Bach Bat in Carmel. This creature lives
in the rafters of the Sunset School Auditorium in that
colorful town. There he stays the majority of the
year. But come the annual Bach Festival, he swoops j
down on the orchestra and soloist, circling heads, and
generally enjoying himself immensely. This aristo
crat among bats seems to have an affinity for Bach,
which I suppose makes him more cultured than
yours truly.
I suppose there are other living things in Wood
pecker For instance, there must be termites, as the
diagonal posture of the building will show. One look
at the tower will convince the most dubious Thomas
that Woodpeckers did or still frequent the area; it
has the general texture of a sieve. Spiders leave thuir
webs all over the place, but the janitors don't seem
to care.
And let us not forget the culture vulture, who
shows up at almost any rehearsal, whether invited
01 not

quent testimony to the presence of these birds.
If we don't have a bat or six in the building, it's
high time that a few were imported. Consider the
success of the Bach Bat in Carmel. This creature lives
in the rafters of the Sunset School Auditorium in that
colorful town. There he stays the majority of the
year. But come the annual Bach Festival, he swoops j
down on the orchestra and soloist, circling heads, and
generally enjoying himself immensely. This aristo
crat among bats seems to have an affinity for Bach,
which I suppose makes him more cultured than
yours truly.
I suppose there are other living things in Wood
pecker For instance, there must be termites, as the
diagonal posture of the building will show. One look
at the tower will convince the most dubious Thomas
that Woodpeckers did or still frequent the area; it
has the general texture of a sieve. Spiders leave thuir
webs all over the place, but the janitors don't seem
to care.
And let us not forget the culture vulture, who
shows up at almost any rehearsal, whether invited
01 not

Today, devoted reader, let us discuss some of the
nimals inhabiting this territory, particularly those
vho live in the outstanding campus eyesore, Wood
pecker Lodge.
This noble edifice stands, or more eorrpctlv. leans.

n that area behind the Quad
)ffice, the Stanford Chaparral,
ind some minor outfit known as
fie lIR. Here in Woodpecker is
loused impedimenta of the Mu
ic Department, and some obsure
igency of the University which
cems to be concerned with the
iddressing of letters. Our ex
•ellent and little recognized sym
>liony orchestra, ditto the chorus,
neets in rehearsal here.

The band house has its bees, but tnis building is
n no way so severely limited. In its dirty white in
erior we have not only bees, but mice, owls, pre
umably bats, and Lord knows what else.
The bees swarmed last spring, and died exquisitely
n the process. Being attracted to the lights like
noths, tftey penetrated the insides of the fixtures,
ind roasted there. There is still about a quart of
emains inside one of the globes to tell the story of
hat sad day. The only redeeming feature to offset
he two-inch layer of corpses on the floor was the
lelightful odor of honey which permeated the area
or two days.
Mice occasionally make themselves seen. One
was in the habit of sitting in on bass section re
hearsal at the symphony. Another adventurous soul
look a stroll through the rehearsal one day, and was
loing just fine when he wandered into the first

violin section, predominately female, and approached
the concertrnistress.
"Eek!" quoth she, in the best comic strip style.
"Awk!" quoth director Salgo, and at the same time
began seeking cover, assistance, or other comfort.
A most edifying experience for all parties concerned,
save the mouse.
Then there are the Mad Owls of Woodpecker
Lodge. This duo lives in the rafters, soaking up cul
ture while listening to rehearsals. Orchestra librarian
Ed Forner constantly threatens them with annihila
tion, manager Turner Bledsoe appeals to the Music
Department that we must either have rain coats or
another unit credit, and Dr. Salgo just turns white
when the subject is mentioned. The floor bears elo
quent testimony to the presence of these birds.
