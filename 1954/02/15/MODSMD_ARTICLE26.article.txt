CAGE FAN—The Rev. Bryan Green, famed English clergy
man who has held crowds spellbound by his talks, becomes a
part of the crowd himself as he visits Saturday night's basket
ball game between Stanford and Southern California. Though
basketball is played all over the world, the
ice cream bar is strictly American. Though it's uncertain what
the effect of Green's visit to the game was to the players, they
won their first league game in five weeks that night, 72-67.
