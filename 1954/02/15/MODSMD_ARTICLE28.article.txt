# Mystery Explained

### 
WHAT IS IT?—Students spotting
this red garbage can on wheels,
with a couple of stove-pipes at
tached, have labeled it as heintf
everything from a giant ash tray
to a collector for waste products
of an atomic pile.
The Engineering Department,
which is playing host to the mys
terious device, broke up the mys
tery when they identified it as
being a separator for diesel fuel
from vaporized oil.
On the other end of the pipe
leading into the labs is a tester
for diesel injectors, allowing the
engineers to see the individuaf
droplets of the fuel vapor.
