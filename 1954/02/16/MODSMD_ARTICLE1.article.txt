## Christianity— Delusion or Insight? 'Informal' Discussion 
### SUE WHEAT 
"Is Christ the unique and final expression of reality in a human
life?"
This was the question considered by Canon Bryan Green before
a capacity audience in Memorial Auditorium last night as he de-

livered the first in a series of four |
lectures on ''Basic Christianity."
"I hope at the end of my lecture J
the audience will be sharply divid- ,
ed," he said. For in Christ one:
"meets reality in such a way that j
you have to accept or reject it."
On the hypothesis of a personal ;
God, Green built another hypothe
sis: that a personal God can be self- ,
revealing.
Christianity, he said, claims that!
God has made His revelation in the j
human life of Jesus Christ.
"Is this true? Is Jesus Christ
God?" he asked.
"You can't find out if it's true,
you can only assemble the data, j
The number of people listening
tonight who have never assembled
the data is quite considerable,"
he said.
In examining the data on Christ,
personality upon its authors.
"I can't protend that there are not
mistakes and discrepancies in the j
New Testament," he said. But in
spite of this, its writers agree on one i
thing: the impact of the personality
of Jesus Christ which they found j
"profoundly disturbing."
"They couldn't explain Him and j
they couldn't explain Him away." j
Green listed six impressions of
Christ upon the writers of the
New Testament which demon
strate Christianity's claim that
God has revealed Himself in
Christ:
1) That Christ spoke with moral
and spiritual authority. Green cited
Christ's contradiction of the Old
Testament such as replacing "an eye
for an eye," with the rule "love thy
enemies."
2) That, Christ had no sense of
"moral disharmony." He never said
" 'sorry' to man or God." He lived
as if in Him, "the ideal and the real
were one."
3) That Christ put Himself in
the center of the religious pic
ture. He didn't say,"Go to God,"
but rather, "Come to Me."
4) That Christ talked as if He
knew the eternal world. "1 and the
Father are one." "Before Abraham
was, I am."
5) That Christ put an emphasis on
His death. He said that it was going
to make possible God's forgiveness.

(J) That Christ rose from the dead.
"This is the dala," Green said,
"and fronj it you can make two
hypotheses. Either you come to
the conclusion of the friends of
Jesus, that here is the Word made
flesh, or you must accept Christ
as a raving maniac, a self-de
luded man who thought he was
God and deluded the whole world
with his hoax."
"I cannot believe that Christi
anity is a faith of millions of deluded

persons—a faith based on the rav
ings of a megalomaniac."
Green said that if one accepts the
first hypothesis, that Christ is the
expression of a personal theistic
power, 'he discovers three things
about reality:
1) A new dignity for man.
2) A total and exclusive claim of
Christianity upon the individual.
3) A "shattering view of reality"
which really reveals k as "goodness
that suffers because it loves."

was, I am."

His death. He said that it was going

(J) That Christ rose from the dead.
"This is the dala," Green said,
"and fronj it you can make two
hypotheses. Either you come to
the conclusion of the friends of
Jesus, that here is the Word made
flesh, or you must accept Christ
as a raving maniac, a self-de
luded man who thought he was
God and deluded the whole world
with his hoax."
"I cannot believe that Christi
anity is a faith of millions of deluded

persons—a faith based on the rav
ings of a megalomaniac."
Green said that if one accepts the
first hypothesis, that Christ is the
expression of a personal theistic
power, 'he discovers three things
about reality:
1) A new dignity for man.
2) A total and exclusive claim of
Christianity upon the individual.
3) A "shattering view of reality"
which really reveals k as "goodness
that suffers because it loves."

"Is Christ the unique and final expression of reality in a human
life?"
This was the question considered by Canon Bryan Green before
a capacity audience in Memorial Auditorium last night as he de-

livered the first in a series of four |
lectures on ''Basic Christianity."
"I hope at the end of my lecture J
the audience will be sharply divid- ,
ed," he said. For in Christ one:
"meets reality in such a way that j
you have to accept or reject it."
On the hypothesis of a personal ;
God, Green built another hypothe
sis: that a personal God can be self- ,
revealing.
Christianity, he said, claims that!
God has made His revelation in the j
human life of Jesus Christ.
"Is this true? Is Jesus Christ
God?" he asked.
"You can't find out if it's true,
you can only assemble the data, j
The number of people listening
tonight who have never assembled
the data is quite considerable,"
he said.
In examining the data on Christ,
personality upon its authors.
"I can't protend that there are not
mistakes and discrepancies in the j
New Testament," he said. But in
spite of this, its writers agree on one i
thing: the impact of the personality
of Jesus Christ which they found j
"profoundly disturbing."
"They couldn't explain Him and j
they couldn't explain Him away." j
Green listed six impressions of
Christ upon the writers of the
New Testament which demon
strate Christianity's claim that
God has revealed Himself in
Christ:
1) That Christ spoke with moral
and spiritual authority. Green cited
Christ's contradiction of the Old
Testament such as replacing "an eye
for an eye," with the rule "love thy
enemies."
2) That, Christ had no sense of
"moral disharmony." He never said
" 'sorry' to man or God." He lived
as if in Him, "the ideal and the real
were one."
3) That Christ put Himself in
the center of the religious pic
ture. He didn't say,"Go to God,"
but rather, "Come to Me."
4) That Christ talked as if He
knew the eternal world. "1 and the
Father are one." "Before Abraham
was, I am."
5) That Christ put an emphasis on
His death. He said that it was going
to make possible God's forgiveness.

(J) That Christ rose from the dead.
