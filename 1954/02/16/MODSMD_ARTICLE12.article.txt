Stanford University's big electron
linear accelerator has accelerated
electrons to 595 million electron
volts, the highest energy yet
achieved by man for electrons, it
was announced recently. Further
increases are expected in the near
future.
The Stanford machine was con
ceived by the late Professor W. W.
Hansen, who also participated in the
invention and development of the
klystron, the powerful vacuum-ra
dio tube which powei-s the accelera
tor.
The accelerator was built and is
operated under a contract with the
Office of Naval Research as part of
the joint program of the ONR and
the Atomic Energy Commission for
research in nuclear physics.
The previous high mark for elec
trons was 520 million electron volts,
set by the electron synchrotron at
the California Institute of Technol
ogy.
