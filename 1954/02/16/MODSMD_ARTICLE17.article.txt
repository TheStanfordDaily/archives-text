SEOUL, Feb. 15 (UP)â€”U.S. Eighth Army Commander Gen. Max
well D. Taylor said today that the Communists still have an esti
mated 1,000,000-man army in North Korea and are "doing every
thing they can to strengthen their position."
Taylor told a press conference the Chinese and North Korean

Reds "are training very actively and"
the Communist threat still is with
us."
He said that some Communist
troops may have been withdrawn
from the front for rear area train
ing, but actually the Reds have
made "no essential change" in their
ground strength since the truce was
signed nearly seven months ago.
The Eighth Army, Taylor said, is
being used as a "laboratory" to test
new weapons, but he did not elabo
rate.
The general said he was not
consulted on the South Korean
offer to send an infantry division
to aid the French in their fight
against the Reds in Indochina.
"Any field commander does not
like to lose forces," Taylor said. But
he conceded the South Korean offer,
which was rejected by the French,
was a "governmental question" and
out of his province.

He alsa said lie had no indica
tions that personnel from his
Eighth Army would he sent to
Indochina to join U.S. Air Force
technicians there.
Taylor told the press conference
that the newly created South Ko
rean First Army, with its 18 divi
sions, still would be subordinated to
the Eighth Army.
