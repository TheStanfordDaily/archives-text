# Sign-ups for Blood Donations Being Taken All This Week
## 
### 
Appointment by mail—that's the system for blood drive sign
ups being used for the first time this year. The blood drives will
be held Feb. 25-26, April 21-22-23, and May 20-21. Sign-ups for
all three drives of students who wish to donate blood in any of
these coming drives are being taken all this week.

Here's how the appointment-by- <
mail system works:
J. Students obtain appointment
ment cards from living group repre
sentatives or from tables in front of
the Cellar and Main Libe.
2. They till in these cards stating
the hours they are available to do
nate during all three drives, and
return the card to their living group
representative or to the boxes by
the Cellar and Main Lihe.
3. The blood drive workers gather
the cards, correlate the requests,
and devise a master - appointment
sheet.
\ Students arc notified by mail
of their confirmed appointment date
within 10 days of the date.
Ken Schcchter, co-chairman of
the drive, has requested that stu
dents, when possible, return their
appointment request cards to their
living group representatives rath
er than to the boxes on Quad.
Appointments will be made for
15-minute periods from 8:30 a.m. to
4 p.m. on the dates of the drives. •
Over 100 students, counting the
representatives in each campus liv
ing group, are working on this
year's blood drives. Persons inter
ested in working arc asked to con
tact Schechter or Fred Stern at the
Cardinal's office, where committee
members arc keeping office hours
from 2 to 5:30 p.m. this week.
