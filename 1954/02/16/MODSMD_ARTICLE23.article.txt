Chairman George D. Aiken (R.,
Vt.) of the Senate Agriculture
Committee supported (he action,
while Sen. Clinton P. Anderson
(I)., N.M.) called it "a very good
step in the right direction . .
Benson announced at a news con
ference that government price sup
ports on butter, cheese, and driec!
milk will drop from 90 per cent of
the so-called "fair price" parity to
75 per cent April 1.
He said dollars-and-cents support
levels will be announced later, but
"housewives can count on about an
8-cent-a-pound drop in butter."

be able to announce "before too
long" a plan to dispose of some of
the more than $350,000,000 worth of
