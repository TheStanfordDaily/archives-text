# To Help the Class of '58

### 
Tryouts for membership on next year's ASSU
pre-registration committee will be conducted
this afternoon in the Excom room from 1 to 4.
We extend this reminder because we are
aware of the importance of the work of that
committee and its need for students who could
iidd to the effectiveness of the freshman pre
iregistration program.
Briefly, that program is designed as an orien
! jlion of new students to life at Stanford. Mem
b'-rr. of the committee ai# responsible for send
ing information to freshmen before their arrival
on campus, conducting tours of the campus
ftor their arrival, and answering any and all
ie r itions which freshmen might ask of their
now home and life.

The purpose and the importance of the pre
registration committee are clear. The first few
days at Stanford can be overwhelming and
confusing to the new student. Definite attitudes
and understandings of Stanford are set during
those days. It is the job of the pre-registration
committee and its members to clarify the con
fusion of those first days and to enable the new
student to understand the implications of Stan
ford in its relation to each student.
We do not normally recommend any specific
activity for students' participation, but we can
not help but commend the work and worth of
the pre-registration committee to any student
who wishes-to serve Stanford and its student
program.
