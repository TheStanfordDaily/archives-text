There is rio sight sadder than an Eating Club man
trying to cook for himself. Perhaps the sight of an
mating club man trying to cook for other eating club
men is sadder, especially to the other eating club
men, but the mere sight of an eating club man with

frying pan in hand is enough to
make strong men weep and
hi alth inspectors shudder.
Each freshman rushing sea
:.<>n the new class hears how
vmderful the food is at an eat
ifi• club. That's what the eating
club is for: good food! And the
loud is good, as long as the cook
'•ooks it. But cooks get days off
il l then it's ptomaine time. Es
l« < i.illy late in the quarter when

I ho bank balance is low and the members can't af-
I'>i <I to go out somewhere and buy a wholesome din
ner, like two hamburgers and some potato chips.
The clubman's diet, when self-imposed, would re
pulse a goat. Not that clubmen would eat tin cans,
but they rely heavily on things which come in tin
< ans, like beans. The average clubman has also found
that any fool, given a flame, can (1) boil water,
(2) fry bacon, and (3) make toast.
And everyone, fool or not, is convinced he can
cook eggs, although notes submitted to this de
partment indicate that only three living persons, all
t/.( iiiuses, can actually cook eggs. They are all in
the employ of the Houston Chamber of Commerce
and cook their eggs on the city streets at high noon
July 15. But enough digression.
The problem of finance eliminates bacon from the
clubman's diet. Highly complex modern toasters which
instantly turn bread into charcoal have discouraged
toast-eaters.
But as long as canneries continue to can beans, and
coffee thrown into boiling water can be drunk as
well as used to dissolve paint, and eating clubmen
continue under the impression that they can cook

eggs, eating clubmen will eat. And probably be sick
later.
It's the attempts to vary this simple diet (eggs
for breakfast, scraps for lunch, beans for dinner)
that throws the aspiring chef for a loss. No reason
why it should—the recipes for almost all clubman
creations are fairly simple. As a matter of fact, they
are almost identical:
Take a frying pan. Grease it thoroughly. Find meat.
Grind up fine. Find onions. Grind up fine. Find po
tatoes. Cut. up fine. Season heavily. Fry until it
smokes. Stir. Fry some more.
There's the basic recipe. From this develops a
whole series of eating club delicacies:
I. STEW.
Add water, flour, more spices, fruit juice, etc.
serves thirty.
11. SHEPHERD'S PIE
Pour in one half box Krustease, stir until thick
(i.e., until it starts to smoke).
111. SOUP
Start out as in stew, but inadvertently add too
much water, fruit juice, etc.
IV.HASH
Cook until it starts to smoke, then let it smoke until
dried out. Add ketchup.
V. TAMALKS (or any other Mexican food which
suits your fancy)
Add much, much more spice.
VI. C.UK FLAMBANT
A dish originated by a couple of Row houses,
featuring that Continental flavor:
Add grease. Add more grease. Add still more
grease. At this point the creation is likely to burst
into flame. The Guk Flambant par excellence will
burn with a blue flame—this is the criterion to
strive for. Meanwhile, summon the fire department.
And, since this is, after all, the fate of most eating
club Original Creations, keep a can of beans handy.
Or scrape out the frying pan and have a go at cook
ing an egg.

But as long as canneries continue to can beans, and
coffee thrown into boiling water can be drunk as
well as used to dissolve paint, and eating clubmen
continue under the impression that they can cook

eggs, eating clubmen will eat. And probably be sick
later.
It's the attempts to vary this simple diet (eggs
for breakfast, scraps for lunch, beans for dinner)
that throws the aspiring chef for a loss. No reason
why it should—the recipes for almost all clubman
creations are fairly simple. As a matter of fact, they
are almost identical:
Take a frying pan. Grease it thoroughly. Find meat.
Grind up fine. Find onions. Grind up fine. Find po
tatoes. Cut. up fine. Season heavily. Fry until it
smokes. Stir. Fry some more.
There's the basic recipe. From this develops a
whole series of eating club delicacies:
I. STEW.
Add water, flour, more spices, fruit juice, etc.
serves thirty.
11. SHEPHERD'S PIE
Pour in one half box Krustease, stir until thick
(i.e., until it starts to smoke).
111. SOUP
Start out as in stew, but inadvertently add too
much water, fruit juice, etc.
IV.HASH
Cook until it starts to smoke, then let it smoke until
dried out. Add ketchup.
V. TAMALKS (or any other Mexican food which
suits your fancy)
Add much, much more spice.
VI. C.UK FLAMBANT
A dish originated by a couple of Row houses,
featuring that Continental flavor:
Add grease. Add more grease. Add still more
grease. At this point the creation is likely to burst
into flame. The Guk Flambant par excellence will
burn with a blue flame—this is the criterion to
strive for. Meanwhile, summon the fire department.
And, since this is, after all, the fate of most eating
club Original Creations, keep a can of beans handy.
Or scrape out the frying pan and have a go at cook
ing an egg.

There is rio sight sadder than an Eating Club man
trying to cook for himself. Perhaps the sight of an
mating club man trying to cook for other eating club
men is sadder, especially to the other eating club
men, but the mere sight of an eating club man with

frying pan in hand is enough to
make strong men weep and
hi alth inspectors shudder.

The clubman's diet, when self-imposed, would re
pulse a goat. Not that clubmen would eat tin cans,
but they rely heavily on things which come in tin
< ans, like beans. The average clubman has also found
that any fool, given a flame, can (1) boil water,
(2) fry bacon, and (3) make toast.
And everyone, fool or not, is convinced he can
cook eggs, although notes submitted to this de
partment indicate that only three living persons, all
t/.( iiiuses, can actually cook eggs. They are all in
the employ of the Houston Chamber of Commerce
and cook their eggs on the city streets at high noon
July 15. But enough digression.
The problem of finance eliminates bacon from the

toast-eaters.
