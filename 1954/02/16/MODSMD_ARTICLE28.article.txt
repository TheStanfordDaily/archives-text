# CAMPUS OPINION
## Suggestion for the Flicks 
### 
To Ihe Editor:
It seems that a number of petitions are going
around seeking to remedy what appears to be a
i loss injustice: the removal of serials from the diet
of Stanford moviegoers. Now, it is refreshing to see
pirited petitioners circulating among the students
• i<re on the Stanford campus. Stimulating djscus
■ ions and debates on controversial issues have always
formed the backbone of great universities.
If anyone doubts that the current campus Sunday
evening movie fare this year is well-balanced and

relatively excellent, let him wander into one of the
commercial houses and see a class Band class Z
double-feature bill sandwiched between Chronicle
and Chrysler ads at 90 cents per. Or let him judge the
merits of a Rank drama followed by a rank Warner
morontoon.
May I suggest that, if the Movie Committee con
siders these petitions seriously, a simple ballot poll
be taken at a Sunday showing to see if the audience
would really prefer substitutions or extensions in
the program, or the type suggested.
