# Placement Service Requests That Students Register Soon
## 
### SYDNEY LITTLE 
For most of the men in the senior class, the prospect of serving
two years in the armed forces is nearing reality, and consequently
their plans for applying for a permanent job are being postponed.
However, according to Richard O'Brien, Associate Director of
the Placement Service, the future in terms of employment need

not be so indefinite. By registering*
now at the Placement Service, stu
dents are likely to find a position
which will enable them to work
until they arc drafted, with the as- ,
surance that there will be a place
open for them after they have com
pleted their military training.
Under this system of registration, ,
a student is notified about all op- j |
portunities available which might
suit his interests and training. The [ I
service is a life-time one, each rec- j
ord being kept on file in case the
individual wishes to find other em- i j
ployment during later years. Al- i
though a student who has gradu- j
ated may utilize the service, under- (
graduates are urged to apply now I
so that it will be easier to obtain !
the necessary references.
Previously job interviewing was
held only during spring quarter.
However, because it is earlier
this year, O'Brien urges students [
to establish their files now. Last
these, one-third found jobs directly
these, one-third fund jobs directly
through interviews at the Place
ment Service and an additional
one-third found employment as
an indirect result of interviews
Women are also invited to regis- \ 1
ter. Many companies seeking wom
en for secretarial and personnel po-

sitions contact the Placement Serv
ice, and the greater the number of
applicants, the larger is the number
of firms which become interested in
Stanford as a potential source of
future employees.
The total number of companies
which conducted interviews on cam
pus last year was 3(57. An additional
1,470 firms contacted the Placement
Service. O'Brien emphasized that
regardless of statistics on the down
ward'trend of national business op
portunities, the number of contacts
established at Stanford is increas
ing each year, and it is to the stu
dent's advantage to register now at
the Placement Service, Room 1-B,
Inner Quad.
