### BOB DURAND 
A powerful Fort Lewis wrestling squad handed the Stanford
varsity its third defeat of the season by a 24-10 count in the Pa
vilion last night.
The Indians' only points were gained on pins by Bob Fisher
and captain George Russell, who has yet to be defeated in colle-

giate wrestling.
Fisher opened the evening suc
cessfully for the Cards in the 123-
pound class by pinning Frank Walt
jen with a half-nelson and body
press in 1:20 of the second period,
after rolling up a 0-2 lead in points.
Bob Deeds, Fort Lewis 130-
pounder, followed this match with
a 5-0 decision over Bill Tolley, who
also boxes for Stanford. Deeds
gained his points through a take
down, reversal, and predicament.
In the next bout, Russell had a
rough time with stubborn Jack
Naylor before the later saccumbed
to a body press ip 2:34 of the sec
ond period Fort Lewis' 147-pound
er Ray Conrad garnered a fall from
Bob Spenser, also with a body press,
in 2:50 of the first, after Spenser had
almost escaped from his opponent's
hold.
The Indians' Ken James fought
stubbornly all the way in the next
157-pound match before a strong
Tony Zilson gained a 5-3 decision
on two takedowns and an escape.
Jerry DeFreis of Fort Lewis then
made the score IG-10 when he pin
ned the inexperienced Jim Hutch
inson in 1:21 of the second period.
Stanford's Pete Pierce put up a
game battle in the 177-pound bout
before he was overwhelmed by the
smooth-working Jim Ellis, former
Big Ten champion from the Univer
sity of Indiana, who used a cradle
to win in 1:50 of the second frame.
In the final match of the evening,

Fort Lewis' heavyweight gained a
quick 4-2 lead on a takedown and
a reversal and then stalled out the
futile efforts of the Cards' Carl Hul
lick to work a pin won the
decision.
