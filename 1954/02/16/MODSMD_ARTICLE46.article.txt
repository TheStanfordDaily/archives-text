# Chaparral Staff Works Hard to Produce Tomorrow's Edition
## A 						Daily Photofeature

That time of the month is here
again.
Tomorrow, corners of Quad will
have card tables on them with
swarms of students g a th e r e d
around. The center of attention will
he the February issue of the Stan
ford Chaparral, Stanford's humor
magazine.
Each month the magazine is pub
lished and sells for 30 cents. Origi
nally, a thin publication selling for
just 15 cents appeared mysteriously
on campus and was sold quietly.
Three times since then there has
been a suspension of publication
"for personal reasons between the
editor and the Dean of Students."
At a time when most things con
nected with the University are hav
ing financial troubles, the Chappie

jis still breaking even. In fact, a
trust fund has been set up for
building a new Chappie office.
Editor of the present Chappie is
! A 1 Ambler, who denies that "Chap
pie editors have had a tradition of
bemg slightly insane." This theory,
he says, probably comes from the
weird pictures appearing in the
I Quad each year.
The Chappie is not sponsored or
I subsidized in any way by the ASSU.
j It is owned by the Hammer and
Coffin Society. Membership in the
| society is open to anyone who has
worked on the Chappie for two con-
I secutive quarters.
The main subject of the Chappie
| is the "Old tloy," who pokes fun at
j all "sophisticated" students on cam-
I pus


THE RECORD This is just a small portion of the walls of the Chaparral office, on which are
pasted covers of all Chappie issues. The recent issues are shown in the center, with tomorrow's
covcr I( iturinq the dancing men. Membership in the Hammer and Coffin Society is open to any
one woil-incj on Ihe magazine for two consecutive quarters. The Chappie has been suspended
on three different occasions since it started. Tomortow's magazine is called "Our Forefathers
Issue," c" d features stories on Washington and Lincoln.


MAKING READY—Three .staff members of the Chaparral prepare the copy and makeup dum
mies for this month's Chappie. Left to right are Tom Timberlake, A 1 Hayes, and A 1 Ambler.
Timberlake is the magazine's managing editor, Hayes is one of the associate editors, and Am
bler is the editor. According to the staff members, a great deal more work is put into the mag
azine than most people suspect: collecting and selecting jokes, drawing the pictures, writing
the stories, and arranging for the printing.


SMILE, PLEASE—Chaparral photographers take pictures of an
auto parked on the edge of Lake Lagunita. Mack Farmer is the
man in the sailor suit sitting with Harriet Bauman. Hal Tracy
and A 1 Riordan are the photographers. Chappie cameramen go
to a wide variety of places to take pictures for the magazine


TOUCHING UP—Editor A 1 Ambler touches up a cartoon which will appear in tomorrow's Chap
pie. The magazine has been publishing since 1 899, when Bristow Adams originated it. A num
ber of prominent people have helped publish th e Chappie. Governor Goodwin Knight was once
a managing editor, and Barney "Showboat" Gould a lormer editor.


THE MASTHEAD—Chaparral workers examine the "masthead," which names all of the staff
workers. Only 35 people take part in publishing any single issue of the magazine. The work
ing deadline is a full 3'/2 weeks before the Chappie is distributed. After that, the copy is pasted
on dummies, as this mast is, and the magazine is carefully read for proof errors.
