# TUESDAY SERIES
## Canon Green Continues His Busy Schedule 
### PETE GROTHE 
Canon Bryan Green, Rector of
Birmingham, will continue his
whirlwind schedule today as he
will meet with living groups,
lead a discussion in the Wom
en's Clubhouse, and climax the
day with a 7:30 p.m. lecture in
Memorial Auditorium on his
theme of "Basic Christianity."
Tonight's address is on the Tues
day Evening Series, thus the half
hour shift in time. The remaining
two lectures, tomorrow and Thurs
day, will begin at 7 p m.
Students are especially advised
to set to Mem Am! early so that
they won't be shut out by the
many townspeople who are ex
pected.
The dynamic English clergyman
with the biting wit will lead a dis
cussion at 4:15 p.m. today on the
lower floor of the Women's Club
house on "Is Salvation Necessary
for Religion?"
Yesterday, the lower floor of the
Women's Clubhouse couldn't house
the hordes of students who poured
in to hear Canon Green's lecture on
"Christian Love, Friendship, and
Marriage," so the meeting had to be
held in Cubberley Auditorium.
Green listed six tests of real
love, saying, "I picked up this
idea of six tests in America. It's
something quite typically Ameri
can. You always have quaint lit
tle tests for everything over here.
Over in England, we know when
we are in love."
Green listed the six tests:
1. '"How long have you known
each other?"
2. "In what circumstances have
you known each other?"
"It's easy for people to love each
other, if all they do is have fun,
but I know a Jot of persons who
even argue about what kind of fun
they should have. To really know
whether you love a person, you
must see them in all kinds of cir
cumstances ... at work, with the
family, in hard times."
15. "What do you miss most when
you are away from each other?"
4. "What common social back
ground do you have?"
5. "Do you share common ideals?"
"For example, I do not recom
mend that a person who is a eon
firmed atheist marry a devout
Christian. Both are so devoted to
theses which are poles, apart, that
love could never be a very real
one."
<Â» "Do you absolutely trust each
other?"
Green defined real love as "a
complete giving of the whole self to
the other, and the receiving of the
same."
"In proportion as you arc selfish,
you don't love. A selfish man can
never really love. The real sin is
self-centeredness. And love must
be God-centered."
At one point, Green joked,
"When I was young, I had heard
of the Christian kiss. Really, to
me it seemed quite dull. 1 much
preferred the other kind."
Canon Green held a discussion at
Roblc last night, at 10:30, and moved
over to the Phi Dclt house at 11:30
to hold another hour discussion.
