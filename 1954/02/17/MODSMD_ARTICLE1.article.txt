## The 						Heart of Christianity— Christ's Death on the Cross 
### 
Canon Bryan Green turned too the "heart of Christianity—the
death of Christ on the cross and its meaning" in the second of his
series of lectures on "Basic Christianity" before an overflow
crowd in Memorial Auditorium last night.
Canon Green began:
"Why can't Jesus be just a moral teacher and not God? Simply

because that's bad history. History
forbids us to think of Him as a
moral teacher when His friends
thought of Him as God made flesh.
"The inner meaning of Christi
anity is that Jesus Christ is God.
"You can't he a Christian in the
New Testament sense until you
come to terms with Jesus Christ.
In Christ we have the reality be
hind the universe personally dis
closing Himself in history."
"If this hypothesis is true it leads
you to (the belief that) God com
mended His love toward us in that,
while we were yet sinners, Christ
died for us.
"This is an extraordinary contra
diction. If the reality behind the
universe is Christ, what do you
make of the cross? You can never
have Christianity and remove Cal
vary—it is integrated into the Whole
life of Christ. ... If you know the
Bible, you find one consent—that the
impact Jesus made was the impact
of his dying on the cross.
"Always clever people have said
this is foolish. Perhaps I could say
that for the Stanford intellect this
is foolishness and for the nominal
church-goer a stumbling block.
"For those of us who believe,
the cross is the power of integra
tion without which it is impos
sible to know God.
"It isn't the physical suffering
that matters at all. Others have
suffered more physically than
Christ. I'm not saying 'pity God'
and for pity's sake to follow Him.
I'm not saying 'come and sacrifice
yourself for humanity as He did.'
"What does matter is that here
we have a moral drama—the great
conflict between good and evil
worked out to the bitter end. Not
in Heaven, so we can speculate on
it, hut here on earth, so we can
sec it.
"The death of Jesus discloses
what happens when reality meets
man's sins in full impact. Here we
have divine love, the unique dis
closure of reality in time and his
tory, dying.
"Some have difficulty in seeing
the connection between the death
of Jesus 2,000 years ago and life to
day. I shall point out to you what
some of the sins are which crucified
Christ.
"The jealousy of the priests, who
hated free-lancers, and Jesus was a
free-lancer in religion. They wanted
to get their rival out of the way. They
were supposed to be bringing peo
ple to God, and Jesus was doing just
that.
"Moral cowardness. Pilate knew
it was expedient to crucify Jesus,
and when he did, he crucified jus
tice and freedom. Just think of the
snobbishness of life —the times we
keep quiet for fear of what people
will say—our fear to stand for right,
and you'll know what I mean by
'moral cowardness.'
"Sensuality, which makes one
completely insensible to spiritual
things—living for good food, good
clothes, and material comforts—we
make them our gods. You have al
lowed your sensual nature to have
its way, which is why you can't see
God.
"The self-centeredness and indif
ference of the mob. The Toms and
Dicks and Harrys . . . who cried
'hossanah' one minute and 'crucify'
the next.
"The problem today is indif
ference apathy. People just don't
think that Christ and religion are
important. They don't rate pri
ority. When you have it all set
tled . . . then go off about your
life; until it is settled, it must get
priority.
"If, then, reality is as Christ dis
closes it 011 the cross, and God is
good, look at what sin and evil have
done to His world. If reality is
righteous, what a desperate situation
we are in.
"Why doesn't God blot out the
world-if He is good?
"The answer is in the death of
Christ on the cross. It's not good
enough to say that on the cross He
just showed His love.
"Christ created a moral situation '

in which God can forgive sinners
and can plainly be seen to forgive.
"First, we see these in Christ
proof of the righteousness of God.
If Christ is God, we can't say He
doesn't hate sin, for we know He
fought it to the end.
"Second, as we look at the cross,
we sec one who offers forgiveness.
It is as if we see through a win
dow into the heart of God—God
who loves us even though we've
hurt Mini and made a mess of His
world.
"But this isn't the end. If it were,
it would mean in this world God is
defeated and man's sins could over
come Him.»
"This isn't the Christian insight.
For on the third day He arose again
from the dead. The reality of God's
goodness and love is not defeated—
it is victorious. He rose from the
grave in time and history.
"Man crucified Him, and He came
back.
"The last word is with God."
