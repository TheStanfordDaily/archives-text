# Visiting Yugoslav Diplomat Pledges Pro-West Policy
## 
### HADLEY ROFF 
Yugoslavia's rugged, handsome Ambassador to the United
States, Dr. Vladimir Popovich paid a short visit to campus yester
day, during which he told a gathering in Hoover Library that his
country intends to continue relations with "the West along the
same friendly lines."
Questioned pointedly by several research assistants from the

Library about a seeming
ment in Yugoslav-Soviet relations,
the 39-year-old diplomat replied
through an interpreter that the So
viet Union has pursued a moi'e
friendly course of policy as of late.
This is due, he thought, to the in
creased strength of the "Western
military bloc," to the growing po
tential of Yugoslavia, to "the inter
nal weaknesses of the Soviet Union,"
and finally to the failure of the
USSR in some areas of foreign
policy.
How far this recently apparent
friendliness will go, the ambassador
said, is uncertain.
Then, in an aside, he said, "I don't
believe it will go very far."
Dr. Popovich also discussed the
much debated possibility of Red
China repeating Yugoslavia's unique
switch of suddenly severing rela
tions with Russia.
He said that evidence gathered
while Yugoslavia was still a So
viet satellite indicated the exist
ence of certain irritations between
Chinese Communist leaders and
the Politburo in Moscow.
The athletic looking Yugoslav said
further that the possibility of the
Chinese making such a historic turn
about hinged greatly on Western
policies.
"If the free world—and particu
larly the United States—should pur
sue a negative policy toward China
then that break will not come."
