# Austria Drops Campaign For independence
## 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 16 (UP)â€”Austria
abandoned hope for independ
ence in the foreseeable future
tonight after a new round of ap
peals to Soviet Foreign Minister
V. M. Mooltov fell on deaf ears.
The three Western powers and
Austria in turn urged Molotov to
reconsider his demands for the in
definite ocupation and permanent
neutralization of Austria. He only
parroted his earlier arguments for
them.
Then Foreign Minister Leopold
Figl drove from the Big Four con
feernce back to his hotel to report
to Chancellor Julius Raab in Vienna
that the jig was up. He told the
ministers earlier today that his gov
ernment had rejected a treaty with
the Soviet shackles.
After Figl left, the Western min
isters stayed behind at the Allied
Control Authority building in the
U.S. sector for a private talk on
strategy for the last two days of the
conference. It ends Thursday.
They were believed io have lined
Up their plans for a secret session
tomorrow, at which they hoped to
pin down Molotov to a yes or no
answer fo the proposal for a Korean
peace conference in Geneva April
15.
