# 'Germ Warfare' Court Opens Formal Session
## Marine Inquirers Shown Red Film 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 (UP).
A Marine Corps court of inquiry
witnessed a Communist propa
ganda film today as it opened
the first formal investigation of
germ warfare "confessions" by
American prisoners in Korea.
Assistant court counsel Dalton M.
Bennett said the film was shown to
let the court know to what lengths
the Communists went in an effort to
build up a case of bacteriological
warfare against this country.
The film included false "confes
sions" by four U.S. Air Force fliers
that they had waged germ warfare.
It did not include Col. Frank H.
Schwable, whose case is before the
court.
Schwable has admitted he signed
a 6,000-word germ warfare "'con
fession" under Communist torture.
He repudiated it after his repatri
ation in September, 1053.
Schwable said he either had to
"confess" to germ warfare or never
come out of the Red prison camps
alive.
Gen. Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr.,
Marine Corps Commandant, asknd
the court to "advise me as to whether
the degree of physical, mental and
psychological suffering experienced
by Col. Schwable was such as would
reasonably constitute an excuse for
acts of the type he is alleged to have
committed."
