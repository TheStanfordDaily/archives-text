# No Surprise
## 
### 
It came as no great surprise last week when
Governor Allan Shivers of Texas announced
that he is going to ask his state legislature to
make membership in the Communist party a
capital offense.
The Governor's reasoning is infallible- in
fallible if one acepts his conviction that "To me,
liif words 'Communist' and 'traitor' are syn
onymous. We should not permit any part of
the Constitution, even if it is in the midst of the
Bill of Rights, to be used to plant explosives
that might demolish the Constitution and the
(lovernrnent of the United States."
What is surprising —and shocking - about
ilt« Governor's statement is that mo lew people
to rare, A casual smile, a shrug of the

shoulders, an off-hand "Oh, really?" is about
all many of us can manage.
Yet here is an example of a responsible pub
lic official, representing the largest state of the
Union, saying that membership in a minority
party merits the death penalty. Here is a man
who would bypass the cumbersome legal pro
ceedings of the Constitution with the simple
equation: Communist; - traitor death.
And nowhere is there more than a whimper
of protest.
The Shiverses and McCarthys and others
will continue to speak out. There is no danger
iri their words. There is great danger when we
who read these words refuse to care ot think
about their implications,
