# Italy and Stability
## 
### 
Will Italy settle down politically? Or will
she continue to hire and fire premiers? These
questions, prompted by the recent failure of
Amintore Fanfani and the current attempt of
Mario Scelba to organize workable govern
ments, cannot be answered except by more
cjuestions, such as: "What caused politics to
flounder so disastrously in Italy afer the war?"
Overpopulation and an economic structure
which must be adjusted to contemporary prob
lems certainly have a direct influence on Italy's
political flounderings. But the only real ac
complishment since the end of the war in this
area was President Einaudi's successful defla
tionary policy in 1947, which checked the pro
ductivity of Italian industry. The European Re
covery Program helped to prevent economic
'iHoiioration, but Italy is still faced with a ter

rific unemployment rate and is plagued with
overpopulation.
Another obstacle in the way of political sta
bility is Communism. The Communist party is
far from dominant in Italy, but it must be con
sidered in the formation of any coalition large
enough for a parliamentary vote of confidence.
There lies another symptom of Italy's instability
the temporary and ineffective, nature of these
coalitions.
We cannot propose solutions to Italy's eco
nomic and political problems, nor do more than
list some of the outstanding symptoms. What
we can do is suggest that Italy is an important
frontier along the Iron Curtain, and as such she
deserves our constant attention and help so that
perhaps she will be able to follow signposts to
political and economic stability.
