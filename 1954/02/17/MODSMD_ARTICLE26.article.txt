# Rain and Lake Lag
## 
### 
We are glad to report that yesterday's clouds
had a silver lining we could see the water in
Lake Lagunita.
Lake Lag is slowly but surely filling up. Cor
poration Yard officials tell us that the puddle in
the middle of the lake bed now totals 19 mil
lion gallons.
They also inform us:
We need 118 million gallons to fill the lake.

We get from five to eight million gallons in a
day of good hard downpour.
According to our arithmetic, this means that
we need somewhere between 13 and 20 more
days of rain this quarter, if we're going to swim
and canoe behind the Boathouse this spring.
And so, as we dispiritedly slosh along on our
way to class, through the Post Office puddles
and over the Engineering Corner plank, v/e are
glad it is raining.
