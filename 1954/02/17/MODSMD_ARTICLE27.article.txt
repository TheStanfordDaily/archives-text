### PETE GROTHE 
ON BRYAN GREEN FROM ENGLAND
Aside from Bryan Green's scholastic, oratorical,
i.d theological talents, he is a vast reservoir of anec
lot.es.
A student sitting next to the English clergyman
l I lie Stanford-USC basketball game last Saturday

■ aid, "1 must prepare you. I al
ways swear when we lose basket
hull games."
Canon Green answered, "When
I was speaking at an American
ln>;h school recently, a student,
• inked me, 'Is it, all right to
wear'."
1 said, 'Certainly, but you
must use only certain words,'
and I proceeded to list the swear
words they could say. It quite
hocked them."

A h<*lavy stream of students was heading towards
»lem And for the Convocation last Friday, and out
Indent was rushing in the opposite direction.
A friend yelled out to the one bucking the crowd,
Hey, why don't you go hear this guy? He's sup
iosed to be the greatest speaker in the world."

"Yeah," whs the answer, "but, lie's speaking on the
wrong subject."
When the minister with the curly, graying hair,
and the piercing eyes spoke to 150 Encina inmates,
he said, "When I walked into Encina, I noticed the
placard saying 'Basic Christianity with Bryan
Green,' or in other words, 'to heaven with Bryan
Green.' And to show you the paradox of modern
life, right next to it. was a sign saying, 'To Hell with
'56'."
At a local movie last Friday, a particularly corny
flick was showing a girl leaning on her beau's shoul
der, and she was singing "I love you, I love you."
Apparently a sizable portion of the audience had
heard Canon Green's Convocation address, because
the cry went up, "It's only glands."
Canon Green told me the other night of an ex
perience he had at Columbia University. He said,
"When I was at Columbia for a short while, I met
a most charming girl who was the president of the
League of Atheists. She was a very nice person, and
we had several long discussions, Interestingly
enough, she became a Christian.
"It was re: lly quite disconcerting to the League
of Atheists, you know. They had to find a new presi
dent."
