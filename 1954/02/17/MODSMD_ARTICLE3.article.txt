# Overflow Crowd

FULL HOUSEâ€”An overflow crowd last night crowded their way
into Memorial Auditorium to hear Canon Bryan Green deliver
the second in his series of nightly lectures on Basic Christianity.
Seated around Canon Green on the Mem Aud stage are some of
the students who gave up their seats to accomodate late-comers,
many of whom were turned away.
