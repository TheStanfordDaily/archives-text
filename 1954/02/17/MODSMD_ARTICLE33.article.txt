# 1895 Ratio Drop to 2:1 Called 'Startling Surprise'
## 
### SHIRLEY ELDER 
In 1895, all sorts of problems were arising and the Trustees al
most gave up and handed the school over to the women.
An increase in the female enrollment which pushed the ratio
down to two to one was viewed as a "startling surprise" in an
1895 Memorial Day address. "The most logical assumption is that
Stanford is better suited for ladies>

than other colleges. This would
seem to point to the posibility that
within 20 years Stanford may be
come the Vassar of the Pacific
Coast," the speaker added.
A series of athletic victories by
California was even blamed on
the presence of so many women—
"women so attractive," said the
San Francisco Chronicle, "that too
many men turned to queening
rather than to hard athletic prac
tice for the glory of their alma
inater."
Even the Portland Oregonian re
marked on what they called "the
increase in power among the (Stan
ford) women. They are voting
themselves into all the offices and
thereby rendering the institution
less desirable to male students than
it otherwise would be."
"A woman edits the junior an
nual," the superior male moaned,
"another brings out the weekly pa
per, and still another leads the in
tercollegiate debate. Thus, there is
an alarming tendency apparent to
ward reducing the University to the
level of a women's seminary which
Mrs. Stanford very much dreads."
Mrs. Stanford, however, remained
quiet until the female enrollment
leaped to 40 per cent; then, without
a word to Dr. Jordan or anyone
else, she put through an amendment
to the charter limiting the number
of women students at any one time
to 500.
Mrs. Stanford steadfastly refused
requests to make the limit more
flexible and it remained that way
for over 20 years.

In the meantime, rules and regu
lations "for the guidance and pro
tection of the young women" were
being discussed by University offi
cials
In 1895, girls had to be in their
houses by 9 p.m. and even in 1921
unchaperoned "motoring" around
campus after dark was strictly for
bidden.
The first time Encina frosh
asked the Ruble girls over, the
girls had a meeting and decided to
refuse the invitation because it
did not seem proper to dance at
such an early date and on such
slight acquaintance.
In 1911, when the women were
given control over social regula
tions, one of their first acts was to
penalize a girl lor smoking. How
ever; by 1924 smoking was legal—
at home but not on Quad.
And clear up to 1941 girls had to
wear long cotton or silk stockings.
In that year, the rule was relaxed
only because of the shortage of silk
and with the provision that "the
girls do not ipdicate the trend of
mind one usually associates with
braids and bobby socks."
It is difficult to be certain what
was meant by that admonition, but
somehow Stanford has not become
the Vassar of the West.
