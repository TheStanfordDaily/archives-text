# Bob Garrett, Bud Finger Win Valley Sports Awards
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Bob Garrett, Stanford's All-Ev
erything quarterback, and Bud Fin
ger, who coached the Cards to their
sixth NCAA golf championship last
year, received top honors at the
San Jose Mercury - News Tourna
ment of Champions Monday night.
Garrett was named Champion of
Champions for the Santa Clara Val
ley, while Finger was presented
with the award for the Valley's
Coach of the Year.
The choice of Garrett, who was
picked on several All - American
teams and was the nation's number
one pro football draft choice, was to
be expected, but the choice of Fin
ger was a surprising one.
Finger was named Stanford's head
golf coach in 1949 when Ed Twiggs
retired with a record of five NCAA
championships in 11 years.
Finger was a star for the 1939 na
tional champs, and in 1941 he was
a member of possibly the most pow
erful college golf juggernaut ever
assembled. The 1941 team swept
every dual meet, walked off with
the PCC championship by 32 strokes,
and won the NCAA by 19.

After one mediocre season, Stan
lord, under Finger's coaching, re
turned to its position as the golf
power of the West. The Cards have
won three straight titles, but until
last season they did poorly in NC
AA competition.
Last year's squad scored an upset
win over powerful North Texas
State and LSU. Finger has his three
top players back this year.
