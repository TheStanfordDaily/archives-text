## Forgiveness—A Restoration To Relationship With God 
### 
Again addressing a large audience
in Memorial Auditorium, Canon
Bryan Green, the eloquent English
cleric, last night took his auditors
to the third step in his series on
Basic Christianity by discussing
man's sin and God's forgiveness.
"Religion," he said, "must do two
things if it is to be properly related
to reality.
"It must respect my dignity.
"And it must deal with man's dis
order.
"Christianity wants to make me
v/hat I really ought to be . . . that
is, to be the integrated, truly human
person Jesus Christ was.
"But," he asked, "does Christian
ity deal with man's disorder?
"Communists will say that man's
disorder is due primarily to eco
nomic considerations.
"But man's disorder is not only
economic, it is moral. If we believe
that God disclosed his nature in
time and history through Jesus
Christ, then sin — which crucified
Him—must be considered."
"Sin," the canon continued, "is not
only that which I know is wrong,
but do. It is much more than that.
"It is being without God . . . and
being without a relationship with
God is the ultimate sin.
"Not to partake of the relation
ship that God intended for man is
damnation.
"Self-centered ego, out of adjust
ment with God, is the root of all
our maladies. So many take it for
granted that whenever we want re
lationship with God, we can get it.

In our patronizing way we think
that we have God on tap . . .
"If God is real, then He should
be the central, the dominating ideal
in our life.
"What was God's reaction to
man's sin? His reaction was one of
forgiveness ... as displayed on the
cross at Calvary."
"Let's now discuss what forgive
ness is not," Canon Green invited.
"Forgiveness is not a letting-off
from punishment. In a moral world,
for whatever wrong we do we are
punished. The consequences get us
in the neck.
"Further, forgiveness is not a
blotting out of a nasty stain . . . for
that which I have done becomes a
part of me. Every good thing, as
well as bad thing, I do becomes a
part of me.
"What then is forgiveness?
"It is a restoration to relationship.
I who am not one with God become
one with Him. It is, that when I am
forgiven, God treats me as if I had
never sinned.
"I know that the love of Calvary
puts me back into relationship with
God—back into His friendship. That
is Christian forgiveness.
"God's forgiveness is freely of
fered, offered as a gift. It doesn't
depend on self effort. No man can
make himself a Christian. All I can
do as a child of God is to put myself
in the way of His love.
"Forgiveness doesn't depend or.
my understanding, for no one can
completely understand God. We can
only try to understand Him as much
as possible. And forgiveness does
not depend on my merits.
"All we can do is accept His for
giveness. We don't understand it,
we don't deserve it, but it is given
to us.
"I must come to Jesus as I am.
My pride must be humbled to ac
cept.
"Pride, above all things, is the
battle ground."
"Forgiveness is simple. It must be,
for it must come down to the level
of humanity. Christianity is a gos
pel for everybody. Everybody can
be forgiven if his pride has yielded.
"You can be forgiven tonight."
