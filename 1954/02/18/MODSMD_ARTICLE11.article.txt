# Card Boxers Lose to Cal
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
Heavyweight Bob Birkie put a
nice finishing touch to last night's
pugilistic activities at the Pavilion,
but the Stanford boxing team took
their second loss of the season at the
hands of California. The score was
7-2.
Big Bob, in winning his fifth
straight fight of the season without
a defeat, was Stanford's lone win
ner of the night, as he was in the
first Indian-Bear match of the sea
son. The Cards garnered their other
point on a couple of draws.
Actually, even the heavyweight
brawl, which attracted most of the
500 paying customers, was a dis
appointment. Not a really solid
blow was struck in the fight, as
Cal's Dick King either kept clinch
ing with, or running away from,
(he ominous Birkie.
In the first fight of the evening,
Stanford's Bill Clark, making his
first boxing start of the season, did
very well for himself. He and Cal's
Boh Nelson battled to t draw.
In the second 125-lb. fight, Cal's
Phil Ishimaru outpointed Bill Tol

ley in a very close match.
Fred Dittmer of Stanford, fighting
at 139, seemed to be well ahead of
Cal's Dick Lohndahl going into the
last round. Then Fred apparently
tired and Lohndahl went on to win
by TKO.
The 165-pound bout turned out
to be the second draw of the eve
ning. The Indians' Eric Hansen
and Cal's Gene Burkley battled on
even terms for the distance.
In the 165-pound match, the Bears'
Vin Young was just too much for
a battling Doug Stocks. Young won
by TKO in the second.
Stanford was hurt even more than
usual by their perennial nemesis,
namely, a lack of boxers. The In
dians forfeited three weight divi
sions, the 132-pound class, the 147,
and the 177.
