# Two Cases Argued At Moot Court
## 
### 
Two cases were argued last night
by student lawyers in the second
round of the Law School's three
day Moot Court session.
One of the cases involved cen
sorship of a book describing condi
tions in Yugoslavia before and dur
ing the reign of Tito. The book was
labeled obscene by the lower court
on the basis of its combination of
moral forthrightness with social
criticism.
The defendant, in pleading the
case of the publishing house, ar
gued that the Penal Code on
which the decision was based was
too vague, and thus the jury was
not instructed properly. Due proc
ess of law was therefore violated.
The plaintiff sought to convince
the Appellate Court that the trial in
the lower court was complete, and
that the jury understood that a
book's literary merit is insignificant
if in the hands of the average read
er it appears immoral.
This case will he repeated again
tonight in Room 163-B in the Law
School at 7:30.
The other case concerned the
right of a sedate college professor
to prohibit films made of him as a
cowboy in his youth from being
shown on TV. The professor pro
tested that the showing of these
films destroyed his dignity and
made him liable to ridicule.
