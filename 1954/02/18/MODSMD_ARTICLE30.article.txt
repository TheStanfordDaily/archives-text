# The
						Quality of the Flicks
## 
### 
A quick look at an old tradition—the Sunday
flicks—proves that there's nothing wrong with
the beginning of a week that a good movie
can't cure.
And we do mean a good movie along the
lines of "Viva Zapata" or "Frogmen," both of
which have filled Memorial Auditorium earlier
this quarter. A glance at the future schedule
tells us that favorites like "Broken Arrow"
and "Cyrano de Bergerac" will be well worth
the 20 cents admission charge.

Mike Zeiler, chief movie-procurer for the
ASSU, deserves much credit for arranging for
top pictures, especially in the face of opposi
tion from local movie houses.
At the moment a petition is circulating which
asks for a return of the serial as part of tlje regu
lar bill, lf that's what students want, fine—as
long as it doesn't cut down the price we can
pay to get gratie-A attractions.
All this is by way of saying "keep up the
good work." The Sunday flicks is one tradition
we are pleased to support.
