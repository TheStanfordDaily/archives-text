# Building Personal Understanding
## 
### 
Last night 35 foreign students joined with the
members of Stanfords' seven eating clubs for
dinner and discussion.
In the informal atmosphere of the clubrooms,
the foreign students talked of their own coun
tries and their views of the United States as
seen at Stanford. The Stanford students with
whom they conversed gave what they knew of
their own University and the country in which
they live. Questions and comments were ex
changed on matters of politics, education, cul
ture, and history. Common beliefs were dis
covered. Basic differences were clarified.

And, in the end, that guality of knowledge
which we believe to be so important to stu
dents personal understanding â€” was in
creased by the contact made between the for
eign students and American students.
We commend the lIR and the Interclub Coun
cil for its efforts to help this "understanding."
And we suggest that other oampus groups fol
low the example of the Interclub Council by
taking advantage of the facilities of the lIR and
the presence of foreign students at Stanford.
Their members will profit by such contacts as
were made last night.
