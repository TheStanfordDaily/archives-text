FLORA AND FAUNA OF OUR FAIR
UNIVERSITY: II
Today, we will take up our study where space
forced us to leave off on Monday morning, beginning
our discussion with an original study on the televi
sion viewer.
First off, there is the Addict. You will seldom (if
ever) see one of this variety on the Quad: he never

goes to the Quad. Go to the
dorms, the eating clubs, or the
houses, any place with a dipole
or a yagi on the roof, and there,
in semi-darkness, you will find
the Addict.
I knew one of these fellows au
tumn quarter, poor chap. All
went well till Finals Week. Came
his first final, eight of us dragged
him away from 01' Debil Video,
and off toward his class. As soorj

u.s the light of day hit him, he just sort or snriveled
up, and was no more. Heart rending, it was.
Then there is the TV Lew die. Usually not found
where women are apt to be found, this guy is too
evil to write for either the Chappie or the Bull
Session. He can take the most innocent remark, with
amazing dexterity rephrase it slightly, and give a
most obscene •implication to the whole thing. All
light for stag smokers, but not the type to take home
to mother.
Let us not forget the Inveterate Sports Viewer.
A walking record book, this fellow will tell you
who would have won the Rose Bowl in 1944 if the
game had been played, and why they would have
won. He can tell you RBI averages, Derby win
ners, famous Series plays of history, or anything
else you might want to know on the drop of a hat.

Not only can he tell you, lie always tells you.
The ultimate in sports viewers is the Fight Fiend.
This guy is identifiable by the scarred lace, a result
of using Gillette Blue Blades (sharpest edges ever
honed) while under (he influence of Pabst Blue
Ribbon (smoother, smoother, smoother flavor). Ask
this boy, and he'll give you the World's Flyweight
Champion when Teddy Roosevelt was charging San
Juan Hill, but it's doubtful if he knows who Teddy
Roosevelt was, let alone why iri hell he was charging
a hill.
We should not, make the grave omission of the
Child Show Viewer. An uuusual sort, of a person,
this fellow is perfectly normal until Kukla, Fran,
and Ollie come on. Others can't eat till they've seen
Howdy Doody. The weaker of ihese boys cracked
up when Crusader Rabbit pooped out. (For the
curious, I understand that. Crusader and Rqgs just
ran out of things to crusade for. I wouldn't know
myself.)
The real aristocrat is the Discriminating Viewer.
This Tareyton smoker spends an occasional hour
watching Omnibus, current events shows, and other
such high-caliber stuff. Let a show get one had
notice from the PTA Bureau for the Encourage
ment of Better Entertainment, and it's off this lad's
list, hut for good. As a rule, this is the handsome,
intelligent, thoughtful leader-of-tomorrow type.
Look at me.
The reader should not feel that these are mutually
exclusive categories, nor that this is an all-inclusive
listing.
Should you discover, and I don't say that you
won't, that there is insufficient paper made in the
course of a year to handle the list, just start scratch
ing additions into the side of the set.

u.s the light of day hit him, he just sort or snriveled
up, and was no more. Heart rending, it was.
Then there is the TV Lew die. Usually not found
where women are apt to be found, this guy is too
evil to write for either the Chappie or the Bull
Session. He can take the most innocent remark, with
amazing dexterity rephrase it slightly, and give a
most obscene •implication to the whole thing. All
light for stag smokers, but not the type to take home
to mother.
Let us not forget the Inveterate Sports Viewer.
A walking record book, this fellow will tell you
who would have won the Rose Bowl in 1944 if the
game had been played, and why they would have
won. He can tell you RBI averages, Derby win
ners, famous Series plays of history, or anything
else you might want to know on the drop of a hat.

Not only can he tell you, lie always tells you.
The ultimate in sports viewers is the Fight Fiend.
This guy is identifiable by the scarred lace, a result
of using Gillette Blue Blades (sharpest edges ever
honed) while under (he influence of Pabst Blue
Ribbon (smoother, smoother, smoother flavor). Ask
this boy, and he'll give you the World's Flyweight
Champion when Teddy Roosevelt was charging San
Juan Hill, but it's doubtful if he knows who Teddy
Roosevelt was, let alone why iri hell he was charging
a hill.
We should not, make the grave omission of the
Child Show Viewer. An uuusual sort, of a person,
this fellow is perfectly normal until Kukla, Fran,
and Ollie come on. Others can't eat till they've seen
Howdy Doody. The weaker of ihese boys cracked
up when Crusader Rabbit pooped out. (For the
curious, I understand that. Crusader and Rqgs just
ran out of things to crusade for. I wouldn't know
myself.)
The real aristocrat is the Discriminating Viewer.
This Tareyton smoker spends an occasional hour
watching Omnibus, current events shows, and other
such high-caliber stuff. Let a show get one had
notice from the PTA Bureau for the Encourage
ment of Better Entertainment, and it's off this lad's
list, hut for good. As a rule, this is the handsome,
intelligent, thoughtful leader-of-tomorrow type.
Look at me.
The reader should not feel that these are mutually
exclusive categories, nor that this is an all-inclusive
listing.
Should you discover, and I don't say that you
won't, that there is insufficient paper made in the
course of a year to handle the list, just start scratch
ing additions into the side of the set.

FLORA AND FAUNA OF OUR FAIR
UNIVERSITY: II
Today, we will take up our study where space
forced us to leave off on Monday morning, beginning
our discussion with an original study on the televi
sion viewer.
First off, there is the Addict. You will seldom (if
ever) see one of this variety on the Quad: he never

goes to the Quad. Go to the
dorms, the eating clubs, or the
houses, any place with a dipole
or a yagi on the roof, and there,
in semi-darkness, you will find
the Addict.
I knew one of these fellows au
tumn quarter, poor chap. All
went well till Finals Week. Came
his first final, eight of us dragged
him away from 01' Debil Video,
and off toward his class. As soorj

u.s the light of day hit him, he just sort or snriveled
up, and was no more. Heart rending, it was.
