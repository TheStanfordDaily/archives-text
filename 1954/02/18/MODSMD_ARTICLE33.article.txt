## Security—Rah! 
### 
To the Editor:
Tlie Daily for Feb. 16 has on the front page an
article under the heading: "Security. Eisenhower's
New Plan Filters Out Communist." I must admit it
took me a while to decide whether the article was
supposed to be taken seriously. I think it was.
The actual content of the article was that among
2,200 federal employees fired under the Eisenhower
administration's new security program there was at
least one active Communist. Further specified is that
he was a "former" Red, and that it was the first time
that a top administration official has said the security

program resulted in the ouster of an actual Commu
nist.
Rah rah! Long live the Land of the* Free! The
security program succeeded in getting rid of one—
one —Communist by breaking 2,200 careers!!
I have a suggestion: why not fire the administration
and every single federal employee? Then there
would be 100 per cent certainty that there were no
more Communistic federal employees. There would
n't even lie a government the Communists could
overthrow.
Isn't that a miracle solution?
NIELS TI, VTNDINf!
