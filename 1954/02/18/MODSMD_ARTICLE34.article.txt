# Gushing Enthusiasm?
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I suppose that we cannot expect a critical attitude
from The Daily toward Bryan Green's purpose, but
a critical analysis of his position here is woefully
lacking from the University's one critical organiza
tion.
As far as external appearances go, this series has
been quite successful: hundreds are being turned
away from him (suffer the kiddies not); however, we
should acknowledge the possibility that this is in
large part due to the appeal of a personality and to

the spectacle itself. That i.s, Bryan Green has been
as commercially advertised as his religion and is thus
attracting many who are merely curious. Therefore,
in view of this, but mainly because there are students
who disagree with the man, that there are those
who disapprove of his purpose, and that many dis
approve of the spectacle in general, The Daily should
modify its gushing enthusiasm and reassume its rale
of a critical voice representing the students of the
University.
