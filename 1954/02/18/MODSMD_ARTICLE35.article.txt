# Essentially an Evangelist
## 
### 
To the Editor:
The arrival here of Canon Bryan Green was her
alded with a barrage of publicity which has not yet
let up.
We do not object to his presence on the campus
so much as we are wary of the emotional effect it is
having on the students. Impressed by his appealing
personality and dramatic oratorical stvle, manv stu-

dents are uncritically accepting the logic of what he
says.
Canon Green is essentially an evangelist.
Wo suggest that the listener evaluate (he content
of the speeches, keeping this in mind.
