Yqu may not have noticed, but this UCLA basketball team which will
be racing up and down in the Pavilion tomorrow night really means busi
ness.
Yes, the Bruins look like they're downright serious about grabbing off
the PCC championship which Cal seemed to have sole claim on just two
weeks ago.
Five straight league games the Bruins have won. And I'm afraid it'll be
seven by the end of the weekend. Johnny Wooden has finally decided on
a first string—a sharpshooting crew with height, speed, and gobs of basket
ball ability.
Look what the Bruins did last week to Cal's "best team in 30 years."
The Bears' tight defense had permitted opponents to average only 53.6

points in six previous games. UC
LA rang up K2 points Friday and
another 71 on Saturday.
Little Ron Livingston, the high
scoring Uclan floor leader, made
Bob Matheny (there's no need to
mention how great he is if you've
read San Francisco papers at all)
look like a rookie. In Friday's game
Livingston forced Matheny into his
fourth foul at the start of the sec
ond quarter. The Cal hero was in
effectual thereafter.
Saturday night Nibs Price had
Frank Hess guarding Livingston.
Matheny was shifted over to Don
Bragg.
Hulking Boh Mi-Keen, who
holds the PCC seasonal scoring
record, was tied up and held down

by UCLA 's sophomore monster Willie Naulls. McKeen eonnecteri on
only four of lli field goal attempts Friday night.
Naulls, a 230-pound, G-5 giant who is bigger than any footballer UCLA
sent into the Rose Bowl, out-rebounded McKeen as well. His perform
ance rated Southland Player of the Week honors from the Los Angeles
basketball writers.
And that isn't the half of it. There's Don Bragg, Johnny Moore, and
Ron Bane to fill out the starting five. This crew hits from floor better
than 40 per cent of the time. Needless to say, the Bruins are the highest
scoring quintet in the division. Consider along with this, the fact that
Stanford has the weakest defense.
Boh Burnett says the Bruins are the best team on the Coast, and my
guess is that he's right. This doesn't mean that the Bruins can't he
beaten, just that they probably won't be.
Stanford will have to turn in four quarters of top-flight hall to stay .
anywhere near UCLA. And Stanford hasn't played four consecutive
quarters of top-flight ball all season.
I don't think the Indians' scrambling, half-court press, with George Sel
leck and Oleg Suzdaleff diving around the mid-court line trying to swipe
the ball from the guards, will pay off against UCLA. Every time Stanford
jumps out of position, either Bragg or Livingston will be breaking for the
basket. Bragg, taking passes from Livingston, ripped Cal apart on this
kind of maneuver last week.
Selleck, of course, will be Stanford's key. If he can feed in to Russ
Lawler around the key, il he can keep those sharp passes zooming to men
in the open, if he can find the range with his.jumps and sets, the Cards
might overcome their lack of all-around scoring punch and force the Bruins
to press.
Stanford can't beat UCLA, but it might force the Bruins into beating
themselves.
* * #
So Moose McKeen says he's going to give up college basketball. And
for the books at (hat! Does anybody wanna bet?
If McKeen is anything like the typical athlete, come next fall the old
urge will strike him down and he'll be back in action for Cal. Ami don't
think all this All-American build-up won't influence him.

Lawler around the key, il he can keep those sharp passes zooming to men
in the open, if he can find the range with his.jumps and sets, the Cards

So Moose McKeen says he's going to give up college basketball. And
for the books at (hat! Does anybody wanna bet?
If McKeen is anything like the typical athlete, come next fall the old
urge will strike him down and he'll be back in action for Cal. Ami don't
think all this All-American build-up won't influence him.


DON BKAGG
—Kipped Cal apart
Yqu may not have noticed, but this UCLA basketball team which will
be racing up and down in the Pavilion tomorrow night really means busi
ness.
Yes, the Bruins look like they're downright serious about grabbing off
the PCC championship which Cal seemed to have sole claim on just two
weeks ago.
Five straight league games the Bruins have won. And I'm afraid it'll be
seven by the end of the weekend. Johnny Wooden has finally decided on
a first string—a sharpshooting crew with height, speed, and gobs of basket
ball ability.
Look what the Bruins did last week to Cal's "best team in 30 years."
The Bears' tight defense had permitted opponents to average only 53.6

points in six previous games. UC
LA rang up K2 points Friday and
another 71 on Saturday.
Little Ron Livingston, the high
scoring Uclan floor leader, made
Bob Matheny (there's no need to
mention how great he is if you've
read San Francisco papers at all)
look like a rookie. In Friday's game
Livingston forced Matheny into his
fourth foul at the start of the sec
ond quarter. The Cal hero was in
effectual thereafter.
Saturday night Nibs Price had
Frank Hess guarding Livingston.
Matheny was shifted over to Don
Bragg.
Hulking Boh Mi-Keen, who
holds the PCC seasonal scoring
record, was tied up and held down

by UCLA 's sophomore monster Willie Naulls. McKeen eonnecteri on
only four of lli field goal attempts Friday night.
Naulls, a 230-pound, G-5 giant who is bigger than any footballer UCLA
sent into the Rose Bowl, out-rebounded McKeen as well. His perform
ance rated Southland Player of the Week honors from the Los Angeles
basketball writers.
And that isn't the half of it. There's Don Bragg, Johnny Moore, and
Ron Bane to fill out the starting five. This crew hits from floor better
than 40 per cent of the time. Needless to say, the Bruins are the highest
scoring quintet in the division. Consider along with this, the fact that
Stanford has the weakest defense.
Boh Burnett says the Bruins are the best team on the Coast, and my
guess is that he's right. This doesn't mean that the Bruins can't he
beaten, just that they probably won't be.
Stanford will have to turn in four quarters of top-flight hall to stay .
anywhere near UCLA. And Stanford hasn't played four consecutive
quarters of top-flight ball all season.
I don't think the Indians' scrambling, half-court press, with George Sel
leck and Oleg Suzdaleff diving around the mid-court line trying to swipe
the ball from the guards, will pay off against UCLA. Every time Stanford
jumps out of position, either Bragg or Livingston will be breaking for the
basket. Bragg, taking passes from Livingston, ripped Cal apart on this
kind of maneuver last week.
Selleck, of course, will be Stanford's key. If he can feed in to Russ
Lawler around the key, il he can keep those sharp passes zooming to men
in the open, if he can find the range with his.jumps and sets, the Cards
