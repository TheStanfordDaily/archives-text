# Stanford NROTC Students Are Treated to a Submarine Cruise
## 
### 
Thirty-five Stanford NROTC ca
dets went on a submarine cruise
Sunday aboard the U.S.S. Cusk. The
midshipmen were accompanied by
several prominent Bay Area resi
dents and Stanford officials, includ
ing H. Donald Winbigler, Dean of
Students, and A1 Masters, Stanford
Athletic Director.
The group boarded the boat at
Treasure Island in San Francisco
Bay early Sunday morning and
were out until about 4:30 that af
ternoon.

The submarine cruised for the
day near the Farallon Islands, just
outside the Golden Gate Bridge.
During the trip it made four dives
to periscope depth. The visitors
were also treated to a turkey dinner
in the afternoon.
Junior midshipmen from the NR
OTC unit navigated and manned
the controls on the way out, and the
commanding officer of the Cusk,
Lt. Cmdr. Pridonoff, expressed sat
isfaction with the job they had done.

OUT TO SEA—The Cusk passes under the Golden Gate Bridge en route to the diving area.
With 35 Stanford NROTC midshipmen aboard, the submarine made four dives to periscope
depth. Visible in the foreground is Lt. Parsons of the NROTC unit.


THE INNER WORKS—-Chief Petty Officer E. E. Smith describes the operation of the central con
trol panel or "Christmas Tree" to Dean Winbigler (left) and Athletic Director A 1 Masters. When
all the lights on the "Christmas Tree" are green, the submarine is water-tight and ready to sub
merge. Any open vents or air induction valves are indicated by a red light on the board. The
submarine is one of the newest types afloat.


WELCOME ABOARD —Lt. Cmdr. Pridonoff, commanding offi
cer of the Cusk, poses in the wardroom with A 1 Masters, Stan
ford athletic director, and H. Donald Winbigler, Dean of Stu
dents, shortly after welcoming them aboard the boat. Although
there were rough seas Sunday, they were not noticed most of
the time by those aboard, because when a submarine sub
merges any turbulence above cannot be felt. The cadets' trip
was one of several which the NROTC'takes each year.


CAT NAP—A midshipman naps in the forward torpedo room of
the Cusk during the time the boat is submerged. Several mem
bers of the crew are guartered here and sleep under, over, or
beside torpedoes. Though most Navy vessels are always re
ferred to as "ships," a submarine is correctly called a "boat."


DOCKED—The U.S.S. Cusk, S.S. 348, is docked at a Treasure Island pier before carrying the
Stanford Naval ROTC students for a cruise. The ship was commissioned in 1945, and is
equipped with a guided missile launching apparatus. A refitting in the near future will include
the installation of a "Snorkel," or underwater breathing device. A part of the Bay Bridge can
be seen in the background.


CHOW DOWN, MATES—Stanford midshipmen eat a turkey
dinner aboard the Cusk during their cruise Sunday. Unaccus
tomed to so many visitors, the boat's cooks had to break out
frozen steak when the supply of turkey gave out. Submarines
are traditionally noted for having the best food in the Navy, and
the Farm NROTC cadets enjoyed their dinner despite the rough
seas above.
