# Canon's Talks To End Today
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Canon Bryan Green, whose
wit and oratorical abilities are
only exceeded by his indefatiga
bility, will conclude a stagger
ing schedule of addresses at the
Memorial Church at 7 p.m. on!
"What Keeps a Man from Faith." j
Tlie scene of the lectures on "Ba- I
sic Christianity" is shifting from
Memorial Auditorium to the church
because of scenery on the stage at
Mem Aud. Canon Green empha
sized yesterday:
"I want to make it clear that my
address in Memorial Church will be
purely a lecture and nothing else.
It won't be a service. I say this so
that my Roman Catholic brethren
and my Jewish friends will feel free
to come."
The Rector of Birmingham will
repeat his address on "Christian
Love, Friendship, and Marriage" at
4:15 p.m. in Mem Aud. He gave the
lecture on Monday, but a lengthy
petition precipitated a repeat per
formance.
Canon Green's third lecture will
be given to 600 men of the Air
ROTC at 3:15 p.m. in Mem Aud.
During World War 11, Canon Green
spoke to many service units.
Besides the lectures, he will dine
at residences, and will hold discus
sions at closed meetings of the off
campus men and women, Lagunita,
and the Dclt house.
Yesterday, Canon Green led a dis
cussion at the "Y" luncheon, held a
4" 15 bull session at the Women's
Clubhouse, dined with the women
of Russell House, and answered
questions at Brannor and at Toyon.
Canon Green will be on campus
until 4 p.m. tomorrow, but he will
not make any addresses after today.
He is holding tomorrow open for
personal consultation.
Last night at Excom, Canon Green
presented the official greetings of
tse students of Birmingham Uni
versity to the students of Stanford.
Canon Green was clected warden of
the student guild, a position which
goes to a respectable citizen of Bir
mingham every three years.
"One of my duties," joked Canon
Green, "is to censor the humor rag
which the students put out once a
year. This I must do anonymously.
Otherwise, many pious churchmen
should be thoroughly shocked that
their respectable rector was letting
all those questionable jokes get in
the magazine."
