WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (UP) â€”
The Senate by a narrow one-vote
margin today approved the heart of
a Republican substitute for the hot
ly disputed Bricker amendment af
ter being told it was "acceptable" to
President Eisenhower.
The vote was 44 to 43.
The provision, last of a three
part substitute to be approved by
the Senate, would change Article
Six of the Constitution to provide
that no treaty shall become the
supreme law of the land "unless
made in pursuance of this Con
stitution."
Meanwhile, Clarence Mani on ,
chairman of the President's inter
governmental relations commission,
announced he had been "fired" by
the White House because of his sup
port of the controversial amendment
sponsored by Sen. John W. Bricker
(R.. O.).
The proposal approved today was
sponsored by Senate Republican
leaders and would strike out the so
called "which clause" of the original
Bricker amendment.
