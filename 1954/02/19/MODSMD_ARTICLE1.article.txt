## Christianity—An Awareness Of the Living God in Christ 
### 
Canon Bryan Green concluded his series on "Basic Christianity"
last night before 2,100 persons in Memorial Church by explaining
"what keeps a man from faith."
"How does Christian experience differ from other religious
experiences?
"The heart of it is that Christianity is an awareness of the living

God in Christ as absolute master and j
as theand as the final succor.
"A Christian experience is some- j
thing you discover; you don't j
achieve it by an act of will. God |
must achieve it. You must always
keep the line of communication open :
between you and God, and you must
stand in His way. But you cannot
achieve faith. You can only make
yourself as open to it as you can. j
God will achieve it.
"There are two qualities about
the Christian encounter with God.
We must meet Him as an absolute
demand. When we meet Christ,
we see what we ought to he. At
that moment, we become a sin
ner. Because the perfection of Je
sus is so much more than we will
ever achieve. This is why the real
Christian feels his imperfections.
"And so we despair because, we
say, how could we be like Christ?
At that same moment, we find final
succor and forgiveness. In one sense,
He throws us down; on the other, He
lifts us up as we are—with all our
imperfections and sins. That is what
the Christian experience is.
"The Christian experience comes
to us in different ways. To some it
comes dramatically. To others, grad
ually. Still others are brought up in
the solid training of real Christian
homes.
"You say, 'I would like to become
a Christian. Why can't I get there?'
"There is one group which is |
not yet ready. To you, I say use !
your mind. Make honest intcllcc
tual inquiry. Keep your connnuni- i
cations with God open. Pray, 'Oh,
God, I don't know whether I be
lieve in you or not, hut if you are I
there let me know it.' \
"There is a second group. You are
ready, and you know you are, but
deep within your heart you are not
willing. It appeals to your reason;
it stirs up your emotion; and so the
battle is in the will.
"It's like diving off a board at
night when you don't know whether
there's any water t in the pool. It
takes an act of faith. There's always
that possibility that there's no water
in the pool or that there is no Christ,
and so the plunge off the board takes
an act of faith.
"You remember the Biblical, story
about Jonah? The men were rowing
a boat in a stormy sea, and Jonah
was in the boat. And as soon as they
threw Jonah out of the boat, the
sea was calm.
And so it is with us. We have
Jonahs in our hearts, sins that we
must throw out before our sea is
calm.
"There arc several Jonahs I
could name. One of them is fear—
the fear that you don't want to be
different from what you now arc.
If you deal with Christ it takes all
of you, and we arc frightened to
let Christ lake all of us.
"It might be the Jonah of a hatred
or ambition or pride.
"You must throw your Jonahs
overboard. But just because you've
thrown your Jonahs overboard, this
doesn't mean you've achieved God.
If you think you have achieved God
by your own self-centered effort,
then you still haven't, because you
did it. And God must find you. You
must do more than throw your Jo
nahs overboard.
"You must let Jesus on board.
It's that acceptance of God's love
that makes a man a Christian."

"And so we despair because, we
say, how could we be like Christ?
At that same moment, we find final
succor and forgiveness. In one sense,
He throws us down; on the other, He
lifts us up as we are—with all our
imperfections and sins. That is what
the Christian experience is.
"The Christian experience comes
to us in different ways. To some it
comes dramatically. To others, grad
ually. Still others are brought up in
the solid training of real Christian
homes.
"You say, 'I would like to become
a Christian. Why can't I get there?'
"There is one group which is |
not yet ready. To you, I say use !
your mind. Make honest intcllcc
tual inquiry. Keep your connnuni- i
cations with God open. Pray, 'Oh,
God, I don't know whether I be
lieve in you or not, hut if you are I
there let me know it.' \
"There is a second group. You are
ready, and you know you are, but
deep within your heart you are not
willing. It appeals to your reason;
it stirs up your emotion; and so the
battle is in the will.
"It's like diving off a board at
night when you don't know whether
there's any water t in the pool. It
takes an act of faith. There's always
that possibility that there's no water
in the pool or that there is no Christ,
and so the plunge off the board takes
an act of faith.
"You remember the Biblical, story
about Jonah? The men were rowing
a boat in a stormy sea, and Jonah
was in the boat. And as soon as they
threw Jonah out of the boat, the
sea was calm.
And so it is with us. We have
Jonahs in our hearts, sins that we
must throw out before our sea is
calm.
"There arc several Jonahs I
could name. One of them is fear—
the fear that you don't want to be
different from what you now arc.
If you deal with Christ it takes all
of you, and we arc frightened to
let Christ lake all of us.
"It might be the Jonah of a hatred
or ambition or pride.
"You must throw your Jonahs
overboard. But just because you've
thrown your Jonahs overboard, this
doesn't mean you've achieved God.
If you think you have achieved God
by your own self-centered effort,
then you still haven't, because you
did it. And God must find you. You
must do more than throw your Jo
nahs overboard.
"You must let Jesus on board.
It's that acceptance of God's love
that makes a man a Christian."
Canon Bryan Green concluded his series on "Basic Christianity"
last night before 2,100 persons in Memorial Church by explaining
"what keeps a man from faith."
"How does Christian experience differ from other religious
experiences?
"The heart of it is that Christianity is an awareness of the living

God in Christ as absolute master and j
as theand as the final succor.
"A Christian experience is some- j
thing you discover; you don't j
achieve it by an act of will. God |
must achieve it. You must always
keep the line of communication open :
between you and God, and you must
stand in His way. But you cannot
achieve faith. You can only make
yourself as open to it as you can. j
God will achieve it.
"There are two qualities about
the Christian encounter with God.
We must meet Him as an absolute
demand. When we meet Christ,
we see what we ought to he. At
that moment, we become a sin
ner. Because the perfection of Je
sus is so much more than we will
ever achieve. This is why the real
Christian feels his imperfections.
