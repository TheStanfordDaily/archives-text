# Stanford Skiers Swarm To Sierra Snow Resorts
## 
### 
Stanford skiers will move en
masse this weekend to the newly
covered Sierra slopes for three days
of snow activities. Most of the
mountain-bound crew are going in
private groups as there are no
scheduled Ski Club activities for the
Washington's Birthday weekend.
One hundred and six frosh will
load buses this weekend and take
off for Soda Springs. Here there
will be daytime skiing and evening
dancing and activities such as snow
fights and snow man contests.
Special rates will be offered the
frosh on all tows, lessons, and for
ski equipment. Freshmen may take
advantage of the free "ski corral"
lessons to be given each morning.
On Saturday night., the Ski Patrol
will lead a torch parade down the
big Soda Springs slope, forming a
large red Stanford "S."
Special rates will be offered to all
Stanford Ski Club members at
Squaw Valley, Dodge Ridge, and
Soda Springs. To lake advantage of
I these rates, skiers must present
their Ski Club cards.
