Alto Unified School District to keep
beer- and wine-selling establish
ments at least a mile and a half

one step nearer success yesterday

peal in San Francisco ruled that two
Middlefteld Road establishments are
too close to Stanford and should not
have been granted licenses.
The two establishments arc the
Bungalow Market and Ehrich's
Market, at 2775 and 2849 Middle
field Road, across from the Hoo

peal the decision to the State Su
preme Court. The board's district

said, "The decision is up to the legal
department in Sacramento."
