# Big Four Plan April 26 Korean Peace Parley
## French on the Move Red China to Sit In on Conference 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 18 (UP)—The Big
Four agreed today at the end of
their otherwise fruitless Berlin
meeting to hold a Korean and Indo
chinese peace conference with Red
China and other belligerents at Ge
neva starting April 26.
The agreement marked for Com
munist China the chance to step
onto the international diplomatic
stage in a leading role for the first
time since Chiang Kai-shek was
driven from the mainland in 1949.
The United States, Russian, Brit
ish and French foreign ministers
wound up their four-week debate
here with a joint announcement of
the Switzerland conference but ac
knowledged an East-West deadlock
on Germany, Austria, and European
security.
The final communique also an
nounced that the Big Four at some
unspecified date would continue "an
exchange of views" on the question
of disarmament.
The agreement on the Korean and
lndochinese peace conference was
completed only today at the final
secret session of the ministers. Ac
tually, it called for two separate sets
of talks, one on Korea, the other on
Indochina.
Whether they will be held at the
same time, or whether Korea will
come first and Indochina will be
left dependent on the results of thfe
first consultations was not made
clear.
Sitting in on the Korean confer
ence will be the Big Four, Commu
nist China, North and South Korea,
and any other United Nations mem
ber whose troops fought in Korea
and which wants to be represented.

from the military to the diplomatic front today as Communist field action mysteriously slack

Hanoi and Saigon that Viet Minh or Communist Chinese emissaries are in Indochina to discuss
an armistice. —NEA Telephoto
