# Lights Blow Out In Toyon, Branner
## 
### 
Early morning risers did not rise
as early as usual in Toyon and
Branner yesterday, at least not if
they depended on their electric
alarm clocks.
Failure of a primary cutout pu!
one phase of a three-phase line out
of commission.
Corp Yard electricians hypothe
sized that the trouble could be
traced to steam entering the cutout
vault from another nearby manhole,
Other circuits not immediately af
fected were off for nearly 40 min
utes while repairs were being made
The area covered includes Toyon
Branner, the eating clubs, and the
Encina pools.
