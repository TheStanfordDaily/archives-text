# Bryan Green and Stanford
##

Bryan Green finished his lecture series on
"Basic Christianity" last night and today is end
ing his week's visit to Stanford with personal
conferences with individual students.
Before he leaves Stanford, we would like to
add a few words to the millions which have
been spoken this week about Bryan Green, his
ideas, and his faith.
We are aware that the reaction to Bryan
Green has not been universal among all the
students at Stanford.
Some have Questioned his presence here.
Some have questioned the "emotional effect"
of his lectures on the students. Some have
questioned the Daily's "gushing enthusiasm"
in reporting Bryan Green's lectures and dis
cussions.
P
Many have been indifferent to his presence
here. Many have not found the time, interest,
or need to hear Bryan Green. Many have
missed his leciures not because they were
lurned away from Memorial Auditorium but
because they simply did not want to attend.
Most, we believe, have approved of Bryan

Green's presence at Stanford. It has been dif
ficult to measure the indifference or the adverse
reaction to Bryan Green's lectures. But it has
not been difficult to realize that interest in those
lectures has been high and that student respect
for Bryan Green has been strong. When ap
proximately 2,000 students attend his nightly
lectures and many have to be turned away,
" when those who attend listen intently to his
words and leave quietly at his request, that in
terest and respect seems obvious to us.
Speaking for ourselves, and, we believe, for
the majority of the students of Stanford, we ex
tend our sincere appreciation and gratitude to
him.
He demanded honesty of us, and by that de
mand encouraged us to be honest with our
selves. He challenged us to study our "experi
ence," and by that challenge encouraged us to
search for our own "hypothesis," our meaning
for life.
And, again, he presented his own ideas and
faith so effectively that we could not avoid
thinking deeply about our own.
For that alone, we thank him.
