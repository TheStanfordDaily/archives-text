On iirvari Green and Emotion

To the Editor:
I wa.s amused and at the same time disturbed by the
letter which you published yesterday. The one that
expressed the uneasiness of three females.
It seems that ( two things are bothering them:
(1) Bryan Green is an evangelist, and (2) students'
emotions are being affected.
In answer t.o number one—Bryan has said from his
first lecture that he is here on a mission and not
just on a good-wili trip from England.
A 1; far as number two goes, I can see nothing wrong
with stirring up the emotions of our campus. There
are a lot of us students who are glad that we have
been aroused. Whether or not we agree with Canon
Green is not as important as the fact that he has
been presenting Christianity to us in a different light.
Il< has shown us a way to study and decide What we

believe and to kr.ow Why we believe it.
It seems to me that the only persons who should
be worried about getting their emotions stirred would
be those who have their ideas based on such shallow
reasoning that they fear they might be wrong if
they look at their beliefs objectively. If these are the
ones who are afraid then I say it is good—they should
be afraid for they may be forced to learn something
about what they believe.
Those why know what they believe, regardless of
what it is, have nothing more to worry about than
a person who is taking a test on a course in which
he is sure of the subject matter.
1 am aware that Canon Green is on a mission, and
my emotions have been affected; 1 am glad as are
many of my fellow Stanford students.

hi Praise of the 'Advertising'

In reply to Mr. Metcalf's letter of "Gushing Enthus
iasm? in the Feb. 18 paper, 1 quite disagree with him
that Bryan Green was "as commercially advertised
his religion." The advertising which preceded his
visit to our campus was quite normal as advertising
oes, with the common number of posters, one ban
i it which blew down in three hours, pamphlets tell
in!; something about him and his schedule, and aijli
cles in The Daily.
No, instead of criticizing the advertising I would
like to praise it lor its restraint, and proper coverage
of this religious figure's visit to Stanford. The Daily
reported on the visit, and did a remarkably good
job on it. for its importance as a news event: for
'hiring this past week the Canon's remark:-; have
been the main center of discussion and interest on

c
campus! The coverage on the series of lectures was
quite proper, for il was here that most of Stanford
and some of Palo Alto were focusing their interest,
and for a news event, the Canon's talks were of ob
vious importance, and could not be dismissed because
of content or subject matter.
Gushing enthusiasm?—l have not seen any of this
displayed in The Daily or any other place, but in
stead I have seen a precise, exact coverage of a
series of lectures which have brought the message
of ''Basic Christianity" to this campus. I can only
commend The Daily for a fine job of reporting the
news on campus, which this past week has been
definitely centered on the Canon from Birmingham,
England.

Found: A Wallet and Honesty

To the Editor:
I oclay I had an experience which may revive faith
n the honesty of Stanford students. When I could
not locate my wallet this afternoon, I returned home
to search for it, only to be informed by my roommate

that a student, who had discovered it in one of the
parking areas, had returned it to our residence. Un
fortunately his name and address are unknown to me,
and I therefore take this avenue to express my ap
preciation, MARIANNA OIJVISTEAD
