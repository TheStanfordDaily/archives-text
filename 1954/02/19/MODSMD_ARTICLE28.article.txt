# Alpiners to Leave On Weekend Trips
## 
### 
Three groups of the Stanford Al
pine Club will leave for weekend
trips today.
One group will go to Ostrander, a
mountain southeast of Badger Pass,
Yosemite, where it will make a
nine-mile pack trek on skis to the
Ostrander cabin and spend the
weekend ski touring.
Preparations for this trip were
made by running a practice week
end ski tour two weeks ago, during
which skiers had to pass ski tests.
For those not joining the Ostran
der tour, there will be two rock
climbing trips—one to Quien Sabo,
east of Hollister, and one to Pin
nacles National Monument, south of
Hollister.
The three groups will return to
campus Monday night.
