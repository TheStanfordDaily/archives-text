# Injury Riddled Braves Play 2
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
San Jose Junior College and Cali
fornia Concordia College invade the
Pavilion today and tomorrow af
ternoon to challenge the injury-rid
den Braves. Both games will start
at 3:15.
Normally, Coach George Lynn's
squad could be counted on to breeze
past San Jose and Concordia. How
ever, with three key Stanford play
ers on the injury list, anything can
happen in the games.
Aggressive Bill Tarr, a hard
driving guard, suffered a hand in
jury in practice which will keep
him out of the game. Boh Mc-
Xxrouther is out for the rest of the
season with an illness.
Forward John Hendricks, leading
scorer of the Braves, will suit up for
the games, but it is very doubtful
that he will see any action.
Lynn announced yesterday that
the starting line-up for the Braves
would consist of Jerry Gustafson and
Dave Dunn at forwards, Jack Mc-
Grath at center, and Bob Milton and
Bob Heirs at the guard positions.
