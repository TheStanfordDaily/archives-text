# Philippine Student Tells About Island Traditions
## 
### ELLEN MANN 
"I wish more students tfrom
all over the world could be
given this opportunity to see for
themselves what ihe other side
of their world is, because know
ing other peoples and under
standing their way of thinking
can accomplish more in a quar
ter than what the United Nations
could ever hope to fulfill in
years."
Luisita Sandoval ended a very de
lightful and informative cnal about,
her homeland, the Philippine Is
lands, with this comment Monday
night when she met with the girls
of Manzanita and The Oaks. The
purpose of the meeting was to ac
quaint the members of the living

v,roups with Sita, a Cap and Gown-
ASSU Scholar who is living at Un
ion Residence this quarter.
Sita told of a nalion comprised of
7,000 islands—a land of rippling rice
fields, high mountains, and coconut
painis. She described the wide
beaches and the warm sea, and
when the audience was completely
enchanted by the native paradise
she took them on a verbal tour of
the modern, sophisticated city that
is also a part of the Philippine Is
lands life.
Sita talked of the difficulties of
organizing a land with such a heter
ogeneous background and the suc
cess of the established government.
She made a brief reference to the
national culture and the foreign in
fluences, Asiatic and Spanish, that
helped mold its early character.
Due to the Spanish influence 80 to
85 per cent of the people are Catho
lic; the rest, however, are either
Protestants, Aglipayans (a native
religion), or Mohammedans. Their
old alphabet was of Sanscrit type,
a composite of Asiatic characters.
To the delight of her audience,
Sita explained the ancient marriage
customs and the ceremony. It was
considered improper for a suitor to
speak directly to the girl of his
choice; instead, he used a "middle
man." At the appointed time he
made himself known and hoped to
be accepted.
The ccrcmouy began when the
bride was carried on the shoulders
of a man to the groom's house.
Before she entered the home she
had to feign shyness and would
not budge until her father-in-law
properly coaxed her with gifts. It
is still the custom today for the
groom to pay for wedding ex
penses, even down to the thank
you notes.
Sita spoke of the Japanese occu
pation during the war. The slogan
of the "conquerors" was "Asia for
the Asiatics"; hence, all Western in
fluence was boycotted.

She made a brief reference to the
national culture and the foreign in
fluences, Asiatic and Spanish, that
helped mold its early character.
Due to the Spanish influence 80 to
85 per cent of the people are Catho
lic; the rest, however, are either
Protestants, Aglipayans (a native
religion), or Mohammedans. Their
old alphabet was of Sanscrit type,
a composite of Asiatic characters.
To the delight of her audience,
Sita explained the ancient marriage
customs and the ceremony. It was
considered improper for a suitor to
speak directly to the girl of his
choice; instead, he used a "middle
man." At the appointed time he
made himself known and hoped to
be accepted.
The ccrcmouy began when the
bride was carried on the shoulders
of a man to the groom's house.
Before she entered the home she
had to feign shyness and would
not budge until her father-in-law
properly coaxed her with gifts. It
is still the custom today for the
groom to pay for wedding ex
penses, even down to the thank
you notes.
Sita spoke of the Japanese occu
pation during the war. The slogan
of the "conquerors" was "Asia for
the Asiatics"; hence, all Western in
fluence was boycotted.

"I wish more students tfrom
all over the world could be
given this opportunity to see for
themselves what ihe other side
of their world is, because know
ing other peoples and under
standing their way of thinking
can accomplish more in a quar
ter than what the United Nations
could ever hope to fulfill in
years."
Luisita Sandoval ended a very de
lightful and informative cnal about,
her homeland, the Philippine Is
lands, with this comment Monday
night when she met with the girls
of Manzanita and The Oaks. The
purpose of the meeting was to ac
quaint the members of the living

v,roups with Sita, a Cap and Gown-
ASSU Scholar who is living at Un
ion Residence this quarter.
Sita told of a nalion comprised of
7,000 islands—a land of rippling rice
fields, high mountains, and coconut
painis. She described the wide
beaches and the warm sea, and
when the audience was completely
enchanted by the native paradise
she took them on a verbal tour of
the modern, sophisticated city that
is also a part of the Philippine Is
lands life.
Sita talked of the difficulties of
organizing a land with such a heter
ogeneous background and the suc
cess of the established government.
