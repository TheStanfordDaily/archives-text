# NEW COURSE
## California History Will Be Offered Spring Quarter 
### 
A new course—"The History
of California"—will be offered
by Stanford's History Depart
ment next quarter.
According to department head
Thomas A. Bailey, this is the
first time in about 30 years that
such a course has been given.
The course, to be held at noon on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for
three units, will be conducted by
Dr. Don E. Fehrenbacher. who was
appointed last fall as acting assistant
professor of history. Fehrenbacher
plans to emphasize California's re
cent history and cover the mission
ary and gold-rush days only briefly.
He says he hopes to show the
state as an "economic province"
and to deal with current questions
such as population influx and ra
cial minority groups.
Fehrenbacher plans to give
"heavy attention" to the Southern
Pacific era (1870-1900) in California
and to consider the men dominant
in politics at that time, one of whom
was Senator Leland Stanford. The
course will cover the state's history
up through the post-war years.
Before coming to Stanford, Feh
renbacher taught at Roosevelt Col
lege in Chicago and for four years at
Coe College in lowa. He did under
graduate work at Cornell College,
lowa, and received his Master's and
doctorate from the University of
Chicago.
At present he is writing a book
on an Illinois figure and teaching
American Constitutional History.
Last, quarter he taught the West
ward Movement.
Fchrcnbacher says lie now has
"no idea" of the number of stu
dents the course will draw, but
plans to order about .'lO texts. lie
hopes to use the discussion meth
od in class if enrollment is small
enough. It will be a "pilot"
course," be predicts, in which
"we'll be feeling our way
through."
The 33-year-old, dark-haired pro
fessor is married and has three chil
dren. He resides in Palo Alto with
his family.
