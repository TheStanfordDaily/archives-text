# Ram's Head Scores Two Hits, a Miss
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
Ram's Head scored on twr
out of three plays at last night's
Winter One-Acts opening, with
a comedy that was genuinely
comic, a drama that was engros
singly dramatic, and a so-called j
"serious comedy" that was, dev-1
astatingly, neither.
The comedy, Russell M. Howard's
"Molly and Me," is sort of an ani
mated comic-strip, set up in a farci
cal never-never land of secret mar
riages, preposterous mix-ups, and
last minute reprieves, a world popu
lated by a weird and wonderful
band of lunatics.
The plot — some trite nonsense
about a secretly married Miss
America candidate, her husband's
crackpot invention, and assorted
swindlers that descend upon them—
is fortunately not allowed to inter
fere with the fun.
Alice MiddlckaulT as Molly leers
nicely, but the show really belongs
to the eccentrics. Richie Meyer
struts, grimaces, and has a gen
erally wonderful time as Jon. lie
is aided especially by Paul Miller's
Milquetoastish Mr. Kinsey and
Bucket Christcnscn's marvelously
imbecile Mrs. Kinsey.
James Arnold's "The Sheriff'' is a
much more complex and ambitious
work. It is the story of a man, a
frontier-town sheriff, who is forced
to choose between his conscience
and his law. He chooses the law and
is made a, sacrifice to it. The author
has something to say about justice
and expediency, and he says it with
great power.
The play is not perfcct. There is
an unfortunate tendency toward
staginess, toward random moraliz
ing, and toward unnecessary melo
drama. But defects are to be ex
pected. What is not to be expected
is the ambition and depth of this

work. "The Sheriff" may not be a
fuily satisfying play, but it is one
which demands interest and respect.
MeniM Johnson does a highly
competent, if slightly over
.wrought, job as the sheriff. As
' Pete, Hugh Roberts brings the
play a certain easy-going natural
ism it might otherwise have
lacked.
Lee Mendelson's "The Intrusion,"
hilled as a "serious comedy," is a
high school farce veneered with a
| thin layer of self-conscious plati
tudes.
When Margie Twiddle, a philo
sophical My-Friend-Irma type, en
ters the Selover Produce Company,
the boss is a l>east, the secretaries
an- miserable, and the whole office
is "lied up with dollar signs instead
of feelings." But after thirty min
utes of homely moralizing—"Every
body is looking for success; nobody
! has fun anymore"—and low comedy,
the abashed boss says "please" to otic
of »lir secretaries, and everybody
feels like a good happy cry.
All this is, of course, no more
\ fantastic than "Molly and Me." but
"The Intrusion" apparently takes it
self seriously. The Ram's Head pro
duction, by concentrating on the
obviou: farce, manages to squeeze
on' .1 few amusing sccncs. but the
play gets little aid from the constant
over-exaggeration of its cast.
On the whole, the Winter One-
Acts make for a thoroughly enjoy
able, if not scintillating, evening.

James Arnold's "The Sheriff'' is a
much more complex and ambitious
work. It is the story of a man, a
frontier-town sheriff, who is forced
to choose between his conscience
and his law. He chooses the law and
is made a, sacrifice to it. The author
has something to say about justice
and expediency, and he says it with
great power.
The play is not perfcct. There is
an unfortunate tendency toward
staginess, toward random moraliz
ing, and toward unnecessary melo
drama. But defects are to be ex
pected. What is not to be expected
is the ambition and depth of this

work. "The Sheriff" may not be a
fuily satisfying play, but it is one
which demands interest and respect.
MeniM Johnson does a highly
competent, if slightly over
.wrought, job as the sheriff. As
' Pete, Hugh Roberts brings the
play a certain easy-going natural
ism it might otherwise have
lacked.
Lee Mendelson's "The Intrusion,"
hilled as a "serious comedy," is a
high school farce veneered with a
| thin layer of self-conscious plati
tudes.
When Margie Twiddle, a philo
sophical My-Friend-Irma type, en
ters the Selover Produce Company,
the boss is a l>east, the secretaries
an- miserable, and the whole office
is "lied up with dollar signs instead
of feelings." But after thirty min
utes of homely moralizing—"Every
body is looking for success; nobody
! has fun anymore"—and low comedy,
the abashed boss says "please" to otic
of »lir secretaries, and everybody
feels like a good happy cry.
All this is, of course, no more
\ fantastic than "Molly and Me." but
"The Intrusion" apparently takes it
self seriously. The Ram's Head pro
duction, by concentrating on the
obviou: farce, manages to squeeze
on' .1 few amusing sccncs. but the
play gets little aid from the constant
over-exaggeration of its cast.
On the whole, the Winter One-
Acts make for a thoroughly enjoy
able, if not scintillating, evening.
Ram's Head scored on twr
out of three plays at last night's
Winter One-Acts opening, with
a comedy that was genuinely
comic, a drama that was engros
singly dramatic, and a so-called j
"serious comedy" that was, dev-1
astatingly, neither.
The comedy, Russell M. Howard's
"Molly and Me," is sort of an ani
mated comic-strip, set up in a farci
cal never-never land of secret mar
riages, preposterous mix-ups, and
last minute reprieves, a world popu
lated by a weird and wonderful
band of lunatics.
The plot — some trite nonsense
about a secretly married Miss
America candidate, her husband's
crackpot invention, and assorted
swindlers that descend upon them—
is fortunately not allowed to inter
fere with the fun.
Alice MiddlckaulT as Molly leers
nicely, but the show really belongs
to the eccentrics. Richie Meyer
struts, grimaces, and has a gen
erally wonderful time as Jon. lie
is aided especially by Paul Miller's
Milquetoastish Mr. Kinsey and
Bucket Christcnscn's marvelously
imbecile Mrs. Kinsey.
