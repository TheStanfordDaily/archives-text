### BILL WRIGHT 
Stanford's sometimes hot but more often cold basketball quintet
collides with the awesome, talent-loaded UCLA Bruins in the Pa
vilion tonight, opening a two-game holiday get.
Game time is 8:30 both tonight and tomorrow.
The recently aroused Bruins, who have moved from the bottom
iof the Pacific Coast Conference
standings to a first-place tie in two

weeks, invade at full strength and
.full steam.
Coach Johnny Wooden's high
scoring outfit has nabbed five con
secutive contests, including a pair
from the Indians two weeks ago in
Westwood, after dropping its first
three league starts.
The Bruins figure they need a
sweep against the Cards this week- [
end to keep even with California, j
which laces t. .ird-place USC.
Stanford also needs a sweep of the j
series—if it wants to move out of I

the PCC cellar.
Past performance is all in UCLA's j
favor. The always-running Bruins,
who tore Cal apart witii their fast
break offense last week, are the
deadliest shooting, highest scoring
five in the league.
Stanford held UCLA in check for
three quarters in their previous
meetings, but the Cards were routed
in the final stanza both nights. The
Bruins won, 92-73 and 77-58.
Then last weekend the Bruins
caught confident, unsuspecting Cal
in their Westwood slaughter house
and whipped the Bears twice.
What chance do the Cards have |
of spoiling the assault of the
cbamrionship - minded Bruins?
Coach Bob Burnett says,"The ]
Bruins are just too strong for us. i
I see little hope."
Any hope Stanford does, have of |
slowing up the Bruins rests with


GEORGE SELLECK
—The deft-passing playmakcr
I George Selleck, the deft - passing
playmaker with the zeroed-in jump
shot, and Russ Lawler, the lanky
pivotman who leads the division in
j scoring.
But the Indian stars will have a
' tough job on their hands if they
; hope to dent the Uclan defenses.
Wee Willie Naulls, the huge hulk
| of a center who handcuffed and out
lebounded Cal's Bob McKeen last
| week, will be trying to put the
damper on Lawler's smooth-flowing
! southpaw hooks.
And the roundman who makes
the Bruins click, captain Ron Liv
ingston, will he around to plague
Selleck. Livingston. a 5-10 hall
handler of the Selleck. Boh Ma
| theny school, is the highest scor
ing hoopster in UCLA history.
Not only will Selleck and Lawler
! have to neutralize the effect of Liv
[ ingston and Naulls, but they will
j have to outshine them as well if
j Stanford is to stay in the game.
UCLA has four or five other stars
I who can outdo anybody else the
Cards put on the court. Don Bragg,
Johnny Moore, and Ron Bane—all
terrors on the boards and dead shots
) from the floor—will round out the
I Bruin starting five.
Burnett will counter with improv
ing Dave Epperson at forward, hus
tling Oleg Suzdaleff at guard, and
i driving Don DeLong at forward.
