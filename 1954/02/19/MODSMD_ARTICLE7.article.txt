# Drive for Blood Sign-ups to End
## 
### 
Today is the last day of the drive â– 
to sign up students to donate blood [
in the three blood drives scheduled j
for the near future.
Three drives rather than one large I
one are being held this year to fa- j
cilitate Red Cross collection of
blood. It also is hoped that this
method of collection will better fill
the demand for blood, which re
quires a steady, continuous supply.
The first drive will be held Thurs
day and Friday. Others will be held
on April 21, 22, 23, and May 20, 21.
Twenty - five pints of the blood
collected in the drives will go to a
blood fund at Mills Hospital in San
Mateo where it serves as a reserve
for Stanford students.
The rest of the blood is handed
over to the Department of Defense
which stock-piles it in plasma form.
Type "O" blood is refrigerated and
shipped whole to military hospitals
in Japan.

Blood drive representatives in
campus living groups are asked to
collect appointment cards distrib
uted to their house members and
to turn them in this afternoon.
Th';y may be returned to the re
gional representative, to the boxes
at the Cellar and Li be, or to the
Cardinals ollice between 2 and 5
p.m.
Confirmations of appointments
made this week will be sent by mail
to students within 10 days of the
date of their appointment.
The blood drive cpmmittee re
quests that .students approximate
the hours they prefer for appoint
ments to donate in the spring quar
ter drives, even though they do not
now know what their schedule will
be.
According to blood drive officials,
adjustments can be made later if a
student specifies a time and then
requests a change.
