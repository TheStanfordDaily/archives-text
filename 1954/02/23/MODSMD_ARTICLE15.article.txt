SPRING PREVlEW—Washington's Birthday meant skiing for
many students, but here on campus the accent was on sunshine
and spring. On the left, Lake Lag shows promise of good swim

raising the water level. On the riqht, an unidentified studen
takes advantage of the holiday to spend some extra time at the
Library—sleeping on the lawn.
