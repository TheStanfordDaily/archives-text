# University's TV Series Postponed
## 
### 
Stanford has postponed plans for
a 13-week television program based
on the Constitution in order to make
the program available for KQED,
the proposed Bay Area educational
TV station.
KQED probably will not be on
the air until spring, too late to con
clude the program series before
Stanford begins summer recess.
The program, to be based on the
Stanford Press publication, "Your
Rugged Constitution," is expected
to start in mid-October. It will be
directed by Stanley T. Donner of
the Stanford Speech and Drama
Department.
The scries is made possible by an
$8,000 grant to the University from
the National Association of Educa
tion.
