handling of Communists."
Stevens was to have appeared bc

The subcommittee today released

ordered by higher authorities.
McCarthy finally asked him i£
any general who issued an honoi
able discharge to a known Com
munist shouldn't he removed from
the Army. Zwicker said that
should not be the case if the gen
eral were acting under "compe
tent orders." lie said he himself
was acting on an ollicial order to
discharge Peress.
At that point McCarthy declared:
"You should be removed from
command. Any man who has been
given the honor of being promoted
to general and who says, 'I will pin
tect another general who protected
Communists,' is not fit to wear that
uniform, general."
Zwicker later said lie was totally
unprepared for McCarthy's criti
cism. "I'm in full agreement with
what he is trying to do," the gen
eral said, "but there's a way of do
ing it."
