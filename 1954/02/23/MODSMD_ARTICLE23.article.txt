# Conferences and Clarification
## 
### 
The Berlin Conference of Foreign Ministers
ended last week as most observers expected—
without East-West agreement on the questions
of German unification and an Austrian peace
treaty.
In summarizing the results of the conference,
it would appear to some that the efforts of the
Big Four were a waste of time, that the only
effect of the 26 days of meetings was a clarifica
tion of cold-war problems and East-West differ
ences.
But we believe that the Biq Four Confer
ence was not a complete lailure. In spite of
absence of agreement on European ques
tions, the conference was at least successful
in the followinq respects:
1. Both the East and the West were able to
clarify their respective positions on European
affairs. Russia now knows more clearly that
the Western nations will not compromise their
basic proposals and policy on European affairs.
The West, in turn, now has an up-to-date knowl
edge of Soviet Russia's position and policy for

Europe. That knowledge may be used by West
ern governments in forming future policies.
2. The foreign ministers agreed to another
conference in Geneva on April 26 to consider
affairs in the Far East, with emphasis on the
Korea and Indochina questions. The West
agreed to the admission of Red China to the
Geneva conference table and thus opened an
other area of doubt for clarification. At that
conference, the West will again understand
more clearly the Soviet position—this time in
Asia. And for the first time, the West will get
a glimpse of the attitudes of Red China as a
participant in Big Five discussions.
As a result of the Berlin Conference, such
clarification has been achieved. And the
Geneva Conference should, at least, yield
the same result.
For this alone, we think the Berlin Confer
ence was justified. And we look forward to the
Geneva Conference as a step for further clari
fication of the positions of the East and the
West. o
