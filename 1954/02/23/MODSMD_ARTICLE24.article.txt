## An Open Answer 
### 
To the Editor:
Open answer to an anonymous letter.
I have received an anonymous letter. One that
tells me to go home, because of my letter to the
editor in The Daily for Feb. 18.
Unknown Antagonist:
Didn't you have the guts to answer me openly
through The Daily? If not, why didn't you give me
your name so I could have answered you directly
and saved you from this humiliation?
You say that "it ill behooves me to criticize your
government as I did." I wasn't exactly criticizing
your government. I was merely trying to show how
ridiculous it sounded that, according to an article in
The Daily, 2.200 people had to be fired in order to
get rid of one single Communist. And I was criti
cizing that procedure, in so far as The Daily reported
it. I guess my letter must have been way beyond
your sense of humor.
You think 1 "have a big nerve to accept what is
offered and be here, taking the place of another
student who might appreciate this country and
what it offers." I)o you meaa to say that I should
have stayed home because the only thing people
wanted me to do here was praising them? Accord
ing to the ASSU Foreign Scholarship Committee,
one of the main reasons why this scholarship—for
which I cannot strongly enough express my grati
tude and appreciation—was given to me was the
Stanford students desire to hear the opinions and
viewpoints of students from other countries. My
letter to the editor was one of those opinions.
I consider the Stanford students my friends. And
usually my friends want me to express my criticisms
when I have any. Isn't it that way here?

And then you suggest that I go home! Well, I'll
go home. Next August. And I'll tell people back in
Denmark about my time in. this country. I'll tell
them about great friends and fabulous hospitality.
I'll tell them about people who think and feel and
love their freedom (including the freedom of speech)
exactly like they do themselves. I'll tell them that
I like the Americans —in spite of people like you.
You say there are many here who feel the way
you do. I don't believe you. But if it is true, let me
know who you and they are. Write me an open
letter in The Daily, signed by you and some of them,
or let us meet and talk it over. If I could drag you
out of that swamp of ignorance and lack of under
standing and tact before you drown in it, I would
really feel I had accomplished something here.
You say I "have presented one more case why
people in this country (many of them) do not do
more for the needy people of Europe." What a
unique example of bad taste you're displaying!
You are presenting one more case to show why
many people in Europe wish thc'v had ac
cepted anything from this country! The aid was a
necessary bulwark against Communism, but it be
came less popular as it was followed by humilia
tions like your statement.
You say you owe me nothing. How wrong you are!
You owe me to stand up and show me your face.
And show me and everyone else who cares to know,
that your opinions can be expressed with a signature
under them, too. And you owe me either an excuse
or a better reason why you feel justified in having
the nerve to tell me to go home.
Do something to wipe out the ugly sensation your
letter gave me. NIELS U. VINDING

tude and appreciation—was given to me was the
Stanford students desire to hear the opinions and
viewpoints of students from other countries. My
letter to the editor was one of those opinions.
I consider the Stanford students my friends. And
usually my friends want me to express my criticisms
when I have any. Isn't it that way here?

And then you suggest that I go home! Well, I'll
go home. Next August. And I'll tell people back in
Denmark about my time in. this country. I'll tell
them about great friends and fabulous hospitality.
I'll tell them about people who think and feel and
love their freedom (including the freedom of speech)
exactly like they do themselves. I'll tell them that
I like the Americans —in spite of people like you.
You say there are many here who feel the way
you do. I don't believe you. But if it is true, let me
know who you and they are. Write me an open
letter in The Daily, signed by you and some of them,
or let us meet and talk it over. If I could drag you
out of that swamp of ignorance and lack of under
standing and tact before you drown in it, I would
really feel I had accomplished something here.
You say I "have presented one more case why
people in this country (many of them) do not do
more for the needy people of Europe." What a
unique example of bad taste you're displaying!
You are presenting one more case to show why
many people in Europe wish thc'v had ac
cepted anything from this country! The aid was a
necessary bulwark against Communism, but it be
came less popular as it was followed by humilia
tions like your statement.
You say you owe me nothing. How wrong you are!
You owe me to stand up and show me your face.
And show me and everyone else who cares to know,
that your opinions can be expressed with a signature
under them, too. And you owe me either an excuse
or a better reason why you feel justified in having
the nerve to tell me to go home.
Do something to wipe out the ugly sensation your
letter gave me. NIELS U. VINDING
To the Editor:
Open answer to an anonymous letter.
I have received an anonymous letter. One that
tells me to go home, because of my letter to the
editor in The Daily for Feb. 18.
Unknown Antagonist:
Didn't you have the guts to answer me openly
through The Daily? If not, why didn't you give me
your name so I could have answered you directly
and saved you from this humiliation?
You say that "it ill behooves me to criticize your
government as I did." I wasn't exactly criticizing
your government. I was merely trying to show how
ridiculous it sounded that, according to an article in
The Daily, 2.200 people had to be fired in order to
get rid of one single Communist. And I was criti
cizing that procedure, in so far as The Daily reported
it. I guess my letter must have been way beyond
your sense of humor.
You think 1 "have a big nerve to accept what is
offered and be here, taking the place of another
student who might appreciate this country and
what it offers." I)o you meaa to say that I should
have stayed home because the only thing people
wanted me to do here was praising them? Accord
ing to the ASSU Foreign Scholarship Committee,
one of the main reasons why this scholarship—for
which I cannot strongly enough express my grati
tude and appreciation—was given to me was the
