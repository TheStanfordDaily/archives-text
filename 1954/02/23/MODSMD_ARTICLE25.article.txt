# Security and Stringency

### 
To the Editor:
Mr. Vinding's letter to The Daily of Feb. 18 con
cerning expulsion of some 2.200 federal employees
under the administration's new security program was
rather a disconcerting piece of prose to read. Granted
that his argument is basically a sound one—but:
where is it carried? To judge from his almost
plebeian cynicism, Mr. Vinding has forfeited any and
all faith in the competence of the administration to
work out a suitable policy for the expulsion of "secu
rity risks."
I would be the first to agree that the ultimate end,
lidding the government of Cofnmunists and "fellow
travelers." does not justify such means as firing
wholesale lots of federal employees indiscriminately.
However, it is the aim of the administration not only
to free itself of Communists themselves but also of
potential Communists, i.e., risks to the security of
the government and, indirectly, the nation as a whole.
I think we must all have confidence in the compe
tence ol those officials charged with this duty.

Mr. Vinding remarks that "the security program
succeeded in . . . breaking 2.200 careers!!" Were
they careers or jobs? %
It is my opinion that the security program should
remain extremely stringent. No individual with any
left-wing leanings is necessary to the government—
there are other positions where he can be of some
use but no harm.
I hope that Mr. Vinding will some day adjust his
opinions concerning the usefulness of the security
program. And I also hope he will refrain from his
lamentable ridicule of the program's effectiveness—
unless, of course, he is in a position to conclude from
the political philosophies and activities of the 2,200
that they were unjustly robbed of their "careers."
If he lacks this information indispensable to a fair
conclusion, it seems to me he must rest reasonably
assured that the administration acted with due fore
sight and sagacity. Such inappropriate pseudo-sar
casm ns he employed is quite irrelevant to the facts.
