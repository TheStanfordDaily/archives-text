# 'Emotionally Adjusted'

To the Editor:
In the Campus Opinion column on Thursday, Fob.
18, a letter by Nancy Bickford, Lois Fellows, and
Chris Holdahl left the impression in my mind that
the epithet "evangelist" was being applied to Bryan
Green as a derogation. Without doubt the title has
been by some unworthy persons from time to
time, but Webster still defines "evangelist" as "a
bringer of the gospel"; one who "goes about from
plnce to place preaching at special services to awaken
religious interest." Bryan Green qualifies for the
title in its true sense.
Because of Canon Green's standing as an evangel
ist. students were cautioned to be critical of his logic.
Miqht I say that if Stanford students we're as critical
of some of the worn-out scientific theories, which

they are gullibly absorbing, as they are instructed
to be of the sound logic of Bryan Green, his presence
on the Stanford campus might not be so badly
needed. Bill Metcalf's letter in the same column
should be evidence of the need.
To set the young ladies at ease about the emotional
state of those accepting Canon Green's logic, I have
just received the first returns from a psychological
test measuring the difference between a group of
adults who have received Jesus Christ in the manner
recommended by Bryan Green and a group repi 3-
scnting a "normal" population. The believers {re
shown to be much better adjusted emotionally th in
>the norm group This i.s statistically significant at
the .001 level!!!
