## 
### BARBARA ROCHE 
Aware of the need to increase the understanding of art and to
further develop the Stanford Art Gallery and Museum collections,
the Committee for Art at Stanford has been organized.
The work of the committee is being done independently of the
University's art faculty. It is a volunteer committee of people
interested in art working from out- +

side the University to focus inter
est on the University's art, to stim
ulate and to encourage collectors to
lend works of art for public exhibi
tion, and to increase the permanent
collections of the gallery and mu
seum.
At the present time, according to
Mrs. Robert Cross, associate direc
tor of the art gallery, Stanford's col
lection of Oriental and Egyptian art
is exceptional. There are a few out
standing paintings and there is a
good start on the print collection,
to which are being added modern
prints. However, the classical, Eu
ropean, and modern art collections
need additions.
No funds are appropriated to
the gallery or museum for pur
chasing new art. All additions to
the collection are completely de
pendent unon gifts and loans.
As a part of the committee's pro
gram to enlarge the scope of art and
to broaden community and student
interest in art, a special spring ex
hibit comprised of art owned by
members of the committee will be

shown at the gallery, startifig April
27, entitled "Collectors' Choice."
Mrs. Stanley Morrison of Ather
ton is temporary chairman of the
group. Officers, board of directors,
and committee chairmen will be
elected at the next meeting which
will be held April 27 in connection
with the opening of the exhibit.
