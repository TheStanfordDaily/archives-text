# Frosh End Season, Win Twice
## 
### BOB DURAND 
Stanford's high-flying Papoose cagers concluded a successful
season this weekend as they breezed to easy wins over Lowell
and Santa Rosa High Schools by respective scores of 57-45 and
77-59, in the Pavilion.
The two triumphs give the Frosh a final record of eight wins

and two losses, both of which came
at the hands of the California year
lings. Two contests with the jun
ior varsity were not counted.
Coach Dick Clegg's freshmen had
little trouble in overcoming the two

prep squads as their adaptable of
fense offset Lowell's renowned zone
defense and a stubborn Santa Rosa
man - to - man defense, while their
half-court press stymied the visi
tors' attacks.
Clegg was able to clear the bench
and give everyone a considerable
amount of action both nights. On
Saturday night, the second string,
playing the whole second quarter,
came into their own by outscoring
the Santa Rosans' first five, 23-18.
No one Papoose could claim the
distinction of being a hero this
weekend. Bill Bond and Denis
Mahoney led the offensive attack,
scoring a total of 50 points during
the two nights. Nick Vojvodich
played his two best panics of the
season both on offense and de
fense.
Captain Hap Wagner and Beppo
Dyer played their usual all-around
game,, while reserves Frank Wright,
Curl Isaacs and Dick Farman were
instrumental in both victories. Far
man meshed 13 markers Saturday,
second only to Mahoney.
The Lowell cagers were sparked
by their All-City center, Clarence
Grider, who netted 17 points, despite
a stellar guarding job by Stanford's
Vojvodich. Grider awed the onlook
ers with his cool floor play, terrific
rebounding, and a rarely seen style
of teamwork.
The hapless Panthers from Santa
Rosa could never seem to get going
against the fast-breaking frosh. Led
by high-scoring Fred Giannini and
Doug Camilli, the visitors featured
a slow, deliberate, and cautious at
tack that could not compete with
the yearlings'.
Mahoney thrilled the crowd in
this tilt by stealing the ball from
the Panthers five times during
the third period and racing the
full length of the floor for layups.

rebounding, and a rarely seen style

The hapless Panthers from Santa
Rosa could never seem to get going
against the fast-breaking frosh. Led
by high-scoring Fred Giannini and
Doug Camilli, the visitors featured
a slow, deliberate, and cautious at

the yearlings'.
Mahoney thrilled the crowd in

the Panthers five times during

Stanford's high-flying Papoose cagers concluded a successful
season this weekend as they breezed to easy wins over Lowell
and Santa Rosa High Schools by respective scores of 57-45 and
77-59, in the Pavilion.
The two triumphs give the Frosh a final record of eight wins

and two losses, both of which came
at the hands of the California year
lings. Two contests with the jun
ior varsity were not counted.
Coach Dick Clegg's freshmen had
little trouble in overcoming the two

prep squads as their adaptable of
fense offset Lowell's renowned zone
defense and a stubborn Santa Rosa
man - to - man defense, while their
half-court press stymied the visi
tors' attacks.
Clegg was able to clear the bench
and give everyone a considerable
amount of action both nights. On
Saturday night, the second string,
playing the whole second quarter,
came into their own by outscoring
the Santa Rosans' first five, 23-18.
No one Papoose could claim the
distinction of being a hero this
weekend. Bill Bond and Denis
Mahoney led the offensive attack,
scoring a total of 50 points during
the two nights. Nick Vojvodich
played his two best panics of the
season both on offense and de
fense.
Captain Hap Wagner and Beppo
Dyer played their usual all-around
game,, while reserves Frank Wright,
Curl Isaacs and Dick Farman were
instrumental in both victories. Far
man meshed 13 markers Saturday,
second only to Mahoney.
The Lowell cagers were sparked
by their All-City center, Clarence
Grider, who netted 17 points, despite
a stellar guarding job by Stanford's
Vojvodich. Grider awed the onlook
ers with his cool floor play, terrific
rebounding, and a rarely seen style
