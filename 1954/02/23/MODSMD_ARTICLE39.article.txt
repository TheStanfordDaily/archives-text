## WSC Gymnasts Nip Stanford, San Jose 
### 
Washington State College sent an
eight - member gymnastics team
1,000 miles southward last weekend,
and the aggregation trounced Stan
ford and San Jose State soundly.
Stanford came out in the middle ol
an 8G-58-2G count in Encina Gym
Thursday evening.
Boh Pierce claimed his third
straight triumph for Stanford in
the rope climb with his best ef
fort yet, 4.4 seconds. Lon Olson
won the side horse, and Knss
Roy den was best in the high bar
for the Cards.
Led by Jerry Nesselrod, who won
the still rings, got second in the free
exercise, and missed the "all
around" category title by a fraction
of one point, the Stanford squad
could not place consistently enough
to catch the strong WSC squad.
