# Bruins Blitz Cards Twice To Grab PCC Leadership
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
It was the same sad story for Stanford Friday night—three quar
ters and bust. But on Saturday the Cards forgot the script, and they
fought UCLA's blitzing Bruins to the final buzzer.
The Uclans' array of power, however, finally battered down the
undermanned Cards, 88-80, in the Pavilion, giving the Bruins a

sweep of the two-game set which j
began with Friday's 5)2-77 fourth
quarter rout.
The twin wins just, about wrapped
u I» the PCC's Southern Division
crown for the Bruins. California,
which had been tied for first with
UCLA before the weekend's activi
ties. collapsed twice before unpre
tentious SC in Los Angeles.
Stanford, meanwhile, mathe
matically lost all chance of leav
ing the I'CC Cellar. The Cards
have a two and eight record with
hilt two games against Cal re
maining.
UCLA wrestled the lead from
Stanford tor good midway through
the second period Saturday (which

it couldn't do until late in the third
Friday), but the Cards refused to
let. UCLA pull away.
In the fourth quarter four quick
points by George Selleck cut the
Bruin margin to 73-80, and again a
few minutes later after two Selleck
free throws, it was 8,1-80.
The Bruins, however, just weren't
romp to he caught. Loose Johnny
Moore, moving to center when Wee
Willie Nanlls was bounced for his
fifth foul, directed 12 of the Bruins'
last 15 points into the basket.
Monte had a great time at the
pivot post. He was in a position
where lie didn't have t«i rim—just
get the hall, fake, duck, twist,
jump, ami score.
But if it wasn't Moore ruining
Stanford hopes, it was another of
the talented visitors.
In the first half Saturday, with
the Cards right in with the Bruins,
if not ;i little ahead, Don Bragg was
handling the UCLA scoring.
Brags, who alternates hot ween
guaid -<o<l forward, pumped home
|7 markers before half-time, the
majority on twisting jump slinls.
lie set up two more buckets with
nifty passes on consccutivc Bruin

fast breaks and in addition domi
nated Stanford's backboard.
Friday the Cards ran with the
Bruins until the end of the third
stanza before they went into their
"One-Hoss Shay" act. UCLA's con
stant fast-break tactics completely
wore out Stanford's nucleus of Sel
leck, Lawler, and Oleg Suzdaleff.
Acting captain Ron Livingston,
who looks like anything but a bas
ketball player; Naulls, who is a
master of the soft tip-in; and wisp
like Morris Taft, the sophomore
with the phenomenal jump shots,
kept collecting for UCLA every time
it looked as if the Cards might pull

smooth hook shot into the bucket. No foul was called. Lawler
tallied 19 points Friday and 27 on Saturday, but Stanford lost,
02-77 and 88-80. —Daily photo by Frank Huntress
away from the favored Bruins.
Finally when the Indians were
finished Friday and UCLA took
over, 63-61, sophomore guard Den
ny Miller added the final blows.
Miller hit three for three from the
floor, including two very long sets,
and two for two from the free throw
line.
Thus UCLA didn't have one or
two standouts, but six who took
turns — Livingston, Moore, Bragg,
Naulls, Miller, Taft.
Stanford had its heroes, too, but
there were only three.
Kuss Lawler, v\ho leads PCC
scorers with 178 points, kepi Stan
ford in the scoring battle Satur
day with his well-directed hooks.
The lanky center' dropped in 27
tallies to go with 1!) the night he
fore.
Olie SuzdalefT had one of his
nights Friday. The Cards' fast
dribbling co-captain had the range
with his long sets and driving
jumps. His defensive play upset
UCLA all night.
And you can't forget the always
hustling Selleck. His s:ets accounted
for 15 points the first night, and he
poured in 20 more on Saturday, in
cluding a couple of amazing, falling
away jump shots.
Don DeLong's usual fighting game
and Dave Epperson rebounding and
shooting didn't let Stanford down,
but they couldn't keep up with the
race-horse Bruin attack. And Bob
Burnett didn't have anyone else
who could.

Olie SuzdalefT had one of his

UCLA all night.

It was the same sad story for Stanford Friday night—three quar

fought UCLA's blitzing Bruins to the final buzzer.
The Uclans' array of power, however, finally battered down the

In the fourth quarter four quick

Bruin margin to 73-80, and again a

free throws, it was 8,1-80.

Stanford tor good midway through
the second period Saturday (which

it couldn't do until late in the third
Friday), but the Cards refused to
let. UCLA pull away.
In the fourth quarter four quick
points by George Selleck cut the
Bruin margin to 73-80, and again a
few minutes later after two Selleck
free throws, it was 8,1-80.
The Bruins, however, just weren't
romp to he caught. Loose Johnny
Moore, moving to center when Wee
Willie Nanlls was bounced for his
fifth foul, directed 12 of the Bruins'
last 15 points into the basket.
Monte had a great time at the
pivot post. He was in a position
where lie didn't have t«i rim—just
get the hall, fake, duck, twist,
jump, ami score.
But if it wasn't Moore ruining
Stanford hopes, it was another of
the talented visitors.
In the first half Saturday, with
the Cards right in with the Bruins,
if not ;i little ahead, Don Bragg was
handling the UCLA scoring.
Brags, who alternates hot ween
guaid -<o<l forward, pumped home
|7 markers before half-time, the
majority on twisting jump slinls.
lie set up two more buckets with
nifty passes on consccutivc Bruin

fast breaks and in addition domi
nated Stanford's backboard.
Friday the Cards ran with the
Bruins until the end of the third
stanza before they went into their
"One-Hoss Shay" act. UCLA's con
stant fast-break tactics completely
wore out Stanford's nucleus of Sel
leck, Lawler, and Oleg Suzdaleff.
Acting captain Ron Livingston,
who looks like anything but a bas
ketball player; Naulls, who is a
master of the soft tip-in; and wisp
like Morris Taft, the sophomore
with the phenomenal jump shots,
kept collecting for UCLA every time
it looked as if the Cards might pull


FINGER-TIP CONTROL—-Wee Willie Naulls, UCLA's mam
moth center, holds hands with Russ Lawler Friday night in the
Pa 'ilion, but the high-scoring Card pivotman glides another
smooth hook shot into the bucket. No foul was called. Lawler
tallied 19 points Friday and 27 on Saturday, but Stanford lost,
02-77 and 88-80. —Daily photo by Frank Huntress
away from the favored Bruins.
Finally when the Indians were
finished Friday and UCLA took
over, 63-61, sophomore guard Den
ny Miller added the final blows.
Miller hit three for three from the
floor, including two very long sets,
and two for two from the free throw
line.
Thus UCLA didn't have one or
two standouts, but six who took
turns — Livingston, Moore, Bragg,
Naulls, Miller, Taft.
Stanford had its heroes, too, but
there were only three.
Kuss Lawler, v\ho leads PCC
scorers with 178 points, kepi Stan
ford in the scoring battle Satur
day with his well-directed hooks.
The lanky center' dropped in 27
tallies to go with 1!) the night he
fore.
Olie SuzdalefT had one of his
nights Friday. The Cards' fast
dribbling co-captain had the range
with his long sets and driving
jumps. His defensive play upset
UCLA all night.
And you can't forget the always
hustling Selleck. His s:ets accounted
for 15 points the first night, and he
poured in 20 more on Saturday, in
cluding a couple of amazing, falling
away jump shots.
Don DeLong's usual fighting game
and Dave Epperson rebounding and
shooting didn't let Stanford down,
but they couldn't keep up with the
race-horse Bruin attack. And Bob
Burnett didn't have anyone else
who could.
