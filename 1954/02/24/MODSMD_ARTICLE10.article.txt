WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 (UP).
Nearly half of the 590 persons
"separated" from the State De
partment last year as security
risks" still are working for the
; government, congressional tes
timony disclosed today.
Scott, McLeod, Department secu
rity-personncl chief, confirmed pre
vious Democratic reports that 11 of
the 590 were fired for "pro-Com
munist activities or associations."
He said he didn't know whether
any of them actually were Reds.
McLeod testified that 21 of the
590 separations were for "cause"
under the Eisenhower administra
tion's security program. Another
man, he said, was "not subversive"
but had relatives in Russia and that
made him "subject to pressure be
cause he was in the Department."
He lister! the other separations
as 188 resignations, 50 tilings in
economy cuts, 36 whose limited
appointments expired, four who
retired, and 291 who were trans
ferred to other government agen
cies.
McLeod said Iheir names were in
cluded in the 590 figure so thai, the
Civil Service Commission could
keep a close watch on persons with
unresolved security questions in
their files, wherever they might be
working for the government.
McLeod also reported he is in
vestigating 27X additional cases of
sexual deviation and 45 other "se
curity" cases.
McLeod conceded he didn't know
whether any of the Department sep
arations actually were Communists
because his investigations didn't go
that far. He said the FBI takes over
if there are indications an employee
is a Red.
