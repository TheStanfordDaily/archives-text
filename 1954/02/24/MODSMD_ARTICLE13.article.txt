## TUESDAY SERIES German Theater's Recent Revival Told by Dr. Rothe 
### RUSS WILKS 
Hans Rothe, noted German director, described the revival of
the German theater to a Tuesday Evening Series audience last
night at Memorial Auditorium in a lecture entitled, "The Theater
in Postwar Germany."
Dr. Rothe told how Nazi control took over the theater in 1933

and by outlawing all works of for
eign playwrights killed it by 1944.
It took a "miracle" to start the re
vival in 1945 according to Dr. Rothe.
In 1933 there were 250 theaters in
all of Germany. Today there are 163
in Western Germany, he said. Of
these, only 11 are privately owned.
Today you can see everything
worthwhile in world literature and
opera being staged in Germany, Dr.
Rothe reported.
Dr. Rothe, who is also a play
wright, historian, and college pro
fessor, said, "The theater in Germany
is considered as necessary as librar
ies, museums and any other cultural
institution. It is artistically impor
tant."
Many of the buildings were de
stroyed in the war and many of the
plays are presented today in schools
and small halls, he said. Because of
the successful economic rehabili
tation a program of construction and
expansion is under way.
However, he noted that the new
theaters are too big, lacking intima
cy and looking like the "hangar of
a superfortress."
Rothe noticed that the press has
lost considerable influence in the
theater and saw this as an example
of "excellent progress." He contend
ed that plays are not written for the
critics.
Slides were shown depicting the
current stage designs, and Dr. Rothe
pointed out that there are wide var
iations of sets for the same plays.
