# Freshman Skiers Hit By Poisoning
## 
### 
Freshmen who traveled to the
Sierra this weekend found that bro
ken legs aren't the only hazards fac
ing skiers.
Large numbers of them came
down with a food poisoning on Sun
day night, which they attributed to
chemicals used to purify the well
water supplied by the ski lodge
where they were staying.
Freshman Executive Committee
representative Dave Jenks, who was
on the trip, estimated that about 75
out of approximately 100 freshman
skiers came down with the sickness
sometime between Sunday night
and last night.
Three freshmen—Jon Cosovich,
Jon Dorman, and Charles Davis—
were in the Men's Rest Home recu
perating last night.
