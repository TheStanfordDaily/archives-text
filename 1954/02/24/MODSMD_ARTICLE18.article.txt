# Army Says Code Secrets Not Involved
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 (UP).
Senator Joseph R. McCarthy
charged today that the Army re
fused to fire a woman employed
in a secret Pentagon code room,
even though an FBI undorcovei
agent said she once was a Com
munist and still may be one.
The Army promptly announcer!
that the woman, identified as Mr:..
Annie Lee Moss, has been trans
ferred to a job not involving secret,
or confidential material, pending
completion of a security check.
But it said she did not work in the
code room itself and had no access
to code secrets.
McCarthy had no comment on tha
Army announcement.
Mrs. Moss, a $3,335 Signal Corps
employee, said she "never was a
member of the Communist party
or anything else" and has "never
been inside a code room in iny
life." She referred all other ques
tions to her lawyer.
McCarthy said the woman once
was and still may be "an active
member of the Communist party."
McCarthy made the charge at a
subcommittee hearing called to give
Army Secretary Robert T. Steven:,
what McCarthy described as a "true
picture" of the way the Army han
dles Communists.
Stevens is scheduled to appear
before the McCarthy subcommit
tee tomorrow to challenge what
he called McCarthy's "unwar
ranted abuse" of Brig. Gen. Ralph
W. Zwicker, commander of Camp
Kilmer, N.J. The hearing will be
televised,
McCarthy rapped Stevens today
for carrying his case to other sub
committee members. Stevens, for
his part, defended as entirely
"proper" his order to Zwicker to
ignore McCarthy's summons for
further questioning about an honor
able discharge granted an Army
dentist described by McCarthy as a
Red.
