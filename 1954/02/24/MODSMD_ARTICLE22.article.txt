# McCarthy, Stevens, and (?) Ike
## 
### 
The stage is set for tomorov/'s showdown be
tween Senator Joseph McCarthy and Army
Secretary Robert Stevens over McCarthy's in
vestigation and charges on the "Army's han
dling of Communists." Stevens, at his own re
quest, will testify before the Senator who has
( him the "finest dupe I have met."
There is little need here to discuss the ab
surdity of McCarthy's charges that the Army
is "coddling Communists" or the lowhanded
methods he has employed in interrogating
Army officers. We have already spent enough
space in these columns expressing our disgust
for the man and his methods.
And it seems unnecessary for us to dwell on
our respect for Army Secretary Stevens. He
has backed up an officer who was submitted
to what has been described as a "humiliating
experience" during a McCarthy hearing and
has publicly criticized the Senator's methods of
investigation. The dignity with which Stevens
has voiced his comments has provided a wel
come contrast to McCarthy's mouthings.
But there is one voice which has not yet

spoken and which we believe should be
heard. President Eisenhower, as Command
er-in-Chief of the Army, is that voice.
If the President prefers to remain aloof from
the McCarthy-Stevens debate, he is risking a
public misunderstanding of his position. His
silence, in the public mind, might be construed
as a peculiar type of sanction for McCarthy's
actions. And as that silence lengthens, specu
lation on his position becomes more and more
confused.
We would guess that President Eisen
hower, as a former General of the Army, as
an intelligent citizen, and as the leader of this
nation, privately supports Stevens in his
stand against McCarthy. It is possible, how
ever, that as the leader of his party, Eisen
hower might privately stand with McCarthy
as a member of that party.
Whatever his stand is, the very nature of Ei
senhower's position demands that he make his
private opinions known. The stage is set for
tomorrow's showdown, but a principal charac
ter and his voice is missing.
