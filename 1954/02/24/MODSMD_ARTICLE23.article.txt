# NSA Conference Open
## 
### 
Stanford is co-sponsor with the University of
California and Mills College of a Bay Area con
ference on Student Government fo be held at
Mills College on Saturday.
The conference, planned by Stanford's dis
trict of the National Students Association, is the
type of conference recommended by the ASSU
Executive Committee when it voted to rejoin
NSA last fall.
It will include delegates from all 20 Bay
Area colleges.
It will concentrate on workshop discussions,
where delegates can exchange ideas on mutual
problems.
Its agenda will emphasize problems of spe
cial interest to the colleges attending. Stanford
fraternity men, who have been debating a pro
posed change in rushing dates since last fall,

may be especially interested in the workshop
on rushing procedures. Stanford's Honor Code
discussion group may benefit from ideas traded
at the Honor Code workshop.
According to the NSA Co-ordinator's report
at last week's Excom meeting:
"At the planning meeting last week we all
started hashing over the topics for the confer
ence. And it got so interesting the chairman
couldn't get us back in order again."
Although it is of special value to the students
directly concerned with student government
problems, the conference is explicitly not lim
ited to official delegates.
We recommend attendance for all students
who are interested in the theory and problems
of student government, or in the workings of
the National Students Association.
