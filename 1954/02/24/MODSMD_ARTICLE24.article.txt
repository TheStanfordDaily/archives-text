# PRIVATE LIFE

### LARRY CAHN 
One of the biggest fallacies that my mind enter
tained before entering the service was the one, "Well,
there is no war going on, so what the heck, the army
can't be too bad."
Those of you who have the joy of the draft army
ahead might just as well remove such thought from

your head. Though there is no
war at the moment, nor even a
police action, the training has not
been altered. It is still tough,
long, and at times miserable and
unbearable.
It must be added, however,
that with no war the mental at
titude of the individual trainea is
one of ease and complacency
with no worries or fear of being
pushed into combat at the end of

his basic training. His only worry is to get out of
the infantry and into something a bit better —armor,
artillery, engineering, etc.
The chances are abotit fifty-fifty. Those who fail
to make one of the other branches or go to technical
thool return to the infantry and remain there for
the duration of their service. '
In my training company, which completed its cycle
Saturday, half of the men are being shipped around
I he country for advanced training, the other half
will return to Fprt Ord for more infantry. In my
case, as in the case of the majority of college men,
I escaped (he clutches of advanced infantry and will
go to a school: clerk typist school. I believe that the
army does make an honest attempt to place men

where they will not only do the army the most good
but also where the individuals will benefit. A college
man with any type of specialized training—engineer
ing, law, chemistry, education, business, journalism,
radio, or foreign language—will stand a good chance
of benefiting from his service time by being placed
in a position where the most will be made of his
education.
While on the subject of educational benefits dur
ing time of service, I can't overlook the United
States Armed Forces Institute) It is an educational
service with branches at every post in the United
States and overseas.
USAFI offers correspondence courses in over 350
subjects on all educational levels, into
six areas of Humanities, Science, Communications,
Mathematics, Social Science, and Technical-Voca
tional. Once basic training is finished and you have
more time, USAFI is a marvelous opportunity to pick
up those courses you just didn't have time to take
in school.
Many universities accept these courses for credit
(Stanford does not) or they may he taken for self
improvement.
But all the army benefits of education, relaxation,
and well-being that you hear about come after basic.
During basic you don't think about much more than
getting it over with. In my Company only 79 per cent
of the men who started completed the training. The
others were dropped or transferred to another com
pany, in the majority of cases because of too many
training days missed due to sickness. Others just
got fed up and went -AWOL.
