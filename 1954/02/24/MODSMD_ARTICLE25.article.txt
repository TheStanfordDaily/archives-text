# BULL SESSION
## 
### JACK BYRNE 
If you can believe what you read in The Daily, a
bunch of public spirited students are passing a pe
tition for the return of the serial to the Sunday Night
Flick.
The boys haven't approached me yet, but when
they do, I'll sign, and I've got a counlr of suppestions
for movie improvement myself, f'

Simple enough things to do,
when you sit down and consider
the problem: we'll swipe a couple
of ideas from Radio City Music
Hall. Prop the paper up against
the sugar dispenser, and let's ex
amine this business closely.
The first problem is the choice
of pictures. We'll start off with
"How to Marry a Millionaire,"
and "Easy to Love." No great

philosophical content, but this is a ciouuie teaiure.
(By the way, Public Relations Board, which is
always seeking a pie to get its finger in, can crash
this party by selling popcorn in the lobby.)
To get out those roughs who are unaffected by
Monroe or Williams, we'll get ourselves a local ver
sion of the Rockettes. Some of the more mercenary
girls on campus would probably jump at the chance
to get a little candy bar money this way.
But here comes the real gem of the whole set-up:
an organ. We've got one, too; the blooming thing
takes up half of the first floor at the Knoll. It lies

there, a great disassembled mass, just waiting for
someone with vision to put it to work. Here's the
chance, and it'll be the maraschino cherry on the
banana split.
We'll put this organ into Mem Aud, with the con
sole on a hydraulic platform that comes up out of
the orchestra pit. (Engineering Department should
gladly volunteer their service here.) Then boys,
open the doors and let the crowd pour in.
'Midst the crackling of the popcorn sack, our
glorious second feature draws to its finale. The danc
ing girls do their part. And then, up comes the organ
console from the depths, Herbert Nanney flashes the
smile that only a theater organist can muster when
facing a house full of culture-happy movie goers,
and breaks into the opening of "O My Papa," with all
the stops out. My spine tingles with anticipation at
the very thought.
Alternatively, we can put on high class stuff. Great
movies past and present are all that we present. In
stead of the chorus lines we get O'rchesis to gazelle
about the stage, accompanied by Sandor Salgo and
the Stanford Symphony. Herbert Nanney will play
Bach fugues for the crowd.
Impractical? No more than the Engineering Cor
ner traffic blockade. The most expensive part would
be the installation of the organ. Orchesis should be
most willing to work for the sake of their art, and
the Stanford Symphony boys get a unit's credit any
way. If worse comes to worse, we can always raise
the tariff to 21c.
