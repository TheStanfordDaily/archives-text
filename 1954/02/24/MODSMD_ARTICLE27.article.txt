(Ed. note: This is the first of two articles on NSA's current activities.
The national and international program will he discussed tomorrow.)

Stanford's participation in the National Students Association
since rejoining the organization last fall has consisted largely of
organizational work, according to a report given by NSA Co-ordi
nator Guy Shoup to the Executive Committee last week.
In describing his activities as co-ordinator, Shoup emphasized

the need for building up an
zational framework and investigat- j
ing possibilities carefullv before I

undertaking NS/
projects on cam
pus.
He invited Ex
ecutive Commit
tee members an
interested stu
dents to attend ai
NSA Workshop
on Student Gov
ernment at Mill
College th i
weekend.
Shoup also enu-

merated six fields of NSA activities
on the Stanford campus.
1. He has set up a file of the
NSA magazines, pamphlets, and
surveys relevant to Stanford stu
dent activities. Before the end of
this week, he plans to send out
letters to various Stanford com
mittees such as the lIR, Cardinals,
and Election Board informing
them of NSA material which !
might help them.
2. He has prepared a form letter
about Stanford's experience with
NSA to mail to other universities
which are considering joining the
organization. In this letter he
stresses that Stanford joined last fall
more from a willingness to contrib
ute to NSA than because Excom felt
Stanford needed NSA's services.
3. He has sent reports from the
lIR and the Berlin Affiliation
Committee to NSA national head
quarters, so that NSA may send
them to other schools interested in
such projects. lie is also working
to arrange a yearbook exchange I
•with colleges in India.
4. He is investigating the possi
bility of instituting a student dis
count service at Stanford.

According to his findings, it may
be possible for Stanford students to
secure a discount o£ from 15 to 50
per cent on large purchases such as
automobiles, victrolas, furniture,
clothing, and jewelry by joining the
same buyers' league that Mills has
already joined.
5. Shoup is investigating the
possibility of Bay Area entertain
ment discounts for all the NSA
schools in (his region. He is try
ing to arrange with San Francisco
theaters and restaurants to give
students discounts on prices.
6. The entire California-Nevada-
Hawaii region is sponsoring an art
tour to send paintings by students
from each NSA school to the other
schools for exhibition, and to award
prizes to the best paintings.
Stanford students will be asked to
submit paintings to the competition
before the end of this quarter, he
said.

The national and international program will he discussed tomorrow.)

Stanford's participation in the National Students Association
since rejoining the organization last fall has consisted largely of
organizational work, according to a report given by NSA Co-ordi
nator Guy Shoup to the Executive Committee last week.
In describing his activities as co-ordinator, Shoup emphasized

the need for building up an
zational framework and investigat- j
ing possibilities carefullv before I

undertaking NS/
projects on cam
pus.
He invited Ex
ecutive Commit
tee members an
interested stu
dents to attend ai
NSA Workshop
on Student Gov
ernment at Mill
College th i
weekend.
Shoup also enu-

merated six fields of NSA activities
on the Stanford campus.
1. He has set up a file of the
NSA magazines, pamphlets, and
surveys relevant to Stanford stu
dent activities. Before the end of
this week, he plans to send out
letters to various Stanford com
mittees such as the lIR, Cardinals,
and Election Board informing
them of NSA material which !
might help them.
2. He has prepared a form letter
about Stanford's experience with
NSA to mail to other universities
which are considering joining the
organization. In this letter he
stresses that Stanford joined last fall
more from a willingness to contrib
ute to NSA than because Excom felt
Stanford needed NSA's services.
3. He has sent reports from the
lIR and the Berlin Affiliation
Committee to NSA national head
quarters, so that NSA may send
them to other schools interested in
such projects. lie is also working
to arrange a yearbook exchange I
•with colleges in India.
4. He is investigating the possi
bility of instituting a student dis
count service at Stanford.

According to his findings, it may
be possible for Stanford students to
secure a discount o£ from 15 to 50
per cent on large purchases such as
automobiles, victrolas, furniture,
clothing, and jewelry by joining the
same buyers' league that Mills has
already joined.
