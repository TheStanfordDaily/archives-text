## 
### 
Plans arc being made to follow up the Bryan Green mission,
Chaplain Robert M. Minlo said yesterday.
Chaplain Minto said, "Bryan Green has cleared the air for reli
gion at Stanford. Wo have all found that there is a much wider
interest in religion than any of us realized."

The chaplain listed seven points
in which students can follow up the
Bryan Green mission:
I. If the demand is sufficient,
Dr. Alexander Miller will cive a
series of talks on the elements of
Christian doctrine.
2. For students who are anxious
to further "examine the data,"
Bryan Green, Chaplain Minto, and
Dr. Miller have prepared a list of
the top books on Christ and Chris
tianity, most of which arc available
in the Church vestry. The Church
secretary will, upon request, give
students copies of the book list.
:S. For those wishing to take
courses in religion, the following
courses arc being offered spring
quarter: The Christian Faith and
University Education; Christian
ity and Contemporary Society;
Comparative Religion; and Semi
nar in Contemporary Religious
Thought.
4. Several faculty members of
Christian conviction have offered to
speak to living groups on religious
matters if there is enough demand.
5. Because of many requests, the
Church will be open from 7 to 10
p.m. for meditation.
ft. The chaplain invites students
who are interested in personal con
sultation and in forming small in
quirers' groups to sec him.
7. Noon prayers from 12 to 12:05
p.m. arc being held daily in the
Memorial Church.
Minto observed that the student
congregation was exceptionally large
at last Sunday's service, especially
for a holiday weekend; and that fac
ulty members were particularly en
thusiastic about Canon Green's visit.
Tentative plans are now being
made for a Bryan Green mission at
the University of California. within
the next few years.
