Stanford Police Chief Gordon |
Davis has cautioned Palo Alto High [
School studento not to come on the v
Stanford campus "looking for
trouble."
"A few students seem to think it
is funny to come here only for mis- I
chievous reasons, and they tend to
give the entire school a bad name,"
Davis said yesterday.
According to the chief, nine high I
school students weie picked up on I
the campus last weekend.
"They seem to think it's funny,
for instance, lo sneak up on people
sitting in parked cars on campus.
They don't realize that besides being |
a ucneral nuisance, there have been 1
some holdups recently near here,
and some night one of them may get
seriously hurt."
