ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., Feb. 23
(UP) â€”The New York Yankees sold
holdout pitcher Vic Raschi to the
St. Louis Cardinals today in a "get
tough" policy aimed at players they
termed "too complacent" after win
ing five straight championships.

In a surprise deal which required
waivers from their seven American
League rivals, the Yankees sent the
big right-hander to the Cards in
exchange for cash estimated at
$100,000 and minor league players to
be determined later.
