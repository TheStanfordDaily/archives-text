# Corp Crew Trims Campus
## Paving, Moving Among Tasks 
### GERRY SMITH 
Every time a candy wrapper
or a Cellar coltec cup is thrown
on the ground, someone has to
pick it up. When holes in the
pavement on Palm Drive need to
be filled in. somebody has to
fill them. If furniture must be
moved to make room for a dance
at Lagunita, somebody has to
move it.
Around any campus, literally
thousands of little jobs must be
done to keep things running
smoothly. Here at Stanford, these
jobs are done by maintenance men
operating from headquarters in the
Corporation Yard.
Workmen most often seen by stu
dents arc probably part of the labor
and garden sections of the Buildings
and Grounds Department.
One of the special duties of the
labor crew is getting things ready
for Registration Day.
Other labor crew iluties include
moving new furniture into any of
the residences, making periodic
tours of campus roads to clean up
leaves in the gutters and other
rubbish, and picking up every
thing from bottles to dead cats as
soon as they arc reported.
George Greene, who has been
working at Stanford for 20 years, di
rects the 11 truck drivers and 13
laborers who make up the crew.
The garden crew is kept busy
trimming shrubs, removing dead
trees and shrubs, and generally
keeping the campus grounds
spruced up.
Dirk Schroder,, who has worked
for Stanford since 1940, oversees 22
gardeners. Besides taking care of
shrubs, trees, and lawns, Schroder
also makes occasional suggestions to
the Buildings and Grounds Commit
tee about projects such as cleaning
up the Branner court and putting in
lawn.
When the work load is too
heavy during vacations, students
are sometimes hired for a few
weeks. Such work as cleaning
weeds from the flume to Lake La
gunita is often done by students
or other casual labor.
The Corporation Yard has a pri
vate dump located on the northeast
end of the campus where trash is
either burned or buried.
The labor and garden crews arc
classcd as maintenance men on a
regular payroll, not day to day
wages. The University a I provides
them with a health plan and group
life insurance.
