# ON BRICKER PLAN
## Prof. Horn To Address Poly Union 
### 
Dr. Robert A. Horn, of the Po
litical Science Department, will
speak on the controversial Brick
er amendment before the Politi
cal Union at 8 tonight in Cubber
ley Auditorium.
Horn, an expert ori constitutional
law, has said that a person cannot
understand the Bricker amendment
merely by understanding its con
stitutionality.
He suggests a study beginning
with the logical results of its pas
sage. The proposed amendment,
he says, will make it more diffi
cult for the State Department and
the President to carry on foreign
affairs.
The Bricker amendment, he be
lieves, reflects a lost cause; it re
flects the days when isolationism
was possible and the small town and
rural population directed the coun
try's domestic and foreign policies.
It also signifies a Senatorial nos
talgia for the days when Congress
was more influential in molding the
nation's foreign affairs, he said.
"There is a danger in the mak
ing of American foreign policy by
one man no matter how compe
tent lie may be; yet to subject im
portant decisions to (he delay of
Congressional approval might well
be far more dangerous than (he
risks engendered by one man," he
said.
After Horn's speech, privileged
floor speakers from the three Union
parties â€” Republicans, Democrats,
and Independents will discuss the
amendment. The meeting will then
be open to floor debate.
