WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 (UP) â€”
Senator Wayne Morse (Ind., Ore.)
today blocked an attempt by Senate
Republican Leader William F.
Knowland to gel, a final vote tomor
row on the Bricker amendment to
curb the President's treaty-making
powers.
Simultaneously, Senator William
E. Jenncr (R., ind.) charged that a
"revolutionary political corps" is
trying to undermine the constitution
by "perversion of treaty - making
and of executive agreements."
Urging passage of the Bricker
proposal, Jenner said the State De
partment, under former Secretary
Dean Acheson, became the "princi
pal agent of the ideological revolu
tion started by Harry Hopkins, Al
ger Hiss, Henry Wallace, Owen Lat
timore, Harry Dexter White, Frank
Coe, and Harold Glasser."
