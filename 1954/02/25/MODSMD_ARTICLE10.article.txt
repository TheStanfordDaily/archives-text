## Proposed Bricker Plan Said Based on False Premises 
### JAE HUNLEY RUTH JAHNKE 
The Bricker Amendment does not meet the real need in the
determination of American foreign policy, is based upon false
premises, and is unclear as to application, according to Dr. Rob
ert A. Horn in a speech before the Political Union last night.
Senator Bricker and his supporters defend the amendment by
♦asserting that they "want to go back
to the Constitution," when in reality
"they have gone back to the Articles
of Confederation," Horn said.
He continued to say that the pro
posed Bricker Amendment would
make it more difficult for the Presi
dent and the State Department to
carry on foreign affairs. He said, "I
believe that that is the purpose of
Senator Bricker and the other sena
tors who are supporting the amend
ment."
The real need, or the real danger,
Horn stated, is that under our Con
stitutional provisions our foreign
policy is determined and controlled
through treaties and executive
agreements by the President.
Horn challenged the Bricker as
sumption that a group as large and
diverse as Congress could handle
the problems of foreign policy.
"It is inconceivable that the Pres
ident of the United States would
proceed with fateful decisions in
foreign affairs where there was

The Political Union will hold
interviews for the offices of busi
ness manager, clerk, and commit
tee chairmen today and tomorrow.
Today's interviews will be held
from 5 to 6 p.m. in the Nitery, and
tomorrow's will be held from 4 to
5 p.m. in the Excom room.

clear disapproval by a majority of
Congress," Horn commented.
He said that the Bricker Amend
ment made no provisions for when
and how Congress would affect
changes in executive actions. Horn
illustrated this point with the fol
lowing hypothetical case:
If the United States made a
treaty or executive agreement
with a foreign nation stating that
private debts could be collected
through legal action in cither
country, and if any state, such as
California, did not legislate in
support of this treaty or executive
agreement, the citizens of that
state would not be liable for any
debts contracted with the citizens
of that nation. Any state could
thereby make a laughing matter
out of international agreements.
Horn qualified his statements by
saying that he is a Republican from
Bricker's home state, Ohio.
