# P.I.E. Mobile Unit Visits Campus
## 
### 
An estimated 500 students visited
the "Mighty Mite"' and safety dis
play of the Pacific Intermountain
Express which parked behind Hoo
ver Tower yesterday.
Attendants, who took no actual
count of the number of guests, spent
the day administering a group of
perceptual tests. A mock accelera
tor-brake setup checked the reac
tion time, as students slammed the
pedals to the floor; another tested
the periphery of the visitors' vision.
At another device students peered
into a stereo viewer which checked
everything from vertical and lateral
balance to usable vision and color or
depth perception.
The unit, which travels the West
ern states, also features a midget
version of a PIE freight van, ex
actly one-half the standard size. Ex
cept for its engine, which is too
small to be made a dicscl, the trac
tor-trailer unit is completely equip
ped with of standard
accessories. It will travel under its
own power, but rides piggy-back on
a trailer during long hauls. Its tiny
cab will barely accommodate a
driver.
PIE sends the display around to
high schools, colleges, military
bases, fairs, or anywhere there is
room and interest for it. Its stay on
the campus was made with the ap
proval of the University.


MIDGET MAMMOTH— Students rmnaged to find time between classes to go to the Pacific Inter
mountain Express display which was parked behind Hoover Tower yesterday. On the other side
of the "Mighty Mite" was a battery of reaction and optical testing instruments. "Mighty Mite" is
an exact one-half replica of a regular P.I.E. freight van. —Daily photo by Jack Tracy
