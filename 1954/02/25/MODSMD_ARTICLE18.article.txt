## Stevens, McCarthy Reach Agreement Say Officers Will Testily 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 (UP)
—Army Secretary Robert T. Ste
vens reversed himself today
and agreed to let Sen. Joseph R.
McCarthy question high-ranking
officers about "Communism and
Communists" in the Army.
Stevens, who said he did not feel
he had "retreated or capitulated" to
McCarthy, reached an agreement
with the Wisconsin Republican that
canceled a "showdown hearing"
scheduled for tomorrow before Mc-
Carthy's Permanent Senate Investi
gating subcommittee.
The television broadcast of Mc-
Carthy's hearing with Stevens,
scheduled for 7:15 this morning,
has been canceled.
The agreement was reached at a
secret two-hour meeting between
McCarthy and Stevens which ap
parently halted their public feud.
McCarthy had accused the Army of
"coddling" Communists and Stevens
had charged McCarthy with "unfair
attacks" on loyal Army officers.
Under terms of a "memorandum
of understanding" issued by Mc-
Carthy's subcommittee, Stevens
agreed to make available for ques
tioning Brig. Gen. Ralph W. Zwick
er, commander of Camp Kilmer,
N.J., whose appearance at a secret
New York heating last, week fired
up the Stevens-McCarthy feud.
Stevens also agreed to submit
to McCarthy the names of all per
sons involved in the so-called
"Peress case," which concerns flie
promotion and honorable dis
charge of an Army dentist Mc-
Carthy has accused of being a
Communist.
The White House declined all
comment on the Stevens-McCarthy
agreement. White House Press Sec
retary James C. Hagerty said only
that the White House had no ad
vance knowledge of it.
At Camp Kilmer, Zwicker de
clined all comment. The post public
information officer issued a state
ment saying only that the "entire
matter is now at Department of the
Army level, and Gen. Zwicker re
fers all questions concerning the in
cident to higher headquarters."
