# A 						'Small' Blood Drive?
## 
### 
We repeat now what we said a few weeks
ago about the worth of contributing blood and
he value of Stanford's three "small" blood
drives. In comparison to the activities of last
year's "mammoth" drive, the headlines are
smaller, the drive publicity is less intense, and
the Korean war is over, but the need for blood
remains. It remains as long as sickness and dis-,
aster remain in the world.
Today the first of Stanford's three blood
drives of the year begins. Collections will be
taken in the Women's Clubhouse from 8:30 to
A today and tomorrow.
As of yesterday, about 400 students had

ll seems almost certain now that this year's
Congress wjII pass some kind of legislation to
.illow deduction of college student expenses on
federal income tax returns.
The National Students Association and other
student-interest groups have been calling for
it for several years. President Eisenhower rec
ommended it in his budget message, and the
House Ways and Means Committee has pro
vided for it.
Some type of legislation will probably be
passed—but the guestion of greatest interest to
students is exactly what kind. The numerous
plans which have been proposed boil down in
essence to three different plans:
I. To allow parents to claim as a deduction
any child who earns more than $600 and is at
tending college. This plan, backed by the
President and the Ways and Means Commit
tee, would end the irritating problem of par
ents being unable to afford letting their children
earn more than $600.

than $600 for the cost of their children's educa-

made appointments to donate blood today and
tomorow, 200 less than the Red Cross workers
would be able to handle and far less than the
number of contributors in any one day of last
year's week-long drive.
There are still 200 blank spaces left in the
schedule for today and tomorrow. We hope
that those students who are "on the verge" of
donating their blood will fill that schedule and
enable Stanford to reach its 600-pint goal in the
first "small" drive of the year.
We hope that Stanford will be aware of the
need for blood. We hope that Stanford will
prove that its sense of giving is not limited to
mammoth campaigns with extensive publicity.

tion to deduct the full cost of the education
instead of the $GOO maximum allowed now.
3. To allow full deduction of college student
expenses either by the parent or by the student
who is earning his own way. This plan incor
porates the second provision.
Much as we would welcome any legislation
in this field, we believe that the first two pro
visions—directed to help the parents alone—
are incomplete.
Parents in upper-income brackets would
benefit most by being allowed to claim children
as deductions or being allowed to deduct more
than $600 for their children's college expenses.
And we wonder if the pressure on these stu
dents is nearly as great as that on the self-sup
porting student who must pay tuition and living
costs out of a summer and part-time income de
pleted by taxation.
We hope that before Congress finally passes
a law for college-student tax deductions, they
will have heard from the college students them
selves—the group most directly affected and
the group best able to understand and express
their own need.

There are still 200 blank spaces left in the
schedule for today and tomorrow. We hope
that those students who are "on the verge" of
donating their blood will fill that schedule and
enable Stanford to reach its 600-pint goal in the
first "small" drive of the year.

need for blood. We hope that Stanford will
prove that its sense of giving is not limited to
mammoth campaigns with extensive publicity.

in this field, we believe that the first two pro

are incomplete.
Parents in upper-income brackets would
benefit most by being allowed to claim children
as deductions or being allowed to deduct more
than $600 for their children's college expenses.

We hope that before Congress finally passes
a law for college-student tax deductions, they
will have heard from the college students them

the group best able to understand and express
their own need.
We repeat now what we said a few weeks
ago about the worth of contributing blood and

drives. In comparison to the activities of last
year's "mammoth" drive, the headlines are
smaller, the drive publicity is less intense, and
the Korean war is over, but the need for blood
remains. It remains as long as sickness and dis-,
aster remain in the world.

it for several years. President Eisenhower rec

Some type of legislation will probably be
passed—but the guestion of greatest interest to
students is exactly what kind. The numerous
plans which have been proposed boil down in
essence to three different plans:

any child who earns more than $600 and is at

President and the Ways and Means Commit
