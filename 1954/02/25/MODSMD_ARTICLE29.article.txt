### PETE GROTHE 
i
CAMPUS TRAGEDY. Pat Stusser, member of
Senior Excom and good guy, wasn't happy. His
,'ocial life war. lagging. His friend, Milcli Barnes, an
inmate at the Chi Psi house, had the solution.
"Lissen," said Barnes, "my girl, who is at San
T r* ii . 1_ 1_ . LI Ik. _k. .•

Jose State, has a beautiful blonde
sorority sister who needs a blind
date for the sorority formal. How
about it?"
"Okay," Stusser okayed in en
thusiastic tones.
The dance, which Barnes in
formed Stusser was set for Sat
urday night, required formal at
tire, so Stusser sent to Seattle to
have his tux unmothballed and

air-shipped to Stanford.
On the appointed Saturday morning, Stusser re
ceived a phorie call from Barnes.
"I've got bad Hews," Barnes moaned.
"What! Did my blind date fall through?" cried
Stusser.
"No, worse than that."
"Did your date fall through?"
"No, worse than that."
'What happened?
"The dance was last night."
VACATION PROFITS DEPT. While the bulk of
us were throwing money away on the ski slopes over
Washington's Birthday, a Stanford soph named Fred
tucked away $565 playing craps in Las Vegas.
SMELEVISION HAS ARRIVED DEPT. They can
•ay what they want about smelevision being the
thing of the "future, but as far as members of Break

1' " " " '

Tt arrived last Friday when someone killed a black
animal with a white stripe running down the back
and put it inside the Breakers' television set.
For obvious reasons, all of them smelly, the Break

I'd like to end on a serious note.
Bryan Green was at Stanford last week. He spoke
to crowds totalling over 20,000 and gave approxi
mately 70 personal consultations. One professor, who
has been at Stanford for over a quarter of a cen
tury, called it.the biggest thing religiously ever to
hit Stanford.
Bryan Green, who refused fo take a penny for
his week's work at Stanford, caused somewhat of
a revolution. Persons who had never considered
matters much deeper than last week's date or next
week's hall game were discussing religion. The
lights which remained on until all hours of the
night at Toyon and at Rohle, at Lag and the Dell
house, at Thcta Xi and at Roth reflected that.
It didn't matter thart some agreed with Bryan
Green as violently as others disagreed. What did
matter was that religion was being discussed and
deeply pondered.
Bryan Green has left now. The lecture halls are
empty and his discussions with living groups are ab
sent. But if he has inspired us to pursue these matters
which he raised, if he has given us the inclination to
further "examine the data," then the results of
Bryan Green's visit will be positive and permanent.
If, on the other hand, his visit here was nothing
but a week of pleasant intellectual stimulation which
could be forgotten the moment he left, then his trav
eling expenses, his speaking time, and our listening
time have been wasted.
