## 'Sound Logic' and Bryan Green 
### 
To the Editor:
In a letter noteworthy for its restraint, the Misses
Bickford, Fellows, and Holdahl have pointed out that
students should critically evaluate the contents of
Canon Green's speech.
These young ladies were taken to task by a Mr.
MeDaniel in a letter equally noteworthy, if for other
reasons. We are told in this letter thai Stanford stu
dt'nts should be critical of some of the "worn-out
eientific theories, which they are gullibly absorbing" '
instead of "the sound logic of Bryan Green" etc.
It will no doubt come as a great shock to Mr. Mc-
Daniel to learn that scientific laws are deduced from
s< ientific theories. And these laws are either demon
strably established or the .scientific theories are of
fered accordingly.
On the other hand, the "sound logic" of Canon
Green rests on faith and faith alone. It is as true as
ihe credulity of his auditors will accept. It is un
changing, unmodified by circumstance, and above all
it is "revealed" and hence not susceptible to proof.
In the remainder of his letter Mi MeDaniel hedges

a bit by employing a distant relation to the de
nounced sciencesâ€”namely a psychological test (I
wonder if the Psychology Department would ac
cept Mr. McDaniel's conclusions?) to "prove" in a
manner reminiscent of Canon Green that all who
disagree with that worthy are somewhat, malad
justed. (Green just called those who disagree un
christian.)
The question is: should we, as apparently happened
in the case of Mi . MeDaniel, confuse Bryan Green's
new Orlhodoxy with Christianity, his Sectarian Dog
ma with Logic, his Condescending Intolerance with
Wisdom, and his genteel Hevivalism with Evangel
ism? I hope not.
Indeed, if a significant number of us were as
confused as Mr. MeDaniel, one might examine the
desirability ftf turning Stanford into a real estate
development, or at the least, setting up an un-Chris
tian Committee to determine which of us may be
permitted to call ourselves by that. name.
