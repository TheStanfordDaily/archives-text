articles on NSA's current ac

In joining the National Stu
dents Association last fall, Stan
ford became part of a group of
students who have assumed na
tional and international responsi
bilities.
At home, NSA is right now
pushing hardest for the passage
of legislation which would al
low deduction of college stu
dents' expenses on Federal In
come Tax returns.
The last two NSA Congresses
have urged student governments
and individual students to re
view the proposals for such legis
lation and to write their Con
gressmen urging support. The
student governments of several
NSA schools have already taken
action on these projects.
NSA has also arranged air
charter flight accomodations to
Europe at low rates, and a book
let on "Work, Study, Travel
Abroad," designed particularly
for students traveling on their
own.

On the international front,
NSA delegates attended the
Fourth International Student
Conference in Istanbul, Turkey,
in January.
Delegates from 44 national
unions of students from the Mid
dle East, Africa, South and
Southeast Asia, Europe, and the
Americas attended the Istanbul
meeting.
The Conference set up a num
ber of student international as
sistance teams which will go to
Indonesia, India, and Africa to
help with student problems in
those areas.
Delegates voted to establish a
five-man fact-finding board
(similar to the United Nations
Human Rights Commission) to
investigate the oppression of stu
dents in any area where such an
investigation is requested by at
least three national student
unions.
Students attending the Con
ference also discussed and plan
ned for the continuation of inter
national student activities such
as travel exchanges, cultural fes
tivals, exchange of information,
and scholarships.
