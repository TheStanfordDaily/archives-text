A PILE-UP AT MIDCOURT—The two little men, the quick-moving playmakers of Stanford and
UCLA basketball, sprawl on the Pavilion floor Saturday night after a scramble for a loose ball.
Stanford's George Selleck has the ball tucked under his arm, football fashion, as Bruin acting
captain Ron Livingston tumbles over him. UCLA won two games from the Cards.
