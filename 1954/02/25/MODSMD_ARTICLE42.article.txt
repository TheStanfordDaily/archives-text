# Stanford's 'Best' Swim Squad Eyes Fifth Straight PCC Crown
## 
### DON STEPHENS 
"This year's team should be the best we've ever had," says Tom
Haynie about the Stanford swimming team.
Haynie is head coach of the aquatic powerhouse of the West
Coast. The Cards have won the PCC Southern Division champion
ship for the last four years and are presently working on a string

of over 50 straight dual meet vie- A
tories.
Haynie, never a pessimist, bases
his high hopes on the swimming
talents of Jim Gaughran, Larry
Heim, John Weiser, Dan Osborne,
and Winston Black. These five
should form the nucleus of an out
standing dual meet team, and one
that may possibly take second or
third place in the NCAA meet in
March.
The 21-man varsity team and the
15 - man freshman team has been
working out since the beginning of
the quarter.
The varsity, which opens its
schedule at San Jose State Friday
at 4 p.m., will he captained this
year by Gaughran, one of the
four seniors on the team.
Gaughran was PCC champ in the I
50 and 100 yard freestyle sprints
last year, was a two-year All-PCC
water polo forward, and placed in
the NCAA meet two years in a row,
swimming on the freestyle relay
team.
Gaughran hasn't really hit his
peak yet, however, and Haynie ex
pects him to surpass by far his ex- !
ploits of the past years. Already this
season he has turned in times of
23.0 for the 50 and 51.8 for the
100 freestyle. The PCC records in

these events are 22.8 and 51.6.
Six other sprinters are vying for
the spot behind Gaughran: Lee
Gunerson, a Senior; Bob Morris, a
junior; and Doug Ackerman, Carver
Nixon, Phil Gay, and Pete LaTour
ette.
In the longer freestyle events,
Haynie has. a four-man corps of
Dan Osborne, Bill Mclvor, Tad De
vine, and Chuck Clemans.
Osborne, a junior, holds the
PCC record of 2:f19.9 for 200 yards.
He had an attack of flu during
last year's NCAA meet, but with
good health is expected to place
high in the 1500 meters and 440-
| yard events. His best for the quar
ter is 4:42, just 1.5 seconds off the
league record.
Haynie's two backstrokers, Heim
and Weiser, are among the five best
in the collegiate ranks. Heim won

third place in the 100 and 200 back
stroke races in last year's Nationals,
while Weiser got fifth in the longer
event.
Heim has best times of 58.5 for
100 backstroke, 2:08.8 for 200 back
stroke, 1:33 for 150 individual med
ley, and 52.2 for 100 freestyle. He
has excellent chances in both relays,
both backstroke races, and the in
dividual medley. Haynie's problem:
what events to swim him in.
The breaststroke races will be
. handled by two sophs, Winston
Black and Colbtirn Wilbur. Black,
j a transfer from Fullerton JC, has
bests of 1:04 and 2:29 for the 100
and 200-yard distances. Wilbur,
i along with Black, a graduate of
Palo Alto High, has done 1:07 and
2:35.
Swimming the individual medley
during the dual meets will be Heim
and Irwin Johnson. And diving for
the Cards will be Ken Hirsch, who
improved greatly last season as a
junior, Jack Campbell, and Bob
Swain.
One of the top prospects on the
team is Eduardo Villaran, a third
quarter freshman from Lima, Peru.
A top middle distance freestyler,
Villaran won't be eligible for the
l varsity until after this year's NCAA
j meet, but will be able to swim dur
j ing spring quarter.

while Weiser got fifth in the longer
event.
Heim has best times of 58.5 for
100 backstroke, 2:08.8 for 200 back
stroke, 1:33 for 150 individual med
ley, and 52.2 for 100 freestyle. He
has excellent chances in both relays,
both backstroke races, and the in
dividual medley. Haynie's problem:
what events to swim him in.
The breaststroke races will be
. handled by two sophs, Winston
Black and Colbtirn Wilbur. Black,
j a transfer from Fullerton JC, has
bests of 1:04 and 2:29 for the 100
and 200-yard distances. Wilbur,
i along with Black, a graduate of
Palo Alto High, has done 1:07 and
2:35.
Swimming the individual medley
during the dual meets will be Heim
and Irwin Johnson. And diving for
the Cards will be Ken Hirsch, who
improved greatly last season as a
junior, Jack Campbell, and Bob
Swain.
One of the top prospects on the
team is Eduardo Villaran, a third
quarter freshman from Lima, Peru.
A top middle distance freestyler,
Villaran won't be eligible for the
l varsity until after this year's NCAA
j meet, but will be able to swim dur
j ing spring quarter.
"This year's team should be the best we've ever had," says Tom
Haynie about the Stanford swimming team.
Haynie is head coach of the aquatic powerhouse of the West
Coast. The Cards have won the PCC Southern Division champion
ship for the last four years and are presently working on a string

of over 50 straight dual meet vie- A
tories.
Haynie, never a pessimist, bases
his high hopes on the swimming
talents of Jim Gaughran, Larry
Heim, John Weiser, Dan Osborne,
and Winston Black. These five
should form the nucleus of an out
standing dual meet team, and one
that may possibly take second or
third place in the NCAA meet in
March.
The 21-man varsity team and the
15 - man freshman team has been
working out since the beginning of
the quarter.
The varsity, which opens its
schedule at San Jose State Friday
at 4 p.m., will he captained this
year by Gaughran, one of the
four seniors on the team.
Gaughran was PCC champ in the I
50 and 100 yard freestyle sprints
last year, was a two-year All-PCC
water polo forward, and placed in
the NCAA meet two years in a row,
swimming on the freestyle relay
team.
Gaughran hasn't really hit his
peak yet, however, and Haynie ex
pects him to surpass by far his ex- !
ploits of the past years. Already this
season he has turned in times of
23.0 for the 50 and 51.8 for the
100 freestyle. The PCC records in

these events are 22.8 and 51.6.
Six other sprinters are vying for
the spot behind Gaughran: Lee
Gunerson, a Senior; Bob Morris, a
junior; and Doug Ackerman, Carver
Nixon, Phil Gay, and Pete LaTour
ette.
In the longer freestyle events,
Haynie has. a four-man corps of
Dan Osborne, Bill Mclvor, Tad De
vine, and Chuck Clemans.
Osborne, a junior, holds the
PCC record of 2:f19.9 for 200 yards.
He had an attack of flu during
last year's NCAA meet, but with
good health is expected to place
high in the 1500 meters and 440-
| yard events. His best for the quar
ter is 4:42, just 1.5 seconds off the
league record.
Haynie's two backstrokers, Heim

third place in the 100 and 200 back
