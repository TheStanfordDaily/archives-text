Does the Pacific Coast Conference want to cut sagging football gate
receipts? Why don't they take a lesson from the basketball team? Think
of the crowds Stanford would draw with a schedule of two big inter
sectionals, San Jose State or COP away, and a home-and-home series
with Cal. USC. and UCLA. This schedule would mean nine full stadiums
and only one long trip away from home. The tenth week would be left
open for California's best to meet the Northwest's best for the right to
play in the Rose Bowl.
ff Warren Dailey can beat powerful Morgan Barofsky in the San Fran
cisco City Golf Tournament, he will probably meet British amateur
champion llarvie Ward in second-round play. If these two should clash,
don't count Dailey out. A( his best, the powerful Dailey is unbeatable,
lie recently drove (he 320-yard fifteenth green at Stanford. He should
outdrive the slender Ward, who wins most of his matches on the green,
by a full 20 yards.

George Yardley, ex-Stanford hoop flash, is finding the range for the
Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons in the National Basketball Association pro loop.
He recently meshed 20 points in one game, and in another battle his last
second tip-in gave the Pistons an 83-82 win. Yardley plays about 20 min
utes a game and boasts about an eight-point average, about par for a
rookie.

Want to know what makes a championship basketball team? Let's
look at Duquesne. One forward averages 13 points per game and "is the
greatest jumper in the history of the school." The other forward set the
school scoring mark two years ago. The center broke the forward's mark
lasi year. One guard is considered "the greatest sophomore prospect in
(lie history of the school" after scoring 25 points a game for the frosh
last year. The other guard is (5 ft. 7 in. tall. He is the weak link on the
team.

Swimmer Jim Gaughran is reported to have clocked a sensational :49.9
in the 100. World record is :49.2. Gaughran is the only senior going to the
nationals. The Cards figure to take about third this year and next year's
teams may finally break up the Yale-Ohio State strangle-hold on national
swim honors. Several members of this year's team are praying that
coach Tom Haynie won't start versatile Larry Heim in their event. Heim
could place in the nationals in six events, but he is only allowed to enter
three races in NCAA competition.

In analyzing the pennant races, it is clear that the Yanks and Dodgers
•hould breeze home if service returnees Gerry Coleman and Don New
comhe can show their old form. Can they do it? Remember that, as yet,
no ball player under 40 years of age has lost his ability in either World
War II or the Korean war. There is no reason to assume that Newcombe
and Coleman will reverse the trend.
Quote of the week is from Jimmy Dykes, manager of the Baltimore
Orioles who goes out on a limb with this prediction, "If we can get help
at third base and two or three of our pitchers come through, we might
make it tough on the rest of the second division."
