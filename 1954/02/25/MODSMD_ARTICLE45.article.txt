# Varsity Nine to Rely on Speed To Replace Last Year's Power
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
Everett Dean's varsity base
ball team begins a rugged 30-
game schedule Saturday against
the alumni without seven main
stays of the 1953 PCC champion
ship squad.
The power hitters of last year—
Jack Shepard (.399), Chuck EsSe
gian (.329), and Ray Swarts (,'2G4) —
are gone. Bob Murphy, one of Stan
ford's finest flingers, has donned the
regalia of the Oakland Oaks. The
ball - hawking center fielder Dick
Cole is gone as are Hal Hennacy
and steady Rog Irvine.
But Dean and Assistant Coach
Billy Alhouse have a good nucleus
to work with in the rebuilding job.
Dean has indicated that most posi
tions are wide open.
Nine letter m en — including
pitchers Don DeLong, Phil Page,
Mike Acker, and Ken Brown; in
fielders A 1 Talboy, Rich Scrama
glia, Warren Goodrich, and Tom
I) a n d u r a n d : and catcher Lerf
Swart/ — return to bolster tliis
year's club along with 10 candi
dates from both the Brave squad
and last season's frosh team.
Dean, who starts his filth season
at the helm, believes that this team
will be much different from the .'53
group. He described the PCC cham-

pions as a long ball hitting team
which had some good pitching. This
season, however, he looks for speed
to be the main asset and indicates
that the Indians will be running a
lot to take advantage of "college
kids throwing the ball around."

Dean doesn't believe he will have
a hitting team, but said, "You never
know what's around the corner.
Sometimes three or four kids will
have an unexpectedly good season
at tlte plate. We'll just have to wait
and see."
In addition to speed, the Cards are
expected to present a tight defense
and good patching. The pitching
staff should be strong with four vet
erans back, although according to
Dean there is no number one hurler
yet.
Aside from IVlurphy's 11-2 mark,
Acker, a right-banded fast-baller,
had the top winning percentage
last year, Suffering a lone setback
in five outings.
Brown, another right - bander,
was used mostly in relief, encoun
< tering great success against USC
when the Cards dumped the Tro
jans four times.
DeLong, wjno will turn out for
the squad Monday when the bas
ketball season will be over, could be

one of Dean's top pitchers if he
doesn't run into control trouble.
The busiest flinger, aside from
Murphy, was Page, who worked in
90'/? innings. Page had a lot of
tough luck in close ball games and,
like DeLong, has control problems.
Page was the number two hurler
last season and figures to be one of
Dean's big three.
Brave pitchers Ray Highsmith,
Gil Duncan, Ralph Cassacly, and
Dave Freeman, along with ex-frosh
Ray Young, Jack Heffelfinger, and
Al Dunn, are expected to battle for
starting assignments in the eighty ex
hibition games before the league
opener March 26 with UCLA.
The Indians have a sound in
field with two or three depend
able players at each position, hut
(he outfield is a question mark.
Len Swartz, who lettered behind
Shepard last year, has the inside
track on the catching position, al
though Clarke Nelson, up from the
Braves, is making Swartz hustle.
The graduation of Hennacy has
left the first-base job wide open
with four candidates including Tony
Serra, Rocky Furst, Al Talboy, and
Oleg SuzdalefT in contention.
Furst led the powerful frosh ball
club last year with four home rifns,
and SuzdalefT was a better than .300
hitter with the Braves.
Talboy, who was the regular

varsity right fielder, will probably
be back in the gardens to steady
an inexperienced outfield. Talboy
banged out 32 bits in 120 trips for
a .207 average and didn't commit
an error.
Serra, a promising San Francisco
athlete, enrolled in school in spring
quarter and will be eligible for var
sity competition.
Rich Scramaglia is the leading
keystone candidate although he is
being hard pressed by sophomore

Mickey Holzman. Scramaglia, a
junior, banged the ball at a .280 clip
in his second season of play after
breaking into the lineup in his
freshman year.
Warren Goodrich, who was all -
conference shortstop last season,
should enjoy his greatest year. He
was the second leading Card hit
ter at .1541 and his quick hands
accounted for many twin killings.
Behind Goodrich are Sid Hall and
George Selieck.
At third, Tom Dandurand, who
blasted two home runs out of the
Sunken Diamond last year and
starred in the NCAA play-offs, is
slated to go at third. Dean lias also
been trying Holzman at third in
addition to Frank Tenerello and
Bob Fisher.

The outfield is one of the major
worry areas since Talboy is the only
experienced player. Bob Evans, who
performed well with the frosh be
fore being injured, is battling with
an Evans named Terry for the left
field spot, and Sid Hall, a converted
infielder, haj» the edge in center.
Terry Evans hit .38!> with the
varsity last year in 11 at-bats.
Braves Dixie Workman and Gordon
Galloway are also making bids for
an outfield position.
