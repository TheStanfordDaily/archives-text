# This germanium refining method keeps impurities down to less than 5 parts in a billion
## 
### 
A new method of metal refining, currently in use
at the Western Electric plant at Allcntown, results
in the production of germanium that is better than
99.9999995 pure — Ihe highest degree of purity
ever attained in a manufactured product.
The need for germanium of such exceptional purity
came about when research by Bell Telephone I ab
oratories in the field of semi-conductors led to die
•development ot transistors, which are manufactured
by Western lilcctrie.
The transistor is a liny crystal device which can
amplify and oscillate. It reduces space require
ments and power consumption to a minimum.
Germanium crystals of the size required in transis

grown at Western Electric. At this stage in transis-

these elements can be introduced, it is necessary to

the impurities will not interfere with the elements
that arc deliberately added.
So Bell lelephonc Laboratories devised an en
tirely new method of purification, known as zone
refining, which was developed to a high-production
stage by Western Electric engineers.
In zone refining a bar of germanium is passed
through a heat zone so that a molten section trav
erses the length of the bar carrying the impurities
wilh it and leaving behind a solidified section of
higher purity. By the use of multiple heating zones
jn tandem, a number of molten sections traverse
the bar. Each reduces the impurity content thus
producing a bar which contains impurities in the
amount of less than five parts per billion.
Becatisc of the importance of the transistor in elec
tronics, the zone refining process-like so many
other Western Electric developments —has been
made available to companies licensed by Western

This is one more example of creative engineering

tor manufacture, other elements arc introduced in
microscopic quantities to aid in controlling the flow
of electrons through the germanium. But before
these elements can be introduced, it is necessary to
start with germanium of exceptional purity, so that
the impurities will not interfere with the elements
that arc deliberately added.
So Bell lelephonc Laboratories devised an en
tirely new method of purification, known as zone
refining, which was developed to a high-production
stage by Western Electric engineers.
In zone refining a bar of germanium is passed
through a heat zone so that a molten section trav
erses the length of the bar carrying the impurities
wilh it and leaving behind a solidified section of
higher purity. By the use of multiple heating zones
jn tandem, a number of molten sections traverse
the bar. Each reduces the impurity content thus
producing a bar which contains impurities in the
amount of less than five parts per billion.
Becatisc of the importance of the transistor in elec
tronics, the zone refining process-like so many
other Western Electric developments —has been
made available to companies licensed by Western
Electric to manufacture transistors.
This is one more example of creative engineering
by Western Electric men. Engineers of all skills —
mechanical, electrical, chemical, industrial, metal
lurgical, and civil —arc needed to help us show the
way in fundamental manufacturing techniques.
