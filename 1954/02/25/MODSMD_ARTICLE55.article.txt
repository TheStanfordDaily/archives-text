# Artist's Iron Animal Sculpture On Display Now in Art Gallery
## 
### 
The Stanford Art Gallery is now displaying the work of Torn Hardy, a
young artist who sculptures animals by using a welding torch. The torch
cuts through sheets of iron and rusts them at the..same time.
Several of Hardy's paintings and pieces of sculpture are included in the
exhibit, which will continue until March 14.
Hardy uses a variety of expressions and techniques in his sculpture.

The "Two Running Horses" rescind
ble prehistoric cave drawings, the
"Cow" employs cubism, and the
"Badger," naturalism.
Alfred Frankenstein, art and mu
sic critic for the San Francisco
Chronicle, wrote of the pieces now
on display, "The 'Flying Horse' is
the most remarkable of his works.
. . . The pieces transcend their ap
parent motifs to deal with the big
ger themes behind them. The "fi

♦
ger' is evil with a capital 'E'."
Thirty-two-year-old Hardy lives
on a sheep ranch near Eugene, Ore.
At. present he is teaching adult ed
ucation classes in painting, sculp
ture, and ceramics at the University
of Oregon, from which he was grad
uated in 15)42.
His works have been exhibited in
several art museums throughout the
West.
