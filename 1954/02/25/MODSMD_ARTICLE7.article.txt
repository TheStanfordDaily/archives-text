The Philippines arc making prog
ress toward the American ideals of
democracy, but there arc still over
whelming problems facing the new
government, according to Albert
Ravenholt, American Universities
Field Staff member, who spoke yes
terday afternoon in Cubbcrley Au
ditorium.
Prior to the granting of Philippine
independence in 1946 the United
States held control of the Islands
with the goal of preparing them for
eventual self-rule.
The United States administrators
were first faced with the problem of
developing a modern system of edu
cation, he explained. Some of the
American teachers who went into
an alien and often hostile environ
ment to accomplish this were
"among the great pioneers our so
ciety has produced," Ravenholt
said.
Ravenholt pointed out, however,
that this "projection onto the Phil
ippines of American concepts of
government left serious omissions in
the development of the society."
He cited the 1953 elections, in
which Ramon Magsaysay was cho
sen president, as the first, in which
the political bosses had been unable
to deliver the vote, and added, "This
i.s to me and to many Filipinos a
very encouraging fact."
