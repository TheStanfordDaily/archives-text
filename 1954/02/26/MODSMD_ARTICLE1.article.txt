# STEVENS SAYS WOULD DEFY MCCARTHY
## Stanford Basketballers End Season Against Bears Three Card Seniors Play Last Games 
### DON WEBSTER 
It's everything to gain and
nothing to lose for the Stanford
varsity basketball team this
weekend, as they conclude their
1953-54 season with a pair of
contests against California.
Certainly Coach Bob Burnett's
five has little pressure on them, for
it is mathematically impossible for
them to rise from the PCC South
ern Division cellar. However, the
Bears have several reasons for
wanting a pair of victories, and the
Cards are in a good position to
spoil the hopes of the Berkeleyites.
Tonight's game will be played at
Edwards Gym at Berkeley, with the
teams appearing at the Pavilion to
morrow night. Both games will
start at 8:30 p.m.
The season has been a disappoint
ing one for the basketballers in light
of pre-season expectations, but
rather successful in view of the
handicaps that have occurred.
Two injuries shattered the high
hopes of the cagers. Ron Tomsic,

stellar forward and leading scorer
last season, suffered a knee injury in
pre-season activity and was lost for
Uic year. Oleg SuzdalcfT suffered
both a leg injury and deep facial
cuts and was lost for about a month
during the peak of season play.
The Raines will he the filial pair
for three Stanford players. Co
captain SuzdalelT has scored 7ft
points in league play despite his
absence from several contests.
The other co-captain, Don Dc
long, has scored 7X points and
greatly aided the leant with his
scrappy play. I)avc Kppcrson was
a reserve for part of the season,
luit because of his fine play, Bur
nett recently moved him to the
first string.
The other starters for Stanford to
night will be center Russ Lawler, a
junior, and guard George Sclleck, a
sophomore.
Though the Bears have "also been
eliminated from any chance of tak
ing the division crown, they can still
make second place. After leading
the league for half the season, they
have faded in the past two weeks,
losing four straight visiting contests
to the southern California teams.
California took two from the In
dians in their last meeting-, but be
cause of the fast drop the Bears |
have taken, most experts are rat
ing the two teams as about even.
Despite the cellar spot of Stan
ford's cagers, they still have the two
players leading the league both in
scoring and scoring average.
Lawler is far in front with 178
points and a 17.8 average for con
ference play. Selleck is second with
155 points and a 15.4 mark. Though
Big Russ appears to have the lead
ership cinched, Selleck is closely
followed by Bear center Bob Mc-
Keen, who trails by only one scoring
point and .1 percentage point.

handicaps that have occurred.
Two injuries shattered the high
hopes of the cagers. Ron Tomsic,

stellar forward and leading scorer
last season, suffered a knee injury in
pre-season activity and was lost for
Uic year. Oleg SuzdalcfT suffered
both a leg injury and deep facial
cuts and was lost for about a month
during the peak of season play.
The Raines will he the filial pair
for three Stanford players. Co
captain SuzdalelT has scored 7ft
points in league play despite his
absence from several contests.
The other co-captain, Don Dc
long, has scored 7X points and
greatly aided the leant with his
scrappy play. I)avc Kppcrson was
a reserve for part of the season,
luit because of his fine play, Bur
nett recently moved him to the
first string.
The other starters for Stanford to
night will be center Russ Lawler, a
junior, and guard George Sclleck, a
sophomore.
Though the Bears have "also been
eliminated from any chance of tak
ing the division crown, they can still
make second place. After leading
the league for half the season, they
have faded in the past two weeks,
losing four straight visiting contests
to the southern California teams.
California took two from the In
dians in their last meeting-, but be
cause of the fast drop the Bears |
have taken, most experts are rat
ing the two teams as about even.
Despite the cellar spot of Stan
ford's cagers, they still have the two
players leading the league both in
scoring and scoring average.
Lawler is far in front with 178
points and a 17.8 average for con
ference play. Selleck is second with
155 points and a 15.4 mark. Though
Big Russ appears to have the lead
ership cinched, Selleck is closely
followed by Bear center Bob Mc-
Keen, who trails by only one scoring
point and .1 percentage point.
It's everything to gain and
nothing to lose for the Stanford
varsity basketball team this
weekend, as they conclude their
1953-54 season with a pair of
contests against California.
Certainly Coach Bob Burnett's
five has little pressure on them, for
it is mathematically impossible for
them to rise from the PCC South
ern Division cellar. However, the
Bears have several reasons for
wanting a pair of victories, and the
Cards are in a good position to
spoil the hopes of the Berkeleyites.
Tonight's game will be played at
Edwards Gym at Berkeley, with the
teams appearing at the Pavilion to
morrow night. Both games will
start at 8:30 p.m.
The season has been a disappoint
ing one for the basketballers in light
of pre-season expectations, but
rather successful in view of the
handicaps that have occurred.
