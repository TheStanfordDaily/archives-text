## 
### 
About 170 pints of blood—little over half the hoped-for total of

M 1. ......

coming in."
Those students who did show up
to donate were whisked through the

of the usual hour.
Blood collection will continue to
day on the main floor of the Wom
en's Clubhouse. Over 200 appoint
ment spaces are still open.
Donors should not eat anything

Of the appointees who showed up

blood pressure, and low hemoglobin
count.
A doctor, a custodian, 12 regis
tered nurses, and some 10 volunteer
workers were on hand to process

Students who wish to donate
blood today—regardless of wheth
er they have appointments—may
