### 
Dr. Eugene Staley stressed the
importance of an active interest by
the United States in the future of
the world's undeveloped countries
last night before a near capacity au
dience in Bowman Alumni House.
The Stanford Research Institute
Economist pointed out, "the kind
of world we live in should he of
real interest to the people of the
United States because our country
possesses 40 per cent of the world's
income and therefore controls
about half of its political and eco
nomic power."
Dr. Staley emphasized, however,
that the undeveloped areas of the
world hold a balance of power pop
ulation-wise over the U.S. He said
whether these countries "choose de
mocracy or communism or some
other totalitarian form of govern
ment will in the long run determine
the history of our planet."
Dr. Staley argued, therefore, that
such programs as Point Four and
"the other technological advance
ment plans" arc essential if the U.S.
is going to win the friendship of the
undeveloped countries.
He warned his audience that the
Communist world "has shifted
H.s thrust of the proletarian revo
lution" from the highly developed
! countries to thr undeveloped na
tions of the world in an effort to
I gain more political power for its
| side.
Dr. Staley feels that unkss wr

munism will seize the upper hand,
Dr. Staley concluded, "if the un
| developed countries so to commu
i nism. we are sunk. Either the tech
nological benefits of western civili
zation will have to become general
ized the world over, or these benefits
will be lost to even the western
countries who now posse:., them
