# ARMY SECRETARY'S
## Statement Wins Ike's Support 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 (UP) — Army Secretary Robert T.
Stevens said tonight with President Eisenhower's full backing
that he will "never" let Army personnel be "browbeaten or humili
ated" by Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy.
McCarthy promptly retorted that Stevens made a "completely
false statement" when he said he received assurances from McCar
thy's permanent investigating subcommittee regarding the treat
ment of future Army witnesses.
Stevens' statement, which also was approved by Defense Sec
retary Charles E. Wilson, followed a two-hour White House con
ference which Mr. Eisenhower attended for 30 minutes. Present
were Stevens, Vice-President Richard M. Nixon, and top Defense
end Justice Department officials.
Stevens said he received "assurances" that McCarthy and his

subcommittee would not "permit"*!
any "future" abuses of Army offi- j
cers called to testify.
McCarthy, after reading Ste
vens' statement, said he made it
"very elear" to the Army Secre
tary that if witnesses "are not
frank and truthful—whether mil
itary personnel or not—they will
be examined vigorously to get the
truth about Communist activi
ties."
McCarthy told reporters, "I very
carefully explained to the Secre
tary" at Wednesday's "truce" meet
ing "that he was Secretary of the
Army and not running the commit
tee."
He disagreed violently with Ste
vens' statement that Brig. Gen.
Ralph W. Zwicker, center of a heat
ed McCarthy hearing in New Yoik
last week, was deprived of counsel.
Stevens said in his statement that
future Army witnesses would be
provided legal counsel.
"He knows Zwicker did not de
mand counsel," McCarthy said.
"Witnesses in the past have been al
lowed counsel whenever they want.
The condition will continue in the
future."
"If lie (Zwicker) had asked for
a lawyer, he would have had ev
ery opportunity to get one," Mc-
Carthy said. "If it is unpleasant
for us to get the truth, I can't be
responsible."
Stevens said in his statement, re
leased at both the White House and
Defense Department, that he never
would have agreed to his "memo
randum of understanding" Wednes
day with McCarthy unless he had
guarantees as to how Army wit
nesses would be treated.
"I want to make it perfectly clear
that should such abuses occur in
any quarter in the future I shall
once again take all steps at my dis
posal to protect the rights of indi
viduals in this Department," he said.
