# Excom and You
## 
### 
The Executive Committee spent at least an
hour of its Wednesday night meeting discussr
ing a problem which is of concern to most of the
student organizations in schools all over the
country —student interest in the affairs of their
school's government.
Members of Excom indicated by their discus
sion that they are now more clearly aware of
the details and effects of that problem at Stan
ford than they have been all year. During the
course of the meeting, such comments as "Ex
com is a failure" and "Nobody knows what
Excorn is" were used to describe student inter
est in ASSU affairs and Excom's effectiveness
in representing student opinions and views.
Such comments, we believe, are not truly
descriptive of the Executive Committee's
work and student awareness of that work.
Rut we would agree with the general con
sensus to which those comments led—that
Excom's representation is not satisfactory
and that it cannot he satisfactory until there
is an effective line of communication be
tween the students and their representatives
on Excom.
To encourage the strengthening of this "line
of communication," the Committee expressed
the desire that all students be aware of the de
sire of Excom to learn what the student body
is thinking on specific issues and what issues

individual students would like Excom to con
sider.
To this end, students may take advantage of
two opportunities which are open to them: at
tendance and participation in the weekly Wed
nesday night meetings of Excom and participa
tion in the scheduling of Excom's agenda by
submitting subjects for discussion.
Each of Excom's meetings is open to the stu
dents and the Committee has agreed that it will
attempt to arrange meeting places with suffi
cient attendance facilities. The normal time for
these meetings is 7:30, Wednesday night. Pre
liminary announcements are made in The Daily.
Any student may submit a subject for the
consideration of Excom by presenting that
subject in written form at the ASSU office in
the Union on the Monday before the Excom
meeting. A copy of the agenda is prepared
for distribution on Wednesday and for pub
lication in The Daily.
The members of the Executive Committee are
sincere in hoping that students will take advan
tage of those opportunities. They believe, as
does The Daily, that (here is a latent interest
by the students in the affairs of the ASSU and
that that interest may be expressed through
participation in Excom meetings and the sched
uling of Excom's agenda.
