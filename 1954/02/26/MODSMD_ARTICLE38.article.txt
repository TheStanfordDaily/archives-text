# Baseball Season Opens
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball team, defending PCC champion, opens its I
1954 season tomorrow, and the first game might turn out to be both 1
the toughest and the most interesting.
Starting time for the game in the Sunken Diamond is 2:30, and
there is no admission charge.
The Cards face an alumni team far different from most alumni

squads. Included on the team are a
number of outstanding players, in
cluding the nucleus of last season's
varsity.
The opening battery for the alums
will be particularly hard to score on.
Bob Murphy, who led the league in
pitching as an Indian last year and
went on to play with the Oakland.
Acorns, will start on the mound.
Catching will be Jack Shepard, who
after hitting .399 for Stanford
starred with the Denver Bears in
professional baseball.
Shepard is leaving tomorrow
night after the game for the Pitts
burgh Pirate camp at Fort Pierce,
Florida, lie expects not only to
make the Pirate club this season
but to catch at lea-,t half the Na
tional Leaguers' Raines.
Three other players of the 1953
club will be on the alumni starting
nine: Chuck Essegian, who as a
Card often rattled the long Sunken
Diamond left field fence with hom
ers; Ray Swarts, power-hitting third
baseman who recently signed with
the Hollywood Stars; and Rog Ir
vine, who alternated with Rich
Scramaglia at second base last sea
son.
Other former Stanford greats who
will play for the alums include
pitcher Dave Dahle, third sacker
Dave Melton, and second baseman
Art Abrahamson.
Only two of the starters for the
varsity are returning first-stringers
from last season. Scramaglia and
shortstop Warren Goodrich will
form the keystone combination.
