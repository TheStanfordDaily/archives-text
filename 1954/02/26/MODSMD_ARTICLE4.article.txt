## 
### 
The federal government is expected to arrive at an "early de
cision" to release Stanford Village property which it owns, Menlo
Park City Manager C. L. Longson reported from Washington yes
terday.
Longson, in the nation's capital with Mayor Michael Belangie

of Menlo Park conferred Wednesday*
with officials of the Public Housing
Administration, a branch of the
Federal Home Finance Administra
tion, and added he felt "rather en
couraged."
The two Menlo Park city officials
arc in Washington to present their
city's arguments regarding the Vil
lage property. Longson said the
federal officials seemed impressed
with their arguments.
Stanford made its first overture
to purchase the site of the former
military hospital more than a year
ago when it was declared surplus.
Commenting on Longson's state
ment about an early decision, a
spokesman for the Stanford Re
search Institute, which is located
on Village land, said yesterday the
Institute is "delighted to know
progress is being made in that di
rection."
He said SRI looks for a final de
cision regarding the property
"with much interest."
Earlier this month SRI announced
it had begun a search for a new lo
cation for its facilities when it be
came apparent that University at
tempts to purchase the Village
might lengthen indefinitely or even
fail.
SRI prefers to locate its new
center at the Village but it must
quickly decide on a site, for the
building if a full research pro
gram is to be maintained, an SRI
spokesman said.
Longson said that if the govern
ment holds out for the full market
value in the sale of the property—
$15,000 to $20,000 an acre—Sßl will
be forced out of the Village and will
be relocated on Stanford lands in
South Palo Alto.
Longson explained, however, that
a federal law does not bind the gov
ernment to seek the full market
value of the property. It could sell
it at. original cost, reportedly about
$1,000 per acre.
Stanford could purchase the prop
erty bccausc it. qualifies as a school
under the Lantham Act. That act
gives the government a choice of
decision to sell the property either
to private parties at full market
value or to a political subdivision or
school at original cost, according to
Longson.
