### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 (UP)â€”Rep. Jacob K. Javits (R., N.Y.) an
nounced he will introduce a bill tomorrow to correct "excesses"
by the McCarthy subcommittee, the House Un-American Activi
ties Committee, and the Senate Internal Security Committee.
Javits' bill would replace these groups with a 14-man Senate-

House Committee on Internal Secu
rity and provide strict rules of "fair
procedure."
Meanwhile, Joseph McCarthy,
fresh from his feud with Army Sec
retary Robert Stevens, said today he
does not believe President Eisen
hower wants to curb the power of
his Red-hunting investigating sub
committee.
McCarthy, talking to reporters
in New York, said not only docs
he not believe Mr. Eisenhower
wants to curb his power but "I
can't conceive of the President
doing anything at all that would
interfere with eliminating Com
munists from government."
McCarthy was asked specifically
about reports that the White House
had asked other Republican mem
bers of his subcommittee to make it
a point to attend all hearings of the
group.
"The White House has said noth
ing, but other members are invited
and are always welcome to be pres
ent at hearings," he replied. "I don't
criticize them for not being present
because many of them have a mil
lion things to do."
Meanwhile, the Army has
promised to produce two privates
McCarthy wants to question on
whether they signed loyalty oaths
when they entered the service.
Sen. John L. McClcllan (D., Ark.),
a member of the McCarthy subcom
mittee, said a notice he received of
the hearing identified one of the
men as Pvt. Marvin Belski, New
York, a physician who is stationed
at Murphy General Hospital at
Waltham, Mass. Belski is serving as
a medical private instead of an offi
cer because he refused to sign a
loyalty oath.
McClellan said the notice identi
fied the second soldier as Pvt. Sid
Rubenstein, stationed at Fort Banks,
Winthrop, Mass. However, a Sidney
Rubenstein of New York, who was
discharged from Fort Banks two
weeks ago, said he had not received
a notice tb appear. He also said he
had signed a loyalty oath.
