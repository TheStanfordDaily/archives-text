## 
### 
One hundred sixty-eight pints
of blood were collected in the
last day of Stanford's blood i
drive Friday, bringing the final
two-day total to 351.
Some 70 persons not having ap
pointments showed up to donate
Friday, while 23 others we t re turned
away as ineligible.
According to nurse Irene Brun
dage, the facilities provided by the
Red Cross "could easily have han
dled" up to 300 donors a day.
She added that it is "hard to com
pare" the response to a limited
drive to the response generated by
the v/eek-long drive held in the Pa
vilion last spring when the "patri
otic urge" was a bigger factor.
Drive co-chairman Fred Stern
said the drive had been "disap
pointing," but commended the
work of blood drive workers. He
named Kay Johnson, head of
scheduling, and Ann Kleerup,
head of publicity, as outstanding
workers.
Two more drives will be held in
spring quarter—April 21, 22, 23, and
May 20, 21. According to Stern,
about 300 appointment cards have
been l'eceived for these dates and a
drive for more donors will be held
spring quarter.
Blood collected in last week's
drive and in future drives will be
processed into blood derivatives for
use by the Department, of Defense.
Some will be shipped overseas in its
whole form.
The blood drives are sponsored by
Cardinals and the junior class.
