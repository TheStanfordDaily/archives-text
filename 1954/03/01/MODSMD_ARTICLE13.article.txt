# Liquor Is Issue As Legislature Opens
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 28 (UP) — I
Gov. Goodwin J. Knight opens to
morrow the 1954 session of the State
Legislature at which his fireworks
laden request for liquor reform will
overshadow his proposal for a $1,-
400.000,000-plus budget.
Knight in his first address to the
Legislature as Governor will almost
certainly ask that liquor control be
divorced from the State Board of
Equalization.
Knight will promise that his
budget will require no new or
higher taxes. While be has re
leased only the operations section
of his proposed budget, most of
the remainder consists of fixed
charges that will bring the total
to more than $1,400,000,000.
The Governor put the liquor
problem squarely in the lap of the
Legislature when he made it the
number one item of the special ses
sion call he issued Friday permitting
the Legislature to consider 24 items
in addition to the budget.
Normally in the even years, the
Legislature meets only to consider
the budget and is required to act on
it within 30 days. Under the special
session call, however, debate on oth
er matters may continue beyond the
constitutional time limit.
