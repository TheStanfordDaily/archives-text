# Card Cagers End Season With 80-70 Saturday Win
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Stanford's basketballers closed their 1954 season on a happy
note Saturday night with a satisfying 80-70 victory over a fired-up
California quintet.
The Cards were unable to stop the Bears Friday evening,
though, as Cal rolled to a 98-80 win in a race-horse cage contest

that marked the last appearance of'
a Nibs Price-coached team on the
Berkeley court.
Cal had the same trouble both
nights: inability to score in the last
four minutes. Friday, paced by for
ward Dick Tamberg, who rolled up
38 points in the game, the Bears
tried during the closing minutes
both to hit the magic hundred mark
and to give Tamberg 40 points.
Repeated shots at the basket
missed the mark, and the hosts had
to be satisfied with their final 98
tallies.
The Bears left no question as to
the outcome of the gams midway
through the first quarter. Stanford
came from behind to tie the game
at 17-17, but a California rush gave
the hosts a 31-23 lead at the quar
ter's end. The Cards were then out
scored in every subsequent period,
trailing by a 56-43 count at half
time.
Tamberg had a truly fantastic

night. He hit on every conceiv
able kind of shot, scoring 17 field
goals and just four three, throws.
The Bears were obviously fired up
with a "Win This for Nibs" theme.
After the game the coach of 30 years
at Berkeley was carried off the
court on the shoulders of the trium
phant players.
The 80 points Stanford scored
would have been enough to win 21
of the 25 games the Cards have
played this season, but Friday it
was not enough. The fired-up Bears
averaged 50 per cent from the floor

on shooting, sparked by Tamberg.
The second game marked sev

sides the victory, the Cards placed
men one-two in league scoring.
Indian center Rnss Lavvlcr also
