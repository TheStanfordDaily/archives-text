# Card Cagers End Season With 80-70 Saturday Win
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Stanford's basketballers closed their 1954 season on a happy
note Saturday night with a satisfying 80-70 victory over a fired-up
California quintet.
The Cards were unable to stop the Bears Friday evening,
though, as Cal rolled to a 98-80 win in a race-horse cage contest

that marked the last appearance of'
a Nibs Price-coached team on the
Berkeley court.
Cal had the same trouble both
nights: inability to score in the last
four minutes. Friday, paced by for
ward Dick Tamberg, who rolled up
38 points in the game, the Bears
tried during the closing minutes
both to hit the magic hundred mark
and to give Tamberg 40 points.
Repeated shots at the basket
missed the mark, and the hosts had
to be satisfied with their final 98
tallies.
The Bears left no question as to
the outcome of the gams midway
through the first quarter. Stanford
came from behind to tie the game
at 17-17, but a California rush gave
the hosts a 31-23 lead at the quar
ter's end. The Cards were then out
scored in every subsequent period,
trailing by a 56-43 count at half
time.
Tamberg had a truly fantastic

night. He hit on every conceiv
able kind of shot, scoring 17 field
goals and just four three, throws.
The Bears were obviously fired up
with a "Win This for Nibs" theme.
After the game the coach of 30 years
at Berkeley was carried off the
court on the shoulders of the trium
phant players.
The 80 points Stanford scored
would have been enough to win 21
of the 25 games the Cards have
played this season, but Friday it
was not enough. The fired-up Bears
averaged 50 per cent from the floor

on shooting, sparked by Tamberg.
The second game marked sev
cral triumphs (or Stanford. Re
sides the victory, the Cards placed
men one-two in league scoring.
Indian center Rnss Lavvlcr also
joined (he elite of the 4 1ft!) Club"
by meshing 11 tallies. It also
marked a l»ne close for three
Stanford seniors who played t lieu
last game.
The contcst was close all the way
and Stanford had a lead wit!
about three minutes remaining. Tb
Bears blew the game as Tamberg
who had sparked the previou
night's win. fouled out.
With the three-minute rule in ef
feet, California players fouled fou
times within two minutes, givin
the Cards eight free throws. Th
first, three of these were sunk b
Barry Brown, and settled the ques
tion of the winning team.
Lawler before the scries bep;m le<
the league by 22 points, bavin
scored 178 markers. Sophomor
guard George Selleck was second
with 155, but Bear center Bob Mc- j
Keen was breathing down his neck j
with 154 poitns.
Lawler's 21 points Friday left I
him just three short on the 400 j
mark. His 11 Saturday brought
him into the club, along with just
five other players: Hank Luisetti,
George Yardley, Ed Tucker, Jim
Rainstead. ami lion Toinsic.
The prospective battle between
Selleck and McKeen turned out
to be no contest. McKeen scored
only 9 against Selleck's 12 the first
night, and the Card guard rolled
Saturday with 20 points, McKeen
tallying only 11. McKeen, by the
way, scored 14 out of 19 free throws,
which puts his season's average at
over 80 per cent.
Stanford was almost as red-hot
Saturday as the Bears were Friday.
They hit 52 per cent of their floor
shots, though their free throw rec
ord was not outstanding.
The trio of Card seniors played
almost the entire game. Dave Ep
person. Don DeLong. and Oleg Suz
daleff ended good years for them
selves by scoring 10, 16, and 13
points respectively.
After the game, Coach Bob Bur
nett was full of praise for the sen
iors. "DeLong has played good ball
for us this season, and would have
been even better had he had Tom
sic as his running mate. Dave has
worked hard this season and well
deserved the first-string berth he
earned a few weeks ago,
"And as for Oleg, I am very
sorrv he is leaving us. He is one
of the best little men I have ever
seen, and also one of the smartest
basketball players I know of.
, "These three players are all that
is left of the last freshman team
I coached. They have been with me
lor four years, and I am deeply sor
i ry to see them go."
However, Burnett is looking for
j ward to next year, when he has the
two top - scoring players in the
league returning and a number of
outstanding prospects from the
freshman team.

Tamberg had a truly fantastic

night. He hit on every conceiv

goals and just four three, throws.
The Bears were obviously fired up
with a "Win This for Nibs" theme.
After the game the coach of 30 years
at Berkeley was carried off the
court on the shoulders of the trium

The 80 points Stanford scored
would have been enough to win 21
of the 25 games the Cards have

him into the club, along with just
five other players: Hank Luisetti,

The prospective battle between
Selleck and McKeen turned out
to be no contest. McKeen scored
only 9 against Selleck's 12 the first
night, and the Card guard rolled
Saturday with 20 points, McKeen
tallying only 11. McKeen, by the
way, scored 14 out of 19 free throws,
which puts his season's average at
over 80 per cent.
Stanford was almost as red-hot
Saturday as the Bears were Friday.
They hit 52 per cent of their floor
shots, though their free throw rec
ord was not outstanding.
The trio of Card seniors played
almost the entire game. Dave Ep
person. Don DeLong. and Oleg Suz
daleff ended good years for them
selves by scoring 10, 16, and 13
points respectively.
After the game, Coach Bob Bur
nett was full of praise for the sen
iors. "DeLong has played good ball
for us this season, and would have
been even better had he had Tom
sic as his running mate. Dave has
worked hard this season and well
deserved the first-string berth he
earned a few weeks ago,
"And as for Oleg, I am very

basketball players I know of.

Stanford's basketballers closed their 1954 season on a happy
note Saturday night with a satisfying 80-70 victory over a fired-up
California quintet.
The Cards were unable to stop the Bears Friday evening,
though, as Cal rolled to a 98-80 win in a race-horse cage contest

that marked the last appearance of'
a Nibs Price-coached team on the
Berkeley court.
Cal had the same trouble both
nights: inability to score in the last
four minutes. Friday, paced by for
ward Dick Tamberg, who rolled up
38 points in the game, the Bears
tried during the closing minutes
both to hit the magic hundred mark
and to give Tamberg 40 points.
Repeated shots at the basket
missed the mark, and the hosts had
to be satisfied with their final 98
tallies.
The Bears left no question as to
the outcome of the gams midway
through the first quarter. Stanford
came from behind to tie the game
at 17-17, but a California rush gave
the hosts a 31-23 lead at the quar

The prospective battle between
Selleck and McKeen turned out
to be no contest. McKeen scored
only 9 against Selleck's 12 the first
night, and the Card guard rolled
Saturday with 20 points, McKeen
tallying only 11. McKeen, by the
way, scored 14 out of 19 free throws,
which puts his season's average at
over 80 per cent.
Stanford was almost as red-hot
Saturday as the Bears were Friday.
They hit 52 per cent of their floor
shots, though their free throw rec
ord was not outstanding.
The trio of Card seniors played
almost the entire game. Dave Ep

daleff ended good years for them
selves by scoring 10, 16, and 13
points respectively.
After the game, Coach Bob Bur
nett was full of praise for the sen
iors. "DeLong has played good ball
for us this season, and would have
been even better had he had Tom
sic as his running mate. Dave has
worked hard this season and well
deserved the first-string berth he
earned a few weeks ago,
"And as for Oleg, I am very
sorrv he is leaving us. He is one
of the best little men I have ever
seen, and also one of the smartest
basketball players I know of.
, "These three players are all that
is left of the last freshman team
I coached. They have been with me
lor four years, and I am deeply sor
i ry to see them go."
However, Burnett is looking for
j ward to next year, when he has the
two top - scoring players in the
league returning and a number of
outstanding prospects from the
freshman team.
Stanford's basketballers closed their 1954 season on a happy
note Saturday night with a satisfying 80-70 victory over a fired-up
California quintet.
The Cards were unable to stop the Bears Friday evening,
though, as Cal rolled to a 98-80 win in a race-horse cage contest

that marked the last appearance of'
a Nibs Price-coached team on the
Berkeley court.
Cal had the same trouble both
nights: inability to score in the last
four minutes. Friday, paced by for
ward Dick Tamberg, who rolled up
38 points in the game, the Bears
tried during the closing minutes
both to hit the magic hundred mark
and to give Tamberg 40 points.
Repeated shots at the basket
missed the mark, and the hosts had
to be satisfied with their final 98
tallies.
The Bears left no question as to
the outcome of the gams midway
through the first quarter. Stanford
came from behind to tie the game
at 17-17, but a California rush gave
the hosts a 31-23 lead at the quar
ter's end. The Cards were then out
scored in every subsequent period,
trailing by a 56-43 count at half
time.
Tamberg had a truly fantastic

night. He hit on every conceiv
able kind of shot, scoring 17 field
goals and just four three, throws.
The Bears were obviously fired up
with a "Win This for Nibs" theme.
After the game the coach of 30 years
at Berkeley was carried off the
court on the shoulders of the trium
phant players.
The 80 points Stanford scored
would have been enough to win 21
of the 25 games the Cards have
played this season, but Friday it
was not enough. The fired-up Bears
averaged 50 per cent from the floor

on shooting, sparked by Tamberg.
The second game marked sev
cral triumphs (or Stanford. Re
sides the victory, the Cards placed
men one-two in league scoring.
Indian center Rnss Lavvlcr also
joined (he elite of the 4 1ft!) Club"
by meshing 11 tallies. It also
marked a l»ne close for three
Stanford seniors who played t lieu
last game.
The contcst was close all the way
and Stanford had a lead wit!
