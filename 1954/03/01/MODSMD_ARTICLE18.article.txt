# NSA Meeting 'Disappointing'
## 
### 
Thirty - one delegates from
seven Bay Area colleges attend
ed the conference on student
government sponsored by the
National Students Association
at Mills College Saturday.
Twenty-three of the schools in
vited did not send delegates. Stan
lord NSA Co-ordinator Guy Shoup
reported that members of the NSA
District Council who planned the
conference described attendance as
"disappointing."
Most of the students who attended
came from the three sponsoring
NSA schoolsâ€”Stanford, Mills, and
the University of California. Other
students came from Santa Clara,
University of San Francisco, San
Francisco State, and the College of
Arts and Crafts in Oakland.
Because of the small attendance,
only four workshops were held in
stead of the scheduled seven.
The four were: Student Govern
ment; Social Activities and Rush
ing; Curriculum Evaluation; and a
combination of Rally Committees,
Honor Code, and Student Press.
''It was certainly well publicized
and well planned," Shoup com
mented. "Facilities were excel
lent."
The fact that so many schools ig
nored the invitation, he guessed,
"represents as far as I can see re
sentment of NSA pressure. I have a
feeling that is why San Jose, for in
stance, didn't come."
Commenting on the NSA ques
tion-and-answer session which fol
lowed the discussion workshops,
Shoup said that SFS and Santa
Clara delegates seemed interested in
joining NSA.
Delegates Barbara Green and
Alice Kwong reported to Shoup
that they had considered the con
ference personally worth while
for them.
The Stanford delegation included
Shoup, Miss Green, Miss Kwong,
Don Ham, Bill Dickinson, Harmon
Brown, and Mary Margaret Frazer.
