## Investigation of Investigations 
### 
The harsh treatment accorded Brigadier Gen
eral Ralph W. Zwicker when he testified on
Communist activities in the army, and the re
sulting McCarthy Stevens feud, has had one
good result. Top Republicans have decided
they are going to clamp down on the methods
employed by Congressional investigating com
mittees.
Representative Jacob K. lavits (R. ( N.Y.) has
announced he v/ill introduce a bill today to cor
rect abuses by the Senate Permanent Investiga
tions Subcommittee, the House Un-American
Activities Committee, and the Senate Internal
Security Committee.
Under his plan a joint Senate-House commit
tee on internal security composed of 14 men
would replace the three investigating groups.
The bill also provides strict rules of "fair pro
cedure" for the committee.
All this is the result of a four-point program
outlined by White House aides—with the ap
proval of President Eisenhower — to improve
the manners and methods of investigators.
Briefly, the plan calls for:
1. An end to one-man subcommittee investi

gations; 2. limitations on the use of subpoenas;
3. establishment in practice, not just theory, of
the right of a witness to have counsel; 4. ade
quate notice of hearings for committee mem
bers.
With special reference to McCarthy's com
mittee, administration officials have urged the
other GOP members of the group, Senators
Karl Mundt of South Dakota, Everett Dirksen of
Illinois, and Charles E. Potter of Michigan, to
cancel conflicting duties and attend all hearings
on alleged Communist activities. They hope
that greater participation by these senators will
erase the "one man rule" label from the com
mittee.
Such plans, we feel, are a big step in the
right direction. If Republican leaders see that
they are carried through, it will be a major vic
tory for Eisenhower and his supporters.
The need for this "investigation of investiga
tions" was clearly outlined last week. The Sen
ate Policy Committee has announced it will act
on the White House proposals.
All we need now are the results.
