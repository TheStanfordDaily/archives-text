# PRIVATE LIFE

### LARRY CAHN 
I know that you have all heard it just as I have
heard it, that oft repeated phrase, "The Army will be
good for you; it will change you and make a man
out of you."
After four months of service I fail to believe it.

It'is not that the Army is going
to hurt you, but when a man is
taken into the service today, I
feel that he is pretty much what
he is going to be. His character
has developed to an extent where,
using two extremes, he is either
basically good, or basically bad.
Some men do see-saw.
The Army is not going to
change the good man, unless pos
sibly for the worse, but even

(hat would be the fault of the individual not resist
ing temptations, the same temptations that must be
resisted in civilian life. And I don't believe the
Army will change the bad man. I have too often
seen the bad man jiist run away, just go AWOL. He
just won't put up with the discipline the Army de
mands. And when he does it's only a temporary sub
mission to power.
Arid for the see-saws, that unhackhoned. easily
swayed group in between, well they can go either
way. But in civilian life they would also soon come
to a fork and would have to go one way or the
other.
No, I believe that the Army won't make a man

out of you; they might increase the tendencies you
already have, but switch a man from good to bad, or
bad to good, no. You can't teach an old dog new
tricks and you can't change the character of ma
tured man in a few brief months.
Even the physical change which many go through
is only temporary and seldom lasting. At best the
Army may change one physically, but very rarely
mentally.
Let me caution all of you who have the service
ahead of you. It is an entirely different life than the
Stanford Utopia we all are used to. It's very real
istic. And the changes are remarkable; the differences
almost impossible at times to assimilate.
But you will have to accept them. And the sooner
you play it the Army way, which actually few have
trouble doing, the better off you will he. Adjusting
yourself to the Army way of life is not at all an
imposition upon your character, or a permanent
change of life; rather it is a temporary going along
with the rules of the game, playing it smart and
making it easier on yourself. It's nothing that will
harm you when you return to civilian status.
And il' you don't conform you'll be in for it. They
can make it plenty rough for those that play it wise.
I have often compared the Airny to one huge en
gulfing river which sweeps all in front of it. And
the draftee is only a small twig or leaf swept along.
Struggle will only end in eventual battering and sub
mission. It's much easier to simply float with the
river over the course; the river is incessant; the twig
or leaf must submit.
