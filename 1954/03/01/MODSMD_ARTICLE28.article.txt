FLORA AND FAUNA OF OUR
FAIR UNIVERSITY : 111
In this, the final article of the series, we are going
to cover a few of the categories missed in the previ
ous two dissertations. Here we will cover odds and
ends, life and low life, flotsam and jetsam, etc. Again,
you may find some people or types have been omit-

ted for space considerations.
The Purling Pearl: This gal
brings her knitting to each and
â€¢ very class, lecture, or lab. Those
who have tho misfortune to sit
next to one of these human looms
will find themselves, on close in
spection, to be a mass of welts
and punctures where the clatter
ing needles have penetrated the
flesh: Your flesh. Also, the more
absorbing the lecture, the more

often the girls drop their needles. It you re any sort
of a gentleman, you'll pick them up for her. If you're
like me, you'll just glare balefully.
The Coffee-Drinking Cellar Lout is an interesting
type. Rarely does one of this variety attend a lecture,
they seem to feel that reading the text is the only
golden clue. One would expect that the Cellar might
be bare come Finals Week, but such is not the case.
Members of this group saunter to the class, pick up
the exam, flash an Honor Code Observed smile at
the prof, and head for the companionship and peace
of the Cellar.
Here (hey write the exam (in coffee of course,
cheaper than ink, same consistency and color),.swig
a cup of the ghastly brew, and stagger off to hand
in the blue hook. C.uess where they go then. Straight
back to the Cellar and another cup of coffee.
These boys stick to the place like lost souls. Those
who have drinking partners of the opposite sex con

verse with them; those who are not so unfortunate
sit and gaze off with an indescribable loneliness. Oc
casionally the hum of conversation is punctuated by
the rustling of a page, as someone scans the all-im
portant text, or a loud and slightly annoying noise
as someone hits the bottom of a cup, but otherwise,
the place has nothing to offer. Just one word about
Cellar coffee: Ugh.
The last of the campus pills is the Late-Evening
Visitor. This apparition is commonly in the form of
a student come to see your roommate about a
homework assignment he can't crack, the R.A. who
wonders how in hell you could ever get a smoke
up in THAT course, or the minion of the law who
drops in to give you (he Dragnet treatment for a
minor infraction of a long-forgotten blue law. (I
once had one of these laddies in blue try to change
a harmless visit into an experience meeting. By the
time he got the hint I was ready for bed. I was
blue too, and i( was well-nigh time to get up. None
of your business what he wanted in the first place.)
To return fo the roommate seeker: your room
mate isn't there, hasn't been for four days, and prob
ably won't be back for another four, but this guy
will stay to leer at the pictures on the wall, listen to
Beethoven's Ninth in its entirety, tell you what you're
doing wrong in your math assignment (he's a hu
manities major) and generally lose friends and annoy
people. When you finally manage to get rid of him,
and lean against the door in relief, a faint scratching
comes from the other side. It's our boy again, and he
has forgotten his pencil. This ploy is always good for
another half hour. And further, you can't insult the
guy; he just doesn't know when he's being insulted.
The only hope is to get yourself a single room.
In Tibet, perhaps.
