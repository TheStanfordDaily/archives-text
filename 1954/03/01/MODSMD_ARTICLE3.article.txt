# Naguib Reinstated
## 
### 
President Mohammed Naguib of
Egypt was reinstated two days after
being ousted, as demonstrators
surged through the streets of Cairo
and demanded that the Revolution
ary Council restore him to the pres
idency.
Gamal Abdel Nasser, who forced
the resignation with the charge
that Naguib was power-hungry,
remained as premier, a position
formerly held by Naguib.
Nasser also was named to replace
Naguib as the head of the Revolu
tionary Council, the 12-man army
junta which has run Egypt since
King Farouk's forced abdication in
1952.
