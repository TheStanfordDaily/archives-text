Stanford's Braves closed out j
their cage season by dropping a
53-65 tilt to the Cal Blues in
Berkeley Fiiday night, then
bouncing back the next night to
rout Cal, 65-52, in the Pavilion.
The Braves and Blues divided
their four-game series this year.
In Friday's game, the Braves were
considerably oil' their usual form as
the Blues took o 24-11 first-quarter
lead. The second quarter of play
went much the same way with the
Card players unable to hit the buck
et. Cal romped to a half-time lead
of 38-19.
The Farm cagers came hack in
the last half with a determined
drive to pull the game out of tlie
fire in spite of Cal's huge lead. I
Faced by Bob Milton, the Braves
kept chopping away at the Blues' j

margin, at one time drawing up
to only a six-point deficit.
The rally proved to be too little
and too late, however, as the over
eager Braves began fouling in tht
closing minutes. The resulting free
throws pushed Cal's lead beyonc
reach.
Don Pryde netted 21 points for
Cal, while center Bob McGrath led
Stanford scoring with 12.
Saturday night, a spirited Brave
squad surprise d the confident
Blues. Ben Heirs played his best
game of the season tor Stanford.
Sharpshooting Dave Dunn, hard
driving Bill Tarr, and Heirs
worked together to put Stanford
out in front, .*{2-28, at the half.
Cal guard A 1 Winetrub kept his
team within striking distance of the
Cards until the fourth stanza, when,
aided by Paul Perko's excellent
board-work, the Braves built up a
large enough point reservoir to put
the game on ice.
High scorers for the Braves were
Heirs and Dunn with 15 each. Tarr
hooped 10 points. Jerry Raugust and
Winetrub paced Blue scoring with
17 and 10, respectively.
