# George Plan Loses
## 
### 
By a 60-31 vote, the Senate last
Friday rejected the George proposal
to limit the President's treaty-mak
ing powers. The vote was only one
less than the necessary two-thirds
majority needed for approval.
The George plan was one of sev
eral compromise versions of the
Bricker amendment, and had been
under debate since Jan. 20.
The vote was considered a major
victory for President Eisenhower,
who had opposed the plan.
