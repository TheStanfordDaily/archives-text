## Evans Highlights Rally with Triple 
### BILL WRIGHT 
In a surprisingly well-played
season opener, Stanford's var
sity baseballers smothered a
ninth-inning rally by a power
laden alumni nine to post a 2 1
victory Saturday in the Sunken
Diamond
Sophomore left fielder Bob Evans
highlighted the Cards' two - run
eighth, smacking a long triple to
right center to drive Mickey Holz
man home with the winning tally.
Warren Goodrich started the In
dians rolling in the eighth with a
line smash to center, his second hit
of the game. Goodrich stole second
and third and raced across the plate
when alumni catcher Frank Mc-
Graw, '47, threw past third.
Ilolzmnn kept the rally going by
walking, stealing second, and ad
vancing (o third on Al Talboy's
sacrifice fly. Then Evans got his
payoff triple.
The alums fought hack in the
ninth against Mike Acker, Stan
ford's third and winning pitcher,
with a lead - off' double by John
Schaefer, '49, and a walk to Jack
Shepard, captain of the 1953 PCC
champions.
But Acker got out of the inning.
Dave Stott, '50, running for Schae
fer, was nailed trying to go to third
as Shepard moved to second. Ray
Swartz, '53, now property of the
Hollywood Stars, popped to catcher
Clarke Nelson.
Then Shepard, who reports to
Pittsburgh today, overran third on
an attempted steal and was tagged
by Holzman.
Bob Murphy, Stanford's top
pitcher last year, shut out the
varsity for five innings before re
tiring in favor of Dave Dahle, '49.
Dahle kept the Indians in hand
until the eighth-inning flurry.
Sophomore Ray Young worked
the first four innings on the mound
for Everett Dean's varsity, permit
ting only a single and two walks.
Phil Page southpawed the next
three frames and allowed the lone
alumni run in the seventh.
Shepard walked, went to second
on an error, and came home on a
single to center by McGraw.


THE FINAL OUT—lack Shepard, the Stanford baseball captain
of last year who reports to the Pittsburgh Pirates today, beats
Card catcher Clarke Nelson's throw to third, but he overruns the
bag and is tagged out by Mickey Holzman for the last out of the
game. The varsity downed the Alumni, 2-1, Saturday on the
Sunken Diamond. —Daily photo by John Leutscher
