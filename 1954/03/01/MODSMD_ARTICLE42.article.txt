# Rugby Team Rips Olympic Club, 18-3
## 
### FRANK CANCINO 
The Stanford varsity rugby team
remained undefeated Saturday with
an 18-3 win over the San Francisco
Olympic Club.
The outcome was never in doubt
as the Cards gained the lead on an
Ernie Dorn scoring burst and a
Dorsey Atkinson conversion early in
the first half. Sam Morley waltzed
to another score and Atkinson again
converted before the half ended.
In the second stanza Ron Bush
added another three-pointer on a
ripping, teaming run for a try.
A beautiful 60-yard run by Ron
Cook and a subsequent conversion
by Atkinson concluded the scoring
for the game.
The speed of Dorn and Cook
and the aggressiveness of Bush
and Scott Jones, backed by Mor
ley, Juan Reynaud, and Atkinson,
gave the Indians a very effective
backfield.
Tomorrow afternoon the ruggers
will meet COP behind the Sunken
Diamond at 4.
