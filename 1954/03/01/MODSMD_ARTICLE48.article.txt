# Spring to Extend Early Visit
## 
### 
Balmy spring weather looks like
it's here to stay at Stanford—at least
for the next few days, according to
weathermen.
The scientific reason for this pre- j
mature hot weather is a high pres
sure area extending over the entire |
West Coast.
But students don't seem to he
too much concerned about the i
scientific reason. They're too husy
soaking up the sunshine, plan- j
ning beach parties, and getting
spring clothes out of the closet.
Last weekend many Stanfordites
headed for the wide-open spaces to
picnic, swim, sunbathe, and study.
Stay -at - homes utilized sun
porches and lawns as likely places
to cultivate sun-tans, and volley
ball games were organized up and
down the Row.
Spring fever was showing its ef
fects on study habits, and will prob
ably continue to plague students for
the remainder of the quarter.
The evidence is that spring is
here to stay.


STUDY-TIME—WARM-WEATHER STYLE — Even with the
weather hitting the high 70s, study is a necessity at Stanford.
