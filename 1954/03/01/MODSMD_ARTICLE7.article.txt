# Cousins Asks For 'Honorable Peace'
## 
### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
"What we want is an honorable
peace; not a mere anaesthesia of
spirit, but a world situation in
which growth is possible and prog
ress inevitable, a peace in which we
give the next generation a better
chance."
In a speech yesterday afternoon
before 600 people, Norman Cous
ins, editor of the Saturday Review
of Literature and president of the
United World Federalists' organiza
tion, outlined what he believes the
greatest problem facing us todayâ€”
the attainment of peaceful world
government.
Consins began by stating that
the much - heralded Industrial
Revolution in reality "dissolved
government . . . put knowledge
ahead of conscience. It has made
us all members of the same com
munity."
In our present state of world af
fairs, Cousins went on, as we arc
faced by great difficulties, we can
resolve them in one of two ways.
We have our choice between "the
neighborhood and the battlefield,"
and must make this choice soon,
since the world cannot long exist in
the present state of anarchy. "The
inevitable outcome ... is world
government," and whether this gov
ernment will come before the next
total war or after it depends upon
the progress of Communism in Asia.
Our present' condition of anarchy
is furthered by Communism as the
necessary medium for its growth.
The chaos in Asia is promoted by
their agents, but, Cousins said, the
Red leaders "cannot afford total
war, and since their government al
ways requires an outside threat to
maintain its stability, they are afraid
of total peace."
The situation today offers to
American foreign policy a "mag
nificent challenge," but in the past
our actions have been character
ized by a lack of any real design,"
he alleged.
As a nation used to forceful solu
tions, Cousins said, we must become
accustomed to the inadequacy of
militarism; we must "develop a mi
raculous tenderness for the wants of
others. Our problem is, now, "Who
will speak for the majority?"
