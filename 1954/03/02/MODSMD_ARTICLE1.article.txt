# PUERTO RICANS SHOOT 5 CONGRESSMEN
## Gunfire Sprays House; Bentley Seriously Hurt 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 1 (UP) —Four Puerto Rican fanatics, led
by a flag-waving woman, fired a fusillade of bullets into the House
ot Representatives chambers today wounding five Congressmen,
one critically.
Police said the assailants plotted the shooting as a fantastic
kill-and-be-killed demonstration for their country's independence.
Near-panic gripped the 200-odd Congressmen who had
crowded into the highdomed chamber for an important vote.
Some stood too stunned to move as the Puerto Ricans poured
a dozen to 30 shots into the group from a visitor's gallery. Others
threw themselves to the floor. Some crawled for cover on hands
and knees.
A bullet tore into Rep. Alvin M. Bentley, (R., Mich.), puncturing

his lung, liver, and stomach. He un
derwent an emergency operation at
Casualty Hospital about five hours
later and was given only a "50-50
chance" to survive.
Less seriously wounded were:
Rep. Ben F. Jensen (R., la.), shot
in the back and taken to Bethesda
(Md.) Naval Medical Center. The
hospital said his condition was
"good."
Rep. Clifford Davis (D., Tenn.),
wounded in the right leg and also
taken to the Medical Center. His
condition also was "good."
Rep. Kenneth A. Roberts (D.,
Ala.), wounded in the left thigh and
knee. Surgeons ordered an explora
tory operation on his leg, fearing
serious injuries to his "nerves and
blood vessels."
Rep. George 11. Fallon (I)., Md.),
shot in the hip and removed to Cas
ualty Hospital. His condition was
satisfactory.
Rep. James E. Van Zandt (R.,
Pa.), Wingate Lucas (D., Tex.), and
Joe Holtz (R., Calif.) and a hand
ful of spectators and House employ
ees overpowered the gunmen.
Police called them members of the
"same gang" that tried to kill former
President Truman in 1950.
Police Chief Robert Murray said
the four Puerto Ricans would be.
hooked for assault with intent to
kill. lie identified them as:
Mrs. Lolita Leßron, 34, of New
York City, the "leader" of the group
and a friend of the wife of one of
the two men who tried to kill Mr.
Truman.
Rafael Cancel Miranda, 25, of New
York City.
Andres Figueroa Cordero, 29, of
New York City.
Irving Fores, 27, of New York
City.
In the wild melee on the House
floor, doorkeeper William R. Belcher
suffered a heart attack and was
rushed to George Washington Hos
pital.
The shooting was the first ever to
occur during a Congressional ses
sion, although the lawmakers got a
scare-in 1932 when a Congressman
disarmed a mental case.
New security measures were
put into effect at both the Senate
and the House. Both planned to
meet on schedule tomorrow, but
greater caution will be used in
issuing passes to the galleries.
The four Puerto Ricans slipped
into the House gallery unnoticed to
day and sat down quietly.
Mrs. Leßron gave the signal for
the onslaught. She waved a Puerto
Rican flag and shouted: "Free Puer
to Rico!"
She and two of her confederates
immediately started shooting. The
girl held her pistol in both hands,
aiming it machine-gun style, and
emptied the gun at the startled Con
gressmen. The fourth man appar
ently was assigned to reload the
guns.
Police Chief Murray said the four
were firing at random and did not
aim to kill any specific person.
Murray also said the plotters had
no interest in the bill under con
sideration at the time of the shoot
ing—legislation to permit importa
tion of Mexican farm laborers.
