### 
WASHINGTON, March 1 (UP) â€”Former Gov, Earl Warren of
California was confirmed as Chief Justice of the United States
today with a minimum of Senate debate and no audible opposi
tion.

The voice vote ended a weeks-long delay during which chair-

man William Langer (R., N.D.) of"
the Senate Judiciary Committee re
-1 eased "unevaluated" charges
against Mr. Warren.
There was no delay today. Sena
tor William F. Knowland (R., Cal
if.) and Thomas Kuchel (R., Calif.)
made brief speeches priasing War
ren.
Then, with about half of the 96
members present, the Senate con
firmed Warren by a voice vote.
There were no audible "noes."
Warren has been serving under
a recess appointment since last
October when President Eisen
hower named him to succeed the
late Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson.
Eisenhower sent the formal nomi
nation to the Senate early in Jan
uary.
The nomination was tied up for
weeks in a Senate Judiciary sub
committee, which Langer also heads.
Langer aroused a nationwide fu
ror when he made public 10 "un
evaluated" charges, ranging from an
accusation that Warren was con
trolled by a liquor lobbyist to a
charge that lie followed "the Marx
ist line."
The subcommittee quickly ap
proved the nomination after the
Justice Department disclosed that
some of the charges were leveled
by a fugitive from California jus
tice and Eisenhower, Vice-Prcsi
dent Richard M. Nixon, and other
leading citizens cainc to Warren's
defense.
As recently as Sunday, Langer
said the Senate should get a full
FBI report on Warren before con
firming his nomination.
Republicans abandoned plans' (or
a roll call after some expressed fear
it might provoke opposition.
