## A
						Victory for the People 
### 
A few seconds and one late vote made his
tory in the Senate Friday as the George pro
posal, a watered-down version of the Bricker
amendment, was defeated.
The roll call vote stood at 60 to 30, which
meant passage by the necessary two-thirds
majority, when Senator Harley M. Kilgore
(D., W.Va.) rushed into the chamber and cast
the deciding negative vote.
The result was a resounding victory for Presi
dent Eisenhower, the upholding of the treaty
making powers in the Constitution, and the as
surance that American foreign policy won't be
shackled by partisan Congressional debates.
Senator George's substitute for the Brickei
plan would have provided that international
agreements other than treaties could become
domestic law only by an act of Congress. This
was less stringent than the Bricker amendment,
which advocated Congressional approval for
aIJ executive agreements with foreign nations.

However, it is obvious that under either plan
foreign policy would be robbed of two essen
tial ingredients—force and consistency.
President Eisenhower has justly refused to

compromise his responsibility or his right to
deal with other countries. He is to be com
mended for his firm stand against the conserva
tive elements in both parties, even though his
chief lieutenant, Senate Majority Leader Wil
liam Knowland, voted in favor of the George
plan.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair
man Alexander Wiley (R., Wis.) has termed the
outcome "a great partisan victory for the ad
ministration and for the President."
We would add that this is also a great victory
for the American people. They can breathe a
bit easier, knowing that decisions vital to their
security and the security of the world will be
made by those in a position to view the whole
—not in the Congress where decisions are a
matter of piecemeal political give and take.
