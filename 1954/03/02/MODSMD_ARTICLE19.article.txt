# PRIVATE LIFE

### LARRY CAHN 
My reflections of basic training are numerous.
Some of them are:
Our drill sergeants, who have it harder than any
of us. For not only must they keep the long hours
and do relatively the same things that their men do,
but they have no end of basic. Thev take one cvcle

through and then repeat the en
tire training wiih another group,
it just goes on and on for them.
The barracks, and how warm
and good they looked after
coining back from five days of
bivouac. The feeling that they
really were "home."
The food, and how its qxiality
varied with the* whims of the
cooks and their desire to do a
good job.

The cats and dogs, which gathered about the mess
halls to get scraps and nibble at garbage.
Missing equipment, and towards the final days
of basic how one must keep an extra special guard
on his own equipment to prevent it being checked in
by others who may be missing an item or two.
Bull sessions, and how they go on and on, and
really never get anywhere hut just return to girls
after taking a whirl at "back home" literature, the
finer arts, food and moans against the Army.
The war stories, which our leaders pass on to try
and keep us a bit more mentally alert for our lessons.
Language, which is often so crude and obscene
that all worry about what will happen when they
get back home.
The expression "real life," which was synonymous
with civilian life.
Our final day of rifle cleaning, when the men spent
from five to 14 hours cleaning their rifles before

being able to check them in and have their names
cleared.
The bayonet and hand-to-hand practice, where
some men took it with such vim that one might think
they were prepping lor civilian life.
The infiltration course, where you crawl and
crawl for an entire afternoon and evening and al
ways the whine of live ammunition being fired over
your head reminds you just to keep crawling.
Hand grenades, where one slip would be your last.
The gas chamber, where everyone breaks down
to the power of tear gas and cries and cries, all the
time singing an appropriate song, "Cry" or "Crying
in the Chapel."
Seeing the movie, "Take the High Ground," and
appreciating the authenticity of what they showed
but marvelling at the material that was left out, the
stuff that makes basic the tough, miserable thing that
it is.
Marching home after a hard day, watching the
sun set and being grateful that another day is done.
Firing machine guns from a prone position,
while the rain never lets up and feeling your pon
cho and hoots fill with water and its squish and
squeeze about your body with every little motion.
The division parade, where 25,000 men marched.
The playing of the Star Spangled Banner each
evening, and inside of you a feeling of pride.
The letter of congratulations after your training
period, reminding you that you are a member of the
Great American Team.
And deep inside of you the feeling that it wasn't
too bad, now that and the thought that you
really* have done something.
But then you wonder what practical value it will
ever haveâ€”unless being a killer is of value.
