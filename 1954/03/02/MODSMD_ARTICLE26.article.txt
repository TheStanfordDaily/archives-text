# Coro Foundation Trains Grads For Careers in Public Service
## 
### PAT KING 
To insure more intelligent handling of public affairs. That is the
goal of the Coro Foundation, a non-profit organization in San Fran
cisco which trains college graduates for careers in public life.
Each year 12 men and women are selected as interns for a nine
months' training program which runs from October through June.

Appointments are on a full-time,
professional basis, and $500 tuition
is charged.
The foundation grants each intern
a subsistence scholarship of $1,000,
plus $125 for one dependent or $350
for two or more dependents. Tuition
loans and scholarships are also
available.
The training program is divided
into three eight-week periods, plus
an additional five weeks for a spe
cial project. The interns spend four
mornings a week with u govern
ment agency, and on Friday they
meet together to give reports on
their various jobs.
In the afternoons assignments
are divided into three areas: poli
tics, business, and labor. Special
concentration on one of these
fields is given during each of (he
eight-week periods.
