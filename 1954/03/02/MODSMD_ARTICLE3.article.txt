# DR. GRAHAM STUART
## Shots Due to ‘Insanity' 
### BOB REZAK 
Dr. Graham H. Stuart, renowned
authority on Latin America and
American diplomatic affairs, said,
here yesterday that "it must have
been insanity" that prompted four
Puerto Rican fanatics to open gun
fire on members of the House of
Representatives.
The professor emeritus of political
science, who ended a 39-year teach
ing career here in 1952, said the news
came to him as a "complete sur
prise" when informed of the inci
dent by The Daily.
The United States, Dr. Stuart
observed, has given Puerto Rico
"everything it wants ... it simply
cannot afford independence."
He said Puerio Rico Governor
Luis Munoz Marin, whom he de
scribed as "an outstanding and able
fellow," himself opposes independ -
encc for the island of more than two
million persons.
Although the island is still a pos
session of the U.S., Dr. Stuart said
it is analagous to dominion status
under the British Commonwealth—
almost complete independence.
"I'll bet Puerto Rico will regret
this very much," the retired pro
fessor added.
He declared the shooting appar
ently was the work of "cranks."
