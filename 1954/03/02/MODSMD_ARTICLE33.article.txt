the Sunken Diamond.

ing Fort Ord Friday and San ]ose State Saturday.

Well satisfied with his team's
hard-fought season-opening victory
over a stubborn alumni squad,
Coach Everett Dean plans only one
change in the starting liner*p. Bob
Evans, who propelled the Indians to
victory Saturday with a booming
triple, will replace Gordon Gailo

way in left field and will hit in the
filth spot. A 1 Talboy, right fielder,
moves down a notch and will bat
sixth.

ball against the alums, is slated to
hurl as are Ken Brown and Dave
Freeman. Both Brown and Freeman
saw mound duty with the Braves
last Thursday when they humbled
San Mateo JC.

forecast that the '54 Cards would
rely on speed and be a running
team. With Warren Goodrich and
