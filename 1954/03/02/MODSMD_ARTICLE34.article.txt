# Ted Williams Breaks Shoulder
## 
### 
SARASOTA, Fla., March 1 (UP)
Ted Williams, who escaped un
scathed from two plane crashes in
Korea, broke his collar bone today
after 15 minutes of his first spring
training workout and gloomily re
signed himself to being out of the
Red Sox lineup for about six weeks.
The Boston slugging star, base
ball's highest-paid player, stumbled
in the outfield grass while chasing a
low line drive from the bat of Hoot
Evers and fell hard on his left
shoulder. He felt something snap,
Williams related later, then regained
his feet and hobbled to the club
house, where doctors immediately
diagnosed the fractured collar bone.
"I seem to have problems every
year," moaned Williams, who batted
.407 in 37 games at the end of last
season in a brilliant baseball come
back after flying 35) missions in Ko
rea as a Marine fighter pilot.
