## 
### 
Congressman J. Arthur Younger
wired the Palo Alto Times yester
day that a Stanford property site
west of the Eastman Kodak, plant on
Page Mill Road is highly favored as
the location for the Veterans Ad
ministration's 1,000-bed, $23 million
psychiatric hospital.
Younger stated that the VA site
selection committee has listed the
available sites in order of preference
for the Budget Bureau, and that the
location on Stanford property heads
the list. Younger did not disclose
his sources for the statement.
Stanford officials said yesterday
that they had received no official
word since VA officials visited the
campus Jan. 2C> to survey possible
sites. Harvey V. Higley, veterans'
administrator, and Admiral Joel T.
Boone, medical director of the VA,
toured several sites with Stanford
officials at that time.
If the Stanford site is selected, a
"friendly condemnation suit" by the
government is expected, since the
government ordinarily cannot build
on property it does not own, and
the University cannot ordinarily
sell any of its property.
