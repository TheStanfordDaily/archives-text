## An Opportunity From Excom 
### 
At last week's meeting of the Executive Com
mittee, the group spent considerable time dis
cussing an apparent lack of interest by students
in their government. As the discussion wound
up, Excom decided that '.heir representation is
not satisfactory and cannot be satisfactory u.itil
an effective line of communication between the
representatives and the students is established.
As a result, Excom decided to hold their
weekly session at Toyon tonight in the hope
that students would attend the meeting both to
see how Excom operates and to express them
selves on the*myriad of issues which the group
must face every week.
112 Excom voted to discuss the campus traffic
situation tonight—a problem which involves at
least every student who owns a car. Stanford
Police Chief Gordon Davis accepted the group's
invitation to attend the meeting and participate
in the discussion which was tentatively set to
include consideration of the chaining-off of the
area around Engineering Corner, the 25-mile

per-hour speed limit on Palm Drive, and the
daily congestion around the Post Office during
the noon hour.
Many students have a definite interest in
these specific problems. Whether they will
take time tonight to make their opinions known
is another thing.
The members of Excom are obviously sin
cere in hoping that students will take advantage
of this opportunity to express themselves.
They believe, as does The Daily, that there is a
definite student interest in Excom activities and
that the best way to express that interest is
through participation in Excom meetings.
Action from here on is dependent on student
reaction. If tonight's meeting is well-attended
and constructive comments are voiced, it seems
very likely that further meetings will be sched
uled for other campus living groups.
The opportunity is there. Is it worth two
hours of your time tonight to attend the meet
ing and make your opinions felt? We think it is.
