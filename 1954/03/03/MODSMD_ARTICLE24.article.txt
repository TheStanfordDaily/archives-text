One bill introduced onto the floor of the Sen
ate this week—Hawaii statehood—is not ex
actly new business. This marks the nineteenth
time since 1920 that the lav/makers have faced
the question of statehood for our island terri
tory. This time the House has approved the
measure, but serious opposition is forthcoming
from Senate Democrats who don't want the bal
ance of power tipped by Hawaii's Republican
vote.
When this latest bill became pending busi
ness at the conclusion of the Biicker debate,
Senator Clinton Anderson (D., N.M.) immedi
ately tacked on statehood for Alaska, which
traditionally votes Democratic.
Southern Democrats strongly oppose the
admission of Hawaii without Alaska because
of the civil rights issue; they fear that Hawai
ians, with 38 per cent of their population of
Chinese and Japanese origin, would support
national legislation ending segregation and
racial preference.
Whatever reasons forwarded by the sena
tors against Hawaii, we don't think they can
begin to balance the facts favoring admission.

Since 1900 Hawaii has been actively seeking
statehood. A territorial government similar to
those established in continental territories later
admitted to statehood was formed. In 1937 a
Congressional committee reported that Hawaii
•had filled every requirement necessary for
statehood, but they suggested postponement
until after the international scene had settled.
In 1940 a plebiscite was taken which found the
voters 2 to "1 in favor of statehood.
lln 1947 another survey was conducted with
interesting results. Eighty-five percent of the
Hawaiian voting population had gone to the
polls in the previous election, far mofe than
ever achieved in the United States. Revenue
collections exceeded that of 12 states at the
time they were admitted.
That was seven years ago. Still nothing has
happened. We would urge senators now in
Congress to study all the facts carefully, re
membering their campaign, promises of last
November. We urge them not to block Hawaii
with Alaska, which is an entirely separate
issue.
It is time we added thai 49th star to the flag.
