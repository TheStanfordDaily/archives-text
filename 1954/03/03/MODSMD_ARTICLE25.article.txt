### PETE GROTHE 
MIKE HAMMER ON THE FARM

(Note: Everybody and his brother Tsakalakis lias
done a take-off on Mickey Spillane, so this corner
might as well take a crack at it, too. Arid so, a .little
Dragnet music in the background, professor, please,
as we bring you "Mike Hammer on the Farm.")
It was a rough thing I had to do.
It was cold and drizzling as I stepped out of the
bus at the Palo Alto bus station.

1 pulled the collar of my coat
over my neck and put down the
brim of my hat. All the time
thinking about the rough thing I
had to do.
I hailed a cab, and a sloppy
looking driver with a big bald
head and a whining voice opened
the door for me. We rattled off
down Palm Drive, and a hot lump

of hate welled up in me as I
thought about the rough thing I had to do.
Someone was going to get two hot slugs of lead
in the guts. 1 didn't know who that someone was.
All I knew was that that someone got my best friend
Willie a week ago at Stanford. I also knew that the
stupid, lazy cops would never get the killer. It was
up to me.
Willie and ] graduated in '49. We both majored in
ROTC, and Willie was getting hi: doctorate in ROTC
when someone got him. I don't know why. Willie was
the sweetest guy you'd want to know. I remember
when we were both on Rally Com. he'd always let
me wear his pair of white saddle shoes because he
knew I couldn't afford a pair. That was Willie. And
when I got his killer, it would be easy. No senti
ment. Just two burning slugs of lead.
The cahhie let me off at history corner and
whined, "That'll Ik- $1.50."
"What did you say. y»m punk?" I shot hack.
That high, whining voice of his repeated that the
tariff was $1.50.
So much hate seethed in me that I felt ! was going
to explode. Imagine $1.50 for a half-mile. 1 took out
my .45 and gave it to him once. In the right place.

He twisted to the ground whining. And then he
was quiet.
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a whiner..
I walked up from history corner towards the Cel
lar. I thought about all the good times I had had at
Stanford. About the times'when I had coffee dates at
the Cellar. About the time when I slugged a poly sci
reader for flunking me. About the times I lay out
on the cool green grass in spring quarter and watched
the broads go by. About the time when my frat club
got booted off campus because I forgot about the
seven mile limit.
But I was getting sentimental. And that was wrong.
Dead wrong. Because I'm tough, and there's no
room for sentiment in a tough guy who's out to kill
someone.
As I reached the side alley next to the Cellar I
saw a cop ( get off a motorcycle and give a ticket to
someone. Then I saw that someone.
The sight of her hit me hard. She was what you
would expect in a painting if each of the world's
greatest artists added his own special technique
to produce a masterpiece. She had long, flowing
blond hair, and her curves reminded me of the road
to Rosotti's. She was gorgeous enough to drop any
man at . r >o paces.
A cold knot of fear hit me in the stomach. If
there's one thing that gives me the shivers, it's a
flatfnot giving a parking liekcl to a gorgeous
broad. The solution was easy. I took out my .45 and
gave it to him twice.
Chief Gordy would have to find a new cop. For all
I knew, he might have been the one that got Willie.
Probably not, though. But, at any rate, it was good
practice.
"The name's Hammer, m'am. Mike Hammer. And
I m here to take care of the guy that got my best
friend, Willie."
"My name's Vilma—Vilma Dance, and I think I
can help you. I know something."
The plot was thickening. And that's the way I likf*
it.

The cahhie let me off at history corner and
whined, "That'll Ik- $1.50."
"What did you say. y»m punk?" I shot hack.
That high, whining voice of his repeated that the
tariff was $1.50.
So much hate seethed in me that I felt ! was going
to explode. Imagine $1.50 for a half-mile. 1 took out
my .45 and gave it to him once. In the right place.

He twisted to the ground whining. And then he
was quiet.
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a whiner..
I walked up from history corner towards the Cel
lar. I thought about all the good times I had had at
Stanford. About the times'when I had coffee dates at
the Cellar. About the time when I slugged a poly sci
reader for flunking me. About the times I lay out
on the cool green grass in spring quarter and watched
the broads go by. About the time when my frat club
got booted off campus because I forgot about the
seven mile limit.
But I was getting sentimental. And that was wrong.
Dead wrong. Because I'm tough, and there's no
room for sentiment in a tough guy who's out to kill
someone.
As I reached the side alley next to the Cellar I
saw a cop ( get off a motorcycle and give a ticket to
someone. Then I saw that someone.
The sight of her hit me hard. She was what you
would expect in a painting if each of the world's
greatest artists added his own special technique
to produce a masterpiece. She had long, flowing
blond hair, and her curves reminded me of the road
to Rosotti's. She was gorgeous enough to drop any
man at . r >o paces.
A cold knot of fear hit me in the stomach. If
there's one thing that gives me the shivers, it's a
flatfnot giving a parking liekcl to a gorgeous
broad. The solution was easy. I took out my .45 and
gave it to him twice.
Chief Gordy would have to find a new cop. For all
I knew, he might have been the one that got Willie.
Probably not, though. But, at any rate, it was good
practice.
"The name's Hammer, m'am. Mike Hammer. And
I m here to take care of the guy that got my best
friend, Willie."
"My name's Vilma—Vilma Dance, and I think I
can help you. I know something."
The plot was thickening. And that's the way I likf*
it.

MIKE HAMMER ON THE FARM

(Note: Everybody and his brother Tsakalakis lias
done a take-off on Mickey Spillane, so this corner
might as well take a crack at it, too. Arid so, a .little
Dragnet music in the background, professor, please,
as we bring you "Mike Hammer on the Farm.")
It was a rough thing I had to do.
It was cold and drizzling as I stepped out of the
bus at the Palo Alto bus station.

1 pulled the collar of my coat
over my neck and put down the
brim of my hat. All the time
thinking about the rough thing I
had to do.
I hailed a cab, and a sloppy
looking driver with a big bald
head and a whining voice opened
the door for me. We rattled off
down Palm Drive, and a hot lump

of hate welled up in me as I
thought about the rough thing I had to do.
Someone was going to get two hot slugs of lead
in the guts. 1 didn't know who that someone was.
All I knew was that that someone got my best friend
Willie a week ago at Stanford. I also knew that the
stupid, lazy cops would never get the killer. It was
up to me.
Willie and ] graduated in '49. We both majored in
ROTC, and Willie was getting hi: doctorate in ROTC
when someone got him. I don't know why. Willie was
the sweetest guy you'd want to know. I remember
when we were both on Rally Com. he'd always let
me wear his pair of white saddle shoes because he
knew I couldn't afford a pair. That was Willie. And
when I got his killer, it would be easy. No senti
ment. Just two burning slugs of lead.
The cahhie let me off at history corner and
whined, "That'll Ik- $1.50."
