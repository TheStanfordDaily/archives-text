## On Honesty 'Experiments' 
### 
To the Editor:
To boi;in with, the statement: the moral tone of the
student body of Stanford University has slackened
sin«e my freshman year, would probably bring on
conscious and unconscious attacks of early morning
cynicism with which letters of this sort are usually
faced. However, here are the facts:
I seem to have inadvertently run a series of ex
periments upon the honesty of the Stanford popula
tion with almost valid geographical factors that a
former letter on the subject lacked. During the past
two weeks, a suede jacket was removed from the
racks at Cubbcrley, a French dictionary was taken
from the racks at the Cellar, an organic text left the
racks at the Main Library, and a sport coat disap-

peared somewhere in Iho vicinity of Memorial Audi
torium. I have to admit, at this point my scientific
objectivity gave way to a selfish lecherousness and
I stopped leaving my property unchained to my per
son.
I feel these losses in two ways: of course the finan
cial one, which amounts to over $100; the second way
is rather difficult to express except by saying that the
untrusting attitude I had toward people which was
lost at Stanford during my stay here, has returned.
I realize the hopelessness of social reform, so let
this letter serve as a warning not 1o the thieves, but
to the trusting. I can only hope that I am all wrong.
