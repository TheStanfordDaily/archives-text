# Critic Praises 'High Quality' Of Symphony
## 
### BARNEY CHILDS 
The Stanford Symphony com
bined with the University Cho
rus last night in a concert serv
ing as the last of this quarter's
Tuesday Evening Series; al
though the house was not full,
the audience heard performan-;
ces of consistently high quality
of a program of works worth
hearing.
Hindemith's symphony from his j
opera "Mathis der Maler" is about, j
20 years old liow, and it has become
in this time one of the "great" work.s
of this century. I don't know how a
composition becomes a masterpiece,
but "Mathis" is well on the way. It
is correspondingly a difficult work j
to perform, even for an orchestra of
professionals; the fact that the Uni
versity orchestra could realize the
performance they did in eight weeks
is a tribute to the orchestra and
Sandor Salgo, its conductor, beyond
any superlatives the critic may pro
duce.
Hindemith's orchestration, in all
ils complexity and cxpansiveness,
demands a higher individual
standard of performance than a
work for a lesser group; let one
performer fluff badly, even in the
second violins, and the effect of
the work is changed. For this rea
| son an ideal performance is prob
ably impossible because of the
very limitations of human beings;
yet there were places in last
j night's reading that came as close
to this ideal as anything I have
ever heard.
Such successes are not brought
about by a conductor leading an or
chestra, but by a conductor and
musicians working, perhaps even
thinking, in the sort of unity that
some people like to think of as in
spiration. The entry of the "drei
Engel" in the first movement, the
last three bars of the second move
ment. and the "Lauda Sion Salvato
rum" chorale in the last movement
(were for me as good as possible.
The difficult solo passages all came
off, the strings have never sounded
so cohesive and, in places, shining,
and the whole musical "arc," from
beginning to end of the work, made
ol the music all that was in it.
Weber's "Kuryanthe" overture,
although a war-horse, is not read>
for Ihe knacker's yet; despite
opening-number goofs, this time
in attack and occasionally in the
lower horns, Ihe overture fulfilled
its function well indeed.
OUrd symphony (D ma
jor) is Ila.vdn -it his most attrac
tive. It was set forth with sympathy
and good humor throughout, and
the ori'he: tra kept texture:- clean
i and spacious, although they had iust
j finished playing the vastly more in
volved Ilindcmith woik.
The chorus joined the orchestra
foi Verdi's "Tc Deum," rarely
enough heard to provide interest
(KZSU will rc broad cast last
night's concert next Tuesday at 7:l»C
I p.m.)

Hindemith's symphony from his j
opera "Mathis der Maler" is about, j
20 years old liow, and it has become
in this time one of the "great" work.s
of this century. I don't know how a
composition becomes a masterpiece,
but "Mathis" is well on the way. It
is correspondingly a difficult work j
to perform, even for an orchestra of
professionals; the fact that the Uni
versity orchestra could realize the
performance they did in eight weeks
is a tribute to the orchestra and
Sandor Salgo, its conductor, beyond
any superlatives the critic may pro
duce.
Hindemith's orchestration, in all
ils complexity and cxpansiveness,
demands a higher individual
standard of performance than a
work for a lesser group; let one
performer fluff badly, even in the
second violins, and the effect of
the work is changed. For this rea
| son an ideal performance is prob
ably impossible because of the
very limitations of human beings;
yet there were places in last
j night's reading that came as close
to this ideal as anything I have
ever heard.
Such successes are not brought
about by a conductor leading an or
chestra, but by a conductor and
musicians working, perhaps even
thinking, in the sort of unity that
some people like to think of as in
spiration. The entry of the "drei
Engel" in the first movement, the
last three bars of the second move
ment. and the "Lauda Sion Salvato
rum" chorale in the last movement
(were for me as good as possible.
The difficult solo passages all came
off, the strings have never sounded
so cohesive and, in places, shining,
and the whole musical "arc," from
beginning to end of the work, made
ol the music all that was in it.
Weber's "Kuryanthe" overture,
although a war-horse, is not read>
for Ihe knacker's yet; despite
opening-number goofs, this time
in attack and occasionally in the
lower horns, Ihe overture fulfilled
its function well indeed.
