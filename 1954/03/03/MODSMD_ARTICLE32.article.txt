# BOWMAN ADDITION
## 
### 
An addition to the Bowman
Alumni House is the projected use
for a $5,000 gift of Roscoe W. Ma
ples, Class of '04.
The addition to the existing struc
ture, for which the gift was ear
marked, would be a board room for
the alumni trustees which could also
be used as a meeting place for
groups too small for the main
lounge. Storage and lavatory space
would also be included.
