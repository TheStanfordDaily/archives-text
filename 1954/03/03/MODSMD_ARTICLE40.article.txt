# Braves Rap Menlo, 11-0
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
The Braves baseballers shut out j
Menlo Junior College, 11-0, yester
day on the losers' field. Stanford
out-hit Menlo 11 to 3.
The Indians loaded the bases with
only one out in the first inning but
got only one run before George Sel
leck struck out to end the inning.
The Braves, playing with a catch
er and two pitchers in the outfield,
sewed up the game in the fifth with
four more runs on three hits, one
a line-drive double by Rocky Furst.
Stanford pitching was superb as
Ray Higbsmith, Jack llcffelfinger,
and Ralph Cassady gave up only
three hits while striking out 12 i
and walking one.
The closest that Menlo came to
scoring was in the fifth. • With two
outs, Heffelfinger gave up a triple to
left-center, but he bore down to fan
the next batter. Highsmith struck
out the side in both the first and the
third.
Rocky Furst, Ron Witort, and Bob
Fisher divided hitting honors, each
collecting two bingles. Fisher and
Frank Tenerello each scored three
times, and Witort drove across four
runs on two singles and a walk.
Heffelfinger got credit for the win.
