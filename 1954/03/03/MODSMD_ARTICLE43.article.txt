# 'Johnny': Billboard to Cellar
## 
### 
"Johnny" of Philip Morris, the
little man with the big voice and
the infectious smile, made a brief
appearance at the Cellar during the
noon hour yesterday as part of a
personal appearance tour aimed at
publicizing the movie "The Long,
Long Trailer," co-starring Lucille
Ball and Desi Arnaz.
The long, long trailer, which was
supposed to accompany Johnny, did
not arrive. It was accidentally hit
by a car while parked on a corner
in San Jose and required repairs
before it could continue its trip.
Familiar to the millions of radio
listeners and TV viewers who hear
him "Call for Philip Morris" every
week on Philip Morris radio and
television shows, Johnny, who is
only 4 feet lVa inches tall, appeared
resplendent in the red and black
bell-boy suit that he wears in Phil
ip Morris advertisements and will
ingly gave the call for which he has
become so well known.
From Stanford he continued on to
San Francisco for his next stopover,
and from there he will proceed
through Northern California, Ore
gon, Washington, and other Western
and Midwestern states on a person
al-appearance tour that is expected
to last about nine months.


CIGARETTE, ANYONE?—"Johnny," well-known to listeners of
the Philip Morris show, gave out sample cigarette cartons yes
terday at the Cellar to students who came to see him during his
personal visit to Stanford.
