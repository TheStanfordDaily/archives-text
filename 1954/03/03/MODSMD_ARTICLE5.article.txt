Boyd will give the history of find
ing how to "design" fuels for auto
motive and aircraft, engines. He will
explain that in the early days of the
internal combustion engine few en
gineers "recognized it is just as im
portant to design the fuel right as
the crankshaft."
Boyd collaborated with Charles F.
Kettering and the late Thomas
Miclgeley, Jr.. in the discovery of
tetraethyl lead as an antiknock
