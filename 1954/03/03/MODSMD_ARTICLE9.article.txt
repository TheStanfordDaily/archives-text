### 
Applications for the April 22
Selective Service College Qual
ification Test are due now. The
mailing deadline is March 8.
Application blanks and infor
mation bulletins, with sample
questions, are available at the
Veterans' Records Office on In
ner Quad.
This is the last test to be given
this school year for use in request
ing deferments.
To be eligible to apply for the test
a student must:
1. Intend to request deferment as
a student.
2. Be satisfactorily taking 15 full
time units of work at. Stanford.
3. Never have taken the test be
fore.
There are two ways for men to be
deferred if they are not in a military
program.
One is to be in the upper half of
the men in .his class if he is a fresh
man, the upper two-thirds if he is
in the sophomore class, or the upper
three-fourths if he is in the junior
J class.
The second way is to get. a grade
of 70 on the Selective Service Col
lege Qualification Test. Of the 500,-
000 students who have taken the test
so far, 63 per cent made a score of
70 or better.
The local board is not. bound by
the above criteria in making deci
sions about deferments. A local
manpower shortage may force it to
; give its own interpretation to test
! scores and class standing.
