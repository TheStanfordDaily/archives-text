## Jury indicts Terrorists On 10 Counts 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 3 (UP) j
—A fast-moving federal grand
jury indicted four Puerto Rican
terrorists today less than 48
hours after they shot down five
Congressmen in a wild hail of
bullets from a House gallery.
The 23-member jury returned in
dictments of 10 counts each against
Miss Lolita Leßron, 34, self-styled
leader of the assassins; Rafael Can
cel Miranda, 25; Andres Figueroa I
Cordero, 29; and li ving Flores Ro
driguez, 27.
It. took the jury only an hour and '
45 minutes to question six witnesses.
Some two hours later the jury
returned the indictments charging
each defendant with five counts of j
intent to kill and five counts of as
saulting a Congressman with a dan
gerous weapon.
If convicted on all 10 counts, each
could be sentenced to 125 years in
prison. Court sources said, however,
they more likely would be sen
tenced to 75 years on the intent to
kill counts or 50 years on the other
charges. •
Meanwhile Rep. Alvin M. Bentley
(R., Mich.), most seriously wounded
of the five Congressmen, was taken
off the critical list at the hospital
where he is under treatment.
At the same time, against what
was discovered to be an assassina
tion plot involving President Eisen
hower, Dulles, and Hoover, addi
tional precautions were taken.
There was no indication these plan
ned assassinations were scheduled
to have taken placc simultaneously
with the shooting in the House of
Representatives.
In Puerto Rico, the Federal Bu
reau of Investigation has alerted its
agents to the possibility of further
outbreaks of violence by fanatical
Puerto Rican Nationalists. In ad
dition to Eisenhower, Dulles, and
Hoover, there is said to be a plot to
kill Gov. Munoz Marin of Puerto
Rico, who is now in the United
States, and Antonio Fernos - Isern,
Puerto Rican commissioner to the
United States.
Dulles now is in Caracas, Vene
zuela, as head of the American dele
gation to the inter-American Con
ference. Unusual precautions have
been taken to assure his safety, in
cluding a bullet-proof automobile
for his transportation.
Advices to the United Press said
the shooting in Washington was
viewed with approval by Nationalist
headquarters in Puerto Rico. Pedro
Albizu Campos, Nationalist leader in
Puerto Rico, was reported to have
instructed his followers to resist ar
rest.

WASHINGTON, March 3 (UP) j
—A fast-moving federal grand
jury indicted four Puerto Rican
terrorists today less than 48
hours after they shot down five
Congressmen in a wild hail of
bullets from a House gallery.
The 23-member jury returned in
dictments of 10 counts each against
Miss Lolita Leßron, 34, self-styled
leader of the assassins; Rafael Can
cel Miranda, 25; Andres Figueroa I
Cordero, 29; and li ving Flores Ro
driguez, 27.
It. took the jury only an hour and '
45 minutes to question six witnesses.
Some two hours later the jury
returned the indictments charging
each defendant with five counts of j
intent to kill and five counts of as
saulting a Congressman with a dan
gerous weapon.
If convicted on all 10 counts, each
could be sentenced to 125 years in
prison. Court sources said, however,
they more likely would be sen
tenced to 75 years on the intent to
kill counts or 50 years on the other
charges. •
Meanwhile Rep. Alvin M. Bentley
(R., Mich.), most seriously wounded
of the five Congressmen, was taken
off the critical list at the hospital
where he is under treatment.
At the same time, against what
was discovered to be an assassina
tion plot involving President Eisen
hower, Dulles, and Hoover, addi
tional precautions were taken.
There was no indication these plan
ned assassinations were scheduled
to have taken placc simultaneously
with the shooting in the House of
Representatives.
