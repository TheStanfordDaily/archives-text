# Ike Attacks Unfairness In Congress Hearings
## President Demands 'Respect' For Government Witnesses 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 3 (UP) —President Eisenhower toddy
denounced "disregard of the standards of fair play" by Congres
sional investigators and demanded that administration witnesses
be "treated fairly."
While the President did not name Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, his

strongly worded formal state
ment was interpreted as a slap
at the controversial Wisconsin
Republican. McCarthy obviously
shared that view.
He promptly fired back that he
will continue to "expose" anyone—
including high Army generals —if
they are "aiding the Communist
party." He also said that only "un-
American elements" would be "glee
ful" over a fight between himself
and the President.
Eisenhower told a jam - packed
news conference—his biggest since
entering the White House—that of
ficials of his administration must re
spond "cheerfully and completely"
when summoned before Congress.
In return, he said, they must be
treated with "respect and courtesy."
The President then took special
pains to defend and praise Brig.
Gen. Ralph W. Zwicker.
Eisenhower's statement followed
an angry furore kicked up by
McCarthy's secret questioning of
Zwicker in connection with the case
of Maj. Irving Peress. Peress, an
Army dentist from New York, re
ceived an honorable discharge after
McCarthy labeled him a "Fifth
Amendment Communist."
Eisenhower acknowledged the
Army "made serioUs errors" in han
dling the Peress case. But he said
Army Secretary Robert T. Stevens
had conceded this "almost a month
ago" and before McCarthy ques
tioned Zwicker about it. He said the
problem is being corrected rapidly.
Eisenhower declared, "Our mili
tary services and their leaders have
always been completely loyal and
dedicated public servants singularly
free of suspicion of disloyalty."
Sen. McCarthy made the comment
that "This silly tempest in a teapot,
arose because we dared to bring to
light the cold unpleasant facts about
a Fifth Amendment Army Com
munist officer who was promoted,
given special immunity from duty
outside the United States, and final
ly given an honorable discharge
with the full knowledge of all con
cerned that he was a member of the
Communist party.
"It now appears that for some
reason he was a sacred cow of cer
tain Army brass."
Eisenhower and McCarthy have
had their differences in the past
but this was the first time they
have tangled so directly. Last
week the President joined "10ft
per cent" in a statement by Ste-'
vens that he would not allow
Army witnesses to be "browbeat
en" by McCarthy.
The President said today that no
body in the executive branch had
authorized any subordinate to "sub
mit to any kind of personal humili
ation when testifying before Con
gressional committees or elsewhere."
Stevens, after first ordering
Army witnesses not to appear be
fore McCarthy's subcommittee in
the Peress case, later reversed
himself and made them available
for questioning.
L The Senator said he and Eisen
hower apparently agree on the ne
• cessity of getting rid of Communists
and "we apparently disagree only
> on how we should handle those
. who protect Communists."
