## The 						Stacksâ€”Keep Them Open 
### 
At the beginning of last autumn guarter, of
ficials of the Main Library announced a new
policy of opening the book stacks to all stu
dents of the University. Previously, the privi
lege of open stacks had been enjoyed only by
graduate students and members of the faculty.
Officials wanted to give undergraduates the
same easy access to the Library's materials.
The announcement was made with one
strong guelification: that the new policy was
"tentative and experimental" and that it would
continue only so long as the students "did not
abuse their new privilege."
According to recent reports by Library of
ficials that privilege has been abused and they
are seriously considering closing the stacks to
undergraduates.
Their complaints are:
1. That books are removed from the stacks
without checking them out at the loan desk,
resulting in temporary and permanent loss.
2. That many student have been replacing
overdue books in the stacks to avoid payment

of fines:
3. That the stacks are often left in a state of
disruption, with books "tossed all over the
place" by the end of the day.
Library spokesmen have made the following
statement in regard to those complaints:
"The Library administration regards the
opening of the stacks as a temporary and ex
perimental measure. We have been disgui
eted by the numerous violations. If our sus
picions prove correct that depredations are
due to the opening of the stacks, we will be
forced to close them."
We do not know the full details of under
graduate use of the stacks, but we do know
that there is a good chance that the stacks will
again be closed to undergraduates, except by
special (and difficult to obtain) passes. If the
complaints of the Library are valid, we urge
each student to re-examine the responsibility
which is implied in the privilege of using the
stacks. The next few weeks might well be the
test by which the Library bases its decision to
close the stacks or to leave them open.
