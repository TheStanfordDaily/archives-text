# Evaluation and Education
## 
### 
In a recent article in The Atlantic Monthly,
anthropologist and novelist Oliver La Farge
points out that today's student feel "resistance
to any discussion that roams beyond the literal
confines of the subject."
His comment seems particularly timely Ihis
week, as students are busily evaluating the
courses they are completing this quarter and
pre-registering for a new program for next
quarter.
As students pore over the spring quarter
Time Schedule, comparing notes on different
professors, again and again they laud a pro
fessor: "He certainly sticks to his subject," and
"He's so well-organized," or "It's great the way
he follows the outline. You always know ex
actly where you are."
The truth seems to be, as Mr. La Farge points
out, that we're asking our teachers to become
increasingly efficient in their teaching.
We prefer memorizing authoritative opin
ions from expeits to lengthy and frustrating
discussions where we trade our own nebulous
and uncertain ideas.
We applaud a teacher who can simplify a
complex cause-and effect situation into a clear
cut list of factors we can understand without
strain.

We ask professors not to confuse us by inter
spersing abstract references to other fields
with the subject matter relevant to the final
exam.
And then, ironically enough, as final exami
nation time comes we begin complaining: "It's
not that I mind studying when the course is
interesting. It's just that I'm so sick of mem
orizing."
With one and the same breath we demand
courses that are "interesting" and "well-or
ganized." We force our professors to narrow
their lectures to a clear-cut simple outline of
relevant factors and concrete examples. And
then we complain because such a study, iso
lated from the broad knowledge that is real
education, is not interesting.
This week, more than any other in the quar
ter, we are devoting dinner-table and Cellar
bull sessions to the appraisal of our education.
And so this week it seems necessary to re
member that real education is learning to relate
all kinds of knowledge—simple and complex,
concrete and abstract, immediately relevant
and immediately irrelevant—into one whole;
not organized, not clear-cut, not simple, but
maybe the truth.
