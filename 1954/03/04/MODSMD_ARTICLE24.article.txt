### PETE GROTHE 
MIKE HAMMER ON THE FARM: CONCLUSION
(Recap: In yesterday's installment, Mike Ham
mer, Class of '4f>, returned to Stanford to kill who
ever murdered his best friend and Rally Com side
kick, Willie. At the Cellar, he met Vilma Dance,
"a broad who could drop any man at 50 paces,"
and Vilma had some information on Willie. As
yesterday's episode ended, Mike said. "The plot
was thickening. And (hat's the way I like it.")
I could learn to like Vilma. She had it. We sat
down at one of the benches, and I had a coffee and
she, a vodka. It occurred to me strange that she
should have a vodka at the Cellar, but, I didn't think
much about it. Anyway, I liked women who could
take it strohg.
"Here comes the ambulance to take away that
dead cop who tried to 'give me the parking ticket,"
Vilma sighed.

"Yeah, I'm sorry I had to plug
him. He died hard. But he died
fast. Death is merciful."
"I love you, Mike."
"Thanks."
The sound of Vilma's melodic
voice, the flutter of her dewey
e y elas h e a, and those curves
which reminded me of the road
to Rossotti's were really getting
to me. But I was after a killer.

so I suggested we leave the Cellar and talk turkey.
As I left, I took out my .45 and shot three holes into
a hive of bees that I noticed. Cups of coffee were
dropped: sandwiches were sprayed over the pave
ment; and screaming girls whizzed off for all cor
ners.
It was fun.
But the time had come for business. I got Vilma
in the phone booth and said,
"Okay, come clean. What do you know? Talk
straight. And talk hard. Willie was killed a week
ago, and his killer has been running around loose a
week too long. My patience is getting damn thin,
and my trigger finger damn itchy." ,
"So I notice," she said, fluttering those dewey
eyelashes again. "Here's briefly what I know. Wil
lie had something on Chief Gordy Davis. Apparently,
he had too much. And poor Willie got it."
A curse caught in my throat. I couldn't believe
it. Chief Gordy was as honest and as decent a
cop as there was. He and I had always worked well
together.
"But, I'll tell you what," she continued. "Go out

to the BAC and see the Air ROTC colonel. The
colonel can tell you more than I."
I kissed the wench on the nose, left her, and walked
over to the BAC. Twelve minutes later I kicked on
the door of the Air RO office. Some twerp in a bus
driver's uniform walked out and told me to be
quiet. I didn't like him.
"Listen, Greyhound employee, I want to see the
colonel ... now!"
His eyes were narrow slits of hate as he shouted,
"Get out!"
"Punk, you'll be smart if you don't open your
mouth again, because if you do, I'll slam your teeth
right down your throat."
He started to open his mouth, so I just gavÂ£ him
the butt of the gun against the side of the head. He
crumpled into a nice heap on the floor, and I kicked
him under the table. I hate messy floors.
I walked into the colonel's office, and what I saw
hit me like eight bolts of lightning. The colonel
had curves like the road to Rossotti's and long,
dewey eyelids. And long, flowing blond hair. The
colonel was Vilma.
"What is this, a joke?" I gasped.
"No," she said, lowering her voice. "For my work
in the WACs during the war, I was put in charge
of the Air RO program here. The boys like it that
way. But I've talked enough. Come over and kiss
me."
I stood there a minute stunned, and then every
thing seemed to fit together. The vodka at the
Cellar. There's only one country where you drink
vodka instead of coffee. And Willie. I remember
his writing me that he was investigating subver
sives in the military. Willie had known too much
about someone. And that someone had to get rid
of him. That someone was Vilma.
She was smart. She knew what I was thinking.
She got up from her desk, fluttered her eyelids, took
a step toward me, and whispered, "Kiss me."
The roar of my .45 shook the room twice. She
got two burning slugs of lead in the guts, the same
place that she had shot Willie. She stood there,
her eyes a symphony of unbelief. Then she twisted
to the door and gasped, "How could you?"
I had to talk quick, because in a few seconds I'd
be speaking to a corpse.
"It was easy," I said.
Outside, the cold gray sky was emitting a soft
drizzle. I put the brim of my hat down, pulled the
collar over my neck, and walked slowly down Palm
Drive to the bus depot.
I wasn't going to pay any cabby $1.50.
