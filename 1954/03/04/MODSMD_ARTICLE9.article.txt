## Davis Says Traffic Will Grow Worse 
### RUTH JAHNKE 
Associate Editor, The Daily
"Traffic conditions won't get
better—just worse, and restric
tions on campus parking and
driving will get tighter for guite
a while," predicted Police Chief
Gordon Davis in last night's Ex-!
ecutive Committee meeting at
Toyon.
The weekday traffic congestion
was partially blamed by Davis on
students taking their cars to classes, i
He mentioned one case cited for
overparking where the student had
driven one and a half blocks to
class.
Davis suggested that the prob
lem could be considerably im
proved if students living on cam
pus would walk to classes, leav
ing parking space for off-campus
students.
There are 3,200 parking spaces on
campus, and 5,000 cars are regis
tered with the campus police, ac
cording to Davis. Of these, nearly
4,000 are parked on campus on the
peak days, Monday and Wednesday.
Additional space is available for
parking, but not where tho drivers
want it.
Davis told Excom and the 20 to
30 students who attended this last
meeting of the quarter that each
parking space, for each car, costs
the University $100 to construct. He
added, "There's not much about this
parking problem that we couldn't
fix with some money."
Excom also discussed the Engi
neering Corner blockade, and Rudy
Reich, president of Axe Society and
member of the Hazards Committee,
brought up five suggestions to cor
rect the congestion around the Post
Office, Cellar, and Engineering Cor
ner during the noon hour.
Davis emphasized that the chain
blockade is only temporary, and
that removable posts will be in
stalled as soon as possible. He
also mentioned that the <rafli«-
problem will probably be allevi
ated by the planned periphery
road, which would skirt the Quad
area completely.
Reserved parking space was dis
cussed, and Davis stated that Jess
than 200 spaces are reserved, leav
ing from 150 to 200 qualified per
sons to battle with the students for
parking space. Part of the spaces
are for faculty and staff members,
and part arc for physically handi
capped students.
In discussing the 25-miles-an
hour speed limit on Palm Drive,
Davis stated that it takes about two
minutes to drive the length of Palm
Drive, and that a car would have to
go 60 miles an hour in order to save
60 seconds. He said that 30 miles
an hour is allowed, and should not
be exceeded.

4,000 are parked on campus on the
peak days, Monday and Wednesday.
Additional space is available for
parking, but not where tho drivers
want it.
Davis told Excom and the 20 to
30 students who attended this last
meeting of the quarter that each
parking space, for each car, costs
the University $100 to construct. He
added, "There's not much about this
parking problem that we couldn't
fix with some money."
Excom also discussed the Engi
neering Corner blockade, and Rudy
Reich, president of Axe Society and
member of the Hazards Committee,
brought up five suggestions to cor
rect the congestion around the Post
Office, Cellar, and Engineering Cor
ner during the noon hour.
Davis emphasized that the chain
blockade is only temporary, and
that removable posts will be in
stalled as soon as possible. He
also mentioned that the <rafli«-
problem will probably be allevi
ated by the planned periphery
road, which would skirt the Quad
area completely.
Reserved parking space was dis
cussed, and Davis stated that Jess
than 200 spaces are reserved, leav
ing from 150 to 200 qualified per
sons to battle with the students for
parking space. Part of the spaces
are for faculty and staff members,
and part arc for physically handi
capped students.
In discussing the 25-miles-an
hour speed limit on Palm Drive,
Davis stated that it takes about two
minutes to drive the length of Palm
Drive, and that a car would have to
go 60 miles an hour in order to save
60 seconds. He said that 30 miles
an hour is allowed, and should not
be exceeded.

"Traffic conditions won't get
better—just worse, and restric
tions on campus parking and
driving will get tighter for guite
a while," predicted Police Chief
Gordon Davis in last night's Ex-!
ecutive Committee meeting at
Toyon.
The weekday traffic congestion
was partially blamed by Davis on
students taking their cars to classes, i
He mentioned one case cited for
overparking where the student had
driven one and a half blocks to
class.
Davis suggested that the prob
lem could be considerably im
proved if students living on cam
pus would walk to classes, leav
ing parking space for off-campus
students.
There are 3,200 parking spaces on
campus, and 5,000 cars are regis
tered with the campus police, ac
cording to Davis. Of these, nearly
4,000 are parked on campus on the
peak days, Monday and Wednesday.
