THE BEST OF
EVERYTHING
As "Miss Spaghetti" and "Miss Macaroni"'- (better known as Maria
Turco and Joyce Bryscn of Russell at Stanford) we would like to tell
you about the FOOD and FUN on the SUPER GRAND AIR TOUR. Every
one gets fed and has some fun when they go to Europe, but we're speak
ing of "THE BEST"! We really learned the art of European gastronomy
last summer! You might experiment with such dishes as fresh gulls
eggs served in a bed of dry moss at Jammet' in Dublin. Den Cyldone
Freden in Stockholm serves delicious miniature lobsters called Kraftor.
At the Five Flies (that's the name!), in Amsterdam wc had the roast
duck with orange. You'll never forget the smorrebrod at The Marierilyst
near Hamlet's Castle in Denmark. There's a spectacular dinner and
floor show in store for you at the Palm Beach Casino near Cannes. And
we'll never forget the wonderful picnic with hot bean soup atop Mt.
First in Switzerland and the cold salami sandwiches in the hidden coves
on Capri!
The FUN part of a trip to Europe is pretty hard to guarantee as its
somewhat an individual and personal thing, but being with a group of
young people, seeing ALL of Europe, and having plenty of leisure time,
arc some of the reasons we think you'll have FUN on the SUPER CRAND
AIR TOUR. From our first night at our Killarney Hotel with an Irishman
from Detroit joining the natives in Irish jigs and songs, through the
roistering laughter of the wine-drinkers at Rudescheim and the beer
drinkers at Heidelberg, and the wonderful evening serenade from gon
dolas on the Grand Canal in Venice to the "quaint Cr quiet" or "frenxicd
& fabulous" night spots in gay Paree, we had FUN in the true European
style as members of the
SUPER GRAND AIR TOUR

eggs served in a bed of dry moss at Jammet' in Dublin. Den Cyldone
Freden in Stockholm serves delicious miniature lobsters called Kraftor.
At the Five Flies (that's the name!), in Amsterdam wc had the roast
duck with orange. You'll never forget the smorrebrod at The Marierilyst
near Hamlet's Castle in Denmark. There's a spectacular dinner and
floor show in store for you at the Palm Beach Casino near Cannes. And
we'll never forget the wonderful picnic with hot bean soup atop Mt.
First in Switzerland and the cold salami sandwiches in the hidden coves
on Capri!
The FUN part of a trip to Europe is pretty hard to guarantee as its
somewhat an individual and personal thing, but being with a group of
young people, seeing ALL of Europe, and having plenty of leisure time,
arc some of the reasons we think you'll have FUN on the SUPER CRAND
AIR TOUR. From our first night at our Killarney Hotel with an Irishman
from Detroit joining the natives in Irish jigs and songs, through the
roistering laughter of the wine-drinkers at Rudescheim and the beer
drinkers at Heidelberg, and the wonderful evening serenade from gon
dolas on the Grand Canal in Venice to the "quaint Cr quiet" or "frenxicd
& fabulous" night spots in gay Paree, we had FUN in the true European
style as members of the
SUPER GRAND AIR TOUR

THE BEST OF
EVERYTHING
As "Miss Spaghetti" and "Miss Macaroni"'- (better known as Maria
Turco and Joyce Bryscn of Russell at Stanford) we would like to tell
you about the FOOD and FUN on the SUPER GRAND AIR TOUR. Every
one gets fed and has some fun when they go to Europe, but we're speak
ing of "THE BEST"! We really learned the art of European gastronomy
last summer! You might experiment with such dishes as fresh gulls
eggs served in a bed of dry moss at Jammet' in Dublin. Den Cyldone
Freden in Stockholm serves delicious miniature lobsters called Kraftor.
