tional- organizations. She was an

Dean Yost said upon her retire
ment, "It pays a hundred times over
to have the satisfaction of knowing
that you have had listening ears for
the troubles and perplexities of
young people, because in the telling,
they have clarified and perhaps
solved their own difficulties. You
merely stood by."
Dean Yost did not believe that
the job of Dean of Women was a
policing one. She stated that she
was not there just "to make the
girls behave." She helped to guide
and develop the women's resi
dence program, the Stanford

She was active in local ancl na

When she retired from active
work at Stanford in 1946, she was
given an honorary LL.D. from
Mills College 'in recognition of
her long service to women."
Dean Yost said upon her retire
ment, "It pays a hundred times over
to have the satisfaction of knowing
that you have had listening ears for
the troubles and perplexities of
young people, because in the telling,
they have clarified and perhaps
solved their own difficulties. You
merely stood by."
Dean Yost did not believe that
the job of Dean of Women was a
policing one. She stated that she
was not there just "to make the
girls behave." She helped to guide
and develop the women's resi
dence program, the Stanford
Health Service and many other
student activities.
In 1946, the Associated Students
of Stanford University established
an honorary scholarship in her
honor. Each year the Associated
Women Students make a substantial
contribution to the scholarship.
Dean Yost is survived by a sister,
Mrs. Thomas A. Gallagher, Sr., and
a brother Frank M. Yost Sr.
The funeral will be arranged by
Roller and Hapgood.
