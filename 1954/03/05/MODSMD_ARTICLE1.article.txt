as the Dean of Women and associ
ate professor of English. She re
tained this post for 25 years, until

She was active in local ancl na
tional- organizations. She was an
honorary member in Cap & Gown,

ciety. She was the first vice-presi
dent, national board of the Ameri
can Association of University Wom
en from 1933 to 1937. She was also

her long service to women."
Dean Yost said upon her retire
ment, "It pays a hundred times over
to have the satisfaction of knowing
that you have had listening ears for
the troubles and perplexities of
young people, because in the telling,
they have clarified and perhaps
solved their own difficulties. You
merely stood by."
Dean Yost did not believe that
the job of Dean of Women was a
policing one. She stated that she
was not there just "to make the
girls behave." She helped to guide
and develop the women's resi
dence program, the Stanford

and had been seriously ill for the iast few days.
Dean Yost was born Sept. 25, 1881, in Staunton, Virginia. She
graduated from Vassar in 1904. She taught in the Wellesley Eng-

lish Department for a year and
then returned to Vassar lor her
master's degree. She received
from the University of Michigan in
1917. In 1921 she came to Stanford
as the Dean of Women and associ
ate professor of English. She re
tained this post for 25 years, until
she retired in 1946.
She was active in local ancl na
tional- organizations. She was an
honorary member in Cap & Gown,
women's undergraduate honor so
ciety. She was the first vice-presi
dent, national board of the Ameri
can Association of University Wom
en from 1933 to 1937. She was also
the vice-president of the California
division in 1923. She was an active
member of the Business and Pro
fessional Women's Club of Palo
Alto and of the National Association
of Deans of Women. She was the
vice-president in 1922 of the West
ern Division of Department of Deans
of Women of the National Educa
tion Association.
When she retired from active
work at Stanford in 1946, she was
given an honorary LL.D. from
Mills College 'in recognition of
her long service to women."
Dean Yost said upon her retire
ment, "It pays a hundred times over
to have the satisfaction of knowing
that you have had listening ears for
the troubles and perplexities of
young people, because in the telling,
they have clarified and perhaps
solved their own difficulties. You
merely stood by."
Dean Yost did not believe that
the job of Dean of Women was a
policing one. She stated that she
was not there just "to make the
girls behave." She helped to guide
and develop the women's resi
dence program, the Stanford
Health Service and many other
student activities.
In 1946, the Associated Students
of Stanford University established
an honorary scholarship in her
honor. Each year the Associated
Women Students make a substantial
contribution to the scholarship.
Dean Yost is survived by a sister,
Mrs. Thomas A. Gallagher, Sr., and
a brother Frank M. Yost Sr.
The funeral will be arranged by
Roller and Hapgood.
