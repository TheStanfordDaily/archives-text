More than five acres of Stanford
Village property has been selected
for construction of an Army reserve
training armory, according to a Palo
Alto Times article yesterday.
The armory reportedly would be
built off Ravenswood Avenue, a
short distance west of Middlefield
Road, and would l>e large enough to
train 200 men.
Stanford officials contacted yes
terday said they had no information
concerning the construction of the
armory.
The Times unofficial source in the
San Francisco Presidio said that the
cost of the armory would be about
$150,000, but that the building might
be expanded later.
