# 'THE TEMPEST'
## 'Imaginative' Production Of Classic 
### TERRY COMITO 
The Stanford Playeis' imagi
native revival of Shakespeare's
philosophical fairy tale, "The
Tempest," is likely to leave you
either completely absorbed or
rather uncomfortably bored.
"The Tempest" is, in other words
a matter of taste. A product of the
Bard's "tranquil old age," it is a
thing of nymphs, fishlike monsters,
and dog-headed sprites — serene,
beautiful, and, for some tastes, pos
sibly a little pallid.
As produced by the Stanford Play
ers, the play is something of an
orgy of special effects. Things,
sprites, and apparitions keep rising
from the ground, hurtling down
from the sky, and rumbling through
hidden doors in the scenery with
amazing frequency. That all this ac
tivity should add to, rather than de
tract from, the delicate tone is a
tribute to director Norman Phil
brick's taste and imagination.
The fluid use of light and John
Hunt's atmospheric music also
help to create in large measure
the necessary poetic mood. The
dances, however, arc uninspired,
and at this viewing, apparently
under-rehearsed.
Patrick Wymark brings to the role
of Prospero a fine suavity and a
totally professional air. If he does
not completely succeed in the diffi
cult task of bringing Shakespeare's
character to life, he gives what is at
least an unusually good recitation.
But it is the buffoons—Ron
Feinberg as the leering monster,
Rossiter Durfee, the riotously
drunken butler, and Anthony
Nicholson, the imbecile jester—
who give the play its livliest mo
ments. They arc not profound,
but they are within their limits
more nearly successful.
If "The Tempest" is not, as a
whole, completely satisfying, it is, in
its parts, imaginative and worthy of
respect.
