was the date of the first celebration
of Founders' Day,"and that date,
March 9, has been celebrated ever

death of Mrs. Stanford in February,
1905, causing the ceremony to be
canceled that year. Recently the
observance has been held on the
Sunday nearest March 9.

front of the altar during the serv
ice in the traditional Commemo
ration of the Founders' ceremony.
The scripture lesson will be read

the senior class.

ulty members, the executive com
mittee of the faculty, and student
body officers.
The choir, directed by Professor
Harold C. Schmidt, will present
"Their Bodies Are Buried in Peace"
by Handel, "Festival Te Deum" by
Williams, and "O King, to Whom All
Things Do Live" by Willan.
Chaplain Robert M. Minto will
conduct the service, and Herbert B.
Nanney, University organist, will
accompany the choir.
Two Stanford songs, "Come Join
the Band" and "Stanford Forever,"
