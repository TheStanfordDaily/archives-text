# Hughes Views Italian Crisis
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Dr. H. Stuart Hughes of the His
tory Department, in his talk before
the Stanford Area Young Demo
crats on the subject of the present
situation in Italy, declared that "the
election last June started a per
manent crisis which gives no signs
of letting up."
Dr. Hughes stated that the gov
ernment of Italy is approximately
in the same position that it was in
when De Gasperi relinquished pow
er nine months ago, although the
extreme wings have gained some
measure of power over the center
parties.
With the loss of the "father-im
agc" Dc Gasperi and the death of
Stalin, the influence of the Soviet
Union has expanded at the expense
of the United States. According to
Dr. Hughes, a reactionary quasi
fascist government or a popular
front Communist regime could as
sume control of the Italian state.
"The irony of the present situa
tion," he reflected, "is that the Unit
ed States may be forced to support
a clerical, authoritarian state where
it set out to back a democratic gov
ernment."
