# WILSON:
## McCarthy's Charges Are 'Tommyrot' 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 4 (UP).
Defense Secretary Charles E.
Wilson declared today it ia
"damn tommyrot" to claim the
Army is "coddling commu
nism," as charged by Sen. Jo
seph R. McCarthy (R.,Wis.).
McCarthy promptly retorted that
nobody said the Army "as such" is
coddling Communists. But he said
"certain individuals in the Army
have been protecting, promoting,
covering up and honorably discharg
ing known Communists."
' He obviously referred'to Maj. Ir
ving Peress of New York, former
Army dentist who was honorably
discharged after refusing to answer
loyalty questions put by the Army
and McCarthy. McCarthy called
Peress a "Fifth. Amendment Com
munist."
Wilson told a news conference the
Army made mistakes in handling
the Peress case, largely because of
red tape," and that he has ordered
a special Defense Department task
force to look into the case.
But he said "the idea that the
Army would be coddling Commu
nists is damn tommyrot." President
Eisenhower made much the same
point in much milder language
Wednesday in a news conference
statement denouncing "disregard of
the standards of fair play" by con
gressional investigators.
McCarthy, informed of Wilson's
remarks, told newsmen it has "been
established beyond any possibility
of a doubt by sworn testimony"
that "certain individuals" in the
Army have been protecting Reds.
Wilson also said he thinks the
committee "is bringing to the at
tention of the country the fact that
we have this Communist business
and have to deal with it."
But he added he would like to
see the "main devils" caught, rather
than "just a lot of little people."
