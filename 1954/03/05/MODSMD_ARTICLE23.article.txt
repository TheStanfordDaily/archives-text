## The 						Honor Code: A Year Wasted? 
### 
For two quarters the Executive Committee
has been working to analyze the Stanford
Honor Code. For two quarters this year's stu
dent body has been giving more thought to
the Honor Code than at any time during the 23
years since the Code was adopted.
In this long, slow careful study, many ques
tions have been formulated—questions which
must be answered before we can understand
what our Honor Code is today and what we
want our Honor Code to be tomorrow.
Th» answers to those questions must come
from the individuals who maintain the Stanford
Honor Code—the Stanford student body. And
they must come this year, from this year's stu
dent body, and this year's Excom.
The evaluation of an Honor Code is not an
easy task. It requires time and it requires
thought. But we have taken the time, and we
have been doing the thinking. If our time and
our thought are not to be completely wasted,
we must accomplish the evaluation ourselves.
Too often Excom begins consideration of a
difficult and complex problem, turns it over to
a committee for more exhaustive analysis,
waitc several quarters for that committee's re
port, and concludes by recommending that the
next year's Excom solve the problem.
We have very little time left in which to be
gin the Honor Code evaluation which Excom
b«'jin so ambitiously last fall. But if Excom
and the student body make spring quarter

Honor Code quarter, we may succeed in for
mulating a valid interpretation of the meaning
of today's Honor Code by June.
To spend a year of time and effort and wind
up with a recommendation that someone else
complete our job would be a monumental
waste of time.
But our 'year will prove more than worth
while if we conclude with an interpretation of
the Stanford Honor Code which will be valid
for another 23 years.
