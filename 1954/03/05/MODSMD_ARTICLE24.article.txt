We were tremendously impressed with the
report Police Chief Gordon Davis gave on cam
pus traffic problems at Wednesday night's
Executive Committee meeting.
The Chief was able to give a thorough ex
planation of the factors influencing every traf
fic decision about which Excom members or
observers questioned him.
We couldn't help wondering why the stu
dent committee studying campus traffic prob
lems, and the many individual students with
private gripes, hadn't been to talk to Chief
Davis sooner than Wednesday night.
The Chief can be found at the Police Station
in the Corporation Yard most afternoons. He
welcomes comments, complaints, or sugges
tions from any student or student groups inter
ested in Stanford's traffic dilemma.
