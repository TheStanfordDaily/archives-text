						Practical Education

V/e don't agree with the perennial gripe that
a Stanford education is too theoretical. Too
crften in house meetings, in extra-curricular
activities, just in day-to-day living, we find our
selves unable to make a valid decision be
cause we haven't taken time to think through
the basic theories which underlie either the
,«*p«ci v fic problem or our own standards of
judgment.
But we are aware that we will graduate into
a vmrld where many different kinds of decis
ions will be asked of us. And some of these
will require practical experience which cannot
be included in even the most comprehensive
university education.
The Internships in Public Affairs granted by
San Farncisco's Coro Foundation to 12 stu
dent® each year gives these students an oppor

tunity to gain this practical experience.
Each intern works right with executives at
the policy-forming level in business firms, gov
ernment offices, civic organizations, labor
unions, and political campaigns.
These internships, which include an award
of from $1000 to $1350, are open to any student
with an A.B. Major developments and aca
demic grade are unimportant.
Interviews will be held by the Coro Founda
tion at the Placement Service next Tuesday.
We urge every student who might possibly be
interested in such training to sign up now.
Practical working knowledge of the major fac
tors which shape public affairs is necessary
for every individual who plans to assume a
position of public responsibility—and in a de
mocracy this includes each one of us.
