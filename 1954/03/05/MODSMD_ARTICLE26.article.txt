## The 						Army and Communism 
### 
To th ©Editor:
Your recent editorial on Senator McCarthy's ques
tioning of General Zwicker oirtits some important
points.
The most dangerous threat to the United States
today is world Communism. The function of the
United States Army, Navy, and Air Force is to pro
t»< t this country from foreign aggression. How can
the Army defend America if it is infiltrated by the
very en«my from which it is supposed to protect her?
How effective will the Army be if its generals are
not aware of the Communist threat?

Does not the soft treatment accorded Major Peress
show that the Army does not comprehend this odious
danger to our national survival? If the Army was
aware of the danger of world Communism how could
it be so soft on a person who obviously was a Com
munist?
Even if you think that Senator McCarthy is some
limes mistaken you will have to agree with his view
that members of the Army—especially generals—
ought to be alert to the dangers of world Commu
nism.
