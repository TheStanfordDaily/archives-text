# On Opening Lake Lag
## 
### 
To the Editor:
A.i an observer from another land, I suppose I am
r Jwj in a position to comment on fhe workings of your
student gvernment council.
* However, last night your legislature showed it
stflf to be completely incompetent and irresponsible
in the handling of a minor issue. I refer to the open
ing of your Lake Lagunita. I heard that for one year,
it has been traditional for the senior class to open
your lake, but that your representative committee
must actually open the lake. The ultimate decision
*u 11pen th« li'ke but not tell the students about it

in order that the feelings of the senior class would
not be hurt was completely undemocratic and ir
responsible.
Please inform your readers that the lake is now
open for swiming for all of the students and that the
ceremonial opening will take place early in the spring
quarter.
Hoping that T have not overstepped my position as
an observer of your government, I remain,
Sincerely yours,
ROBERT MI SHELL
