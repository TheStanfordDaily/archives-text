# ‘Obstructionist Tactics?’
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Once again this observer has noted the obstruc
tionist tactics of our Men's Hall Representative to Ex
com, and I finally feel required to write this letter.
This so-called representative uses his office as a
.sounding board for his personal projects and preju
dices. He, himself, causes inefficiency in Excom. He
delays practically every measure, harasses other
members of the Committee, including our vice-presi
dent, and, in general, stirs up trouble.
I can't help but wonder if one of the major reasons
that relatively so few Stanford students take an

active interest in our student government is just be
cause ot having to work with and put up with such
people. ANY Stanford student is busy, but the time
of our student leaders is even more at a premium.
Having to spend all of every Wednesday night listen
ing to the foolishness put out by this Excom mem
ber is nothing to look forward to and prevents ade
quate action being taken on legitimate measures.
I hope the Men's Hall Representative takes this to
heart and devotes his energy along more constructive
lines before his constituents really find out how in
competently they are being represented.
