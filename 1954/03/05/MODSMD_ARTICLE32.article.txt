# â€˜Glenn Miller Story' Revives Memories
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Want to feel like an old timer?
Then see the "Glenn Miller
Story."
Most of us, especially those
with older brothers or sisters,
can dimly recall hearing such
Miller classics as "String of
Pearls," "Elmer's Tune," and
"Moonlight Seranade" when v/e
were in junior high. They are
all revivied in this unusual
technicolor film.

O'f all the great
big bands of the
late thirties, Mil
ler's was perhaps
the best. Oh sure,
there was always
Guy Lombardo
for those who like
their music
poured from a
syrup can; and

for the hepsters, to whom swing was
the thing, there was the Benny
Goodman group anchored by Gene
Krupa's frenzied beat. But the Mil
ler band was the one that had some
thing for everyone.
Universal-International has cap
tured the life and times of this great
musician with such amazing au
thenticity that the "Glenn Miller
Story" is easily the finest life of
a popular musical figure ever
screened.
The plot is an over-sugared, but
still palatable bowl of mush, yet its
flaws become buried by smooth per
formances by Jimmy Stewart and
June Allyson and the same fanatic

slavery to detail that elevated such
pictures as "Moulin Rouge" and
"Shane" from the good to the out
standing class.
Not only are the settings per
fect in every case, but a studio
orchestra has recreated the Miller
style so closely that even the
clinker in "In the Mood" is re
peated (although partially oblit
erated by an air-raid siren).
The story follows Miller through
his days with Ben Pollack's band
and then his lean days with his own
orchestra. He is soon faced with the
timeless dilemma that has plagued
all artists of whether to follow the
paved road to success or the rocky
road to art.
Although he was over-age, Mil
ler enlisted at the height of his
popularity, and the film traces his
final years entertaining the troops
overseas until his untimely death on
a routine flight to Paris.
The movie ends on a happy note
as the hand plays on after the
plane crash, "proving that the
Miller style will last forever."
But has it? The fact that a studio
orchestra could so perfectly res
urrect (he Miller classics shows
that the style can be played, but
the hands who claim to be carry
ing on the Miller tradition aren't,
and because of this failure, they
have been outclassed by the fine
new bands of today such as Les
Brown and Sauter-Finnegan.
At least we still have the Miller
recordings, however, and this movie
clearly demonstrates that if he were
alive today, Glenn Miller would still
be leading them all by the length of
a slide trombone.
