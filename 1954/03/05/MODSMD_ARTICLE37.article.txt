# Stanford—A Dream Realized
## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
Stanford University is the
realization of a dream—a •ream
that was born many years ago
m the minds of Leland and Jane
Lathrop Stanford.
The dream matured as the young
Stanfords struggled through the
early years of married life.
The dream took on a new mean
ing with the tragic death of Leland
Jr. at the age of 16.
The dream was realized on March
!' 1885, when Stanford University
vvas established under an Enabling !
Act passed by the California Legis
lature.
The Stanfords set up three aims of

j education that the University was to
achieve: practical training, personal
character, and public service.
These purposes were enlarged
' upon in the Founding Grant, which
j reads in part:
"Its nature, that of a university
with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the highest
grade, including mechanical in
stitutes, museums, galleries of art,
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necessary
for the study of agriculture in
all its branches, and for mechani

cal training, and the studies and
exercises directed to the cultiva
tion and enlargement of the mind;
"It's object, to qualify its stu
dents for personal success and di
rect usefulness in life;
''And its purposes, to promote
the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and rev
erence for the great principles of
government as derived from the
inalienable rights of man to life,

liberty, and the pursuit <»112 happi
ness."
The cornerstone of Quad was laid
on May 14, 1887, and instruction be
gan on October 1, 1891.
For the first president of the new
University, Senator Stanford ap
pointed Dr. David Starr Jordan. Dr.
Jordan was a great scientist, but,
more important, he was a man ol
clean living and high thinking, and
had a gift of communicating his
ideals to others.

Like the Stanfords, Jordan vVas J
opposed to the traditional rigidly \
prescribed entrance requirements j
and courses of study. He held that j
they tended to shackle the mind ,
with traditional prejudices and un- j
scientific modes of thought in an '
age calling for men with open and j
inquiring minds.
Senator Stanford's death in 18931
placed the new university in dire
straits. Mrs. Stanford scrimped anil
saved to keep the school open, mak
ing many sacrifices.
In July 1X!)X she wrote to a
friend, "II 1 am able to keep the
University in the condition it is
now, I shall he more than thank
ful. Fifteen thousand dollars is a
great expenditure, and exhausts
my ingenuity and resources to
such an extent that had 1 not the '
University so close to my heart I
would relieve myself of this enor
mous burden."
In this difficult period, students,
faculty, and alumni rallied to the
cause of Stanford, and, after many
a hard fight, the University was j
placed on safe financial grounds.
This Sunday, the students and I
faculty of Stanford will celebrate |
Founders' Day. They will honor i
Leland and Jane Lathrop Stanford,
and the struggles of these people to |
make the University what it is to
day.
They will pay homage to the
dreamers of a dream come true.

The dream matured as the young
Stanfords struggled through the
early years of married life.
The dream took on a new mean
ing with the tragic death of Leland
Jr. at the age of 16.
The dream was realized on March
!' 1885, when Stanford University
vvas established under an Enabling !
Act passed by the California Legis
lature.
The Stanfords set up three aims of

j education that the University was to
achieve: practical training, personal
character, and public service.
These purposes were enlarged
' upon in the Founding Grant, which
j reads in part:
"Its nature, that of a university
with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the highest
grade, including mechanical in
stitutes, museums, galleries of art,
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necessary
for the study of agriculture in
all its branches, and for mechani

cal training, and the studies and
exercises directed to the cultiva
tion and enlargement of the mind;
"It's object, to qualify its stu
dents for personal success and di
rect usefulness in life;
''And its purposes, to promote
the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and rev
erence for the great principles of
government as derived from the
inalienable rights of man to life,

liberty, and the pursuit <»112 happi
ness."
The cornerstone of Quad was laid
on May 14, 1887, and instruction be
gan on October 1, 1891.
For the first president of the new
University, Senator Stanford ap
pointed Dr. David Starr Jordan. Dr.
Jordan was a great scientist, but,
more important, he was a man ol
clean living and high thinking, and
had a gift of communicating his
ideals to others.

Like the Stanfords, Jordan vVas J
opposed to the traditional rigidly \
prescribed entrance requirements j
and courses of study. He held that j
they tended to shackle the mind ,
with traditional prejudices and un- j
scientific modes of thought in an '
age calling for men with open and j
inquiring minds.
Senator Stanford's death in 18931
placed the new university in dire
straits. Mrs. Stanford scrimped anil
saved to keep the school open, mak
ing many sacrifices.
In July 1X!)X she wrote to a
friend, "II 1 am able to keep the
University in the condition it is
now, I shall he more than thank
ful. Fifteen thousand dollars is a
great expenditure, and exhausts
my ingenuity and resources to
such an extent that had 1 not the '
University so close to my heart I
would relieve myself of this enor
mous burden."
In this difficult period, students,
faculty, and alumni rallied to the
cause of Stanford, and, after many
a hard fight, the University was j
placed on safe financial grounds.
This Sunday, the students and I
faculty of Stanford will celebrate |
Founders' Day. They will honor i
Leland and Jane Lathrop Stanford,
and the struggles of these people to |
make the University what it is to
day.
They will pay homage to the
dreamers of a dream come true.
