# HEADING SOUTH
## 
### 
If you are hoping to go to Europe
this summer and plan on using this
coming Spring Vacation to convince
your parents it's a noble idea, I will
be glad to assist said cause. I, too,
will be in the Southland during
Spring Vacation with my 45-min
ute colored-sound movie of our last
year's Super Grand Air Tour, show
ing it at the homes of last year's
tour members and those interested
in joining the 1954 edition of this
most comprehensive yet leisurely
trip through Europe. If you'd like
to see this movie along with your
parents and home-town friends,
lust call me at DA 3-5166 ary)
we'll arrange the time and place.
Good luck to all on Finals!
