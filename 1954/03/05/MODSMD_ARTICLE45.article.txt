# IIR's Library Provides A Close Look at the World
## 
### EDA MENDELS 
A street map of Berlin, recent figures on Australian wool pro
duction, United Nations bulletins—these may be of interest to the
internationally minded, so they are included in the library of the
Institute of International Relations.
It is only a small room, arranged by students, but the lIR Library

stores a wealth of information in"*
recent pamphlets and newsletters. |
The room is in the same building as
the general lIR workroom, exactly
opposite the Chappie office. Any J
student is welcome to browse j
around and borrow the materials.
The library is organized in three j
sections: United Nations and its j
agencies, political and economic;
conditions of separate nations, and j
travel.
The U.N. shelves contain vari
ous magazines about the U.N., and
bulletins directly from the U.N.
about each of its agencies and
councils. U.S. Department of State |
bulletins arc filed there too. The
library lends films and posters '
about operation of the U.N. and
furnishes outlines for teaching j
purposes in youth projects. School
teachers from the neighborhood
use these aids occasionally.
The flies on each of the countries
are filled with newsletters from
their embassies in the U.S., docu
ments directly from the country,
and pertinent magazine articles or [
speeches.
The travel section provides a
transportation rack with (light
schedules of leading airlines and
sailing plans of steamship compa
nies. Another file is maintained
with travel folders from many
countries, listing possible itinera
ries and highlights that the trav
eler should not miss. Brochures
of work camps, study tours, and
sightseeing trips arc also avail
able, as well as catalogues of sum
mer schools abroad and programs
for spending an entire school year
elsewhere.
Filing all the reports and maga
zines that comc in daily is a big job.
John McDill, Marilyn Miler, Lee
Evans, and Roseann Taormina have
done the lion's share of it during
the past term, but new help is very
welcome and necessary. Miss Miler
suggests that anyone interested in
arranging these materials contact
her at Ventura Hall after 7 p.m. for
further information.


WORLD LIBRARY—Nancy Hood, lIR vice-president, and Keith Nelson, director of the affilia
tions department, consult one of the many current magazines received at the lIR Library. Be
hind them at the left are files on different countries, filled with releases from their embassies.
The rack at lower right contains a variety of travel folders on transportation or tours. All these
materials and others are available to the Stanford student body at the lIR Shack.

A street map of Berlin, recent figures on Australian wool pro
duction, United Nations bulletins—these may be of interest to the
internationally minded, so they are included in the library of the
Institute of International Relations.
It is only a small room, arranged by students, but the lIR Library

stores a wealth of information in"*
recent pamphlets and newsletters. |
The room is in the same building as
the general lIR workroom, exactly
opposite the Chappie office. Any J
student is welcome to browse j
around and borrow the materials.
The library is organized in three j
sections: United Nations and its j
agencies, political and economic;
conditions of separate nations, and j
travel.
The U.N. shelves contain vari
ous magazines about the U.N., and
bulletins directly from the U.N.
about each of its agencies and
councils. U.S. Department of State |
bulletins arc filed there too. The
library lends films and posters '
about operation of the U.N. and
furnishes outlines for teaching j
purposes in youth projects. School
teachers from the neighborhood
use these aids occasionally.
