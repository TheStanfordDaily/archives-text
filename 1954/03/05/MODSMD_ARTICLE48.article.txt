# HONOR CODE
## Student Control Council Awaits End-Quarter Rush 
### BARBARA TUERK 
There are 10 students on campus who cannot count on time to
study during Dead Week and Exams.
For the members of the Council for Student Control—the five
members of Men's Council and the five members of Women's
Council —these two weeks are often the busiest part of the quarter.

Many of the five' or six cases han
dled by the Council in an average
quarter will fall during this period.
A case must be handled as soon as
possible after the violation is re
ported, and may take anywhere
from two to eight hours to decide.
Brooks Cowgill and Monica Ver
durmen, chairmen of this year's
Council, explain the procedure for a
typical Honor Code case this way:
1. A student or an instructor be
lieves that a student is violating
the Honor Code.
2. He warns the suspected vio
lator in some way—in a test sit
uation by talking to him, or by
tapping his pencil if he wants to
keep his identity secret.
3. If the student continues to
violate the Code after the warn
ing, the person who has observed
the violation either asks him to
turn himself in or turns him in
directly.
The simplest way to report a vio
lation is to telephone Cowgill at the
Alpha Sig house, if the violator is a
man; or Miss Verdurmen at Lagu
nita, if the violator is a woman.
Both Cowgill and Miss Verdur
men emphasize that every step in
an Honor Code case is completely
confidential. Neither the name of
the person charged with the viola
tion nor the name of the person who
turns him in is told to anyone not
directly connected with the case.
Once Cowgill or Miss Verdurmen
is told of the suspected violation,
they check with the instructor in
volved, the necessary witnesses, and
the defendant to learn as much as
possible about the case before the
trial is held.
Again, this investigation is as
confidential as possible. No one is
questioned unless his 'evidence is
necessary for a fair trial.
Cowgill or Miss Verdurmen calls
the Council for a meeting as soon as
possible after learning of the viola
tion—"a week at the most," Cowgill
estimates.
Trials are usually held in the
Dean of Students' conference room.
Witnesses and defendants arrive at
different times, and wait in separate
rooms outside of the trial room, so
they never meet each other.
The Council questions each wit
ness carefully—and often at great
length— to discover whether a vio
lation was committed.
The defendant is questioned last.

He is introduced to each member of
the Council, assured that his testi
mony will be taken on his "word
as a Stanford gentleman or woman,"
and encouraged to explain his case
as thoroughly as he can.
Whether or not a violation was
committed is the first thing the
Council, tries to decide. If the
Council finds that it was, it begins
consideration of secondary fac
tors: the amount of premedita
tion involved, the student's motive
for cheating, and his understand
ing of the Code.
Factors such as the importance of
the midterm or paper involved and
how much benefit the student de
rived from his violation are rarely
involved.
If the Council finds that a viola
tion has occurred, it must give the
student some penalty. Possible pen
alties range from the minimum of
an F on the test or paper on which
the violation occurred to an F in the
whole course, a one-, two-, or
three-quarter suspension, or expul
sion.
No mention of the Code violation
is ever made anywhere on a stu
dent's record.
The most typical violations arc
plagiarism, looking at another stu
dent's paper, using a book on a
take-home quiz, or bringing notes
into class for a closed-book test.
Members of the Council arc
elected by the entire student body
in elections held spring and fall
quarters. Serving with Cowgill and
Miss Verdurmen on the preser'
Council are Pat Sumner, Mart!, a
Chappie, Jean McClure, Lynn ( V -
guson, Marty Trieb, Rusty Russell,
Bob Margolis, and Rod Hall.
