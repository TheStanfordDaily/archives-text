# Paly Theater Sues Censors
## 
### 
A test suit concerning the con
stitutionality of the Palo Alto film
censorship system has been filed by
a Palo Alto theater operator.
The suit, filed by AI Lauricc,
owner of the Cardinal Theater in
South Palo Alto, charges that the
city's Board on Commercial Amuse
ments violates the U.S. and Califor
nia constitutions by restricting the
viewing of motion pictures.
(The Palo Alto Board on Com
mercial Amusements is a seven
member body appointed by the
mayor to serve without pay. They
decide, on the basis of reveiws by a
number of organizations, whether or
not a film is suitable for viewing in
the city. If they /lecide against a
film, they must be given a special
preview before the theater can show
the picture.)
Lauricc stated that he was not
interested in showing the domestic
films specifically outlawed by the
board, but that he wished to show
films which had not been reviewed
by the agencies which determine
the findings of the group. He hopes
to specialize in the showing of for
eign films.
