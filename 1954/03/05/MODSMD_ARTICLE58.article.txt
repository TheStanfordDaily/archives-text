# Frost vs. Brown In Court Duel
## 
### 
Coach Bob Renker's tennis team
faces College of Pacific on the Stan
ford courts at 1:30 this afternoon.
Renker has annoLinced he will
play his reserve racketmen against
the weaker COP, while resting Jack
Frost and the other Stanford big
guns for Saturday's match with the
Olympic Club which he termed "our
toughest match."
Frost, who is ranked 21st in the
nation, will have the man-sized job
of stopping the Olympic Club's Tom
Brown, San Francisco lawyer and
former Davis Cup player. Brown is
currently rated as the number two
player in Northern California, sec
ond only to San Leandro's tempera
mental court genius Art Larsen.
Tennis experts say that Brown has
lost none of the steady brand of play
which earned him a berth on the
1952 U.S. Davis Cup team.
Stanford's Gary Gray meets the
Olympic Club's number two man,
Nick Carter, in the other featured
match of the day. Carter, while not
widely known, is one of the top
notch Pacific Coast tennis amateurs.
No collegiate team has ever de
feated the Olympic Club team in a
match.
Saturday's varsity match is slated
to begin at I p.m. In the prelimi
nary match Stanford freshmen tan
gle with the Oakland Tennis Club at
10 a.m., also on the local courts.
