Jim Scott, the Berkeley sports writer who penned that timely article
last fall asking 'Is Stanford Through as a Grid Power?" has unleashed
another controversial bombshell in the April issue of Sport. This one is
entitled, "What's Wrong With Cal Track?" and the subject of the attack
is Coach Brutus Hamilton.
And Hamilton, you may remember, was track coach of the United States
Olympic team in 1952.
How good does a track team have to be to satisfy Mr. Scott? I won
der if ninth in the nation will do. That's where Cal placed in the NCAA
championships last June.
Scott says Hamilton should get the boot at Cal because "in 35 dual meets
with USC, the Bears have won only seven, none of them under the helm
of Hamilton." Is Hamilton a poor coach because he hasn't beaten the team
which has won the national championship 17 of the last 20 years?
Stanford Coach Jack Weiershauser will tell you what's wrong with Cal's
track team. It beats Stanford too often. Stanford has a reputation for
pretty fair cinder crews, but the Indians and the Bears have divided their
last eight meets.
And as much as I hate to say it, Cal may win the Big Meet again this
year. Hamilton has a bevy of front-line stars to throw at the Indians.
Lon Spurrier in the half mile, Len Simpson in the mile, Herb Jackson
from Alameda and Guy Blackburn in the sprints, sophomore Dennis
Cutland and Larry Anderson, who have both cleared 111-7, in the pole
vault, Don Timmerman in the quarter, and Dick Righter in the javelin
won't be easy to beat.
No, Brutus Hamilton hasn't beaten SC, but nevertheless he has a pretty
fair country track team.

Jeanc Hoffman, the Lee Hansen of the Los Angeles Times, reports that
Stanford's Bob Mathias, who is now making a flick about his athletic feats,
may be the next Tarzan of the movies. Elroy "Crazylegs" Hirsch of Los
Angeles Ram football fame is also being considered for the role as the
hero of the jungle. Hampering Mathias* chances is his commitment with
the Marines. The decathlon champ reports June 4.

Two games can't be an accurate criteria, of course, but Stanford's ques
tion-mark baseball team seems to be jelling into a dangerous outfit.
Coach Everett Dean still has a long way to go before he can field a
crew to match last year's power-laden lineup. But he's getting there fast.
The problem is whether he can knit last year's reserves and the sophs
up from the freshman nine into a club of championship potential before
the league opener against UCLA in Los Angeles the end of the month.
Warren Goodrich, who ,walls off the left side of the infield, and Rich i
Scramaglia, the hustling second-sacker, form Dean's nucleus. The Indian !
mentor has a bevy of versatile players to fit into the other six positions. I
All of them have played a lot of baseball, but not together on the Stanford
varsity.
The performances of the sophomores have been very pleasing. Tony I
Serra (well, he'll be a soph next quarter), the husky San Franciscan, j
has put in a claim on first base; Ray Young, a fast-balling right-hander,
has worked well in his two short stints on the mound.
Bob Evans, who's all arms and legs when he runs, has pounded four
hits in eight trips, and Mickey Holzman, co-captain of the frosh, has
turned in good games at third.
In Sid Hall, who looks like a little bug darting around center field, Tom
Dandurand, the slugging third baseman, and Lenny Swartz, the smooth- !
working catcher, Deans has baseball talent that was overlooked when
Shepard, Essegian, Swarts, Murphy, etc. were around.
With a few more games under its belt, this outfit will be mighty hard to
beat. Yes, it looks as if Dean and Billy Alhouse are doing an excellent
job of rebuilding.
