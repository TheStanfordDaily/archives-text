# Stanford Gymnasts Tangle With Bears Tomorrow in TV Match at Berkeley
## 
### 
Stanford's rapidly improving gym
nastics team travels to Berkeley to
morrow afternoon to meet a highly
rated Cal squad in the renewal of
a spirited rivalry which ranks with
other Stanford - Cal contests. The
meet is set for 2 p.m. at California's

Men's Gym.
Special features of (lie meet will
he the big TV cameras lining the
sidelines. This gymnastics meet
will he the first in (his area to he
telecast, and will he carried on
Station KGO-TV.
Stanford will sorely miss the i
services of Boh Pierce, the freshman
rope climber who has yet to place !
below first. He has swept past all
challengers easily, but will be forced
to stay on the campus to take a
special military exam which cannot
be re-scheduled.
As usual, Jerry Nesselrod, the
most consistent and diversified
pojnt-getter for Stanford, will be
going all out against Cal to win the
"all-around" category. This title is
worth five extra points besides other
points collected in competing for it.
Stanford has a 3-1 collegiate rec
ord to date, trimming San Jose
twice and Cal Poly once, while los
ing to Washington State College.
They also dropped a decision to the
Olympic Club of San Francisco last
week.
