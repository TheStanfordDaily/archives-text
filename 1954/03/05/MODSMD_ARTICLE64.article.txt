# Card Baseballers To Host Fort Ord, San Jose State; Oaks, Seals, UCLA Featured On Vacation Schedule
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
Stanford's undefeated baseballers play Fort Ord today at 3:15
and meet San Jose State tomorrow at 2:30. Both games aru at the
Sunken Diamond.
Mike Acker and Phil Page are slated to throw against the pro
laden soldiers. Last year the Indians dropped a 5-4 decision to
the same outfit, but it took a three +

run homer by Yankee pitcher Tom
Morgan in the ninth to do it.
Saturday Ray Young and Ken
Brown will,toe the rubber against
a San Jose team that is similar to
the Indians—long on pitching and
speed, but short on pow'er. The Spar
tans boast one of the Bay Area's top
pro prospects in pitcher John Old
ham, who will be in action either
tomorrow or Monday when Stanford
journeys to San Jose for a return
engagement. Game time is 2:30.
Coach I)can will stick with the
same lineup that pounded USE
hurlers for 22 hits.
After the Monday game, Stanford,
which has gone to opposite extremes,
2-1 and 2G-5, to win its first two
contests, will lay off until after
finals.
Spring vacation will be a busy pe
riod for the horsehiders as they play
five games, culminating with two
tilts in Los Angeles against UCLA

to open CIBA and PCC play. Players
who are expected to see action dur-
I ing this week aside from tomorrow's
j starters include pitchers Ray Young,
Phil Page, Mike Acker, Ken Erown,
Don DeLong, catcher Clarke Nelson,
utility men Mickey Holzman and
! Gotdy Calloway.
On the day after finals Stanford
will face the Chuck Dressen
piloted Oakland Oaks, and on
Monday the 22nd, they meet an
other FCL foe, the San Francisco
Seals. The Indians return to col
legiate competition the succeed
ing Wednesday against COP be
fore leaving for the South to de
fend their CIBA and PCC crowns.
The team has been strengthened
by the addition of cagers Olie Suz
j daleff, whose debut has been de
layed by sickness, George Selleck,
I and Don DeLong. Delong's first ac
i tion will probably be in the Monday
I game against San Jose.

Also there is still hope that Al
Talboy, regular right fielder, may be
declared eligible for spring quarter.

Stanford's undefeated baseballers play Fort Ord today at 3:15
and meet San Jose State tomorrow at 2:30. Both games aru at the
Sunken Diamond.
Mike Acker and Phil Page are slated to throw against the pro
laden soldiers. Last year the Indians dropped a 5-4 decision to
the same outfit, but it took a three +

run homer by Yankee pitcher Tom
Morgan in the ninth to do it.
Saturday Ray Young and Ken
Brown will,toe the rubber against
a San Jose team that is similar to
the Indians—long on pitching and
speed, but short on pow'er. The Spar
tans boast one of the Bay Area's top
pro prospects in pitcher John Old
ham, who will be in action either
tomorrow or Monday when Stanford
journeys to San Jose for a return
engagement. Game time is 2:30.
Coach I)can will stick with the
same lineup that pounded USE
hurlers for 22 hits.
After the Monday game, Stanford,
which has gone to opposite extremes,
2-1 and 2G-5, to win its first two
contests, will lay off until after
finals.
Spring vacation will be a busy pe
riod for the horsehiders as they play
five games, culminating with two
tilts in Los Angeles against UCLA

to open CIBA and PCC play. Players
who are expected to see action dur-
I ing this week aside from tomorrow's
j starters include pitchers Ray Young,
Phil Page, Mike Acker, Ken Erown,
Don DeLong, catcher Clarke Nelson,
utility men Mickey Holzman and
! Gotdy Calloway.
On the day after finals Stanford
will face the Chuck Dressen
piloted Oakland Oaks, and on
Monday the 22nd, they meet an
other FCL foe, the San Francisco
Seals. The Indians return to col
legiate competition the succeed
ing Wednesday against COP be
fore leaving for the South to de
fend their CIBA and PCC crowns.
The team has been strengthened
by the addition of cagers Olie Suz
j daleff, whose debut has been de
layed by sickness, George Selleck,
I and Don DeLong. Delong's first ac
i tion will probably be in the Monday
I game against San Jose.

Also there is still hope that Al
Talboy, regular right fielder, may be
declared eligible for spring quarter.
