## Introducing the Colorful Billy Alhouse, Stanford's Assistant Baseball Coach 
### RUSS WILKS 
About a half-dozen years ago
Ashe,vjlle met Anderson in a
crucial Tri-state League game
in Tennessee. Late in the game
Asheville started a rally when
the lead-off man doubled. The
next batter laced a hit into cen
ter field. The outfielder fielded
the ball quickly and uncorked
a near-perfect peg to the plate.
The runner from second dug
around third and charged for the
plate. The Anderson catcher moved
to the left to receive the throw.
The runner wasn't looking at the
catcher; the catcher wasn't watching
the runner; the ball arrived and
WHAM.
When the dust cleared both play
ers were out cold. The runner had
not closed the plate, nor had the
catcher made the put out. For an
instant nobody moved, then sudden
ly a contingent of Asheville players
ran out to the diamond and started
to drag their runner towards the
plate. The Anderson players re
taliated by propping the ball on
their catcher and pulling him to
ward the runner (or dragee as the
case may be). One of the Anderson
players jumped on the runner
which prevented Asheville from get
ting their man home.
The fans were in an uproar, the
umpires were perplexed ami the
game broke up at that point.
Alhouse the Culprit
The Anderson competitor who sat
on the Ashville runner was Stan
ford's assistant baseball coach, the
colorful Billy Alhouse.
Alhouse has been connected with
baseball either as player, manager,
coach, or fan ever since the stick
ball days at Rockville center, New
York. He was born and reared on
Long Lsland and became a three
sport star at Stony Brook Prep. He
won his letters as football halfback,
basketball guard and baseball
catcher.
Upon graduation the Navy grab
bed, him and put him through Ho
bart College (Geneva, N.Y.) for one
year where he bolstered the grid
and diamond squads.
Then the Navy sent him across the
country assigning him to four dif
ferent bases in two years. He man
aged to play some baseball at Grosse
Point, Mich., under Sy Perkins, old
Philadelphia Athletics catcher and
at present a Phillie coach, and at
St. Mary's Pre-flight. At St. Mary's
he came under the tutelage of the
Detroit Tigers' great second sacker
Charlie Gehringer and present lowa
U. coach Otto Vogel.
He also played with and against
Ray Scarborough, Bill Wright. Bill

Rigney, Joe Hatten and Wally West
lake to me£ion a few.
Collegiate All-Star
When the Navy no longer needed
his service Alhouse decided the
Coast was the place to stay. He
enrolled in Santa Barbara College
and in his first and only year of
baseball there he was named to the
CCAA all-star nine.
After that season he started a
brief but interesting minor league
career. He signed with Goldsbor
ough, N.C. (Coastal Plain League),
an affiliate of New Orleans, in the
summer of 1940 and finished the
season with Kingsport. He had the
rare distinction with Goldsborough
of making more assists at short
stop than any other infielder, but
he also committed the most errors.
The next season, the Brooklyn
Dodgers offered him a bonus to
sign with their Santa Barbara club.
He was still under contract to New
Orleans, however. He found a legal
loop-hole (he had signed when he
was 20 without his parents' signa
ture) and took the Dodgers' $1,500
bonus.
He played two years with Santa
Barbara and finished his schooling
at the college. The Dodgers lost in
terest, however, and let him go.
Whereupon he signed with Ander
son, S.C. (Tri-State League), moved
to Hammond, La. (Evangeline), and
managed for five weeks at Gastonia.
Called It Quits
By the end of the 1949 season the
peppery ballplayer who had been
doing more moving than an Ajax
truck decided it was time to hang
up the professional spikes. He fig
ured his "typical infielder's batting
average" of .261 and a worn out arm
would never give him the chance
to reach the majors.

He enrolled in Stanford thatlfall
to get his-Masters in Education."
helped Everett Dean in fall prac
tice, handled the freshman team in j
the spring and is now assistant coach.
Alhouse is from the school that !
believes the only way to teach
somebody something is to set the
example. He practices what he I
preaches on the diamond to the j
point of over exertion, and has been
a valuable coach for Stanford's
baseball teams.
He's a great story teller, has a
personality that leaves a lasting
good impression and has that some
thing extra which makes a person
feel good.
A Delta Tau Delta at Santa Bar
bara, he probably did more than
any member to get Stanford's chap
ter a good pledge class in the rush
ing season of 1950. He spent hour
after hour at the house relating anec
dote upon anecdote which kept
brother and rushee alike in the |
aisle.
His winning personality has made
him a permanent fixture with Floyd
Lowe Realtor for whom he has
worked four years. Last August he
set a company sales record for one
month. Out of 31 employees he is i
the fifth ranking • salesman.
The bow-tie sporting realtor mar- !
ried his Santa Barbara College I
sweetheart in 1951 and has a 1(5- j
month-old daughter.
