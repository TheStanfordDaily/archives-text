# Undefeated Card Ruggers Engage Cal Tomorrow
## 
### FRANK CANCINO 
Stanford's undefeated rugby team will meet a potent California
■jam in Stanford Stadium tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. in the spring ver
ion of the "Big Game."
The game will be a crucial contest for both clubs, because it
will decide the league leadership. Although Cal has beei\ de

jisioned once by the University of"
3ritish Columbia, it has not lost a
eague game.
In the scrum Stanford probably
ms the personnel to match the
?al linemen. However, the Cards
A/ill have to hustle in order to make
ap for their lack of height. Lack
>112 height in rugby is analogous to
hort football pass-catching ends, j
' he bears will present former loot
allers Dick Lawyer, Matt Hazel
ine, Jim Kedder, and Mike Phelun
or the Indians to contend with in
he scrum.
For once the Stanford hacklield
may be outclassed by an oppos
ing team's counterparts. Card
hacks will have to extend them
selves in order to match a Cal
hackfield which includes the phe
nomenal Max Howell.
Stanford Coach Pete Kmetovie

believes that Mux Howell, iueby
All-American, will be the big dif
ference in the game's outcome.

Admission charged for entrance
to the game will be ."JO cents for
children, 50 cents for students, and
| SO cents for general admission.

Howell will be playing his fifth sea
: son of rugby for Cal this year. He
yl o played the game in his native
J Australia.
Cal football halfbacks A 1 Talley,
Ted Granger, and Don Harris are in
the backfield. Granger has been
j the clutch performer in a couple of
j close games this season.
Last season Stanford and Cali
fornia ruggers broke even in two

meetings. The reuskins took the
first game with an upset 17 to 1(1
victory. The second game saw the
favored Bears take a decisive IS
to (S count.
The rival JV squads tangle at 4
p.m. following the varsity game.
Stanford travels to Los Angeles
to play UCLA at Spaukling Field
Saturday, March 20, and Monday,
March 22. Both games will occur at
2:30 p.m.
