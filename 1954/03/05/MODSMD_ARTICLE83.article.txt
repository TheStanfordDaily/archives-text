# Ethereal Miss Flits Through Annals of Stanford History

Shades of the Lone Woman
Rule! Here's a spiritual miss
who didn't care what mere
people thought!
A recent excursion into the files
of The Stanford Daily by script
hunting National Broadcasting
Company officials has awakened
memories of 22 years ago, when on
three separate occasions Stanford
men were visited in their rooms in
the dead of night by a tall, dark,
beautiful girl who wept when ques
tioned and fled when startled.
She acted quite strangely, said the
witnesses. She was dressed in an
evening dress. She was not a Stan
ford coed. She appeared quite oth
erworldly.
In fact, they said, she was a Ghost.
The tale is recorded in The Daily
for May 26, 1932. Seems that about
three weeks before (The Daily was
prompt then, too) an Encina base
ment resident had awakened to find
a moist - eyed lass studying him.
They had taboos in those days, too,
and the man was nervous.
He asked her to leave. She wept.
He arose to pull down the shade.
She ran from the building.
This had happened twice before,
both times in fraternities, and ac
cording to The Daily, the campus

police were baffled. A woman who
fitted the ghost's description and
who appeared to be suffering men
tal derangement was apprehended
in San Mateo —before the Encina in
cident. A girl answering the de
scription was reported from Colo
rado by a Stanford student.
But the slight cvidervce satisfied
few—Stanford had a real ghost and
the beginning of a tradition!
Unfortunately, nothing more was
heard of this tradition until two
weeks ago, when two representatives
of NBC in Hollywood visited The
Daily to look up details of the story
for a possible radio or television
script.
Those were depression days, but
Stanford still had its spirits!
