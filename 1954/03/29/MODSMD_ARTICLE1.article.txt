# Stanford Seeks New Cage Coach
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Who will be the new head coach of the Stanford basketball
team?
following Bob Burnett's unexpected resignation during finals
week, speculation as to the identity of the new head coach has
been wide and varied, and the few officials who know the answer

aren t saying.
Burnett, who coached the Indian
cagers for the past three seasons,
announced his resignation to enter
private business. Despite the fact the
team finished in the P.C.C. Southern
Division cellar the past two seasons,
both the coach and the Athletic De
partment say he was under no pres
sure to quit, and the announcement
of his intentions was apparently a
surprise to everyone.
Athletic Director Al Masters Hew
east early last week to interview
either a candidate or several candi
dates for the job, The trip was sup
posed to be a secret, but somehow
both the Associated Press and the
United Press found out about it, and
they were notoriously poor at keep
ing it quiet.
Masters was originally scheduled
to be back Friday, but his Return
Wednesday night may indicate he
reached an early agreement with
someone.
The Stanford Athletic Board is
scheduled to meet Friday, and the
official announcement of the selec
tion will probably be made right
after the meeting. Both the SAB
and the Board of Trustees need to
approve Masters' choice, which
ibey do automatically in all but
(he most unusual cases.
The official announcement of Bur
nett's resignation was made by the
Athletic Department on Monday,
March 15. Actually, Burnett had in
formed the Department of his in
tentions some time before, but it
was mutually agreed not to make
the decision public at that time.
However, when a Cow Palace or
ganization wanted to make Burnett
the head of a committee to help get
basketball back to San Francisco, it
was decided that a reason for his
declining the offer must be given,
and the resignation was announced.
The resignation was not quite as
secret as it might have been. The
first of some 50 applications the Ath
letic Department now has for the job
was received the Friday before the
announcement, was made.
Strangers who ask Masters who
(he new coach will be get only a
smile. Sportswritcrs asking the
question get a wink and a descrip
tion of his trip. Close friends of
the athletic director get a smile, a
wink, and a description. But no
one gets the answer.
However, some forecasting can be
done. Judging from the policy of
the Athletic Department, the new
coach will be a Stanford graduate.
A good percentage of the coaches
arc Farm alumni, and it is doubtful
that Masters could have reached
.such an early agreement with a non
alumnus unless all other possibilities
had been exhausted.
Burnett has been a Northern Cali
fornian all his life. He graduated
from Oakland High School in 1934, i
and attended Marin J.C. for two |
years. He came to Stanford and re
ceived his A.B. degree in 1939.
While at Stanford he was a sub
stitute on the famed Hank Luisctti
squad, and lettered the following!
year on Coach Everett Dean's team, j
He also played one season on the j
Indian baseball team.
lie was assistant varsity coach
under Dean in HMO, and in IJMI
was the freshman mentor and in- j
tramural director. In 1911, a year j
before he entered the Navy, Bur
nett replaced Lee at Utah State, 1
and was named "Coach of the j
Year" in the Big Seven Conference
by sportswritcrs.
After serving as a naval officer
until 1945, he returned to Stanford
and was assistant basketball coach
and freshman baseball coach until I
1951, when he replaced Dean at the!
Varsity helm.
His 1951-52 team, led by Jim Ham
stead, Ed Tucker, and Jim Walsh,
lied for second in the Southern Di
vision with a 19-9 mark. The follow

ing season the record was 7-20.
Hampered by a number of key in
juries, this year's team posted a 15-
10 mark.
If there was no pressure on Bur
nett, then why did he quit? His
reasons, though personal, arc no
secret. Basically, they arc three:
(1) Salary. As perhaps every
body knows, no one pets rich
working for Stanford. Besides
being underpaid, (here was little
chance of Burnett ever getting a
substantial raise regardless of how
the team did. During his spare
time last summer the coach did a
little real estate business and
found it quite profitable. Being
only 39 years old, he probably
feels there is more opportunity for
him in that field than in coaching
at Stanford.
(2) Increasing responsibility. Bur
nett's wife has just returned home
from the hospital where she had
their second child. He no doubt felt
that with more mouths to feed, if he
was going to make a switch the time
to do it was now.
(3) Material. No coach likes to
lose, particularly league games.
And with all of the other three
schools in the division having
lower entrance requirements, larg
er proselyting programs, and more
scholarships for athletes, Burnett
saw little hope for the future. Es
specially so with the tuition rising
rapidly and the hopes for a new
Pavilion falling equally fast.
However, the coach doesn't blame
Stanford for this. "I wouldn't have
it any other way," he says, "than to
have athletes treated on the same
level with other students. And the
fact that our scholastic level is high
er than at other schools is something
to be proud of."
Burnett's contract expires in Au
gust, and he may remain here until
that time, when the new coach will
take over. With the league's two
leading scorers returning from this
season, the new coach will not ex
actly be starting from scratch.
