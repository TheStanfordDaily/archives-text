BOMB WITHOUT A BANG—Police Chief George Potter points
to a "time bomb" in the Village Christian Science Church in
Menlo Park. The device was rigged up by three Stanford stu
dents as a practical joke. The church was evacuated the Sunday
morning of finals week when the "bomb" was found. The three
students were suspended for a quarter as a result of the prank.
