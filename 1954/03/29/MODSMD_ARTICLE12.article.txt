# Eight Trustees Added to Board
## 
### 
Stanford's request to increase the
size of its Board of Trustees from
15 to 23 members was approved this
month in a decree handed clown by
Superior Judge W. W. Jacka of
Santa Clara County.
Judge Jacka said the increase was
justified because of the "tremendous
growth of the University since the
founding grant."
He decreed that, 20 members on
the board shall be "regular" mem
bers with 10-year terms and the re
maining three shall be "alumni
trustees" with five-year terms.
Stanford's application for court
approval of the increase was taken
under advisement after a hearing
held March 12.
In bis riecrcc Judge Jacks sai<l
the "work load and responsibility
of the trustees have been in
creased to such a degree that they
arc far beyond the original think
ing of the grantors."
The judge added:
"Efficient supervision of the ac
tivities of the University requires
and dictates an expansion of the
number of trustees."
Paid C.' Edwards, former presi
dent and emeritus member of the
Board of Trustees, testified at (tie
bearing.
He said trustees now must serve
on as many as five committees al a
time and devote three full days a
week to their duties.
He said that Dartmouth's 12-man
board is the only one smaller than
Stanford's.
