Some time today we'll sign our names on
19 dotted lines, and then it'll be official. The
beginning of Spring Quarter, 1954.
During the next two and a half months we'll
be swimming at Lake Lag on weekdays and
Santa Cruz Sundays, holding classes on the
lawn, and moaning whenever it rains.
Spring Quarter, 1954. Excom will be evalu
ating the Honor Code; with our help formulat
ing an interpretation of the Code that can clear
up the present confusion. Another Excom com
mittee will be trying to make sense out of the
ambiguous ASSU by-laws.
Spring Quarter, 1954. For lots of us it'll be
a political quarter. We'll be voting for student
government officers for next year. We'll be
watching the preliminaries to June's primary
elections for GOP and Democratic candidates
to state and national posts. We'll meet candi

when they come to Stanford for Political Union
meetings.

Spring Quarter, 1954. In the Central Pacific,
the Atomic Energy Commission will explode a
hydrogen bomb, and at Stanford the term "ci
vilian defense" will take on new meaning. In
Geneva Western diplomats will meet with
representatives from Russia and Communist
China to seek a solution lor the Far Eastern
dilemma, and at Stanford men facing military
service will take a personal interest in the out
come of these talks. In Washington Joe Mc-
Carthy and the Army will air their dispute be
fore a Senate committee, and at Stanford stu
dents and professors will wonder about the
threat of McCarthyism to academic freedom.
Like every other quarter we can remember,
Spring Quarter, 1954, will bring crucial turning
points in our lives and in world history. So, as
we tell our friends, "Spring is here," and stake
out comfortable spots on the library lawn, we
wonder again, as we always do:
What will it be like? Spring Quarter. 1954.
