# Campus May Get Adult Study Site
## 
### 
Stanford officials are continuing
negotiations with the Ford Founda
tion to establish its $3.5 million ad
ult study center on campus, a Uni
versity spokesman reported last
night.
Probable site for the center is the
historic 25 - room Lathrop home
overlooking Lake Lagunita. Ac
cording to the latest report received
by the Palo Alto Times, the Founda
tion may decide to build its own
study center here, in which case the
Lathrop home presumably will be
razed.
No official comment has been
made by either Stanford or Founda
tion officials.
Representatives of the Ford
Foundation toured the campus
last August during their search
for a Bay Area location. Last
week a sourcc close to the Foun
dation, who declined to be quoted
by name, said all Bay Area sites
have been discarded in favor of a
spot "on a hill west of Palo Alto."
The Lathrop home has been va
cant since it was turned over to the
University in 1951. Built before
1900, the Victorian mansion was
known as Alta Vista when it was
the home of Mr. and Mrs. Charles G.
Lathrop, brother-in-law and sister
of Senator and Mrs. Lcland Stan
ford.
