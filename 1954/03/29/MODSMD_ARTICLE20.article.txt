# A 						Justified Change
## 
### 
During finals week a significant and neces
sary change was made in the administrative
structure of Stanford University—the number
of members of the Board of Trustees was in
creased from 15 to 23.
The increase, a revision of the founding
grant, required approval from the Santa Clara
County Superior Court. In ruling that the in
crease was justified by the "tremendous
growth of the University since the founding
grant," Superior Judge W. W. Jacka said:
"Efficient supervision of the activities of the
University requires and dictates an expansion
of the number of trustees."
The increase is significant in that it clearly
represents the general expansion of the Uni
versity itself. Land development plans, pro
grams for research, and changes and additions

in teaching facilities have substantially in
creased the activities and operations of the
University. It is obvious from those develop
ments that Stanford is growing as a University
and a business.
The increase is necessary because of that
growth. In recent years members of the Board
have found themselves almost overwhelmed
by the work of supervising a growing Stanford.
As the activities of the University have in
creased, so have the responsibilities and duties
of Board members.
We agree with the University's decision and
the Superior Court's ruling that the increase in
number of Board members is necessary and
justified. That change is an acknowledgment
of Stanford's expansion—and a step toward
greater efficiency.
