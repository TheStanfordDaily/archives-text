# PRIVATE LIFE

### LARRY CAHN 
If you are lucky enough to land in an army school
after completing basic, ymir moans and groans will
turn to thoughts that perhaps the army isn't so bad
after all.
The few who do make army school find the schools
well manned, and well tauiiht. Classes are small,
and the most is made and expected of the individual's

intelligence.
1 often imagine myself back on
iho Farm, except when I am aware
that the students are all males,
and the Quad clothes are all kha
ki. But binders under the arm,
practical labs, and tests all re
flect college days.
In an army school the import
ant thing is to learn what you're
being sent to school to learn,
whether it be auto mechanics,

supply techniques, duties oi' a clerk-typist or any
other of the 500 schools offered by the army. Troops
are left pretty much to themselves while ofT duty.
Ami the duty day ends at 4.TJO.
Tests are objective, and usually come once a week.
Instructors are well educated, good speakers, and
mostly able to hold the class's interest even though
the material is at times dull.

The particular school I am in, Clerk-Typist, has
an almost unbelievable number of college students
in it. Of the 23 students in this class, there are three
from Stanford (Bob Gibson '50, Gary Hollander '53,
and me) and men from Wisconsin, Minnesota, lowa,
Pensylvania, California, UCLA, USC, Washington,
South Dakota, Kansas, Idaho, and a few smaller
schools.
The bull sessions are highly fascinating, and more
often than not, educational. This is inevitable when
such a diversified group of men is placed in a single
barracks where they eat, study, and relax together.
When the soldier completes an army school, he is
considered a specialist in his field, and through the
remainder of his army career will do what the army
has taught him to do.
Most of the men coming out of a specialist school
will get a better deal than the man stuck in the in
fantry as a rifleman. On the other hand, a rifleman
may be shipped with his company to Germany, Spain,
or the Far East; while a clerk-typist may be stuck
behind a desk for two years somewhere in some for
gotten post in the States.
A.s for me, I would take my chances with a type
writer any day, as they call it being "Chairborn" or
one of "Remington's Raiders."
