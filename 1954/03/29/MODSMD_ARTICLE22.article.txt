# CAMPUS OPINION
## The 						Real Menace 
### 
To the Editor:
In the final issue of winter quarter Ihere appeared a
letter by John Olson on one of the most controversial
subjects in modern American history: McCarthy ism.
The letter was sincere and suggests the very same
pseudo-logic which appears so sound to so many:
Communism is bad, McCarthy fights communism,
ergo McCarthy is good. There are millions of sin
cere honest Americans who go along with this.
We have heard too often this apology for the man
and his tactics. Nevertheless, the question always
confronts us, how shall we cleanse ourselves of com
munism in our Shall we invoke a ruthless
purge, plough through the patient to attack the can
cer?
Yes, argue the apologists, for these are crucial
times and our democratic way of life for all future
times hangs in the balance. If a few innocent heads
roll in the battle to ferret out the Communists, is
not the final victory worth this small price? In war,
tor example, do we not consider innocent human lives
as necessary payment in gaining a net decisive vic
tory'.' Have we not in the past even temporarily
traded democracy for military efficiency in a life
and-death struggle against democracy's enemies?
What then is the special twist which makes McCar
thyism a menace rivalling communism itself? To
answer, we would have to ask just whose innocent
heads have been rolling in this fraud that calls itself
a crusade against communism. The army officer who
fails to check the political opinions of all his sub

ordinates? The laborer whose brother-in-law reads
the Daily Worker? The nuclear physicist who likes
Paul Robeson records? Where does it end? It does
not! For each of us, you Mr. Olson, and I, have al
ready been victimized by this deception.
It has caused our country to be weakened morally,
politically, and even militarily at a time when
strength and leadership are essential in combatting
communism. We are regarded with contempt by our
allies who must observe the spectacle of a man
marching up and down this country, drunk with
power, surrounded by a huge following of "sincere
honest Americans," portentously ranting against com
munism, as Hitler did, but in reality fostering his own
political ambitions. We are called hypocrites by the
neutral countries, whose aid we need in the world
conflict against communism, by advertising democ
racy abroad while stifling it at home. Finally, the
ruthless purge, lacking restraint and wisdom, has
permeated so deeply into our society, that it has all
but replaced communism as the seed of our own cor
ruption. Can the police state of Orwell's 1984 be far
away when even now a man may fear economic and
social reprisals for cherishing an opinion (perhaps
even decades ago) which does not happen to coincide
v/ith that of Joseph McCarthy and his friends?
If a purge be needed, then we would have to purge
the demagogues, the warped thinkers, the rumor
mongers, along with the Communists, for one is as
perverse as the other.
