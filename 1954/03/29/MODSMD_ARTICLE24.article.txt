# Menlo Park Church Bomb Hoax Brings Suspension for Three Stanford Men
## 
### 
Three Stanford students have j
been suspended for spring quarter
by Men's Council for Dlacing a fake j
bomb at the First Christian Science
Church in Menlo Park, near Stan- I
lord Village.
r J he students are Thomas R. i
Weide, 22, a physics graduate stu- |
dent ; Charles M. Williams, 22, a J
psychology graduate student; and
Stuart Hanish, 22, a senior student;
in electrical engineering.
The bomb was discovered in
the church at 10:55 a.m. the Sun
day morning of finals week, and |
was thought to be an explosive
bomb. Actually, according to the
students involved, it was slip- I

posed to cut oIT the power of the
church organ.
The bomb was found by Hugo
Senn, ol Menlo Park, who walked
into the church boiler room and
J heard a strange ticking noise. He
j discovered it was coming, from a
| plain white candy box about 12
j inches square. It was attached to
i the wall, and wires leading from
the box were connected to a switch
box on the other side ol the wall.
Connected to the switch was a set
j mouse trap, apparently giving a
i double detonator.
The people already in the church
j were evacuated, and later Sunday
| school pupils from a nearby room

were removed to a lawn some dis
tance away.
Though the object was meant as
a "small practical joke," the subse
quent call of Senn brought out the
entire Menlo Park police force—
regular and reserve, the Village po
lice force, the. Menlo Park fire de
partment, and several Stanford of
ficials.
Menlo Park Police Chief George
Potter had the master power switch
leading to the church pulled, and
the ticking stopped. He then put in
a call to the Presidio in San Fran
cisco, which sent bomb disposal ex
pert Major Forrest Spiva down by
helicopter.
Major Spiva is the expert who
was called when a bomb was dis
covered at the freshman bonfire
shortly before the Big Game last
fall.
He arrived about 1 p.m. in a heli
copter which landed on a nearby
field. A large crowd of onlookers
was moved away from the church
when Spiva entered to examine the
object.
Spiva snipped the wires and
gingerly carried the "bomb" to the
helicopter, in which he took it
back to the Presidio for examina
tion. It was announced soon after
that the box contained a tangle
of wires, electronic devices, and
a red electric bulb hooked up to
flash on and off. There were no
explosives.
The police department received a
tip that the hoax involved "some
one named Torn," and Potter and
Inspector William R. Kieler pored
over the University roster. They
discovered that Thomas Weide was
among those who lived near the
church in the Village during autumn
quarter, and he admitted the fol
lowing Tuesday having participated
in the affair.
The Council voted to suspend the
three until summer quarter. The
five-member council, before hand
ing down the decision, heard testi
mony until almost midnight one
evening last week.

evening last week.
Three Stanford students have j
been suspended for spring quarter
by Men's Council for Dlacing a fake j
bomb at the First Christian Science
Church in Menlo Park, near Stan- I
lord Village.
r J he students are Thomas R. i
Weide, 22, a physics graduate stu- |
dent ; Charles M. Williams, 22, a J
psychology graduate student; and
Stuart Hanish, 22, a senior student;
in electrical engineering.
The bomb was discovered in
the church at 10:55 a.m. the Sun
day morning of finals week, and |
was thought to be an explosive
bomb. Actually, according to the
students involved, it was slip- I

posed to cut oIT the power of the
church organ.
The bomb was found by Hugo
Senn, ol Menlo Park, who walked
into the church boiler room and
J heard a strange ticking noise. He
j discovered it was coming, from a
| plain white candy box about 12
j inches square. It was attached to
i the wall, and wires leading from
the box were connected to a switch
box on the other side ol the wall.
Connected to the switch was a set
j mouse trap, apparently giving a
i double detonator.
The people already in the church
j were evacuated, and later Sunday
| school pupils from a nearby room

were removed to a lawn some dis
tance away.
Though the object was meant as
a "small practical joke," the subse
quent call of Senn brought out the
entire Menlo Park police force—
regular and reserve, the Village po
lice force, the. Menlo Park fire de
partment, and several Stanford of
ficials.
Menlo Park Police Chief George
Potter had the master power switch
leading to the church pulled, and
the ticking stopped. He then put in
a call to the Presidio in San Fran
cisco, which sent bomb disposal ex
pert Major Forrest Spiva down by
helicopter.
Major Spiva is the expert who
was called when a bomb was dis
covered at the freshman bonfire
shortly before the Big Game last
fall.
He arrived about 1 p.m. in a heli
copter which landed on a nearby
field. A large crowd of onlookers
was moved away from the church
when Spiva entered to examine the
object.
Spiva snipped the wires and
gingerly carried the "bomb" to the
helicopter, in which he took it
back to the Presidio for examina
tion. It was announced soon after
that the box contained a tangle
of wires, electronic devices, and
a red electric bulb hooked up to
flash on and off. There were no
explosives.
The police department received a
tip that the hoax involved "some
one named Torn," and Potter and
Inspector William R. Kieler pored
over the University roster. They
discovered that Thomas Weide was
among those who lived near the
church in the Village during autumn
quarter, and he admitted the fol
lowing Tuesday having participated
in the affair.
The Council voted to suspend the
three until summer quarter. The
five-member council, before hand
ing down the decision, heard testi
mony until almost midnight one
evening last week.
