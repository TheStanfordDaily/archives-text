# Nine Tops Bruins in League Play
## 
### 
With the echoes of "this team doesn't have the power of the j
1953 club" still clear in its ears, the Stanford baseballers turned
to a new mechanismâ€”pitching.
This factor combined with adequate hitting Friday and an over
abundance of power Saturday got the Cards off to a successful

CIBA start as they bounced UCLA <
twice, 4-2 and 4-1, at Joe E. Brown
Field.
Sophomore Ray Young and south
paw Phil Page completely shackled
the Bruins' batters, while A 1 Talboy
broke out of a mild hitting slump
with five hits in seven trips, includ
ing a pair of doubles, to pace the
Card stickers.
Friday Young proved that Ever
ett Dean had made a wise choice in
nominating him for the league's
opener as UCLA collected only six
hits, two after the fourth inning. !
Young was the master as he nailed

down 12 strikeouts, one less than he
fashioned in a freshman game last
season. Three fielding miscues, one
by himself, gave UCLA two un
earned runs.
The Cards hunched three hits
in the sixth to come from behind
and take a 3-2 lead, adding a final
tally in the ninth. Tulboy, who is
the CIBA's leading hatter at .714,
drove across two rurils with a
double and a single. Sid Hall and
Leu Swart/ batted in the other
tallies.
Young and Tom Dandurand
struck extra base blows with the
former tripling and the latter doub
ling. Both scored.
Saturday Page had a shaky first
inning, giving up a lone tally, but
he settled down to pitch shutout
ball the rest of the way. He faced
34 men during the contest, striking
out two and passing four.
The Indians had to come from
behind, tying the game in the
third on triple and
(Goodrich's single. The Cards went
ahead as Su/dalefT grounded out
to score Talhoy, who had singled.
Dandurand brought home two
more in the ninth with a booming
double. The big third sacker has
now doubled in each of his last four
games.
The Cards jumped on Tom
O'Donnell for 13 hits, including
three by Talboy. Every Indian con
nected for at least one hit, except
for Sid Hall. Len Swartz and Bob
Evans each had a pair of singles.
Stanford is now 2-0 in CIBA
play and 6-3 on the season.

USC also took its first two league
encounters against Santa Clara, 6-1,
(5-4, to tie the Indians for the lead
ership. Cal was idle over the week
end.
The Trojans meet Stanford in a
Sunken Diamond doubleheader Sat
urday and UCLA plays a single
game here Friday.
