# Cards 2, Fort Ord 5
## 
### 
The Indians stayed with Fort Ord
for nine innings on March 5, but a
three-run 300-foot homer by ex-
Denver star Bill Pinckard gave the
soldiers a ten-inning 5-2 victory on
the Stanford Diamond.
Stanford grabbed a one-run lead
in the third as Hall tripled and
scored on Scramaglia's single. Ord
knotted the score when J. W. Porter
got the first of three singles, moved
to third on an error, and scored on
an infield out.
It was Hall who put the Cards
ahead again in the seventh as he
doubled home Len Swart?, but two
walks and a hit off Page got the
visitors even and then Pinckard
connected.
Acker started on the hill and
yielded a run and five hits in five
innings. Page went the rest of the
way.
