Returning to competition after a
week of finals, the Card nine was
greeted by a 17-hit barrage off the
bats of the San Francisco Seals at
the Sunken Diamond. The "Little
Corporation" players leveled the In
dians 8-1, allowing only four hits.
The Seals' first-stringers jumped
upon starting hurler Young for sev
en runs and 13 hits in the first five
innings. Page was impressive in the
last four, being scored upon with
two out in the ninth.
The Seals picked up two in the
first, four in the sixth, one in the
fifth and ninth. Frank Kalin con
tributed the big blow of the contest,
poking a three-run homer over the
360-foot fence in left field.
Stanford got its only run in the
seventh when Tom Dandurand
doubled off the left field bank, went
to third on George Selleck's infield
single, and scored on Len Swartz'
outfield fly.
