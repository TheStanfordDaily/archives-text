Chuck Essegian accompanied the
Sacramento Solons '"B" team to the

the damage. The Indians beat them
selves as 11 walks, an error, and a
blooping single gave the visitors a
0-2 victory.

foot by scoring two runs in' their
first at bat. With one out Scrama
glia singled, stole second, and scored

error, and three walks off losing
hurler Don DeLong in the seventh
