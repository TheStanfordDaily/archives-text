# Rapid Action Expected On Shopping Site Leases
## 
### 
Other businss firms are expected to follow quickly the example
of the Emporium department store in San Francisco and sign
leases for store space in Stanford's proposed multi-million dollar
shopping center, Aif Brandin, Universfty land development of
ficer, reported yesterday.
Discussing the time schedule of development lor the huge cen-

ter, Brand in said ho expects
tiations for leases for all available ;
space to be wrapped up within DO
days.
Construction of the center, be
said, should Ret under way, "hs soon
as is possible—probably within (iO
days." Cost, he estimated, would
range in "excess of $10 million."
Brandin, who has been .spear
heading planning for such a busi
ness development for several years,
said that applications for leases in
the center have far outreached ca
pacity, and intimated that Univer
sity officials arc already thinking in
terms of a large addition to the
center now only nearing construc
tion.
The lease willi the Emporium,
signed last Monday, provides for
the construction of (he largest I
store in the long-planned center.
The branch department store, to
be called "The Emporium Stan
ford," will cover about 175,000
square feet and will cost $.'5.5 mil- j
lion. The center itself will occupy j
an area of about 317,000 square
feet.
Aside from the Emporium, other I
big-natne stores that are expected to
settle in the center include I. Mag
nin & Co. and Roos Bros. The cen
ter will also house a host of spe
cialty shops — these include such
businesses as women's apparel
shops, a shoe shop, a jewelry store—
plus a super-market, a super drug
store, and two banks.
The University itself will be di
rectly responsible for the construc
tion of only half of the center—
about 2fi0,000 square feet in all. The
major lessees, such as the Empo- |
rium and Roos Bros., will pay out- J
right for the building of their units |
in the project.
All building will be done, accord
ing to the land development officer,
in strict compliance with plans and *
specifications laid down by the Uni- |
versify and its planning firm, Wen- \
dell Beckett Co. The plans call for
a low-lying building shaped roughly
like a giant letter "T." The Empo- !
rium branch store will form the ;
cross bar to the building.
The center will be located off El
Camino in a sweeping 62-acrc plot 1
between the Palo Alto Hospital and
Snn Francisquito Creek. Provision
will be made for the parking of
about 3,. r )00 vehicles.
Though exact details of (he lease
with the Emporium are a lightly
guarded secret. Hrandin did say !
thai the lease negotiated runs for
.10 years and provides for a guar
anteed minimum annual rent to i
the University, plus an escalating
percentage return from Ho- store's
gross yearly income.
All leases, though they will v;irv ,

♦
considerably in length of time and
j amount, will be based on a similar
j formula, with the University get
] ting a percentage of a firm's profits
i over a specified point.
As to the possible overall profit to !
the University from the center I
when it is in full swing, Brandin J
merely sidestepped a bit., saying, |
"Stanford will gel a fair rate of I
return on its investment."
Referring to the flood of requests !
for space in the development, Bran- j
j din said, "We have had many more j
I applicants than we have space."
And with an eye cricked opti
mistically to the future, he added, j
I "We've allowed for more units to I
be added to the area. The region j
is going to continue growing, and ;
we would be silly if we »lidn't
provide for it." No plans as yet
have been drawn up for additions,
he said.
One of the provisions of the lease |
with the Emporium, Brandin said, j
| was that a second large department 1
store be allowed to settle in the j
I center when it is enlarged.
At the same time that construc- j
| tion booms into full throttle, the
University, aided by Santa Clara j
| County and the state, will under- |
j take a major road - building pro- !
{ gram. Included in this project is the I
proposed laying of a roadway from ,
i Sandhill Road through the golf I
; course to the west, side of the center, j
i Another roadway will be built from I
i the center past the Convalescent I
I Home and thence across Palm Drive |
I to Embarcadcro Road near the Sta- i
dium.
