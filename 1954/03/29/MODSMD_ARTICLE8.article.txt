# SRI Hopes To Maintain Village Site
## 
### 
Stanford Research Institute direc
tors and Menlo Park officials are
waiting for official confirmation of
tentative plans to sell the Stanford
Village, 85 acres owned by the Unit
ed States government. The SRI di
rectors decided to remain in the
Village at least temporarily at their
annual meeting Friday.
Several months ago reports were
received that the federal govern
ment would not sell Stanford Vil
lage for less than the current mar
ket value of the land, estimated at
$15,000 to $24,000 an acre. The In
stitute felt it could not afford to pay
' such a price for the land it occu-
J pies, and tentatively planned to
move to a campus site.
Since then, the government has
agreed to negotiate the sale of Stan
ford Village through a lease-pur
chase arrangement with Menlo Park.
City officials hope to buy the land
at somewhere near the original
cost of about $1,000 an acre. Menlo
Park officials will then try to work
out an agreement with the federal
government so that the Institute
can remain in the Village perma
nently. •
Stanford officials have stated
that the tentative agreement to
sell the property to Menlo Park
would be satisfactory to the Uni
versity. Stanford Business Man
ager Alf E. Brandin said. "Stan
ford's interest in the Village is for
student housing." and that even if
Stanford bought the land it would
turn it over to Menlo Park at
cost when the housing need no
longer existed.
If Menlo Park does succeed in
buying teh property the Menlo Park
Elementary School District super
intendent said that the district, will
I probably obtain a badly needed
i school site in the Village.
Menlo Park will probably nego
tiate directly with a subsidiary
group of the Housing and Home Fi
nance Agency, the public housing
administration, in San Francisco.
The tentative agreement, still
! awaiting official confirmation, was
i reached over three weeks ago fol
j lowing a trip to Washington by
