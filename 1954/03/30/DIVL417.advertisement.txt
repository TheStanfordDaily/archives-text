"Chrome Clad" STEEL TAPES
are preferred by engineers
When you go out on the job, you want the most durable steel
measuring tapes you can get — Lufkin "Chrome Clad." The
jet black markings won't wear off, for they are bonded to
k ihe line and protected by multiple electroplatings that further
build up the fine tape steel from which the line is made. The
.resulting line is heavier, stronger, and most rust and corrosion
resistant. It is easier to read, easiest to clean, and won't sur
face crack, chip, or peel. Only Lufkin tapes are available with
Chrome Clad,
