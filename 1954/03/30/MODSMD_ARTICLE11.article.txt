### 
CAIRO, March (UP) â€” Presi
dent Premier Mohammed Naguib
lost his li' ht to turn dissension-torn
Egypt over to civilian rule today.
But. in a day marked by Naguib's
own physical collapse, rioting in
which two persons were killed and
two injured, and strange compro
mises inside Egypt's ruling military j
junta, Naguib kept all his posts as I
pre ident. premier, and president ol
the Revolutionary Command Coun
cil.
A joint 'meeting of the Revolu
tionary Council and the civilian '
e.ibinet decided oil the about-face!
which canceled Naguib's announce- j
ment of last Thursday that the |
country would be turned back to ei
vilian politicians.
Vice-Premier Abdel Gamal Nas- |
ser, Naguib's principal opponent in j
the recent government crisis, an- !
iiounceil that censorship will again
l>e imposed on newspapers.
ft was a triumph for Vice-Premier |
Nasser, who opposed the speedy }
dissolution ol the military group on J
the grounds that corrupt politicians
might regain power.
Naguib agreed to the reversal as
three days ol street demonstrations
and labor strikes were climated in
the fatal riot.
