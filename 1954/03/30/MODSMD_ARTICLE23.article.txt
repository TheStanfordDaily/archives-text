# Schwable and Brainwashing
## 
### 
A nov/ word has been added to the American
vocabulary since Korea—brainwashing. To
I he prisoners of war who suffered slow mental
and physical torture from the Chinese Commu
nists, it recalls dank cells and freezing nights,
unspeakable filth and freezing demoralization.
To those of us who know no mental strain
worse than a four-hour final and no physical
lesl more severe than a mountain climb, brain
washing poses an unusual problem in evalua
tion.
The most vivid example of what subtle tor
ture can do to degrade a man of proven charac
ter and stamina is illustrated by Colonel Frank
Schwable, currently facing courtmartial for
confessing to germ warfare charges.
Colonel Schwable had had experience as a
Marine aviator in World War II and was con
sidered ihe Marine Corps' foremost expert on
the nic/hl operation of fighter planes when he
was shot down over enemy territory in Korea
in fnly, 1052.
I.alri, having been subjected to continuous
brainwashing, he confessed to Communist
accusations of germ warfare — a statement
whi' h Andrei Vishinsky read before the
United Nations in March, 1953.
Obviously Colonel Schwable lied outright
when he wrote his "confession." He admits
that lie lied and that he knew he was dishonest
at the lime.

According to Marine Corps and military dis
cipline this needs no evaluation. The officer
was guilty of giving false information to the
enemy which was used against this country,
and he should be dishonorably discharged,
perhaps courtmartialed.
But* the solution isn't that simple and the
answer isn't found in any code of military regu
lations. For the man who broke down under
relentless Red tactics was sick, confused, and
alone. He was a man without his own mind.
Other Korean POW's have come to his de
fense, including Major General William F.
Dean, who has testified he would never again
go to war without a suicide pill as protection
against capture.
To us, it seems that the words of men like
Dean and the descriptions of misery and
horror told by Schwable should be enough
to convince the court — and the American
people—that the aviator has already paid for
any wrongs he committed due to "weak
ness."
We would like to see Colonel Schwable'a
latest ordeal come to a speedy end, with the
verdict that he was not responsible for what
he did while brainwashed. We would like to
see him receive the prestige of an honorable
discharge from the Marine Corps and return
to the rest and comfort of civilian life which he
so definitely deserves.

lations. For the man who broke down under
relentless Red tactics was sick, confused, and
alone. He was a man without his own mind.
Other Korean POW's have come to his de
fense, including Major General William F.
Dean, who has testified he would never again
go to war without a suicide pill as protection
against capture.
To us, it seems that the words of men like
Dean and the descriptions of misery and
horror told by Schwable should be enough
to convince the court — and the American
people—that the aviator has already paid for
any wrongs he committed due to "weak
ness."
We would like to see Colonel Schwable'a
latest ordeal come to a speedy end, with the
verdict that he was not responsible for what
he did while brainwashed. We would like to
see him receive the prestige of an honorable
discharge from the Marine Corps and return
to the rest and comfort of civilian life which he
so definitely deserves.
A nov/ word has been added to the American
vocabulary since Korea—brainwashing. To
I he prisoners of war who suffered slow mental
and physical torture from the Chinese Commu
nists, it recalls dank cells and freezing nights,
unspeakable filth and freezing demoralization.
To those of us who know no mental strain
worse than a four-hour final and no physical
lesl more severe than a mountain climb, brain
washing poses an unusual problem in evalua
tion.
The most vivid example of what subtle tor
ture can do to degrade a man of proven charac
ter and stamina is illustrated by Colonel Frank
Schwable, currently facing courtmartial for
confessing to germ warfare charges.
Colonel Schwable had had experience as a
Marine aviator in World War II and was con
sidered ihe Marine Corps' foremost expert on
the nic/hl operation of fighter planes when he
was shot down over enemy territory in Korea
in fnly, 1052.
I.alri, having been subjected to continuous
brainwashing, he confessed to Communist
accusations of germ warfare — a statement
whi' h Andrei Vishinsky read before the
United Nations in March, 1953.
Obviously Colonel Schwable lied outright
when he wrote his "confession." He admits
that lie lied and that he knew he was dishonest
at the lime.

According to Marine Corps and military dis
cipline this needs no evaluation. The officer
was guilty of giving false information to the
enemy which was used against this country,
and he should be dishonorably discharged,
perhaps courtmartialed.
But* the solution isn't that simple and the
answer isn't found in any code of military regu
lations. For the man who broke down under
relentless Red tactics was sick, confused, and
alone. He was a man without his own mind.
