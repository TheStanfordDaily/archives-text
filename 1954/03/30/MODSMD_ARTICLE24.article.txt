### PETE GROTHE 
IT'S SrßlNti. BY GOSH
I pok hod off the last few bars of Mendelsohn's
Sprint' Son,", and walked into the reserved book room
yesterday In pay a $2.50 fine for a $.10 pamphlet
which I took out for a few hours too long. The RBR.
wa. in k empty, except for a lone studier who was
■-itting in the second scat behind a fortress of books,
ll was my old acquaintance, Horace.
"Horace," i heseeched. "Do you realize what today

is? This is Reg Day of spring
quarter. N<> one ever studies in
.••print; quarter, much less on Reg
Day of spring quarter."
"I do," Horace said coldly, look
ing like someone had just twisted
a knife in his left kidney.
"I'll have you know," Horace
continued, "that I do my best
tu'lying m spring quarter. I like
In rai e !he average."
"(Josh," I go.lied. "Horace, this

i spring quarter. This is when the grade average is
lou'i r than a McCarthy smear. When the lawn in
front of the Main Libe is more crowded than a Bryan
C.tvr" lecture. Atul when more money i.s put into the
I ill it T? >sotti's than Jack Benny spent on .Joan's wed
ding."
"Knowledge," Horace shot back, "is the only in
slrum' nt of production that is not subject to dimin
ishinu returns."
Fueling ofT nausea, I said, "Yes, Horace, knowl
edge is nice, but this is spring quarter. Don't you

ever think about taking your girl to the ('actus Gar
dens for a kiss?"
"A kiss," Horace returned, "is merely Ihe juxta
position of two orbicularis oris muscles in a state
of contraction."
"Lissen," I said, knocking overall assistant librarian
and a girl with a Sun Valley tan with a sweep of my
arms. "Spring is when girls look like girls should
look. When men break out with blue denims and
Hawaiian shirts the color of a three-day-old bruise.
And when Stanford gardeners lean on I heir rakes and
think nostalgic thoughts about when they were
young."
"Yes," said Horace, "but it's raining."
"Oh, that'll blow over in a day or two," I allowed.
"Because spring is more popular than Joe DiMaggio's
wife. When sports loving Stanfords troop out on
Saturdays to watch Jack Weiershauser's Iracksters
and Everett Dean's baseballers. And when Ihc gang
out at L'Ommies is higher than Russ Lawler on
stilts.
"When the crowd in fronl of the Cellar is livelier
than one of Ram's Head's extroverted parties. When
Lake Lag beckons its cool fingers on a hot. day. And
when 4 p.m. classes arc more vacant than the Western
Civ libe on Big Game day."
"That does it!" yefled Horace, throwing down his
volumes. "This is spring quarter! You've convinced
me! I'm off to Rosotti'.s!"
I put the $2.50 back in my pocket, lore up my leg
book, and hurried off to the Cellar.
By gosh, it's spring.
