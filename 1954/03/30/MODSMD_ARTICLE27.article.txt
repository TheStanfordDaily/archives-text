To the Editor:
In reading over some Dailies
which I recently received, 1 found
my past staring me in the lace in
the guise of a letter from Jim Thorpe
which appeared in the Feb. 11 Cam -
pus Opinion. Quoth Mr. Thorpe
quoting me: "What will happen if
Eisenhower is elected? A new ad
ministration, a Republican admin
istration, will be in power. McCar
thy will have to tone down his at -
tacks and he will have to lit his at
titudes to those of the Republic;in
administration. ... If the Repub
licans are elected, McCarthy will
have a superior — Dwight, Eisen
hower." And that's quite right,
that's what I firmly believed.
This is to publicly announce that
1 have learned, as is well known,
how disturbingly fallacious thai log
ic was. But I might report that I
was not alone in my pre-election
fallacies. As reported in the New
York Times' Week in Review sec
lion, MarCh 11, "The Washington
Post, recalling that it had expressed
the belief that, 'MeCarthyism would
disappear overnight if Eisenhower
were elected,' said that it had 'wait
ed some 400 nights for the President
to exert the kind of leadership that
would bring that happy result.'"

However, in reading Mr. Thorpe's
letter, 1 noticed that he was rebuk
j iir , The Daily for its editorial sug
gestion to go hear McCarthy to
le. rn what kind of man this is who
now appears to the world as the
supreme power in the United States.
Here I must agree with The Daily
and disagree with "partisan Demo
crat" Thorpe, for disagreement with
McCarthy is no excuse for not mak
ing some attempt to understand him
and understand why he has the ap
peal he rloes.
We who disapprove of Joe McCar
thy should not put, our heads in the
and, any more than we can afford
to fight Communism by avoiding
learnitig about the principles of
Communism and the intolerable
methods used to propagate those
principles. It is our responsibility to
study the man McCarthy and his
ideas and attack this problem with
tin fullest understanding possible.
Then we should express ourselves to
the individuals who are the only
true superiors of McCarthy—collec
tively 11is peers in the United States
Senate. Write your Senator and ask
11>n why he voted the way he did
on the McCarthy appropriations, and
then tell him how you feel about
this Is. we. If they hear from enough
of us who disapprove of McCarthy's
methods and hate Communism just
1 as much, they will have to make
their decisions accordingly.

We who disapprove of Joe McCar
thy should not put, our heads in the
and, any more than we can afford
to fight Communism by avoiding
learnitig about the principles of
Communism and the intolerable
methods used to propagate those
principles. It is our responsibility to
study the man McCarthy and his
ideas and attack this problem with
tin fullest understanding possible.
Then we should express ourselves to
the individuals who are the only
true superiors of McCarthy—collec
tively 11is peers in the United States
Senate. Write your Senator and ask
11>n why he voted the way he did
on the McCarthy appropriations, and
then tell him how you feel about
this Is. we. If they hear from enough
of us who disapprove of McCarthy's
methods and hate Communism just
1 as much, they will have to make
their decisions accordingly.
Respectfully yours,

wrote at that time.)
To the Editor:
In reading over some Dailies
which I recently received, 1 found
my past staring me in the lace in
the guise of a letter from Jim Thorpe
which appeared in the Feb. 11 Cam -
pus Opinion. Quoth Mr. Thorpe
quoting me: "What will happen if
Eisenhower is elected? A new ad
ministration, a Republican admin
istration, will be in power. McCar
thy will have to tone down his at -
tacks and he will have to lit his at
titudes to those of the Republic;in
administration. ... If the Repub
licans are elected, McCarthy will
have a superior — Dwight, Eisen
hower." And that's quite right,
that's what I firmly believed.
This is to publicly announce that
1 have learned, as is well known,
how disturbingly fallacious thai log
ic was. But I might report that I
was not alone in my pre-election
fallacies. As reported in the New
York Times' Week in Review sec
lion, MarCh 11, "The Washington
Post, recalling that it had expressed
the belief that, 'MeCarthyism would
disappear overnight if Eisenhower
were elected,' said that it had 'wait
ed some 400 nights for the President
to exert the kind of leadership that
would bring that happy result.'"

However, in reading Mr. Thorpe's
letter, 1 noticed that he was rebuk
j iir , The Daily for its editorial sug
gestion to go hear McCarthy to
le. rn what kind of man this is who
now appears to the world as the
supreme power in the United States.
Here I must agree with The Daily
and disagree with "partisan Demo
crat" Thorpe, for disagreement with
McCarthy is no excuse for not mak
ing some attempt to understand him
and understand why he has the ap
peal he rloes.
We who disapprove of Joe McCar
thy should not put, our heads in the
and, any more than we can afford
to fight Communism by avoiding
learnitig about the principles of
Communism and the intolerable

principles. It is our responsibility to
