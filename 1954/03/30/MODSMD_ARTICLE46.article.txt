# Cancer Research Building Started
## To House 'Baby' Atom Smasher 
### 
Construction has begun on a
building extension to house a
six-million-volt "cancer gun" at
the Stanford School ol Medicine
in San Francisco, it was an
nounced recently by President
Wallace Sterling.
The new construction will include
a radiation - prool therapy room
where the junior-sized electron ac
celerator — baby brother of Stan
ford's billion-volt atom smasher
will be used for treating cancer.
The structure is being financed by
a gift of $75,000 from the .lames Ir
vine Foundation of San Francisco.
The Foundation was established un
dei the will of the late James Ir
vine, financier ;md rancher of San
Francisco and Orange County.
Stanford Microwave Laboratory
scientists have spent two years de
signing and building the medical
accelerator, and are now applying
finishing touches.
The project is directed by Profes
sors Edward L. Ginzton and Henry
S. Kaplan. Dr. Ginzton is director
of the Microwave Laboratory, and
Dr. Kaplan is executive head of the
Medical School's Radiology Depart
ment.
Co-sponsor of the project is the
National Cancer Institute of the Na
tional Institutes of Health, U.S. Pub
lic Health Service. Research grants
from the two donors totaled $123,000.
Construction of the gun became
feasible as a result of earlier micro
wave studies carried out at Stanford
under contracts with the Office of
Naval Research.
The microwave scientists expect
to install the cancer-fighting weapon
in its radiation - proof chamber at
the Medical School in San Francisco
sometime next summer. It will first
be tested with animals. Stanford ra
diologists hope to use it for human
cancer therapy by early 1955.
Concrete walls about a foot and a
half thick will shield areas outside
the chamber from radiation. A
three-inch lead glass window will
permit direct observation of the pa

tient from an adjacent control room,
from which the doctor can operate
the cancer gun. Access to the cham
ber will be through a motor-driven
lead door.
The gun will produce both high
energy electrons and X-rays that
can penetrate to cancerous growth
deep in the body without injury to
overlying skin tissues. Less power
ful, ordinary X-rays would be more
likely to damage these tissues and
cause X-ray sickness.


UNDER CONSTRUCTION—This extension to the Stanford School of Medicine in San Francisco
will house the new 6-million-volt cancer gun. The 2,100-square-foot structure is being financed
by a $75,000 gift from the James Irvine Foundation. The cancer gun will be installed this sum
mer, and Stanford radiologists hope to use it by early 1955 for human cancer therapy.

will house the new 6-million-volt cancer gun. The 2,100-square-foot structure is being financed
by a $75,000 gift from the James Irvine Foundation. The cancer gun will be installed this sum
mer, and Stanford radiologists hope to use it by early 1955 for human cancer therapy.
Construction has begun on a
building extension to house a
six-million-volt "cancer gun" at
the Stanford School ol Medicine
in San Francisco, it was an
nounced recently by President
Wallace Sterling.
The new construction will include
a radiation - prool therapy room
where the junior-sized electron ac
celerator — baby brother of Stan
ford's billion-volt atom smasher
will be used for treating cancer.
The structure is being financed by
a gift of $75,000 from the .lames Ir
vine Foundation of San Francisco.
The Foundation was established un
dei the will of the late James Ir
vine, financier ;md rancher of San
Francisco and Orange County.
Stanford Microwave Laboratory
scientists have spent two years de
signing and building the medical
accelerator, and are now applying
finishing touches.
The project is directed by Profes
sors Edward L. Ginzton and Henry
S. Kaplan. Dr. Ginzton is director
of the Microwave Laboratory, and
Dr. Kaplan is executive head of the
Medical School's Radiology Depart
ment.
Co-sponsor of the project is the
National Cancer Institute of the Na
tional Institutes of Health, U.S. Pub
lic Health Service. Research grants
from the two donors totaled $123,000.
Construction of the gun became
feasible as a result of earlier micro
wave studies carried out at Stanford
under contracts with the Office of
Naval Research.
The microwave scientists expect
to install the cancer-fighting weapon
in its radiation - proof chamber at
the Medical School in San Francisco
sometime next summer. It will first
be tested with animals. Stanford ra
diologists hope to use it for human
cancer therapy by early 1955.
Concrete walls about a foot and a
half thick will shield areas outside
the chamber from radiation. A
three-inch lead glass window will
permit direct observation of the pa

tient from an adjacent control room,
from which the doctor can operate
the cancer gun. Access to the cham
ber will be through a motor-driven
lead door.
The gun will produce both high
energy electrons and X-rays that
can penetrate to cancerous growth
deep in the body without injury to
overlying skin tissues. Less power
ful, ordinary X-rays would be more
likely to damage these tissues and
cause X-ray sickness.
