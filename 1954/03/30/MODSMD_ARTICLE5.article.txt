# LATIN AMERICA
## Conference Hostile Says Prof. Hilton 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
An "undercurrent of hostility
toward the United States" char
acterized the 10th Conference ol
the Americas, held recently in
Caracas, Venezuela, according
to Dr. Bouald Hilton, who at
tended the "conference under
the auspices of the University ,
of the Air.
The immediate cause of this hos
tility, Dr. Hilton said, centered j
around the United States-sponsored j
resolution declaring that Commu
nism was a menace to the Americas.
Hilton declared that the reason
that the resolution was passed (a j
vote of 17 to I, with Guatemala ob-|
jetting and" Mexico and Argentina '
abstaining) was because the Latin ;
Americans thought that in return
lot political support on the Cornrnu- j
nist issue the United States would
be obligated to give economic sup- i
port to them. However, Secretary
of State Dulles left for America as
soon as the Communist, issue was

settled, and the United States ei
ther voted down or abstained on
I many economic measures that were
! discussed.
"I feci that the United States
was perfectly correct in its stand."
Hilton brought out. "Horse-trad
ing between backing of anti
( onnnunism and economic sup
port just doesn't make much
sense."
But Hilton also brought out the
fact that the way the conference was
i arranged, Latin America had 1!)
votes (20 including Costa Rica,
which was not present at this con
; ference), the United States one. and
our delegates were automatically
put on the defensive. In his opinion,
some adjustment should be made to
j even things up.
Enlarging on the attitude of Latin
Americans toward Communism and
the United States, ifilton brought
| out three points:
t. Latin Americans are not very
interested in the world situation,
since they have an "isolationist
mentality."
2. Latin Americans are not
wholly convinced that Commu
nism is a menace to them.
:t. In any argument between the
United States and a Latin American
country, .sympathy always goes to
the latter. In support of this obser
vation, Hilton said that the Latin
Americans he talked to and the
newspapers he read frequently used
the simile of David and Goliath in
• referring to the controversy be
tween Guatemala and the United
| States.
Hilton's role in the conference
consisted in interviewing dele
gates and reporting on the con
ference for the University of the
Air. a former Voice of America
station that now broadcasts in
Npanidt and Portuguese to Latin
A merit an countries.
