## 
### 
NFAV YORK. March 29 (UP) — !
Secretary of State John Foster Dul
les said tonight the free world must
take "united action" now to prevent
Russia and Communist China from i
seizing control of Southeast Asia re
gardless of any "serious risk."
Dulles said conquest of Southeast
Asia by the Reds "would be a grave
threat to the whole free commu
nity."
"The t'niled States feels that
that possibility should not lie pas
sively accepted, Imt should he met
by united action, i'his might in
volve serious risks. lint these
risks are fur less than those thai
will face ns a few years from now,
if we dare not he resolute today,"
he said.
Dulles' speech to the Overseas
Press Club was billed as a major
tore. policy declaration and wa:
made against the background of the l
war in Indochina where Communist
forces, supplied and trained hv the
Chinese Communists, are making a
major effort to smash French Union
forces. .
The portion of his speech calling I
for united action was pointed out in i
advance to the British and French
ambassador ; in Washington. Diplo- J
matic sources said die United States
will ask Britain and France to join
in a declaration g ua r a nt c e in g
Southeast Asia against Red aggres
sion.
Dulles repealled his warning In
the Communists that the United
States may resist aggression "at
places and by means of tree world
choosing," rather than limiting re
taliation to any specific point
where aggression is committed.
He conceded that the Chinese
Reds have not actually sent an army
into Indochina, but said 2,000 Chi
nese technicians are aiding the In
dochinese Communists and that the
Chinese are promoting aggression
"by all means slwrt of open inva- j
sion."
"The free nations want peace," i
he said. "However, peace is not J
had merely by wanting it."
Certain risks must be taken to |
i win peace, he said, and thp chance j
! for it is usually "bettered by letting j
| a potential aggressor know in ad- i
i vance where his aggression could \
lead him."
