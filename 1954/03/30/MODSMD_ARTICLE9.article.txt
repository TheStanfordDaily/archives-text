# Fines Delay Reg
## 
### 
Regis!iat ion was delayed lor many
student-- yesterday because ol de
linquencies on library lines. The
confusion was due to the I act that
many students replaced books in the
slacks themselves or returned them
to the desk without paying the fines.
The Library attempted to track
down the missing books. However,
the delinquency list that was sent in
to the Registrar included the names
of many Undents who had returned
all books and paid all lines.
The Library staff continued re
moving names from the Registrar'-
list as fast as the books were found.
However, many students got an un
necessary 45-minute wait in line.
