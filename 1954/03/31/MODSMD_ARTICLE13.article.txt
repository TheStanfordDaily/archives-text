### 
WASHINGTON. March 30
(UP)—Congress gave final ap
proval today to a compromise
bill cutting federal excise taxes
an estimated $999,000,000 a year
on furs, jewelry, household ap
pliances, movie tickets, and
many other items.
The White House promptly an
nounced that. President Eisenhower
will sign the bill tomorrow, prob
ably in the morning. Mr. Eisenhow
er originally opposed the reductions,
but decided to sign the measure into
law to prevent an automatic tax
drop costing the Treasury even
more than the bill.
The reductions signal price cuts
on many items covered by the bill,
although the motion picture indus
try has warned that rising operating
costs may prevent, exhibitors from
passing on the full savings to their
customers.
Neither will retail prices drop by
the same percentage as excise taxes
are cut,. This is because excises are
levied on the manufacturers' price
which is lower than the retail price.
Thus, the percentage slash at the
retail level would be smaller.
