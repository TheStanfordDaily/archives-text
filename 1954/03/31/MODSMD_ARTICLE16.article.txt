# Wilson: H-Bomb Tests Show 'Unbelievable' Power
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 30 (UP)—Defense Secretary Charles,E.
Wilson said today the "unbelievable" power unleashed in test
H-Bornb explosions this month dwarfed the atomic bomb just as
the A-Bomb dwarfed TNT bombs of World War 11.
He made the statement as Rep. Chet Holifield, a member of the

Congressional Atomic Energy Com
mittee, called on President Eisen
hower, Russian Premier Georgi Ma
lenkov, and Queen Elizabeth to dis
close the fantastic power of newly
tested atomic and hydrogen bombs.
Wilson told a news conference the
results of two 11-bomb tests in the
Pacific this month were "unbeliev
able in many ways—the whole con
cept of modern warfare is involved
in realities which are hard to ac
cept."
His statement followed the an
nouncement by the Atomic En
ergy Commission that a second
hydrogen blast was "successfully
carried out" last Friday—an an
nouncement that touched off
sharp new criticism in some parts
of the world against the American
experiments.
Wilson said the United States is
determined to "be in a position to
deter military aggression just as we
intend to win any war if it starts."
He also said the new H-bombs dem
onstrate the mounting peril facing
any aggressor.
"We all hope we do not have an
other all-out war, for if we do, it
will in this atomic age be a war
of survival,'" he said in a statement
repeated for TV cameras.
Holifield, who saw the effects
of the titanic March 1 hydrogen
explosion, told the House, how
ever, that "civil defense against
atomic-hydrogen attack is a de
lusion. . . . Mass extermination
of millions in any or all nations
can occur during a weekend."
Urging that actual demonstrations
be arranged for the public, Holifield
said, "The time has come when the
people of all nations should know
the truth about the power and ef
fect" of hydrogen bombs. He said
"the danger of destroying civiliza
tion has become real."
Despite from abroad,
there was every indication the tests
would continue at this country's su
per-secret Pacific proving grounds.
One source said a third test is plan
ned for the latter part of April.
Meantime, there were these other
developments:
Atomic Energy Commissioner
Lewis L. Strauss, bearing a large
map of the Pacific, reported to Mr.
Eisenhower on the current, series
of U.S. tests. Strauss declined to
discuss their conversation hut it
was believed either he or the
President would issue a statement
later. Mr. Eisenhower will be
asked about the bomb at a news
conference tomorrow.
New fears of radiation and dam
age to Japan's fishing industry
swept that country despite Wilson's
assertion that he knows of no radi
ation casualties in the second blast.
The March 1 test sprayed radio
active dust in varying degrees over
378 persons.

swept that country despite Wilson's
assertion that he knows of no radi
ation casualties in the second blast.
The March 1 test sprayed radio
active dust in varying degrees over
378 persons.
WASHINGTON, March 30 (UP)—Defense Secretary Charles,E.
Wilson said today the "unbelievable" power unleashed in test
H-Bornb explosions this month dwarfed the atomic bomb just as
the A-Bomb dwarfed TNT bombs of World War 11.
He made the statement as Rep. Chet Holifield, a member of the

Congressional Atomic Energy Com
mittee, called on President Eisen
hower, Russian Premier Georgi Ma
lenkov, and Queen Elizabeth to dis
close the fantastic power of newly
tested atomic and hydrogen bombs.
Wilson told a news conference the
results of two 11-bomb tests in the
Pacific this month were "unbeliev
able in many ways—the whole con
cept of modern warfare is involved
in realities which are hard to ac
cept."
His statement followed the an
nouncement by the Atomic En
ergy Commission that a second
hydrogen blast was "successfully
carried out" last Friday—an an
nouncement that touched off
sharp new criticism in some parts
of the world against the American
experiments.
Wilson said the United States is
determined to "be in a position to
deter military aggression just as we
intend to win any war if it starts."
He also said the new H-bombs dem
onstrate the mounting peril facing
any aggressor.
"We all hope we do not have an
other all-out war, for if we do, it
will in this atomic age be a war
of survival,'" he said in a statement
repeated for TV cameras.
Holifield, who saw the effects
of the titanic March 1 hydrogen
explosion, told the House, how
ever, that "civil defense against
atomic-hydrogen attack is a de
lusion. . . . Mass extermination
of millions in any or all nations
can occur during a weekend."
Urging that actual demonstrations
be arranged for the public, Holifield
said, "The time has come when the
people of all nations should know
the truth about the power and ef
fect" of hydrogen bombs. He said
"the danger of destroying civiliza
tion has become real."
Despite from abroad,
there was every indication the tests
would continue at this country's su
per-secret Pacific proving grounds.
One source said a third test is plan
ned for the latter part of April.
Meantime, there were these other
developments:
Atomic Energy Commissioner
Lewis L. Strauss, bearing a large
map of the Pacific, reported to Mr.
Eisenhower on the current, series
of U.S. tests. Strauss declined to
discuss their conversation hut it
was believed either he or the
President would issue a statement
later. Mr. Eisenhower will be
asked about the bomb at a news
conference tomorrow.

age to Japan's fishing industry
