### 
LONDON, March 30 (UP) â€”
Prime Minister Winston Church
til today rejected demands that
he intervene with the United
States in an attempt to get U.S.
authorities to stop their hydro
gen bomb experiments.
The Prime Minister defended the
United States in making the test
blasts and said they mark progress
toward the defe"nse of the free
world.
Churchill told a noisy House of
Commons session he does not have
the facts on the American H-bomb
tests and said "we should all like
to know more" about them.
But he refused to press the United
States to reveal the information be
cause "we might easily do great
harm."
Churchill was answering a del
uge of questions from opposition
Socialist deputies, who* expressed
alarm over the implications of the
U.S. H-bomb explosions. The La
borites were angry that Britain
was kept in the dark on the pow
erful tests.
Dissatisfied with Churchill's an
swers, 32 back - bench Laborites
introduced a motion tonight de
manding he abandon his patient
attitude and do everything pos
sible to prevent the United States
from staging further H - bomb
tests. Labor party leaders did not
sign the motion.
Churchill tried to reassure shout
ing lawmakers by expressing faith
in American judgment and in the
safety measures announced in the
Pacific testing area.
He said "our own scientific
knowledge" shows there is no foun
dation for fears that scientists might
not be able to calculate the jforce of
the explosions or set limits to the
explosive power of the bomb.
"It is being suggested that I
should endeavor to persuade the
U.S. government to abandon their
series of experimental explosions
of hydrogen bombs," Churchill
said.
"We have no power to stop this
and I am sure that it would not
be right or wise for us to ask that
it should he stopped.
"When similar experiments were
conducted by the Russians I cannot,
remember that anyone sugge led
that such representations should be
made to the Soviet government."
