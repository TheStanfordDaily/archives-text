# An Old 'New Look'
## 
### 
Secretary of State John Foster Dulles pin
pointed one aspect of the administration's "new
look" in foreign affairs in his nationwide
speech made before the Overseas Press Club
in New York this week.
He announced that the United States will
block any Communist expansion in Southeast
Asia, even if this means taking "united action"
with France or other countries to do so. He also
repeated an earlier statement that the United
States has no intentions of either recognizing
Tied China or voting for the admission of the
Peiping government to the United Nations.
Dulles Warned the nation that "this might
involve serious risks. But these risks are far
less those that will face us a few years
from now, if we dare not be resolute today."
The Secretary of State didn't mince words in
defining the attitude of the United States to
ward her allies and the Communists. He was
carrying through a policy followed throughout

the present administration—that of letting our
enemies know what we will not tolerate and
our friends know what they can count on.
It is significant that this "new look" is a bi
partisan policy which had its beginning dur
ing the Truman administration. For it was in
1947 that the Truman Doctrine first announced
to the world that the United States had drawn
a line against any further Communist aggres
sion and would fight to protect the free world.
Before the Truman Doctrine, countries were
being swallowed behind the Iron Curtain at an
average of two a year. Since 1947 no new sat
ellites have been added to the Soviet Union
and Korea has proved the United States will
back its written declarations with bullets.
In reaffirming this basic "get tough" doc
trine, Secretary Dulles has again shown that
a change in administration hasn't meant any
change in the United States' determination to
halt Communist expansion whenever and
wherever it occurs.
