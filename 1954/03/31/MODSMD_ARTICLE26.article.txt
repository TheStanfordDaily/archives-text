PANIC AT TIIF-: SUNKEN DIAMOND
In the course of a year, a Daily photographer is
called on to take all sorts of interesting pictures, and
a lot of pictures of no interest at all. Let us settle
J'or the interesting statement that photographers take
pictures, and we will suffer from l ;i "

Last year, this photographer
was called on to go take a picture
at the Cal-Stanford baseball
game. All well and good; I like
to spend an afternoon at the
game as well as anyone else. So
1 loaded myself down with the
i amera and rolled out there.
After a couple of preliminary
shots, including a shot of Earl
Warren, then the governor and
a Cal fan, and the usual shots of

a couple of red-hot players, I moved out toward third
base line.
There I took the traditional stance of the photogra
pher at work: ready and alert, a sharp, clear-eyed
youth. And before long, IT happened.
The batter caught onri. It wasn't anything to be
proud of, just a little blooper fly that was going
foul over thirrt base. It went up and up, and over
me. I didn't know exactly where the damn thing
was, and I panicked. So, I decided that the thing
to do was to make myself temporarily scarce.
Accordingly, I headed for the safety of the hill on
the eastern side of the diamond. I didn't stroll, I
didn't walk, I didn't run, I loped. And as 1 picked
up speed, 1 heard something behind me. It was none

other than the Cal third sacker.
At first I had great admiration for this fellow. Here
was someone else smart enough to run when the sit
uation called for such action. The only thing was
that he was catching up on rne.
Then he shouted: "Get down, you damn fool!"
Well, I appreciate any help and advice 1 can get in
a situation like that, so I hit the dust. And just as
I did, the ball fell to the ground about six inches be
yond where my head wound up. The third baseman
managed, but don't ask me how, to avoid walking up
my spine with his cleated shoes. I turned to thank
my benefactor, but it seems he was unhappy. Ap
parently he was not so much terrified by the ball
as he was motivated to catch it and put the batter out.
Well, he wasn't the only one who was unhappy.
The Cal team was demanding that I be thrown off
the field. The fans in the stands were demanding
worse than that, and it seemed to deal with niy
well-being. And I didn't like being chased.
I still go to the games, and I still take pictures
once in a while. But 1 don't think I'll ever be com
fortable when watching a pop fly. Not, at least, unless
I'm padded from head to toe and crowned with a
tin hat.
It did make rne a 'public figure, though. Every
once in a while I overhear someone talking about
the afternoon some stupid hypo-hound got chased
off the field by a pop fly he didn't have the brains to
judge. And in case anybody ever wondered, that's
me.
Anybody for chess?

PANIC AT TIIF-: SUNKEN DIAMOND
In the course of a year, a Daily photographer is
called on to take all sorts of interesting pictures, and
a lot of pictures of no interest at all. Let us settle
J'or the interesting statement that photographers take
pictures, and we will suffer from l ;i "

Last year, this photographer
was called on to go take a picture
at the Cal-Stanford baseball
game. All well and good; I like
to spend an afternoon at the
game as well as anyone else. So
1 loaded myself down with the
i amera and rolled out there.
After a couple of preliminary
shots, including a shot of Earl
Warren, then the governor and
a Cal fan, and the usual shots of

a couple of red-hot players, I moved out toward third
base line.
There I took the traditional stance of the photogra
pher at work: ready and alert, a sharp, clear-eyed
youth. And before long, IT happened.
The batter caught onri. It wasn't anything to be
proud of, just a little blooper fly that was going
foul over thirrt base. It went up and up, and over
me. I didn't know exactly where the damn thing
was, and I panicked. So, I decided that the thing
to do was to make myself temporarily scarce.
Accordingly, I headed for the safety of the hill on
the eastern side of the diamond. I didn't stroll, I
didn't walk, I didn't run, I loped. And as 1 picked
up speed, 1 heard something behind me. It was none

other than the Cal third sacker.
At first I had great admiration for this fellow. Here
was someone else smart enough to run when the sit
uation called for such action. The only thing was
that he was catching up on rne.
Then he shouted: "Get down, you damn fool!"
Well, I appreciate any help and advice 1 can get in
a situation like that, so I hit the dust. And just as
I did, the ball fell to the ground about six inches be
yond where my head wound up. The third baseman
managed, but don't ask me how, to avoid walking up
my spine with his cleated shoes. I turned to thank
my benefactor, but it seems he was unhappy. Ap
parently he was not so much terrified by the ball
as he was motivated to catch it and put the batter out.
Well, he wasn't the only one who was unhappy.
The Cal team was demanding that I be thrown off
the field. The fans in the stands were demanding
worse than that, and it seemed to deal with niy
well-being. And I didn't like being chased.
I still go to the games, and I still take pictures
once in a while. But 1 don't think I'll ever be com
fortable when watching a pop fly. Not, at least, unless
I'm padded from head to toe and crowned with a
tin hat.
It did make rne a 'public figure, though. Every
once in a while I overhear someone talking about
the afternoon some stupid hypo-hound got chased
off the field by a pop fly he didn't have the brains to
judge. And in case anybody ever wondered, that's
me.
