1 rather suspect that the idea of
giving grades first originated as a
well-intentioned attempt to help
perhaps force—students to gel an
education. The system is probably
quite desirable, even essential, at
the grammar school level where the
pupils are necessarily immature,
but • when University students are
involved I'm inclined to think that
grades—or more accurately the em
phasis put on grades by students
and parents, by faculty and pros
pective employers may be a real
barrier to becoming educated.
1 must admit that 1 am troubled
by the fact that many students ap
pear to be far more concerned about
what grade they receive than about
how much they learn. What Ls more,
the over-emphasis on grades is often
self-defeating because grades, un
like education that is acquired
daily, constantly, depend on per
formarice at the time tests are given,
anil the tenseness produced by the
overpowering concern with grades
can lead to lower grades.
It may be argued that the grade
is but a measure of the education
gained, and thus concern over one
thing is a reflection of interest in
the other. I'm not convinced by
this argument. I don't believe that
grades necessarily measure the
amount of education gained, I
don't even believe they often do;
antl that the very apparent con
cern of the students over grades
is but an outward sign of an in

tense inward interest in gaining
an education is, to say the least,
not oflviously true. -
I am speaking, of course, about
"letter" grades. They are the ones
that seem to concern the student.
When a test is returned the per
centage oi' questions answered cor
rectly seems to be of little impor
tance, tlie important thing seems to
L»e "Where do the C's begin?" or the
B's, or the K's. It is also true that
my feeling about the relatively
small importance of grades is influ
enced by the possibly unrealistic
beliefs that the main reason for go
ing to college is to become educated,
that education is a personal thing
not measurable by conformity to
average behavior, and that given the
opportunity each student can re
move from a course that which is
of most importance for his personal
growth—and what is most impor
tant to one student may not seem so
to anyone else, •
When one considers with care
just what a grade means it is dif
ficult to see why grades have
been given (lie disproportionate
importance that they seem to
have. Under the system used for
grading lar#e lower division
classes, an "A" by definition
means simply that the student
who receives it has been at
a definite set of times a finite
number of questions — perhaps
chosen with an eye to ease of
grading—and has answered more
of these questions to the satisfac
tion of the instructor than H5 per
cent of his classmates. As far as
I can see a grade measures no
less, and no more. Under this sys
tem it is unavoidable that some
students will receive A's and just
as many will receive D's without

respect to the variation in the
general level of ability of the class,
a level that may change from
year to year, or to the fact that
the sheer hulk of material that
must be included in the course
may be constantly increasing.
it is possible that there may be
some instructors who can construct
tests so cunningly that this year's
high "B" would riot have been a
low "A" some other year. I am
sure I can't. It is possible that there
may be some instructors who can
ask questions so significant that the
number properly answered is a
real measure of the education
gained, and this for each and every
member of any class. 1 suspect that
this is most nearly possible in the
"professional" courses mainly de
signed to increase technical compe
tence, completely impossible in
those courses which are designed to
educate rather than train —the very
courses 1 consider most important.
At any rate I am sure that I
cannot find such sufficiently sig
nificant questions. Even if I were
far wiser than I am, I think I
would have to write a special test
for each student, and know the
student very well indeed, before
I felt that my questions could
really find out something impor
tant about his educatioanl stale.
From my point of view, then, the
primary, perhaps the only valid
purpose in going to a university
should be to become educated, to
gajn more culture; grades are by
definition only a measure of relative
proficiency at a given time, with a
particular group furnishing the

frame of reference, and hardly a
true measure of how well each indi
vidual is achieving the purpose lie
had iri coming to Stanford; to give
grades more importance than a con
sideration ol what they mean shows
them to deserve is to make the pri
mary purpose less important.
Not that I think that grades have

absolutely no importance; they cer
tainly have their place in the edu
cational system* I simply want to
suggest that it might be to Ihe
benefit of all concerned if we piH
them in their place.
