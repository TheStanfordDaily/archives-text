# CAMPUS OPINION
## The 						Library and Efficiency 
### 
To the Editor:
During winter quarter registra
tion I was in the last group of stu
dents to be processed. 1 stepped to
the registration table in Mem Aud
lobby, spoke my name in a clear
manner, and waited for my regis
tration book. The girl behind the
table looked for my book and finally
announced that I was guilty of a
library violation. 1 was told this
meant that my registration book
would not be issued until I squared
my account with the library. I had
not received a notice from the li
brary concerning a delinquency of
any sort.
Feeling somewhat oppressed 1
went to the library to pay my debt
to society. An hour and a half later
an apologetic library employee told
me a clerical mistake had been
made by the library.
At the library I was confronted
with a line of frightening propor
tions. Few of the people in this
line had an idea of the nature of
their delinquencies. Not one of
the people to whom I talked had
received a notice by mail. I en
countered people who were told
to search the stacks for a hook
if they felt they had returned it.
I observed several people who
found their hooks in the stacks—
incorrectly shelved. One man
found it dillicult to restrain him
self when he was told that he had
Volume VIII of a seven-volume
series.
This quarter the same thing hap
pened. While 1 did not have to wait
as long this time, I know of many
people who waited nearly two
hours to find that the library had
made a regrettable error. Again, the
number of clerical errors was ap
palling. Again, notices were not
sent out.
Two Issues are involved in this

sad state of aaffirs: (1) the poor sys
tem currently being used for check
ing library delinquencies, and (2)
the inefficiency evident in the man
agement of the Stanford Library,
The first of these issues relates to
geenral policy at Stanford. The in
tegrity and trustworthiness of hu
man beings is assumed to be operant
in all activities instigated and main
tained by Stanford University. It
seems incongruous, then, that such
a primitive form of punishment is
used by the library. By refusing to
give a student his registration book
Lhe University is, in essence, prac
ticing a somewhat outmoded form
of justice, i.e., that one is guilty
until proved innocent.
The second issue—concerning li
brary management —is clear. The
system of library punishment as it
stands would not be so poor (it
would still be poor) if all delin
quencies were accurately noted. The
library, unfortunately, administers a
poor system poorly.
I would like to propose aboli
tion of the system of withholding
registration hooks for suspected
library violations. In its place I
suggest the following alternative:
Withhold grades until library fines
are cleared. This would prohibit a
person from obtaining transcripts
for any purpose. Such a system
would demand a more accurate
checking of books withdrawn
from and returned to the library,
and woiild permit a more leisurely
tracking down of violators.
Mr. Reynard Swank, Director of
Stanford Libraries, is at the Univer
sity of Manila helping university
officials there to reorganize their li
brary. 1 hope some positive action
will be initiated by Mr. Swank when
lie returns to the very real problems
present in his own back yard.

with a line of frightening propor
tions. Few of the people in this
line had an idea of the nature of
their delinquencies. Not one of
the people to whom I talked had
received a notice by mail. I en
countered people who were told
to search the stacks for a hook
if they felt they had returned it.
I observed several people who
found their hooks in the stacks—
incorrectly shelved. One man
found it dillicult to restrain him
self when he was told that he had
Volume VIII of a seven-volume
series.
This quarter the same thing hap
pened. While 1 did not have to wait
as long this time, I know of many
people who waited nearly two
hours to find that the library had
made a regrettable error. Again, the
number of clerical errors was ap
palling. Again, notices were not
sent out.
Two Issues are involved in this

sad state of aaffirs: (1) the poor sys
tem currently being used for check
ing library delinquencies, and (2)
the inefficiency evident in the man
agement of the Stanford Library,
The first of these issues relates to
geenral policy at Stanford. The in
tegrity and trustworthiness of hu
man beings is assumed to be operant
in all activities instigated and main
tained by Stanford University. It
seems incongruous, then, that such
a primitive form of punishment is
used by the library. By refusing to
give a student his registration book
Lhe University is, in essence, prac
ticing a somewhat outmoded form
of justice, i.e., that one is guilty
until proved innocent.
The second issue—concerning li
brary management —is clear. The
system of library punishment as it
stands would not be so poor (it
would still be poor) if all delin
quencies were accurately noted. The
library, unfortunately, administers a
poor system poorly.
I would like to propose aboli
tion of the system of withholding
registration hooks for suspected
library violations. In its place I
suggest the following alternative:
Withhold grades until library fines
are cleared. This would prohibit a
person from obtaining transcripts
for any purpose. Such a system
would demand a more accurate
checking of books withdrawn
from and returned to the library,
and woiild permit a more leisurely
tracking down of violators.
Mr. Reynard Swank, Director of
Stanford Libraries, is at the Univer
sity of Manila helping university
officials there to reorganize their li
brary. 1 hope some positive action
will be initiated by Mr. Swank when
lie returns to the very real problems
present in his own back yard.

To the Editor:
During winter quarter registra
tion I was in the last group of stu
dents to be processed. 1 stepped to
the registration table in Mem Aud
lobby, spoke my name in a clear
manner, and waited for my regis
tration book. The girl behind the
table looked for my book and finally
announced that I was guilty of a
library violation. 1 was told this
meant that my registration book
would not be issued until I squared
my account with the library. I had
not received a notice from the li
brary concerning a delinquency of
any sort.
Feeling somewhat oppressed 1
went to the library to pay my debt
to society. An hour and a half later
an apologetic library employee told
me a clerical mistake had been
made by the library.
