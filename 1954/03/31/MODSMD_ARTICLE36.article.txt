# Farm Property Supplied By Dual Water System

### TACY ANN SMITH 
The bright yellow faucets
around the campus are a visible
part of Stanford's dual water
system. The two systems—do
mestic and irrigation — supply
the University with all its water.
The domestic water supply is ob
tained from deep wells, and water of
lesser sanitary quality is used for
irrigation. To make sure that the
irrigation water is not used for
drinking, the outlets are identified
by their yellow color and metal
tags.
The domestic supply wells are lo
cated on San Francisquito Creek
between the Con Home and Gover
nor's Road. The pumping apparatus
is housed in green iron shelters. The
wells extend down 100 feet, and
each is equipped with a chlorinator.
Once a month, the domestic water
is tested at the county health labo
ratory, and the chlorine content is
checked daily by the Stanford water
department.
The University also has a stand
by connection with the San Fran-

Cisco water system, alone El C'a
mino, which can supply the cam
pus in an emergency.
Water for Encina Gym and the
men's swimming pooLs is obtained
from a well at the gym.
Because of the higher cost of the
domestic supply, lesser sanitary
quality water is used for gardening
and fire protection on the campus.
The Department of Huildings
and grounds keeps a record of"
Stanford's wat e r consumption.
During the school year, nearly five
million gallons of domestic water
is used each week. From Septem
ber 1952 to September 1953, 252
million gallons of domestic and
24:i million gallons of irrigation
water were used.
The Stanford Public Health Serv
ice is responsible for the safety of
the water supply, and is especially
concerned with preventing cross
connections of the two systems and
with identification of the unsafe
supply.
The Public Health Service in
cludes the University Health Officer,
Louis Olsen; a full - time public
health nurse, Miss Margaret Ria
setto; and two student inspectors.
