# Masters keeps Up 'No Comment' Line; Lakers' Pollard Cage Coach Possibility
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
' Speculation continued yesterday as to who will be the new Stanford* head basketball coach.
Though Athletic Director A 1 Masters reportedly has made a selection, he still is saying "no com
ment" when asked by reporters. •
Some 50 applications have been received by the Department for the position vacated by Bob
Burnett, who recently announced his resignation to enter private business.
, The official announcement of the new coach's name will probably be made Friday evening,

Pollard enrolled at Stanford in'
I 19-11, and in his sophomore year
played on the NCAA championship
team. After transferring to Min- j
I nesota and graduating he played j
with the Alameda Coast Guard, the j
! semi-pro San Diego Dons, and the
| Oakland Bittners before turning pro.
His first season with Minneapolis,
1!)47, Pollard played center. The fol
lowing year, when George Mikan
joined the team from the Detroit
club, Pollard shifted to forward, and,
occasionally played guard. •
Despite the fact he played in
Mikan's shadow the past six years,

after the Stanford Athletic Board*
meets. The SAB, along with the
Board of Trustees, must approve |
Masters' recommendation.
Though no one knows who Masters !
has selected, a number of names |
have been mentioned. It is generally
felt that the new mentor will prob- !
ably he an alumnus.
The best bet at this time seems
to he Jim Pollard, ace eager of (he
professional Minneapolis Lakers.
The "Kangaroo Kid," who lias been
making $12,000 with the Inkers,
would have to lake a salary cut
of roughly 50 per cent, but still
says he is interested in the job.

; his ability is well known to basket-
I ball fans, one of whom once de
! scribed him as "the best second fid- ;
dler in the business."
A magazine article written about j
Pollard in 1951 said the following
j about him:
"Pollard's future: He hopes to
play two or three more years of pro
fessional basketball and then go into
the coaching field.
" 'I don't want to continue play
ing basket hall after I'm over the
hump,' concludes the NllA's most
feared hackcourt performer. 'I
don't want to stay in there when I
can't do things I should. When
I'm starting to get washed up, I'll
know it and I'll quit on my own
accord. Nobody will have to cut
my pay or keep me around to be
nice to me.' "
Perhaps Pollard feels he's over the
hump now.
Two alumni who were given early j
mention for the job can probably
be scratched—Fordy Anderson, head |
coach at Bradley, and Hank Luisetti.
Anderson has taken the job vacated
by Pete Newell at Michigan State,
and Luisetti, who coached the Stew
art Chevrolet Club for several sea
sons, knows what thtvjob pays and
has said "not interested." He was
likewise not interested three years I
ago when he was approached before
Burnett was hired.
The two other most oft-mentioned
candidates are H. B Lee and Howie
Dalmar. Lee is now head coach at
Colorado. He played at Stanford on
the great Luisetti teams of 1037-38,
coached frosh basketball at Stanford
in 1941, and then moved to Utah
State.
Dallmar was on the same team
with Pollard in 1941. He is head
coach at Pennsylvania, a school
which in basketball is also trou
bled with high entrance require
ments. In the city of Philadelphia
t with three heavy-proselyting bas
ketball schools, LaSalle, Temple,
and St. Joseph's, Pennsylvania is
faced with much the same problem
as Stanford, and Dallmar's switch
to the Farm would be nothing new
for him in that respect.
Still another candidate for the job
is Dick Clegg. He is currently the
freshman basketball coach, the same
position Burnett held before re- '
placing Everett Dean at the Varsity
helm.


JUMPING JIM POLLARD—Of the Minneapolis Lakers, perennial
professional champions, Jim is a likely choice to fill the present
vacancy in the job of head coach of basketball at Stanford, j
Long one of the National Basketball Associations' top scorers, i
he has played under the gigantic shadow of teammate George
Mikan.
