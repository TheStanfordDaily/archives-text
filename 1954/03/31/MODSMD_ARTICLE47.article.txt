# Golfers Face Rugged Match
## 
### 
A potent but winless Stanford
golf squad will try again this after
noon against the California Golf
Club team of South San Francisco
on the hitter's course.
Coach Bud Finger will take main
stays Warren Dai ley, Fred Brown,
Grant Spaeth, and Phil Cetchell
north along with Bob Sims and
Chuck Van Linge. Van Linge, a JC
tran l"i and Marine veteran, is a
newcomer to the squad.
Despite creditable performances
the Cards have dropped two

j promises equally strong competition.
The California club boasts such re
nowns as Bob Cardinal, former Cal
ifornia Open champ; Dr. Robert
Knudson, touted in local amateur
circles; and Bill Howell, former
winner ol the amateur part of the
I Binn ( i o bv Pro-Am.
