## The 						Inside Pitch Small Talk 
### 
We were sorry to learn that Sports Editor Phil Berman won't be
ible to return to school this quarter because of a prolonged ill
ness. Not only is Phil a fine writer, but he is a line administrator,
which is one of the main pie-requisites for the sports editor
position. ✓ #
The likeable senior from Scarsdale, New York, has gone home

to recuperate and everyone on the
staff wishes Phil a speedy recovery
ind hopes to see him back next fall.

With Michigan's track team being
hailed the closest thing to USC,
coach Jack Weiershauser is prob
•ibly wondering whether he should
have his squad show up for the big
intersectional meet Saturday in the
Stadium.
The Wolverines, who have com
peted in a half dozen or so indoor
nneets this past winter have two high
jumpers who can better G-7, a dis
cus thrower who can reach 174-2
and can also put the shot better than
55 feet, and a pair of milers, one who
has romped the course in 4:09.4 and
the other who has dragged iri at
4:12.9.
But, alas and alack who can
tell what a given Stanford team
will do on a given day. The team
has heen strengthened hy the re
turn of sprinter Jim Truher, hur
dler (ierry Wood and weightman
Al Cheney.
And then you can never tell when
another Roy Smith will pop up.
Smith is'the Frank Merriwell who
came out of nowhere to win the low
hurdles and consequently the meet
against Fresno for the Indians last
Saturday. Incidentally Roy is the
brother of Princeton's All-American
footballer Homer Smith.
Weiershausei* and his gang will
show!

What with many schools starting
spring football practice anil Stanford
slated to begin its 20-day limbering
up period later in April, pigskin
news is in the air. .
Pappy Waldorf, who's sporting a
three-year contract doesn't plan to
use the highly touted frosh Ronnie
Knox and the formidable Paul Lar
son in a split-T, but indications are
that if Knox can fill the bill at QB,
trouble spelled L-a-r-s-o-n will
operate at halfback.
Jess Hill is singing the hlues
moaning that he has a green squad
to work with and the fact that
hacks Aramis Dandoy and Jim
Decker are having scholastic diffi
culties which will prevent them
front participating in spring prac
tice. v
Hill is planning to work from the
T, Wing T, Split T, and single wing.
He already sees either Cal or Oregon
in the Rose Bowl.
And what does Michigan Central
think about the fqptball situation?
Well, they can't get any insight
from spring practice because they
can't hold any. And why not? No
coaches.

We see that Jim Mathias is follow
ing in his brother's track footsteps,
j The Occidental sophomore took a

first in the discus and a .second in
the shot-put as Oxy's "best balanced
squad in history" rolled over Po
mona-Claremont llil'.i to 11- i last
Saturday.
Stanford's top discus man Bob
Kimball can hit 150 on a Rood day.
Mathias won with a 149-foot heave.
It should be a good contest between
the two when Stanford meets Oxy
in Los Angeles April 24.

Bill Veeck, who is the top re
cruiter lor the Los Angeles Angels,

of baseball captain Warren Goodrich
while the Cards were defeating
UCLA twice over the week end in
Los Angeles.
Veeck turned out for the game in
his usual spoils shirt attire. Reports

and St. Louis Browns' boss hasn't
worn u tie since his wedding day
in 1932.

With Michigan's track team being
hailed the closest thing to USC,
coach Jack Weiershauser is prob
•ibly wondering whether he should
have his squad show up for the big
intersectional meet Saturday in the
Stadium.
The Wolverines, who have com
peted in a half dozen or so indoor
nneets this past winter have two high
jumpers who can better G-7, a dis
cus thrower who can reach 174-2
and can also put the shot better than
55 feet, and a pair of milers, one who
has romped the course in 4:09.4 and
the other who has dragged iri at
4:12.9.
But, alas and alack who can
tell what a given Stanford team
will do on a given day. The team
has heen strengthened hy the re
turn of sprinter Jim Truher, hur
dler (ierry Wood and weightman
Al Cheney.
And then you can never tell when
another Roy Smith will pop up.
Smith is'the Frank Merriwell who
came out of nowhere to win the low
hurdles and consequently the meet
against Fresno for the Indians last
Saturday. Incidentally Roy is the
brother of Princeton's All-American
footballer Homer Smith.
Weiershausei* and his gang will

use the highly touted frosh Ronnie
Knox and the formidable Paul Lar
son in a split-T, but indications are
that if Knox can fill the bill at QB,
trouble spelled L-a-r-s-o-n will
operate at halfback.
Jess Hill is singing the hlues
moaning that he has a green squad
to work with and the fact that
hacks Aramis Dandoy and Jim
Decker are having scholastic diffi
culties which will prevent them
front participating in spring prac
tice. v
Hill is planning to work from the
T, Wing T, Split T, and single wing.
He already sees either Cal or Oregon
in the Rose Bowl.
And what does Michigan Central
think about the fqptball situation?
Well, they can't get any insight
from spring practice because they
can't hold any. And why not? No
coaches.
