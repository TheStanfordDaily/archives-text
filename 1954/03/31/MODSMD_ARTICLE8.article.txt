## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Plans (or the big spring ASSU elections began lo roll long before
Stanford scholars took off for their long-awaited spring vacation.
Election Board committees have been organized and preparations
for the spring balloting are now getting their finishing touches so
that the election machinery will be ready for operation by the

time nominations open next Monday.
The election board, the motivating
force behind all general campus
elections, holds tryouts at the begin
ning of each year to choose a 42-
member committee which is in turn
divided into five subcommittees:
Eligibility, which checks nomina
tion and general qualifications of
nominees;
Expenditures, which sees that all

The Election Board recently
vetoed the proposal for voting ma
chines for the spring elections
which was passed last quarter by
Excoiy because of (he confusion
that might arise and the delay that
might be involved in the actual
voting process.

candidates stay within legal limits;
Ballot, which supervises the print
ing of all ballots;
Publicity, which stimulates inter
est in elections by means of stra
tegically placed posters;
Rally and Orientation subcom
mittee, which provides for rallies
and house introduction of candi
dates.
The election board supervises all
ASSU, Men's and Women's Council,
class officer, and, last but not least,
all Daily elections. Working with
the official board are 90 girls who
run the election booths from 9 a.m.
to 3 p.m. on the days of balloting.
In the autumn, freshman class
officers and two representatives to
Men's and Women's Council are
chosen. Spring elections bring the
balloting for ASSU president, vice
president, cheer leader, all class
officers, Row and living group rep-'
resentatives to Excom, and three
Men's and Women's Council posi
tions.
To increase efficiency, several by
law changes and constitutionaJ
clarifications have been submitted to
the ASSU Executive Committee.
Among these is the proposal that, if
there arc less than four candidates

running for an office, primaries be
eliminated and the preferential sys
tem be substituted. A clarification is
sought for the question of whether
seniors in graduate school should
cast votes for senior class or grad

school officers. These proposals are
still pending Excom decision.
A major problem confronting
the election board is (hat of pre
venting student apathy toward
campus elections. Realizing that
effective student government can
not exist in an uninterested uni
versity, it carries on an extensive
publicity campaign of its own.
In order to make elections less of
a burden on students, the length of
time from initial campaigning to the
final elections has been cut. from
3 ] /2 to 2'/■> weeks.
Nominations for the spring ballot
ing will open April 5 and close April
7, followed by declinations April 8.
The primaries will be held April 15
and the big day of final elections will
be April 21.
