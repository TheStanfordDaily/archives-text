# SOVIET 'SLY MANEUVER'
## Russian Bid to Join NATO Rejected by United States 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 31 (UP) —Russia offered today to join
the anti-Communist North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but the
United States promptly rejected the bid as a sly maneuver to
undermine Western security.
A State Department spokesman said the Moscow proposal,

which was labeled "astound-'
ing" in diplomatic circles here,
inspires no coniidence among
the free nations in view of Russia's
"iron grip" on "its captive peoples."
"It is a maneuver to gain admit
tance within the walls of the West,
to undermine its security," a
spokesman said.
A reporter asked if the statement
amounted to a formal U.S. rejection
of the Soviet proposal, which was
based on the condition that the
United States drop its Western Eu
ropean army plan and sign an all-
European security pact.
"This is it (the rejection)," the
spokesman replied.
He was unable to say whether the
United States had consulted with
Britain and France before issuing
the statement.
The Kremlin proposal was con
tained in identical lft-page notes
handed to U.S. Ambassador
Charles E. Bohlen and the French
and British envoys in Moscow.
The note contained a violent de
nunciation of the proposed six-na
tion West European army which is
designed to guard against possible
Red aggression. Instead, Russia pro
posed an all - European security
treaty.
Russia said it would be willing to
consider joining NATO if the Unit
ed States would join its proposed
European pact. It also repeated the
familiar Soviet warnings about the
heavy burdens of the East - West
arms race and the dangers of atomic
war.
The State Department acted
with almost unprecedented speed
in rejecting the Soviet proposal,
an indication of how little faith it
put in Russia's good will.
Private comment by diplomatic
officials was even stronger.
"I think it would be awfully nice
to sec Gen. Gruenther in command
of Soviet armies," one official said
sarcastically. Gen. Alfred M.
Gruenther, an American officer, is
supreme commander of NATO
armies.
