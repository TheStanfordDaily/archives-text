## Hazards Of Traffic Cited 
### PAT KING 
The Executive Committee last
night heard a report by Rudy Reich,
chairman of the Hazards Commit
tee, in which he cited the Toyon-
Stern intersection at Escondido and
Arguello as one of the major cam
pus hazards.
Reich's committee imported that
drivers coming out of the Toyon
parking lot are unable to sec on
coming traffic flue to the shrubs
along the side of the road. In ad
dition, cars going through that inter
section often fail to stop at the ar
terial signs, he said.
The committee report suggested
painting parking lines in the lot by
Stern, placing a bicycle rack at En
gineering corner, painting a white
line down Embarcadero, and install
ing safety doors which one pushes
to open at Engineering and History
Corners.
Excom voted to approve the report
and submit it to the President's of
fice for consideration.
In other business Excom passed
changes in the procedure for ASSU
elections which were presented by
Election Board Chairman Larry Tar
low. Members aiso approved his sug
gestion that the spring quarter
ASSU primary elections be moved
back from Thursday, April 15, to
Wednesday, April 15, and the ASSU
final elections moved forward from
Wednesday, April 21, to Thursday,
April 22.
Tarlow explained that the change
in election dates was necessary to
allow candidates in the final election
time to visit all the large dormi
tories.
