# Sunken Logs—Parking Markers

### 

PARKING RELlEF—During the vacation period Corporation Yard workers installed log parking
markers in the parking lot behind the Main Library. The lot has long been a headache for driv
ers, because, due to the gravel-like surface, parking lines are soon obliterated by cars. The
logs, though they appear semicircular, are actually a full circle half-implanted in the concrete.
They are installed that way to withstand the bumps of many motorists' cars.
