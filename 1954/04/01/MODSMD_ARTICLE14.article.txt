# New Research Center Leases Eleven Acres of Farm Property
## Old Lathrop Home Is Site 
### 
The site of the old Lathrop
Home, overlooking Lake Lagu
nita and the heart of the campus,
has officially been selected as
he location for a center devoted
to the study of behavioral sci
ences to be financed by the
Ford Foundation, it was con
firmed by Stanford officials late
yesterday afternoon.
Final lease arrangements for the
11-acre hilltop site were completed
by officials of the University and of
the Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences, Inc. about
4:30 p.m., terminating negotiations
that had gone on for several months.
Details of the lease were not made
public.
Dedicated to studying aspects of
human behavior in such fields as
economics, anthropology, political
science and social psychology, the
Center expects to put its research
work into full stride by the time
the University reconvenes for fall.
The old Lathrop mansion will be
razed to make way for a number of
low-lying, wide-windowed build
ings that will be the offices and lab
oratories for the advanced study
cehter. Construction of the new
buildings is expected to begin May
1, with completion hopefully set for
Sept. 1.
As an initial grant, the Ford Foun
dation has extended $3.5 million to
the non-profit corporation.
Welcoming the decision to settle
on University land, President J.
E. Wallace Sterling said:
"The Center will be a great cul
tural addition to the Bay Area and
we welcome its location at Stan
ford. As near neighbors, I am sure
both the* Center and the University
will derive mutual benefits."
Dr. Ralph W. Tyler, who will di
rect the center, stated the decision to
j locate on the spacious, tree-spotted
j Lathrop site was made because of
j the climate and the proximity to
i several large universities and to San
j Francisco.
Dr. Tyler said it will be the plan
of the center to bring together
each year about 50 selected schol
ars who will be encouraged to
initiate research that will "con
tribute to the development of the
| scientific study of man."
The ultimate goals of the center
are four-fold, the director said. They
are:
1. To increase as rapidly as pos
sible the number of highly trained
scholars and scientists dealing
with problems of human behavior.
2. To provide further opportuni
ties for advanced training for
present faculty members in the
nation's educational system.
3. To encourage collaboration
a c ross traditional department,
lines.
4. To make available new de
signs and materials for advanced
research training for use in grad
uate schools throughout the coun
try.
Dr. Tyler is former dean of the
Division of Social Sciences at the
University of Chicago.
A Stanford faculty member wlx>
figured prominently in the planning
j of the center is Dr. Robert R. Sears,
' executive head of the psychology
department and member nf the board
of directors of the center.
The center filed incorporation
papers March 18 of this year.


RESEARCH CENTERâ€”This is the architect's dream of how the Center for Advanced Study in
Behavioral Sciences will look when it is opened, probably this September. The Center, financed
by the Ford Foundation, will conduct research on man's behavior.
