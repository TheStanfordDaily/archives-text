# New Stanford Cage Coach Will Be Named Tomorrow
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Stanford's new basketball
coach will definitely be appoint
ed tomorrow, The Daily has
learned — and the three men
named as the leading candi
dates for the position are still
interested in the job.
Athletic Director A 1 Masters has
called for a meeting of the Staff
Committee of the Stanford Athletic
Board at noon tomorrow. He will
recommend a man to take the place
of retiring Coach Bob Burnett, who
recently announced his resignation.
The committee is expected to
approve the name without delay,
and it will then be submitted for
acceptance at the full Board
meeting an hour later. A source
close to the department said he
''expected absolutely no trouble at
all" at either the committee wi
the Board meeting.
The three men named as the lead
ing candidates for the job are Min
neapolis Laker star Jim Pollard,
Colorado coach H. B. Lee, and
Pennsylvania coach Howie Dallmar.
Pollard has already said that he is
interested in retiring from the
champion Lakers and coming to
Stanford. The Daily last night con
tacted the other two candidates, and
they both still indicated interest.
Lee was readied in Manhatten,
Kansas, where he is the guest of
Kansas State coach Tex Winter.
Lee admitted two things: that he
had seen Masters on the Athletic
Director's recent trip cast, and

that he had spoken to him at least
one time since by telephone.
Lee indicated he was interested
in the Stanford job, even though he
said "it would be difficult for me to
say an out-and-out 'yes' because of
my position at Colorado." Unlike
Pollard, who can remain as a Laker
star as long as he pleases, Lee ap
parently feels that his job as coach
at Colorado might be in jeopardy
were he to openly admit, applying
for the Stanford job and then not be
selected.
Lee graduated from Stanford in
1938, and was assistant coach under
Everett Dean for three years. He
then moved to Utah, where he was
mentor until he was succeeded by
Burnett. Now, the situation may be
reversed and he may replace the
Indian coach.
Dallmar was contacted at his
home in Philadelphia. He was not
as subtle as Lee. and said outright
that he was interested in the job
here. It is no secret that in the
big basketball town of Philadel
phia, which includes the heavy
' proselyting teams of LaSalle,
i Temple, and St. Joseph's, he is re
, quired to adhere as strictly to
the recruiting rules as Stanford
i coaches.
Besides the above-mentioned can
didates, several other names have
received prominence from among
the more than 50 applications re
ceived by the Athletic Department.
Leon Lafaille, a Stanford graduate
who has been a successful coach at
Modesto Junior College, is consid
ered a possibility. Two other new
names, though probably not as like
ly, are former basketball star Jack
O'Sullivan and Gay Bryan, now
coach at East Contra Costa JC.
Also mentioned for the job is Ken
Pagans, who coached George Sel
leck at Compton High and is con
sidered one of the outstanding high
school coaches in the nation.

Board at noon tomorrow. He will
recommend a man to take the place
of retiring Coach Bob Burnett, who
recently announced his resignation.
The committee is expected to
approve the name without delay,
and it will then be submitted for
acceptance at the full Board
meeting an hour later. A source
close to the department said he
''expected absolutely no trouble at
all" at either the committee wi
the Board meeting.
The three men named as the lead
ing candidates for the job are Min
neapolis Laker star Jim Pollard,
Colorado coach H. B. Lee, and
Pennsylvania coach Howie Dallmar.
Pollard has already said that he is
interested in retiring from the
champion Lakers and coming to
Stanford. The Daily last night con
tacted the other two candidates, and
they both still indicated interest.
Lee was readied in Manhatten,
Kansas, where he is the guest of
Kansas State coach Tex Winter.
Lee admitted two things: that he
had seen Masters on the Athletic
Director's recent trip cast, and

that he had spoken to him at least
one time since by telephone.
Lee indicated he was interested
in the Stanford job, even though he
said "it would be difficult for me to
say an out-and-out 'yes' because of
my position at Colorado." Unlike
Pollard, who can remain as a Laker
star as long as he pleases, Lee ap
parently feels that his job as coach
at Colorado might be in jeopardy
were he to openly admit, applying
for the Stanford job and then not be
selected.
Lee graduated from Stanford in
1938, and was assistant coach under
Everett Dean for three years. He
then moved to Utah, where he was
mentor until he was succeeded by
Burnett. Now, the situation may be
reversed and he may replace the
Indian coach.
Dallmar was contacted at his
home in Philadelphia. He was not
as subtle as Lee. and said outright
that he was interested in the job
here. It is no secret that in the
big basketball town of Philadel
phia, which includes the heavy
' proselyting teams of LaSalle,
i Temple, and St. Joseph's, he is re
, quired to adhere as strictly to
the recruiting rules as Stanford
i coaches.
Besides the above-mentioned can
didates, several other names have
received prominence from among
the more than 50 applications re
ceived by the Athletic Department.
Leon Lafaille, a Stanford graduate
who has been a successful coach at
Modesto Junior College, is consid
ered a possibility. Two other new
names, though probably not as like
ly, are former basketball star Jack
O'Sullivan and Gay Bryan, now
coach at East Contra Costa JC.
Also mentioned for the job is Ken
Pagans, who coached George Sel
leck at Compton High and is con
sidered one of the outstanding high
school coaches in the nation.
Stanford's new basketball
coach will definitely be appoint
ed tomorrow, The Daily has
learned — and the three men
named as the leading candi
dates for the position are still
interested in the job.
