# HONOR CODE
## 2 Students Found Guilty 
### 
The Council for Student Control
convicted two students of Honor
Code violations in cases heard near
the end of last quarter. A third stu
dent was declared innocent of the
Honor Code charge brought against
her.
One of the students convicted was
expelled from the University. She
had taken credit for one paper in
two English classes, without receiv
ing prior permission from the in
structor.
The expelled student, who was
suspended two quarters last year for
a different Honor Code violation,
was the second student ever con
victed of two Honor Code violations.
She was also on social probation.
A second student, who admitted
copying an English theme from a
theme in a fraternity file, was sen
tenced to an F in the course. Under
the Honor Code, it is a form of un
permitted aid to take crcdit for
work that is not original.
