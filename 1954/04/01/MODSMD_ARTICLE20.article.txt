### 
WASHINGTON, March 31 (UP) â€”
President Eisenhower gave full
backing today to Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles' call for "united
action" to bar Red domination of
Southeast Asia.
He refused to say, however,
whether U.S. troops might be used
or to spell out what other kind of
free world action Dulles had in
mind.
Eisenhower told his news confer
ence that he was in agreement with
every word of Dulles' speech stating
Amei'ica's determination to block
Communist expansion in Southeast
Asia by "whatever means."
A.;ked if united action might mean
direct use of U.S. troops, the Presi
dent said he could not give a gen
eral rule. He recalled his repeated
statements that it would be foolish
to use American ground or other
forces to meet 6veiy situation
throughout the world.
The President's statement came as
informed sources revealed the ad
ministration is .seriously worried
about a recent step-up in aid by
Russia and Communist China to
Communist-led rebels in Indochina.
