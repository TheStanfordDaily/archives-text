## Some Questions for America 
### 
An open letter to "Young Americans," pub
lished in a recent copy of jeunesse, monthly
publication of the Swiss YMCA, asks some
questions we have been trying to answer ever
since we first read the letter.
The questions, sometimes penetrating and
often embarrassing, are typical of those asked
by Europeans of all ages and all opinions to
visiting Americans. They are difficult to an
swer partially the criticism they im
ply is valid, and partially because the best of
what America stands for cannot be summarized
in simple phrases.
But answer we must, difficult as the task of
answering may be. For until we know why
Ihe society we are fighting to preserve is worth
preserving, we cannot ask others to join with
us in that fight.
Jeunesse's "Message to Young Americans"
reads in part:
"We know very little about your world. We
know the 'civilization' of your businessmen.
We owe them Coca-Cola, chewing gum, the
Header's Digest, and neon lights. Their eco
nomic dictatorship, their gigantic publicity,
presses slogans into the minds of people with
the intensity of club blows. We watch with
anguish and anxiety as they level the spirit of
legions of young Europeans. . . .

"We are told sometimes that there are young
people in America who do not allow them
selves to fall in the trap, who refuse to be
dragged into a collectivist universe, which
bears resemblance as a brother might, to the
Communist universe.
"Is it not the ideal of Communism, to give
each one an automobile, a house, a refrigerator
and to form for each one a standard taste and
standard needs? Toward what are you work
ing?
"Is it not Marxism which seeks man's 'raison
d'etre' in materialism and through materialism?
And where do you seek man's 'raison d'etre'?
"We may very possibly be mistaken. We
may see nothing of America except its facade.
You may be, young Christians, the salt of
America, and your voice may possibly be
smothered. *
"Tell us then in what America takes pride.
Tell us what it is elsewhere than in the posses
sion of the hydrogen bomb, elsewhere than in
naval, air, or scientific superiority. . . .
"It is certainly easy for us to believe, Amer
icans, that you are nourished with preserved
food, saiujated by television, and that you be
lieve in the omnipotence of the atom.
"That is why we ask you, young Americans,
our brothers, to manifest yourselves."

by Europeans of all ages and all opinions to
visiting Americans. They are difficult to an
swer partially the criticism they im
ply is valid, and partially because the best of
what America stands for cannot be summarized
in simple phrases.
But answer we must, difficult as the task of
answering may be. For until we know why
Ihe society we are fighting to preserve is worth
preserving, we cannot ask others to join with
us in that fight.
Jeunesse's "Message to Young Americans"
reads in part:
"We know very little about your world. We
know the 'civilization' of your businessmen.
We owe them Coca-Cola, chewing gum, the
Header's Digest, and neon lights. Their eco
nomic dictatorship, their gigantic publicity,
presses slogans into the minds of people with
the intensity of club blows. We watch with
anguish and anxiety as they level the spirit of
legions of young Europeans. . . .

"We are told sometimes that there are young
people in America who do not allow them
selves to fall in the trap, who refuse to be
dragged into a collectivist universe, which
bears resemblance as a brother might, to the
Communist universe.
"Is it not the ideal of Communism, to give
each one an automobile, a house, a refrigerator
and to form for each one a standard taste and
standard needs? Toward what are you work
ing?
"Is it not Marxism which seeks man's 'raison
d'etre' in materialism and through materialism?
And where do you seek man's 'raison d'etre'?
"We may very possibly be mistaken. We
may see nothing of America except its facade.
You may be, young Christians, the salt of
America, and your voice may possibly be
smothered. *
"Tell us then in what America takes pride.
Tell us what it is elsewhere than in the posses
sion of the hydrogen bomb, elsewhere than in
naval, air, or scientific superiority. . . .
"It is certainly easy for us to believe, Amer
icans, that you are nourished with preserved
food, saiujated by television, and that you be
lieve in the omnipotence of the atom.
"That is why we ask you, young Americans,
our brothers, to manifest yourselves."
