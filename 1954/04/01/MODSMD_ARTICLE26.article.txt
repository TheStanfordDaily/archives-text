# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
THURSDAY GRAB BAG
The Union Formal last quarter almost needed a
chaperone to chaperone the chaperone. The patron
was Dr. Peter Pranken of the Physics Dept. When
he tried to get a drink at the patty, the bartender
blurted:
"Sorry, bud. You don't look 21 to me."
SUN VALLEY SPLITS DKPT.: Ronny Brown, one

of the ranking characters at Man
/ariita, took the "learn to ski
week" vacation at Sun Valley.
On the first day of ski classes,
Sun Valley's ace corps of ski in
structors were sifting Aut the 120
• kiers to see what degree class
each should be in.
"Okay," yelled Leif, the
bronzed Norwegian ski master,
"make five turns down the hill."
Ronny negotiated the five turns

and noticed that the whole 120 were buzzing furi
ously.
"Gosh," she thought, "1 must have done pretty well
to ause all that comment!"
"Er-I beg your pardon, Miss Brown," said Leif,
"but I believe your ski pants just split from top to
bottom on that last turn." .
QUOTABLE QUOTES DEPT.: An engineering
student, after walking out of a thermodynamics final
last quarter, sighed, "Well, that was a complete
course. What wasn't covered in the text, and in the
lectures, was covered in the final."
INSIDE STORY: As they say in the Hearst papers,
now it can he told. When Norma, the red-headed
cynic of the Oaks kept complaining that no one ever
swept the leaves, the other inmates got together and

bopght her a rake, thereby providing Stanford wilh
a sequel to "The Man With a Hoe."
HISTORIC KISS: A Stanford junior let his girl ofl
at one of the Row houses, and before bidding her
goodnight, indulged in a kiss. Although no statistical
data has been kept in these matters, it is believed to
have been the longest kiss in Stanford history.
You see, their dental braces got entangled.
QUARTET: Eileen Conaghan, Daily start' artist,
laughed as she left for Sun Valley, "Well, it looks
like I'm the only healthy one in the family. My three
brothers are all wearing casts, one from baseball,
one from football, and one from skiing."
Eileen became the fourth immobile Conaghan as
she appeared in reg line with her ankle encased in
white plaster of paris.
SUMMER TRAVEL DEPT.: We've never been
enthusiastic about tours, but we came across two
that should be real goodies. They are led by Dr.
Alfred Sumner and Dr. James Watkins, whom we
consider to be the best two profs we've had at Stan
lord.
Geographer Sumner, now at San Francisco State,
is going to lead a world air tour with Dr. Terrien,
the sociologist who last year taught at Stanford. This
is the first tour of its type in the world, and there are
few men more capable of leading it than Sumner
and Terrien.
The other tour, the only official Stanford tour, is
being shepherded by the dry-witted Watkins and
his wife. The well-traveled Watkins, an expert in
international relations, is now trying to arrange a
meeting with Tito for the tour. The tour is much
cheaper than most.
