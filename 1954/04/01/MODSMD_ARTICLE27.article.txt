## Equal Treatment for a Vital Issue 
### 
To the Editor:
In an article published in the March 30 issue of The
Daily, Prof. Ronald Hilton comments on the attitude
of the Latin American countries toward the U.S.
during the Tenth Pan-American Conference. He
points out that 16 of these countries voted for the
U.S.-sponsored resolution, declaring that communism
was a menace to the Americas, because they ex
pected some economic support in return. Prof. Hilton
labels such an operation "Horse-Trading" and thinks
that it does not make much sense.
Prof. Hilton has failed to mention the behind-the
scenes political and economic pressures the U.S.
was exerting on most of these nations. I believe that
the main reason for which the 16 Latin American
countries voted with the U.S. was not so much be
cause they expected more U.S. aid but rather they
wanted to retain what they already had. They knew
well that if they countered with the resolution, the
U.S. would tighten its economic grip on them and
the results would be well near economic and finan
cial strangulation.
Rut suppose that these countries were "Horse
trading," why does it seem so senseless in (his par
ticular case when the IT.S.l T .S. defense policy is prac
tically in its whole part, T>ased on this kind of
operation? When the U.S. gave Franco of Spain
or Tito of Yugoslavia or even England economic
and financial help, the reasons were not because
they liked Franco or Tito but because the latter
gave them in return air bases and strategic po
sitions.
Is not this "horse-trading?" If so, then I believe
we are entitled to request from Pi of. Hilton an ex
planation as to where on the scale of international
discrimination do the Latin American countries rank.
It. is true that the U.S. is "horse-trading" for the
noble cause of fighting communism, but to the Latin
American countries their economic survival is also
a noble cause and they are entitled to fight for it
as the U.S. does in trying to survive the Communist
menace.
Let me, if I may, answer briefly the three points

that Prof. Hilton employs to describe the attitude
of the Latin American countries toward communism:
1) He says that Latin Americans are not interested
in the world situation and that they have an "isola
tionist mentality." I think that this is wholly exag
gerated. The Latin American countries have been
active in world politics, probably not as aggressively
as the U.S. but they are doing their best within the
limits of their capabilities. Let me remind Prof. Hil
ton that if it were not for the 20 Latin American
votes in the General Assembly of the U.N., which is
one-third of the total vote of that organization, the
U.S. would not have been able to pass one single
resolution, since it takes at least two-thirds to win
a vote.
2) Prof. Hilton says also that Latin Americans do
not see a menace in communism. Again I think this
is greatly misunderstood. It is true that they do not
get panicky about it, nor have congressional in
vestigations, but they have always opposed it and
in most of these countries the Communist party
is outlawed. That is why in many of the larger
countries, among them, there are less communists
than in the U.S. itself.
3) Prof. Hilton describes the Conference as a bat
tle between two sides. The 1!) Latin American votes
ganged up on the single vote of the U.S. This is
clearly disproved in the record of voting. The U.S.
won the first vote to put the Communist resolution
fust on the agenda instead of the Argentine-sponsored
resolution on Colonialism. It also won the vote on the
Communist resolution by 17-1. It lost the vote or
rather abstained on the question of Colonialism which
it opposed. It might have lost on other minor votes,
but it is clear that she won on the great issues. This
clearly disproves the idea that she was standing alone.
The U.S., in my opinion, has shown a poor and
selfish attitude at the Conference when Secretary
Dulles left as soon a<; he phased his resolution. The
Colonial issue is as vital to the Americans as
the Communist issue is to the U.S. Dulles should
have stayed to discuss it. It shouid be a matter of
mutual understanding and equal treatment.
