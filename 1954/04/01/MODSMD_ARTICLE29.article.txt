## 
### J. A. HUNLEY 
Stanford has beaten Cal in
the Big Game three times dur
ing the last four years. That is,
the ASSU Speech Association
has beaten Cal in the "debating
big game" three times during
the last four years in over 50
years of competition.
The ASSU Speech Association
was formerly called the* ASSU De
bating Society. However, the De
bating Society was reorganized and
the name changed because its mem
bers wanted to take on other activi
ties besides debating, and they felt
that the old name might be mislead
ing.
The Speech Association is a stu
dent organization with a president,
Dave Jacobsen; a business man
ager, Virginia Patterson; and two
secretaries, Marilyn Myers and Ar
liss Barnes.
It is divided into several com
mittees, including one for discus
sion, headed by Glen West; one
for debate, headed by Dave Ja
cobsen; one for intramural activi
ties, beaded by Ed Ardziooni; and

! one for public relations, beaded
by Don Webster. The faculty ad
viser i.s llr. Anthony llillhruoer of
the Department of Speech and
Drama. ,
The main purpose of the Speech
Association is to promote student
speaking activities of different kinds;
on and off campus. Another is to
stimulate interest in speaking, dis
cussion, and debate on topical
events.
The Speech Association is a
busy organization and sponsors
many campus activities. Among
these are: student-faculty sympo
siums, such as the one held last
quarter, which dealt with Con
gressional investigations; a series
of programs over KZSU, dealing
1 with current events; and, this
year, the Oxford-Stanford debate
for the Tuesday Evening Series.
To further their purpose of en
couraging .speaking activities, the
association holds several contests
each year. These include the West-
I ern Civ panel discussion, which was
I held on Feb. 24 this year; the
i Speech 20 extemporaneous speaking
contest, which is held every quar
tet; and the annual after-dinner
I speaking contest held in conjunc

tion with the eating clubs.
The association begins each fall
quarter by sponsoring a high school
seminar-discussion-debate tourna
ment on campus.
Other oH-campus affairs which
they participate in are the foren
sic tournaments held each quar
ter. Stanford also belongs to the
Northern California Forensic As
sociation and takes part in month
ly discussions, radio programs, and
a Student Congress in the spring.
