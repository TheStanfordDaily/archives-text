# Wood Lost to Track Team As Michigan Meet Looms
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Gerry Wood, who was considered Stanford's best bet for a first
place against Michigan, will not compete against the talent-packed
Wolverine track aggregation Saturday in the Stadium.
Wood, one of the top collegian high hurdlers, is still out of

action with a pulledlletg t muscle.
Wood missed the Indians' UB-G3 tri
umph over Fresno State last week
in the Cards' season opener.
Although Saturday's meet will be
Michigan's first outdoor dual, the
Maize and Blue spikers have just
completed a three - month indoor
season in lhe Midwest, finishing sec
ond to Illinois in the Big Ten meet.
The Illini had to win a nip-and
tuck relay to overcome Michigan
in their dual meet earlier in the
year. And this is the Illinois team
some observers think may de
throne USC in the nationals.
The Wolverines will come in by
plane tomorrow evening, and their
first clockings on the cinders this
year*will be their actual meet times.
Michigan's indoor confinement
and plane trip are about the only
encouraging factors for Stanford this
week. If the Wolverines' listed
marks are any indication, the In
dians will have a hard time nabbing
a first place.
Keith Brownsherger in the 22(1
and Jim Luttrell in the high har
riers appear to have the best
chance to win for Stanford.
There will be no javelin competi
tion, one ot Stanford's strongest
events, because spear throwing is
outlawed in the Big Ten.
The visitors, however, may miss
the familiar boards, and the run
ners, particularly the sprinters and
the hurdlers, may have difficulty
with the longer outdoor distances.
