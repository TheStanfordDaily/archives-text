# Al Talboy's Batting Rampage Wins Athlete of Week Award
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
A 1 Talboy, sharp-hitting Stanford
right-fielder, is the first Daily Ath
lete of the Week this quarter as a
result of his five-ior-seven barrage
against UCLA last weekend.
Going into last weekend's series,
Talboy was in the throes of a mild
batting slump, but he came roaring
out of it Friday, pounding out two
of Stanford's six hits and driving in
two of the Cards' four tallies.
On Saturday, he led Stanford's
13-hit barrage with two singles
aiul a double and scored one of
the Cards' four runs.
Talboy is well known to local
fans. He starred in basketball and
baseball for Palo Alto High. He
arrived at Stanford via the great
circle route, however, going to Men
lo JC and San Jose State before
arriving at the Farm two years ago.
This circuitous study trail almost
cost him his eligibility. There was
some debate as to whether he had
enough units to graduate at the end
of winter quarter this year, but for
tunately for Card fans, when the
returns from the outlying precincts
were counted, the blond right-field -
er *»*ked a few units of the required
number.
Talboy batted third in last
year's potent aggregation, but his
.270 hitting was somewhat over
shadowed by the power of Esse
gian, Sliepard, Swarts, etc. This
year he is sticking ..'l*ls over-all,
and his .714 naturally leads the
CIBA.
He is not an over-powering hit
ter, but like his teammate Warren
Goodrich, he combines a good eye
with the ability to always get a
fairly solid chunk of the ball to push
through more than his share of
base hits.
In the field, he is not especially
fast, but he plays a smart game. He
can fill in at any position on the
diamond. He has yet to make an
error at Stanford. *
