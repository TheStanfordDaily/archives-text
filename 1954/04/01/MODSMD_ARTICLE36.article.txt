## From the Sidelines

"Pretty good," we overheard trie tali, blonu man :n the white
sports shirt say. "Pretty darned good for a college baseball team.
I like that shortstop, and the pitching looks mighty sharp to me."
This was just another man's brief opinionated endeavor on the
performance of the Stanford baseball team at Westwood last week
end, we surmised. But whoever he*

was, we certainly agreed with him.
For the Indian horsehiders, in
beating UCLA, 4-2 and 4-1, cer
tainly didn't give any indication
that they might not be equally as
strong contenders for the CIBA title
this year as they were last year
when they tied USC lor the loop
lead.
The manner in which the dia
mondmen garnered their victories
last weekend was certainly not
remini .cent of the way in which
Shepard. Esstyfian, Swarts and Co.
powered their way to Omaha last
year, what with the little white
pellet Hying out of the Sunken
Diamond every time you turned
your head.
The way this year's crew has gone
about the business of winning ball
games has been in a slightly less im
pressive and quieter fashion, but to
this corner's way of thinking, an
even more effective way: with tr<?-
mendonus pitching and very tight
fielding support.
The hill performances oi Ray
Young and Phil Page against the
Bruins on Friday and Saturday past
were really of top-notch quality.
Which brings us to one of base
ball's oldest and most popular be
liefs: that pitching is 40, 50. or
even (50 per cent of the game of
baseball. Whatever the figure,
we'd like to believe that the old
adage will hold true once again
this season. If so, Young, Page,
Acker, Brown, and DeLong (who,
we think, comprise by far the
strongest pitching quintet on this

coast), should prove very instru
mental in upsetting the pre-sea
son CIBA dope sheet, which
places USC head and shoulders
above the rest of the league.
The Indian nine takes bn the
"power-laden" Trojans in a twin
bill following a single tilt with UCLA
on Friday. USC brings with it a
supposedly awesome array of slug
gers-, including catcher John Garten,

third from the top in the CIBA bat
ting race last year, and a sensational
sophomore outfielder, Tony Santino
of San Francisco.
But the -Trojans aren't too long or
too strong on the pitching, which we
believe to be the all-important fac
tor when a team plays three games
over a two-day period (SC plays
Cal on Friday).
Moreover, Trojan power may be
greatly overrated, according to the
slightly bitter remarks of Santa
Clara Coach Chuck Bedolla, whose
1 Broncos lost two games to the Tro
jans last weekend.
Bedolla said, "The Trojan power
J isn't all it's cracked up to be. Most
1 of them can't hit the curve ball."
Well, Stanford's pitchers thrive on
; the curve ball. So we shall see . . .
And so, by maximizing the Indian
strong points and minimizing the
opposition's, we've built up a good
case for ourselves in the forthcom
ing weekend series. We think the
Cards will cop two out of three this
weekend. We think they'll give SC
and the rest a good race for the
! CIBA crown. The pitching looks
! "pretty good."
P.S. We found out who the man
l was we overheard the other day:
| Bill Veeck, the former owner of the
! Cleveland Indians and the St. Louis
1 Browns.
