# AEC CHAIRMAN:
## H-Bomb Can Cripple NYC 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 31
(UP)—Chairman Lewis L. Strauss
of the Atomic Energy Commis
sion said today the United States
now can make giant hydrogen
bombs powerful enough to
knock out metropolitan New
York or any city in the world.
Strauss made the electrifying
statement at President Eisenhower's
weekly news conference after giv
ing the first official report on the
current hydrogen tests in the Pa
cific. It jarred even Mr. Eisenhow
er, who shook his head and stared
gravely at the floor.
In reply to world-wide demands
for some idea of the tremendous
destructive power of the H-bomb,
Strauss declared quietly and delib
erately that the weapon "can be
made to be as large as you wish, as
large as the military requirement
demands . . . large enough to take
out (destroy) a city."
The White House said later that in
using the word "destroy" Strauss
meant to "put a city out of com
mission—not level it."
