# British OK Sought

LONDON, March 31 (UP)â€”Presi
dent Eisenhower urged Prime Min
ister Winston Churchill not to op
pose the American H-bomb tests
which have brought fierce Labor
party opposition against U.S. policy,
it was disclosed today.
But so intense was the Socialist
rebellion that Churchill yielded and
set next Monday for a major debate
in which he will state Britain's "po
sition and policy" on U.S. H-bomb
development.
In a statement issued after an
emergency cabinet meeting today,
Churchill said:
"I propose to make a further
statement myself and to describe,
first of all, the position which this
country occupies and, secondly, the
policy which we arc adopting in the
face of these circumstances."
Churchill bowed when Socialist
rebels refused to accept his plea in
Parliament yesterday not to impede
American progress toward "over
whelming" strength in hydrogen
bombs.
Authoritative sources said the
Prime Minister took a moderate
stand because Mr. Eisenhower had
asked him not to press the United
States at this critical stage of ther
monuclear development.
Churchill himself hinted that his
statement followed talks with the
President, since he said he had been
in "almost hourly contact" with the
White House.
He warned Commons that it
would be a great, disservice to the
free world if America was hindered
in building up its H-bomb strength.
But a mounting outcry in opposi
tion circles and in the press showed
extreme dissatisfaction with his pa
tient attitude.
