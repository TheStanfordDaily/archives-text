# U.N. Defense Delivered By Mrs. F.D.R.
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Eleanor Roosevelt, the worn-j
an who was the first lady of the
land, and who has since become
the first lady of the world, told
1,400 in San Mateo that the Unit
ed Nations is "a sheer neces
sity."
Speaking under the auspices of
the American Association for the
United Nations at San Mateo High
School auditorium, Mrs. Roosevelt
said:
"The world has grown so small
through modernized transportation
and communication that we have to
learn to get along together. Cer
tainly, we have learned to destroy
each other so well that we must
learn to get along together."
After her talk, Mrs. Roosevelt
told The Daily, "I have noticed a
considerably heightened interest
in the United Nations in this
country the past year."
Mrs. Roosevelt, wearing a rust
knit dress and a black hat, answered
questions from the floor after her
talk. When queried whether Red
China should be admitted to the
U.N., the lady who lived in the
White House 13 years said:
"As far'as Red China being ad
mitted now, that would be quite
impossible, since the U.N. is at
war with Red China. However, I
do not discount admittance in the
future. Who knows what the fu
ture holds? China must meet cer
tain qualifications. First, she must
prove she is a peace-loving na
tion."
When asked on how the hysteria
about UNESCO in the southern part
of the state and in certain school
boards should be eombatted, she
said, "The only way to meet the
hysteria about UNESCO is with
knowledge. Knowledge does away
with fear which leads to hysteria.
"Some assert that the United Na
tions' Educational, Scientific, and
Cultural Organization is, Commu
nist-controlled. This, to me, is an
interesting concept. Because, you
see, the Russians aren't interested
enough to put a representative in
UNESCO. And since the- Russians
don't have a vote, and the only way
you can control UNESCO is with
a majority of votes, I am wonder
ing how the Organization can be
Communist-controlled."
Mrs. Roosevelt answered the
critics of the U.N. by saying, "A
lot of people are disappointed in
the U.N. Remember that you can't
enforce peace. You have to build
an atmosphere in which peace can
grow. The machinery was set up
in I!)4fiL But the machinery won't
work alone.
"The will has to be there. Wc
| aren't going to cease having difficul
! ties because all the nations arc sig
i natorics of the U.N. Charter. There
i still will be disagreements. But
j without that machinery we can have
; no hope of growing together."

of the state and in certain school
boards should be eombatted, she
said, "The only way to meet the
hysteria about UNESCO is with
knowledge. Knowledge does away
with fear which leads to hysteria.
"Some assert that the United Na
tions' Educational, Scientific, and
Cultural Organization is, Commu
nist-controlled. This, to me, is an
interesting concept. Because, you
see, the Russians aren't interested
enough to put a representative in
UNESCO. And since the- Russians
don't have a vote, and the only way
you can control UNESCO is with
a majority of votes, I am wonder
ing how the Organization can be
Communist-controlled."
Mrs. Roosevelt answered the
critics of the U.N. by saying, "A
lot of people are disappointed in
the U.N. Remember that you can't
enforce peace. You have to build
an atmosphere in which peace can
grow. The machinery was set up
in I!)4fiL But the machinery won't
work alone.
"The will has to be there. Wc
| aren't going to cease having difficul
! ties because all the nations arc sig
i natorics of the U.N. Charter. There
i still will be disagreements. But
j without that machinery we can have
; no hope of growing together."
Eleanor Roosevelt, the worn-j
an who was the first lady of the
land, and who has since become
the first lady of the world, told
1,400 in San Mateo that the Unit
ed Nations is "a sheer neces
sity."
Speaking under the auspices of
the American Association for the
United Nations at San Mateo High
School auditorium, Mrs. Roosevelt
said:
"The world has grown so small
through modernized transportation
and communication that we have to
learn to get along together. Cer
tainly, we have learned to destroy
each other so well that we must
learn to get along together."
After her talk, Mrs. Roosevelt
told The Daily, "I have noticed a
considerably heightened interest
in the United Nations in this
country the past year."
Mrs. Roosevelt, wearing a rust
knit dress and a black hat, answered
questions from the floor after her
talk. When queried whether Red
China should be admitted to the
U.N., the lady who lived in the
White House 13 years said:
"As far'as Red China being ad
mitted now, that would be quite
impossible, since the U.N. is at
war with Red China. However, I
do not discount admittance in the
future. Who knows what the fu
ture holds? China must meet cer
tain qualifications. First, she must
prove she is a peace-loving na
tion."
When asked on how the hysteria
about UNESCO in the southern part
of the state and in certain school
boards should be eombatted, she
said, "The only way to meet the
hysteria about UNESCO is with
knowledge. Knowledge does away
with fear which leads to hysteria.
