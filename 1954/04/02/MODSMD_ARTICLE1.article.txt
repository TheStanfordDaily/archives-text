H-BOMB CLOUDâ€”One of the first pictures released
by the Federal Civil Defense Administration shows
the H-Bomb explosion in November, 1952. Official

films and newspaper photographs of the blast at
the Pacific testing grounds revealed that the bomb
completely destroyed the test island. The cloud

pictured rose 25 miles in the air and spread over
100 miles. It was the largest nuclear "fireball" ever
produced. (Second picture on page 2.)
