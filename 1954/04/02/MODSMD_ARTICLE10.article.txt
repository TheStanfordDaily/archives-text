# Indians to Host Michigan Stars In Dual Meet
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
I lie Maize and Blue fly into Cali
fornia tonight, and Stanford track
men may think the Wolverines are
still flying come post time (1:30 p.m.
for field events and 2 p.m. for the
mile) in the Stadium tomorrow.
In other words, trackwise, the
Wolverines are loaded. And the In
dians aren't.
Stanford Athletic Publicist Don
Liebendorfer wasn't sure at press
time last night whether the inter
sectional meet, first of three in
seven days lor Michigan on the
coast, would be televised.
The Stanford cindermcn of Jack
Weiershauser have had only one
taste of actual competition, an un
impressive victory over
Fresno Stale last week. Michigan,
however, is in top form, having
just finished a rugged Big Ten
season on Midwestern hoards.
The W'olverines, with a bevy of
individual stars, finished behind Il
linois and almost beat the Illini in
their dual meet. Illinois is ranked
among the top two or three teams
nationally.
Items in Stanford's favor tomor
row are Michigan's lack of work
outdoors and almost inevitable im
provement on the part of the Cards
The Wolverines haven't been able
to step out on the cinders because
it snowed in Ann Arbor this week.
The items not in Stanford's favor
arc the Wolverine performers.
Michigan boasts the defending NC
AA high jump champ, the Big Ten
shot put and discus champ, the
four-time winner of the Big Ten
mile, and the 1953 Big Ten 440 titlist.
The Indians' best chance of
denting Wolverine supremacy
could he in the hurdle races, but
the two leading Card barrier top
pers have game legs. Jim Luttrell
will definitely run and Gerry
Wood may also enter.
Wood is one of the country's best
hurdlers and Luttrell is a fast-de
veloping sophomore, but both are
behind in their training because of
the injuries and may not be able to
hold ofT the swift Wolverines.
Sprinter Keith Brownsberger is
another possible Stanford winner,
but he will be hard pressed by Wol
verines John Vallortigara and Dave
Hessler, who have both been
clocked at 9.9 for the century. Jim
Truher, the No. 4 Card dashman,
probably will not run.
Sophomore high jumper John
Stewart (<> ft. 5 1 ,2 in.) will be
jumping against Mill Mead ((> ft.
X>4 in.), the defending NCAA
champ, and Mark Booth ((» ft. 5- v h
in.) of Michigan. Mead, however,
has just reported from the bas
ketball squad and may not he in
top form.
If they have good days,' Indians
Bill Flint, pole vaulter, and Ed Fre
mouw, broad jumper, could threaten
the Michigan standouts. Flint has
cleared 13 ft. this year, but so have
Wolverines Roger'Maugh, John Hil
berry, and Robert Appleman. Maugh
has gone up to 13 ft. fi in.
- Fremouw has leaped 23 ft., hut
the Mid westerners' Junior Sticl
stva and Tom Hendricks have
done a little better this season.
John Ross, a 4:11.2 miler; Grant
Scruggs and Jack Carroll, quarter
milers; Pete Gray, a 1:52.2 880 man;
and Rolan Nilsson, who has done
174 ft. 2 in. in the discus and 53 ft.
10 in. in the shot put, are capable of
leaving Stanford's best in the dust.

has just reported from the bas
ketball squad and may not he in
top form.
If they have good days,' Indians
Bill Flint, pole vaulter, and Ed Fre
mouw, broad jumper, could threaten
the Michigan standouts. Flint has
cleared 13 ft. this year, but so have
Wolverines Roger'Maugh, John Hil
berry, and Robert Appleman. Maugh
has gone up to 13 ft. fi in.
- Fremouw has leaped 23 ft., hut
the Mid westerners' Junior Sticl
stva and Tom Hendricks have
done a little better this season.
John Ross, a 4:11.2 miler; Grant
Scruggs and Jack Carroll, quarter
milers; Pete Gray, a 1:52.2 880 man;
and Rolan Nilsson, who has done
174 ft. 2 in. in the discus and 53 ft.
10 in. in the shot put, are capable of
leaving Stanford's best in the dust.
I lie Maize and Blue fly into Cali
fornia tonight, and Stanford track
men may think the Wolverines are
still flying come post time (1:30 p.m.
for field events and 2 p.m. for the
mile) in the Stadium tomorrow.
In other words, trackwise, the
Wolverines are loaded. And the In
dians aren't.
Stanford Athletic Publicist Don
Liebendorfer wasn't sure at press
time last night whether the inter
sectional meet, first of three in
seven days lor Michigan on the
coast, would be televised.
The Stanford cindermcn of Jack
Weiershauser have had only one
taste of actual competition, an un
impressive victory over
Fresno Stale last week. Michigan,
however, is in top form, having
just finished a rugged Big Ten
season on Midwestern hoards.
The W'olverines, with a bevy of
individual stars, finished behind Il
linois and almost beat the Illini in
their dual meet. Illinois is ranked
among the top two or three teams
nationally.
Items in Stanford's favor tomor
row are Michigan's lack of work
outdoors and almost inevitable im
provement on the part of the Cards
The Wolverines haven't been able
to step out on the cinders because
it snowed in Ann Arbor this week.
The items not in Stanford's favor
arc the Wolverine performers.
Michigan boasts the defending NC
AA high jump champ, the Big Ten
shot put and discus champ, the
four-time winner of the Big Ten
mile, and the 1953 Big Ten 440 titlist.
The Indians' best chance of
denting Wolverine supremacy
could he in the hurdle races, but
the two leading Card barrier top
pers have game legs. Jim Luttrell
will definitely run and Gerry
Wood may also enter.
Wood is one of the country's best
hurdlers and Luttrell is a fast-de
veloping sophomore, but both are
behind in their training because of
the injuries and may not be able to
hold ofT the swift Wolverines.
Sprinter Keith Brownsberger is
another possible Stanford winner,
but he will be hard pressed by Wol
verines John Vallortigara and Dave
Hessler, who have both been
clocked at 9.9 for the century. Jim
Truher, the No. 4 Card dashman,
probably will not run.
Sophomore high jumper John
Stewart (<> ft. 5 1 ,2 in.) will be
jumping against Mill Mead ((> ft.
X>4 in.), the defending NCAA
champ, and Mark Booth ((» ft. 5- v h
