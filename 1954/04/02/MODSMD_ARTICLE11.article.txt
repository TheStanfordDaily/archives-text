## Cards Play 3 'Crucials' 
### ELMORE SEEDS 
Off to a fast start with last
weekend's twin win over UCLA,
Stanford's dark horse baseball
team faces the acid tost today
and tomorrow at the Sunken
, Diamond against the Bruin's and
IJSC's title-favored Trojans.
Today's single game wit.h the
Uclans starts at 3:15 while tomor
row s crucial double - header with
Troy begins at 1:30.
Coach Everett Dean plans to work
| right-hander Ray Young against the
; Bruins, while using southpaws Phil
Page and Don DeLong or rightie
Mike Acker to combat the left
handed batting power in the Trojan
j lineup.
Marty Stiles will open on the
hiil for the Bruins, while Ralph
Pausig and .lack Lovrich will hurl
for Troy.
Although SC is loaded this year
! with returning veterans from last
i year's co-champion club, and mem
| hers of the "best ever" frosh team,
the Cards could surprise if they
continue to get the pitching wit
nessed of late.
Last weekend sophomore Young
and Page came through brilliantly
to get. the Cards off to a running
i start in the California Intei'colle
| giate Baseball Association. Although
I DeLong reported late because of
basketball, he has been effective in
relief roles and sports the best
earned - run average of the staff:
1.50.
Acker has seen considerable non
conference action, working 15 in
nings in relief roles with an ERA of
| 2.40. Ken Brown will be ready for
: relief work.
Timely hitting also played an
important part in last weekend's
success, as Al Talboy found him
self and Tom Dandurand contin
ued lo pound the ball. The Cards
have four regulars hitting over
the three hundred mark: Rich
| Scrainaglia, .1571; Dandurand,
.355; Talboy, .345; and captain
Warren Goodrich, .;il7.
With Scramaglia, Goodrich, Dan
durand, and Talboy batting in the
two through five positions, the
Cards have effectively filled the gap
left by the graduation of last, year's
big guns Essegian, Shepard, and
Swarts. The big question is: Can
! they continue the pace against this
weekend's rugged competition?
The Trojan pitchers Pausig and
Lovrich got late starts this season
because of their play on the Tro
jans' championship basketball squad.
However, both had excellent, rec
ords last season.
Lovrich pitched excellent ball in
the post - season play - offs while
Pausig pitched 11 complete games
for the frosh squad, winning nine
i of them.
Leading powerful Trojan |
slugging aggregation arc shortstop
John Stevenson, who hit Wll last
season; right fielder, Gerry [Mason, i
..'!03; catcher John (iarten, .'{()!);
and third baseman Bill Faddis,
who wound up with .338.
Garten, a junior, is considered one !
of the best major league prospects :
on the coast. Mason and Faddis are
up from the froijh.
Stiles is the Bruins' ace right- j
bander, winning five while losing
six last year. His earned-run aver
age was a respectable 3.38.
