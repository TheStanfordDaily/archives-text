weaponâ€”the H-Bomb.
We know of its power to destroy, that it lias
annihilated an island in the Pacific and that it
could cripple any city in the world.
We know of the problems of its control, that
the radius of one recent blast far exceeded the
expectations of its creators and that men have
already suffered from its heat.
And we have seen the pictures.
We have seen its fury, the great dome of
fire, the mushroom cloud of radioactive smoke,
the flashes ol heat and light.
We have seen the charts and graphs and the
black lines on pictures of American cities

which indicates its potential destruction.
And we are told that this was the first step.
We are told that this blast of November,
1952, was only the initial test in the hydrogen
weapons program, that the explosion was much
smaller than the explosion of ,j more recent
test.
And we wonder.
We wonder how far man has progressed in
