# We Needed a Decision
## 
### 
On Wednesday night Guy Shoup reported
to Excom on the plans for Stanford's participa
tion in this weekend's regional conference of
NSA at Mills College.
The report drew mixed reaction from Excom
members. A few laughed sarcastically at some
details of the conference agenda. A few indi
cated a sincere interest in the purposes and
procedures of the conference. A few appeared
to frown at the fact that Stanford is a member of
NSA. And a few asked some pertinent ques,*
tions which Excom should have resolved bu!
did not.
The most significant question was this:
' Should Stanford attempt to assume official
leadership in NSA by advancing candidates
in the election of regional officers this week
end?"
Shoup mentioned that the presidency of the
California-Hawaii Nevada region would prob
ably go to Stanford if Stanford wanted it. His
analysis of Stanford's participation in NSA dur
ing the year supported this view. Stanford, he
said, had become the leading school in the
local NSA conferences this year.
But Stanford is still a member of NSA on a
trial basis, with the chance that it might drop
its NSA membership at the end of this school
year. It would obviously reflect poorly on
Stanford if Excom were to vote for withdrawal
after a member of the delegation had been
elected to one of the regional offices.

The delegates who attend the conference this
weekend will be aware of the possibility that
Stanford will drop membership. They will afso
be aware that NSA needs Stanford's leader
ship, that without that leadership NSA in this
region will never become much more than an j
ideal.
We feel that Stanford should attempt to '
expand the leadership it has shown in NSA
during the past year. With that leadership, '
NSA would improve. And with that improve
ment, Stanford would benefit.
But the decision is not ours to make. It will
be in the hands of the delegates who attend
the conference this weekend. Their dilemma !
will include the questions of Stanford's lead-1
ership and, in a sense, membership in NSA.
Those questions should have been answered j
by Excom belore the conference. Instead, they
were left in mid air.
Granted, it would have been difficult for Ex- i
com to answer those questions last Wednesday
night. But now they must be answered by the
delegates to the conference, without the proper
representative authority of the Executive Com
mittee.
Excom's indecision has placed the delegates
in an impossible position. The situation forces
a decision one way or the other from them.
And yet, however they decide, their decision
cannot be valid. Only Excom could/have for- ,
mulated the clear statement of policy which is I
needed.
