# CAMPUS OPINION
## A 						Balance for Materialism 
### 
To the Editor:
When I read The Daily's editorial of Thursday April
1, my first inclination was to guffaw at tlje specious
reasoning and unsophisticated naivete of the writer of,
t'ie article in the publication, "Jeunesse." On second
thought, I realized that his ideas have often been given
< rcdence by Americans, and should be refuted.
1 he writer claims to know little of our American
world, but smugly thanks us for our "Coca-Cola,
chewing gum. the Reader's Digest, and neon lights."
The author feels that Europeans owe to us only (hp
gauche commercialism that we have inflicted upon
therfi. 1 submit that if this pseudo-intellect will only
look about him at the American soldier dead that lie
in his fields, and at the American wealth that has stood
a;-, a bulwark against his starvation and economic
i uin, he might recognize that Europeans owe us a
damn sight more.
I 'he author goes; on to criticize the American way of
life and to equate it to communism, for what he calls

our standardization of taste. Indeed how dreary and
static it must appear to him, our way of life estab
lished on a standard of happiness and well being.
As a clincher the young author derides the mili
tary and scientific strength of the I'nited Stales, yet I
would wager he would he among those who would
clamor for armed assistance from us were his coun
try to become threatened by aggression, or among
those to cry for the miracle drugs if an epidemic
were to descend upon him.
My biggest disappointment is not in the author of
the Swiss article, for Europe is full of envious anti-
Americanism, particularly at (he intellectual level, but
rather I am disappointed in the Editorial staff of The
Daily for giving such immature and shallow thinking
their serious consideration. Granted that our gaudy
materialism is irritating to many Europeans, but to
the more rational person our common fundamental
ideals of freedom and happiness far outweigh our sur
face behavior.
