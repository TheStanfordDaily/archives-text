# Statehood Bill Passed by Senate
## Hawaii, Alaska Together Face Passage in House 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 1 (UP)—The Senate today passed its his
toric statehood bill to bring Hawaii and Alaska into the Union as
the 49th and 50th states.
The smashing 57 to 28 vote came after the Senate overwhelm
ingly defeated a move to give the territories only commonwealth

♦ status and rejected efforts to delay
a showdown on the issue which has
been hanging fire in Congress for
50 years. The Senate never before
had voted on the question.
The bill now goes to the House
where its chances of passage at this
session appear slim. The House has
approved Hawaiian statehood but a
companion measure for Alaska had
been pigeonholed in the House
Rules Committee since last year.
The Senate measure can be .sent
to the Rules Committee or to a Scn
ate-House conference committee.
House Republican Leader Charles
A. Halleck (Ind.) noted that it
would take the unanimous consent
of the House to channel it to a con
ference committee and said he is
"sure this will not he granted." He
refused to predict what the rules
group v/ould do if it gets the bill.
Rep. Clair Englc (D., Calif.),
strong Alaskan statehood advocate,
charged that House GOP leaders
have "made up their minds" there
will be no statehood for the North
west territory. Democrats would
fight any move to grant statehood to
Hawaii only.
The prospect of a delay due to a
| House fight also was a serious threat
to statehood for either territory
since Congressional leaders do not
want drawn-out debate late in the
session as Congress is rushing to
ward an election-year adjournment.
President Eisenhower originally
i asked only for statehood for Hawaii,
; saying Alaska was not yet ready.
But three weeks ago the Senate vot
j ed 4K to 4.'! to couple Alaska to the
J Hawaiian bill. Senate Republican
