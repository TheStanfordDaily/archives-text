##

Pete Kmetovic sends his ruggers
alter win number 10 tomorrow when
Stuniord hosts a vastly improved
UCLA squad at the Rugby Field at
2:30. The Braves play the Palo Alto
Ramblers following the varsity game.
The Cards defeated the Bruins
twice during the vacation 8-3 and
14-9, but the Uclans bounced back
to trip a highly rated Canadian All-
Star team 9-6 and 8-3 last week.

man squad north, including G letter

Rudy Feldman, and Hardiman Cure

this season by the accurate kicking
of wing Don Shinnick.
