# YWCA Needs Brunch Help
## 
### 
Sign-ups for working on the YW
j CA's Strawberry Brunch continue
| today from 3 to 5 p.m.
All freshman women interested in
helping on this project, either as
committee members or hostesses,
may come to the "Y" office on the
third floor of the Women's Club
house during these hours.
The Strawberry Brunch will be
held on May 11 this year as part
of the annual Con Home Week.
Freshman women plan the event
and sell strawberry shortcake and
coffee in Union Court. Last year's
brunch included such extra attrac
tions as a fortune telllcr and back
ground music by Spike Lynch and
the Stardusters.
The proceeds from the project are
for the benefit of the Stanford Con
valescent Home.
