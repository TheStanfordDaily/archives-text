## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Howie Dallmar added another
triumph to what is alreary a
long string of victories for him—
he was appointed Stanford's
new head basketball coach.
The 32-year-old former Card cage '
star has been coach at the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania for the past six
years, and wiil come to Stanford in i
the early summer to replace Bob j
Burnett, who recently announced
his resignation to go into private
business.
The announcement of Dallmar's \
appointment was made by Athletic
Director Al Masters on Friday fol
lowing a meeting of the Stanford
Athletic Board. Masters had rec
ommended Dallmar's name to the
board, and it was unanimously api
proved.
Dallmar is reportedly taking a
small salary cut in coming to
Stanford, but because he coaches I
both basketball and baseball at
Penn he did not expect to make
as much coaching only one sport. '
Dallmar will stay in Philadelphia
until the Quaker baseball season
is ended.
The 6-foot-4 eager entered Stan
ford in ID4D and played basketball
and baseball. In 1942 lie led Ever
ett Dean's cagers to an NCAA !
championship. He was voted the !
outstanding player in the tourna- i
ment after his teammate stars Don ,
Burness and Jim Pollard were side
lined with injuries.
In 1943 ho was called into service,
but this did not stop his baseball
playing. As a naval trainee at Penn,
he captained the Quakers to an Ivy
League title, and was voted the out
standing player to visit New York
City in 1945.
He then turned professional—for i
a reported $10,000—and starred with
the Philadelphia Warriors. He made
all-league his first season.
Dallmar returned to Stanford for
a short time in 1948 to finish getting
the degree he was working toward
before the war, and then was ap
pointed head basketball coach at
Penn.
flis overall record at Pennsyl
vania is 105 wins against 51 losses,
and his record in Ivy League
competition is 48-28. His Quakers
were Ivy League champions in
1953, but lost to Notre Dame in
the NCAA district playoffs. The
team was Ivy League runnerup in ,
1952, and third on three other oc
casions.
The new coach is one of some 50
candidates who had applied for the
job, including Minneapolis Laker
star Jim Pollard and Colorado coacli*
H. B. Lee.
Burnett commented about his re
placement, "Dallmar is a great play
er and has been an excellent coach
at Penn. I'm sure he will reach
even greater heights at Stanford
-ind I am happy to turn over the
j reins to him."


THE NEW HEAD MAN—Stanford basketball fortunes fall into
the hands of Howie Dallmar, who was a Card hoop sensation in
1942. Dallmar will take over his new job when he finishes
coaching Penn's baseballers.
