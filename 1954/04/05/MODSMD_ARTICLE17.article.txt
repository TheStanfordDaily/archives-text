## And Nowâ€”A Fair Trial 
### 
Stanford is now one step closer to qivinq the
National Students Association a fair tiial.
Yesterday the Stanford delegation to the
: ecjional NSA meeting at Mills College norm
nated A 1 V'llaqe representative to Excom,
: r or regional vi> * president, lvey won the elec
tion, and with l is victory, Stanford stepped out
of the position of passive member and into a
position of leadership in NSA.
The decision of the Stanford delegation is
surprising, but welcome. Until as late as Satur
day, it appeared that Stanford's student leaders
were against accepting a leadership position in
NSA. That reluctance ws due in part to the lack
of a clear policy statement by Excom and the
tenuous nature of Stanford's NSA. membership.
Whatever the reason for the change of heart,
we think that Stanford has made a wise de
rision in accepting the responsibility for the

improvement of NSA on the regional level.
Stanford acknowledged that NSA is in need
of leadership, that at present NSA cannot be
judged only by the limited "concrete" benefits
it now affords membt r schools, and that it must
be judged in a situation where it has effective
leadership.
We think that Ivey, with the co-operation
and assistance of Excorn, can offer that effec
tive leadership lo the northern region which he
will head. Without it, the purposes, structure,
and appeal of the National Students Associa
tion could not be judged properly.
And we agree with Assistant Manager Pete
Birig, wiio told the conference delegates on
Saturday that "we should all pull together to
make NSA work."
We are glad that Stanford has shown that it
is willing to "pull together" with the other
member schools ol this region.
