A I>AY WITH 'HIE SPORTS

IS SATURDAY LUNCH WORTH EATINC,
ANYHOW
Eleanor Roosevelt used to got away with a daily
journal entitled "My Day." Herewith a new effort,
available to the usual news agencies at a nominal sum,
and previewed in The Daily. It is to he ppIWI "Mv

Damned Day."
Last Saturday was a sport day
here. 1 decided to limit myself to
two events: the crew races, and
the baseball double header with
IJSC. About 9:30 I : bagged out
to the Yacht Harbor to watch the
Orphans at work.
Well, the event was supposed fo
start at 10:30, but at 10:30 only the
Stanford Freshman shell was in
the water. As time passed, we

managed*to get a JV shell and the USC .TVs in too,
but the USC varsity was nowhere in sight. Seems
that their coach and a couple of the ringers (Whoops,
rowers) had come up by plane and weren't here
yet. But, being optimists, my friends and 1 went to
the point to watch the JV race.
There were a million and one people there, and
one lulu of a traffic jam to match, but we got there
in ample time. In fact, we waited. And we waited,
and still we waited. An impartial observer with
powerful glasses announced that all three of the
crews were out there. The time approached 11:45, and
the sun continued its climb in the sky, albeit hid
den by the clouds.
Finally, someone decided that the race was on,
and, to be sure, the bill:, seemed to get closer. They
even came across the line in front of us: The frosh

rowing a proud first, followed by the JVs, and the
poor (JSC JVs a poor third.
While all of this was going on, the varsity crews
had finally managed to get their boats to float, the
missing coach had eventually shown up with his
missing oarsmen, and the crews were easing out to
the 2000-meter mark in the bay. There they sat for
awhfle.
The USC boat was going in concentric circles. No
one had bothered to check the coxswain's breath on
arrival, or checked the possibility of whirlpools in
the bay. But after a small eternity, during which
the clock came around to 12:30, the race was on.
It was worth the wait. We made it, and not by a
bit more than two feet ahead of the Trojans.
Thence to the double header. The sun was still in
the clouds somewhere, a convenient subterfuge for
giving ball fans u good healthy burn.
Yuu can take your choice as to the high points of
this event. Some will pick the Dandurand triple in
the first game. Some will think of the antics of the
dog on the field in the beginning of the second,
game, and some will always enjoy the rhubarb of the
USC coach and umpire West over a disputed Pausig
balk. Me, I enjoy the rhubarb.
There may be a better 50 cents worth than that
double header with USC, but I can't name it. Five
hours of varied entertainment and thrills, all for a
half-buck. And a sun tan to go with it.
Or a sunburn, if you're less lucky. That's me: 7
don't even use the light on my desk, just hold the
book or paper in front of iny face and there's a world
of light.
The evening was, of course, devoted to a discus
sion of the clay's sporting events. Total accomplish
ment for the day: Nothing. All I have to show for
Saturday is my peeling face and a slight case of
indigestion from the hot dogs.

the clouds somewhere, a convenient subterfuge for
giving ball fans u good healthy burn.
Yuu can take your choice as to the high points of
this event. Some will pick the Dandurand triple in
the first game. Some will think of the antics of the
dog on the field in the beginning of the second,
game, and some will always enjoy the rhubarb of the
USC coach and umpire West over a disputed Pausig
balk. Me, I enjoy the rhubarb.
There may be a better 50 cents worth than that
double header with USC, but I can't name it. Five
hours of varied entertainment and thrills, all for a
half-buck. And a sun tan to go with it.
Or a sunburn, if you're less lucky. That's me: 7
don't even use the light on my desk, just hold the
book or paper in front of iny face and there's a world
of light.
The evening was, of course, devoted to a discus
sion of the clay's sporting events. Total accomplish
ment for the day: Nothing. All I have to show for
Saturday is my peeling face and a slight case of
indigestion from the hot dogs.

Eleanor Roosevelt used to got away with a daily
journal entitled "My Day." Herewith a new effort,
available to the usual news agencies at a nominal sum,
and previewed in The Daily. It is to he ppIWI "Mv

Damned Day."
Last Saturday was a sport day
here. 1 decided to limit myself to
two events: the crew races, and
the baseball double header with
IJSC. About 9:30 I : bagged out
to the Yacht Harbor to watch the
Orphans at work.
Well, the event was supposed fo
start at 10:30, but at 10:30 only the
Stanford Freshman shell was in
the water. As time passed, we

managed*to get a JV shell and the USC .TVs in too,
but the USC varsity was nowhere in sight. Seems
that their coach and a couple of the ringers (Whoops,
rowers) had come up by plane and weren't here
yet. But, being optimists, my friends and 1 went to
the point to watch the JV race.
There were a million and one people there, and
one lulu of a traffic jam to match, but we got there
in ample time. In fact, we waited. And we waited,
and still we waited. An impartial observer with
powerful glasses announced that all three of the
crews were out there. The time approached 11:45, and
the sun continued its climb in the sky, albeit hid
den by the clouds.
Finally, someone decided that the race was on,
and, to be sure, the bill:, seemed to get closer. They
even came across the line in front of us: The frosh

rowing a proud first, followed by the JVs, and the
poor (JSC JVs a poor third.
While all of this was going on, the varsity crews
had finally managed to get their boats to float, the
missing coach had eventually shown up with his
missing oarsmen, and the crews were easing out to
the 2000-meter mark in the bay. There they sat for
awhfle.
The USC boat was going in concentric circles. No
one had bothered to check the coxswain's breath on
arrival, or checked the possibility of whirlpools in
the bay. But after a small eternity, during which
the clock came around to 12:30, the race was on.
It was worth the wait. We made it, and not by a
bit more than two feet ahead of the Trojans.
Thence to the double header. The sun was still in
the clouds somewhere, a convenient subterfuge for
giving ball fans u good healthy burn.
