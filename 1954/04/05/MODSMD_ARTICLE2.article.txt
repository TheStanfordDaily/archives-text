# Pitchers Lead Card Nine To Two League Victories
## 
### ELMORE SEEDS 
Continuing to get excellent pitching and timely hitting, Stan
ford's baseball team edged UCLA and split with SC in three
weekend games at the Sunken Diamond.
The triumphs moved the Cards into first place in the CIBA
standings with a 4-1 record. California is second with 2-1. The
r>_ l i ir..;J „,l

Bcar.s beat Troy Friday and split*
with UCLA Saturday.
Sophomore Ray Young hurled
Friday's 3-2, 11-inning win over the
Bruins and bunted home the win
ning run.
Lefty Phil Page handcuffed the
vaunted Trojans in Saturday's
opener, holding them to two hits in
a 5-2 victory. Mike Acker pitched
the second game and might have
won except for some sloppy fielding
by his mates in the fifth inning.
Stanford has yet to use a relief

pitcher in conference action. Young,
Page, and Acker have turned in five
straight complete games.
The Trojans, who came north in a
first-place tic with Stanford and ex
pected at the worst to win two out
of three, go home with a 3-2 con
ference record in third position. Al
though still very much in the race,
the men of Troy failed to display
their feared batting power and
showed little to justify their rating
at a strong pie-season favorite.
Parce hurled near-perfect ball in
Saturday's opener, lie allowed
only one bit through the first eight
innings, before being touched fnr
two runs on a hit and two walks
in the ninth. This broke a Trojan
scoreless skein that had stretched
for 24 innings. Cal's Joe (ireggaro
shut them out Friday.
Page needed three snappy double
plays, however, to make up for
seven walks, as lie put the leadoff
batter on in five different innings.
While SC got nowhere, Stanford
piled up five runs. Tom Dandurand
tripled along the right field foul
linn scoring Sid Hall in the first.
Consecutive singles by Len Swartz,
Page, and Hall counted another
marker in the second.
Another base hit by Swartz and
a two-base error by Trojan center
fielder Tony Santino on Oleg Suz
daleff's hard drive scored Swartz in
the fourth.
A single by Su/daleff and Rich
Scramaglra's double after Hall
drew a base on balls gave the
Cards their final lv\n tallies in the
Seventh.


HOME FREE—Stanford's Bob Evans bounds gleefully across
home plate with the winning run in the 11th inning against
UCLA Friday in the Sunken Diamond. The Card left fielder

Young's bunt with the bases loaded. Bruin Daryl Westerfield

Vic Lapiner went the distance for
1 SC and got the loss.
In the second game, the Indians
j were leading, 3-1, going into the ill—
| fated fifth, thanks to timely doubles
by Hall and right fielder A 1 Talboy.
Then the roof fell in.
The first three Trojans to face
Acker bunted down the thifd J)ase
line. Dandurand booted the first
one, Swartz the second, and Scra
maglia was late covering first on the
! third.
Thus the Trojans had loaded the
j bases without so much as a full
j swing at the ball. Two singles with
a double-steal sandwiched in be
tween gave SC four much-needed
runs and Stanford their first confer
ence defeat.
In Friday's hall game pitcher
Young came to hat in the 11th
frame with the bases loaded in a
2-all contest. He laid down a per
fect squeeze hunt to score left
fielder Bob Evans. Evans had
doubled oil' the embankment to
open the inning.
Hall, Scramaglia, Dandurand, and
j Evans paced Ihe Stanford hitting
over the weekend, with three blows
j each. Dandurand as usual led the
j RBI column with three.
Besides his hitting, Scramaglia
figured in five double plays, getting
away several perfect pegs to first
despite the antics of on-charging
base runners.
Stanford won't return to CIBA

the Santa Clara Broncos.
