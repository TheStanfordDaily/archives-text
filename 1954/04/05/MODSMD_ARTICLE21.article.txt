## America's 'True Glory' 
### 
To the Editor:
Mr. Dunn's reply to the article in "Jeunesse" is a
welcome counterbalance to the exaggerated miscon
ceptions of that article, hut I fear that he has
too far in the otl t r direction. The arguments which
Mr. Dunn uses are likely to confirm the "Young
Swiss" in their opinion that Americans cannot see
beyond their dollar . Il-bomhs. and overstuffed chairs.
All these Communism can, <>i would Uke to, offer also.
If we condemn Soviet Communism, it is not be
cause its ideal is materialistic (has anyone ever suc
ceeded in defining this word?), or even because it.
has betrayed its own ideal. If any one corporation
or political party oj re lupous : ret had a ; much power
in the United Stah : . the Communist Parly has in

the Soviet Union, the American Way would lie as
open to condemnation as the Russian, for it is true
that each of these groups seeks to level man to its
own specifications. The true glory of America is that
each of these groups can be heard and the individual
can take the best from each. The bombardment of
slogans and TV programs is far less deadening to the
mind than life in an isolated community with its
iron-bound customs and traditional dogmas'.
Let us say to the Young Swiss: That in which
America takes pride is no one thing or one idea, but
the freedom and opportunity for all of them. Some
of our choices may be wrong; what counts is that
freedom of choice remains.
