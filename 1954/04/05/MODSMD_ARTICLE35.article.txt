WOOD WINSâ€”Gerry Wood (center), one of three Stanford
winners Saturday against Michigan, races home in front of
teammate Jim Luttrell (left), and Wolverine Jim Love in the 120-
yard high hurdles. Wood, who was a doubtful entrant because
of a pulled leg muscle, was clocked in 14.7. Michigan won,
86-35.
