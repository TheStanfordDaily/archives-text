# Michigan Spikers Roll; Cards Win Three Events
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
There were a few bright spots for Stanford in Saturday's track
meet with Michigan, but the score wasn't one of them.
The Wolverines showed their depth and power by smashing
the Indians, 86-35, on the newly sufaced Stadium oval.
The Card spikemen came away with only three first places in

the 14-event slate. The javelin was*
not held because it is outlawed in
the Big Ten.
Indian Gerry Wood, whose en
try into the 120-yard high hurdle
field was a mild surprise, pulled
easily to a 14.7 win despite his
pulled leg muscle and a misstep at
the start. Sophomore Jim Lut
trell ran second for Stanford's
, only one-two finish of the day.
Luttrell came back to nab the 220
low barrier test in 24.3, outrunning
Jim Love and Junior Stielstra of
Michigan.
I John Stewart, the rangy sopho
' more high jumper from Palo Alto,
cleared the bar at 6 ft. 6 in. on his
second attempt to win his duel with
Milt Mead, the Wolverines' NCAA
I high jump champ. Mead was sec
ond at 6 ft. 5 in. and Norm Jiles,
Stanford's solidly built redhead,
placed third with a 6 ft. 4 in. leap.
Roland Nilsson, a tall, balding
Swede, and John Vallortigara, the
driving sprinter, were double
winners for the Maize and Blue.
Nilsson won the shot put on his
j second toss of 54 ft. 6 in. and took
the discus from teammate Roy Pella
with a 160-ft. 10-in. effort. Vallor
tigara held off Stanford's Keith
Brownsberger in a 10 flat century
and Wolverine Bob Brown in a 22.2
furlong around the curve.
A 1 Cheney and Phil Brabyn fin
ished second and third for Stanford
in the shot and Loren Sorensen and
Ed Fremouw did the same in the
