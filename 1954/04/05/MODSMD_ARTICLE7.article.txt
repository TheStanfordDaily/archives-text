# NSA CONFERENCE
## Delegates Elect Ivey Area Vice-President 
### BARBARA TUERK 
Stanford junior A! Ivey was elected regional vice-president for
the National Students Association yesterday.
Ivey, Village representative to the Executive Committee, will
take over immediately as chairman of the Northern District of the
California-Nevada-Hawaii region, which includes the University

of California, Mills College, and
Stanford.
Stanford's NSA delegation
yesterday agreed to accept leader
ship in this district., after arguing on
Saturday that any elections held
this weekend would be unconstitu
tional.
Ivey told The Daily last night, "I
believe that NSA needs to eval- :!
uate and reorganize its programs
on each individual campus, and to
educate other schools in the pur
poses of the association. NSA to
succeed in this district, needs
Stanford leadership, and I'm glad
we're goin/g to try to give it that
leadership."
Controversy at the semi-annual
regional conference at Mills College
this weekend centered on the ques
tion of whether or not the region
could amend its constitution to
change regional elections from sum
mer to spring.
NSA Co-ordinacor "jay Shoup and
delegate Pete Ring argued that
while Stanford favored an eventual
change in the time of election, an
amendment now would be uncon
stitutional, because member schools
have not considered it for the re
quired six months.
Delegates from other NSA
schools voted yes on a constitu
tional interpretation that discus
sion at last summer's national
convention meant that the amend
. ment had had the necessary six'
months' consideration.
In other action at yesterday's
plenary session, the conference
passed two Stanford-initiated reso
lutions. One presented a mandate
for national considerations that NSA
delegations to international student
conferences include current NSA
officers anrl full-time undergraduate
students of NSA member schools.
In the past, NSA delegations have
included former officers of the asso
ciation often several years out of
! school.
The second, authored by Ivey and
observer Will Oxtobv, called for an
evaluation of NSA's effectiveness at
j each member school, and for a pro
! gram under which each NSA mem
j bcr school would uet in contact with
; two non - member schools about
j joining NSA.
About 70 delegates and observ
ers from 11 schools attended the
conference. Non-member schools
which sent observers included the
University of Southern California,
San Francisco State College, Col
lege of the Pacific, University of
Stanford's delegaion included
Win Griffith, Barbara Klass, Pete
Ring, Barbara Tuerk, Hadley
and Shoup on Saturday; and Don
Lozahnick, John Stahr. Bob Gable.
Fred Aurel, Bing and Shoup on
j Sunday.
Observers who attended included
Bob Mishell, Dan Linhart, Rudy
Reich, Dave .fenks, Steve Voyko
vich, Ginny Waxman, Don
and Will Oxtoby.
