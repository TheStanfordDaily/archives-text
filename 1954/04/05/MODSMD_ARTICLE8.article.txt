# Rains Cancel Lake Opening
## 
### 
The rains came yesterday, and
drowned out the scheduled open
ing of Lake Lagunita planned by
the senior class.
The situation was reminiscent
of last year, when the opening
ceremonies had to be held in the
midst of a March downpour.
"We regretted having to cancel
the ceremonies," said senior class
president Dick Shooshan. '"How
ever, because of the unpredicta
bility of the weather we felt that
this was a necessary decision. We
would like to thank those who did
turn out, and also co-chairmen
Mary Lou Hanna and Kay John
son for their excellent work in
planning the event."
"Because of similar difficulties
in the past," Shooshan added, "we
feel that these ceremonies should
be omitted from the calendar, and
therefore have made no plans for
future ceremonies."
