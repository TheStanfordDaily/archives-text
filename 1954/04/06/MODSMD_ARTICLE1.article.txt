# Jorda Says Individuality Keynotes Today's Music
## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
Anxiety and individuality are the keynotes of today's music,
according io Enrigue Jorda, newly appointed conductor of the
San Francisco Symphony.
Jorda visited campus last night and talked informally with a
group of about 50 Stanford students. He was accompanied by
Alexander Fried, music critic*

for the San Francisco Examiner,
and Earl Murray, assistant con
ductor of the symphony.
The anxiety Jorda attributed to
the spirit of the age, since musicians,
like other people, are inevitably in
fluencerl by the political, economic,
and social currents of thought.
Expressions of individuality,
Jorda said, stemmed from the
freedom given to composers. Con
sequences of this freedom arc
many "musical languages," such
as polytonality and a to n a Ii t y .
These musical languages, many of
which are unknown to the aver
age listener, lead lo suspicion of
modern works.
Student tastes in music were dis
cusser I by Hie group. According to
an informal poll taken by Fried,
preferences seemed to be about
equally divided between the purely
classical pieces and the more chal
lenging, less well - known modern
works.
Asked what (lie conductor ex
pected from his audience, Jorda
named understanding as the out
standing quality, lie explained the
difficulty involved in drawing up a
representative program, and said:
"The audience must understand
the m-'sny different preferences in
music that must be satisfied with
a program, and tolerate music that
they may not themselves person
ally approve of."
Explaining his policy in drawing
up programs, Jorda agreed with I
Fried's definition of an ideal sym- J
phony program aimed one-third at I
the audience, one-third at the com
poser's personal tastes, and one
third between the two.
AI one point in the evening, Fried
gave his definition of art.
"Art must pique the taste of the
audit-nee. It must not satisfy, it
must not deliver a complete mes
sage, it must mil tie up all the
loose ends. There must be some
thing tiM;,raspable, something tan
talizing."
Jot-da's visit to campus was spon
sored by the Stanford Symphony
Forum. He will be conducting the
San Francisco Symphony Thursday.
