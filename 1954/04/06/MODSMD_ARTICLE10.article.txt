# 18-Year-Old Vote Poll Shows Split
## 
### 
If the answers of 119 students
polled at random are typical.
Stanford is almost evenly split on
the question: Should 1.8-year
olds have the vote?
Sixty-five students — 54 per
cent of those questioned an
swered no. Fifty-four students
45 per cent of those.interviewed
-answered yes. And three stu
dents said they didn't ktiow.
Eighty-four of the students
The Daily questioned were in the
18-20-year ace group. Almost 49
per cent of these students
thought 18-year-olds were old
enough to vote.
Only 37 per cent of the ,15 stu
dents over 21 who were ques
tioned favored an 18 - year - old
vote.
Typical answers to the ques
tions "Why?" and "Why not?"
were: "If you're old enough to
fight, you're old enough to vote,"
and"I don't think 18-year-olds
are mature enough to vote."
Among the students questioned
were:
Jean Rashor. 20. Durand House.
"Yes. In high school, students
are taught the essentials of vot
ing and governing. If they are
not permitted to excrcise their

privilege of voting for the laws
they are required to live by. I
think that in three or four years
they have lost most of their en
thusiasm for electing good offi
cers."
George Weintz, 20. Enrina Hall.
"No. Until you're 21. you're a
minor before the law and you're
not he'd fully responsible for
your actions. Therefore why
should you be given the respon
sibility of voting? Personally, I
don't want to see politics active
on the campus like in Europe."
Rill Francis, 19, Toyon. "Yes.
Things are different now than
they were in 1790 Most people
are better educated on all levels,
including politics, and people are
old enough by 18 to vote intelli
gently."
Jan White. 19, Durand. No.
From 18 to 21 you're too much
interested tn other things to
spend the necessary time study
ing government"
David Barrick, 21, off-campus.
"Yes. Most of us pay taxes ol
some kind or another at 18. and
we're given most of the respon
sibilities of citizenship without
the main privilege."

Marion McGrane, 19, Ventura.
"No. I don't think 18-year-olds
have had enough experience in
public affairs and business to be
able to judge political issues."
Ellie Myer. 22, Sterling. "Yes.
At any age when voting becomes
important to a person he will
try to learn more about political
issues. He is capable of doing
this whenever he «s offered the
responsibility."
Gerry Malone.v, 21, off-campus.
"No. Persons under 18 are too
unsettled. As a rule they have
not acquired enough property to
sober their actions and thinking.
By the time they are 21 they
usually have enough property
so they will vote for people who
will protect that property for
them. At 18 the prospective voter
has nothing to lose by voting
radically."
Jim Campbell. 20. Alpha Kap
pa Lambda. No. The argument
that, if you're old enough to fight
for your country you're old
enough to vote assumes that, a
good fighter makes a good voter,
which is not true."
Don Carlson, 19. Stern Hall.
"Yes. If a compulsory course in

contemporary politics is given to
all high school students."
Dlawar Barakal. 2.1, off cam
pus. "No. The French call the
age 16-20 the ungrateful age. The
age where you don't like what
you have, but don't know what
you want. In this country this is
even more true. Eighteen, 19-,
and 20-year-olds are very imma
tuie. It's not their fault. It's be
cause they are treated as chil
dren until they are in their
twenties."
John Shields, 22, Alpha Kappa
Lambda. "Yes. Since the 18-
ypai-old must fight for his coun
try, he should have the right to
vote. You can force maturity on
him by giving Inm there ponsi
bihty of voting. It would be pos
sible to give a TV program on
mature voting to everyone each
week."
Jerry Murray, 18, Encina. "No.
Eighteen-year-olds have not
been away from home long
enough Too many of their opin
ions come from their parents. It
takes a little working on your
own before you feel the way
politics affects you directly. Col
lege students are too much with
drawn to be capable to vote."
