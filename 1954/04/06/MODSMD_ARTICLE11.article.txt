# French Clear Resignation Of Juin as NATO Chief
## 
### 
PARIS, April 5 (UP)—The French government cleared the way
today for France's highest ranking soldier, Marshal Alphonse Juin,
tc resign as the North Atlantic Alliance Commander-in-Chief for
Central Europe.
Juin demanded assurances that when ho resigned his NATO

command it would go to a *
French general with all of the
65-year-old marshal's "preoga
tives and powers."
Premier Joseph Laniel gave Juin
such asurance today in a 30-minute
meeting. That apparently cleared
the last block from Juin's resigning
from his top NATO post.
He already has been removed as
vice-president of the French Su
preme Defense Council for his
outspoken criticism of the pro
posed six-natiop Western Euro
pean army. The army plan, or
European Defense Community
Treaty, would re-arm West Ger
many in the defense of West Eu- |
rope against Soviet aggression.
The marshal went from his meet
ing with Laniel to a conference with
Foreign Minister Georges Bidault.
Bidault called an extraordinary
session of the 14-nation NATO
council—the governing body of the
Allied defense setup. The minister
gave a full report to the council
of his government's dispute with
Juin and its desire to replace him in
NATO.
Highly reliable sources said that i
the council derided that it was the !
French government's problem to
irtrinve Juin, or for the marshal
formally to hand his resignation to
the council.

One member of the council said
the 14 ambassadors and ministers
making up the group felt, that
France was "passing the buck" in
this dispute.
However, the council censured
Juin for his public statements against
the EDC. It forwarded a reminder
to the marshal of a directive issued
last year instructing all NATO of
ficers not to indulge in public de
bate on the EDC.
