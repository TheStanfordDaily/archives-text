# Ike States Kremlin Aware Of 'Sobering Risks of War'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 5 (UP) —President Eisenhower told a
bomb-jittery world tonight that the threat of U.S. retaliation on
Russia with the hydrogen bomb is the free world's best insurance
against World War 111
Addressing the nation by radio and television, Mr. Eisenhower

calmly examined the fears cur
rently besetting the United
States and other free nations and
gave his considered judgment that
they are exaggerated.
He conceded "the men in the
Kremlin" might start a global war
"in a fit of madness or through mis
caluclation." But he said they are
aware of the sobering risks that
"make war, let us say, less likely."
The President pledged that the
hydrogen bomb, now powerful
enough to knock out whole cities,
will not "be used by our initiative."
He listed as the nation's main
"apprehensions," these five points:
"The men in the Kremlin . . . the
atomic age . . . loss of our inter
national friends . . . Communist
penetration of our own country
. . . (including unwise investiga
tions) . . . the possibility of de
pression."
Mr. Eisenhower measured these
dangers against what he called
"counter-balancing values" and as
serted flatly that "we don't have to
fear!" Taking them up one by one,
he made these points:
Russia — Soviet leades "love
power. . . . Whenever they start a
war they are taking the great risk
of losing that power. . . . When dic
tators overreach themselves and
challenge the world they're very
likely to end up in any place except
a dictatorial position, and those men
in the Politburo know that."
The Atomic Age—Atomic wea
pons "are not in themselves a
great threat to us. Of course not.
The H-bomh is a threat to us only
if a potential aggressor who also
has the secret . . . determines to
use it against us . .
Internal Communism—". ._. this
•fear has been greatly exaggerated
as to numbers. In our country today
there are possibly some 25,000 doc
trinal Communists. The FBI knows
pretty well where they are.
Congressional Investigator s—
"Along with this . . . comes another
fear that's related to it, the fear that,
we will use intemperate investi
gative methods, particularly through
congressional committees, to com
bat that Communistic penetration
I ... I think that there can be grave
offenses committed against an in
nocent individual . . . but in the
long run you may be certain . . .
public opinion , . . will straighten
this matter out. . . ."
Free World Unity—". . . No na
tion in the world . . . has ever
freely adopted communism in a
vote of the people. . . . Moreover,
there is a growing understanding
in the world of the decency and
justice of American position in op
posing the slavery of any nation.
. . . The one mistake we must
never make is to think of our
friends ... as being tools of
ours. . .
Domestic Economy — "You will
hear people talking about the level
of 3,700,000 unemployed, and it's
very true and it is a figure that
comes about as a result of our ef
forts to go from a war to aeace
economy. That, figure happily shows
every sign now of leveling off."

He listed as the nation's main
"apprehensions," these five points:
"The men in the Kremlin . . . the
atomic age . . . loss of our inter
national friends . . . Communist
penetration of our own country
. . . (including unwise investiga
tions) . . . the possibility of de
pression."
Mr. Eisenhower measured these
dangers against what he called
"counter-balancing values" and as
serted flatly that "we don't have to
fear!" Taking them up one by one,
he made these points:
Russia — Soviet leades "love
power. . . . Whenever they start a
war they are taking the great risk
of losing that power. . . . When dic
tators overreach themselves and
challenge the world they're very
likely to end up in any place except
a dictatorial position, and those men
in the Politburo know that."
The Atomic Age—Atomic wea
pons "are not in themselves a
great threat to us. Of course not.
The H-bomh is a threat to us only
if a potential aggressor who also
has the secret . . . determines to
use it against us . .
Internal Communism—". ._. this

there are possibly some 25,000 doc

pretty well where they are.

"Along with this . . . comes another
fear that's related to it, the fear that,
we will use intemperate investi

congressional committees, to com
bat that Communistic penetration
I ... I think that there can be grave
offenses committed against an in
nocent individual . . . but in the
long run you may be certain . . .
public opinion , . . will straighten
this matter out. . . ."
Free World Unity—". . . No na

freely adopted communism in a
vote of the people. . . . Moreover,
there is a growing understanding
in the world of the decency and
justice of American position in op
posing the slavery of any nation.
. . . The one mistake we must
never make is to think of our
friends ... as being tools of
ours. . .
Domestic Economy — "You will
hear people talking about the level

economy. That, figure happily shows
every sign now of leveling off."

—H-bomb "most sobering"
WASHINGTON, April 5 (UP) —President Eisenhower told a
bomb-jittery world tonight that the threat of U.S. retaliation on
Russia with the hydrogen bomb is the free world's best insurance
against World War 111
Addressing the nation by radio and television, Mr. Eisenhower

calmly examined the fears cur
rently besetting the United
States and other free nations and
gave his considered judgment that
they are exaggerated.
He conceded "the men in the
Kremlin" might start a global war
"in a fit of madness or through mis
caluclation." But he said they are
aware of the sobering risks that
"make war, let us say, less likely."
The President pledged that the
hydrogen bomb, now powerful
enough to knock out whole cities,
will not "be used by our initiative."
He listed as the nation's main
"apprehensions," these five points:
