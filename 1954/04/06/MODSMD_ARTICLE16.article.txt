## 'I Don't Care' 
### 
It was an interesting week for Daily staffers
who were questioning 119 Stanford students
about whether they thought 18-year-olds
shuuld have the right to vote.
They learned that if Stanford is typical, 18-
year-olds don't particularly care if they have
the vote or not. While many students backed
up "yes" and "no" answers with well through
out reasons, most just shrugged. "Well, if
they're old enough to fight," or "They're just
not old enough yet." Few had studied the pros
and cons of the question. Most admitted that
their answers were spur of-the moment.
With the majority of the students we polled,
we would probably agree that the average 18
year-old is not ready for full political responsi
bility.
But we do believe that after we're 18 we
must assume at least partial responsibility. For
the first time we have left our parents to fight,
to work, to study on our own. We have begun

a three-year training period in which to learn
how to make important political decisions.
We wonder how many of the students The
Daily polled realize the importance and the
value of the three years between 18 and 21.
We wonder how many are using these three
years to prepare themselves for legal, eco
nomic, and political adulthood.
When we find that most students just don't
care about their own and nine million other
potential votes, we wonder whether most stu
dents believe that these three years of partial
responsibilty are just a pleasant reprieve from
any responsibility at all.
We worry when 18-year-olds say, "Well, I
don't care. 1 don't have to vote on it." And we
wonder what's going to happen when 20-year
olds who never cared before suddenly find
that their futures depend on their answers to
questions they never bothered to think about.
