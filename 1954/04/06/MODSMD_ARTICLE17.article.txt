# Foreign Scholars and Understanding
## 
### 
Last Friday the ASSU Foreign Scholarship
Committee announced the selection of the
eight 1954-55 foreign scholars.
And today we have received several more
letters from Stanford students commenting on
the questions posed by the Swiss student who
asked about "American materialism."
We wonder if the students who have both
the editorial quoting the Swiss letter and the
news story on the Foreign Scholarship Com
mittee's selections have realized the connection
between the two.
Both articles fell under the general (and too
often abstract) theme of "international under
standing." The questions of the "young Swiss"
and a few ol the comments in some of the an
swers to his letter indicate a lack of that under
standing or clearly call attention to its need.
The article in yesterday's DaiJy on the selec
tion of foreign scholars indicates that construc
tive efforts are being made to improve that
understanding.
In the words of committee co-chairman Mike

Brand, the ASSU scholarship program is truly
"world-wide." Next year's scholars will repre
sent eigftit nations from all sections of the
world. One will come from the fringe of the
Iron Curtain, Yugoslavia. And one will come
from Switzerland.
All of them will be under obligation to mix
with and talk with as many students as possible
during their year at Stanford. They will be
here to learn of America and its people. And
they will be here to give Stanford students a
chance to learn of their countries.
Their presence will provide an opportunity
for those- who read the questions of the "young
Swiss" and wanted to answer. Their presence
will provide an opportunity for those who read
the questions of the "young Swiss" and reacted
with smug indignation.
Understanding demands effort. .The Foreign
Scholarship Committee and the students it is
bringing to Stanford are giving that effort. We
hope the Stanford student will meet it.
