# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
OM LAKE LAC. OPENINGS
''This is the day!" yelled Dick Shooshan, chief
rooster of the Senior Class, as he jumped out. of
bed last Sunday. "This is the day when the Senior
Class officially opens Lake Lag."
Up at the Alpha Delt house, the Alpha Delt band

members were readying their in
struments, as they had been dele
gated to set the musical back
ground for the festivities. Owen
Killingsworth, the Corp Yard
handyman, was setting up the
sound system at the Lake. Mary
Lou Hanna, the chairman of the
event, had already seen to it. that
the Golden State ice cream people
and the Coca Cola gentlemen
would bring vast tonnage of their

products to the Lake to take care of the parched
throats that would result from the hot sun.
Then someone did what they should have done be
fore they made all the arrangements: they looked
outside and what they saw were skies—crying harder
than a collie hit by Albert Payson Terhune.
Anyone with a sense of history could have pre
dicted that the opening was destined for failure,
because not in the living memory have the heavens
smiled on a Lake Lag opening.
Take last year, for example. Old timers couldn't
recall a winter in which there had been so many

consecutive days of sun. For 38 straight days the
skies had been bluer than Jack Benny's eyes. Senior
Excom, failing to remember pVevious openings, had
prepared hundreds of sandwiches for the flocks of
student humanity who would be on hand. Then,
Lake Lag opened. And for the first time in 38 days, it
rained.
A group of assorted well-wishers, attired in sweat
shirts, overcoats and leather jackets, stood shivering
around the Alpha Delt band. The band blew frigid
Dixieland notes over the gray, murky, swimmerless
waters, and everybody stood around agreeing through
chattering teeth, "Yes, it is a cold day."
Dick YVeismann, the people's choice, was hiding
in his barricaded room in the Delt house. Weismann
was supposed to officially christen Lake Lag for
swimming purposes by being thrown in the lake.
Weismann, setting the example for his 7.000 Farm
constituents, reneged.
Even before that, Lake openings have had an
unblemished record of unsuccess. Three years ago,
there was four inches of snow on where the rolling
foothills rise, about the third time this has happened
since the University's founding. The ice was too thin
for skating, however.
Rumor has it that a delegation of farmers from a
California drought area are going to request Senior
Excom to schedule a week ol Lag openings in order
to relieve the drought situation.

bed last Sunday. "This is the day when the Senior
Class officially opens Lake Lag."
Up at the Alpha Delt house, the Alpha Delt band

members were readying their in
struments, as they had been dele
gated to set the musical back
ground for the festivities. Owen
Killingsworth, the Corp Yard
handyman, was setting up the
sound system at the Lake. Mary
Lou Hanna, the chairman of the
event, had already seen to it. that
the Golden State ice cream people
and the Coca Cola gentlemen
would bring vast tonnage of their

products to the Lake to take care of the parched
throats that would result from the hot sun.
Then someone did what they should have done be
fore they made all the arrangements: they looked
outside and what they saw were skies—crying harder
than a collie hit by Albert Payson Terhune.
Anyone with a sense of history could have pre
dicted that the opening was destined for failure,
because not in the living memory have the heavens
smiled on a Lake Lag opening.
Take last year, for example. Old timers couldn't
recall a winter in which there had been so many

consecutive days of sun. For 38 straight days the
skies had been bluer than Jack Benny's eyes. Senior
Excom, failing to remember pVevious openings, had
prepared hundreds of sandwiches for the flocks of
student humanity who would be on hand. Then,
Lake Lag opened. And for the first time in 38 days, it
rained.
A group of assorted well-wishers, attired in sweat
shirts, overcoats and leather jackets, stood shivering
around the Alpha Delt band. The band blew frigid
Dixieland notes over the gray, murky, swimmerless
waters, and everybody stood around agreeing through
chattering teeth, "Yes, it is a cold day."
Dick YVeismann, the people's choice, was hiding
in his barricaded room in the Delt house. Weismann
was supposed to officially christen Lake Lag for
swimming purposes by being thrown in the lake.
Weismann, setting the example for his 7.000 Farm
constituents, reneged.
Even before that, Lake openings have had an
unblemished record of unsuccess. Three years ago,
there was four inches of snow on where the rolling
foothills rise, about the third time this has happened
since the University's founding. The ice was too thin
for skating, however.
Rumor has it that a delegation of farmers from a
California drought area are going to request Senior
Excom to schedule a week ol Lag openings in order
to relieve the drought situation.
