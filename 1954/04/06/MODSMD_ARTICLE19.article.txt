# CAMPUS OPINION
## An Answer to Mr. Dunn 
### 
To the Editor:
While sympathizing with Mr. Dunn's outburst, in
his letter to the Editor of April 2nd, I feel it is time
a fa*v misunderstandings were cleared up between
American and European students, for I have viewed
with alarm some of the recent, violent clashes of
opinion. The two basic points of difference seem to
be concerning "materialism" and "culture" (which
has somehow been confused with "intellectualism").
To the foreign student observer, who has only a
brief view of American life, much of the social be
behavior seems to fall into certain patterns: the
stereotyped greetings; the slang everyone uses; the
emphasis on group activity; the non-acceptance of ec
centric personal traits; the very phrase, "The Ameri
can Way of Life." In Europe, young people pride
themselves on their differences, in personality and
interests; in America, they pride themselves on their
achievements, for this is a more competitive life than
that of Europe.
Many Americans are justifiably furious because
Europeans do not seem adequately grateful for the
economic aid given them. If the European view
point seems cynical, it must he remembered that
many Europeans feel that the United States is
giving aid only because she feels herself directly
threatened. Years of suffering and neglect are
harder to forget than large amounts of money paid
by one government to another.
On the intellectual question, I would disagree
strongly with Mr. Dunn's statement that "Europe is

full of envious anti-Americanism, particularly on the
intellectual level." There are probably greater intel
lectual opportunities in America than elsewhere; yet,
except in science, I doubt if Americans lead in any
sphere of the intellectual world.
It is not intellectual envy that brings European
students to America; they come from a desire to learn
about the people and their way of life. They over
emphasize American materialism because a highly
competitive economic society jars on their back
ground. They are hopelessly misguided in their snap
impressions as the American tourists who consider
Europeans backward because their standard of living
is lower.
The point is that Americans and Europeans have
many cultural contacts in common, but they have
naturally developed along different lines in their
ways of life. I have been in this country for two and
a half years, and I am enjoying my experience. My
personal experience was that it was difficult to ad
just myself to some of the basic differences at first.
I accepted this as part of my education.
In conclusion. I hope The Daily will continue to
print controversial articles. Tolerance and explana
tion are better instruments for teaching than derision
and boasting. I hope it is still possible for us to respect
people even though they hold opinions which are
radically different from our own; here, to me, lie the
roots of democracy. If tolerance cannot be attained by
personal contact with people of similar cultural back
grounds, where is the hope of world peace?

about the people and their way of life. They over
emphasize American materialism because a highly
competitive economic society jars on their back
ground. They are hopelessly misguided in their snap
impressions as the American tourists who consider
Europeans backward because their standard of living
is lower.
The point is that Americans and Europeans have
many cultural contacts in common, but they have
naturally developed along different lines in their
ways of life. I have been in this country for two and
a half years, and I am enjoying my experience. My
personal experience was that it was difficult to ad
just myself to some of the basic differences at first.
I accepted this as part of my education.
In conclusion. I hope The Daily will continue to
print controversial articles. Tolerance and explana
tion are better instruments for teaching than derision
and boasting. I hope it is still possible for us to respect
people even though they hold opinions which are
radically different from our own; here, to me, lie the
roots of democracy. If tolerance cannot be attained by
personal contact with people of similar cultural back
grounds, where is the hope of world peace?

To the Editor:
While sympathizing with Mr. Dunn's outburst, in
his letter to the Editor of April 2nd, I feel it is time
a fa*v misunderstandings were cleared up between
American and European students, for I have viewed
with alarm some of the recent, violent clashes of
opinion. The two basic points of difference seem to
be concerning "materialism" and "culture" (which
has somehow been confused with "intellectualism").
To the foreign student observer, who has only a
brief view of American life, much of the social be
behavior seems to fall into certain patterns: the
stereotyped greetings; the slang everyone uses; the
emphasis on group activity; the non-acceptance of ec
centric personal traits; the very phrase, "The Ameri
can Way of Life." In Europe, young people pride
themselves on their differences, in personality and
interests; in America, they pride themselves on their
achievements, for this is a more competitive life than
that of Europe.
Many Americans are justifiably furious because
Europeans do not seem adequately grateful for the
economic aid given them. If the European view
point seems cynical, it must he remembered that
many Europeans feel that the United States is
giving aid only because she feels herself directly
threatened. Years of suffering and neglect are
harder to forget than large amounts of money paid
by one government to another.
On the intellectual question, I would disagree
strongly with Mr. Dunn's statement that "Europe is

full of envious anti-Americanism, particularly on the
intellectual level." There are probably greater intel
lectual opportunities in America than elsewhere; yet,
except in science, I doubt if Americans lead in any
sphere of the intellectual world.
It is not intellectual envy that brings European
students to America; they come from a desire to learn
about the people and their way of life. They over
emphasize American materialism because a highly
competitive economic society jars on their back
ground. They are hopelessly misguided in their snap
impressions as the American tourists who consider
Europeans backward because their standard of living
is lower.
