After both eights got off to an'
even start, the Card sweepswingers,
stroked by Bill Findlay, began to
pull slowly ahead until at the half
way point they held a one-length
advantage.
The USC oarsmen, not to be de
nied, raised their count and began
to close the gap, but could not over
come the stubborn Stanfords, to the
joy of the partisan onlookers on the
shore.
Indian rower Findlay, a veteran
of three varsity years, was com

who pulled the number five oar in
the Trojan shell.
In a three-way preliminary race,
a strong Card frosh outdistanced the
Stanford and Southern California
JV's by respective distances of one
and five and one-fourth lengths.
The Papoose rowers, stroked by
Bob Lewis, took an early lead and
held it all the way to win going
away. The victors' time was 6:20.
