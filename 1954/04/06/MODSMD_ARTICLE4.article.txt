# 18 OR 21
## Change In Voting Age Considered 
### BARBARA TUERK 
Solli in his 1952 campaign
platform and in his 1954 mes
sage to Congress, President Ei
senhower strongly advocated
giving the vote to the 18 21-year
age group.
Right now hills under considera
tion in House and Senate commit
tees call for a constitutional amend- I
ment to make 18 the legal voting !
age in all states.
If these bills pass two-thirds of j
both houses, the amendment will go i
to the states for ratification. How- j
ever, it is unlikely that today's 18- I
year-olds will vote before they are'
21.
The amendment must be ratified
by three-fourths of all the states.
And although bills calling for a
lowered age have been coming up
frequently in almost every state
since 1941, only one state has passed
such a bill. Only in Georgia have
18-ycar-olds been given the vote by
state action.
There arc now tf.l] million peo
ple in (he 18 - to - 21 - year age
group. .If the same proportion of
them voted as in other age groups,
the 18-to-2J-year-olds would pro
vide about .'1.8 million new votes—
six per cent of the national vote.
Probable political effects of these
new votes are not certain. Some
forecasters have tried to predict the
future by studying the voting rec
ord of the 21-to-29-year-old voters,
the group whose voting pattern
would probably prove closest to that
of the 18-to-21-year-olds.
The 21-to-29-year-olds have tradi
tionally voted the same way as the
rest of the voters, only more so.
Thus, when Eisenhower won 52 pet
cent of the total vote, he won 57
per cent of the young vote. And
Truman and Roosevelt, when the
Democrats were in power, won
more support from the young voters
than from any other group.
In Georgia, where IR-to-21-
year-olds have voted for 14 years,
there has been no significant dif
ference between their voting and
that of the 21-to-29-year-olds.
Some political observers believe
that the present Republican back
ing for the 18-year-old vote can be
traced to the dominant Issues on
which the two parties are now cam
paigning.
Democrats are now stressing the
Republicans' failure to act against
the threat of a major recession, an
issue which has little appeal for 18-
| year-olds who never knew the 193,'!
depression.
Republicans are campaigning on
the claim that their party halted
the Korean war, a claim which
has tremendous appeal for young
voters of draft age.
Public opinion on the question of
18-year-old voting shifts frequently.
During years when 18-ycar-olds arc
