# Foreign Scholar Lists Three Major Problems Facing Postwar Germany
## 
### SHIRLEY ELDER 
There are three major prob
lems to be considered when
dealing with Germany today,
according to ASSU scholarship
holder Kurt Seidel. The 21-year
old history major from Eonn,
Germany, listed these problems
in a recent interview:
1. "Constitution of our own sov
ereignty" or unification witb free
dom and liberty. This, he believes,
cannot be achieved in the near fu
ture except at the expense of free
dom or liberty.
2. European unification and
strength, he explained, to establish
a bargaining position to work for
unity.
Integration of Germany in the
European community, "National
ism in Germany is dead—at least
as a major issue," he said. "The
major issue now is to overcome
old outworn nationalisms."
As another consideration under
the general heading of unification,
Kurt brought in the European De
fense Community (EDC), which has
been blocked by France through
fear of a reawakening of German

nationalism. The EDC, however,
Kurt feels, is Europe's only alterna
tive as a defense against further
aggressive wars.
Kurt plans to return to Bonn af
ter this year for three more years of
law study before entering the Ger-

man diplomatic service. He will re
ceive his A.B. degree here in June.
ITc likes California and the
United States hut, he complains,
"Your Chamber of Commerce de
ceived me and I didn't even bring

a sweater." Someone must have
gotten confused because the.v told
Kurt that it was always sunny in
California.
Kurt's home from 1937 until 1947
was Dresden, Germany. When the !
partition was made, that area was
included in the Russian zone.
"Soon," he says,"I was to bccome
acquainted again with a system of I
spiritual tutelage, with suppression |
and coercion. The Nazi regime had
been exchanged for the dictatorship j
of the Communists."
"In 1947, my family and I were j
forced to flee on three days' notice |
because the printing firm in which j
my father was employed as a tech
nical director was to be removed to I
Russia with all its skilled workers !
and with its machinery. Some of j
my friends who continued to offer
active resistance were condemned to
long terms of imprisonment," he
added as he told of their rapid flight
across the border and a narrow es
cape from Russian soldiers.
All of their belongings were lost
in the move but, with some help
from the Red Cross, Kurt and his
family were soon re-establishing
a home in Bonn.
His experiences, he emphasizes,
have confirmed his aims and the
will to stand up against any kind of
oppression. "The German people,"
Kurt says, "will not again endorse
an emotional appeal such as Hit
ler's." They arc more sober and re
flective now, he said.
Kurt will probably spend next
summer seeing more of the United
States before returning to three
more years of study at home. In
line with the policy of having the
ASSU scholars live in a different
dorm each quarter, Kurt lived fall
quarter in the Beta house, this
quarter is in Toyon, and next quar
ter will move to the DU house.
