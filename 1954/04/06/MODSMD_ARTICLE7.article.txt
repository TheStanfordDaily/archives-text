# Hayes Talks On Liberty, Christianity
## 
### EDA MENDELS 
"Wherever Christian ideals
have been generally accepted
and their practice sincerely at
tempted, there is a dynamic
liberty; and wherever Christi
anity has been ignored or re
jected, persecuted o.r chained
to the state, there is tyranny."
So spoke Dr. Carlton J. H. Hayes
last night in his lecture in Memorial
Auditorium. His speech on "Indi
viduality and Liberty" was the first
of three Raymond Fred West Me
morial Lectures. Tonight Dr. Hayes
will discuss "Plural Authority," and
Wednesday, "Progress and Compas
sion." Both of these lectures will
be in Memorial Auditorium at 7:30
p.m.
Dr. Hayes refuted the assumption
that the most basic characteristic
of Western civilization is material.
"I do not deny the existence or im
portance of material factors in civili
zation or the part they may play in
altering it. What I do assert is that
they are not so basic or so distin
guishing as spiritual religious fac
tors."
"Our Western civilization could
not he what it is without its being
fostered by Western Christianity."
Even those who reject or ignore
the Christian religion abide by the
mores which emanate from it, Dr.
Hayes explained.
"The West's peculiar emphasis on
individuality and liberty is a feature
which has historically been influ
enced by Christianity and which has
crucial significance in our age," he
pointed out. Dr. Hayes emphasized
that, he did not discount the Judaeo-
Graeco roots of Christianity.
"The West's idea of the dignity
and worth of each and every human
being has been naturally and logi
cally derived from the Christian
doctrines of incarnation and resur
rection. Jesus Christ does not seem
to have been immediately concerned
with any mass movement or any
program of social reform, but social
movements have been indirect re
sults."
"In the face of Christian pre
cepts of individuality and freedom,
our Western civilization has never
developed a caste system. More
over, women have always en
joyed a greater freedom in our
civilization than in any other. . . .
Without that background of free
dom in practice as well as in
theory, the further later develop
ments of personal liberty could
hardly have taken place."
The lecture series is "part of Stan
ford's observance of Columbia Uni
versity's bicentennial," President J.
Wallace Sterling said when he intro
duced the speaker. Dr. Hayes is a
"life long Columbian," having taken
his undergraduate studies there and
having served on the faculty 47
years since then.
