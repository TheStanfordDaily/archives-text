# Eisenhower, Churchill Believe Tests of H-Bomb Create Better Chances for World-wide Peace
## Churchill Protests Britain 'Eased Out' of Atom Treaty 
### 
LONDON, April 5 (UP) —Stormy H-bomb debate in Commons
disclosed today that the Truman administration eased Britain out
of an atomic partnership set up secretly in wartime by Prime Mini
ster Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt.
Churchill blamed President Truman for keeping the agreement

guiet when legislation against
the sharing of atomic secrets
was in the making. And he
blamed Laborite Prime Minister
Clement R. Attlee for letting Mr. I
Truman do it.
Commons later passed unani
mously a Laborite motion calling for
"immediate" British initiative in
bringing about a meeting of Church
ill, President Eisenhower, and So
viet Premier Georgi Malenkov.
In a parliamentary session rare |
for its turbulent political slugging, \
Churchill also:
1. Refused to ask the United
States to end hydrogen bomb tests
in the Pacific. He said the tests "in
creased the chances of world peace
more than the chances of world
war."
2. Said the Russians "arc much
closer on the heels of the U.S. in
the development of the hydrogen
bombs than they ever were in
atomic bombs."
3. Agreed to accept the principle
of a Labor party motion urging a
top-level meeting of the Big Three
on the H-bomb if the Laborites
would not push him into hasty ef
forts to arrange such a meeting.
Churchill pilloried Attlee in a
rough and tumble argument across
the aisle in Commons after disclos
ing, with President Eisenhower's
consent, the secret atomic agree
ment with Mr. Roosevelt at the
Quebec conference in 1943.
He charged that Attlee. as lead
er of the Labor government after
Churchill's wartime coalition,
"abandoned" the agreement. Red
faced and shouting, Attlee inter
rupted to deny it.
He said it never had occurred to
him that the Truman administration
had concealed the agreement from
the late Sen. Brian McMahon. who
drafted the atomic secrets act that
shut out Britain.
Churchill charged that Attlee
should have checked on it. Attlee
said he flew to Washington and tried
to, but the administration told him
it was too late.
The debate developed into one of
the most turgid political clashes
since the war.
