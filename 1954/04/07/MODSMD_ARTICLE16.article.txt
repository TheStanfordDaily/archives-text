NEW YORK, April 6 (UP)—
Sen. Joseph Fl. McCarthy
charqed toniqht the United
States delayed research on the

die" because ol the delay.

vision program broadcast over the
Columbia Broadcasting S y u t e in .
The time was given to him to reply
to tn attack made on him by CBS
newscaster Edward P. Murrow
"If there were no Communists in
our government, why did we delay
lor 18 months—delay our research
on the hydrogen bomb, even though
our intelligence agencies were re
porting, day aftoi day, that the Rus
sians were feverishly pushing their
i development of the hydrogen
bomb?" McCarthy asked.
McCarthy devoted « large por
tion of the filmed program to ait
attach on Murrow.
McCarthy posed the question,
'What do the Communists think of
me and Edward R Murrow?" He
j then read from the Daily Worker of
j March 9, In that issue, he said,
J there were seven articles and one
1 principal editorial attacking McCar
thy. The same issue, he said. list!.
! as one of the night's "best bets on
TV" the Ed Murrow show.
McCarthy said Murrow 20 years
ago was engaged in propaganda
for Communist causes, including
the Institute for International Ed
ucation. Murrow was an acting
i director and was chosen to act as
a representative by a Soviet agen
i i:y to do a job which would nor
mally be done by the Russian se
cret police, McCarthy said.
Murrow answered in a prepared
i statement that. McCarthy's "reck
j less and unfounded attempt to im
j pugn my loyalty is iust one more
example of his typical tactic of at
j tempting to tie up to Communism
anyone who disagrees with him."
Of McCarthy's chargc he did a job
in the Institute for International
Education that would normally he
done by Soviet secret police, Mur
row said, "That is false."
He said he is proud of his asso
ciation with the Institute and said
others associated with it are Sec
retary of State John Foster Dulles
i and Milton Eisenhower, the Pres
j ident's brother.
j Murrow also said, "With his mas-
J sive research on me, the Senator
| could not even get my present re
! lationships with CBS straight. He
repeatedly referred to me as the ed
ucational director of CBS, a position
I have not held for 17 years."
