### 
WASHINGTON, April 6 (UP)
— Boston attorney Samuel P.
Sears, who failed to tell Senate
investigators about his pro-Mc-
Carthy views, withdrew today
as counsel for the inquiry into
Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy's row
with the Army.
The Permanent Senate Investi
gating subcommittee unanimously
accepted his resignation and began
looking for another counsel. But
Acting Chairman Karl E. Mundt (R ,
S.D.) said the televised hearings
scheduled to start next week "may
be delayed a little."
Mundt. in a lengthy report on
the subcommittee's harried efforts
to obtain a counsel, disclosed that
the group once hoped to get Fed
eral Judge Harold Medina for the
post. Chief Justice Earl Warren
and other members of the Su
preme Court unanimously vetoed
the idea, he said.
Mundt said the subcommittee
went back to the Supreme Court a
second time in hopes of getting a
federal judge for the job. The high
tribunal thought it would be setting
a "dangerous precedent" to have a
judge step down from the bench for
such an assignment, he said.
Mundt said he made his state
ment to answer charges that the
subcommittee might be "stalling"
or failing to "proceed with dili
gence and energy" in getting the
long - delayed Army - McCarthy
hearings under way.
He said he has the names of "one
or more attorneys as potential
choices" which he will submit to the
subcommittee tomorrow. He said 10
attorneys already have said they arc
"not available" for the post.
Sears, who appeared grim despite
efTorts to be friendly, said he feels
he is "completely qualified" to con
duct. the hearings "impartially and
in fairness to all." But he said the
test was whether he had the full
confidence of all involved and of the
people.
Sears was hired last Thursday as
"impartial counsel for the inquiry.
Hours later, Boston newspaper files
showed lie had praised McCarthy
publicly in 1952 and offered to raise
campaign funds for him.
