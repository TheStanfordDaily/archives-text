# DAILY EDITORIALS-FEATURES
## We Want Themâ€”Brief 
### 
The major portion of today's editorial column
is being devoted to Campus Opinion, the sec
tion which offers students a medium for the
expression of individual ideas and viewpoints.
The Daily has stated in the past that it wishes
o encourage that expression. We are intent
on seeing that student opinion has the oppor
tunity of public consideration in The Daily's
columns. We are too frequently aware that
most students are more interested in listening
than speaking, more intent on sifting the ideas
of others than forming their own, more inclined
to consider "expert " polished ideas than those
of "nonexperts

We want students to speak, and we are en
couraged when they are as expressive as they
have been this week. We hope to continue to
give as much space as possible to the letters
that come into this office.
But that space is limited, and we currently
face the problem of publishing the backlog of
letters which have come into this office. To
meet the space limitations, we request that
students keep their letters short. If they must
exceed about 200 words, we suggest that the
writer meet with the editor to agree on possible
editing.
