# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Swiss and Mr. Dunn

To the Editor:
When J read The Daily's editorial of Thursday,
April 1, I was surprised. But 1 was far more sur
prised when I iead the Campus Opinion on Friday,
April 2. Mi. Richard Dunn, you seem to be very
angry at this innocent young Swiss author. Why?
It is obvious that the Swiss author of the article in
"Jeunesse" knows very little about the United States.
He is certainly mistaken, too, in equating the Ameri
can way of life to communism. But YOU, Mr. Dunn,
YOU, why don"t YOU give him your answers on his
many questions? Are you able to give satisfying
answers? Or are you blind and refuse to see the
understandable reasons for the young author's poorly
formulated statements?
You mention the American wealth which saved
Europe from economic collapse, and that Europeans
owe you "a damn sight more" than just "gauche
commercialism." All right, Mr. Dunn, but do you
realize that you saved with your money not only
Europe, but yourselves? Don't think that Europeans
are not grateful; but they are also disillusioned that
nothing else but material aid comes from your
country. In the face of communism, there are more

important values to send to a destructed continent
than just money! But what else besides money do
you have to send? That's precisely what the young
Swiss author has asked you.
Mr. Dunn, your idea of the young Swiss, clamor
ing for armed assistance from the United States wer£
Switzerland to become threatened by aggression is
very, very funny. The Stanford Chappie would have
better use for this kind of .statement than The Daily.
You prove yourself, Mr. Dunn, that you know as
little about Switzerland as the young Swiss knows
about the United States. So let me tell you: It is
not a Swiss habit to cry for aid, since the Swiss have
defended successfully their independence for the last
GUIS years! They are proud of that and even in 1954
no Swiss would humiliate himself to the point of
"crying" for aid.
1 am glad that the young Swiss author will not read
your article. It would confirm his opinion that Amer
ica's pride stays and falls with the dollar. World
understanding requests mutual knowledge of the
countries, not "immature and shallow thinking."

An Answer to llie 'Young Swiss'

To the Editor:
Students of Switzerland, you raise some interesting
questions! We realize how easily Europeans gain
the impression that American students "are nourished
on presei-ved food, saturated by television, and be
lieve in the omnipotence of the atom." This impres
sion is given by most of our papers, advertising, and
movies sent abroad.
But America is more than the facade these media
present. Behind the standardized taste you hear
about are unpublicized men and women. Some work
on miracle drugs to prevent polio and cure cancer.
Others write books and music and create art that
has not yet stood the test of time.
Some work for housing improvements and civil
rights. Their fame may lie in the future when they
are recognized. It is unfortunate that current medi
ocrity and sensation often makes the papers.
O'ur tradition of free speech still remains, religious

freedom exists to a great extent, and every mnn has
the opportunity to'vote and pursue the finer values of
life. No one train of thought is followed in our
schools and in our homes.
Our view of progress and our long tradition of man's
diversity make it impossible for any one rigid
ogy to exist. 112
Therefore when you ask us, Jeunesse, "Where do
you seek man's raison d'etre?" we cannot answer you
because we are all so different. We invite you to meet
us through student exchanges, in person through the
exchange of letters and ideas. If we could work and
study together you would not see us as the stereo
types of businessmen, politicians, and movie stars you
write about.
They are only a small part of America. We want
you to see us as individuals, not as a nation. We
would like to see you that way, too.

Foreign Scholars and 'Objectivity*

To the Editor:
I question the wisdom of the Foreign Scholarship
Committee's selection of Petar Macanovic, a Yugo
slav, to be one of next year's foreign scholars. It
has always been my understanding that the purpose
of our foreign scholarship program is twofold. One
purpose has been that we students at Stanford would
benefit by conversing and exchanging ideas with
outstanding students from other countries. A second,
equally important, purpose has been the achievement
of a better understanding of our own country; the
program is based on the hope that the foreign scholars
who come here will, when they return, be able to
give to their countrymen an accurate, uncolored,
objective account of life in America.
Macanovic's presence here will probably fulfill
one purpose of our foreign scholarship program; it
will be intellectually stimulating to many students
h«jre to fconverse and exchange ideas with an avowed
Communist. But I doubt that the second purpose of
Macanovic's scholarship will be realized. Will Ma
canovic be able to learn and observe objectively dur
ing his year here? When he returns to Yugoslavia
will he be able to report his American experiences
objectively? If he gets to like America and Ameri
cans, -and lealnk to appreciate our way of life, will

he be able to speak up and tell others about it
freely? Will he ever be able to deviate from the
Yugoslav Communist Party line without endangering
his life? Because Yugoslavia is under a Communist
dictatorship there is not sufficient prospective mu
tuality of benefit to justify awarding one of our
foreign scholarships to a Yugoslav; in Macanovic's
case, a basic purpose of the ASSU scholarship will not
be realized.
In these days of rising tuition costs the Foreign
Scholarship Committee should be more careful than
ever to award our foreign scholarships in such a way
lhnt we who finance them are reasonably assured that
their purposes will be achieved. Since we can afford
only a limited number of foreign scholarships each
year, wouldn't it be better to award all of those
scholarships to individuals who when they return to
their countries .wou|d at. least be able to report and
discuss their experience's in the United States freely
and objectively? Surely, this year there must have
been many equally well-qualified applicants from
countries not dominated by communism. The Foreign
Scholarship Committee must have had good reasons
for selecting Macanovic; I for one woidd like to know
them,

Pan-American ism-A Fiasco

To the Editor:
It was by chance that 1 picked up The Daily at the
Lane Library this past week and was very amused to
read Professor Hilton's comments on the 10th Con
ference of the Americas.
I was in Mexico at the time the conference was
being held at Caracas and was able to compare the
reaction of the Mexican and American press. After
reading Dr. Hilton's statements, I feel I should
clarify some points, from a "Latin's viewpoint," for
the Stanford student body.
Latin America did not go to the conference with
the sole purpose of antagonizing "Big Brother" or
with a premeditated role of hostility. Hostility arose
when the Dulles proposal came on the floor for a
Council of American States empowered with "in
vestigating capacity" to take "joint" action in case
that any one nation may fall to the cancer of com
munism. The point then became which was the
greatest potential menace: international communism
or American invention?
How could "Big Brother" puzzle thus over our
skepticism of investigating councils in the presence
of open violation of the rights and personal integrity
of U.S. citizens by your own Wisconsin senator in
your own home?
The opposition came not as a move to vote down
th? Dulles proposal, but as a move to modify it so

that it read clearly.
Latin America did not go to Caracas to trade
sovereignty for papier mache horses. We did not
go to express a national hysteria over communism.
Communism exists in Latin America, open and active;
it is a problem, but not magnified to madness by fear.
We went to discuss commerce . . . which helps
raise the material standard of living of millions who
may be ultimately driven to communism to poverty
right in "Big Brother's" back yard.
We do not feel that the U.S. is obligated to give us
anything. We don't want "loans." We want investors
and technical know-how to develop the undeveloped
potential, to raise industry and absorb surplus labor,
to manufacture tools and improve agricultural pro
duction, to increase wealth to pay for health and
education.
I judge the Caracas Conference a failure for the
U.S. in that Mr. Dulled was amazingly successful
in shattering in a few days' work two decades of
relatively successful Democratic Party-inspired "Good
Neighbor Policy." I judge it a fracas for us in that
it is now obvious what before was only apparent:
Pan-Americanism is a flamboyant fiasco inadequate
to handle the real problems of the American Re
publics.

Pan-American ism-A Fiasco

To the Editor:
It was by chance that 1 picked up The Daily at the
Lane Library this past week and was very amused to
read Professor Hilton's comments on the 10th Con
ference of the Americas.
I was in Mexico at the time the conference was
being held at Caracas and was able to compare the
reaction of the Mexican and American press. After
reading Dr. Hilton's statements, I feel I should
clarify some points, from a "Latin's viewpoint," for
the Stanford student body.
Latin America did not go to the conference with
the sole purpose of antagonizing "Big Brother" or
with a premeditated role of hostility. Hostility arose
when the Dulles proposal came on the floor for a
Council of American States empowered with "in
vestigating capacity" to take "joint" action in case
that any one nation may fall to the cancer of com
munism. The point then became which was the
greatest potential menace: international communism
or American invention?
How could "Big Brother" puzzle thus over our
skepticism of investigating councils in the presence
of open violation of the rights and personal integrity
of U.S. citizens by your own Wisconsin senator in
your own home?
The opposition came not as a move to vote down
th? Dulles proposal, but as a move to modify it so

that it read clearly.
Latin America did not go to Caracas to trade
sovereignty for papier mache horses. We did not
go to express a national hysteria over communism.
Communism exists in Latin America, open and active;
it is a problem, but not magnified to madness by fear.
We went to discuss commerce . . . which helps
raise the material standard of living of millions who
may be ultimately driven to communism to poverty
right in "Big Brother's" back yard.
We do not feel that the U.S. is obligated to give us
anything. We don't want "loans." We want investors
and technical know-how to develop the undeveloped
potential, to raise industry and absorb surplus labor,
to manufacture tools and improve agricultural pro
duction, to increase wealth to pay for health and
education.
I judge the Caracas Conference a failure for the
U.S. in that Mr. Dulled was amazingly successful
in shattering in a few days' work two decades of
relatively successful Democratic Party-inspired "Good
Neighbor Policy." I judge it a fracas for us in that
it is now obvious what before was only apparent:
Pan-Americanism is a flamboyant fiasco inadequate
to handle the real problems of the American Re
publics.

The Swiss and Mr. Dunn

To the Editor:
When J read The Daily's editorial of Thursday,
April 1, I was surprised. But 1 was far more sur
prised when I iead the Campus Opinion on Friday,
April 2. Mi. Richard Dunn, you seem to be very
angry at this innocent young Swiss author. Why?
It is obvious that the Swiss author of the article in
"Jeunesse" knows very little about the United States.
He is certainly mistaken, too, in equating the Ameri
can way of life to communism. But YOU, Mr. Dunn,
YOU, why don"t YOU give him your answers on his
many questions? Are you able to give satisfying
answers? Or are you blind and refuse to see the
understandable reasons for the young author's poorly
formulated statements?
You mention the American wealth which saved
Europe from economic collapse, and that Europeans
owe you "a damn sight more" than just "gauche
commercialism." All right, Mr. Dunn, but do you
realize that you saved with your money not only
Europe, but yourselves? Don't think that Europeans
are not grateful; but they are also disillusioned that
nothing else but material aid comes from your
country. In the face of communism, there are more

important values to send to a destructed continent
than just money! But what else besides money do
you have to send? That's precisely what the young
Swiss author has asked you.
Mr. Dunn, your idea of the young Swiss, clamor
ing for armed assistance from the United States wer£
Switzerland to become threatened by aggression is
very, very funny. The Stanford Chappie would have
better use for this kind of .statement than The Daily.
You prove yourself, Mr. Dunn, that you know as
little about Switzerland as the young Swiss knows
about the United States. So let me tell you: It is
not a Swiss habit to cry for aid, since the Swiss have
defended successfully their independence for the last
GUIS years! They are proud of that and even in 1954
no Swiss would humiliate himself to the point of
"crying" for aid.
1 am glad that the young Swiss author will not read
your article. It would confirm his opinion that Amer
ica's pride stays and falls with the dollar. World
understanding requests mutual knowledge of the
countries, not "immature and shallow thinking."

An Answer to llie 'Young Swiss'

To the Editor:
Students of Switzerland, you raise some interesting
questions! We realize how easily Europeans gain
the impression that American students "are nourished
on presei-ved food, saturated by television, and be
lieve in the omnipotence of the atom." This impres
sion is given by most of our papers, advertising, and
movies sent abroad.
But America is more than the facade these media
present. Behind the standardized taste you hear
about are unpublicized men and women. Some work
on miracle drugs to prevent polio and cure cancer.
Others write books and music and create art that
has not yet stood the test of time.
Some work for housing improvements and civil
rights. Their fame may lie in the future when they
are recognized. It is unfortunate that current medi
ocrity and sensation often makes the papers.
O'ur tradition of free speech still remains, religious

freedom exists to a great extent, and every mnn has
the opportunity to'vote and pursue the finer values of
life. No one train of thought is followed in our
schools and in our homes.
Our view of progress and our long tradition of man's
diversity make it impossible for any one rigid
ogy to exist. 112
Therefore when you ask us, Jeunesse, "Where do
you seek man's raison d'etre?" we cannot answer you
because we are all so different. We invite you to meet
us through student exchanges, in person through the
exchange of letters and ideas. If we could work and
study together you would not see us as the stereo
types of businessmen, politicians, and movie stars you
write about.
They are only a small part of America. We want
you to see us as individuals, not as a nation. We
would like to see you that way, too.

Foreign Scholars and 'Objectivity*

To the Editor:
I question the wisdom of the Foreign Scholarship
Committee's selection of Petar Macanovic, a Yugo
slav, to be one of next year's foreign scholars. It
has always been my understanding that the purpose
of our foreign scholarship program is twofold. One
purpose has been that we students at Stanford would
benefit by conversing and exchanging ideas with
outstanding students from other countries. A second,
equally important, purpose has been the achievement
of a better understanding of our own country; the
program is based on the hope that the foreign scholars
who come here will, when they return, be able to
give to their countrymen an accurate, uncolored,
objective account of life in America.
Macanovic's presence here will probably fulfill
one purpose of our foreign scholarship program; it
will be intellectually stimulating to many students
h«jre to fconverse and exchange ideas with an avowed
Communist. But I doubt that the second purpose of
Macanovic's scholarship will be realized. Will Ma
canovic be able to learn and observe objectively dur
ing his year here? When he returns to Yugoslavia
will he be able to report his American experiences
objectively? If he gets to like America and Ameri
cans, -and lealnk to appreciate our way of life, will

he be able to speak up and tell others about it
freely? Will he ever be able to deviate from the

about the United States. So let me tell you: It is
not a Swiss habit to cry for aid, since the Swiss have
defended successfully their independence for the last
GUIS years! They are proud of that and even in 1954
no Swiss would humiliate himself to the point of
"crying" for aid.
1 am glad that the young Swiss author will not read

understanding requests mutual knowledge of the

An Answer to llie 'Young Swiss'

To the Editor:
Students of Switzerland, you raise some interesting
questions! We realize how easily Europeans gain
the impression that American students "are nourished
on presei-ved food, saturated by television, and be
lieve in the omnipotence of the atom." This impres
sion is given by most of our papers, advertising, and
movies sent abroad.
But America is more than the facade these media
present. Behind the standardized taste you hear
about are unpublicized men and women. Some work
on miracle drugs to prevent polio and cure cancer.
Others write books and music and create art that
has not yet stood the test of time.
Some work for housing improvements and civil
rights. Their fame may lie in the future when they
are recognized. It is unfortunate that current medi
ocrity and sensation often makes the papers.
O'ur tradition of free speech still remains, religious

freedom exists to a great extent, and every mnn has
the opportunity to'vote and pursue the finer values of
life. No one train of thought is followed in our
schools and in our homes.
Our view of progress and our long tradition of man's
diversity make it impossible for any one rigid
ogy to exist. 112
Therefore when you ask us, Jeunesse, "Where do
you seek man's raison d'etre?" we cannot answer you
because we are all so different. We invite you to meet
us through student exchanges, in person through the
exchange of letters and ideas. If we could work and
study together you would not see us as the stereo
types of businessmen, politicians, and movie stars you
write about.
They are only a small part of America. We want
you to see us as individuals, not as a nation. We
would like to see you that way, too.

Foreign Scholars and 'Objectivity*

To the Editor:
I question the wisdom of the Foreign Scholarship
Committee's selection of Petar Macanovic, a Yugo
slav, to be one of next year's foreign scholars. It
has always been my understanding that the purpose
of our foreign scholarship program is twofold. One
purpose has been that we students at Stanford would
benefit by conversing and exchanging ideas with
outstanding students from other countries. A second,
equally important, purpose has been the achievement
of a better understanding of our own country; the
program is based on the hope that the foreign scholars
who come here will, when they return, be able to
give to their countrymen an accurate, uncolored,
objective account of life in America.
Macanovic's presence here will probably fulfill
one purpose of our foreign scholarship program; it
will be intellectually stimulating to many students
h«jre to fconverse and exchange ideas with an avowed
Communist. But I doubt that the second purpose of
Macanovic's scholarship will be realized. Will Ma
canovic be able to learn and observe objectively dur
ing his year here? When he returns to Yugoslavia
will he be able to report his American experiences
objectively? If he gets to like America and Ameri
cans, -and lealnk to appreciate our way of life, will

he be able to speak up and tell others about it
freely? Will he ever be able to deviate from the
Yugoslav Communist Party line without endangering
his life? Because Yugoslavia is under a Communist
dictatorship there is not sufficient prospective mu
tuality of benefit to justify awarding one of our
foreign scholarships to a Yugoslav; in Macanovic's
case, a basic purpose of the ASSU scholarship will not
be realized.
In these days of rising tuition costs the Foreign
Scholarship Committee should be more careful than
ever to award our foreign scholarships in such a way
lhnt we who finance them are reasonably assured that
their purposes will be achieved. Since we can afford
only a limited number of foreign scholarships each
year, wouldn't it be better to award all of those
scholarships to individuals who when they return to
their countries .wou|d at. least be able to report and
discuss their experience's in the United States freely
and objectively? Surely, this year there must have
been many equally well-qualified applicants from
countries not dominated by communism. The Foreign
Scholarship Committee must have had good reasons
for selecting Macanovic; I for one woidd like to know

Pan-American ism-A Fiasco

To the Editor:
It was by chance that 1 picked up The Daily at the
Lane Library this past week and was very amused to
read Professor Hilton's comments on the 10th Con
ference of the Americas.
I was in Mexico at the time the conference was
being held at Caracas and was able to compare the
reaction of the Mexican and American press. After
reading Dr. Hilton's statements, I feel I should
clarify some points, from a "Latin's viewpoint," for
the Stanford student body.
Latin America did not go to the conference with
the sole purpose of antagonizing "Big Brother" or
with a premeditated role of hostility. Hostility arose
when the Dulles proposal came on the floor for a
Council of American States empowered with "in
vestigating capacity" to take "joint" action in case
that any one nation may fall to the cancer of com
munism. The point then became which was the
greatest potential menace: international communism
or American invention?
How could "Big Brother" puzzle thus over our
skepticism of investigating councils in the presence
of open violation of the rights and personal integrity
of U.S. citizens by your own Wisconsin senator in
your own home?
The opposition came not as a move to vote down
th? Dulles proposal, but as a move to modify it so

that it read clearly.
Latin America did not go to Caracas to trade
sovereignty for papier mache horses. We did not
go to express a national hysteria over communism.
Communism exists in Latin America, open and active;
it is a problem, but not magnified to madness by fear.
We went to discuss commerce . . . which helps
raise the material standard of living of millions who
may be ultimately driven to communism to poverty
right in "Big Brother's" back yard.
We do not feel that the U.S. is obligated to give us
anything. We don't want "loans." We want investors
and technical know-how to develop the undeveloped
potential, to raise industry and absorb surplus labor,
to manufacture tools and improve agricultural pro
duction, to increase wealth to pay for health and
education.
I judge the Caracas Conference a failure for the
U.S. in that Mr. Dulled was amazingly successful
in shattering in a few days' work two decades of
relatively successful Democratic Party-inspired "Good
Neighbor Policy." I judge it a fracas for us in that
it is now obvious what before was only apparent:
Pan-Americanism is a flamboyant fiasco inadequate
to handle the real problems of the American Re
publics.

To the Editor:
When J read The Daily's editorial of Thursday,
April 1, I was surprised. But 1 was far more sur
prised when I iead the Campus Opinion on Friday,
April 2. Mi. Richard Dunn, you seem to be very
angry at this innocent young Swiss author. Why?
It is obvious that the Swiss author of the article in
"Jeunesse" knows very little about the United States.
He is certainly mistaken, too, in equating the Ameri
can way of life to communism. But YOU, Mr. Dunn,
YOU, why don"t YOU give him your answers on his
many questions? Are you able to give satisfying
answers? Or are you blind and refuse to see the
understandable reasons for the young author's poorly
formulated statements?
You mention the American wealth which saved
Europe from economic collapse, and that Europeans
owe you "a damn sight more" than just "gauche
commercialism." All right, Mr. Dunn, but do you
realize that you saved with your money not only
Europe, but yourselves? Don't think that Europeans
are not grateful; but they are also disillusioned that
nothing else but material aid comes from your
country. In the face of communism, there are more

important values to send to a destructed continent
than just money! But what else besides money do
you have to send? That's precisely what the young
Swiss author has asked you.
Mr. Dunn, your idea of the young Swiss, clamor
ing for armed assistance from the United States wer£
Switzerland to become threatened by aggression is
very, very funny. The Stanford Chappie would have
better use for this kind of .statement than The Daily.
You prove yourself, Mr. Dunn, that you know as
little about Switzerland as the young Swiss knows

Communism exists in Latin America, open and active;

We do not feel that the U.S. is obligated to give us
anything. We don't want "loans." We want investors

to manufacture tools and improve agricultural pro

I judge the Caracas Conference a failure for the

The Swiss and Mr. Dunn

To the Editor:
When J read The Daily's editorial of Thursday,
April 1, I was surprised. But 1 was far more sur
prised when I iead the Campus Opinion on Friday,
April 2. Mi. Richard Dunn, you seem to be very
angry at this innocent young Swiss author. Why?
It is obvious that the Swiss author of the article in
"Jeunesse" knows very little about the United States.
He is certainly mistaken, too, in equating the Ameri
can way of life to communism. But YOU, Mr. Dunn,
YOU, why don"t YOU give him your answers on his
many questions? Are you able to give satisfying
answers? Or are you blind and refuse to see the
understandable reasons for the young author's poorly
formulated statements?
You mention the American wealth which saved
Europe from economic collapse, and that Europeans
owe you "a damn sight more" than just "gauche
commercialism." All right, Mr. Dunn, but do you
realize that you saved with your money not only
Europe, but yourselves? Don't think that Europeans
are not grateful; but they are also disillusioned that
nothing else but material aid comes from your
country. In the face of communism, there are more

important values to send to a destructed continent
than just money! But what else besides money do
you have to send? That's precisely what the young
Swiss author has asked you.
Mr. Dunn, your idea of the young Swiss, clamor
ing for armed assistance from the United States wer£
Switzerland to become threatened by aggression is
very, very funny. The Stanford Chappie would have
better use for this kind of .statement than The Daily.
You prove yourself, Mr. Dunn, that you know as
little about Switzerland as the young Swiss knows
about the United States. So let me tell you: It is
not a Swiss habit to cry for aid, since the Swiss have
defended successfully their independence for the last
GUIS years! They are proud of that and even in 1954
no Swiss would humiliate himself to the point of
"crying" for aid.
1 am glad that the young Swiss author will not read
your article. It would confirm his opinion that Amer
ica's pride stays and falls with the dollar. World
understanding requests mutual knowledge of the
countries, not "immature and shallow thinking."

An Answer to llie 'Young Swiss'

To the Editor:
Students of Switzerland, you raise some interesting
questions! We realize how easily Europeans gain
the impression that American students "are nourished
on presei-ved food, saturated by television, and be
lieve in the omnipotence of the atom." This impres
sion is given by most of our papers, advertising, and
movies sent abroad.
But America is more than the facade these media
present. Behind the standardized taste you hear
about are unpublicized men and women. Some work
on miracle drugs to prevent polio and cure cancer.
Others write books and music and create art that
has not yet stood the test of time.
Some work for housing improvements and civil
rights. Their fame may lie in the future when they
are recognized. It is unfortunate that current medi
ocrity and sensation often makes the papers.
O'ur tradition of free speech still remains, religious

freedom exists to a great extent, and every mnn has
the opportunity to'vote and pursue the finer values of
life. No one train of thought is followed in our
schools and in our homes.
Our view of progress and our long tradition of man's
diversity make it impossible for any one rigid
ogy to exist. 112
Therefore when you ask us, Jeunesse, "Where do
you seek man's raison d'etre?" we cannot answer you
because we are all so different. We invite you to meet
us through student exchanges, in person through the
exchange of letters and ideas. If we could work and
study together you would not see us as the stereo
types of businessmen, politicians, and movie stars you
write about.
They are only a small part of America. We want
you to see us as individuals, not as a nation. We
would like to see you that way, too.

Foreign Scholars and 'Objectivity*

To the Editor:
I question the wisdom of the Foreign Scholarship
Committee's selection of Petar Macanovic, a Yugo
slav, to be one of next year's foreign scholars. It
has always been my understanding that the purpose
of our foreign scholarship program is twofold. One
purpose has been that we students at Stanford would
benefit by conversing and exchanging ideas with
outstanding students from other countries. A second,
equally important, purpose has been the achievement
of a better understanding of our own country; the
program is based on the hope that the foreign scholars
who come here will, when they return, be able to
give to their countrymen an accurate, uncolored,
objective account of life in America.
Macanovic's presence here will probably fulfill
one purpose of our foreign scholarship program; it
will be intellectually stimulating to many students
h«jre to fconverse and exchange ideas with an avowed
Communist. But I doubt that the second purpose of
Macanovic's scholarship will be realized. Will Ma
canovic be able to learn and observe objectively dur
ing his year here? When he returns to Yugoslavia
will he be able to report his American experiences
objectively? If he gets to like America and Ameri
cans, -and lealnk to appreciate our way of life, will

he be able to speak up and tell others about it
freely? Will he ever be able to deviate from the
Yugoslav Communist Party line without endangering
his life? Because Yugoslavia is under a Communist
dictatorship there is not sufficient prospective mu
tuality of benefit to justify awarding one of our
foreign scholarships to a Yugoslav; in Macanovic's
case, a basic purpose of the ASSU scholarship will not
be realized.
In these days of rising tuition costs the Foreign
Scholarship Committee should be more careful than
ever to award our foreign scholarships in such a way
lhnt we who finance them are reasonably assured that
their purposes will be achieved. Since we can afford
only a limited number of foreign scholarships each
year, wouldn't it be better to award all of those
scholarships to individuals who when they return to
their countries .wou|d at. least be able to report and
discuss their experience's in the United States freely
and objectively? Surely, this year there must have
been many equally well-qualified applicants from
countries not dominated by communism. The Foreign
Scholarship Committee must have had good reasons
for selecting Macanovic; I for one woidd like to know
them,

To the Editor:
It was by chance that 1 picked up The Daily at the
Lane Library this past week and was very amused to
read Professor Hilton's comments on the 10th Con
ference of the Americas.
I was in Mexico at the time the conference was
being held at Caracas and was able to compare the
reaction of the Mexican and American press. After
reading Dr. Hilton's statements, I feel I should
clarify some points, from a "Latin's viewpoint," for
the Stanford student body.
Latin America did not go to the conference with
the sole purpose of antagonizing "Big Brother" or
with a premeditated role of hostility. Hostility arose
when the Dulles proposal came on the floor for a
Council of American States empowered with "in
vestigating capacity" to take "joint" action in case
that any one nation may fall to the cancer of com
munism. The point then became which was the
greatest potential menace: international communism
or American invention?
How could "Big Brother" puzzle thus over our
skepticism of investigating councils in the presence
of open violation of the rights and personal integrity
of U.S. citizens by your own Wisconsin senator in
your own home?
