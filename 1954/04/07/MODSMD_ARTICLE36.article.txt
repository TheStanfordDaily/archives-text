Ray Young, Stanford's compactly
built sophomore moundsrrian, hit
and pitched the Indians to a 3-2 vic
tory over UCLA and won for him
self Daily Athlete of the Week hon
ors in an 11-inning effort Friday.
Young fashioned a neat nine-hit
! ter in the extra-inning contest and
would have thrown a shutout had it
not been for two infield errors, al
lowing both Bruin scores.
In the bottom of the 11th, he
I switched from the mound to the
batters' box and promptly won his

own game. With the bases loaded
and no one out, he pushed a perfect
bunt past the pitcher toward the
second baseman for a single as Bob

Evans scampered home with the de
ciding run.
Young also slapped a single to
right center to rack up a two-for
five day at the plate.
The win was Young's second in a
row over the Uclans. He set the
Bruins down on six hits and 12
strikeouts, 4-2, in the Cards' CIBA
opener in Westwood last month. He
also rapped UCLA pitching for a
triple.
The Indians' mentor Everett Dean
is quite pleased with the soph hurl
er's swift development as a front
line varsity pitcher: "No one could
ask any more of Ray than what he
has been doing."
Dean continued: "His performance
was a pleasant surprise to everyone
except the coaches, who felt sure
that he would give a good account
of himself.
"Ray has the characteristics of a
winning pitcher—excellent control,
fine poise on the mound, and good
stuff. And he's the best fielding
pitcher on the squpd."
Young was the standout of last
year's freshman team, posting a 6-1
record and a 1.6 earned run aver
age.
