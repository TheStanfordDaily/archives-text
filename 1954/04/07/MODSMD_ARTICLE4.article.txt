# CARLTON HAYES SAYS:
## 'Plural Authority' Concept Supports Western Liberty 
### JOANNE OLSON 
The couccpt of "pluial authority" has been a counterweight
and a prop to liberty throughout our Western civilization, accord
ing to Dr. Carlton J. H. Hayes, noted Columbia historian, who
spoke last night in Memorial Auditorium.
In his second Raymond Fred West Memorial lecture, Hayes

pointed out that "without authority
liberty can become license, and so
ciety drift into chaos and anarchy."
"Personal liberty, in the age-lonin
Christian tradition, has been coup
led with and qualified by respect for
authority, as affirmed by Christ
himself in the famous dictum 'Give
to Caesar what is Caesar's ami to

God what is God's.'"
In ancient pagan civilizations,
Hayes stated, there was no dis
tinction between a ruler's secular
and religious authority. In (lit;
West, however, a tradition of plu
ral authority lias grown up
through Christian precept and
practice.
"Strictly s p c a king, union of
church and state has never existed
in our Western civilization," ho said.
"Co-operation, yes, but. union, that
is, identity or amalgamation, no."
Constitutional government as we
know and cherish it is a heritage
from Christian Europe of the Middle
Aqe, promoted by two factors of pe
culiarly Christian nature, ho noted.
"The first of these," he said, "is
the individuality and sense of per
sonal dignity inherent in Chris
tian teaching. The second is the
concept of plural authority, which
is primarily a division and separa
tion of power between church
and state."
Since ancient times, Western civ
ilization has become more and more
secularized, according to Hayes,
with the state steadily extending its
function.
free of religious obligations, but,"
"Every citizen, if he likes, can bp
Hayes pointed out, "whether he
likes it or not he must pay taxes
and contribute to the soical wel
fare."
The historian cited nationalism
and the technological and industrial
revolutions of recent centuries as
factors contributing to this secular
ization.
"The most disturbing attendant
of modern industrialization," he
said, "is the growing materialism,
often to the exclusion of the spir
itual This is attested by the wide
spread feeling in the present
emergency that we can buy
friends abroad."
"Our strength lies fundamentally
in out will to preserve out way of
life and our heritage of liberty,"
Hayes concluded, "We cannot vest
complete and sole authority in the
secular state .without rendering it
ultimately despotic in the Russian
Communist manner. It is still need
ful, I submit, to render not only 'to
Caesar what is Caesar's,' but 'to
God what is God's. "
