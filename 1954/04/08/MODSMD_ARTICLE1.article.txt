The L'xecutive Committee last night heard a report from the
lecerilly organized Student Government Committee outlining the
procedure to be followed by that group in recommending pos

Harrison Schmidt, chairman of the Student government group,

preconceptions" and will examine
"the entire area" of student govern
ment before presenting their recom
mendations to Excom.
Schmidt said the aim of his com
mittee will be two-fold—to deter
mine means of perfecting and sim
plifying student, government and to
increase student participation in
their government.

l>e held with library officials next
week to discus student and faculty
complaints.
Mishell said the library is con
sidering the possibility of a plan
which would separate the paying of
library delinquencies from registra

transcripts until all fines have been
paid.

Libe Com duties with those of Fun
damental Standards Committee, and
