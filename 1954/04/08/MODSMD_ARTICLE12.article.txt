that "I'm sure Joe McCarthy nev
er heard of this man."
Jenkins said, "I have no record,
publicly or otherwise, in respect to
Sen. McCarthy or what is called

controversy. My mind is completely
open."
He said he will "present the facts
without favoritism, in as fair and
thorough and impartial manner as
possible, and then it will devolve
upon the committee to make its de
cision."
Subcommittee members empha
sized that Jenkins did not. "volun
teer" for the counsel post as Sears
had done.

paign manager in Tennessee in

against former Sen. Kenneth Mc-
Kclhtr (I)., Tenn.).

Dirksen said Jenkins "made it
very, very manifest" that lie would

character and reputation. Other
subcommittee members said they
wanted to be sure there would be
no repetition of the Sears incident.
Jenkins described himself as a
"middle of the road" Republican.
He said that in the 1952 Presidential
race he probably would have been
called a "Taft Republican" rather
than an "Eisenhower Republican."

called a "Taft Republican" rather
than an "Eisenhower Republican."
WASHINGTON, April 7 (UP)—Ray H. Jenkins, a Southern Re
publican trial attorney, was picked today to direct the public in
quiry into the Army-McCarthy dispute, and Senate investigators
announced televised hearings will start April 21.
Acting Chairman Karl E. Mundt (R., S.D.) announced the selec
tion of the Knoxville, Tenn., lawyer 4 r

as counsel for the Permanent Senate
Investigating subcommittee. Sen.
Everett M. Dirksen (R., III.), a .sub
committee member, said he recom
mended Jenkins for the post.
Jenkins took over the job relin
quished 24 hours earlier by Boston
attorney Samuel P. Sears, who
withdrew Tuesday uvtder charges
that his pro - McCarthy statements
made it impossible for him to con
duct an "impartial" inquiry. Scars
was in the job only Hvc days.
Jenkins, a big 5V*-year-old, rud
dy-fared man, said he is "quite
positive I'm not prejudiced" about
McCarthy. IVlundt told reporters
that "I'm sure Joe McCarthy nev
er heard of this man."
Jenkins said, "I have no record,
publicly or otherwise, in respect to
Sen. McCarthy or what is called
McCarthyism. I have no precon
ceived notions on the merits of this
controversy. My mind is completely
open."
He said he will "present the facts
without favoritism, in as fair and
thorough and impartial manner as
possible, and then it will devolve
upon the committee to make its de
cision."
Subcommittee members empha
sized that Jenkins did not. "volun
teer" for the counsel post as Sears
had done.
Jenkins was Republican cam
paign manager in Tennessee in
1040 when Wendell Willkie made
his unsuccessful bid for the Presi
dency, and Rep. Howard Baker
(R„ Tenn.) ran for the Senate
against former Sen. Kenneth Mc-
Kclhtr (I)., Tenn.).

Dirksen said Jenkins "made it
very, very manifest" that lie would
not take the job unless the subcom
mittee made a thorough check of his
character and reputation. Other
subcommittee members said they
wanted to be sure there would be
no repetition of the Sears incident.
Jenkins described himself as a
"middle of the road" Republican.
He said that in the 1952 Presidential
race he probably would have been
called a "Taft Republican" rather
than an "Eisenhower Republican."
