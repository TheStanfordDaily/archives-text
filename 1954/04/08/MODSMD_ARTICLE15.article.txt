# President Knows of No H-Bomb Delay; New Blast in South Pacific Is Reported
## Blast Largest Anticipated 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 7 (UP)
— The government today an
nounced a "successful" new hy
drogen explosion just after Pres
ident Eisenhower asserted that
the United States is building H
bombs about as big as it in
tends to.
Atomic Energy Commission Chair
man Lewis L. Strauss also told a
Senate Appropriations subcommit
tee Mr. Eisenhower directed the
AEC to revise its new fiscal 1955
budget to provide for "greatly in
creased production of H-bombs and
other atomic weapons."
Strauss said the Commission's
original budget, submitted in Jan
uary, was overhauled the following
month after the President approved
"recommendations to bring about
greatly increased production of
thermo - nuclear weapons (H
-bombs)."
The AEC announced that the
third in its current series of hydro
gen blasts was "successfully carried
out" yesterday at its Pacific proving
grounds. Strauss said it produced
"information of great to
national defense."
Only shortly before Mr. Eisen
hower told a news conference the
United States does not intend to
build mightier H-bombs because
the city-wreckers now in its ar
senal meet all possible military
requirements.
For the same reason, 'he calmly
added that he has no fear Russia
might try to build progressively
bigger bombs. He indicaetd that,
from the military view, the point of
greatest efficiency and destructive
ness has been reached.
The Atomic Commission's brief
announcement did not say yester-
explosion was a hydrogen
blast. But Strauss, in a White House
statement a week ago, referred to
the current experimental program
as "a test series of thermonuclear
weapons."
The announcement also gave no
estimate of the destructive force
of the explosion, which brought to
at least 57 the number of nuclear
blasts by all countries since the
atomic weapons age was horn nine
years ago.
Congressional sources said pre
viously that called for the de
tonation sometime this month with
a destructive force equal to from
40,000,000 to 45,000,000 tons of TNT.
