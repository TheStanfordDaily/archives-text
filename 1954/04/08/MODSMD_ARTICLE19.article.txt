# Ike Friend Of Murrow
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 7 (UP)
—President Eisenhower said to
day he never heard of the delay
in hydrogen bomb research that
Senator Joseph R. McCarthy
charged might be fatal to the na
tion.
Shortly before, Chairman Sterling
Cole of the Senate - House Atomic
Committee, said that former Presi
dent Truman decided to build the
hydrogen bomb against the advice
of several top advisers, including
most members of the Atomic Energy
Commission.
The President also told a news
conference that CBS commentator
Edward R. Murrow, whom McCar
thy attacked, has been a friend of
his for several years.
Cole issued a formal statement in
which he said some members of the
Congressional Atomic Committee
also "expressed doubt" about the
wisdom of pressing the H - bomb
program. He said the committee as
a whole favored it.
The Congressman said the fact
there was "considerable discus
sion" on whether to build the
H-bomb is not of itself sinister,
nor does it imply that those who
opposed the President's (Tru
man's) final decision were moti
vated by a desire to lessen our
military strength."
"At the same time," he added, "we
know that there is no security sys
tem which can guarantee to be 100
per cent effective against traitors.
"Therefore, we cannot exclude
categorically the possibility that a
person or persons in our govern
ment might, have been motivated by
interests other than those of the
United States."
Cole made no direct mention of
McCarthy's suggestion that Commu
nists in the government were re
sponsible for delaying research on
the H-bomb for 18 months, but he
evidently referred to the Wisconsin
Senator's statement.
Mr. Eisenhower said he lias
been close to the chairman of the
Atomic Energy Commission and
the chairman never mentioned an
H-bomb delay. Furthermore, he
said, he had never heard of one.
Mr. Eisenhower also said present
city-wrecking H-bombs now are big
enough to meet all possible military
requirements and the United States
does not intend to enlarge them fur
ther. He was not afraid, for the same
reason, that Russia would build big
ger bombs than the U.S. wili.
Meanwhile, two members of the.
Congressional Atomic Energy
Committee demanded that Mc-
Carthy produce "any evidence" of
a deliberate H-bomb delay. One
described the Wisconsin Republi
can's statements as "absolutely ri
diculous."
McCarthy appeared on Murrow's
television program Tuesday night, to
answer an attack the commentator
made on him. In the course of the
broadcast the Senator said:
"If there were no Communists in
our government, why did we delay
for 18 months—delay our research
on the hydrogen bomb, even though
our intelligence agencies were re
porting, day after day, that the Rus
sians were feverishly pushing their
development of the hydrogen
bomb?"

for 18 months—delay our research
on the hydrogen bomb, even though
our intelligence agencies were re
porting, day after day, that the Rus
sians were feverishly pushing their
development of the hydrogen
bomb?"
WASHINGTON, April 7 (UP)
—President Eisenhower said to
day he never heard of the delay
in hydrogen bomb research that
Senator Joseph R. McCarthy
charged might be fatal to the na
tion.
Shortly before, Chairman Sterling
Cole of the Senate - House Atomic
Committee, said that former Presi
dent Truman decided to build the
hydrogen bomb against the advice
of several top advisers, including
most members of the Atomic Energy
Commission.
The President also told a news
conference that CBS commentator
Edward R. Murrow, whom McCar
thy attacked, has been a friend of
his for several years.
Cole issued a formal statement in
which he said some members of the
Congressional Atomic Committee
also "expressed doubt" about the
wisdom of pressing the H - bomb
program. He said the committee as
a whole favored it.
The Congressman said the fact
there was "considerable discus
sion" on whether to build the
H-bomb is not of itself sinister,
nor does it imply that those who
opposed the President's (Tru
man's) final decision were moti
vated by a desire to lessen our
military strength."
"At the same time," he added, "we
know that there is no security sys
tem which can guarantee to be 100
per cent effective against traitors.
"Therefore, we cannot exclude
categorically the possibility that a
person or persons in our govern
ment might, have been motivated by
interests other than those of the
United States."
Cole made no direct mention of
McCarthy's suggestion that Commu
nists in the government were re
sponsible for delaying research on
the H-bomb for 18 months, but he
evidently referred to the Wisconsin
Senator's statement.
Mr. Eisenhower said he lias
been close to the chairman of the
Atomic Energy Commission and
the chairman never mentioned an
H-bomb delay. Furthermore, he
said, he had never heard of one.
Mr. Eisenhower also said present
city-wrecking H-bombs now are big
enough to meet all possible military
requirements and the United States
does not intend to enlarge them fur
ther. He was not afraid, for the same
reason, that Russia would build big
ger bombs than the U.S. wili.
Meanwhile, two members of the.
Congressional Atomic Energy
Committee demanded that Mc-
Carthy produce "any evidence" of
a deliberate H-bomb delay. One
described the Wisconsin Republi
can's statements as "absolutely ri
diculous."
McCarthy appeared on Murrow's
television program Tuesday night, to
answer an attack the commentator
made on him. In the course of the
broadcast the Senator said:
"If there were no Communists in
our government, why did we delay
for 18 months—delay our research
on the hydrogen bomb, even though

porting, day after day, that the Rus
sians were feverishly pushing their
