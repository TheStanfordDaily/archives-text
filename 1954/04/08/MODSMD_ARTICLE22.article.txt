# A 						Wise Choice

### 
In yesterday's Campus Opinion column, we
printed a letter from a student who "questioned
the wisdom" of the Foreign Scholarship Com
mittee in the selection ot a student from Yugo
slavia.
The letter did not disclaim the value of the
presence at Stanford of a student from Com
munist Yugoslavia. But it did question whether
or not that student could return to Yugoslavia
at the end of his year at Stanfoid and speak
"objectively" of the United States.
There is always a risk that a foreign student
who has attended Stanford will not return to
his own country with an "objective" report.
And there is always the risk that the student

will not return at all. But those risks must be
weighed against the relative need of other na
tions to understand the United States and its
people.
The need for that understanding is strong in
a nation such as Yugoslavia. The United States,
and Stanford, must prove to the people who
have already fallen behind the Iron Curtain
that the intentions of the West are not wrapped
around policies of "imperialism" and "germ
warfare."
If the chance to offer that proof is given to
lis, we should accept it. If a student from Yugo
slavia can come to this country and Stanford,
we should accept him.
