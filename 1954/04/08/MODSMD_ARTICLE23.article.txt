## In Defense of Napoleon 
### 
To the Editor:
President Eisenhower said last night, "They (the
men in the Kremlin) remember Hitler. They remem
ber Mussolini. They have even studied Napoleon very
seriously. When dictators . .
1 would like to point out how questionable it seems
to,me and to many French as well .to call Napoleon
a dictator 'and treat him as a kind of Hitler or Stalin.
Napoleon belongs to the French Revolution (1789 to
1815). He was brought up in the ideals of the 18th
century. He was an "homme du siecle." In this re
spect he didn't betray the French Revolution. He has
been absolutely faithful to it. In 1789 the "Assemblee
Constituante" destroyed the old regime, the old so
ciety, but for ten years nobody was able to build up
another society. Indeed, after the fall of Robespierre
there was anarchy. At that time France needed new
rules and order. There was no doubt of the likeli

hood of what you call a "coup." The only doubt was
who would make it.
As Napoleon said once at a meeting of the State
Council, and later in his Memoirs, "Where I found
only sand, I built up a block of marble." This block
of marble is the Civil Code, the administrative or
ganization of France which exists today, and is the
only,stable constitution in France. During his reign
he was always VespeCtful to the law he established,
and never harmed private citizens. Of course, as a
general and as head of the state, lie was a man who
favored strong government.
But T put these questions: Is an army ruled in a
democratic way? Is not order through strong gov
ernment necessary after years of democratic anarchy?
In 1800 Napoleon was longed for. Nobody has ever
looked at him as a dictator and the head of a totali
tarian government such as Stalin's or Hitler's.
