# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
(Because of many requests, and spring nostalgia,
I'm forwarding a Bull Session that appeared last year,
slightly revised.)
I was sitting in the reserved book room yesterday,
studying my poly sci, and I got to thinking.
I find that the reserved book room is one of the

very best places to think about
things other than studies. I got to
thinking about time —that fan
tastic force that does all its jobs
so gradually and inconspicuously.
I got to thinking about how a
tall, brown - haired undergrad
with a Stanford jacket and a
crew cut who just walked into
the RBR v/ould in a few years be
sitting in a stuffy office in a

noisy city, or undergoing the
Rigors of military training. And about how ninyl>e
he'd wish he was back on the Farm.
And about how the rains and winds since the
University's opening have cut down the brown sand
stone of the Quad a few millionths of an inch.
About how the classrooms of this University have
ceated 77,457 students in 63 years, some of whom
have become bank presidents, and some of whom
have died paupers, some of whom have been foot
ball coaches, engineers, psychiatrists, insurance sales

men, lawyers, janitors, teachers, bone surgeons, news
paper writers, taxicab drivers, zoologists, presidents
of sprawling companies, and garbage collectors.
About the story the aged and ageless oak tree in
front of the main libe could tell if it could only talk.
About the approximate 1,240,000 man hours of
learning that one of the rooms in the inner Quad has
been the scene of, and about how most of those hours
have been forgotten long ago.
About how, in principle, things are the same on the
Farm now as they were 50 years ago; the wearing ap
parel is different and they have different fads now,
but the smoke goes up the chimney, just like it did
then, and we talk about classes, profs, dates, and
athletics just like we did then.
About how babies just now beginning to talk will
in several years be drinking coffee at the Cellar,
running for touchdowns at the Stadium, and direct
ing student activities from the ASSU office.
About how we in school will return in the years
to come with grey hair, or with no hair at all, and
with our faces wrinkled and our walk slower and
our posture a little more bent. And about how it
will all look the same and yet will be so unfamiliar.
And about how we'll do something that we scorn
now—long for the "good old days."
Then I kind of scolded myself for letting my
thoughts wander, 1 returned to my poly sci.

thinking about time —that fan
tastic force that does all its jobs
so gradually and inconspicuously.
I got to thinking about how a
tall, brown - haired undergrad
with a Stanford jacket and a
crew cut who just walked into
the RBR v/ould in a few years be
sitting in a stuffy office in a

noisy city, or undergoing the
Rigors of military training. And about how ninyl>e
he'd wish he was back on the Farm.
And about how the rains and winds since the
University's opening have cut down the brown sand
stone of the Quad a few millionths of an inch.
About how the classrooms of this University have
ceated 77,457 students in 63 years, some of whom
have become bank presidents, and some of whom
have died paupers, some of whom have been foot
ball coaches, engineers, psychiatrists, insurance sales

men, lawyers, janitors, teachers, bone surgeons, news
paper writers, taxicab drivers, zoologists, presidents
of sprawling companies, and garbage collectors.
About the story the aged and ageless oak tree in
front of the main libe could tell if it could only talk.
About the approximate 1,240,000 man hours of
learning that one of the rooms in the inner Quad has
been the scene of, and about how most of those hours
have been forgotten long ago.
About how, in principle, things are the same on the
Farm now as they were 50 years ago; the wearing ap
parel is different and they have different fads now,
but the smoke goes up the chimney, just like it did
then, and we talk about classes, profs, dates, and
athletics just like we did then.
About how babies just now beginning to talk will
in several years be drinking coffee at the Cellar,
running for touchdowns at the Stadium, and direct
ing student activities from the ASSU office.
About how we in school will return in the years
to come with grey hair, or with no hair at all, and
with our faces wrinkled and our walk slower and
our posture a little more bent. And about how it
will all look the same and yet will be so unfamiliar.
And about how we'll do something that we scorn
now—long for the "good old days."
Then I kind of scolded myself for letting my
thoughts wander, 1 returned to my poly sci.

(Because of many requests, and spring nostalgia,
I'm forwarding a Bull Session that appeared last year,
slightly revised.)
I was sitting in the reserved book room yesterday,
studying my poly sci, and I got to thinking.
I find that the reserved book room is one of the

very best places to think about
things other than studies. I got to
thinking about time —that fan
tastic force that does all its jobs
so gradually and inconspicuously.
