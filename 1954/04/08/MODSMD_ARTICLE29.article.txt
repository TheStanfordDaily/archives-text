Stanford bites into another peach
Saturday — SC's awesome spikers,
who haven't lost to Stanford since
early in the depression and will
easily carry the tradition into 1955.
Defending NCAA and PCC king,
and international ogre ui trackdom
.since the flappers, the Trojans host
the Cards' 26-man squad in the Los
Angeles Coliseum Saturday after
noon. It's the same old story . . .
SC has it again. Winners to date of
two duals, a relay, and a triangular
meet, Troy clashes with Stanford's
1-1 dual meet record. The Indians
were bombed by another top-rank
ing national .spike power last week,
the University of Michigan, BG-35,
but opened the season with a
squeaky victory over Fresno
State.
Coach Jack Weiershauser's In
dians can figure to win in three
events, the low and high hurdles
and the javelin, and possibly in the
shot put, but any additional tri

, umphs would be in the surprise
category.
Card high hurdler Gerry Wood's
14.7 clocking last week against the
Wolverines is better than any recent
SC achievement, although Trojan
Will Wright ripped off a 14.8 last
i Saturday against Occidental, which,
incidentally, surprised SC by losing
only 85Mj-50%.
Jim Luttrell carries Stanford's
hopes into the 220 low barrier event
but must equal or top his 24.3 fust
place against Michigan to head off
! SC's John Morgan and Ron Loy.
If Card Leo Long saiis the javelin
as he managed against Fresno State,
Troy should be out of it. SC's tops
is Doug Maijala's 199 ft. 9 in., while
| Long flung the spear 204 ft. 2 in.
! against Fresno. I
Stanford's A 1 Cheney and SC's
Fred Edwards should battle to the
j end for shot put honors.
"The team has yet to jell," Wei
| er.'hauser exclaimed. "In eight
| events we have men who have

never competed on the varsity be
fore, but," he continued, "the team
is going to end up a pretty good
squad and we'll give UCLA, Cal,
and Oxy a strong battle."
Trojan sprinters Howard Bugbee,
Joe Graffio. and Jim Lea, high
jumper Ernie Shelton, weight man
Des Koch, half-miler Bill Taylor,
and distance star Fernando Ledesma
are a few of Troy's stockholders
scheduled to sweep up the ribbons.

squeaky victory over Fresno
State.
Coach Jack Weiershauser's In
dians can figure to win in three
events, the low and high hurdles
and the javelin, and possibly in the
shot put, but any additional tri

, umphs would be in the surprise
category.
Card high hurdler Gerry Wood's
14.7 clocking last week against the
Wolverines is better than any recent
SC achievement, although Trojan
Will Wright ripped off a 14.8 last
i Saturday against Occidental, which,
incidentally, surprised SC by losing
only 85Mj-50%.
Jim Luttrell carries Stanford's
hopes into the 220 low barrier event
but must equal or top his 24.3 fust
place against Michigan to head off
! SC's John Morgan and Ron Loy.
If Card Leo Long saiis the javelin
as he managed against Fresno State,
Troy should be out of it. SC's tops
is Doug Maijala's 199 ft. 9 in., while
| Long flung the spear 204 ft. 2 in.
! against Fresno. I
Stanford's A 1 Cheney and SC's
Fred Edwards should battle to the
j end for shot put honors.
"The team has yet to jell," Wei
| er.'hauser exclaimed. "In eight
| events we have men who have

never competed on the varsity be
fore, but," he continued, "the team
is going to end up a pretty good
squad and we'll give UCLA, Cal,
and Oxy a strong battle."
Trojan sprinters Howard Bugbee,
Joe Graffio. and Jim Lea, high
jumper Ernie Shelton, weight man
Des Koch, half-miler Bill Taylor,
and distance star Fernando Ledesma
are a few of Troy's stockholders
scheduled to sweep up the ribbons.
Stanford bites into another peach
Saturday — SC's awesome spikers,
who haven't lost to Stanford since
early in the depression and will
easily carry the tradition into 1955.
Defending NCAA and PCC king,
and international ogre ui trackdom
.since the flappers, the Trojans host
the Cards' 26-man squad in the Los
Angeles Coliseum Saturday after
noon. It's the same old story . . .
SC has it again. Winners to date of
two duals, a relay, and a triangular
meet, Troy clashes with Stanford's
1-1 dual meet record. The Indians
were bombed by another top-rank
ing national .spike power last week,
the University of Michigan, BG-35,
but opened the season with a
squeaky victory over Fresno
State.
