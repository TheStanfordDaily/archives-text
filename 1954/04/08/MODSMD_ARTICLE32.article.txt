## The 						Inside Pitch 
### 
We were chatting with Everett Dean the other day about Stanford's t
newly appointed basketball coach Howie Dallmar. We had been reading I
all week about how great a player and coach Dallmar was, but we hadn't :
come across a line that told why he was great. So we decided to come -
straight to the source which was instrumental in developing Dallmar into t
an All-American eager. ,
We posed our question to the former cage mentor and present baseball (
coach. He leaned back in his chair and answered unhesitatingly, "Howie, |
if not the best, was one of the very best backboard players in Stanford |
history. He had good spring in his legs and cleared the ball out quickly (
for a fast hreak."
Dallmar, as we've surmised from reports, installed the fast break type
of play at Pennsylvania and indications are he'll use it here if he can ! j
find a good man to initiate it.
Continuing with a description of Dallmar's playing ability, Dean. re- ' '
marked that, "He,was a good team player and a dangerous shooter around i (

the foul ring. He was a strong player
and had a terrific drive off the pivot 1 i
man for close in shots." j 1
It was Dallmar's tremendous broad <
jump lay-ins which gained him East- (
ern fame in the professional ranks | <
with the Philadelphia Warriors of
the National Basketball Association. j
So Dallmar was a good team man.
And look at the team he played with: j
All-American Jim Pollard and All-
Southern Division players Don Bur
ness, Ed Voss and Bill Cowden. The
club only averaged 6 ft. 4 in. with
the shrimp of the club at G ft. 3 x /> in.
They were also national champions
posting a 27-4 mark.
Dallmar was a fine defensive play-,
er aside from his rebounding prow
ess, according to Dean. "He was a
very effective defensive player,
quick and agile for his size ((5 ft. 4V>
in.). He was good on interceptions,
and at shifting positions."
Now we have a picture of an all
around ballplayer. He could run
and shoot and defend with the best
of them. He could handle any as
signment on the court. At Stanford
he operated as a guard, but at Pen
nsylvania he was the pivot man and
led the Red and Blue through a

winning season, besides earning All-American honors that year.
As far as his best games were concerned, Dean believes Dallmar reached
his Stanford peak in the '42 IsfCAA play-offs. The, what might appropri
ately be called, "Drefcm Team" swept through the Southern Division with
an impressive 11-1 record and captured two out of three from Oregon
State and its Ail-American John Mandic 41-28, 33-42, and 40-35 to grab
the Coast title and earn a trip to Kansas City.
There Stanford rocked Rice 53-47 and Colorado 46-35 in preliminary
games moving into the finals against a highly touted Dartmouth five.
It was in this game that Dallmar earned the rare and much honored
title of a Stanford come-through performer. With Pollard sidelined with
an injury and Burness out of the game after five minutes because of
illness. Dallmar took command, rallied his mates and blasted the Indians
from the East 53-38 as Stanford became the toast of the cage world. Dall
mar was chosen the most valuable player in the tourney.
As far as coaching experience Dallmar has the advantage ol having
! acquired plenty of know how from top grade men. He got his start with
! Benny Neff, Lowell High's coach and came under the tutelage of Roy
! Hughes for a year at Menlo. and of course developed under Dean, who is
i one of the few coaches to be selected to the Basketball Coaches Hall ol
Fame and who had outstanding teams at Indiana as well as Stanford.
Dallmar profited by his play with Pennsylvania and picked up many
pointers from Warrior teammate Joe Fulks who was the NBA leading
i scorer before Mikan arrived on the scene.
The new Stanford mentor has had plenty of experience on the other
end too, guiding the Penn cage and baseball squads for six years. For
j several seasons he was coaching collegiate basketball and playing pro
at the same time.
Dean respects Dallmar's ability, stating that "he has kept Penn basketball
| and baseball near the top of the Ivy League with limited material."
At the same time he has developed some fine players including Ernie
■ Beck, three-time All-Ivy Leaguer and an Eastern scoring leader two sea
| sons ago.
Dallmar embarrassed his coach during the 1951 Christmas vacation. Dean
took his club to Pennsylvania on the Eastern trip and dropped a 59-58
decision.
Dean, obviously pleased that Dallmar will return from whence he
came, concluded that "he's a player's coach and has ability to work with
young fellows. Our boys are fortunate to have the opportunity to play
under him."
