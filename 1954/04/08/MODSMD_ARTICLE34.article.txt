# Frosh Whitewash Marin High 10-3
## 
### 
Stanford's frosh romped to an
easy 10-3 diamond victory over a
green, clumsy Marin Catholic High
School nine yesturday afternoon on
the local field.
Dick Clegg's frosh were in full
command all the way as the light
hitting and butter-fingered young
high schoolers never constituted a
threat.
Dave Bohnen, starting frosh
pitcher, allowed four hits in his five
inning stint. During the final four
frames Ray Looney surrendered
only one hit to the visitors.
Hal Messner again filled the role
of heavy hitter for the Stanfordites,
banging out four base hits, including
one triple, in four trips to the plate.
Marin committed five errors to
Stanford's three.
