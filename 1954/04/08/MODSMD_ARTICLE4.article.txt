"Social and intellectual develop
ments in the East, where Buddhism
and Islam arc the traditionally dom
inant religions, have been less pro
gressive than in the traditionally
Christian West." This was the basis
of Carlton J. H. Hayes' final lecture
last night in a series concerning
Religious Influence on Our Historic
Western Civilization.
Carlton Hayes, noted American
historian, delivered his lecture on
"Progress and Compassion" last
night as the final address in the
seventeenth series of Raymond Fred
West Memorial Lectures.
"The dynamic character of our
Western civilization curiously paral
lels the dynamic character of the
Christian religion," Hayes stated. He
expressed doubts that the differences
and contrasts between East and West
can be explained in economic terms.
"Potential wealth and natural re
sources of Asia have long been
greater than those of Europe," the
historian continued, "and the East
could have developed and exploited
them earlier and in superior fashion
if it had had the West's dynamism."
Charity and compassion have not
been only ideals but have inspired
much of the thought, laws, attitudes,
and actions of the West, Hayes ex
plained. He outlined the principal
causes of emancipation of slavery
and the continuous remedies of poor
labor conditions as reactions of
"Christian consciousness."
"From the wellsprings of Christian
compassion, our Western civilization
has drawn its inspiration, and its
sense of duty." Contribution to hos
pital development, advance of medi
cal sciencc' and surgery in the West,
and the non-acceptance of suicide
and infanticide arc all manifestations
of this compassion, according to
Hayes.
He suggested that the difficulties
concerning pacifism and recurrent
war may arise from "differences
among us about Christ's teaching in
the matter, and particularly about
the translation of the famous angelic
chorus in St. Luke's gospel, 'Glory
to God in the highest, and on earth,
peace and good will to men.'
"We also need," he concluded,
"hope to temper and supplant our
present fears and our tendency to
despair about, what, the present
world is. coming to."
