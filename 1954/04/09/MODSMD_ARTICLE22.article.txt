# Fraternities to Ask Sterling For Disciplinary Powers
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
An Inter-Fraternity Council recommendation to establish the
IFC as its own disciplinary force will be passed on to President
J. E. Wallace Sterling for final approval, Gene Dils, IFC president,
told The Daily yesterday.
The proposal, approved unanimously by the Inter-Fraternity

Board of Control, would set up a
10-man judiciary committee from
among the 23 fraternity representa
tives who form the IFC.
The plan would remove from the
IFB—a committee of 13 students,
faculty, administration, and frater
nity alumni—its present disciplinary
duties.
With the exception of the Univer
sity President's power as a final
judge of all IFC action, the new s' •
tem would place all responsibility
for fraternity discipline in the hands
of the students.
Dils and representatives from the
administration and the IFB will
meet with Dr. Sterling within the
next two weeks to consider the plan,
which is a result of four months'
discussion in the IFC.
The IFC unanimously voted the
recommendation.
Dils listed four reasons why the
IFC feels the change is needed.
1. "We think we can do our own
disciplining more efficiently and cl'
fectively than the IFB. The board
had to wait for a complaint befoi
it could take action. The IFC will
be aware of violations as they occur
and consider them immediately."
2. "We think there will be le
trouble from the fraternities because
of a better attitude among the
houses. They will not be trying to
play hide-and-seek with a distant
disciplinary force. The fraternities
will be looking out for each other
and for the fraternity system."
3. "Penalties will be more con
structive in order to help a hou:;c
with serious problems get back on
its feet and become a positive force
4. "We thing the proposed system
will create better public relation;,
between the fraternities and the
campus and the community because
the houses will not, get out of hand.
Corrective measures will be taken
before any problems become wide
spread."
The new 10-man committee wiil
be composed of the IFC president
and the secretary-treasurer, a chair
man and three other members a) -
pointed by the IFC president, and
four members elected by the IFC.
The judiciary committee will hear
the evidence in all cases which can.
before the IFC and then make a
strong recommendation to the IFC .
a whole. The IFC will take the fin d
action, subject to the approval of
the President, just as with the IFB.
Decisions by both the judi< m v
committee and the IFC in regard
to disciplinary measures will re
quire a two-thirds vote.

action, subject to the approval of
the President, just as with the IFB.

An Inter-Fraternity Council recommendation to establish the
IFC as its own disciplinary force will be passed on to President
J. E. Wallace Sterling for final approval, Gene Dils, IFC president,
told The Daily yesterday.
The proposal, approved unanimously by the Inter-Fraternity

Board of Control, would set up a
10-man judiciary committee from
among the 23 fraternity representa
tives who form the IFC.
The plan would remove from the
IFB—a committee of 13 students,
faculty, administration, and frater
nity alumni—its present disciplinary
duties.
With the exception of the Univer
sity President's power as a final
judge of all IFC action, the new s' •
tem would place all responsibility
for fraternity discipline in the hands
of the students.
Dils and representatives from the
administration and the IFB will
meet with Dr. Sterling within the
next two weeks to consider the plan,
which is a result of four months'
discussion in the IFC.
The IFC unanimously voted the
recommendation.
Dils listed four reasons why the
IFC feels the change is needed.
1. "We think we can do our own
disciplining more efficiently and cl'
fectively than the IFB. The board
had to wait for a complaint befoi
it could take action. The IFC will
be aware of violations as they occur
and consider them immediately."
2. "We think there will be le
trouble from the fraternities because
of a better attitude among the
houses. They will not be trying to
play hide-and-seek with a distant
disciplinary force. The fraternities
will be looking out for each other
and for the fraternity system."
3. "Penalties will be more con
structive in order to help a hou:;c
with serious problems get back on
its feet and become a positive force
4. "We thing the proposed system
will create better public relation;,
between the fraternities and the
campus and the community because
the houses will not, get out of hand.
Corrective measures will be taken
before any problems become wide
spread."
The new 10-man committee wiil
be composed of the IFC president
and the secretary-treasurer, a chair
man and three other members a) -

four members elected by the IFC.
