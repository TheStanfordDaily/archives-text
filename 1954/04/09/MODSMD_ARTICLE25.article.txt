# Solution Pending

An increasing number of inquiries by stu
dents on the scheduling of Memorial Auditor
ium has led The Daily to find out the answers
to two questions.
first, just what is the present situation? Sec
ond, what chances are there for improvement
in the future?
The answer to "what is the situation?" is
presented elsewhere on this page. From this
answer it is obvious that there is no easy solu
tion to the problem of scheduling programs in
Ihe auditorium. The present conflict of inter
ests will continue.
At the moment we can only hope that the
students, the Speech and Drama Department,
and the Committee on Public Exercises—each
understanding the other's needs—can continue
to compromise and work for an ultimate solu
tion. N
However, as is also indicated in this an
swer, there is definite hope for improvement
in the foreseeable future. Studies are now*
being conducted which indicate the University

may be able to sound-proof the doors and walls
, between Memorial Auditorium and the Little
Theater for an estimated $4,000. Earlier studies
had placed the cost at $40,000.
If the building were sound proofed, the
Speech and Drama Department would be able
to concentrate most of its academic work in
the Little Theater, freeing Mem Aud for larger
student activities. It would also allow Ram's
Head or other dramatic groups to rehearse
longer before each production, since there
would be less conflict with other programs.
The new Tresidder Union will also help re
lieve the burden on Mem Aud, since present
plans for the building include an auditorium.
We are echoing the hopes of all concerned
in urging the University to make the "possi
bility" of sound-proofing Mem Aud a reality.
This will be a major step toward the ultimate
solution of the problem. The final step won't
be taken until sometime in the nebulous fu
ture, when another large auditorium, at the
moment impossible, will also be a reality.
