## Make a Stand 
### 
To the Editor:
The elections are upon us again. Although there
are new candidates, we are still hearing the same
old platitudes. The candidates are once more peal
ing forth with trite statements, such as "I want to
help make Stanford better."
Why can't we have some candidates who will take
specific stands on how they propose to make Stanford
better? I for one would like to know just how the
candidates propose to vote on N.S.A. when the ques
tion (if our membership comes up again.

Tin l biannual lament of the election committee that
students do not vote would be a thing of the past if
the student body had something to vote for. Let's
have no more of those candidates who content them
selves to say I want to represent you. I want to be
sure that this time I am jiot voting for candidates who
once elected will make mealymouthed statements as
did those representative members of Excom who
said that they voted for Stanford membership in the
N.S.A., but were really against it.
