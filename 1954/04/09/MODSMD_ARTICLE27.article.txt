# 'Equally Rewarding'

To the Editor:
in reply to David Workman's letter on the value
of inviting a Yugoslavian student as a foreign schol
ar next year, I should like to give my reasons for
lei ling that the Foreign Scholarship Committee has
made a wise decisiqn in awarding Petar Macanovic
a : cholarship;- •
To me the this program is to make it pos
.\ibfe for students to' become .acquainted with and
appreciate the values Shcf Wf btflhire. different;

the foreign scholar "be able to give to their country
men an accurate, uneolored, objective account of life
in America." This sort of observation is impossible.
Any account of a foreign way of life will be "colored"
by and subjected to an interpretation made in the
light of a person's own cultural background.
Therefore, J feel, the purpose of this program is
rather to make it possible for these students to com
pare their ways of life with ours and seek means of
fitting these patterns together for better international
cooperation, and not of turning each foreign scholar
into an advocate of American institutions in his

homeland, as Mr. Workman suggests when he says,
"Will he (Petar Macanovic) be able to deviate from
the Yugoslav Communist Party line without losing
his life?"
Another criticism I have of Mr. Workman's reason
ing is his assumption that because Yugoslavia is a
communist dictatorship, there is not sufficient value
in awarding a scholarship to a Yugoslavian. The fact
that Yugoslavia is governed by a communistic regime
profitable,
ng-osfayjah and
SjSfiin are equally as totalitarian; yet we invite stu
dents from these countries without labeling them
"avowed" Fascists. Sweden and Switzerland are
much more Socialistic than we; again no distinction
is made. In fact, there is no reason to suppose that the
United States as a democracy cannot achieve inter
national understanding and cooperation with any
country no matter what ideology may dominate that
country's political institutions.
It is in our best interests to reach such under
standings, and inviting Petar Macanovic to study
heie will prove equally as rewarding as the other
scholarship awards.
