# A 						LACK OF TIME, SPACE, AND MONEY
## Mem Aud Poses Knotty Problems 
### PAT KING 
Memorial Auditorium, home
of Sunday Evening Flicks and
Western Civ lectures, is grad
ually becoming the center of
one of the knottiest problems
facing the University.
The problem involves time, space,
and money—and a lack of all three.
The problem involves the adminis
tration, the faculty, the students,
and to a lesser degree the residents
of Palo Alto and nearby communi
ties.
The problem is this: Memorial
Auditorium is not meeting the needs
of an expanding University.
The few students who have
bumped up against this problem
have been shocked and dismayed to
find that the auditorium is booked
almost solidly at least a year in ad
vance. At the present time, only a
lew open dates remain for the aca
demic year '54-'55.
To student organ:/.a turns, unable
to plan their activities more than a
quarter or two in advance, this
seems unfair. They resent being
"excluded" on the basis of a first
come first served policy. And they
don't understand why the Commit
tee on Public Exercises, which ar
ranges the booking of the audito
rium, can't "do something" about
the situation.
The committee would like to
'«lu something. But "doing some
thing" isn't a simple case of hold

ing all dates open for possible stu
dent use. In the first place, the
committee has emphasized, all
programs in Mem Aud are pre
sented fc.v the Stanford student
body. With the exception of guest
lecturers and concerts, students
participate in the production of all
programs. This is hardly a case
of student "exclusion," committee
members point out.
Secondly, the committee must
consider requests from many
sources which now have a valid
claim on the use of the auditorium.
Included on the "must-he-sched
uled" list are Tuesday Evening Se
ries, periodic events such a.s the
West Memorial Lectures, arid spe
cial programs sponsored by the com
mittee such as Bryan Green week.
Beyond this, high priority has
been given 10 the requirements of
annual Ram's Head productions,
ASSU Concert Series, and the Sun
day flicks.
Added to this is the fact that
Mem Aud, the only large build
ing available for all-campus af
fairs. also houses the Department
ol Speech and Drama. Second
only to the above "must go" ac
tivities is the academic program
of this department.
Unlike many departments, speech
and drama combines theoretical
training with practical experience.
As it is now set up, it must depend
on Mem Aud for its laboratory, a
laboratory essential for students
learning lighting, stage setting, act
ing, or directing.

| The department can, and does,
I make u e of the Little Theater
whenever possible. However, the
I corridor between the two audito-
I rium-; isn't sound-proofed; when one
is in use, the other is idle.
Rehearsals take up most of the
| time. Usually they must be sched-
J uled at night to avoid conflict with
l daytime cla ses. This, again, means
| no other group may use the audito
j Hum at the same time.
The Music Department is also de
pendent on Mein Aud for any sym
phony concerts.
The total of all these conflicting
deinaiuK is imply this. There are
roughly 24 weeks in the aca 'emu
year, <*v I(iS possible dates. Of
these, Ram's Head is customarily
given .'it) days in which to produce
the HV{ Game Gaieties, Winter
Quarter One-Acts, arid the Spring
i Show. Another 21 dates each arc
used hy the Tuesday Series and
the Sunday Hicks.
Of the remaining 90 days, the
| Speech and Drama Department gets
the first and biyge t slice. Any dates
j left after the "must be scheduled"
events have been booked are allot
| ted to students as their requests are
| received.
An entirely different problem is
the space within tiie auditorium it
self. Mem Aud seats 1,700 and ordi
j narily this is sufficient for Univer T
.sity functions. However, "big
names" such as Frank Lloyd Wright
tiave attracted over-capacity crowds.
This affects Palo Altans. Should
ihey be excluded to make room for

more students? And if student body
car.ls were necessary for admission,
what about faculty members and
their families? Above all, how can
the committee judge which "big
names" will draw a full house?
This, d len, is tht* problem. A new
building is financially impossible.
However, sound - proofing is now
wilhin the realm of possibility. Hut
until this "possibility" becomes a
reality, the Committee on Public
Exercises will be left with the di
lemma ol what to do with too many
worthy requests for the same space
on too few days.
