# From 'Immortal 21' to Service Group: Axe Society Has Grown in Size, Scope
## 
### RUTH WOLPE 
To the members of one group
on campus the "Immortal 21"
who stole the Axe from Cal are
immortal for another reason.
These immortal Stanford roughs
were the founders of the Axe
Society.
Originally membership in the So
ciety was limited to men. The proj
ects were similar to those now car
ried on by Cardinals, for example,
the Frosh Bible, pre-reg week, jun
ior transfer orientation, and annua,
student-faculty field days.
In 1942 the Society suspended its
work because ol the manpower

shortage brought about by the war.
The Society was dormant from then
until 1952 when it was reorganized.
With this reorganization came a
"new look." For the first time in
the history of the Society women
were eligible for membership!
A new charter was issued. The
Society became the official liaison
committee between the student body
and the Alumni Association.
The organization was composed of
the permanent chairman of the var
ious projects and an excom consist
ing of the president, four vice-pres
idents— sophomore, junior, senior,
and graduate —and the secretary
treasurer.
In 1953 a need for reorganisation

and re-evaluation was recognized.
A re-evaluation committee consist
ing of ack Fine, chairman, Sam
Freshman, Ann Evans, Ivan Strauss,
and Rudy Reich was appointed at
the last meeting of 1953, at which
time the president, Tom Hodges, re
signed .
This committee defined and con
densed the purposes of the Society
mo five main groups:
Alumni Relations alumni and
student- faculty relations, general
public relations and liaison, and
| work on alumni homecomings.
Pre - Stanford — hif-h school days
1 and all publicity and public rela
! tions connected with them.
Student Interest — activities pro
! moting student interest in the Uni
j versity such as Co-ordinating Coun
cil of Honorary and Professional
Fraternities, regional clubs, and
| publicity for Founders' Day.

Student Service — manpower co

The ereom, the committee de
j cidcd, should remain essentially
j (he same. The Axe Committee was
abolished and the membership of
the Society was enlarged so that
it-; members could provide the
manpower for their own projects.
New officers were elected. They
! are Kudy Reich, president; Ann
j Evans, senior vice - president; Eli
Reinhard, junior vice - president;
Sarah Freeman, sophomore vice
president; and Joyce Martin, secre
tary. The duties of the treasurer are
taken over by the sophomore vice
president.
The current projects of the So
ciety are campus hazards commit
tee, headed by Ann Evans; pre-
Stanford committee, handled by Pat
J O'Neill; the Co-ordinating Council
lor Professional and Honorary Fra
ternities, chairman, Jirn Sammet;
blood drive committee; and regional
| clubs committee.
The aim of the Axe Society is to
benefit the University in any way it
is capable of doing. The Society
hopes to achieve this through pro
moting and co-ordinating relation
ships between the alumni and stu
dent-faculty group and also between
students and the faculty.

The ereom, the committee de
j cidcd, should remain essentially
j (he same. The Axe Committee was
abolished and the membership of
the Society was enlarged so that
it-; members could provide the
manpower for their own projects.
New officers were elected. They
! are Kudy Reich, president; Ann
j Evans, senior vice - president; Eli
Reinhard, junior vice - president;
Sarah Freeman, sophomore vice
president; and Joyce Martin, secre
tary. The duties of the treasurer are
taken over by the sophomore vice
president.
The current projects of the So
ciety are campus hazards commit
tee, headed by Ann Evans; pre-
Stanford committee, handled by Pat
J O'Neill; the Co-ordinating Council
lor Professional and Honorary Fra
ternities, chairman, Jirn Sammet;
blood drive committee; and regional
| clubs committee.
The aim of the Axe Society is to
benefit the University in any way it
is capable of doing. The Society
hopes to achieve this through pro
moting and co-ordinating relation
ships between the alumni and stu
dent-faculty group and also between
students and the faculty.
To the members of one group
on campus the "Immortal 21"
who stole the Axe from Cal are
immortal for another reason.
These immortal Stanford roughs
were the founders of the Axe
Society.
Originally membership in the So
ciety was limited to men. The proj
ects were similar to those now car
ried on by Cardinals, for example,
the Frosh Bible, pre-reg week, jun
ior transfer orientation, and annua,
student-faculty field days.
In 1942 the Society suspended its
work because ol the manpower

shortage brought about by the war.
The Society was dormant from then
until 1952 when it was reorganized.
With this reorganization came a
"new look." For the first time in
the history of the Society women
were eligible for membership!
A new charter was issued. The
Society became the official liaison
committee between the student body
and the Alumni Association.
The organization was composed of
the permanent chairman of the var
ious projects and an excom consist
ing of the president, four vice-pres
idents— sophomore, junior, senior,
and graduate —and the secretary
treasurer.
In 1953 a need for reorganisation

and re-evaluation was recognized.
A re-evaluation committee consist
ing of ack Fine, chairman, Sam
Freshman, Ann Evans, Ivan Strauss,
and Rudy Reich was appointed at
the last meeting of 1953, at which
time the president, Tom Hodges, re
signed .
This committee defined and con
densed the purposes of the Society
mo five main groups:
Alumni Relations alumni and
student- faculty relations, general
public relations and liaison, and
| work on alumni homecomings.
Pre - Stanford — hif-h school days
1 and all publicity and public rela
! tions connected with them.
Student Interest — activities pro
! moting student interest in the Uni
j versity such as Co-ordinating Coun
cil of Honorary and Professional
Fraternities, regional clubs, and
| publicity for Founders' Day.
