# Tennis Team Opposes Two Southland Powers
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Stanford's tennis team, with Jack Frost holding down the first
singles slot, faces its toughest test of the year today when the
UCLA Bruins invade to kick off the PCC season.
Tomorrow Southern California's Trojans will oppose the netmen
of Coach Bob Renker with the television cameras of KGO-TV look-

ing on.
Both matches will be played on
the Stanford courts starting at 1 p.m.
Frost, ranked 21st nationally, ver
sus Bob Perry, ranked 12th nation
ally, will be the feature attraction
as the Cards square off against UC-
defending NCAA champions
this afternoon.
According to Renker, Frost has
been improving swiftly in the past
couple of weeks. Evidence was his
2-6, 9-7, 6-3 triumph over Jerry
Moss of Modesto JC, the Northern
California Intercollegiate champ,
last Friday.
But Perry is a Davis Cupper
and the top-ranked collegiate sin
gles player in the country. Last
summer he teamed with Larry
Huehner to bring the NCAA
doubles crown to the Westwood
campus.
Perry failed to reach the national
finals in singles last year (he was
eliminated in the semis by Ham
Richardson of LSU, the eventual
winner), but the Bruins' number
two man, Ron Livingston, did.
Livingston will run into Art Fish,
veteran Stanford senior, in the sec
ond singles encounter. Livingston is
unbeaten in 12 PCC matches in the
past two seasons. The Bruin basket
ball star reached the NCAA doubles
semi-finals with Jim Read last year.
Read, the Santa Monica flash,
and tall Dick Doss from San Diego
lead the rest of the powerful
Bruin aggregation.
The Indians will counter with
seniors Gary Gray and Jim Cornish
and sophs Henry Sutcliffe and Dave
Duff.
The Trojans will be paced tomor
row by Jacques Grigry, number 24
nationally; Allan Cleveland, who
was national junior singles and
doubles titlist; Alan Call; and Jim
Perley.
