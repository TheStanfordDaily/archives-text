# Indians Test Cal in Rugby
## 
### CURT HASS 
Stanford's team tangles
with the California Bears tomorrow
in the second meeting of the two
teams this season. The game will be
played at Memorial Stadium in
Berkeley, and begins at 3:45 p.m.
The Bears are slight favorites in
view of their 20-12 victory over the
Indians earlier this year. Stanford,
however, has been steadily improv
ing and enters the game fresh from
its three consecutive wins over UC
LA.
The Indians will be depending
heavily on the combination of their
backfiuld speed and ball handling
and the ability of the scrum to get
the ball to the backfield. With Dor
sey "The Toe" Atkinson, Juan Rey
nal, and Ron Cook leading the way
in the ball - carrying department,
and Bud Standerfer and Dick Mon
teith pushing their way around in
the scrum, teh Pete Kmetovic
coached Indians should give Califor
nia a tight battle.
Cal, however, presents a formi
dable foe with clever, Australian
born Max Howell and speedy A!
Talley romping around in the back
field, and big Matt Hazeltine leading
the way in the scrum.
The Indians will be shooting for
their 11th win in 12 starts, while
California will be trying for its
ninth win of the season against four
losses.
In a preliminary game at 2 p.m.,
the California junior varsity will
meet the Stanford Braves. The
Stanford JV's won the first contest
between the two, 14-8.
