provide plenty of competition. Play

Wednesday night in Encina Gym
Stanford Coach Edwin Baker em
ployed his first-stringers to clip the
Flyers in two out. of three tilts, 15-7,
9-15, and 15-8. Stanford's second
stringers couldn't cope with the vis
itors, however, losing both their tilts,
15-7 and 15-5.
The Indians' first team was
sparked by th<> powerful hitting of
Barry Brown, Marsh Freeman, Gene
Dils, and Pat Dougherty and the
deceptive setting of Ed Askey and
John Licata.
