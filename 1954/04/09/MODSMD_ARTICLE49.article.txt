# Nine Play USF, Navy
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
The Stanford baseball team, cur
rtntly roosting atop the CIBA totem
pole by a one game margin over the
second place ball clubs, USC and
California, will take a respite from
league play this week end.
But it will by no means be a rest
ful weekend for the Card nine. The
Deanmen face two strong opponents
on the Sunken Diamond. This after
noon at 3:30 they play USF, and to
morrow at 2:30 they host Alameda
Naval Air Station.
In a morning game tomorrow, the
Brave horsehiders will take on
Hamilton Air Force Base here.
In CIBA action this week end,
California plays three games with
Santa Clara, while USC takes on
UCLA in a trio.
Ray Young and Phil Page, both
of whom were brilliant in last week's
outings, will share the mound du
ties in today's forray against what
might be termed a bitter USF nine.
The Hilltoppers took a 26-5 drubb
ing at the hands of the Indians
earlier this season.
So, they will be more or less ven
geance-inclined. They have im
proved a great deal since that mas
sacre of three weeks ago. They have
split a pair with tough California,
and Tuesday they trounced San Jose
State 3-0.
Tomorrow morning's encounter
with the Hamilton Flyers will prob
ably see varsity flingers Ken Brown
and Ray Highsmith on the hill for
the Braves.
In the Saturday afternoon affair,
Mike Acker and Don DeLong will
pitch for Stanford. The Alameda
Sailors have in past seasons always
fielded a tough team, but little is
known about them this year.
Everett Dean was pleased with
last weekend's action, saying
"While we would have liked to win
two against USC, we nevertheless
think the boys had a good weekend
in well-played games.
