# Fijis Protest 36-34 Loss to Encina 3E
## 
### 
In a game played under protest,
Encina 3E defeated the Fijis 36-34
last night in the quarter-finals of
the intramural tournament in the
Pavilion.
Zete I took Kappa Sig, 3#-29, in
the other game.
The first half ended with the
3-Easters leading the Fijis 14-9. It
was during the first half that the
protest was filed by the Fijis, when
a tipped ball hit the referee. The
ball was grabbed by a Fiji player
who dribbled the rest of the way
to the basket to score. The referee
called the ball back, however, and
made the two boys jump again.
In the final half the Fijis got their
fast break into gear but it was not
enough and the Encina boys,
through superior rebounding, swept
to victory.
The Zete I cagers came one step
nearer to their second straight bas
ketball championship by downing
an inspired Kappa Sig quintet in the
final quarter.
The win gives the Zetes their sev
enth triumph of the season without
a defeat and puts them in the semi
final bracket of the elimination
tournament.
