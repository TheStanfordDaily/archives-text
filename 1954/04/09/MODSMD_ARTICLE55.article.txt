afternoon in the Los Angeles Coliseum. SC's track team will con
duct the ceremonies in what may possibly mark the largest pun
shment ever handed Stanford by Troy.
Coaches Jack Weiershauser and Ray Dean are taking 26 Indians

The squad will camp in the Chap
nan Park Hotel and return at 11
j'clock Sunday morning. Field
events are scheduled for 2 o'clock
md track events, 2:30.
Gerry Wood in the high hurdles
jnd Leo Long in the javelin should
Lake Troy's best and Ai Cheney has
<£00d possibilities to ring up five for
Stanford in the shot. That leaves 12
events for SC to take and if it does
n't it'll be a surprise to everybody.
Stanford should grab enough place
and show money to earn some 30
points, and as Assistant Coach Dean
says, "Forty points will be a moral
victory."
Stanford's other barrier ace, Jim
Luttrell, would be favored in the
lows had not Trojan Coach Mor
tensen decided to run national 440
champ Jim Lea in the race also,
whom Mortensen is prepping for the
NCAA low barrier title. Lea will
also win the 440, in which he
streaked to the NCAA victory in 47
flat.
In llie high jump, the Indians'
John Stewart, who won against
Michigan with a (»-ft. 6-in. leap
last week, will have to set a per
sonal record (o heat SC's Ernie
Shelton. Shelton, who is deter
mined to become history's first
seven-foot man this spring, soared
(i ft. 10',h in. at Turku, Finland,
last year. And Stewart, according
to Weiershauser, is Stanford's
"only established performer."
The sprint picture is loaded—with
Trojans. Howard Bugbee (9.7, 21.0),
Joe GraHio (9.7, 21.3), and Lea are
slated to control the century, fur
long, and quarter against the efforts
of Stanford's Keith Brownsberger,
Walt Garrett, Fred George, and Jim
Saras.
If Brownsberger, Garrett, and
George 'were to suddenly hit their
15;53 form, there could be plenty of
trouble for SC, but the trio has yet
o match la t year's peak.
Handy man of the Trojan team is
nu cular Des Koch, more known
to football fans as a rumbling back,
but now flipping the shot, discus,
nd javelin with awesome distances.
! he versatile ironman excels in the
platter event and spun out 109 ft.
11 :t /i in. against Arizona, which lost
by !j0 points to the Trojans.

Some Stanford pole vaulter is go
ing to have to break the Cards' sea
son best of 12 ft. to even place in
tliis event, but in the broad jump
.'ndian Ed Fremouw is capable oi
scoring.
Troy's star half-milor Bill Tayloi
and distance men Fernando Ledes
ma, who ran a 4:20 mile against Oc
cidental last week with the flu, and
Marty Montgomery, who was
clocked in 4:1G.2 last week, will add
more misery. The mile relay will po
to SC by anywhere from five to
even seconds.
SC, defending PCC and NCAA

champ since track fans can remem
ber without digging into the books,
administered the Tribe's worst beat
ing in 194(5, 108-23. It's unbelievable
according to the recent past, but the
Cardinal and White has conquered
the Cardinal and Gold 26 times in
track while bowing 22, the last 18
times all consecutively, however.
But the Tribe even holds the longest
win streak, 22 straight from 1908
through 1925.
SC reports to be stronger in the
dual meets this season but weaker
in the sectional and national meet,
due to the departure of the Big
Three—Jack Davis, Perry O'Brien,
and Sim Iness, who together scored
48 points in the NCAA meet last
June in Lincoln, Neb.
Card sprinter Jim Truher is sit
ting out with an ailment and will
not make the trip.
