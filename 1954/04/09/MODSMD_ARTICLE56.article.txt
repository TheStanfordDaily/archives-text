# Crew Up Early To Hit Cold Sea
## 
### LEE HANSEN 
Thirty men pay $2 per quar
ter for the privilege of getting
up at 5 o'clock every morning
to wear themselves oat by row
ing several cold, foggy miles
before breakfast.
These same men chip in their own
money to pay for expenses to and
from their races which are as far
away as Seattle and Los Angeles.
Madmen? This is the Stanford
crew. The thirty'men are divided
into frosh, junior varsity, and var
sity shells. Elected by the crew,
their unpaid coaches are Frank
Jameson, a Phi Delt, for the frosh,
and Harry Buchalter, lab technician
at the microwave laboratory, for the
varsity.
The Stanford Crew Association is

j run by a steering committee elected
| every spring. Currently it is cap
tained by Bill Findley and George
Toepfer. Treasurer is AI Dai ley, and
j secretary - publicity chairman is
Mark Dees.
Co-cap Lain Toepfer is in charge
■ of the women's division of the crew,
the Crew Auxiliary. Twenty-five
loyal crew fans meet every Tuesday
I aiternoon to type out and send let
j ters to alumni, friends, and ex-crew
men who in return send back money
| to support the crew.
Although Stanford's crew is still
I an "orphan" crew dependent on
i handouts, they are backed by tradi
tion. After crew was abolished in the
early '20's, nothing was seen of the
Indian oarsmen until 1940.
In 15)40 Lee Peake and Ted Cole
; started a campaign to bring back the
long-lost sport. Enlisting the help of
some thirty potential tfrewmen, they
formed the Stanford Boat Club, and
built themselves a boathouse. Cal
came to their rescue with the offer
of an old shell, and four ex-Cal
oarsmen became their first coaches.
The enthusiasm of the Stanford
crew prompted such clippings a.s
this one by Bill Leiser of the San
Francisco Chronicle:
"They may not be able to row an
even race what with paying their
own way to Redwood to practice

! four times a week and just getting I
| along in every way the best they are I
| able. But when kids like a sport j
! well enough to stay with it a.s these
j boys have, with no possible sign of
recognition of help to come, now or
never, they have rowing in their
I hearts."
After a struggle to obtain gym
credit and another shell donated by
the University of Washington, the
Stanford crew went ahead to an
| other first in 1942. Ann Ashley, a
pretty 108-pound freshman became
coxswain for the frosh crew and
| took her turi) being tossed into the
| water along with the heartier cox
| swains.
A low point came in 1943 when on
i the eve of their big race the crew
i was forced to withdraw because, to !
quote The Stanford Daily, "one of
the crew members lost his balance

and stuck his foot through the hot-'
torn of the varsity shell." This mis- j
hap, combined with others, caused!
the sport to be discontinued until the
all of 1940.
Here cixvv took a turn unward and
was c lected a member of the Na
tional Association of Amateur Oars
men. In IL'43 another shot in the'
arm was given wits, the gift of two
brand new si. •i 1 s by an anonymous !
'onor. And i:i 1950 the Stanford
'.ri.'w achieved the unheard of vic
tory of third in the national regatta, j
next to Washington and California, j
This year plans are going ahead
for the samv kind of victory. The j
first step has already been taken j
with the 1954 Stanford crew, varsity |
and freshman, wins over SC last!
Saturday.
The future? A dream hoped to be
realized in the next year or so is
a new boathouse, a/id the crew is
budgeting their funds for that. An
other dream is to equal the 1950
crew's record in the nationals—or
better it.
