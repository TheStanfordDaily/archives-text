# Lathrop House: Splendor Lingers Among the Ruins
## 
### PAT KING 
"Alta Vista." Fifty years ago
peacocks preened and strutted
across the lawns of the white
mansion overlooking Stanford.
Roses tumbled over back
fences, and on the rolling foot
hills behind the house grazed
some of the finest thoroughbred
horses in the country.
'"Alta Vista." At night the house
swayed to the music of a string or
chestra in the downstairs ballroom
as Peninsula society danced beneath
elaborate gas - burning chandeliers.
In spring and summer the waltzing
couples spilled out onto the terraces
and filled the outdoor dance floor.
"Alta Vista." This was the home
built in 1890 for Charles Lathrop,
the brother of Mrs. Stanford, the
home which for over 50 years has
symbolized gracious living and warm
hospitality.
A tour through the 2;"i - room
mansion today is marred by fall
ing plaster and loose hoards, for
the Ford Foundation is razing
"Alta Vista" to make room for a
low, modern building to stud\ the
behavioral sciences. Yet even as
it is being dismantled board by
board, much of the old beauty re
mains.
The wreckers haven't ripped apart
the burnished redwood panels lining
the walls ot tiiree large parlors on
the first floor. And the rose ba 11 -

room, empty and dusty, stands un
touched.
Throughout the house small traces
of the former elegance remain: The
beautiful hardwood parquet floors,
set by hand without using a single
nail. The marble inlay around the
fireplaces. A padded coat - hanger
deserted in an upstairs closet. Gold
designs trimming white arches along
the ceilings, and the satiny white
wallpaper which covers one sitting
room.
A chandelier rimmed with strings
of green and gold beads. A scrap of
red velvet. An old Waterman's ink
bottle. Black fire hoses which once
were wound around a wheel near
the kitchen.
In one room a yellowed San
Francisco Fxamincr from 1911
curled dejectedly in a corner. A
quick glance at the headlines
liocked one back to the present—
for there in large type was the
name "McCarthy." Only this lYlc-
Carthy was a San Francisco su
pervisor.
Outside a wrought-iron lamp still
hangs in welcome by the front en
trance. Weeds have overrun the
garden and the Cupid standing in
one pond is crumbling, but the soft
green of the countryside is as fresh
as it was in 1900.
The view, too, is unobstructed.
From the top floor of the house one
can see from San Francisco to San
Jose.

Within a few weeks the mansion
will be gone and the grounds will
be cleared. A new building will
perch on the hill.
But the Lathrop estate will always
remain a warm memory for those
who knew the charm and beauty of
"Alta Vista."


AS IT WAS — "Alta Vista," the
stately white mansion of the La
throp family, is shown as it looked
for over 50 years. Located on a
grassy knoll overlooking Lake I>a
gunita, "Alta Vista" was the scene
of lavish parties presided over by
Mrs. Leland Stanford and Mrs.
Lathrop.


ABOUT TO FALL—Workmen are rapidly ripping apart the
imposing former home of the Lathrops, which will be replaced
by a low, modern building constructed for the Ford Foundation.


ALL ALONE—Crumbling hut still
standing, Cupid rises above the
moss - covered water of a pond
outside the Lathrop mansion. I!c
is one of the few traces of the "old
order" still remaining in the once
famed gardens surrounding the
house.


LHUITS OUT—Carol (icvurt/, a
junior living at Lath top House on
the Row, is surrounded l>y elabo
rate chandeliers whirl) once illu
minated the spacious hilltop home
of the Lathrops. These lamps all
burned gas.


IT WILL BURN NO MORE—The marble fireplace in the famous Lathrop ballroom is studied by
Carol Gevurtz. The fireplace is located at one end of the large rose-colored room where once
string orchestras played for the dancing enjoyment of Peninsula society. The hardwood floor
was laid by hand without using nails. This room is still in excellent condition.

Within a few weeks the mansion
will be gone and the grounds will
be cleared. A new building will
perch on the hill.
But the Lathrop estate will always
remain a warm memory for those
who knew the charm and beauty of
"Alta Vista."


AS IT WAS — "Alta Vista," the
stately white mansion of the La
throp family, is shown as it looked
for over 50 years. Located on a
grassy knoll overlooking Lake I>a
gunita, "Alta Vista" was the scene
of lavish parties presided over by
Mrs. Leland Stanford and Mrs.
Lathrop.


ABOUT TO FALL—Workmen are rapidly ripping apart the
imposing former home of the Lathrops, which will be replaced
by a low, modern building constructed for the Ford Foundation.


ALL ALONE—Crumbling hut still
standing, Cupid rises above the
moss - covered water of a pond
outside the Lathrop mansion. I!c
is one of the few traces of the "old
order" still remaining in the once
famed gardens surrounding the
house.


LHUITS OUT—Carol (icvurt/, a
junior living at Lath top House on
the Row, is surrounded l>y elabo
rate chandeliers whirl) once illu
minated the spacious hilltop home
of the Lathrops. These lamps all
burned gas.


IT WILL BURN NO MORE—The marble fireplace in the famous Lathrop ballroom is studied by
Carol Gevurtz. The fireplace is located at one end of the large rose-colored room where once
string orchestras played for the dancing enjoyment of Peninsula society. The hardwood floor
was laid by hand without using nails. This room is still in excellent condition.
"Alta Vista." Fifty years ago
peacocks preened and strutted
across the lawns of the white
mansion overlooking Stanford.
Roses tumbled over back
fences, and on the rolling foot
hills behind the house grazed
some of the finest thoroughbred
horses in the country.
'"Alta Vista." At night the house
swayed to the music of a string or
chestra in the downstairs ballroom
as Peninsula society danced beneath
elaborate gas - burning chandeliers.
In spring and summer the waltzing
couples spilled out onto the terraces
and filled the outdoor dance floor.
"Alta Vista." This was the home
built in 1890 for Charles Lathrop,
the brother of Mrs. Stanford, the
home which for over 50 years has
symbolized gracious living and warm
hospitality.
A tour through the 2;"i - room
mansion today is marred by fall
ing plaster and loose hoards, for
the Ford Foundation is razing
"Alta Vista" to make room for a
low, modern building to stud\ the
behavioral sciences. Yet even as
it is being dismantled board by
board, much of the old beauty re
mains.
The wreckers haven't ripped apart
the burnished redwood panels lining
the walls ot tiiree large parlors on
the first floor. And the rose ba 11 -

room, empty and dusty, stands un
touched.
Throughout the house small traces
of the former elegance remain: The
beautiful hardwood parquet floors,
set by hand without using a single
nail. The marble inlay around the
fireplaces. A padded coat - hanger
deserted in an upstairs closet. Gold
designs trimming white arches along
the ceilings, and the satiny white
wallpaper which covers one sitting
room.
A chandelier rimmed with strings
of green and gold beads. A scrap of
red velvet. An old Waterman's ink
bottle. Black fire hoses which once
were wound around a wheel near
the kitchen.
In one room a yellowed San
Francisco Fxamincr from 1911
curled dejectedly in a corner. A
quick glance at the headlines
liocked one back to the present—
for there in large type was the
name "McCarthy." Only this lYlc-
