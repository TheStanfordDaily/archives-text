# Felix Bloch Named to Head Nuclear Research Center
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Stanford's Nobel Prize winning professor, \)r. I'nlix Block was
notified Friday that he was named director o! a proposed 12-man
center for nuclear research in Geneva, Switzerland.

But last night Bioch was still <
European Council for Nuclear R
When contacted by .The Dail
physicist, declined to state definitely
that ho would accept the interna
tional post, but he indicated he
would take the job upon receiving
an official offer.
"If I go to Geneva, it will be for
two years at the most," Bloeh said.
"The University would give me a
leave of absence for that period.
"I have received no formal ofTer,"
he continued, "but I am expecting
one."
The unofficial announcement came
as no surprise to the professor be
cause he has just returned from a
March trip to Europe where tic dis
cussed tentative plans for the cen
ter with members of the ECNR.
"I want to stress that this will be
purely non-military research," Bloeh
said.
Only three of the \2 nations—Brit
ain, Switzerland, and Denmark—
have ratified the proposal for the
12-nation center, but the other rati
fications are expected this summer.
Ten ratifications are needed to put
the project into operation.
According to present plans work
is expected to begin in Geneva in
()ct.ober.
Bloeh said, "J may want to fake
some assistants with rne from Stan
ford, bul I cannot determine that at
this time."
Bloeh is one of the nation's lead
ins nuclear physicists, sharing Nobrl
recognition in 1952 with Harvard's
E. ML Purcell for developing meth
ods of measuring the magnetic prop
erties of atomic particles.
The findings have been utilized in
Ihe design and operation of modern
atom smashing devices. Bloeh has
worked on the atom bomb both at
Stanford and Los Alamos, N M.
As a displaced scientist fleeing
from Nazism, he came to Stanford
as an acting associate professor in
1934.
The other countries backing the
nuclear center are Belgium, France,
West Germany, Greece, Italy, the
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and
Yugoslavia.
