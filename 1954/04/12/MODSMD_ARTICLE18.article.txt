# EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE PROGRAM
## Fund Slash Would Hurt Stanford Foreign Scholars 
### JIM PALMER 
A slash of $6,000,000 in lunds for the educational exchange pro
gram, now being considered by the Senate Appropriations Com
mittee, would terminate full grants for 15 Stanford foreign slu
dents under the Sclimidt-Mundt plan, according to Werner Warm
brunn, Stanford foreign students advisor.
The economy cut, already passed by the House of Representa
lives, would eliminate educational * "

exchanges under the Fulbright pro
gram in 4(5 countries and do away
with grants of American dollars
under the Sehmidt-Mundt plan.
"If the cut is approved, the num
ber of exchange students would be
drastically reduced," said Warm
brunn, "and 40 or 50 students now at
Stanford under the Fulbright pro
gram would be affected to some ex
tent."
The 15 foreign students at Stan
ford who will be directly influenced
by the cut are mostly graduate stu
dents, said Warmbrunn.
Fulbright program exchanges
with only 21 countries would be al
lowed due to the slash of the pro
posed budget from $15,000,000 to
$9,000,000. These exchanges would
continue to be financed by foreign
currency in the form of credits to
the United States Treasury accumu
lated from American sales of surplus
property abroad.
ASSU foreign scholars would not
be directly affected, said Warm
brunn, because their scholarships
come from the University and not
from the Federal government.
Warmbrunn has received a letter
from Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon promising that he would do
everything he could to restore the

funds slashed from tire appropria
tion. Warmbrunn has asked people
to write letters to Sen. William F.
Knowland requesting restoration of
the financing.
