Attorney General Herbert
Brownell gave a nationwide radio-
TV address Friday night in which
he called for stiffer laws to aid the
"fight against Communism."
His proposals included legislation
to weed potential spies or saboteurs
out of defense plants, to "eliminate
Communist control of any industrial
organization or labor union in vital
sections of the economy," and to
provide the death penalty for peace
time espionage.
Brownell, who didn't mention Mc-
Carthy or Congressional investigat
ing committees in his talk, declared:
"The FBI, the Department of Jus
tice, and the courts are your agents
in dealing with this Communist
conspiracy. All are vigilant in their
readiness to meet, any move or
emergency which the Communist
party in America might precipitate."
* ♦ w
The Senate Investigations sub
committee postponed the opening of
the McCarthy-Army hearings from
April 21 to April 22 to allow the
Senator to keep a scheduled speak
ing date in Texas.

Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles left on a peace-through
strength mission Saturday night to
force an Allied "united front"
against the Red threat in Southeast
Asia. He conferred With President
Eisenhower just before he left on
his mission to London and Paris.
Dulles said the pUrpose of his trip
is to develop a pool of strength with
Britain and France in advance of
the April Geneva conference on Ko
rea and Indochina.
French and British press reports
and unofficial views of those gov
ernments indicate neither is enthu
siastic about, such a plan.
