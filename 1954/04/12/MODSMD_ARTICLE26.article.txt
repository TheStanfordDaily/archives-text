On Wednesday night the Executive Com
mittee gave a go-ahead to a new committee- a
committee that hopes to make sense out of the
student government setup at Stanford.
The need for a comprehensive study of Stan
ord's student government structure has grown
increasingly evident this year. We believe
th.it the new Student Government Committee
is ideally suited to undertake such a study.
Members of the seven-man committee in
lude graduate students specializing in public
administration - nd former student government
officers thoroughly acquainted with Stanford's
special problems.
The committee is determined to avoid one of
Stanford student government's worst pitfalls
government by postponement, and its mem
bers have promised to try to complete their
study within five weeks, in time for considera
tion by the present Excorn.
The committee chairman reports thai his
group will concentrate on the need for a stu

dent government structure that not only makes
theoretical sense but is adapted to the practical
needs of this campus.
Next week the committee will appoint a staff
to help with its work. It will soon begin asking
students to report on their experience with
Stanford student government under the exist
ing setup.
Work with the committee will give students
a fascinating insight into the essence of stu
dent government. And any possible recom
mendations which might help solve the many
frustrations which now confront students inter
ested in Stanford student government would
be of inestimable value.
This committee is working to make Stan
ford's student government the successful or
ganization we believe Stanford's student body
can establish. In such a project, the new Stu
dent Government Committee deserves the full
est possible degree of cooperation from every
Stanford student.
