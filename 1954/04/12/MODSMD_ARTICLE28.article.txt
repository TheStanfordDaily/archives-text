## Risk and Reality 
### 
To the Editor:
The great risk involved in bringing a Yugoslav to
Stanford is not so much that he will not return to
Yugoslavia with an objective report, or even that he
might not return at all, as ydur editorial suggested.
The risk is rather that when he does return he will
not be able to report his experiences here freely and
objetively even if he wants to. I agree with you that
there is a need that Yugoslavia understand the United
States and its people; and I share Miss Sondag's
idealism in hoping for cooperation and understanding
between the United States and the nations of the
Communist bloc. But let's not let our idealism di
vorce us from reality. Yugoslavia is a Communist
dictatorship. This is the country, remember, which
martyred Cardinal Stepinac; this is the country which
only weeks ago deposed one of its vice-presidents be
cause he had deviated from the party line. People
iri Yugoslavia are not tree to say what they â€¢ think
and believe. Therefore, the risk is very great that
when Macanovic returns to Yugoslavia he will not be
able to do what many ol us who have supported the
foreign scholarship program hope for and expect. The
risk is too great to justify the expenditure ot $3,000
to bring Macanovic to Stanford. There are other
countries in which the need for understanding is

even greater, and in which our money could better
invested.
I agree with you that there might be some value to
us in bringing a Communist student from Yugoslavia
to Stanford, if that student is qualified in other re
spects. But the fact that Macanovic is a Communist
and that his presence here will stimulate some Stan
ford students to think should not have been the over
riding consideration in making the award. In our
enthusiasm to bring a Communist to Stanford, let's
not disregard a basic purpose of our foreign scholar
ship program. I worked on the Foreign Scholarship
Committee in 1950-51 under the able direction of
Phil NieLson. He constantly emphasized to us the
double purpose of the foreign scholarship program
and the importance of realizing both purposes in
order to enlist and maintain the solid support of the
student body behind the program. 1 suggest that in
disregarding the second purpose of the program we
are undermining the student support which is es
sential to the program's continued existence. It is
for this reason that 1 have questioned the wisdom
of the Foreign Scholarship Committee in selecting
a student from Yugoslavia to come to Stanford next
year.
