# WITHOUT GIRLS, MURDER, OR LOVE
## 'Conquest of Everest'—A Dramatic Story of a Long Walk Up a Mountain 
### PETE GROTHE 
The"( Conquest of Everest," which will soon be play
ing locally, is the story of a walk up a mountain.
'Hie "Conquest of Everest" is just about the most
dramatic celluloid (o be run through the spools of a
despite the fact that it has no leggy chorus*
'givls, triple-axe murder, or intriguing love'triangle.
And despite the fact that the

movie-goer knows how the pic
ture is going to end before he
steps into the theater.
This flick is just the .story of a
walk up a mountain. But that
mountain happens to be Mt. Ev
erest, which gropes heroically
29,002 feet into the stratosphere,
and by the time the picture ends,
Everest has taken on almost hu
man proportions.

"The Conquest of Eveiest" is spectacular fare be
cause *.1 captures dramatically and with the under
statement, at which the British are so masterful, one
of the most intriguing dramas known . . . that of man
vs. mountain.
Why is mountain, iVi this case the tallest one in the
world, such a fantastic challenge to man? You can't
explain it. You can't put it into words adequately.
You can only feel it And in this Countryman Films
production, you can feel it; you can feel how man's
ambition to scale a mountain is somewhat akin to
a religion. You can feel how man willingly would
give his life to reach the summit.
The production was filmed brilliantly by George
W. Lowe and Thomas Stobart. Conditions made good
photography about as easy as a sociology student
trying to get an "A" in a math class. Lowe, who did
most of the photography, carried 30 pounds of photo
graphic equipment with him up to 27,9(X( feet. The
one weakness of the picture is that the final assault
wasn't filmed, although it would have been physically

impossible to carry that much camera poundage to
the summit.
However, Lowe makes up for this by his exquisite
filming of the enchanting Nepal countryside and the
faces of the people; of the bottomless blue-green slits
in the ice glaciers; and of avalanches in which blocks
of ice bigger than Mem And go bouncing down the
terrain like a spilled bag of marbles.
The music score by British composer Arthur Ben
jamin gives fullness to the picture and the simple
narrative by poet Louis MacNoice is unpretentious,
yet. strong.
The picture begins by ♦showing some of the previous
assaults, of which there were five unsuccessful ones.
Then it goes to England, where it shows the elaborate
technical and hum m preparation that is undertaken.
One-third into the picture, you see the pilgrimmage
to the base camp at 18,000 feet, which is several
thousand feet above America's tallest peak. From the
base camp on the western cwm (Welsh word pro
nounced "room"), it takes -10 days to reach the sum
mit.
The audience sees the dangerous trip over the jag
ged ice fields in which the ice is always moving and
crumbling. The entourage, which keeps getting
smaller, goes irom one camp to another, until finally,
it reaches camp eight, right below the summit.
The viewers pull wilh each step of the climbers as
the goal nears completion. Slashing hundred-mile
an hour winds and a devastating lack of oxygen
make each step a Herculean effort. The gasps of the
climbers sound like each breath is the dying one.
112 inally, the summit, which in symbol is both devil
and angel, is reached by second assault team of Hil
lary, a deep-furrowed, bronzed New Zealander, and
the great Nepal eze Alpinist, Tensing Norkey.
A leeling of exhilaration races through the audi
ence when Sir John Hunt, the leader of the expedi
tion embraces Hillary upon discovery that the tri
umph was theirs. Man has conquered mountain. A
goal felt to be spiritual has been attained.

world, such a fantastic challenge to man? You can't
explain it. You can't put it into words adequately.
You can only feel it And in this Countryman Films
production, you can feel it; you can feel how man's
ambition to scale a mountain is somewhat akin to
a religion. You can feel how man willingly would
give his life to reach the summit.
The production was filmed brilliantly by George
W. Lowe and Thomas Stobart. Conditions made good
photography about as easy as a sociology student
trying to get an "A" in a math class. Lowe, who did
most of the photography, carried 30 pounds of photo
graphic equipment with him up to 27,9(X( feet. The
one weakness of the picture is that the final assault
wasn't filmed, although it would have been physically

impossible to carry that much camera poundage to
the summit.
However, Lowe makes up for this by his exquisite
filming of the enchanting Nepal countryside and the
faces of the people; of the bottomless blue-green slits
in the ice glaciers; and of avalanches in which blocks
of ice bigger than Mem And go bouncing down the
terrain like a spilled bag of marbles.
The music score by British composer Arthur Ben
jamin gives fullness to the picture and the simple
narrative by poet Louis MacNoice is unpretentious,
yet. strong.
The picture begins by ♦showing some of the previous
assaults, of which there were five unsuccessful ones.
Then it goes to England, where it shows the elaborate
technical and hum m preparation that is undertaken.
One-third into the picture, you see the pilgrimmage
to the base camp at 18,000 feet, which is several
thousand feet above America's tallest peak. From the
base camp on the western cwm (Welsh word pro
nounced "room"), it takes -10 days to reach the sum
mit.
The audience sees the dangerous trip over the jag
ged ice fields in which the ice is always moving and
crumbling. The entourage, which keeps getting
smaller, goes irom one camp to another, until finally,
it reaches camp eight, right below the summit.
The viewers pull wilh each step of the climbers as
the goal nears completion. Slashing hundred-mile
an hour winds and a devastating lack of oxygen
make each step a Herculean effort. The gasps of the
climbers sound like each breath is the dying one.
112 inally, the summit, which in symbol is both devil
and angel, is reached by second assault team of Hil
lary, a deep-furrowed, bronzed New Zealander, and
the great Nepal eze Alpinist, Tensing Norkey.
A leeling of exhilaration races through the audi
ence when Sir John Hunt, the leader of the expedi
tion embraces Hillary upon discovery that the tri
umph was theirs. Man has conquered mountain. A
goal felt to be spiritual has been attained.
