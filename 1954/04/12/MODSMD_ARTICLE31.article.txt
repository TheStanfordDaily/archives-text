## 
### BOB REZAK 
Stanford University has always been pioud of its graduates. Its
long roster of distinguished alumni includes a former United
States President (Herbert Hoover), U.S. Senators, Congressmen,
ambassadors, and other top state officials.
In the University's 69-year history, however, only one alumnus

has become Governor of California. |
That man arrives on the campus to
day for an address before the Stan- |
ford Political Union and for a Uni- '
versity welcome.
He is Goodwin Jess Knight, a
member of of 1919, and the
31st Governor of the Golden State. !
Only one other Stanford man has
ever been Governor of California
Leland Stanford, Sr., who in I8t»l
was the state's eighth Governor.
There is a fair amount of infor
mation filed away in the Univer
sity's collection of Stanfordianu to
indicate that "Goodie" Knight was
a student leader oi exceptional cal
iber' —an athlete, a public speaker,
an actor, and a writer.
With almost the same vigor and
spirit that he is currently display
ing in his campaign for Governor,
Knight took an active intetest in a
variety of campus activities.
During his undergraduate years
he managed the Stanford Quad, was
a member of the Hammer and Cof
fin Society, Sword and Sandals, Phi
Alpha Delta legal fraternity, Sigma
Delta Chi journalism fraternity, and
Delta Sigma Kho debating society.
Of all his activities, however,
Knight was perhaps best recognized
for his participation in public speak
ing and debating, having won the
Stanford gold medal for public
speaking.
The 1920 Quad praisingly sum
marized Knight's participatiin in the
Medaille Joffre Debate, the intro
ductory sjjeech of which was given
by William Leiser, '21, now sports
editor of the San Francisco Chron
icle.
Said the Quad:
"Goodwin J. Knight, '19, fol
lowed with what was considered
the most spirited presentation of
the evening." Ilis topic: "Re
solved, that Morocco should be
internationalized with France as
a mandatory for its affairs."
Knight also took a crack at writ
ing for campus publications, in
cluding Chaparral. Several of his
articles on politics appeared in the
Stanford Illustrated Review (now
called the Stanford Review).
A.s an athlete, the former Stan
fordite played football for two years
on the second team and was a mem
ber of the frosh track team.
In the field of fine arts, Knight
participated in dramatics and opera.
The 56-year-old, gray-haired Re
publican's college career was inter

rupted by n yynr spent on a Navy j
subchaser during World War I.
He returned to the University and j
received an A.B. degree in 1919
along with the Telluride Scholar- j
ship to Cornell for a year of grad- !
uate work.
He was admitted to the California |
Bar in 1921.
He practiced law until 1935 and i
then became a superior judge in Los I

Knight also took a crack at writ
ing for campus publications, in
cluding Chaparral. Several of his
articles on politics appeared in the
Stanford Illustrated Review (now
called the Stanford Review).
A.s an athlete, the former Stan

In the field of fine arts, Knight
participated in dramatics and opera.

rupted by n yynr spent on a Navy j

Stanford University has always been pioud of its graduates. Its
long roster of distinguished alumni includes a former United
States President (Herbert Hoover), U.S. Senators, Congressmen,
ambassadors, and other top state officials.
In the University's 69-year history, however, only one alumnus

has become Governor of California. |
That man arrives on the campus to
day for an address before the Stan- |
ford Political Union and for a Uni- '
versity welcome.
He is Goodwin Jess Knight, a
member of of 1919, and the
31st Governor of the Golden State. !
Only one other Stanford man has
ever been Governor of California
Leland Stanford, Sr., who in I8t»l
was the state's eighth Governor.
There is a fair amount of infor
mation filed away in the Univer
sity's collection of Stanfordianu to
indicate that "Goodie" Knight was
a student leader oi exceptional cal
iber' —an athlete, a public speaker,
an actor, and a writer.
With almost the same vigor and
spirit that he is currently display
ing in his campaign for Governor,
Knight took an active intetest in a
variety of campus activities.
During his undergraduate years
he managed the Stanford Quad, was
a member of the Hammer and Cof
fin Society, Sword and Sandals, Phi
Alpha Delta legal fraternity, Sigma
Delta Chi journalism fraternity, and
Delta Sigma Kho debating society.
Of all his activities, however,
Knight was perhaps best recognized
for his participation in public speak
ing and debating, having won the
Stanford gold medal for public
speaking.
The 1920 Quad praisingly sum
marized Knight's participatiin in the
Medaille Joffre Debate, the intro
ductory sjjeech of which was given
by William Leiser, '21, now sports
editor of the San Francisco Chron
icle.
Said the Quad:
"Goodwin J. Knight, '19, fol
lowed with what was considered
the most spirited presentation of
the evening." Ilis topic: "Re
solved, that Morocco should be
internationalized with France as
a mandatory for its affairs."
