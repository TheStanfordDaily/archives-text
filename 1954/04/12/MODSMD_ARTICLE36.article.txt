# Cards Impress With Five Wins
## SC Takes Meet With Ease. 88-43 
### RAY LOYND 
Twenty - six Indians arrived
home yesterday with a moral
victory.
Saturday they burned their
press clippings, stormed intc
SC's village, and raised all kind?
of dust in winning more than
they were supposed to - includ
ing a super-surprise triumph in
the mile relay.
Stanford lost the actual battle, 88-
4.'!, but Troy': NCAA champs were
knocked oft in live events and never
threatened the century mark many
thought they would shatter.
Cards Gerry Wood and Leo Long
achieved expectel wins in the high
hurdles and javelin, but when Stan
lord's Al Cheney started the Coli
seum meet off with an upset victory
in the shot, when Jim Luttrell later
hopped home first in the lows, and
when a Trojan quartet was beaten
by over two seconds in the mile re
lay by a previously unspectacular
Tribe foursome, the score began
reaching stratospheric heights for
Stanford, which was tabbed for no
more than 40 points by even its
most liberal followers,
But SC had its moments, too.
Coach Jess Mortensen's Trojans
broke a meet record and produced
the season's top collegiate marks in
the 440 and discus as Troy's NCAA
quarter champ Jim Lea shot out of
the Coliseum tunnel, ripped around
one turn, and cut the tape in 47.8,
and Des Koch flipped the discus
170-9%, the best of his life.
SC's jumping fool, Ernie Shelton,
on his initial attempt crossed his
legs over the bar at (5-9 7/1(5 to
topple the former dual meet mark
of (i-8 set by SC's Johnny Wilson
in 1940.
After Lea had won the 440, he
was withdrawn from the last race,
the mile relay, setting up Stanford
for an outside chance in an event
in which SC had run 3:1(5.
Stanford had lost unimpressive
relay performances against Fresno
State and Michigan, but suddenly
the Indians pulled within grasp as
Lea, SC co-captain who did a 4(5.7
relay lap in the Oxy race, was re
placed and Stanford's Fred George,
holder of a 4(5.9 relay lap last year
and who earlier placed third in the
quarter at 48.8. ran for the first
time this season.
Coach Jack Weiershauser sent i
Dill Hupp, Walt Garrett, and Wood J
ahead of George, who brought the i
baton home in 3:17.8.
Wood won the high sticks by two |
yards in 14.8, and Luttrell snatched]
the low barriers in 23.5. his all
time high and one of the nation's
best marks. He also placed third in
the highs.

Twenty - six Indians arrived
home yesterday with a moral
victory.
Saturday they burned their
press clippings, stormed intc
SC's village, and raised all kind?
of dust in winning more than
they were supposed to - includ
ing a super-surprise triumph in
the mile relay.
Stanford lost the actual battle, 88-
4.'!, but Troy': NCAA champs were
knocked oft in live events and never
threatened the century mark many
thought they would shatter.
Cards Gerry Wood and Leo Long
achieved expectel wins in the high
hurdles and javelin, but when Stan
lord's Al Cheney started the Coli
seum meet off with an upset victory
in the shot, when Jim Luttrell later
hopped home first in the lows, and
when a Trojan quartet was beaten
by over two seconds in the mile re
lay by a previously unspectacular
Tribe foursome, the score began
reaching stratospheric heights for
Stanford, which was tabbed for no
more than 40 points by even its
most liberal followers,
But SC had its moments, too.
Coach Jess Mortensen's Trojans
broke a meet record and produced
the season's top collegiate marks in
the 440 and discus as Troy's NCAA
quarter champ Jim Lea shot out of
the Coliseum tunnel, ripped around
one turn, and cut the tape in 47.8,
and Des Koch flipped the discus
170-9%, the best of his life.
SC's jumping fool, Ernie Shelton,
on his initial attempt crossed his
legs over the bar at (5-9 7/1(5 to
topple the former dual meet mark
of (i-8 set by SC's Johnny Wilson
in 1940.
After Lea had won the 440, he
was withdrawn from the last race,
the mile relay, setting up Stanford
for an outside chance in an event
in which SC had run 3:1(5.
Stanford had lost unimpressive
relay performances against Fresno
State and Michigan, but suddenly
the Indians pulled within grasp as
Lea, SC co-captain who did a 4(5.7
relay lap in the Oxy race, was re
placed and Stanford's Fred George,
holder of a 4(5.9 relay lap last year
and who earlier placed third in the
quarter at 48.8. ran for the first
time this season.
Coach Jack Weiershauser sent i
Dill Hupp, Walt Garrett, and Wood J

Alameda, 6-5, in 12 innings as Warren Goodrich led the attack in both games.

Twenty - six Indians arrived
home yesterday with a moral
victory.
Saturday they burned their
press clippings, stormed intc
SC's village, and raised all kind?
of dust in winning more than
they were supposed to - includ
ing a super-surprise triumph in
the mile relay.
Stanford lost the actual battle, 88-
4.'!, but Troy': NCAA champs were
knocked oft in live events and never
threatened the century mark many
thought they would shatter.
Cards Gerry Wood and Leo Long
achieved expectel wins in the high
hurdles and javelin, but when Stan
lord's Al Cheney started the Coli
seum meet off with an upset victory
in the shot, when Jim Luttrell later
hopped home first in the lows, and
when a Trojan quartet was beaten
by over two seconds in the mile re
lay by a previously unspectacular
Tribe foursome, the score began
reaching stratospheric heights for
Stanford, which was tabbed for no
more than 40 points by even its
most liberal followers,
But SC had its moments, too.
Coach Jess Mortensen's Trojans
broke a meet record and produced
the season's top collegiate marks in
the 440 and discus as Troy's NCAA
quarter champ Jim Lea shot out of
the Coliseum tunnel, ripped around
one turn, and cut the tape in 47.8,
and Des Koch flipped the discus
170-9%, the best of his life.
SC's jumping fool, Ernie Shelton,
on his initial attempt crossed his
legs over the bar at (5-9 7/1(5 to
topple the former dual meet mark
of (i-8 set by SC's Johnny Wilson
in 1940.
After Lea had won the 440, he
was withdrawn from the last race,
the mile relay, setting up Stanford
for an outside chance in an event
in which SC had run 3:1(5.
Stanford had lost unimpressive
relay performances against Fresno
State and Michigan, but suddenly
the Indians pulled within grasp as
Lea, SC co-captain who did a 4(5.7
relay lap in the Oxy race, was re
placed and Stanford's Fred George,
holder of a 4(5.9 relay lap last year
and who earlier placed third in the
quarter at 48.8. ran for the first
time this season.
Coach Jack Weiershauser sent i
Dill Hupp, Walt Garrett, and Wood J
ahead of George, who brought the i
baton home in 3:17.8.
Wood won the high sticks by two |
yards in 14.8, and Luttrell snatched]
the low barriers in 23.5. his all
time high and one of the nation's
best marks. He also placed third in
the highs.
