# Tribe Nine Overcomes Eleven Errors To Rack Up Two Non-League Triumphs
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
The Stanford baseball team, in spite of the fact that it played its
sloppiest ball of the season, managed to roll to two victories this
weekend, beating USF, 6-2 on Friday, and then squeezing by
Alameda Naval Air Station, 6-5, in 12 innings Saturday.
All told, the Cards committed 11 errors in their two non-league

endeavors.
If the Indians had some sloppy ball
to get out of their system, then last
weekend was the time to do it.
While the hitless wonders were re
laxing from CI B A competition,
highly touted USC was dropping two
out of three tilts to UCLA and Cal
lost one contest in three to Santa
Clara.
The Indian team almost kicked
away Saturday's thriller in the top
of the 12th inning before being
handed the game back in the last
half of the same frame.
Alameda scored two unearned
runs in the top of the 12th. but Rich
Seramaglia walked to open Stan
ford's half. Warren Goodrich, who
had slammed a single, triple, and
homer, also walked. Tom Dandurand
then popped an attempted sacrifice
to the pitcher, but Al Talboy walked
to load the bases.
Bob Evans was passed forcing
home the Cards' fourth run'. Catcher
Len Swartz plunked down a beau
tiful bunt for a single to bring across
the tying run. Then Don DeLong
clinched his own game by singling
to center.
Stanford apparently had the game
sewed up in the ninth, 3-2, but De-
Long's wild pick-off attempt per
mitted hitter Gus Pahl to come home
all the way from first with Alameda's
tying run.
Stanford's early scoring was due
mostly to the efforts of Goodrich.
The sure-gloved shortstop rapped a
homer inside the park in the first
inning and tripled in Seramaglia in
the sixth with a line shot to the left
field corner.
Goodrich also contributed a good
share of the heavy hitting in Friday's
miscue-marred victory over USF.
He banged two tremendous three
baggers. Evans and Talboy each
pounded out two hits in the Cards'
nine hit attack.
The aces of the Stanford staff. Ray
Young and Phil Page, limited the
improved but still erratic Dons to
five safeties. Both runs came off
Page who worked the last four
frames.
The hitting and fielding of short
stop Goodrich were the bright spots
in the weekend's performances.
