## 
### CURT HASS 
The fabulous Max Howell wound
up his intercollegiate rugby career
Saturday in leading California to a
14-6 win over Stanford.
Howell ended five illustrious
years of playing California rugby in
a roaring success while pacing his
team to its second win of the season
over the Indians. It was the final
game for Cal and it gives the Bears
nine victories in 13 contests. The
Indians have lost only two games in
12 outings, for one of their best
rugby seasons in Stanford history.
Trailing Stanford, (5-3, the Bears
were suddenly jarred to life when
Howell was cut down by powerful
Dick Abraham. Cal. in seeming re
sentment, started their upsurge with
Howell leading the attack. He at
tempted a drop kick from the 45-
yard line which went wide. A few
minutes later, swinging his foot on
the 48, Howell connected on a spec
tacular drop kick to tie the score,
6-6.
After another four minutes had
elapsed, Alan Schmeiser booted a
14-yard penalty kick to place the
Bears in front, 9-6. Then with four
minutes left in the game, Matt Ha
zeltine grabbed Don Hartley's high
punt, boomed over Stanford's Sam
Thornton, and sped the remaining
30 yards for the try. Schmeiser con
verted for Cal's final points.
Dorsey Atkinson, Stanford's well
known place kicker scored on a
penalty kick from the 35-yard line
lor the first Indian tally. Ten min
utes later Atkinson again made good
on a penally kick, this one from 43
yards out. to give Stanford its 6-3
half-time edge.
The Indians were handicapped
for most of the game, however,
when they were forced to play with
14 men. Bob Antle was put off the
field for slugging after only 22 min
utes had been played.
In the preliminary game, the
Stanford JV's downed California,
13-12. This was the second win for
the Braves over the Blues, and their
11 th m 12 starts.
