# S.F. BALLET
## Reviewer Rates 'Serenade' Best in Choreography 
### JUDY DICKINSON 
The San Francisco Ballet played before a responsive and en
thusiastic audience in its opening performance Saturday night in
Memorial Auditorium.
Of the three ballets performed, "Serenade" was the best in
presentation and choreography. The music for this ballet was

written by Tschaikowsky, and
George Balanchine of the Now York
City Ballet did the choreography.
"Serenade" was done in the clas
sical style with emphasis going from
the small movement of the hand to
the larger, more flowing movement
of the whole body. These two move
ments used in contrast were very
effective and the Corps dc Ballet
danced with feeling and precision.
Nancy Johnson was outstanding
and danced with elegance, feeling,
and complete control of movement.
Gordon Paxman and Carlos Carva
jal showed excellent form in the
traditional leaps and turns â€”all very
pleasing to watch. Sally Bailey,
rounding out the quartet of dancers,
also did a fine job of interpretation.
The program opened with "Hcuri
gor," a new ballet previewed for
the first time Saturday night. The
story was exercised with good char
acterization and humor, and the au
dience showed by its applause that
it was delightful to watch.
The effective use of streamers in
Maypole fashion added to the inter
est of the ballet, and the dance steps
used were not in pure classical style.
The ballet will be even more cflcc
tivc with more rehearsal.
Sally Bailey danced the part of
the bride with feeling, and Gordon
Paxman again was allowed to show
his dexterity, this time with difficult
rhythmic steps.
"Con Amore," the last ballot pre
sented, was light, gay, and humor
ous. The quartet of dancers men
tioned above gave another out
standing performance. Conrad Lud
low, who danced the thief in Scenc
I, also turned in a fine performance.
