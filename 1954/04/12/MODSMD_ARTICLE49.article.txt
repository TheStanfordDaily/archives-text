CRUCIAL AREA—New and violent fighting has erupted in
widely separated areas of Indochina. The Reds struck near the
point where Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand meet, crossed the
Mekong River, and attacked Moulapamok. Meanwhile, the
French are holding out at the beseiged fortress of Dien Bien
Phu in northwestern Laos. —NEA Telephoto
