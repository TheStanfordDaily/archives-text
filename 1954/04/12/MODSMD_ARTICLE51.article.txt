# '54 Quad to Be Finished Early
## 
### 
The 1954 Quad will be distributed '
earlier this year than in the past,
beginning distribution the first day
of dead weekâ€”the result of contin
ued efforts by. the staff to make final
deadlines.
As a result, more material was de
livered to the printer and the en
graver in the early months than w;is
required. The final pages were com
pleted April 8, a week ahead of
schedule. Co-editor Ralph Bueh
walter estimated that several hun
dred dollars were saved by the de
crease in overtime required.
Co-editor Jon Stufflebecm em
phasized that early completion
meant no drop in quality. "On the
contrary," he added, "having mate
rial in early allowed more time to
improve photography and to double
check identifications."
The editors stated that the stair
was larger this year, as well as bet
ter co-ordinated. Other factors con
tributing to the successful meeting
of all deadlines were better sched
uling of staff working hours and
stricter appointment schedules for
individual and group pictures.
Sales are now close to 2,000, about
the same as those of last year at
this time. The first Quads, those
with names stamped on the cover,
are expected to be delivered May 26.
