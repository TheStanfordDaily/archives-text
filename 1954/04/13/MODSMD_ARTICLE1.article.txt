"Population Increases and State '
Functions" last night in the Politi
cal Union to spend more than an 112
hour answering qeustions on several
of California's thorniest political
problems. ■,
These were among the hot issues I
that Knight tackJed before a crowd- j •
ed Cubberley Auditorium:
"I low do you stand on FEPS
and health insurance?" '
Knight answered, "I am opposed
to FEPC mainly because the people
do not want it, as shown by a 3-1 i r
vote in a popular referendum in j I
1946. I just don't believe you can j j
make morality by force or law." In j j
regard to health insurance, he said, 112
while he is "against everything so- [
cialistic," he does favor "catastro- j V
phic insurance" financed if possible | |
through private insurance firms. j |
"Why did you support the loy- |
ally oath program while a regent
a( (lie University of California?" 1
He said he supported it, first, be- |
cause the Communist party is not a ; 1
bona fide American political party j
and, secondly, because he feared ; |
flial without such a statement of §
loyally, the reputation of the uni- i |
vcrsity would suffer.
A loyalty oath at Stanford he con- |
sidcred unnecessary since there has p
been no suggestion of Communist j
activity on this campus.
"l>o you think it would he of
value in the coming elections to
have public debates on important
issues?"
"It would be of tremendous value
lo some, but not to me," the Gov- '
ernor quipped. ,
"Why arc state funds used for j
parks and beaches instead of
ovcr-crowded schools?"
The reports of the number of
over - crowded schools Knight be- (
lieves have been grossly exagger
ated. In the last of the Leg- |
islature, $100 million was appropri- j
ated for the construction of new 0
schools. The bill was passed unani- p
mously. c
"llow do you stand on (he 18- 112
year-old vote?" 112
Although Knight stated that he
had not given much consideration to (
the issue, he said he would be slow j ;
to recommend such a change. \

Goveinor Goodwin J. Knight
skimmed over.his prepared text on i
"Population Increases and State '
Functions" last night in the Politi
cal Union to spend more than an 112
hour answering qeustions on several
of California's thorniest political
problems. ■,
These were among the hot issues I
that Knight tackJed before a crowd- j •
ed Cubberley Auditorium:
"I low do you stand on FEPS
and health insurance?" '
Knight answered, "I am opposed
to FEPC mainly because the people
do not want it, as shown by a 3-1 i r
vote in a popular referendum in j I
1946. I just don't believe you can j j
make morality by force or law." In j j
regard to health insurance, he said, 112
while he is "against everything so- [
cialistic," he does favor "catastro- j V
phic insurance" financed if possible | |
through private insurance firms. j |
"Why did you support the loy- |
ally oath program while a regent
a( (lie University of California?" 1
He said he supported it, first, be- |
cause the Communist party is not a ; 1
bona fide American political party j
and, secondly, because he feared ; |
flial without such a statement of §
loyally, the reputation of the uni- i |
vcrsity would suffer.
A loyalty oath at Stanford he con- |
sidcred unnecessary since there has p
been no suggestion of Communist j
activity on this campus.
"l>o you think it would he of
value in the coming elections to
have public debates on important
issues?"
"It would be of tremendous value
lo some, but not to me," the Gov- '
ernor quipped. ,
"Why arc state funds used for j
parks and beaches instead of
ovcr-crowded schools?"
The reports of the number of
over - crowded schools Knight be- (
lieves have been grossly exagger
ated. In the last of the Leg- |
islature, $100 million was appropri- j
ated for the construction of new 0
schools. The bill was passed unani- p
mously. c
