(Kd. note—The Daily asked the six candidates for ASSU President to
state their stands on four specific issues: constitutional revision, NSA
membership, an academic freedom program, and the Honor Code clari
fication. Their statements have been edited to include only the answers

Pete Bin#

In considering the office of presi
dent of student body there is an out
standing prerequisite — a thorough
knowledge both of Stanford's stu
dent government and of the admini
stration. On the basis of my partici
pation in the last NSA Regional
Conference and NSA's previous ac
tivities, I now feel our affiliation
should not be continued, subject to
final evaluation after the national
conference this summer.
The Honor Code problem can be
solved only by joint effort of the
University faculty and Excom. An
administration which is not informed
of student opinion cannot effect a
mutually suitable solution.
This can only be accomplished
with an Excom that is representa
tive of the student body. That the
present organization is not is gen
erally accepted. To resolve this
problem will require the effort of all
the people active in government
next. year.

Al Brouse

I favor a continuation of Stan
ford's membership in NSA, until the
organization has had a chance to
prove its worth. If this demands our
leadership, let us accept the respon
sibility that our position as a ma
jor university entails.
In line with my general opposition
to censorship in education, I believe
that if an adequate sampling of stu
dent opinion favors such a move,
Excom should take a firm public
stand in support of the principles of
academic freedom.
Although the Honor Code con
troversy turned out to be an un
fortunate affair, there is need for
further definition of student rights
and duties under the Code. This
should be undertaken, with the
warning that too much definition
could weaken it to the point of los
ing its original meaning.
Delays common in effecting legis
lation could be eliminated by tight
ening inter-governmental ties, plac
ing more power in the Executive
branch, and overhauling business
procedures.

Peter Clute

The average Stanford student does
not know NSA. The reason for this
appears to he a lack of interest due
to poor information about the pro's
of such an organization. If NSA's
proponents want, the benefit of the
association, they must take the in
itiative in bringing NSA's benefits
to Stanford.
Tlie Honor Code is an integral part
of student life. Any restrictions
placed upon it in order to obstruct
the actions of a very few would be
to little avail. A 'loophole' placed
in the Honor Code would greatly
weaken the basic structure and leave
room for further amendments.
If students show interest in a pro
gram of academic freedom study and
discussion, Excom must take the in
itiative in establishing such a pro
gram.
A student government committee
is about to bring about reforms long
needed in the ASSU. By better dis
tributing representation and in
terest, it can give Excom the power
it was designed to have.

Rudv Reich

The ASSU must turn its efforts
to a constructive program within the
resources and manpower available
rather than spend its time debating
"issues." A good start has been made
toward consolidating the many com
mittees in student government.
Last year an investigation of aca
demic freedom was started only to
be dropped. If sufficient interest ex
ists in this problem, it should be
turned over to an organization
which can handle the issue ade
quately.
Stanford should participate in
NSA either fully as a permanent
member taking advantage of any
benefits it has, or not at all.
The major problem ot the Honor
Code is to educate the students im
mediately to its objectives.
Student government should be
brought to the students by holding
meetings in the residences and edu
cating students to problems facing
the ASSU. Without strong and re
sponsible leadership Excom can be
come little more than a rubber
stamp.

Guy Shoup

Positive and publicized clarifica
tion of the Honor Code is a must.
The most imperative step is intro
duction of a clause in the Honor
Code prohibiting the taking of tests
from the classroom.
Stanford's experience in NSA so
far has been largely contributing. I
do not believe that. Stanfoi'd's par
ticipation in NSA up to now is justi
fied by the financial outlay. Two
things may change this position:
1) attendance at the National Con
gress this summer, and 2) the newly
acquired district leadership.
I do not think the ASSU should
take an official stand on academic
freedom. However, academic free
dom education should be carried on
through all available media of pub
licity.
Codification of the present con
stitution and re-examination of the
goals of student government are es
sential. The establishment of a per
manent constitution revision com
mittee and the construction of a
"model" constitution for new organi
zations to avoid bickering would
help greatly.

Leu Stroud

I believe Stanford should retain
its membership in NSA for one more
year on a trial basis. Now, with our
own representative from this region,
we are able to offer greater leader
ship, and can contribute more to
this association.
Regarding the Honor Code, the
decision of removing examinations
from the rooms should bo decided by
a vote of students in the individual
classes.
Although academic freedom is a
very important issue to both faculty
and students, it doesn't appear that
we are sufficiently aware of its pos
sible effects. A stronger attempt
should be made to stimulate student
interest in this situation.
I believe that the new Student
Government Committee recently
given the go-ahead by Excom to ex
amine the present government will
do much to orient the students in
the'problems of governing here at
Stanford. Its findings should be
acted upon in order to promote
gteater relationships between stu
dent bodv and the government.

I favor a continuation of Stan
ford's membership in NSA, until the
organization has had a chance to
prove its worth. If this demands our
leadership, let us accept the respon
sibility that our position as a ma
jor university entails.
In line with my general opposition

Excom should take a firm public
stand in support of the principles of

Although the Honor Code con
troversy turned out to be an un
fortunate affair, there is need for
further definition of student rights
and duties under the Code. This
should be undertaken, with the
warning that too much definition
could weaken it to the point of los

Delays common in effecting legis

The average Stanford student does
not know NSA. The reason for this
appears to he a lack of interest due
to poor information about the pro's
of such an organization. If NSA's
proponents want, the benefit of the
association, they must take the in
itiative in bringing NSA's benefits
to Stanford.
Tlie Honor Code is an integral part
of student life. Any restrictions
placed upon it in order to obstruct
the actions of a very few would be
to little avail. A 'loophole' placed
in the Honor Code would greatly
weaken the basic structure and leave
room for further amendments.
If students show interest in a pro
gram of academic freedom study and
discussion, Excom must take the in
itiative in establishing such a pro
gram.
A student government committee
is about to bring about reforms long
needed in the ASSU. By better dis
tributing representation and in
terest, it can give Excom the power
it was designed to have.

Rudv Reich

The ASSU must turn its efforts
to a constructive program within the
resources and manpower available
rather than spend its time debating
"issues." A good start has been made
toward consolidating the many com
mittees in student government.
Last year an investigation of aca
demic freedom was started only to
be dropped. If sufficient interest ex
ists in this problem, it should be
turned over to an organization
which can handle the issue ade
quately.
Stanford should participate in
NSA either fully as a permanent
member taking advantage of any
benefits it has, or not at all.
The major problem ot the Honor
Code is to educate the students im
mediately to its objectives.
Student government should be
brought to the students by holding
meetings in the residences and edu
cating students to problems facing
the ASSU. Without strong and re
sponsible leadership Excom can be
come little more than a rubber
stamp.

Guy Shoup

Positive and publicized clarifica
tion of the Honor Code is a must.
The most imperative step is intro
duction of a clause in the Honor
Code prohibiting the taking of tests
from the classroom.
Stanford's experience in NSA so
far has been largely contributing. I
do not believe that. Stanfoi'd's par
ticipation in NSA up to now is justi
fied by the financial outlay. Two
things may change this position:
1) attendance at the National Con
gress this summer, and 2) the newly
acquired district leadership.
I do not think the ASSU should
take an official stand on academic
freedom. However, academic free
dom education should be carried on
through all available media of pub
licity.
Codification of the present con
stitution and re-examination of the

Leu Stroud

I believe Stanford should retain
its membership in NSA for one more
year on a trial basis. Now, with our
own representative from this region,
we are able to offer greater leader
ship, and can contribute more to
this association.
Regarding the Honor Code, the

The average Stanford student does
not know NSA. The reason for this
appears to he a lack of interest due
to poor information about the pro's
of such an organization. If NSA's
proponents want, the benefit of the
association, they must take the in
itiative in bringing NSA's benefits
to Stanford.
Tlie Honor Code is an integral part
of student life. Any restrictions
placed upon it in order to obstruct
the actions of a very few would be
to little avail. A 'loophole' placed
in the Honor Code would greatly
weaken the basic structure and leave
room for further amendments.
If students show interest in a pro
gram of academic freedom study and
discussion, Excom must take the in
itiative in establishing such a pro
gram.
A student government committee
is about to bring about reforms long
needed in the ASSU. By better dis
tributing representation and in
terest, it can give Excom the power
it was designed to have.

Rudv Reich

The ASSU must turn its efforts
to a constructive program within the
resources and manpower available
rather than spend its time debating
"issues." A good start has been made
toward consolidating the many com
mittees in student government.
Last year an investigation of aca
demic freedom was started only to
be dropped. If sufficient interest ex
ists in this problem, it should be
turned over to an organization
which can handle the issue ade
quately.
Stanford should participate in
NSA either fully as a permanent
member taking advantage of any
benefits it has, or not at all.
The major problem ot the Honor
Code is to educate the students im
mediately to its objectives.
Student government should be
brought to the students by holding
meetings in the residences and edu
cating students to problems facing
the ASSU. Without strong and re
sponsible leadership Excom can be
come little more than a rubber
stamp.

Guy Shoup

Positive and publicized clarifica
tion of the Honor Code is a must.
The most imperative step is intro
duction of a clause in the Honor
Code prohibiting the taking of tests
from the classroom.
Stanford's experience in NSA so
far has been largely contributing. I
do not believe that. Stanfoi'd's par
ticipation in NSA up to now is justi
fied by the financial outlay. Two
things may change this position:
1) attendance at the National Con
gress this summer, and 2) the newly
acquired district leadership.
I do not think the ASSU should
take an official stand on academic
freedom. However, academic free
dom education should be carried on
through all available media of pub
licity.
Codification of the present con
stitution and re-examination of the
goals of student government are es
sential. The establishment of a per
manent constitution revision com
mittee and the construction of a
"model" constitution for new organi
zations to avoid bickering would
help greatly.

Leu Stroud

I believe Stanford should retain
its membership in NSA for one more
year on a trial basis. Now, with our
own representative from this region,
we are able to offer greater leader
ship, and can contribute more to
this association.
Regarding the Honor Code, the
decision of removing examinations
from the rooms should bo decided by
a vote of students in the individual
classes.
Although academic freedom is a
very important issue to both faculty
and students, it doesn't appear that
we are sufficiently aware of its pos
sible effects. A stronger attempt
should be made to stimulate student
interest in this situation.
I believe that the new Student
Government Committee recently
given the go-ahead by Excom to ex
amine the present government will
do much to orient the students in
the'problems of governing here at
Stanford. Its findings should be
acted upon in order to promote
gteater relationships between stu
dent bodv and the government.

In considering the office of presi
dent of student body there is an out
standing prerequisite — a thorough
knowledge both of Stanford's stu
dent government and of the admini
stration. On the basis of my partici
pation in the last NSA Regional
Conference and NSA's previous ac
tivities, I now feel our affiliation
should not be continued, subject to
final evaluation after the national
conference this summer.
The Honor Code problem can be
solved only by joint effort of the
University faculty and Excom. An
administration which is not informed
of student opinion cannot effect a
mutually suitable solution.
This can only be accomplished
with an Excom that is representa
tive of the student body. That the
present organization is not is gen
erally accepted. To resolve this
problem will require the effort of all
the people active in government
next. year.

Al Brouse

I favor a continuation of Stan
ford's membership in NSA, until the
organization has had a chance to
prove its worth. If this demands our
leadership, let us accept the respon
sibility that our position as a ma
jor university entails.
In line with my general opposition
to censorship in education, I believe
that if an adequate sampling of stu
dent opinion favors such a move,
Excom should take a firm public
stand in support of the principles of
academic freedom.
Although the Honor Code con
troversy turned out to be an un
fortunate affair, there is need for
further definition of student rights
and duties under the Code. This
should be undertaken, with the
warning that too much definition
could weaken it to the point of los
ing its original meaning.
Delays common in effecting legis
lation could be eliminated by tight
ening inter-governmental ties, plac
ing more power in the Executive
branch, and overhauling business
procedures.
