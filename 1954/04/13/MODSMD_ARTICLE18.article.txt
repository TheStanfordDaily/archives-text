## Let the Voters Know 
### 
A warm smile, a resonant voice, and a Stan
ford jacket are not the only qualifications for
positions in student government. Personal ap
pearance and mannerisms are important, but
they should not assume primary importance
m the judgment of 'candidates for student of
fices.
We fear that in past elections, student voters
have not had the chance to "know" each can
didate. Those voters have been met with the
smile, the sincerity, and the platitudes of Stan
ford's greatness. But they have not been met
with the candidate's individual stands on the
issues which face Stanford students and their
government.
The issues are there. Any statement that
"there are no issues now" is an admission of
self-satisfaction, an advocacy of the status quo,
a denial of activity and progress itself.
We have judged the present Stanford situa
tion and have concluded that the following are
issues which should be considered by each
student and each candidate for election to lead
ership:
1. Stanford's membership in the National
Students Association. Stanford is a member
now and it has assumed leadership in the re
gional organization of NSA, but its membership
will be reconsidered by the Executive Coin
mittee next fall. Will we continue to give our
support to that organization?
2. The Honor Code. After the heated discus
sions on the Honor Code last quarter, interest
lias quieted down. Hut the question of clarify-

ing the rights and lesponsibilities of the Code
remains. Discussions will be held in the living
groups next week lor that purpose. What does
the Honor Code mean?
3. Academic Freedom. Last fall quarter, Ex
ccrn dumped u program lor orientation on the
meanings of academic freedom and the formu
lation of a student academic freedom state
ment. Many students are wondering what
happened to the piogram. Should the ASSU
revive such a program?
4. Student Government Evaluation. Last
Wednesday night, Excom heard the first report
from a special "Student Government" commit
tee which Excom requested to evaluate the
structure of the ASSU and suggest possible re
visions. What changes are necessary?
We have asked each candidate for ASSU i
president to comment on these issues in their
campaign statements. The statements appear
on page 1 of today's Daily.
We hope that every student will consider
the statements and include them in their con
sideration of the candidates. We hope that the
candidates themselves will continue to voice
their views on the specific questions facing
Stanford's student organization.
And we sincerely hope that in every student
election, both the voters and the candidates will
realize that the leaders of the Associated Stu
dents must be more than congenial public rela
tions men. The must be the leaders of the stu
dents. directed by the interests and views of 1
the students.
