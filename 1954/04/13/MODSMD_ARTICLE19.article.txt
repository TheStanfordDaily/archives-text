Following a four-month study, the Interfra
ternity Council last week drew up a recommen
dation for presentation to President Sterling
asking that the Council be given complete re
sponsibility for discipline over Stanford's 23
fraternities.
If adopted, the plan would strip fraternity
disciplinary power from the present Injerfra
ternity Board. This board is composed of seven
students, four faculty members, and two fra
ternity alumni.
In essence, what the proposal seeks is the
concentration of fraternity discipline exclu
sively in the hands of students, with President
Sterling retaining his right of final authority
over all decisions.
The primary advantage of the plan, v/e be
lieve, would be the establishment of a closer
relationship between Stanford's 23 fraternities
and the powers which hold judicial authority

over them. Discipline, under this plan, would
be both more efficient and more effective.
Cases could be considered as soon as possible
violations are reported, rather than after a com
plaint is filed with the luterfraternity Council,
as is necessary under the present program.
Corrective action could be taken before any dif
ficulties become widespread.
We also believe that adoption of the plan
would lead to better relations among the
houses, and between the houses and the cam
pus and community. As IFC President Gene
Diis pointed oiit when he announced details
of the program last week, "The fraternities will
be looking out for each other and for tfie frater
nity system. They will not be trying 1o play
hide-and-seek with a distant disciplinary
force."
The Daily feels the changes contained in the
recommendation are justified and are worthy
of careful consideration by the administration.
