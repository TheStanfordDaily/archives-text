## An 'Avowed Communist'? 
### 
To the Editor:
It seems to me that one important thing has slip
ped by unnoticed in the pro and con re David Work
mans April 7 letter to the editor. In this country
we have always tried to follow a basic tenet in our
judgment of others, tho gist - of which is: "Innocent
until proven guilty." >
Mr. Workman has rendered a verdict based on in
sufficient evidence. Is this a lawyer's way? I am
surprised that Mr. Workman hps riot been called to
tusk lor labeling Mr. Macanovic an "avowed Com
munist."
"Avowed Communist" indeed! "How does Mr.
Workman know this'.' Did Mr. Macanovic ever state or
deny being an "avowed Communist?" Did he so
•state in his scholarship application? Has Mr. Work
man decided that a student from Yugoslavia is au

tomatically an "avowed Communist?"
How would Mr. Workman feel if ho went to a
foreign scholarship (if he hasn't already) and found
on his arrival thai he had been prejudged a "capi
talist." "imperialist," etc. without cvpi - having spoken
a word in his own defense?
1 am not well versed in the mechanics of the For
eign Scholarship Committee, but it seems that the
persons serving on it realize that we native stu
dents have as much or more to gain from scholai
exchanges as do the foreign students.
i would be fascinated to exchange ideas with Mr.
Workman's "avowed Communist," and I am sure
that most of Stanford will appreciate such an op
portunity to meet a person from a controversial
country and thai they will do so with an open mind!
