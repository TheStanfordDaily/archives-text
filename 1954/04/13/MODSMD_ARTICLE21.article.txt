To the Editor:
Voters Beware:
Due to a new unpublieized change of policy by the
(.■lection board, names of "write-in" candidates are
not allowed to appear in The Daily—either in the
lists of candidates, statements of policy, advertise
ments, or in any other form.
This policy tends to discourage competition for of
fice by giving an unwarranted advantage to candi

dates who are sole nominees on the ballot.
We urge, therefore, that it you do not know and
approve of the policies of any candidate for an office—
and particularly with respect to offices which are
uncontested on the ballot leave the ballot blank as
to that office.
