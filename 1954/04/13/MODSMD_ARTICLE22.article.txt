### JACK BYRNE 
MORE CAMPUS P11.1.S
It appears that the previous compilation of candi
dates for the halls of hell neglected several people
for whom that spa would be far too cool. Accordingly,
here is an addition to the list of infamy.

Ihe Self-Styled Genius: No i
one should ever he called upon to
take a class with this guy, but i
there's one in every department. ■
Usually this guy has flunked out :
of three or four different schools, |
and is well on his way out of i
Stanford, but boy, you should i
hear this guy in a discussion [
group. |
They call it a discussion out of |
habit, but this Joe has it sewed •

up. "Didn t Schmeck find," he will query the teacher,
"that the formula for that statistic was 23 29/54 rather
than 23 28/54 as Gooch maintained?"

I
The Activities Man: How in hell does a guy get
to be in fourteen activities, play the meanest game of
tennis on the campus, get good grades, and still have
time lor social life? Need [ say more about this
kind? >
The Toy on Operator: This indolent demigod of the
PBX sits in grandeur in Toyori, with the guts of
DA .'5-3121 before him. If the mood strikes him he
will answer the call intended for Encina, Branner,
Stern, Crothers, or Toyon that must pass thru his
holiest of holy domains.
Fairly obviously, if you knew the number, you'd
tell him. With some pain and grunting, he resignedly
looks up the room tells you, and adjures you to call
by room number in the future. Boiling oil is in
finitely too good for this guy. What the people who
call in from outside the campus must think of a
joker like this defies description. Let's shape up on
this business: No one gets paid to insult the custo
mers anywhere else, why here?
