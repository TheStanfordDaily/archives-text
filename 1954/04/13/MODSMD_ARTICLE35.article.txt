# Majors to Open Today
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
Dwight Eisenhower, one of the nation's most avid golfers, unlimbers a new set of muscles today:
those of his good right arm. And as Ike throws down the first strike at Griffith Stadium in our
nations capital the big show, major league baseball, gets off to its official start in 1954.
President Eisenhower's pitch will mark the opening of the game between the world champion
New rork Yankees and the Washington Senato s, but in seven other major cities the other 14
big league teams will also move into action, all of them, as of today, with an equal chance to
shave in World Series ♦ —112 — —

money and glory.
But come this full and the climax
of tiie 154-game schedule, it is a
mathematical certainty that only
two ol these teams can share in the

great fall classic. And it is the con
sensus of the baseball experts that
this year's World Series will once
again find the Yankees represent-

ing the American League, with
Brooklyn once more doing the hon
ors for the senior circuit.
Popular sentiment, however, ap
pears to be running against the
two almost perennial champions. If
anybody can contain Casey Sten
gel's men in their sixth drive to a
sixth successive pennant, chances
are that Boston's young Red Sox
with a healthy Ted Williams, or
Cleveland's habitual also-rans, with
their three ace pitchers, Lemon,

I Garcia, and Wvnn, can do it.
Brooklyn's mo t rugged opposition
can come from u crowd - inspired
Milwaukee, from a Willie Mays-bol
slered New York or from a strong
all - around St. Louis team minus
I Enos Slaughter.
Local interest in today's big top
openers will be centered on the
Pittsburgh - Philadelphia National

KGO-TV will televise the ma
jor league opener from the na
tion's capital as the Washington
Senators host the world champion
New York Yankees at 12 noon.

League kame. Jack Shepard, cap
tain and catcher of last year's Stan
ford nine, is a good bet to handle
Pirate pitcher Bob Friend in today's
Quaker City opener.
Since everybody about this time
of the year likes to go out and find
liow wrong he can be about the
final standings of the team, the Daily

rogative. Here are The Daily picks
