# Card Netmen Beaten By UCLA and USC
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
The UCLA Bruin tennis team, the defending NCAA champs,
had too much strength up and down the ladder —from Bob Perry
to Joe Blatchford—and the Indian netters could only nab one
match Friday in absorbing an 8-1 defeat in their PCC opener.
Saturday the Tribe tried again—this time against Southern Cali-

fornia in front of television camera
on the Stanford courts. But Coach
Bob Renker's crew dropped a nar
row 5-4 battle to the Trojans.
The feature attraction Friday was
the first singles victory of Davis
Cupper Perry over Stanford's highly
ranked Jack Frost. Frost fought it
out through a 20-game first set be
fore bowing to the nation's number
12 performer, 11-9, 6-4.
Perry, who won the NCAA doub- I
ies title last summer, teamed up j
with co-captain Ron Livingston of
basketball fame to cut down Frost
and Gary Gray, 7-5, 6-1, in the two
against-two competition.
Livingston had won his earlier
j singles encounter from the Indians'
| Art Fish in straight sets, 6-3. 6-2.

Jim Cornish, veteran senior, was
Stanford's lone winner against the
Bruins with a 3-6, 6-3. 6-1 triumph
over Jim Reed of Santa Moinca.
Saturday afternoon Frost un
leashed an almost unerring first
serve and a deadly net game to
whack SC's Jacque Grigry with
comparative ease, 6-3, 6-4.
But it wasn't enough. Alan Cleve
j land joined Grigry to dump Frost
j and Gray in the doubles, 6-1, 7-5,
j and the Trojans took four other
matches for the win.
Henry Sutcliffe and Dave Duff
and the Art Fish-Cornish doubles
combo were the other winners for
the Indian cause.
