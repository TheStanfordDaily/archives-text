# Nine Looks For Victory Over Salinas Club
## 
### 
Phil Page and Ken Brown will
take their turns on the hill this af
ternoon as the Card baseballers go
after their last non-conference win
before returning to CIBA competi
tion over the weekend. Game time
is set lor 3:15 in the Sunken Dia
mond.
The Salinas Packers are newcom
ers to the California State League
this season, and according to Card
Coach Everett Dean "should give us
a good ball game."
Coach Dean plans to use the same
lineup which has set Stanford at
the top of the CIBA heap this sea
son. The Cards will be trying to
smooth out the infield defensive
mishaps which became so preva
lent in last weekend's tilts.
Len Swartz will be behind the
plate. Oleg Suzdaleff, Rich Scrama
glia, Tom Dandurand, and Warren
Goodrich will compose the regular
infield. Coach Dean especially
praised shortstop Goodrich for his
fine play in last week's games, both
defensively and at the plate.
A 1 Talboy, Bob Evans, and lead
off man Sid Hall will roam the out
field.
