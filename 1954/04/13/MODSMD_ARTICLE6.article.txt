# Goodwin Knight Returns to Stanford To Talk Politics and Recall Old Times
## 
### HADLEY ROFF 
Goodwin J. Knight, dapper in a light grey suit, returned to his
alma mater yesterday afternoon to talk about politics and old
times.
His eyes alight, the 1919 graduate, now Governor, thumbed
laughingly through old Quads that pictured him in his under-

graduate days.
And more seriously, he ad
vised guestioning newsmen
who met him on his arrival here
that "for the present" he is opposed
to a state law outlawing the Com
munist party.
He said he thought the people of
the state "are sufficiently alert and
sufficiently mature to protect them
selves against the Communist men
ace without passing such a law."
He added, however, that should
the state ever become lax toward
communism, then he would favor
the adoption of such legislation.
Several states are already consid
ering imposing a ban on Commu
nists.
Asked what issues he intends to
press in his upcoming campaign to
succeed himself, Knight said he
would stress his support of such
measures as the narcotics bill, the
liquor reform resolution, the bal
anced budget achieved without
boosting taxes, and increased unem
ployment insurance, all adopted in
the recently concluded session of
the Legislature.
Arriving on campus about <> p.m.,
he went immediately to Bowman
Alumni House where he met ven*-
erable Sam McDonald, storekeeper
of Stanford memories. He ehattcd
at length about classmates and pro
fessors.
As he flipped eagerly through
Quads of his generation, the silver
haired Governor would pause oc
casionally to point out an old pal.
"That's so-and-so," he would ex
claim.
And, displaying a keen memory,
he would recite the activities of the
classmates, and the positions they
now hold.
Every once in a while he would
come across a name that he would
repeat quickly to a secretary, ex
plaining, "This alum is a good sharp
guy, why shouldn't we get him out
working for Knight for Governor?"
Midway through his reminiscences
with McDonald, Knight turned to a
small group of students that col
lected about him.
"You know,"he told them en
thusiastically, "you are part of a
great university." He said he hoped
that every student would take some
time out from his books to join an
extra curricula)- activity. "They
bring you close to human beings," he
said, "and that's a very important
part of anyone's education."
Detailing his views on the out
lawing of the Communist party, he
said there arc two ways to look at
the problem.
"First," he said, "if we pass a law
in California outlawing the Com
munist party, we are faced with the
inevitable fact that the Communists
will organize and work under better
sounding names, secretly and in a
conspiratorial manner.
"On the other hand," he continued,
"the outlawing of the Communist
party would declare unequivocally
that they are a conspiracy and a
menacing group to our country."
