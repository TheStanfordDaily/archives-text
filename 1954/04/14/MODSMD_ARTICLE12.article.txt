## Oppenheimer Barred From Bomb Secrets 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 13 (UP)
—President Eisenhower person
ally ordered a "blank wall" be
tween Dr. J. Robert Oppenheim
er and A-bomb and H-bomb se
crets because of "substantial
derogatory information" report
ed to him. by the Justice Depart
ment, it was disclosed today.
The suspension of one of this
country's most renowned atom sci
entists, credited with mastermind
ing U.S. development of the A
bomb, touched off shock waves at
home and abroad and preliminary
moves toward Congressional inves
tigations.
Chairman W. Sterling Cole (R.,
N.Y.) and Vice-Chairman Bourke B.
Hickenlooper (P., la.) of the Sen
ate-House Atomic Energy Commit
tee said, however, their group is
"fully acquainted" with the case and
finds "no fault" with the "proce
dures taken by the Atomic Energy
Commission"
Informed sources said they be
lieve Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy (R„
Wis.) may have known of the new
action on Oppenheimer before he
charged recently that U.S. H-bomb
development had been delayed 18
months.
Sen. Karl E. Mundt (R., S.D.),
temporary chairman of McCarthy's
Senate Investigating subcommittee,
said Oppenheimer's case and the al
leged H-bomb delays were called to
the attention of some members of
the group around last May.
Oppenheimer is accused of two
main counts, past close association
with Communists and Communist
causes, and with delaying U.S. H
bomb production.
In his reply, demanding a hearing,
the noted nuclear physicist denied
he was ever a Communist and de
clared he did not, oppose H-bomb
development after former President
Truman decided to go ahead with it.
In fact, he claimed credit for helping
to set up the program that led to the
successful achievement of the H
bomb.
