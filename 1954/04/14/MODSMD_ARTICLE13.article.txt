PHOENIX, Ariz., April 14 (UPâ€”
Son. .Joseph McCarthy told report
ers tonight he believer! the Commu
nists had "free access" to all infor
mation on the hydrogen and atomic
bombs.
Sen. McCarthy said, "I can say
very conservatively that I don't be
lieve that there is a single atomic or
hydrogen secret which is not avail
able to the Communists."
McCarthy, who has been in Ari
zona for a week to recuperate from
a virus infection, said that he had
begun an investigation into the loy
alty of atomic scientist J. Robert
Oppenheimer and "others" last May.
But. he said that it was decided un
animously by the Senate Investigat
ing subcommittee, of which McCar
thy is chairman, that from the
standpoint of "national security," it
would not be wise to hold public
hearings into the matter at that
time.
McCarthy said that lie had a con
ference with "two White House
aides, a high administration official,
and a man from the Justice Depart
ment" to discuss the security mat
ter relating to the hydrogen bomb.
