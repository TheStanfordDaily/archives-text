# Prof. Freidel Traces FDR's Rise to Power
## 
### GERRY SMITH 
"Franklin Roosevelt nearly al
ways came out on the winning
side, but if he didn't, he could
convince people he did," Profes
sor Frank Freidel stated in the
Tuesday Evening Series lecturc
on "Franklin D. Roosevelt's Rise
to Power" last night.
In the 1920 campaign, which Frei
del called "a disaster to the Demo
cratic party, but certainly not to
Roosevelt," FDR made friends and
convinced people that he was the
one to watch in politics. However.
Freidel also said that "without the
depression, Franklin Roosevelt
wouldn't have reached the White
House."
"Franklin was conscipusly trying
to follow in Teddy's footsteps,'"
Freidel said, "but Teddy bad fits of
anxiety" and Franklin was always
confident.
FDR went into the Democratic
party "because his father was a con
servative Democrat; otherwise he
might have been a Republican,"
Freidel reported. "Besides, the
Democrats gave him a chance, and
the Republicans didn't."
Roosevelt would have become an
admiral if he had had his own way,
and he was always "a good deal of a
frustrated admiral," Freidel contin
ued.
"Diplomacy interested him great
lyâ€”almost as much as the Navy,"
Freidel said. He learned about for
eign relations through his wife,
Theodore Roosevelt's "favorite
niece."
"Hideous disaster" struck in 1921
when Roosevelt caught polio and
was flat on his back, unable to move
a muscle. Wrong treatment caused
him to be unable to take a step un
aided from then on, but he became
an "attractive young man" to the
public because of his enormous ef
fort to get back on his feet, Freidel
mentioned.
Roosevelt "engaged in a great deal
of charming double talk" during the
first Presidential campaign, con
trasting with Hoover's "dreary"
speeches, according to Freidel.
"These speeches indicated real po
litical genius."
Roosevelt became President by his
energy, name, and unifying the
split Democratic party, Freidel said.
But he worked "long, earnestly, and
as intelligently as anyone could to
become President, of the United
States."
Roosevelt, realized that the first
requisite of being President was po
litical power, Freidel concluded, and
during the years that followed "he
showed himself not in the least
afraid to exercise that power."
