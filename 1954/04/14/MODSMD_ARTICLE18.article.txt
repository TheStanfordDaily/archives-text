# Voting Procedure
## 
### 
A general summary for vot
ing procedure and qualifica
tions for today's ASSU and
class officer elections is out
lined below:
All candidates for class offices
chall be considered as of the time
they will take office. A fresh
man will vote for sophomore
class officers as that will be their
standing when they assume of
fice.
The exception to this rule is
that a senior in graduate school
who has "graduate" circled on
his student body card may vote
as a graduate student, not as a
senior.
In electing residence represen
tatives to Excom, voters are to be
considered as from the areas in
which they now live. A student
from off-campus votes for an off
campus candidate although he
may be planning to move on
campus next fall.

According to the ASSU consti
tution, the class standing of vot
ers shall be classified as follows:
"Freshman—Up to and includ
ing 44 units or less than three
quarters.
"Sophomore—From 45 units or
three quarters to 89 units, inclu
sive.
"Junior—From DO units or six
quarters to 134 units, inclusive.
"Senior — From 135 units or
nine quarters to graduation.
"Graduate—Graduate standing
or seniors in graduate school
with "graduate" circled on their
student body cards."
Write-in candidates shall be
in both the primary
and final elections. Any write-in
candidate who qualifies for the
final elections in the primaries
and does not wish to run, must
decline by 5 p.m. tomorrow. All
write -in candidates who have
qualified for the finals shall be
contacted by the Election Board.
