I would like to giye ofT-campus
voters a sample of my views on is
sues before Excom. I'll use NSA as
this example. I attended the recent
Spring NSA Assembly at Mills Col
lege where I saw in part what NSA
on the intercollegiate level is like.
What I fee) NSA needs in this re
gion is more member schools (there
are only eight now) and more vig
orous leadership â€” only then will
NSA have had a real chance. I
would vote to continue our mem
bership in NSA at present, hoping it
will prove its real merits.
