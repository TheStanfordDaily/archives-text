My platform is active, sincere off
campus representatipn. I've been
active in organized off-campus af
fairs for two years, been past treas
urer and past president of Off-Cam
pus Men's Organization, and at
tended Excom meetings for the past
two quarters.
Since off-campus students consti
tute about 30 percent of the student
body, there should be a more effec
tive and expeditious method of in
forming them and polling their
opinions, because, although the ma
jority cannot be active in student
government, they are very inter
ested.
