# Palm Drive—Campus Hazard?
## 
### 

DANGER ON PALM DRlVE—Cars—three abreast—stream down Palm Drive during an after
noon rush hour. This typical scene has been noted by the Hazards Committee as one of the
most dangerous campus hazards. In the report on campus hazards submitted to the President,
the committee has recommended that a white line be painted down the center of Palm Drive to
prevent its becoming a one-way speedway. (See editorial comment, page 2.)
