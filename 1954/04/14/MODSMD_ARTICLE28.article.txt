## The
						Choice for Leadership 
### 
Today the Stanford voter takes the first step
in choosing his leaders for the school year
1954-55.
Some of the elections will be decided today.
Others will determine which candidates run olf
in the final elections next week.
But for all of the offices, the voter's choice
today will be important.
His choice will determine student govern
ford's leadership next year.
His choice wil determine student govern

ment action on many of the issues which will
carry over to next year.
We urge the obvious. We urge each student
to expiess his choice. We urge care and ma- 1
ture judgment in the determination of that
choice.
We hope that next year's student leader may
work with the knowledge and confidence that
he is truly representative of the students, that
he WdS elected not by a casual few but by a
thoughtful niajoiity of all the students.
