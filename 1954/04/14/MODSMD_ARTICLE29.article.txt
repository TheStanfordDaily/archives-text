# For Safety
## 
### 
The report on campus hazards recently sub
mitted to the President's office indicates that
positive steps must be taken to eliminate sev
eral "danger zones" at Stanford.
Prepared at the reguest of Excom, the report
includes specific recommendations to solve
specific problems. The Hazards Committee has
done an excellent job in surveying the campus,
and the report, we feel, makes sense.
The committee points out that a few gallons
of white paint spread down the cfenter of both
Palm Drive and Embarcadero would help elim
inate the danger of head-on collisions. An af
iernoon's work with pruning shears would in

crease visibility for cars entering and leaving
the Toyon parking lot. A few bicycle racks
placed in strategic positions around Quad
would remove unnecessary obstacles from the
path of hurrying students.
We think these suggestions are good and
should be carried out. Perhaps in eliminating
hazards some of the "natural beauty" of Stan
ford would also be eliminated. A shrub-less
parking lot isn't as attractive as one rimmed
with green. And white lines destroy the "coun
try road" atmosphere.
But safety should be the top consideration.
We hope the President's office will accept and
act on these recommendations for safety.
