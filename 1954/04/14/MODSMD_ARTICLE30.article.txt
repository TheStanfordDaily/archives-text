# CAMPUS OPINION
## In Favor of Macanovic 
### 
To the Editor:
Although we do not represent the Foreign Scholar
ship Committee, and do not claim to express their
reasons for selecting Petar Macanovic from Yugo
slavia as one of next year's foreign scholars, we
would like to reply to David Workman's letter of
April 7 and 12 in which he questioned the value of
this selection.
After categorically stating that Mr. Macanovic is
a Communist, for no other reason than the fact that
fie is a Yugoslav, the writer dogmatically asserted
that the scholarship would be a waste of good money,
except for a small bit of intellectual stimulation
which we might receive.
We admit the possibility of Macanovic's commu
nistic status, as well as the increased difficulty he
might have expressing himself honestly in his own
country. But in a democracy we do not hang people
for their opinions, and we do not deny them the
chance to have and express those opinions, for only
through free discussion is the majority opinion
reached. Any limitation on that discussion is a be
trayal of the underlying democratic principles of
free speech and opinion. If we have any faith in our
principles we must believe that Macanovic will profit
through contact with true democracy. Those who
insist that he would be squelched upon his return
behind the iron curtain deny the history of the

human race, and fail to remember our own revolu
tionary forefathers who risked death standing against
tyranny. It is a denial of the true human spirit.
This free discussion, we believe, is the way to
freedom; it is not through prison camps, investigating
committees, or global war. At some time, before it is
too late, we are going to have to practice democratic
methods to come to some understanding with the
rest of the world. If democracy cannot bring us to
some understanding, let's abandon it for something
that can. But we have faith in our way of life. And
what better way to show others our life than to in
vite their student leaders, those who will soon be
national leaders, to our institutions and our country?
To be too penny-pinching to allow a small bit of
understanding between the two hostile camps of the
world strikes us as absurd, especially in view of the
billions each camp is spending every day to perfect
weapons to blow each other up. Indeed, in such an
age, we almost believe that any money not spent di
rectly for better understanding between the East and
West is a waste. We would like to see other behind
the-iron-curtain scholars invited here. And we are
totally in favor of the committee's selection of Mr.
Macanovic as the scholarship recipient for next year.
