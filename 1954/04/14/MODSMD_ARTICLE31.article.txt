THE BEST OF THE REST: SEQUEL
(Note: Today, as we did once before, we turn over
this space to some intellects, past and present, who
shed the following light on life in general. In short,
here is the best of the rest):

Certainly America needs a
watchdog to be on guard against
internal subversion. But if our
watchdog bites the postman, the
preacher, the teacher, the Sec
retary of Army, and the Presi
dent—and soundly sleeps as real
Communists move out the grand
piano, you'd trade him ofT for a
better watchdog.
—Senator Mike Monroney
I realize that as far as holding

the United Nations conference in your home town is
concerned, Senator, that your home town is 100 per
cent American. But I think you have to realize that
the United Nations is 100 per cent all nationalities.
And, besides, wouldn't the Ethiopian delegation mind
sitting in the back seats of the busies?
—Bill Mauldin cartoon
You have no move right to consume happiness
without producing it than to consume wealth with
out producing it.
—George Bernard Shaw
I think I could turn and live with animals, they
are so placid and self-contained.
-Wall Whitman
Christianity taught men that love is worth more
than intelligence.
—J acq in- Maritain
If you pick up a starving dog and make him pros
perous, he will not bite you. That is the principal dif
ference between a dog and a man.
Mark Twain
Candy

—Ogden Nash
Those fiiends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel.
—William Shakespeare

My way of joking is lo tell the truth. It's the I
funniest joke in the world.
—George Bernard Shaw
There is so much good in the worst of us,
And so much bad in the best of us,
That it hardly becomes any of us
To talk about the rest of us.
—Anonymous
We don't have television in my home town yet.
We're still trying to get something good on radio.
—Herb Shriner
Have you had a kindness shown?
Pass it on;
'Twas not given for thee alone,
Pas.sit on;
Let it travel down the years,
Let it wipe another's tears,
Till in heaven the deed appears
Pass it on.
—Henry Burton
The most pleasing argument for admitting Alaska
to the Union is that, it would make Texas the second
biggest state.

piano, you'd trade him ofT for a
better watchdog.
