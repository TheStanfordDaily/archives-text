# Frosh Cindermen Lose
## 
### 
The Mt. San Antonio JC trackmen
defeated the Stanford frosh squad
by the score of 75-66 in yesterday's
meet. Mt. San Antonio showed its
strength in the track events, placing
two runners in each event except
the twd-mile, in which the frosh
placed first and third.
The outstanding mark of the meet
was made by San Antonio's Terry
Silbaugh in the 880 event with the
time of 1:57:9. Kay Coyle, the San
Antonio wonder who scored 1:56.2
in the last meet, didn't run the 880
due to a sore throat.
The 100 - yard dash was the
thriller of the meet when all the
runners ended up in a close heat.
Henry Carter of San Antonio won
in the time of :10.3 and Burnie
Nelson of Stanford placed second
with almost the same time.
The pole vault event proved to be
different in that there was a four
way tie for second place, two Stan
ford men and two San Antonio men.
The San Antonio trackmen have
one of the strongest JC squads in
Southern California. San Antonio
coach Elmer fcodge predicts that
San Antonio will break the JC mile
relay record as his team has already
scored a time of 3:19.6 in a previous
meet. Coach Lodge is a Stanford
graduate.
Coach Ray Dean is bringing the
Stanford frosh squad along in good
shape. In the field events the frosh
score most of the points. The frosh
also looked good in the track events,
meeting very stiff competition in
Mt. San Antonio.
