"SAFETY" DOORS NEEDED —
Students pour forth from Engi
neering Corner (above), one of
Ihc danger spots cited hy the Haz
ards Committee. These doors,
similar to those at History Cor
ner, are difficult to open and easy
to jam. The committc has recom
mended that new "safety" doors
be installed—the type which may
easily he opened by pressing
against a metal bar on the inside.
The full report of the committee's
study of campus hazards has been
given to the President's office for
further study.

APPROACHING DANGER — A
single car (right) nears the curve
«»n Emharcadcro, another "danger
spot" marked hy the Hazards
Cominittce. The committee has
found that most cars swing wide

on the turn, and "near-misses" arc
a common occurrence. To help
remove this danger the committee
suggests a white line painted
down the center to prevent cars
"hogging" the road.


MAN VS. MACHlNE—Apparently oblivious to ail around them, jaywalking students cross di
rectly in front of oncoming traffic. .Such a scene is typical on campus, where drivers must con
stantly be alert for unconcerned persons who seem to consider the roads an extension of Quad.
Pedestrians have their complaints too—aimed at those drivers who exceed the 20-mile-an-hour
speed limit.



WILL lIE STOP?—If he doesn't,
it won't be unusual, for the Toy
on-Stern intersection at Escon
<l iH«» and Arguello (above) is one
of the most dangerous spots on
campus. Although there arc ar
terial signs at all four corners,
most cars merely slow down, then
zoom through. The Hazards Com
mittee, which studied the prob
lem of traffic law enforcement, has
suggested that a more careful
watch be kept of this intersection
to catch any careless drivers.


VISION ALMOST ZERO — This
picture (right), taken from behind
the wheel of a car leaving the

Toyon parking lot, shows how ap
proaching traffic is almost hidden
by shrubbery.
