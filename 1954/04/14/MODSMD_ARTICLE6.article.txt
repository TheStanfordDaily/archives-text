# IFC Creates Scholarship
## 
### 
Otis Winters, new Interfraternity
Council president, announced last
night that the fraternities will cre
ate a $720 scholarship fund for
foreign students next year.
The fund will be used to aid those
foreign students who are paying
their own way through Stanford. It
will not be available to the ASSU
foreign scholars who are partially
supported by individual fraternities.
The scholarship will be adminis
tered by a special committee of
IFC members and a representative
from the administration.
Each fraternity will contribute $30
per year to the fund.
The new scholarship will replace
the present Tarvcr exchange schol
arship which will end this year. The
Tarvcr program, which has been
administered in co-operation with
the University of London, has be
come too costly to the fraternities
because the British government se
verely limits the amount of money
the exchange student from Great
Britain may take out of the country.
