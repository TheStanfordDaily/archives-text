# Security Risk Probe Ordered by Wilson
## Slugging Jungle War In Indochina Follows On Ike's Bar Of Oppenheimer 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 14 (UP)
—Secretary of Defense Charles
E. Wilson said today he had or
dered a thorough check on De
partment military and civilian
personnel to determine if any
possible security risks have ac
cess to military secrets.
lie made the announcement as a
special security hoard moved swiftly
hut secretly to determine, perhaps
in two weeks, if Dr. J. Robert Op
penheimer, America's leading atom
ic physicist, is a security risk.
Wilson told a news conference he
knew of no other scientists of Op
penheimer's prominence deprived of
access to secrets. But he said the
Department is "going over every
thing in the present security regula
tions for civilians and military peo
ple as well."
The special Atomic Energy Com
mission board, which began its for
mal investigation Monday, speeded
its work in an apparent effort to
head of! an implied threat by Sen.
Joseph R. McCarthy (R., Wis.) that
he is preparing to throw himself into
the inquiry.
McCarthy said in Phoenix, Ariz.,
Tuesday that he has affidavits to
prove Oppenheimer "had been a
Communist party member." The
noted scientist—sometimes called
"Mr. Atom"—has denied that he
ever was a Red and asserted lie is
a loyal American.
Wilson said, "I have the great
est sympathy for anyone who
made a mistake and reformed, but
I think they ought to be reformed
somewhere else than in the mili
tary services."
He apparently referred to the fact
that, Oppenheimer served as a con
sultant to the Defense Department's
Research and Development Board
before it was abolished last July as
part of a Department reorganization
plan.
The disclosure that President Ei
senhower had stripped Oppenheimer
of further access to A-bomb and
11-bomb secrets shocked the Capitol
as much as any other event in re
'cent history.
The Atomic Energy Commission
said Ihe President took his action
because of "substantial derogatory
information" supplied by the Jus
tice Department. Most of the 1(5 al
legations against Oppenheimer had
been investigated before and found
without basis.
Members of the special three-man
AEC Security Board, headed by
fJordon Gray, former Army Secre
tary and now President of the Uni
versity of North Carolina, would not
discuss the progress of the inquiry.
The board Ls charged with deter
mining whether Oppenheimer's sus
pension as an AEC adviser and con
sultant should be made permanent
or whether he should be cleared. If
denounced as a security risk, he
could appeal to the AEC's Person
nel Security Review Board.

made a mistake and reformed, but
I think they ought to be reformed
somewhere else than in the mili
tary services."
He apparently referred to the fact
that, Oppenheimer served as a con
sultant to the Defense Department's
Research and Development Board
before it was abolished last July as
part of a Department reorganization
plan.
The disclosure that President Ei
senhower had stripped Oppenheimer
of further access to A-bomb and
11-bomb secrets shocked the Capitol
as much as any other event in re
'cent history.
The Atomic Energy Commission
said Ihe President took his action
because of "substantial derogatory
information" supplied by the Jus
tice Department. Most of the 1(5 al
legations against Oppenheimer had
been investigated before and found
without basis.
Members of the special three-man
AEC Security Board, headed by
fJordon Gray, former Army Secre
tary and now President of the Uni
versity of North Carolina, would not
discuss the progress of the inquiry.
The board Ls charged with deter
mining whether Oppenheimer's sus
pension as an AEC adviser and con
sultant should be made permanent
or whether he should be cleared. If
denounced as a security risk, he
could appeal to the AEC's Person
nel Security Review Board.
