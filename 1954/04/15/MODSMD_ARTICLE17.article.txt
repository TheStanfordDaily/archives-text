# 'Economy Move'
## 
### 
Economy - minded Congressmen, with one
eye on a balanced budget and the other on
November elections and lower taxes, have
found a new way to slash expenses. The House
has cut $6,000,000 off the budget requested by
the educational exchange program to operate
during 1955. The watered-down appropriations
bill—now totaling only $9,000,000 —has been
sent to the Senate for approval.
The Senate Appropriations Committee is
now weighing the measure, which will drasti
cally affect the whole foreign student exchange
program. Unless the Senate restores the cuts,
many features of the exchange program will
be completely dropped and others seriously
crippled.
What would happen if the present measures
were passed?
Educational exchanges in 46 countries, in
cluding Egypt, Turkey, Korea, Iran, Formosa,
Spain, Indonesia, and all the South American
republics, would be eliminated.
The teacher - exchange program, aimed at
reaching the youth of the free world, would
be terminated.
The "leader program" in the 70 countries
now reached by the educational exchange
service would be abandoned. Under this pro
gram, leaders of thought and attitude in for
eign countries study in the United States, then
return to present their conclusions on America.
Assistance for private educational exchange
programs would be stopped.
Small grants-in-aid to American sponsored

schools in Latin America, highly useful in fur
thering American foreign policy, would be cut
off. At the present time these schools are lo
cated in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia,
Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic,
Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico,
Nicaragua, Peru, and El Salvador.
On the local level, Stanford foreign student
adviser Werner Warmbrunn has said the bill
would eliminate students who plan to come
here in 1955 under the Schmidt-Mundt plan,
the bill which originally set up government
grants for foreign students.
Fulbright scholars would be restricted to 21
countries, and there would be no provision for
meeting their expenses in this country.
To us this proposed "economy move" is ab
surd. When billion-dollar defense budgets are
bandied about in a mighty effort to prevent
war, is $15 million to promote peace through
education too much? We hardly think so.
In an age when history could be written as
a series of international misunderstandings
punctuated by H-bomb blasts, should we cut
off one of the most successful goodwill pro
grams we have? We hardly think so.
Perhaps it is too much to expect that Con
gress can resist hacking at the budget from all
angles in an election year. Wo hope it isn't
too much to expect-that they will restrict their
pruning to programs less vital to their future—
and ours than the educational exchange serv
ice.

Nicaragua, Peru, and El Salvador.
On the local level, Stanford foreign student
adviser Werner Warmbrunn has said the bill
would eliminate students who plan to come
here in 1955 under the Schmidt-Mundt plan,
the bill which originally set up government
grants for foreign students.
Fulbright scholars would be restricted to 21
countries, and there would be no provision for
meeting their expenses in this country.
To us this proposed "economy move" is ab
surd. When billion-dollar defense budgets are
bandied about in a mighty effort to prevent
war, is $15 million to promote peace through
education too much? We hardly think so.
In an age when history could be written as
a series of international misunderstandings
punctuated by H-bomb blasts, should we cut
off one of the most successful goodwill pro
grams we have? We hardly think so.
Perhaps it is too much to expect that Con
gress can resist hacking at the budget from all
angles in an election year. Wo hope it isn't
too much to expect-that they will restrict their
pruning to programs less vital to their future—
and ours than the educational exchange serv
ice.
Economy - minded Congressmen, with one
eye on a balanced budget and the other on
November elections and lower taxes, have
found a new way to slash expenses. The House
has cut $6,000,000 off the budget requested by
the educational exchange program to operate
during 1955. The watered-down appropriations
bill—now totaling only $9,000,000 —has been
sent to the Senate for approval.
The Senate Appropriations Committee is
now weighing the measure, which will drasti
cally affect the whole foreign student exchange
program. Unless the Senate restores the cuts,
many features of the exchange program will
be completely dropped and others seriously
crippled.
What would happen if the present measures
were passed?
Educational exchanges in 46 countries, in
cluding Egypt, Turkey, Korea, Iran, Formosa,
Spain, Indonesia, and all the South American
republics, would be eliminated.
The teacher - exchange program, aimed at
reaching the youth of the free world, would
be terminated.
The "leader program" in the 70 countries
now reached by the educational exchange
service would be abandoned. Under this pro
gram, leaders of thought and attitude in for
eign countries study in the United States, then
return to present their conclusions on America.
Assistance for private educational exchange
programs would be stopped.
Small grants-in-aid to American sponsored

schools in Latin America, highly useful in fur
thering American foreign policy, would be cut
off. At the present time these schools are lo
cated in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia,
Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic,
Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico,
Nicaragua, Peru, and El Salvador.
