## 'Something New' 
### 
To the Editor:
It is unfortunate that the selection nf Mr. Macano
vic for a foreign scholarship should ever have been
called into question. Although the appointment seems
to me to need no defense, that given by Mr. Hiebert
and others in Wednesday's letter to the editor is, in
all respects but one admirable.
Such statements as "we have faith in our way of
life. And what better way to show others our way of
life than to invite their student leaders" etc. seems to
me to involve an assumption that "our way of life" is
the best possible, for us and hence for any other
country in the wo-li, regardless of its stage of de
velopment or cultural background. It presents a dan
gerous restrictfon to the possibility of the evolution
of an even better "way of life.' In government, for
example, the constitutional father; deliberately left.

the way open for the evolution of a better govern
mental system than they were able to think of at
that time, and the great changes since made in their
system attest to their wisdom. The moment we be
come so insecure that we try to preserve our "way of
life" as it is now, we are indeed in dangerous straits.
As Wednesday';- letter intimated, to gain
as much throu.ch allowing Iron-curtain scholars to
come here as do the Iron curtain countries them
selves. It is through the juxtaposition of ideas that
new and better ideas are born. To use a simple ex
ample, no chemi i would think of bringing sodium
and chlorine together with the hope of changing the
sodium into chlorine; he wants something new, sodi
um chloride, containing both elements, but different
from and more stable than either single element.
