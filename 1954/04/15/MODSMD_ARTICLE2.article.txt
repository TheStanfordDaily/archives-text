HANOI, Indochina, April 14 (UP)
—Black-clad Communist comman
dos blew up runways today in a hit
and-run raid on besieged Dien Bien
Phu's airstrip.
The commandos, covered by a
shattering artillery barrage, in pre
dawn darkness slipped between
mine fields and barbed wire entan
glements to the northern end of the
airstrip, the French high command
said.
The Reds blew up the heavy steel
mat runways with home-made Ban
galore torpedoes of hollow bamboo
poles packed with explosives. The
object, was to destroy enough steel
mats so that the airstrip could not
be repaired and used by French
supply planes bringing badly needed

The damage to the airstrip will
prevent even French hospital planes
from landing. Hundreds of French
