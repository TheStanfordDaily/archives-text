# Federal Excise Tax Cut Will Benefit Stanford

The director has a number of facts
to back up his claim that the tax
had been absorbed. "Our ticket
prices have, in the main, stayed the
same during the last few decades,
when everything else was increasing
in price," he said.
He cited the price of Big Game
tickets as an example. "In 1923,
general admission tickets cost $5,
without a tax. Last season they
were the same price except with a
tax." That means, of course, that
of the normal $5 paid, one dollar of
it goes for taxes.
"Tickets to the California track
meet in 1!(24 cost $1.50 each. To
day they are the same price, ex
cept we have had to turn over ISO
cents of it to the government."
According to Masters, there defi
nitely will be no price reduction in
either Big Game tickets or spring
sport ducats. There may be a re
duction in ticket prices to other
football games, but it will be small.
What will the money go for? "We
have a large renovation project in
the Stadium coming up," the Ath
letic Director said, "and most of it
will go toward that."
Over a short period of time all the
bleacher seats and floorboards in the
Stadium must be replaced, at an
estimated total cost of $750,000. The
Stadium is now over 20 years old,
which was the estimated original life
expectancy of the wood.
The project will begin soon with
the four center rooting section seats
being completely replaced. The cost
of this will be $52,000, or almost all
of the amount saved by the tax re
duction.
Under the new tax bill, the mo
tion picture tax is reduced from 15
to It) per cent. However, on tickets
under 50 cents, such as the flicks, it
is eliminated entirely.
Capacity for a single film is 1,700
customers, or a revenue of $340.

This would mean a saving of $04 per
night. Most of the films do not draw
a full house, however, and accord
ing to Student Manager John Stahr
teh total savings in a year will prob
ably be about $1,500.
The University will benefit in a
numfc>er of other ways from the bill,
such as reduced telephone rates.
However, none of these savings are
substantial.

were the same price except with a
tax." That means, of course, that
of the normal $5 paid, one dollar of
it goes for taxes.
"Tickets to the California track
meet in 1!(24 cost $1.50 each. To
day they are the same price, ex
cept we have had to turn over ISO
cents of it to the government."
According to Masters, there defi
nitely will be no price reduction in
either Big Game tickets or spring
sport ducats. There may be a re
duction in ticket prices to other
football games, but it will be small.
What will the money go for? "We
have a large renovation project in
the Stadium coming up," the Ath
letic Director said, "and most of it
will go toward that."
Over a short period of time all the
bleacher seats and floorboards in the
Stadium must be replaced, at an
estimated total cost of $750,000. The
Stadium is now over 20 years old,
which was the estimated original life
expectancy of the wood.
The project will begin soon with
the four center rooting section seats
being completely replaced. The cost
of this will be $52,000, or almost all
of the amount saved by the tax re
duction.
Under the new tax bill, the mo
tion picture tax is reduced from 15
to It) per cent. However, on tickets
under 50 cents, such as the flicks, it
is eliminated entirely.
Capacity for a single film is 1,700
customers, or a revenue of $340.

This would mean a saving of $04 per
night. Most of the films do not draw
a full house, however, and accord
ing to Student Manager John Stahr
teh total savings in a year will prob
ably be about $1,500.
The University will benefit in a
numfc>er of other ways from the bill,
such as reduced telephone rates.
However, none of these savings are
substantial.
