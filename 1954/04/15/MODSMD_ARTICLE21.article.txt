President Eisenhower recent
ly signed a bill which cut fed
eral excise taxes by one billion
dollars. 0
Stanford will benefit by this
cut in a number of ways. The
two major savings for the Uni
versity are in football ticket
sales and Sunday night movie
tickets.
The largest single tax cut was an
elimination of the 20 per cent excise
on tickets to college athletic events
during the regular season. Accord
ing to Stanford Athletic Director A 1
Masters, this will save his depart
ment an estimated $70,000 in the
next fiscal year.
According to Masters' estimated
budget, the Athletic Department
will have a revenue of $381,000 that
will be subject to the cut. This ex
cludes quite a bit of the depart
ment's income, including Rose Bowl
receipts (the income of which is now
divided among all conference
schools regardless of which team
goes to the Bowl), radio and tele
vision receipts, profits from the
Stanford golf course, and several
other items.
Will this saving be passed along to
fans? Probably not, according to
Masters. That tax has been absorbed
by the department in recent years,
and the cut will simply restore the
old income.
