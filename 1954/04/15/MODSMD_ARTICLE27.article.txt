The Stanford frosh horsehiders I
yesterday squeaked by with a 3-2
win over a strong Capuehino High
squad with Bob Fletcher driving in
the winning run in the last half of j
the eighth.
Ray Loonoy, the Stanford starting [
hurler, did an outstanding job as he
pitched the whole game while al
lowing only four hits, striking out
ten, and walking two. He also had
a two for four record in the Stan
ford hit column..
The game was tied up at the end
of the scheduled seven innings so
an extra eighth inning was neces
sary. With the game still tied up at
the end of the eighth, second base
man Bob Fletcher made the star
ring play of the day with a triple
to drive in the winning run.
Fletcher also got one run and had
two for three in the hit department.
Third baseman Hal Messner also
aided the Stanford cause with two
hits in four trips while driving in i
the other run. Spring quarter frosh j
Rudy Figueroa, who is showing up |
very well, also got a triple.
Capuehino High, which is at pres- |
ent the leading contender for the !
PAL championship, looked very I
good today and as the score indi-I
cates did not give up the winning
run without a strong fight the whole
way through.
