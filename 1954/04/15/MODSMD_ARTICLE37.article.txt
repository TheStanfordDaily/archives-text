# Frosh Cindermen Face PAL Stars
## 
### 
Ray Dean's frosh cindermen face
rough opposition this afternoon at
Angel I Field as they meet the high
school Peninsula Athletic League
All-Stars at 3:30.
The PAL squad, reportedly 'the
strongest in recent years, could give
the tired frosh a real run for their
money. This will be the third meet
for the frosh in the space of a week.
Stanford's ace half - miler Ford
Sims' should have little trouble
breezing home in the 880. The
Compton flash has not yet reached
his peak form, but still will be
well ahead of the field.
In the high jump Stanford's Phil
Fehlen gains the nod over Burlin
game jumper Don Hibson, repre
senting PAL. Fehlen has regularly
been clearing 6 feet.
Frank Hermann in the broad jump
and Jack Groat in the 100 and 220
seem sure to rack up three firsts
for the frosh.
