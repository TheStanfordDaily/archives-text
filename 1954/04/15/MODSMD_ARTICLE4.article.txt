# Stanford Nine Will Host Santa Clara Squad Today
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Stanford's varsity baseballers re
turn to league action this afternoon
as they host a hard-hitting Santa
Clara nine. Starting time for the

*amo on the Sunken Diamond Ls I
3:15.
The Cards drew a CIBA bye last
week end, playing a pair of prac
tice games. They are playing the
Broncos today instead of Good Fri
day, and will travel to Santa Clara's
Washington Park on Saturday for
the second game of the series.
Coach Everett Dean has nominat
ed sophomore Ray Young to start
on the hill for the Indians. Phil
Pago is scheduled to hurl Satur
day's contest. Santa Clara Coach
Chuck Bedolla hasn't said who will
hurl for the visitors, but Don Cole,
Dick Sirnoni, and Ray Stanley arc
the three most likely candidates to
start the two games.
Thus far the Broncos have not
had a particularly successful season.
However, Coach Dean, who scouted
Santa Clara in their Saturday
doublcheader ag ft in s t California,
said yesterday, "They have a good
team, are leading the league in hit
ting (.283), have the two leading
hitters in the league (Bill Carroll
and Gus Suhr), have good speed,
and if their pitching materializes
could beat any team in the confer
ence."
The Bronco CIBA record is 1-4,
but the one victory was a resound
ing 20-3 one over the Bears in a
seven-inning game.
The Santa Clara catching situa
tion, which was the principal down
fall of the Broncos last season, has
improved, but according to observ
ers is still the team's weak link. In
one game their catcher had three
passed balls registered against him,
and stolen bases have been abun
dant even by traditionally slow
teams.
The speedy Stanford runners, who
already have stolen 21 bases this
year, may capitalize on this weak
ness today.
Under the confusing two-league
sy: tern now in effect, Stanford can
Cain this week end in CIBA play
but. not in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence Southern Division. $anta Clara
is excluded from the PCC, and this
is what, counts in determining who
plays oil against the Northern Di
vision champion In determine which
team travels to Omaha for the NC
AA playoffs.
