# SEES POSSIBILITY OF 'ANOTHER KOREA'
## English Author Says Moroccan Unrest Peril to Africa 
### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
Rom Landau, English writer and
authority on North Africa and the
Moslem world, in a short talk here
yesterday outlined the scope of po
litical unrest in Morocco and else
where in North Africa.
Speaking before a small group in
the Women's Clubhouse, Landau
said that if an uprising should flare
in Morocco it would spread quickly
across all of North Africa.

"If things go on as they have
for the past two or three years,"
he stressed, "we may be faced
with a repetition of Korea or In
dochina."
He emphasized that the powerful
coalition of Moslem nations, repre
senting some seven or eight hundred
million people, looks on the Moroc
can issue as a "test case" in their
relations with the West. "Morocco
may become either a bridge or a

gulf between the Eust and West,"
Landau stated.
He explained that Moroccans, in
dependent for 1,200 years before
they became a French protectorate
in 1912, have been striving for their
political autonomy ever since. Last
year a coup by the French deposed
Morocco's spiritual and political
leader, the Sultan, and brought un
rest there to the danger point.
"The French government," he
went on, might do anything in Mo
rocco as long as they did not touch
the Moslem religious beliefs." The
deposition of the revered leader, he
claimed, "has provoked a passion
throughout the whole Moslem
world. Now they have turned away

from us in despair."
"Two years ago," he went on, "the
Moslems were violently anti-Com
munist," but they are now willing
to turn to Russia if it will help them
to fulfill their political hopes.
He explained that Moroccan hopes
for independence had been stifled
in the U.N. also. In 1953 the Mo
roccan question was placed second
on the U.N. agenda. It was sup
ported by the countries of the Far
East and by the Scandinavian coun
tries, but did not receive the neces
sary two - thirds majority, chiefly
because of Western opposition, Lan
dau said.
