## 
### 
Anyone who heard a rooster
crow in Inner Quad yesterday af
ternoon wasn't suffering from a
spring hallucination. A rooster
was there—two of them, in fact,
along with one slightly bedrag
gled hen. The ruffled trio spent

(he afternoon nibbling on downs
and sauntering back and forth
from sunlight to shade.
A quiek cheek revealed that
Alpha Kappa Lambda pledges had
unleashed <24 chickens in their
house early Tuesday morning.
Whether or not these three belong
in the AKf- chicken coop is not
definitely known.
At the moment they are still
peeking and chicking in Inner
Quad. Anyone needing a mascot
or an extra drumstick for Master j
dinner is welcome to try to corral
them.
And here's a hint: the hen is ;
easier to catch than the roosters.
