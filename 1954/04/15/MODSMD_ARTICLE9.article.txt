## EXCOM VOIDS FIVE OFFICES-- BY-LAWS CHANGES ORDERED 
### WIN GRIFFITH, Editor, The Daily WALT WILLIAMS, Associate Editor 
The Executive Committee invalidated five of yesterday's elec
tions and altered several election by-laws last night before ac
cepting the report of Election Board Chairman Larry Tarlow.
The invalidations and by-law changes came after Excom re
ceived reports from its own members, candidates, and other stu
dents that improper procedures in voting were allowed in several
elections.
After hearing a protest that some seniors had not been allowed
to vote for student body president, Excom passed a by-law change
permitting five presidential candidates to run off in the final elec
tion, April 22. The previous ruling had allowed for only four
run off candidates.
The five presidential candidates qualifying for the final elec
tions next Thursday are Pete Bing, A 1 Brouse, Guy Shoup, Len
Stroud, and Rudy Reich.
The elections which were invalidated by Excom were:
Village, Men's Halls, Off-Campus, and graduate representatives
to Excom and Men's Council.
The four elections for representatives to Excom were invali
dated after protests were lodged that some graduate students
had not been able to vote according to their residences. Later in
the meeting, Chairman Don Lozabnick clarified the election rules
by stating that graduate students were qualified to vote for resi
dence representatives to Excom.

The Men's Council race was in
validated after one of the candi
dates, Don Patman, protested late in
the meeting that he heard reports
that some seniors had not been al
lowed votes in that election. Excom
reversed a previous decision of ap- •
proval and voted invalidation of the
Men's Council race.
Another by-law change was ap
proved after Tarlow reported that
the senior vice-president election
ended in a tic between the two can
didates, Virginia Castagnola and Pat
Carroll. The committee passed a
change which will allow for two
vice-presidents for the senior class
next year.
The race for sophomore class sec
retary was held over until the final
election, but did not receive an "in
validation" ruling. After debate on
the status of write-in candidate Pat
Siler, Excom interpreted the elec
tion with the following ruling:
"That this election be taken to
qualify the write-in candidate as a
bona-fide candidate in the final elec
tion." Miss Siler, Pat Schulzc, and
Connie Scully will run in the final
election.
The following elections, decided in
yesterday's voting, were approved
by Excom:
Senior class president, Bill Clem
ans; senior class secretary, Sue
Jones; junior class secretary, Jo
Davis; Women's Row representative
to Excom, Carol Gevurtz; Women's
Halls representative, Roberta Clark;
Union Units representative, Jody
Brown; Women's Council, Clara Van
Sicklc, Ann Franks, and Colleen
Baker.
The following candidates ad
vanced to the final elections after
Excom's approval of the election re
sults:
Al Loom is, Ron Wagner, Tim
Moore, Spike Lynch, junior class
president; Jon Cosovich, Bill Allen,
Davr Jenks, and Tom Thayer, soph
omore class president; Sam Palmer,
Bob Rutherford, Jack Ray, and J.
Philip Gay, Men's Row representa
tive to Excom.
Excom spent more than two hours
discussing the rules arid procedures
used in yesterday's elections before
completing action on the election re
sults.
And before moving on to other
business, the committee passed twb
motions suggesting Excom partici
pation, in the clarification and exe
cution of election rules. Both were
presented by Bob Misbtell, Men's
Halls representative.
The first, provided for a special
committee which will work to clar
! if.v" election rules and procedures.
1 The committee, according to the mo
tion, will bo composed of three
members each from this and nc/t
year's Executive Committee and the
chairmen of this and nejet year's
| Election Board. The group will re
! turn a report with a "codification"
of election rules before the end of
the quarter.
The second motion provides that
each polling place in next week's
final election will be attended by a
! member of the Executive Gommit
j tee, who will act as an "inspector"
' of the voting.
