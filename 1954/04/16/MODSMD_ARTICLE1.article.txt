# ASSU Primary Election Irregularities Explained
## 
### 
(Ed. note: The following is a summary of Wednesday's election situ
ation as discussed in the Executive Committee meeting of that night and
reports received by The Daily.)
On Wednesday night, Excom invalidated five elections and
ordered by-law changes to approve two others after hearing pro
tests that irregularities had occurred in the voting.

The outstanding protests acted on
by Excom involved the voting rights
of graduate students and seniors.
It was reported to members that
some of the election polls had de
nied the right of graduate students
to vote for the residence representa
tives to Excom.
On this basis, the election of off
campus, Village, and Men's Halls
Excom representatives were invali
dated.
Other protests lodged indicated
that some of the workers at the polls
had not permitted seniors to vote
for any office except residence rep
resentative to Excom.
On that basis, Excom voted a by
laws change permitting Rudy Reich
to qualify as a fifth candidate for
ASSU president in the final election
next Thursday. Reich had trailed by
five votes the other four presiden
tial candidates who, by the previous
by-laws, qualified for the finals.
The election of Men's Council
members was protested early in the
meeting on the same grounds—that
some seniors had not been allowed
to vote for that office, but Excom
voted approval after expressing the
view that "it probably didn't affect
the results."
But later in the evening, Men's
Council candidate Don PatmSn
lodged a second protest on the same
ground, and Excom reversed its pre
vious decision and invalidated that
election.
The Women's Council election re
sults were approved without ques
tion. Today, however, The Daily
learned that some senior women had
not been allowed to vote for candi
dates in that race.
The election of graduate student
representative to Excom was invali
dated after Election Board reported
to the Executive Committee that an
unspecified number of ballots for
that office had been voided illegally
by the Board.
Another election, the race for
sophomore class secretary, was taken
by Excom as being a "qualification
of a write-in candidate as a bona
fide candidate in the finals." That
election had originally been set as' a
final, but was carried over to the
finals when it appeared that there
had been a policy mix-up on the
status of write-in candidates.
During the meeting, several other
irregularities were mentioned by
members of Excom and students at
tending the meeting.
They included:
The anouncement by Eli Reinhart,
election board member, that he had
found loose ballots blowing down the
Street near the Post Office election
poll. Some of the ballots, he said,
were blank and others had been
marked.
A statement by graduate repre
sentative Dave Gibb that he had
overheard a poll worker recommend
a candidate to a student who was
voting.
And today, The Daily heard from
various students that these other ir
regularities had occured in the
voting: •
Some seniors had been allowed to
vote for senior clas officers. (Illegal
acording to election by-laws.)
One polling place was closed at
noon, with approximately 40 stu
dents being turned away. (Campus
polls were supposed to remain open
from 0 to 3.)
Blank ballots were seen scattered
in the area around the polling place
at the Village.
