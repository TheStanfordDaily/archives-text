"Should students be allowed to take
examinations outside the class?"
The committee has emphasized
that it wants these discussions to
be the last step in efforts to estab
lish a permanent interpretation of
the Code.
"And we want this to be a con
structive step, with constructive
suggestions from the students," said
Miss Bobis.
The program, as outlined by the
committee, includes the following

which will be held at the regular
living group meetings between next

chairmen, follwing the living group
discussions on the Code. The chair

meetings.
3. The committee will compile the
information in the reports and the
questionnaires and prepare an over
all report, including possible recom
mendations, for the Executive Com
mittee.
4. The report, the committe hopes,
will be completed in time for pres
entation to Excom at its May 5
meeting.
The discussions themselves have
been organized to offer:
1. A history of the Honor Code.
2. The committee's individual in
terpretation of the Honor Code.
3. A period during which students
may discuss that interpretation, of
fer their own suggestions, and fill
out the questionnaire.
Meetings to orient the discussion

to be followed have already been
held.
At those meetings, committee
members have stated the essential
goal of the program as follows:
"A campus-wide program of dis

terpretation of the Honor Code as
it is stated in the constitution, thus
to prepare ourselves more com
pletely to solve the practical prob
lems of procedure."

procedure to be followed in the
discussions.
According to Miss Bobis, the com
mittee has intended that the pro
gram will enable the Executive
Committee to take specific action
on questions of Honor Code inter
pretation, including a ruling on
"Should students be allowed to take
examinations outside the class?"
The committee has emphasized
that it wants these discussions to
be the last step in efforts to estab
lish a permanent interpretation of
the Code.
"And we want this to be a con
structive step, with constructive
suggestions from the students," said
Miss Bobis.
The program, as outlined by the
committee, includes the following
steps:
1. The discussions themselves,
which will be held at the regular
living group meetings between next
Monday and the following Monday.
Most of the discussions will be con
ducted at next Monday's house
meetings.
2. A meeting of the discussion
chairmen, follwing the living group
discussions on the Code. The chair
men will report back to the central
committee with their own reports
and questionnaires which will be
filled out by each student at the
meetings.
3. The committee will compile the
information in the reports and the
questionnaires and prepare an over
all report, including possible recom
mendations, for the Executive Com
mittee.
4. The report, the committe hopes,
will be completed in time for pres
entation to Excom at its May 5
meeting.
The discussions themselves have
been organized to offer:
1. A history of the Honor Code.
2. The committee's individual in
terpretation of the Honor Code.
3. A period during which students
may discuss that interpretation, of
fer their own suggestions, and fill
out the questionnaire.
Meetings to orient the discussion
chairman on the information which
will be offered and the procedures
to be followed have already been
held.
At those meetings, committee
members have stated the essential
goal of the program as follows:
"A campus-wide program of dis
cussions to develop a possible col
lective agreement on the basic in
terpretation of the Honor Code as
it is stated in the constitution, thus
to prepare ourselves more com
pletely to solve the practical prob
lems of procedure."
Jeanie Bobis, chairman of a
special ASSU Honor Code Com
mittee, has announced that a
discussion program "designed
for student interpretation of the
Code" will begin next Monday.
The committee, established by Ex
com after last fall's controversy over
Honor Code "plans," has been work
ing for more than eight weeks on
arrangements for the program.
Those arrangements provide for
special discussions on the Code to
be conducted at the regular meet
ings of campus living groups. They
will be led by members of the
groups specifically chosen and in
structed by the committee on the
procedure to be followed in the
discussions.
