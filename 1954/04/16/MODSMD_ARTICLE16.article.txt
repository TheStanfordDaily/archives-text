# Card Baseballers Win Over Santa Clara, 4-2

Sophomore righthander Ray
Young pitched and batted his
teammates to a 4-2 victory over
Santa Clara yesterday in a tense
baseball game played on the
Sunken Diamond.
The win increased the league lead
of the Cards, who travel to Santa
Clara's Washington Park tomorrow
for the second game of the series.
They do not play this afternoon.
It was Young's ball game all the
way, as he scored the winning run
on a 450-foot drive to right center.
Both the runs scored off his pitch
ing were unearned. He scattered
nine hits well, and only one Bronco
besides the two that scored reached
third base.
The game was close all the way.
The visitors scored their two runs
in, the third inning, and the Cards
retaliated with one score in the 1; st
of that frame. They did not tic the
game until the sixth, and then
scored one marker each in the sev
enth and eighth innings.
Both pitchers started off the game
by being hit freely, but were not
as obliging to opposing batters with
runs. The scoreless tie was broken
on an infield error, a fielder's choice,
a hit batter, and a double to left by
Bronco center fielder Bill Carroll.
Carroll before this game led the
league in hitting with a .524 mark,
and the double was his second hit
in four times at bat in yesterday's
contest.
Stanford scored quickly though,
as second baseman Rich Scramagh.i
walked and stole second, the third
stolen base in as many innings for
the Cards. He then scored as short
stop Warren Goodrich singled.
The score was tied in the sixth
inning when third sacker Tom Dan
durand singled, advanced to second
on an infield out, and crossed the
plate on a hit by left fielder Bob
Evans.
Young put his team ahead to stay
in the following frame with one
away. He smashed a long hit that
went between the right and center
fielders and rolled for the wall. The
center fielder bobbled the ball when
he finally reached it, allowing
Young to score. He was credited
with a triple.
An insurance run was added in
the eighth on a double by Dandu
rand and a single by Swartz.
Young in the game continued the
control type of pitching that both
he and the other Card pitchers have
done this year. He walked only one
batter, and that was in the ninth in
ning with no one on base. He struck
out six Broncos. When he hit an
opponent with a pitched ball in the
third, it was the first hit-by-pitcher
to be registered by a Stanford hurl
er in 16 games. The Card mound
staff has yet to throw a wild pitch.
Reliability is another advantage
the mound staff has shown this sea
son. In 16 games not one hurler has
had to be removed in the middle of
an inning for lack of control.
Santa Clara is a member of the
CIBA league, but not of the Pacific
Coast Conference Southern Division.
Stanford leads Cal and USC in both,
however, with 5-1 and 4-1 records
for the Cards. The PCC
championship is probably the more
important of the two, for the win
ner of that has the right to play the
winner of the Northern Division. In
this series the NCAA representative
from this district to the Omaha na
tional championships is decided.
For this reason the game tomor
row will not be much more impor
tant to the Cards than the outcome
of the Cal - USC series. If USC
should sweep those two games Stan
ford will be given a PCC lead that
will be difficult to overcome. The
Cards would need only to split all
remaining series to take the cham
pionship.
Lefty Phil Page is scheduled to
start on the hill tomorrow against
the Broncos' Dick Simoni. Starting
time at Santa Clara is 2 p.m.

batter, and that was in the ninth in
ning with no one on base. He struck
out six Broncos. When he hit an
opponent with a pitched ball in the
third, it was the first hit-by-pitcher
to be registered by a Stanford hurl
er in 16 games. The Card mound
staff has yet to throw a wild pitch.
Reliability is another advantage
the mound staff has shown this sea
son. In 16 games not one hurler has
had to be removed in the middle of
an inning for lack of control.
Santa Clara is a member of the
CIBA league, but not of the Pacific
Coast Conference Southern Division.
Stanford leads Cal and USC in both,
however, with 5-1 and 4-1 records
for the Cards. The PCC
championship is probably the more
important of the two, for the win
ner of that has the right to play the
winner of the Northern Division. In
this series the NCAA representative
from this district to the Omaha na

For this reason the game tomor
row will not be much more impor

should sweep those two games Stan

Young pitched and batted his
teammates to a 4-2 victory over
Santa Clara yesterday in a tense
baseball game played on the
Sunken Diamond.
The win increased the league lead
of the Cards, who travel to Santa
Clara's Washington Park tomorrow
for the second game of the series.
They do not play this afternoon.
It was Young's ball game all the
way, as he scored the winning run
on a 450-foot drive to right center.
Both the runs scored off his pitch
ing were unearned. He scattered
nine hits well, and only one Bronco
besides the two that scored reached
third base.
The game was close all the way.
The visitors scored their two runs
in, the third inning, and the Cards
retaliated with one score in the 1; st
of that frame. They did not tic the
game until the sixth, and then
scored one marker each in the sev
enth and eighth innings.
Both pitchers started off the game
by being hit freely, but were not
as obliging to opposing batters with
runs. The scoreless tie was broken
on an infield error, a fielder's choice,
a hit batter, and a double to left by
Bronco center fielder Bill Carroll.
Carroll before this game led the
league in hitting with a .524 mark,
and the double was his second hit
in four times at bat in yesterday's
contest.
Stanford scored quickly though,
as second baseman Rich Scramagh.i
walked and stole second, the third
stolen base in as many innings for
the Cards. He then scored as short
stop Warren Goodrich singled.
The score was tied in the sixth
inning when third sacker Tom Dan
durand singled, advanced to second
on an infield out, and crossed the
plate on a hit by left fielder Bob
Evans.
Young put his team ahead to stay
in the following frame with one
away. He smashed a long hit that
went between the right and center
fielders and rolled for the wall. The
center fielder bobbled the ball when
he finally reached it, allowing
Young to score. He was credited
with a triple.
An insurance run was added in
the eighth on a double by Dandu
rand and a single by Swartz.
Young in the game continued the
control type of pitching that both
he and the other Card pitchers have
done this year. He walked only one
batter, and that was in the ninth in
