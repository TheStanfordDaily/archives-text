# Card Trackmen Play Host Role In Open Meet
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
At first glance you might think
that there'll be more athletes than
spectators on hand tomorrow when
Stanford holds open house for track
men in the Stadium.
But, as Coach Jack Weiershauser
says, it's going to be a track men's
track meet. And as a result it will
be a spectator's track meet as well.
Field events will start at 1:3(1 p.m.,
30 minutes before they fire the gun
for the mile.
Stanford's Indians will be there
in force, of course, along with teams
from San Jose State, Fort Ord, San
ta Clara Youth Center, and the
Olympic Club as well as any other
AAU or college amateurs who wish
to enter.
No score will be kept, however,
because the large number of en
trants will require more than one
race in several events. Heats and
finals will not be held, but officials
will try to group the best men (top
eight in the sprints and top seven in
the hurdles) in one race.
A full complement of stars are ex
pected to be on hand. Ex-Stanford
javelin sensation Bud Held, who
holds an unrecognized world record
of 263 ft. 10 in.; Herm Wyatt, the
(i—ft. 9-in. high jumper from the
Youth Center; George Brown of
Fort Ord by way of UCLA and the
U.S. Olympic team in the sprints
and broad jump; George Mattos of
the Youth Center, who has done 14
I't. 4 in. in the pole vault this year,
will be among the visitors.
Stanford big guns will include
hurdler Gerry Wood, sprinter Keith
Brownsberger, Quarter - miler Fred
George, high jumper John Stewart,
javelin throwers Leo Long and Bob
Kimball, shot putter A 1 Cheney, dis
tance runners Bob Reed and Ralph
Love.
Only Indian absentee will be
hurdler Jim Luttrell.
