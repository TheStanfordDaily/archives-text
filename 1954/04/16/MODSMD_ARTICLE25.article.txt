# The 						Meaning of Easter, 1954
## 
### REV. ROBERT M. MINTO Chaplain of Stanford Uiversity 
Do Yor know wli.it Faster means? Do you know why
churches are so crowded for this day? You may he
vague and uncertain ahout the Resurrection; you may not
even helieve it. I hit like many others yon may vet come to
church wondering is it true or just a-minor.
\\ hy not try reading the account of this dav in the New
Testament.
Yon will find one report in the St. I .uke's Gospel Chapter
2-1, the first twelve verses. ()f course this hv itst;lf will not
convince you, so read on ahout the two disappointed men
for whom all was finished with the Crucifixion. For them
Jesus had failed ; the good life and the nohle teaching had heen
in vain. They had heard ahout the Resurrection, hut put no
trust in the rumor that had reached them. Such things don't
happen. They were in retreat to their old way of life. -They
had heard about the Fmpty I omh, hut found it no persuasive
evidence. I he\ were even skeptical of the testimony of their
f

friends, and were unmoved, despondent v prohahlv somewhat
hitter.

What changed them from douht and unbelief to faith and
confidence? An encounter did it. They met Jesus as tliev
walked an ordinary road ; they were confronted by I lim. They
recognized Mis living presence. Here is the clue to Faster.
It is.no mere historical anniversary, but a fact of human ex
perience constantly repeated and reaffirmed in the lives of
men. Faster is not a commemoration, but a reality of Chris
tian life. There is no proof of the Kessurrection that will
once and for all remove your doubts and difficulties. ()nly
the Fiving Ford can do that. Perhaps von do not vet recog
nize Him. Perhaps you do not even believe 1 hat this is pos
sible. Mill you can begin this Faster to take seriously His
claim on your life and I lis promise of companionship. Then,
instead of the Rumor of the Resurrection vou will hear the
( iood News of the (iospel.
