## Another Hazard 
### 
To the Editor:
I hope that, along with its other safety investiga
tions, the Hazards Committee is looking into u traffic
problem not mentioned in Wednesday's Daily. This
is the one caused by the many-directional How of
traffic where Palm Drive meets the parking oval at
the front of Quad. The four avenues of entrance and
four of exit in thi>: circular pattern present a very

confusing problem, which is complicated by pedes
trian traffic.
1 think it might help to reverse the one-way traffic
around the parking oval. Barring this, a lane should
be marked to legalize and remove uncertainty from
the left-hand passing which occurs, head on, at
the ends of the oval. •
