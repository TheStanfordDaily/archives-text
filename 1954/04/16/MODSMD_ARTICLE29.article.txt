# Memorial Church Choir Is Old Traditional-Group

Its voices filling the Memorial
| Church on Sunday mornings,
: one of the oldest campus organ
! izations, the University Choir,
engages in a very busy program
; throughout the year.
Composed entirely of students, the
59-voice group provides the official
j choral music of the Memorial
; Church.
It has been a tradition at Stanford
I from the time of its founding to
! have a group of students sing for
the church services. When the Me
! niorial Church was built in 1903, this
tradition was strengthened by Mrs.
j Stanford, the primary proponent of
| such a non-denominational church ]
|on the campus. At that time she j
stated that she definitely wanted a
choir composed of student volun
teers, rather than of paid profes
sionals, to sing in church on Sun
days.
Conducted by Harold C. Schmidt
and accompanied by University Or
ganist Herbert B. Nanney, the Uni-
I versity Choir rehearses Tuesday af
j ternoons and Thursday evenings in
j the choir room of the church as
' well as at 10 Sunday mornings in
| the sanctuary. For devoting this
time, each choir member receives
j two units credit. Any student may |
[ belong to choir, and tryouts usually
J come at the beginning of each quar- [
ler.
The choir performs choral works
| of every musical period from the
Renaissance on, but its specialty is
| lGth century motets
Furni'hing anthems for the regu
lar service is only a part of the
choir's work. For Chiist in a s ,
! Founders' Day, and Easter, more
| elaborate programs are prepared. |
This Easter Sunday, at both 9 and !
j J1 a.m., the choir will sing several
anthem : Bach's cantata "Christ Lay
■ in Death's Dark Prison," Hassler's
J "Caritate Domiilo," Vaughn Wil- I
i Hams' "Antophon," and Wulpius' j
| "Now God Be Praised in Heaven
Above."
The Christmas service, which

comes at the end of autumn quar
ter dead week, is made up almost
entirely of choral music.
Last December 9, the choir pre
sented a Christmas program in the
Qurlingame First Presbyterian
Church. Before this, these student:
sang in many campus ceremonies
and celebrations. President Ster
ling's inauguration, the 50th anni
versary of the Memorial Church,
and the Bach Festival are a few of
the more recent of these. In 1950,
choir members formed the back
bone of the chorus which took part
in the Ojai Music Festival.
From time to time recordings
have been made of this group. Three
years ago, the Music Library Re
cordings produced a 33-rpm record
of the choir entitled "Motets" which
has had some use in Music 1 classes.
At the moment a record cut last
November of the Christmas pro
gram is nearing completion.
During the summer, when most
students are home, around 20 to 25
under Mr. Nanney continue the
choir work until fall.
"From the beginning of Christian
ity, praise has always played an
important part in church services,"
said University Chaplain Robert M.
Minto, "and in a large church like
the one here, a choir makes a great
contribution. The standard of cho
ral music here is always commented
upon by many of our visitors. A*-
chaplain, I am indebted to the di
rector and members of the Univer
sity Choir for the inspiring music
they render so well."

"From the beginning of Christian
ity, praise has always played an
important part in church services,"
said University Chaplain Robert M.
Minto, "and in a large church like
the one here, a choir makes a great
contribution. The standard of cho
ral music here is always commented
upon by many of our visitors. A*-
chaplain, I am indebted to the di
rector and members of the Univer
sity Choir for the inspiring music
they render so well."

Composed entirely of students, the

It has been a tradition at Stanford
I from the time of its founding to
! have a group of students sing for
the church services. When the Me
! niorial Church was built in 1903, this
tradition was strengthened by Mrs.
j Stanford, the primary proponent of
| such a non-denominational church ]
|on the campus. At that time she j
stated that she definitely wanted a
choir composed of student volun
teers, rather than of paid profes
sionals, to sing in church on Sun
days.
Conducted by Harold C. Schmidt
and accompanied by University Or
ganist Herbert B. Nanney, the Uni-
I versity Choir rehearses Tuesday af
j ternoons and Thursday evenings in
j the choir room of the church as
' well as at 10 Sunday mornings in
| the sanctuary. For devoting this
time, each choir member receives
j two units credit. Any student may |
[ belong to choir, and tryouts usually
J come at the beginning of each quar- [
ler.
The choir performs choral works
| of every musical period from the
Renaissance on, but its specialty is
| lGth century motets
Furni'hing anthems for the regu
lar service is only a part of the
choir's work. For Chiist in a s ,
! Founders' Day, and Easter, more
| elaborate programs are prepared. |
This Easter Sunday, at both 9 and !
j J1 a.m., the choir will sing several
anthem : Bach's cantata "Christ Lay
■ in Death's Dark Prison," Hassler's
J "Caritate Domiilo," Vaughn Wil- I
i Hams' "Antophon," and Wulpius' j
| "Now God Be Praised in Heaven
Above."
The Christmas service, which

comes at the end of autumn quar
ter dead week, is made up almost
entirely of choral music.
Last December 9, the choir pre
sented a Christmas program in the
Qurlingame First Presbyterian
Church. Before this, these student:
sang in many campus ceremonies
and celebrations. President Ster
ling's inauguration, the 50th anni
versary of the Memorial Church,
and the Bach Festival are a few of
the more recent of these. In 1950,
choir members formed the back
bone of the chorus which took part
in the Ojai Music Festival.
From time to time recordings
have been made of this group. Three
years ago, the Music Library Re
cordings produced a 33-rpm record
of the choir entitled "Motets" which
has had some use in Music 1 classes.
At the moment a record cut last
November of the Christmas pro
gram is nearing completion.
