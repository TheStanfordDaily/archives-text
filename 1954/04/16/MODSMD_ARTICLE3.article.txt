# Reich Withdraws
## 
### 
(Editor's note: Rudy Reich, one
of five candidates for ASSU presi
dent qualified to run in the final
election next Thursday, yesterday
announced his withdrawal from
the race and released the follow
ing statement:)
Although Excom has given me the
opportunity to be a presidential
candidate in the final election, I
feel that it would be fairer to the
student body and to the other can
didates if I withdrew from the race
at this time. However, my name
will still appear on the final ballot
on Thursday since the constitution
prohibits its removal. I would like
to add that whoever is elected will
receive my full support and co-op
eration. I will remain active in stu
dent activities and will strive to
bring your student government
closer to you.
I would like also to express my
deepest gratitude to you who worked
so diligently on my campaign. I am
sure I will never be able to repay
these people for all the work they
have done. May I just say, "Thank
you very much!"
RUDY REICH
