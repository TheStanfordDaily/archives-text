# Molnar Play Sparked By 'Showmanship'
## 
### JULIE ANNE HARRIS 
"The Play's the Tiling," a show
[.that belies its title in its general
I spottiness, was given an effective
\ performance, marked by showman
j ship and smooth direction, Wednes
day night by the Stanford Players.
I Molnar's humor was enhanced, his
tediousness carefully skirted.
Briefly, the play concerns two
i playwrights associated with a young
composer who is engaged to the
prima donna of the operetta upon
which the three have collaborated.
The composer overhears his fiancee
making love to a broken-down ham
actor, is crushed, but the situation
is ingeniously solved by the play
wright, Turai.
Patrick Wymark, as the pleasantly
egotistical Turai, played his role
with most effective charm and
warmth, avoiding the brittle ap
proach.
As Mansky, his collaborator, Ho
mer Bower gave a good but weaker
performance. Gestures were rather
forced and his reactions inflexible,
particularly in the first act.
Wallace Whipple, as the compos
er, did a nice jolj making reasonably
human Molnar's very poorly drawn
character. Joan Conipton, very at
[ tractive as the prima donna, gave a
! good portrayal of the superficial ac
tress â€”vivacious and lively through
out.
She and Henry Bate, as the ham
! actor, who also did a very credible
| job, did much to salvage the "play
within a play" scene, drawing much
laughter from a scene that can be
painfully drawn out.
Directed by F. Cowles Strickland,
the entire cast, including minor
players Joel Rogosin, James BarLon
Douglas Cook, and Ben Etheridge,
gave good, consistent performances.
The show continues through Sat
urday, and April 21 through 24, at
8:U0 p.m. in the Little Theater.
