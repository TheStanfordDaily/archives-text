### CURT HASS 
In a fast-rnovinc; basketball game last night, the Zete I cagers i
smashed the Sigma Chis, 71 42. to take the intramural basketball j
i;ophy for the second consecutive year.
The Zetes 3tarted out fast with Rick Carver and Howie Gilmore |
doing most of the scoring in the first quarter. Trailing by nine

points at the end of the first period,
the Sigma Chis came surging back
under the leadership of Fred Stein
kamp, who was high scorer for the
night wih 21 points. At the end of
the first half the Zetes could only
manage a six-point lead with the

score 28 to 22.
In the third quarter the Zetes, al
though not hitting their lay-ups,
were able to push through 18 points
while the Sigma Chi cagers could
only mesh eight. With the accuracy
of a college ball club the Zetes
pumped in basket after basket, and
the outcome of the game seemed
certain at the start of the final quar
ter.
The scoring for the Zetes was
fairly distributed, with Steve Hor
rell leading his team by meshing 16
points. Rick Carver followed closely
with 15, while Gilmore and Witten
berg each scored 10. Denny Boren
had seven, John Gilmore and Bar
beau four each, and Gary Crosby
five.
Following Steinkamp for the Sig
ma Chis were Stan Smith with 12
arid Joe Miller with eight points.
Scott Jones .'â– nagged a free throw to
round out the scoring.
