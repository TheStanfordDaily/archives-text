# The 						Election

### 
(Editorial)
Earlier in the week, before Wednesday's elections, we
editorialized on the importance of student voting. We urged
every student to vote. We urged each student to vote care
fully and thoughtfully.
The purpose of these words was not to fill up space. We
were sincere when we expressed the hope that our elected
leaders in student government would be representative of
the students. We were aware that the students could not re
spect their government unless that government represented
them.
The votes have been cast and the choices have been made,
but we question now whether or not those votes, taken col
lectively, have received the respect they merit. We question
the "representative" quality of those collective votes.
The election was a mess. The rules concerning elections
were a mess. The system of voting was a mess. The admin
istration of the voting was a mess.
And the result of that mess was chaotic, or, in the words of
several Excom members who heard the results and the pro
tests Wednesday night, "a three-ring circus."
After hearing the protests and reports of the confusion at
the polls, we realize that your vote, and the vote of each stu
dent, could have been one of the votes that was blowing
around the streets near the poll near the Post Office.
Your vote might have been one of the votes that was il
legally voided by the Election Board.
Your vote might have been one of the votes that did not
allow you to vote for the offices for which you were qualified
to make a choice.
Your vote might have been cast for an office for which you
were not qualifed to vote.
In short, your vote could have been one of ihe many votes
which were corrupted by executive haziness and administra
tive inefficiency.
We believe that the examples of confusion at the polls were
extensive enough to justify an invalidation of overy election
held on Wednesday.
Instead, the Executive Committee was the picture of incon
sistency. Invalidations were called for some elections. By
laws changes were ordered for others. And validation was
granted for others. The general effort was to avoid *he over
all irregularities and piece together a few official results.
Respect for the elections, respect for the "elected" leaders
of student government, and respect for student government
itself is not built on pieces. It must rest on a basis of efficient
administration and consistent policy.
That base has not been provided for the elections of the
past two years. We hope that the committee appointed by
Excom to "codify" the rules and procedures for the elections
will be able to build that base.
It is vitally needed.
