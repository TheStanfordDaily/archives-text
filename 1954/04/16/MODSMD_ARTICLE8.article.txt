WASHINGTON, April 15 (UP) â€”
Sen. Joseph P. McCarthy and Roy
M. Cohn today threatened an in
definite delay of the Senate investi
gation of their row with the Army
because of what they considered
premature release of Army charges
against them.
The Army's charges, leveling 29
specific allegations against McCar
thy and Cohn, chief counsel of his
Senate Investigating subcommittee,
were formally made public today
after newspapermen got wind of
them last night and reported ex
cerpts. The charges had been turned
over to the subcommittee.
Cohn, who said he was speaking
at McCarthy's request, immediately
demanded an investigation to de
termine who leaked the Army's bill
of particulars. He said he and Mc-
Carthy would not present their
countercharges against the Army
until the inquiry had been com
pleted.
At' Dallas, Texas, McCarthy said
"somebody" should be cited for con
tempt if it develops that the Army
charges were made public "inten
tionally."
