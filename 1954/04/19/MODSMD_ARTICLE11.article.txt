# Santa Clara Nine Walks To 7-4 Win Over Indians
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Santa Clara's baseballers literally walked away to a victory
Saturday over the league-leading Stanford nine when erratic Card
pitchers gave up seven consecutive bases on balls.
Final score of the game was 7-4. Stanford was leading by a 4-0
count when the wildness started in the fourth inning, tying the

score. An infield error following the
walks scored two more runs to put I
the Broncos in the lead.
The loss at Washington Park gave
the Indians a split with Santa
Clara in the two-game series. They I
had downed the visitors at the j
Sunken Diamond on Thursday, 4-2. 1
The contest was played under a
blazing sun that handicapped both
teams. The heat may well have i
been the cause of the wildness of
the Card pitchers, who - so far this
season had been anything hut. er
ratic.
For the first three and a half in
nings, Stanford outclassed its op
ponents. They scored two runs in
the first inning on a walk and a 355-
foot home run over the left field
wall by second baseman Rich Scra
maglia.
In the second frame, Stanford
scored another tally on an error, a
walk, and two sharp singles. The
fourth score came two innings later
on two walks and two singles. In
both instances Stanford was retired
with the bases loaded and the third
and fourth hitters in the lineup at
hat.
At this point, Stanford had tallied
four runs, might well have had sev
eral more, and it looked like the In
dians were about to walk away with
the game. Then it happened.
Bill Carroll walked on six pitches.
Ted Welp walked on four pitches.
Gus Su.hr walked on five pitches. !
Dan Modcna and Dean Ro"binson
walked on five pitches each to force
two runs across the plate. On all
the aforementioned pitches, only one
was swung at by Santa Clara bat
ters.
Stanford pitcher Phil Page was
lifted in favor of Don DcLong, who
passerl two more opponents to tie
the score. Coach Everett Dean then
asked him also to leave, substituting !
Mike Acker. Coming into the game
with the bases loaded and still no
one out, he fared much better. A
| hard ground ball that was ruled an
i infield error scored two more run
i nets, though, and that decided the
contest. The Broncos had scored six
| runs on no hits.
The Broncos added a clinching
tally in the fifth when Welp, who
had singled, advanced to third on
! infield outs and then stole home.
The Card batting power also
i wilted in the heat, after the fourth
I inning. Sid Hall's double in the
' eighth was the only base blow after
' the fourth. Twelve Stanford batters
were struck out.
The loss gave the Indians a CIBA
record of 5 wins and 2 losses. To
morrow they are scheduled to play
the San Jose Red Sox, and next Sat
urday they play California here. No
came is scheduled for Friday.
