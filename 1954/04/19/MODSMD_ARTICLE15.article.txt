## IFC Grants Some Deke Privileges 
### 
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity,
which was suspended for five quar
ters last June for violating the cam
pus drinking ban, has been restored
rushing and initiation privileges by
the Interfraternity Council.
The unanimous action was taken
in response to a petition submitted
by the Dekes, the IFC announced.
However, this decision is subject to
approval by President Sterling.
Otis Winters, newly elected IFC
president, said that the privileges
were granted so that the Dekes may
strengthen their financial position
before they return to the campus in
the fall.
Without permission to rush, tiie
house would have been forced to
open in the fall with only 13 mem
bers. The Deke petition explained
that the house could not operate
economically under such conditions
because fraternity financing is set
up on the basis of about 35 paying
house bills.
The Dekes asked to be allowed to
initiate because six of the 13 who
will ;-oturn next year are pledges
and because two other pledges are
seniors and would otherwise grad
uate without, being activated.
In their letter to the IFC, the
Dekes said their members had made
a fine record during the period of
ing suspension, leading all othei
fraternities scholastically autumn
quarter with a 2.7fi grade-point av
erage.
The IFC turned down the Dekes
request that, they be allowed lo en
ter mural competition.
