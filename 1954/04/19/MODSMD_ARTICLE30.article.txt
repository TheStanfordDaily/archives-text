# Political Awareness
## 
### 
In one year the Political Union has gone far
in creating campus interest in political theories
and issues, but, like any other newly-conceived
organization, it still has far to go before it lives
up to expectancy.
The Union has brought before the campus
such a public figure as Governor Knight, and
has scheduled State Controller Robert Kirk
wood to speak on May 5. It has taken advan
tage of Stanford's own facilities by providing
faculty speakers who can air facts and opinions
on the subjects with which they are most famil
iar.
These opportunities have been offered, but
student apathy has hindered their results.
When posed questions about the Political
Union, many students do not even seem to be
aware of its existence. It appears to them just
another organization which occasionally of
fers a speaker to an intererested student group.
It stands to reason, though, that the Political
Union cannot expect to reach its goals without
an aroused student interest.
Possibly Stanford has already witnessed a
spurt ahead of political awareness and interest.
Governor Knight declared in his Political
Union talk last Monday that when he attended

Stanford over 30 years ago, a figure such as he
could never have attracted the size audience
that then appeared before him. Yet many stu
dents were astonished to find such a meager
crowd present to hear the Governor.
If the past has brought forth such a growth
in interest without the existence of an organ
ized political incentive, possibly we can expect
more phenomenal growth in the future.
