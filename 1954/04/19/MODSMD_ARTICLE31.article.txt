# Frosh Edition
## 
### 
Today's issue of The Daily is the annual
"Fresh Edition," produced and directed by the
freshman members of the staff.
Its purpose is twofold — to give the frosh
some practical experience in the publication
process of The Daily and to honor them for the
work they have done during the year.
They have earned that honor. And we hope
that their experience in putting out today's
Daily will serve them in the years to come —
when they, as future editors, are responsible
for every edition of The Daily.
