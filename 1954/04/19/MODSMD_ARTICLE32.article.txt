# Honor Code Discussions
## 
### 
Discussions on the Honor Code begin tonight
in many of the campus residences, and stu
dents will be asked to express their opinions
and interpretations of the Code.
The action of the discussion chairmen, in
their reports back to Excom, depends entirely
on the responses of YOU. It is Stanford's
Honor Code, and it is to be interpreted the way
Stanford sees it.
Although Excom passes the final decision,
the campus discussions are expected to for
mulate the interpretation of the Honor Code.
An understanding of the Code on the part of
each student is necessary for a true and impar

*
tial covering of student opinion.
The controversy of the issue has tended to
take a back position in many students' minds
since it hit its peak last fall during the Excom
discussions. Nevertheless, the importance of
the issue is still as pressing and vital to every
one. It is not merely a question of taking exams
from the room, but it is a question of the whole
underlying principle of the Code.
Honest, forthright, and well thought-out an
swers to the committee's question are expected
of everyone if a true cross-section of campus
opinion is to be obtained.
