# CAMPUS OPINION
## Knight and Political Union 
### 
To the Editor:
The visit of the Governor of the State to the
meeting of the Political Union held last Monday
demonstrated two things—the need for such an or
ganization on the campus and the nature of the
difficulties which the Union must overcome if it is
to survive. .
Tlie generosity of Governor Knight in consenting
to address the Union, his demonstration of the art
of political speaking, his courtesy to questioners even
when they were completely out of order—all thess
could have been harnessed for the good of the or
ganization, and the meeting might have been the
turning point in its previously sickly existence, had
the students had any notion of what the Political
Union is supposed to be.

Following the opening speech we had a stream of
almost unrelated questions, serving no purpose other
than the pounding of the pet peeves of those con
cerned, whether or not these had anything to do
with the motion in hand. The Governor was in part
responsible for this state of affairs when he took
control of the meeting from the chairman.
But while we must make allowances for the per
sonality of the speaker, it must be understood that
there are certain limits to the extent to which the
platform provided by the Union may be used for
the speaker's private purposes. For if no control is
exercised in this direction, the Union will be de
stroyed in the turbulence of that type of factional
political activity which neither the administration nor
the students desire. TOM MAXWELL
