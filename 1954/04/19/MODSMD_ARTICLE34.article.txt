I. THE PLEDGE REVOLUTION
A new class came into being about the middle of
January. They were called the Pledges, and it was
evident that they were destined to become an im
portant factor in shaping the history of the Frater
nities and Eating Clubs. Certain non-
Thc era of conformists around the campus who had
revolution become learned in Stanford history could
recall past years when similar classes of
the "lowly" plebeians had appeared under circum
stances unusually close in comparison to the present.
However, the ruling party on campus, known as the

Roughs, regarded these non-con
formists as "turkeys" and their
ideas as farces. Therefore, it
came to pass that the size, power,
and influence of the new class
began to grow slowly but surely,
and it became unified and inde
pendent.
As the Pledges became strong
er, however, the aristocracy
(commonly called the Actives)
became more and more intolerant

and began to force the plebeians into such menial
duties as Saturday Work Days. Soon the ideas of
revolution began to secretly pass among the new
class. They began to become indig-
The causes of nant about the authoritative attitude
revolution of the Actives. Also they were driven
on by the temptations of the many
trophies, paddles, and other desirable souvenirs which
were being hoarded by the aristocracy. Soon out of
the midst of the Pledges came one Marl Carx whose
famous cry resounded from the Cactus Gardens to
Rossotti's: "Pledges of the campus, arise! Throw off
your shackles! You have nothing to lose but your
education!"

Rumors began to circulate of' subversive plebeian
movements. "Low Blow Joe" McDirty of the campus
Wrecks Com immediately began to investigate, and
was soon given a Communist rating by the nobles.
When reports of organized Pledge Sneaks were con
firmed, the learned non-conformist
turkeys were jubilant in their im- Violent attempts
moral victory. The following ac- at overthrow of
count of one of the more famous the aristocracy
Sneaks was taken from an old dis
carded Greek Diary found at the bottom of Lagunita
after a long drought:
"3 a.m. We met in front of Encina. After check
ing our tools of revolt (200 Ihs. of sand, (iO lbs. of
Hour, 30 lbs. of fertilizer, 3 large feather pillows,
1 large can of molasses, and 24 flea-bitten chick
ens), we left for our objective. 3:08 a.m. Objective
reached. Every rebel went right to work to carry
out bis assigned task. .3:31 a.m. First stage of sneak
accomplished. Sand is now unevenly distributed
throughout the downstairs. The feather pillows
have now been relieved of their contents. The flour
blizzard has left its marks on the walls. Tlie chick
ens are clucking happily on the fertilizer covering
making a peaceful barnyard scene in the living
room."
Even though the revolution was eventually quelled,
the influence of the Pledges was was to remain for
a long time. A newly-formed Wrecks Com that in
cluded duly elected plebeians abol
ished all non-conformist turkeys on Results of the
the campus and started an investiga- revolutiofi
tion of McDirty, while at the same
time they advocated "Law of the Jungle" elections
in favor of the old-fashioned "anyone who has a
student body card can win" type. The most signifi
cant result of the revolution was the discovery of
reactionary, flea-bitten chickens in the middle of that
great middle-age fortress, the Quad. After much de
bate, it was decided to throw them in irons along
with the members of the old Wrecks Com. This
marked the beginning of the famous "Rain of Ter
rible Alcohol."

recall past years when similar classes of
the "lowly" plebeians had appeared under circum

However, the ruling party on campus, known as the

Roughs, regarded these non-con
formists as "turkeys" and their
ideas as farces. Therefore, it
came to pass that the size, power,
and influence of the new class
began to grow slowly but surely,
and it became unified and inde
pendent.
As the Pledges became strong
er, however, the aristocracy
(commonly called the Actives)
became more and more intolerant

The causes of nant about the authoritative attitude
revolution of the Actives. Also they were driven
on by the temptations of the many
trophies, paddles, and other desirable souvenirs which
were being hoarded by the aristocracy. Soon out of
the midst of the Pledges came one Marl Carx whose
famous cry resounded from the Cactus Gardens to
Rossotti's: "Pledges of the campus, arise! Throw off
your shackles! You have nothing to lose but your
education!"

Rumors began to circulate of' subversive plebeian
movements. "Low Blow Joe" McDirty of the campus
Wrecks Com immediately began to investigate, and
was soon given a Communist rating by the nobles.
When reports of organized Pledge Sneaks were con

turkeys were jubilant in their im- Violent attempts

Sneaks was taken from an old dis
carded Greek Diary found at the bottom of Lagunita
after a long drought:
"3 a.m. We met in front of Encina. After check
ing our tools of revolt (200 Ihs. of sand, (iO lbs. of
Hour, 30 lbs. of fertilizer, 3 large feather pillows,
1 large can of molasses, and 24 flea-bitten chick
ens), we left for our objective. 3:08 a.m. Objective
reached. Every rebel went right to work to carry
out bis assigned task. .3:31 a.m. First stage of sneak
accomplished. Sand is now unevenly distributed
throughout the downstairs. The feather pillows
have now been relieved of their contents. The flour
blizzard has left its marks on the walls. Tlie chick
ens are clucking happily on the fertilizer covering
making a peaceful barnyard scene in the living
room."
Even though the revolution was eventually quelled,
the influence of the Pledges was was to remain for
a long time. A newly-formed Wrecks Com that in
cluded duly elected plebeians abol
ished all non-conformist turkeys on Results of the
the campus and started an investiga- revolutiofi
tion of McDirty, while at the same
time they advocated "Law of the Jungle" elections
in favor of the old-fashioned "anyone who has a
student body card can win" type. The most signifi

reactionary, flea-bitten chickens in the middle of that
great middle-age fortress, the Quad. After much de

with the members of the old Wrecks Com. This
marked the beginning of the famous "Rain of Ter
