# Encina, Roble: Echoes of the Past
## Letter Describes 'Brand-New' Halls 
### MARY ELLEN ROMNEY 
In a turn-of-the-century London
newspaper, a picture of Eneina Hall
appeared, labeled "Stanford Univer
sity." Mistaking the dormitory for
the University was considered a I
joke at the time, but today, more
than a half - century later, Encina
and its younger sister Roble might I
well be considered the cradles of
Leland Stanford Junior University.
When Stanford first opened her
doors to students in autumn of 1891,
the class of '95 moved into two large,
unfinished dormitories: Encina and
Roble. The buildings were named
after two varieties of California oak,
and held respectively almost the en
tire male and female population of
the University. Professors and stu
dents lived side by side, and every
one from both dorms was fed in the
Encina dining room. The food? One
Stanford freshman wrote his moth
er, "We have beans everywhere,
boiled and baked, and three times a
day. We have cold beef and mutton
and more mutton and beef that isn't
supposed to be cold; lots of all right
milk; dried fruit, stewed or inside
heavy lids; there are two kinds of
pudding, alternating. One is a kind
of wet cake, peppered with dried
currants, the other we call 'tomb
stone pudding'; it's a slab of blanc
mange floating in a rosy hair oil."
A rally was held during the first
year in the Encina lobby, protesting
the food. The following yell was
adopted at the rally:
"Rub, rub, rub,
We want grub,
'95, '95,
Rub, rub, rub."
Despite similarities, many things
were not like current freshman con
ditions. The letter writer quoted
above describes his room: "There is
a Bible on the table in each room in
the hall. The whole place smells

very clean and varnishy. It is
brand-new. The floors are bare. . . .
I wish I could have a rug to cover
the middle of the floor. It's cold
mornings going over to the wash
stand."
Electricity did not come till later,
in '92, and then was irregular and
undependable. The installation of
Encina's elevators was postponed
that year, much to the discomljort of
the inhabitants. The cost for these
accommodations was $20 per month.
As for the ladies, they were
housed in a "temporary" Roble,
until the present-day stone building
could be constructed. Ironically,
that temporary building has quite as
long a history as Encina itself. Built
in 100 days, it was used by women
students until the new Roble was
completed in 1918. It was then re
named Sequoia Hall, and served as

a men's dormitory until the '30's, al
though seriously damaged in the
1906 earthquake. Now, Sequoia Hall,
minus its top stories, is the home of
the Department of Statistics, and
the applied mathematics and sta
tistics laboratories.
The original Roble
"Angels' Hall." One of its futt oc
cupants describes the lobby this
way: "The parlor is pale blue and
pink, a large, long room. At either
end is a pretty mantel and by each a
pink as well as a blue with
large ribbon bows."
By 1925, the picture had changed
considerably. Encina was converted
into an exclusively freshman dormi
tory, and residence there was re
quired for one year. Excerpts from
Quads of the '20's give a picture of
the growing University: "In the new
Encina dining halls, the freshmen

have been fortunate in having par
ticularly good fare, served in good
taste and in pleasant surroundings.
Encina Hall has become the melting
pot, a crucible in which freshmen
are subjected to new situations and
given the test of Stanford life. , . .
Encina Hall is primarily a reposi
tory for freshmen. The freshmen in
Encina conduct dances and smokers,
in order that the inhabitants of this
strange building may be more close
ly knit into a class."


THE "TEMPORARY" ROBLEâ€”Sequoia Hall, built in 1891 as a temporary women's dormitory,
is pictured as it existed for almost twenty years as a men's housing unit. Now minus its upper
stories but still known as Hall, it Statistics Department.
