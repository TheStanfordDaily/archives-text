# Chuck Van Linge Grabs Golf Title
## 
### CURT HASS 
Stanford's straight hitting Chuck Van Linge defeated San Jose
State freshman Ernie George, three and two, Saturday to take
the championship flight of the Northern California Intercollegiate
Golf Tournament.
Although neither player showed the championship form of

| which he is capable, the match was
close and it had its tense moments.
Van Linge, an ex-Marine, dis
played a case of the jitters on the
first hole when he missed a four
foot putt which would have given
! him a one-up advantage.
Alter winning the third, Van Linge
again blew a short putt, this one
from three feet, and the match was
squared. He also lost the fifth hole
when his short putt rimmed the cup
but failed to drop.
On the sixth, however, he calmly
slammed in a 30 footer, and the
.match was even once again. The next
hole was halved, and on the 140
yard eighth both balls were on the
green in one. Van Linge, with his
putter warming up, dropped in a
putt from 25 feet to win the hole.
Van Linge held a one-up lead at
the end of nine holes. He shot
a .'5B to better George by one
| stroke.
Van Linge took the next three
holes and being four up, he looked
! like a cinch to take the match. How
i ever, George won two of the next
three and was putting pressure on
Van Linge. The second shots of both
players lay close to the green on the
par live sixteenth. Van Linge played
his shot to within seven feet. George,
after hitting a bad third shot, placed
the next one close to the pin. But
Van Linge stepped up and quickly
knocked his ball straight to the cup
for a four and the championship.
In reaching the finals, George
pulled the biggest upset of the
tournament when he downed the
tournament favorite, Fred Brown of
Stanford, one up in the second round.
