## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Stanford's big gun, Jack Frost, came through as expected on the
local court Saturday afternoon, but Cal simply had too many
strong reserves as they walloped the Stanford netters, 6 -3.
This made a clean sv/eep foT the Bear racketmen since the Cub
sguad had already smothered the frosh tennis team, 7-2, in a

morning preliminary. ♦
Frost, a sophomore whose serves |
resemble a Howitzer being fired, ]
breezed past Cal's number one |
man, Herschel Hyde, (i-1 in the
first set. However, in the second
set Hyde rallied and put up a slifT
fi"ht until Frost polished him off
8-0,
Veteran performers Jim Cornish <

in the number four singles match.
Playing the number six spot Duff -
edged out his opponent Bud Mueh
leisen in straight sets 7-5, 7-5.

in the singles matches as Farm play- i
ers Art Fish, Gary Gray, and Henry
Sutcliff all went down to defeat.

6-4 in the number two match;
Norman Petersen stopped Gray
6-4, 6-2: and Ron Woods polished

ford doubles combination, won their i
first set, but were finally put down
by Cal's first tandem composed of
Hyde and Demas, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3.

Duff nad Sutcliff 5-7, 6-3, 6-4. Final

ond set, Axtell double-faulted sev
eral times and was only narrowly
able to pull the set out of the fire
with his backhand as Ahern edged
up. Axtell eventually won, 11-9.

play was Stanford's Bruce Jack
son. A spring quarter frosh playing
bis first Farm match,. Jackson won

Cal, however, split with the Cards
in the singles matches as Farm play- i
ers Art Fish, Gary Gray, and Henry
Sutcliff all went down to defeat.
Bill Demas downed Fish 6-3,
6-4 in the number two match;
Norman Petersen stopped Gray
6-4, 6-2: and Ron Woods polished
off Sutcliff 6-3, 6-0 to make the
match even, Stanford 3, Cal 3.
In the doubles matches Cal came
back with a very strong effort to
capture all three events, thus icing
the match.
Fish and Cornish, a familiar Stan
ford doubles combination, won their i
first set, but were finally put down
by Cal's first tandem composed of
Hyde and Demas, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3.
Frost and Gray also started off well
winning their first set 6-2, but suc
cumbed to Pimley and Woods 8-10,
2-6. Cal wound up the afternoon in
a similar manner. Petersen and
Muehleissen teamed up to route
Duff nad Sutcliff 5-7, 6-3, 6-4. Final
score: Stanford 3, Cal 6.
In the featured frosh match, the
Cubs' Larry Axtell and the frosh's
John Ahern both seemed badly off
form. Axtell took the opening set
6-4. However, in the lengthy sec
ond set, Axtell double-faulted sev
eral times and was only narrowly
able to pull the set out of the fire
with his backhand as Ahern edged
up. Axtell eventually won, 11-9.
One bright spot in the singles
play was Stanford's Bruce Jack
son. A spring quarter frosh playing
bis first Farm match,. Jackson won
with a respectable 6-4, 6-4.
Jon Symon and Northcutt Ely
crushed their doubles opponents 6-2. J
6-0. Final score: Stanford frosh 2. j
Cal frosh 7.
Stanford's big gun, Jack Frost, came through as expected on the
local court Saturday afternoon, but Cal simply had too many
strong reserves as they walloped the Stanford netters, 6 -3.
This made a clean sv/eep foT the Bear racketmen since the Cub
sguad had already smothered the frosh tennis team, 7-2, in a

morning preliminary. ♦
