# Honor Code Talks To Begin Tonight
## 
### 
The ASSU sponsored discussions on the Honor Code, planned
"to get a student interpretation of the Code," will begin tonight
et the regular meetings of most of the campus living groups.
Tonight's discussions will be held at most of the living groups
meeting regularly on Monday night. Other groups will partici-

â–º pate in the discussion program a
week from tonight or at group
meetings scheduled throughout the
week.
The discussions, to be led by rep
resentatives of each living group,
j will include:
1. An explanation by the discus
sion leader on the history of the
Honor Code at Stanford.
2. A clarification of the Code, as
interpreted by the Honor Code
Committee, for possible alterations
and suggestions by the students.
3. A period for additional discus
! sion and the completion of question
. naires prepared by the committee.
The questionnaires and individual
reports by the discussion leaders
will be returned to the Honor Code
Committee next week to be used in
making recommendations to Excom.
The recommendations, which the
committee hopes to present to Ex
com on May 5, will possibly involve
specific interpretations of the Code,
including the question "Should stu
dents be allowed to take examina
tions outside the classroom?"
The committee, appointed by Ex
com after last quarter's controversy
over Honor Code "plans," has 'em
phasized that the program beginning
tonight is to be the last step before
action by Excom.
Committee chairman Jcanie Bobis
announced that the purpose of the
program is to "encourage construc
tive suggestions by the students for
constructive action by Excom."
Members of the special Honor
Code Committee which arranged the
program are:
Miss Bobis, Hal Hansen (chair
man for speakers), Janeenc Knipe,
: Phil Hicks, Cathy Paget, John
I Sprague, Alice Kwong, Ken Mclvin,
j Dick Andrews, Carolyn Henderson,
