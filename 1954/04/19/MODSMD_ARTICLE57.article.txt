### 
Congressman J. Arthur Younger
of San Mateo stated Saturday that
the federal government's Budget
! Bureau has definitely decided
against locating the proposed $23,-
000 Veterans Hospital on Stanford
land.
Younger said that the site south
of campus that was recommended
by the Veterans Administration
along with a dozen other sites in
California was ruled out because it
would be within four miles of an
existing VA hospital in Mcnlo Park.
Both the proposed and existing hos
pitals are mental institutions.
