WASHINGTON, April IK (UP)
Federal Housing Chief Albert M.
Cole said today there is evidence
that a former housing offiical re
ceived payment for "favors" in con
nection with the multi-million-dol
lar scandals uncovered last week.
Cole also said there is evidence of
new wrong-doing in federal hous
ing activities not revealed when he
disclosed abuses last week in the
emergency wartime apartment
housing program and the Federal
Housing Administration's home im
provement program.
Cole declined to elaborate on the
alleged new abuses. Nor would he
identify the ex-oflicial accused of
taking money except to say the
charges include "willful and serious
violation of the law,"
