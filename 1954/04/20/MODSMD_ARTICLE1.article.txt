# Excom Note Protests Foreign Student Cuts
## 
### 
The Executive Committee voted
unanimously last week to sign and
send a letter to California Sena
tors William R. Knowland and
Thomas H. Kuehel and to Vice-
President Richard Nixon protest
ing the proposed cut in the Inter
national Educational Service pro
grams.
This cut would restrict the num
ber of foreign students able to
study at Stanford and other Amer
ican schools. The letter was sug
gested and drawn up by Grant
Spaeth, chairman of the Foreign
Scholarship Committee, who asked
that interested students write sim
ilar letters to their Senators:
The Excom letter reads:
Sir:
We wish to express our concern,

and, we arc sure, that of many
other Stanford students, with re
spect to the action of the House of
Representatives in cutting six mil
lion dollars from the 15 million
dollars requested by the Depart
ment of State to operate the Inter
national Educational Service pro
grams. If this action is sustained
in the Senate it will curtail ex
changes under the Fulbright Act
and virtually eliminate the Sniith-
Mundt program.
Translated into ,our own terms,
this means that both the faculty
and the organized student body,
which has been stimulated to make
substantial contributions to the
total exchange effort, must, for all
practical purposes, "go it alone."
We believe so deeply in the pro

giani that we would undoubtedly
continue on our own, but on a
drastically reduced scale.
The only reason advanced for
the cut is economy. Few, if any,
voices have been raised against the
program on its merits. On the
contrary, countless individuals and
many universities such as ours
have testified by word and deed—
contributions of time and money—
that the exchange of students is a
slow but sure way to the realiza
tion of world community and
world peace.
It is our judgment, that intimate
contact and association with peo
ples from other countries can do
more than anything else to pro
mote the sympathetic understand
ing of the ideals and principles for

which our country stands. Simi
larly, the presence of foreign stu
dents has encouraged the exchange
of ideas, with the consequence that
Americans come to understand
foreign points of view.
The Stanford student body sup
ports the exchange program not
only by words but by action. Dur
ing the past six years, direct finan
cial appropriations by this govern
ing committee, the fraternity and
dormitory provision of room and
board for foreign scholars, have
meant a total .Stanford student
contribution that, nears 75 thou
sand dollars. It is not an exagger
ation to say that government, dol
lars have been multiplied through
the stimulation of our student and
community efforts. If, as we firm

ly believe, there are other univer
sities that have responded as firm
ly as we have, then it is no over
statement to say that the multi
plier impact of the government
expenditure has been terrific.
At this juncture, when the Com
munists are inviting thousands of
persons from all parts of the world
to the Soviet Union, to give up the
exchange program seems extreme
ly short-sighted. In urging that
you support the request of the De
partment of State, we feel that the
great cost to our national interest
of the proposed saving of six mil
lion dollars must be considered.

mote the sympathetic understand
ing of the ideals and principles for

which our country stands. Simi
larly, the presence of foreign stu
dents has encouraged the exchange
of ideas, with the consequence that
Americans come to understand
foreign points of view.
The Stanford student body sup
ports the exchange program not
only by words but by action. Dur
ing the past six years, direct finan
cial appropriations by this govern
ing committee, the fraternity and
dormitory provision of room and
board for foreign scholars, have
meant a total .Stanford student
contribution that, nears 75 thou
sand dollars. It is not an exagger
ation to say that government, dol
lars have been multiplied through
the stimulation of our student and
community efforts. If, as we firm

ly believe, there are other univer
sities that have responded as firm
ly as we have, then it is no over
statement to say that the multi
plier impact of the government
expenditure has been terrific.
At this juncture, when the Com
munists are inviting thousands of
persons from all parts of the world
to the Soviet Union, to give up the
exchange program seems extreme
ly short-sighted. In urging that
you support the request of the De
partment of State, we feel that the
great cost to our national interest
of the proposed saving of six mil
lion dollars must be considered.
Very truly yours,

The Executive Committee voted
unanimously last week to sign and
send a letter to California Sena
tors William R. Knowland and
Thomas H. Kuehel and to Vice-
President Richard Nixon protest
ing the proposed cut in the Inter
national Educational Service pro
grams.
This cut would restrict the num
ber of foreign students able to
study at Stanford and other Amer
ican schools. The letter was sug
gested and drawn up by Grant
Spaeth, chairman of the Foreign
Scholarship Committee, who asked
that interested students write sim
ilar letters to their Senators:
The Excom letter reads:
Sir:
We wish to express our concern,

and, we arc sure, that of many
other Stanford students, with re
spect to the action of the House of
Representatives in cutting six mil
lion dollars from the 15 million
dollars requested by the Depart
ment of State to operate the Inter
national Educational Service pro
grams. If this action is sustained
in the Senate it will curtail ex
changes under the Fulbright Act
and virtually eliminate the Sniith-
Mundt program.
Translated into ,our own terms,
this means that both the faculty
and the organized student body,
which has been stimulated to make
substantial contributions to the
total exchange effort, must, for all
practical purposes, "go it alone."
We believe so deeply in the pro

giani that we would undoubtedly
continue on our own, but on a
drastically reduced scale.
The only reason advanced for
the cut is economy. Few, if any,
voices have been raised against the
program on its merits. On the
contrary, countless individuals and
many universities such as ours
have testified by word and deed—
contributions of time and money—
that the exchange of students is a
slow but sure way to the realiza
tion of world community and
world peace.
It is our judgment, that intimate
contact and association with peo
ples from other countries can do
more than anything else to pro
mote the sympathetic understand
ing of the ideals and principles for

which our country stands. Simi
