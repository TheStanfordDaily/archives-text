# Kirkwood Tells Of Campaigns
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
State Controller Robert C. Kirk
wood, in a speech last night before
a caucus of the Political Union Re
publicans, emphasized the enormity
of the job of campaigning on the
state-wide level.
Kirkwood, who graduated from
Stanford in 1930, addressed the
group informally on "Campaigning
and Its Problems in California."
A candidate, he declared with a
twinkle in his eye, must constantly
be on the go. "Yet," he said, "a good
campaign requires 15 or 20 privates
for every officer in the ranks "
A successful candidate must be
backed by a tremendous number of
supporters ready and willing to do
the dirty jobs. This, he declared, is
the great problem a candidate faces
in enticing campaign workers.
To add to this, he remarked, the
job most important to the candidate
is precinct work. Here again are
involved a tremendous number of
workers.
One great problem facing any po
litical candidate is the fact that his
financial supporters often expect to
have a claim on his actions once he
i.s elected. Such a problem, he la
mented, is not easily avoided since
every candidate must have financial
assistance.
Kirkwood will return to the cam
pus on May 5 to speak before the
Political Union on the subject of
"Liquor, Lobbies, and Taxes."
