### 
HANOI, Indochina, April I') (UP)â€”Communist siege armies to
day split the northern defenses of Dicn Bien Phu, overran one
fourth of the vital airstrip and stabbed to within 700 yards of the
heart of the embattled fortress.

It was the closest the Reds have come to the command post of

Brig. Gen. Christian de Castries in
their month-long siege.
Authorities here made no attempt
to conceal their concern over the
potential seriousness of the situation.
The French command announced
that the second strongpoint on the
northern flank of the bastion's air
field had fallen to the Reds .today.
A French outpost on the northwest
ern perimeter fell into Communist
hands yesterday.
A spokesman said the position was
abandoned because it was cut off
from the main defenses by a net
work of enemy trenches. He said
the airfield now is wide open to at
tack from the north but still is
flanked by French trenches on the
south, east and west.
The Communist Viet Minh forces
now are in a position to launch a
general offensive against the "brain
center" of the fortress's defenses, he
said.
(In France, War Secretary Pierre
-de Chevigne announced that nearly
all the paratroopers in Indochina
already have been dropped into the
battle zone. He disclosed that urgent
reinforcements of the. sky-soldiers
are being rushed from France.)
