WASHINGTON. April in (UP) —
Senate investigators reached tenta
tive agreement today on ground
rules for the McCarthy-Army hear
ings that apparently will give both
sides the right of cross-examination.
Sen. Karl E. Mundt (R , S.D.),
acting chairman of the Senate In
vestigating subcommittee, refused to
give details of the agreement or to
confirm that Sen. Joseph R. McCar
thy (R., Wis.) will take an active
part in the inquiry.
As for McCarthy's role, he said,
"There is nothing this committee
can do by coercion to affect a Sena
tor. It is a matter of negotiation,
of horsetrading. We are trying to
accomplish our aims by persuasion,
discussion, and logic."
But McCarthy, who has insisted
all along that he should question
witnesses even though he has tem
porarily stepped down as chairman,
said his position is unchanged
