# U.S. Leaders Calm Fears Of 'G.I.'s to Indochina'
## Nixon Aired 'Own Views' 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 19 (UP).
Administration leaders said to
day it is "unlikely" American
troops will be needed in Indo
china, and assured Congress
there has been no change in the
policy against sending them
there.
Tlie statements apparently were
aimed at quieting an uproar over
Vice-President Richard M. Nixon's
Friday statement that U.S. troops
might be sent to Indochina if ihe
French pulled outâ€”which Nixon re
garded as an unlikely possibility.
In Augusta, Ga., Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles said after a con
ference with President Eisenhower
he thinks it "unlikely" there is any
serious possibility of sending G.l.'s
to the jungle battlefront.
He said Nixon gave a "personal
opinion" in reply to a "hypotheti
cal question" on an "pfT-the-record
basis." The vice-president, he
added, was "entitled to" do so.
The secretary of state Hew here for
an urgent talk with the President
preparatory to the Geneva confer
ence on the far east. Before he leaves
for Europe tomorrow Dulles will
confer in Washington with congres
sional leaders, including Democrats
who are clamoring for an administra
tion "explanation" of the Nixon
warning.
Dulles also issued a 700-word state
ment declaring that free nations
must plan at once toward "establish
ing a collective defense" against
Communist arms.
At the same time, however, he
said, the Communists in attempting
to break through at Dien Bien Phu
to present the Geneva conference
with a victory have "already lost
more than they could win from a
military standpoint."
"From a political standpoint," Dul
les said, "the defenders of Dien Bien
Phu have dramatized the struggle for
freedom so that the free world sees
more clearly than ever before the
issues that, are at stake and once
again is drawing closer together in
unity of purpose."
Meanwhile Sen. Leverett Salton
stall (R, Mass.), acting Republican
leader, assured the Senate during
sharp debate that there has been "no
change" in the administration policy
against sending U.S. troops to Indo
china. Saltonstall said he was in
formed on that point by Secretary of:
Defense Charles E. Wilson and State
Department officials.
