# Still a Chance

### 
The cancellation of the May blood drive an
nounced yesterday shocked us into reconsider
ing and evaluating our attitudes on blood
drives at Stanford. We concluded that we still
think blood drives ure among the most worth
while projects ever attempted by Staniord. But
the guestion remains why was it necessary to
cancel the May drive?
We understand that the blood drive sched
uled for May had to be cancelled solely be
cause not enough students signed up to justify
the necessary expenditure of time, effort, and
equipment. Here- again irj the perpetual specter
of student apathy.
Several attitudes aie expressed by the indi
vidual to justify his apparent feeling of "Why
should T be expected to give my blood?" The
most commoji of these attitudes is based on the
0
points that no Americans are fighting and
dying now, the Korean front is quiet, so what
do they need my blood for anyway? Another

rationalization is that I gave in the BIG drive
last year, so surely they can't expect me to
donate again.
Can't we understand the need for building
up a supply of blood for emergencies? Can't
we profit by our past experiences and keep
giving, as often as our health allows? (Every
three months is the medical limit.) We insist
on being treated as intelligent adults, yet we
refuse to act so that if there is another disaster,
whether an earthquake, fire, or war emergency,
v/e will be prepared to save lives with blood
our blood.
The least we can do to save our collective
self-respect as Stanford students is to give
freely ol our blood in the blood drive tomorrow
and Thursday, upstairs in the Women's Club
house. Perhaps we can demonstrate that we
deserve to be treated as men and women who
can plan for the future, act realistically on those
plans, and contribute the ounces of prevention
that will be worth more than pounds of cure.
