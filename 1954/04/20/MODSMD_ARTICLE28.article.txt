# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
ON strakjhtmen, elections ANI) excom
bull Session material was getting low last week.
McCarthy hadn't said anything for at least two-and
;i-half hours; nobody's windshields had been pitted
• • i; the bees at the Cellar hadn't slung anybody. It's

true that the AKL pledges had let
loose a (lock of chickens and that
Mike Hudson bad just run out of
gas for the 17th time, but I couldn't
write a whole column about that.
Then I looked at the spring quar
ter calendar.
"Hot dog," I hot dogged, "this
is election day. And whenever 1
need some straight men, Excom
comes through like the New York
Yankees in a World Series or like

Einstein in a Physical Science 1 exam."
I whipped over to th • tufTy Excom room and got
I here just in time to ■ < <■ the Excom members sink into
111 'sr chairs like li;»ii accordions. No sooner had they
done this than Hob Mishell, the fighting crusader of
I he people from the Toy on congressional district,
spoke out:
"I protest. 1 protest. I ay we invalidate Men's Halls
elections."
"Why? why?" cried a voice.
"Because many Crother? men couldn't for
Men's Halls reprc entative."
President Don the 'people': cheree, set up a quick
committee to invt sths.ie and it was discovered that

although they don't come out in the air very much,
there are men living in Crothers.
"Yes," cried Mishell. the spokesman for the under
trodden, "there are men living in Crothers. Besides,
it is a hall. That means that they must be able to vote
for Men's Halls representatives."
A ten minute demonstration followed.
When it was all over, John Stahr, the man who keeps
,the money, got under the table to pick up some loose
AKL chickens, but discovered it was only some dis
enfranchised Crothers men having convulsions.
Mishell got up again: "I say we invalidate the Vil
lage, Off-Campus, and graduate divisions. Some grad
uates weren't allowed to vote, and they are pretty up
set about it."
Someone discovered, upon looking through the
ASSU constitution, that graduates were students also,
and thereby entitled to vote. Another ten minute
demonstration ensued.
The soph class secretary election, which had two
persons on the ballot, was declared "no decision" be
cause a write-in candidate got enough votes to make
sure that no one got a majority. Thus, Excom ruled
that there should be three names on next week's bai
lor This is probably the first time in election history
that there aie more names on the final ballot than
there were on the primary.
Excom ended 182 minutes, 37 pounds of perspira
tion, and five invalidated elections after it had started
And as 1 cay, 1 finally found myself some straight
men.
