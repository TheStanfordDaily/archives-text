# STANFORD RESEARCH INSTITUTE
## SRI Contracts Multiply Business Soars To $6,000,000 Yearly 
### HADLEY ROFF 
Within a seemingly snap-of
the-finger span of time—seven
years to be exact —the Stanford
Research Institute has mush
roomed from a minor research
center into one of major impor
tance, handling intricate con
tracts for the federal govern
ment and private industry that
amount to millions of dollars.
From a quiet beginning in 1947,
the Institute has expanded its busi
ness from an initial $500,000 a- year
to last year's astounding near $(5
million.
Officials of SHI, looking almost
unbelievingly at the skyrocketing
lines on the progress charts, say
they hardly expected the center,
housed in the narrow, hastily con
structed barracks of Stanford Vil
lage, to multiply its annual earnings
: ume 12-fold in such a short period.
They point with pride at the rapid
growth of the Institute, which was
founded on a shoe-string loan from
Stanford University, and which
; iru-t- then has accumulated revenue
totaling $18 million.
And the outlook, these Institute
leaders advise, is for continued
growth arid expansion as industry
more and more turns to science to
probe the problems and promises of
the future.
Last year, the government and
various business firms contracted
the Institute to conduct .'582 differ
ent projects, the range of which
swept:
For industry, from the use of co
conut oil to the economics of the
food refrigeration industry.
For government, l'rom the study of
shock waves from explosions to the
perfection of machinery for war
plane manufacture.
Frequently research undertaken
by the Institute overlaps between
private industry and the govern
ment, as do recently-launched stud
ies into industrial defense. Con
ducted under contracts from the
Civil Defense Administration and
several vital industries, these studies
endeavor to plot the dispersal of
factories away from possible atomic
bomb targets.
Another area where government
and industry join hands is the awe
some field of atomic research.
Though much of the nuclear study
carried on by the SRI behind the
barred windows and .guarded doors
of the atom labs in the Village is
classified "top secret," brief mention
is made in the recently-published
report of the Institute of some re
search into the possible industrial
application of nuclear radiation.
According to the report, the SRI
last year investigated the likelihood
of using radiation for commercial
sterilization and as a means for
locating chemicals in various sub
stances and for improving tracer
techniques.
Ol the projects embarked upon
last year, about one-third were from
the government But the revenue
from this research amounted to al

most one-half the year's total.
The number of projects under
taken in 1953 marks more than a
75 per cent increase over the number
begun two years before, pressing
to the button-bursting point the fa
cilities in the SRl's central labora
tories in the Village.
Such quick growth, according to
Institute administrators, is to con
tinue. And to prepare for it, they are
planning to build soon a huge, ultra
modern center, most likely in the
Village. It will replace the presently
used reconverted barracks.
To carry out its vast research pro
gram, the SRI has a staff of about
700 trained personnel, 200 of whom
were hired last year to care for the
Institute's ballooning business. When
it began its operation, it had a staff
of about 50.
Presiding over this large staff is
director of SRI, Dr. J. E. Hobson.
Organizationally, the Institute is di
vided into three major depart
ments —economics, engineering, and
physical sciences.
Though the greater part of the re
search is done in the Village, the
SRI maintains several branch offices
and laboratories. These are located
in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Mt.
Lee near Los Angeles, Pasadena,
Portland, and Phoenix. The Insti
tute also lias a fleet of mobile labor
atories that were dispatched last
year to conduct special studies in
Nevada, Greenland, Alaska, and
Southern California.
While founded largely on money
borrowed from the University, the
Institute has no direct formal ties
with its collegiate neighbor. How
ever, several University officers do
serve on the board of directors of

SRI. Chairman of the Board is Pres- j
idenl J. E. Wallace Sterling. Serving
with him on the SRI board are Lloyd j
Dinkelspiel, president of the Uni- i
versity's board of trustees, and Pro- j
vost Douglas Whitaker.
Set up as a non-profit corporation, j
the Institute relies to some extent j
on contributions from industry to j
augment the income from contracts. |

in the Institute's Village center, the laboratory was considerably
enlarged during 1953 by the addition of new facilities and per
