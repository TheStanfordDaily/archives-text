Everett Dean's baseballers take a break from the rigors of league
play this afternoon when they host the San Jose Red Sox at 3:15
on the Sunken Diamond.
As a result of their inglorious defeat at the hands of Santa Clara
Saturday the dards find themselves uncomfortably settled in

| first place in the CIBA by a half game
j over USC.
The pesky Trojans rapped Cal in
j a pair of week-end tilts by a repeti-
I tious 12-1 score, lowering the Bears
; to third place. In the Pacific Coast
Conference (the CIBA minus Santa
Clara) Stanford holds a game and a
half bulge over Troy.
Don DeLong (2-1) will start for
| the Indians and is slated to go five.
' Ace Ray Young (5-1) will work two
j to get ready for Saturday's tilt with
Cal, and Phil Page (2-3) will finish
up.
The .To Sox, always a California
State League power and a Boston
Bed Sox farm clul), have cap
tured six out of seven exhibition
tilts, losing their first game Sun
day 0-2 to the Class A Wenatchee
Chiefs.
Manager Red Marion has praised
the fielding work of first sacker
| "Hoot" Gibson and the sure-handed
j shortstop Dick Kraft. There has
| been a lack ot power in the attack
j but left fielder Elmer Daley is rated
i as one of the top stickers on the club.
Either George Storti or Jack Os
! born will go for the visitors. Storti
1 was recently optioned out by Albany
I of the Eastern League and pitched
j with the Jo Sox in 1951 before en
tering the Marines.
CIBA statistics released yester
day revealed that Young was the
leading hurler in the won-lost and
earned run department with three
successive victories and an 0.00
ERA.
Tom Dandurand is the only Indian
i in the top ten batters, ranking ninth
with a .318 average.
Ai Talboy slipped from the top
five to 11th spot with an average of
: .290.
Stanford is third in batting with
J .252 and second in fielding with
.952.
Probable batting order:
San Jose Stanford
Kraft, ss Hall, cl
Turk, 3b Scramaglia, 2b
