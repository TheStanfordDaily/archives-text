# Spring Football Begins May 3

### 
King football in the guise of
spring practice makes its 1954 de
but at Stanford when Head Coach
Chuck Taylor starts in on the first
r'alisthenic May 3.
Taylor, who inaugurates Stan-,
ford's 471h year of football next
fall and his fourth as head man.
has emphasized the necessity of
all players signing up before
Thursday's 4::i<) p.m. deadline.
" Anyone who doesn't sign up by
then won't he eligible to play
football for Stanford," said Tay
lor.
There can't be any leeway on this
policy, asserted the Card coach, be
uau.se of the lack of equipment. Jake
Irwin, top man in equipment cir
cles. will be forced to operate on a
first come first served basis.
Taylor, whose teams have won 20,
lost 10, and tied one, will work his
quad from May 3 to May 29. The
team will practice for an hour and
a half every weekday afternoon, ex
cept Tuesday, and will also engage
in head knocking Saturday morn
ings.
This plan coincides with the
PCC's ruling which limits mem
bers to 20 days of spring practice.
Schools will also be allowed to use
officials at their scrimmages.
Spring practice is a boon to the
working boy. It gives each candi
date a chance to show his abilities
in order to be invited back for the
main show in the fall.
Taylor, who was recently named
to assist Jim Tatum with the Col
lege All-Star team, expects to be
greeted by a strong line.
