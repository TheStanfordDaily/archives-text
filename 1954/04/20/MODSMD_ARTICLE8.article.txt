# Bruno Walter Prepares Chorus For S.F. Symphony Performance
## 
### JOHN McFEE DOROTHY CAMPBELL 
"I am now the oldest of conductors since Toscanini's retirement,
hut music keeps me young," said Bruno Walter while on campus
yesterday to rehearse with the Stanford Chorus.
The 180 members of the chorus rose spontaneously to applaud
one of the world's greatest conductors as he entered Woodpecker

Lodge to lead them in the mighty
chorales of Brahms' "Requiem." This
work will be performed under Walter
by the Chorus along with Bruck
ner's "Te Deum" in the final series
of the San Francisco Symphony sea
son this Thursday, Friday, and Sat
urday.
The white-haired man in a gray
suit talked quietly to the chorus
while making encouraging suggest
ions, and directed them with easy
and simple arm motions. At the end
of the rehearsal, which lasted one
and one-half hours, Walter smiled at
the chorus saying, "Very good! Ex
cellent! Superb! Thank you."
"I believe that this will be the first
time these two choral works have
been coupled in one performance,"
the German - born musician said.
"Both composers are so different
that performing them on the same
program is a marvelous way of com
plementing each other. Besides, what
is more fitting than after singing
'praise to the dead' in the 'Requiem'
to follow with joyous cries of 'Te
Deum'."
Although he is 7ft years old, Walter
still carries on a heavy musical
schedule. In a week he plans to leave
for Europe where he wiil bo guest
conductor of orchestras in London,
Rome, Florence, Milan, and Zurich.
At present Walter is guest conduc
tor of the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra in it.s final two concerts
of the season.
"I have a wide heart for all music,"
Walter went on, "and I love lo per
form works of all composers. As for
specialty, I have none. Who is it.
who can say he loves just Bach or
just Beethoven? A real musician
cannot like just one composer, but
must have a wide musical field."
This week will mark the second
time in three years that Walter has
come here to perform wilh the Stan
ford Chorus.
He will be on campus again to
morrow night at 7 in Woodpecker
Lodge to rehearse Bruckner's "Te
. Deum."
