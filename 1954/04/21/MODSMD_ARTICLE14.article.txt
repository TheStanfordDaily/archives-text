HANOI, Indochina, April 20 (UP)
— United States - supplied Corsair
fighter-bombers were revealed offi
cially today to have bolstered
French air strength for the decisive
battle of Dien Bien Phu.
It also was disclosed that addi
tional volunteers parachuted into
the beleaguered stronghold whose
defenses have been hammered into
an area of less than three-quarters
of a square mile by relentless Com
munist pressure.
Spearheads of the 40,000 - man
Communist armies of Gen. Vo
Ngyuen Giap were within 700 yards
of the heart of the French bastion in
northwestern Indochina, the closest
they have come in their 37-day-long
siege.

French authorities reported that
25 Navy corsairs—the fastest planes
to be put in use in Indochina—were
delivered by the U.S. aircraft car
rier Saipan. .
The Corsairs are believed to be
the same close ground support mod
el which proved highly effective
against the Communist forces in the
Korean war.
At Dien Bien Phu, Brig. Gen.
Christian de Castries tightened his
defense ring for the do-or-die stand
against a third massed Communist
assault. French sources believe the
Red attack will come before the
Geneva conference opens April 27.
Packed within the perimeter were
some 11,000 French Foreign Legion
naires, Moroccans, Senegalese, and
Viet Nam soldiers.
