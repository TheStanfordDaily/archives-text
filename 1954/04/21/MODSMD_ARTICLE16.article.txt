## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 20 (UP).
Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy said
today that Army charges against
him were master-minded by As
sistant Defense Secretary H.
Struve Hensel in an effort to
block an investigation of Hensel
for "misconduct and possible
law violation."
Hensel promptly fired back that
McCarthy was guilty of "lying"
dtid of hitting "the low mark of
cowardly irresponsibility" for at
tacking him under the cloak of Sen
sorial immunity. He challenged Mc-
Carthy to drop his immunity so
Hensel could sue.
The crackling McCarthy-Hensel
exchange came as the Senate Inves
tigating subcommittee voted to give
Army officials and McCarthy and his
aides full rights to cross-examine
witnesses when the televised hear
ings open at 7:30 a.m. (PST) tomor
row.
The "ground rules" adopted for
the explosive inquiry provide that
the principals will have the same
right of cross-examination as the
Senators themselves. This was a vic
tory for McCarthy who had insisted
on cross-examination rights.
McCarthy said he has been in
vestigating Hensel's activities as a
"partner and dominant force" in a
ship supply firm, identified by Hen
sel as Arthur L. Peirson Co. Mc-
Carthy said Hensel "drew large
sums" from the firm while a gov
ernment official.
McCarthy also attacked "Penta
gon politicians" whom he accused of
giving "aid and comfort" to Com
munists by levelling charges against
him. He specifically mentioned
Adams and Army Secretary Robert
T. Stevens, who have accused Mc-
Carthy and Cohn of improperly
seeking favored treatment for Pvt.
G. David Schine, drafted subcom
mittee aide.
