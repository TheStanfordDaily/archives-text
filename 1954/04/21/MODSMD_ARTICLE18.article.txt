# Special Excom Vote Extends Final Election Time to Friday After Grad Student Complaint
## Thursday Poll Time Unchanged; Friday Hours Will Be 9 to 1:30 
### 
The Executive Committee voted in special session last night to
extend the time of the final election to include the hours of 9 to
1:30 on Friday.
The action came after one of the candidates for graduate student
representative to Excom protested that students in the Graduate

School of Business Ho not attend
classes on Thursday and that most
of them are away from campus on
field trips.
David Gibb, graduate representa
time to Excom, estimated that there
would be at least 200 students in
the school who would be unable to
vote at the previously scheduled
hours of 9 to 3:30 on Thursday.
And chairman Don Lozabnick
stated that the number of students
who would not be able to vote
would affect most of the election.,
scheduled for this week, not just the
graduate representative race.
The time of voting for Thursday
will remain the same—9 to 3:30 foi
the booths in front of the Main Libc
and 11:30 to 1:30 for the Village
booth.
On Friday, the location for the
booths will remain the same.
There will be an important
meeting of all poll workers today
at 5 p.m. in the Nitery to explain
voting qualifications and a new
system of vote tallying.
