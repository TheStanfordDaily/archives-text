Tomorrow the Stanford student will make his
final choices for election of the 1954 -55 student
leaders.
We do not presume to say whether or not
there wili be any more examples of voting con
fusion. We do not presume to say whether or
not Stanford students were discouraged from
voting by last weeks election mess.
But we admit that both possibilities exist.
And before the final preparations are com
pleted, before the voting begins, we will make
these suggestions:
1. Thdt every student responsible for the ad

ministration of voting and the tabulation of
votes accept his full responsibility for an effi
cient election. We especially recommend that
each student working on the elections attend
an orientation meeting this afternoon a! 5 in
the Nitery. The purpose of the meeting is to
clarify voting procedures and rules.
2. And that every student at Stanford realize
that the Election Board and student leaders
have attempted to guarantee a "smooth" elec
tion. For a representative student government,
the vote of every student is important. We
again urge each student to vote.
