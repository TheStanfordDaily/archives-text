## On Academic Freedom 
### 
It is refreshing to find an educator on the Stanford
faculty who thinks rationally about the issue of aca
demic freedom. I think that Stanford students will
support wholeheartedly any professor's right to true
academic freedom, so long as that professor does not
attempt to confuse the issue with emotional, irrational
statements about "thought control" and"the right lo
think, speak, and teach objectively."
Professor Thurman of the Law School, speaking at

"College students must be exposed to, and perhaps
buffeted by the winds of freedom that blow through a
tree university . . . the scholar does not have greater
freedom of thought and expression than any other
citizen, . . . nor should fie have."
So long as a professor does not demand greater
freedom of thought and expression than any other
citizen, 1 think that that professor will find the great
majority of Stanford students behind him 100%.
