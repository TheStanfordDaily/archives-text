### JACK BYRNE 
OF TIME ANI) CHANGE
Alfred Lord Tennyson had it, all right, when he
said; "The old order changeth, yielding place to new"
Take a look and you'll see what I mean.
Let me say in advance, I'm going to keep myself
from pulling too many stops and slobberine in mv

root beer about what happened i
to the Good Old Di'ys.
Got into a long conversation j
v/ ith Dan Endsley of the alumni i
mag the other day. He used to be !
a Breaker. I'm a Toro. Breakers j
and Toros reputedly do not get j
along together. Well, that's not the j
whole truth. We manage to eat j
next door to each other, and only j
have minor incidents. An occa
sional border incident or an ex- |

change of water, but that's about the end ol it. Well,
Dan placed his Flonheims on the desk and started to
reminisce about baseball games with a keg of beer
as the stakes, mighty drinking bouts on Wednesday
night, and what not. And, of course, the great fights
the clubs used to have.
Well, it's just as well for my money that things are
a little quieter on the Western Front. We had one
dispute this year in which a fire hose changed hands
several times, and everyone got dripping. Nice in the
summer, but this was way back in January. Brrr.
Even Encina is quieter; I swear it is. I guess Mrs.
Sumner is just as happy that it is calmer in the cam
pus eyesore, but what a time we had in the old place.

Water, the perfect cure for anything wrong with your
friend or roommate. And of course, there's the alum
who comes back and tells you he lived in your room
in ought seven (a bold faced lie; he must have lived
under a rock) and how they used to tub the lads in
those days. But every year the food fights get a little
more infrequent, water bag-per-day figures decline,
and there is currently a rumor that the boys aren't
swearing over there any more. Gee whillikers!!!
But what I really noticed was the Monday morning
paper, produced exclusively by the freshmen on The
Daily staff. In the reputed "Good Old Days," the
frosh would arrive at the Shack, find every table up
side down, the engraving machine stripped, the wire
machine inoperative, and in one corner, all of the
typewriters. But not a ribbon in the bunch.
Sunday morning the Shack was perfectly normal.
All afternoon and evening upperclassmen walked in
and out, peered over shoulders, even helped write
headlines and worked on stories; conduct that would
have been unthinkable a few years back. And the
Frosh still had plenty enough to do putting out a
paper up to The Daily standard: "All the News That
Fits, We Print."
Before too much longer seniors will be treking to
bend the elbow here for the last time, wandering
around with maps a mile long talking about the "Good
Old Days," and generally waxing nostalgic about the
whole thing.
Well, they can spare me this "Good Old Days" g\]ff.
As far as I can see, it'll be some time before things
get any better.
