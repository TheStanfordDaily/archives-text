# Clark's Tales Bring Integrity To Westerns
## 
### JIM MORREY 
Professor Walter VanTilburg
Clark, author of the famous
Western, "The Ox Bow Inci
dent," is assuming Professor
Wallace Stegner's work in the
English Department for the
spring quarter.
Well - tanned and in his forties,
Professor Clark combines horn
| rimmed glasses and clear-cut fea
j tures to give the smooth appearance
j expected of successful authors.
Born in a small cross-roads town
in Maine, Clark says he "has been
writing something or other since 18."
He has received M.A. degrees in
American and English literature
from the Universities of Nevada and
Vermont.
Professor Clark lias written
three hooks, "The Ox Bow Inci
dent," "The City of Trembling
Leaves," and"The Track of (he
Cat."
He has also written many un
published poemsjaml several short
stories which have been combined
into a book.
Clark's life has been a mixture of
high school and college teaching,
I sports and dramatics coaching, and
many summer lecture sessions. He
enjoys tennis and chess, and plays
the violin for his teen-age daughter
and son.
Ilis approach to life is best seen
in his most popular book, "The
Ox How Incident." This first novel
he considers "a deliberate experi
ment" to break the mold of stere
otyped Westerns by taking the
typical Western ingredients and
restoring some of their "legiti
mate values and their greater
sense of responsibility."
The Saturday Review of Litera
ture calls this viewpoint "person
al integrity," a quality which
many modern Western authors
lack.
Today's novels consider human
beings in terms of only themselves,
says Professor Clark. "Other aspects
of life have been eliminated in con
sidering man. The urban environ
ment makes individuals completely
unaware ol nature and its manifes
tations."
"We'll always have Westerns,"
says the writer of one comparable
to "The Covered Wagon" and
"Westward Ho.' "These Westerns
| tend to educate people in terms of
i nature and its beauty."
Soft-spoken Professor Clark is
planning to move to Montana af
ter he completes his stay at Stan
ford. He will teach at the state
university, explore the Montana
hills, and continue writing.
Two novelettes, and one novel are
: now in the making. The subject of
all three is mining camps. When
these are finished Professor Clark
will probably start another Western.

Clark, author of the famous
Western, "The Ox Bow Inci
dent," is assuming Professor
Wallace Stegner's work in the
English Department for the
spring quarter.
Well - tanned and in his forties,
Professor Clark combines horn
| rimmed glasses and clear-cut fea
j tures to give the smooth appearance
j expected of successful authors.
Born in a small cross-roads town
in Maine, Clark says he "has been
writing something or other since 18."
He has received M.A. degrees in
American and English literature
from the Universities of Nevada and
Vermont.
Professor Clark lias written
three hooks, "The Ox Bow Inci
dent," "The City of Trembling
Leaves," and"The Track of (he
Cat."
He has also written many un
published poemsjaml several short
stories which have been combined
into a book.
Clark's life has been a mixture of
high school and college teaching,
I sports and dramatics coaching, and
many summer lecture sessions. He
enjoys tennis and chess, and plays
the violin for his teen-age daughter
and son.
Ilis approach to life is best seen
in his most popular book, "The
Ox How Incident." This first novel
he considers "a deliberate experi
ment" to break the mold of stere
otyped Westerns by taking the
typical Western ingredients and
restoring some of their "legiti
mate values and their greater
sense of responsibility."
The Saturday Review of Litera
ture calls this viewpoint "person
al integrity," a quality which
many modern Western authors
lack.
Today's novels consider human
beings in terms of only themselves,
says Professor Clark. "Other aspects
of life have been eliminated in con
sidering man. The urban environ
ment makes individuals completely
unaware ol nature and its manifes
tations."
"We'll always have Westerns,"
says the writer of one comparable
to "The Covered Wagon" and
"Westward Ho.' "These Westerns
| tend to educate people in terms of
i nature and its beauty."
Soft-spoken Professor Clark is
planning to move to Montana af
ter he completes his stay at Stan
ford. He will teach at the state
university, explore the Montana
hills, and continue writing.
Two novelettes, and one novel are
: now in the making. The subject of
all three is mining camps. When
these are finished Professor Clark
will probably start another Western.
