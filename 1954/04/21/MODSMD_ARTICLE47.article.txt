Wonka made his first appearance

nightgown and bra salesman. Since
then, he has been registered in in
numerable classes, been a write-in
candidate in ASSU elections, ap
peared in subsequent Chappies, and
been in an auto accident.
The last occurred in the fall of
1951, when a group of Stanfordites
bound for Seattle and the Univer

the boys, not wishing to alarm his
parents, gave his name as Warren
G. Wonka, and his place of resi

The story made the news wires,
and without bothering to check the
story, the Watsonville Register-Pa
jaronian ran the story on its front
page.
