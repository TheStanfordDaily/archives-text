# Indian Consul Reports On 'Non-Involvement Policy'
## 
### JAE HUNLEY 
"India is following a policy of non-involvement." said Azim
Husain, India's consul-general at San Francisco, in a talk at Bow
man Alumni House yesterday afternoon.
He stated, "India feels that the future of the world and of India
rests upon understanding and the removal of conflict and tension

from the world. India needs, abso
lutely needs, for the continuance of
a democratic form of government,
world peace and economic co-oper
ation on all parts. Otherwise her
government cannot survive."
Husain stressed the strategic im
portance of India to the United
States. He listed as reasons the
geographical location bordering on
China and oil-rich Eastern nations;

the abundance of atomic material
India exports to the United States;
and the fact that if India should
swing to the Russian powers, the
United States would be hopelessly
outnumbered as far as population
goes.
He went on to say, "India is eco
nomically weak. We have in prog
ress a five-year plan which, after it
is completed in 1956, will bring us to
the standard of living we had in
1939. It is hard for Americans to
understand that an adequate stand
ard of living in India consists of i
enough clothing to last through the
winter, two square meals a day, and
a roof which doesn't leak through
India's monsoon season."
Husain stated that the basic prob
lem of the Indian government is to
provide food, clothing, and shelter
for the large masses of people. He
said, "It is not. necessary to fear that
the country will turn Communistic
due to outside forces, because we
have larger military forces than the
United States. Rather, we must fear
the internal uprising."
fie said that India needed $4 bil
lion in order to prevent such action
on the part, of the people, and that,
they lacked $1 billion of that. He ;
quoted Chester Bowles as saying
that, "A strong and democratic India .
is a greater guarantee of American j
security in strategic terms than any i
amount, of verbal agreement."
Husain mentioned that India was
not following a neutral policy. He
said, "India constantly expresses a
viewpoint and we use as a yardstick
the question, 'Would this or that
course of action promote the cause
of peace?'"

India's monsoon season."
Husain stated that the basic prob
lem of the Indian government is to
provide food, clothing, and shelter
for the large masses of people. He
said, "It is not. necessary to fear that
the country will turn Communistic
due to outside forces, because we
have larger military forces than the
United States. Rather, we must fear
the internal uprising."
fie said that India needed $4 bil
lion in order to prevent such action
on the part, of the people, and that,
they lacked $1 billion of that. He ;
quoted Chester Bowles as saying
that, "A strong and democratic India .
is a greater guarantee of American j
security in strategic terms than any i
amount, of verbal agreement."
Husain mentioned that India was
not following a neutral policy. He
said, "India constantly expresses a
viewpoint and we use as a yardstick
the question, 'Would this or that
course of action promote the cause
of peace?'"
