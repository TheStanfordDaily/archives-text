# Colorful Cottons Bloom on Quad
## 
### ELLEN MANN 
Here comes spring time. If the
weather doesn't convince you, then
take a look at Quad Cot
ton has come to the fore, and this
season cotton looks like a whole new
invention.
A crop of spring colors that look
good enough to sip on have sprouted
on cotton —orange, pink, lemon, ice
blue, mint green, lavender, and bright
yellow are popular shades.
'Cotton is light as silk or stiff as
upholstery fabric; cotton is crammed
with polka dots or splashed with
flower prints; cotton is decorated
with buttons and bows. Classic cot
ton has become high fashion.
The "little girl" look is evident.
Puffed sleeves, Peter Pan collars,
pleated skirts, and petticoats produce
that impeccably neat look. On Quad
the favorite style is still the shirt
dress. Variations on this tlnme have
made the style even more popular.

Now tlie ('res-, has a wide, wide >kirt
that can he puked out with a crino
line petticoat, and the blouse often
ha> pleats of tiny, tiny ruffles to
dress it up.
Again there are shirt dresses that
look like Grandpa's nightshirt, but
the wai>t shows up when you buckle
the hell, l.ots of simple (Juad clothes
have decorations. For instance, den
im is embroidered with little seed
pearls- even rhinestones for ail extra
fancy occasion.
Separates are fun to ivear for
spriiiji. Here ai/aiii cotton dominates,
l ull, full skirts decorated icitli circus
strifes <ir millions of checks or
splashy floral desii/ns are seen in
many stores. I'ioo or ctcii three crin
olines may billow under these skirls.
An unusually large number of
sleeved blouse:-, are shown to top
cotton skirts. Round collars and
starched ruffles are important fash
ion notes. A blouse that might have
been made by Brooks Brothers has
been adopted by the ladies. The
shirt lias a starched collar, French
cuffs fly front, pocket, and all. The
all doesn't include the colors, which
are definitely for girls—small deli
cate flower prints, many, many
stripes, or a solid spring shade.
A new color that will be good for
spring and tremendous for summer
is orange—not just plain ordinary
orange thi> season its "hot orange,"
"orange sherbet," and "tangerine."
liven a brief note on accessaries
must include a comment on petti
coals. ( rinolines are the lliinti for
sprint). The new look in petticoats
is the "torso lank. No Itoii/er do
they billow out from the waist, hi
most crinolines, the fullness bet/ins
around the hips, and minimizes the
middle.
(Juad fashions still point to flats
as favorite footgear. Spring intro
duces straw for the fashion minded.
And shoes have also gone color-mad.
How about a pair of "orange sher
bet'' Hats.
Here comes springtime. And if the
weather doesn't convince you, then
take a look at Quad fashions.
