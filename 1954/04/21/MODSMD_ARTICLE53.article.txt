Something new, something fun—
earrings.
Modern art has contributed a mo
bile design that is slightly more than
terrific—a ceramic disk that looks
like a miniature pottery platter and
comes in a palette of exotic colors.
And don't be surprised to see minia
ture flowers used for earrings.
Cufflinks are an important item of
milady's jewelry this season. The de
signs art really big and handsome—
bold tailored patterns in gold and sil
ver. Here again small artificial
flowers are transplanted to cuffs for a
truly feminine touch. Also adopted
from the man's wardrobe are collar
clasps, a fashion must for starched
Peter Pan collars.
Summer jewelry in white is al
ways good. For spring the standard
summer white appears in pastel pink,
blue, and a pale, pale cream shade
very flattering to tans.
