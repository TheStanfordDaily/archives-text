# Spring Shoe Trim 'Fancy'
## 
### 
Footwear is going fancy this spring.
Embroidery, sequins, appliques, and
even rhinestones and pearls decorate
shoes as dressy as patent leather
heels or as casual as straw flats.
These straw flats are high fash
ion. Usually intricately embroidered,
these imported shoes go casual for
Quad wear and dressy for Friday
night dates with the greatest of ease.
The barefoot look is emphasized
by the large variety of sandals of
fered. Definitely no bar to suntans,
some of these sandals consist only of
a heel, sole, and one or two thin
straps.
Flats are of course an old spring
standby. The scooped-otit look is pop
ular, but ovey-the-ankle straps seem
to be going out of vogue. These shoes
come in a rainbow of colors to match
new spring outfits.
For sheer comfort, the denim play
shoe is hard to beat. Offered mainly
in red, faded blue, and navy blue, this
footwear is growing more and more
popular with coeds (and men also).
A new covered-lip look in pumps is
evident this spring. Calfskin models
are appearing with closed heel and
toe and the new medium-heighth,
broader heel.
For extra-special dressy occasions,
high heels take over, both in patent
leather and straw. No covered - tip
look is evident here, as botli models
tend toward less and less shoe with
more and more foot showing.
Comfort and style are keynotes in
footwear styles for spring.
