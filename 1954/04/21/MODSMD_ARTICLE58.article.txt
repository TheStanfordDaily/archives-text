Television time finds Dion in a Televiewer outfit. A
hand-blocked Don Blanding print, both jacket and
pants carry out the Chinese theme. Colorful Hawaiian
characters in aqua and black cavort on the jacket and
the trimming of the pants. This TV outfit is of satin
finished pima cloth and sells for $29.95.


Straight from the Islands comes this pure silk pongee,
modeled by Dion Zaches of Union. Dressy enough for
cocktail parties, this outfit has a fully-lined bodice
and self-binding at neckline and sleeves. It comes in
four colors, brown, blue, orange, and yellow, and in
12, 14, and 16. $25.


For beach parties, Dion chooses matching swimsuit
and jacket of coconut cloth. The suit illustrates the
new feminine look, and boasts a fully lined top with
elasticized bra. Over it goes a pyramid cut beach
jacket bound in contrasting trim with irregular pock
ets and a stand up collar. The duo comes in brown,
blue, and teal, in sizes 10 through 18. The jacket is
priced at $12.95, the swimsuit at $14.95
