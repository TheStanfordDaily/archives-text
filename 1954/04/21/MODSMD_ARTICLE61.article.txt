variations iu the petticoat.
In formal wear this spring you'll
see quite a variety. The loiiu formal
which gave way to "hallerii a" a
year or two ago is coming into it
own again. Skirts are bouffant and
full whatever their length.
The sophisticated lass is attempt
ing to be sweet and demurs, while the
demurely femine coed is having a
gay time being her natural self.
Feminity is definitely llie 7i'nr</ in

lime lit/lit. The old stand-by, taffeta,
is always jasliiaiiahle. Tabries
makiihi news art embroidered eordu
ray and wrinkle resistant nylon.
J.ow neck lines are giving wa\ to
feminine modesty with many of the
fashions showing narrow straps,
covered shoulders, or cap sleeves.
The strapless formal, though, is still
holding its own as a favorite among
Stanford coeds.
I-'or protection from that cool
breeze, woolen stoles are being seen,
especially those with metallic threads
woven in them. •
Black or white short jackets arc
both making fashion headlines. The

i
little black velvet c;i|ciet with rhine
sti in 01 | earl decoration keeps "her
