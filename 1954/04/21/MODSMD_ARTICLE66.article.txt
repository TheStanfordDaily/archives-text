# Conservative Roughs Veto Bermuda Walking Shorts
## 
### 
By JIM MORRKY
Bermuda-length walking shorts
may no longer raise eyebrows on
Kasteru campuses, hut at Stanford
only a hrave man can ipiietly wear
them to the Cellar for a col Tee break.
While shorts aren't sweeping the
campus, other trends are definitely
taking the lead in the fashion parade.
The most noticeable trend is the
move toward conservatism, with a
neater and dressier look aimed for
by Stanford roughs. Charcoal and
Oxford gray are popular shades in
sweaters, sport jackets, suits and
slacks. Shoulders are shedding ex
cess padding and cultivating that
natural look, and lapels and ties are
gettin; narrower. Two and three
button suits with Hap pockets and
center vents replace the old one
button styles.
A second trend to be seen in
Spring '54 is toward light and cool
suits for the sweltering summers.
The newest accomplishment of sci
nice—a tropical suit weighing little
more than a pound—will 'probably
be applauded by the Stanford man.
The third important trend is to
ward blends. Natural and man-made

Sports jackets won't feel so heavy
this summer. Keyboard colors create
a striking contrast when the popular
hlack cashmere jacket is worn with
white Hanuel slacks.
(fold and stiver tie tacks and cuft
links are the main items in men's

Kastern look to the narrow tie dud
the very popular button-down collar.
Stanford men may choose one of
three styles of fornrl w«"r T'-e
ever-popular dark blue suit, the
black .uxedo, and the ,
dinner jacket.
\\ bite dinner jackets are predomi
nate now however, coming in Dacron
to enhance tluir smoothness. The in
creasing popularity of black has in
vaded the tuxedo field, resulting in
charcoal grey formal wear.
On the whole, Stanford men are
clinging to their conservatism. Some
day a combination of black and white
checked walking shorts and a yellow
pastel shirt may be seen on a true
individualist, but the possibility of
such a startling development seems
slight.
