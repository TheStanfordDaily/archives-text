### GERRY SMITH 
"Style and dress don't just happenâ€”they are an intrinsic part
of the civilization that produced them," began Miss Virginia Ops
vig in "Costume Cavalcade," the Tuesday Evening Series pro
gram last night in Memorial Auditorium.
Within an hour, Miss Opsvig presented costumes ranging over

i the 2,300 year period from ancient
| Greece of 400 B.C. to 1920 A.D. These
costumes were modeled by 20 mem
bers of the Stanford Players, who
also performed dances appropriate
to each period.
Beginning with ancient Greece,
Miss Opsvig told of, and models
demonstrated, the Greek love of
color and simple triangular shaped
draping.
The 1 century A.D. was Miss
Opsvig's next stop as models showed
clothes appropriate to an age when
belief in an afterlife was high, and
the hody abhorred, loose-fitting gar
ments covering the person from head
to toe.
Moving to the Age of Chivalry,
1 dress is heavy and "drags to the
i very earth from which they arc try
| ing to descend," Miss Opsvig com
: mented. This was the period of
Goth if architecture and extreme
modesty.
The Italian Resaissance ushered
in an entirely new mode of dress.
Bright, jewel-like tones*and a fat
lower tieckline distinguished this
era, and brocades became rich and
j thick, Miss Opsvig mentioned.
The nobility of this time followed
the steps of the Basque dance, in
which Miss Opsvig pointed out that
! "the gentlemen take on a bit of the
look of flying buttresses." Peasant,
dances were faster with "more
jumping around," but she called this
dance "a graceful and moving sculp
ture."
Directly following this era. every
one dressed with individuality. "No
j one aped anyone else if he could
i help it," Miss Opuvig stated. This
: was the time of Henry VIII, of much
I greater freedom for women, and the

pre-Elizabethan short-skirted look
for men.
"Colors were copied from the
stained glass windows so popular
at this time," Miss Opsvig reported.
The popular dance of the age was
the Pavanne, which was danced by
several models in the showing.
Fashions in the 16th century were
horizontal rather than vertical. The
"round look" prevailed in both
clothes and architecture. Lace and
very rich fabrics appeared. Heads
remained covered, but hats were
briefer. 'Ilie dance of the Elizabe
than Era was the "gay and nimble"
Gal Hard.
Next came the "tardy but color
ful French Renaissance" with its
cavaliers, duels, high waist lines,
and long curled hair. With Charles
lis return to England, men's wigs,
fans, and snuff fere high style.
In the 18th century everyone wore
wigs and high heels. Miss Opsvig
commented thai the "mincing steps
of the minuet were probably caused
or influenced by these high heels,"
Beauty patches pointed up favored
features.
"Just as we have adopted the
Eisenhower jacket, citizens of that
day (the Empire) adopted military
boots," Miss Opsvig mentioned.
Women of the romantic period
were considered "dolls." People took
themselves seriously both in thoughts
and clothes. Next came the Victorian
Age with its hoop skirts and poljtas.
Tlie later Gibson Girl, Bunny Hug,
and Roaring 'Twenties were typi
cally American contributions to the
cavalcade of fashion, according to
Miss Opsvig.
