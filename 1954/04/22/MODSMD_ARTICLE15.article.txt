made a "principal" in the storms
Army-McCarthy investigation todav
shortly after he received a vote ol
toniidence from his boss, Defense

Secretary Charles E. Wilson.
Acting only a few hours before
the explosive Army - McCarthy
hearings get under way, Senate in
vestigators voted to bring Hensel
into the inquiry because of McCar
thy's charges that he masterminded
an Army report criticizing McCar
thy and his chief aides.
Hensel denied the accusation and
repeated anew today his charge that
"Sen. McCarthy is a liar, but not, a
very clever liar." He again chal
lenged the controversial Wisconsin
Republican to repeat the charge
without Senatorial immunity so he
could sue. McCarthy declined.
Wilson earlier defended Hensel as
a "competent, honest man." He
sharply challenged McCarthy's
charge that Hensel was guilty of
"misconduct and possihle law viola
tion" as a result of his activities for
a ship supply firm while a Navy offi
cial.
Wilson replied with a Hat "no' !
when asked if he believed McCar
thy's charges against Hensel.
Wilson told a news conference he
would fire Hensel if he did not be
lieve in him. Then without men
tioning names, Wilson said the
Army-McCarthy row reminds him |
of the political maxim: "If your op
ponent accuscs you of being a liar,
you don't deny it. You call him a
horse thief."
Acting Chairman Karl E. Mundt 1

(R., S.D.) said the investigating sub
committee's special counsel, Ray H.
Jenkins, will ask Hensel to submit a
statement outlining his position in
the dispute before the televised
Army-McCarthy hearings open.
The decision to bring Hensel into
tho already boiling controversy was
made at a secret subcommittee ses
sion. Democrats had served notice
in advance that they would insist on

broadening the investigation to in-
Hude McCarthy's charges against
Henscl and Hensel's flat denial.
Mundt said Hensel will have the
same right as other parties to the
dispute, which includes the right to
cross-examine witnesses.
In Houston. Texas,. McCarthy said
yesterday that "devilishly clever"
men have figured out a plan to
throttle his Senate Investigating
subcommittee's hunt for Commu
nists.
In Texas for a "non - political"
speech on Texas Independence Day,
he refused to repeat his accusations
that Hensel "masterminded" the
Army's scathing report on him free
of Senatorial immunity.
McCarthy did say that the plan
to throttle his committee would be
put into effect as soon as the hear
ings on his squabble with the Army
arc over.
"The plan is to shift and chance
Ihe rules of the committee under
the gtiise of fair play to make it im
possible for the committcc to oper
ate effectively," he told 7,500 Tex
ans gathered to observe San Jacinto
Day.
The men behind the plan, he said,
are "devilishly clever — and some
good men are being used, with the
assurance that they will be paid off
by receiving the praise and plaudits
of all the left-wing elements of
news, radio, and television."
