The ASSU and the University
must work together. The ASSU
president's first responsibility to the
student body, the administration, and
the alumni is to help maintain and
enlarge Stanford's position as a
first-rate institution of higher learn
ing.
On campus we must move as soon
as possible to start construction of
our much - needed sludent union.
Away from the campus, keeping
constant contact with people inter
ested in Stanford is one of my goals.
We are a privately endowed educa
tional institution and thus must rely
on friends of Stanford for financial
support. The ASSU president, can
be a vital factor in making friends
for Stanford.
The presidency of the ASSU is a
mandate to make the ASSU mean
something to every Stanford stu
dent. Large grups on the campu»
are completely unaware of what the
ASSU is or does. The first article
of the ASSU constitution says that
every student is a member of the
Associated Students. Yet in its
present condition the ASSU is not
an association of all Stanford stu
dents.
Even if making the ASSU mean
something to every student necessi
tates the rooting out. of some dead
wood in our student government,
this would be preferable to the sta
tus quo. The newly formed Commit
tee on Student Government, is go
ing to be of great help here.
Finally, my desire to serve as AS
SU president is based on three sim
ple words: to serve Stanford.
