Having previously expressed the
reasons for my stand against NSA
and my objections to any mechan
ical restrictions placed upon the
Honor Code. I would like to take
this opportunity to present my
views on an issue which has been
in the background of the current
campaign, but which is of prime
importance and should be brought
to the attention of the voter;
namely, the relationship of the
student manager to the legislative
and executive branch of the gov
ernment.
During the campaign it has been
proposed that a financial commit
tee of Excom be organized to over
see the expenditures of the student
manager. This year as assistant
student manager, it is my obser
vation that a legislative committee
which tries to audit the books of a
man who handles close to half a
million dollars a year would be
impractical, besides the fact he is
carefully selected for his ability.
The student manager is appoint
ed by the administration, the AS
SU president by the students. It is
essential for the efficiency of the
government that close co-opera
tion be maintained between these
two offices, but it is imperative
that they remain independent, free
from controls imposed by each one
upon the other. Therefore, I am
against any restrictions placed
upon the student manager, other
than those of his own qualifica
tions.
This and other similar issues
will be determining factors in Ex
com's consideration of certain con
stitutional revisions next fall. Such
important problems as these require
experienced officers, well versed in
all facets of student government.
One proposed constitutional
change is that a House of Repre
sentatives of 100-200 members be
established to extend representation
and to advise the Executive Com
mittee. It has been my experience
that a group such as this is a fine
ideal, but an impractical reality, be
ing too large for efficiency and ac
curacy.
In its place I propose a Cabinet,
appointed by and directly respon
sible to the president and Excom.
Each member will be an expert in
some phase of student government
and will be able to advise Excom
and help draft legislation in his field.
To accmplish this purpose he will
organize a representative group of
people interested in his particular
aspect of student government.
