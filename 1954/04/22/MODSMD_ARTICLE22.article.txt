see no reason why the student borl

censorship in education.
This last brings me to what I con
sider the outstanding issue of i;v
election: what is, and what cm i
the role of the student body pre ■«
dent. I find that the most frequen
complaint brought against govern
ment here at Stanford is the gul
existing between the student an
his elected officers. In bridging tin
gap, the president can be of groa
value by visiting and eating wit I
groups all over the campus and 1
reporting his findings each weel
through The Daily and KZSU.
I am determined to bring to th
presidency the type of leader hi i
which will encourage students on I
levels to take an active interest n
their government. I ask for you
support in this undertaking.
