## ”GM Gets Along Without Atomic Scientists" Oppenheimer and Justice 
### 
During the congressional investigations and
security-risk firings of the past few years, we've
had a chance to get used to one new principle
of justice: that suspected "security risks" are
presumably guilty until proved innocent.
Nov; we're being asked to accept still another
new principle: that a man may be treated as
guilty even after his innocence is proved.
Last week Secretary of Defense Charles E.
Wilson told newsmen that he would not re
hire atomic expert J. Robert Oppenheimer,
even if Dr. Oppenheimer were again cleared
by the Atomic Energy Commission's special
security board.
Mr. Wilson said he had "the greatest sym
pathy for anyone who made a mistake and
reformed," but added, "I think they ought to
be reformed somewhere else than on the mili
tary service."
With these few words Mr. Wilson indicates
that nothing Dr. Oppenheimer could prove
would be able to clear Dr. Oppenheimer.

He presumeß that Dr. Oppenheimer is a
guilty man, who now needs to "reform."
He assumes that he may take law into his
own hands, and ignore any decision reached
by the security board legally charged with de
termining the facts of the case.
Time and again security boards have cleared
Dr. Oppenheimer of all "security risk" charges.
Next week the Atomic Energy Commission's
special board will complete its hearing of Dr.
Oppenheimer's case. Unless the board has in
formation not available to the newspapers or
the public, the charges against Dr. Oppen
heimer do not indicate that he is a "security
risk."
We hope that clearance from still another
board will enable Dr. Oppenheimer to prove
his loyalty to his country for once and for all.
And we hope that Mr. Wilson, and anyone
else who believes that anyone named as a
"security risk" is in need of "reform," will
take time out to reconsider the basic tenets of
justice.
