In an editorial last week, The Daily criticized
economy-minded congressmen in the House
for voting to slash $6,000,000 from the 1955
International Educational Exchange Program.
Since then, the Executive Committee has taken
positive action on the cut by voting unani
mously at last Wednesday's meeting to sign
and send a letter to California Senators Know
land and Kuchel and lo Vice President Nixon
protesting the action.
In approving this communication-the full
text of which was printed in Tuesday's Daily
Excom also recommended that interested stu
dents write similar letters to their Senators.
The Excom letter points out that "intimate

contact and association with peoples from other
countries can do more than anything else to
promote the sympathetic understanding of the
ideals and principles for which our country
stands." ,
Now that the exchange program is being
threatened, students have been given the op
portunity of showing just how strong their
support really is.
The Foreign Scholarship Committee, which
drew up the letter, and Excom, have done their
parts. Now it's up to students who agree with
the letter's assertion that "the exchange of stu
dents is a slow but sure way to the realization
of world community and world peace" to make
their opinions known.
