# CAMPUS OPINION
## Understanding Now 
### 
To the Fditor:
What should he our attitude toward Stanford bring
ing a Yugoslavian student to .study here? This was
the initial topic choscn by the 28 students taking
Public Discussion. We reached these conclusions:
In the firft place, it seems logical to assume that
Petar Macanovic is a Communist. However, in the
interests of world peace, we must try, where pos
sible, to maintain a bridge of communication over
the gap which divides our present world into two
opposing camps of communism and democracy. It
is easier to maintain this bridge now than it would be
to try to rebuild it in the future.
Some have questioned the advisability of giving
one of the all too few foreign scholarships to an in
dividual who may be unable to make his impressions
known publicly when he returns. However, our

whole scholarship program rests on an intellectual
faith in human relations and the far-reaching effects
of individual contacts. Even though he may not adopt
our political philosophy, Macanovic will be able to
absorb other aspects of our culture and gain a better
understanding of the United States.
The coming of this student to Stanford places a
tremendous responsibility upon us. We must make
every effort to meet him as an individual, and to
give him a chance to communicate with as many of
us as possible.
The acceptance of this foreign scholar is concrete
recognition of our desire to welcome all ideasâ€”a
fundamental principle of our university, and of de
mocracy as a whole.
