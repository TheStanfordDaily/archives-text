# Schedule Open For Final Day Of Blood Drive
## 
### 
The Red Cross flag will hang qver
the entrance of the Women's Club
house once again as the April Blood
Drive enters its second and final
day. Donations will continue from
8:30 a.m. to \ p.m.
Appointments are not necessary
for students who have not yet signed
up.
Yesterday's turnout was termed
"disappointing" by drive co-chair
man Fred Stern. Only 139 out of
300 appointments were kept, he said.
Nurses and nurses' aides from the
Palo Alto chapter of the American
Red Cross are in charge of the do
nations. Each appointment will take
approximately 35 minutes.
Students who wish to donate are
asked to have only toast, coffee, and
orange juice for four hours pre
ceding their appointment.
The blood will be used by the
armed forces and by the Depart
ment of Defense for preventive
measures for the oncoming polio
season.
Students who have had infectious
mononucleosis over a year ago may
now give blood, according to the
Red Cross. Advanced processing
procedures have now negated the
possibilities of transmitting most
communicable diseases.
Donors who have had a history of
malaria but have had no clinical at
tack for two years may also donate.
Students who have had smallpox or
yellow fever immunizations may
donate two weeks after their last in
jection, and those who have had
tetanus injections may donate if one
week has elapsed since their last in
jection.
Release slips are still available at
the Cardinals ofiicc for students
under 21.
