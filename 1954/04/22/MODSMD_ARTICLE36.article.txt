## The 						Inside Pitch 
### 
Stanford s baseball team, long on defense and short on power, clashes
with Cal Saturday in a league tilt which will mark the hallway point ii
C ILJA play lor the Tribe. A win here and a twin-killing of USC next week
coupled with a mass genocide of'the rest of the league as they play eacl
other would just about wrap up another championship for Everett Dean
Ihe Stantord coach has successfully plugged seven holes I"* 1 ! bv lp r
year s losses. It's been the consistently fine pitching of Ray Young and
Phil Pai>e that has kept the Indians on top. Out of 615 league innings, Stan
ford has only had two bad ones, a four-run frame by USC and a six-rur
mishap by Santa Clara, both of which have been the difference between
a 7-0 record and the present 5-2 mark,
Three o! the finest fielding plays that will ever be seen on any field

have been witnessed in the past two
games at the Sunken Diamond.
Against Santa Clara, last week,
Young raced back over the mound
to take a chopper and throw oft bal
ance to catch a runner at first. In
the same contest Warren Goodrich
turned in a sparkling play when he
threw out a rynner after fielding
the ball on the first base side of sec
ond. Against the Jo Sox Tuesday
Sid Hall made a leaping, backhanded
tu/nbling catch of a line drive in
left center.
Taking the pennant race at a
glance, Dean turned diplomat when
he said it "looks evenly matched."
He thinks UCLA has found itself
and knows Cal can be troublesome,
especially with star shortstop Dick
Anient back in the line-up. Troy
has the power and mediocre pitch
ing, while Santa Clara has a monop
oly on the hitting departments, a
hobbled catcher and a hold on last
place.

While on the subject of baseball, Dick Clegg reports that his frosh club
is hitting its stride. He has three top flinders in lanky Ed Vurdurmen,
Dick Jones, and Ray Looney. This corps has totaled six wins in nine
outings and no one has been shelled from the hill.
Vurdurmen seems a good bet for varsity status next year. In his last
1H innings he tossed 201 pitches and against Cal last Saturday threw 77
strikes and only 25 balls.
Third sacker Hal Messner is slamming the ball at a .400 pace for the
Papooses and is their current RBI leader. Clegg also praised the play of
second baseman Boh Fletcher and shortstop Rudy Figueroa. Fletcher is
a good man for getting on bases and has pilfered four bases, while Figueroa
has powered two triples and a double.

The Cornell Sun has gone the Stanford Daily one better. We have our
girl sports writer Lee Hansen, but the gang from far above Cayuga's
waters has a newly elected sports editor by name of Anne Morrissy. She's
a female of the species.

Santa Rosa JC seems to be a top farm club for the Armed Services and
Stanford. Basketballer and Korean Naval veteran Bill Turner came to
Stanford via that route and made his mark on the '54 cage squad.
On March 1(5 Chuck Van Linge was discharged from thv Marines and
entered Stanford. He won his fame over the week end by snaring the
coveted Northern Intercollegiate Golf Championship. Van Linge and
Turner were roommates at Santa Rosa.

Over at the Sunken Diamond the other day Stanford Sports Publicist
Don Liebendorfer pointed out the profile resemblance between the, Cards'
leltfielder Bob Evans and Yankee great Joe DiMaggio. This caused a man
of the press to remark, "Yeah, but there's one thing Evans doesn't have that
Joe does."
You name it!

Rich Scramaglia's brother Jack played with St. Ignatius in yesterday's
frosh game. Jack, a little smaller, but just as lively, is also a second base
man. Only a junior, he should arrive at Stanford just in time to take over
the vacated spot.
