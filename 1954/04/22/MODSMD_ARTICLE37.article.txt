# French Teacher Piffard Drives Own Jag in Sports Car Races

### JACK BYRNE 
It's a long jump from French
philology and a study of the
classics to the niceties of
sport car racing, but a pair of
Stanford instructors made the
leap at the Pebble Beach race.
The duo is composed of Guerard
Piffard, a French grad who teaches
elementary French, and William
Harris, an instructor in the Classics
Department.
Piffard, who is the owner of a
Jaguar XK 120, performed the driv
ing, while Harris sweated the race
out in the pits, signaling Piffard as
to position, laps, and the other vital
information a driver must have but
cannot possibly keep for himself.
Piffard is not yet sure just how
he did in the race. He drove in the
novice class for cars over 1.500 cc.
displacement, and thinks he ran
about 12th or 13th. There is also a
subclassification of cars, in which he
also will be placed finally, but the
word has still to come from the
Sports Car Club of America.
In the seat of his car, Piffard has
more than enough to do. Coming
out of a tight turn at 20 or so m.p.h.,
he accelerates through the gears.
He has no opportunity to watch the
speedometer, but keeps his eye on
the "tach, the all-important ta
chometer which tells him how fast
his engine is turning.
As he goes through the four gear
ranges, speed increases till he is

traveling an estimated 107-110
m.p.h. Then the brakes, and down
shift to 20 for another tight turn.
His car, purchased in Germany, is
carefully lightened and cleaned out.
Off go the windshield and the wip
ers—too much air resistance. In the
place of the windshield goes a small
windscreen that barely hides the
face. Out go the right seat, fire ex
tinguisher, floor mats, tools, anything
that might rattle or fly into the
driver in a crash or a fast stop.
Piffard is the only mechanic who
has ever worked on the car, and
he proudly feels he knows its every
movement, what it can and will do
and what might go out. Many other
drivers, with a corps of mechanics,
never see under the hood and barely
know the actions of their cars.
Piffard's Jag is his only car. He
drives it to school every day. Rac
ing is strictly a hobby.
His first race was the Pike's Peak
Hill Climb last year, in which he
took second in the sports car class.
The Pebble Beach race was his first
competition where cars run togeth
er instead of against the clock.
He received one shock when he
entered a tight curve, away to the
right, and was just swinging the
wheel when he discovered another
car, also going through to his right. '
Centrifugal force started him to
ward the hay bales on the outside
of the curve. Calmly he remem
bered the maxim for Jaguar driv
ers—"When in trouble, give it the |
gas" — and sped off into a straight
away, unscathed.
Piffard and Harris came together
through a mutual friend. They did
some work on the car together.
When Piffard needed a pit-man for
the race, he asked Harris.
A post-race inspection of the car
showed little damage. Though the
engine had run for some time at
800 r.p.m. over the factory-suggest
ed maximum, it was unharmed.
Tires were worn on one side from
the "heeling over" on the turns.

turn on the Pebble Beach course. In a matter of seconds he will
be traveling nearly 100 m.p.h. Haze in the background is smoke
from hot tires, clutches, and engine oil.
