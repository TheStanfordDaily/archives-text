# Junior Prom Moved to S.F.
## 
### 
As a result of a change of opinion
by the Bay Meadows Club board of
directors, the Junior Prom, origi
nally scheduled to be held at Bay
Meadows Turf Club in San Mateo,
will now be in the Gold and Empire
Rooms of the Fairmont Hotel in San
Francisco on April 30 from 0 to 1.
The changc was necessary because
a club function is scheduled at the
Turf Club the next, morning. It
would not be possible to have the
club ready if the dance were held
there the night before, the directors
said.
Tickets are now oti sale at the
ASSU office at $3.75 per couple.
Art Stauffer is general chairman
of the dance.
The juniors will end the weekend
with the annual Junior Water Car
nival on the Sunday afternoon fol
lowing the Prom. The theme of the
Carnival will be "Fleet of the Fu
ture." In addition to races for men
and women and a float parade, the
crew will bring two shells to the
lake and stage a race.
