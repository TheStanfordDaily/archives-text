swimming competition.
During winter quarter, the Biz
men came through second in table
tennis to Crothers I.
The Zetes' number two team fin
ished on top in the race for the
football championship, and their
number one team came in first in
basketball.
Crothers has taken two firsts and
one second for its third place.
The turn-out has not been too
strong this spring, Intramural Di
rector Elwyn Bugge said; therefore
it cannot be determined, as yet, how
much weight the spring sports will
carry in the final outcome.
The swimming title was taken
again by the Kappa Sigs, who have
now won it for four years in a
row.
