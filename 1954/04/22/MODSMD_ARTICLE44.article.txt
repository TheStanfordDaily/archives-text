WHAT MAKES IT GO—A member of the "black gang" shows the midshipmen through the
ship's engine room on part of their complete tour of the subchaser. The compact machinery is
kept in perfect shape to stand the strain of heavy loads at high speeds. Accompanying the
group on their two-day trip was Lieut. R. A. Derus.



OHH!!—Three Stanford sailors take time out to fight off a bout
of seasickness. Doughty argonauts Dick Zeiber, Henry Viets,
and Dave Scott blend into the olive-drab canvas cover of a 5-inch
gun practice loading machine and wish for a bottle of Mother
sill's Seasick Remedy.


SEA FIGHTER—The USS Nickel, a destroyer-escort which car
ried the Stanford midshipmen on their weekend cruise. De
stroyer-escorts, built primarily for anti-submarine warfare, are
in the 1500-ton class, about half the size of a destroyer. The
Nickel is 306 feet long and develops a top speed of about 23
knots. A full-size destroyer's speed at "full ahead flank" is
about 34 knots, fastest for naval vessels.

SMALL ARMS—The Stanford midshipmen get a quick run
down on the M-l rifle, a standard weapon on Navy ships. Each
of the NROmen was later allowed to fire the rifle, one of the
many guns they were shown during the training cruise. Dur
ing the two days the Stanford group was aboard, the ship
cruised about 40 miles off the coast of Monterey.
