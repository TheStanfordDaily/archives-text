Symphony under the direction of
Bruno Walter. The performance will

The conductor was at Woodpecker
Lodge to rehearse the chorus Mon
day and Tuesday. The chorus and
symphony will perforin at the War
Memorial Opera House tomorrow at
2:15 p.m. and Saturday at 8:30 p.m.
as well as tonight.
''This is the most elaborate pro
gram the Stanford chorus has over
performed with the San Francisco
Symphony," said Professor Harold
C. Schmidt, who directs the chorus
here. "The chorus will sing for all
but about five minutes of the pro
gram."
Brahms' "A German Requiem"
and Bruckner's "Te Deum" will he
featured on the same program' for
the*first time. Usually the works of
the two nineteenth century compos
ers, one in the Romantic tradition,
the other in the style of Wagner,
are not combined.
This is the second time in three
years that Walter has led the chorus.
The 78-year-old conductor also led
the San Francisco Symphony in a
Beethoven program last Thursday as
guest conductor, and directed the
UCLA chorus with the Los Angeles
Symphony this year. In several days
he plans to travel t,o Europe to con
duct orchestras in London, Rome,
Florence, Milan, and Zurich.
Soloists for the program tonight
will be Brunetta Mazzolini, soprano;
June Wilkins, contralto; Cesare
Curzi, tenor; and Mack Harrell,
bass. Miss Wilkins and Curzi have
both sung in Stanford operas in re
cent years.
Kirke Mechem, assistant director
of the chorus, and John Boswell and
Louise Larson, accompanists, have
been assisting in preparing the cho
rus for its performance.
The chorus has been heard in the
San Francisco Symphony series
eight, times in the past. In this pro
gram, however, more time is de
voted to the Stanford chorus than
ever before, according to Schmidt.
The chorus, consisting of 180
voices, has sung under Pierre Mon
teux, Thor Johnson of the Cincin
nati Symphony, William Steinberg
of the Pittsburgh Symphony, and
Victor dc Sabata, director of the
La Scala Opera Company.
Last December they performed
Britten's "St. Nicholas" and Verdi's
"Te Deum."
