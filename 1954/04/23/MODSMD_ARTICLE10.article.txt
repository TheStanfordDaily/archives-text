# Card Nine Meets Slumping Bears
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's league-leading Cinder
ella baseball club, which has
achieved a position of prominence by
virtue of some strong pitching-arms,
will lock horns with the slump-rid
den California nine at 2:30 p.m. to
morrow at the Sunken Diamond.
The strongest arm of them all.
sophomore Ray Young, will ascend
the mound ami pit his three-won,
none-lost CIBA record against Cal's
ace, Joe Gaggero, who has won two
•and lost one in league play.
Young, the olive-skinned control
artist from the smog-drenched slopes
of Los Angeles, has an amazing
earned run average of J. 4!) for six
games.
Gaggero, a lanky right-hander,
won his first two CIRA starts easily,
but was shelled by USC last week.
He is considered one of the best
hurlers in collegiate baseball.
Cal, which sports a four-and
four record (as opposed to Stanf
ord's five-two), expects to re
gain the crucial services of shoi<-
stop Dick Amcnt by game lime.
Since Amcnt twisted his knee on
April 10, the Bears have tasted

nothing but unsuccess, losing
three league tilts in a row. His
return will give the Bears a con
siderable boost, if he is right.
In the last three games that ven
erable Clint Evans' team has lost,, it,
has wandered across home plate 5
times, as compared to 44 markers
rung up by the opposing teams in
27 innings.
Stanford has a problem of its own
to overcome tomorrow—the grim
problem of muted bats. The Indians
arc presently in the league pent
house because of strong pitching, a
good double-play combination, the
solid down-the-middle defense of
Lennie Swartz, Rich Scramaglia,
Warren Goodrich, and Sid Hall, and
wing-footed base-running.
The . 24X team batting average
doesn't indicate a preponderance
of muscle at the plate, and the
Indians arc determined to rectify
that tomorrow. Only Goodrich,
with a .321 average, and Scrag,
with a .308 clip, can hold their
heads high. The. one consolation is
that the opposition has been si
lenced worse than a McCarthy
witness with a .322 mark.
