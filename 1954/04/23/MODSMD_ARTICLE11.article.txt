# Card Spikers-Oxy Collide
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Stanford's cinder team, improving
noticeably with every week, flies to
Southern California to run, jump,
and throw tomorrow against Eagle
Rock's little institute for track men
—Occidental College.
Gerry Wood, who is probably the
number one high hurdle man in the
country, may double up in the lows
in an effort to collect eight points
for the Tribe in both barrier con
tests.
Jim Luttrell, the fast - stepping
sophomore, also figures to be able
to handle Oxy's best in both events.
Luttrell rested a sore right leg last
week, but he ran 23.5 in the 220
lows against USC.
If Wood takes a crack at both hur
dle races, half-miler Larry Spicer
may take over Wood's role in the
mile relay. Spicer ripped off a 49?8
440 in practice Wednesday.
Bill Kupp, captain Fred George,
and Walt Garrett will probably
handle the other assignments in
what may well be a meet-deciding
relay.
Occidental was clocked in 3:16.4

in a narrow loss to USC three weeks
ago, but t.hr Tigers will probably be
forced to equal that, time if they
hope to win the baton-passing event
tomorrow.
The big question mark for Stan
ford is the endition of Gerge, the
ace quarter - miler of last year.
George, running at his best, could
beat Oxy in the 440 and lead the
Indians to a winning relay.
Garrett, however, is probably in
the best shape of his life, as evi
denced by his thundering finish in
the open meet last week and a 21.5
furlong lie turned in Wednesday.
He should be able to hold up the
Indians' hopes in the 440.
Bu( (his Is a meet where every
point will count. Oxy picked up
50 Mr points against IJSC while the
Cards got only 42. Both teams had
good days against (he Trojans.
Keith Brownsberger's perform
ance will be of particular impor
tance to the Cards' cause. Brownie
dented the Trojans' big three in
both sprints, but. Oxy runners could
only score in the 220.
A 1 Cheney, the 52-foot Stanford
shot putter, will be engaged in ;>
tight struggle with sophomore Ton.
Meyer of the Tigers. And both E<
Fremouw and Loren Sorenson will
be straining for important points in
the broad jump.
The Indians look good for firsts
and seconds and maybe sweeps in
both the high jump and the jave
lin.
After last week's long toss, Leo
Long should walk away with the
spear - tossing competition. Boh
Kiniball figures for second and
John Bugge may get the place
spot.
John Stewart should be an easy
high jump winner with Norm Jiles
second. Larry Kelley may be able
to out-leap Oxy's John Barnes.
Bob Reed will be running the mile
against the 4:13 ace Jim Terrill of
Occidental. Claude Fiddler looks
like a good bet for five Oxy points
in the two-mile.
Stanford's Bill Flint will be out to
prevent an Oxy sweep in the pole
vault. Roy Carter looks like a cinch
to win.

Fremouw and Loren Sorenson will
be straining for important points in
the broad jump.
The Indians look good for firsts
and seconds and maybe sweeps in
both the high jump and the jave
lin.
After last week's long toss, Leo
Long should walk away with the
spear - tossing competition. Boh
Kiniball figures for second and
John Bugge may get the place
spot.
John Stewart should be an easy
high jump winner with Norm Jiles
second. Larry Kelley may be able
to out-leap Oxy's John Barnes.
Bob Reed will be running the mile
against the 4:13 ace Jim Terrill of
Occidental. Claude Fiddler looks
like a good bet for five Oxy points
in the two-mile.
Stanford's Bill Flint will be out to
prevent an Oxy sweep in the pole
vault. Roy Carter looks like a cinch
to win.
Stanford's cinder team, improving
noticeably with every week, flies to
Southern California to run, jump,
and throw tomorrow against Eagle
Rock's little institute for track men
—Occidental College.
Gerry Wood, who is probably the
number one high hurdle man in the
country, may double up in the lows
in an effort to collect eight points
for the Tribe in both barrier con
tests.
Jim Luttrell, the fast - stepping
sophomore, also figures to be able
to handle Oxy's best in both events.
Luttrell rested a sore right leg last
week, but he ran 23.5 in the 220
lows against USC.
If Wood takes a crack at both hur
dle races, half-miler Larry Spicer
may take over Wood's role in the
mile relay. Spicer ripped off a 49?8
440 in practice Wednesday.
Bill Kupp, captain Fred George,
and Walt Garrett will probably
handle the other assignments in
what may well be a meet-deciding
relay.
Occidental was clocked in 3:16.4

in a narrow loss to USC three weeks
ago, but t.hr Tigers will probably be
forced to equal that, time if they
hope to win the baton-passing event
tomorrow.
The big question mark for Stan
ford is the endition of Gerge, the
ace quarter - miler of last year.
George, running at his best, could
beat Oxy in the 440 and lead the
Indians to a winning relay.
Garrett, however, is probably in
the best shape of his life, as evi
denced by his thundering finish in
the open meet last week and a 21.5
furlong lie turned in Wednesday.
He should be able to hold up the
Indians' hopes in the 440.

Keith Brownsberger's perform
