## Stevens Charges McCarthy and Cohn Perverted Power in Pvt. Schine Case 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 22 (UP)
— Army Secretary Robert T.
Stevens charged today that Sen.
Joseph R. McCarthy and Roy H.
Cohn were guilty of a "perver
sion of power" in their efforts to
get an Army commission for G.
David Schine.
Stevens, who once went white
with anger, also testified that Cohn
threatened "war" on the Army af
ter he was denied admittance to a
secret radar laboratory at Fort Mon
mouth, N.J. Stevens said Cohn de
clared, "We will readily investigate
the Army now."
The Army Secretary leveled the
charges at the opening of the Sen
ate Investigating subcommittee's
televised inquiry into the angry
Army-McCarthy row. The session
also produced clashes between Mc-
Carthy and an Army general and
subcommittee Democrats.
Maj. Gen. Miles W. Reber, former
iiaison officer between the Army
and Congress, swore that McCarthy
and Cohn, the Senator's chief coun
sel, exerted "great pressure" in an
attempt to get a commission for
Schine, former subcommittee aide
who since has been drafted.
McCarthy fired back that Reber
was guilty of "bias and prejudice"
because his brother, Samuel Reber,
had been forced to resign from a
high State Department post as the
result of an investigation by the
McCarthy subcommittee.
The charge appeared to shock" the
general, who said he had not heard
anything like it about his brother
before. The State Department said
Samuel Reber, who had been assist
ant U.S. High Commissioner for
Germany, resigned voluntarily last
fall. It did not say whether he was
under investigation.
Undersecretary of State Walter

for Schine. Smith said he was un
able to get an Army commission for
Bedell Smith also testified about
Cohn's efforts to get a commission

Schine and suggested one with the
supersecret Central Intelligence
Agency, which he formerly headed.
But Smith said Cohn told him
not to try to place Schine in the
CIA because it was "too juicy a
subject for investigation." He
quoted Cohn as saying it "would
not he right" to ask (he agency for
help and then investigate it later.
McCarthy, accompanied by his
wife, Jean, who was on crutches,
drew a big cheer from the crowd in
the ornate Senate caucus room as he
appeared to answer counsel Ray
Jenkins' queries on Army charges
that he and Cohn used "improper
means" to get favored treatment for
Schine.
The investigation, opening under
the glare of television lights, also
involves charges by McCarthy and
Cohn that the Army used Schine as

a "hostage" to "blackmail" them
into calling off an inquiry into al
leged Army Reds.
Acting subcommittee chairman
Karl E. Mundt (R., S.D.), who rig
idly enforced rules of procedure
during the first clay's session, said
the stormy hearings will be held
Monday through Friday for perhaps
as long as two weeks.
Stevens denounced as "abso
lutely false" McCarthy's "black
mail" charge against the Army.
Reading from a 25-page prepared
statement that reviewed the months
long history of the Schine case, Ste
vens said that after Schine was in
ducted as a private he got 15 passes
from last Nov. 10 to Jan. 16.
"By way of comparison," lie
said, "the majority of other newly
inducted personnel obtained three
passes during the same period."
Stevens charged that McCarthy
and Cohn repeatedly sought favors
for Schine. He said nothing in his
experience as Army Secretary
"matches this persistent, tireless ef
fort to obtain special consideration
and privileges for this man."
He called the efforts of McCarthy
and Cohn the "wrongful seeking of
privilege, the perversion of power."
General Reber testified that dur
ing his 10 years of dealing with
Congress as liaison chief, "I recall
no instance in which I have been
put under greater pressure."
But both Reber and Gen. Smith
asserted there was nothing "im
proper" in what McCarthy and
Cohn did. Reber said he was not
intimidated by McCarthy and his
chief aide.
McCarthy accused Reber of being
"biased" because Rcber's brother
had a run-in with Cohn and Schine
during their much-publicized tour
of Europe last summer in which
they investigated U.S. overseas li
braries.
