## 
### 
The Committee for Art at. Stanford
will sponsor a "Collector's Choice"
exhibition at the Stanford Art Gal
lery on Sunday.
The exhibition will feature works
by many of the world's most fa
mous artists, including Cezanne,
Degas, Van Gogh, Goya, Picasso,
Matisse, and Rivera. The exhibi
tion will consist primarily of paint
ings, but there will also be several
sculptured pieces.
The art treasures are mostly those
on loan from the homes of Bay area
collectors. However, there are sev
eral from Southern California and
one is from the Lasker Collection of
New York. This one, which is called
"Children in the Tuileries" was re
cently shown at the Palace of the Le
gion of Honor in San Francisco.
In order to hang the exhibit, the
Gallery will be closed today and to
morrow. Regular hours arc noon to
4 p.m. on Sunday and 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. on week days. The Gallery is
not open on Mondays.
