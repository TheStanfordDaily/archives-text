The Stanford chapter of the Fed
eration of American Scientists, a na
tional organization of scientists con
cerned with the interrelations of
science and government, made the
following statement today:
"The charges brought against I.
Robert Oppenheimer raise many
serious questions of concern to a!<
of us. Needless to say they em
phasize the question of proper
balance between progress and for
mal security required by the best
interests of the country.
"Whatever the answer to this
question may be, we are alarmed
by the precedent set by the charge
that Oppenheimer's advice on delay
of H-bomb construction is a reflec
tion on his loyalty. As chairman of
the General Advisory Committee to
the U.S. Atomic Energy Commis
sion, he took a definite stand on the
controversial question of H - bomb
construction, none of the published
facts indicated that his advise was
motivated by anything but his con-

sidered judgment as to the best in
terests of the United States in the
light of the information available.
Whether his advice was good or bad
is not the question. It is tragic for
America when a scientist asked for
advice by the government on a con -
troversial question must weigh hi;
answers for fear that his opinion
might reflect upon his loyalty."
