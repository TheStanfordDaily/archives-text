## Joe and His Smile 
### 
Yesterday we watched television broadcast
of the Army-McCarthy hearings before the
Senate Subcommittee on Investigations.
Senator Joseph McCarthy had stepped down
from the chair and chief-counsel Roy Cohn had
been replaced for the hearings.
The change was good for both of them.
Both were placed in a position where they
were forced to abide by the rulings of Acting
chairman Karl Mundt and special chief counsel
Hay Jenkins.
At one point in the hearings, Jenkins ruled
against McCarthy after the Wisconsin send lor
had directed a question at one of the witnesses!
McCarthy accepted the decision reluctantly.
With a smile, he commented:

"I thought I understood these legal proced
ures. I realize I'm learning some new rules."
With this sudden flash of honesty, McCarthy
clearly pinpointed for us his own disrespect
for fair'and legal investigation.
And the sarcastic smile with which he ac
companied his comment indicated to us the
true extent to which he "realizes" legal pro
cedures.
We think that the hearings will continue to
be conducted fairly and legally by the acting
chairman and the special counsel.
And we think that as they continue, McCar
thy's smile will fade.
We hope he fades with it.
