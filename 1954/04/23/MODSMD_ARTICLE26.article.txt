# A 						Second Chance
## 
### 
Today is unusual, for a second chance is of
fered.
A second chance for the student who had
classes all day yesterday and couldn't wait in
lines. A second chance for the student who
didn't have any Quad classes and went to the
beach, or who was away on a special class as
signment. A second chance for all those who
were "too busy" or "too lazy" or "not inter
ested" or "just forgetful."
A second chance for all students who have
not yet voted in the ASSU final elections.
This two-day final election is unique, the re
sult of an emergency decision by the Execu
tive Committee Tuesday night. The discovery
that most graduate business students have all
day field trips on Thursday and have been un

able to vote yesterday prompted the change in
voting procedure.
Yet this decision, we feel, has merit far
beyond that of an "emergency solution."
Two days of voting give all students a chance
to cast their ballots, a right and privilege they
might otherwise be denied.
The added time means fewer long lines an
advantage to the voter. It means working un
der less hurried and confused conditions -an
advantage for the Election Board worker. It
means more votes will be cast and the leaders
elected will be more representative of the stu
dents an advantage to ASSU student govern
ment.
The second chance. We hope the student
won't pass it up.
