# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'A New Era' 
### 
To the Editor:
A new era has been opened up for election cam
paigns here at Stanford. Tuesday night an election
rally, the first of its kind to the best of my knowledge,
was held at Stern Hall.
All of the ASSU candidates were present, and they
gave brief speeches about their program. The fact that
they were all there to speak at the same time was in
itself a good thing. Better than the door-knocking
type of campaigning, this let those in attendance see
all the candidates side by side and compare them.
This, however, was only the preliminary. Alter the
speeches the session was opened to any questions the
audience might have. And they had many. Such
things as the future presidents' feelings about the NSA
and the Honor Code were discussed, and each candi
date clarified his stand on these matters. Those in
attendance really got to know the candidates thor
oughly.

As far as I am concerned this policy should replace
personal campaigning. It eliminates memorized
speeches, makes for a much more informal attitude,
and allows voters to see clearly what they are voting
for.
Further than merely exposing the candidates com
pletely, this session was very educational to the au
dience. There were many of us who knew little, or
nothing, about NSA. NSA was taken apart and
learned by the majority of the audience. Discussion
about the Honor Code brought up many points hither
to unknown to me.
We, the undersigned, want this policy undertaken
in all ASSU elections, and would like to see it in oper
ation during the term of office of the elected candi
dates.
