# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
FRIDAY ROUNDUP
A lot of persons are excited about Ilowie Dallmar's
return to Stanford as the mentor of the men of bounce,
not the least ol whom is Jake Irwin.
Jake, who shepherds the equipment among other
things, says, "It'll sure be good to see Howie come

back. He took a pair of basket
ball shoes when he left in 1941,
and I'd like to get them back."
COMMON HERITAGE DEPT.:
For probably the first time in his
political life, Stanford's Goodwin
Knight, who runs the affairs of
state at Sacramento between cam
paign speeches, was momentarily
speechless.
Knight, who displayed an amaz
ing memory for names and an
T : :i~ t

Ipana ivory smile while on the Farm, got on rather
a low blow at his gubernatorial opponant, Richard
Graves, which is par for the course in politics. Knight
described Graves as nothing but a lobbyist, and, using
a guilt-by-association technique, brought in Art
Samish's name also.
After the speech, two students went up to Goodie.
"Excuse me, sir," said one of them, "but I'd like you
to meet Stephen Graves, the son of youi opponent."
Goodie's smile evaporated into a bug-eyed gape.
"Well, ahem, er, ah," stumbled the Governor, "we're
all Americans aren't we? Ha, ha."
* * *
EXTRA STEP DEPT. The instructor of Modern
Dance noticed one of her gym pupils, a Daily l'rosh
pen woman named Helen Dewai (1) take a violent leap
across the floor; (2) reprimanded her for getting out
of step; (3) discovered that Helen had made a bare
looted landing on a hornet.

FACULTY TRESPASSER. It was a glorious, blos
somy spring day, and things were going like things
ought to be going on glorious, blossomy spring days for
journalism instructor James Brinton.
Brinton was taking ;» leisurely stroll through the
Searsville property v/hen suddenly a cop button
holed him. Brinton, it turned out, was trespassing on
property on which there was to be no trespassing, and
the gendarme explained that trespassers were "usually
taken to see the chief."
Brinton, being in a field whose goal it is to express
thoughts persuasively, convinced the cop it was an
honest mistake and got off with a $.90 fine.
* * *
There's something 1 feel kind of strong about (his
morning. Ami il concerns the continuance of for
eign scholarships at Stanford and in the whole coun
try. And it concerns two gentlemen in Washington
named Knowland and Kuchel. And most of all, i(
concerns those of us who have stationery, a six-cent
stamp, and the desire to write our Senators about
the situation.
It seems sort of ironical that the country which is
the most cogent in the world in advertising techniques
is playing a pitiful second in the greatest advertising
campaign of them all —the campaign to advertise its
own merits as opposed to Russian totalitarianism.
I refer to the House vote to slash $6,000,000 from the
1955 International Educational Program. What better
way is there to advertise our merits than to have the
future leaders of foreign countries come here for
schooling and observe our ways of life?
Well, I better cut this before I start to sound Abra
ham Lincolnish. But, as I say, I feel kind otstrong
about this. And all il takes is some stationery and
a six-cent stamp.

Ipana ivory smile while on the Farm, got on rather
a low blow at his gubernatorial opponant, Richard
Graves, which is par for the course in politics. Knight
described Graves as nothing but a lobbyist, and, using
a guilt-by-association technique, brought in Art
Samish's name also.
After the speech, two students went up to Goodie.
"Excuse me, sir," said one of them, "but I'd like you
to meet Stephen Graves, the son of youi opponent."
Goodie's smile evaporated into a bug-eyed gape.
"Well, ahem, er, ah," stumbled the Governor, "we're
all Americans aren't we? Ha, ha."

EXTRA STEP DEPT. The instructor of Modern
Dance noticed one of her gym pupils, a Daily l'rosh
pen woman named Helen Dewai (1) take a violent leap
across the floor; (2) reprimanded her for getting out
of step; (3) discovered that Helen had made a bare
looted landing on a hornet.

FACULTY TRESPASSER. It was a glorious, blos
somy spring day, and things were going like things
ought to be going on glorious, blossomy spring days for
journalism instructor James Brinton.
Brinton was taking ;» leisurely stroll through the
Searsville property v/hen suddenly a cop button
holed him. Brinton, it turned out, was trespassing on
property on which there was to be no trespassing, and
the gendarme explained that trespassers were "usually
taken to see the chief."
Brinton, being in a field whose goal it is to express
thoughts persuasively, convinced the cop it was an
honest mistake and got off with a $.90 fine.

There's something 1 feel kind of strong about (his
morning. Ami il concerns the continuance of for
eign scholarships at Stanford and in the whole coun
try. And it concerns two gentlemen in Washington
named Knowland and Kuchel. And most of all, i(
concerns those of us who have stationery, a six-cent
stamp, and the desire to write our Senators about
the situation.
It seems sort of ironical that the country which is
the most cogent in the world in advertising techniques
is playing a pitiful second in the greatest advertising
campaign of them all —the campaign to advertise its
own merits as opposed to Russian totalitarianism.
I refer to the House vote to slash $6,000,000 from the
1955 International Educational Program. What better
way is there to advertise our merits than to have the
future leaders of foreign countries come here for
schooling and observe our ways of life?
Well, I better cut this before I start to sound Abra
ham Lincolnish. But, as I say, I feel kind otstrong
about this. And all il takes is some stationery and
a six-cent stamp.

FRIDAY ROUNDUP
A lot of persons are excited about Ilowie Dallmar's
return to Stanford as the mentor of the men of bounce,
not the least ol whom is Jake Irwin.
Jake, who shepherds the equipment among other
things, says, "It'll sure be good to see Howie come

back. He took a pair of basket
ball shoes when he left in 1941,
and I'd like to get them back."
