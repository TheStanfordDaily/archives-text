# Stegner Writes On Conservation
## 
### 
Professor Wallace Stegner, head
of the Creative Writing Department,
has written a magazine article that
was published reecntly. But the
magazine in which it appears has no
title, is not for sale either on news
stands or by subscription, and will
never he seen by the public.
Stegner, who is currently on a
leave of absence from the Univer
sity, has written an article titled
"We Are Destroying Our National
Parks." It deals with Yosemite
and a number of other resort
areas that, according to Stegner,
lire being ruined by misuse.
The magazine has been published
by Time Inc., and is an experimen
tal copy of a new weekly sports
magazine. The 100-page issue has
no title and was distributed only to
..ports editors across the nation,
whose advice as to changes is being
sought. A number of other out
standing authors have also contrib
uted to the experimental magazine.
