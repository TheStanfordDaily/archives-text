# Frosh Cindermen Host Stockton JC
## 
### 
Stockton JC's talent-laden track
squad invades Angel Field tomorrow
at 10:30 for a two-way meet with the
Stanford frosh.
Ray Dean's frosh cindermen have
been improving constantly in their
recent meets. If they hit their stride
in this meet, they should be able
to give Stockton a real run for the
money.
Bernie Nelson, the only frosh dual
winner in last week's four-way
meet, can be expected to repeat in
the low hurdles. However, his
strongest competition in the high
jump will probably be from team
mate Phil Fehlen.
In the half-mile, Ford Sims,
Compton's contribution to the frosh,
will be atempting to equal his high
school time of 1:57.8.
Other frosh hopes are George
Burlingham in the mile; Chuck Ince,
220: Bill Carrell. high hurdles;
Frank Hermann, broad jump; Joe
