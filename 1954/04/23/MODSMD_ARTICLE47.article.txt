# Orphans to Race UCLA
## 
### BOB DURAND 
San Pedro Harbor will be the scene of Stanford's orphan crew's
leturn to competition tomorrow morning when they challenge
UCLA in a three-mile race beginning at 11.
The Papoose oarsmen will duel the Brubabes in a preliminary
two-mile encounter starting at 10:30 in the only other race of
the day. ♦

Coached by Harry Buchalter, the
Indian paddlers will be looking for
their second win of the season in
as many outings. The USC varsity
was edged out by the Cards in a
Palo Alto Yacht Harbor race an
April 3.
Since then, the Stanfords have
accepted invitations for the New
port Western Sprint Trials on May
2!), and the Syracuse Regatta at
Syracuse, New* York, on June 19.
Other races for the Indian oars
men include a return duel against
USC, also at San Pedro, on May 8:
a three-way event with Washington
and Oregon State at Corvallis on
May 16; and the Big Race with Cali
fornia on May 22 at the Oakland Es
tuary.
The frosh paddlers, who have al
ready throttled the Southern Cali
fornia junior varsity by six lengths
on April 3, will be rowing for their
second straight victory. The Bruin
yearlings earlier this year dropped
a four-length decision to the USC
frosh boat.
Other races on the Papoose
schedule are dual events with
Oregon State and Cal on May 1(5
and 22 respectively, and an entry
in the Stockton Water Carnival on
May 29. A trip to Syracuse for
the frosh, something unprecedent
ed in Stanford crew history, is
tentative.
