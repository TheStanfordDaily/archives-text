# Rev Com Provides Talent
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
When the lights went up for
the intermission entertainment
at last Saturday night's Toyon
Formal, guests saw excerpts
from the forthcoming Spring
Show, Cole Porter's "Anything
Goes." They also saw Rev Com
in action.
The program was only one of
about 50 such shows that the Re
viewing Committee of Ham's Head
presents all over the Peninsula each
year.
Any group, on or off campus,
wanting entertainment may petition
Rev Com. A show is then made up
from the committees' talent file.
This year Rev Com has provided
intermission programs for such
events as the Frosh Jolly-up, the
Fall Reg Dancc, the Row Carni
val, and the Stern All-Campus
Dancc.
Off-campus shows included pro
ductions for Menlo-Athcrton High,

the Palo Alto Senior Women's Club,
and the Palo Alto Lions Club Com
munity Fair.
On the weekends following the
Spring Show, a Rev Com program,
directed by Paul Burkhardt, will
tour Army bases in California,
Washington, and Oregon.
The Reviewing Committee,
headed by Ram's Head vice-presi
dent Bucket Christensen, is con
stantly on the lookout for talent.
A member attends tryouts for all
University productions to find
promising material.
If any group wants help in put
ting on its own show. Rev Com
will provide direction or technical
assistance.
The committee also loans cos
tumes to individuals or groups and
handles applications to borrow
Speech and Drama Department
stage equipment. A piano rental
service is available.
Those interested in any Rev Com
service or in participating in Rev
Com shows may contact Bucket
Christensen in the Ram's Head of
fice.
