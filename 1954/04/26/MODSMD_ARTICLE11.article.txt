# Card Hitting Beats Bears
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Like Hip Van Winkle 180 years
ago, Stanford's heretofore somnolent. J
hats awakened . . . and the result
was a rude banishment of Califor
nia's baseball team, 12 to .'5, from the
Sunken Diamond on Saturday.
The Indians, who have been dub
bing themselves the v "hitless won
ders," unleashed their previously
muted bats with a 12-hit fury that
unshaekled a trio of Cal pitchers.
The win catapulted Stanford into
a comfortable position in the CIBA
penthouse with a six and two rec
ord. The loss, Cal's fourth in suc
cession, gives the Bears a four-and
five mark.
Ray Young, the smooth starboard
er with the sliding curve, notched
his fourth league triumph, against
no losses. His chief booster was
Warren Goodrich, the mercury
footed shortstop, who muscled out a
triple and three singles in five times
at bat.
The victory for Everett Dean's
men sends them into their most;
crucial week. The Deanmen trek to
Los Angeles this weekend to meet
second - place USC in a double
header. If the Cards can take both,
the.pennant is virtually theirs.
Actually, the whole mess wasn't
decided until the seventh, when
Stanford reached staggering Cal
inoundman Joe Gaggero for a sextet
of runs.
With the Cards leading, 2 to 1,
Mickey Mouse Sid Hall initiated the
attack by singling to left. Captain
Goodrich shot a liner through the
box, and Hall wandered acro'ss a
moment later on third baseman Tom
Dandurand's infield single. Bob
Evans, the left fielder with the Joe
DiMaggio profile, cracked a single
to center, sending in Goody. Dan
durand scooted across a moment
later with the winning run as pep
pery Len Swartz rapped another
single to cetner.
When the dust had lifted at the
end ol the seventh, the score was
8 to 1. The Deanmen, after their
second PCC title in a row, played
sadist by tacking on four more runs
in the eighth. Clint Evans' mob,
just to show that they weren't past
the stage of rigor mortis, added a
.superfluous two in the ninth.

the.pennant is virtually theirs.
Actually, the whole mess wasn't
decided until the seventh, when
Stanford reached staggering Cal
inoundman Joe Gaggero for a sextet
of runs.
With the Cards leading, 2 to 1,
Mickey Mouse Sid Hall initiated the
attack by singling to left. Captain
Goodrich shot a liner through the
box, and Hall wandered acro'ss a
moment later on third baseman Tom
Dandurand's infield single. Bob
Evans, the left fielder with the Joe
DiMaggio profile, cracked a single
to center, sending in Goody. Dan
durand scooted across a moment
later with the winning run as pep
pery Len Swartz rapped another
single to cetner.
When the dust had lifted at the
end ol the seventh, the score was
8 to 1. The Deanmen, after their
second PCC title in a row, played
sadist by tacking on four more runs
in the eighth. Clint Evans' mob,
just to show that they weren't past
the stage of rigor mortis, added a
.superfluous two in the ninth.

Like Hip Van Winkle 180 years
ago, Stanford's heretofore somnolent. J
hats awakened . . . and the result
was a rude banishment of Califor
nia's baseball team, 12 to .'5, from the
Sunken Diamond on Saturday.
The Indians, who have been dub
bing themselves the v "hitless won
ders," unleashed their previously
muted bats with a 12-hit fury that
unshaekled a trio of Cal pitchers.
The win catapulted Stanford into
a comfortable position in the CIBA
penthouse with a six and two rec
ord. The loss, Cal's fourth in suc
cession, gives the Bears a four-and
five mark.
Ray Young, the smooth starboard
er with the sliding curve, notched
his fourth league triumph, against
no losses. His chief booster was
Warren Goodrich, the mercury
footed shortstop, who muscled out a
triple and three singles in five times
at bat.
The victory for Everett Dean's
men sends them into their most;
crucial week. The Deanmen trek to
Los Angeles this weekend to meet
second - place USC in a double
header. If the Cards can take both,
the.pennant is virtually theirs.
