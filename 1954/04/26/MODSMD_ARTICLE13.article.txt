## Excom OK's Results Of Final Tally 
### 
In its briefest meeting of the year
Friday night, the Executive Com
mitter gave, its official blessing to
the ASSU final election results and
postponed its budget session until
May 5.
Election Board chairman Larry
Tarlow announced the election re
turns from the record-setting 3,132
vote, and made the following sug
gestions for future elections:
1. One centralized voting area
2. No voting booth in the Village
3. Use of IBM machines to count
ballots
4. Two-day elections
Tarlow explained that the central
ized voting area set up on the lawn
of tbe Main Library for the final
elections was very efficient and easy
to administer. He suggested elimi
nating the voting booth at the Vil
lage since a two-day election allows
Village students time to vote on
campus. A total of 312 votes were
cast at the Village during the final
election.
An IBM machine was tfoed for the
first time ift the final election to tally
ballots, and Tarlow strongly urged
that it. be used in the future for
greater speed and efficiency.
In his final recommendation for
two-day elections, Tarlow said the
added time brought a steady stream
of voters but no long lines, which
resulted in the largest ASSU elec
tion vote in recent years.
Student Manager John Stahr sug
gested that the budget session be
postponed from April 28 to May 5 to
give Excom members a full week to
go over the budget.
In one other order of business,
Excom approved the appoitnment of
Liz Livadary to Public Relations
Committee.
