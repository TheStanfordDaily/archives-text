# Geneva Today
## 
### 
The Geneva Conference begins today. '
For those who do not know the complexion
and purpose of the conference, we will explain:
It will be attended by representatives of the
Big Fourâ€”Russia, Great Britain, France, and
the United States. Red China is attending as
an "invited" nation. The general theme of the
Conference is the tense situation in the Far
East. The specific goal is the peaceful settle
ment of the Korea armistice and the Indochina
war.
For those who are optimistic about the out
come of the Conference, we mention that:
The Soviet Union and the Western Powers
are ready to do battle over the status of Red
China at the Conference. It is reported that
Russia will demand that China be treated equal
to the Big Four Powers. The State Department
has announced that Dulles will "go home" if
those demands are continued. The East is look

ing for a settlement that will give Communism
a firmer footing in Asia. The West is looking
for a settlement which will keep South Korea
and Indochina out of Communist domination.
For those who are pessimistic about the Con
ference, we note that:
The comparative policies and attitudes of the
East and West will be clarified for public view
at the Conference. The American people may
judge whether or not they approve of the State
Department's claim that Dulles will "get up
and go home" if Russia is insistent on equality
for Red China or on Dulles' statement that he
hopes the Communists attend "in a mood to
purge themselves of their aggression."
And for those who say of the Conference
"who cares," we say:
All of us' should. Especially those of us who
may have to fight in a war in Korea or Indo
china that is not avoided at the Conference
table at Geneva.
