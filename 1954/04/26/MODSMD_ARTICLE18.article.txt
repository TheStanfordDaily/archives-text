To the Editor:
T, too, watched the Army-McCarthy hearings last
Thursday. I saw him ruled against. I heard him say
"I thought I understood these legal procedures ... I
realize I'm learning some new rules."
How any open-minded person could interpret this as
a "sudden flash of honesty . . . pinpointing . . . dis
respect for fair and legal investigation," is beyond me.

To condemn a man for a sarcastic comment seems to
me a waste of The Daily's space.
Your criticism bears a strong resemblance to the
Junior Senator's favorite tactic of twisting the facts.
The next time you comment on Senator Joe, let's hit
him with a logical argument and not the small-time
"witch-huntinu" that makes you look as foolish as he
does. RON CRAWFORD
