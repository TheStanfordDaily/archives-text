# 'Thursday's Fiasco'

To the Editor:
When will the Election Board evei learn? In Thurs
day's fiasco 1 noticed the following violations of elec
tion procedure:
1. A senior voted for Junior Class President.
2. An Election Board poll worker gave advice con
cerning candidates.
3. A candidate's name was misspelled on the ballot.
Can't we ever have one properly executed election

just one please? We are members of the Stanford
student body. We have an active interest in student
government, but we are getting sick and tired of going
back to the polls time after time to cast ballots in an
election that will be invalidated by the ASSU Excom
that same night. Couldn't something please be done?
A couple of poor frustrated voters,
