# Indochina Crucial issue As Geneva Meet Opens
## 
### 
GENEVA, April 25 (UP)—With the Geneva Conference opening
less than 24 hours away, the United States and Britain have noti
lied France that they do not intend to intervene as belligerents in
the Indochina war, high Western sources disclosed tonight.
Secretary of State John Foster Dulles told the French of the
U. S. policy. +"

But the United States prom
ised the French union forces in
Indochina every possible aid short
of actual armed intervention, the
high sources said on the eve of the
Geneva peace conference.
The assurances were said to have
been given to France during talks
among the three Western foreign
ministers in Paris preliminary to the
conference on Indochina and Korea
opening here tomorrow.
Dulles and Foreign Secretary An
thony Eden told Foreign Minister
Georges Bidault last week, inform
ants said, that their countries had
taken all steps short of belligerency
to aid France in Indochina.
During the day before the confer
ence, the United States still was
struggling to line up a solid Western
front. But informants conceded that
Western unity was under a severe
strain—perhaps the greatest on the
eve of any major parley.
The opening of the 19-nation Far
Eastern peace conference will be
held at 3 p.m. (7 a.m. PDT) tomorrow
in the former League of Nations
Council chamber in the gleaming
marble Palace of the Nations over
looking the Lake of Geneva.
Going into the conference at
which Communist China is repre
sented, the United States was un
derstood to have shaped up a posi
tion which could be summarized as
fol lows:

1. Korea. The United States sees
slightly greater hope of reaching
agreement on Korea than on Ger
many in the Big Four confcrence at
Berlin early this year, largely be
cause there are slightly more possi
bilities of concessions by the West.
In particular, the West might agree
to withdrawal of all foreign armed
forces in Korea without seriously
undermining its strategic interests
in the Far East. Withdrawing from
Germany would be impossible with
out wrecking the North Atlantic Al
liance.
2. Indochina. Since France is the
country bearing the brunt of the
conflict, the United States would let
France take the lead in the Indo
china phase of the Geneva confer
ence. If, for instance, France wants
discussion of an Indochina cease-fire
to be placed as an urgent matter at
the top of the conference agenda,
the United States would support
this. The United States also would
follow Frances' wishes on the ques
tion of admitting a Communist Vict
Minh delegation to the conference,
which was opposed strongly by Bao
Dai, Viet Nam chief of state, during
Paris talks with Dulles.
Meanwhile, in Washington Rep.
Alvin M. Bentley said today Presi
dent. Eisenhower will request—and
get—Congressional approval to send
U.S. troops to Indochina if there is
no other way to save the hard
pressed freedom outpost.
The Michigan Republican, a mem
ber of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, emphasized, however,
that the administration "will-do ev
erything in its power not. to have to
send American boys to fight, in the
jungles of Indochina."
Bentley's remarks in a newsletter
came on the heels of reports that
France is convinced il cannot <-on
tinue fighting in Indochina for more
than a few* months without direct
U.S. intervention.
Unusually reliable sources said
they understood the French govern
ment gave this view to Secretary of
State jlohn Foster Dulles as ho
passed through Paris en route to the
Geneva conference.
Meanwhile, Communist siege guns
opened an all-out bombardment of
Dien Bion Plui and Red General Vo
Nguyen Giap boasted in an order of
the day that "the hour of victory has
struck."
fie called on his 40,000-man force
to "finish ofT" the battered and tot
tering French Union defenders.
The third and decisive round of
the greatest battle of the war in
Indochina was reported imminent.
On the eve of the Geneva confer
ence the Reds were bidding for their
supreme conquest.
