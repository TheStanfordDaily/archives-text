# Violation of Duties?'

To the Editor:
Is Stanford University violating one of its major
duties?
Naturally we all believe in the basic values of edu
cation, or we would not be here. It is safe to assume
that the vast majority also uphold the primary princi
ples of democracy.
Education contends that the individual can be led
to better himself through study and contemplation.
Individual integrity is the sacred core of this belief,
as exemplified in the Stanford Honor Code. De
mocracy upholds these rights of the individual, but
specifically guarantees protection to the individual,
both from others and from himself.
A democratic educational institution such as Stan
ford should respect and develop individual integrity,
but should also guarantee protection to the individual.
The Honor Code violates this right of protection by
leading people to assume false safety. We have read
of examination violations, and the disappearance of
books and other personal property. Other events have
not appeared in print. Recently a ring valued at $800
disappeared from a lockerless room in a locked dormi
tory. It is my understanding that incidents similar

to this have occurred in the past. The Library releases
figures at intervals which show an amazing number
of mis ing books. A check with the various University
departments and residences would also yield further
examples of dishonorable conduct. All families have
black sheep, and evidently, the Stanford family is no
exception.
The problem is that the matter ends here. Pawn
shops are notified, while Honor Code discussions con
tinue. The fundamental right of protection is denied.
It, is fruitless to lock the barn door after the horse
has been stolen. Since there are other horses' however,
is it not more fruitless to wait for education to im
prove personal integrity while personal and public
property rights are s® frequently violated? Are we
not imitating the ostrich by worrying whether people
will cheat on examinations, when it is obvious that
some of the same people are thieves?
There are three possiifle answers to this situation:
(1) increase enforcement, (2) eliminate opportunity,
or (.1) both of these.
The Library has taken a step toward elimination by
closing the stacks. Are any other steps going to follow?
