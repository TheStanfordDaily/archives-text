# forty Entries Registered For Annual Spring Sing
## 
### 
Sixty-one groups are represented in the 40 Spring Sing entries
registered last week. Sign-ups closed Thursday.
The annual all-campus songfest will be held Friday, May 21,
in Frost Amphitheater. Frost has been the traditional gathering
place in the 14 years since the first Spring Sing.

Twenty of the 40 entries are"
composed of two or more
groups, following the emphasis
by Spring Sing chairman Harmon
Brown on combining.
For the first time in many years,
four groups, the maximum number
that can combine, will sing together
in one entry. Chi Psi, Lathrop, Phi
Gamma Delta, and Storey will har
monize with "John Henry."
The Stanford Medical School, al
most traditional winner of Spring
•Sings, will defend its men's division
crown against, eight other groups
with "Low Lands." The student
nurses, women's division winners
last spring, have only one competi
tor in that division this year, Roble
Hall.
In the mixed division, however, 19
groups are vying for the trophy held
by Guthrie and Delta Tau Delta.
The 1953 champion in the novelty
division, Theta Delta Chi, is among
the ten groups in that class this
year.
Alpha Delta Phi, which won the
sweepstakes trophy last year with
an original song "Abstracts from
American Cultural Themes, as Ar
ranged by Schroeder"—is entered in
the Sing, but has not yet decided on
its song.
Entries are limited to three min
utes, which may consist of a medley
or one longer song. Any group of
less than 15 must be entered in the
novelty division. Freshmen may
sing only with their living groups—
not with fraternities or ROTC, for
example.
Brown emphasized that groups
which have not yet paid the $2.50
entrance fee should pay in the AS
SU office as soon as possible.
