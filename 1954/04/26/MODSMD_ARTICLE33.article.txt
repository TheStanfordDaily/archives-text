## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
PATTERSON FIELD, Eagle Rock.
April 24— Occidental's orange-clad
track men, primed and ready for
one mighty effort, erupted here
today to ruin Stanford's second ,
junket to the Southland, 78-53.
Oxy fans were particularly pleased
with the performances of distance
man Jim Terrill, who took the 880
and the mile, and quarter-mile win
ner Jon Speer, who also brought
home the baton in the relay.
Terrill took over the mile lead aftei
Card Bob Reed .set the first lap pace
and won like Native Dancer, easing
up and looking back in 4:19.5. Aus
tin Emmerling of Oxy grabbed sec
ond ahead of Reed.
Terrill came back to lead the Tig
j ers to a sweep of the 830 by out
sprinting favorite Ed Shinn as they
came out of the last turn for a 1:53
I clocking. Ev Trader, who was third,
was caught unofficially in 1:54.6.
It was Speer who wrecked Stan
ford hopes in the second track event
of the clay by holding off the finishing
drive of Indian 440 ace Walt Garrett,
j Three Oxy men and Garrett hit tape
| all at once with Oxy nabbing first
and second spots.
In the relay, Garrett started on
his last leg well behind Speer. lit

kept pecking away at the Oxy lead i
and was right as Speer's heels as j
they came out of the turn. But 1
Speer came home in front in 3:16.J 1
to break the meet standard and Gar- j
rett's 47.8 effort was in vain.
Despite the disheartening score.
Stanford had plenty of cheering
news. Of particular importance was
the 10-point contribution of sprinter
Keith Brownsberger.
Brownie, who has had a little dif- ■
ficulty in the 220 this year, dashed in j
ahead of O'xy's Bill Cal ling in both j
the 100 and the furlong. Ht* was
timed in 9.8 in the century to tie
the meet record and 21.8 in the 220 ;
Indian Jim Saras, who nabbed third j
in the 220, was clocked in 22.1.
Roy Smith, the hero of the Tribe's
early-season win over Fresno State,
upset Oxy's trio of broad jumpers
with a .22 ft. 8 :i 4 in. leap.
Leo Long took his expected vic
tory in the javelin at 218 ft. 10 in.
with teammate Bob Kimball second
at 202 It. 1 in., and John Stewart
easily took the blue ribbon in the
high jump at 6 ft. s'/j in.
Gerry Wood, the hustling hurdler,
seemingly loafed over the high
sticks for a 14.5, his fastest time of
the year to set another new meet
| mark. Jim Luttrell was second in

i the highs and won the lows in 24.5 1
But Oxy's come-through- efforts
. turned the tide. Tom Meyer, the
home town favorite, beat Stanford's
A 1 Cheney with his last shot put
of 51 ft. 11 1 a in. Cheney had 51 ft.
, 9 in.
It was in the distance races that
the winners piled up the points. In
addition to 440, 880, and mile, where
; they scored 25 points to Stanford's 2,
' Oxy's Claude Fiddler led a one-two ;
Tiger finish in the two mile.

PATTERSON FIELD, Eagle Rock.
April 24— Occidental's orange-clad
track men, primed and ready for
one mighty effort, erupted here
today to ruin Stanford's second ,
junket to the Southland, 78-53.
Oxy fans were particularly pleased
with the performances of distance
man Jim Terrill, who took the 880
and the mile, and quarter-mile win
ner Jon Speer, who also brought
home the baton in the relay.
Terrill took over the mile lead aftei
Card Bob Reed .set the first lap pace
and won like Native Dancer, easing
up and looking back in 4:19.5. Aus
tin Emmerling of Oxy grabbed sec
ond ahead of Reed.
Terrill came back to lead the Tig
j ers to a sweep of the 830 by out
sprinting favorite Ed Shinn as they
came out of the last turn for a 1:53
I clocking. Ev Trader, who was third,
was caught unofficially in 1:54.6.
It was Speer who wrecked Stan
ford hopes in the second track event
of the clay by holding off the finishing
drive of Indian 440 ace Walt Garrett,
j Three Oxy men and Garrett hit tape
| all at once with Oxy nabbing first
and second spots.
In the relay, Garrett started on
his last leg well behind Speer. lit

kept pecking away at the Oxy lead i
and was right as Speer's heels as j
they came out of the turn. But 1
Speer came home in front in 3:16.J 1
to break the meet standard and Gar- j
rett's 47.8 effort was in vain.
Despite the disheartening score.
Stanford had plenty of cheering
news. Of particular importance was
the 10-point contribution of sprinter
Keith Brownsberger.
Brownie, who has had a little dif- ■
ficulty in the 220 this year, dashed in j
ahead of O'xy's Bill Cal ling in both j
the 100 and the furlong. Ht* was
timed in 9.8 in the century to tie
the meet record and 21.8 in the 220 ;
Indian Jim Saras, who nabbed third j
in the 220, was clocked in 22.1.
Roy Smith, the hero of the Tribe's
early-season win over Fresno State,
upset Oxy's trio of broad jumpers
with a .22 ft. 8 :i 4 in. leap.
Leo Long took his expected vic
tory in the javelin at 218 ft. 10 in.
with teammate Bob Kimball second
at 202 It. 1 in., and John Stewart
easily took the blue ribbon in the
high jump at 6 ft. s'/j in.
Gerry Wood, the hustling hurdler,
seemingly loafed over the high
sticks for a 14.5, his fastest time of
the year to set another new meet
| mark. Jim Luttrell was second in

i the highs and won the lows in 24.5 1
But Oxy's come-through- efforts
. turned the tide. Tom Meyer, the
home town favorite, beat Stanford's
A 1 Cheney with his last shot put
of 51 ft. 11 1 a in. Cheney had 51 ft.

PATTERSON FIELD, Eagle Rock.
April 24— Occidental's orange-clad
track men, primed and ready for
one mighty effort, erupted here
today to ruin Stanford's second ,
junket to the Southland, 78-53.
Oxy fans were particularly pleased
with the performances of distance
man Jim Terrill, who took the 880
and the mile, and quarter-mile win
ner Jon Speer, who also brought
home the baton in the relay.
Terrill took over the mile lead aftei
Card Bob Reed .set the first lap pace
and won like Native Dancer, easing
up and looking back in 4:19.5. Aus
tin Emmerling of Oxy grabbed sec
ond ahead of Reed.
Terrill came back to lead the Tig
j ers to a sweep of the 830 by out
sprinting favorite Ed Shinn as they
came out of the last turn for a 1:53
I clocking. Ev Trader, who was third,
was caught unofficially in 1:54.6.
It was Speer who wrecked Stan
ford hopes in the second track event
of the clay by holding off the finishing
drive of Indian 440 ace Walt Garrett,
j Three Oxy men and Garrett hit tape
| all at once with Oxy nabbing first
and second spots.
In the relay, Garrett started on
his last leg well behind Speer. lit

kept pecking away at the Oxy lead i
and was right as Speer's heels as j
they came out of the turn. But 1
Speer came home in front in 3:16.J 1
to break the meet standard and Gar- j
rett's 47.8 effort was in vain.
Despite the disheartening score.
Stanford had plenty of cheering
news. Of particular importance was
the 10-point contribution of sprinter
Keith Brownsberger.
Brownie, who has had a little dif- ■
ficulty in the 220 this year, dashed in j
ahead of O'xy's Bill Cal ling in both j
the 100 and the furlong. Ht* was
timed in 9.8 in the century to tie
the meet record and 21.8 in the 220 ;
Indian Jim Saras, who nabbed third j
in the 220, was clocked in 22.1.
Roy Smith, the hero of the Tribe's
early-season win over Fresno State,
upset Oxy's trio of broad jumpers
with a .22 ft. 8 :i 4 in. leap.
Leo Long took his expected vic
tory in the javelin at 218 ft. 10 in.
with teammate Bob Kimball second
at 202 It. 1 in., and John Stewart
easily took the blue ribbon in the
high jump at 6 ft. s'/j in.
Gerry Wood, the hustling hurdler,
seemingly loafed over the high
sticks for a 14.5, his fastest time of
the year to set another new meet
| mark. Jim Luttrell was second in

i the highs and won the lows in 24.5 1
But Oxy's come-through- efforts
. turned the tide. Tom Meyer, the
home town favorite, beat Stanford's
A 1 Cheney with his last shot put
of 51 ft. 11 1 a in. Cheney had 51 ft.
, 9 in.
It was in the distance races that
the winners piled up the points. In
addition to 440, 880, and mile, where
; they scored 25 points to Stanford's 2,
' Oxy's Claude Fiddler led a one-two ;
Tiger finish in the two mile.
