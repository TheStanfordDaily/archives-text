# P.S.T. Bows Out; Confusion Attends New Time System
## 
### 
Reliable old P.S.T. went off on
his annual vacation yesterday
morning, leaving the shop in the
hands of P.D.T. and a certain
amount of confusion in his wake.
For the benefit of those who came
in late (because they set the clock
the wrong way), we're talking about
Pacific Daylinht Saving Time, the
student's friend that allows volley
ball after dinner.
And we also remind you, if you
didn't set your clock ahead one hour
when you went to bed Saturday
night, you'd better do it now, and
heed well the story of the guy who
set his clock back, got to church at
1 p.m., thinking it was 11 a.m., and
wondered why no one was there.
Those lamenting the hour lost in
the process of the shuffle will take
consolation in knowing that P.S.T.
will return, bringing the lost hour i
back, in the fall.
