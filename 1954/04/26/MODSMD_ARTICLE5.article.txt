ism versus colonialism—is told by

ference in Geneva to discuss the
whole Asiatic situation.

scription of IndoChinese political
structure, points up the strategic
and ideological dilemma which this
country faces in Southeastern Asia.
The dilemma itself is outlined in

communism or alienating France,
anrl, second, the American wish to
help France in Indochina France
representing the anti - Communist
stand opposed to America's natu
ral anti-colonialist position.
Behind this latter problem lies the
fact thai the Communist movement
and tlm nationalist movement, in In
dochina have come to be apparently
nearly identical. The United States
laces conflict between a wish to help
the cause of freedom and a wish to
check the threat, of communism.

of her material from Vietnamese
and French sources while resident
in France, calls the war one of the
gravest problems confronting die
United States today, and points out
that there is no easy solution to the
crisis.
She discusses the setup in Indo
china before French rule, the impact
of the French influx, and the sig
nificance of World War II in break
ing the continuity of the French
rule and reshaping its form. She
goes on to discuss all phases and
latest developments of the current
struggle for power.
Miss Hammer has served in New
York as a researcher at the Council

stitute of Pacific Relations.
