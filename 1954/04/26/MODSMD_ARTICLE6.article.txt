# VA HOSPITAL
## Stanford Is Unofficially Chosen Site 
### 
The proposed $23 million Vet
erans Administration psychia
tric hospital will be located on
Stanford land, according to an
nouncements made Friday by
Congressman Charles S. Gubser
and unofficial reports from the
VA in Washington. No official
proposal has been received by
University officials.
The 1,000-bed hospital would be
built on about 200 acres in the'area
bounded by Page Mill Road, Juni
pero Sena Boulevard, Matadero
Creek, and the western city limits of
Palo Alto.
Stanford cannot sell this'property
except, through a condemnation suit
because of provisions in the found
ing grant. The reported price set
for the land is $5,000 an acre. The
VA agency has said that there is
sufficient money to purchase the
land and begin construction without,
delay.
Frederick Glover, assistant to the
president, said yesterday that there
is no question of the fact that the
VA has decided on this plan, but, it
is still unofficial. The decision was
unexpected, Glover commented, be
cause the recent reports have been
that the Stanford site had been
ruled out.
If official word is received in time,
the plan will be considered by the
Board of Trustees in the May 20
meeting. "There are advantages and
disadvantages, and these will be
fairly considered by the Board," said
Glover.
The hospital will probably take
two and a half years to complete.
Preliminaries such as contract issu
ance and land purchase will take
six to nine months, and construction
[will take about two years.
Carroll Peake, Western regional
information officer for the VA, said
he assumes the hospital will be sim
ilar to one now under construction
in Los Angeles. That, one has a cen
tral four-story administration wing
with surrounding two-story wards.
Frank Hevern, assistant manager
of the Menln Park VA Hospital, said
that a mental hospital would not be
a hazard to neighboring communi
ties. Elopers, as the VA terms pa
tients who go AWOL, arc a negli
gible problem, according to Hevern.
