# Chamber Music Recital Lauded
## 
### BARNEY CHILDS 
The sixth in the year's series of
chamber music concerts was pre
sented yesterday to a disappoint
ingly small audience; those who
took the trouble to attend were,
however, well rewarded.
Ravel's only string quartet is a
landmark in the literature and pro
vides, along with Debussy's quar
tet, perhaps the "classic" example of
"impressionism" in chamber music.
It was played yesterday by Ray- j
mond Vaught and Amnon Gold- j
worth, violins, Sandor Salco, viola,
and Kathryn Vaught, 'cello, and the
performance was close enough to
professional calibcr that it could
be judged favorably by professional j
standards.
Ensemble is immensely important
in performing this work, and the
group, although usually led by Mr.
.Vaught, played so well as a unit j
that it made the most of Ravel's al- |
most orchestral color and sometimes '
involved rhythms.
T found the nervous "fives" in the
last movement compelling and au- j
thoritative, and the quartet's ap- j
proach in this direction seems to
clarify the soporific mood induced
by the third movement, which can
be outright dull if musicians let so
nority tempt them away from over
all line.
Four madrigals by the Elizabethan
masters Morlev and Wilbye were
convincingly presented by the Uni
versity Singers under Herbert B.
Nanney's direction. I still could do
with fewer voices; such fast syllabic
sections as the first part of the mild- |
ly erotic "Sweet Honey - sucking !
Bees" are apt. to blur, destroying j
the intimacy of the counterpoint, i
The Singers' intonation lias im
proved immensely since their first
appearance here last autumn.
Edward Colby's "Divertissement
for Clarinet, Saxophone, and Bas-j
soon" received a sympathetic and
capable first performance. Its wry
humor and competent instrumenta
tion offset the derivative nature of
its approach. The sustained move
ment has considerable harmonic
beauty and strength.
