measuring Tapes
tin every industry engineers need specialized
measuring equipment — that is why Lufkin, world
wide specialist in measuring devices, makes nearly
8,000 different tapes, rules, and precision tools.
In highway, railroad, oil, mining, surveying,
forestry, and construction work, engineers specify
Lufkin "Chrome Clad" steel measuring tapes to
get the most on-the-job durability. In swamp,
brush, desert, gravel pits, and wherever a tough
dependable tape is an absolute must, Lufkin
"Michigan" babbitt metal chain tapes are pre
ferred. City engineers and construction engineers
use the Lufkin "Wolverine." The line in the Lufkin
"Western" is the same weight as chain tapes, but
subdivided throughout, making it ideal for heavy
field work. Lufkin "Lucas" mine tapes resist rust
and corrosion. In the oil fields "Chrome Clad" tapes
are standard as they withstand hard use, fumes,
and corrosion — they are used for gaging, tank
strapping, and measuring standing casing.
When you go out on the job specify Lufkin
measuring tapes — you will find one for your every
,-v measuring need. Send today for your free catalog,
