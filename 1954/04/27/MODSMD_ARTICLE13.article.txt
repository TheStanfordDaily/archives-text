MOSCOW, April 26 (UP) â€”Pre-
mier Georgi Malenkov warned to
day that if the West attacks Russia
with atom boftibs it will be "crushed
by the same weapon."
Malenkov charged that the United
States and its allies are maintaining
an atmosphere of war hysteria and
threatening the world with the hy
drogen bomb.
"If the aggressive circles, banking
on the atomic weapon, should resort
to madness and should want to test
the strength and might of the Soviet
Union, there can be no doubt that
the aggressor would be crushed by
the same weapon and that such an
adventure would inevitably lead to
the ruin of the capitalist social sys
tem," he declared.
