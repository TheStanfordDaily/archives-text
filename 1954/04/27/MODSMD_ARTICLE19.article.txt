# West Blocks Red Move At Geneva Conference
## 
### 
GENEVA, April 26 (UP)—The West blocked Big Power status
for Red China at the Far Eastern Conference here today in an
East-West agreement staving off a major crisis at the start of the
19-nation parley.
Soviet Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov compromised on his

demand for recognition of China as
a major power. He agreed to plan
for rotating the conference chair
manship among a three-man panel,
shutting out the Chinese Commu
nists.
Despite agreement on one major
issue, an air of tension hung over
the opening day, heightened by the
worsening military situation for the
French in Indochina. The day saw
these developments:
1. A high American source dis
closed that the Eisenhower ad
ministration had considered ask
ing Congress to permit military
intervention in Indochina but had
dropped the plan when Britain re
fused to go along.
2. French Foreign Minister
Georges Bidault, in an "appeal to
the conscience of the civili/.ed
world," asked for a truce to en
able evacuation of 1,000 French
wounded in the besieged Indo
china fortress of Dien Bien Phu.
After sidestepping the Chinese is
sue, the conference got off to a slow
start in a 40 - minute session. The
delegates, meeting in the green and
gray conference chamber once in
habited by the League of Nations,
agreed that:
1. The chairmanship, which
Communist China had hoped to
share on a basis of equality with
the Big Four, would rotate among
a three-man panel made up of the
foreign ministers of Thailand,
Russia, and Britain.
2. The discussion of the Korean
problem, the top item on the pro
gram, would begin tomorrow.
Despite today's compromise, Mo -
lotov indicated Russia still backed
Red China's claim to equality by
snubbing an invitation to a Big Four
cocktail party from which the Chi
nese were excluded.
The affair, held after the general
conference session, was given by
French Foreign Minister Georges
Bidault. A Soviet official telephoned
Molotov's regrets after word circu
lated that Chinese Foreign Minister
Chou En-lai had not been invited.
Western officials saw only one ex
planation — that Molotov was not
prepared to attend any Big Four
get-together from which Chou was
barred.
The three Western Ministers
drank their cocktails without bene
fit of Communist company. They
discussed procedural matters, in
cluding the question of the makeup
of the conference when it takes up
Indochina.
Later Molotov agreed to meet
alone with Bidault tomorrow to dis
cuss the same matter.
Russia's quick capitulation on the
recognition of Red China came as a
surprise to the Westerners, who had
feared the issue would explode and
threaten the conference at its outset.
Dulles had warned in advance
that he would walk out of the con
ference rather than sit under a Red
Chinese chairman.
Two additional rebuffs were de
livered to the Chinese.
In his opening speech as chairman,
Prince Wan Waithayakon of Thai
land referred pointedly to the four
inviting powers—a rating the Chi
nese had tried to get for themselves.
The first, working session of the
conference in the Palace of Nations
will open tomorrow at 7 a.m. PDT.
In Washington today President
Eisenhower expressed hope that the
Geneva conference can reach at
least a temporary settlement of ox
plosive East - West differences in
Asia — including the bloody Indo
china war.
The President expressed his hope
for a settlement at Geneva in a
speech to the U.S. Chamber of Com
merce. He said a single surprise at
tack launching an atomic war might
be "almost a decisive act." There
fore, he said, it is imperative that
world problems be settled without
becoming a "major catastrophe."
