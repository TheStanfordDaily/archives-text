# Fisher Sees Compromise On Indochina
## 
### BARBARA TUERK 
The current Geneva confer
ence is more likely to bring a
compromise settlement of the
Indochinese war than reunifica
tion of Korea, Harold H. Fisher,
chairman of the Hoover Insti
tute and Library, told a Political
Union Democrats meeting last
night in Bowman Alumni House.
Dr. Fisher outlined the following
possible compromise settlement for
Indochina.
1. Cease-fire.
2. Establishment of a divided
Indochina, divided at the six
teenth parallel (the line used hy
British and Chinese for disarma
ment after World War II).
Complete independence for
Viet Nam. with autonomy for the
Communist-held region.
4 A regional security pact of
nations committed to defend In-

dochina, Burma, Thailand, and
Malaya against further aggression
by the Communists.
"It may not be what we'd like,"
Dr. Fisher commented, "but we may
have to take what we can get."
The noted historian said he did
not believe that the United States
would enter the Indochinesc war
unilaterally.
"The administration has been
testing public opinion," he said,
"and opinion in Congress and the
country is strongly against any en
try into the Indochinese war."
Because of world opinion, neither
side can refuse to compromise at
Geneva, Dr. Fisher explained.
"Refusal to compromise at Ge
neva would hurt the West tre
mendously," he said. "Most peo
ple everywhere want peace. Eu
ropeans and Asians fear that the
U.S. wants solution by force, and
isn't interested in any peaceful
settlement"
"On the other hand," lie con
tinued. "the Communists could
not turn down a fair settlement
without losing much of their sup
port in Southeast Asia."
Dr. Fisher .was less optimistic
about hopes for a settlement in Ko
rea. He said that the Communists
are likely to agree to free elections
in Korea only if a half-Communist
half-Rhee government were set up
lust, "the same arrangement we've
already rejected for Germany."
The Hoover Library's expert on
Communism termed recognition of
Red China a "phony issue" for the
Russians.
"My own hunch is that Russia
doesn't want China recognized," he
explained. Now they can be
spokesmen for the Chinese at inter
national gatherings. China won't
ever consent to be a satellite of Rus
sia, as other Communist nations are.
Only under tlie present arrangement
can Russia speak internationally for
China."
Dr Fisher rejected as unrealistic
a suggestion thai wo might set. up
a five-year over Indo
china, with India, Burma, and Thai
land as trustees. "The trustees
wouldn't be in a position to enforce
their rulings," he said.
"We tend to think of the Asian
problem too much in military
terms," Dr. Fisher generalized. "If
we'd spend the dollars and skills we
are spending on war in Indochina
on a developmental program, we
might build a strong non-Commu
nist state in Indochina."
If independence were i*iven to
Indochina, he added, Ho Chi Minh
might lose much of his nationalistic
support. "People aren't too happy
under the Communists," he said.
However, as a leader for an in
dependent Indochina, Dr. Fisher be
lieved that Bao Dai might "be im
proved upon."
