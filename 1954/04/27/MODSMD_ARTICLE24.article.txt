# What's the Matter With Stanford?

It started up in Washington, just a local dis
ease.
But it's quickly assuming epidemic propor
tions, spreading like wildfire as hapless author
ities term it "out of control." Cases have been
reported in Florida, in Wisconsin, in Canada,
in Los Angeles—and more every day.
Baffled local officials have called for help
from scientists, from the Federal Bureau of In
vestigation, even from the Atomic Energy Com
mission.
All over the country motorists are reporting
new onslaughts of "windshield pox"—mys
terious pock-marks, cracks, chips, scratches,
mars, pits, and blemishes that are appearing as
if by magic in windshields.

It's the most intriguing mystery since flying
saucers.
And what part is Stanford playing in the na
tional dilemma? None.
Not one motorist here has reported pox in his
windshield. Not one professor has stepped for
ward to offer a solution for the baffled public.
We might attribute Stanford's inactivity to
student apathy or ivory-towerism. But we fear
an even more disturbing conclusion — that
over-emphasis on the scientific spirit has
blighted our credulity.
Let's face it—7,ooo students and 5,000 cars,
and not one case of windshield pox. Just no
fun at all, any more.
