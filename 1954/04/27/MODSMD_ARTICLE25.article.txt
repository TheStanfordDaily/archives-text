# BULL SESSION

### JACK BYRNE 
Some weeks back, while describing the horrors of
ol that architectural abomination called Woodpecker
Lodge, I digressed from the point at hand to discuss
the "Bach Bat," a denizen of the City of Carmel who
has ;i greater love for Bach than

this writer.
I was willing to let it go at
that, but it appears that the public
has other ideas. Just the other
day 1 was strolling through the
basement of the Ed Building.
Tley!" came a voice.
"Me?"
"You. You're the guy stuffs
a pipe in his face and claims not
to like Bach."
It was at this point that I knew

1 had a Bach addict on my hands. He wore heavy
i immed glasses and pronounced Bach with the final
en stretched till it sounded like he were clearing
hi . throat previous to expectoration. CI have alwavs
favored the "Bock" approach, like in the beer of the
same name.)
I admit to all of this," I replied, "and take a certain
amount of pride in my taste."
fie gave the external appearance of one who has
just seen a man beating a seeing-eye dog.

"What do you like?" quoth he.
"Oh, Beethoven, Brahms, even Vivaldi on occa
sions, but I can't say that I like to sit down and listen
to Bach. Not," I added, "that I'm not saying that 1
might not get to like him some day."
"Tell me," he said, with a condescending expression,
"how long have you been listening to music? Three
days or four?"
I managed to overlook this, and a rather nice-look
ing red-headed secretary who was listening in an
nounced she wasn't hot for Bach either. Again our
friend cringed. She continued:
"When Bach comes on, I turn the radio off."
What, you ask, is the point, of all this? I am merely
asserting, and I don't think I'm the first guy to try,
that a person can be kind, decent, good to his mother,
live, die, enjoy lots of good music, and still not be
fond of Bach. If anyone's convinced, see me about
.membership in the "Keep Bach Uridyl Lock (and key)
Club."
No one is denied entrance. If you once liked Bach,
we won't hold it against you. If you gel to the point
where you decide that you like Bach, you may leave
quietly, and we will never tell on you and your in
glorious past.
