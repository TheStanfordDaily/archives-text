To the Editor:
Recent letters to the editor regarding the coming
I<> Stanford of Petar Macanovic suggest that I should
have stated my reason for "calling Macanovic a Com
munist. I was told by a member of the Foreign Schol
arship Committee that the committee consulted Pro
fessor Wayne Vucinich, an expert on Balkan affairs,
as to whether or not Macanovic is likely to be a Com
munist. Professor Vucinich said that in his opinion
there can be almost no doubt that Macanovic is, in fact,
a Communist. I therefore do not think I am unjusti
fied in referring to Macanovic as a Communist.
We ail agree that it will be fascinating to exchange

ideas with a bona fide Communist. But if the inter
change ol ideas at Stanford is the only purpose of the
foreign scholarship program, why do we insist that
our ASSU foreign scholars return lo their countries
at the end of each year? Why don't we urge them to
stay on in America year after year so that Americans
everywhere might have a chance to exchange ideas
with them? If that is the only purpose of the program
let's admit it now. Let's stop the masquerade. And
lets start considering the possibility of reducing our
annual appropriation to the foreign scholarship pro
gram.
