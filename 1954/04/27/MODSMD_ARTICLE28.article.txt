## Stanford Publishes Student Collection 
### ELIZABETH WILEY 
There is a laboratory on the Stanford campus which has as its
object of study not a frog's heart nor the hydrogen atom, but,
through the medium of fiction, the interpretation of human expe
rience. Out of this lab has come a yearly collection of short stories
by Stanford's best creative writing students, some of them pro
fessional writers, others compara- ♦

tive beginners.
The 1954 volume contains 11 sto
ries, by nine writers. They illustrate
and verify individual discoveries
about man's view both of himself
and his personal world, and they re
veal varying attempts to define and
re-order human motives and values
into art form.
Simin Daneshvar, Fulbright
scholar from Iran, writes in "A Let
ter Home" (her first story in the
English language) of a young Iran
ian girl who yearns for a tranquil
lile free from cruelty and ugliness.
"Come to me as soon as possible or
else I will die or turn mad in this
foreign city," pleads Goli. "The
shoes that you bought for me are
torn into pieces. I have no under
wear, nothing." But reflected in the
girl's desperation are the positive
human powers of compassion and
humility. These are communicated
to another hope-lost human being,
who sees in the girl dh essential
beauty and wonder.
Marvin Schiller's "Now Is the
Time" describes the irreconcilable
discrepancies growing in a young
boy's mind: if he cannot trust his
grandfather, how can lie love him
and his world? Little Mark discov
ers that human evils and goods are
part of one substance, each contrib
uting to the other, and both requir
ing judgment.
Hannah Green's "The Grey Bird"
circumscribes a girl's absorption in
the perfect yet tenuous images of

her mind. These realities at once
delight and threaten her.
"Inge," by Bernard Taper, who
writes for the San Francisco Chron
icle, tells of a German girl's psycho
logical need for submission. Taper
comments that Hitler is used "in a
crucial way as part of the meaning
of the story." It appeared first in
the Pacific Spectator, as did Mary
Lucile Dawkins' and Simin Danesh
var's stories.
"Night on Octavia Street" by Jean
Byers, former writing instructor :it
Stanford, evolves from the materials
of night, fear, and the conflicting
human\adaptations to both.
Constance Crawford's "The Silver
Spoons," published first in Made
moiselle, describes an American
tourist in war-ravaged England who
must share something of herself he
lore accepting some ol the responsi
bility for another's predicament.
In the preface, Wallace Stegner,
head of the Creative Writing Cen
ter, remarks, that if the writers "had
not been so individual they would
not have been so satisfying a group:
they would not have been able to
create so healthy a literary society
for themselves within the larger
framework of the University." " The
student will appreciate, in reading
this volume, the seriousness of the
authors' attitude toward their mate
rial, and the relative degree of per
ceptivity in their literary discov
eries.

eries.
There is a laboratory on the Stanford campus which has as its
object of study not a frog's heart nor the hydrogen atom, but,
through the medium of fiction, the interpretation of human expe
rience. Out of this lab has come a yearly collection of short stories
by Stanford's best creative writing students, some of them pro
fessional writers, others compara- ♦

tive beginners.
The 1954 volume contains 11 sto
ries, by nine writers. They illustrate
and verify individual discoveries
about man's view both of himself
and his personal world, and they re
veal varying attempts to define and
re-order human motives and values
into art form.
Simin Daneshvar, Fulbright
scholar from Iran, writes in "A Let
ter Home" (her first story in the
English language) of a young Iran
ian girl who yearns for a tranquil
lile free from cruelty and ugliness.
"Come to me as soon as possible or
else I will die or turn mad in this
foreign city," pleads Goli. "The
shoes that you bought for me are
torn into pieces. I have no under
wear, nothing." But reflected in the
girl's desperation are the positive
human powers of compassion and
humility. These are communicated
to another hope-lost human being,
who sees in the girl dh essential
beauty and wonder.
Marvin Schiller's "Now Is the
Time" describes the irreconcilable
discrepancies growing in a young
boy's mind: if he cannot trust his
grandfather, how can lie love him
and his world? Little Mark discov
ers that human evils and goods are
part of one substance, each contrib
uting to the other, and both requir
ing judgment.
Hannah Green's "The Grey Bird"
circumscribes a girl's absorption in
the perfect yet tenuous images of

her mind. These realities at once
delight and threaten her.
"Inge," by Bernard Taper, who
writes for the San Francisco Chron
icle, tells of a German girl's psycho
logical need for submission. Taper
comments that Hitler is used "in a
crucial way as part of the meaning
of the story." It appeared first in
the Pacific Spectator, as did Mary
Lucile Dawkins' and Simin Danesh
var's stories.
"Night on Octavia Street" by Jean
Byers, former writing instructor :it
Stanford, evolves from the materials
of night, fear, and the conflicting
human\adaptations to both.
Constance Crawford's "The Silver
Spoons," published first in Made
moiselle, describes an American
tourist in war-ravaged England who
must share something of herself he
lore accepting some ol the responsi
bility for another's predicament.
In the preface, Wallace Stegner,
head of the Creative Writing Cen
ter, remarks, that if the writers "had
not been so individual they would
not have been so satisfying a group:
they would not have been able to
create so healthy a literary society
for themselves within the larger
framework of the University." " The
student will appreciate, in reading
this volume, the seriousness of the
authors' attitude toward their mate
rial, and the relative degree of per
ceptivity in their literary discov
eries.
