## Surprising Bruins Stun Varsity Crew By 15 Lengths at San Pedro Harbor 
### BOB DURAND 
SAN PEDRO HARBOR, April 24—A surprising UCLA varsity crew came from behind this morn
ing to stun the Stanford first boat by a 15-length margin in a three-mile race held in the outer
harbor.
The Bruins winning time for the- course was 18:45.3. It was the first time since the war that the
Indian oarsmen had lost to the Uclans.
Rowing under partly cloudy skies and with good water conditions, both crews started with a

34 stroke and the Cards pulled
ahead to a half-length lead at the
three-quarter mark. UCLA, how
ever, settled into a steady 32 and
soon began to close the gap.
While Stanford lowered their beat
to a 28 during the second mile, the
Bruins, stroked by Ward Morris,
opened one and a half lengths of
open„ water between the two shells
at the half-way point.
At the two-mile marker, the Uc
lans, still rowing a steady 32, were
increasing their lead fast over the
surprised Indians, who were stroked
by Bob Margolis. The winners
crossed the finish line still going
away.
In a preliminary race, UCLA
made it a clean sweep of the day
when the Bruhahes upset the Card
frosh s we e ps w in g e r s by two
lengths over a two-mile course.
The winning lime was 13:01.5.
