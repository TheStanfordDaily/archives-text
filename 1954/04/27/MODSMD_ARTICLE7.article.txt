# Stevens Ordered to Prove Validity of Carr Charges
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 26 (UP)â€”Army Secretary Robert T. Stev
ens was ordered by Senate investigators today to withdraw his
charges against one of the principals in the Army-McCarthy row
unless he can back them up.
The order came at the close of a stormy session at which Stevens

denounced as in "unequivocal lie"
the charge by Sen. Joseph R. Mc-
Carthy that Stevens tried to divert
McCarthy's Red hunt to the Navy
and Air Force.
McCarthy, Acting Chairman Karl
E. Mundt (R., S.D.), and other mem
bers of the Senate Investigating sub
committee tried to pin Stevens down
on charges involving. Francis P.
Carr, the subcommittee staff direc
tor.
Carr has been accused along with
McCarthy and Chief Counsel Roy M.
Cohn of improperly pressuring the
Army to give favored treatment for
Pvt. G.. David Schine, another Mc-
Carthy aide who was drafted.
Stevens, who underwent his most
trying time in three days of testi
mony, could give few details about
Carr from his personal knowledge.
He said, however, that the testi
mony of later witnesses "would im
plicate him far more than any tes
timony of mine."
Mundt told Stevens, "You owe it
to the committee and to Mr. Carr
either to say that in so far as your
own personal knowledge is con
cerned you absolve him of charges
of improper treatment, or that you
specify the way and time in which
he was improper."
"Well, I will have to do a little
thinking about that," Stevens said.
"You may think," Mundt replied.
"You mean I have to think right
now?" Stevens asked.
"Yes," Mundt said. "Mr. Carr is
being charged right now and I think
you should be specific about it.."
The hearing proceeded but in ad
journing the session until tomorrow,
Mundt asked Stevens pointedly if
"you are going to search your mind
concerning Mr. Carr and in the
morning either particularize the
charge or withdraw it."
"I am certainly going to search my
mind and try to do that," Stevens
replied.
In earlier testimony, Stevens de
nied under oath that the Army used
Schine as a "hostage" to discourage
McCarthy's inquiry into alleged Red
infiltration at the Army's Fort Mon
mouth, N.J., radar center.
Fighting at times to control his
temper, Stevens conceded he tried
to get the Wisconsin Republican to
suspend the Fort Monmouth, N.J.,
security investigation and let the
Army take over.
But he said this was only because
McCarthy gave a "very unfair" pic
ture of the situation there with his
"constant hammering in the head
lines." He said he made clear that
McCarthy could renew the inquiry
jf McCarthy felt the Army's investi
gation was "unsatisfactory."
Stevens testified for the third day
at hearings by the Senate Investi
gating subcommittee into the
Army's charges that McCarthy and
Roy M. Cohn, his chief counsel,
used "improper means" to seek fa
vored treatment for Schine.
Special Counsel Ray H. Jenkins'
questioning turned abruptly sharper
as ho began the so-called "cross
examination" phase which involved
McCarthy's counter-charges.
He demanded to know if Stevens
had been "especially nice and con
siderate and tender to this boy
Schine to persuade the Senator to
desist" in the investigation.
"Positively and completely not,"
replied Stevens.
