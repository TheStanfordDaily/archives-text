# FIRST ACTION
## IFC Fines Phi Delts, Kappa Sigs 
### 
Using its new disciplinary
powers for the first time, the
Interfraternity Council voted
last night to fine Kappa Sigma
and Phi Delta Theta fraternities
for disturbances on the Row
earlier in the month.
The Kappa Sigs were fined $150
with $50 suspended for using pro
fane language, and the Phi Delts
were fined $350 with $100 suspended
for throwing bottles.
The IFC action supported the rec
ommendations of the temporary ju
diciary committee which reviewed
the two cases last week.
The judiciary committee, headed
by chairman Harvey Hiber, a Fiji,
studied the reports of the police of
ficers who handled the cases and lis
tened to evidence presented by Po
lice Chief Gordon Davis, Kappa Sig
president Gordon Galloway, and
Phi Delt president Greg Peterson.
The committee found that on
April 28 at 9:20 the Kappa Sigs had
used profane language when a po
liceman pulled another car to the
curb in front of Russell House.
in the Phi Delt case the reports of
both the police and the house presi
dent corroborated the fact that the
Phi Delts had thrown bottles from
the roof endangering pedestrians
who were walking on the other side
of the street on the evening of
April 8.
Hiber said that the difference in
the amount of the fines resulted
from the fact that the committee felt
that bottle-throwing was a far more
dangerous and serious offense than
shouting and using profane lan
guage.
Last night's action, as arc all IFC
decisions, is subject to the approval
of President J. E. Wallace Sterling.
