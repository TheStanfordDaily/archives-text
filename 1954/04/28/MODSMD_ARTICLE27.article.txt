# The 						VA Hospital

### 
The government's decision to locate a $23
million V-eterans Administration Hospital on
Stanford property presents several advantages
to the University and the entire surrounding
area which should be considered by University
officials in acting upon acceptance of the pro
posal.
One of the main economic advantages pre
sented is the job of building the hospital. Labor
officials have estimated that construction of the
project will create from 2,500 to 3,000 jobs for
workers in the the various construction crafts.
In addition, the hospital would have an esti
mated annual payroll of $3,750,000, most of
which would find its way back into the local
economy. Several hundred thousand dollars
would also be spent in this area for supplies
for the hospital.
Equally as important as these economic ben
efits, the hospital would bring medical and

psychiatric experts to the area, and would pro
vide an additional source of study cases for the
Stanford Medical School when it has com
pleted its move to the campus.
The primary objection to locating the hos
pital here is a fear of escaped mental patients.
The assistant manager of the nearby Menlo
Park VA Hospital says the problem of "elop
ers" is a negligible one. Most of the escapees,
he says, are patients with grounds privileges
who are well on their way to recovery.
The hospital will not be located in a residen
tial district, but rather in an area zoned for the
development of light industry. For these reas
ons, we can see no reason for undue apprehen
sion over the police problem.
We applaud the VA's decision to locate here,
and hope that University officials will recog
nize the advantages which the proposal pre
sents.
