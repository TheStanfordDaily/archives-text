Three years have gone by, Yes, the sun's come up
over a thousand times; summers and winters have

cracked the mountains a little bit
more, and the rains have brought

before have begun talking regu
lar sentences already. And &
numbei' of people who thought
they were right young and spry
have noticed that they can't
bound up a flight of stairs like
they used to without their hearts
fluttering a little. Some older

sons are sitting at the head of the table, and some
people I know are having their meat cut up for
them—all that can happen in a thousand days.
