# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Now that the rush and roar of campaigning has
drawn to a close, I would like to voice a few after
thoughts which have grown out of the recent student
body elections. In the first place, I do not interpret
the results as an endorsement of any particular stand
on the many issues which were batted about among
the candidates. There was a sufficient split in the
voting to indicate that student opinion was not mass
mobihzed in support of any particular program; more
than this, my personal experience as a candidate
for ASSU president demonstrated to me that issues
such as NSA, Honor Code, etc., were important to
only a small number of students. Those who under
stood them we re even fewer.
This brings me to what is probably the most com
pelling reason for writing this letter. Now that stu
dents have had University affairs practically forced
down their throats by candidates (and there were
enough of them) thumping the tables at mealtime
while demanding the right "to say a few words,"
now that interest has been aroused at least to the
extent of acknowledging that a student government
does exist —now is the time to follow up that awak
ened interest by bringing the problems of govern
ment out into the open so that everyone can see them
and contribute to their solution.
And there are many problems, only a few of which
1 can deal with here. What, for instance, should be
done about Stanford's membership in the National
Students' Association? Can the brief and somewhat
haphazard trial we have given it justify an automatic
withdrawal because the winning presidential candi
date campaigned against it? I found as I talked to
people on all class levels in the University that this
issue is probably misunderstood more than any
other in the basic aspects of NSA's aims and costs,
a fact which is borne out by an anecdote told by
Guy Shoup about the Encina man who asked despair
ingly: "Is Stanford really going lo pull out of NCAA?"
Much investigation and careful thought is needed on
this subject.
What about tbe internal problems of student gov
ernment which are now being considered by a special
commission on reorganization? In reviewing Stanford
government, many questions appear which cannot be
easily cast aside. Should the Student Manager re
main in his almost omnipotent position as the sole
control over student expenditures? Is it really a
good argument for continuing this control to say that
he is chosen on the basis of his ability (implying that

he will do little that is wrong) and therefore that
the Executive Committee should benignly accept his
word without comment because the result of investi
gation would be inefficiency? I suggest that in deal- j
ing with the nearly half million dollars which goes j
through the ASSU Office each year, a little ineffi
ciency would be'most welcome if it meant an investi
gation and public airing of where student funds are
being spent.
One other subject: elections. Enough has been said
about the "difficulties" t which occurred during the
recent voting, providing humorous material for both
students and candidates. Now it has been announced
that a solution has been found consisting of having
only one polling place to remain open for two days,
this suggestion has some merit, but 1 do not believe
it strikes at the heart of the problem. Forty-five pei
cent of those eligible voted in the final elections—a
figure laughingly, almost despairingly, low for candi
dates who had spent three weeks of intensive effort
trying to arouse that vote. Is this figure one to be
proud of, to set as a standard around which to build
election laws? I think not. Our whole system of
elections must be re-examined so that we may
profit by our mistakes and move forward toward
greater student participation. What about the pref
erential system? Tom Barkley, professor of political
science, told me a few days ago that for 23 years he
has been advising Ex-coms, that the preferential
vole is designed for only one election (not primaries
and finals) and that the alternative is a primary
elimination, placing only two candidates before the
voters in the finals. I personally favor the latter be
cause it would allow the use of voting machines and
would provide a compact two-week campaign period
in which, after the primaries ,the issues would be
clearly drawn without the recent confusion in having
five candidates for ASSU president on the final bal
lot. The primary task, it appears to me, in obtaining
student participation in elections is to bring the
issues and the candidates before them, give them a
clear choice, and then provide easy means by which
that choice may be expressed. Herein lies the respon
sibility of student government.
Finally, I want to thank all the people—and there
were many—who helped in my campaign. I hope
that you will join with me to aid in any way pos
sible the new officers who will guide Stanford affairs
next year so that it may prove to be a year of action
and progress.
