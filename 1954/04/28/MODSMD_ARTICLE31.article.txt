# Stanford Students Tour Convalescent Home
## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
It was quite an experience.
Thirty Stanford students trooped
through the Con Home yesterday,
visiting the wards and grounds and
getting an idea of the institution for
which they will be soliciting during
the Con Home Drive next month.
They were taken through the
physical therapy room, which is

decorated in yellow and blue, with
.stuffed animals peering down from
niches in the walls.
They tiptoed through the little
girls' ward, waving hello to the
children who were playing in cribs,
scooting around the floor, and bend
ing busily over desks.
They chuckled over the Wolo
murals in the dining room, espe

cially the reindeer up on a high peak
who should have gone with Santa's
sleigh but couldn't make the team.
They trooped through the run
abouts' ward, congregating in the
playrooms, where the boys sur
rounded the train set and billiard
table, and the girls oohed and aahed
over the doll houses.
They examined the arts and crafts
section and puzzled over the riddle
written on a blackboard ("What
man makes his living by not work
ing in the daytime?" Answer—the
night watchman.).
They crowded into the playhouse
— scaled to child size — and ex
claimed over the stove and tea sets,
and books and bear-skin rug before
the fireplace.
And they saw the children —
laughing over their toys, sitting
quietly on their beds, working in
the playrooms, and watching the
movies.
Yes, it was quite an experience.
