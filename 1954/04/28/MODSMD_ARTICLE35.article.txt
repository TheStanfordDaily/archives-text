Stanford will undoubtedly beat the UCLA track team in the Stadium
Saturday afternoon, but if a couple of Bruin freshmen were permitted to
compete with the "big boys," the outcome of the meet might be something
else again.
The Uelan frosh I am refeiring to are slender Bob Seaman, middle dis
tance ace from Reed ley High, outside of Fresno, and powerful Don Vick,
a shot putter from Ontario and Chaffey High in Southern California. Both
Seaman and Vick set national interscholastic records in their eventns in the
State Meet last year.
Off his steady improvement this year and his astounding performance
last weekend, Seaman must be the number one freshman prospect in the
country. All the Brubabe star did was step the mile in 4:14.5. That not

only broke his own UCLA frosh
record, but Larry Carter's old varsity
school mark of 4:16.3 as well.
His time is all the more astonish
ing when you consider that he wasn't
pressed. And you can't help wonder
ing what he could do against a little
competition, maybe not Wes Santee,
but perhaps Russ Bonham of Whit
tier, Jim Terrill of Oxy, or Fernando
Ledesma of USC. I think Seaman
would win going away before the
year is over.
Why isn't he at Stanford? And,
above all, why isn't he at USC? Ac
tually, Stanford tried to lure the
prep miler to the Farm. For once
there was no problem of grades.
Needless to say, SC was hard at
work also. So were Oxy and Kansas
among others.
But UCLA had Seaman all
wrapped up for delivery for Craig
Dixon, the frosh coach, by late Au
gust. And thus we have a tale:
Seaman spent September in semi
hiding at a fraternity house in West
wood. attempting to stay out of the
way of Oxy and SC recruiters. Dur
ing this period, Dixon's fraternity
lined up a date for Seaman. The
date went off .smoothlv and nothing

seemed out of the ordinary. But they didn't know that the girl's father
was an SC alum.
A few days later, the girl called Seaman and invited him over to her
house for dinner. He was a little surprised, but far from worried.
At the dinner that evening besides Seaman, the girl, and her parents,
were Jess Mortenson, Trojan track coach: the president of the SC alumni
association, other alumni big shots, and for all practical purposes a blank
check book.
All of which reminds me, Danny Schweikart. who was second to Seaman
in the State mile, was supposedly kidnapped off the Whittier College
campus where he enrolled last fall. Schweikart evidently didn't like it
around Figueroa and Jefferson either.
Vick, whose brother Jim was captain of the 1952 Stanford football team,
hasn't developed as quickly as Seaman, but he consistently gets the IG
pound sphere out over 50 feet and is expectd to reach at' least 57 before
I he finishes.
Any day now Vick could surpass the varsity's Tony Wetter to become
j the school's top putter.
Incidently, don t lail to take n6tice of Wetter in the Stadium this week.
1 He puts from the southpaw side, which is almost as rare as a left-handed
catcher in baseball.
Other Bruins to watch this week are the above-mentioned Carter in the
mile or the two mile, where he holds the school record of 9:24.8; John
Walker in the broad jump; Jon Mitchell and basketballer Lindy Kell in
the pole vault; and sophomore Jim Ball in the hurdles.
