# Lefty Bohnen To Pitch For Frosh Today
## 
### 
Dick Clegg's freshman baseball
(earn goes after its eighth win in 11
starts when they face Palo Alto High
School at Palo Alto at 3:15.
Coach Clegg, who is blessed with
''as good a bunch of freshman {ling
ers as I have ever seen," will finally
get a chance to start one of his left
handed flingers, Dave Bohnen,
against the not-too-strong Vikes.
So far this year, Clegg has been
rotating his three ace right-handers,
Ed Verdurmen, Ray Looney, and
Dick Jones, and he is glad to have
an opportunity to work some of his
other moundmen.
Paly has not fared very well in
its Peninsula Athletic League out
ings this year. They have a record
of two wins and three losses. They
are sparked by shortstop Dick
Campbell and pitcher Stacey Pen
nel.
The freshmen would like to fatten
their batting averages at the ex
pense of the Paly hurlers. In their
last two outings the Papooses have
not been impressive with the lum
ber, losing to St. Ignatius of San
Francisco 4-2, and then getting only
one hit while beating Cal 2-1.
