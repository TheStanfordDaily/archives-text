### 
Southpaw Don DeLong will get the starting call this afternoon
in Stanford's final prep for an important two-game set in the
Southland this week against USC's hard-hitting Trojans.
Win - hungry COP will oppose the Card baseballers on the

Sunken Diamond at 3:15 p.m. The
visiting Tigers from Stockton boast !
a 12-game skein.
DeLong is scheduled to work
about five innings for Everett Dean's
league - leading crew with Ken
Brown and Phil Page slated to share
the final four frames.
Dean is hoping that COP will
have its top pitcher, Chuck Livio,
ready to work so that the Card
batters will get a crack at the kind
of pitching they expect from the
Trojans.
Stanford went on a hitting ram
page lor the first time this year in
the late innings Saturday against
Cal. as they added a sixth C1I1A
victory against two losses.
DeLong has the second highest
earned-run average among Indian
hurlers with a 2.64 mark, but he
has walked 17 batters in as many
innings. He has a two - and - two
record over the season.
Ken Brown, who has been saved
for, relief, has pitched only eight
innings, winning one game. Pape
has won two and lost three in 45
innings on the mound.
