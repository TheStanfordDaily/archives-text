# Future of Stanford Village Now Being Decided by FHA
## 
### GERRY SMITH 
The future of Stanford Village,
used for eight years as Univer
sity housing, depends on a Fed
eral Housing Authority deci
sion.
Post - war Stanford, along with
several hundred other colleges and
universities throughout the nation,
was plagued by the problems of a
veteran-increased student body.
Housing was a particularly urgent
need. However, the late President
Tresidder was able to lease govern
ment-owned Dibble General Hos
pital in Menlo Park for the Univer
sity. Within a few months Stanford
yillage was opened to house the ed
ucation-seeking veterans and their
families.
In 1943 the federal government
had bought the 85 - acre Timothy
Hopkins estate for the site of a new
Army hospital. A year and $5 mil
lion later, Dibblo General Hospital's
2,775 beds were prepared to receive
the wounded of World War 11.
Named for Colonel John Dibble,
one of the first Army medical men
to die in the second World War, the
hospital was dedicated on March 2,
1944.
One of eight plastic surgery cen
ters in the United States, Dibble was
also used for vocational and avoca
tional rehabilitation. Besides work
in these fields, its staff was con
cerned with surgery on and rehabil
itation of the blind.
Dibble continued to grow during
the war years, and when it closed
its patients totaled 16,268. All pa
tients were released or discharged
to other hospitals by June 15, 1946,
and the Army vacated on June 30.
President Tresidder leased Dib
ble for a University residence in
August. Shortly afterward, the
name "Stanford Village" won a
Daily-sponsored naming contest.
Under an agreement with the
Federal Public Housing Authority,
the University was to prepare hous
ing for single students and finance
the upkeep and eventual razing of
the Village. The FPHA was to be
responsible . for the alteration of
wards into one- and two-room
apartments for married students.
Stanford Village had only a few
minor changes until 1949. Then the

University remodeled several of the |
buildings.
When the Village was "first }
leased, Stanford had planned to
use it only as temporary housing.
But crowded conditions continued,
and the Village 'remained filled :
with students, although not all
veterans.
At the outbreak of the Korean
war, Stanford had applied to buy j
the Village as required by an |
amendment to the Housing Act. All j
negotiations were frozen by the
government pending the outcome of
hostilities, and Stanford stayed in [
the Village.
With the end of the Korean war. |
negotiations began again. Originally i
it was thought that, under the
terms of the Act, Stanford would ;
purchase the land from the govern- j
ment. The University had agreed ]
that it would sell the Village to the
City of Menlo Park at cost when its
needs for temporary housing were j
completed.
However, latest informal reports |
from Washington are that the j
jPublic Housing Authority now !
plans to sell the property directly !
to Menlo Park. In this event, Uni
versity officials expect thai an ar
rangement can be made with the
city to protect Stanford's housing
needs.
At the moment all interested par
ties— Stanford. Menlo Park, and i
various organizations wishing to lo- j
cate eventually on Village land—are j
awaiting the FHA decision.

Hopkins estate for the site of a new
Army hospital. A year and $5 mil
lion later, Dibblo General Hospital's
2,775 beds were prepared to receive
the wounded of World War 11.
Named for Colonel John Dibble,
one of the first Army medical men
to die in the second World War, the
hospital was dedicated on March 2,
1944.
One of eight plastic surgery cen
ters in the United States, Dibble was
also used for vocational and avoca
tional rehabilitation. Besides work
in these fields, its staff was con
cerned with surgery on and rehabil
itation of the blind.
Dibble continued to grow during
the war years, and when it closed
its patients totaled 16,268. All pa
tients were released or discharged
to other hospitals by June 15, 1946,
and the Army vacated on June 30.
President Tresidder leased Dib
ble for a University residence in
August. Shortly afterward, the
name "Stanford Village" won a
Daily-sponsored naming contest.
Under an agreement with the
Federal Public Housing Authority,
the University was to prepare hous
ing for single students and finance
the upkeep and eventual razing of
the Village. The FPHA was to be
responsible . for the alteration of
wards into one- and two-room
apartments for married students.
Stanford Village had only a few
minor changes until 1949. Then the

University remodeled several of the |
buildings.
When the Village was "first }
leased, Stanford had planned to
use it only as temporary housing.
But crowded conditions continued,
and the Village 'remained filled :
with students, although not all
veterans.
At the outbreak of the Korean
war, Stanford had applied to buy j
the Village as required by an |
amendment to the Housing Act. All j
negotiations were frozen by the
government pending the outcome of
hostilities, and Stanford stayed in [
the Village.
With the end of the Korean war. |
negotiations began again. Originally i
it was thought that, under the
terms of the Act, Stanford would ;
purchase the land from the govern- j
ment. The University had agreed ]
that it would sell the Village to the
City of Menlo Park at cost when its
needs for temporary housing were j
completed.
However, latest informal reports |
from Washington are that the j
jPublic Housing Authority now !
plans to sell the property directly !
to Menlo Park. In this event, Uni
versity officials expect thai an ar
rangement can be made with the
city to protect Stanford's housing
needs.
At the moment all interested par
ties— Stanford. Menlo Park, and i
various organizations wishing to lo- j
cate eventually on Village land—are j
awaiting the FHA decision.


VILLAGE VlEW—Army-owned Dibble General Hospital, now
Stanford Village, stretches below in this aerial view taken in
1946. Before Dibble became a University housing development
it was an Army center for plastic surgery and rehabilitation of
the blind. Dibble handled casualties from all battle areas in
World War 11, but especially from the Pacific. At present, the
future of the Village depends on a Federal Housing Administra
tion decision.
The future of Stanford Village,
used for eight years as Univer
sity housing, depends on a Fed

Post - war Stanford, along with
several hundred other colleges and
universities throughout the nation,
was plagued by the problems of a
veteran-increased student body.
Housing was a particularly urgent
need. However, the late President
Tresidder was able to lease govern

pital in Menlo Park for the Univer
sity. Within a few months Stanford
yillage was opened to house the ed
ucation-seeking veterans and their

In 1943 the federal government
