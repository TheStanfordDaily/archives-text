# LeRoy Calls Hollywood's Obituary 'Premature'
## 
### GERRY SMITH 
"An obituary for the film industry is as premature as those for
Twain and Hemingway," film producer and director Mervyn Le-
Roy emphasized last night in his talk on "Entertainment and
Showmanship" at the Tuesday Evening Series in Memorial Au
ditorium.
Leßoy stated that "the wraps are off" motion pictures. New

movies arc large, expanded, excit
ing, and successful—"both com
mercially and critically."
"Hollywood has acceptcd the chal
lenge of new success," LcRoy told
the audience. "Hollywood has
learned that the balance it seeks lies
in the enjoyment of the public."
The most expensive films ever pro
duced are coming out of Hollywood
now, LcRoy mentioned. His own
production, "Quo Vadls," cost $7,200,-
000.
Hollywood is respecting the rule of
responsibility to its audience, he
said. "We have learned that the pub
lic will embrace any new innova
tion" if it is well done.
"Virtually every person dedicated
to the film industry is creative," Le-
Roy reported. The director is a co
ordinator who must weigh and bal
ance. He must know human nature,
but most of all, the human heart, he
added.
"Stanford sits in on film history
again tonight," LcRoy said after
mentioning that other great happen
ings in movies had taken place at
Stanford.
Apologizing for not giving more
dialogue, LeRoy stated, "I'm not
really a speaker—I'm a director. And
a director belongs behind the cam
era, not in front of it."
LcRoy commented on several pic
tures from the annals of early film
history. Most of these movies were
on 16 millimeter film, taken around
the 1890's and early 1900's.
Beginning his comments on the
films, LeRoy said, "I would like to I
show you what. Thomas Edison start- |
cd." He called the era around 1800 I
lo 1900 the era of "birth and early
life of films.
LeRoy told the audiencc that all
films were obtained from the Library
of Congress and were recorded on
spccial photo paper, not film. He also
mentioned that few people had seen
them and that "you are the first large
group of general public" to view
these early films.
These pictures reveal the begin
ning of a new entertainment field
destined to become great, he men
tinned. The first movie piot was con
ceived by an unknown author.
Included among the early films
were ' The Corset Model," "The Ex-
Convict," "The Girl at the Window,"
"An Englishman's Trip From London
to Paris," and "The Baltimore Fire."
LcRoy also showed "The Voice
, That Thrilled the World," a 35 mm.
j movie illustrating the progress of the
film industry from its early begin
nings to 1942. He mentioned that
♦ he first musical score appeared in
"Don Juan" in 192(5 and that "The
! Jazz Singer" with A1 Jolson was the
I first "talkie."
"It isn't the size of the screen that
counts —it's the picture itself. Pic
tures arc made to fit the people."
LeRoy concluded. "When a picture
comcs from the heart, you really
have something."
