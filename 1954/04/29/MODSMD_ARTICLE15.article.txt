# McCarthy, Stevens Clash on New Issue
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 29 (UP).
Army Secretary Robert T. Ste
vens acknowledged today that
he considered removing the
commander of Fort Monmouth,
N.J., because of a speech the of
ficer made about Sen. Joseph
R. McCarthy's investigation of
the post.
But Stevens denied McCarthy's
suggestion that he was angry at the
officer, Maj. Gen. Kirke B. Lawton,
for praising the McCarthy inquiry,
Stevens said he objected to the gen
eral's naming of certain schools and
colleges as having educated most of
the alleged "security risks" at the
post.
Stevens made the statement near

the close of the fifth day of Army-
McCarthy hearing*, after McCar
thy had accused him of "flagrant
dishonesty'' and told him "some
one has been or will be guilty of
perjury" because of contradictory
testimony.
Stevens, flushed and angry, snap
ped back that "I deeply resent" Mc-
Carthy's charges. In a sharp give
and-take with the Wisconsin Re
publican, Stevens also said it wasn't
McCarthy's fault that CÂ». David
Schine never had risen above pri
vate in the Army.
This exchange highlighted the day
as Stevens testified on the excep
t i on a 1 "dispensations" granted
Schine while the former McCarthy
aide was stationed at Fort Dix, N.J.
The audience roared with laughter
as Stevens said be was aware that

Schme paid other soldiers to clean
his gun.
.McCarthy tried in vain to block
Stevens' testimony on the favors

Schine received at Eort Dix. The
Senator also protested vigorously
that subcommittee counsel Jen
kins was "assuming facts" in the
way he put questions to Stevens.
McCarthy said it was "completely
unfair ... to smear" Schine when
he was not there to defend himself.

Democratic Senators retorted that
McCarthy himself had done the
same thing in the past. But at their
urging, Schine was notified that he
had a right to attend the hearings
with counsel at all times.
McCarthy's reference to Gen
eral Lawton, who once testified
secretly before the McCarthy sub
committee, appeared to catch Ste
vens and the Army side by sur
prise. But Stevens said he had
once talked to Maj. Gen. George I.
Back, Army Signal Corps chief,
about Lawton's removal.
McCarthy told Stevens he had a
statement from Back about the con
versation and implied it might con
tradict Stevens' version. He did not
offer the statement in evidence but
was allowed to refer to it in ques
tioning Stevens.

McCarthy asked Stevens if he
considered removing Lawton lie
cause the Fort Monmouth com
mander "paid tribute" to McCar
thy's investigation of alleged Com
munists at the post.
Stevens replied that he was "a
little worried about Lawton's
judgment" because the genera!
mentioned schools and colleges.
Stevens pleaded with McCarthy
not to drag the case into public
because Lawton is "one of our
commanding generals. A fine pro
fessional man. He is still in com
mand at Fort Monmouth."
"It really eats my heart out to
have to talk about one of our offi
cers this way," Stevens said.
"Oh, I know it does," McCarthy
interjected.
