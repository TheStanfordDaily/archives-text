### 
A Gibraltar ape, leased to the
Chi Psi brothers of Stanford by its
owner, was back in his fraternity
house bedroom (behind closed
door) after six hours of Tarzan
like escapades on campus.
Police Chief Gordon Davis, who
led the safari, retrieved the ape
Pogo through the help of its own
er, Tony Keeble, from the roof
top of emeritus Professor of Eng
lish Henry D. Graves. The little
ape. "was not in a mood to be
captured by anybody," Chief Da
vis remarked.
