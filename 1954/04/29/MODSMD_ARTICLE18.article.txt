# MEN'S COUNCIL
## Student Given Sentence For Misconduct 
### 
A .student, was sentenced to five
hours' work in the Con Home last
week by the Men's Council for a
Fundamental Standard violation.
The violation was disturbing the
peace in front of Lagunita while in
toxicated.
During the first week of April five
students visited Lagunita in the
early morning in an intoxicated
condition. Two banged on the front
door of the residence, while the oth
ers stood on the lawn yelling.
Lagunita's house mother called
police who ordered the students to
stop. All five immediately ran. Only
one was caught and he was taken
to the police station for questioning.
He refused to name his companions.
His case was referred to Men's
Council because of "conduct unbe
coming a Stanford gentleman."
The student admitted his actions
in front of the Council, but pleaded
"not guilty" to a Fundamental
Standard violation on the grounds
that his individual actions were not
serious enough. While he had run
from the police, he had not pounded
on Lagunita's door.
The Council ruled, however, that
his actions were part of the whole
act of "disturbing the peacc at La
gunita while intoxicated."
The Council explained the Fun
damental Standard more thoroughly
to the student and gave him until
the end of the quarter to finish his
sentence.
