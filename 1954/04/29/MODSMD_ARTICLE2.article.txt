# Panel Disagrees On Civil Rights
## 
### SYDNEY LITTLE 
The eagerness of youth versus the caution of age might describe
the division of opinion of the panel discussion held last night in
Cubberley Auditorium on "Civil Rights in Education." On the
panel were Thomas Barclay, professor of political science; John
Bartky, professor of education; Don Fehrenbacher, professor of

history; Loon Ardzrooni, sophomore
pre-law student; and Don Starr, a
junior speech major.
In answering the question "Should
we immediately end racial segrega
tion in publicly supported educa
tion?" Ardzrooni advocated imme
diacy. He based his argument for
prompt action on the need for the
United States to make its national
opinions consistent with its ideal,
and on the "realistic need for social
maturity as an aid in the present
world situation."
"If there is any agcncy which can
bring about integration among the
races, it. is the school," stated Bart
ky, "but shall we begin in the public
schools, and shall we begin imme
diately?" Bartky, who has had ex
tensive experience with the prob
lem of segregation in his educational
experience, cited several instances
supporting the need for gradual
changes in present-day systems.
He explained that in 13 per cent
of the Southern states 20 per cent,
of the counties have a majority Ne
gro population. By abolishing all
segregation immediately this would
reverse the minority group, and the
Negroes, who have not had the cul
tural advantages of the whites,
would be in the majority creating
new problems.
Barclay pointed out that the Ne
gro hasn't yet reached the social and
economic status of the white and the
problem of school segregation is
merely a manifestation of the prob
lem. Starr suggested the possibility
of striving for equality in the sepa
rated schools first, and then, as the
minority groups become cultural
equals, combine the two groups.
