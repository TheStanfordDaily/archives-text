GENEVA, April 28 (UP)—Run
sia stalled progress toward talks
on peace or a mercy truce in
Indochina tonight, and Red
China blasted any lingering
hopes of a Korean settlement at
Geneva.
Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov
demanded an invitation to Geneva
for the Viet Minh Communists aa
the price for even taking up Indo
chinese peace or a cease-fire for the
evacuation of wounded from Dien
Bien Phu.
Chinese Premier Chou En - lai
made his debut at the conference
on Korea and Indochina with a
broadside demand that the West get
out of Asia, lock, stock, and barrel.
Chou called for the elimination of
all Western bases in Asia, evacua
tion of all non-Asiatic troops, fo
mation of an all-Asian security pact,
and proclamation here and now of
the Red Chinese regime as legal
representative of the Chinese peo
pie, rather than that of Generalis
simo Chiang Kai-shek.
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles bluntly rejected a Com
munist plan for a Korean settle
ment.
The behind-the-scenes talks of
Molotov and French Foreign Min
ister Georges Bidault 011 Indo
china stole the show from the Ko
rean political debate.
The Soviet-French talks were at
cented by a report circulated freely
here that the Communists could
have captured Dien Bien Phu any
time in the last five days, but had
held off for political bargaining pur
poses.
Bidault had called Monday for a
cease-fire to evacuate the wounded
at Dien Bien Phu. Today the Rus
sians called a news conference and
reported that they had proposed
talks here on the proposition. Af
terward the French disclosed then
version of the Molotov - Bidault
talks.
Bidault railed on Molotov yes
terday and proposed the early
start of an Indochina peace talk.
Molotov demanded that the Com
munist Viet Minh be inviled. v w
Bidault replied that he would
have to consult Paris, the United
States, Britain, and the Viet Nam
chief of state, Bao Dai, who had an
nounced he would in no case sit at
Geneva with envoys of the Commu
nists in Indochina.
Returning to see Molotov today,
Bidault was unable to give a definite
answer about an invitation to the
Viet Minh.
