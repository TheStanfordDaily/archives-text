# McCarthyâ€”Manner and Means
## 
### 
The hearings continue.
Secretary of the Army Robert Stevens con
tinues to testify on the alleged pressure by Mc-
Carthy and his staff to get the Army to give
preferential treatment to Private David Schine.
And Senator Joseph McCarthy continues to
cross-examine Stevens and other Army wit
nesses on their charges and his own.
We are primarily concerned with the facts of
the whoje iiontroversy. We wish to know the
answers to the many questions which have
been raised by both sides. We hope that those
answers will be supplied honestly and clearly
by Stevens, McCarthy, and their assistants.
But last night our attention was momentarily
diverted from the facts of the case. Our atten
tion was focused on the manner and means of
McCarthy in questioning Stevens and the other
Army witnesses.

And we got boiling mad.
At the unfair and misleading questions he
asked. At the vituperative snaps of "Don't get
coy" and "Corne on now, don't give me that."
At the dozen tactics of intimidation he em
ployed. At the over-all picture of a man hurling
contempt and cynicism with every word, with
every gesture, with every facility of clever
demagoguery.
Yes, we were mad. And we defend that mo
mentary anger. We return now to a rational
consideration of the facts of the case. But before
we do, we commend the daily radio and TV
bioadcasts of the hearings to every student.
Let each student judge the facts of the case.
But let each student judge also the picture of
McCarthy and his manner and means to "get
the facts."
