To the Editor:
With regard to your editorial, "Geneva Today," in
which you say:
"And for those who say of the conference 'who
cares,' we say:
"All of us should. Especially those of us who may
have to fight a war in Korea or Indochina that is not
avoided at the Conference table i'n Geneva."
J should like to offer for your attention the fol
lowing propositions, which are difficult to prove but
seem intuitively obvious.
J. The Daily editors ar*-* not .significantly more in

telligent than other students.
2. The Daily editors are not. significantly more
ethical'than other students.
3. The Daily editors are not significantly better
informed on world affairs than anyone who takes

nially feel obliged, or even entitled, to take the least
profound observation that comes into your heads and
use it to assume a moralizing tone that would curdle
anybody's breakfast orange juice.
