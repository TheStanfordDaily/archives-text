# Macanovic's Life
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Mv. Workman objects to the award of an ASSU
foreign scholarship to a Yugoslav because he thinks
our money could be more wisely invested in a free
country. At a meeting of the Newman Club last
Thursday night Mr. Fred Glover, the assistant to
the president of this university, raised a more serious

objection. Mr. CJlover suggested that Macanovic may
have been placed in serious danger of losing his lite
either now before his departure for the United States,
or a year from now when he returns to Yugoslavia.
Was the Foreign Scholarship Committee aware of
this possibility when it made the award?
