# 'INTELLECTUAL DYNAMO'
## Will Herberg, 'Brilliant Theologian,' Plans Visit 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
An "intellectual dynamo" will be visiting Stanford for the next
two weeks.
Will Herberg, author and lecturer in theology and social phi
losophy, is, in the opinion of Dr, Alexander Miller, lecturer in
Religion, "one of the most vigorous controversialists and most
brilliant minds that I've ever met."*

"He can keep more intellectual
balls in the air than almost any man
I've known," Miller commented,
"and his range of interests is amaz
ing, covering theology, philosophy,
history, and industrial relations."
Discussing Herberg's life, Miller
told how Herberg had joined the
Communist parly after graduating
from Columbia University, and bro
ken with it in 1929.
"Now he is violently anti-Com
munist," Miller stressed. "In fact
lie has been quoted as describing
Communism as 'a cult of collec
tive self - deification.' Jierberg
spends his time attacking Com
munism and seeking to develop
constructive political and religious
alternatives."
Eastern universities have claimed
a good deal of Herberg's time in the
past years, and apparently his in
fluence on them has been profound.
In connection with a visit he paid
to Cornell University, the Cornell
Daily Sun commented:
"The natural tendency is now to
ask whether Cornell actually needs
or wants any more opportunities for
religious study#. . . The mere men
tion of one man's name—Will Her
berg — is sufficient answer. Since
this remarkable teacher - philoso
pher-student has returned to the

campus, amazingly large numbers of
people have assembled to hear him
talk and to talk with him. The re
sponse far exceeds last year's; he is
deluged from all sides for invita
tions to meet with campus groups."
Herberg visited Stanford two
years ago, and participated in two
student-faculty seminars.
During this visit, Herberg will de
liver two sermons in Memorial
Church, participate in three faculty
student seminars, and be the guest
speaker for the Thursday Lunch
Club.
Subjects for the Sunday sermons

I will he"The God of the Bible and
the Gods of Modern Man" and
"Faith and Responsibility in an Age
of Crisis." In the seminars he will
discuss the philosophical - rational,
mystical, and Biblical - existential
approaches to religion. At the
Thursday Lunch Club, his topic will
be "Faith and Social Responsibility."
In addition to this schedule, he
will visit classes in religion, philos
ophy, history, political science, busi
ness, and education, and be avail
able for personal interviews and
visits to living groups.
Comparing Herberg and Bryan
Green, Miller brought out the dif
ferences between the two men.
"Green's appeal was due largely to
his personality; Herberg on the oth
er hand is best noted for his intel
j lectual cogency. In his own way,
j Herberg is as important a visitor as
j Green, although his method of wurk
! will hi- quite different."

approaches to religion. At the
Thursday Lunch Club, his topic will
be "Faith and Social Responsibility."
In addition to this schedule, he
will visit classes in religion, philos
ophy, history, political science, busi
ness, and education, and be avail
able for personal interviews and
visits to living groups.
Comparing Herberg and Bryan
Green, Miller brought out the dif
ferences between the two men.
"Green's appeal was due largely to
his personality; Herberg on the oth
er hand is best noted for his intel
j lectual cogency. In his own way,
j Herberg is as important a visitor as
j Green, although his method of wurk
! will hi- quite different."
An "intellectual dynamo" will be visiting Stanford for the next
two weeks.
Will Herberg, author and lecturer in theology and social phi
losophy, is, in the opinion of Dr, Alexander Miller, lecturer in
Religion, "one of the most vigorous controversialists and most
brilliant minds that I've ever met."*

"He can keep more intellectual
balls in the air than almost any man
I've known," Miller commented,
"and his range of interests is amaz
ing, covering theology, philosophy,
history, and industrial relations."
Discussing Herberg's life, Miller
told how Herberg had joined the
Communist parly after graduating
from Columbia University, and bro
ken with it in 1929.
"Now he is violently anti-Com
munist," Miller stressed. "In fact
lie has been quoted as describing
Communism as 'a cult of collec
tive self - deification.' Jierberg
spends his time attacking Com
munism and seeking to develop
constructive political and religious
alternatives."
Eastern universities have claimed
a good deal of Herberg's time in the
past years, and apparently his in
fluence on them has been profound.
In connection with a visit he paid
to Cornell University, the Cornell
Daily Sun commented:
"The natural tendency is now to
ask whether Cornell actually needs
or wants any more opportunities for
religious study#. . . The mere men
tion of one man's name—Will Her
berg — is sufficient answer. Since
this remarkable teacher - philoso
pher-student has returned to the

campus, amazingly large numbers of
people have assembled to hear him
talk and to talk with him. The re
sponse far exceeds last year's; he is
deluged from all sides for invita
tions to meet with campus groups."
Herberg visited Stanford two
years ago, and participated in two
student-faculty seminars.
During this visit, Herberg will de
liver two sermons in Memorial
Church, participate in three faculty
student seminars, and be the guest
speaker for the Thursday Lunch
Club.
Subjects for the Sunday sermons

I will he"The God of the Bible and
the Gods of Modern Man" and
"Faith and Responsibility in an Age
of Crisis." In the seminars he will
discuss the philosophical - rational,
mystical, and Biblical - existential
approaches to religion. At the
Thursday Lunch Club, his topic will
be "Faith and Social Responsibility."
