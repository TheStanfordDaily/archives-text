# New Program For Engineers
## 
### 
A new pattern in education, en- j
abling students to combine full-time j
employment in electronics with reg- j
ular classroom study for an ad- '
vanced University degree, has been j
inaugurated by the School of En- j
gineering.
Called the Honors Co-operative j
Program in Electronics, the plan is j
| now in effect with Hewlett-Pack
i aid Company, Palo Aito; the Moun- ;
j tain View Laboratories of Sylvania |
Electric; and Stanford Research In-
I stitute, Menlo Park, it was an- !
nounced by Frederick E. Terman, 1
dean of the school.
The students will be putting in ]
35-hour work weeks on their em- i
ployers' premises and about six
hours a week in regular daytime |
classes at Stanford. But they will
draw a full 40-hour week salary
J from their employers.
Recognizing that tuition does not. i
! cover the cost of education, the :
firms will also pay the University
$15 for each academic unit of work 1
taken by the participants. Stanford
j will use this income for additional !
i teaching personnel.
Under this program the student,
will be able to complete a full aca
demic year of graduate work in two
calendar years. In some instances
the thesis for the graduate work can
be combined with company re
search.
Sylvania expects to select seven j
students annually and the other two !
will pick three each. Students are j
expected to participate for two years j
so that after the beginning of the i
second year the total number of
students will double. Those selected
must be able to meet Stanford's ad
mission requirements for graduate
standing in electrical engineering.
