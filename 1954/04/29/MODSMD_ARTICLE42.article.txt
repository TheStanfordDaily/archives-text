# Baseballers Belt COP, 24-1
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Stanford ran around the bases while COP kicked around the ball, and all in all it was a boring
afternoon at the Sunken Diamond yesterday.
When the Indians ran wild for 13 runs in the sixth inning, Coach Everett Dean called off
the slaughter to allow the Tigers to go back to Stockton with only a 24-1 drubbing on their
record.
Yes, I said 24-1. In six times at bat yet. That isn't a season's record however. The Cards

beat USF, 26-5, earlier, but took nine
innings to do it.
An outline of the type of fiasco
that took place goes something like
this: Stanford got 21 hits; three COP
pitchers gave up eight walks and
two balks; COP made 10 errors.
After a calm, one-two-three first
inning, the Indians began to go to
work with three runs in the second,
followed by five in the third. They
had another three-run spurt in the
fifth before putting together the 13-
run sixth frame.
Don DeLong left-handed the first
five innings to get the win for the
Tribe before giving way to Ken
Brown and Phil Page who each
toiled a canto. Dave Tivio was the
first COP mound victim. He was
relieved in the third by Wayne Se
gale who lasted until Jim Collins
took over in the sixth.
Dean made a switch in his line
up in preparation for the important
SC series this week end, inserting
Mickey Holzinan at third and mov
ing Tom Dandurand to left and Al
Talboy to first. The change payed
ofi both offensively and defensively
as sophomore Holzman collected
four hits and a walk in five trips
to drive in four runs and made a pair
of nifty stops at the hot corner.
Talboy banged three hits' to go
with a walk, Sid Hall got two hits
and two walks. Rich Scramaglia, Len,
Swartz, and Captain Warren Good
rich added a pair of bingles apiece,
and Bob Evans scored five runs fol
lowing four walks and a single.
DeLong sewed up the tilt with a
three-run triple in the second after
a single by Talboy and walks to
Evans and Holzman.
Scramaglia started the fun in the
third with a triple. Before it was
over, Goodrich, Swartz, Holzman,
and DeLong had singled: Evans, Tal
boy. and Hall had walked; Tivio had
balked, wild pitched, and showered;
and Stanford had five runs.

Stanford ran around the bases while COP kicked around the ball, and all in all it was a boring
afternoon at the Sunken Diamond yesterday.
When the Indians ran wild for 13 runs in the sixth inning, Coach Everett Dean called off
the slaughter to allow the Tigers to go back to Stockton with only a 24-1 drubbing on their
record.
Yes, I said 24-1. In six times at bat yet. That isn't a season's record however. The Cards

beat USF, 26-5, earlier, but took nine
innings to do it.
An outline of the type of fiasco
that took place goes something like
this: Stanford got 21 hits; three COP
pitchers gave up eight walks and
two balks; COP made 10 errors.
After a calm, one-two-three first
inning, the Indians began to go to
work with three runs in the second,
followed by five in the third. They
had another three-run spurt in the
fifth before putting together the 13-
run sixth frame.
Don DeLong left-handed the first
five innings to get the win for the
Tribe before giving way to Ken
Brown and Phil Page who each
toiled a canto. Dave Tivio was the
first COP mound victim. He was
relieved in the third by Wayne Se
gale who lasted until Jim Collins
took over in the sixth.
Dean made a switch in his line
up in preparation for the important
SC series this week end, inserting
Mickey Holzinan at third and mov
ing Tom Dandurand to left and Al
Talboy to first. The change payed
ofi both offensively and defensively
as sophomore Holzman collected
four hits and a walk in five trips
to drive in four runs and made a pair
of nifty stops at the hot corner.
Talboy banged three hits' to go
with a walk, Sid Hall got two hits
and two walks. Rich Scramaglia, Len,
Swartz, and Captain Warren Good
rich added a pair of bingles apiece,
and Bob Evans scored five runs fol
lowing four walks and a single.
DeLong sewed up the tilt with a
three-run triple in the second after
a single by Talboy and walks to
Evans and Holzman.
Scramaglia started the fun in the
third with a triple. Before it was
over, Goodrich, Swartz, Holzman,
and DeLong had singled: Evans, Tal
boy. and Hall had walked; Tivio had
balked, wild pitched, and showered;
and Stanford had five runs.

THE MERRY-GO-ROUND Stanford starts off an afternoon of

on pitcher Don DeLong's bases-loaded triple in the second.
