# Spear Thrower Leo Long Wins 'Athlete of the Week' Award
## 
### 
A mighty heave, good for 221 feet
6% inches, two weeks ago at an
] open meet at Stanford Stadium, l'ol
j lowed by a toss ol' 218 feet 10 inches
against Occidental last week, has
placed Stanford javelin man Leo
Long atop the pile of the nation's
collegiate spear artists. Anticlimac
tically, it has also earned him The
Daily's "Athlete of the Week"'
award.
Long's 221-foot effort places him
approximately eight feet ahead of
his closest competitor, Des Koch of
USC, who threw the spear 213 feet
in the Cai-USC meet last weekend.
It has been claimed that Leo
achieved this, his best individual
mark, because he used world cham
pion Bud Held's famed "hollow"
javelin. Actually, Long used Held's
practice spear, merely a well-bal
anced model of the usual variety, to
i accomplish his outstanding perform-
I ance. Moreover, all the other jave
| linists used the same type spear.
At any rafe, he threw that 218-
| foot toss at Oxy with his own spear,
J and he expects to better that mark
before the year is over. "I've really
that confidence this year," he
says."It really didn't feel any dif
ferent throwing 218 feet than 200.''
Leo's best performances during
his sophomore and junior years
ranged near the 211-foot mark. The
Stanford record, which Long might
conceivably break this year, is
owned by Held at 233 feet 4 inches.
Long, who lives with his wife in
Stanford Village, will receive a de
gree in physical education this June.
He'd like lo get a coaching job in i
j the Bay Area when he graduates.
He plans to keep in competition |
after graduation with the San Fran- j
cisco Olympic Club.
