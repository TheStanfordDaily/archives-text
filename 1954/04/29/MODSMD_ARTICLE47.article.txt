Call it the crossroads, call it the crucial test, call it the big series, or
call it what you may, but this is going to be a very important baseball
week end for a couple of nines in the California Intercollegiate Baseball
Association, namely Southern California and Stanford. The Friday and

Saturday single games which the
two teams play against each other
at Bovard Field in Los Angeles loom
particularly important to the Tro
jans.
So let's look at this two-game set
as we suppose the athletes who wear
the maroon and gold for SC might.
Here they are, with more than half
of their league games played, sitting
in second place with a 6-4 record,
one game behind Stanford which
boasts a 6-2 mark. What's more,
they are two games behind in the
vital loss column. This is it for the
Figueroa gang, the experts' pre
season choice to breeze in for the
CIBA flag. They have almost got to
win both games of the series. A split
will put them in the unenviable po
sition of not even being able to af
ford the luxury of another league
loss. Stanford, meanwhile, could
even absorb a double loss (that's a
nice thought), and still remain very
much in the running.

And what about the Trojans' chances of coming up with that big'double
win this week end? Not very good, this corner opines. Nut with the kind
of pitching the Deanmen have been benefiting from this year. Earlier this
season we scribbled something to the effect that the Indians would give
anybody hereabouts one very rugged time, what with the fine early
showing of all five first-line hurlers. The pitching has panned out even
better than we expected. Question: How does Ray Young keep it up?
Answer by frosh coach Dick Clegg: "With a fine variety of pitches, pin
point control, and one of the greatest competitive spirits I've ever .seen. He
gets better as the going gets rougher," . . . and there is no reason to ex
pect a let down this week end.
Young and Phil Page will be on the mound against the Trojans, who
admittedly are slow starters and are really coming along well as of now.
In their last CIBA outings, Rod Dedeaux's boys plastered California twice
to the tune of 12-1, while receiving good pitching from Vic Lapiner and
Marty Zuanich. Catcher John Garten has started to hit and is moving up
in the line-up (as Garten goes, so goes SC). Gerry Mason leads the
league in home runs with three. Sophomore Tony Santino is up near
the top of the league in batting with a .385 average.
All of these above factors, combined with the Trojans' great desire to
win this series, and the fact that the games will be played at Bovard Field,
whose short fences make a good target for the many power hitters in the
line-up, should make SC a formidable opponent this week end. Neverthe
less, we think that it is going to be hard to deny both Messrs. Page and
Young; that the Indians will get no worse than a split this week end; and
that they will return north with the CIBA bunting nearly in their pockets.
