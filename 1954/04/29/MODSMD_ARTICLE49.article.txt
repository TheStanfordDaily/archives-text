# Frosh Nine Manhandles Paly HS, 7-3
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
The Stanford frosh ripped Palo
Alto High School by a score of 7-3
yesterday afternoon on the home'
diamond.
The Papooses garnered their sev- j
en runs on only six hits, but gave I
several indications that they were
ready to burst out of their recent
slump.
Hap Wagner, right fielder for
Coach Dick Clegg's yearlings, was
the leading stick man of the day
with two for three attempts. One
of these two blows was a solo homer I
in the fourth, a spectacular drive
over the left field fence.
Better timed to aid the frosh cause
was catcher Dale Metcalf's circuit I
blast with two men on base in the j
seventh frame.
Paly High's shortstop Jim Camp- ;
bell was the most impressive of the i
cross-town opponents. Besides field- I
ing in a very adequate manner,
Campbell powered a double, and in
the sixth began a rally that resulted
in two of Paly's runs by laying a
beautiful bunt down the third base
line, catching the frosh infield by
surprise.
Dick Clegg used southpaw hurl
ers against the high schoolers for the
entire game. Starter Dave Bohnen
went four innings and was credited
with the win. Bohnen was relieved
by Don Petters, who completed the
game.
Petters suffered from control dif
ficulties during his mound stiht.
However, the frosh infield gave him
fine support. Twice Paly rallies
were nipped in the bud by double
plays.
Frosh batters seemed, with the
exceptions of Wagner and Metcalf,
to be somewhat baffled by the op
posing pitcher, who depended large
ly on "junk-man" stuff, including a
frequent knuckleball.
Metcalf led in the RBI department
with three for the afternoon. Right
fielder John Dito got two RBl's and
Wagner and Rudy Figueroa each
picked up one. :
