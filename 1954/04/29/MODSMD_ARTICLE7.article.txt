CAIRO, Egypt, April 28 (UP) â€”
Premier Gamal Abdel Nasser an
nounced today that a Communist
conspiracy against the government
has been broken with the arrest of
52 plotters, including 12 Army offi
cers who helped restore President.
Mohammed Naguib to office on Feb.
27.
The development was considered
by observers as another step in the
see-saw battle for power which has
been waged between Nasser and
Naguib since the revolutionary
group overthrew King Farouk in
July, 1952.
Naguib remains as president, but
in a long series of quixotic moves
Nasser has emerged as the govern
ment strong man. He is premier and
head of the Revolution Command
Council, posts once held by Naguib.
