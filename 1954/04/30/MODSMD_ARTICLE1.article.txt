# Herberg’s Aim: Upset Stereotype Thinking
## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
"I have come to campus to
try to upset conventional ways
of thinking and stereotyped
misconceptions of faith and
life," declared Will Herberg
yesterday at the beginning of
his two-week visit to Stanford.
The philosopher - theologian said
that he hoped "to confront those I
.speak to with the crucial problems
of life and thought, and place before
them the alternatives of decision."
Herberg, who has written several
books, also contributes regularly to
Commonweal, Commentary, The
Jewish Frontier, and other journals.
His book "Judlism and the Modern
Man" was hailed by Reinhold Nie
buhr as "a landmark in American
religious thought."
Speaking from his wide experi
ence with college students (he has
visited over 30 campuses in the past
year), Herberg said that he hqd no- j
t.iced "notable signs of rising inter- j
est in the problems of religion and
a spreading concern with religious
faith in general."
He listed two reasons for this in
terest.
In the first placc, the total crisis
of our time has converted imme
diate questions to ultimate ques
tions. No longer, Herberg ampli
fied, can the individual solve his
personal problems without having
to take account of the problems
of mankind.
Secondly, Herberg said, the sub
stitute faiths that have nourished
men's souls for the past years
have broken down. These faiths,
such as scientism and Marxism,
will be discussed by Herberg at
Sunday's church service, at which
time he will deliver a sermon on
"The God of the Bible and the
Gods of Modern Man."
Asked to characterize today's stu
dents, the noted lay theologian used
the term "an age of new seeking."
He said that students were search
ing for the foundations of faith, not
with the noisy, clamorous fervor of
his generation, but with a quieter,
more soul-searching spirit, a spirit
that is not so easily deceived by sur
face illusions.
Praising students for their intel
lectual liveliness and alertness as
well as for their wide range of in
terests, Herberg compared them fa
vorably to earlier generations.
"If I had to criticize them for
anything," he said, "it would be for
their tendency to retreat from com
mitment. They show a reluctance,
and sometimes even an inability, to
make vital decisions. They are in
clined to take the attitude 'Who am
I to make these decisions? Let
someone else do it.' This is really
regrettable, for they arc rapidly ap
proaching the point where they will
be forced to make decisions."
Hcrberg's theology, simply stated,
is an attempt to make Biblical faith
relevant to the intellectual, social,
and political problems of our time.
He wants to stop people from
clinging to outmoded ideas and en
courage them to rework the ideas to
make them applicable to current
problems.

and sometimes even an inability, to
make vital decisions. They are in
clined to take the attitude 'Who am
I to make these decisions? Let
someone else do it.' This is really
regrettable, for they arc rapidly ap
proaching the point where they will
be forced to make decisions."
Hcrberg's theology, simply stated,
is an attempt to make Biblical faith
relevant to the intellectual, social,
and political problems of our time.
He wants to stop people from
clinging to outmoded ideas and en
courage them to rework the ideas to
make them applicable to current
problems.


WILL HERBERG
—Visiting Stanford campus
"I have come to campus to
try to upset conventional ways
of thinking and stereotyped
misconceptions of faith and
life," declared Will Herberg
yesterday at the beginning of
his two-week visit to Stanford.
The philosopher - theologian said
that he hoped "to confront those I
.speak to with the crucial problems
of life and thought, and place before
them the alternatives of decision."
Herberg, who has written several
books, also contributes regularly to
Commonweal, Commentary, The
Jewish Frontier, and other journals.
His book "Judlism and the Modern
Man" was hailed by Reinhold Nie
buhr as "a landmark in American
religious thought."
Speaking from his wide experi
ence with college students (he has
visited over 30 campuses in the past
year), Herberg said that he hqd no- j
t.iced "notable signs of rising inter- j
est in the problems of religion and
a spreading concern with religious
faith in general."
He listed two reasons for this in
terest.
In the first placc, the total crisis
of our time has converted imme
diate questions to ultimate ques
tions. No longer, Herberg ampli
fied, can the individual solve his
personal problems without having
to take account of the problems
of mankind.
Secondly, Herberg said, the sub
stitute faiths that have nourished
men's souls for the past years
have broken down. These faiths,
such as scientism and Marxism,
will be discussed by Herberg at
Sunday's church service, at which
time he will deliver a sermon on
"The God of the Bible and the
Gods of Modern Man."
Asked to characterize today's stu
dents, the noted lay theologian used
the term "an age of new seeking."
He said that students were search
ing for the foundations of faith, not
with the noisy, clamorous fervor of
his generation, but with a quieter,
more soul-searching spirit, a spirit
that is not so easily deceived by sur
face illusions.
Praising students for their intel
lectual liveliness and alertness as
well as for their wide range of in
terests, Herberg compared them fa
vorably to earlier generations.
"If I had to criticize them for
anything," he said, "it would be for
their tendency to retreat from com
mitment. They show a reluctance,
and sometimes even an inability, to
make vital decisions. They are in
clined to take the attitude 'Who am
I to make these decisions? Let
someone else do it.' This is really
regrettable, for they arc rapidly ap
proaching the point where they will
