# AT FAIRMONT
## Juniors Plan Prom Tonight 
### 
Natty tuxedos and frothy spring
formats will fill San Francisco's
Fairmont Hotel tonight as Stanford
moves north for the annual Junior
Prom.
Freddy Martin and his band will
play from 9 until 1 a.m. in the Gold
and Nob Hill rooms of the hotel,
located at Mason and California

Streets atop Nob Hill. The juniors
have adopted Martin's theme song,
"Tonight We Love," as the theme
of the dance.
The band will play straight
through the evening, except for a
45 - binutc intermission. During the
intermission Stan Wilson, singer and
guitarist now at the Hungry I Club
in San Francisco, will entertain.
Prom tickets are still available at
the ASSU office for $3.75 per couple.
They may be exchanged at the door
for the bids.
