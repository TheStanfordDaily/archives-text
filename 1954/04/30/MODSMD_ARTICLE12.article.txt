## West Clears Way to Talks On Indochina 
### 
GENEVA, April 29 (UP)â€”The
Western Pov/ers opened the
way for early Indochinese peace
talks today and prepared to
wind up the deadlocked debate
on Korea by the end of the
week if possible.
The United States and France
persuaded Viet Nam Chief of State
Bao Dai to join Indochinese Com
munist leaders in negotiations here,
as Russia had proposed.
French Foreign Minister Georges
Bidault still had to line up the
final arrangements with Soviet For
eign Minister V. M. Molotov, whose
terms for the talks now had been
met.
The Far Eastern peace conference
leaders virtually wrote off a Korean
settlement. They prepared to shelve
the problem in so far as this parley
is concerned by relegating it to a
series of committees.
The founth day of the 19-nation
conference brought these develop
ments:
1. The former playboy Emperor
Bao Dai yielded t,o American-
French pressure in Cannes and
agreed, contrary to his previous de
termination, to sit. in or be repre
sented here along with Red leaders
from Indochina.
2. Molotov in his first speech of
the conference backed Red China's
demand that the West get out of
Asia, the proposal for an Asiatic se
curity pact, North Korea's proposal
for a Red-style Korean settlement,
and claimed big power status for
Communist China.
3. Richard Casey, Australian Min
ister foi External Affairs, called for
free all - Korean general elections
under United Nations supervision.
4. Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles prepared to leave for Wash
ington next Monday or Tuesday, in
formed sources reported, in line
with his pre-confcrence plans to be
here only for the first phase.
