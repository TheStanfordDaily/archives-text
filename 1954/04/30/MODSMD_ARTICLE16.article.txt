WASHINGTON, April 29 (UP)
—Private G. David Schine swore
under oath today at the Army-
McCarthy hearings that Army
Secretary Robert T. Stevens
asked to be photographed side
by-side with him at Maguiro
AFB last Nov. 17.
Stevens previously had sworn that
he never asked to have his photo
graph taken with Schine "alone."
He said he might have suggested,
"Come, let's gather around and have
our picture taken." But he could
not even recall saying that.
Schine, handsome six-foot-three
son of a millionaire hotel-theater
family, was dramatically called to
the stand in the midst of the sixth

grueling day of hearings into the
Army - McCarthy row to testify
about a photograph introduced
Monday by the McCarthy side of
the controversy.
The photo became a key issue
when the Army charged that the
McCarthy side had produced a
"doctored" picture designed to show
Stevens and Schine alone. It was
brought out that the original photo
showed a third person—Air Force
Colonel Jack R. Bradley—and the
coat and sleeve of a fourth person.
Among the day's other develop
ments, McCarthy quoted Lawton a:~.
saying that his co-operation with
the Wisconsin Republican's Forf,
Monmouth investigation would "kill
his chances of promotion." McCar
thy produced a report which he
said showed that Lawton had been
"passed over" by a promotion board.
