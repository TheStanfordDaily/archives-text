### Students 
The Honor Code discussion program has
ended and the campus now awaits the results
of its efforts to clarify the clouded issues of last
winter's controversy.
Those results will be presented in the form of
a report on which the special ASSU Honor
Code Committee is now working. That report
will be presented to the Executive Committee
at next week's meeting.
It will be based on three sources, all estab
lished by last week's discussion program:
1. The discussions, as recorded by group
secretaries and reported by the discussion
chairmen.
2. The collective answers which more than
2,500 students gave to the Honor Code ques
tionnaires.
3. Additional suggestions which were added
to the questionnaires by participating students.
Next Tuesday, The Daily will publish the
number of "yes" and "no" answers to each of
the questions included in the questionnaires.
As requested by the Executive Committee, we
will emphasize that the questionnaires were not

designed as any sort of student "referendum"
on questions of Honor Code interpretation. We
will emphasize that the Executive Committee
will base its decisions on the other two sources
used by the special committee as the bases
for its report.
But before that report is completed, before
Excom reaches any decisions on a current in
terpretation of the Code, we will reemphasize
now the original purpose of the discussion
program.
That purpose, as expressed by Excom and
the special committee, was to test student opin
ion in an effort to draw a collective student in
terpretation of the Code.
We hope that student opinion, as represented
in the reports by the discussion chairmen and
the answers to the questionnaire, will dictate
any decision by Excom either on the broad or
specific implications of the Code.
We hope that the Honor Code remains what
it was intended to be â€”a code of honor defined
and followed by the students. It can be suc
cessful only if it is theirs.
