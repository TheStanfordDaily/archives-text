Progress With a 'Booby Hatch"

To the Editor:
For some time now we have watched with grow
ing disgust the efforts of a misguided faction within
the University whooping it up for what they con
ceive to be Progress. The last straw came Wednes
day morning when The Daily went on record as
favoring the construction of the gigantic booby-hatch
which the Veteran's Administration wants to build on
Page Mill Road.
If this project were an isolated one it might be
borne stoically, but coming as it does hard on the
heels of the Ford Foundation's desecration of Alta

Vista, Charlie Lathrop's lovely old home above the
golf course, and the well-publicized plans to turn
the Con Home north forty into a glorified drive-in,
it's time that someone blew the whistle. If we don't,
and if these progress-mongering yahoos have their
way, they'll turn the Farm into a forest of belching
smokestacks, and the rustic beauty which we have
come to know and love will be nothing but a memory.
Personally, we'd hate to see that happen. And we
think there may be others that feel as we do.

To the Editor:
Righteous indignation reaches its highpoint on the
editorial pages of the Stanford Daily. Day after day
it parrots the terms: "intellectual freedom," "both
sides of the question," etc. In its constant call for
fairness, The Daily loses itself somewhere along the
way.
Senator McCarthy seems to be the current target
for The Daily's "fair-minded" consideration. OVer the
past year, with heightening intensity, The Daily's at
tacks on Senator McCarthy have progressed. Never
have I seen the other side on this McCarthy issue
given any sort of credence by you. Your obvious
reply here might be: "There is no other side; the
issue is clearly drawn—McCarthy is all wrong."
According to recent opinion surveys, half the
American people favor the efforts of Senator Mc-
Carthy in ridding our government of those who
place*foreign loyalty first.
I shall assume that The Daily agrees with the dem-

ocratic principle of government, and respects the
opinions of those Americans who disagree with its
own stand.
I am aware of the standard function of an editorial
page in a newspaper—that of voicing the opinion of
the editors and publishers. But The Daily is owned
and published by the Associated Students of Stanford
University and should attempt to mirror the opinions
of this group.
To represent Stanford's opinions in a wholly one
sided manner in an issue upon which the American
people are so critically divided is a direct violation of
your avowed principles of fair reporting.

McCarthy, do not feel qualified to write words of

on any subject, to "give the students both sides."

To the Editor:
Friends of Kaare Attramadal, of Stavanger, Nor
way, who received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering
last fall, learned recently that his long fight against
cancer came to a sudden end on April 11.
Kaare was a First Lieutenant in the Royal Nor
wegian Air Force, which had selected him lor a
special fellowship for advanced study of electronics at
Stanford. He was most able and experienced in his
chosen field, and had originally planned to spend sev
eral years here for graduate study. His wife and
their little boy joined him and the three of them had
just come to feel at home in Palo Alto, when he dis
covered the dreadful disease last summer.
He was fully aware of its grave prospects, but

that did not stop him from planning for the future.
During months of exhausting treatments he still
managed to work full-time at the Hewlett Packard
Company gaining valuable experience.
Returning to Norway last fall he left behind a,
group of friends and fellow students who deeply ad
mired his unusual courage and his fine personality.
To them he became a symbol of the fight against
cancer. They feel that his memory can best be pre
served by a special contribution to the American
Cancer Society, and would like to invite everyone
who ever met Kaare to join them in sending a gift
to the American Cancer Society in his name.

112 or Kaare Attramadel

To the Editor:
Friends of Kaare Attramadal, of Stavanger, Nor
way, who received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering
last fall, learned recently that his long fight against
cancer came to a sudden end on April 11.
Kaare was a First Lieutenant in the Royal Nor
wegian Air Force, which had selected him lor a
special fellowship for advanced study of electronics at
Stanford. He was most able and experienced in his
chosen field, and had originally planned to spend sev
eral years here for graduate study. His wife and
their little boy joined him and the three of them had
just come to feel at home in Palo Alto, when he dis
covered the dreadful disease last summer.
He was fully aware of its grave prospects, but

that did not stop him from planning for the future.
During months of exhausting treatments he still
managed to work full-time at the Hewlett Packard
Company gaining valuable experience.
Returning to Norway last fall he left behind a,
group of friends and fellow students who deeply ad
mired his unusual courage and his fine personality.
To them he became a symbol of the fight against
cancer. They feel that his memory can best be pre
served by a special contribution to the American
Cancer Society, and would like to invite everyone
who ever met Kaare to join them in sending a gift
to the American Cancer Society in his name.

Progress With a 'Booby Hatch"

To the Editor:
For some time now we have watched with grow
ing disgust the efforts of a misguided faction within
the University whooping it up for what they con
ceive to be Progress. The last straw came Wednes
day morning when The Daily went on record as
favoring the construction of the gigantic booby-hatch
which the Veteran's Administration wants to build on
Page Mill Road.
If this project were an isolated one it might be
borne stoically, but coming as it does hard on the
heels of the Ford Foundation's desecration of Alta

Vista, Charlie Lathrop's lovely old home above the
golf course, and the well-publicized plans to turn
the Con Home north forty into a glorified drive-in,
it's time that someone blew the whistle. If we don't,
and if these progress-mongering yahoos have their
way, they'll turn the Farm into a forest of belching
smokestacks, and the rustic beauty which we have
come to know and love will be nothing but a memory.
Personally, we'd hate to see that happen. And we
think there may be others that feel as we do.
