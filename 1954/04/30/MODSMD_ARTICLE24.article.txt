### PETE GROTHE 
SHAKESPEARE AT STANFORD
(Up on the Row, there's a love triangle. Richard
discovers that Celia, who is wearing his Phi Sig
pin, is in the arms of a Deke, William. Here's the
way Bill Shakespeare might write it up:)
Richard: Ah, this day were more blessed than if

Chief Gordy Davis were to get
a parking ticket. Is that not right,
fiood sir?
First Gardener at Guthrie: Yea
and forsooth.
Second Gardener at Guthrie:
Verily.
Richard: For I am here to see
Celia, and all the perfumes of
Arabia could not sweeten her
more.
First Gardener: Verily.

Second Gardener: Yea and forsooth.
Richard: Hark, is that not she within the window?
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand! O, that
I were a glove upon that hand, that I might touch that
cheek.
(Richard entereth Guthrie.)
Celia: Richard!
William: Richard!
Richard: Celia in a Deke's arms!! A knave, a
rascal, a base, proud, shallow, beggarly knave.
William: A Fiji!
Celia: I can explain.
Richard: How sharper than a serpent's tooth it
is to have an unfaithful lover.
Celia: I swear by the moon that I am constant to
thee, Richard. *
Richard: O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant

moon, that monthly changes in her circled orb, lest
that thy love prove likewise variable.
William: Thou were as a Lake Lagunita bug or a
professor who giveth an examination on the Monday
after Big Game week end to intrude.
Celia: It is not that I love thee less, Richard; it
is that I love William more.
Richard: O, direst cruelty. Thou drivest me more
insane than a grad student lost in the stacks. Or
a chemistry student who probest into pocked win
dows.
Celia: Oh, what a noble mind is here overthrown!
That noble and most sovereign reason, like sweet, bells
jangled, out of tune and harsh.
Richard: To stab or not to stab, that is the
question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to watch
The hugs and kisses of an off-eampused Deke
Or to take arms against the intruder
And by opposing, end him.
(Richard stabs William.)
William: I dieth.
Celia: Oh, a thousand curses upon thee, Richard.
All the infections that the sun sucks' up from bogs,
flats, and Lake Lag, upon Richard may fall, and
make thee by inch-meal a disease. I can't bear life
any longer. I shall stab myself and go to the undis
covered country, from whose bosom no traveler
returns.
(Celia stabbeth herself and dieth.)
Richard: Hark, what a bloody mess!
Fiist Gardener: Yea and forsooth.
Second Gardener: Verily.
(The curtain droppeth from exhaustion.)
