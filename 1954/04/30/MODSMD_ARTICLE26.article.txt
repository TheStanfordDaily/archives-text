# ITWPP Strikes Stanford
## 
### ROY BROUN CONNIE GOMPERTS 
On Tuesday The Daily re
proached Stanford for "blighted
credulity" — not one case of
pock-marked windshields had
been reported here.
And on Wednesday Stanford final
ly came through. With brand-new
symptoms, yet.
Stanford has "Inside-the-Window-
Pane Pox."
ITWPP was discovered by Don
Gage, graduate student in engineer
ing, in the Law Library.
The guilty pane, which was
stricken on its inside surface, is lo
cated on the third floor of the Law
School.
After a careful examination of the
ailing window, Gage diagnosed the
disease as ITWPP. Symptoms in
cluded a pattern of vertical streaks,
a dirty countenance, and a general
anemic appearance.
Gage described the streaks as
looking "like they had been etched
by hydrofluoric acid."
The dirt, it was theorized, might
be caused by a lapse on the part of
the janitorial staff, but nobody can
explain why a window should be
| anemic.
The window was not ill before
j the recent rainfall, Gage explained.
iHe said that he only noticed the
j streaks Wednesday.
No Farm scientist has yet ad
vanced a theory to account for the
j ITWPP case, nor have any steps
[ been taken to isolate and cure the
disease.
