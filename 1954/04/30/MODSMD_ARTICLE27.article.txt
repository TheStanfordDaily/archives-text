# German Officials Express Views in Visit to Campus

### HELEN DEWAR 
Six top West German officials, from the Bundestag— the lower
house of the Geiman parliament, yesterday were given a spotlight
tour of the campus as a part of their five-week visit to the United
States.
The six German leaders, Dr. Thomas Dehler, Adolph Gillien, 1

Rudolf Eickhoff, Horst Haasler,"
Dr. Richard Jaeger, and Dr. Kurt-
Georg Kiesinger, were invited
by the State Department to "learn
something of the American way of
life."
They were especially impressed by
the Stanford campus. "It's grand,"
one official remarked, "particularly
the wide, wide spaces which you
cannot find in Europe."
The distinguished-looking German
parliamentarians assumed a more se
rious attitude when posed with ques
tions on strategic German and inter
national issues.
The prospects of a possible Ger
man unification they viewed rather
dimly. "Just now," one German
remarked, "it doesn't seem pos
sible that Russia will give in her
stronghold (East Germany). It is
a purely military conflict, the end
of which no one cap foresee. It is
perfectly obvious, though, we will
not obtain unification by becoming
a Russian satellite."
NATO they considered "one of
the most important things for Ger
many and Europe." "Without it,"
they reasoned, "peace cannot be
kept. "Of course," one official re
marked rather winsomely, "we
would have liked to have been offi
cial NATO members, but we will ac
cept our position in the European
Defense Community as an agreeable
alternative."
One of the officials, a steel-grey
haired gentleman, who spoke most
often for the group, said he stands as
a strong defender of the EDC. "Al
though jve did not like the idea of the
French-proposed pact at the start, we
now accept it to show our French
neighbors our willingness to co
operate. The difficulty now rests
with the French," he declared.
Hopes for success of the Geneva
Conference were not so high. "The
conference," they declared, "can go
either way," although they viewed
success for the Geneva meeting with
more optimism than they had for the
Berlin Conference.
Turning to the question of Sen
ator McCarthy's impact oil Europe,
the German spokesman shook his
head, seemed t« avoid the issue and
then remarked that the controversy
is so serious that he dared not give
any definite opinions without more
extensive study. "The problem,"
he said, "is not one of a personality,
but a great issue."

Hopes for success of the Geneva
Conference were not so high. "The
conference," they declared, "can go
either way," although they viewed
success for the Geneva meeting with
more optimism than they had for the
Berlin Conference.
Turning to the question of Sen
ator McCarthy's impact oil Europe,
the German spokesman shook his
head, seemed t« avoid the issue and
then remarked that the controversy
is so serious that he dared not give
any definite opinions without more
extensive study. "The problem,"
he said, "is not one of a personality,
but a great issue."
Six top West German officials, from the Bundestag— the lower
house of the Geiman parliament, yesterday were given a spotlight
tour of the campus as a part of their five-week visit to the United
States.
The six German leaders, Dr. Thomas Dehler, Adolph Gillien, 1

Rudolf Eickhoff, Horst Haasler,"
Dr. Richard Jaeger, and Dr. Kurt-
Georg Kiesinger, were invited
by the State Department to "learn
something of the American way of
life."
They were especially impressed by
the Stanford campus. "It's grand,"
one official remarked, "particularly
the wide, wide spaces which you
cannot find in Europe."
The distinguished-looking German
parliamentarians assumed a more se
rious attitude when posed with ques
tions on strategic German and inter
national issues.
The prospects of a possible Ger
man unification they viewed rather
dimly. "Just now," one German
remarked, "it doesn't seem pos
sible that Russia will give in her
stronghold (East Germany). It is
a purely military conflict, the end
of which no one cap foresee. It is
perfectly obvious, though, we will
not obtain unification by becoming
a Russian satellite."
NATO they considered "one of
the most important things for Ger
many and Europe." "Without it,"
they reasoned, "peace cannot be
kept. "Of course," one official re
marked rather winsomely, "we
would have liked to have been offi
cial NATO members, but we will ac
cept our position in the European
Defense Community as an agreeable
alternative."
One of the officials, a steel-grey
haired gentleman, who spoke most
often for the group, said he stands as
a strong defender of the EDC. "Al
though jve did not like the idea of the
French-proposed pact at the start, we
now accept it to show our French
neighbors our willingness to co
operate. The difficulty now rests
with the French," he declared.
