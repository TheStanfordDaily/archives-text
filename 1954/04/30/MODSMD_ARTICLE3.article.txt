# Rathbun to Lead Sunday Seminars
## 
### 
Professor Harry Rathbun of the
Stanford Law School will conduct
the first of two Sunday evening dis
cussions this Sunday at 7:30 in the
South Palo Alto Library.
"What do I want in life and how
may I achieve it?" is the general sub
ject of the "lecture-discussions," as
Rathbun calls them, sponsored by the
Sequoia Seminar.
The purpose of the discussions, he
adds, is "to provide an opportunity
for critical thought and discussion
of some of the important aspects of
the problem of satisfactory living
considered in the light of contempo
rary knowledge and ideas."
The second evening seminar, on
Sunday, May 9, will also be held, in
the library, which is located three
blocks from El Camino on Wellesley
St. between College and California
Avenues. The discussions arc free of
charge and all interested students are
invited to participate.
Professor Rathbun leads the Se
quoia Seminars held at Ben Lomond,
Calif, during the summer.
