# Young, Page to Face SC In 'Vita!' Southland Set
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Sophomore Ray Young and southpaw Phil, Page have been
assigned ihe task of keeping the Stanford baseballers on top of
the CIBA and PCC standings this weekend when the Indians hook
up with Southern California's Trojans in Los Angeles.
Young, the crafty right-hander with the unbeaten league rec-

ord, will try to stop the hard-hit
ting Trojans this afternoon at Bo
vard Field, and Page will seek his
second victory over USC tomorrow.
With SC scrambling to overtake
the loop - leading Cards, the two
game set will be vital to both teams.
Even Coach Everett Dean went as
far as to say that the games ''mean
a lot to us."
The Indians hold a one-game lead
in CIBA and a two-game advantage
in the more important PCC stand
ings. Santa Clara is in the CIBA
but not the PCC.
These are the league records of
the two teams:
PCC CIIJA
Stanford 5-1 (i-2
USC 4-4 (>-4
A double Stanford win would
eliminate SC from the PCC race; a
split, without changing the stand
ings, would increase the pressure on
SC; and a Trojan sweep would
throw the league wide open.
As Dean said, "We can get well
out. in front this weekend or we can
come back with a big job ahead of
us."
And in an attempt to get "well
out in front" Dean will start the new
line-up he employed in Wednes
day's 24-1 rout of COP.
Sophomore Mickey Holzman, who
went four - for - four against COP,
will handle the hot corrter with Tom
Dandurand shifting to right and A 1
Talboy moving to first.
From fleet Sid Hall at the top
of the order to Young, who leads
the league in triples, the recently
hitterish Cards will offer a tough
challenge for the Trojan mounds
men today.
Vic Lapiner and Jack Lovrich or
Ralph Pausig will probably hurl for
SC. Lapiner went the distance
against Page in the Sunken Dia
mond earlier this month but drop
ped a 5-2 decision.
