# LUTTRELL OUT
## Tracksters Eye 2nd Win; Host UCLA 
### DON WEBSTER 
After losing their last three
dual meets, Stanford's track
team will attempt to get back
on the winning trail tomorrow
as they host an improving UCLA
cinder squad in the Stanford
Stadium.
The field events are scheduled to
start at 1:30, with the track events
beginning at 2 p.m.
Coach Jack Weiershauser's team
has lost to Michigan, USC, and Oc
cidental. Last week in the south
land they broke three meet records,
yet lost by 25 points. Their only
victory of the season was in the ini
tial outing against Fresno State.
The Cards have been dealt a stag
gering blow to their victory hopes,
/or ace hurdler Jim Luttrell has re
injured a leg muscle and won't par
ticipate. Worse than that, according
to Weiershauser, "it is more than
likely he will also miss the Big
Meet with California a week from
Saturday."
Originally most experts had doped
the meet to be a close one with the
relay deciding it in Stanford's favor.
Now with Luttrell sidelined, it is
anybody's guess as to the outcome.
He was favored to win the low hur
dles and take either a second or
third in the highs.
To replace him, Weiershauser will
move Gerry Wood; who is favored
in the highs, and also enter him in
the lows. However, running in both

hurdle events he will miss the all
important relay. Judging from ear
lier performances the Cards have
quite an edge over the Bruins in this
event, and they hope Wood's loss
won't make a difference.
According to the dope sheet, a
number of events may be swept by
one of the teams. Stanford could
take all the places in the javelin,
220, 440, and high jump, and the
Bruins may sweep the mile, two
mile, and possibly the pole vault.
If the meet is close near the finish
the final relay event will be a thrill
er. It gives five points to the win
ner and none to the loser. Bill Rupp,
Walt Garrett, and Fred George arc
the regular relay men, and Wood's
place will be taken by either Keith
Brownsberger, Larry Spicer, or Roy
Smith. With Wood running, the
Cards have clocked a 3:16.3 relay
while the Bruins have done no bet
ter than 3:26.8 this season.
The visitors have three milers
who arc faster than any Indian, and
no Card miler has come within 16
seconds of the best two two-mile
times. Two Bruin pole vaulters
have done 13-6, and the third vault
er is on a par with Stanford's best
at 13 feet even.
