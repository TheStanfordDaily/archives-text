THE BATTLE OF LAKE LAGUNITA—An "Atomic Flubmarine," the Phi Sig-Stillman entry
which won the humor trophy, advances broadside toward the heavily manned Zete "tub-of
war" in the last phases of a mud battle during yesterday's Junior Water Carnival at Lake Lag.
El Toro's "What Future?" float, in the shape of an atomic cloud, won the sweepstakes trophy.
The Zetes were given special mention as the most destructive entry.
