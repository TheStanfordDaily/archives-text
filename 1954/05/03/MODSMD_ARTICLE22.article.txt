# Residents and Faculty Protest VA Hospital Site
## 
### RUTH JAHNKE 
Residents of neighboring communities and members of the fac
ulty are protesting the location of the proposed Veterans Admin
istration psychiatric hospital on Stanford land at Page Mill Road
and Junipero Serra Boulevard.
Lloyd Dinkelspiel, president of the Board of Trustees, told The

Daily last night that the board has
received four letters so far — one
from a half-dozen residents on Page
Mill Road, one from a single resi
dent, one handwritten with several
signatures, and one from a faculty
member. The Palo Alto Times re
ported last week that "an estimated
50 letters" had been sent to the
board protesting the hospital site.
Dinkelspiel slated that the board
would "listen to all evidence, pro and
con, before coming to a conclusion."
The primary arguments expressed
in the letters of protest are that
property values would be lowered,
and that the community, especially
children, would have to be ade
quately educated to the problems of
living near a psychiatric hospital.
Members of the faculty are cir
culating a petition of protest in ad
dition, according to reports received
by The Daily.
George Morell, member of the
Board of Trustees, was contacted
by The Daily but declined to
comment on the issue. He pointed
out that an official proposal from
the VA has not yet been received
by the University; and that when
such a proposal is received, it will
be considered by the board, prob
ably at the May 20 meeting.
Assistant to the President Fred -
eric O. Glover also declined to give
his opinion on the controversy when
contacted by The Daily. He did say,
however, that the land presumably
under consideration by the VA is
unzoned grazing land bordered on
two sides by the campus and by land
zoned for light industry which lies
between the hospital site and El Ca
mino Real The land on the other
two sides of the site is also unzoned,
and may eventually be either light
industrial or residential areas, Glo
ver said.
Glover also commented on the
history of the Menlo Park VA psy
chiatric hospuital. When it was con
verted to a psychiatric hospital
about 25 years ago, it was sur
rounded on three sides by vacant
land and on the fourth by St. Pat
rick's Seminary. It is now bor
dered by good residential districts,
he said.
The University does not yet know
how many acres nor which acreage
the VA has selected for the hospital
site, Glover added.

dent, one handwritten with several
signatures, and one from a faculty
member. The Palo Alto Times re
ported last week that "an estimated
50 letters" had been sent to the
board protesting the hospital site.
Dinkelspiel slated that the board
would "listen to all evidence, pro and
con, before coming to a conclusion."
The primary arguments expressed
in the letters of protest are that
property values would be lowered,
and that the community, especially
children, would have to be ade
quately educated to the problems of
living near a psychiatric hospital.
Members of the faculty are cir
culating a petition of protest in ad
dition, according to reports received
by The Daily.
George Morell, member of the
Board of Trustees, was contacted
by The Daily but declined to
comment on the issue. He pointed
out that an official proposal from
the VA has not yet been received
by the University; and that when
such a proposal is received, it will
be considered by the board, prob
ably at the May 20 meeting.
Assistant to the President Fred -
eric O. Glover also declined to give
his opinion on the controversy when
contacted by The Daily. He did say,
however, that the land presumably
under consideration by the VA is
unzoned grazing land bordered on
two sides by the campus and by land
zoned for light industry which lies
between the hospital site and El Ca
mino Real The land on the other
two sides of the site is also unzoned,
and may eventually be either light
industrial or residential areas, Glo
ver said.
Glover also commented on the
history of the Menlo Park VA psy
chiatric hospuital. When it was con
verted to a psychiatric hospital
about 25 years ago, it was sur
rounded on three sides by vacant
land and on the fourth by St. Pat
rick's Seminary. It is now bor
dered by good residential districts,
he said.
The University does not yet know
how many acres nor which acreage
the VA has selected for the hospital
site, Glover added.
