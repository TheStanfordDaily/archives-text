# Dulles and the Facts
## 
### 
One week ago the Big Four Conference on
the Far East opened in Geneva. The issues fac
ing the foreign ministers then are still before
them today, namely a permanent peace settle
ment for Korea and an end to the Indochina
war.
While our top statesmen and diplomats talk
in Geneva, Indochina's situation makes one
fact painfully evident. Our "stand firm" policy,
drummed into our Western allies by a deter
mined John Foster Dulles, is resting on a very
shaky foundation.
We, the United States, have asserted we will
stick by our French allies in Indochina. We
are losing.
The Communists have whittled the French
garrison at Dien Eien Phu down to a line of
defense less than a mile wide. U.S. air support
hasn't been enough to overcome the invaders.
The fall of this key fortress may come in a few
hours.
Despite these reverses, Secretary Dulles has
squared his jaw and steadfastly continued to

spurn the idea of possible compromise. When
questioned about partition, a plan favored by
the British, he snapped:
"The only partition I would favor would be to
set apart a place way up north about the size
of this room, and lock up all the Communists
there."
Such a flippant statement, typical of his atti
tude toward any change in our "firm stand," is
ill-timed and uncalled for. It doesn't worry the
Communists who are winning at Dien Bien Phu.
It doesn't encourage the French who are mak
ing their last desperate stand.
Above all, it doesn't impress the American
people, who have indicated in the past two
weeks they are unwilling to engage in all-out
war in Indochina, the one alternative left to
compromise or defeat.
The time has come for Secretary Dulles to
square our policy with the facts, to worry less
about "standing firm" and more about looking
for a compromise to salvage something from
the ruins. Or we may find ourselves with no
Indochina on which to base an "Asia Policy."
