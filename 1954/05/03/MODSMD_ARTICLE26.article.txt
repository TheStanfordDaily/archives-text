## Ike and Leadership 
### 
To the Editor:
As a military figure in recent years, the man who
is now president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, convinced
millions of people that he was the national and world
leader so badly needed in these times.
Tlie question is now seriously raised whether or
not he hung up his personal leadership with his
Army clothes.
In connection with the present McCarthy contro
versy, people are saying, "Ike is going to let Mc-
Carthy hang himself." This appears more and more
to be painfully true.
In all fairness to the President, it must be said that
there were many political issues in which he had to
feel himself out! However, such was not the case
with McCarthy and his cohorts, one of whom has long
since smeared Ike's friend and benefactor, General
Marshall as "a traitor, a liviny lie."

Granted there were political expediencies which
may have forced Eisenhower's hand in the presi
dential campaign in which he endorsed McCarthy,
these considerations should not have been so trans
cendent as to prohibit Ike from "lowering the boom"
now, at a time when the issue McCarthy seems about
to effectively wreck a large part of a very urgent
legislative program.
For all his shortcomings, Harry Truman would
have risked impeachment rather than prostrate the
presidency before McCarthy's committee. This is,
of course, hypothetical, but it is almost inconceivable
that Truman would have allowed a "General Zwicker
affair."
It is my faith that Eisenhower has convictions; it
is about time for him to show the courage of those
convictions.
