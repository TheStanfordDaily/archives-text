# In Support of Workman

To the Editor
It has been called to my attention that The Stan
ford Daily has been carrying on an argumentive dis
cussion concerning the plan to bring over a Com
munist exchange student to the University.
I could be greatly mistaken, but I am inclined to
believe that in so doing you would be completely
missing your original purpose of the exchange schol
arship.
I am in agreement with the fact that the inter
changing of views with a student having a philoso
phy different from ours would be both an interesting
and an enlightening experience.
However, I have understood that the rather large
sum taken to finance this experiment was and is
meant primarily for the all-important purpose of
creating a better understanding of our American way

of life, and in so doing to erase a few of the many
distorted views that are held by the intelligent as
well as ithe ignorant. This is what Dave Workman
has been saying. We should give him our full sup
port.
Any intelligent young person having even a slight
realization of conditions behind the "iron curtain"
today is aware that a Communist returning (there is
a chance he would not return) to Russia would hardly
be able to correct any distorted views on America
held by his fellow-men without endangering his very
life.
Do you not think that the scholarship should be
given to a more worthy student? A student whose
tongue would not be tied?
