# Cornflakes Aid in Building American School System
## 
### JAE HUNLEY 
Cornflakes and Rice Krispies are helping to improve America's
school system—through a foundation set up by W. K. Kellogg.
This project, known as the Co-operative Program in Educa
tional Administration or CPEA, was founded in 1950 when it was
realized that administration in public schools needed analysis

and reappraisal. Representa-
tives from the American Asso
ciation of School Administrators
and other organizations 'approached
the Kellogg Foundation for funds to
sponsor an inquiry into the school
situation.
After investigation, the Kellogg
Foundation allotted over mil
lion to eight universities including
Harvard, Ohio State, and Stanford.
Stanford's grant amounted to $260,-
000.
Each university was assigned an
area to supervise. Stanford's, known
as the Pacific Southwest Region,
consists of Wyoming, Arizona, Utah,
Nevada, and California. Several
committees were formed to direct
the project with Professor William
R. Odell of the Stanford School of
Education as director.
The purposes of this program are:
1. Take inventory of the pres
ent status of public school admin
istration in the several regions of
the United States and analyze di
rections of change.
2. Enlist the co-operation of all
interested institutions, associa
tions, and organizations, agencies,
and individuals in this process of
appraisal.
3. Formulate new co-ordinated
programs of action and research
based upon identified problems
and needs, both in the actual
practice of public school adminis
tration and in the educational pro
grams designed to select, prepare,
and develop leaders iu this area of
public service.
In order to do thus, the Pacific
Southwest Region was divided into
small groups, each with its own
project. For example, there is a Utah
committee investigating "The Role
of the Superintendent of Schools
in Instructional Leadership." Also,
there are several community proj
ect centers, such as ones in Ala
meda, Fresno, Sacramento, and San
Jose.
These groups have, after only
three years of work, begun the
practice of internship of prospective
public school administrators, pro
gressed in the selection of beginning
administrators in a number of com
munities, and organized a mono
graph series in education adminis
tration.
In the next two years, the CPEA
hopes to continue and round off its
Program. Regional Director Odell,
who has served full-time for the
last three years, will serve part
time during the next two years.

and individuals in this process of
appraisal.
3. Formulate new co-ordinated
programs of action and research
based upon identified problems
and needs, both in the actual
practice of public school adminis
tration and in the educational pro
grams designed to select, prepare,
and develop leaders iu this area of
public service.
In order to do thus, the Pacific
Southwest Region was divided into
small groups, each with its own
project. For example, there is a Utah
committee investigating "The Role
of the Superintendent of Schools
in Instructional Leadership." Also,
there are several community proj
ect centers, such as ones in Ala
meda, Fresno, Sacramento, and San
Jose.
These groups have, after only
three years of work, begun the
practice of internship of prospective
public school administrators, pro
gressed in the selection of beginning
administrators in a number of com
munities, and organized a mono
graph series in education adminis
tration.
In the next two years, the CPEA
hopes to continue and round off its
Program. Regional Director Odell,
who has served full-time for the
last three years, will serve part
time during the next two years.

Cornflakes and Rice Krispies are helping to improve America's
school system—through a foundation set up by W. K. Kellogg.
This project, known as the Co-operative Program in Educa
tional Administration or CPEA, was founded in 1950 when it was
realized that administration in public schools needed analysis

and reappraisal. Representa-
tives from the American Asso
ciation of School Administrators
and other organizations 'approached
the Kellogg Foundation for funds to
sponsor an inquiry into the school
situation.
After investigation, the Kellogg
Foundation allotted over mil
lion to eight universities including
Harvard, Ohio State, and Stanford.
Stanford's grant amounted to $260,-
000.
Each university was assigned an
area to supervise. Stanford's, known
as the Pacific Southwest Region,
consists of Wyoming, Arizona, Utah,
Nevada, and California. Several
committees were formed to direct
the project with Professor William
R. Odell of the Stanford School of
Education as director.
The purposes of this program are:
1. Take inventory of the pres
ent status of public school admin
istration in the several regions of
the United States and analyze di
rections of change.
2. Enlist the co-operation of all
interested institutions, associa
tions, and organizations, agencies,
and individuals in this process of
appraisal.
3. Formulate new co-ordinated
programs of action and research
based upon identified problems
and needs, both in the actual
practice of public school adminis
tration and in the educational pro
grams designed to select, prepare,
and develop leaders iu this area of
public service.
