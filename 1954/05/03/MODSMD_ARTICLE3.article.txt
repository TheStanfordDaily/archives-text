# Graves Names Issues in '54 State Election
## 
### HADLEY ROFF 
Richard Graves, democratic
; candidate for governor, spot
lighted the two issues he thinks
: should stand paramount in the
developing gubernatorial race,
when interviewed Saturday by
The Daily. They are:
1. The organization of the re
| sources of state government "which
| cfTcct the progress of industrial and
I economic expansion."
2. The protection of freedom and
democracy, particularly in the
j schools and universities.
Graves, speaking hastily before
entering a meeting of Stanford's
| chapter of Pi Sigma Alpha, political
science honorary, stressed that aside
from the two primary issues there
! are a number of auxiliary and sup
{ plementary problems that deserve
i immediate state attention.
He included among these air pol
j lution control, transportation, water

Richard Graves, D e m o c r a t i c
j candidate for Governor, will ad

i in Cubberley Auditorium Wed
i nesday at S p.m. on the subject
"The Challenge to Free Education
! in California."

and hydro-electric development, and
tax reforms.
Citint; California's continued sharp
up-swing in population, Graves said
that some economic planning on the
part of the state government is vital
to meet "the needs of a growing
state and a growing labor fovcc."
Currently, Graves charged, the
state has "no policy aimed at solv
ing the state's economic problems—
has no sense of direction."
To offset tiiis alleged deficiency,
Graves suggested the creation of a j
special state development agency I
which would advise the Governor!
on economic matters.
Turning to what he terms the sec
ond great issue—that of freedom and
democracy — Graves said that the
issues in this regard arc "more
clearly drawn here in California"
than in any other state.
He said that freedom, particularly
that of education, is in double jeop
ardy "from Communism on the one
hand and the right wing, of which
McCarthy is the symbol, on the
other."
Of the controversial oath demand
ed of all state employees and public
school teachers, Graves said some- )
what scornfully, "You don't deal |
with the problems of subversion j
with oaths."
