# Tribe Wins Relay, Meet
## Bruin Cindermen Defeated, 67-63; Long Sets New Meet Javelin Record 
### DON WEBSTER 
Stanford's trackmen came- from j
behind in the final event Saturday i
:o edge UCLA's Bruins, and al
though the outcome was about as
anticipated, the meet was full of
surprises.
The final score of the contest was
37Va to 63. As had been predicted,
the battle was neck-and-neck going
into the final mile relay event,
where a Stanford win collected five
points and the victory. After being
jonsiderably ahead most of the meet,
the Cards trailed by a 63 1/ 2-62M> !
count as the relay started.
Saturday's duel was the Cards'
final meet preparation for next j
week's Big Meet with California.
Though the outcome was no sur
prise, the way it came about was. j
The meet's first activity began as i
Tony Wetter of the Bruins heaved
the shot 52-7Va, a full foot farther :
than he had this season. It was good
lor a first place and five points that
Stanford had counted upon.
A meet record was shattered by
the Cards' Leo Long, who heaved
the javelin 226-11V 2 to break Bud
Held's 1949 mark of 224-8 1 , / 2. It was
the best collegiate javelin toss in the
country this year.
However, the Cards had expected
to sweep this event and the 440. and
in both they lost precious third
place points.
Sophomore Roy Smith helped the
Indian cause with a first place in the
broad jump. John Walker of the
visitors, who has done as well as
23-4Vi> and was favored, couldn't
better 21-9 I ,£ Saturday as Smith
took the event with a 22-8 :: 8 effort.
Keith Brownsberger was the day's
only double winner with victories j
in the 100 and the 220. Stanford re- |
covered most of the points hereto- j
fore lost with an unexpected sweep !
of the 220.
Then the Bruins began their up- ;
hill comeback. They took 1-3 in the 1

I two-mile and 2-3 In the high hur
dles behind Gerry Wood. The latter
J event was costly, through, for Wood
pulled a leg muscle and couldn't
participate in the lows. UCLA was
then able to sweep this event and
also took 1-3 in the 880 and 1-2 in
the discus. Thus the relay was the
decider.
The Card relay team has consist
ently run about 1U seconds faster
than the Bruins, but two of the
Stanford regulars were out —Wood
| and captain Fred George. So sprint- j
j er Jim Truher and half-miler Larry
Spicer were recruited to take over
with regulars Bill Rupp and Walt
Garrett.
UCLA was barely ahead after the
j first lap. In the second, Garrett
sprinted and passed his opponent, j
Spicer, running third, took full ad
j vantage of the lead given him and
; increased it considerably. Rupp at
the anchor post did likewise, and i
crossed the tape 25 yards ahead of j
his opponent to give Stanford the '■
event and the meet.

Stanford's trackmen came- from j
behind in the final event Saturday i
:o edge UCLA's Bruins, and al
though the outcome was about as
anticipated, the meet was full of
surprises.
The final score of the contest was
37Va to 63. As had been predicted,
the battle was neck-and-neck going
into the final mile relay event,
where a Stanford win collected five
points and the victory. After being
jonsiderably ahead most of the meet,
the Cards trailed by a 63 1/ 2-62M> !
count as the relay started.
Saturday's duel was the Cards'
final meet preparation for next j
week's Big Meet with California.
Though the outcome was no sur
prise, the way it came about was. j
The meet's first activity began as i
Tony Wetter of the Bruins heaved
the shot 52-7Va, a full foot farther :
than he had this season. It was good
lor a first place and five points that
Stanford had counted upon.
A meet record was shattered by
the Cards' Leo Long, who heaved
the javelin 226-11V 2 to break Bud
Held's 1949 mark of 224-8 1 , / 2. It was
the best collegiate javelin toss in the
country this year.
However, the Cards had expected
to sweep this event and the 440. and
in both they lost precious third
place points.
Sophomore Roy Smith helped the
Indian cause with a first place in the
broad jump. John Walker of the
visitors, who has done as well as
23-4Vi> and was favored, couldn't
better 21-9 I ,£ Saturday as Smith
took the event with a 22-8 :: 8 effort.
Keith Brownsberger was the day's
only double winner with victories j
in the 100 and the 220. Stanford re- |
covered most of the points hereto- j
fore lost with an unexpected sweep !
of the 220.
Then the Bruins began their up- ;
hill comeback. They took 1-3 in the 1

I two-mile and 2-3 In the high hur
dles behind Gerry Wood. The latter
J event was costly, through, for Wood
pulled a leg muscle and couldn't
participate in the lows. UCLA was
then able to sweep this event and
also took 1-3 in the 880 and 1-2 in
the discus. Thus the relay was the
decider.
The Card relay team has consist
ently run about 1U seconds faster
than the Bruins, but two of the
Stanford regulars were out —Wood
| and captain Fred George. So sprint- j
j er Jim Truher and half-miler Larry
Spicer were recruited to take over
with regulars Bill Rupp and Walt
Garrett.
UCLA was barely ahead after the
j first lap. In the second, Garrett
sprinted and passed his opponent, j
Spicer, running third, took full ad
j vantage of the lead given him and
; increased it considerably. Rupp at
the anchor post did likewise, and i
crossed the tape 25 yards ahead of j
his opponent to give Stanford the '■
event and the meet.
