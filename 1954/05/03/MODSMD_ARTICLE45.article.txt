They were a wonderful audience.
The little boys propped up in their beds, the little girls sitting
cross-legged on the floor in their red and white playsuits, and the
runabouts, clustered in the schoolroom.

students who had come to the Con
Home to entertain them. It was sim
ple entertainment — songs, magic
tricks, and an accordion solo. But

They reacted in many ways.
One little boy, lying quietly in his

j bed, became the proud assistant of
I the magician. Impressed, he pushed
himself to a sitting position, and be
gan to examine intently the iron
| rings "to make sure that there arc
jno holes in them." After a grave
: examination, he handed them back
with an official O.K.
An enthusiastic rendition of "Lit-
I tie Peter Rabbit," complete with
\ gestures, was given by one little girl.
} Giggling, she went through the song,
j waving her arms with such abandon
: that she displaced the perky red
bow on her head.

j chairman Paul Bissinger showed the
i group how to play a bagpipe—a na
! sal hum (punctuated by shrill lit
| tie-girl laughter).
This kind of session is a monthly
I event for Bissinger and his Enter
tainment Committee, who try to get
j a varied group of entertainment for
the Con Home children.
The entertainment program wa.s
j started two years ago. and has been
