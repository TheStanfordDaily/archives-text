## 
### 
Business Manager Alf E. Brandin
stated last week that University of
ficials are anxious to have Palo Alto
decide which route is desired for the
South Palo Alto underpass, provid
ing a continuous east - west route
ending at Bay shore.
Brandin said that the University
will move Page Mill Road north
ward to connect directly with Grant
Avenue, which is directly across the
railroad tracks from Oregon Ave
nue, if Palo Alto decides on the Ore
gon underpass.
If the city rejects the Oregon
Avenue plan, the University will
leave Page Mill Road where it is.
Brandin indicated that location of
the underpass and road will affect
negotiations with two new clients
for sites in that area zoned for light
industry.
He added his opinion, that "the
only feasible route for straight
through traffic (in the South Palo
Alto area) is the Oregon Avenue
route."
