# SC Nine Jolts Tribe's Hopes For CIBA Flag
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
For Stanford's baseball foam,
it was a disastrous Southland
junket. For USC's baseball
team, it was a tremendous,
backs-against-the-wall perform
ance.
In other words, the Indian dia
inondmen of Coach Everett Dean
dropped a two-game series to the
Trojans. The Tribe threw away Fri
day's tilt, 6-3, and then was bat

The double loss knocked the
Cards out of first place in the CIBA
and into a virtual tie with Troy in

Trojans winning the series three
games to one. The two teams split

only eight hits in his losing effort.
Card bobbles set up two-run clus
ters for SC in the first and second
innings and again in the fourth. The
errors were committed by Rich
Seramaglia, Al Talboy, Bob Evans,
Ray Swartz, and Mickey Holzman.
But Holzman, who was just moved
to a first-string berth, helped make
up for bis miscue by smacking three
hits in four trips, scoring one run,
