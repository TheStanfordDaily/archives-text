# SC Nine Jolts Tribe's Hopes For CIBA Flag
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
For Stanford's baseball foam,
it was a disastrous Southland
junket. For USC's baseball
team, it was a tremendous,
backs-against-the-wall perform
ance.
In other words, the Indian dia
inondmen of Coach Everett Dean
dropped a two-game series to the
Trojans. The Tribe threw away Fri
day's tilt, 6-3, and then was bat
tered Saturday, 10-1.
The double loss knocked the
Cards out of first place in the CIBA
and into a virtual tie with Troy in
the PCC's Southern Division stand
ings.
If the results had been reversed,
Stanford would be far ahead of the
pack with a three-game lead in the
CIBA..
As it is, the Trojans have cap
tured eight CIBA games against four
losses while Stanford has a six-and
four record, giving SC a full gamr
lead. In the PCC the Indians have
a five-and-three mark against, the
Trojans' six-and-four, putting Stan
ford ahead by 25 percentage points.
The three other CIBA clubs—Cal
ifornia, Santa Clara, and UCl.A—
figure to have little chance of over
taking the front runners.
The games this weekend conclud
ed direct competition between SC
and Stanford this season with the
Trojans winning the series three
games to one. The two teams split
a doublehcader in the Sunken Dia
mond last month.
Ray Young, previously unbeaten
in CIBA play, didn't allow an earned
run in Friday's game, but six errors
by his mates cost him his first de
feat.
Young walked no one and gave up
only eight hits in his losing effort.
Card bobbles set up two-run clus
ters for SC in the first and second
innings and again in the fourth. The
errors were committed by Rich
Seramaglia, Al Talboy, Bob Evans,
Ray Swartz, and Mickey Holzman.
But Holzman, who was just moved
to a first-string berth, helped make
up for bis miscue by smacking three
hits in four trips, scoring one run,
and driving in another.
Scramaglia and Warren Goodrich
cracked doubles and Goodrich and
Tom Dandurand drove in the other
runs, but the Cards' nine-hit attack
was stifled by the pitching of Vic
Lapiner and three SC double plays.
Saturday the Trojans blasted Phil
Page, who had beaten them earlier,
off the mound with four- and three
run splurges in the fifth and sixth
frames, following an opening score
in the first.
SC added a pair of tallies off Mike
Acker in the seventh.
Catcher John Garten and first
baseman and basketball player Chet
Carr hit home runs for the winners
and Garten chased home six runs.
Page gave up eight bases on balls
and a wild pitch, and the Trojans
stranded 10 men on the base paths.
Marty Zaunich restricted Stan
ford to only three base knocks—sin
gles by Holzman, Goodrich, and
Scramaglia — and two walks. The
Indians' run came in the first and
they didn't get a hit after the fifth.
