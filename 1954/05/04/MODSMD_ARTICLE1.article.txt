# 20 Faculty Members Sign Petition Opposing Hospital
## 
### RUTH JAHNKE 
A petition signed by 20 members of the faculty who live in
the Frenchman's Road-Foothill Road area protesting the location
of the Veterans' Administration psychiatric hospital on Stanford
land at Page Mill Road and Junipero Serra Boulevard was made
available to The Daily last night.
The petition is dated Feb. 8, 1954, when it was sent to President

J. E. Wallace Sterling and to Busi
ness Manager Alf E. Brandin. About
three weeks ago, copies of the peti
tion were mailed to Lloyd Dinkel
spicl, president of the Board of
Trustees, and to Congressman
Charles Gubser, according to Pro
fessors Virgil A. Anderson and Ana
tole G. Mazour.
The text of the petition fol
lows:
Wc, the undersigned residents of
the Stanford campus, understand
that the University is considering
the leasing of a plot of land to the
Veterans' Administration for the
construction of a neuro-psychiatric
hospital. We further understand
that one of the sites under consid
eration is along Page Mill Road,
roughly between the Eastman Ko
dak site and Foothill Road. We, the
undersigned, protest most strongly
any consideration of this site for the
following reasons:
1. This site is much too close to
one of the finest residence areas on
the campus. We are convinced that
the presence of this hospital would
be detrimental to the undersigned
because:
a) The presence of the hospital
would constitute a threat to the
property values of the homes
owned by the undersigned.
b) The presence of the hospital
would constitute a further threat
to the security and peace of mind
of the undersigned residents. The
patients served by such a hospital
arc emotionally and mentally dis
turbed individuals who arc not to
be trusted because their behavior
is not predictable. It is an estab
lished fact that they do escape
and that they often became vio
lent. The residences of the under
signed arc among the closest habi
tations to the proposed site and
might well be the first places

where escaped patients or inmates
otherwise outside of the hospital
would seek refuge or other assist
ance. We would not feel secure
in leaving our families open to
such possibilities.
2. We feel that the establishment
of this hospital on the site proposed
would be a serious mistake from the
point of view of the best interests of
both the University and the under
signed residents. We built or pur
chased our homes with the full ex
pectation that this area would re
main a residence area of high cali
ber. We feel that it is to all our
best interests to protect it from any
influences that would make it a
less desirable place to live and bring
up a family.
3. Quite apart from our own per
sonal interests in the matter, we
further feel that the presence of an
institution such as this on the site
proposed would be detrimental to
the safety and best interests of the
students at Stanford. A number of
the student residences, including
those of the women, are much too
close to such a site. Moreover, the
area of Frenchman's Road and the
fields and hills above Foothill Road
are favorite spots for student hikes
and outings. We fpel that the pres
ence of the hospital would be ex
tremely undesirable, from the point
of view of the best interests of these
students.
It should be made clear that we
arc not objecting to the Univer
sity's policy of making optimum use
of its land resources, nor of consid
ering the Veterans' Hospital as a
desirable enterprise. It is solely this
site that we are opposed to.
Respectfully submitted,

influences that would make it a
less desirable place to live and bring
up a family.
3. Quite apart from our own per
sonal interests in the matter, we
further feel that the presence of an
institution such as this on the site
proposed would be detrimental to
the safety and best interests of the
students at Stanford. A number of
the student residences, including
those of the women, are much too
close to such a site. Moreover, the
area of Frenchman's Road and the
fields and hills above Foothill Road
are favorite spots for student hikes
and outings. We fpel that the pres
ence of the hospital would be ex
tremely undesirable, from the point
of view of the best interests of these
students.
It should be made clear that we
arc not objecting to the Univer
sity's policy of making optimum use
of its land resources, nor of consid
ering the Veterans' Hospital as a
desirable enterprise. It is solely this
site that we are opposed to.
Respectfully submitted,

A petition signed by 20 members of the faculty who live in
the Frenchman's Road-Foothill Road area protesting the location
of the Veterans' Administration psychiatric hospital on Stanford
land at Page Mill Road and Junipero Serra Boulevard was made
available to The Daily last night.
The petition is dated Feb. 8, 1954, when it was sent to President

J. E. Wallace Sterling and to Busi
ness Manager Alf E. Brandin. About
three weeks ago, copies of the peti
tion were mailed to Lloyd Dinkel
spicl, president of the Board of
Trustees, and to Congressman
Charles Gubser, according to Pro
fessors Virgil A. Anderson and Ana
tole G. Mazour.
The text of the petition fol
lows:
Wc, the undersigned residents of
the Stanford campus, understand
that the University is considering
the leasing of a plot of land to the
Veterans' Administration for the
construction of a neuro-psychiatric
hospital. We further understand
that one of the sites under consid
eration is along Page Mill Road,
roughly between the Eastman Ko
dak site and Foothill Road. We, the
undersigned, protest most strongly
any consideration of this site for the
following reasons:
1. This site is much too close to
one of the finest residence areas on
the campus. We are convinced that
the presence of this hospital would
be detrimental to the undersigned
because:
a) The presence of the hospital
would constitute a threat to the
property values of the homes
owned by the undersigned.
b) The presence of the hospital
would constitute a further threat
to the security and peace of mind
of the undersigned residents. The
patients served by such a hospital
arc emotionally and mentally dis
turbed individuals who arc not to
be trusted because their behavior
is not predictable. It is an estab
lished fact that they do escape
and that they often became vio
lent. The residences of the under
signed arc among the closest habi
tations to the proposed site and
might well be the first places

where escaped patients or inmates
otherwise outside of the hospital
would seek refuge or other assist
ance. We would not feel secure
in leaving our families open to
such possibilities.
2. We feel that the establishment
of this hospital on the site proposed
would be a serious mistake from the
point of view of the best interests of
both the University and the under
signed residents. We built or pur
chased our homes with the full ex
pectation that this area would re
main a residence area of high cali
ber. We feel that it is to all our
best interests to protect it from any
influences that would make it a
less desirable place to live and bring
up a family.
