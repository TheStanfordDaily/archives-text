# Will Herberg Opens Series On Religion

### RUTH WOLPE 
Will Herberg, visiting Jewish
lay theologian, tackled the phil
osophical - rational approach to
religion yesterday afternoon.
He will speak again tomorrow
and Friday at 4:15 p.m. in the
Women's Clubhouse.
He told the audience that filled
the auditorium of the Women's
Clubhouse that the primary conten
tion of this approach is that unaided
human reason can elicit and estab
lish the basic truths of religion and
ethics.
Giving the background of the
philosophical - rational approach,
Herberg discussed the main divi
sions of Scholastic thought.
He first presented St. Anselm's
view that by contemplating the na
ture of being, aside from any expe
rience, the mind can establish the
existence of God.
Anselm's position was categori
cally rejected by St. Thomas Aqui
nas, who developed his famous five
proofs for the existence of God on
the basis of an analysis of experi
ence.
After outlining the Scholastic
views, Herberg brought out the tra
ditional philosophic and religious
refutations.
"Philosophically the whole en
terprise is dubious because it
doesn't take into account the limi
tations of human reason," Herberg
declared. He explained further
that human reason cannot grasp
ultimate truths because it is finite
and warped by self-interest.
More important than philosophic
objections, Herberg felt, were the
religious difficulties.
There is no reason to believe that
the personal God of the Christian-
Jewish faith is the same God postu
lated by the philosophers, Herberg
argued. "Can anyone pray to a
Prime Mover?" he demanded.
Even assuming the truth of Aqui
nas' proofs, Herberg said, one is
faced with the question of which is
more ultimate, a set of rational
principles or God.
To validate God by rational
proof, he declared, means that
God is not ultimate because He
stands in need of ratification.
This leads to "religious confusion
in that one starts out to prove the
divinity of God and ends up
proving the divinity of man's rea
son."
Herberg next discussed natural
law which holds that man through
the use of reason can establish as
valid certain principles of right and
wrong.
He criticized this system, saying
that under it God would necessarily
be bound by man-created intrinsic
universals or "eternal verities." This
presents God as a "constitutional
monarch" enforcing a# higher law
rather than a Sovereign Lord.

Will Herberg, visiting Jewish
lay theologian, tackled the phil
osophical - rational approach to
religion yesterday afternoon.
He will speak again tomorrow
and Friday at 4:15 p.m. in the
Women's Clubhouse.
He told the audience that filled
the auditorium of the Women's
Clubhouse that the primary conten
tion of this approach is that unaided
human reason can elicit and estab
lish the basic truths of religion and
ethics.
Giving the background of the
philosophical - rational approach,
Herberg discussed the main divi
sions of Scholastic thought.
He first presented St. Anselm's
view that by contemplating the na
ture of being, aside from any expe
rience, the mind can establish the
existence of God.
Anselm's position was categori
cally rejected by St. Thomas Aqui
nas, who developed his famous five
proofs for the existence of God on
the basis of an analysis of experi
ence.
After outlining the Scholastic
views, Herberg brought out the tra
ditional philosophic and religious
refutations.
"Philosophically the whole en
terprise is dubious because it
doesn't take into account the limi
tations of human reason," Herberg
declared. He explained further
that human reason cannot grasp
ultimate truths because it is finite
and warped by self-interest.
More important than philosophic
objections, Herberg felt, were the
religious difficulties.
There is no reason to believe that
the personal God of the Christian-
Jewish faith is the same God postu
lated by the philosophers, Herberg
argued. "Can anyone pray to a
Prime Mover?" he demanded.
Even assuming the truth of Aqui
nas' proofs, Herberg said, one is
faced with the question of which is
more ultimate, a set of rational
principles or God.
To validate God by rational
proof, he declared, means that
God is not ultimate because He
stands in need of ratification.
This leads to "religious confusion
in that one starts out to prove the
divinity of God and ends up
proving the divinity of man's rea
son."
Herberg next discussed natural
law which holds that man through
the use of reason can establish as
valid certain principles of right and
wrong.
He criticized this system, saying
that under it God would necessarily
be bound by man-created intrinsic
universals or "eternal verities." This
presents God as a "constitutional
monarch" enforcing a# higher law
rather than a Sovereign Lord.
