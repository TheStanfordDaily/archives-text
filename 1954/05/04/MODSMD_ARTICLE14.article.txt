# Results of Honor Code Polling Are Announced
## Excom to Hear Report Proposals 
### 
The special ASSU Honor Code
Committee has released the fig
ures on the Code questionnaire
circulated to 2,384 students in
the recent discussion program
and has announced that it will
submit its report to the Execu
tive Committee tomorrow night.
The results of the questionnaire
indicate that 62 per cent of the par
ticipating students consider it a
"right" to take exams from the test
ing room. And 64 per cent of those
questioned answered that they were
against a departmental method in
resolving the problem of removing
exams from the room.
But the committee has empha
sized that its report and recommen
dations to Excom tomorrow night
will not be dictated solely by the
questionnaii-e results. Those results
and the reports on the living group
discussions are the two sources on
which the committee is basing its
report and recommendations.
"The questionnaire was NOT
meant to be a student referendum
or vote," according to committee
chairman Jeannie Bobis in re
leasing the figures. "We were not
looking for specific answers, but
for broad opinions of the stu
dents."
Committee members indicated
that they were "pleased" at the re
sults of the discussions and the in
terest shown by students on prob
lems of Honor Code interpretation.
Over 70 per cent of the students
who filled out the questionnaires
added written comments and sug
gestions on the form.
Some of the comments, according
to the committee, criticized the
questionnaire and the discussion
program itself.
They ranged from "It's lousy" to
"It's extremely constructive."
Many of them questioned the
phraseology of the questions and
qualified the answers because of
"ambiguities."
The committee reported that
many students answered the ques
tion "Does the Honor Code tend to
develop personal integrity?" with
the qualification that the Code
should develop personal integrity
but that it wasn't necessarily doing
that now.
The question "Do you think that,
all students should take exams
under the same conditions?" met
with a confused response, accord
ing to the committee. Chairman
Bobis said that the word "condi
tions" had not been understood by
many students as meaning "the
physical circumstances of the test
ing room."
Arrangements chairman Hal Han
son said that the committee had
received 91 reports from discussion
leaders who had recorded the ver
bal comments of students at the liv
ing group meetings.
Miss Bobis said that the report
which will be submitted to Excom
at its meeting tomorrow night prob
ably will not include a recommen
dation regarding the taking of ex
ams from the testing room.
She said that the individual re
ports and the results of the ques
tionnaires had shown "too sharp a
split" in student opinion on that
specific question for the committee
to recommend any specific Excom
decision.
