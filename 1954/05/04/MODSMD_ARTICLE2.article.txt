### 
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Ul')â€”The stormy Army-McCarthy hear
ings erupted in a four-way battle today over a proposed Army
drafted press release and Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy's efforts to
subpoena members of the Army loyalty review board.
McCarthy clashed heatedly with Army counsellor John G.
Adams over a press statement Ad-+

ams prepared last October in con
nection with the Wisconsin Repub
lican's investigation of alleged Com
munists at the Fort Monmouth, N.J.,
radar center.
McCarthy and his chief counsel,
Roy M. Cohn, also clashed with
Army Secretary Robert T. Stevens
over McCarthy's long-standing de
mand that members of the Army
Loyalty Review Board be made
available for questioning on why
they cleared some suspended Army
"security risks."
The Army Secretary agreed to
give the subcommittee a memoran
dum tomorrow on who advised him
that the Loyalty Board members
would not have to accept a sub
poena.
As to the disputed photograph,
Stevens denied ever hearing that
Adams threatened to issue a "nasty
report" accusing Cohn of miscon
duct if McCarthy and Cohn contin
ued efforts to subpoena board mem
bers.
Adams, a "principal" in the Army-

McCarthy inquiry, was called to tes
tify about the press release he
drafted after Stevens said he could
not recall sending Adams to Mc-
Carthy with a statement proposing
that the Fort Monmouth inquiry be
halted.
The release would have quoted
McCarthy as saying that "I believe
that from here forward, the Army
can finish the job we have started"
at Fort Monmouth. But it also said
the McCarthy subcommittee would
continue to call witnesses.
