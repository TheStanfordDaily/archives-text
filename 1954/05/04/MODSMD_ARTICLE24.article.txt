## Tenney the Desperate 
### 
In a last-gasp effort to retain his seat in the
California State Senate, Jack B. Tenney has re
sorted to a political maneuver as low as it is
unoriginal.
Obviously panicked by the prospect of Re
publican National Committeewoman Mildred
Younger unseating the bumptious senator from
Los Angeles County, Tenney forces recently
filed- name of Mrs. Hazel Younger, Los An
geles housewife and former mental hospital
inmate, also as a Republican candidate. The
move was clearly aimed at creating voter con
fusion by running two Mrs. Youngers on the
June 8 primary election ballot.
When Mildred Younger, whom Tenney has
called a "hatchet girl of the Warren inner cir
cle," received the endorsement of the Los An
geles County Republican Central Committee,
things began to look dark for the vacillating

Senator Tenney, whose political gyrations are
by now all too familiar to California voters.
He was originally elected to the State Senate
as a Democrat irr 1938, became a Republican in
1942, ran for vice-president on the Gerald H.
K. Smith Christian Nationalist ticket in the last
presidential election, and has now switched
back to the ranks of the GOP. His capers in
contradiction are equally apparent in his record
in Sacramento.
It is hard to consider Mrs. Hazel Younger's
candidacy as anything but a cheap political
trick which shows Tenney's contempt for the
intelligence of the voter.
Voters have come to expect this sort of tactic
from the erratic senator from Los Angeles. We
hope they recognize his latest maneuver as just
cause for ending his 16-year career in Califor
nia politics.
