# What Is It?

### 
"Why student government?"
That question pops up every once in a while.
Voters ask it of candidates lor student offices.
Bull Sessioners loss if around. The Dean's of
fice ponders it.
The answers are sometimes simple.
Those who don't give a damn laugh:
"It's a farce."
Those of the rah-rah, saddle-shoe class howl:
"To drum up school spirit."
And some of those who propose to act as
ieaders of that government drawl:
"Well, I, ah, er . . . haven't thought about
it."
The answers are sometimes complex.
The administration might say:
"The leaders of today will be the leaders of
tomorow and to be the leaders of tomorrow
the leaders of today must have practice leading
so that the world of tomorrow will be better
than the world of today."
And some of the more important student
leaders might say:
"Activity, that's the word. It is imperative

that we do other things than study. We must
have activity. And we can learn how to get
along wilh other people only if we have activ
ity."
Hogwash!
We maintain that student government is not:
1. A farce.
2. An agency for psychological warfare on
student "apathy."
3. A philosophical dilemma.
4. A device for verbal or written gobblede
goop.
5. A St. Vitus dance.
We think the justification for student govern
ment is clear. And w& wish that we could find
more than a few students who believe that:
Student government is the means by which
the students of Stanford can act and speak as a
group. If Stanford students want to do more
than study, they need a channel for their ef
forts. If Stanford students want to do more than
"read, repeat, and memorize," they need a
voice by which they can speak.
We think thev want and need both.
