Bibler —'Serialized Imbecility"

To l.ho Editor:
For some time now. as a regular reader of The
L.tily, I have endured the alleged humor of Dick
Bibler's cartoon series, "Little Man on Campus." I
can no longer restrain myself, however, and feel 1
must protest at last against this serialized imbe
cility.
Mr. Bibler does not have much imagination. He
has two jokes, which strike him as extremely witty
and which he insists on telling us over and over with
nauseous regularity. One, women are sexy. Two,
professors are sadistic. Both points I have been
willing to grant for some time and I'd like Mr. Bibler
to go on to something else. Furthermore, he is ob
sessed with the female bosom. I feel that if he
suddenly lost his sense of humor in this regard he

would be totally unable to draw.
Assuming Mr. Bibler is paid for his efforts, he
should be ashamed of himself. His purpose, obvi
ously, is to train the human mind so it may one
day appreciate Mickey Spillane. Not only is his
cartoon subpar for a high school newspaper but it
frequently hits a level unsuited for the men's room.
Someday, maybe when no one is looking, The Daily
can substitute something funnier for men and women
who, in general, understand that the two sexes are
different.
Just to end on a positive note, thanks for beginning
to run the cartoons by Herblock. In my opinion, for
whatever it's worth, he's the greatest.

To the Editor:
'I he speech class letter reporting on their discis
sion of the value of bringing a student leader from
Yugoslavia to the Stanford campus seemed to us a
reasonable conclusion to the letter exchange on the
subject in The Daily. So we have been disappointed
to see the issue continued, particularly by the letter
of Mary Frances Whitlock, who obviously is not
aware ol the nationality of the student in question.
1 ugoslavia is certainly not considered an ''iron cur
tain'" country today.
An exchange student on returning to his country
reports on his experiences mainly to his family anil
I ni nds, and it is this group on which he exerts the
greatest influence. We feel that a Yugoslav student

would be able to talk at least as freely with his
friends as we were able to talk with complete
strangers during our travels in Yugoslavia last sum
mer. Our experiences and those of students from
Minnesota who spent the .summer studying there
showed that one need have little hesitation in discuss
ing anything from the weather to politics, and that
people were always extremely interested in healing
anything we could tell them about the United States.
In inviting Petar Macanovic to spend a year at
Stanford, surely our scholarship funds will be well
spent in "creating a better understanding of our
American way of life" in the one Communist country
outside ol the "iron curtain."

cility.
Mr. Bibler does not have much imagination. He
has two jokes, which strike him as extremely witty
and which he insists on telling us over and over with
nauseous regularity. One, women are sexy. Two,
professors are sadistic. Both points I have been
willing to grant for some time and I'd like Mr. Bibler
to go on to something else. Furthermore, he is ob
sessed with the female bosom. I feel that if he
suddenly lost his sense of humor in this regard he

would be totally unable to draw.
Assuming Mr. Bibler is paid for his efforts, he
should be ashamed of himself. His purpose, obvi
ously, is to train the human mind so it may one
day appreciate Mickey Spillane. Not only is his
cartoon subpar for a high school newspaper but it
frequently hits a level unsuited for the men's room.
Someday, maybe when no one is looking, The Daily
can substitute something funnier for men and women
who, in general, understand that the two sexes are
different.
Just to end on a positive note, thanks for beginning
to run the cartoons by Herblock. In my opinion, for
whatever it's worth, he's the greatest.

'We Were There'

To the Editor:
'I he speech class letter reporting on their discis
sion of the value of bringing a student leader from
Yugoslavia to the Stanford campus seemed to us a
reasonable conclusion to the letter exchange on the
subject in The Daily. So we have been disappointed
to see the issue continued, particularly by the letter
of Mary Frances Whitlock, who obviously is not
aware ol the nationality of the student in question.
1 ugoslavia is certainly not considered an ''iron cur
tain'" country today.
An exchange student on returning to his country
reports on his experiences mainly to his family anil
I ni nds, and it is this group on which he exerts the
greatest influence. We feel that a Yugoslav student

would be able to talk at least as freely with his
friends as we were able to talk with complete
strangers during our travels in Yugoslavia last sum
mer. Our experiences and those of students from
Minnesota who spent the .summer studying there
showed that one need have little hesitation in discuss
ing anything from the weather to politics, and that
people were always extremely interested in healing
anything we could tell them about the United States.
In inviting Petar Macanovic to spend a year at
Stanford, surely our scholarship funds will be well
spent in "creating a better understanding of our
American way of life" in the one Communist country
outside ol the "iron curtain."
