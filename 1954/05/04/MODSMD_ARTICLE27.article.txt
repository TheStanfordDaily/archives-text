### JACK BYRNE 
HOW TO GET PUBLICITY . . . ALMOST
One of the joys of molding (or moulding, if you
prefer) public opinion is the constant effort of friends,
acquaintances, and complete strangers to get you to
say nice things about them or their particular projects
in your next column.
Like the other day when I was strolling harm
lessly down the Quad. Out from under a rock pops

Mill Cohen, lit l one of the Ritm's
Head jokers.
"Byrne!"
"Sir?" ' •
"The very man I was looking
for! How about dropping in on
a Spring Show rehearsal tomor
row? How ya been? Would
you let me buy you a drink?
And where are you eating to
night? . . . come eat with me."
"Spring Show rehearsal, huh?"
MV.L >..11 ...

'Yeh . , . you re still writing those . . . Bull-Ses
sions, aren't you?"
' Yes, but am I to take this to mean that the ad
vance ticket sales for "Anything Goes" goes not quite
fast enough to suit the Head of the Ram?"
Oh, ticket sales are just fine," quoth he, repock
eting a Luger which had accidentally discharged in
the immediate vicinity of. my left ear. "We just
want to make sure they stay that way."

So I went to the rehearsal. No dinner or drink.
Show rehearsals of any kind are always interest
ing, but student shows are doubly .so for my money,
because people work hard for little recognition and
no money, or at least plenty little.
Was rather impressed by Sylvia Haining, who
really has the kind of .show voice that can be
heard over the orchestra and still has '•■ome lone to it.
Was impressed by the efforts of Bill Scott in turn
ing out a good show orchestra.
Was impressed by the sets, and by the antics of
Dick Winter.
Was convulsed by Warner Leßoy showing the
actors how to handle a part . . . that guy is a
natural comic, an ! is on the wrong side of the
curtain. He's doing . t 'neat job of putting the show
together, but I'd olmoM rather watch him in action
in the show.
And, I was impressed with the chorus line.
I suppose reaction to this column can be expected
to split along two lines. •
One group will loudly scream: "Byrne's been
bought!" 'Tain't so.
The other group will scream: "Who's this guy
think he is? Giving us a review in advance!" 'Tain't
a review.
I m just dropping the word that if you want to
see a good show at prices ! can afTord to pay, "Any
thing Goes is a fine deal. Amble down to the
box office . . . they il be glad to swing a deal.

Show rehearsals of any kind are always interest
ing, but student shows are doubly .so for my money,
because people work hard for little recognition and
no money, or at least plenty little.
Was rather impressed by Sylvia Haining, who
really has the kind of .show voice that can be
heard over the orchestra and still has '•■ome lone to it.
Was impressed by the efforts of Bill Scott in turn
ing out a good show orchestra.
Was impressed by the sets, and by the antics of
Dick Winter.
Was convulsed by Warner Leßoy showing the
actors how to handle a part . . . that guy is a
natural comic, an ! is on the wrong side of the
curtain. He's doing . t 'neat job of putting the show
together, but I'd olmoM rather watch him in action
in the show.
And, I was impressed with the chorus line.
I suppose reaction to this column can be expected
to split along two lines. •
One group will loudly scream: "Byrne's been
bought!" 'Tain't so.
The other group will scream: "Who's this guy
think he is? Giving us a review in advance!" 'Tain't
a review.
I m just dropping the word that if you want to
see a good show at prices ! can afTord to pay, "Any
thing Goes is a fine deal. Amble down to the
box office . . . they il be glad to swing a deal.

HOW TO GET PUBLICITY . . . ALMOST
One of the joys of molding (or moulding, if you
prefer) public opinion is the constant effort of friends,
acquaintances, and complete strangers to get you to
say nice things about them or their particular projects
in your next column.
Like the other day when I was strolling harm
lessly down the Quad. Out from under a rock pops

Mill Cohen, lit l one of the Ritm's
Head jokers.
"Byrne!"
"Sir?" ' •
"The very man I was looking
for! How about dropping in on
a Spring Show rehearsal tomor
row? How ya been? Would
you let me buy you a drink?
And where are you eating to
night? . . . come eat with me."
"Spring Show rehearsal, huh?"
MV.L >..11 ...

'Yeh . , . you re still writing those . . . Bull-Ses
sions, aren't you?"
' Yes, but am I to take this to mean that the ad
vance ticket sales for "Anything Goes" goes not quite
fast enough to suit the Head of the Ram?"
Oh, ticket sales are just fine," quoth he, repock
eting a Luger which had accidentally discharged in
the immediate vicinity of. my left ear. "We just
want to make sure they stay that way."

So I went to the rehearsal. No dinner or drink.
