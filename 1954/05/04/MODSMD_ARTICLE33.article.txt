# Baseballers Play Today
## 
### 
Don DeLong and Mike Acker are
scheduled to pitch for Stanford at.
the Indian baseballers, shaken by
two losses to USC over the week
end, face Sacramento State's Hor
nets in the Sunken Diamond at 3:15
this afternoon.
The Indians hope to tune up for
two crucial games, with Cal and
Santa Clara, coming up next week
end.
Stanford Coach Everett Dean
knows nothing about this year's
Sacramento State teamâ€”"They have
given us good games in the past;"
Dean said. Last year, the Cards
whipped the Hornets 13-4 in the
Sunken Diamond.
As to the disappointing weekend
in Troyland, Dean had few com
ments. "We put ourselves in a bad
position as far as the race is con
cerned but we still have a chance,"
'he said. Stanford went* south hop
ing to ice the PCC pennant but was
twice upended by USC's second
place ball club, 6-3 and 10-1.
"If we win the rest of our league
games we still win the PCC," Dean
pointed out. The Cards and the
Trojans have no more scheduled
league games with each other. Stan
ford must play California three
times, Santa Clara twice, and UCLA
once, but the Santa Clara games will
not affect the PCC standings.
Dean said he hopes to experiment
with a Jew lineup changes in this
afternoon's game.
