# Spring Show, 'Anything Goes,' Takes Shape Behind the Scenes
## 
### 
When the curtain goes up at
Thursday's opening of the Ram's
Head Spring Show, Cole Porter's
musical comedy "Anything Goes,"
the audience will see a show. But
they will see only a part of the
people who made that show. The
other part, the unseen part, is the
technical staff.
From the first dimming of the
house lights to the final curtain call,
"tech" will be at work. The props
you see, the sound effects you hear,
and the sets, makeup, costumes, and
lighting that go to make up the
illusion of theater are the special
contributions of technical crews to
the Spring Show.
Their work starts eariy. Sets, cos
times, and lighting were designed
by the end of winter quarter. By
the end of spring vacation crews
were ready to start construction.
The search for props began. It ran
from San Francisco to San Jose,
from the Mountain View Kennels to

the Alcohol Tax Division of the Bu
reau of Internal Revenue.
"Anything c;oes'' is a big show.
It has a cast of 60 and crews of
over 75. The lighting alone em
ploys over 100 different instru
ments. Tech has used 45 reams of
paper, gallons of paint, and scorcs
of hand props.
The production staff is headed by
director Warner Leßoy. Technical
director is Kirk MacNulty. Other
production staff members include
designer Dick Hay, lighting design
er Bob Culver, costume designer
Reid Lowden, production co-ordi
nator Milton Cohen, music director

Bill Scott, choreographer Judy
Dickinson, and assistant director A 1
Reid.
Crew heads include Renee Reed,
props; Phoebe Schock, set construc
tion; Stan Curry and Curt Pcnder
grass, shift; Bill Potter, lights; Rod
McDaniel, sound; Barbara Spence,
costumes; Joan Bennett, makeup;
and Hal Tracy, fly.

ALL READY—Lighting crew head Bill I'otter (center) and crew members Roger von I'reissig
and Wick Musson control stage lighting from the main light board in the orchestra pit. Direc
tions for lighting changes and movement of the "follow spot" come to them through earphones
from onstage prompters. The board has four sets of each control so that the basic lights of four
scenes may be set in advance. Over 100 different instruments are used in the Ram's Head pro
duction. Special lighting effects, designed by Bob Culver, include sunlight on the ship's deck
and the below-the-waterline dark of the ship's brig.


SHIFT — Technical director VV.
Kirk MacNulty (center) gives
last - minute instructions to shift
crew members Greg iWervin and
Pat Henry. Each set removed from
the stage is assigned a definite
backstage location so it can be
< ox
found easily when needed again.
Shift crew heads arc Stan Curry
and Curt Pendergrass. The Rain's
Head production of "Anything
Goes" features five different stage
settings designed by Dick Hay.


GOOD FIT—Jean Greenlee (jets a
final fitting from crew member
Jan Wisnom. Miss Greenlee pla.\s
one of a string of chorus girls
known as "Reno's Angels." The
costumes were designed by Ileid
Lovvden. Besides outfitting large
numbers of sailors and chorus
girls, the costume crew met such
emergencies as finding a full-dress
English hunting costume, com
< m.
pleie with "pink" coat. Spring
show costume crew head is Bar
bara S pence.


THE FLIES — Crew member Al
Gibson lowers the "flies." This
system of ropes and counter
weights is used to raise and lower
curtains, light banks, and any sets
that are "flown." Each crew mem
ber is assigned to one of the 20
m >
ropes, control of which is his re
sponsibility during the perform
ance. Direction for the fly crew
comes from the desk of stage
manager Milton Cohen. Crew head
is Hal Tracy.


CHECK —Milton Cohen and Mary Lou Seage confer over light
ing cues. Cohen is production co-ordinator and stage manager.
Miss Seage is the member of the light crew in charge of stage
right lighting. She follows the play's action from onstage and
signals the main light board in the orchestra pit when changes
in lighting are needed. Light crew head is Bill Potter.


THE PAINTERS—Cathy Davis, Renee Reed, and Sylvia Marshall
put a final coat of paint on Spring Show props. Miss Reed is
head of the prop crew. Among the unusual items used in the
show this year are 40 camp stools, two pedigreed dogs—a Pom
eranian and a Chihuahua —and a genuine Thompson sub-ma
chine gun, supplied after long search by the Alcohol Tax Di
vision of the Department of Internal Revenue.

show costume crew head is Bar
bara S pence.


THE FLIES — Crew member Al
Gibson lowers the "flies." This
system of ropes and counter
weights is used to raise and lower
curtains, light banks, and any sets
that are "flown." Each crew mem
ber is assigned to one of the 20
m >
ropes, control of which is his re
sponsibility during the perform
ance. Direction for the fly crew
comes from the desk of stage
manager Milton Cohen. Crew head
is Hal Tracy.


CHECK —Milton Cohen and Mary Lou Seage confer over light
ing cues. Cohen is production co-ordinator and stage manager.
Miss Seage is the member of the light crew in charge of stage
right lighting. She follows the play's action from onstage and
signals the main light board in the orchestra pit when changes
in lighting are needed. Light crew head is Bill Potter.


THE PAINTERS—Cathy Davis, Renee Reed, and Sylvia Marshall
put a final coat of paint on Spring Show props. Miss Reed is
head of the prop crew. Among the unusual items used in the
show this year are 40 camp stools, two pedigreed dogs—a Pom
eranian and a Chihuahua —and a genuine Thompson sub-ma
chine gun, supplied after long search by the Alcohol Tax Di
vision of the Department of Internal Revenue.
When the curtain goes up at
Thursday's opening of the Ram's
Head Spring Show, Cole Porter's
musical comedy "Anything Goes,"
the audience will see a show. But
they will see only a part of the
people who made that show. The
other part, the unseen part, is the
technical staff.
From the first dimming of the
house lights to the final curtain call,
"tech" will be at work. The props
you see, the sound effects you hear,
and the sets, makeup, costumes, and
lighting that go to make up the
illusion of theater are the special
contributions of technical crews to
the Spring Show.
Their work starts eariy. Sets, cos
times, and lighting were designed
by the end of winter quarter. By
the end of spring vacation crews
were ready to start construction.
The search for props began. It ran
from San Francisco to San Jose,
from the Mountain View Kennels to

the Alcohol Tax Division of the Bu
reau of Internal Revenue.
"Anything c;oes'' is a big show.
It has a cast of 60 and crews of
over 75. The lighting alone em
ploys over 100 different instru
ments. Tech has used 45 reams of
paper, gallons of paint, and scorcs
of hand props.
The production staff is headed by
director Warner Leßoy. Technical
director is Kirk MacNulty. Other
production staff members include
designer Dick Hay, lighting design
er Bob Culver, costume designer
Reid Lowden, production co-ordi
nator Milton Cohen, music director

Bill Scott, choreographer Judy
Dickinson, and assistant director A 1
Reid.
Crew heads include Renee Reed,
props; Phoebe Schock, set construc
tion; Stan Curry and Curt Pcnder
grass, shift; Bill Potter, lights; Rod
McDaniel, sound; Barbara Spence,
costumes; Joan Bennett, makeup;
and Hal Tracy, fly.

from onstage prompters. The board has four sets of each control so that the basic lights of four
scenes may be set in advance. Over 100 different instruments are used in the Ram's Head pro

and the below-the-waterline dark of the ship's brig.
