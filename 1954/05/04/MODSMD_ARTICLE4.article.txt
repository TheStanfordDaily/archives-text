# 'McCarthy for Fuhrer' Buttons Sell Out Fast
## 
### 
Stanford students apparently
feel it's time for another change.
At least that's what the large
number of "McCarthy for Fuhrer"
(sic) buttons seen around campus
would seem to indicate.
The little red and white buttons
made their first appearance on
campus last week and the original
supply of 1,000 was quickly ex
hausted.
Three thousand more of the
buttons have been ordered and
arc expected to arrive by Wed
nesday. They can he purchased
from Bill Mctcalf or Ben Harris in
102 Stern, Vern Clinton or Wayne
Mall in 212 Stern, Tom Smith in
142 To,von, or Les Smith, Build
ing 111, in the Village. The price
is two for 15 cents or four for 25
cents.
