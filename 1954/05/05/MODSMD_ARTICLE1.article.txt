# McCarthy Produces FBI'S 1951 Warning to Army
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 4 (UP)
Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy threw
the Army-McCarthy hearings
into an uproar today by pro
ducing a secret letter in which
I BI Director J. Edgar Hoover
allegedly warned the Army in
1851 about Fort Monmouth se
curity risks.
v\ hile contents of the letter were
not disclosed, McCarthy said Hoo
ver warned the Army that Aaron
Coleman, one of .'55 civilian em
ployees suspended at Fort Mon
mouth, had a "direct connection

with an espionage agent."
McCarthy sprang his surprise in
the ninth day of the hearings after
efforts to cut down on the number
of witnesses at the televised ses
sions collapsed. Democratic mem
bers of the Senate investigating
subcommittee protested proposals
to "wipe off these serious charges."
As a result, acting subcommittee
chairman Karl E. Mundt (R., S.D)
said it may be necessary to hold
night and Saturday sessions as the
slow-moving hearings plod on "to
the bitter end." Army counsel Jo
seph N. Welch agreed that "we
must plow the long, hard furrow."

McCarthy produced the Hoover
letter during questioning of Army
Secretary Robert T. Stevens, who
had testified early in the proceed
ings that the Army maintained
close relations with the FBI in its
own investigation of Fort Mon
mouth.
McCarthy has accused the Army
of trying to block his investiga
tion of alleged subversion at the
New Jersey radar center. He has
charged that it used Pvt. G. David
Schine, former McCarthy consult
ant, as a "hostage" to try to get
him to call off the inquiry.
Shortly after producing the let

ter, McCarthy shoved it at Stevens
and asked him to read it. Stevens
refused, saying that Hoover haH
sent it to Army Intelligence and
that he did not think he should
read it until he had the FBI chief's
consent.
The letter was addressed to Maj.
Gen. Alexander R. Boiling, then
Assistant Chief of Staff in charge
of Army Intelligence. Boiling is
now a lieutenant general and com
mander of the Third Army, with
headquarters at Fort Mcl'herson,
Ga.
Stevens' statement immediately
brought demands from Army

counsel Welch and Senator Henry
M. Jackson (D., Wash.) as to how
the letter happened to fall into
McCarthy's hands. Subcommittee
chairman Karl E. Mundt (R.. S.D.)
ruled McCarthy d if I not have to
disclose his sources of informa
tion.
McCarthy said only that "I want
to make it clear that I have gotten
neither this letter nor anything
else from the FBI." Stevens had
testified earlier that he was told
McCarthy's counsel, Roy M. Cohn,
once boasted of having access to
FBI files.
Subcommittee counsel Ray H.
Jenkins, who read the letter to

himself to determine if it was
"pertinent" to the investigation,
said it contained information about
Coleman and "perhaps others who
should be investigated."
Jenkins once suggested that
lioover be subpoenaed to testify as
to the authenticity of the letter.
But chairman Mundt said he be
lieved a check with Hoover would
be enough to confirm that the FBI
director had written it and to get
his consent for its public disclo
sure.
McCarthy and Cohn had accused
Stevens' office of giving them a
"stripped" loyalty file on Coleman.
Stevens said he knew nothing

about it but Army Counselor John
G. Adams confirmed that "loyalty
information had been removed
from the file given McCarthy.
Adams read a letter he sent Mc-
Carthy last Oct. 15 informing him
that the information had been de
leted in accordance with a Presi
dential directive forbidding dis
closure of loyalty data. But the
letter also said that since McCar
thy's investigators already had
seen the information it was being
forwarded anyway.
McCarthy insisted that Stevens
read the Hoover letter to see if he
had a duplicate in his files—"one
of a seqeunce from the FBI" warn

ing about the "dangerous situa
tion" at Fort Monmouth. McCar
thy said the Army disregarded the
Hoover letter until he launched his
Fort Monmouth inquiry.
Mundt subsequently ordered
Stevens to search his files and re
port back tomorrow whether he
has a copy of the Hoover letter.
Stevens testified he never had seen
the document before.
Stevens testified that Adams had
talked to some Senators about Mc-
Carthy's threat to issue subpoenas
for the board members. Stevens
said that a Presidential directive;
prohibited the Army from giving

Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy threw
the Army-McCarthy hearings
into an uproar today by pro
ducing a secret letter in which
I BI Director J. Edgar Hoover
allegedly warned the Army in
1851 about Fort Monmouth se
curity risks.
v\ hile contents of the letter were
not disclosed, McCarthy said Hoo
ver warned the Army that Aaron
Coleman, one of .'55 civilian em
ployees suspended at Fort Mon
mouth, had a "direct connection

with an espionage agent."
McCarthy sprang his surprise in
the ninth day of the hearings after
efforts to cut down on the number
of witnesses at the televised ses
sions collapsed. Democratic mem
bers of the Senate investigating
subcommittee protested proposals
to "wipe off these serious charges."
As a result, acting subcommittee
chairman Karl E. Mundt (R., S.D)
said it may be necessary to hold
night and Saturday sessions as the
slow-moving hearings plod on "to
the bitter end." Army counsel Jo
seph N. Welch agreed that "we
must plow the long, hard furrow."

McCarthy produced the Hoover
letter during questioning of Army
Secretary Robert T. Stevens, who
had testified early in the proceed
ings that the Army maintained
close relations with the FBI in its
own investigation of Fort Mon
mouth.
McCarthy has accused the Army
of trying to block his investiga
tion of alleged subversion at the
New Jersey radar center. He has
charged that it used Pvt. G. David
Schine, former McCarthy consult
ant, as a "hostage" to try to get
him to call off the inquiry.
Shortly after producing the let

ter, McCarthy shoved it at Stevens
and asked him to read it. Stevens
refused, saying that Hoover haH
sent it to Army Intelligence and
that he did not think he should
read it until he had the FBI chief's
consent.
The letter was addressed to Maj.
Gen. Alexander R. Boiling, then
Assistant Chief of Staff in charge
of Army Intelligence. Boiling is
now a lieutenant general and com
mander of the Third Army, with
headquarters at Fort Mcl'herson,
Ga.
Stevens' statement immediately
brought demands from Army

counsel Welch and Senator Henry
M. Jackson (D., Wash.) as to how
the letter happened to fall into
McCarthy's hands. Subcommittee
chairman Karl E. Mundt (R.. S.D.)
ruled McCarthy d if I not have to
disclose his sources of informa
tion.
McCarthy said only that "I want
to make it clear that I have gotten
neither this letter nor anything
else from the FBI." Stevens had
testified earlier that he was told
McCarthy's counsel, Roy M. Cohn,
once boasted of having access to
FBI files.
Subcommittee counsel Ray H.
Jenkins, who read the letter to

himself to determine if it was
"pertinent" to the investigation,
said it contained information about
Coleman and "perhaps others who
should be investigated."
Jenkins once suggested that
lioover be subpoenaed to testify as
to the authenticity of the letter.
But chairman Mundt said he be
lieved a check with Hoover would
be enough to confirm that the FBI
director had written it and to get
his consent for its public disclo
sure.
McCarthy and Cohn had accused
Stevens' office of giving them a
"stripped" loyalty file on Coleman.
Stevens said he knew nothing

about it but Army Counselor John
G. Adams confirmed that "loyalty
information had been removed
from the file given McCarthy.
Adams read a letter he sent Mc-
Carthy last Oct. 15 informing him
that the information had been de
leted in accordance with a Presi
dential directive forbidding dis
closure of loyalty data. But the
letter also said that since McCar
thy's investigators already had
seen the information it was being
forwarded anyway.
McCarthy insisted that Stevens
read the Hoover letter to see if he
had a duplicate in his files—"one
of a seqeunce from the FBI" warn

ing about the "dangerous situa
tion" at Fort Monmouth. McCar
thy said the Army disregarded the
Hoover letter until he launched his
Fort Monmouth inquiry.
Mundt subsequently ordered
Stevens to search his files and re
port back tomorrow whether he
has a copy of the Hoover letter.
Stevens testified he never had seen
the document before.
Stevens testified that Adams had
talked to some Senators about Mc-
Carthy's threat to issue subpoenas
for the board members. Stevens
said that a Presidential directive;
prohibited the Army from giving
the subcommittee the information,
