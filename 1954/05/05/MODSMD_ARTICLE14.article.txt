# 1954-55 Budget Estimates To Go to Excom Tonight
## 
### 
A recommended budget of $32,875 for the 1954-55 fiscal year will be sub
mitted to the Executive Committee tonight by Student Manager John
Stahr. This represents an increase of $5,308 over this year's ASSU budget
total of $27,567.
Stahr has based his recommendations on special budget hearings which
were held with each ASSU board at the end of April. No appropriations
have been listed for items of an uncertain nature, he said.
However, any project for which no funds have been budgeted may be
brought before next year's Excom for possible appropriations. The ASSU
"contingency fund" is available to Excom for financing special or unex
pected programs.
Stahr said the larger budget is based on three factors: larger antici
pated enrollment, greater income from the Sunday Evening movies due to
the removal of the 20 per cent excise tax, and greater anticipated income
from other sources, such as the sale of rooters' caps.
The contingency fund of $2,105.00 is substantially the same as that
budgeted for the current fiscal year.

Stahr has based his recommendations on special budget hearings which
were held with each ASSU board at the end of April. No appropriations
have been listed for items of an uncertain nature, he said.
However, any project for which no funds have been budgeted may be
brought before next year's Excom for possible appropriations. The ASSU
"contingency fund" is available to Excom for financing special or unex
pected programs.
Stahr said the larger budget is based on three factors: larger antici
pated enrollment, greater income from the Sunday Evening movies due to
the removal of the 20 per cent excise tax, and greater anticipated income
from other sources, such as the sale of rooters' caps.
The contingency fund of $2,105.00 is substantially the same as that
budgeted for the current fiscal year.
