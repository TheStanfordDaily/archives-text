# P.A. Clinic Head Is Confident Board Will Okay VA Hospital
## 
### 
Dr. Russrl Lee, head of the I'alo
Alto Clinic, told The Daily yester
day that "I feel quite sure the Board
of Trustees will grant permission to
the Veterans' Administration .to
build the hospital."
Lee referred to the VA's proposed
$21} million nouro-psychiatric hos
pital which may bo located on Stan
ford land at. Page Mill Poarl and
Junipero Serra Boulevard. The IJni
versity has not yet received an offi
cial proposal from the VA. If the
proposal is received in time, the
matter will be considered at the
May 20 Board of Trustees meeting.
Lee offered two arguments which
he considers vital to the issue: First,
location of the hospital on Stanford
land would give the Stanford Mcd
ical School valuable teaching facili
ties. Secqnd, the hospital would be
financially extremely beneficial to
the University.
Congressman Charles tlubser
also issued a statement defending
the location of the hospital: "I
have done everything possible to
promote selection of the Stanford
site in the belief that the hospital
would be a valuable addition to
our county Loth economically and
medically.

"I have also been assured* (hat. the
hospital will br attractive in design
and will not interfere with the daily
lives of nearby resit lon to. if Palo
Alto citizens do not wish to accept
the hospital, I think it regrettable,"
said Gtibser.
In the opposition '-amp, a resident
of Roble Ridge made public his let
tor to the Board of Trusters yrster
day, in which hr gave his opinion
that, thr proposed location is a "fab
ulous mistake."
