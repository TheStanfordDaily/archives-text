# Opportunity Knocking
## 
### 
These are the days of opportunity.
Spring quarter, 1954, is half over, and those
of us who will be back on Quad next fall are, or
should be, contemplating next year's range of
activities. What's more, we are, or should be,
analyzing our abilities and interests and fitting
them to the opportunities in student govern
ment and extracurricular activities. And just
what are these opportunities?
Glancing through The Daily, we notice the
quantity of tryouts and interviews being held
now for next year's responsible student lead
ers. For instance, these positions must be filled
before June: National Student Association co
ordinator, AWS §ummer officers, AWS treas
urer, AWS committee chairmen, Fundamental
Standard Committee and Cardinals openings,
Concert Series assistant managers, and posi
tions on Drives Committee.
We think participation in activities such as

these is valuable experience for both student
and school for two reasons: First, the student
gives himself a fair chance to develop poten
tially valuable talents and abilities. Second,
he offers the University the hard, fun work and
sympathetic leadership which is always in high
demand and short supply, whether on campus
or in the business world.
What can you do about it right now? Begin
by searching out the little stories on pages 1,
2, and 4 that are announcing tryouts and inter
views. Then, note the vital statistics—where
to go, when to appear—and list for easy ref
erence all your experiences or qualifications
that might influence the all powerful "ones.
Third and final step, saunter casually to the
appointed place at the appointed iime and TRY.
If you and your first choice activity turn out to
be incompatible, take hope and try another.
Remember -these are the days of opportunity.
