## Macanovie and the Facts 
### 
To the Editor:
The recent criticisms of the award of an ASSU
Foreign (Scholar;. hip to Petar Macanovic have bet*n
made on the grounds that he will be 1 unable to com
municate hi ; impressions- of the United States ob
jectively on his teturn to Yugoslavia, and will there
for" not fulfill one of the purposes of the Scholarship
Program, N
The ASSU Foreign Scholarship Committee screened
ovt-i 17. r > applications from students all over the
world with the. purpose of selecting individuals who
showed promise of becoming significant leaders in
their respective countries. The twenty-five best were
in turn read by fraternity and dormitory representa
tives who were responsible for making the final selec
tions All those recommended for the final selection
were well qualified in the eyes of the Committe. Ma
canovic was among them, and he was chosen to come
to Stanford by t'iree fraternities, Phi Kappa Sigma,
Phi Sigma Kappa, and Alpha Sigma Phi.
The positions taken by the critics of this choice re
veal an ignorance of the facts as well as a rather
hort-sighted and narrow view ot our responsibilities
as leaders of the free world. First of all, there is a
far greater degree of freedom of speech in Yugo
lavia than is generally believed. Thirty thousand
Am. â–  H an who visited Yugoslavia last year alone will
tr: !ify to this fact. Macanovic will not only be free
but encourared to tell of his American experience.
Second the critics are apparently unaware of the
fact that ovci two thousand Yugoslav students, under
the auspice; of the United States government anil the
government of Yugoslavia* and the United Nations
have come to America during the past four years to
ludy medicine, engineering and even military strate
gy and tactics to return to their homeland to apply
their knowledge. Third, the critics are apparently

unaware of the existence of highly successful United
States Information Services in Yugoslavia which run
libraries and spread information about this country.
Their existence, much less their apparent success, is
testimony to the fact that both the State Department
and the government and people of Yugoslavia are
desirous of learning about America. Finally, the
mention of Yugoslavia as an Iron Curtain country
is a statement that reveals the type of misunder
standing that we are attempting to dispel in bring
ing students from abroad to our campus. Yugoslavia
broke with the Russian dominated Iron Curtain bloc
and is now not only recognized by our government,
but receives, as an ally, millions of dollars in military
and economic aid.
These facts indicate that the degree of cooperation
between Yugoslavia and this country is very great,
and that there is the mutual desire to maintain per
manently friendly illations. Macanovic and all the
other ASSU Foreign Scholars will, we hope, profit
from their year at Stanford, and will return to their
respective countries to tell of their American experi
ence. We must have confidence that all the Scholars,
in attaining positions of responsibility in their com
munities, will be influenced in their actions, decisions,
and speech, by a better knowledge of this country.
It is not our desire to Americanize the students, but
instead to create a sympathetic understanding of our
ideals and of our way of life. To turn our backs on
any country, particularly one that has broken away
from our enemy, would hardly be in the interests of
world peace and understanding. We congratulate the
three fraternities on what seems to us to be an intel
ligent and very farseeing decision.
