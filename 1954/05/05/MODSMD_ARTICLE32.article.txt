### PETE GROTHE 
Leo Long, the soft-spoken ed major from the nondescript countryside i
of Modesto, is going to win the nationals in the javelin.
The blond 6-1 192 pounder let go of the spear in the UCLA meet last!
Saturday. It quivered in the turf i

226 It. ll'-j inches from the throwing !
line for (1) y new meet record (2) the j
best distance in the nation this year,
and (3) Long's all-time best mark.
The local fishwrappers didn't even
record the most amazing part of the
throw: that Leo let loose the dart
about three feet behind the throwing j
line, and that in actuality, it was a i
230 foot throw.
Long, who resembles Hob Ma
thias in his modesty and genuine
ness. said after the meet, "For the
first time, I really felt iliat I had
it. Bud Held (who holds (lie
world's javelin record and is a j
former Stanford star) gave me j
some advice last week. He told
me that i should drive in low. |

and that when I let go of the javelin that I should feel like I was glued
to the ground and had suddenly popped loose. I had that feeling today." j
Long, who is married and has a baby son, is considered by the insiders j
as a shoo-in in the NCAA. Also, he'll probably be able to fulfill a life-long j
ambition by getting a free junket to Europe t'ni.s summer with the AAU
track team.

When that carnival of overexertion known as the NCAA track meet
comes to a close on June 17, it could well bo that Stanford again will be
among the top teams. This, despite the Indians' mediocre dual meet sea
son.
Why? Well, Stanford's Bob Kimball, who placed third in the NCAA
javelin last year, could wind up second behind Long.
The beautiful form hurdler, Gerry Wood, could conceivably win the ;
highs, and low hurdler Jim Luttrell should place in the lows. Add to this
possible points by John Stewart in the high jump and Al Cheney in the
shot put.

Watch for hig things from Mickey Ilolzman, who has just been in- j
stalled as Everett Dean's first string third baseman, lie's muscling the bat
at a . clip and got four for seven against I SC' last week end.

Trainer Connie Jarvis made a shocking discovery the other day; he ;
lound out, as far as he could determine, that footballer-trackman Jim i
Saras doesn't take a single breath while he's running the 100 or 220.

Eighty-five gridballers wheezed and panted through opening spring drills 1
the other day. Here's our prediction for the starling lineup next fall:
Ends: John Stewart and Ron Bush;
Tackles: Win Wedge and Chris Marshai! or Joel Sappenlicld;
Guards: Malt Annitage and Roy Krickelierg;
Center: Jerry Goldberg;
Quarterback: Jack Geberl; 0
Halfbacks: Ernie Dorn and Rill Tarr; *
Fullback: Jarvis Watson.

Bob Burnett, the resigned hoop me
decided to go into the life insurance h
several offers.
