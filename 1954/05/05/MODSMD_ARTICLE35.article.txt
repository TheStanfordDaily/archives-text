# Baseballers Nose Out Sacramento State, 9 to 7
## 
### DICK MANSFIELD 
Outhit 11 to 7, Stanford's baseballing Indians used eight unearned runs to beat the Sacramento
State Hornets, 9 to 7, yesterday afternoon in the Sunken Diamond.
Contributing mightily to the Cardinal cause were Rich Scramaglia and Warren Goodrich, who
put together five hits between them and scored what proved to be the winning runs on a nifty
piece of base running. Sacramento State's five errors also helped the cause.
Southpaw Don DeLong, wko went six innings and gave up three Sacramento runs on six hits,

! got credit for the win. i
Stanford iced it with a five-run
f""~s|ilurge in the sixth, with Scrag
and Goodrich scoring the clinch
ers on a hunt. With three runs in,
Goodrich on second and Scrama
' glia on third, AI Talhoy hunted
[ between the mound and third
hase.
Sacramento pitcher George Lar- I
sen, seeing no play on Scrag at the
' plate, fielded the ball to first to nail !
} Talboy. Goodrich, coming down
j from second, never stopped and
J raced home with Stanford's ninth
j counter behind Larsen's back.
The Indians jumped off to a quick
I two-run lead in the first, courtesy j
of starting Hornet pitcher J. C.
j Masters. The tall right - hander
walked leadotf man George Selleck
and Scramaglia, then threw Good
rich's infield hit away at first, let
ting in both runs.
The Hornets jumped back to tie
it in the second on two infield sin
gles, a walk, a fielder's choice, and
a sacrifice fly.
Stanford came right back in the
third when Scramaglia drilled a line
double to the base of the left-field
bank, 360 feet from the plate, and

counted on Goodrich's ground sin
gle to center. That was the Cards'
only earned run. Goodrich moved to
second on a fielder's choice, took
third on another, and scored on a I

hooted throw.
Came the slrxth with Stanford
leading 4 to !l. The subsequent
Indian outburst looked very much
like a Sacramento blow-up. Len
! Swart/, walked. Dixie Workman !
j got to second on an error, and !
George Selleck reached lirst on
another miscue to load the bases.
Scraniaglia hit a sinking liner into
left which the left - fielder failed
to handle and Swart/, counted.
! Scrag's effort went as a hit.
Then Goodrich beat out a hopper
j to short and Workman scored. Tom j
| Dandurand picked up a run batted j
I in by watching a fourth ball, and ;
that was all for pitcher Masters. j

State Hornets, 9 to 7, yesterday afternoon in the Sunken Diamond.
Contributing mightily to the Cardinal cause were Rich Scramaglia and Warren Goodrich, who
put together five hits between them and scored what proved to be the winning runs on a nifty
piece of base running. Sacramento State's five errors also helped the cause.

The Indians jumped off to a quick
I two-run lead in the first, courtesy j
