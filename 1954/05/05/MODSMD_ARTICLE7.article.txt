"Our culture is out of balance,"
Dr. Henry A. Myers emphasized at
the Tuesday Evening Series last
night in Memorial Auditorium.
Respect for science is one of its
glories, but disrespect for literature
is one of its weaknesses, he said.
"However, I am trying to restore
the balance between them rather
than glorify literature at the ex
pense of science."
According to Myers, man has con
ceived two distinct views of the uni
verse. "The first view is personal
and insighted"—it places man at the
center of the universe, which begins
and ends with him. "The second
view is impersonal and external"—
man discovers he is no longer the
measure of anything.
"Insirfht is the indispcn.sible qual
ity, the essence of literature," Myers
continued. A great writer offers uni

versality rather than just individ
uality. "Shakespeare's plays tell us
.very little about Shakespeare, but
much about the world."
Life itself is too long to grasp, but
"great science and great poetry are
short and to the point," he com
.mented. "Tragic poetry is a short
hand account of fortune and mis
fortune. Mathematics is a kind of
scientific poetry, reaching for the
infinite and showing the matchless
order of the universe."
"The poet and the scientist are not
rivals," he concluded, "but partners
in the task of making man sec others
as he sees himself and see himself
as others see him."
