# Honor Code Report, Budget Top Excom Agenda Tonight
## 
### WIN GRIFFITH Editor. The Daily 
The Executive Committee, will
meet tonight at 7:30 in the Ex
com room for what promises to
be one of the most important —
and possibly longest—meetings
of the year.
Tonight's agenda includes Iwn
items of major importance: the final
report of the special ASSU Honor
Code Committee and the proposed
ASSU budget for 1954-55.
Jeannie chairman of the
special committee which has pre
pared the Honor Code report, an
nounced last night that the commit

tee would recommend a "radical
change in the section of the ASSU
constitution relating* to the Honor
Code."
She declined to comment before
hand on what the specific constitu
tional revision would be, but she
did say that it_ would include
' changes in the present wording and
additional paragraphs of clarifica
tion."
Student Manager John Stahr will
present and explain the 1954-55
ASSU budget. Chairman Don Lo
zabnick and Stahr have said that
they expect the $32,875 budget to be
approved after brief discussion by
Excom members.
The 1954-55 budget represents an
increase of $5,308 over the present
ASSU budget. Excom members and

the beads of ASSU boards and com
mittees have been working with
Stahr on the budget details for the
past several weeks.
The Honor Uode report which will
bo submitted to Excom tonight will
be the result of the recent discus
sion program involving over 100 in
dividual meetings in campus living
groups.
At those meetings, students heard
a report on a history of the Honor
Code and the committee's individual
interpretation of the Code and com
pleted questionnaires designed to
draw together a "collective opinion
on the Code."
The final report, according to Miss
Bobis, has been based on the discus
sions themselves and the results of
the questionnaires.

According to the committee, it will
involve five major areas for Excom
consideration:
1. Statistics on the question
naire. (The results of the 2,381
questionnaires were printed in
yesterday's Daily.)
2. Education. (Methods of edu
cating both students and faculty
on the Honor Code, with special
stress on student-faculty relations
involving the Code.)
Investigation and elimination
of "problem areas." (Which will
include recommendations for
study of several "areas" in which
the Honor Code has been met with
problems of successful operation.)
4. Constitutional revision and
additions.
5. Issue of taking exams from
the testing room.
Miss Bobis said yesterday that tho
report would not include a specific
recommendation on the issue of
exams being taken from the class
room because of the "sharp split"
the committee found in the student,
opinion on that question.
Several possible policies will,
however, be advanced for Excom:,
consideration.
The committee chairman told Tho
Daily that she will recommend that
Excom table any action on the re
port and its recommendations for
at least one week. She said that it
will be long enough and complicated
enough to merit at least one weeks
conisderation of Excom members.
And ASSU President Don Lozab -
nick said last night, that he hope .
students will inform their Excom
representatives of their opinion .
after reading of the details of the
report in The Daily.
If the Executive Committee ap ■
proves the recommendation to re
vise the constitutional provision ori
the Honor Code, the Academic
Council of the University will have
to review the decision and grant it .
approval before the change is offi
cial.
Members of the special Honor
Code Committee have already met
with some representatives of the
administration to discuss the pos
sible constitutional change.
