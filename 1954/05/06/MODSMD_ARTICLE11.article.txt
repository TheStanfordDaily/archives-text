# Excom Gets Code Report, Tables Action One Week
## BOBIS PRESENTS STUDY Special Committee Urges Amendment 
### WALT WILLIAMS Associate Editor, The Daily 
The Executive Committee last night moved to table adoption
of the final report of the special ASSU Honor Code Committee
until next week's meeting.
The thirteen-page report recommended an addition to the by
laws of the ASSU Constitution, two minor changes in the wording

of the Constitution, and a scries of
recommendations on the Code.
Specifically, it called for the ad
dition of one paragraph to Section 2
of the ASSU by-laws. The addition
reads: "The students and the fac
ulty will work together to establish
those conditions under which opti
mum academic performance can be
achieved."
Jeannie Bobis, ASSU vice-presi
dent and chairman of the special
Code committee, said the adoition
was recommended for the follow
ing reasons:
1. As it now .stands, there is no
method of altering the Honor Code.
2. When given situations arise, the
addition recommended would serve
as a moans to adapt the Honor Code
to particular situations without
completely changing the wording of
the Code or making a limiting list
of provisions.
3. The addition would provide for
a "flexible Honor Code."
The move to postpone definite ac
tion on the report was passed after
Excom members expressed a desire
for students to familiarize them
selves with its recommendations and
express their opinions to their Ex
com representative.
The report did not offer any posi
tive recommendations in regard to
whether or not. students should be
allowed to take examinations out
side the class room.
Miss Bobis said that the results of
the Honor Code questionnaire re
cently circulated among 2,384 stu
dents indicates a definite split with
in the student body on this ques
tion.
The problem, she said, should
therefore be evaluated from the
long-range point of view, taking into
consideration the recommendations
that have already been made.
The committee feels, she added,
that the improvement of room con
ditions during examination periods
would somewhat alleviate the prob
lem, and that the development, and
furtherance of faculty trust, through
better understanding brought about
by future orientation and co-opera
tion should be encouraged.
She also pointed out that the gen
eral phrase recommended as a by
law addition would set up a broad
framework in the constitution, by
means of which specific problems
that arise could be solved.

mittee's report and recommenda
tions will be printed in tomorrow's
Daily.)

laws of the ASSU Constitution, two minor changes in the wording

of the Constitution, and a scries of
recommendations on the Code.
Specifically, it called for the ad
dition of one paragraph to Section 2
of the ASSU by-laws. The addition
reads: "The students and the fac
ulty will work together to establish
those conditions under which opti
mum academic performance can be
achieved."
Jeannie Bobis, ASSU vice-presi
dent and chairman of the special
Code committee, said the adoition
was recommended for the follow
ing reasons:
1. As it now .stands, there is no
method of altering the Honor Code.
2. When given situations arise, the
addition recommended would serve
as a moans to adapt the Honor Code
to particular situations without
completely changing the wording of
the Code or making a limiting list
of provisions.
3. The addition would provide for
a "flexible Honor Code."
The move to postpone definite ac
tion on the report was passed after
Excom members expressed a desire
for students to familiarize them
selves with its recommendations and
express their opinions to their Ex
com representative.
The report did not offer any posi
tive recommendations in regard to
whether or not. students should be
allowed to take examinations out
side the class room.
Miss Bobis said that the results of
the Honor Code questionnaire re
cently circulated among 2,384 stu
dents indicates a definite split with
in the student body on this ques
tion.
The problem, she said, should
therefore be evaluated from the
long-range point of view, taking into
consideration the recommendations
that have already been made.
The committee feels, she added,
that the improvement of room con
ditions during examination periods
would somewhat alleviate the prob
lem, and that the development, and
furtherance of faculty trust, through
better understanding brought about
by future orientation and co-opera
tion should be encouraged.
She also pointed out that the gen
eral phrase recommended as a by
law addition would set up a broad
framework in the constitution, by
means of which specific problems
that arise could be solved.
(Additional details of the com
mittee's report and recommenda
tions will be printed in tomorrow's
Daily.)
