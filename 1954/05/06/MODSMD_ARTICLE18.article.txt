## Graves Discusses School Problems, Political Issues 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Richard Graves, candidate for the Democratic, nomination for
Governor, in his speech last night before the Political Union in
Cubberley Auditorium delved into the problems of overcrowded
California school facilities and of Communism in education. He
then turned to touch on a few fiery political issues.

When asked, near the conclusion
of the meeting, for his opinion on
the Fair Employment Practice Com
mission, the 47-year-old gubernato
rial aspirant declared he was "in
favor of FEPC with enforcement
powers that would eliminate dis
crimination in employment." "But,"
he went on, "this is only a small
part of what is to be done."
In contrast to Governor Knight,
who last month declared to the Po
litical Union that "morality cannot
be enforced by law," Graves insist
ed, "Law and leadership should be
used to eliminate every bit of dis
crimination."
Earlier in the meeting, Graves
cited the problem that is '"over
whelming the state"—the problem
of the overcrowded school, fie fore
sees the state falling farther and
farther behind in education ts time
goes on because of the mushroom
ing of population and the unequal
distribution of the tax burden.
It will take $1,325,000,000 to build
the required number of schools by
1959, Graves stated. "Yet," he re
marked, "bond issues arc defeated
by even those who know they are
required."
From this he concluded, "There
will be no answer until the state is
willing to face up to the problem
and have at\ orderly plan for settle
ment." The Legislature, he brlievrs,
is sacrificing principles to political
expediency by cutting corners in
University budgets.
Viewing the problem in state uni
versities, Graves said that enroll
ment would double by l!)fis.
Hitting upon the loyalty oath con
troversy, he argued that he opposed
and .still opposes it mainly because
"it hits at the very essence of a
university."
"It won't be long," he opined, "if
this continues before everyone will
have to take an oath and that will
be when we have achieved absolute
absurdity."
• "Freedom," he remarked, "is a
funny thing; it's like a virtue. You
can't have just a little bit of it. It
approaches being an absolute."

have to take an oath and that will

absurdity."

Richard Graves, candidate for the Democratic, nomination for
Governor, in his speech last night before the Political Union in
Cubberley Auditorium delved into the problems of overcrowded
California school facilities and of Communism in education. He
then turned to touch on a few fiery political issues.

When asked, near the conclusion
of the meeting, for his opinion on
the Fair Employment Practice Com
mission, the 47-year-old gubernato
rial aspirant declared he was "in
favor of FEPC with enforcement
powers that would eliminate dis
crimination in employment." "But,"
he went on, "this is only a small
part of what is to be done."
In contrast to Governor Knight,
who last month declared to the Po
litical Union that "morality cannot
be enforced by law," Graves insist
ed, "Law and leadership should be
used to eliminate every bit of dis
crimination."
Earlier in the meeting, Graves
cited the problem that is '"over
whelming the state"—the problem
of the overcrowded school, fie fore
sees the state falling farther and
farther behind in education ts time
goes on because of the mushroom
ing of population and the unequal
distribution of the tax burden.
It will take $1,325,000,000 to build
the required number of schools by
1959, Graves stated. "Yet," he re
marked, "bond issues arc defeated
by even those who know they are
required."
From this he concluded, "There
will be no answer until the state is
willing to face up to the problem
and have at\ orderly plan for settle
ment." The Legislature, he brlievrs,
is sacrificing principles to political
expediency by cutting corners in
University budgets.
Viewing the problem in state uni
versities, Graves said that enroll
ment would double by l!)fis.
Hitting upon the loyalty oath con
troversy, he argued that he opposed
and .still opposes it mainly because
"it hits at the very essence of a
university."
"It won't be long," he opined, "if
this continues before everyone will
have to take an oath and that will
be when we have achieved absolute
absurdity."
• "Freedom," he remarked, "is a
funny thing; it's like a virtue. You
can't have just a little bit of it. It
approaches being an absolute."
