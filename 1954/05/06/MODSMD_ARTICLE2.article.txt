# McCarthy On Stand in Row

### 
WASHINGTON, May 5 (UP) â€”
Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy testified
today that an Army Intelligence of
ficer had given him a partial copy
of a secret FBI report on Army se
curity risks, but he flatly refused to
disclose the officer's identity.
At the same time, Army Secretary
Robert T. Stevens testified the Army
asked the FBI on April 10, 1953, to
make a full investigation of the Fort
Monmouth, N.J., radar center. Mc-
Carthy has contended the Army did
nothing about Fort Monmouth until
he started an inquiry last summer.
McCarthy, testifying under oath
for the first time at the Army-Mc-
Carthy hearings, said the Intelli
gence officer gave him the "confi
dential" FBI document because he
was "disturbed" by the FBI reports
of Communist espionage at Fort
Monmouth.
McCarthy was called us a surprise
witness after Welch had questioned
whether a document which McCar
thy dramatically produced yester
day as a copy of a letter from FBI
Director J. Edgar Hoover was a
"phony."
