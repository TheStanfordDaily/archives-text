# Progress on Hazards
## 
### 
The student report on campus hazards has
traveled a long way since it was completed a
month ago.
The Axe Society originated the report —a de
tailed study of several campus danger spots
and specific recommendations for eliminating
the hazards.
Excom heard the report, approved it, and
sent it on to the President's office.
President Sterling read the report and was
very impressed by the intelligent suggestions
for improvement. He passed it on to University
Business Manager A If Brandin for further
study.
Brandin's office is now looking into the pos
sibility of turning the specific recommenda

tions into concrete facts. His report on the stu
dent report is not yet ready.
When the business office completes its
study, a special report including recommended
expenditines will be sent back to the Presi
dent's office. If money not included in the
present University budget is needed for the
project, the report will be sent to San Francisco
for approval by the Board of Trustees.
Student interest in eliminating campus haz
ards has produced this report, a report which
has met with general commendation and ap
proval by the administration.
We hope the report will soon be acted upon.
Bushes still line the Toyon parking lot and
cars still race three abreast down Palm Drive.
They're still hazards.
