# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'Don't Let Fear Hold Us Back’ 
### 
To the Editor:
Stanford ha: been making long range plans for the
future. Included in these plans are various enter
prises which will be profitable to the University. Re
c< ntly the Veteran's Administration picked Stanford
for the .site ol a psychiatric hospital. This proposal
will be of use to Stanford in financial and other ways.
There were two arguments raised by residents con
cerning the building of this mental hospital. The first
was that it would lowei the value of the land. Yet
looking at the present Palo Alto Veteran's Hospital
w»* find that the residential areas surrounding it were
built after the hospital. Certainly these people would
not have done so if they had felt it disadvantageous.
The second argument concerns the education of
children to living near a mental institution. What edu
cation doe: a child need to live next to a mental hos
pital? Is if. any different, from living next to any other
kind of hospital?
The only instruction the child needs is that mental
illness i just like any physical disease. Instead of
having TB or cancer, these people have illnesses of
the mind. I think that all children should be taught
about these people and their habits. This is a lesson
which perhaps we all need.
I feel that many do not want it because they are
afraid of something they know nothing about. It is a
typical human reaction to fall back from that which is

unknown. This ignorance is shown in phrases like
"booby hatch" and "noodle factory."
The many misconceptions about mental illness blind
us from seeing the true picture. With a fuller under
standing of the -ituation, we would feel differently.
If we can see those people not as "nuts." but as dis
eased and ill people needing help, and understand that
they arc human, maybe more of us would be in favor
of the hospital.
Psychiatry is medicine': newest and most rapidly
advancing field Much has been learned, but much
more is still undiscovered. Stanford has an opportu
nity to become a world leader in this area.
With this new hospital, in addition to the medical
school on campir , the Palo Alto Veteran's Hospital,
and our psychology department, Stanfoid could lead
the way in training men and doing research in psy
chiatry and psychology.
The combination would give greater clinical op
portunity to medical students, open up new avenues
foi research, and would add to the prestige and repu
tation of the Stanford Medical School. With these
new facilities Stanford could ehallt nge the supremacy
of the great eastern medical schools.
Stanford has a wonderful opportunity in allowing
the Veteran's Administration to build this hospital.
Let's not let out ignoranci hold us back.

about these people and their habits. This is a lesson

To the Editor:
Stanford ha: been making long range plans for the
future. Included in these plans are various enter
prises which will be profitable to the University. Re
c< ntly the Veteran's Administration picked Stanford
for the .site ol a psychiatric hospital. This proposal
will be of use to Stanford in financial and other ways.
There were two arguments raised by residents con
cerning the building of this mental hospital. The first
was that it would lowei the value of the land. Yet
looking at the present Palo Alto Veteran's Hospital
w»* find that the residential areas surrounding it were
built after the hospital. Certainly these people would
not have done so if they had felt it disadvantageous.
The second argument concerns the education of
children to living near a mental institution. What edu
cation doe: a child need to live next to a mental hos
pital? Is if. any different, from living next to any other
kind of hospital?
The only instruction the child needs is that mental
illness i just like any physical disease. Instead of
having TB or cancer, these people have illnesses of
the mind. I think that all children should be taught
about these people and their habits. This is a lesson
which perhaps we all need.
I feel that many do not want it because they are
afraid of something they know nothing about. It is a
typical human reaction to fall back from that which is
