# The 						'Heroicâ€™ Senator

### 
To the Editor:
*
Why do you publish such vituperative cartoons as
that showing one oi the most heroic members of the
United States Senate bedecked unmistakably as .1
burglar?
In ;in editorial beneath the picture you complain
that he is not handling witnesses properly. These wit
nesses, let me remind you, are the very persons who
brought about the hearings. They are no doubt un-

happy now but they will probably be even more un
happy il the rral truth ahot.il communism in the Army
is unmasked.
These hearing.--- an interesting, but they are de
laying the important, work of the subcommittee, which
i.- investigating communism in government. Let us
hope that the hearings will soon come to an end so
that the subcon mitt' e can continue the good work
in which it was previously engaged.
