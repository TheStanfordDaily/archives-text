# Luttrell Is Ready for Cal; Card Hopes Are Rising
## 
### 
Stanford's hopes of a BIG MEET victory over California have
been soaring this week with the return of the natives. Jim Lut
trell, hurdler deluxe whose right leg caused him to miss the
UCLA meet, has been working out lightly and is expected to be
ready.
Fred George, who also sat out the UCLA meet, is slated to go

full gun in the 440 and relay. It will
be the fast-stepping captain's last
collegiate dual competition.
Gerry Wood, who hobbled him
self in the high hurdles last week, is
slated to run, as are versatile Roy
Smith, and sprinter Jim Saras.
But, across the bridge and up the
road a piece, California has gloom
ily learned that it will go into the
59th BIG MEET without its captain
and sparkling 880 man Lon Spur
rier. Five sure points are gone there
unless Bear miler Len Simpson or
Ed Wilson can take up the slack.
Card Coach Jack Weiershauser
thinks the Indians will come away
with the meet. "This is the one
we've been pointing for," he said,
j "The others'have just been for prac
tice. The team started slow, but has
finally jelled."
Weiershauser, obviously thinking
about the fine performances of pole
vaulter Bill Flint, half-milcr Larry
Spicer, sprinter Keith Brownsber
ger, and two-miler Chuck Strong,
stated, "We're not going out there
to get licked. We beat UCLA last
week. I like the feeling of winning
better than that other stuff."
But, the Cards will be hard
pressed to capture the laurels as
they will have to cope with the
| likes of Steve Turner, Don Timber
! man, Guy Blackburn, Ron Dozier,
Jim Plessas, John Stellern, Larry
Anderson, Charles Butts, and a
I large supporting cast.
