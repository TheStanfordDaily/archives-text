# 10-Flat
## Card Sprint Star Brownsberger Is Athlete of Week 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Keith Brownsberger, the swift
Stanford sprinter, churned past his
opposilion for double wins in the
Cards' last two track meets, and for
his performances he has been named
The Daily's Athlete of the Week.
Brownsberger was slow in reach
ing his peak this spring, but two
weeks ago against Occidental in the
Southland he cut loose for a blis
tering 9.8 triumph in the 100 and
then came back to upset Bill Car
ling in a 22.1 furlong.
It was the second year in a row
that Brownsberger won both sprints
against the Tigers.
Last week he proved that his Oxy
races were no flukes by winning the
100 on the slow Stadium oval in 10
flat before coasting across the 220
finish in 22.5 to pace a Stanford
sweep.
Brownsberger will be shooting for
two more victories Saturday against
Cal in the BIG MEET, but his com
petition is expected to be a little
tougher.
Unpredictable Guy Blackburn,
who beat Brownsberger in 9.8 and
21.7 last year, is back again to
plague the Cards along with team
mate Herb Jackson.
Brownsberger, who is just a jun
ior. will be dividing his "spare"
time next year between Men's
Council and the Interfraternity
Council business in addition to track
practice.
He was one of three winning can
didates for Men's Council in last
month's ASSU election, and as a
representative from the SAE house,
he was recently voted secretary
treasurer of IFC.
But all his activities shouldn't
prevent Brownie from becoming one
of Stanford's all-time best sprinters.
He ripped off a 9.7 century last year
in the Fresno Relays and he could
conceivably better that time either
this year or next.
Brownsberger was student body
president of little Bonita High
School in Southern California and.
naturally, star of the track team,
breaking the long - standing school
sprint records, of one Glenn Davis,
But he didn't quite crack Davis'
football marks.


ANOTHER WIN—( 'ard dash man
