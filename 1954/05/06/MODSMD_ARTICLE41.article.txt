# LIBE FINES
## Decision Ends Reg Delay Except in Fall 
### DICK MANSFIELD 
Library delinquencies will no
longer hold up student registra
tion for winter, spring, or sum
mer quarters, according to a
memorandum recently issued
by the Library.
The decision follows a conference
of representatives of the Library

and of the Registrar's office.
However, cumulative delinquen
cies from the preceding school year
will still have to be cleared before
autumn quarter registration.
According to the new plan, the
Library will no longer send lists of
delinquencies to the Registrar at the
end of autumn, winter, or spring
quarters. Instead, the Library will
compile lists of its own and notify
delinquent students within three
weeks of the beginning of the next
quarter.
Such notification will require
clearing of the delinquency by the
end of the quarter succeeding de
linquency. Failure to comply with
this request may result in held-up
transcripts or disciplinary action by

the Dean's oflice in serious cases.
Following the ten-week summer
quarter the Library will submit a
complete list of delinquencies for
previous quarters to the Registrar's
office; delinquent students will re
ceive notification at their home ad
dresses and must clear up delin
quencies before autumn registration.
The Recorder in the Registrar's
office will send a list of prospective
graduating students to the Library's
Circulation Division several weeks
before Commencement. These names
will be checked for Library delin
quencies, which must be cleared be
fore graduation.
The change, is effective as of this
summer quarter.
