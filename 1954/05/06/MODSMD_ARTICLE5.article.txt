### RUTH WOLPE 
Tho lower lounge of the Women's Clubhouse was packed yes
terday afternoon as Will Herberg, visiting philosopher-theologian,
presented a talk on "The Mystical Approach to Religion."
This was the second in a series of talks on approaches to relig
ion. The last in the series, the Biblical-Existentional approach,

will he presented in the Women's'*
Clubhouse at 4:15 p.m. Friday.
The mystical approach, said Her
herg, holds that man can by ap
propriate procedures achieve vision
of and union with ultimate reality.
Mysticism, he stated, has three
' components: the doctrine of being,
the doctrine of knowledge, and the
doctrine of human conduct.
The doctrine of being rests on a
dualism between the world of ap
pearance and the world of reality,
he declared.
Knowledge also, he went on to say,
is based on dualism -dualism be
tween the illusory knowledge of the
world of appearance and real knowl
edge of the One Reality.
Mysticism holds that the road to
true knowledge begins with rational
philosophy which passes to a super
rat ional intuitivism in two stages,
he continued, that of illumination
and that of unitive knowledge.
The way to salvation, according to
the mystic doctrine of human con
duet, said Herherg. is* through true
knowledge and union. The misery
of human existence, he continued, is
traced to "benightedness" and con
| sequent enslavement.
The cure for man's misery, say
the mystics, is enlightenment,
which loads to liberation. The
first phase of the mystic liberation,
llerherg stated, is true knowledge.

Then follows "nonattachment" or
detachment from illusory things.
The last stage, he continued, is
overcoming the "last hard core of
illusion, personality."
The speaker then undertook a cri
tique of mysticism as religion.
The dualism of the worlds of ap
pearance and reality collapse under
critical philosophical analysis, he
said.
From the theological point of view,
"mysticism is csoteric atheism." It
is a system of self-salvation and self
deification, he declared.
"There is no pure unmitigated
mysticism in the Christian-Jewish
tradition," Herherg concluded. "In
| the Western world, mysticism ha:.
I ben much modified, and integrated
i into the main tradition of faith."
