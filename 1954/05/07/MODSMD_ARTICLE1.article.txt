# McCarthy May Publish Letter
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 6 (UP) —Senator Joseph R. McCarthy
angrily declared today that he intends to make public a purported
secret "FBI letter" despite a stern warning by Attorney General
Herbert Brownell, Jr., that such action would not be "in the public
interest."
Brownell informed the Senate investigating subcommittee that

the letter, produced at the Army-
McCarthy hearings by McCar
thy, constituted "unauthorized
use" of secret FBI data. He said its
disclosure would be "contrary to the
public interest."
Brownell told the subcommittee
that McCarthy's 2'/» page letter,
which bore the typewritten sig
nature of FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover, was not written by Hoover.
But he confirmed earlier testimony
that it was based on a secret 15-
page FBI memorandum.
The attorney-general also informed
the subcommittee, which had sought
his opinion, that McCarthy's docu
ment contained "evaluations" of FBI
information on certain individuals
which "were not made by Hoover
or anyone acting on his behalf."
At the stormiest session yet, Mc-
Carthy defiantly fired back that he
had "no duty" to keep the document
secret and"I don't intend to." He
said Brownell himself, in the cele
brated Harry Dexter White case,
had made public certain FBI re
ports.
McCarthy did not say when or how
he will make public his "letter."
McCarthy demanded that Brownell
be called as a witness. Hearing chair
man Karl E. Mundt (R., S.D.) at first
overruled him. But after McCarthy
asked Mundt if he was "afraid" to
overrule the attorney general, Mundt
agreed to hold a secret session to
consider McCarthy's request.
The 10th day of hearings—during
which McCarthy talked of "several
months" of proceedings—also pro
duced this development:
McCarthy accused Army Secretary
Robert T. Stevens of committing
"perjury" when Stevens changed
earlier testimony about a Feb. 24
meeting at the Pentagon. Stevens or
iginally said he could recall no
such meeting, but said today he met
with 21 other persons.
