### 
GENEVA, May 6 (UP)—Ho Chi Minh's Communist Viet Minh
rebels today coldly turned down a French appeal for a mercy
truce to permit evacuation of 1,200 wounded defenders of the
Indochina bastion of Dien Bien Phu.
They said any action on the proposal would have to await the

formal start of the Indochina ne-'*
gotiations, now set for Saturday.
The failure of the French ef
forts was disclosed here a few hours
after French Premier Joseph Laniel
won a vote of confidence in the Na
tional Assembly and a free hand to
push at, Geneva for a settlement of
the war.
Paris dispatches f?aid the govern
ment's efforts to arrange the mercy
truce had been a- factor in Laniel's
victory.
Failure of the strenuous French ef
forts to win an evacuation truce
dashed all hopes that the formal talks
could begin in a mood of concilia
tion between the two parties.
Bidault, Jacquet and acting Viet
Nam Foreign Minister Nguyen Trung
Vinh met at dinner tonight to plan
their strategy. The Viet Nam dele
gation declined to reveal its ideas j
for a settlement of the war.
"We will never agree to any proj
rct that would lead tn Virt Nam's
partition," a delegation spokesman
said.
Meanwhile, only agreement on the
chairmanship remained to be worked
out for the Indochina talks in which
the United States, France, Great
Britain, Russia, Red China, the three
Associated States of Indochina, and
the Communist Viet Minh will take
part.
