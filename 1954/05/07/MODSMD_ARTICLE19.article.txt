# Bears Choice In Big Meet
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
A highly -favored California
track team brings its awesome
athletes into the Stanford sta
dium tomorrow afternoon to do
battle with a lightly regarded
Indian running organization in
the 59th running of the BIG
MEET.
Cal, which amassed 44 points
against powerful Southern Califor
nia (Stanford only could scrape up
43), has already wrapped up the
meet according to the experts with
seven "sure" first places and sev
eral more that will naturally fol
low.
But, Jack Weiershauser's dark
horse band of run, jump, and throw
boys have the potential to up-end
Berkeley, experts and all. For in
reality, the Stanford lads stand a
good chance of cementing 10 first
places.
The Bears have performed well
enough in five events to be assured
of five firsts. Len Simpson has been
touring the ntile course around the
4:16 mark, which is seven seconc,.
better than Bob Reed's best of the
year. Steve Turner, a high school
phenom who burned himself out, is
still capable of turning in a winning
440 in which he has buzzed homo
around :48.
Don Timmerman has also been a
consistent performer in this event
and is a likely second.
Despite the fact that Cal's captain
Lon Spurrier will be out of the do
ings, Ed Wilson and Simpson sro
good bets for a 1-2 finish in the
880, what with Wilson pressing 1:53
all season.
John Stellern broke the Cal shot
put mark at 54-8 and with throwing
partner Charles Butt, who hit
the Bears will have another eight
points. Butt has had only one id el
under 150 in the discus and should
beat out an improving Leo Long
and a depentable Bob Kimball.
But, there the "sureness" ends.
Because, if Stanford continue to
improve as it has with every meet,
then kiss the Cal glory goodbye
The Indians will have to nego
tiate eight come-through perform
ances to win. Long's only competi
tion will be the BIG MEET javelin
record, which was set in 1941 by
Cal's Martin Biles at 222-10. Last
week Long came nfear to throwing
the sphere out of the park with a
226-11V2 effort. John Stewart, Stan
ford's high jumping fool, will also be
battling with the records in an at
tempt to better teh 6-6 meet mark.
Keith Brownsberger, who has
rolled up 31 points in dual meet
competition, will have to go all out
to grab the 100 and 220. Guy Blacl •
burn, who beat him last year and
ran a 9.5 as a frosh, will press him
in the century and Turner could be.
the spoiler in the longer distance.
Gerry Wood, who has won all four
of his dual meet high hurdle rart.,
meets a supreme test in Cal's Ron
Dozier. Wood is reportedly in good
shape after pulling a leg mu> clc
against the Bruins and if he can
fly over the barriers around 14.5
should earn five points.
Jim Luttrell won't be in top shape,
but will get the gall in his low lint
die specialty. Cal's Jim Ple.ssas, vvl>->
can boast a best of 24.2, will providf
the pressure, but if Luttrell can re
tain any of his speed and form which
have kept him unbeaten this sec on
he should be able to handle Pic:
Chuck Strong ran his best two
mile race last week and apparency
had plenty left at the finish. The
Bears' Ron Bauer, ex - state hi;;h
School mile champ, has been con
verted out of dire necessity and has
logged a 9:37 for 'the event. Strong
will again have to come through
with his best.
Bill Flint, after toying around at
12-6 in the pole vault, has been
clearing 13 feet easily in the past
couple of weeks, as has Cal's Larry
Anderson. Anderson undoubtedly
read too much about his 14-foot po
tential, as he's been having trouble
getting past 13. Flint could do it,
and don't be surprised if footballer
Jerry Angrove breaks his personal
best and reaches the 13rfoot mark.
Roy Smith, Lawrenceville's gift to
Stanford athletics, may have to ex
tend himself to 23 feet in order to
beat Don Mattson in the broad
jump. Coach Brutus Hamilton may
enter. Turner in hopes that hf'll
come near the 24-foot mark he was
once capable of.
If the Indians can edge out the
Bears in these events and count on
second- and third-place points by
the likes of Norm Jiles, Larry Kel
ley, Ed Fremouw, John Bugge, and
Russ Ferguson then they should
send the Bears reeling back to Ber
keley with their tails dangling be
hind. Way behind.

the Bears will have another eight
points. Butt has had only one id el
under 150 in the discus and should
beat out an improving Leo Long
and a depentable Bob Kimball.
But, there the "sureness" ends.
Because, if Stanford continue to
improve as it has with every meet,
then kiss the Cal glory goodbye
The Indians will have to nego
tiate eight come-through perform
ances to win. Long's only competi
tion will be the BIG MEET javelin
record, which was set in 1941 by
Cal's Martin Biles at 222-10. Last
week Long came nfear to throwing
the sphere out of the park with a
226-11V2 effort. John Stewart, Stan
ford's high jumping fool, will also be
battling with the records in an at
tempt to better teh 6-6 meet mark.
Keith Brownsberger, who has
rolled up 31 points in dual meet
competition, will have to go all out
to grab the 100 and 220. Guy Blacl •
burn, who beat him last year and
ran a 9.5 as a frosh, will press him
in the century and Turner could be.
the spoiler in the longer distance.
Gerry Wood, who has won all four
of his dual meet high hurdle rart.,
meets a supreme test in Cal's Ron
Dozier. Wood is reportedly in good
shape after pulling a leg mu> clc
against the Bruins and if he can
fly over the barriers around 14.5
should earn five points.
Jim Luttrell won't be in top shape,
but will get the gall in his low lint
die specialty. Cal's Jim Ple.ssas, vvl>->
can boast a best of 24.2, will providf
the pressure, but if Luttrell can re
tain any of his speed and form which
have kept him unbeaten this sec on
he should be able to handle Pic:
Chuck Strong ran his best two
mile race last week and apparency
had plenty left at the finish. The
Bears' Ron Bauer, ex - state hi;;h
School mile champ, has been con
verted out of dire necessity and has
logged a 9:37 for 'the event. Strong
will again have to come through
with his best.
Bill Flint, after toying around at
12-6 in the pole vault, has been
clearing 13 feet easily in the past
couple of weeks, as has Cal's Larry
Anderson. Anderson undoubtedly
read too much about his 14-foot po
tential, as he's been having trouble
getting past 13. Flint could do it,
and don't be surprised if footballer
Jerry Angrove breaks his personal
best and reaches the 13rfoot mark.
Roy Smith, Lawrenceville's gift to
Stanford athletics, may have to ex
tend himself to 23 feet in order to
beat Don Mattson in the broad
jump. Coach Brutus Hamilton may
enter. Turner in hopes that hf'll
come near the 24-foot mark he was
once capable of.
If the Indians can edge out the
Bears in these events and count on
second- and third-place points by
the likes of Norm Jiles, Larry Kel
ley, Ed Fremouw, John Bugge, and
Russ Ferguson then they should
send the Bears reeling back to Ber
keley with their tails dangling be
hind. Way behind.
A highly -favored California
track team brings its awesome
athletes into the Stanford sta
dium tomorrow afternoon to do
battle with a lightly regarded
Indian running organization in
the 59th running of the BIG
MEET.
Cal, which amassed 44 points
against powerful Southern Califor
nia (Stanford only could scrape up
43), has already wrapped up the
meet according to the experts with
seven "sure" first places and sev
eral more that will naturally fol
low.
But, Jack Weiershauser's dark
horse band of run, jump, and throw
boys have the potential to up-end
Berkeley, experts and all. For in
reality, the Stanford lads stand a
good chance of cementing 10 first
places.
The Bears have performed well
enough in five events to be assured
of five firsts. Len Simpson has been
touring the ntile course around the
4:16 mark, which is seven seconc,.
better than Bob Reed's best of the
year. Steve Turner, a high school
phenom who burned himself out, is
still capable of turning in a winning
440 in which he has buzzed homo
around :48.
Don Timmerman has also been a
consistent performer in this event
and is a likely second.
Despite the fact that Cal's captain
Lon Spurrier will be out of the do
ings, Ed Wilson and Simpson sro
good bets for a 1-2 finish in the
880, what with Wilson pressing 1:53
all season.
John Stellern broke the Cal shot
put mark at 54-8 and with throwing

can boast a best of 24.2, will providf
the pressure, but if Luttrell can re
tain any of his speed and form which
have kept him unbeaten this sec on
he should be able to handle Pic:
Chuck Strong ran his best two
mile race last week and apparency
had plenty left at the finish. The
Bears' Ron Bauer, ex - state hi;;h
School mile champ, has been con
verted out of dire necessity and has
logged a 9:37 for 'the event. Strong
will again have to come through
with his best.
Bill Flint, after toying around at
12-6 in the pole vault, has been
clearing 13 feet easily in the past
couple of weeks, as has Cal's Larry
Anderson. Anderson undoubtedly
read too much about his 14-foot po
tential, as he's been having trouble
getting past 13. Flint could do it,
and don't be surprised if footballer
Jerry Angrove breaks his personal
best and reaches the 13rfoot mark.
Roy Smith, Lawrenceville's gift to
Stanford athletics, may have to ex
tend himself to 23 feet in order to
beat Don Mattson in the broad
jump. Coach Brutus Hamilton may
enter. Turner in hopes that hf'll
come near the 24-foot mark he was
once capable of.
If the Indians can edge out the
Bears in these events and count on
second- and third-place points by
the likes of Norm Jiles, Larry Kel
ley, Ed Fremouw, John Bugge, and
Russ Ferguson then they should
send the Bears reeling back to Ber

A highly -favored California
track team brings its awesome
athletes into the Stanford sta
dium tomorrow afternoon to do
battle with a lightly regarded
Indian running organization in
the 59th running of the BIG
MEET.
Cal, which amassed 44 points
against powerful Southern Califor
nia (Stanford only could scrape up
43), has already wrapped up the
meet according to the experts with
seven "sure" first places and sev
eral more that will naturally fol
low.
But, Jack Weiershauser's dark
horse band of run, jump, and throw
boys have the potential to up-end
Berkeley, experts and all. For in
reality, the Stanford lads stand a
good chance of cementing 10 first
places.
The Bears have performed well
enough in five events to be assured
of five firsts. Len Simpson has been
touring the ntile course around the
4:16 mark, which is seven seconc,.
better than Bob Reed's best of the
year. Steve Turner, a high school
phenom who burned himself out, is
still capable of turning in a winning
440 in which he has buzzed homo
around :48.
Don Timmerman has also been a
consistent performer in this event
and is a likely second.
Despite the fact that Cal's captain
Lon Spurrier will be out of the do
ings, Ed Wilson and Simpson sro
good bets for a 1-2 finish in the
880, what with Wilson pressing 1:53
all season.
John Stellern broke the Cal shot
put mark at 54-8 and with throwing
partner Charles Butt, who hit
the Bears will have another eight
points. Butt has had only one id el
under 150 in the discus and should
beat out an improving Leo Long
and a depentable Bob Kimball.
But, there the "sureness" ends.
Because, if Stanford continue to
improve as it has with every meet,
then kiss the Cal glory goodbye
The Indians will have to nego
tiate eight come-through perform
ances to win. Long's only competi
tion will be the BIG MEET javelin
record, which was set in 1941 by
Cal's Martin Biles at 222-10. Last
week Long came nfear to throwing
the sphere out of the park with a
226-11V2 effort. John Stewart, Stan
ford's high jumping fool, will also be
battling with the records in an at
tempt to better teh 6-6 meet mark.
Keith Brownsberger, who has
rolled up 31 points in dual meet
competition, will have to go all out
to grab the 100 and 220. Guy Blacl •
burn, who beat him last year and
ran a 9.5 as a frosh, will press him
in the century and Turner could be.
the spoiler in the longer distance.
Gerry Wood, who has won all four
of his dual meet high hurdle rart.,
meets a supreme test in Cal's Ron
Dozier. Wood is reportedly in good
shape after pulling a leg mu> clc
against the Bruins and if he can
fly over the barriers around 14.5
should earn five points.
