## Questions on the Code Report 
### 
Wednesday night's Honor Code report to
the Executive Committee, summarized below,
has raised two possible questions which many
students are undoubtedly asking.
First: Is the report just a restatement of the
original problem and why didn't it include a
specific recommendation on the question of
taking exams from the classroom?
Second: Why did the Executive Committee
table adoption and discussion on the report
for one week?
Wo believe that the first question may be
answered by glancing at the recommendations
included in the report. It's obvious that the
special ASSU Honor Code committee found a
much deeper problem than the question,
"Should exams be taken outside the class
room?" That question, the committee realized
after discovering a definite split in student
opinion, could not be answered by a simple
"yes" or "no." And the "deeper problem"
became one of education and orientation and

the need for close cooperation between the
faculty and students.
The recommendations have provided for
that education and orientation on a continuous,
yearly basis. And the recommendation for the
constitutional change has specified that co
operation between the faculty and students.
Excom tabled adoption on the report and its
recommendations to give every student a week
to consider its details and voice their opinions
to their representatives. The report was care
fully prepared, it was relatively complete, and
it was the result of five months of work. But
we cannot go on the assumption that it is per
fect. It needs critical appraisal and discussion
before Excom can have complete confidence in
its student support.
The report was good. We, too, commend the
committee for their work in its preparation. But
we hope that Excom and the students do not
sit back with an attitude of "we've done our
share" and adopt its recommendations without
the appraisal and discussion we mentioned.
