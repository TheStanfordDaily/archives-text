# Code Report Summary
## 
### 
(Editor's note: The following is
u summary of the recommendations
included in the report of the spe
cial ASSU Honor Code Commit
tee which was presented to the
Executive Committee meeting j
Wednesday night.)
1. Education
The committee recommends that i
the preliminary orientation program j
remain essentially unchanged, with i
a letter and Fundamental Standard- '
Honor Code booklet containing the!
essential facts sent to all new stu- !
dents prior to registration.
The verbal orientation during pre
reg week would be designed to re
view the facts and to inculcate social
attitudes regarding the Code.
It is further recommended that an
annual discussion program be held
to educate the students—including
upper classmen and graduates—in
specific procedures and to invigor
ate social attitudes regarding the
Code.
It. is recommended by the commit
tee that letters explaining the Code
and its basic precepts be sent to all
faculty members at the beginning
of each year and/or upon arrival.
If. Investigation and Elimination
of Problem Areas
It is recommended that room con
ditions be improved by providing
seating adequate to ensure an alter
nate .seating arrangement.
It is recommended that the no
smoking rule be enforced in the ma
jority of classrooms.
The committee feels that a policy
of going out for a break during long
tests, instead of smoking in the ex- i
amination room, would help to recti
fy one of the major complaints
about testing conditions.
The ROTC departments are felt
to be undermining the Code, and the
committee recommends that greater
faculty cooperation in that area
should be sought with regard to
testing and grading.
The committee feels that undue
temptation results from giving the
same test in consecutive ROTC class
periods.

The committee feels that the stig
ma attached to reporting Code vio
lators is one of the major under
mining influences of the Honor sys
tem. Therefore, the committee rec
ommends that meetings be held with
j leaders in the areas which show re
| luctance in reporting violations, at
i which time the larger detriment of
' their actions should be pointed out
| and their cooperation in coping with
| the problem be sought.
The committee feels that there are I
I many misconceptions regarding the
procedures of the Council for Stu
dent Control, and that there is a!
need for re-evaluation of penalties j
for violators of the Code. It recom- j
mends that this problem be solved
by educating the student body on !
exact procedures and by reviewing
Council policies.
The committee feels that merely
signing one's name to the Honor
Code pledge on a test is meaningless.
Therefore, they recommend the
writing of a short statement, such
as "I have upheld the Honor Code,"
followed by the signature, at the end
j of each examination.
The committee recommends that
the term "third person" be elimin
ated, and that individual responsi
bility be emphasized.
111. Constitution Revision and
Addition
The committee feels that the Code
is inadequate in certain respects to
put over the feeling of the honor
system, and that the wording is not
directed to carry out the spirit of the
Honor Code in some respects.
Because of these semantic difficul
ties, it is felt that individual and col
lective aspects of personal responsi
bility should be emphasized.
The committee feels that the Uni
versity has a constantly changing
population, and must, therefore,
have some means of perpetuating
the spirit and the letter of the Code.
The broad, general by-law addi
tion recommended would provide a
means to adapt the Code to particu
lar situations in the future without
completely changing the wording of

the Code or making a limiting list
of provisions.
IV. The Issue of Taking Tests Out
of the Examination Room
The committee feels that the re
sults of their questionnaire show
that there is a definite split within
the student body on the question of
whether or not tests should be taken
from the examintaion room.
The committee feels that the ad-
I dition of the broad, general phrase
I in the by-laws, the improvement of
examination - room conditions, and
the development and furtherance of
! faculty trust through better under
j standing brought about by future
j orientation and cooperation would
| further alleviate the problem.
The committee feels that through
education of students a tradition can
be established, and a new policy may
evolve to alleviate concern with the
specific problem of taking tests out
side the classroom.
By setting up a broad framework
in the constitution, the committee
has established a means by which
specific problems can be met and
solved as.they arise in the future.
The committee feels that it is un
able to make any one specific rec
ommendation to solve the problem
of taking examinations from the
classroom, but submits the following
possible suggestions:
1. Cooperation between students
and faculty in specific class situ
ations (through discussions and or
I voting);
'2. Following the request of Hie
1 professor;
15. Leaving the examination
room, hut staying in the "quad
! area."
The committee decided not to in
clude'a constitutional provision on
taking tests from the classroom in
their report because of the faculty
student disagreement on the ques
tion, the possibility that such a priv
ilege could be abused, and the pos
sibility that such a clause would
make the constitution too specific
and inflexible, and would be the be
ginning of a long list of "little laws."

ommendation to solve the problem
of taking examinations from the
classroom, but submits the following
possible suggestions:
1. Cooperation between students
and faculty in specific class situ
ations (through discussions and or
I voting);
'2. Following the request of Hie
1 professor;
15. Leaving the examination
room, hut staying in the "quad
! area."
The committee decided not to in
clude'a constitutional provision on
taking tests from the classroom in
their report because of the faculty
student disagreement on the ques
tion, the possibility that such a priv
ilege could be abused, and the pos
sibility that such a clause would
make the constitution too specific
and inflexible, and would be the be
ginning of a long list of "little laws."
(Editor's note: The following is
u summary of the recommendations
included in the report of the spe
cial ASSU Honor Code Commit
tee which was presented to the
Executive Committee meeting j
Wednesday night.)
1. Education
The committee recommends that i
the preliminary orientation program j
remain essentially unchanged, with i
a letter and Fundamental Standard- '
Honor Code booklet containing the!
essential facts sent to all new stu- !
dents prior to registration.
The verbal orientation during pre
reg week would be designed to re
view the facts and to inculcate social
attitudes regarding the Code.
It is further recommended that an
annual discussion program be held
to educate the students—including
upper classmen and graduates—in
specific procedures and to invigor
ate social attitudes regarding the
Code.
It. is recommended by the commit
tee that letters explaining the Code
and its basic precepts be sent to all
faculty members at the beginning
of each year and/or upon arrival.
If. Investigation and Elimination
of Problem Areas
It is recommended that room con
ditions be improved by providing
seating adequate to ensure an alter
nate .seating arrangement.
It is recommended that the no
smoking rule be enforced in the ma
jority of classrooms.
The committee feels that a policy
of going out for a break during long
tests, instead of smoking in the ex- i
amination room, would help to recti
fy one of the major complaints
about testing conditions.
The ROTC departments are felt
to be undermining the Code, and the
committee recommends that greater
faculty cooperation in that area
should be sought with regard to
testing and grading.
The committee feels that undue
temptation results from giving the
same test in consecutive ROTC class
periods.

The committee feels that the stig
ma attached to reporting Code vio
lators is one of the major under
mining influences of the Honor sys
tem. Therefore, the committee rec
ommends that meetings be held with
j leaders in the areas which show re
| luctance in reporting violations, at
i which time the larger detriment of
' their actions should be pointed out
| and their cooperation in coping with
| the problem be sought.
The committee feels that there are I
I many misconceptions regarding the
procedures of the Council for Stu
dent Control, and that there is a!
need for re-evaluation of penalties j
for violators of the Code. It recom- j
mends that this problem be solved
by educating the student body on !
exact procedures and by reviewing
Council policies.
The committee feels that merely
signing one's name to the Honor
Code pledge on a test is meaningless.
Therefore, they recommend the
writing of a short statement, such
as "I have upheld the Honor Code,"
followed by the signature, at the end
j of each examination.
The committee recommends that
the term "third person" be elimin
ated, and that individual responsi
bility be emphasized.
111. Constitution Revision and
Addition
The committee feels that the Code
is inadequate in certain respects to
put over the feeling of the honor
system, and that the wording is not
directed to carry out the spirit of the
Honor Code in some respects.
Because of these semantic difficul
ties, it is felt that individual and col
lective aspects of personal responsi
bility should be emphasized.
The committee feels that the Uni
versity has a constantly changing
population, and must, therefore,
have some means of perpetuating
the spirit and the letter of the Code.
The broad, general by-law addi
tion recommended would provide a
means to adapt the Code to particu
lar situations in the future without
completely changing the wording of

the Code or making a limiting list
of provisions.
IV. The Issue of Taking Tests Out
of the Examination Room
The committee feels that the re
sults of their questionnaire show
that there is a definite split within
the student body on the question of
whether or not tests should be taken
from the examintaion room.
The committee feels that the ad-
I dition of the broad, general phrase
I in the by-laws, the improvement of
examination - room conditions, and
the development and furtherance of
! faculty trust through better under
j standing brought about by future
j orientation and cooperation would
| further alleviate the problem.
The committee feels that through
education of students a tradition can
be established, and a new policy may
evolve to alleviate concern with the
specific problem of taking tests out
side the classroom.
By setting up a broad framework
in the constitution, the committee
has established a means by which
specific problems can be met and
solved as.they arise in the future.

whether or not tests should be taken
from the examintaion room.
The committee feels that the ad-
I dition of the broad, general phrase
I in the by-laws, the improvement of
examination - room conditions, and
the development and furtherance of
! faculty trust through better under
j standing brought about by future
j orientation and cooperation would
| further alleviate the problem.
The committee feels that through
education of students a tradition can
be established, and a new policy may
evolve to alleviate concern with the
specific problem of taking tests out
side the classroom.
By setting up a broad framework
in the constitution, the committee
has established a means by which
specific problems can be met and
solved as.they arise in the future.
The committee feels that it is un
able to make any one specific rec
ommendation to solve the problem
of taking examinations from the
classroom, but submits the following
possible suggestions:
1. Cooperation between students
and faculty in specific class situ
ations (through discussions and or
I voting);
'2. Following the request of Hie
1 professor;
15. Leaving the examination
room, hut staying in the "quad
! area."
The committee decided not to in
clude'a constitutional provision on
taking tests from the classroom in
their report because of the faculty
student disagreement on the ques
tion, the possibility that such a priv
ilege could be abused, and the pos
sibility that such a clause would
make the constitution too specific
and inflexible, and would be the be
ginning of a long list of "little laws."
(Editor's note: The following is
u summary of the recommendations
included in the report of the spe
cial ASSU Honor Code Commit
tee which was presented to the
Executive Committee meeting j
Wednesday night.)
1. Education
The committee recommends that i
the preliminary orientation program j
remain essentially unchanged, with i
a letter and Fundamental Standard- '
Honor Code booklet containing the!
essential facts sent to all new stu- !
dents prior to registration.
The verbal orientation during pre
reg week would be designed to re
view the facts and to inculcate social
attitudes regarding the Code.
It is further recommended that an
annual discussion program be held
to educate the students—including
upper classmen and graduates—in
specific procedures and to invigor
ate social attitudes regarding the
Code.
It. is recommended by the commit
tee that letters explaining the Code
and its basic precepts be sent to all
faculty members at the beginning
of each year and/or upon arrival.
If. Investigation and Elimination
of Problem Areas
It is recommended that room con
ditions be improved by providing
seating adequate to ensure an alter
nate .seating arrangement.
It is recommended that the no
smoking rule be enforced in the ma
jority of classrooms.
The committee feels that a policy
of going out for a break during long
tests, instead of smoking in the ex- i
amination room, would help to recti
fy one of the major complaints
about testing conditions.
The ROTC departments are felt
to be undermining the Code, and the
committee recommends that greater
faculty cooperation in that area
should be sought with regard to
testing and grading.
The committee feels that undue
temptation results from giving the
same test in consecutive ROTC class
periods.

The committee feels that the stig
ma attached to reporting Code vio
lators is one of the major under
mining influences of the Honor sys
tem. Therefore, the committee rec
ommends that meetings be held with
j leaders in the areas which show re
| luctance in reporting violations, at
i which time the larger detriment of
' their actions should be pointed out
| and their cooperation in coping with
| the problem be sought.
The committee feels that there are I
I many misconceptions regarding the
procedures of the Council for Stu
dent Control, and that there is a!
need for re-evaluation of penalties j
for violators of the Code. It recom- j
mends that this problem be solved
by educating the student body on !
exact procedures and by reviewing
Council policies.
The committee feels that merely
signing one's name to the Honor
Code pledge on a test is meaningless.
Therefore, they recommend the
writing of a short statement, such
as "I have upheld the Honor Code,"
followed by the signature, at the end
j of each examination.
The committee recommends that
the term "third person" be elimin
ated, and that individual responsi
bility be emphasized.
111. Constitution Revision and
Addition
The committee feels that the Code
is inadequate in certain respects to
put over the feeling of the honor
system, and that the wording is not
directed to carry out the spirit of the
Honor Code in some respects.
Because of these semantic difficul
ties, it is felt that individual and col
lective aspects of personal responsi
bility should be emphasized.
The committee feels that the Uni
versity has a constantly changing
population, and must, therefore,
have some means of perpetuating
the spirit and the letter of the Code.
The broad, general by-law addi
tion recommended would provide a
means to adapt the Code to particu
lar situations in the future without
completely changing the wording of

the Code or making a limiting list
of provisions.
IV. The Issue of Taking Tests Out
of the Examination Room
The committee feels that the re
sults of their questionnaire show
that there is a definite split within
the student body on the question of
whether or not tests should be taken
from the examintaion room.
The committee feels that the ad-
I dition of the broad, general phrase

! faculty trust through better under
j standing brought about by future
j orientation and cooperation would
