# A 						GENIUS AT LAUGHS
## 'Knock on Wood' Makes Superb Use of Kaye's Satire, Mimicry 
### 
By J. P. GROTHE
Danny Kayc is a genius in' the true sense of the
word. He is a genius in his fieldâ€”comedy. Every
movement of his fingers, every twitch of a muscle
in his pliable face is perfection; it is aimed at getting

the highest degree of laugh re
sponse from the audience.
Kaye, unlike Bob Hope, is a
serious, even slightly shy, person
off-stage. Hope doesn't have to
work for his humor; it comes nat
urally. Kaye, on the other hand,
has to make a deliberate effort to
achieve the types of humor that
are his fortes . . . mimicry and
: atire. But the final effort never

looks labored; it'f; about as smooth as a Bob Garrett
pass.
This doesn't mean that all Kaye movies have been
walloppers. But if they haven't, it's been the fault
of the script, not of the Redhead with electricity in
his body.
In Paramount's "Knock on Wood," which will soon
be on the Peninsula, Danny Kaye has been given a
vehicle which superbly takes advantage of his abun
dant talents. Without any qualifications, the writer
can say that he has never been so convulsed by a
movie before.

The plot is not extraordinarily unique. It's a new
twist to an old spy-chase theme. In this case, the
spies do the chasing. Kaye plays a neurotic ven
triloquist. Unknown to him, a spy ring has placed
some atomic bomb plans in the heads -of his two
dummies. The result is that Kaye is chased all over
Europe.
The plot of the chase itself isn't anything spec
tacular. It's the places Ihat Kaye gets chased into
that give this flick its kick.
At one point. Kaye gets chased into a theater
which, it turns out, is housing a gala production of
Russian ballet. Kaye is forced onto the stage, tries
to appear like he's one of the troupe, and the result
is laughter which is choking in intensity.
In another supremely funny instante, Kaye ducks
into an English car salesroom. He assumes a thick
English accent, pretends he's,a salesman, and de
scribes things like "the overhead underslung oscil
lating compression deeravinator."
Kaye's love interest is the Swedish actress Mai
Zetterling, who has been described as another Garbo
or Bergman. She is nothing of the sort, although
she is much better than adequate.
But the show Stopper, of course, is bouncing Dan
ny. He is a genius at comedy. And "Knock on
Wood" is the perfect vehicle to display that genius.
