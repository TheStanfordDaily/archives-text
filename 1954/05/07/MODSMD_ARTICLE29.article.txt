## The 						Inside Pitch 
### 
Stanford and California, schools with so-so track teams, collide for the
59th time tomorrow in the BIG MEET, a meet that is far from so-so. As
in all Card and Bear sporting contests, the dope sheet is as reliable as a
prediction for snow in July.
More often than not it has taken the come-through performance to turn
the tide and save the day. The day has been saved for Stanford 30 times,
while .Cal has come through with 26 victories. Two meets ended in ties.

The series dates back to 1893 when <
before the Farm thinclads under
Dad Moulton negotiated a win.
We were talking with Dink Tem
pleton the other day about some
of the pulsating BIG MEETs of the
past. Templeton is surely an au
thority on the subject, having
starred in Cardinal and White track
livery and having coached Stanford
track for 20 years (1918, 1921-39)
in which his teams won 14 scraps
with the Bears.
Probably two of the weirdest and
heart-stopping meets according to
Templeton were those of 1913 and
1915.
The former was held at the Cal
track: a track which was laid out
on a curve surrounded by trees and
ran over a bridge which spanned a
brook. In this meet a prejudiced
California official nearly stole the
show from the Indians. A disputed
linish of the 220 caused the trouble.
The Cards' Cap Campbell easily
won the race and Stanford's Paul

McKee apparently had finished second a few yards ahead of Cal's Fui
Wood. That's the way the Stanford official saw it,' but not the Cal man.
He called a dead heat for second.
As it turned out the meet hinged on his decision. The judges wrangled
for an hour. If the dead heat call was accepted Cal would win, and if
McKee was given second, Stanford would win. Sophomore Rick Temple
ton (Card track star and Dink's older brother) was fuming and finally
argued the Cal judge into running off second place. So McKee and Wood
went at it again and McKee, a veritable machine, finished two yards
ahead of Wood to give Stanford a 61 1/5 to GO 4/5 victory.
In 1915, 7.000 track enthusiasts poured into Cal's new $95,000 stadium
to watch the relay decide the meet. Stanford's running sensation Ed lieal
had been held out of the 140 in order to keep him fresh for the anchor
lap of the event. Jim Todd, Cal's captain and anchor man, had been
beaten badly in the 140 and had been sick throughout the meet. The Cal
trainers worked feverishly over him applying ice pack and other medi
cations.
In the first three laps Stanford built up a 20-yard lead and with good ol'
Beal set to go the anchor Stanford was sure to win. But, Todd, who had
been helped to his position and was swathed in head bandages, running
t'ie race ol his life gulled even with Beal 100 yards from home. The two
moved like one, but Todd hit the tape a half inch ahead of Beal after sprint
ing the entire distance.
The scoreboard registered a victory for Cal, and the Blue and Gold
rooters flowed out of the stands singing and roaring as they formed a
serpentine on the field. But, heady Rick Templeton once more came to
the rescue. At the start of the meet he had taken a leap in the broad
jump to warm up for the high jump and hurdles. He checked with the
officials and discovered he'd posted a fourth. He had forfeited all his
jumps except the last one and that couldn't be forfeited. So Rick was
given one jump. He had done 21-3, but needed 22 feet for the winning
points.
The official marked off the distance. The Cal fans issued their disap
proval. It was a full fifteen suspenseful minutes before Rick was ready.
And then hitting the take-off perfectly, Rick soared to the 22-foot mark
to give Stanford the meet, 62-00.
Templeton can recall many come-through for the Indians. There was
Bill Richardson, a crackeriack half-miler, who had made a place on the
Olympic team. In the BIG MEET of 1925 he came back after being beaten
soundly by Elmer Bowden in the BXO, and taken violently ill, to outrun
Bovvden in the relay with a :47 lap.
Tiny Hartranft, Athletic Director at San Jose State, was the first of the
great weight-men. Bud Spencer, sports editor of the San Francisco News,
recovered from a serious automobile accident to run Cal ragged in the
meets of the late 'twenties.
The nationally-famous and one-time simultaneous world record holder
of the 440-. tlOO—, 880-, and 100-yard runs. Ben Eastman caused the Bears
no end of trouble. In his senior year he suffered a pulled muscle and
never again had the speed to be a quarter-mile winner. But he taught his
teammate the pace and his protege romped to victory against Cal.
You can't overlook the most feared twosome in-the history of the BIG
MFET, Ray Malott and Jack Weiershauser. Here was an unbeatable pair
that dominated the 440, 880, hurdles, sprints, and sparked the relay team
as well.
Kd Burrows, who was an ace long distance- man when he wanted to
be, also rates with the best. After spending the week of the 1938 BIG
MEET in the Men's Rest Home, he traveled the mile course in a winning
time of 4:17 9 and sped to glory in the two-mile in 9:32 7.
And then how about the pseudo-athletes like John McCurdy. The 6-8
barefooted high jumper soared to a tie in the intra-mural meet last year
and was drafted for the Cal meet. He placed third and won his Block S.
When it comes to big point winners. Gay Bryan's 23 points in 1949 heads
the list. The jack-of-all-trades placed first in the 100, 220. low hurdles,
high jump, and Idst in his best event, the broadjump, despite a 24-1 effort.
The following year Bryan established the meet record at 25-2M>.
Jess Wtlis garnered 20 points in a winning cause in 1919, and Bob
Mathias was a lingering thorn in the Bear paw, causing the most con
sternation in 1952 by piling up 19 points.
Clyde Jeffery, Downing McKee, Lew Davis, Pete Zagar, Mint Howell,
Sam Klopstock, Swede Leisner, Biff Hoffman, these are only a few of the
BIG MEET greats. There are many, who even though they may have con
tributed no more than a fraction of a point, are heroes in every respect.
Because in the BIG MEET every point counts.
Stanford and California, schools with so-so track teams, collide tomorrow.
There'll be new names to add to the roll call of come-through performers.

DINK TEMPLETON
—14 Bear scalps
Stanford and California, schools with so-so track teams, collide for the
59th time tomorrow in the BIG MEET, a meet that is far from so-so. As
in all Card and Bear sporting contests, the dope sheet is as reliable as a
prediction for snow in July.
More often than not it has taken the come-through performance to turn
the tide and save the day. The day has been saved for Stanford 30 times,
while .Cal has come through with 26 victories. Two meets ended in ties.

The series dates back to 1893 when <
before the Farm thinclads under
Dad Moulton negotiated a win.
We were talking with Dink Tem
pleton the other day about some
of the pulsating BIG MEETs of the
past. Templeton is surely an au
thority on the subject, having
starred in Cardinal and White track
livery and having coached Stanford
track for 20 years (1918, 1921-39)
in which his teams won 14 scraps
with the Bears.
Probably two of the weirdest and
heart-stopping meets according to
Templeton were those of 1913 and
1915.
The former was held at the Cal
track: a track which was laid out
on a curve surrounded by trees and
ran over a bridge which spanned a
brook. In this meet a prejudiced
California official nearly stole the
show from the Indians. A disputed
linish of the 220 caused the trouble.
The Cards' Cap Campbell easily
won the race and Stanford's Paul

McKee apparently had finished second a few yards ahead of Cal's Fui
Wood. That's the way the Stanford official saw it,' but not the Cal man.
He called a dead heat for second.
As it turned out the meet hinged on his decision. The judges wrangled
for an hour. If the dead heat call was accepted Cal would win, and if
McKee was given second, Stanford would win. Sophomore Rick Temple
ton (Card track star and Dink's older brother) was fuming and finally
argued the Cal judge into running off second place. So McKee and Wood
went at it again and McKee, a veritable machine, finished two yards
ahead of Wood to give Stanford a 61 1/5 to GO 4/5 victory.
In 1915, 7.000 track enthusiasts poured into Cal's new $95,000 stadium
to watch the relay decide the meet. Stanford's running sensation Ed lieal
had been held out of the 140 in order to keep him fresh for the anchor
lap of the event. Jim Todd, Cal's captain and anchor man, had been
beaten badly in the 140 and had been sick throughout the meet. The Cal
trainers worked feverishly over him applying ice pack and other medi
cations.
In the first three laps Stanford built up a 20-yard lead and with good ol'
Beal set to go the anchor Stanford was sure to win. But, Todd, who had
been helped to his position and was swathed in head bandages, running
t'ie race ol his life gulled even with Beal 100 yards from home. The two
moved like one, but Todd hit the tape a half inch ahead of Beal after sprint
ing the entire distance.
The scoreboard registered a victory for Cal, and the Blue and Gold
rooters flowed out of the stands singing and roaring as they formed a
serpentine on the field. But, heady Rick Templeton once more came to
the rescue. At the start of the meet he had taken a leap in the broad
jump to warm up for the high jump and hurdles. He checked with the
officials and discovered he'd posted a fourth. He had forfeited all his
jumps except the last one and that couldn't be forfeited. So Rick was
given one jump. He had done 21-3, but needed 22 feet for the winning
points.
The official marked off the distance. The Cal fans issued their disap
proval. It was a full fifteen suspenseful minutes before Rick was ready.
And then hitting the take-off perfectly, Rick soared to the 22-foot mark
to give Stanford the meet, 62-00.
Templeton can recall many come-through for the Indians. There was
Bill Richardson, a crackeriack half-miler, who had made a place on the
Olympic team. In the BIG MEET of 1925 he came back after being beaten
soundly by Elmer Bowden in the BXO, and taken violently ill, to outrun
Bovvden in the relay with a :47 lap.

McKee apparently had finished second a few yards ahead of Cal's Fui
Wood. That's the way the Stanford official saw it,' but not the Cal man.
He called a dead heat for second.
As it turned out the meet hinged on his decision. The judges wrangled
for an hour. If the dead heat call was accepted Cal would win, and if
McKee was given second, Stanford would win. Sophomore Rick Temple
ton (Card track star and Dink's older brother) was fuming and finally
argued the Cal judge into running off second place. So McKee and Wood
went at it again and McKee, a veritable machine, finished two yards
ahead of Wood to give Stanford a 61 1/5 to GO 4/5 victory.
In 1915, 7.000 track enthusiasts poured into Cal's new $95,000 stadium
to watch the relay decide the meet. Stanford's running sensation Ed lieal
had been held out of the 140 in order to keep him fresh for the anchor
lap of the event. Jim Todd, Cal's captain and anchor man, had been
beaten badly in the 140 and had been sick throughout the meet. The Cal
trainers worked feverishly over him applying ice pack and other medi
cations.
In the first three laps Stanford built up a 20-yard lead and with good ol'
Beal set to go the anchor Stanford was sure to win. But, Todd, who had
been helped to his position and was swathed in head bandages, running
t'ie race ol his life gulled even with Beal 100 yards from home. The two
moved like one, but Todd hit the tape a half inch ahead of Beal after sprint
ing the entire distance.
The scoreboard registered a victory for Cal, and the Blue and Gold
rooters flowed out of the stands singing and roaring as they formed a
serpentine on the field. But, heady Rick Templeton once more came to
the rescue. At the start of the meet he had taken a leap in the broad
jump to warm up for the high jump and hurdles. He checked with the
officials and discovered he'd posted a fourth. He had forfeited all his
jumps except the last one and that couldn't be forfeited. So Rick was
given one jump. He had done 21-3, but needed 22 feet for the winning
points.
The official marked off the distance. The Cal fans issued their disap
proval. It was a full fifteen suspenseful minutes before Rick was ready.
And then hitting the take-off perfectly, Rick soared to the 22-foot mark
to give Stanford the meet, 62-00.
Templeton can recall many come-through for the Indians. There was
Bill Richardson, a crackeriack half-miler, who had made a place on the
Olympic team. In the BIG MEET of 1925 he came back after being beaten
soundly by Elmer Bowden in the BXO, and taken violently ill, to outrun
Bovvden in the relay with a :47 lap.
Tiny Hartranft, Athletic Director at San Jose State, was the first of the
great weight-men. Bud Spencer, sports editor of the San Francisco News,
recovered from a serious automobile accident to run Cal ragged in the
meets of the late 'twenties.
The nationally-famous and one-time simultaneous world record holder
of the 440-. tlOO—, 880-, and 100-yard runs. Ben Eastman caused the Bears
no end of trouble. In his senior year he suffered a pulled muscle and
never again had the speed to be a quarter-mile winner. But he taught his
teammate the pace and his protege romped to victory against Cal.
You can't overlook the most feared twosome in-the history of the BIG
MFET, Ray Malott and Jack Weiershauser. Here was an unbeatable pair
that dominated the 440, 880, hurdles, sprints, and sparked the relay team
as well.
Kd Burrows, who was an ace long distance- man when he wanted to
be, also rates with the best. After spending the week of the 1938 BIG
MEET in the Men's Rest Home, he traveled the mile course in a winning
time of 4:17 9 and sped to glory in the two-mile in 9:32 7.
And then how about the pseudo-athletes like John McCurdy. The 6-8
barefooted high jumper soared to a tie in the intra-mural meet last year
and was drafted for the Cal meet. He placed third and won his Block S.
When it comes to big point winners. Gay Bryan's 23 points in 1949 heads
the list. The jack-of-all-trades placed first in the 100, 220. low hurdles,
high jump, and Idst in his best event, the broadjump, despite a 24-1 effort.
The following year Bryan established the meet record at 25-2M>.
Jess Wtlis garnered 20 points in a winning cause in 1919, and Bob
Mathias was a lingering thorn in the Bear paw, causing the most con
sternation in 1952 by piling up 19 points.
Clyde Jeffery, Downing McKee, Lew Davis, Pete Zagar, Mint Howell,
Sam Klopstock, Swede Leisner, Biff Hoffman, these are only a few of the
BIG MEET greats. There are many, who even though they may have con
tributed no more than a fraction of a point, are heroes in every respect.
Because in the BIG MEET every point counts.
Stanford and California, schools with so-so track teams, collide tomorrow.
There'll be new names to add to the roll call of come-through performers.


DINK TEMPLETON
—14 Bear scalps
Stanford and California, schools with so-so track teams, collide for the
59th time tomorrow in the BIG MEET, a meet that is far from so-so. As
in all Card and Bear sporting contests, the dope sheet is as reliable as a
prediction for snow in July.
More often than not it has taken the come-through performance to turn
the tide and save the day. The day has been saved for Stanford 30 times,
while .Cal has come through with 26 victories. Two meets ended in ties.

The series dates back to 1893 when <
before the Farm thinclads under
Dad Moulton negotiated a win.
We were talking with Dink Tem
pleton the other day about some
of the pulsating BIG MEETs of the
past. Templeton is surely an au
thority on the subject, having
starred in Cardinal and White track
livery and having coached Stanford
track for 20 years (1918, 1921-39)
in which his teams won 14 scraps
with the Bears.
Probably two of the weirdest and
heart-stopping meets according to
Templeton were those of 1913 and
1915.
The former was held at the Cal
track: a track which was laid out
on a curve surrounded by trees and
ran over a bridge which spanned a
brook. In this meet a prejudiced
California official nearly stole the
show from the Indians. A disputed
linish of the 220 caused the trouble.

When it comes to big point winners. Gay Bryan's 23 points in 1949 heads
the list. The jack-of-all-trades placed first in the 100, 220. low hurdles,
high jump, and Idst in his best event, the broadjump, despite a 24-1 effort.
The following year Bryan established the meet record at 25-2M>.
Jess Wtlis garnered 20 points in a winning cause in 1919, and Bob
Mathias was a lingering thorn in the Bear paw, causing the most con
sternation in 1952 by piling up 19 points.
Clyde Jeffery, Downing McKee, Lew Davis, Pete Zagar, Mint Howell,
Sam Klopstock, Swede Leisner, Biff Hoffman, these are only a few of the
BIG MEET greats. There are many, who even though they may have con
tributed no more than a fraction of a point, are heroes in every respect.
Because in the BIG MEET every point counts.
Stanford and California, schools with so-so track teams, collide tomorrow.
There'll be new names to add to the roll call of come-through performers.
