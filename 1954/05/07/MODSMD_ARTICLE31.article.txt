# MILE MARK
## Bannister Runs 3:59.4 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
It came as if out of the grey
and murky skies of the little
English town of Oxford. Here,
at exactly 4 p.m. GMT on the
sixts of May, 1954, a former Ox
ford student by Hie name of Rog
er Bannister finally exploded the
one unbreakable record of our
generation—"the mythical four
minute mile."
Bannister's time, convincingly
enough: three minutes, fifty - nine
and four-tenths seconds (3:59.4).
He ran laps of 57.7, C 0.6. 62.4,
58.7.
He was running for the British
Amateur Athletic Association
against his alma mater, Oxford, at
the historic Ifley Road Track.
As the news of Bannister's accom
plishment spread throughout the
world, it was met by a sigh of re
lief and satisfaction by the connois
seurs and coaches of the track and
field game and, naturally enough,
some disappointment on the part of
other aspirants, namely Kansas'
Wes Santee and Australia's John
Landy.
Stanford's Publicity Director Don
Liebendorfer said, "I'm glad they
finally got it out of the way. That's
all I've heard about in this office
this spring. I'm going out to have
a banana split."
Stanford Track Coach Jack
Weiershauser was also very pleased
as well as a bit surprised. "Frank
ly," he said, "I expected either Lan
dy or Santee to crack the record be
fore Bannister. Just goes to show
you how wrong 'we experts' can be."
The previous world mark for the
mile was set by Gundar Haegg of
Sweden in 1945 when he ran the dis
tance in 4:01.4. Landy has oft times
approached that record recently.
