# Spring Show Termed 'A Colossal Winner'
## 
### BOB REZAK 
Ram's Head has come up with a colossal winner in its 1954
version of the annual Spring Show, Cole Porter's "Anything
Goes."
The show opened a three-night run last night to a responsive
Memorial Auditorium audience that warmly greeted a new col-

lege star, Sylvia Haining, Ram's
Head discovery, wnose perform
ance- as uie saucy, pert Reno
Sweeney easily eamc out as the high
spot of the show.
The 18-ycar-old Rohlc fresh
man, in her first -big show, made
the rafters in Memorial Audito
rium shake, with her blaring rthel
Merman-like voice, and she made
the audience offer what was per
haps its biggest ovation.
Director Warner Leßoy might just
as well resolve himself to squeeze in
an encore on the "Blow, Gabriel,
Blow" production number which
highlighted Miss Haining and a cho
rus that was precision-like in its
performance. The number is a show
stopper if there ever was one.
Co-starring with Miss Haining is
Bill Burke, who plays Billy Crocker
in the musical comedy. Burke has
a big role that requires his presence
in the stage most of the time in a
number of dialogue and costume
changes.
Burke's smooth tenor voice comes
across the footlights in a pleasing
manner in such numbers as the bal
lad "All Through the Night" and the

"You're the Top" duet with Miss
Haining.
Much of the show's success cer
tainly can be attributed to a large
supporting cast of talented Ram's
Head members including lovely As
trid Willsrud, comical, whimsical
Dick Winter, and the sprightly hu
mor of James Barton.
It's not easy to single out the
"bests" in Ram's Head's revival of
the Porter show.
There's something in "Anything
Goes" to satisfy practically all tastes
—a .shapely line of glamorous cho
rines, a manly chorus of sailors,
stunning sets and lighting, and, of
course, the familiar Porter music
and lyrics.
"I Get a Kick Out of You," "You
Do Something to Me," and the title
song really, despite their age, sound
fresh and lively under Musical Di
rector Bill Scott's handling.
There are a few features in the
show that could stand a little more
polish and a few of the scenes could
be stepped up to a faster pace.
But these arc only minor buga
boos that arc bound to cree,) into
any show, especially on opening
night.
The musical, as a whole, is a big
undertaking for any theatrical
group, especially a college troupe.
The Stanford group, however, has
done itself proud.

There are a few features in the
show that could stand a little more
polish and a few of the scenes could
be stepped up to a faster pace.

The musical, as a whole, is a big
undertaking for any theatrical

The Stanford group, however, has
done itself proud.

Ram's Head has come up with a colossal winner in its 1954
version of the annual Spring Show, Cole Porter's "Anything
Goes."
The show opened a three-night run last night to a responsive
Memorial Auditorium audience that warmly greeted a new col-

lege star, Sylvia Haining, Ram's
Head discovery, wnose perform
ance- as uie saucy, pert Reno
Sweeney easily eamc out as the high
spot of the show.
The 18-ycar-old Rohlc fresh
man, in her first -big show, made
the rafters in Memorial Audito
rium shake, with her blaring rthel
Merman-like voice, and she made
the audience offer what was per
haps its biggest ovation.
Director Warner Leßoy might just
as well resolve himself to squeeze in
an encore on the "Blow, Gabriel,
Blow" production number which
highlighted Miss Haining and a cho
rus that was precision-like in its
performance. The number is a show
stopper if there ever was one.
Co-starring with Miss Haining is
Bill Burke, who plays Billy Crocker
in the musical comedy. Burke has
a big role that requires his presence
in the stage most of the time in a
number of dialogue and costume
changes.
Burke's smooth tenor voice comes
across the footlights in a pleasing
manner in such numbers as the bal
lad "All Through the Night" and the

"You're the Top" duet with Miss
Haining.
Much of the show's success cer
tainly can be attributed to a large
supporting cast of talented Ram's
Head members including lovely As
trid Willsrud, comical, whimsical
Dick Winter, and the sprightly hu
mor of James Barton.
It's not easy to single out the
"bests" in Ram's Head's revival of
the Porter show.
There's something in "Anything
Goes" to satisfy practically all tastes
—a .shapely line of glamorous cho
rines, a manly chorus of sailors,
stunning sets and lighting, and, of
course, the familiar Porter music
and lyrics.
"I Get a Kick Out of You," "You
Do Something to Me," and the title
song really, despite their age, sound
