# Cards Host Bears, Broncs; Tracksters Seek Cal Upset
## Page, Young To Take Hill 
### PETE GROTHE 
With everything to 'gain and
just as much to lose, Stanford's
varsity baseballers lock horns
with Santa Clara and Cal tomor
row in the local ball orchard.
Soph Ray Young, who was be
trayed by six errors committed by
his mates against Troy last week,
will fire the first pitch at 3:15 today.
Lefty Phil Page will toe the slab to
morrow at the same time.
The Indians, who dropped a cru
cial duet of contests to the now
leading Trojans, will present a
slightly amended lineup from the
one that faced the home audience in
the last league game against Cal.
Wing-footed Mickey Holzman, the
soph with the .478 batting average,
will open at third; Tom Dandurand,
who has been playing third, will
roam around the right field pas
tures; and tow-head AI Talboy, who
committed his third error in three
years last week, has been shipped
from right field to first.
Everett Dean's hoys have won
six and lost four, and the Trojans
have triumphed eight times in 12
trips out of the ham. So a Stan*-
ford twin - killing this weekend
would be more than just a nire
thing; it is a condition for sur
vival.
Ray Stanley, who handled the San
Francisco Seals for five innings, will
pitch for the Broncs today. He is
one-and-onc in CIBA competition.
Santa Clarans Bill Carrol and Dan
Modena are the ones to watch at
the plate. They are muscling the
hide at the .432 and .419 clips,- re
spectively.
Santa Clara is only one and a half
games behind the Indians. They are
saving their best chucker, Dick Si
moni (3-0) for the first half of the
Trojan twin bill tomorrow. That
could be significant.
Cal, which has lost more games
than McCarthy has raised points
of order, will save its onfyc qual
ity pitcher, Joe Gaggero, for Stan
ford. It faces USC today.
Clint Evans' men have dropped
six straight outings, and wallow in
the CIBA cellar. The Berkeley
squad, which succumbed to the
Cards 12 to 3 two weeks ago, drop
ped tv/o one-run decisions to UCLA
last weekend.
Stanford lineup: Len Swartz, c;
Ray Young, Phil Page, p; Al Talboy,
lb; Rich Scramaglia, 2b; Mickey
Holzman, 3b; Warren Goodrich
(captain), ss; Bob Evans, If; Sid
(Mickey Mouse) Hall, cf; Tom Dan
durand, rf.
