# Pennant Hopes Soar as Nine Shades Broncs, Cal
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's hopes for. a baseball pennant soared to Hoover
Tower heights last week end as Everett Dean's Indians flattened
Santa Clara, 4 to 3, and California, 5 to 3, in a pair of contests that
were closer than your next breath.
The Cards now have an 8-4 record in California Intercollegiate

Baseball Association play. The 4
bad guys from USC, who led the I
race going into the week end,
beat Cal but. split with the Broncos; |
this means that they have a 10-5 !
record which puts them in a per
centage tie with the kids from the
Farm.
However, Stan 112 or d leads the
Southern Division PCC (the league
within a league) by virtue of having I
lost only three PCC contests. The |
Trojans have succumbed five times. I
Actually, the winner of the South
ern Division is the one who takes
home the marbles, since he's the !
guy who meets the Northern Divi- I
sion PCC champ for the right to go j
to the nationals.

SATE OR OUT?—Stanford's Rich Scramaglia is called out as he tries to score the potential
tying run from third in a double steal attempt against Cal in the third inning Saturday. Bob
Albo, the Bear catcher, was forced to dig a low throw out of the dirt. Has he already made the
tag, or did he prevent Scramaglia's toe from moving the necessary inch to touch the plate, or
did the.ump miss one? The Cards won, anyway, 5-3. —Daily photo by Frank Huntress

When the dust had lifted the score
was 5 to 2, Gaggero was wincing in
mental pain, and Stanford had
sewed up the ball game.
On Friday, it was colorful Al-
Taihov who proved to he the man
of the hour. He singled twice in
: three attempts, baited in two runs.

Sharing the honors was lefty Phil
Page, who bore down when bearing
down meant victory.
