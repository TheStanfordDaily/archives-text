# LIBRARY SURVEYâ€”I
## Students, Faculty Charge Library With 'Inefficiency'; Director Describes Accomplishments, Limitations

(Editor's note: This is the first
in a series of five articles dealing
with .the organization and prob
lems of the Stanford Library.)

A Stanford graduate student,
lashing out at the recently
junked University policy which
held up student registration in
case of unadjusted Library de
linquencies, had this to say of
the Stanford Library's delin
quency system:
"The library, unfortunately, ad
ministers a poor system poorly."
A researcher, representative of a
small department, commenting on
the library's resources:
"The library has probably half or
a little more of the works we need."
A professor in a Inrge department,
speaking of use of library ma
terials for his classes, said:
"I'd like to see more copies of spe
cific books . . . but I get along all
right."
Commenting on the Reserved
Book Room, professors pointed out
the difficulty of Retting a book on
reserve. One noted that for large
classes, the library facilities and re
sources arc so limited as to force use
of a textbook to give all students an
equal chance.
An undergraduate, commenting on
library procedure, said,' 'I wish they
hadn't closed the stacks again. When
you can go down there and look for

your own hook, you've cot a chance
to find it., hut those pages just look
in one place, and if it isn't there,
they tell you it's lost before they
look any place else . .
What is wrong with the Stanford
Library?
In the Report of the Director of
University Libraries to the Presi
dent of the University for 1950-51,
Raynard C. Swank, Director of Li
braries, outlined the six areas of
activity which the Stanford Libra
ries consider most important:
"First, the Library should organ
ize and co-ordinate the selection of
books and other library resources
needed by the University. Second,
the collections, once acquired,
should be disposed about the cam
pus in a way that promotes educa
tional as well as administrative effi
ciency.
"Third, the collections should be
organized not only physically but
also bibliographically for eflective
use. Fourth, building facilities which
arc conveniently located and well
adapted to library purposes should
be obtained.
"Fifth, the professional library
staff, augmented by an efficient non
professional staff, should become
bibliographic specialists of high aca
demic caliber. . . .
"And last, the Library should fos
ter an informal and sympathetic re
lationship with the instructional de
partments, not only that it might
serve them better individually but


STANFORD LIBRARY
also that it might function in some j
measure as a unifying influence
within this community of scholars."
Members of the Library staff sum
marize those points in a sentence.
"We want to make our resources
here available for use by everyone
in the University" is the tenor of
comment one head's in every library
department. "We want to make our
resources available."
The scope of these library re
sources is indicated by the official
statistics for the year Sept. 1, 1952,
through Aug. 31, 1953. The Main
Library building houses approxi
mately 1,853,241 volumes, including
800,000 volumes on the 12 miles of
shelves in the main stacks and 944,-
630 uncatalogued documents.
All these resources are technically
available for use, subject to various
conditions.
The Library keeps statistics on
both attendance in the building and
circulation of the collections. The
attendance figures, based on obser
vations made hourly on the half
hour, show that as many as 715 per
sons have been in the library at one
time, the average for 1952-53 being
a little more than 138 per observa
tion.
And the Library circulated a total
of 456.999 volumes for that period,
including 306,267 from the loan desk
and more than one-third that many
in addition in the Reserved Book
Room. So the Library has resources
and the resources are used. One
faculty member said that "the li
brary really does quite reasonably
well, within the limitations imposed i
upon it." Is the library in fact doing |
quite reasonably well, and what arc |
the limitations imposed upon it? |
