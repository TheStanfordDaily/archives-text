(Editor's note: This is the first
in a series of five articles dealing
with .the organization and prob
lems of the Stanford Library.)

A Stanford graduate student,
lashing out at the recently
junked University policy which
held up student registration in
case of unadjusted Library de
linquencies, had this to say of
the Stanford Library's delin
quency system:
"The library, unfortunately, ad
ministers a poor system poorly."
A researcher, representative of a
small department, commenting on
the library's resources:
"The library has probably half or
a little more of the works we need."
A professor in a Inrge department,
speaking of use of library ma
terials for his classes, said:
"I'd like to see more copies of spe
cific books . . . but I get along all
right."
Commenting on the Reserved
Book Room, professors pointed out
the difficulty of Retting a book on
reserve. One noted that for large
classes, the library facilities and re
sources arc so limited as to force use
of a textbook to give all students an
equal chance.
An undergraduate, commenting on
library procedure, said,' 'I wish they
hadn't closed the stacks again. When
you can go down there and look for

your own hook, you've cot a chance
to find it., hut those pages just look
in one place, and if it isn't there,
they tell you it's lost before they
look any place else . .
What is wrong with the Stanford
Library?
In the Report of the Director of
University Libraries to the Presi
dent of the University for 1950-51,
Raynard C. Swank, Director of Li
braries, outlined the six areas of
activity which the Stanford Libra
ries consider most important:
"First, the Library should organ
ize and co-ordinate the selection of
books and other library resources
needed by the University. Second,
the collections, once acquired,
should be disposed about the cam
pus in a way that promotes educa
tional as well as administrative effi
ciency.
"Third, the collections should be
organized not only physically but
also bibliographically for eflective
use. Fourth, building facilities which
arc conveniently located and well
adapted to library purposes should
be obtained.
"Fifth, the professional library
staff, augmented by an efficient non
professional staff, should become
bibliographic specialists of high aca
demic caliber. . . .
"And last, the Library should fos
ter an informal and sympathetic re
lationship with the instructional de
partments, not only that it might
serve them better individually but
