"Have YOU helped the Con

ficially opens the annual drive
for Stanford Convalescent
Home.
Freshman women will sell the

On campus the tags will be sold

BAC, administration buildings, and
Encina and Village food lines.
The tags are decorated with a car

.Stanford students, both past and
present.
Tonight, a triple feature will be

Lace," starring Raymond Massey,
Peter Lorre, and Cary Grant, will be
presented.
The institution for which these
money-raising events are intended
is a unique one, being the only char
ity hospital located on a college
campus.
The Stanford Convalescent Home
was founded in 1917, as the "Campus
Auxiliary to the Stanford Clinic,"
and grew rapidly until today it cov
ers 27 acres and houses 80 children.
The young patients range in
from eight, months to 12 years. All
diseases, except contagious ones, ar-;
treated, but the most common ail
ments represented are polio, rheu
matic fever, and asthma.
For some of the children, who are
suffering from malnutrition, rickets,
and similar diseases, the medicine is
simply fresh air, good food, and rest.
Most of the children stay at the
Home an average of three months.
During this time, the older children
receive schooling, supervised by the
Palo Alto School Board. They may,
if they like, join a Cub,~ Brownie,
Girl Scout, or Boy Scout troop.
The Home is supported by Stan -
ford's annual Drive, voluntary con
tributions, an endowment fund, and
several organizations, among them
the Community Chest, Rotarians,
Elks, and Junior Auxiliaries.
