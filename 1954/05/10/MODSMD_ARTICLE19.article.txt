### BARNEY CHILDS 
Works by 20 student composers weire presented at the wock
end's three concerts of the 1954 Symposium on Student Compos
ers from Western Colleges, meeting this year at Stanford.
The general standard of performance of these works was im
pressively high, as was the overall craftsmanship shown, but the

problem facing most of tho com
posers seemed to ho tho search
for something to Sriy and a co
herent idiom in which to say it.
The best works did not share this
lack of scope and originality. UC
LA's William Malloch, in his "Three
Rhythmic Etudes," handles additive
rhythms and ostinati with freshness
and strength much nearer Ives than
Bartok or Stravinsky, and combines
them with a true and sometimes
moving lyricism of great clarity.
The violin arid clarinet duo of .Tack
Weeks (Cal) is full of ideas, vitality,
and drive, and the composer has a
gift, for realizing sonority as a work
ing part of his musical logic Rob
ert Tosh (Redlands) played his own
"Prelude and Fugue in F Minor'' on
the Memorial Church organ; the
composer's employment of the un
avoidable conventions of big organ
works was as a skillful means to
an end of considerable power and
depth.
Stanford graduate student .lon P.I -
kus' string quartet, given n rleft and
lively reading, is an immensely at
tractive piece. F.lkus brings to his
material a confident handling of in
strumentaton and sonority, a Rieg
ger-like gift for developing short,
incisive motives, lyricism with much
of the strength of Bloch and little
oi his introversion, and a of

the development of harmonic struc
ture in a diatonic framework that
made m'ost of the other composers'
efforts sound turgid and indecisive.
