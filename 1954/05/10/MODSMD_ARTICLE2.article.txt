### 
"Meeting the Challenge of Com
munism" will be the topic of an open
lecture to be delivered tonight by
Will Herberg, visiting author and
lecturer in social philosophy and
theology.
The talk will begin at 8 in Room
320 in Geology Corner.
"The immediate ch a I len g c of
Communism," said Herberg, "comes
to us as the challenge of an aggres
sive foreign imperialism intent on
dominating the world. But basically
the levels on which Communism
challenges us, and on which we
must answer the challenge, are the
economic, the political, the reli
gious."
Herberg recently completed a sc
ries of seminars on approaches to
religion, presenting the philosophi
cal-rational, the mystical, and ' the
Biblical-existential approaches.
