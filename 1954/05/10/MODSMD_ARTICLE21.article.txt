# Con Home—A Worthy Cause
## 
### 
Con Home Week starts today.
Every year we hold a Con Home Drive for
the kids over by San Francisquito Creek who
need the medical attention our donations of
time and money can supply.
But this year these five days should be
known as Sam's Week as well. For Sam Mc-
Donald, patron saint of the Con Home and em
ployee of Stanford for 51 years, will supervise
his last Con Home barbecue on Wednesday.
Sam is retiring as superintendent of athletic
buildings and grounds. Appropriately, his
autobiography, Sam MaDonald's Farm, will be
published today.
"Sam's kids" at the Con Home need $11 each
a day for food and medical care. We are re
sponsible for raising the money to help pay

for these needs during the next 12 months,
helping them to recover from polio, rheumatic
fever, or asthma so that some day they can con
tribute sound, healthy bodies and alert minds
to society.
And how shall we live up to these responsi
bilities? By rummaging through a purse or
pocket for a dime today, by trotting over to
Union Court for the Strawberry Brunch tomor
row, by going all-out Wednesday at the Home
for Work Day and the barbecue—in other
words, by giving -giving time and money so
that the Con Home children may receive the
necessary food and medical care.
Sam McDonald has given most of his life
to Stanford and the Con Home. Surely each
student can spare a few hours, a few dollars,
for a cause that is, above all, worthy.
