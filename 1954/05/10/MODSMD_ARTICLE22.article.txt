# 'Why?'s About the Library
## 
### 
This quarter the Stanford Library held up
registration for many students mistakenly
charged with library delinquencies. And the
students wondered, "Why?"
The first day of the quarter the Library an
nounced that it was closing the stacks again to
undergraduate students without special passes.
And again students wondered, "Why?"
During the past year we have heard many
other "Why?"s. Why are books stored all
over the University? Why can't we find the
books we need? Why must we wait so long
before getting books?

This quarter The Daily sent a reporter over
to the Library to talk with library employees
and library administrators to try to find out
"Why?" This morninq we will print the first
of five articles reportinq details of the Library's
orqanization, finances, and special problems.
The other four will follow this week.
We hope that answers for the "Why?"s will
open the door to some more questions. We sug
gest that two good questions might be: "How
can we improve our Library's service?" and
"When shall we begin a program to accom
plish that improvement?"
