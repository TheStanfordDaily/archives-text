## Boycott Wisconsin? 
### 
To the Editor:
According to recent polls, well over 50 per cent of
the people of this nation are opposed to Joseph Mc-
Caithy and his methods, and this percentage is stead
ily rising during the current hearing of the investi
gating committee. x
Many of those opposed to McCarthy have suggested
that ridicule would he the most effective weapon in
disposing of the Senator, but there is a method which
I believe would be more immediately and finally ef
fective. I would like to see the distribution through

out this country of a few million pledge cards which
would read something like this:
"I hereby pledge that I will purchase no products
of the State of Wisconsin, such as cheese, beer, and
manufactured items until such time as Joseph Mc-
Carthy 110 longer represents Wisconsin in the M.S.
Senate."
This method of disposing of Joe may seem to be
somewhat drastic, but I would be willing to wager that
as the result of such pressure McCarthy would be re
called within a period of three months.
