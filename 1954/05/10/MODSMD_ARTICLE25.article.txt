### HELEN DEWAR 
Sam McDonald's Farm, the au
tobioqraphy of the well-known,
beloved campus figure and his
half century of associations with
Stanford faculty, students and
friends, will be published today
by 'the Stanford University
Press.
Sam, a favorite figure in Stan
ford's memories and a prominent one
in the current Con Home Drive, will
retire from his job as Superintendent
of Buildings and Grounds after his
many years of service to his "Farm."
Sam's story begins with his birth
in Monroe, Louisiana, in ]904.
The family moved to California in
1890. While in Sacramento as a
young man, the "lure of the sea"
captured him and he spent many
happy days on the river steamboat
"Modoc" as a chore boy and galley
hand.
One spring, ranch life called him
and lie ended his sailing career to
try farm work. His first job was
with a farmer in Palo Alto; lie drove
horses at the Stanford University
stock farm and became part of the
local community. ,
During his 50 years devoted to
the University, he has seen the fu
neral of Jane Stanford, the great
earthquake, arid the effects on the
campus of two great wars and one
great depression.
His friendships have been count
less—students, coaches, players, phi
losophers, professors, politicians,
journalists, lawyers. His book con
tains letters from such men as Her
bert iHoover, Governor Goodwin
Knight, Ernie Nevers, and other
prominent public figures.
Even David Starr Jordan was his
friend and on one occasion gave Sam
the evolutionary derivation of the
minnows in the stream af Sam's La
Honda home.
His relations with students were
intimate also. Many came to Sam's
apartment over the track house at

Stanford to enjoy his hospitality, get
advice in financial predicaments, and
often enlist his aid as Cupid.
Publication of the autobiography
is keyed with the drive for the Con
Home, to which he is donating all
royalties from his book.
This year Sam retires from his
life of service to the University. At

seventy, as he puts it, hi.s "cup run- [
tieth over."


SAM McDONALD'S FARM—Sam McDonald, whose biography
rolls off the press today, plays with some of the Con Home chil
dren, to whom he devotes much of his time and attention.
