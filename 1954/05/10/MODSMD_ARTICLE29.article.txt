# Cardinals Succumb in Big Meet
## Cal 80-51 Victor; Long, Wood, Dozier Set Individual Marks 
### RUSS WILKS 
California's tracksters mustered more power than was expected
Saturday as they outdistanced Stanford 80-51 in the 59th BIG
MEET which saw three meet marks shattered.
Leo Long smashed Marty Biles' 1941 javelin mark of 222-11 as
he hurled the spear 223-1% to add his name to the list of record
holders. ♦

Long's feat was predicted, but
Gerry Wood came through with the !
unexpected performance of the day
in the high hurdles. The lanky sen- j
ior sailed over the barriers in 14.2 |
to clip a second off the old record
held jointly by Downing McKee and
Bob Mathias. iyicKee was the official
starter and sent Wood winging on
his way to glory.
Cal's Larry Anderson finally
found himself in the pole vault as he
soared to 14-4 to break Guinn
Smith's 1941 mark. Anderson's pre
vious best had been a 13-6 effort.
The Cal glory was a come-through j
story. Three of the Berkeley com- j
petitors, in addition to Anderson,
turned in personal bests.
Len Simpson led off the meet by
clocking a 4:14.7 mile to leave team
mate Frans Doelinan and Stanford's
Bob Reed far back.
Then Ron Bauer, laying out his
| two-mile chore perfectly, came from
| third in the fifth lap to move
out Reed for second and then over-

take the Cards' Chuck Strong on the
sixth leg and stave off a powerful
kick by the ladder to post a 9:53.3.
Cal's Ron Dozier was the third
personal record breaker as he led
the way in the low hurdles, gallop
ing home in 24.1 to defeat the Bears'
Jim Plessas and a game but hobbled
Jim Luttrell.
The visitors captured ten first
places, but Stanford came up with
some notable performances. There |
was Keith Brownsberger outlasting
Steve Turner in the 220; John Stew
art's 6-4 high jumping exhibition j
and the mile relay team's 25-yard \
victory as well as Wood's and Long's ;
triumphs.
But the Bears had the horses and
there was no denying the fact. Tur- ;
ner and Timmerman crowded Walt
Garrett out of contention in the 440 j
as Turner won. Timmerman was j
disqualified for his defensive work
and Garrett was given second after
actually finishing third.
Ed Wilson and Al Baeta fought off
Larry Spicer to finish 1-2 in the 880
and Herb Jackson eased out
Brownsberger in the 100.
In the track events Cal outscored
the Indians 33-22. Charles Butt up
set his shot putting partner John
Stellern as the former heaved the
iron ball 53-8% and the latter out
distanced 53-B'/2. Al Cheney took
third with the best put of his career,
a 52-2% effort.
Butt came right back to grab the
discus and become the only double
winner of the day. The visitors' Don
Mattson and Marshall Celestin fin
ished one - two ahead of Stanford's
Ed Fremouw in the broad jump as
22-9 took the event. The Indians
were counting on the versatile Roy
Smith, who had leaped around the
22-11 mark in two previous marks,
but Smith reinjured a leg while tak
ing a practice jump and couldn't
compete.
And so as it came down to the
relay the Cards were beaten as a
team, but not not as a quartet as
Spicer, Wood, George, and Garrett
churned out an easy win, 3:17.9, de
spite some poor baton passes.
This BIG MEET was not without
its surprises either. Last year a new
face, John McCurdy, came out of the
intramural ranks to place third in
the high jump, and Saturday foot
baller John Steinberg came out of
his fraternity house in an attempt to
bolster the high hurdle entries. The
pass - snagging end had the right
step, but finished fourth behind sea
soned veterans.
The fndians closed out the dual
meet season with a 2-4 record. Many
of the cindermen, however, will be
preparing for the series of invita
! tional meets coming up.
For Cal it was its 27th BIG MEET
; victory and the second in a row.

22-9 took the event. The Indians
were counting on the versatile Roy
Smith, who had leaped around the
22-11 mark in two previous marks,
but Smith reinjured a leg while tak
ing a practice jump and couldn't
compete.
And so as it came down to the
relay the Cards were beaten as a
team, but not not as a quartet as
Spicer, Wood, George, and Garrett
churned out an easy win, 3:17.9, de
spite some poor baton passes.
This BIG MEET was not without
its surprises either. Last year a new
face, John McCurdy, came out of the
intramural ranks to place third in
the high jump, and Saturday foot
baller John Steinberg came out of
his fraternity house in an attempt to
bolster the high hurdle entries. The
pass - snagging end had the right
step, but finished fourth behind sea
soned veterans.
The fndians closed out the dual
meet season with a 2-4 record. Many
of the cindermen, however, will be
preparing for the series of invita
! tional meets coming up.
For Cal it was its 27th BIG MEET
; victory and the second in a row.

LONG THROW—Leo Long is caught in the process of unwind
ing with the longest javelin throw ever recorded in Big Meet
history. The spear traveled 223 ft-l 3 /4 in. Long is currently the
nation's top spear thrower, and he has been improving his
marks from week to week. —Daily photo by Ken Jame£
California's tracksters mustered more power than was expected
Saturday as they outdistanced Stanford 80-51 in the 59th BIG
MEET which saw three meet marks shattered.
Leo Long smashed Marty Biles' 1941 javelin mark of 222-11 as
he hurled the spear 223-1% to add his name to the list of record
holders. ♦

Long's feat was predicted, but
Gerry Wood came through with the !
unexpected performance of the day
in the high hurdles. The lanky sen- j
ior sailed over the barriers in 14.2 |
to clip a second off the old record
held jointly by Downing McKee and
Bob Mathias. iyicKee was the official
starter and sent Wood winging on
his way to glory.
Cal's Larry Anderson finally
found himself in the pole vault as he
soared to 14-4 to break Guinn
Smith's 1941 mark. Anderson's pre
vious best had been a 13-6 effort.
The Cal glory was a come-through j
story. Three of the Berkeley com- j
petitors, in addition to Anderson,
turned in personal bests.
Len Simpson led off the meet by
clocking a 4:14.7 mile to leave team
mate Frans Doelinan and Stanford's
Bob Reed far back.
Then Ron Bauer, laying out his
| two-mile chore perfectly, came from
| third in the fifth lap to move
out Reed for second and then over-

take the Cards' Chuck Strong on the
sixth leg and stave off a powerful
kick by the ladder to post a 9:53.3.
Cal's Ron Dozier was the third
personal record breaker as he led
the way in the low hurdles, gallop
ing home in 24.1 to defeat the Bears'
Jim Plessas and a game but hobbled
Jim Luttrell.
The visitors captured ten first
places, but Stanford came up with
some notable performances. There |
was Keith Brownsberger outlasting
Steve Turner in the 220; John Stew
art's 6-4 high jumping exhibition j
and the mile relay team's 25-yard \
victory as well as Wood's and Long's ;
triumphs.
But the Bears had the horses and
there was no denying the fact. Tur- ;
ner and Timmerman crowded Walt
Garrett out of contention in the 440 j
as Turner won. Timmerman was j
disqualified for his defensive work
and Garrett was given second after
actually finishing third.
Ed Wilson and Al Baeta fought off
Larry Spicer to finish 1-2 in the 880
and Herb Jackson eased out
Brownsberger in the 100.
In the track events Cal outscored
the Indians 33-22. Charles Butt up
set his shot putting partner John
Stellern as the former heaved the
iron ball 53-8% and the latter out
distanced 53-B'/2. Al Cheney took
third with the best put of his career,
a 52-2% effort.
Butt came right back to grab the
discus and become the only double
winner of the day. The visitors' Don
Mattson and Marshall Celestin fin
ished one - two ahead of Stanford's
Ed Fremouw in the broad jump as
22-9 took the event. The Indians
were counting on the versatile Roy

LONG THROW—Leo Long is caught in the process of unwind
ing with the longest javelin throw ever recorded in Big Meet
history. The spear traveled 223 ft-l 3 /4 in. Long is currently the
nation's top spear thrower, and he has been improving his
marks from week to week. —Daily photo by Ken Jame£
California's tracksters mustered more power than was expected
Saturday as they outdistanced Stanford 80-51 in the 59th BIG
MEET which saw three meet marks shattered.
Leo Long smashed Marty Biles' 1941 javelin mark of 222-11 as
he hurled the spear 223-1% to add his name to the list of record
holders. ♦

Long's feat was predicted, but
Gerry Wood came through with the !
unexpected performance of the day
in the high hurdles. The lanky sen- j
ior sailed over the barriers in 14.2 |
to clip a second off the old record
held jointly by Downing McKee and
Bob Mathias. iyicKee was the official
starter and sent Wood winging on
his way to glory.
Cal's Larry Anderson finally
found himself in the pole vault as he
soared to 14-4 to break Guinn
Smith's 1941 mark. Anderson's pre
vious best had been a 13-6 effort.
The Cal glory was a come-through j
story. Three of the Berkeley com- j
petitors, in addition to Anderson,
turned in personal bests.
Len Simpson led off the meet by
clocking a 4:14.7 mile to leave team
mate Frans Doelinan and Stanford's
Bob Reed far back.
Then Ron Bauer, laying out his
| two-mile chore perfectly, came from
| third in the fifth lap to move
out Reed for second and then over-

take the Cards' Chuck Strong on the
sixth leg and stave off a powerful
kick by the ladder to post a 9:53.3.
Cal's Ron Dozier was the third
personal record breaker as he led
the way in the low hurdles, gallop
ing home in 24.1 to defeat the Bears'
Jim Plessas and a game but hobbled
Jim Luttrell.
The visitors captured ten first
places, but Stanford came up with
some notable performances. There |
was Keith Brownsberger outlasting
Steve Turner in the 220; John Stew
art's 6-4 high jumping exhibition j
and the mile relay team's 25-yard \
victory as well as Wood's and Long's ;
triumphs.
But the Bears had the horses and
there was no denying the fact. Tur- ;
ner and Timmerman crowded Walt
Garrett out of contention in the 440 j
as Turner won. Timmerman was j
disqualified for his defensive work
and Garrett was given second after
actually finishing third.
Ed Wilson and Al Baeta fought off
Larry Spicer to finish 1-2 in the 880
and Herb Jackson eased out
Brownsberger in the 100.
In the track events Cal outscored
the Indians 33-22. Charles Butt up
set his shot putting partner John
Stellern as the former heaved the
iron ball 53-8% and the latter out
distanced 53-B'/2. Al Cheney took
third with the best put of his career,
a 52-2% effort.
Butt came right back to grab the
discus and become the only double
winner of the day. The visitors' Don
Mattson and Marshall Celestin fin
ished one - two ahead of Stanford's
Ed Fremouw in the broad jump as
22-9 took the event. The Indians
were counting on the versatile Roy
Smith, who had leaped around the
22-11 mark in two previous marks,
but Smith reinjured a leg while tak
ing a practice jump and couldn't
compete.
And so as it came down to the
relay the Cards were beaten as a
team, but not not as a quartet as
Spicer, Wood, George, and Garrett
churned out an easy win, 3:17.9, de
spite some poor baton passes.
This BIG MEET was not without
its surprises either. Last year a new
face, John McCurdy, came out of the
intramural ranks to place third in
the high jump, and Saturday foot
baller John Steinberg came out of
his fraternity house in an attempt to
bolster the high hurdle entries. The
pass - snagging end had the right
step, but finished fourth behind sea
soned veterans.
The fndians closed out the dual
meet season with a 2-4 record. Many
of the cindermen, however, will be
preparing for the series of invita
! tional meets coming up.
For Cal it was its 27th BIG MEET
; victory and the second in a row.

distanced 53-B'/2. Al Cheney took
third with the best put of his career,
a 52-2% effort.
Butt came right back to grab the
discus and become the only double
winner of the day. The visitors' Don
Mattson and Marshall Celestin fin
ished one - two ahead of Stanford's
Ed Fremouw in the broad jump as
22-9 took the event. The Indians
were counting on the versatile Roy
Smith, who had leaped around the
22-11 mark in two previous marks,
but Smith reinjured a leg while tak
ing a practice jump and couldn't
compete.
And so as it came down to the
relay the Cards were beaten as a
team, but not not as a quartet as
Spicer, Wood, George, and Garrett
churned out an easy win, 3:17.9, de
spite some poor baton passes.
This BIG MEET was not without
its surprises either. Last year a new
face, John McCurdy, came out of the
intramural ranks to place third in
the high jump, and Saturday foot
baller John Steinberg came out of
his fraternity house in an attempt to
bolster the high hurdle entries. The
pass - snagging end had the right
step, but finished fourth behind sea
soned veterans.
The fndians closed out the dual
meet season with a 2-4 record. Many
of the cindermen, however, will be
preparing for the series of invita
! tional meets coming up.
For Cal it was its 27th BIG MEET
; victory and the second in a row.

HIS BEST MARK—Stanford's Bill
Flint is seen flying over the cross
bar at 1.1 feet, a mark which
equals his individual best. He was
second to Cal's Larry Anderson.—

marks from week to week. —Daily photo by Ken Jame£
