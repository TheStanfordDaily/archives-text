"Biblical faith is a faith to end all 'religions'," Will Herberg,
visiting philosopher-theologian, told an overflowing audience at
the Women's Clubhouse Friday afternoon.
His seminar, "The Biblical-Existentional Approach to Religion,"
concluded a series of talks on approaches to religion.

"To be human is to have a
god, an object of supreme loy
alty and devotion," stated Her
berg. "II man does not worship the
transcendent God," he continued,
quoting Dostoevsky, "he will wor
ship an idol made of wood, or of
gold, or of ideas."
The threefold consequence of
idolatrous faith, Herberg said, is de
lusion, because "one tends to distort
all the rest of reality to meet the
demands of his idol"; enslavement,
because the idol becomes one's mas
ter and drives him to destruction;
and an anti-equalitarian ethic, be
cause considered in merely human
terms men are always unequal.
The consequence of a Biblical or
God-centered faith is just the op
posite, Herberg said. It is realism,
for things are then seen in their
proper perspective with no partial
thing permitted to become absolute.
It is is liberation, he said, for man,
unhampered by total worldly com
mitments, is free for mastery of
things of the world. And it is an
equalitarian ethic, he continued, for
whatever their differences, all men
are alike in their relationship to
God.
"Between the idolatrous gods and
the 'God beyond,' man must choose,"
stated Herberg. "We are in a meas
ure free to choose," he said; "we are
not free not to choose."
"The 'essence' of God in Biblical
faith is His action in history," the
speaker said. # The answer to the
question of the "nature" of God is
revelation, which is carried forth
in the witness of the believing com
munity. This is the Biblical answer
to the questons raised by the exis

tential approach, he said.
The problem of "religion" dis
solves, he concluded. "The real
problem is seen to be that of recog
nizing God as Sovereign Lord and
doing His will."
