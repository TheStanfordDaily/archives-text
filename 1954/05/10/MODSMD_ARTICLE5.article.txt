HANOI, May 9 (UP) — Strong
Communist forces have captured
two French outposts in the Red
River Delta in the wake of their vic
tory at Dien Bien Phu and are ex
erting pressure at strategic points in
the rice-rich area.
The Communist rebels arc esti
mated to have 100,000 troops in the
delta area—the top strategic prize
of the war.
Red detachments swarmed over a
post only Iti miles southeast of Ha
noi which had been held by loyal
native troops.
A second outpost in the delta de
fenses near Phuly, 30 miles south of
here, fell to Red night attackers, the
French said. Blackclad night raid
ers also shot up a French stronghold
west of Phuly.
The new attacks may be the start
of a Red offensive against the delta
area and Hanoi itself. The French
high command today ordered a
tightening of the Red River area
defenses against an expected drive
by the powerful forces which over
whelmed Dien Bien Phu.
Meanwhile in Washington Senate
Democrats threw their criticism of
the administration's Indochina pol
icy into high gear today and de

ter informed on the critical military
situation in Southeast Asia.
