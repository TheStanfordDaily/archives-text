### DOROTHY CAMPBELL 
Both Joan Stctsen and Jess Thom
as gave outstanding performances
this weekend in the Music Depart
ment's performance of Henry Pur
cell's seventeenth century opera,
"Dido and Aeneas."
Thomas as the Trojan prince, Ae
neas, had excellent diction as well as
an unusually powerful and pleasing
voice. Miss Stetsen, who has been
heard in previous Stanford operas,
exhibited both a fine voice and ex
cellent acting .ability.
The chorus, composed of Stanford
students, deserves special recogni
tion. They managed to keep the
tragic mood of the opera throughout.
The accompaniment of strings, un
der the direction of Herbert B. Nan
ney, also gave a good performance.
Two highlights of the opera were
the performances of Putnam Al
drich, who appeared in a long white
wig to deliver the prologue, playing
the basso part on the harpsichord;
and Professor Harold C. Schmidt of
the Musi'c Department, who led sev
eral other sailors in a dancc, while
dressed in a striped sailor costume.
With more practice, the dancing
might have been a great deal more
professional. The dancers' perform
ance lacked polish. As a whole,
however, the opera was very enjoy
able.
