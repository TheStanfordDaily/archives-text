# GENEV A
## Smith Downs Red Demand 
### 
GENEVA, May 10 (UP)â€”U.S.
Undersecretary of State Walter
Bedell Smith today rejected a
demand put forward in a Com
munist Viet Minh peace plan
that the United States stop its
military aid to Indochina.
The Viet Minh Reds rejected a
French Indochina peace plan and
demanded the withdrawal of all
French troops and the end of Amer
ican military aid as their price for
peace.
The Red peace plan left little
doubt in Western diplomats' minds
that the Communists were bidding
for all of Indochina and not merely
a part of it as some Western sources
had felt. Smith accused the Reds of
not coming to Geneva to bargain
for peace.
Meanwhile in the United States,
President Eisenhower held an un
scheduled top-secret meeting with
his top diplomatic and military ad
visers late today, presumably on the
critical situation in Indochina and
Southeast Asia.
The White House meeting was
held as the Senate was caught up in
a sharp new partisan debate on In
dochina.
