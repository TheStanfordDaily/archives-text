Will Herberg, author and lec
turer in social philosophy and
religion, in an open lecture on
"Meeting the Challenge of Com
munism" last night defined
Communism as "the self-deifi
cation of collective man and the
total obliteration of individual,
existing man."
Americans for the first time in
their national existence, the speaker
said, know what it means to live in
insecurity and anxiety. Our entire
national life is deeply affected by
the challenge of Communsm, he
continued.
"Immediately, this c h a 1 1 e n g e
comes to us as the challenge of an
aggressive foreign imperialism in
tent on dominating the world," Her
berg declared. "But basically the
levels on which Communism chal
lenges us, and on which we must
answer the challenge, are the eco
nomic, the political, the religious."
On the economic level, the chal
lenge of "the bureaucratic state
collectivism of Communism" can
be met only by an open, dynamic
system with a built-in mechanism
of self-reform and self-improve
ment, Herberg stated.
But Communism is more than a
coilectivist economy, he said. '"Com
munism is a cause and a commit
ment, a total faith, a religion taking
hold of and controlling the entire
man.
"On this level, Communism can be
met adequately only in terms of a
faith that is more dynamic but also

more realistic, a faith that under
stands the possibilities and limita
tions of men in history, a faith that
is able to provide the spiritual re
sources by which men can live re
sponsibly in an age of insecurity and
crisis and yet preserve the vision of
a better world.
"This faith is the prophetic
faith at the heart of Judaism and
Christianity."
In the last analysis, the speaker
concluded, the struggle with Com
munism is a struggle of great spir
itual forces for the soul of contem
porary man. "It is this battle we
must win if our battle on any sector
of the front is to have any enduring
significance.
"Have we the vision and re
sources, the resources of faith and
spirit, to fight this battle?" Herberg
asked. "This is the great question
that confronts us as we gird to meet
the challenge of Communism."
