# LIBRARY SURVEY—II
## Subject-Division Is New System 
### R.G. MANSFIELD 
The organization of the Uni-;
versity Libraries is presently in
a state of transition between a j
functional type of organization
and the newer subject-divi
sional type of organization.
The subject-division organization,
represented in the University Libra- j
ries by Humanities and Reference,
Social Science, Biological Science,
and Science and Engineering agen
cies, will eventually replace the
functional Acquisition, Cataloging,
Circulation, and Special Collections
divisions although certain features
of the old system will be preserved
in the new.
Acquisitions and Cataloging, un
der the present arrangement, con
cern themselves with obtaining ma
terials and preparing them for the
collections, which are found in the
other six divisions. The Biological
Science Division, which is entirely
outside the Main Library building
and virtually independentf wiU not

be discussed here.
Every Stanford library book, |
whether bought, traded for, or re
ceived as h gift, is first handled
through the Library Acquisitions
Division. Chief Acquisitions Libra- I
rian W. B. Ready administers a divi
sion including the Order, Gifts and
Exchanges, and Binding and Receiv
ing departments.
The Acquisition Division is pri
marily responsible for developing
the University Libraries collec
tions. Ready, who terms . himself
"a man of business," Travels ex
tensively, contacting book sellers,
as well as administering such spe
cial Library activities as the Inter
mezzo series and the occasional
Library book sales.
Ready is proud of the fact that
! book sellers like to deal with Stan
! ford because "a book seller gets his
money from us within a week!"
Most Acquisitions paper work is
done in the Order Department,
| where faculty book orders are
checked against book funds granted
i the various academic departments
, and forms and files are made in sev

oral copies.
The Order Department, handles
accounting for all Library book
purchases, pays for all currently re
ceived serials, and orders and pays
the hills for Lane Medical Library in
San Francisco. Adding somewhat to
the amount of work done by the de
partment are regular faculty re
quests to order bonks for uses other
than in University libraries.
The Gift and Exchange Depart
ment arranges exchanges of Univer
sity publications, most of which are
made available by Stanford's Uni
versity Series of academic publica
tions, with olher institutions, and
checks and handles all gifts of
books. More and more the Library
finds itself compelled to check care
fully for duplication in gifts, since
book processing is an expensive op
| eration.
All library books and materials
and a good deal of literary material
: for other purposes is handled
| through the Receiving Room, where
minor mending and repairing of
worn hooks is also done.
Books received are processed

for (he collections in the Cata
loging Division, where an aver
age of five catalog are made
out for each book. Miss Alyce
Charlton, Chief Catalog Librarian,
estimates that about 100 hooks are
fully processed in a day, necessi
tating preparation of about 500
cards, half of which can he or
dered direct from the Library of
Congress.
"Our whole pu?*posc is to make
the books in the Library—more than
a million of them—as available as
possible," Miss Charlton says. Books
are assigned call numbers and
marked in the Cataloging Office.
Under the Cataloging Division is
the Serials Department, which runs
the Periodical Room and claims a
small portion of the main stack. The
Serials Department has about 65,000
titles and receives from 100 to 300
pieces of mail a day. One Serials
Department headache mentioned by
Serials Librarian Mrs. Madeline
Wilkinson was the amount of muti
lation of fragile unbound periodicals
by careless readers.
