# Israeli Asks End to Strife

### RUTH WOLPE 
"If there is one thing the Mid
dle East has had enough of, it
is bullets and bombs," said Is
raeli Ambassador Abba Eban
during his visit to campus Fri
day.
Eban and Harry Beilin, the Israeli
west coast consul, lunched with a
group of student leaders, faculty,
and administration. After a tour of
campus, Eban held a brief press con
ference and then spoke to a seminar
at Hoover Library on "Problems of
the Middle East."
"Problems," said Eban, "arc al
most the only unrationed commodity
in the country."
Israel's policy, he stated, is "to
become at peace with its neighboring
countries." He urged that the United
States use its influence to bring about
peace in the Middle East, peace based
on negotiation rather than the ex
isting border armisticcs which arc
creating tension, bitterness, and
further warfare.
Eban said that he was not aware
of any change of United States policy
in the Middle East since the change
of administrations. There is one "in
novation," though, that causes great
concern. This Ls the U.S. plan to send
arms to Iraq.
He urged that any program for the
dispatch of military material should
be delayed until there is more peace
in the Middle East. There is no guar
antee, he said, that the equipment
sent to Iraq will be used only to fight
the Communist threat in the north.
"Bullets cannot be earmarked," de
clared the ambassador.
Lsrael's relationship with the
United States is the chief founda
tion of its international relations,
said Eban. "Israel, like America," the
ambassador declared, "is devoted to
a constitutional government." This is
a bond which the "United States
shares with no other state in the
Middle East."
