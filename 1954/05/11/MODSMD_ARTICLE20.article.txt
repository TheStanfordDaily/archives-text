# Army Forms New Reserve Program

### 
WASHINGTON, May 10 (UP) —
The Army has drafted a two-part
program, including a modified uni
versal military training plan, to
strengthen its reserves and force
veterans to fulfill their reserve obli
gations, it was disclosed today.
Under the program, draftees com
pleting two years' service would be
required to serve two weeks of Na
tional Guard or reserve duty each
year. Another group of draftees
would take four months' basic train
ing and then serve in the organized
reserves almost eight years.
The second group probably would
be the biggest, at least at first, be- •
cause of current Army manpower
needs.
Selective Service would dccide
which draftees went into the now
four-month program and which
were tapped for regular two-year
Army hitches.
The program, which is expected to
go to Congress soon, is the result of
a Presidential directive ordering the
Defense Department to draw up a
blueprint for a drastic overhaul of
the nation's sagging military reserve
program.
