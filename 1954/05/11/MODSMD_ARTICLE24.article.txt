# The 						Rise and Decline of Stanford's Student Academic Freedom Program
## 
### PAT KING 
Academic freedom first became a topic of general
conversation at Stanford in Januaiy, 1953, when the
Velde committee announced it would investigate for
subversives in universities.
The Thursday Lunch Club of the YWCA discussed
the issue for several weeks. In April a group of inter
ested students who had participated in the Y luncheon
debates drew up a statement on academic freedom and
passed it among the student body for signatures.
The statement read in part:
"We object to any action by the national or state
governments which will limit academic freedom
and impoverish our education. Although we do not
challenge the legal right of Congress to investigate
in the universities, we protest the current investi
gations because they tan result only in harm to our
educational system."
At Excom's request, Sid Field and Barbara Tuerk
presented the petition to Excorn on May 13 in behalf
of the several students who had originated it. At that
time it had over 450 signatures.
Excom decided that it was not in a position to act at
that time since the statement did not represent the
opinion of the entire Stanford student body.
Excom member Charlotte Trego was appointed the
head of a special committee to "explore various meth
ods and approaches that might be used in presenting
the problem and ramifications of the questions of aca
demic freedom to Stanford students and faculty."
The following were appointed to the committee:
Jeanie Bobis, Diane Roark, Donna Gould, Dick
Miller, Al Ivey. Sid Field, Barbara Tuerk, Allan
Marer, and Alice Jo Kwong.
Excom later approved the appointments of Fran
Kirk and Judy Garland to the committee.
Members of the committee met several times with
President Sterling and his assistant, Frederic Glover,
to discuss the procedures that should be followed in
presenting the subject to the campus.
At these meetings two major points were stressed
by the administration. First, that any statement on
academic freedom must definitely be representa
tive of the entire Stanford student body.
Second, (hat the students administering the pro
gram constantly bear in mind the effect such a
statement would have on the University, and to use
great care and discretion in handling the subject.
The group also held open discussion periods before
the end of the quarter, but no further action was
taken.
Academic freedom continued to draw student inter
est during summer quarter. The summer Excom
sponsored a series of open discussions on academic
freedom, using the statement of the American Associ
ation of University Presidents as their basis and ref
erence point.
The academic freedom discussions culminated in a
rapid-fire debate on "Resolved: That legislative com
mittees should investigate Communist influence in
universities."
Students filled Cubberley Auditorium to hear four
well-known Bay Area speakers participate in the
debate.
A former Army lieutenant colonel who is currently
the advertising director of the California Farmer
magazine, Wheaton Brewer, created a sensation when
he claimed:
"I could quote from the faculty of this university
the names of many members whose motives are open
to question."
Brewer cited a report of the "Dilworth" committee
as the source of his information.
The statement brought immediate and sharp denial
from Stanford officials. One University spokesman
said:
"I am unaware of any committee called the Dil
worth committee. If the speaker was referring to

the Burns committee, of which Dihvorth is a mem
ber, the recent Burns report makes no such ref
erence to Stanford faculty members. The only ref
erence is a compliment to Stanford and all universi
ties of the state for their cooperation with the
committee."
Summer Excom concluded its activities with the
recommendation that the problem of drawing up a
statement on academic freedom be handled by the
regular Excom this fall.
At the Oct. 28 meeting of this year's Excom a three
man committee was appointed to study the situation
on academic freedom at that time and to report to
Excom with suggestions.
The three students- Dick Miller, Al lvey, and
Barbara Tuerk outlined the following program to
Excom on Nov. 4.
1. Set up speaking teams to attend living group
meetings to explain the pros and cons of issuing a
statement upholding academic freedom.
2. Debate the advisability of issuing a statement
at an all-campus meeting of the Political Union.
3. If students at that meeting indicate that they
favor issuing a statement, Excorn would appoint a
committee to frame the statement.
4. The final statement itself would then be submit
ted to student debate at a second all-campus meet
ing of the Political Union.
5. Students would then vote in a special referen
dum at the end of winter quarter on whether or not
to issue the specific statement.
Excom voted unanimously to adopt the plan which
would determine whether or not Stanford students
wanted to frame and issue a statement upholding
academic freedom.
The students who had drawn up the five-point
program again went to the President's office for sug
gestions and comments.
Bob Sprinkle, who had been appointed to the com
mittee from the Political Union, spoke to Frederic
Glover about the proposed plan.
At this meeting Glover listed several general rea
sons why the administration would prefer not to have
student discussion and debate on academic freedom.
1. The average Stanford student isn't particu
larly interested in academic freedom as an issue.
Just a few students on campus are making an issue
of it.
2. Any statement issued by Stanford students
might well do more harm than good, since outsiders
might misconstrue the statement which would re
sult in unfavorable publicity for the University.
3. Discussion groups can easily get out of hand.
He cited the example of the summer quarter de
bate.
4. Academic freedom is a complex subject with
many ramifications, and students aren't in a posi
tion to know or understand all these ramifications.
5. The administration itself has taken a lead in
a national scale in forwarding the cause of academic
freedom. Nobody's freedom is in danger at Stan
ford, and therefore there is no real need for stu
dents to turn it into an issue.
Alter discussing the matter with Glover further,
Sprinkle concurred with the above. The committee
agreed to drop further plans for academic freedom
discussions.
Academic freedom was mentioned again on Feb. 10,
when Excom met with President Sterling for an in
formal, off-the-cuff discussion.
At this meeting the President reiterated his previ
ous statements, saying generally that he did not op
pose student discussion on academic freedom or the
issuing of a statement, as long as the whole program
was handled intelligently and students realized the
complexity of the topic and the importance of their
actions.
