# NOT an 'Academic' Mailer
## 
### 
The above article answers a question that
should have been answered several months
ago:
"What happened to the academic freedom
discussion program?"
We have drawn heavily on Jime and the
opinions of many students in deciding to print
the facts of the rise and the disappearance of
that program.
We believe that we are obligated to print
those facts. On Nov. 6 of last fall quarter, The
Daily printed a story of Excom's decision to
initiate a five-point "Academic Freedom Pro
gram." The plan called for a discussion series
leading up to a referendum in which the stu
dents would decide whether or not ihey
wanted to issue a statement upholding aca
demic freedom.
The program was not held. No public ex
planation has been offered until now.
And we are not satisfied with th<? explanation
that has been offered.
We have reached these general conclusions
after considering the facts of the dumping of
the program:
The administration was wrong in discourag
ing the program.
The administration was unfair in allowing the
program to be conceived, planned, and an
nounced and then putting a wet blanket over
the whole thing.
The administration was inconsistent in origi
nally setting certain specifications for the pro
gram and then after those specifications were
met extending in diplomatic terms what
amounted to a "no."
We do not presume that there was any
mass frustration on the part of students when
the program was not carried out. We do not
presume that the program is an issue now.
But we are aware that there were several
hundred students who were sincere in the de
sire to frame a statement upholding academic

freedom. And we are aware that the students
who stood behind the program were sincere in
the desire to open that vital subject to discus
sion and education for all the students.
We do commend the administration of Stan
ford for taking the lead, on a national level, in
the formation of a statement .upholding aca
demic freedom. We do commend also the
spirit of Stanford's motto —"Let the winds of
freedom blow."
But we cannot help being critical when we
feel, as we do now, that the spirit of that motto
and the principles of academic freedom have
not been applied to the student population.
We believe that that population has as much
right to an intelligent expression of beliefs as
the faculty or administration.
We believe that that population is capable
of that intelligent expression.
And we believe thai that population cannot
be adequately prepared for active citizenship
unless its instincts to speak its beliefs are en
couraged now.
Instead, those instincts were discouraged by
an apparent skepticism on the part of the ad
ministration for the maturity and intelligence
of the students on "controversial" subjects.
We question that skepticism and its effect
on administrative policy toward student activ
ity. And we question the attitude that was ex
pressed by one University spokesman who, in
speaking about the student proposed academic
freedom program, said:
"Sometimes apathy is common sense."
We don't think the students were apathetic
toward the program— before it was discour
aged. We think that at the very least, the stu
dents should have had the opportunity to in
dicate whether or not they wanted to issue a
statement upholding academic freedom.
And we hope that in the future, the adminis
tration does not look upon freedom of expres
sion—for the students as an "academic" mat
ter.

unless its instincts to speak its beliefs are en
couraged now.
Instead, those instincts were discouraged by
an apparent skepticism on the part of the ad
ministration for the maturity and intelligence
of the students on "controversial" subjects.
We question that skepticism and its effect
on administrative policy toward student activ
ity. And we question the attitude that was ex
pressed by one University spokesman who, in
speaking about the student proposed academic
freedom program, said:
"Sometimes apathy is common sense."
We don't think the students were apathetic
toward the program— before it was discour
aged. We think that at the very least, the stu
dents should have had the opportunity to in
dicate whether or not they wanted to issue a
statement upholding academic freedom.
And we hope that in the future, the adminis
tration does not look upon freedom of expres
sion—for the students as an "academic" mat
ter.
The above article answers a question that
should have been answered several months
ago:
"What happened to the academic freedom
discussion program?"
We have drawn heavily on Jime and the
opinions of many students in deciding to print
the facts of the rise and the disappearance of
that program.
We believe that we are obligated to print
those facts. On Nov. 6 of last fall quarter, The
Daily printed a story of Excom's decision to
initiate a five-point "Academic Freedom Pro
gram." The plan called for a discussion series
leading up to a referendum in which the stu
dents would decide whether or not ihey
wanted to issue a statement upholding aca
demic freedom.
The program was not held. No public ex
planation has been offered until now.
And we are not satisfied with th<? explanation
that has been offered.
We have reached these general conclusions
after considering the facts of the dumping of
the program:
The administration was wrong in discourag
ing the program.
The administration was unfair in allowing the
program to be conceived, planned, and an
nounced and then putting a wet blanket over
the whole thing.
The administration was inconsistent in origi
nally setting certain specifications for the pro
gram and then after those specifications were
met extending in diplomatic terms what
amounted to a "no."
We do not presume that there was any
mass frustration on the part of students when
the program was not carried out. We do not
presume that the program is an issue now.
But we are aware that there were several
hundred students who were sincere in the de
sire to frame a statement upholding academic

freedom. And we are aware that the students
who stood behind the program were sincere in
the desire to open that vital subject to discus
sion and education for all the students.
We do commend the administration of Stan
ford for taking the lead, on a national level, in
the formation of a statement .upholding aca
demic freedom. We do commend also the
spirit of Stanford's motto —"Let the winds of
freedom blow."
But we cannot help being critical when we
feel, as we do now, that the spirit of that motto
and the principles of academic freedom have
not been applied to the student population.
We believe that that population has as much
right to an intelligent expression of beliefs as
the faculty or administration.
We believe that that population is capable
of that intelligent expression.
And we believe thai that population cannot
be adequately prepared for active citizenship
unless its instincts to speak its beliefs are en
couraged now.
Instead, those instincts were discouraged by
an apparent skepticism on the part of the ad
ministration for the maturity and intelligence
of the students on "controversial" subjects.
