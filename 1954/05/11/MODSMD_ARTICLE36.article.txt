# Stanford Crew Romps Over SC
## 
### BOB DURAND 
The never-say-die orphan oarsmen of Stanford got back on the
winning trail Saturday morning when they stroked to an open
water victory over USC at the San Pedro Yacht Harbor.
Leading all the way over the 2,000-meter distance, the Indian
shell crossed the finish line one and three quarters lengths in fron;

of their opponents in a time of 6:26.
The Trojans were clocked at 6:33.
In another race over the same
course, the Stanfords made it a clean
sweep when the junior varsity
whipped the SC second boat also
by a length and three-quarters. The
winning time was a slow 7:07.8.
Choppy water conditions didn't
hinder the Card sweepswingers as
they gained a four-foot lead com
ing out of the start and slowly
pulled ahead to almost a full length
advantage at the half-way point.
Rowing at a steady 31 until the
final 500 meters, Coach Harry Bu
chaIter's o a r s m e n were never
threatened and, upping their stroke
to a 38, won easily going away.
The race was a return match for
the two crews. The Trojans lost a
close one to the Indians on April 3
by a two-foot margin.
After having to stop one start be
! cause of a broken slide, the JV
I eights rowed almost neck and neck
i lor the first half until Card stroke
Bob Margolis raised the count from
S a 32 to a 34 and the Indians pulled
' away fast to also win going away.
Just short of the three-quarter
mark, an unsuspecting sailboat
j wandered into the path of the on
rushing shells but managed to use
j some fancy navigating to steer be
| tween them.
The next race for all the Indian
crews will be on the Oakland Estu
ary against the powerful California
j eights. The Bear varsity whipped
UCLA by five lengths on Saturday
at Oakland.

pulled ahead to almost a full length
advantage at the half-way point.
Rowing at a steady 31 until the
final 500 meters, Coach Harry Bu
chaIter's o a r s m e n were never
threatened and, upping their stroke
to a 38, won easily going away.
The race was a return match for
the two crews. The Trojans lost a
close one to the Indians on April 3
by a two-foot margin.
After having to stop one start be
! cause of a broken slide, the JV
I eights rowed almost neck and neck
i lor the first half until Card stroke
Bob Margolis raised the count from
S a 32 to a 34 and the Indians pulled
' away fast to also win going away.
Just short of the three-quarter
mark, an unsuspecting sailboat

rushing shells but managed to use

The next race for all the Indian
