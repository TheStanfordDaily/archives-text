# Football Coaches 'Pleased' With First Practice Week
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Stanford's football coaching staff, which recorded itself as quite
pleased" with spring drills thus far, sent 100 or more grid hope
fuls into the second week of training yesterday.
Missing was ace punter Dave Castellucci, who has dropped off
the team because he is going into medical school next year.

But Jack Gebert, the leading can
didate for Bob Garrett's quarterback
spot, was on hand for the first time.
Head mentor Chuck Taylor plans
j a steady diet of scrimmages for the
' footballers this week, starting to-
J morrow and winding up with a more
game-like scrum Saturday morning.
Taylor expressed his satisfaction
I with the first five sessions, including
j the first scrimmage Saturday morn
ing in which six touchdowns were
registered: "I was quite pleased

Paul Camera, Trosh fullback for
St. Ignatius, was the "leading scor
er" in the scrum Saturday with two !
tallies. He carried around end fbr
nine yards on one occasion and 10
on another.
Dorsey Atkinson of rugby fame
turned in the longest TD gallop with
a 61-yard end sweep. Fullback Mike
Anderson went five yards for one
marker, and little Ernie Dorn picked
up the first points of the session by
cracking over from the one.
As a contrast to last year's record,
only one touchdown came through
the air. End Jack Rannalls hauled
in a 13-yard pass from Brodie.
Frosh half Gordy Young was
credited with the longest gainer. He
went 65 yards before Dorn pulled
him down from behind.
Taylor couldn't be too definite in
singling out the individual perform
ances which impressed him because
movies were not taken during the
first week. But the camera will be
grinding from now on.
He did mention the fine backfield
! work of John Neff, Dorn, and Young.
Fullbacks Camera and Tom Jacobs
looked good as linebackers.

with the intensity of the practices
The boys had the desire to play ball;
they were tackling and blocking
pretty hard for a first scrimmage."
"However, there is room for a lot
of improvement," he added quickly.
"We will continue to experiment
with new ideas. We want to see
whether the boys can handle the in
novations we have in mind for next
year."
