SPRINGTIME IS SWINGTIME—Kenny, one of the runabouts,
enjoys his ride on a swing in the playground. The /unabouts
(patients not confined to bed rest) have regular play periods.
Their active life also includes schooling. As "extra-curricular
activities" they may join a Brownie, Cub, Girl Scout, or Boy
Scout troop.


WON'T YOU COME AGAIN SOON?—Three patients from the
Babcock Unit wave goodby to visitors. Patricia, Debby, and
Diane (left to right) are dressed in the usual summer Con Home
outfits—white playsuits with red piping. All the patients enjoy
the visits of Stanford students, and the usual farewell is an
earnest "Are you coming again soon?"


HllLO' DOWN THERE — High up in their treehouse, these runabouts, (left to right) Eioise,
Joanie, Kathy, Raymond, and Kenny, peer down at the world below. The treehouse is one of
the favorite play spots for the children. They stage plays, play house, and just sit and talk high
above the ground. Another favorite play spot is the doll house. In this house, evervthing is
scaled to a child's taste. The miniature books, electric lamp, fireplace, silverware, and china
ware add to the atmosphere of realism in the doll house.


GROTTO SCENE—Far below the earth, four Con Home run
abouts pose in their special play spot. Paula, Eloise, Joanie,
and Raymond (left to right) often come out to the grotto in nice
weather to play in the afternoon. The bed rest patients get to
enjoy the good weather too, when their beds are wheeled out
to the porches on warm afternoons.


HAPPY EATING Enjoying breakfast in the colorful dining room are Barbara, John (facing cam
era) and Mike and David (backs to camera). The cheerful murals on the walls are done by the
great Wolo, Swiss artist who launched his career with the assignment to decorate the walls
of the Stanford Convalescent Home. The murals show all different kinds of animals. They
have only two things in common—they are all happy, and they are all eating. Some of the
animals are injured (one of the giraffes sports a jaunty bandage).
