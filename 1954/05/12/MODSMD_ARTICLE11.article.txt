# ACADEMIC FREEDOM
## Controversy Delays Cal Program 
### 
An "Academic Freedom
Week" program scheduled to
begin at the University of Cali
fornia next week was postponed
abruptly late Monday night in
view of a campus controversy
centered around an address by
a professor who asserted that
Communists should be permit
ted to teach in American
schools.
Key figure in the controversy is
Joseph Tussman, assistant professor
of philosophy, whose remarks were
disclosed publicly Monday in the
Daily Californian, student newspa
per.
The paper carried excerpts taken
in shorthand who heard the profes
sor's speech April 7 on the impact
of investigating committees on edu
cational institutions. Tussman agreed
to publication of the cxcerpts.
Tussman was to have been one
of several speakers, including
Stanford student Steve Voyko
vich, on the week-long freedom
program.
Late Monday night the ASUC ex
ecutive committee postponed the
observance following a complaint by
Greg Englehard, ASUC director of
general activities, who said that in
his opinion the program was "not
well-rounded without a conserva
tive member speaking."
Last night, Phyllis Sosnick, co
chairman of the program, announced
that the observance will be held the
week of May 24-28 pending execu
tive committee approval Monday.
"Dr. Tussman is still under dis
cussion as a possible speaker on the
program despite the present contro
versy," Miss Sosnick told The Daily
last night.. She said hor committee
would not rule out Tussman on the
basis of his previous statements.
In a statement, issued yesterday,
UC Chancellor Clark Kerr "said that
Tussman's views "arc not shared by
the great majority of the UC fac
ulty, nor by me!"
But he added:
"Academic Freedom Week is a
student sponsored project and it is
up to the students to select, the
speakers within the provisions of
university regulations.
"I know of nothing in the regu
lations which would prevent the
students from inviting Professor
Tussman to speak on the subject
of academic freedom."
Kerr added that university facili
ties have always been available to
persons, including faculty members,
expressing a wide range of opinion
short of conspiracy except for par
tisan political or sectarian religious
views.
Dr. Kerr said he personally saw
no objection to inviting Tussman to
participate in "Academic Freedom
Week" "if the students so desire."
