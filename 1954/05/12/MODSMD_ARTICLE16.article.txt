# IF OPENLY CHALLENGED'
## Dulles Asks U.S.-Asia Pact To Fight Red Aggression 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 11 (UP)—Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles today called for creation of a Southeast Asia alliance bind
ing the United States and its allies to fight back if "openly chal
lenged" by the Communists.
Dulles told a news conference a commitment to fight is implicit

in the North Atlantic Treaty al
liance and that he would like to
see it written, into the proposed
10-nation Southeast Asia alliance.
"I believe that, the commitments
should be of such a character that
if they were openly challenged we
could be prepared to fight . . .
Dulles said.
In response to a question, Dulles
said that if the three Indochinesc
states were included in the alliancc,
it would be "appropriate to use force
to put down attacks such as are now
going on there."
It was the farthest Dulles has yet
gone publicly in spelling out what
might be involved in his call for
"united action" by free nations to
stem the tide of Communist con
quest in Southeast Asia. The Eisen
hower administration has no idea of
sending U.S. troops to Indochina
now.
Dulles also said he believes the
rest of Southeast Asia can be held
even if Indochina is lost to the Feds.
Dulles categorically rejected the
Indochina ceasefire proposal ad
vanced by the Communists at Ge
neva on grounds if would amount to
unconditional surrender by the free
nations.
