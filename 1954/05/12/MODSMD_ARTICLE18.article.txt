11)53-54. For Stanford, a year
of expanding land development
programs and increased income
from tuition anrl gifts. For Stan
ford, also, a year in which the
University must facc its third
straight budget deficit.
Why? Why should Stanford,
with a current endowment of
over $45 million and the largest
income in its history, he faced
with red balance statement*?
There are no simple answers to
the hows and whys of financing
a complex university. One brief
generalization may help clarify
the present situation.
Stanford is not unique in its
financial difficulties. Like all pri
vate universities, it has been
forced to face rising costs with a
relatively fixed income. Income
and necessary expenditures just
don't balance.
It costs more than $12 million
annually to operate Stanford —

three and a half times the figure
of 10 years ago. This money must
come from three sources—endow
ment., tuition, and gifts.
Last year expenditures exceed
ed income by $30.1.000, an amount
made up with money from a re
serve fund.
The original budget for 1953-54
estimated income' at $9,660,000
and expenditures at $10,443,000
for a net loss of $783,000. Univer
sity officials knew, however, that
this budgeted deficit would be
considerably reduced by the us
ual budget, savings.
What have Stanford officials
been doing to combat, this pattern
of deficit financing?
Quite a bit. Already the esti
mated deficit has been lowered to
$386,000, and the President's of
fice is sure this will be substan
tially reduced before the year
ends.
This decrease is due to larger
income from tuition and gifts
than originally anticipated and
from savings that have been
made on other expenses.
The largest single expenditure
is instruction and departmental

research, estimated at $4.5 mil
lion this year.
The rest of the budget roughly
calls for $3.3 million to organized
research, $613,000 to libraries,
$846,400 for operation and main
tenance, $773,000 to student aid
and admissions, and $354,000 for
administration expenses.
These figures were set as of
March 31, 1954, and are subject,
to monthly revision by the busi
ness office.
Tuition will supply pbout half
—or $4,715,000—0f Stanford's in
come this year. The second half
will be split between endowment
income and gifts.
What does this mean to the
Stanford student in terms of ed
ucation? It is easiest to say what
the present deficit does not mean.
It does not mean Stanford will
lower its admission standards to
increase enrollment. It docs not
mean Stanford will reduce the
size of the faculty, which is larger
than that actually needed.
The University is determined
to maintain the high caliber of
Stanford work, even if the bal
ance sheet shows red figures.

However, flic outlook for the
future, for tbc fiscal year 1954-55,
is much bettor. An estimated
deficit of $178,000 for next year
shows the University may al
ready bo over tbc bump iti this
"battlo of the budget." It. io quite
possible that Stanford will break
cvrn next year for the first time
in four years.
However, administration lead
ers are quick to point, out,
"breaking even" doesn't mean
tbat financial troubles are ovrr.
For every item placed on the
budget, there is another one left
off because money simply isn't
available.
"Breaking even" merely means
the University is able to pay for
the vitally essential expenses of
operation. It does not mean Stan
ford has all the dormitories,
books, classrooms, and research
equipment it would like, or that,
faculty salaries are even barely
adequate.
This, tben, is the picture now,
in the midst of what an adminis
trator has called one of the "fi
nancially tightest two years in
the University's history."
