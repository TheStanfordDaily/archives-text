GENEVA, May 11 (UP) —Soviet Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov
said today the United Nations could play no part in the unification
of Korea because it had disqualified itself to act as an impartial
body.
.All U.S. forces must leave Korea before elections! can be held

there, Molotov told the 19 dele
gations to the Korean peace con
ference.
He couplcd a two-hour attack on
the United States and the United
Nations with a warning that no
defensive alliance in the Pacific
could stem the Communist tide.
In efTect Molotov doomed the Ko
rean part of the Far East confer
ence here with his outright rejection
of a Western demand for interna
tionally supervised elections in
North Korea.
"The United Nations Organization
has deprived itself of the capacity to
act as an impartial international
body, and can no longer carry out
objective functions in the settlement
« of the Korean problem," he said.
And in evident reference to the
American proposal for an alliance
to check the Communists in South-
Cast Asia, Molotov said:
"It is time to understand that no
policy based on the position of
strength can turn back the wheel of
history."
He offered no new proposals. His
speech was along the sfime lines as
his unyielding declarations on 'Ger
many at the Big Four conference in
Berlin early this year.
