## The
						Tragedy of Dien Bien Phu 
### 
On Fxiday night, the diplomats of the Big
Four and Red China were meeUng in Geneva.
In Washington, McCarthy and Stevens were
undoubtedly tossing in their beds trying to
think up new charges to hurl at each other.
Stanford students were studying or watching
the spring show or playing the eternal games
of bull sessions in the dorms or beer time at
Rudy's.
On Friday night, Dien Bien Phu fell.
Strategically, that fortress was a relatively
insignificant plot of ground in the overall bat
ile for Indochina. Psychologically, politically,
and rnilitaiily though, it had assumed propor
tions of major importance in the struggle be
tween the French and the Viet Minh Commu
nists. Its fall greatly depleted the strength and
morale of the French troops in Indochina. Its
fall set off a strong criticism of the French gov
ernment by its own people. Its fall guivered

the tirm chin of lohn Foster Dulles and seri
ously affected the relative bargaining powers
of East and West at Geneva.
But right now we are not concerned with the
political, psychological, and military implica
tions of this event. For once, we are not going
to try to advise the statesmen, win the war, or
bring the peace wilh our inexperienced com
ments.
We will only express our sorrow at the trag
edy of Dien Bien Phu. Many hundreds of
Frenchmen died there. They died in a battle
that would inevitably be lost. They died fighting
for a fortress thai was not particularly important
strategically. And they died for a cause, the
defense of Indochina, that has not been shared
with any great enthusiasm by the West.
It is difficult to justify the tragedy of their
deaths.
