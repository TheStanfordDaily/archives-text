### PETE GROTHE 
Sam McDonald, a man with a Lincolnesque posture
and an Uncle Remus capacity for story telling, leans
back in his squeaky swivel chair and says:
"Just because I'm retiring after 51 years at Stan
ford, that doesn't mean I'm going to rest. Man, my
troubles are just beginning. There's so much unfin-

ished business I've got to attend
to. Yessir, Old Sam's got more
to do than ever before."
And then Sam, who is wear
ing high black shoes, tan slacks,
and an old tail sports coat, throws
his feet on his battered brown
desk and starts to list the "un
finished business."
"Yessir," he chuckles, "I've got
to write another book to finish
what I didn't say in the first.

That'll only take me a year. The other book took
five years. Then, I've got to do something with my
400 acres up at La Honda that will benefit Stanford
people and the Convalescent Home. Any plots that
1 sell, I'll give the money to the Home.
"Also, I've got to help my friends. A lot of thein
want ine to cook barbecues for them, and I want to
aid the Con Home. Also, there are quite a few peo
ple who want me to help them make their tracks."
Coach Jack Weiershauser had something to say
about Sam's ability to make a racing track:
"Sam's one of the best in the country at that.
There isn't a track in the Bay Area that Sam hasn't
given advice on. And he won't take a penny for his
help. When he laid out Angell Field, lie personally
put by hand two inches of tanbark on the whole track.
He wanted to do it all so that it would be even."
Retiring basketball coach Bob Burnett threw in a
word about the lanky superintendent ol' buildings and
grounds:
"Sam has always been a great educator, although

he never went past the seventh grade. What I'm try
ing to say is that although he had no formal educa
tion, he typifies everything' we try to teach in the
classroom. Ho is a real example."
Athletic Director Al Masters chimed in, "He's
really a self-educated man. He went to night law
school, did a lot of reading, and the students used to
help him out. We're going to miss Sain around here.
He's been a real friend."
Masters called McDonald on the phone and said,
"The staft is having a dinner for you pretty soon,
and it's a command performance . . . you have to
be there!"
"Land sakes," protested Sam, "you don't want to
do that."
Sam puts his chin in one of his large hands and
reminisces.
"You know, it's funny how I get into all these
things. I call it suggestive and psycho-therapeutics.
What I mean to say is that I accomplish things that
I don't feel qualified to do, just because friends tell
me I can do it.
"Take, for example, writing this book. Now, I'm
no author. But folks told me I could write, and
that's just what I did. Same way with laying out
tracks and cooking barbecues. I didn't know much
about either, but my Stanford friends told me I could
do it, and I responded. Just the other day, Chuck
Taylor described me as an 'author and lecturer.'
Now, before you know it, I'll be a lecturer."
Seventy-year-old Sam, the first person the alumni
seek when they return to the Farm, breaks oil' into
melodious laughter.
And then the man who is as much an institution
at Stanford as the Big Game and the Spring Sing,
finishes, "Yessir, they'll be seeing a lot of me around
Stanford. I've got no place to hide. And there'll be
no rest for old Sam. I've got a lot of friends that
need help."

troubles are just beginning. There's so much unfin-

ished business I've got to attend
to. Yessir, Old Sam's got more
to do than ever before."
And then Sam, who is wear
ing high black shoes, tan slacks,
and an old tail sports coat, throws
his feet on his battered brown
desk and starts to list the "un
finished business."
"Yessir," he chuckles, "I've got
to write another book to finish
what I didn't say in the first.

That'll only take me a year. The other book took
five years. Then, I've got to do something with my
400 acres up at La Honda that will benefit Stanford
people and the Convalescent Home. Any plots that
1 sell, I'll give the money to the Home.
"Also, I've got to help my friends. A lot of thein
want ine to cook barbecues for them, and I want to
aid the Con Home. Also, there are quite a few peo
ple who want me to help them make their tracks."
Coach Jack Weiershauser had something to say
about Sam's ability to make a racing track:
"Sam's one of the best in the country at that.
There isn't a track in the Bay Area that Sam hasn't
given advice on. And he won't take a penny for his
help. When he laid out Angell Field, lie personally
put by hand two inches of tanbark on the whole track.
He wanted to do it all so that it would be even."
Retiring basketball coach Bob Burnett threw in a
word about the lanky superintendent ol' buildings and
grounds:
"Sam has always been a great educator, although

he never went past the seventh grade. What I'm try
ing to say is that although he had no formal educa
tion, he typifies everything' we try to teach in the
classroom. Ho is a real example."
Athletic Director Al Masters chimed in, "He's
really a self-educated man. He went to night law
school, did a lot of reading, and the students used to
help him out. We're going to miss Sain around here.
He's been a real friend."
Masters called McDonald on the phone and said,
"The staft is having a dinner for you pretty soon,
and it's a command performance . . . you have to
be there!"
"Land sakes," protested Sam, "you don't want to
do that."
Sam puts his chin in one of his large hands and
reminisces.
"You know, it's funny how I get into all these
things. I call it suggestive and psycho-therapeutics.
What I mean to say is that I accomplish things that
I don't feel qualified to do, just because friends tell
me I can do it.
"Take, for example, writing this book. Now, I'm
no author. But folks told me I could write, and
that's just what I did. Same way with laying out
tracks and cooking barbecues. I didn't know much
about either, but my Stanford friends told me I could
do it, and I responded. Just the other day, Chuck
Taylor described me as an 'author and lecturer.'
Now, before you know it, I'll be a lecturer."
Seventy-year-old Sam, the first person the alumni
seek when they return to the Farm, breaks oil' into
melodious laughter.
And then the man who is as much an institution
at Stanford as the Big Game and the Spring Sing,
finishes, "Yessir, they'll be seeing a lot of me around
Stanford. I've got no place to hide. And there'll be
no rest for old Sam. I've got a lot of friends that
need help."

Sam McDonald, a man with a Lincolnesque posture
and an Uncle Remus capacity for story telling, leans
back in his squeaky swivel chair and says:
"Just because I'm retiring after 51 years at Stan
ford, that doesn't mean I'm going to rest. Man, my
troubles are just beginning. There's so much unfin-

ished business I've got to attend
to. Yessir, Old Sam's got more
to do than ever before."
