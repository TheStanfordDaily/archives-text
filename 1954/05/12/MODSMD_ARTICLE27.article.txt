# CAMPUS OPINION
## Rides lo the Village 
### 
To the Editor:
While the matter of transportation is bf little con
cern to the student body members who live on cam
pus, the problem is a real one to those who live in
Stanford Village. The Villagers without cars depend
on the generosity of car owners for their transpor
tation to and from the campus.
Lately, it has become extremely difficult to ob
tain rides. Villagers stand at the Village stop for its
long as forty minutes before obtaining a ride.
There is no excuse for a driver to go to the campus
witli an empty car when half a dozen Villagers are
waiting for a ride. A driver loses very little time

when he stops to pick up passengers. Those who do
ride do not expect the driver to deliver them at the
exact spot of their destination. In addition, passen
gers yhould be careful not to do any damage to the
car in which they are riding. The passenger is obli
gated to be considerate of the property of the driver
who has been kind enough to offer him transportation.
It has been suggested that those who wait at the
Palo Alto-Village stop on campus, stand at the desig
nated areas for their destination. Thi3 will greatly
facilitate transportation from the campus to the Vil
lage or to Palo Alto.
