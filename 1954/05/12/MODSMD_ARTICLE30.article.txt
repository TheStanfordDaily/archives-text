# LIBRARY SURVEY—III
## Five Divisions in Libe 
### R. G. MANSFIELD 
Five University Libraries divi
sions contain all Library collec
aons which center in the Main
Libraiy building, with the ex
ceptions of the Library Serials
holdings in the Catalog Division.
Largest by far of the cataloged
collections in the Library is the
805,000-volume reservoir held in the
main stack and in the Reserved
Book Room under the Library's
Circulation Division.
Ivan H. Johnson is Chief Circula
tion Librarian and personally over
sees the 12 miles of shelves in the
main stack, which houses 800,000
volumes. Under him work thie bulk
of the Library's part - time student
employees, who act as pages and
desk attendants at the Loan Desk.
Johnson's division has been the
center of much student and faculty
complete about the library. He
points out that the stacks as they
are now provide insufficient space
for the collections and even com
pletion of the heretofore unfinished
sixth and seventh levels would only
help for about five years.
About 20,000 rarely used volumes
from the main stacks are now
housed in the "Annex" next to the
Law School lounge on Outer Quad,
and the Library guarantees 24-hour
service on these hooks.
What Libraries Director R. C.
Swank described as--a shortage of
filnds, help, and space caused a se
vere mixup in the Circualtion Di
vision stacks this winter. On April
22 personnel from ail Library de
partments began an emergency
reading of the shelves to attempt to
alleviate the condition. Library of
ficials attribute much of the recent
library delinquency confusion to
this snarl and general rush for time.
The Reserved Book oßom holds j
about 5,000 volumes; Johnson points !
out that reserving of books for J
classes is sometimes made difficult
when incomplete or late book lists
are submitted.
Jeannette M. Hitchcock is Chief
of the Division of Special Collections
and Keeper of Rare Books. She ad- !
ministers the Bender (Rare Book) !
Room on the Main Library's third ;
floor and services books, for use in
the Bender Room only, from several
special collections which occupy
rooms on the second and third floors
of the Library and part of the fifth
and sixth stack levels.
The Reference and Humanities
Division collection, slightly more
than 35,000 volumes, is centered in
the Main Reading Room of the Li
brary. The Division includes the
Stanford Collection, the Drama Col
lection. the Art Collection, and also
incorporates the Music and German
Department libraries. Some drama
| volumes are also held in the Spe
cial Collections Division.
Joseph Belloli, Chief Reference
and Humanities Librarian, points
out that the Reference Division is a
key point in any library. He indi
cates the value of the reference bib
liographies, since "the card catalog
cannot be a key to all the Univer
sity's collections."
Belloli also noted that "people
who come down from Cal and else
where and see how much time we
have to spend with students are
amazed. Central task of the refer
ence division is assisting students in
use of library materials.
Associate Director of University
Libraries E. M. Grieder heads the
Social Science Division, which he
calls "purely an administrative con
venience." The Division organizes

Document, Education, Journalism,
and Political Science (West Memo
rial) libraries for administrative
purposes.
The Document Library holds
about i; 50,000 uncataloged docu
ments from all federal, state, and
local governments in this country
and from most foreign governments.
As a Depository Library for United
States federal documents, the Docu
ment Library is legally bound to
.-.erve anyone, whether or not affil
iated with the University, who

wishes to use the collection.
Gilbert L. Campbell is Chief Sci
ence and Engineering Librarian for
the University Libraries and as such
heads the system of departmental
libraries in all campus science, re
search, and engineering depart
ments. In the Main Library itself
the Engineering Library holds 35,000
and has worked out a system of its
own for dealing with library delin
quencies, posting lists of offenders.
The Engineering Library circulates
about 300 volumes a week.

The Reference and Humanities
Division collection, slightly more
than 35,000 volumes, is centered in
the Main Reading Room of the Li

Stanford Collection, the Drama Col

incorporates the Music and German
Department libraries. Some drama

Joseph Belloli, Chief Reference
and Humanities Librarian, points
out that the Reference Division is a
key point in any library. He indi
cates the value of the reference bib
liographies, since "the card catalog
cannot be a key to all the Univer
sity's collections."
Belloli also noted that "people
who come down from Cal and else
where and see how much time we
have to spend with students are
amazed. Central task of the refer
ence division is assisting students in
use of library materials.
Associate Director of University
Libraries E. M. Grieder heads the

Document, Education, Journalism,

purposes.
The Document Library holds
about i; 50,000 uncataloged docu
ments from all federal, state, and
local governments in this country
and from most foreign governments.
As a Depository Library for United

Ivan H. Johnson is Chief Circula

main stack, which houses 800,000
volumes. Under him work thie bulk
of the Library's part - time student
employees, who act as pages and
desk attendants at the Loan Desk.
Johnson's division has been the
center of much student and faculty
complete about the library. He
points out that the stacks as they
are now provide insufficient space
for the collections and even com
pletion of the heretofore unfinished
sixth and seventh levels would only
help for about five years.
About 20,000 rarely used volumes
from the main stacks are now
housed in the "Annex" next to the
Law School lounge on Outer Quad,
