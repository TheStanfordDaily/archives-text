# Cards Stay in Batting Slump But Down S.F. State, 4-2, Anyway; Goodrich Hurt
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
Although outhit by San Fran
cisco Slate, the Stanford Indians
racked up a 4-2 victory over the
Gators yesterday on the Sunken
Diamond. The Cards remained
in their batting slump and could
only manage three measly sin
gles off three Gator pitchers.
More important than the game,
however, was the news that Warren
Goodrich, varsity shortstop and
team captain, cut his hand on a
chipped coffee cup which was
thrown to him by a fraternity broth
er. The wound«was a deep one and
required two stitches to close.
"Goody" is a doubtful starter
against UCLA on Friday but may
return for the doubleheader with
Cal on Saturday.
Stanlord scored first in the fourth
inning. Tom Dandurand and A 1
Talboy led oil' with walks off Clint
Lee, S.F. State hurler. Len Swartz
sacrificed the runners along, and
George Selleck scored both runners
with his second single of the day.
Hon Wanner struck out but Don

DeLong worked Lee for a free pass
and Ralph Cassady was safe on an
error at short to load the bases.
With Rich Scramaglia at bat, a
pitch got away from Sal Lenci and

Selleck headed for the plate. Lenci
retrieved the ball and threw to Lee
covering home, but Selleck's vigor
ous : lide upset Lee and he dropped
the ball.
The Cards pushed across an in
urance run in the seventh as Rich
Scramaglia led off with the third
Indian hit, a single to left field.
Mike Acker, who started the game
in left field, batting in Goodrich's
number three spot, sacrificed down
the third base line. Scramaglia
rounded second and kept running
when the Gator third sacker neg
lected to cover the bag.
Tom Dandurand's fiy to left drove
in the last counter as "Scrag" tagged
up and scored after the catch.
San Francisco finally scored in the
eighth off Mike Acker.
Stanford presented a mixed line
up of varsity and Brave players.
Ralph Cassady, George Selleck, Ron
Wagner, Dick Workman, Bob Fish
er. Clarke Nelson, and Gordy Gallo
way were Brave starters who saw
action.
Don DeLong, who pitched the first
five heats, looked good as he struck
out three nnd gave up only two
cheap hits. He was never in serious
trouble and will probably pitch the
it cond game of the Cal double
header.

Although outhit by San Fran
cisco Slate, the Stanford Indians
racked up a 4-2 victory over the
Gators yesterday on the Sunken
Diamond. The Cards remained
in their batting slump and could
only manage three measly sin
gles off three Gator pitchers.
More important than the game,
however, was the news that Warren
Goodrich, varsity shortstop and
team captain, cut his hand on a
chipped coffee cup which was
thrown to him by a fraternity broth
er. The wound«was a deep one and
required two stitches to close.
"Goody" is a doubtful starter
against UCLA on Friday but may
return for the doubleheader with
Cal on Saturday.
