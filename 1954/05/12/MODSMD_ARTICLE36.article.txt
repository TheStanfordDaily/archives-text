# STANFORD
## SPORTSCOPE 
### Bob Durand 
Harry Buchalter's Stanford oarsmen are certainly in line lor a nomi
| nation to the "Hard Luck Club." Because crew is not sponsored by the |
University, the biggest problem faced by the sweepswingers is the raising I
ol substantial funds to carry on the sport.
i As a result, the publicity chairman and junior varsity coxswain, Rowd J
I Davis, set about on a campaign to attract as much attention to crew as pos
sible in order to draw any contributions to help the financial situation.
Alter strutting for three weeks to get the "promising Indian oarsmen" j
j mentioned somewhere else besides The Daily, success came. Not only
! were the orphans written up in the San Francisco and Los Angeles papers, j
but articles appeared in the New York Times and Time magazine!
However, there was something wrong—the occasion was the sur
prising and shameful Hi-length defeat hy UCLA at San Pedro. This
wasn't exactly the kind of publicity that coach Burhalter and his hoys
were hoping for. What can you do?
In line with the rkce against the Bruins, it should be noted that the
J shell which represented Stanford was made up of the fellows who pres
ently compose the junior varsity boat. Also, it should be realized that
the same USC boat which was beaten by the Card varsity this last week
end swamped the UCLA first eight by two lengths over the same course.

The JV oarsmen in Saturday's j
Stanford-USC encounter had their {
share of troubles to put up with, j
After a good start and with both j
eights running neck and neck near- j
ing the 1,000-meter point, the cry of
"Let 'er run!'" went up. It seems that |
one of the Trojans had broken both
his slide and his outrigger. Both
crews had to return to the boathouse I
and await the completion of the var- [
sity race so that a good shell could i
be used.
When finally the duel got under
way again, the two boats got as far i
as the three-quarter marker when a j
beautiful 40-foot sailboat was seen j
ivandering directly into the path ol
the racers. Through some miraculous !
act of navigation or something, the j
powerless craft managed to squeeze
between the two shells. Needless to j
say both crews were relieved when
they crossed the finish line.

The frosh sweepswlngers, coachcd this year by Phi Delt Frank Jameson,
seem to have a whole boatload of potential oarsmen for the future varsities. ;
The yearlings hold a win over the Indian and Trojan JV's and a loss to the '
Bruin cubs.
However, they are looking forward to a win over California's frosh boat
at Oakland on May 22. If such is the case, they might very well become
the first freshmen to travel east for the Syracuse Regatta on June 17.
Speaking of regattas, the world's championship crew, N;ivy, which hasn't j
lost a race in many moons, has accepted an invitation to compete in the
annual Newport Regatta which will be held on May 29 at the famous
Southland resort .spot. Also competing for the Helm's Perpetual Trophy '
will be Stanford, University of British Columbia, Oregon State, UCLA,
USC. Orange Coast College, and California, which has won the award for
the last three years. This annual classic has gone a long way toward in- !
creasing the popularity of crew on the Pacific Coast. Reports have it that
grandstand seats and moorings for spectator boats for the classic are al- ;
ready sold out.

This coming Saturday at 2 p.m., the varsity mermen compete in their
final dual meet of the season against California. Unless something goes
drastically wrong, Tom Haynie's men shouldn't encounter any trouble
in winning their 20.th straight Big Swim. The two teams met earlier this
year, with the Cards finishing on top by a 4(5-38 margin. Coach Haynie will
field his best possible team Saturday and the score should mount even
higher.
The meet will be televised for the second straight time as a part of
KGO-TV's Sports Panorama. The first swimming meet on TV drew fav
oravle comments from all over the Bay Area. It will be a good chance
to see the championship Cards who have won 34 straight dual meets and
10 straight conference meets.
NEW ON THE HORIZON: The Stanford male population has been
receiving notices in their mail boxes of a new sport magazine to be pub
lished weekly by the editors of Life and Time starting in August. It looks
like the beginning of a new standby. After seeing the preview issue, my
opinion is that it will take the country by sto'rm. It has complete coverage
of all sports from A to Z and a unique variety of features and columns plus
some of the best action photos that I've ever seen.

field his best possible team Saturday and the score should mount even
higher.
The meet will be televised for the second straight time as a part of
KGO-TV's Sports Panorama. The first swimming meet on TV drew fav
oravle comments from all over the Bay Area. It will be a good chance
to see the championship Cards who have won 34 straight dual meets and
10 straight conference meets.
NEW ON THE HORIZON: The Stanford male population has been
receiving notices in their mail boxes of a new sport magazine to be pub
lished weekly by the editors of Life and Time starting in August. It looks
like the beginning of a new standby. After seeing the preview issue, my
opinion is that it will take the country by sto'rm. It has complete coverage
of all sports from A to Z and a unique variety of features and columns plus
some of the best action photos that I've ever seen.

Harry Buchalter's Stanford oarsmen are certainly in line lor a nomi
| nation to the "Hard Luck Club." Because crew is not sponsored by the |
University, the biggest problem faced by the sweepswingers is the raising I
ol substantial funds to carry on the sport.
i As a result, the publicity chairman and junior varsity coxswain, Rowd J
I Davis, set about on a campaign to attract as much attention to crew as pos
sible in order to draw any contributions to help the financial situation.
Alter strutting for three weeks to get the "promising Indian oarsmen" j
j mentioned somewhere else besides The Daily, success came. Not only
! were the orphans written up in the San Francisco and Los Angeles papers, j
but articles appeared in the New York Times and Time magazine!
However, there was something wrong—the occasion was the sur
prising and shameful Hi-length defeat hy UCLA at San Pedro. This
wasn't exactly the kind of publicity that coach Burhalter and his hoys
were hoping for. What can you do?
In line with the rkce against the Bruins, it should be noted that the
J shell which represented Stanford was made up of the fellows who pres
ently compose the junior varsity boat. Also, it should be realized that
the same USC boat which was beaten by the Card varsity this last week
end swamped the UCLA first eight by two lengths over the same course.

The JV oarsmen in Saturday's j
Stanford-USC encounter had their {
share of troubles to put up with, j
After a good start and with both j
eights running neck and neck near- j
ing the 1,000-meter point, the cry of
"Let 'er run!'" went up. It seems that |
one of the Trojans had broken both
his slide and his outrigger. Both
crews had to return to the boathouse I
and await the completion of the var- [
sity race so that a good shell could i
be used.
When finally the duel got under
way again, the two boats got as far i
as the three-quarter marker when a j
beautiful 40-foot sailboat was seen j
ivandering directly into the path ol
the racers. Through some miraculous !
act of navigation or something, the j
powerless craft managed to squeeze
between the two shells. Needless to j
say both crews were relieved when
they crossed the finish line.

The frosh sweepswlngers, coachcd this year by Phi Delt Frank Jameson,
seem to have a whole boatload of potential oarsmen for the future varsities. ;
The yearlings hold a win over the Indian and Trojan JV's and a loss to the '
Bruin cubs.
However, they are looking forward to a win over California's frosh boat
at Oakland on May 22. If such is the case, they might very well become
the first freshmen to travel east for the Syracuse Regatta on June 17.
Speaking of regattas, the world's championship crew, N;ivy, which hasn't j
lost a race in many moons, has accepted an invitation to compete in the
annual Newport Regatta which will be held on May 29 at the famous
Southland resort .spot. Also competing for the Helm's Perpetual Trophy '
will be Stanford, University of British Columbia, Oregon State, UCLA,
USC. Orange Coast College, and California, which has won the award for
the last three years. This annual classic has gone a long way toward in- !
creasing the popularity of crew on the Pacific Coast. Reports have it that
grandstand seats and moorings for spectator boats for the classic are al- ;
ready sold out.

Speaking of regattas, the world's championship crew, N;ivy, which hasn't j
lost a race in many moons, has accepted an invitation to compete in the
annual Newport Regatta which will be held on May 29 at the famous
Southland resort .spot. Also competing for the Helm's Perpetual Trophy '
will be Stanford, University of British Columbia, Oregon State, UCLA,
USC. Orange Coast College, and California, which has won the award for
the last three years. This annual classic has gone a long way toward in- !
creasing the popularity of crew on the Pacific Coast. Reports have it that
grandstand seats and moorings for spectator boats for the classic are al- ;
ready sold out.

This coming Saturday at 2 p.m., the varsity mermen compete in their
final dual meet of the season against California. Unless something goes
drastically wrong, Tom Haynie's men shouldn't encounter any trouble
in winning their 20.th straight Big Swim. The two teams met earlier this
year, with the Cards finishing on top by a 4(5-38 margin. Coach Haynie will
field his best possible team Saturday and the score should mount even
higher.
The meet will be televised for the second straight time as a part of
KGO-TV's Sports Panorama. The first swimming meet on TV drew fav
oravle comments from all over the Bay Area. It will be a good chance
to see the championship Cards who have won 34 straight dual meets and
10 straight conference meets.
NEW ON THE HORIZON: The Stanford male population has been
receiving notices in their mail boxes of a new sport magazine to be pub
lished weekly by the editors of Life and Time starting in August. It looks
like the beginning of a new standby. After seeing the preview issue, my
opinion is that it will take the country by sto'rm. It has complete coverage
of all sports from A to Z and a unique variety of features and columns plus
some of the best action photos that I've ever seen.
