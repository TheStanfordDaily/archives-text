### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
Stanford's.varsity soccer men, now
in the midst of one of their most
successful spring practices, turned
in an outstanding performance Sat
urday with a 4-2 triumph over the
alumni.
In the words of new Head Coach
Fred Priddle, "I have been very
much impressed with the quality
and the size of this spring's turn
out. Needless to say, I am very well
pleased with the result of Satur
day's game."
The varsity clinched last week
end's traditional fray with a pair of
second-half goals. A junior transfer
from Williams, center-forward Jim
Montgomery, put his second goal of
the day through the nets late in the
third quarter to make it 3-2 for
the varsity. Another new man. Bob
Maddox, added a clincher in the
fourth quarter, when the tired
alumni were fading.
The first half ended 2-1 in favor
of the varsity. Montgomery tallied
the first score only to have the game
knotted up by alumni center-for
ward Ruben Avisian. A beautiful
long shot by left wing John Van
Nortwick put the varsity back in the
lead. Avisian rammed home his sec
ond goal of the day off varsity goalie
Fred Fryeto start the second half.
Turning now to the practice as a
whole (it still has three weeks to
run), it has been highlighted by the
remarkably large turnout of some 40
candidates, a good percentage of
them new faces.
Best looking of the new prospects
are a bruising fullback, Bob Spare;'
little halfback Dick Babb, a con
verted footballer; Paul Schirmer,
who plays goalie, and the afore
mentioned Maddox and Montgom
ery.
Of the returning players, Coach
Priddle has praised the perform
ances of halfbacks Don Yates and
Steve Griffith. All - American left
inside Sam Suarez has been per
forming as usual to spark the for
ward line.
It has been a successful spring,
the results of which indicate Stan
ford should be a strong contender
in the reorganized Northern Cali
fornia League, which has recently
added San Jose State to its mem
bership. Other teams are Cal, USF.
Santa Clara, CCSF, and SFS.
