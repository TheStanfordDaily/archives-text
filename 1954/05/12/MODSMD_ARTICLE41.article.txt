If it had not been for an 11-
year-old boy who wanted to
have a few reminders of his first
European tour, there might nev
er have been a Leland Stanford
Jr. Museum. Indeed, there
might never have been a Leland
Stanford Jr. University.
It was on a trip to Europe with his
! mother in 1880 that the idea of col
lecting odds and ends first occurred
lo Leland Stanford Jr. He began by
collecting odd stones, stuffed birds,
and bits of bric-a-brac in order to
better remember his trip. He picked
; up curios in every town that he vis
ited, in every inn that he stayed.
| Hi: efforts were encouraged by his
! mother, and soon he had at least a
bit ol stone from almost every part
! of the continent.
But he was no: so interested in his
collecting or absorbed in his travels
that he forgot about home. He was
till a small boy at heart. He often
! wrote his father, Governor Stanford,
; to remind him "not to forget to feed
i my dog. And the more he traveled
' about and collected curios from ev
j cry corner of Europe, the more he
j thought of home.
On his return to San Francisco,
Leland Jr. set out to arrange and

classify, as best he could, the pieces
of his collection. When the entire
collection was finally displayed, two
full upper story rooms of the Stan
ford Nob Hill mansion became his
private museum.
The chance to turther nis collec
tion came when the Governor and
Mrs. Stanford took him on a second
trip to Europe. He was then 15 years
old. Trunks and packing cases
seemed to fill themselves as if by
magic as the Stanfords traveled
from country to country. And
marked on each case in a boyish
hand was "Property of the Leland
Stanford Jr. Museum."

In May 1884, the young boy died
suddenly of typhoid fever during
the Stanfords* stay in Florence,
Italy.
The grieved family returned to
San Francisco to ever be reminded
of their loss by the two musty up
stairs rooms and countless packing
cases lying unopened in the cellar
of their spacious home.
It was then that the dream of
young Stanford of a museum for the
city began to take definite form.
And when the Stanfords built a
University in memory of- their son,
they saw to it that his dream became
a reality.
