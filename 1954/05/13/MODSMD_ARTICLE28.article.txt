## Time and the Hearings 
### 
Three weeks ago today the McCarthy-Army
hearings opened in Washington.
Since then, eight Senators, the Secretary of
the Army, and other high government officials
have devoted most of their time to trying to
determine whether or not Senator McCarthy
and Roy Cohn sought "by improper means," as
the original charge stated, to get preferential
treatment for Private David Schine, and wheth
er or not ArVny Secretary Stevens "and his as
sistants resorted to what McCarthy calls "black
mail tactics" to halt subcommittee hearings on
the Army.
Still, after countless hours of hearings, very
little evidence either proving or disproving
these charges has been presented.
The main charges under investigation have
been almost entirely lost, and the hearings
have degenerated into a controversy over pro
cedure, near-filibustering by both sides, and
petty bickering over minor issues.

For these reasons, and the additional point
that the Senate's legislative action is obviously
suffering from the absence of the eight Sena
tors involved in the hearings, we regret that
some plan to speed up the proceedings has not
been adopted.
Perhaps it would be somewhat unfair to
bring the hearings to a speedy close now, after
Secretary Stevens has been on the v/itness
stand for 14 days, but we do not agree with a
charge made Tuesday that the Secretary has
been "humiliated" by the proceedings. The
doctored photograph and fake letter obviously
have injured McCarthy more than they have
any of the other parties involved in the dispute.
However, after three weeks of charge and
counter-charge, examination and cross-exami
nation, little—if anything—has been ac<fbm
plished. Is there, therefore, any reason to ex
pect that prolonging (he hearings at their pres
ent pace would be any more productive?
