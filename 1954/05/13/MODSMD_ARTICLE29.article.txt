# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
I finished off the last few bars on El Camino and
strode into The Daily Shack the other day. Waiting
for me were five gentlemen on the football team.
"There he is," one snarled.
"Is there something I can do for you?" I began.

"Lissen," said a second, "Did
you write this spring football
story that says 'seventeen hun
dred pounds of football beef,
spread over 85 frames, reported
to Coach Chuck Taylor.'?"
"Those are my words," I said
simply.
"Shadup," said a tackle, tack
ling nu>.
"I hate you," said the fourth.
"Me too," said the fifth.

"But, but," I tried.
"Shadup," said a center, stuffing a football down
my throat.
"Urp," 1 admitted, giving up my end of the con
versation. 0
"Don't you realize," shouted the first one, pulling
out a slide rule, "that if 85 men weigh seventeen
hundred pounds, that means that the team only aver
ages 20 pounds a man?"
"That's all right, Chuck will fatten them up," I
allowed, trying to make a funny.
'Ha, ha," scoffed a fullback, putting out his ciga
rette between my eyes.
"Point of order, Mr. Chairman. Okay, I admit it!
1 admit it! I should have said seventeen THOUSAND
pounds and that the team really averages 200 pounds
a man. Now, are you satisfied?"
"Yes,' they chorused simply and walked out.
I never was too good at math.

SPRING SHOW NOTES. This is overdue, but
special plaudits go to director Warner Lcroy and to
the cast of the Spring Show. Especially Bill Burke,
whose electrifying singing voice and greatly improved
stage presence make him a real winner; to Sylvia
Ilaining, whose silver-lined throat makes the rafters
ring in Ethel Mermen proportions; and to gagman
Dick Winter, who survived the going despite the
fact that he broke his arm the night before the show
opened and had to take Codine to kill the pain—a
real "show must go on" man.
Chief Gordy Davis, when he learned that Ram's
Head was going to use a tommy gun in the show told !
a Spring Show technician, "If you use a tommy gun in j
that show. I'm going to put you and the whole cast
in jail. A tommy gun could wipe out any police
* force between here and Los Angeles."

A Roble accordionist, who apparently has about
as much musical talent as Francis the mule, is
making money hand over fist for the Con Home
Drive. Every time she starts playing, her corridor
mates shell out 15 cents for an hour's silence. She's
made over four bucks.

GOOD GL'Y DEPT. Russell House recently had
a facility tea. (( sent out a handful of invitations, !
and a l«t( of profs didn't even hother to answer. J
However, Dean Winhigler, who had another com- ,
mittn.cnt, forwarded a v nice letter and sent with it
a load of orchids for Russell, It was iust a small J
touch, but we include it because we think it's pretty i
characteristic of the Dean, who never lets his po
sition of high responsibility interfere with his
thoughtfulness and regard for the students.

A Roble accordionist, who apparently has about

GOOD GL'Y DEPT. Russell House recently had
a facility tea. (( sent out a handful of invitations, !
and a l«t( of profs didn't even hother to answer. J
However, Dean Winhigler, who had another com- ,
mittn.cnt, forwarded a v nice letter and sent with it
a load of orchids for Russell, It was iust a small J
touch, but we include it because we think it's pretty i
characteristic of the Dean, who never lets his po
sition of high responsibility interfere with his
thoughtfulness and regard for the students.

I finished off the last few bars on El Camino and
strode into The Daily Shack the other day. Waiting
for me were five gentlemen on the football team.
"There he is," one snarled.
"Is there something I can do for you?" I began.

"Lissen," said a second, "Did
you write this spring football
story that says 'seventeen hun
dred pounds of football beef,
spread over 85 frames, reported
to Coach Chuck Taylor.'?"
"Those are my words," I said
simply.
"Shadup," said a tackle, tack
ling nu>.
"I hate you," said the fourth.
"Me too," said the fifth.

"But, but," I tried.
"Shadup," said a center, stuffing a football down
my throat.
"Urp," 1 admitted, giving up my end of the con
versation. 0
"Don't you realize," shouted the first one, pulling
out a slide rule, "that if 85 men weigh seventeen
hundred pounds, that means that the team only aver
ages 20 pounds a man?"
"That's all right, Chuck will fatten them up," I
allowed, trying to make a funny.
'Ha, ha," scoffed a fullback, putting out his ciga
rette between my eyes.
"Point of order, Mr. Chairman. Okay, I admit it!
1 admit it! I should have said seventeen THOUSAND
pounds and that the team really averages 200 pounds
a man. Now, are you satisfied?"
"Yes,' they chorused simply and walked out.
I never was too good at math.

SPRING SHOW NOTES. This is overdue, but
special plaudits go to director Warner Lcroy and to
the cast of the Spring Show. Especially Bill Burke,
whose electrifying singing voice and greatly improved
stage presence make him a real winner; to Sylvia
Ilaining, whose silver-lined throat makes the rafters
ring in Ethel Mermen proportions; and to gagman
Dick Winter, who survived the going despite the
fact that he broke his arm the night before the show
opened and had to take Codine to kill the pain—a
real "show must go on" man.
