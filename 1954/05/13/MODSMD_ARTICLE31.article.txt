In the 1952 -53 fiscal year, run
ning from Sept. 1, 1952. through
Aug. 31, 1953, the University
Libraries spent a total of $393,- !
271.43. This represented an in
crease of 14 per cent from the
previous fiscal year.
About two-thirds of the Library's
annual expenditure goes to pay sal- |
aiies for Library employees. In j
1952-53, a total ol 93.5 stall mem- ;
bers (in full - time equivalents) j
earned $268,099.81 in the University!
Libraries.
Established salary scales for those
years—the latest lor which complete j
official statistics are available—show |
seven .salary classes, ranging from I
Library Assistant, at a minimum j
salary of $2,200 per annum, to Divi
sion Chief, at a minimum annual '
.salary of $4,900.
Part-time student help in the Uni
versity Libraries is paid a minimum
wage of 75 cents an hour, and the
average is close to 85 cents an hour
for all part-time help.
Funds for the University Libraries
are voted each year by the Trustees.
For the 1953-54 fiscal year, a repre
sentative figure was the allocation
for loan desk and stack maintenance
only. For regular positions, $9,020
was allotted. Part-time help at the
loan desk drew salary from an al
lotment of $10,000: $4,500 was allot
ted for parte time student pages in
the stacks.
In 1952-53, the* Library spent j
$80,583.40 for hooks and periodi- |
cals. Hook funds for the current
(1953-54) fiscal year as allocated
by the. University come to a little j
le*s than $57,000, including $21,240
income from the Jewel Fund En- !
dowment begun with the $500,000
received in the sale of Mrs. Leland
Stanford's jewels after her death.
In addition to regular University j
book funds, the Library will use,
during the current fiscal year, $8,500 !
in departmental book endowment
income, $6,000 library book endow
ment income, and expendable gift
funds which are unpredictable but
have so far this fiscal year (as of
March 31) amounted to $6,125.
In the 1952-53 fiscal year, the Uni
versity Libraries spent $18,486.09 on
binding. Most binding and repair on
bound volumes is done in the Re
ceiving and Binding Service in the
Library basement, but Serials has j
periodicals bound in volumes at the !
Stanford Press.
The Library spent $26,102.13 on
"supplies anil expense," unenumer
ated, during the 1952-53 fiscal year.
In connection with recent Li
brary reports to the University i
administration, the Library has I
drawn up a set of comparative ■
fiscal statistics for 13 universities.
Included are the Stanford Libra
ries as a whole, including the au- |
tonomous Hoover Library and
other libraries which are not a
part of the University Libraries.
The statistics are for the 1951-52
fiscal year.
In that year, Stanford Libraries I
exclusive of Hoover Library spent I
$465,469. This figure represents ex- !
penditure of all Stanford libraries, j
including those outside the Univer
sity Libraries per se and excluding i
Hoover Library.
The Stanford Libraries were I
fourth among six Coast universities |
surveyed in this department. The
University of California spent $1,- 1
665,464 on libraries that year.
For that same year, Stanford Li- .
braries (again excluding Hoover Li
brary) spent 4 per cent of the total j
University operating expenditures, j
finishing behind UCLA, California, i
Oregon, USC, and Washington in ;

that order. UCLA spent 12.9 per
libraries in 1951-52.
For thai same year, Stanford
was topped only by the Univer
sity of California on the Coast in
total volumes of holdings, 1,812,-
«SG to 1,040,985.

In that year also California,
UCLA, and the University of Wash
ington all spent more on salaries
than did Stanionl Libraries. Stan
ford spent $29.'},(<75; California spent
$1,166,406.

In connection with recent Li
brary reports to the University i
administration, the Library has I
drawn up a set of comparative ■
fiscal statistics for 13 universities.
Included are the Stanford Libra
ries as a whole, including the au- |
tonomous Hoover Library and
other libraries which are not a
part of the University Libraries.
The statistics are for the 1951-52
fiscal year.
In that year, Stanford Libraries I
exclusive of Hoover Library spent I
$465,469. This figure represents ex- !
penditure of all Stanford libraries, j
including those outside the Univer
sity Libraries per se and excluding i
Hoover Library.
The Stanford Libraries were I
fourth among six Coast universities |
surveyed in this department. The
University of California spent $1,- 1
665,464 on libraries that year.
For that same year, Stanford Li- .
braries (again excluding Hoover Li
brary) spent 4 per cent of the total j
University operating expenditures, j
finishing behind UCLA, California, i
Oregon, USC, and Washington in ;

that order. UCLA spent 12.9 per
libraries in 1951-52.
For thai same year, Stanford
was topped only by the Univer
sity of California on the Coast in
total volumes of holdings, 1,812,-
«SG to 1,040,985.

In that year also California,
UCLA, and the University of Wash
ington all spent more on salaries
than did Stanionl Libraries. Stan
ford spent $29.'},(<75; California spent
$1,166,406.
