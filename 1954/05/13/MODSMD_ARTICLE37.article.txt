## 
### ELMORE SEEDS 
Warren Dailey, a mainstay of thej
defending NCAA champion Card
goll team, gets the nod for Daily
athlete of the week.
The junior from Manitowoc, Wis
consin, paced Stanford to its fifth
straight Southern Division medal
play title last weekend Dailey card
ed rounds of 73-68-73-73—287, for
medalist honors over the tough
Stanford layout. He was 11 strokes
ahead of his nearest competitor,
teammate Phil Getchell.
The sensational performance
marked a return to form for War
ren, who had been off his game
through the earlier part of the sea
l-on. He played an important part in
last year's national championship |
conquest on the world - renowned
Broadmoor course in Colorado.
Dailey's performance was all the
more remarkable in view of the j
soft fairways and stiff breeze of last I
weekend. The course was at its full
6.800-yard limit, as the high scores j
of the other rounds indicate.
Last Thursday in a warm - up |
round, Daily shot a <34, one of the j
four rounds under G5 ever shot on
the Stanford course. Dailey's was I
one of two from the long champion- :
.ship tees. Dailey had seven birdies j
arid 11 pars in his par-busting ef— j
fort.
Dailey's accomplishments include
the 1950 Western junior, quarter
finalist in the 1952 NCAA, several
Wisconsin state amateur and high
school championships. Warren has

also placed in George S. May's All -
American tourney for amateurs at
the Tam O'Shanter course in Chi
cago.
As a freshman Dailey had to take
a babk seat as teammate Fred
Brown burned up the fairways, but

last year as a sophomore he moved
up to number one man, defeating
the renowned Kenny Venturi and
carding several far - below - par
rounds.
