# Stanford Swimmers Write Great Record in 38 Years
## 
### BOB DURAND 
Since 1915 when Stanford built its first swimming pool, the varsity mermen have had but two
coaches, Ernst Brandsten and Tom Haynie.
However, these two men have combined to establish one of the finest competitive swimming
records ever compiled by any college or university. Consistently one of the top winning varsity
teams on campus, the natators show an over-all r of 140 wins as against only 32 defeats.

Included in these outstanding sta
tistics ait' 37 triumphs over Califor
nia against five losses, 14 Pacific
Coast Conference championships,
and always a high ranking in NCAA
competition.
The formidable reputation that the
Indian swimmers have built up does
not show any signs of faltering ei
ther. Over the past four years, Tom
Haynie's teams have 34 straight dual
meets, 10 straight conference meets,
and 19 straight Big Swims with Cal
to their credit.
To insure* these records, on this
year's squad there are nine sopho
mores out of the 14 team members.
Coming ftp from the freshman squad
are several boys that should replace
the three graduating*seniors on the
team.
"Ernie" Brandsten took charge of
Stanford's first swim team in 1916
and didn't finish his coaching duties
until 1948 when he retired in favor
of Haynie.
Before coming to the Farm, Ernie,
who was a native of Sweden, had es
tablished a world-wide reputation
in athletics and had placed third in
the diving at the 1912 Olympic
Games.
While at Stanford, he became the
first man to standardize the spring
board and to invent an adjustable
fulcrum or point, of balance for the
board. One can see the trade name
"Bra n d s t e n '' on diving boards
throughout the world and at every
Olympic Games.
In his coaching career, he devel
oped five Olympic champions, plus
seven other Olympic team members,
eight intercollegiate champs, and six
national AAU champs. Brandsten
was also the swimming mentor for
all the Olympic Games from 1920 I
through 1936.
After 32 years of untiring service
to Stanford, Ernie ended his color
ful career in 1948 and is now devot
ing his time to his summer resort
located a few miles from the campus j
on Searsvilie Lake.
When Haynie took over the coach
ing reins, he likewise brought with
him an outstanding record.
Tom attended the University of
Michigan as a member of the class
of 1939 after attending the 1936
Olympics. While competing for the
Wolverines, he was natioanl cham
pion and record holder in the 220-
and 440-yard freestyle events.
In 1940, he represented the United
States in the Pan American Games
and broke all freestyle records in
the 200-, 400-, and 800-meter races.
The same year, he became national
AAU champion in the 220- and 440-
yard races.
In 1941, he was assistant swim
coach at Wayne University in De
troit. and while in the Navy from
1942 to 1946, he coached the Naval
Intercollegiate team. After his dis
charge, he came to Stanford as an
assistant to Brandsten.
Since Haynie took over as head
coach, the Indian mermen have fin
ished no worse than fifth in the na
tionals and have won five out of
six conference championships.
Saturday's meet with California
will climax 38 years of swimming at
Stanford. They are 38 years of his
tory that have been filled with suc
cess for two men: Ernie Brandsten
and Tom Haynie, both of whom have
been instrumental in establishing
the Farm's winningest sport.
