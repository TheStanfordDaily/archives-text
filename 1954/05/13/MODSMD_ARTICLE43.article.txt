Dick Clegg's rampaging Stanford
frosh mauled Modesto High School
14-1 yesterday afternoon on the
frosh diamond as they neared the
end of their season.
Today's 3:15 game against Sequoia
High School of Redwood City is the
last scheduled contest.
The Cleggmen pounded out 15
hits, their highest total so far, in
massacring Modesto. Waving the
big stick for Stanford was right
fielder Hap Wagner. Wagner gar
nered four hits in five trips to the
plate. Pitcher Dave Bohnen
fattened his average with two hits
in two attempts.
Winning pitcher Don fetters was
very impressive in his first starting
assignment. The lanky southpaw
hurled five innings of no-hit ball
until Bohnen took over. Bohnen al
lowed three hits during his four
inning stint. Petters struck out
three and issued six walks.
Stanford's sharp infield trio of
Rudy Flgueroa, Bob Fletcher, and
Beppo Dver accounted for three
double plays. Substitute first sack
er Dave Wilde completed a fourth
double play unassisted.
