# Stanford Planned Museum For a San Francisco Site

(EdiUir's note: This is tli«* sec

Stanford Museum. The museum
will open Sunday after being
closed for the past eight years.)

It had been the original plan
of the Stanfords that the com
pleted Leland Jr. Collection be
presented as a gift to the city of
San Francisco. But when young
Stanford died, the Governor and
his wife decided against it.
For with the death of Leland Jr.,
their plans died also. They had two
rooms full of display cases with la
beled exhibits, but no one to enjoy
or care for them.
They were, however, determined
that the memory of their son should
live. They planned to build a Uni
versity to honor that memory. And
a museum was to be an integral part
of that University.
While the Governor went about
the business of planning; and actu
ally building the University, Mrs.
Stanford took, as her fcxclusivc
task, the planning of the museum.
She alone retained the architects'
and contractors. She alone in
spected and approved the actual
plans of the building. The memo
rial to her son was now the domi
nant interest in her life.
The museum building was com
pleted and occupied in 1892, within
a year after the University held its
first classes.
The main building was the first to
be completed, and was the first re
inforced concrete building in the
country. Understandably enough,
the reinforcements embedded in the
concrete were railroad rails.
Later, Mrs. Stanford added the
two wings which flank the origi
nal structure. (One is now part of
the Anatomy Building.) With the
addition of these new wings, the
Leland Stanford Jr. Museum be
came the largest private museum
in the world.
During her future travels
throughout the world, Mrs. Stanford
purchased many fine exhibits for the
museum. She was continually look
ing for new display matter. The
Egyptian exhibit, one of the largest
«»nd most complete in the entire mu
seum, was acquired by Mrs. Stan
ford while traveling in that region.
It was primarily through her per
sonal efforts that the core of the mu
seum exhibits had such a substan
tial start, and the foundation on
which further collecting might build
was so solid.

or care for them.
They were, however, determined
that the memory of their son should
live. They planned to build a Uni
versity to honor that memory. And
a museum was to be an integral part
of that University.
While the Governor went about
the business of planning; and actu
ally building the University, Mrs.
Stanford took, as her fcxclusivc
task, the planning of the museum.
She alone retained the architects'
and contractors. She alone in
spected and approved the actual
plans of the building. The memo
rial to her son was now the domi
nant interest in her life.
The museum building was com
pleted and occupied in 1892, within
a year after the University held its
first classes.
The main building was the first to
be completed, and was the first re
inforced concrete building in the
country. Understandably enough,
the reinforcements embedded in the
concrete were railroad rails.
Later, Mrs. Stanford added the
two wings which flank the origi
nal structure. (One is now part of
the Anatomy Building.) With the
addition of these new wings, the
Leland Stanford Jr. Museum be
came the largest private museum
in the world.
During her future travels
throughout the world, Mrs. Stanford
purchased many fine exhibits for the
museum. She was continually look
ing for new display matter. The
Egyptian exhibit, one of the largest
«»nd most complete in the entire mu
seum, was acquired by Mrs. Stan
ford while traveling in that region.
It was primarily through her per
sonal efforts that the core of the mu

tial start, and the foundation on
which further collecting might build
was so solid.

It had been the original plan
of the Stanfords that the com
pleted Leland Jr. Collection be
presented as a gift to the city of
San Francisco. But when young
Stanford died, the Governor and
his wife decided against it.
For with the death of Leland Jr.,
their plans died also. They had two
rooms full of display cases with la
beled exhibits, but no one to enjoy
or care for them.
They were, however, determined
that the memory of their son should
live. They planned to build a Uni
versity to honor that memory. And
