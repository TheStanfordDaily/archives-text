# Card Baseballers Will Play Important Weekend Series
## UCLA, Cal Tilts Could Mean Flag 
### RUSS WILKS 
Everett Dean sends his fired
up forces into their biggest base
ball weekend of the year as the
Tribe hosts UCLA this afternoon
at 3:15 and travels up the road to
Edwards Field tomorrow to tan
gle with California in a double
header at 1:30.
The Indians could come out of the
action with the PCC and CIBA
bunting; could be assured of no
worse than a tie for both; could lose
both; or could cinch the PCC and
be assured of a tie for the CIBA or
figure in a number of other possi
bilities.
But, as Dean stated, one way or
the other, the trio of games could
well ''tell whether we go north on |
May 28 or not."
The Bth District NCAA Baseball
Committee announced earlier in the
week that the Northern and South
ern Division PCC winners and two
at-large teams will meet up north
May 28, 29, and 31, in a double elim
ination play-off to decide the district
representative in the collegiate
"world series" at. Omaha in June.
USC, which is idle this week end,
and Stanford are the only contenders
for pennant laurels. The race at a

:i Games to play
Dean has nominated Ray Young
to face the Bruins' ace Marty Stiles
today. Young, 7-2 on the season and
5-1 in league play, carries a 0.82
earned run average into the fray
and holds two decLsions over Stiles
and UCLA, 4-2 and 3-2 verdicts.
The Cards also won the third game j
3-2:
Phil Page, who looked sharp in
handling Santa Clara last week, will
oppose Cal's number one man Joo
Gaggero in tomorrow's opener. Gag
gero, after being pummeled, 12-3,
in his first try against the Cards,
pitched a strong game last week de
spite losing 5-3.
Either Mike Acker or Don Dc-
Long will toss the seven-inning j
nightcap against Frank Merlo or j
southpaw Bill Wirth.
The question mark in the Stan
ford alignment is Captain Warren
Goodrich. Goodrich, currently belt
ing the horsehide at .343, cut his
right hand on a chipped coffee
cup earlier in the week and has
been bothered by the injury in
practice the last two days. Dean
won't know definitely until game
time whether his game competi
tor will be able to play.
If Goodrich can't go, either George
Selleck or Sid Hall will take up the
slack. Goodrich may move out to
center field where he normally
wouldn't have to do as much throw
ing.
If Hall plays his old Braves' posi
tion and Goodrich can't operate in
the garden, either the Johnny-come
lately senior Ralph Cassady or left
hand hitting Dixie Workman will
take over.
Tlie remainder of the line-up, with
Mickey Hodgman (.462) back at
third, will be intact..
The Indians have been lean on
hitting lately, but have faced .some
good pitching in Gaggero and Santa
Clara's Ray Stanley.
The Bruins boast three hitters over
.300 in league action with Al Bates
.349, Sam "First Down" Brown .319,
and Joe Malonc .316. Cal will sporl
the league's second top hitter with
John Dcrdivanis at .382 and also
| have the long ball hitting Tom Pol
lock.
Tomorrow will be Clint Evans day
in Berkeley. The Cal coach ends
his 25-year reign and has put all
his coaching know-how into making
the Bears a cellar dwelling club
with a 4-9 mark.

:i Games to play
Dean has nominated Ray Young
to face the Bruins' ace Marty Stiles
today. Young, 7-2 on the season and
5-1 in league play, carries a 0.82
earned run average into the fray
and holds two decLsions over Stiles
and UCLA, 4-2 and 3-2 verdicts.
The Cards also won the third game j
3-2:
Phil Page, who looked sharp in
handling Santa Clara last week, will
oppose Cal's number one man Joo
Gaggero in tomorrow's opener. Gag
gero, after being pummeled, 12-3,
in his first try against the Cards,
pitched a strong game last week de
spite losing 5-3.
Either Mike Acker or Don Dc-
Long will toss the seven-inning j
nightcap against Frank Merlo or j
southpaw Bill Wirth.
The question mark in the Stan
ford alignment is Captain Warren
Goodrich. Goodrich, currently belt
ing the horsehide at .343, cut his
right hand on a chipped coffee
cup earlier in the week and has
been bothered by the injury in
practice the last two days. Dean
won't know definitely until game
time whether his game competi
tor will be able to play.
If Goodrich can't go, either George
Selleck or Sid Hall will take up the
slack. Goodrich may move out to
center field where he normally
wouldn't have to do as much throw
ing.
If Hall plays his old Braves' posi
tion and Goodrich can't operate in
the garden, either the Johnny-come
lately senior Ralph Cassady or left
hand hitting Dixie Workman will
take over.
Tlie remainder of the line-up, with
Mickey Hodgman (.462) back at
third, will be intact..
The Indians have been lean on
hitting lately, but have faced .some
good pitching in Gaggero and Santa
Clara's Ray Stanley.
The Bruins boast three hitters over
.300 in league action with Al Bates
.349, Sam "First Down" Brown .319,
and Joe Malonc .316. Cal will sporl
the league's second top hitter with
John Dcrdivanis at .382 and also
| have the long ball hitting Tom Pol
lock.
Tomorrow will be Clint Evans day
in Berkeley. The Cal coach ends
his 25-year reign and has put all
his coaching know-how into making
the Bears a cellar dwelling club
with a 4-9 mark.

up forces into their biggest base
ball weekend of the year as the
Tribe hosts UCLA this afternoon

The Indians could come out of the
action with the PCC and CIBA
bunting; could be assured of no
worse than a tie for both; could lose
both; or could cinch the PCC and
be assured of a tie for the CIBA or
figure in a number of other possi
bilities.
But, as Dean stated, one way or
the other, the trio of games could
well ''tell whether we go north on |
May 28 or not."

Committee announced earlier in the
