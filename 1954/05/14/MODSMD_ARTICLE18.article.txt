# Laniel Upheld By 2 Votes On Geneva Issues
## 
### 
PARIS, May 13 (UP) â€”Premier
Joseph Laniel tonight won a vote of
confidence by a two-vote margin in
the National Assembly, staving off a
fall of his government during the
vital Geneva talks on an Indochinese
truce. The vote, 289 to 287, was
greeted with mixed boos and cheers.
Laniel posed the confidence vote
on his demand that the Assembly
postpone a full-scale debate on In
dochina. The Premier said rejection
of his government would spell dis
aster at Geneva and in Indochina.
The 64-year-old conservative Pre
mier had won a confidence vote just
a week ago on the same issue. But
the French Indochinese bastion of
Dien Bien Phu fell in the interim
between the two votes, and today's
feeble margin reflected increasing
French concern over the desperate
Indochinese situation.
Meanwhile, in r Geneva British
Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden
proposed a five-point plan for Ko
rean unification today and suggested
that its consideration be restricted
to seven nations.
Eden made his appeal before the
19-nation group considering Korea
while the nine-power conference 'on
Indochina was in recess until to
morrow because of the French gov
ernment situation in Paris.
He said East and West agreed on
the need to unify Korea and to give
the war-wracked land its full inde
pendence.
