# Con Home Week to End In Carnival, Crowning
## Sophs to Sponsor Festivity Tonight 
### 
Music, food, and fun are in
store for Stanford students to
day, as the Soph Carnival winds
up the 1954 Con Home Drive.
The Carnival, which will last from
2 p.m. to 6 p.m., will be held at
Rudy's Alpine Inn.
Highlighting the affair will be
the coronation of the Con Home
King and Queen at 4:30 p.m. by

Dean H. Donald Winbigler. The win
ners will be unknown until that
time, as today's voting will be se
cret.
Musical entertainment during the
Carnival will be provided by the
Alpha Delt Dixieland Band.
Over 34 fraternities, eating clubs,
and living groups are sponsoring
booths at the Carnival.
Students with gambling tenden

Delt "Rat Race" or the El Campo
"Guess Your Weight or Bust" booths.
For the athletic, there are the
Kappa Sig "Smash a Car," the Lagu
nita Court Golf Putting, and the
Theta Xi Waterbagging booths.
For pure entertainment, Lathrop
offers a side show, and the DU's
invite students to dunk Durand
coeds.
On the practical side, Storey House
coeds will vend cotton candy and
popcorn, and residents of Hurlburt
and Russell will combine on a shoe
shine stand.
Among the prizes offered are or
chids from Hawaii.
A 20-ccnt charge will admit stu
dents to the carnival. Tickets for
the various booths will be sold.
Trophies will be awarded to the
most profitable and the most original
booths.

A special car pool will pick up

p.m. It will start at Branner, and
