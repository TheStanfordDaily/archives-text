# Needed: A Permanent Policy
## 
### 
The Honor Code report and recommenda
tions adopted byl Excom Wednesday night
were primarily concerned with the education
of students on the Code.
The recommendations for that education in
volved a yearly discussion program similar to
the one just completed plus several other forms
of yearly orientation.
By such emphasis on education, the report
implied a general dissatisfaction with the stu
dents' knowledge of the Code and its specific
application.
We would like to add one recommendation
which we feel should be included in the gen
eral effort to "educate the students on the
Honor Code."
It is this:
That a consistent and permanent policy be
established for the reporting in The Daily of
the cases coming before the Council for Stu
tient Control.
In the past, there has been no permanent
policy. Each year, The Daily finds itself in a
position of wanting to report Honor Code vio
lations as they are considered by the Council
but wondering"what view the members of the
Council will take on such reporting.
That view has ranged all the way from a flat
"no" to having a reporter at the meetings to a
cooperation in which The Daily and the Coun
cil have worked together in writing the stories
for publication.
But it appears that every year is marked by
a reluctance on the part of the Council for Daily

coverage of the cases.
This year, we have been successful in work
ing with the Council to supply that coverage to
the students. We have reported as fully and
responsibly as possible the decisions, reason
ing, and circumstances involved in each Honor
Code violation case that the Council consid
ered.
And we are sure that those reported have
helped the students to better understand what
the Honor Code is and how it is applied in ac
tual situations. *
There is no guestion in our mind that a stu
dent will become more fully av/are of the mean
ing of the Honor Code if he reads of actual vio
lations and decisions rather than if he is given
only a pamphlet which describes the broad
goals and functions of the Code.
We want such education to continue. We
want the assurance that next year, and the year
after, the students will be permitted to know
what the Council for Student Control is doing
and how it is applying the Honor Code —
through the reporting of cases in The Daily.
And we would add that we would like to see
the same type of education for the Fundamental
Standard—through reporting of the cases that
come before the groups responsible for its ap
plication, Men's and Women's Councils. At
present, we are reporting the cases for Men's
Council. But we are not allowed to report cases
in Women's Council.
A permanent policy statement for all of these
groups is needed.
