## Apathy and Democracy

To the Editor:
Re: article and editorial on academic freedom.
Diplomacy and tact are but not necessary
among friends. Both the administration and the
student body of Stanford have earned a sharp ad
monition from loyal Americans. They should be un
equivocally reprimanded for all the middle-aged vir
tues: prudence, discretion, immobility, paternalism,
and, what is most reprehensible, apathy. Apathy
is never common sense; it is always pernicious, and
an epidemic of it would sound the death knell of
democracy.
Academic freedom, though it is seldom talked about
now, should be an issue â€” and not merely among
"left-wing rabble rousers." As yet no one has con
fronted the executive or legislative branches of our
government with a direct challenge of-the constitu
tional rights of a congressional committee to police
our universities. A few Columbia professors did what

was necessary but, left high and dry by their col
leagues of such schools as Stanford, their effort was
merely sidetracked and eventually forgotten by an
apathetic nation.
But let us join the administration in its paternal
istic agedness. Let us be practical and admit no one
will 1 i ton to "harangues" about freedom. So let us
shift our attention to Attorney General Brownell's
request for new legislation aimed at Communist
dominated unions. Forget academic freedom for a
while: everyone else has; and focus on the major
problem Mi'. Brownell must solve if a government
bureau will not be granted the privilege of control
ling our labor unions: how to define communism, a
Communist, and Communist-dominated. If these def
initions are left as vague as they have been in past
legislation and as they are in most persons' minds,
God help American labor and democracy!
