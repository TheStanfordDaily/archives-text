# Pity, Not Resentment
## 
### 
To the Editor: *
The editorial of May 11 in The Stanford Daily
validly points up the contradictions in the administra
tion's attitude toward a student statement on aca
demic freedom. The five reasons given by the ad
ministration for discouraging this statement run di
rectly counter to the principles of education. If courses
were to be removed from the curriculum on the
grounds that the average student is not particularly
interested in them (Glover's Point 1)! or that there
is no immediate practical need for them (Point 5),
or that discussion sections might get out of hand
(Point 3), Stanford would long since either have

closed its doors or else changed its name to Leland
Stanford Junior Trade School.
However, it would be unwise hastily to condemn
the administration's attitude. Stanford has to consider
public relations as well as principles, the obtaining
of money as well as the dissemination of ideas. It i
the dangers involved in taking a firm stand on a j
controversial issue are great enough, perhaps the I
administration is wise in asking us to remain silent.
The appropriate attitude is not resentment, but rather
pity for the great educators who are forced to sacri
fice their principles to necessity, and regret that such
a state of affairs can occur in our country.
