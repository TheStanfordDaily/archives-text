# VA Requests Hospital Site
## 
### 
A short letter has been received
by the University from Harvey V.
Higloy, Veterans' Administrator, re
questing approval by the University,
in principle, of locating the proposed
1,000 bed neuro-psychiatric hospital
on Stanford land.
No details were given in the letter
except that the VA was considering
150-175 acres.
The site selected by the VA is
located at Page Mill Road and Ju
nipero Serra Boulevard.
A University spokesman told The
Daily that the request will definitely
be considered at the May 20 meet
ing of the Board of Trustees. He
added that no decision will be
reached at this meeting even on the
principle of locating the proposed
VA hospital on Stanford land.
