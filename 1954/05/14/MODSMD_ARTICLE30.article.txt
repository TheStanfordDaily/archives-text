# LIBRARY PROBLEMS DESCRIBED
## Library Director Finds Difficulty In Insufficient Budget and Facilities 
### R.G. MANSFIELD 
In the winter quarter just past,
the Stanford Library "lost con
trol of the books on the shelves,"
in the words of Director R. C.
Swank.
The snarl centered in the Main
Stack, where a great many books
were mis-shelved—i.e., were placed
in incorrect call number order. The
results were that students who asked
for books or went into the shelves
to find them didn't get them, since
they were to all practical purposes
lost, and at the end of the quarter
a large number of library delinquen
cies were reported where relatively
few existed.
Swank says that "these problems
in the Library, like those of many
other departments of the Univer
sity, are mainly financial." He
summarized for The Daily a report
he has made to the President of
the University on the winter quar
ter situation:
First, the library's salary expendi
ture for loan desk and stack main
tenance, per volume circulated from
the main stacks, "are one fifth that
of another major California institu
tion" (which Swank declined to
name).
Second, the hourly rate of pay for
student help—starting at 75 cents
per hour—is such that "we have not
been able to get and keep adequate
help." The turnover in student help
between October 1953 and April
1954 was nearly 100 per cent.
Third, "the stacks are full." Con
gestion of books in the main stack
has made maintenance, shelving, and
shifting of books "extremely diffi
cult."
The open-stack experiment "ag
grevated the confusion. We did not
have enough help in the stack to
make it work properly," Swank
said.
Library officials cite the large
number of clerical errors at the end
of last quarter as a result of the
rapid turnover of the basically "in
adequate start" of part-time person
nel. At the rate of turnover men
tioned above, student help lacks ade
quate training, according to Swank.

Division personnel at the library
are fairly unanimous in identify
ing the causes of library troubles.
"We could just about solve our
problems if we had more money"
. . . "We sutler enormously from
poverty" . . . "We're limited by
building and staff" . . . "We're too
understaffed here to (do the job
that we would like to do" . . .
"Our budget is too small."
These are a few opinions offered
by personnel in the Library depart
ments. The Reference and Humani
ties division does not find itself seri
ously hampered by lack of funds,
but in the Circulation Division the
great wish is for more money.
Completion of the sixth and sev
enth levels of the main stack would
cost $70,000. A complete inventory
of the main stack would cost $50,000.
Right now the Library is conducting
an emergency shelf , reading, with
personnel drawn from all library
departments; it will take a total of
1,000 man hours to do a thorough
job here.
The Library still seeks "to make
our resources available." "The Uni
versity Libraries aim as always to
improve* their book collections, to
strengthen their staff, and to offer
better services. Reorganization for
better service is the immediate is
sue," says director Swank in an
outline of Library plans prepared for
The Daily.
The Library summarizes its plans
thus:
"First, the Libraries plan to
place more frequently used books
on open shelves in the various
reading roomr.
"Second, open - shelf reading
rooms are planned for lower divi
sion students on the ground floor
of the Main Library building."
The Library hopes eventually to
install a General Education Divi
sion for lower division students
in the area now occupied by Re
served Book and Document rooms.
This division would incorporate
RBR and Western Civ library col
lections as well as other much
used books.
"Third, the Libraries plan spe
cialized subject reading rooms,
also open-shelf, for upper divi

sion, graduate, and facility re
searchers.
"Fourth," plans are on the hoards
for such additional facilities as a
map room, a central bibliography
room, an audio - visual depart
ment, and more stm'y and seminar
space."
The Library also hones to continu
and expand it-> series of cultura
programs such as Intermezzo talk
and films and the exhibits.

"Most of these plans depend, how
ever, upon the remodeling of the
Main Library building .. . Swank
adds, pointing out that the useful
space in the present building "can
readily be increased by 50 per cent."
The Library urgently needs more
stack space. This too will require
remodeling and additions to the
building.
The Library wants "to make our
resources available."
