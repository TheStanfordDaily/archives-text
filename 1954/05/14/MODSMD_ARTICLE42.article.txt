# MUSEUM OPENS SUNDAY
## Rare Collections Reclaimed From Earthquake Rubble 
### SAM SOSNA 
(Editor's note: This is the last of a series of three features «m the Stan
ford Museum, which will open Sunday at noon.)

Mrs. Stanford took great interest in the growth and development
of her son's memorial. She lived to see it prosper, but died only
a short time before the earthquake of April, 1906, reduced a large
part of the building to rubble.
The main structure, which was of reinforced concrete, with-

stood that tremor with relative ease." 1
But the wings, which were not of
such stern stuff, collapsed.
When the walls fell, they took
with them the greater part of the
famed Cesnola Collection of classical
pottery and glassware. A collection
of about 5,000 pieces was reduced
to over 1.5 million bits—a gigantic
archeological jig-saw puzzle.
The museum opened after the
earthquake in 1909. The rubble was
still in the basement and most of
the displays were in miserable
shape. Although donations of mate
rial kept pouring into the museum,
it was finally closed after the sec
ond World War.
Not long afterward, Dr. Hazel D.
Hansen of the Classes Department
returned from a visit to archeologi
cal diggings in Greece. The base
ment of the museum, still full of
wreckage from the earthquake, of
fered a unique opportunity for some,
domestic excavation. She decided to
straighten out the classical displays. ;
Dr. Hansen and four of her stu
dents tackled the problem. They
were forced to literally dig then
way through the basement to reach j
the wrecked pottery. It took them ;
an entire quarter to work their way
from the door to the opposite wall.
And working in semi-darkness, they
began assembling the atfcheological
puzzle.
Since then, small groups have
been working to put the exhibits in
presentable order. Crews of paint
ers and carpenters were called in to
renovate the building. Experts were
consulted in the identification and
classification of the displays.
One of the most interesting rooms
in the museum is the Stanford
Room. It is in two sections. One

♦
houses furnishings, pictures, and
gowns from the Stanford home. The
other is devoted entirely to the col
lections of Leland Jr.
The latter contains all the mate
rial that the boy collected. There
are the odd rocks and stuffed birds
that interested the young lad.
There is the original case around
which young Leland built his pri
vate museum. All the cases in this
room contain the original arrange
ment and labels as he presented
them.
This is the story of the "New Mu
seum" — from childhood fantasy to
famed reality; from an upstairs hob
by to an academic power.
The Leland Stanford Jr. Museum
is opening Sunday for the first time
in eight years. It will be open daily
and Sunday from noon to 4 p.m. It
will be closed on Tuesdays. Admis
. sion will be 25 cents. There will be
no charge for children under 12.
Stanford students, faculty, and their
families will be admitted free.

The Leland Stanford Jr. Museum

no charge for children under 12.
Stanford students, faculty, and their
families will be admitted free.

Mrs. Stanford took great interest in the growth and development
of her son's memorial. She lived to see it prosper, but died only
a short time before the earthquake of April, 1906, reduced a large
part of the building to rubble.
The main structure, which was of reinforced concrete, with-

stood that tremor with relative ease." 1
But the wings, which were not of
such stern stuff, collapsed.
When the walls fell, they took
with them the greater part of the
famed Cesnola Collection of classical
pottery and glassware. A collection
of about 5,000 pieces was reduced
to over 1.5 million bits—a gigantic
archeological jig-saw puzzle.
The museum opened after the
earthquake in 1909. The rubble was
still in the basement and most of
the displays were in miserable
shape. Although donations of mate
rial kept pouring into the museum,
it was finally closed after the sec
ond World War.
Not long afterward, Dr. Hazel D.
Hansen of the Classes Department
returned from a visit to archeologi
cal diggings in Greece. The base
ment of the museum, still full of
wreckage from the earthquake, of
fered a unique opportunity for some,
domestic excavation. She decided to
straighten out the classical displays. ;
Dr. Hansen and four of her stu
dents tackled the problem. They
