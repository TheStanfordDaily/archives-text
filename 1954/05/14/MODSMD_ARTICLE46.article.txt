# Spikers in Coast Relays; Cards Big Swim Favorites
## Wood and Long Choices In Fresno Track Classic 
### BILL WRIGHT 
The injury-riddled track crew drops into the desert metropolis
of Fresno tomorrow night to battle the pick of*the California cinder
men in the West Coast Relays on the Ratcliffe Stadium speedway.
Roy Smith, Bill Rupp, and Jim Luttrell will not compete for the
Cards because of bum legs, and with no medley relay team

entered, Stanford cannot hope to
challenge USC's collegiate suprem
acy.
But Stanford is looking for a few
outstanding individual performances
in the annual attraction which will
bring together representatives from
Fort Old, Santa Clara Youth Center,
Los Angeles Athletic Club, Camp
Pendleton Marines, and the San
Diego Naval Training Center as well
as the major California colleges.
Hurdler Gerry Wood and javelin
ace Leo Long will be favored to
win the college divisions in their
specialties, although they may not
be able (o handle their foes in the
open division.
Wood, who lipped over the 120
high timbers against the wind in
14.2 last week, will lace his tough
est competition of the year in LA
AC's Jack Davis, ex-USC star.
Wood wiil be up against Cal's
Hon Dozier in his hurdle heat. Other
entrarfts will be Art Barnard of
LAAC, who made the Olympic team,
Willard Wright of SC, and Gene
Rossellini of UCLA.
Long, who has the best college
spear toss in the country, should
win the undergraduate division with
ease, but Bud Held will be tough
to beat i.i the open division.
Stanford's best bet in the relay
events is the mile quartet of Larry
Spicer, Wood, Walt Garrett, and
captain Fred George. This group
ran an easy* 3:17.9 last week, but
with George's bad leg improving,
the Cards should be able to press
the Jim Lea-led Trojans.
Ed Fremouw, Jim Saras, Garrett,
and Keith Brownsberger will han
dle the 440 and 880 sprint relays for
the Indians, but they are not ex

pected to have much chance against
the SC dash aces.
Brownsberger will run in the open
1(X) against about the toughest field |
possible on the coast. He'll be pit
ted against Bob Richards, former j
UCLA star; Herbie Turner, Fresno j
State; Herb Jackson. Cal; and Jim ]
Bugbee, SC, in this heat alone.
Fremouw will enter the broad
jump where Jon Arnett of SC is the
favorite. Bill Flint and Jerry An
gove will represent the Indians in
the pole vault against O.W. Rhodes,
San Jose State frosh; Larry Ander
son. Cal; Walt Levack, SC. The
vaulting will begin at 13 feet, which
is Flint's best.
John Stewart and Norm Jiles, two
top high jumpers, will tangle with
Ernie Shelton of Troy and Herm
Wyatt of the Youth Center among
others.
A 1 Cheney and Phil Brabyn will
see how close they can come to
Parry O'Brien in the shot put.
Meanwhile, Chuck Strong and Bob
Reed will run the 5,000 meters.

outstanding individual performances
in the annual attraction which will
bring together representatives from
Fort Old, Santa Clara Youth Center,
Los Angeles Athletic Club, Camp
Pendleton Marines, and the San
Diego Naval Training Center as well
as the major California colleges.
Hurdler Gerry Wood and javelin
ace Leo Long will be favored to
win the college divisions in their
specialties, although they may not
be able (o handle their foes in the
open division.
Wood, who lipped over the 120
high timbers against the wind in
14.2 last week, will lace his tough
est competition of the year in LA
AC's Jack Davis, ex-USC star.
Wood wiil be up against Cal's
Hon Dozier in his hurdle heat. Other
entrarfts will be Art Barnard of
LAAC, who made the Olympic team,
Willard Wright of SC, and Gene
Rossellini of UCLA.
Long, who has the best college
spear toss in the country, should
win the undergraduate division with
ease, but Bud Held will be tough
to beat i.i the open division.
Stanford's best bet in the relay
events is the mile quartet of Larry
Spicer, Wood, Walt Garrett, and
captain Fred George. This group
ran an easy* 3:17.9 last week, but
with George's bad leg improving,
the Cards should be able to press
the Jim Lea-led Trojans.
Ed Fremouw, Jim Saras, Garrett,
and Keith Brownsberger will han
dle the 440 and 880 sprint relays for
the Indians, but they are not ex

pected to have much chance against
the SC dash aces.
Brownsberger will run in the open
1(X) against about the toughest field |
possible on the coast. He'll be pit
ted against Bob Richards, former j
UCLA star; Herbie Turner, Fresno j
State; Herb Jackson. Cal; and Jim ]
Bugbee, SC, in this heat alone.
Fremouw will enter the broad
jump where Jon Arnett of SC is the
favorite. Bill Flint and Jerry An
gove will represent the Indians in
the pole vault against O.W. Rhodes,
San Jose State frosh; Larry Ander
son. Cal; Walt Levack, SC. The
vaulting will begin at 13 feet, which
is Flint's best.
John Stewart and Norm Jiles, two
top high jumpers, will tangle with
Ernie Shelton of Troy and Herm
Wyatt of the Youth Center among
others.
A 1 Cheney and Phil Brabyn will
see how close they can come to
Parry O'Brien in the shot put.
Meanwhile, Chuck Strong and Bob
Reed will run the 5,000 meters.


LARRY SPICER
—Will press the Trojans
The injury-riddled track crew drops into the desert metropolis
of Fresno tomorrow night to battle the pick of*the California cinder
men in the West Coast Relays on the Ratcliffe Stadium speedway.
Roy Smith, Bill Rupp, and Jim Luttrell will not compete for the
Cards because of bum legs, and with no medley relay team

entered, Stanford cannot hope to
challenge USC's collegiate suprem
acy.
