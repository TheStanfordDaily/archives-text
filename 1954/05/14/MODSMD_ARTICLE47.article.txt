If you were one to make rash statements, you might go out on the limb
far enough to say that last week was a good week for track. You might
even say it was a "great" week.
The biggest news came first—Ffluger Bannister. The only individual
track performance you can compare with the Britisher's 3:59.4 mile is
Corny Warmerdam's vault of 15-BVi. There's not much need to repeat what
has been said about Bannister; it's been in all the papers.
However, Dick Koenigsberger's story for The Daily on the mile record
had a final paragraph of some interest. That particular paragraph did
not get in the paper last Friday because of space limitations. It contained
a statement by Jack Weiershauser, Stanford track boss, predicting that
the next barrier to fall would be the 60-fcot ceiling in the shot put.
Saturday, as you know, Parry O'Brien shot the shot 60-s'/2 in the Los

Angeles Coliseum. He broke his
accepted world record of 59-2and
his previous personal best of 59-9%
(set three weeks ago) four times of
ficially, once in warm up, and once
in a foul toss. But still he was
slightly disappointed:
"When I bettered 60 feet in ten
nis shoes and my sweat suit, I
figured I'd do 02 feet for sure. But
I guess I was too tense."
Now the excitement is about more
new records. The Bannister mile has
perked up the other top milers. Con
fident Wes Santee of Kansas has
challenged Bannister to run four
laps around the Coliseum the sec
ond week end in June.
Mai Whitfield, who holds the 880
record of 1:48.G, has set his sights
on a 3:56.5 in the mile, and Ban
nister is turning his attention toward
Whitfield's half mile mark.

Whitfield ran 4:06.8 on a board
walk a couple of weeks ago. And at 29 he should be at his peak physi
cally, as far as running the mile is concerned. The best age for a sprinter,
on the other hand, is 18 or 19.
In the 880 Bannister will be seeking probably the most vulnerable
world's record around. Among the regularly run distances, that is.
Jess Mortenson, SC's head cinder coach, predicts that another "impos
sible performance" will be performed before the year is out. He says
Trojan Ernie Shelton will get over seven feet in the high jump. Maybe
this month.
Night high jumping is best, providing the light is good, says Shelton;
and he will leap under the arcs tomorrow at Fresno, next Friday at the
Coliseum Relays, and the following week at the Compton Invitational.
Fortune Gordien, a discus thrower of note, almost added another
world's record last week. He whirled the platter 196-4, bettering his own
marks of 186-11 (accepted) and 194-6 (pending). But his little toe slipped
over the foul line. Gordien makes no predictions, but he's looking for a
200-foot effort this year.
Santee caught the record-breaking spirit himself last week, but not
in the mile. He established a new intercollegiate two mile time of 8:58 flat
to knock three-tenths off Don Lash's old mark, fn freshman ranks UCLA's
Don Vick, mentioned in this space a couple of weeks ago. rewrote O'Brien's
old national frosh shot record with a 54-V2 put.
And prepster Don Bowden from nearby San Jose Lincoln High got
in the swing of things with a 1:53.2 clocking in the 880. That was the
second new national scholastic record set by Californians this year.
Speedster Bill Swisshelm of Santa Ana High ran the 180 low hurdles in
18 7. Swisshelm has done 9.7 in the 100 and 20.8 in the 220.
Steve Turner of Cal shared the old hurdle record of 18.9. Lang Stanley's
1:53.9 time was the previous half mile mark before Bowden went to work.
Perhaps the lanky San Josean will travel up El Camino a little way for
his future education.

Gerry Wood, the unbeaten Card high hurdler, turned in an effort which
was practically overlooked amidst the Bannister-O'Brien news. Wood
bucked the breeze and the slow Stadium track Saturday in the Big Meet,
and after 120 yards of barriers the watch at 14.2.
Watch out tomorrow when Wood cuts loose on the lightning fast strip at
Fresno. He probably won't be able to beat LAAC's Jack Davis, the
former SC star who won last year in 13.6, but the Card high stepper could
conceivably break 14 seconds. Wood hasn't been pushed all year. He's
just been running against the clock and the hurdles.

Jess Mortenson, SC's head cinder coach, predicts that another "impos
sible performance" will be performed before the year is out. He says
Trojan Ernie Shelton will get over seven feet in the high jump. Maybe
this month.
Night high jumping is best, providing the light is good, says Shelton;
and he will leap under the arcs tomorrow at Fresno, next Friday at the
Coliseum Relays, and the following week at the Compton Invitational.
Fortune Gordien, a discus thrower of note, almost added another
world's record last week. He whirled the platter 196-4, bettering his own
marks of 186-11 (accepted) and 194-6 (pending). But his little toe slipped
over the foul line. Gordien makes no predictions, but he's looking for a
200-foot effort this year.
Santee caught the record-breaking spirit himself last week, but not
in the mile. He established a new intercollegiate two mile time of 8:58 flat
to knock three-tenths off Don Lash's old mark, fn freshman ranks UCLA's
Don Vick, mentioned in this space a couple of weeks ago. rewrote O'Brien's
old national frosh shot record with a 54-V2 put.
And prepster Don Bowden from nearby San Jose Lincoln High got
in the swing of things with a 1:53.2 clocking in the 880. That was the
second new national scholastic record set by Californians this year.
Speedster Bill Swisshelm of Santa Ana High ran the 180 low hurdles in
18 7. Swisshelm has done 9.7 in the 100 and 20.8 in the 220.
Steve Turner of Cal shared the old hurdle record of 18.9. Lang Stanley's
1:53.9 time was the previous half mile mark before Bowden went to work.
Perhaps the lanky San Josean will travel up El Camino a little way for
his future education.

Gerry Wood, the unbeaten Card high hurdler, turned in an effort which
was practically overlooked amidst the Bannister-O'Brien news. Wood
bucked the breeze and the slow Stadium track Saturday in the Big Meet,
and after 120 yards of barriers the watch at 14.2.
Watch out tomorrow when Wood cuts loose on the lightning fast strip at
Fresno. He probably won't be able to beat LAAC's Jack Davis, the
former SC star who won last year in 13.6, but the Card high stepper could
conceivably break 14 seconds. Wood hasn't been pushed all year. He's
just been running against the clock and the hurdles.


PARRY O'BRIEN
—"I was too tense.'
If you were one to make rash statements, you might go out on the limb
far enough to say that last week was a good week for track. You might
even say it was a "great" week.
The biggest news came first—Ffluger Bannister. The only individual
track performance you can compare with the Britisher's 3:59.4 mile is
Corny Warmerdam's vault of 15-BVi. There's not much need to repeat what
has been said about Bannister; it's been in all the papers.
However, Dick Koenigsberger's story for The Daily on the mile record
had a final paragraph of some interest. That particular paragraph did
not get in the paper last Friday because of space limitations. It contained
a statement by Jack Weiershauser, Stanford track boss, predicting that
the next barrier to fall would be the 60-fcot ceiling in the shot put.
Saturday, as you know, Parry O'Brien shot the shot 60-s'/2 in the Los

Angeles Coliseum. He broke his
accepted world record of 59-2and
his previous personal best of 59-9%
(set three weeks ago) four times of
ficially, once in warm up, and once
in a foul toss. But still he was
slightly disappointed:
"When I bettered 60 feet in ten
nis shoes and my sweat suit, I
figured I'd do 02 feet for sure. But
I guess I was too tense."
Now the excitement is about more
new records. The Bannister mile has
perked up the other top milers. Con
fident Wes Santee of Kansas has
challenged Bannister to run four
laps around the Coliseum the sec
ond week end in June.
Mai Whitfield, who holds the 880
record of 1:48.G, has set his sights
on a 3:56.5 in the mile, and Ban
nister is turning his attention toward
Whitfield's half mile mark.

Whitfield ran 4:06.8 on a board
walk a couple of weeks ago. And at 29 he should be at his peak physi
cally, as far as running the mile is concerned. The best age for a sprinter,
on the other hand, is 18 or 19.

Fresno. He probably won't be able to beat LAAC's Jack Davis, the
former SC star who won last year in 13.6, but the Card high stepper could
conceivably break 14 seconds. Wood hasn't been pushed all year. He's
just been running against the clock and the hurdles.


PARRY O'BRIEN
—"I was too tense.'
If you were one to make rash statements, you might go out on the limb
far enough to say that last week was a good week for track. You might
even say it was a "great" week.
The biggest news came first—Ffluger Bannister. The only individual
track performance you can compare with the Britisher's 3:59.4 mile is
Corny Warmerdam's vault of 15-BVi. There's not much need to repeat what
has been said about Bannister; it's been in all the papers.
However, Dick Koenigsberger's story for The Daily on the mile record
had a final paragraph of some interest. That particular paragraph did
not get in the paper last Friday because of space limitations. It contained
a statement by Jack Weiershauser, Stanford track boss, predicting that
the next barrier to fall would be the 60-fcot ceiling in the shot put.
Saturday, as you know, Parry O'Brien shot the shot 60-s'/2 in the Los

Angeles Coliseum. He broke his
accepted world record of 59-2and
his previous personal best of 59-9%
(set three weeks ago) four times of
ficially, once in warm up, and once
in a foul toss. But still he was
slightly disappointed:
"When I bettered 60 feet in ten
nis shoes and my sweat suit, I
figured I'd do 02 feet for sure. But
I guess I was too tense."
Now the excitement is about more
new records. The Bannister mile has
perked up the other top milers. Con
fident Wes Santee of Kansas has
challenged Bannister to run four
laps around the Coliseum the sec
ond week end in June.
Mai Whitfield, who holds the 880
record of 1:48.G, has set his sights
on a 3:56.5 in the mile, and Ban
nister is turning his attention toward
Whitfield's half mile mark.

Whitfield ran 4:06.8 on a board
walk a couple of weeks ago. And at 29 he should be at his peak physi
cally, as far as running the mile is concerned. The best age for a sprinter,
on the other hand, is 18 or 19.
In the 880 Bannister will be seeking probably the most vulnerable
world's record around. Among the regularly run distances, that is.
Jess Mortenson, SC's head cinder coach, predicts that another "impos
sible performance" will be performed before the year is out. He says
Trojan Ernie Shelton will get over seven feet in the high jump. Maybe
this month.
Night high jumping is best, providing the light is good, says Shelton;
and he will leap under the arcs tomorrow at Fresno, next Friday at the
Coliseum Relays, and the following week at the Compton Invitational.
Fortune Gordien, a discus thrower of note, almost added another
world's record last week. He whirled the platter 196-4, bettering his own
marks of 186-11 (accepted) and 194-6 (pending). But his little toe slipped
over the foul line. Gordien makes no predictions, but he's looking for a
200-foot effort this year.
Santee caught the record-breaking spirit himself last week, but not
in the mile. He established a new intercollegiate two mile time of 8:58 flat
to knock three-tenths off Don Lash's old mark, fn freshman ranks UCLA's
Don Vick, mentioned in this space a couple of weeks ago. rewrote O'Brien's
old national frosh shot record with a 54-V2 put.
And prepster Don Bowden from nearby San Jose Lincoln High got
in the swing of things with a 1:53.2 clocking in the 880. That was the
second new national scholastic record set by Californians this year.
Speedster Bill Swisshelm of Santa Ana High ran the 180 low hurdles in
18 7. Swisshelm has done 9.7 in the 100 and 20.8 in the 220.
Steve Turner of Cal shared the old hurdle record of 18.9. Lang Stanley's
1:53.9 time was the previous half mile mark before Bowden went to work.
Perhaps the lanky San Josean will travel up El Camino a little way for
his future education.

Gerry Wood, the unbeaten Card high hurdler, turned in an effort which
was practically overlooked amidst the Bannister-O'Brien news. Wood
bucked the breeze and the slow Stadium track Saturday in the Big Meet,
and after 120 yards of barriers the watch at 14.2.
Watch out tomorrow when Wood cuts loose on the lightning fast strip at
Fresno. He probably won't be able to beat LAAC's Jack Davis, the
former SC star who won last year in 13.6, but the Card high stepper could
conceivably break 14 seconds. Wood hasn't been pushed all year. He's
just been running against the clock and the hurdles.
