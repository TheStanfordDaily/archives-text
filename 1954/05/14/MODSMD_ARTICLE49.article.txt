## 
### BOB DURAND 
Stanford's powerful swimming Indians close out their 38th dual
meet season tomorrow i« the Big Swim starting at Encina Pool at
2 p.m.
Coach Tom Haynie's forces will be going for their 20th straight
triumph over California, their 11th straight conference win, and

their 35th straight dual meet vic
tory.
The 44th meeting between the two
team; will be televised for the sec
ond time over KGO-TV
The Card mermen are heavy fa
vorites to sweep their I!9t!i tri
umph over the Bears since the two
squads first met in 1916. They
should capture every (ir.->t place
with the exception of diving.
Swimming his last dual meet for
the Indians will be captain Jim
Gaughran, who has had one of the

most colorful careers in Stanford |
history. Other seniors on the team
are Bill Mclvor and Lee Guryierson.
Gaughran is a good bet to break
| the meet record in the 100 - yard |
freestyle race. The present mark is !
| :51.7, set in 1952 by the Cards' Bruce !
Putnam. Other records in danger of I
being cracked are the 220-yard free- j
style and the 200-yard backstroke.

Distance star Dan Osborne should
come through with a top effort to
pass the mark of 2:10.0 held jointly
by Indians Pete Cole and Bob
Thompson. Both of these 220-yard

*
| boys achieved their top effort in ]
1 1952.
Backstroker Larry Heim will be
I striving to crack his own record
of 2:08 8 which he set last year. If
lie does so, he will also be smash- j
ing a Pacific Coast Conference j
mark which he now holds.
The Stanfords should have no
trouble in winning both relays. The
medley trio of Larry Heim, Winston
I Black, and Jim Gaughran has been
j turning in consistently better times
than Cal's team of Bill Floyd, Tak
Iseri, and Bob Mayo.
The Cards' freestyle quartet of
Lee Gunnerson, Bill Clemans, Doug
, Ackerman, and Gaughran likewise
i has recorded faster clockings than
the Bears' Karl Marhenke, Dave
Kennell, Dick Ehni, and Bill Spore.
Cal's Dave Radcliff in the 440- j
yard freestyle and Jerry Hays in j
i the 200-yard breaststroke are unde- j
I feated in their events so far this
year. However, they did not race '

Stanford's Dan Osborne and Win
ston Black in the earlier meet.
One of the closest races of the
day will lie the 150-yard individ
ual medley. The Blue &. Gold's
Hays has been clocked in 1:35.6
for the event, while the Indians'
John Weiser has done a best of
1:35.0.
Gaughran will not be swimming
in one of his usual races, the 50-yarc
freestyle. Instead, Phil Gay anc
Ackerman will carry the load bui
should have no trouble in beating
out the visitors' Spore and Ehni.
