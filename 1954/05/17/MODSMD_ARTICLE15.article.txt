# Bears, Bruins Wreck Baseball Title Hopes
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
The championship bubble* buist hk Stanford's baseballers ex
perienced their tnosl disastion:; weekend of the season, being
whitewashed by UCLA, '5 0, Friday and dropping a doubleheader
to cellar dwelling Cal Saturday, 5- I and 4-1.
The Indians wound up their PCC play with a B-6 record and are

assured of at least a he for see- *
orid place. With only one CIBA 1
tilt left, tornorrov/'s clash at
Santa Clara, the Cards arc alio as
sured of no worse tic for the
consolation second.
USC, idle during J ho weekend,'
came in the back door to wrap up j
both pennants thanks to Stanford's
misfortunes.
The story of defeat was tlir same
in all three games The Indians had ;
no hitting attack and their oppo
nents had sharp pitching and just
enough stickwork to produce their
wanted results. A look at the tatr.~
tics tells the sad story. The Cards |
manufactured only two runs and It j
hits in the three games, two of the
hits were doubles and the rest sin
gles And in their last 19 innings
the Cards have only produced 23
hits.

Friday UCLA dampened Stan
ford' pennant, hopes as Marty Stiles
tossed the first shutout against them
this season, a gaudy six-hit job.
The Bruins pounced upon Kay
Young in the opening frame for two
runs on ingles by Bob Decker and
Joe Malone and a double by Bob
Lombard. UCLA, fighting for a sec
ond-place PCC spot, added a marker
for insurance in the seventh on a
single by Daryl Westerfeld, a two
base throwing error by Young and
a fly ball by Stiles.
The Cards tried to stage a come
hack, but Stiles scattered two singles
each by Tom Dandurand and A1
Talboy and one-basers by Sid Hall
and Len Swartz. Young pitched
well enough to win as he fanned five
and issued only one walk
Saturday, Clint Evans Day at Ber
keley, the Bears' Joe Gaggero, Don
Walker, and John Derdivanis gave
Evans his biggest present as t.hey
were instrumental in wining out
Stanford's slim chance for a play-off
berth.
In the opener Phil Page and Gag
gero hurled shutout hall until the
seventh wtoen the Indians drew first
blood. With one down, Talboy lined
a single into left. Bob Evans lofted a
Texas League double into short left
J center to score Talboy.
But the pesky Bears sailed into
the lead as Walker connected for a
! 450-foot inside the park homer to
j left field to score Gaggero who had
J walked. In its next at-bat Cal added
three more with Guggero's line sin
gle and Walker's double doing the
main damage.
Warren Goodrich's first - inning
j single was the only other Stanford
I blow. •
In the seven-inn:ng nightcap, the
j Cards again scored first as Dandu
rand walked, was sacrificed to sec
ond, and came around as Evans
belted a double to deep right center.
Three singles and a fielder's choice
; gave the Bears a one-run cushion
j in their half of the second, but it was
| left up to Derdivanis to apply the
I clincher in the sixth. The wiry cen

terfielder stepped to bat with a man |
on and smacked one of Don De-
Long's offerings far over the 322-
foot sign in right field.
Afteiutheir run in the second, De-
Long's solid single and several walks
were all that stubborn Cal hurler
Bill Slack would allow in twirling a j
two-hitter.,
One of the h%Yi spots of the 45- I
minute between - games ceremony
that honored the retirement of
Coach Evans was the presentation [
of a Stanford blanket by Card men
tor Everett Dean to signify the keen j
rivalry between the two schools.

reached first on one of the 11 hits the Indians collected while

Saturday, Clint Evans Day at Ber

were instrumental in wining out

seventh wtoen the Indians drew first
blood. With one down, Talboy lined
a single into left. Bob Evans lofted a
Texas League double into short left
J center to score Talboy.
But the pesky Bears sailed into
the lead as Walker connected for a
! 450-foot inside the park homer to
j left field to score Gaggero who had
J walked. In its next at-bat Cal added
three more with Guggero's line sin
gle and Walker's double doing the
main damage.
Warren Goodrich's first - inning
j single was the only other Stanford
I blow. •
In the seven-inn:ng nightcap, the
j Cards again scored first as Dandu
rand walked, was sacrificed to sec
ond, and came around as Evans
belted a double to deep right center.
Three singles and a fielder's choice
; gave the Bears a one-run cushion
j in their half of the second, but it was

I clincher in the sixth. The wiry cen

terfielder stepped to bat with a man |
on and smacked one of Don De-
Long's offerings far over the 322-
