# For Next Year
## 
### 
The Con Home Drive is over and the campus
is quickly forgetting the week of car washes,
auctions, monkey business, and carnivals.
It will probably come as a surprise to campus
publicity hounds that we choose to write about
something that is past, at a time when words
and pictures and headlines cannot add to the
"big-push" for enthusiasm and contributions.
But before the drive is completely forgotten,
we will add a few words on an idea about the
Con Home and Stanford.
We hope that Stanford is fully aware of the
good that it has done by its efforts for the Con
Home. We might say that it is a natural law
that when an effort becomes."BfG," its partici
pants lose sight of iis essential purpose. We

hope that the student who paid 15 cents to
smash hell out of a car with a sledgehammer
did not lose sight of the Con Home and its chil
dren. We hope that those students will donate
as freely next year and the year afterâ€”even if
the drive committee is not so imaginative as
it was this year.
There is no guarantee that imagination will
continue to future years of Con Home Drives.
But there is little doubt that the needs of the
Con Home will continue for many years. For
that reason, we offer this additional "publicity"
now, in the hopes that all of us will remain
aware of those needs, for now, for next year,
and for every year that we are close to Stan
foid and the Con Home.
