### PETE GROTHE 
TRIBUTE TO A CHARACTER
As you read this, a bus is moving from the draft
board in San Jose to Fort Old. In it sits tfoe biggest
character that I know.
His name is Mike Hudson. He was sports editor of

The Daily last year and is not
to be confused with the Mike
Hudson who is a sophomore.
Mike's main claim to fame is
that he holds the world's inter
national record for running out
of gas on Palm Drive: seventeen
tirr\es passing motorists have ob
served a person with un un
combed brown thatch and a lazy
shuffle carrying a can of gas to
his stalled vehicle on Palm Drive.

This doesn't include the approximately 40 times that
Mike has run out of gas on other street:;.
Hudson, who was a journalism grad student this
year, is one of the campus's most frantic bettor;;.
When he was in a freshman bio lab, he bet his part
ner $1.50 that he would eat the inner part of the eye
ball of a dogfish shark he was dissecting. Hudson
collected $1.50. At a garden wedding reception last
year, someone took a cup of scummy water out of a
fishpond, got up a collection of $1.70 to give to Mike
if he drank it. Mike did, and threw a squirming
minnow down his throat for good measure.
Mike is Stanford's champion "rater." In a dull
class, Mike is invariably scribbling harder in his
notebook than anyone else. But his turbulent pen
is not concerned with the lecture material. It is
busying itself with one of Mike's numerous "rating"
charts. Among the items that Hudson has rated are:
the top ten Hollywood scandal stories, best 44 foot
ball players since 1940. a "good guy" list, a "bad guy"
list, outstanding major league baseballers, top 25
movie stars of all time, best modern songs, top five
pastes lor eating, and the choices ten movies that he
saw for free.
But Mike's most striking—and hardest (o de
scribe—talent is his aliility to size lip in iini<|iic

and humorous terms any situation. lie doesn't have
to work for humor—everything he says is just
naturally funny, sometimes choking in its intensity,
lie might he described as the Will Rogers of Stan
ford.
I recall Mike's walking out of a class at the end of
a quarter's work and saying, "That professor thought
we were clapping for him. Actually, we were just
slapping ourselves to stay awake."
On another occasion Mike said, "Only Ernest Hem
ingway's immortal Look can sum up that class
'Death in the Afternoon.' You just sit there ami die
five afternoons a week."
When 3,000 copies ol my hook "Cheat Moments in
Stanford Sports" first came out, I told Hudson that
I was going to have to personally buy any copies that
weren't sold. He quipped, "You're going to have the
largest library in California, all of one book."
Another quip about a guy Hudson didn't like:
"Rob really has the Midas touch: everything he
touches turns to slime."
Hudson, a .self-styled expert on sports, show busi
ness, and politics, has a favorite habit of badgering
freshman Daily reporter.-, about their politics. He
worked on one girl who was violently pro-McCarthy
so unceasingly that .she is now wearing a "McCarthy
for Fuehrer button.
Hudson has other talents. He boasts he can make
the best custard this side of the Mississippi; he knows
how to get a coke out of a machine for nothing; and
he is one of the Farm's most devoted golf addicts.
Mike, whom II have never heard swear, has few
enemies. But those he does have, he disposes of
quickly ai d effectively. He merely orders $15
worth of groceries and several magazine subscrip
tions in their name and has it sent to them C.0.1).
And so, Mike is now on the brink of army life, or
as he puts it, "Living in low gear for two years."
Stanford will be just a slight bit poorer without his
quips, rating charts, practical jokes, and frantic bets.
His bus is now on the way to Fort Orel. But it will
never g< t there. With Mike in it, it will undoubtedly
run out of gas.

When 3,000 copies ol my hook "Cheat Moments in
Stanford Sports" first came out, I told Hudson that
I was going to have to personally buy any copies that
weren't sold. He quipped, "You're going to have the

Another quip about a guy Hudson didn't like:
"Rob really has the Midas touch: everything he
touches turns to slime."
Hudson, a .self-styled expert on sports, show busi
ness, and politics, has a favorite habit of badgering
freshman Daily reporter.-, about their politics. He
worked on one girl who was violently pro-McCarthy
so unceasingly that .she is now wearing a "McCarthy
for Fuehrer button.
Hudson has other talents. He boasts he can make
the best custard this side of the Mississippi; he knows
how to get a coke out of a machine for nothing; and
he is one of the Farm's most devoted golf addicts.
Mike, whom II have never heard swear, has few
enemies. But those he does have, he disposes of

worth of groceries and several magazine subscrip
tions in their name and has it sent to them C.0.1).
And so, Mike is now on the brink of army life, or
as he puts it, "Living in low gear for two years."
Stanford will be just a slight bit poorer without his
quips, rating charts, practical jokes, and frantic bets.
His bus is now on the way to Fort Orel. But it will
never g< t there. With Mike in it, it will undoubtedly
run out of gas.

TRIBUTE TO A CHARACTER
As you read this, a bus is moving from the draft
board in San Jose to Fort Old. In it sits tfoe biggest
character that I know.
His name is Mike Hudson. He was sports editor of

The Daily last year and is not
to be confused with the Mike
Hudson who is a sophomore.
Mike's main claim to fame is
that he holds the world's inter
national record for running out
of gas on Palm Drive: seventeen
tirr\es passing motorists have ob
served a person with un un
combed brown thatch and a lazy
shuffle carrying a can of gas to
his stalled vehicle on Palm Drive.

This doesn't include the approximately 40 times that
Mike has run out of gas on other street:;.
Hudson, who was a journalism grad student this
year, is one of the campus's most frantic bettor;;.
When he was in a freshman bio lab, he bet his part
ner $1.50 that he would eat the inner part of the eye
ball of a dogfish shark he was dissecting. Hudson
collected $1.50. At a garden wedding reception last
year, someone took a cup of scummy water out of a
fishpond, got up a collection of $1.70 to give to Mike
if he drank it. Mike did, and threw a squirming
minnow down his throat for good measure.
Mike is Stanford's champion "rater." In a dull
class, Mike is invariably scribbling harder in his
notebook than anyone else. But his turbulent pen
is not concerned with the lecture material. It is
busying itself with one of Mike's numerous "rating"
charts. Among the items that Hudson has rated are:
the top ten Hollywood scandal stories, best 44 foot
ball players since 1940. a "good guy" list, a "bad guy"
list, outstanding major league baseballers, top 25
movie stars of all time, best modern songs, top five
pastes lor eating, and the choices ten movies that he
saw for free.
But Mike's most striking—and hardest (o de
scribe—talent is his aliility to size lip in iini<|iic

and humorous terms any situation. lie doesn't have
