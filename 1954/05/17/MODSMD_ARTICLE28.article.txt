## Volunteers Conduct 'Stanford Fund' Drive; Farm Receives $4 Million in Gifts

dealing with University finances.)

Chances are you don't know
them. Many of their names are
listed in pamphlets in the Gen
eral Secretary's office. Some
will never be known by name.
They spend thousands of hours
working for Stanford, giving of their
time and talent and money. With
out them the Stanford of today
would cease to exist.
For together they comprise an
army of volunteers which channels
gifts and possible givers to Stanford.
Their work is directly responsible
for one-fourth of the University's
annual income.
Heading the volunteer list are the
Stanford Associates, a group of 350
alumni and friends of Stanford.
They organized in 1935 as u nucleus
through which annual giving ap
peals would be made.
Their first fund-raising campaign
was to the alumni in 1936. This
marked the beginning of the Stan
ford Fund, which last year brought
$3,985,000 to the University.
The Stanford Fund has two gen
eral divisions — annual appeals and
special gifts, trusts, and bequests.
Since 1930, several individual
schools have set up their own an
nual giving programs as part of
the Stanford Fund. The Stanford
Law School was the first profes
sional school to appeal directly to
its alumni for support.
Since then the schools of medi
cine and engineering have set up
similar funds. Next September the
alumni of the Graduate School of
Business will become the fourth to
sponsor their own annual giving
program.
Alumni from the other schools—
education, humanities and sciences,
and mineral sciences—contribute di
rectly to the Stanford Fund through
the all-University giving program.
Last September a new annua! giv
ing program was established. A
group of non - alumni parents of
Stanford students formed the Stan
ford Parents' Committee.
Approximately 90 per cent of the
parents of students are non-alumni
and it is to this group that the Par
ents' Committee appeals for funds.
All gifts from the Parents' Com
mittee are "unrestricted"—avail
able for use in any manner the
University desires. Only 0 per
cent of all gifts to the University
are unrestricted.

Last year these annual giving
programs contributed $302,000 to
Stanford. Through April 30 of this
year, 9.055 donors had contributed
$394,466, and for the first time in
the University's history, an an
nual giving total of $500,000 is in
sight.
The second source of gifts for the
Stanford Fund comes through the
committee on .special gifts, trusts,
and bequests.
Individuals are one source of spe
cial gifts. Judge Crothers has per
sonally given two graduate dormi
tories. Another outstanding individ
ual gift was Stern Hall, the donation
from the estate of Mrs. Lucie Stern,
who was not a Stanford alumna.
Bequests are another source of
special gifts. In the past six years
they have represented about 28 per
cent of all gifts to Stanford.
In recent years corporations have
added their support to independent
universities, including Stanford.
Business has provided several large
research study giants.
Last month the first appeal for
unrestricted funds was made to
corporations. Two San Francisco
firms responded with gifts of $15,-
000 each.
The staff work necessary to raise
these funds is handled through the
General Secretary's oHice. But all
the asking—and giving—is clone by
volunteers.
The success of their efforts this
year is shown by the $3,042,597
which has been given to Stanford
since last Sept. 1. A record-shat

teeing total of $5,000,000 in gifts may
be reached before Aug. 31.
This expanding gift program is
vital to Stanford, which must face
rising costs with a relatively fixed
income from tuition ami endow
ment. It is the lifeline which as
sures that Stanford will maintain its
position a& a leading independent
university for years to come.

the University's history, an an
nual giving total of $500,000 is in
sight.
The second source of gifts for the
Stanford Fund comes through the
committee on .special gifts, trusts,
and bequests.
Individuals are one source of spe
cial gifts. Judge Crothers has per
sonally given two graduate dormi
tories. Another outstanding individ
ual gift was Stern Hall, the donation
from the estate of Mrs. Lucie Stern,
who was not a Stanford alumna.
Bequests are another source of
special gifts. In the past six years
they have represented about 28 per
cent of all gifts to Stanford.
In recent years corporations have
added their support to independent
universities, including Stanford.
Business has provided several large
research study giants.
Last month the first appeal for
unrestricted funds was made to
corporations. Two San Francisco
firms responded with gifts of $15,-
000 each.
The staff work necessary to raise
these funds is handled through the
General Secretary's oHice. But all
the asking—and giving—is clone by
volunteers.
The success of their efforts this
year is shown by the $3,042,597
which has been given to Stanford
since last Sept. 1. A record-shat

teeing total of $5,000,000 in gifts may
be reached before Aug. 31.
This expanding gift program is
vital to Stanford, which must face
rising costs with a relatively fixed
income from tuition ami endow
ment. It is the lifeline which as
sures that Stanford will maintain its
position a& a leading independent
university for years to come.

Chances are you don't know
them. Many of their names are
listed in pamphlets in the Gen
eral Secretary's office. Some
will never be known by name.
They spend thousands of hours
working for Stanford, giving of their
time and talent and money. With
out them the Stanford of today
would cease to exist.
For together they comprise an
army of volunteers which channels
gifts and possible givers to Stanford.
Their work is directly responsible
for one-fourth of the University's
annual income.
Heading the volunteer list are the
Stanford Associates, a group of 350
alumni and friends of Stanford.
They organized in 1935 as u nucleus
through which annual giving ap
peals would be made.
Their first fund-raising campaign
was to the alumni in 1936. This
marked the beginning of the Stan
ford Fund, which last year brought
$3,985,000 to the University.
The Stanford Fund has two gen
eral divisions — annual appeals and
special gifts, trusts, and bequests.
Since 1930, several individual
schools have set up their own an
nual giving programs as part of
the Stanford Fund. The Stanford
Law School was the first profes
sional school to appeal directly to
its alumni for support.
Since then the schools of medi
cine and engineering have set up
similar funds. Next September the
alumni of the Graduate School of
Business will become the fourth to
sponsor their own annual giving
program.
Alumni from the other schools—
education, humanities and sciences,
and mineral sciences—contribute di
rectly to the Stanford Fund through
the all-University giving program.
Last September a new annua! giv
ing program was established. A
group of non - alumni parents of
Stanford students formed the Stan
ford Parents' Committee.
Approximately 90 per cent of the
parents of students are non-alumni
and it is to this group that the Par
ents' Committee appeals for funds.
All gifts from the Parents' Com
mittee are "unrestricted"—avail
able for use in any manner the
University desires. Only 0 per
cent of all gifts to the University
are unrestricted.

Last year these annual giving
programs contributed $302,000 to
Stanford. Through April 30 of this
year, 9.055 donors had contributed
$394,466, and for the first time in
the University's history, an an
