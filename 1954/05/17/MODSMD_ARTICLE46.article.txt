# ASSU Foreign Scholar: Austria United Despite Red Occupation
## 
### JIM PALMER 
Austria remains united and
democratic today despite the
fact that it is partially occupied
by the Soviet army, asserted AS
SU foreign scholar Erich Hoch
| leitner in a recent interview.
The 23 - year - old graduate Eco
nomics student from Vienna pointed
out the stubborn resistance that his
country has put up against Commu
j nism with the tact that Reds hold
only four seats out <jf 165 in th<J
freely elected Austrian Parliament.
"Austrians ale uncompromising
with Russia," emphasizes Erich.
"They have freedom, democracy,
and live in the easternmost outpost
of the Western way of life. This is
due in a large measure to the Mar
shall Plan, which has poured one
and a half billion dollars into Aus
tria, replacing what Russia took out
by seizure of part of the industry."
Now, states Erich, Austria does
not need any American aid since
production is 180 per cent of pre
war levels due to a complete redress
| of the economy and incorporation of
American economic methods.
"Travel barriers have been com
pletely eliminated," he continued. J
| "and people may go throughout
the entire country unrestricted.
The Russian troops are somewhat J
isolated and have no contact with
the civilian population of Austria." ,

Erich is a graduate of the Univer
sity of Vienna Law School and has
been active in international student
affairs. He has been a member of
the Austrian United Nations League
and international Secretary of the
National Executive Committee of
the European Movement for Euro
pean Federation. He also founded
the magazine "Tomorrow," which is

an official publication of the Union
of Austrian Students, a Christian
Democrat political organization.
He thinks that America can learn
a lot from Europe in the field of cul
ture. "Americans should .see Eu
rope," he declares, "especially Vi
enna, which is one of the cultural
centers of Europe. The exchange
program budget should not be cut,
but expanded to allow more Ameri
can students to visit Europe."
Erich has organized the recent
Main Libe display on Austria. He
believes that people find it much
harder to understand a small coun
try. "Everybody talks about the
problems of Germany, England, and
France, and ignores the achieve
ments that have been made in small
er countries like Holland and Aus
tria."
"Vienna has been occupied since
1938," he states. "We want peace
for our own way of life. But if our
neighbors do not want peace, what
can we do cxcept fight?"
"If Austria turrls Communist,"

Erich summarized, "you can write
off all of Central Europe. Austria
lias kept democratic because of
the strong attitude of its people
and the safeguarding of the con
stitution."
He says American students have
tremendous opportunities when they
graduate from college as compared
with Europeans who don't know
where to work when they get out of
college.
Erich, who plans to get his Mas
ter's degree by the end of the sum
mer, says he doesn't feel like a for
eigner here because "Americans and
Europeans are of one family." He
lived fall quarter at the DU house,
winter quarter with the Alpha Sigs,
and this quarter is staying at the
Kappa Alpha house.

believes that people find it much
harder to understand a small coun
try. "Everybody talks about the
problems of Germany, England, and
France, and ignores the achieve
ments that have been made in small
er countries like Holland and Aus
tria."
"Vienna has been occupied since
1938," he states. "We want peace
for our own way of life. But if our
neighbors do not want peace, what
can we do cxcept fight?"
"If Austria turrls Communist,"

Erich summarized, "you can write
off all of Central Europe. Austria
lias kept democratic because of
the strong attitude of its people
and the safeguarding of the con
stitution."
He says American students have
tremendous opportunities when they
graduate from college as compared
with Europeans who don't know
where to work when they get out of
college.
Erich, who plans to get his Mas
ter's degree by the end of the sum
mer, says he doesn't feel like a for
eigner here because "Americans and
Europeans are of one family." He
lived fall quarter at the DU house,
winter quarter with the Alpha Sigs,
and this quarter is staying at the
Kappa Alpha house.

Austria remains united and
democratic today despite the
fact that it is partially occupied
by the Soviet army, asserted AS
SU foreign scholar Erich Hoch
| leitner in a recent interview.
The 23 - year - old graduate Eco
nomics student from Vienna pointed
out the stubborn resistance that his
country has put up against Commu
j nism with the tact that Reds hold
only four seats out <jf 165 in th<J
freely elected Austrian Parliament.
"Austrians ale uncompromising
with Russia," emphasizes Erich.
"They have freedom, democracy,
and live in the easternmost outpost
of the Western way of life. This is
due in a large measure to the Mar
shall Plan, which has poured one
and a half billion dollars into Aus
tria, replacing what Russia took out
by seizure of part of the industry."
Now, states Erich, Austria does
not need any American aid since
production is 180 per cent of pre
war levels due to a complete redress
| of the economy and incorporation of
American economic methods.
"Travel barriers have been com
pletely eliminated," he continued. J
| "and people may go throughout
the entire country unrestricted.
The Russian troops are somewhat J
isolated and have no contact with
the civilian population of Austria." ,

Erich is a graduate of the Univer
sity of Vienna Law School and has
been active in international student
affairs. He has been a member of
the Austrian United Nations League
and international Secretary of the
National Executive Committee of
the European Movement for Euro
pean Federation. He also founded
the magazine "Tomorrow," which is

an official publication of the Union
of Austrian Students, a Christian
Democrat political organization.
He thinks that America can learn
a lot from Europe in the field of cul
ture. "Americans should .see Eu
rope," he declares, "especially Vi
enna, which is one of the cultural
centers of Europe. The exchange
program budget should not be cut,
but expanded to allow more Ameri
can students to visit Europe."
Erich has organized the recent
Main Libe display on Austria. He
believes that people find it much
harder to understand a small coun
try. "Everybody talks about the
problems of Germany, England, and
France, and ignores the achieve
ments that have been made in small
