ons, put the final polish on their harmony in preparation for the 14th annual Sing, to be held
Friday at 7:15 in Frost Amphitheater. A capacity crowd of eight thousand is expected to again

of less than 15 are automatically entered in the novelty division. Senior Dave Carr will fill
the post of master of ceremonies for the third year. —Daily photo by Chuck Karnopp
