# Sterling: Up to Houses To justify Existence
## Praises Efforts At Improvement 
### 
President J. E. Wallace Ster
ling told fraternity men yester
day in Memorial Auditorium
that it was up to them to justify
the continued existence of fra
ternities at Stanford.
"The burden of proof is on you,"
Sterling said. "But I think your
shoulders are broad enough to carry
it lightly."
At the same time he wholeheart
edly praised the fraternities' efforts
to improve their system, particularly
in regard to the plan whereby the
Interfraternity Council assumes the
responsibility for fraternity disci
pline.
"112, personally, am for you," Ster
ling said, "but only so long as you
seize the opportunities you have bc
lore you to make a positive contri
bution to the University, opportuni
ties which you haven't assumed thus
far."
"Questions are often asked of me
about fraternities," he said. "Many
of the questions take the form of
'What is wrong with fraternities and
why don't you do something to cor
rect what is wrong?'"
To answer these # queries, Sterling
said he_ starts from the basic prem
ise which he applies to every per
son, or group, on the campus: "He
justifies his existence only to the
extent he contributes to the Univer
sity. That is my general proposi
tion."
"Have the fraternities made a
contribution? Is it as great a con
tribution as they are capable of
making?" he asked.
"The fraternities have made a
contribution," he said, "but it is very,
very far short of their potential."
Sterling named three areas in
which fraternities need to make
greater contributions—in matters of
conduct and deportment, in matters
of academic performance, and in
maintenance of private property.
If the fraternities are to justify
their existence, he said, it can only
be done by making real, positive
contributions to the University in
all three matters.
Sterling also said that fraternilie:;
should accept more responsibility,
and therefore he offered his "cordial
and hearty endorsement" of the
IFC's move to take over fraternity
judicial matters.
"I think it is a magnificent step
forward for which you should take
great credit. The net and pointed
effect of these changes is to impose
on your own instrument (IFC) the
responsibility for judicial action
which comes closer to that of other
student organizations."
Speaking about the record of the
fraternities, Sterling said, "Statistics
in the Dean's office rather strongly
suggest that members of fraternities
are above the men's average in the
number of Honor Code violations.
"And in regard to grades, the fra
ternities are traditionally below
men's average."
"The thing that disturbs me most,"
Sterling continued, "is the fact that
there are houses on this campus
which have invited men of high aca
demic promise to join their ranks
and these men have failed to live up
to their promise through the active
and actual degrading influences of
living in a fraternity."
He talked briefly about the liquor
situation on campus: "It is the obli
gation of the officers of the Univer
sity to uphold the law. Wc can only
ask your intelligent understanding
of the situation."
Sterling expressed his personal
annoyance of having to live under
what he called a "double standard":
the custom of drinking and the law.
In reference to property, he com
mented that whether the lawn is cut,
and the edges trimmed definitely
connotes an attitude toward prop
erty and creates an impression with
visitors.

tribution as they are capable of
making?" he asked.
"The fraternities have made a
contribution," he said, "but it is very,
very far short of their potential."
Sterling named three areas in
which fraternities need to make
greater contributions—in matters of
conduct and deportment, in matters
of academic performance, and in
maintenance of private property.
If the fraternities are to justify
their existence, he said, it can only
be done by making real, positive
contributions to the University in
all three matters.
Sterling also said that fraternilie:;
should accept more responsibility,
and therefore he offered his "cordial
and hearty endorsement" of the
IFC's move to take over fraternity
judicial matters.
"I think it is a magnificent step
forward for which you should take
great credit. The net and pointed
effect of these changes is to impose
on your own instrument (IFC) the
responsibility for judicial action
which comes closer to that of other
student organizations."
Speaking about the record of the
fraternities, Sterling said, "Statistics
in the Dean's office rather strongly
suggest that members of fraternities
are above the men's average in the
number of Honor Code violations.
"And in regard to grades, the fra
ternities are traditionally below
men's average."
"The thing that disturbs me most,"
Sterling continued, "is the fact that
there are houses on this campus
which have invited men of high aca
demic promise to join their ranks
and these men have failed to live up
to their promise through the active
and actual degrading influences of
living in a fraternity."
He talked briefly about the liquor
situation on campus: "It is the obli
gation of the officers of the Univer
sity to uphold the law. Wc can only
ask your intelligent understanding
of the situation."
Sterling expressed his personal
annoyance of having to live under
what he called a "double standard":
the custom of drinking and the law.
In reference to property, he com
mented that whether the lawn is cut,
and the edges trimmed definitely
connotes an attitude toward prop
erty and creates an impression with
visitors.


"IT'S UP TO YOU"—President J. Wallace Sterling is shown on
the stage of Memorial Auditorium from which he addressed
Stanford fraternity men yesterday. Speaking of the place of
fraternities, Sterling emphasized that, as with all campus groups,
they must make a positive contribution to the University to
justify their continued existence.
President J. E. Wallace Ster
ling told fraternity men yester
day in Memorial Auditorium
that it was up to them to justify
the continued existence of fra
ternities at Stanford.
"The burden of proof is on you,"
Sterling said. "But I think your
shoulders are broad enough to carry
it lightly."
At the same time he wholeheart
edly praised the fraternities' efforts
to improve their system, particularly
in regard to the plan whereby the
Interfraternity Council assumes the
responsibility for fraternity disci
pline.
"112, personally, am for you," Ster
ling said, "but only so long as you
seize the opportunities you have bc
lore you to make a positive contri
bution to the University, opportuni
ties which you haven't assumed thus
far."
"Questions are often asked of me
about fraternities," he said. "Many
of the questions take the form of
'What is wrong with fraternities and
why don't you do something to cor
rect what is wrong?'"
To answer these # queries, Sterling
said he_ starts from the basic prem
ise which he applies to every per
son, or group, on the campus: "He
justifies his existence only to the
extent he contributes to the Univer
sity. That is my general proposi
tion."
"Have the fraternities made a
contribution? Is it as great a con
tribution as they are capable of
making?" he asked.
