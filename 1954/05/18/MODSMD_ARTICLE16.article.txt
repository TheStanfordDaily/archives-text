# South May Use 'Zoning' To Retain Segregation
## 
### 
ATLANTA, May 18 (UP) —Some Deep South areas may try to
escape the impact of the Supreme Court anti-segregation decree
by "zoning" schools in natural population patterns where the
races live apart, it appeared today.
But Gov. Herman Talmadge of Georgia, the most outspoken of

17 heads of states affected by the H
sweeping decree, recalled that
troops once were mustered in his
state to defy the high court. He in
dicated he would not be averse to
seeing them called up again as a
last resort.
Elsewhere, the traditionally seg
regated South was recovering from
its first jitters over the ruling. Pleas
for calmness and deliberation of the
problems came from newspapers
and public figures with a few ex
ceptions.
Negro leaders also appeared to
wait for the "how and when" hear
ings next fall to determine the ac
tual end of segregation in schools.
Georgia and South Carolina lead
ers still spoke of abandoning their
public school systems in favor of
subsidized private systems. But
elsewhere it. was hoped segregation
could be preserved by less drastic
plans.
There was only scattered predic
tion that the ruling will lead to ac
tual strife in the South. But Editor
Frederick Sullens of the Jackson,
Miss., Daily News wrote on the
front page that "human blood may
stain Southern soil but (he dark red
stains of that blood will be on the
marble steps of the United States
Supreme Court."
From Washington, United Press
reports that the nation's capital has
decided to go ahead with prelimi
nary steps to end segregated schools.
Informed sources,said President Ei
senhower hopes the changeover will
be a model for the rest of the coun
try.
At. the same time, administration
sources said the high court ruling
that segregated school" are uncon
stitutional will "unquestionably" put
more steam behind a drive for mul
ti-million-dollar federal ; id t'i edu
cation —particularly in the South.
