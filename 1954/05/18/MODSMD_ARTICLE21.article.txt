# DAILY EDITORIALS-FEATURES
## Public Relations and Education 
### 
Last week we carried in this column an arti
cle and an editorial on the subject of the dump
ing of the student academic freedom discussion
program at the "request" of the Administration.
The next day, the San Fiancisco Examiner
headlined a story on a month-old speech by a
University of California professor with the irre
sponsible and misleading banner: "U.C. PRO
FESSOR ON FACULTY."
The immediate sequence of the Examiner
story to The Daily articles evidently amused the
Administration. A few days ago. Mr. Fred
Glover, assistant to the president, said with a
laugh that the situation at Cal and the ensuing
publicity strengthened his case and weakened
ours in the question of Stanford's academic
freedom program.
We have two initial reactions:
1. It wasn't funny.
2. The Administration missed the point of
our editorial.
O'ur first reaction is distressing, but consist
ent with many we have had in the past few
years on this type of view toward student ideas
and student activity. There was no respect for
either in that view. There was no sense of the
essential tragedy in the situation at Cal. There
was only a "We told you so" sort of an attitude.
Our second reaction leads us to believe that
we tailed in our purpose in criticizing the Ad
ministration's discouragement of the student
academic freedom program. We had wanted
ihe students to know what happened to that
piogram. But more important, we had wanted
Ihe Administration to do some serious thinking
about its attitude and policy toward student
activity and the apparent dilemma it faces in a
particular type of activity—student discussions
on "controversial" or "touchy" subjects.
Such discussion, or plans'for it, immediately
reminds the Administration of the "public rela
tions" involved. And the public relations fac
tor is the basis for the Administration attitude
that we have described, the attitude that has
led to the discouragement of such worthwhile
activities as discussion on academic freedom.
We acknowledge the importance of public
relations in the operation of a university. We are

aware of the need for any institution to be "pub
lic relations conscious." We know that such
headlines as "U.C. PROFESSOR URGES COM
MIES ON FACULTY" are detrimental to the
reputation and public support of an institution.
But we question the degree to which Stan
ford emphasizes its public relations. If we are
to live and work and speak in constant fear of
the way an irresponsible newspaper might re
port our activities, many of our principles of
education, inquiry, and discussion will soon
become shallow from inactivity.
We see two reasons for Stanford's excessive
emphasis on public relations. Both are sub
stantially sound, and we respect the Adminis
tration for recognizing them.
1. Stanford's financial situation. This Uni
versity is currently financed with a deficit bud
get. It cannot remain that way, and officials
are doing everything in their power to increase
the University's income. One of the primary
sources of income is in the field of gifts and be
quests from private individuals and corpora
tions, many of whom are sensitive to any "con
troversial" or "radical" activities or statements
within the campus.
2. The general "temper of the times." Con
gressional investigations and McCarthyism
have been symptoms of a tendency of a large
segment of the population to judge any liberal
statement or activity as "subversive." Individ
uals and institutions have felt the sting of that
tendency. Stanford doesn't want to be stung.
The need for "good" public relations is thus
apparent.
But, again, we hope that the factor of public
relations in the operation of Stanford does not
become so deified that the students' activities
are confined to carnivals and charity drives.
If other activities, such as the fallen aca
demic freedom program, are to be held, we
agree with the Administration that they should
be done well. The risk of "bad" public re
lations should be minimized. With the respect
ful co-operation of the Administration, the risk
can be reduced.
But it must occasionally be taken—if we are
to leave Stanford truly educated.
