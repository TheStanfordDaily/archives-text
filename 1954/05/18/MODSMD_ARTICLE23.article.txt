# Thanks, From the Con Home

### 
To the Associated Students of Stanford University:
As Superintendent of the Stanford Convalescent
Home, I should like to convey to each and every one
of you our appreciation and thanks for the work
accomplished at the Home on Sam McDonald Day,
May 12.
The entire day was so well organized and we are
deeply appreciative of the great amounUof work which
was done, such as cleaning the entire grounds of
weeds, cleaning up the playground and the area
around the Dormitory Unit, painting 24 outside
benches and toys, and cleaning up the Barbecue urea
afterwards.

At this time I would like to take the opportunity
of expressing our heartfelt thanks for the monthly
entertainment the students put on for the children.
The children look forward to these events with great
anticipation and interest. Our many thanks, too, to
the students who are responsible for conducting the
Sunday School classes.
We are very fortunate indeed to have such a fine
group of young people helping us in our service to
the community and to the children at the Home in
particular.
RUTH ATWOOD
Superintendent
