Tradition, by itself and with a certain amount of
moderation is not a bad thing. It can be, if not run
into the ground, good for the old morale and all of
that guff.
But traditions can lose pace with the times. And

it is obvious that one of the Stan
lord Holy of Holies has done just
that. I refer to the "No Smoking
on the Inner Quad" custom.
Let's face it: People do smoke
on the Inner Quad. In the in
terests of the tradition the Uni
versity has apparently not both
ered to put the. ash stands on
Inner Quad as they did on the
outer rim.
So when a student, instructor,

or staffer comes to the end of his cigarette, he has
no place to place the remains. Consequently, it is
hurled to the ground. Just take a stroll along one of
the colonades of the Quad, anil you'll see what I
mean.
This whole problem dates hack to the days of Mrs.
Stanford, who didn't approve of the habit, and asked
that the students refrain from smoking on the Quad,
that it might not be besmirched with unattractive
fchreds of tobacco.
Times have changed, and with them the attitudes
on smoking. Now it is an accepted thing, and people
expect to be able to smoke practically everywhere
they go.
So here's my idea: The University doesn't have to
come out in favor of smoking on (he Inner Quad;
they don't even have to say they're going to condone
it. Instead, thf»y should quietly and with no fanfare

place a few of the smoking stands around the Inner
Quad, saying nothing.
People may see them, and better yet, use them. And
the snorting traditionalists don't have to smoke on the
Quad, don't have to blast the University for their
action, nor even look at the stands if they don't care
to. Just let the guy who wants to smoke keep the
Quad looking decent.

I've hit some super salesmen in my day, but the boys
behind the Con Home Drive take some sort of a
prize.
A couple of days back, I found stuck under my
windshield wiper the following missive:
"Offense: This heap is filthy beyond recognition.
What color is your paint job?
"Penalty: Report to the Con Home Drive car wash
AT ONCE TODAY to pay the $1 fine. Lathrop, Rus
sell, Stillman, Hurlburt, or Jordan."
Well, 1 can put up with these petty annoyances. But
the thing that really aggravated me was that the
car had just come back from being washed at Stillman
a few short minutes before. Most discouraging.

For the benefit of those who didn't see it, I submit
as boffo of the week the following item in last Thurs
day's Daily, excerpted from the story on the Con
Home Work Day:
"Yesterday's Sam McDonald Day brought scores of
Stanford students to the Convalescent Home to weed,
repair, and generally meet the children."
I wonder what the local . r >97 of the Amalgamated
Child Weeders of America will have to say about
this use of cheap labor.

that it might not be besmirched with unattractive
fchreds of tobacco.
Times have changed, and with them the attitudes
on smoking. Now it is an accepted thing, and people
expect to be able to smoke practically everywhere
they go.
So here's my idea: The University doesn't have to
come out in favor of smoking on (he Inner Quad;
they don't even have to say they're going to condone
it. Instead, thf»y should quietly and with no fanfare

place a few of the smoking stands around the Inner
Quad, saying nothing.
People may see them, and better yet, use them. And
the snorting traditionalists don't have to smoke on the
Quad, don't have to blast the University for their
action, nor even look at the stands if they don't care
to. Just let the guy who wants to smoke keep the
Quad looking decent.

I've hit some super salesmen in my day, but the boys
behind the Con Home Drive take some sort of a
prize.
A couple of days back, I found stuck under my
windshield wiper the following missive:
"Offense: This heap is filthy beyond recognition.
What color is your paint job?
"Penalty: Report to the Con Home Drive car wash
AT ONCE TODAY to pay the $1 fine. Lathrop, Rus
sell, Stillman, Hurlburt, or Jordan."
Well, 1 can put up with these petty annoyances. But
the thing that really aggravated me was that the
car had just come back from being washed at Stillman
a few short minutes before. Most discouraging.

For the benefit of those who didn't see it, I submit
as boffo of the week the following item in last Thurs
day's Daily, excerpted from the story on the Con
Home Work Day:
"Yesterday's Sam McDonald Day brought scores of
Stanford students to the Convalescent Home to weed,
repair, and generally meet the children."
I wonder what the local . r >97 of the Amalgamated
Child Weeders of America will have to say about
this use of cheap labor.

Tradition, by itself and with a certain amount of
moderation is not a bad thing. It can be, if not run
into the ground, good for the old morale and all of
that guff.
But traditions can lose pace with the times. And

it is obvious that one of the Stan
lord Holy of Holies has done just
that. I refer to the "No Smoking
on the Inner Quad" custom.
Let's face it: People do smoke
on the Inner Quad. In the in
terests of the tradition the Uni
versity has apparently not both
ered to put the. ash stands on
Inner Quad as they did on the
outer rim.
So when a student, instructor,

or staffer comes to the end of his cigarette, he has
no place to place the remains. Consequently, it is
hurled to the ground. Just take a stroll along one of
the colonades of the Quad, anil you'll see what I
mean.
This whole problem dates hack to the days of Mrs.
Stanford, who didn't approve of the habit, and asked
that the students refrain from smoking on the Quad,
that it might not be besmirched with unattractive
fchreds of tobacco.
