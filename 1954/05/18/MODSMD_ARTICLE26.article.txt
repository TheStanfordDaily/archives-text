# STANFORD MEDICAL SCHOOL
## A 						'Multitude of Problems' Holds Up Move to Campus 
### Second in a Series By JOHN McFEE 
The consolidation of the Stan
ford School of Medicine on cam
pus is at the present time in a
state of study. Before such a
large undertaking can actually
take place, a multitude of prob
lems — financial, planning, so
cial, and educational—must be
thoroughly ironed out.
To do this, lour University com
mittees are hard at work looking
into the various aspects of the move
— the Trustees' Committee for the
Medical School, the Curriculum
Study Committee, the Committee on
Clinical Teaching, and the Commit
tee on Construction. No definite de
cisions have been reached yet, and
it will involve much time and ef
fort on the part of these pommittees
before all the answers are known.
To assist in this work, the Com
monwealth Fund of New York re
cently granted $210,000 to Stanford
for studying the move and for ex
ploring possibilities of improving
medical education here.
Composed of faculty members, ad
ministrators, alumni, private doctors,
and businessmen, the 20-man Medi
cal School Committee set up by the
Board of Trustees is the body which
will guide the move and advise
President Sterling on consolidation
plans. A major job of this group is
to raise the necessary funds.
"At the moment, it is too early for
a definite budget," said Fred O.
Clover, assistant to the president.
But the following is a broad pic
ture of the financial situation:
Needed altogether ... $30 million
First ftou! for teaching
hospital and main
medical buildings .. $10 million
Second goal for dor
mitories and other
buildings not in
cluded in first goal. $-1 million
Third goal for endow
ment $15 million
So far the University has $1,363,-
000 in funds available and set aside
for the medical school move. The
committee is now looking into ways
of raising the remainder.
The primary work of the Curricu
lum Study Committee is to evaluate
Stanford medical teaching. These 22
men under Dr. Alvin J. Cox, head of
the Pathology Department, are
studying the plan of course? to see
whether or not they can be im
proved either as to order of teaching
or as to content. One suggestion is
to lessen the number of pre-clinical
subjects, completing them in the
latter years. The pre-medical and
post-graduate years are also being
investigated.
It is felt in general that the teach
ing aim should still be to develop
the doctor possessing a broad under
standing of medicine. This will en
able him to go into the type of med
ical work for which he is suited,
whetehr this be private practice, ad
ministration, public health, teach
ing, or research.
On recommendation of the cur
riculum committee is a course in
growth and development seeking to
orient the beginning medical stu
dents .in general problems of man
and his environment. The school
will bring in some man of psychi
atric interest to organize this pro
gram, and there is some chance that
it may be inaugurated next fall.
"The new school will have no
change in number of students ad
mitted per year," said Dean Cut
ting." Sixty - two students allow
close personal contact with the
teachers, whereas if there are many
more than this the faculty cannot
begin to know them."
The 18-man Committee on Clini
cal Teaching has the job of deter
mining how adequate teaching ma
terial for the new school may be se
cured. Under chairman Dr. Victoi
Richards, associate professor of sur
gery, this group will also study the
role of the consolidated sdiool in (lit
Palo Alto community.
One aspect being explored by thi<
committee is how financial costs oi
the school can be lessened througl
dift'erent types of medical service
The committee has pretty well de
cided that the teaching hospital wil
use mostly non - indigent patients

who can pay at least part of their
expenses.
"It is only just," said Dean Wind
sor C. Cutting of the medical school,
"that medical service support medi
cal education, because it stands di
rectly upon it. Yet the primary
function of the medical school is to
educate and not to render medical
service; excessive service would de
tract from the research and teaching
activities ol the faculty. A compro
mise in this dilemma seems* not at
all unobtainable, and it is toward
this that the clinical teaching group
is exploring."
The. Committee on Construction
under Dr. Henry S. Kaplan, head of
the Radiology Department, has as its
objective to locate anil house the
new school on campus. The site is

directly in back of the chemistry
buildings and in front of Sequoia.
Out ide of these four primary
committees, a group under the for
mer Dean, Loren R. Chandler, has
finished its study ol the use and dis
position of the San Francisco build
ings after the move is made. In the
middle of January, in response U)
this study, the Trustees expressed
the hope to the Medical School
Committee thut the Stanford build
ings in the city would continue as
private hospitals under the Stanford
name.
The present work of consolidating
the Stanford Medical School is in
the hands ol these committees. Their
studies will pave the way for the
actual move itself.

studies will pave the way for the
actual move itself.
(To l>e continued tomorrow)
The consolidation of the Stan
ford School of Medicine on cam
pus is at the present time in a
state of study. Before such a
large undertaking can actually
take place, a multitude of prob
lems — financial, planning, so
cial, and educational—must be
thoroughly ironed out.
To do this, lour University com
mittees are hard at work looking
into the various aspects of the move
— the Trustees' Committee for the
Medical School, the Curriculum
Study Committee, the Committee on
Clinical Teaching, and the Commit
tee on Construction. No definite de
cisions have been reached yet, and
it will involve much time and ef
fort on the part of these pommittees
before all the answers are known.
To assist in this work, the Com
monwealth Fund of New York re
cently granted $210,000 to Stanford
for studying the move and for ex
ploring possibilities of improving
medical education here.
Composed of faculty members, ad
ministrators, alumni, private doctors,
and businessmen, the 20-man Medi
cal School Committee set up by the
Board of Trustees is the body which
will guide the move and advise
President Sterling on consolidation
plans. A major job of this group is
to raise the necessary funds.
"At the moment, it is too early for
a definite budget," said Fred O.
Clover, assistant to the president.
But the following is a broad pic
ture of the financial situation:
Needed altogether ... $30 million
First ftou! for teaching
hospital and main
medical buildings .. $10 million
Second goal for dor
mitories and other
buildings not in
cluded in first goal. $-1 million
Third goal for endow
ment $15 million
So far the University has $1,363,-
000 in funds available and set aside
for the medical school move. The
committee is now looking into ways
of raising the remainder.
The primary work of the Curricu
lum Study Committee is to evaluate
Stanford medical teaching. These 22
men under Dr. Alvin J. Cox, head of
the Pathology Department, are
studying the plan of course? to see
whether or not they can be im
proved either as to order of teaching
or as to content. One suggestion is
to lessen the number of pre-clinical
subjects, completing them in the
latter years. The pre-medical and
post-graduate years are also being
investigated.
It is felt in general that the teach
ing aim should still be to develop
the doctor possessing a broad under
standing of medicine. This will en
able him to go into the type of med
ical work for which he is suited,
whetehr this be private practice, ad
ministration, public health, teach
ing, or research.
On recommendation of the cur
riculum committee is a course in
growth and development seeking to
orient the beginning medical stu
dents .in general problems of man
and his environment. The school
will bring in some man of psychi
atric interest to organize this pro
gram, and there is some chance that
it may be inaugurated next fall.
"The new school will have no
change in number of students ad
mitted per year," said Dean Cut
ting." Sixty - two students allow
close personal contact with the
teachers, whereas if there are many
more than this the faculty cannot
begin to know them."
The 18-man Committee on Clini
cal Teaching has the job of deter
mining how adequate teaching ma
terial for the new school may be se
cured. Under chairman Dr. Victoi
Richards, associate professor of sur
gery, this group will also study the
role of the consolidated sdiool in (lit
Palo Alto community.
One aspect being explored by thi<
committee is how financial costs oi
the school can be lessened througl
dift'erent types of medical service
The committee has pretty well de
cided that the teaching hospital wil
use mostly non - indigent patients

who can pay at least part of their
expenses.
"It is only just," said Dean Wind
sor C. Cutting of the medical school,
"that medical service support medi
cal education, because it stands di
rectly upon it. Yet the primary
function of the medical school is to
educate and not to render medical
service; excessive service would de
tract from the research and teaching
activities ol the faculty. A compro
mise in this dilemma seems* not at
all unobtainable, and it is toward
this that the clinical teaching group
is exploring."
The. Committee on Construction
under Dr. Henry S. Kaplan, head of
the Radiology Department, has as its
objective to locate anil house the
new school on campus. The site is

directly in back of the chemistry
buildings and in front of Sequoia.
Out ide of these four primary
committees, a group under the for
mer Dean, Loren R. Chandler, has
finished its study ol the use and dis
position of the San Francisco build
ings after the move is made. In the
middle of January, in response U)
this study, the Trustees expressed
the hope to the Medical School
Committee thut the Stanford build
ings in the city would continue as
private hospitals under the Stanford
name.

the hands ol these committees. Their
studies will pave the way for the
actual move itself.
(To l>e continued tomorrow)
The consolidation of the Stan
ford School of Medicine on cam
pus is at the present time in a
state of study. Before such a
large undertaking can actually
take place, a multitude of prob
lems — financial, planning, so
cial, and educational—must be
thoroughly ironed out.
To do this, lour University com
mittees are hard at work looking
into the various aspects of the move
— the Trustees' Committee for the
Medical School, the Curriculum
Study Committee, the Committee on
Clinical Teaching, and the Commit
tee on Construction. No definite de
cisions have been reached yet, and
it will involve much time and ef
fort on the part of these pommittees
before all the answers are known.
To assist in this work, the Com
monwealth Fund of New York re
cently granted $210,000 to Stanford
for studying the move and for ex
ploring possibilities of improving
medical education here.
Composed of faculty members, ad
ministrators, alumni, private doctors,
and businessmen, the 20-man Medi
cal School Committee set up by the
Board of Trustees is the body which
will guide the move and advise
President Sterling on consolidation
plans. A major job of this group is
to raise the necessary funds.
"At the moment, it is too early for
a definite budget," said Fred O.
Clover, assistant to the president.
But the following is a broad pic
ture of the financial situation:
Needed altogether ... $30 million
First ftou! for teaching
hospital and main
medical buildings .. $10 million
Second goal for dor
mitories and other
buildings not in
cluded in first goal. $-1 million
Third goal for endow
ment $15 million
So far the University has $1,363,-
000 in funds available and set aside
for the medical school move. The
committee is now looking into ways
of raising the remainder.
The primary work of the Curricu
lum Study Committee is to evaluate
Stanford medical teaching. These 22
men under Dr. Alvin J. Cox, head of
the Pathology Department, are
studying the plan of course? to see
whether or not they can be im
proved either as to order of teaching
or as to content. One suggestion is
to lessen the number of pre-clinical
subjects, completing them in the
latter years. The pre-medical and
post-graduate years are also being
investigated.
It is felt in general that the teach
ing aim should still be to develop
the doctor possessing a broad under
standing of medicine. This will en
able him to go into the type of med
ical work for which he is suited,
whetehr this be private practice, ad
ministration, public health, teach
ing, or research.
On recommendation of the cur
riculum committee is a course in
growth and development seeking to
orient the beginning medical stu
dents .in general problems of man
and his environment. The school
will bring in some man of psychi
atric interest to organize this pro
gram, and there is some chance that
it may be inaugurated next fall.
"The new school will have no
change in number of students ad
mitted per year," said Dean Cut
ting." Sixty - two students allow
close personal contact with the
teachers, whereas if there are many
more than this the faculty cannot
begin to know them."
The 18-man Committee on Clini
cal Teaching has the job of deter
mining how adequate teaching ma
terial for the new school may be se
cured. Under chairman Dr. Victoi
Richards, associate professor of sur
gery, this group will also study the
role of the consolidated sdiool in (lit
Palo Alto community.
One aspect being explored by thi<
committee is how financial costs oi
the school can be lessened througl
dift'erent types of medical service
The committee has pretty well de
cided that the teaching hospital wil
use mostly non - indigent patients

who can pay at least part of their
expenses.
"It is only just," said Dean Wind
sor C. Cutting of the medical school,
"that medical service support medi
cal education, because it stands di
rectly upon it. Yet the primary
function of the medical school is to
educate and not to render medical
service; excessive service would de
tract from the research and teaching
activities ol the faculty. A compro
mise in this dilemma seems* not at
all unobtainable, and it is toward
this that the clinical teaching group
is exploring."
The. Committee on Construction
under Dr. Henry S. Kaplan, head of
the Radiology Department, has as its
objective to locate anil house the
new school on campus. The site is

directly in back of the chemistry
buildings and in front of Sequoia.
Out ide of these four primary
committees, a group under the for
mer Dean, Loren R. Chandler, has
finished its study ol the use and dis
position of the San Francisco build
ings after the move is made. In the
middle of January, in response U)
this study, the Trustees expressed
the hope to the Medical School
Committee thut the Stanford build
ings in the city would continue as
private hospitals under the Stanford
name.
