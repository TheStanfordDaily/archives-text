# Coach Taylor 'Satisfied' With Cards; Gridders Compete for Choice Spots
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
More than 100 Stanford foot
ballers took a day off from
spring drills yesterday follow
ing a two-hour scrimmage last
Saturday afternoon and another
hard workout Monday.
Coach Chuck Taylor, the hard
working former All-American line
man who is now preparing for his
fourth year as the Cards' mentor,
was "satisfied" at- the results of the
first 11 days of practice. But he
still saw lots of room for improve
ment. Naturally.
Taylor spoke again this week of
the viciousness of the blocking anil
tackling, the general desire of the
boys to play "rock 'em, sock 'em"
football.
He brought out the fact that there
is more competition for the various
positions than there has been at
Stanford since the war: "There isn't
a single man on the team who can
say, 'This is my position.'"
There is a real struggle at this
early date for the guard positions
where lettermen Matt Armitage and
Hoy Krickeberg are expected to hold
forth. Freshmen Donn Carswell and
Don Manoukiun are making strong
bids for the posts.
Sophomore Don Kafka, who saw
lots o? action with the Braves, has
taken the lead for the quarterback
spot with Jack Gebert, who was
Boh Garrett's understudy last year,
on the sidelines with a bum ankle.
Kafka's passing and ball handling

were sharp in the scrum Saturday.
He fired a spot pass to ond Jack
Rannells for one of the afternoon's
six touchdowns.
But Gordy Young, the fast-scam
pering irosh halfback from Poly
| High, received the majority of the
' plaudits Saturday. Young, who
I broke 01 lie Matson's San Francisco
prep scoring record, shook loose for
several long gains and also looked
I good on defense.
His runs set up the first tally
I which Jerry Gustafson finally took
I over from in close on a quarterback
j sneak. Young picked up a six
! pointer himself a little later, skirt -
i ing end for 20 yards.
j A 25 - yard pass interception by
| Hon Bush accounted for one TD
| and 34- and 16-yard runs by half
| back Ernie Dorn and quarterback
j John Brodie produced the final two.

ERNIE DORN
—Scores TD in scrum
More than 100 Stanford foot
ballers took a day off from
spring drills yesterday follow
ing a two-hour scrimmage last
Saturday afternoon and another
hard workout Monday.
Coach Chuck Taylor, the hard
working former All-American line
man who is now preparing for his
fourth year as the Cards' mentor,
was "satisfied" at- the results of the
first 11 days of practice. But he
still saw lots of room for improve
ment. Naturally.
Taylor spoke again this week of
the viciousness of the blocking anil
tackling, the general desire of the
boys to play "rock 'em, sock 'em"
football.
He brought out the fact that there
is more competition for the various
positions than there has been at
Stanford since the war: "There isn't
a single man on the team who can
say, 'This is my position.'"
There is a real struggle at this
early date for the guard positions
where lettermen Matt Armitage and
Hoy Krickeberg are expected to hold
forth. Freshmen Donn Carswell and
Don Manoukiun are making strong
bids for the posts.
Sophomore Don Kafka, who saw
lots o? action with the Braves, has
taken the lead for the quarterback
spot with Jack Gebert, who was
Boh Garrett's understudy last year,
on the sidelines with a bum ankle.
Kafka's passing and ball handling

were sharp in the scrum Saturday.
He fired a spot pass to ond Jack
Rannells for one of the afternoon's
six touchdowns.
But Gordy Young, the fast-scam
pering irosh halfback from Poly
| High, received the majority of the
' plaudits Saturday. Young, who
I broke 01 lie Matson's San Francisco
prep scoring record, shook loose for
several long gains and also looked
I good on defense.
His runs set up the first tally
I which Jerry Gustafson finally took
I over from in close on a quarterback
j sneak. Young picked up a six
! pointer himself a little later, skirt -
i ing end for 20 yards.
j A 25 - yard pass interception by
| Hon Bush accounted for one TD
| and 34- and 16-yard runs by half
| back Ernie Dorn and quarterback
j John Brodie produced the final two.
