# Nine Trips Broncos 7-4 in Final Game of Season
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
WASHINGTON PARK, May 18 Stanford wound up its baseball
season on a happy note today as it bested Santa Clara 7-4 in a
three hour and 15 minute skirmish at the Bronco's Washington
Park ball yard.
The victory, comipg on the last day of the CIBA season, gave

| Stanford sole possession of
| place. The Indians finished the sea- I
j son with an overall mark of 18 and j
12 '
Senior Mike Acker went the dis- 1
; tance for Everett Dean's crew and
| after shaking ofi a three run Bronco
j outburst in the second, settled down
I to scatter seven walks and three hits
j in the process of giving up a run.
! The win was a team effort as six |
j of the regulars got hits and seven |
I starters tallied. In all Stanford
I banged out eight singles and a dou
ble. Warren Goodrich, Al Talboy,
and Len Swartz each collected two
safeties.
The Cards scored once in their
initial at bat. Hall led off with a
double down the left field line and

Goodrich, in Stanford regalia for the
last time, singled into left field to
score Hall.
In the Santa Clara second, two
singles aVid a walk got one and then
Ted Welp hammered home two more
with a triple.
Loose fielding and timely hitting
put Dean's charges in front with a
five run uprising in the fourth. Dan
durand started the inning with a
single to center and move to second
on Talboy's one baser to center. Bob
Evans went safe at first when the
Broncos failed to get Dandurand at
third. Swartz singled to score Dan
durand and the bases remained
loaded.
After George Selleck bounced to
third forcing Talboy at home, Acker
grounded to third and the third
sacker threw into the dirt at home
allowing Evans to score. Hall walked
to force in Swartz. Scramaglia then
grounded to deep second for an in
field hit. Gus Suhr, electing to make
the play anyway, fired past the first
sacker. Selleck and Acker scored,
but Hall was cut down trying to come
in.
/
A Goodrich single and stolen base,
an error on Dandurand's grass cut
ter and a Talboy single gave the
Cards their seventh run.
The pesky Broncos attempted to
get back in the game in the eighth,
but after Acker balked a run home
with the bases loaded he proceeded
to pitch out of the jam by striking
out Otto Schleich.
Bill Carroll, Bronco sophomoi'e
flychaser, failed to beat out Cal's
John Derdivanis for the batting
crown as he went hitless in four
trips. Evidently smoldering from his
poor stickwork, he picked a fight
with Selleck at game's conclusion.
Cooler heads prevailed, however, and
the brawl was quickly broken up.

—In Stanford regalia for last time
WASHINGTON PARK, May 18 Stanford wound up its baseball
season on a happy note today as it bested Santa Clara 7-4 in a
three hour and 15 minute skirmish at the Bronco's Washington
Park ball yard.
The victory, comipg on the last day of the CIBA season, gave

| Stanford sole possession of
| place. The Indians finished the sea- I
j son with an overall mark of 18 and j
12 '
Senior Mike Acker went the dis- 1
; tance for Everett Dean's crew and
| after shaking ofi a three run Bronco
j outburst in the second, settled down
I to scatter seven walks and three hits
j in the process of giving up a run.
! The win was a team effort as six |
j of the regulars got hits and seven |
I starters tallied. In all Stanford
I banged out eight singles and a dou
ble. Warren Goodrich, Al Talboy,
and Len Swartz each collected two
safeties.
The Cards scored once in their
initial at bat. Hall led off with a
double down the left field line and

Goodrich, in Stanford regalia for the
last time, singled into left field to
score Hall.
In the Santa Clara second, two
singles aVid a walk got one and then
Ted Welp hammered home two more
with a triple.
Loose fielding and timely hitting
put Dean's charges in front with a
five run uprising in the fourth. Dan
durand started the inning with a
single to center and move to second
on Talboy's one baser to center. Bob
Evans went safe at first when the
Broncos failed to get Dandurand at
third. Swartz singled to score Dan
durand and the bases remained
loaded.
After George Selleck bounced to
third forcing Talboy at home, Acker
grounded to third and the third
sacker threw into the dirt at home
allowing Evans to score. Hall walked
to force in Swartz. Scramaglia then
grounded to deep second for an in
field hit. Gus Suhr, electing to make
the play anyway, fired past the first
sacker. Selleck and Acker scored,
but Hall was cut down trying to come
in.
/
A Goodrich single and stolen base,
an error on Dandurand's grass cut
ter and a Talboy single gave the
Cards their seventh run.
The pesky Broncos attempted to
get back in the game in the eighth,
but after Acker balked a run home
with the bases loaded he proceeded
to pitch out of the jam by striking
out Otto Schleich.
Bill Carroll, Bronco sophomoi'e
flychaser, failed to beat out Cal's
John Derdivanis for the batting
crown as he went hitless in four
trips. Evidently smoldering from his
poor stickwork, he picked a fight
with Selleck at game's conclusion.
Cooler heads prevailed, however, and
the brawl was quickly broken up.
