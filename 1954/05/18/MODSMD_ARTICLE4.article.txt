## 
### 
Fresh opposition has risen to the location of the Veterans Ad
ministration neuro-psychiatric hospital on Stanford land at Juni
pero Serra Boulevard and Page Mill Road.
The Los Altos Elementary School District trustees went on rec
ord against the proposed location of the hospital Monday night.

' A Sarron Park group began cir
culaitng a petition asking the Board
of Trustees not to sell the land to
the Veterans' Administration at the
same time. Sale of the land would
require a friendly condemnation suit
because of provisions in the Univer
sity's founding grant.
The Board of Trustees will con
sider the VA's request for ap
proval of the hospital "in prin
* ciplc" at tomorrow's Board meet
ing. The request, a short letter
received by the University last
week, was the % first official move
by the VA in selecting and nego
tiating for a site for the planned
$23 million institution.
Opposition to the hospital was in
troduced to the regular meeting of
the Los Altans by the Board of
Trustees chairman, who reported
talking with Menlo Park school offi
cials regarding problems of neuro
. psychiatric hospitals near schools.
Board members then directed Su
perintendent Ardis Egan of the Los
Altos Elementary School District to
j write a letter of opposition to the
! proposed location to the Stanford
Board of Trustees.
The petition now circulating
among Barron Park parents op
poses the location of the hospital
at Junipcro Serra and Page Mill
with four main arguments:
1. This location would be within
a quarter of a mile of three elemen
tary schools. The hypothetical five
escapees a week, the average of the
Menlo Park VA Hospital, would
j constitute a danger to these chil
j dren.
2. Once the land is sold, Stanford
! would have no control over its ad
i ministration—residents would have
' to rely on a Washington bureau.
3. If the inmates arc harmless,
why are they confined in the first
place?
4. Escapees have been under strict
! control for long periods of time,
I and once free they will not act as
! ordinary citizens will act.
