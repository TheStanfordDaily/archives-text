# Insect World Is Pictured In Series Talk
## 
### GERRY SMITH 
"Insects have been much ma- 1
ligned," Dr. Edward Ross began
last night at the Tuesday Eve- 1
ning Series in Memorial Audi
torium.
"I consider myself an ambassador j
of the insect world," he continued. |
But insects "can't be described with j
words—you need pictures." Even 1
with these, "it is impossible to get ;
more than just a kaleidoscopic view" j
of the myriad species.
With many slides dealing with all j
manner of insects to illustrate his ,
lecture, Ross related interesting !
facts about insect life in general. He
mentioned that insects found in mu
seums lose much in both color and |
posture. Therefore, his slides showed
insects in their natural surround- j
ings.
In describing paiticular insects, i
Ross called them anything from j
"green-eyed" to "sinister but cute."
He told the audience that "for every
insect on earth there are an infinite
number of predators and parasites."
He described the insect food chain, i
with one insect eating another, who j
eats another, and so on.
While showing a slide of a group !
of eggs with one worm emerging, j
Ross said, "This shows why Com- t
munism will never work—one worm
always comes out ahead of the oth
ers."
Everything is out to get you if you
are an insect, Ross emphasized. '
Camouflage is one effective means of |
avoiding destruction. Another is a \
bad taste, but "you're just as dead j
a bug if you're tasted as if you're I
eaten."
