## Discussion Centers On Libe, Exam Honor System 
### PAT KING Associate Editor, The Daily 
Two facets of the Honor Code —the use of the library and taking
tests out of examination rooms —drew prolonged discussion from
Executive Committee members last night.
Kathy Padgett of the Fundamental Standard Committee reported

that library officials want a definite
policy of student responsibility for
violation of library rules. This policy,
she said, could be placed either
under the jurisdiction of the Honor
Code or of the Fundamental Stand
ard.
Miss Padgett cited four specific
problems faced by the library which
need student controhmutilation ot
books, using false names on library
cards, walking off with books, and
general misconduct in the library.
"General misconduct," she ex
plained, covers situations arising
from students who have lit fires in
the stacks or walked off with drawers
from the card catalogue.
After discussion of the present
problem Excom passed two motions:
First, problems arising from use of
the library will be placed under the

jurisdiction of the Fundamental
Standard Committee as a violation of
I lie Fundamental Standard, not as an
Honor Code violation.
Second, that the Fundamental
Standard Committee shall delegate
the responsibility for handling li
brary problems to a student library
committee.
This committee will set up an ad
ministrative program to handle li
brary violations.
Honor Code discussion then shift
ed to the question: Should a definite
policy be made regarding the taking
of examinations from the examina
tion room?
Men's Hall Representative Bob
Mishell moved that a policy state
ment be placed in the freshman ori
entation booklet prepared by the
Fundamental Standard Committee
reading that:
"Professors will state before ex
aminations whether or not they fa
vor tests being taken from the room.
If the professor is against taking
tests from the room, and the stu
dent wants to go out, the student
may question the professor and give
his reasons why he wants to leave
the room. Faculty members are
asked to state their views on the
subject at the beginning of the
quarter."
Mishell withdrew the motion atfer
further discussion in which John
Sprague, sophomore class represen
tative, suggested that any definite
policies on this question should be
left up to the Fundamental Stand
ard Committee.
A motion by Jim Mitchell, gradu
ate representative, was passed which
struck from the Honor Code report
submitted last week these three pol
icy recommendations:
1. Close co - operation between
students and faculty in specific
classroom situations.
2. Possibility of requesting to
leave the room and asking the pro
fessor his reasons for not wanting
I lie tests taken out.
.'5, Possibility of leaving the room,
but staying in the Quad area.
Excom felt that these recommen
dations might be too binding and
might not apply to all situations.
However, Excom suggested that
these recommendations be used by
the Fundamental Standard Commit
tee in its faculty orientation pro
gram.
Further discussion on the Honor
("ode was tabled until the proposed
program of student-faculty orienta
tion has had a fair trial next year.

A report recommending dirpct
primary and finiil ASSU elections
was accepted by Ex com for action
next week. Details will be given
in tomorrow's Daily. Excom also
approved Ann Powell as Election
Hoard chairman for next year.

tion has had a fair trial next year.

A report recommending dirpct
primary and finiil ASSU elections
was accepted by Ex com for action
next week. Details will be given
in tomorrow's Daily. Excom also
approved Ann Powell as Election
Hoard chairman for next year.
Two facets of the Honor Code —the use of the library and taking
tests out of examination rooms —drew prolonged discussion from
Executive Committee members last night.
Kathy Padgett of the Fundamental Standard Committee reported

that library officials want a definite
policy of student responsibility for
violation of library rules. This policy,
she said, could be placed either
under the jurisdiction of the Honor
Code or of the Fundamental Stand
ard.
Miss Padgett cited four specific
problems faced by the library which
need student controhmutilation ot
books, using false names on library
cards, walking off with books, and
general misconduct in the library.
"General misconduct," she ex
plained, covers situations arising
from students who have lit fires in
the stacks or walked off with drawers
from the card catalogue.
After discussion of the present
problem Excom passed two motions:
First, problems arising from use of
the library will be placed under the

jurisdiction of the Fundamental
Standard Committee as a violation of
I lie Fundamental Standard, not as an
Honor Code violation.
Second, that the Fundamental
Standard Committee shall delegate
the responsibility for handling li
brary problems to a student library
committee.
This committee will set up an ad
ministrative program to handle li
brary violations.
Honor Code discussion then shift
ed to the question: Should a definite
policy be made regarding the taking
of examinations from the examina
tion room?
Men's Hall Representative Bob
Mishell moved that a policy state
ment be placed in the freshman ori
entation booklet prepared by the
Fundamental Standard Committee
reading that:
"Professors will state before ex
aminations whether or not they fa
vor tests being taken from the room.
If the professor is against taking
tests from the room, and the stu
dent wants to go out, the student
may question the professor and give
his reasons why he wants to leave
the room. Faculty members are
asked to state their views on the
subject at the beginning of the
quarter."
Mishell withdrew the motion atfer
further discussion in which John
Sprague, sophomore class represen
tative, suggested that any definite
policies on this question should be
left up to the Fundamental Stand
ard Committee.
A motion by Jim Mitchell, gradu
ate representative, was passed which
struck from the Honor Code report
submitted last week these three pol
icy recommendations:
1. Close co - operation between
students and faculty in specific
classroom situations.
2. Possibility of requesting to
leave the room and asking the pro
fessor his reasons for not wanting
I lie tests taken out.
.'5, Possibility of leaving the room,
but staying in the Quad area.
Excom felt that these recommen
dations might be too binding and
might not apply to all situations.
However, Excom suggested that
these recommendations be used by
the Fundamental Standard Commit
tee in its faculty orientation pro
gram.
Further discussion on the Honor
("ode was tabled until the proposed
program of student-faculty orienta
tion has had a fair trial next year.
