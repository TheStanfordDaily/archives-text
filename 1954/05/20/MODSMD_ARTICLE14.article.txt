### 
WASHINGTON, May 19 (UP) —
Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy (R., Wis.)
accused the Eisenhower administra
tion today of "criminal folly" in
granting money to U.S. allies who
ship "the sinews of military and eco
nomic strength" to Red China.
Foreign Aid Chief Harold E. Stas
sen promptly denounced McCarthy's
statement as "fantastic, unbeliev
able, and untrue." He accused Mc-
Carthy of "reaching toward diver
sionary headlines after the sorry
spectacle of his record in the recent
hearings."
McCarthy launched a bitter attack
on the Senate floor against "Ameri
can-sponsored blood trade" between
this country's allies and "an enemy
v/ho i.s presently directing the war
in Indochina—a war in which our
American young men may have to
fight and die."
Hr> said the United States could
deny Communists most of the
world's merchant .shipping "by sirn
j ply telling our allies that they will
I not get one American dollar while
j any of their flag ships are plying this
immoral, dishonest, and indecent
trade."
If shipping were deriir-d the Reds,
McCarthy said, "the war in Indo
china would dry up and die over-*
night."
Stassen stated, '"We are steadily
! building for peace under President
I Eisenhower's leadership . . . The full
{ report of our successful administra
tion of trade control is contained in
the detailed report submitted to
I Congress Monday."
Stassen said the shipment of
! weapons of any type, conventional
jor unconventional, to Red China,
i the Soviet Union, North Korea, or
any Communist countries has been
banned, is banned, and will continue
to be banned by the U.S., by Great
Britain, and by all the co-operating
countries of the free world.
