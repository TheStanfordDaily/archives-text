# Fraternities and the Future
## 
### 
President Sterling gave a remarkably clear
and forceful explanation of the Administration's
position in regard to Stanford's 23 fraternities
when he spoke to fraternity men Tuesday after
noon in Memorial Auditorium.
He emphasized that fraternities here can be
justified only to the extent that they contribute
to the University.
He made it perfectly clear that the fraternities
have made some contribution to Stanford, but
that they have fallen "very, very far short" of
their potential.
The President then outlined the three areas
in which fraternities have not lived up to their
potential. These areas, he said, are conduct
and deportment, academic performance, and
the maintenance of private property.
Dr. Sterling heralded the plan whereby the
Interfraternity Council will assume disciplin
ary powers over the houses, and the plan to
provide each house with a resident assistant,
similar to the program now used in the various

campus dormitories.
The President offered his "cordial and hearty
endorsement" of the new disciplinary plan.
We, too, feel that it gives the IFC responsibility
for judicial action which comes closer to that
of other student organizations.
The Administration's present position on
Stanford fraternities is now perfectly clear and
a matter of public record.
We wonder how many fraternity men
thought about what prompted the calling of the
Tuesday afternoon meeting as they listened to
the President's speech. We wonder how many
considered how Dr. Sterling's statements re
lated to the long-range position of Stanford fra
ternities.
If, as President Sterling charged, fraternities
are not living up to their potential—are not con
tributing enough to the University, we wonder
just how great and important these shortcom
ings are, and what will be their result a quarter,
a year, or even longer from now.
