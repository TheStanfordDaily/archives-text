## Political Union—'Opportunity’ 
### 
To the Editor:
On May 26 the Political Union will hold its last
meeting of the year and elect new officers. This ASSU
administrative board has come a long way since last
October. It has acquired a small group of active
members, brought a good program of political speak
ers to campus, and, through the Union's Republican,
Democrat, and Independent caucuses, begun to build
a grass-roots system of participation for- Stanford stu
dents.
To the University administration, especially the
Public Exercises Committee, and to the faculty who
assisted the Union in, its program, I offer thanks for
their co-operation.
To those students who have worked hard for the
Political Union, especially the Executive Board 1 owe
a debt of gratitude

p lo those students who have participated in the I
Union's program, even as spectators, I hope it has ;
been an enlightening and enjoyable experience.
To the Democrat or Republican "by birth right"
(who is either tradition, emotion, or wealth bound),
to the superficial Independent (who thinks all poli
tics are dirty and sometimes that anyone interested
in them is crooked or dishonest), and to those students
who have never examined their ideas about politics,
and who are in the great majority at Stanford, I sug
gest that you could best take advantage of the op
portunities that the Political Union offers and ex- j
pose yourself to opinions other than those you learned
at home,
WAYNE P. FULLER
President,
Stanford Political Union |
