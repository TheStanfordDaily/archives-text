# A 						Spark for 'Perpetual Interest'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Once again another Con Home Drive lias become re
duced to a report in the ASSU file* and u check in
the Con Home coffers tiut this year it is especially the
fond hope of the chairmen that the past week of events
will remain in the collective thoughts of the student
body the coming year as a spark to kindle a perpetual
interest in this worthy cause situated so close to the
core and foundation of our University.
A special word of thanks we would extend to those
1,000 of you solicitors, gardeners, painters, hoers, car
nival "barkers," car washers, boot blacks, auction
eers, tag vendors, brunch waitresses, cooks, thespians,
and event chairmen— who gave so generously of your
time and energy. And to you .thousands of others who

gave magnanimously with ydur money and good wish
es, we owe the financial success of our cause.
But the success of the Con Home Drive is not always
measured in dollars and cents—it is measurable in
the good will it creates for the Home and its deserv
ing occupants. And from the enthusiastic participa
tion evidenced by all of the student body, the Drive
was even more of a success in this light than we dared
anticipate.
For this, our thanks go with the thanks of the chil
dren and staff at the Con Home, to you.
