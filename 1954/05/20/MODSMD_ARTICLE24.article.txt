# STANFORD MEDICAL SCHOOL
## Med Buildings Will Be Hub Of Campus ‘Science Circle' 
### Third in a Series) By JOHN McFEE 
Although plans for the corisol
idated Stanford Medical School
are still in the 3tudy stage, a
number of ideas concerning the
move have been generally
agreed upon by the University.
The new school will be situated
I on what is now a fiat, grassy area
| directly behind the Chemistry*
Anatomy, and Bacteriology build
ings. Here will be constructed three
to five years from now a teaching
I hospital, medical laboratories, a
school of nursing, and other essen
j tial medical science buildings.
Dormitories for medical students,
| nurses, interns, residents, and others
j attending the school will be built
later.
"We hope to have the medical
j school as one unit of a greater sci
i ence circle," said Medical School
Dean Windsor C. Cutting. If pro
! posed plans mature, physics will be
housed in new structures across the
street from where it is now located,
thus bringing it closer to the Micro
wave Laboratory. Biology will then
expand into Physics Corner. This
arrangement will provide a rough
circle of the various science depart
ments.
In the middle of this "circle" will
be a medical library, believed to be
best located diagonally across from
Physics Corner. Right now there i.s
much discussion on the possibilities
of expanding thik into an all-science
library.
The design ant! types of build
ings in the medical portion ol' the
circle have not yet been decided,
j An architect will probably he
brought in soon to advise on this
J matter.
j However, present discussion in
! dirates that a teaching hospital of

| around 250 beds will he best. The i
anatomy and bacteriology huild
i ings will probably remain as they j
are now.
The essential medical science j
building will be completely con- i
structed before any moving is done, i
The actual moving of equipment
from San Francisco to the new i
school will most likely be accom- j
plished during the summer months,
Meanwhile, another problem in
planning exists 30 miles away in San
Francisco where the major part of
the present medical school is: What
shall be done with these buildings
after the move?
Situated on Clay, Sacramento, and
Webster Streets in the city, these
buildings consist of the 180 - bed
Lane teaching hospital, the 130-bed
Stanford Hospital, the Lane Medical
Library, the Stanford School of
| Nursing, the Ruth Lucie Stern Re
| search Laboratory, and the Clinical
! and Laboratory Building which in
[ eludes the out-patient clinic.
Lane Hospital is used almost en-
I tirely for indigent cases, whereas
j the more modern Stanford Hospital
i is for private patients only and op
| erates at a profit. The school, in co
i operation, with the San Francisco
Department of Health, has the use of
! around G5O beds in the San Fran
| cisco County Hospital.
In January, former Medical
School Dean Loren R. Chandler's
committee, set up to study the
problem of what to do with these
facilities when the move comes,
expressed the hope that the pres
ent school would continue as a
private hospital under Stanford's
| name. These buildings, it was
pointed) out, comprise the mcdichl
home for many city doctors who
will he unable to come down here
; when the school does.
Before this, a group of Stanford
j clinical faculty members arose spon-

I taneously under Dr. Robert Scar
: borouyh to express a de-ire for us
! ing these buildings after the move,
j They want mainly to reorganize the
J Stanford Hospital for greater efli
| ciency, as they recommended to the
I trustees'' committee.
Converting the present medical
school facilities itno a postgraduate
! medical school was an early sug
| geition r'made by the clinical group.
I "However, the idea ot a postgradu-
I ate school of medicine has not
! proved to be too attractive to the
! administration," said Dean Cutting.
Several new bits of scientific ap
paratus —a mycology laboratory, an
artificial kidney, a small G-million
volt linear accelerator —are being
installed at the San Francisco school
in spite of the fact that the decision
to move has been made.
"Research never stops even in an
interim period," explained Dr. Cut
ting.
All of these new projects were
scheduled a long time before the
decision to move. However, both the
mycology lab and the artificial kid
ney can easily be transported to the
new school when the time comes.
The linear accelerator now be
ing built will allow the school to
know quite a bit about such an
j instrument before coming to the
campus. When the move occurs.
J there is a possibility of using the
campus accelerator for medical
j purposes as it is close to the site
| for the new school.
j The planning of the consolidated
| Stanford Medical School i.s in its
j beginning stages only. Architects,
I planners, and committee members
j must study the situation thoroughly,
| At the same time solutions to the
j other problems will be found.
When all studies are completed
| and the necessary money is raised,
I | the time for moving will be very
• | close at hand.
