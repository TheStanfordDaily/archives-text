# Frosh Horsehiders Earn Praise of Coach Clegg
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
"This frosh team is the best I have ever seen from the standpoint
of material and potential ability." In these words, Coach Dick
Clegg summed up his opinion of the baseball squad he piloted to
a 10 -3 season record.
The toughest game of the year comes up for the Cleggmen

when they challenge the varsity on
the Sunken Diamond Friday after
noon in a post-season contest.
In regular- season play the frosh
dropped three games to first - rate
high school ball teams. St. Ignatius
topped the Cards, 4-2; Sacred Heart
edged them out, 5-4; and Oakland
Technical High School slipped by
on the right end of an 8-6 count.
These losses can be chalked up, to
a large extent, to experience. While
the squad was pretty green at the
stui-t of the year, under Clegg's
guidance it shaped up rapidly. The
frosh made a clean sweep of the
Cal series, taking the first two games
by fairly close margins, then break
ing loose for a solid 10-5 victory in
the last game of the series.
After a long mid-season batting
slump, the club pulled up to a
very respectable .283 season aver
age for the team. For individual
honors ri,*ht fielder Hap Wagner
put on a torrid campaign at the
plate to overtake shortstop Kudy
Figueroa. Wagner ended up with
an average of .400 —10 hits in 25
atempts. Figueroa easily earned
second place with his .375 aver
age. garnering 15 hits in 40 trips,
.to the plate.
The pitching staff did itself proud
in building a gaudy 2.06 earned-run
average. Big right-hander Ray Loo
ney was tops in this department
with his sparkling 1.12 average. Ed
Verdurmen was pressing Looney for
first place with his 1.41 ERA.
Verdurmen compiled a 4-1 season
record. Dick Jones went 3-2, and
Dave Bohnen tallied a 3-0 record.
Looney and Don Petters finished at
2-0 and 1-0, respectively.


UNTAMED FURY —Caught above in an informal shot are four
members of the power-laden freshman squad. Left to right,
Captain Bob Fletcher (.358); Dale Metcalf (.259); Tom Murray
(.350); and Hal Messner (.321), prepare to sharpen up their bat
ting eyes in anticipation of tomorrow's Varsity-Frosh battle.
