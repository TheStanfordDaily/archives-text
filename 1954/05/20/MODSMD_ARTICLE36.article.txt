# Gaughran-‘Athlete of Week'
## 
### 
A blond senior from Redwood City
who smashed a Pacific Coast Con
ference swimming record last Satur
day and helped to crack another
was named The Daily's Athlete of
the Week.
Jim Gaughran, captain of Tom
Haynie's mermen, swept over the
100 - yard freestyle course in the
California meet and was clocked in
the blazing time of 51 seconds flat.
The previous PCC record of :51.6
was held by Jim Smith of UCLA,
set in 1950.

Earlier, Gaughran turned in a :50
freestyle lap for the 300-yard med
ley relay team as it broke the old
conference mark of 2:51.8 with a
convincing 2:50.7.
Gaughran has been active in Stan
ford water sports now for three
years. Last year, he won the 50- and
100-yard freestyle events at the PCC
championships and is looking for a
repeat this year.
In the fall, Jim was co-captain of
the championship Indian water polo
team and was leading scorer in the
Southern Division. In addition, he
was named on the All-Conference
teams for 1952 and 1953.
The blond bomber barely missed
going to the Olympics in 1952 when
the Whittier Swim Club, for which
he was playing forward, lost to the
El Segundo Club by one point in the
finals of the water polo trials.
