## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
"Bit O' Seasoning," this year's aquacade put on by the Stanford
Swim Club, was all in all a well co-ordinated and original show,
highlighted by a solo done by Sally Phillips, a member of the na
tional champion synchronized swimming team.
The show, given in the Women's Gym, centered around the

theme of the passing of the four sea-*
sons.
Miss Phillips, in her rendition of I
"Jack Frost," combined precision, a
theatrical sense of movement and J
expression, and grace in transition j
from one pattern to another to pro- I
ducc a sparkling performance.
A few of the other acts, especially
where larger numbers of girls wore
required to perform, lacked in pre
cision, but these faults were gen
erally overshadowed by the varied
program, good choice of music, and
clever, precise character of the oth
er acts.
An excellent change of pattern
movement was shown in the act
movement was shown in the act
"Snowfiakes," where 15 girls formed
the crystal patterns of snowfiakes in
the water.
A spritely exhibit of pollywogs'
antics in a lily pond was given by
Dion Zachcs, Mugs Stanley, and
Nancy Smallcy, who paddled and
splashed in the manner of young
frogs in appropriate, well-synchro
nized tricks.
The second performance of the
show will be given tonight at 8:30
at the Women's Gym.
