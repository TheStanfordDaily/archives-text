# Stanford May Buy Village
## 
### 
The status of the Stanford Village
took a new turn yesterday when the
possibility of Stanford being given
first option to buy the 85-acrc hous
ing development in Mcnlo Park
gained strength.
This development was announced
by Arthur Chladck, assistant direc
tor of the San Francisco field office
of the Public Housing Administra
tion, which is handling the govern
ment's negotiations for relinquish
ment of the property
Chladek said that the University
would be contacted this week .to be
gin negotiations, but as of last night
no word had been received by Uni
versity officials. However, a Univer
sity spokesman stated that the Uni
versity would be willing to consider
buying the Village.
Mcnlo Park reacted calmly to the
possibility of Stanford acquiring the
land rather than Menlo Park. Men
lo Park Councilman Charles P. Bur
gess stated, "Wc don't care who
they sell it to. We are in complete
agreement with Stanford. Either
way, it will turn out all right."
Several months ago the mayor
and city manager of Menlo Park
went to Washington and obtained
what was thbught. to be a tentative
agreement to sell the property to
Mcnlo Park.
