## 
### 
A group of Stanford sophomores—all of whom claim to bo
ardent Republicans—yesterday launched a campaign to distribute
buttons bearing the motto, "McCarthy for Fiihrer," on college
campuses throughout the nation.
The four Bill Metcalf, Ben Harris, Vern Clinton, and Wayne

Mall all Stern residents, laid claims
to the stunt which they* they said has
"exceeded all expectations,"
They explained that the whole
project is nothing more than a good
natured jibe aimed at Senator Jo
seph R. McCarthy.
Letters, explaining the purpose
of the red and white buttons, have
been mailed to major universities,
including Harvard, Princeton,
Cornell, Columbia, and UCLA.
The letters state:
"It cannot he expected that the
distribution of these buttons can
