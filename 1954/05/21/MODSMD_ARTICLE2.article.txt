# Euripides Play Is 'Absorbing'
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
The Stanford Players' current re
vival of Euripides' classical adven- |
j ture story, "Iphigenia in Tauris," is
more melodramatic than exalted and j
best when it is neither. It is most ab- J
sorbing when it tries least hard.
Even the most capable of the Play- j
ers, despite their blameless diction,
apparently lack the high order of;
ability needed to do more than de- |
claim Greek drama. Throughout the
play's first act, when the characters
are revealed and their relationships [
established, there is a constant tend- !
ency to confuse loudness with dra
matic intensity.
The actors shout and snarl and
roar through their lines, but only
rarely do they stir the audience to a J
more than academic interest. With a j
tone so constantly feverish, there j
can be little room for climaxes.
The second half is more down to
earth, less demanding, and better'
done. The action here is the main
interest, and Euripides carries his j
own weight.
Patrick Wymark. as the mesenger, j
brings the production its best few
minutes. His monologue suggests the
quality the whole play might have j
had. Virginia Royce (Iphigenia) h is
a voice which, despite a certain
forced often proves a
rich and flexible tool.
The chorus is handled with pre
cision, imagination, and considerable
dramatic effect. Instead of being an
anachrosism, it often seems the only
alive thing on the stage. Too often,
however, a powerful effect is ruined
by the almost embarrassing overact
ing of some of the individual chorus
members.
"Iphigenia" is, in sum, an ambitious
and demanding venture. The per
haps inevitable fact that its execution
falls short of its potentialities djesj
not make its virtues insignificant.
