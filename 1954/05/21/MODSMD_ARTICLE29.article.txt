# Time, Space, and Money
## 
### 
Lately we've been thinking about time and
space and the almighty dollar.
We've watched the publication of 64 issues
of The Daily, and we're suddenly aware that
there is only one week left, only five more is
sues of the paper around which we have built
our lives for the past year.
The time is precious. There is much at and
about Stanford that deserves comment. There
are situations that demand explanation. And
there is the usual vast amount of news that
should be printed.
But, today, as on every day that we sit down
to begin the process of publication, v/e are
aware of oux greatest antagonistâ€”space. The
rigid borders of the columns and the pages are
unmoving, and we must cut and slash at the
written lines of news and explanation and com
ment.
The effects are occasionally frustrating.
Right now we are reminded of the special arti
cles we had planned, tire editorial comments

that have been muted, the news items that have
been slashed to the bone. We think about the
requests of campus organizations, the demands
of publicity chairmen, the complaints of stu
dent leaders. They are valid requests, de
mands, and complaints, and we hear them. But
our "friend" space v/ill not move for them.
The business manager tells us that our finan
cial situation stinks, thus the problem of space, j
V/e must run many ads in every issue, because
the ads make money and a story on the work
of the lIR does not. But business conditions
are bad, and we cannot get enough ads for more
than just an occasional six-page paper. And if
we don't hurry, hurry, hurry to fill up the space
we do have, v/e will lose money.
And so we are aware that many facts will go
unprinted, many comments will remain silent,
and many questions will not be answered. For
this, we apologize, to our staff, to the students,
and to Stanford.
But we are using up time and space and
money with such an apology. So we will stop.
