### PETE GROTHE 
THE BANISHMENT OF A QUEEN
A queen has just been banished.
The queen is Cheeta, the spider monkey who was
swept into royalty by last week's Con Home vote.
She and Pogo Q. Ape are probably the first two simi
ans to sit in rule over 7,000 human

beings.
But the queen has been ban
ished. And I have had to do the
banishing. It's like this: I go to
Fort Ord this June. Under no
circumstances will the Army lake
a monkey. I couldn t find anyone
to keep Cheela for two years, so
I did the next best tiling- I found
her a permanent home, it's a good
home, tOo, and the new owner

promised me I could have the first offspring when I
get out of the Army.
And this is fine, but it won't be the same as Cheela.
I remember Cheeta when I first picked her up in
the steaming tiopical lush of Southern Mexico last
summer. She was sickly, nervous, and mean. And I
watched her develop until she is now affectionate and
the embodiment of super-vitality and mischievous
ness. She is also a character. Witness some of the
following examples:
A few week l ago, I was driving from San Mateo to
Stanford with Cheeta in the car. A cop was behind
me, and I wai; doing the exact speed limit, 35 miles per
hour. Suddenly. Cheeta pounced on the foot that was
on the ga i peddle and hung on to it. The resultâ€”l

started rocketing along at 50 miles per, a flashing red
light appeared behind me, and 1 was hailed to the
curb. When I tried to explain to the gendarme that I I
sped because a spider monkey jumped on my foot,
he was prepared not only to give me a ticket, but also
to drag me off, to the drunk ward.
When Cheeta was tied up in front of the Cellar |
last week for the Con Home polling, she succeeded ;
in swiping (mostly with her tail) from human beings: |
(1) three fudge ban;, (2) a girl's sash, and (3) four;
cups of coffee.
The yeai-and-a-half-old monkey will never walk i
when she can get a ride. She treats my pet collie like j
a horse and rides him all around the house. Cheeta
takes particular pleasure in riding him backwards.
Cheeta, who has the face of the end man on the
minstrel line and the body of a basketball center,
loves a good drink. More than once, she has been suc
cessful in grabbing a cocktail from an unsuspecting
imbiber and downing it before he can recover it. If
you think Cheeta is a character sober, you ought to
see her drunk.
Cheeta is essentially a creature of the jungle. She
cannot be trained. She does what she wants. But if
she is an uncontrollable character, she is also at once
affectionate. Anyone whom she likes, she will put her
arms aroutod and kiss on the side of the ear. And in
contrast, she can leave mild tooth imprints on anyone <
who teases her.
I gave her away yesterday. Her new owner told me
that I could have the first offspring when 1 get out of
the Army.
But it won't be the same.
