# Med School to Emphasize Research and Development
## 
### Last in a Series) By JOHN McFEE 
The Stanford School of Medi
cine will form the backbone of
a large medical community
whan it is consolidated on cam
pus. The extent of this commun
ity will depend to a great extent
on the relationships between the
school and other hospitals and
services in the area.
"Stanford University is interested
in community health," said Medical
School Dean Windsor C. Cutting,
"but on the research and develop
ment level, not primarily in service."
In light ol this, it is not the inten
tion of the university, to have the
new school render any great amount
of ordinary medical care to the
Palo Alto area. The present feeling
is that the school will care for the
clinical teaching patients, and will
serve- as a consultative group to
which any doctor in the region can
turn lor advice on difficult cases.
The much-taiked-about Veterans
Administration Psychiatric Hospital
which may be built on Stanford land
at Page Mill Road and Junipero
Sena* Boulevard, would be a very
good thing for the medical school
First, Stanford would probably get
around 250 endowed beds in the new
structure. This would save the uni
versity a great deal of money which
would otherwise be spent in building
a larger teaching hospital. Second,
Stanford would be given the chance
to expand its studies in the field of
psychiatry.
The VA has requested University
approval of the hospital "in princi
ple," which will be considered at
the May 20 Board of Trustees meet
ing. The hospital, if built, will havt
around 1,000 beds, one fourth of
which would be for general medical
care, the rest for psychiatric cases.
"Both types," said Dr. Cutting,
"would be of use to us."
There has also been some talk in
the newspapers of building the Let
terman Army Hospital somewhere in
this area also, but the progress of this
has not gone along as far as that of
the VA hospital. "It would be nice
for us if the Letterman hospital
moved here," said Dean Cutting.
"The more medical facilities we have
the better off we will be. However,
we have no direct suggestion that
this is likely."
"Our contact with the Palo Alto
Hospital will be friendly and close."
The school's main use of this hospi
tal, which is owned by Palo Alto
and administered by Stanford, will
probably lie in providing space for
the private patients of the clinical
professors, who would have their
own practices outside of teaching.
Plans of the city of Palo Alto indi
cate that this hospital will be en
larged soon.
"The new school will have no spe
cial affiliation with any group of
doctors, such as the Palo Alto Clin
ic. or the Santa Clara County Medi
cal Society," pointed out Dr. Cut
ting. "We want to be friendly to all
groups of doctors."
There are also other facilities in
the immediate area with which the
new medical school hopes to have
close connections. These include the
Convalescent Home and the present
VA hospital in Menlo Park.

"Stanford University is interested
in community health," said Medical
School Dean Windsor C. Cutting,
"but on the research and develop
ment level, not primarily in service."
In light ol this, it is not the inten
tion of the university, to have the
new school render any great amount
of ordinary medical care to the
Palo Alto area. The present feeling
is that the school will care for the
clinical teaching patients, and will
serve- as a consultative group to
which any doctor in the region can
turn lor advice on difficult cases.
The much-taiked-about Veterans
Administration Psychiatric Hospital
which may be built on Stanford land
at Page Mill Road and Junipero
Sena* Boulevard, would be a very
good thing for the medical school
First, Stanford would probably get
around 250 endowed beds in the new
structure. This would save the uni
versity a great deal of money which
would otherwise be spent in building
a larger teaching hospital. Second,
Stanford would be given the chance
to expand its studies in the field of
psychiatry.
The VA has requested University
approval of the hospital "in princi
ple," which will be considered at
the May 20 Board of Trustees meet
ing. The hospital, if built, will havt
around 1,000 beds, one fourth of
which would be for general medical
care, the rest for psychiatric cases.
"Both types," said Dr. Cutting,
"would be of use to us."
There has also been some talk in
the newspapers of building the Let
terman Army Hospital somewhere in
this area also, but the progress of this
has not gone along as far as that of
the VA hospital. "It would be nice
for us if the Letterman hospital
moved here," said Dean Cutting.
"The more medical facilities we have
the better off we will be. However,
we have no direct suggestion that
this is likely."
"Our contact with the Palo Alto
Hospital will be friendly and close."
The school's main use of this hospi
tal, which is owned by Palo Alto
and administered by Stanford, will
probably lie in providing space for
the private patients of the clinical
professors, who would have their
own practices outside of teaching.
Plans of the city of Palo Alto indi
cate that this hospital will be en
larged soon.
"The new school will have no spe
cial affiliation with any group of
doctors, such as the Palo Alto Clin
ic. or the Santa Clara County Medi
cal Society," pointed out Dr. Cut
ting. "We want to be friendly to all
groups of doctors."
There are also other facilities in
the immediate area with which the
new medical school hopes to have
close connections. These include the
Convalescent Home and the present
VA hospital in Menlo Park.
