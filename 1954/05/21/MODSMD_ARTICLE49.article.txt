Here it is! The Daily's 1954 All-CIBA baseball team.
USC's power-laden championship aggregation placed four men
on the mythical nine. Stanford and Cal each placed two, and
UCLA and Santa Clara each had one plyer.
The only unanimous choice was Stanford's ace shortstop and

J team captain, Warren Goodrich. The
; crew-cut senior from La Jolla led
J the league in stolen bases, and over
| the season was Stanford's leading
i hitter, although a cut hand ham
pered him in the last four CIBA
I games and he ended with a league
j average of only .240.
John Garlen earned the cat fil
ing spot on the team. Garten led
the CIBA with Hi Kill's and hit
.2(10 for the Trojans, as well as
playing heads-up defensive ball.
Al Bates was UCLA's lone repre

♦
tentative. The steady first baseman
ended up fourth in league batting
with a .322 average. Bates is a
spray hitter and a good glove man.
Cal's Don Walker made the team at
the keystone sack. Walker hit .277
and led Cal with 18 base hits. Walk
er, a long ball hitter, finished Stan
ford's championship hopes with a
two-run homer off Phil Page last
weekend.
At third base was the first of
three USC sophomores who made
the team. Bill Faddis. Faddis, a
[ star as a freshman last year,
moved in to hit .2!)4 in his first
j year of varsity competition.
j The outfield consisted of the three
top hitters in the CIBA John Der
divanis, Cal, .304; Bill Carroll,
Santa Clara, .349; and Tony Santino,
USC, .333.
! The t,wo pitchers named by the
! sports scribes were both sophomore
righthanders, portending trouble for
hitters in the next, two v*»ars.
Young finished, the season with an
0.98 ERA and a 5-2 mark. Six un
earned runs caused the first loss,
and Marty Stiles shut out the In
dians in the other. Zuanich won
four, lost one, and had an ERA of
