# Sally Phillips Performs 'Flamingo' With Ease
## 
### LEE HANSEN 
Two legs rising out of the water,
turning a half twist, and then finally
submerging out of sight—this is the
most difficult of water ballet stunts,
the "flamingo''; and Sally Phillips,
twice national AAU group synchro
nized swimming champion, is a past
master of it.
Seventeen years ago, a two-year
old was learning to swim at Clear
Lake with the assistance of her two
big brothers. A year later she was
taking lessons at the Women's Club
in Oakland, and by the time .she was
six, Sally was entered in speed com
petition.
From the time she was eight until
her twelfth birthday Sally spent her
time trying to see just how fast she
could get through the water. When
she was twelve she joined the
Athens Club and began synchro
nized swimming—water ballet..
Four years later, Sally and five
other girls entered the Junior
National Synchronized Swimming
Championships in Long Beach. The
six of them had performed their
"water 'Can Can' " for pool openings

and other shows, but this was their
first time in competition. The girls
"who didn't even expect to place"
j took second.
Later the same year, after a long
! weary bus ride to Detroit—financed
!by ''one-night-slop aquacades"—
they took second in the senior na
tionals. The following year, enthused
i by their successes, they formed a
; quartet which won both the AAU
Jr. Indoors Meet and the AAU Sr.
Outdoors Meet, with a "Four
Queens" routine. The "Four Queens"
became the kings of synchronized
swimming — Sally Phillips, Lynn
Pawson, Joan Pawson, and Dawn
! Pawson Beam.
In 1953 they changed their routine
j from the "Alice in Wonderland"
; card queens to four "Trojan War
j riors," complete with Swords and
i shields. They took second to a Ca
j nadian team at the outdoor AAU
meet in Orlando, Florida, and came
j back to win first in the indoor meet
in April, 1954.
Work has been included with
pleasure as the troup traveled east
' to their various meets. Last summer
the group spent days on a USO
1 tour„Previously they had been wined
and dined by 20th Century Fox
while helping m;:ke the Cinema
scope short, "Dancers of the Deep.",
And for recreation- what does
Miss Sally Phillips do? Swimming,
; naturally! For the past two summers
I she has taught swimming for the
Oakland Recreation Department.
Currently she is donating her time
to Wilbur Junior High in Palo Alto,
helping them with an aquacade.
At Stanford, Sally has been WAA
swim chairman and past director of
the aquacade. This week she again
demonstrated her .skill as "Jack
Frost" in the WAA swim show, "Bit
! o' Seasoning." She is also serving as
WAA vice president and will be La
gunita's representative to ASSU Ex
com next fall.
At the present time, Sally and her
three partners are busy practicing
for an exciting summer. They will
tour Japan and Korea with a USO
troup.

"who didn't even expect to place"
j took second.
Later the same year, after a long
! weary bus ride to Detroit—financed
!by ''one-night-slop aquacades"—
they took second in the senior na
tionals. The following year, enthused
i by their successes, they formed a
; quartet which won both the AAU
Jr. Indoors Meet and the AAU Sr.
Outdoors Meet, with a "Four
Queens" routine. The "Four Queens"
became the kings of synchronized
swimming — Sally Phillips, Lynn
Pawson, Joan Pawson, and Dawn
! Pawson Beam.
In 1953 they changed their routine
j from the "Alice in Wonderland"
; card queens to four "Trojan War
j riors," complete with Swords and
i shields. They took second to a Ca
j nadian team at the outdoor AAU
meet in Orlando, Florida, and came
j back to win first in the indoor meet
in April, 1954.
Work has been included with
pleasure as the troup traveled east
' to their various meets. Last summer
the group spent days on a USO
1 tour„Previously they had been wined
and dined by 20th Century Fox
while helping m;:ke the Cinema
scope short, "Dancers of the Deep.",
And for recreation- what does
Miss Sally Phillips do? Swimming,
; naturally! For the past two summers
I she has taught swimming for the
Oakland Recreation Department.
Currently she is donating her time
to Wilbur Junior High in Palo Alto,
helping them with an aquacade.
At Stanford, Sally has been WAA
swim chairman and past director of
the aquacade. This week she again
demonstrated her .skill as "Jack
Frost" in the WAA swim show, "Bit
! o' Seasoning." She is also serving as
WAA vice president and will be La
gunita's representative to ASSU Ex
com next fall.
At the present time, Sally and her
three partners are busy practicing
for an exciting summer. They will
tour Japan and Korea with a USO
troup.


OUTSTANDING—SaIIy Phillips, twice a member of the AAU
championship synchronized swimming team, plans to tour
Japan and Korea this summer as a member of a USO tour. At
present, Sally is directing the WAA show, "Bit O' Seasoning."
Two legs rising out of the water,
turning a half twist, and then finally
submerging out of sight—this is the
most difficult of water ballet stunts,
the "flamingo''; and Sally Phillips,
twice national AAU group synchro
nized swimming champion, is a past
master of it.
Seventeen years ago, a two-year
old was learning to swim at Clear
Lake with the assistance of her two
big brothers. A year later she was
taking lessons at the Women's Club
in Oakland, and by the time .she was
six, Sally was entered in speed com
petition.
From the time she was eight until
her twelfth birthday Sally spent her
time trying to see just how fast she
could get through the water. When
she was twelve she joined the
Athens Club and began synchro
nized swimming—water ballet..
Four years later, Sally and five
other girls entered the Junior
National Synchronized Swimming
Championships in Long Beach. The
six of them had performed their
"water 'Can Can' " for pool openings

and other shows, but this was their
first time in competition. The girls
"who didn't even expect to place"
j took second.
