# Spikemen Trek To Modesto For Trackfest
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Stanford's varsity and freshman
track stars, minus high jumper John
j Stewart, trek to Modesto along with
i a bevy of the nation's best cinder
j aces tomorrow for the annual Cali
| fornia Relays. *
Stewart and hurdler Gerry r ood
I were previously slated to compete
j in the Coliseum Relays tonight in
Los Angeles, but both are passing up
the Southland attraction. Stewart
I has decided to rest this weekend and
! Wood, who has had a slight cold,
j only wants to run in one night meet.
The Indians will be up against
j much the same competition they
faced last week at Fresno, plus an
undetermined number of other stars
who have been attracted to tonight's
event at the Coliseum. Two or three
plane loads of athletes will be flown
j from Los Angeles to Modesto.
Possible entries at Modesto in-
I elude Hector Hogan, the Australian
I dashman who hit 9.3 in the 100;
I Chuck Holding, the East Texas high
jumper who is credited with seven
foot jumps in practice; Dean Smith,
the classy sprinter from Texas; and
i Parry O'Brien, the world's greatest
shot putter.
Smith, Hogan, and Joe GrafTio of
the Trojans should stage a red-hot
race in the century. Smith has done
9.4 and Graffio won at Fresno in
9.6. Keith Brownsberger, who has a
9.8 to his credit, will run for the
Tribe.
Leo Long, who now holds the
school record in the javelin at 233-
11, will hook up in another tussle
with Bill Miller, who won the open
event at Fresno, and Bud Held, for
mer Stanford star who now holds
the world record.
Indians Bob Kimball and John
Bugge will be trying for more 200-
I foot throws and runner-up points.
Wood and Jack Davis of the Los
! Angeles Athletic Club (ex of SC)
j will probably be the class of the
120-yard high hurdles field as they
were at Fresno. Wood should be
able to give Davis a close race if he
can avoid bumping into the barriers.
The Cards' Jim Luttrell is ready
to go again and will team up with
Wood in the high hurdles.
The Indians' l'our-man 880 relay
squad of Ed Fremouw, Jim Saras,
Walt Garrett, and Brownsberger
trailed SC's sprint quartet last week,
but the competition should be a
little rougher at Modosto. Smith and
his Texas teammates will probably
be there.
The Cards' 880 team of Larry Spi
cer. Wood, Garrett, and captain Fred
George got down to an unofficial
3:15.2 last week, but that doesn't
come close to the times of some of
the other teams.
Other Stanford varsity entrants
are Bob Reed and Chuck Strong in
the open mile, A 1 Cheney and Phil
Brabyn in the shot, Bill Flint in the
pole vault, and Fremouw in the
broad jump.
