## 
### 
This afternoon at 3:15 the time
honored story of David and Goliath
will be enacted once more. Dick
Clegg will lead his frosh baseball
nine onto the Sunken Diamond, hop
ing that Everett Dean's varsity is not
as big as it looks.
The frosh will be facing everything
the varsity has to throw at them. At
the last report Dean was planning to
use Ray Young, Don DeLong, Phil
Page, and Ken Brown on the mound.
The frosh are depending on Ed Ver
durmen and Ray Looney, their two
big righthanders, to stop the varsity
at the plate. Verdurmen (4-1) walked
only 13 men and struck out 29 bat
ters during the 51 innings he pitched

j this year. Looney (2-0) leads the
i frosh hurlers with his fine 1.12
earned run average.
One question mark in the frosh
line-up is shortstop Rudy Figueroa.
Figueroa sprained an ankle this week
and it is not known if he will bo in
j shape to play. If the .375-hitting
Figueroa is unable to play, John Dito
will probably be shifted over from
the outfield to fill the vacancy.
Tom Murray and Dale Metcalfe
will share the catching assignment
i for the yearlings. Beppo Dyer will
start at first. Captain Bob Fletcher
will be in his usual second base po
sition. Fletcher's .979 fielding per
-1 centage was tops on the squad.
