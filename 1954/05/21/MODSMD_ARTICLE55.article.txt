# Hopeful Crew Meets Powerful Bears
## 
### BOB DURAND 
"Beat Cal" has been the cry
ringing throughout the Stanford
boamouse this week as coach
Harry Buchalter's Indian oars
men went through final work
outs for ihe Big Race with Cali
fornia tomorrow.
Four Card crews will make the
journey to the Oakltind Estuary
where the .'hells from the two
chools will dual tomorrow
nini( at 2 p.m.
The first race will feature a 2,000-
meter sprint between the second
freshman boats, which will be fol
lowed by two-mile encounters by
the fir t freshman and JV eights at
<i:3O and 3:15. The varsity sweep
swingers will square off in a three
mile? a/Tair starting at 4.
All races will finish at the Fruit
vale Avenue bridge.
The Bears will be hungry for a
win after their humiliating six
length walloping at the bands of
the Washington Huskies last Sat
urday. The Northerners also swept
the junior varsity and frosh events
by substantial margins.
However, the Indians too will he
on the warpath as they have not
won a varsity race from the Cal
crew since the duel became an
annual affair in 1947. According
to Coach Buchalter, this year's
boat "can do it."
The fir. t yearling eight, coached
by Frank Jameson, are especially
hopeful for a triumph over the Cal
Cubs. A strong victory could mean
a pos ible trip to the National Re
gatta at Syracuse in June.

this time was the frosh boat three years ago. And three boys from that boat, Pete Paup, Dick
Flynn, and Bill Findlay are rowing their last Bi \ Row tomfcirow.

the junior varsity and frosh events
by substantial margins.
However, the Indians too will he
on the warpath as they have not
won a varsity race from the Cal
crew since the duel became an
annual affair in 1947. According
to Coach Buchalter, this year's
boat "can do it."
The fir. t yearling eight, coached
by Frank Jameson, are especially
hopeful for a triumph over the Cal
Cubs. A strong victory could mean
a pos ible trip to the National Re
gatta at Syracuse in June.
