## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Stanford's improved tennis team
opens its second southland tour this
afternoon by challenging USC's net
squad on the Figueroa Street courts.
Tomorrow Jack Frost and company
move across town over to Westwood 1
to see if UCLA really deserves its
title of number onj collegiate team, j
On their last southern junket the j
Cards met nothing but disaster as j
USC pulled a surprise 5-4 upset and '
the Uclans whitewashed them 8-1.
Farm players making the trip down i
yesterday were Frost, Art Fish, Gary
Gray, Jim Cornish, Henry Sutcliffe, I
Dave Duff, and Bob Norton. The
first six will play the singles matches
Doubles teams will be Frost-Gray,
Fish-Cornish, and Duff-Norton.
Frost, the power-laden sophomore
from Monterey, has been playing a
greatly improved game recently. Last
week Frost slashed his way into the
finals of the State Tennis Champion
ships at the California Club before
losing to Seth Peterson in three sets.
In reaching the finals Frost amazed
the galleries by defeating Nick Car- j
ter and Hugh Stewart, both of whom j
had been considered better than '
Frost.
USC's number one player, Jacque
Grigrey, should give Frost little
trouble today. In their last meeting
Frost blasted Grigrey, 6-3, 6-4. Grig
rey is ranked 25th in the nation.
Art Fish, Stanford's number two
singles man, will have a more diffi- !
cult time of it with his opponent, I
Alan Cleveland. However, Fish came '
close to upsetting Cleveland in their '
last match. Fish won the first set
6-3, and Cleveland the second, 6-4. j
In the deciding set Fish was leading
five - love, 40-15, when Cleveland j
rallied to take the set 7-5.
UCLA has ample reason for being
called the nation's best college team.
Heading their team list is Bob Perry,
Davis Cupper and 'currently rated
12th nationally. Number two player
is Ron Livingston, of basketball
fame. Livingston was a surprise final- j
ist in the NCAA tourney last year. [
suffering defeat at the hands of LSU's |
Ham Richardson.

Frost will give Perry a real battle
lor their match. Earlier in the .sea
son Perry was barely able to slip
by Frost, 11-9, 0-4. Frost is now
playing much better tennis than he
was then.
Fish was shellacked 6-3, 6-2, by
Livingston. The sole Stanford vic
tory came when Jim Cornish edged

out little Jimmy Head, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1
Much ol the outcome of the two
matches could depend on the doubles.
Fish and Cornish Are an experienced,
steady combination, while Frost and
Gray have started to work together
nicely. Tile Frost-Gray duo reached
the semifinals in the state tourney
before losing a match.
