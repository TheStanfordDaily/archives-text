tween candidates who arc sincerely

they are running she said.
Under the proposed system, I lie
following rules would apply:
1. Only the top two students in
the primary election would run
in the final election.
2. Write-in candidates would be
legal in the primary election, but
not iu the final election.

tions, instead of four as may be done
now, would unnecessarily limit the
choice of worthy candidates.
