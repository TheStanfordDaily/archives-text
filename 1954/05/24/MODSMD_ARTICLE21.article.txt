### BARNEY CHILDS 
The last chamber music concer • of
the year yesterday in Cubbevley w, ;
devoted to the music of visitinq com
poser Henry Cowell Both man and
music were received enthusiasti
cally.
The first half of the concert pit
sented three of Cowell's pieces
instrumental groups and a nuinhei
of choral settings. I am afraid J
found practically all of it duH.
composer <■> consistent in his ap
proach, and handles each instru
ment well, but his use of the dia
tonic modal material that has bee.;
tagged "American" often seems
painfully self-conscious. A lack of
ideas is only partially compen
sated for by proliciency in werkiu •;
out each instrument's contribution
to ensemble.
The performances were generally
good. The wind, quintet "Suite," • >
slight four-movement structure pL
ing with polytonality, and the "Tall
Tale" for brass sextet, an affable and
craftsmanly treatment, of bras:; sr.
nority, were the least boring, but the
choral works and the string quartet
were pretty dismal.
The second half of the conccit
more than made up for the first
Mr, Cowell played some of his ear!
"tone cluster" piano compositions
These call for the use of lists, for
arms, and elbows, much to <ljc
mirth of the Greater Palo Alto Old
People's Home in attendance. De
spite these pieces' age, their ono. i.
ties and effects are still exciting.
The program note sententious!;/
and incorrectly implies that the b '
of the European contemporaries "put
to use" Mr. Cowell's developmeiv
This is unfair to Mr. Cowell and to
American music. The true benefici
ares of these ideas have been me>•
like Riegger, Ives, and John Ci
and through this Cowell has done
more toward shaping a truly national
musical idiom than through any use
of modes and folk tunes.
