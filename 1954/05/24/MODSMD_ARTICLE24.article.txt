# Preferential or Direct
## 
### 
We've learned from our mislrkes this year.
And no phase of campus activity has shown
this as much as elections. Sure, we've had
some fouled-up messes with more elections
void than valid, but Excom's election commit
tee has recognized the value of the innovations
in the recent final elections and made further
suggestions to avoid future confusion.
These are the recommendations:
1. Djop the preferential system in favor of a
direct primary and final. Only the top two
students in the prirrmry election would run in
Ihe final election.
2. Make write-in candidates legal in the pri
mary election, but not in the final election.
3. Establish one central polling booth in the
Library area.
4. Schedule two-d<iy elections for both the
primaries and finals, with perils closing at 1:30
p.m. the second day.
5. Continue use of the Village election booth
from 1 1:30 am. to I:3G p.m.
G. Continue use of the IBM machine, with

appropriation of funds for new printing plates, i
Most of the recommendations have met with
little opposition. But the recommendation to
abolish the preferential in favor of a direct pri-j
mary and final electioii is far from being a clear
case in which we honestly approve or oppose.
Rather, we are conscious of strong arguments
both pro and con.
The argument in favor of this change is that
elimination of the preferential system would !
encourage only those students who are really |
interested in the office, would encourage better
campaigning, and would encourage campaign
ing on specific issues.
The arguments of the opposition are that the
restriction of the final election to two candidates j
would unnecessarily limit the choice of worthy '
candidates and v/ould not insure better cam- 1
paigning or campaigning on specific issues.
We're not yet sure that we fully endorse the
new suggestions, but we definitely feel that
they deserve serious consideration and a fair j
and complete trial.
