# The
						Air Force Letter
## 
### 
After much discussion, over whether or not
they should take a definite stand on a political
issue, the Executive Committee voted Wednes
day night to send a letter to Washington pro
testing the Air Force's decision not to grant
commissions to oil seniors who complete the
Air Force ROTC program this year.
Several Excom representatives argued that
making a recommendation on such a "political"
issue was beyond their jurisdiction, and the
first vote on the proposal ended in a deadlock.
We feel that Excom should be commended
for their final decision to send the lettei to Sen
ators Knowland and Kuchel, vice-president
Nixon, and Air Force Secretary Talbot.

Since the Wednesday night meeting, the Air
Force has reversed itself and decided to award
|
commissions to all 4,840 college seniors who
have completed the four-year program in 188
United States colleges and universities. This
reversal shows that government decisions are
not irrevocable and can be changed by the in
troduction of new information or the develop
ment of strong public opinion.
Excom's decision to take a positive stand on
the Air Force issue does not indicate that they
are trying to make themselves lobbyists or
even that they are becoming preoccupied with
national politics. It does, rather, show that they
are willing to exercise their duty as spokesmen
for the Stanford student body.
