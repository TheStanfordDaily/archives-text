# Employment Committee Permits Sale of Buttons
## 
### BOB REZAK 
The Student - Faculty Employment Committee Friday unani
mously approved an application filed by sophomore Bill Metcalf
lor a permit to sell "McCarthy for Fuhrer" buttons on the campus.

Another sophomore, Michael C. ,
Hudson, had last week objected to j
the granting of the permit on the
grounds that selling the buttons was i
illegal.
The committee, composed of four i
students and three faculty members, j
reached its decision after a nearly [
three-hour closed session.
Don Starr, committee chairman,
in a letter to Metcalf, said the per
mit was granted on the condition
that the buttons are not stored in
student rooms and that methods of
merchandising are not "obnoxious |
or of a nuisance character."
The eommitiee explained, how- !
ever, that Metcalf may store the |
buttons in his automobile or oft
campus.
The letter warned that no "door- j
to-door solicitation or merchandis- !
ing headquarters on campus may be !
maintained."
Starr said Metcalf's previous!
method of solicitation and the .stor
ing of buttons in his room had con- j
stituted a violation of the rules as i
defined in the statement of Univer- I
sity policy regarding solicitation and
business representation on the cam
pus.
Starr said the committee felt 1
that Metcalf and his colleagues, i
Ben Harris, Vern Clinton, and
Wayne Mall, had not "willfully
violated" the rules but that vio- |
lation had occurred because of
"unawareness" of the committee's
existence. •
"It is felt," Starr's letter stated,
"that the student body generally has
not been adequately informed re
garding campus solicitation."
The committee emphasized that
granting the permit "in no way
should have the effect of endorsing,
recommending, or subscribing to the
merits of the principles involved"
in the button venture.
In learning of the decision Hud
son issued the following statement:
"Stanford University has now
placed itself in an unfortunate posi
tion: its have been vio
lated with impunity and it now has
taken a positive stand in an anti-
McCarthy movement.
"I hope that it is prepared to bear
the consequences."
"This represents no movement,"
said Metcalf. "This is a joke and
we meant nothing more."
