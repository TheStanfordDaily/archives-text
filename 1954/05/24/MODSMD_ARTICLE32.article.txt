### BILL WRIGHT 
MODESTO. May 22 — Stan
ford s traveling tracksters turned
in excellent, but generally un
spectacular performances, here
tonight as they gathered with a
galaxy of the nation's best cin
dermen for the 13th running of
f he California Relays.
In their last competition before
next week's PCC meet in Seattle,
the Indians of Coach Jack Weiers
hauser collected points for sev
enth place in the open division. SC,
led by Jim Lea and Ernie Shelton,
>ook its expected team title.
Freshman high jumper Phil Feh
len notched perhaps the most out
standing mark among the Stanford
entrants when he went over the bar
at 6-3 for third place in the open
classification.
Shelton, who Coach Jess Morten
son says is destined to clear seven
ieet this year, tripped over 6-8%
with apparently little difficulty, but
he hit the bar hard at 6-10 :i /4.
Shelton's only competition came
from Verne Wilson of the Presidio,
who got over Chuck Holding
of East Texas State and Stanford's
John Stewart didn't enter and Bill
Russell of USF only cleared 6-1.
Leo Long, the Cards' best bet for
an NCAA title, continued his su
premacy over collegians as he sailed
the javelin 231 —10for third place
in the open.
Bill Miller contributed one of the
all-time great marks by lofting the
spear 255-B'/2 to win the event. It
was the best American toss in a
major meet.
Cy Young and Bud Held, who was

runner-up tonight at 243-4, made
their outstanding marks in All-Com
ers' meets in Pasadena. The official
world record is 258-2^.
But Indian Gerry Wood failed to
maintain his victory string over col
legiate high hurdlers when Willard
Wright of SC slipped into second be
hind victorious Jack Davis of LAAC
in the 120-yard barrier event.
Davis won in 13.8 with unofficial
times of 14.1 and 14.3 credited to
Wright and Wood. Ron Dozier of
Cal was fourth. Wood had beaten
Wright in the heat.
Stanford's iiprint relay team of Ed
Fremouw, Jim Saras, Walt Garrett,
and Keith Brownsberger was out
classed in the 440 race as Texas
(Dean Smith, Jerry Prevvit. Al Frie
den, Charles Thomas) ripped into
the tape in world record equaling
time of 40.5.
In the 880 relay the same Stanford

foursome slipped into third place
ahead of Oxy while Jim Lea pulled
away from Smith for an SC victory
in 1:24.5.
Garrett came from the rear of the
pack in the mile baton-passing race
to catch Oxy's Bray ton Norton at
the wire for another Card third
place. Brownsberger, Wood, and
Larry Spicer teamed with Garrett.
Lea led SC to another win in this
event as he held off the challenge of
Marvelous Mai Whitfield of LAAC.
Whitfield had run away l'rom Cal's
Lon Spurrier in the last leg of the
two-mile relay to give the club 10
first-place points.
Brownsberger won his heat of the
100 and then came on for a fourth in
the finals. Hector Hogan, the game
and gracious Aussie, wasn't ready
for his best effort as he ran for the
first time on a clay track, and Pod
Richard, ex of UCLA, won in 9.7.
A 1 Cheney took a third in the
shot behind Parry O'Brien with a
52-9 1 /2 effort. The cramped Modesto
facilities weren't the most conducive
for jumping and putting records,
and O'Brien "only" threw 58-3.
Freshman Frank Herrmann nabbed
a fourth in the open hop, step, and
jump at 42-6. Bernie Nelson nipped
Oxy's Jim Heiley in the frosh high
hurdles in 15.3. Jack Groat was
fourth in the frosh 100.
UCLA's phenomenal Bobby Sea
man stole the show in the frosh
relays as he and Jim Ellis led the
Brubabes to a new national record
in the frosh mile relay in 3:15.9.
Stanford, with Bill Carls, Jim Eas
ter, Joe Woollett, and Chuck Ince,
ran fourth.
Stanford and Oxy were the only
entrants in the frosh 880 relay and
the Tigers whipped the Card team
of Herrmann, Groat, Easter, and Ince
with ease in 1:28.2.
