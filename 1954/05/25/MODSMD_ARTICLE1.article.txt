# Construction to Begin by August On $3.5-Million Men's Dorm
## 
### 
Ground will be broken at Stan
ford during the summer on a
three and a half-million-dollar
men's residence hall that is to be
ready for occupancy at the be
ginning of the fall guarter of
1955, the University announced
yesterday.
A call for bids is to be issued next
week and it is expected work will be
under way not later than Aug. 1.
The hall will consist of a quad
rangle of eight living units, each
three stories in height, housing a
total of 704 students. A student
lounge and resident assistant's
apartment will adjoin each unit and
all will be grouped around a central
dining-administrativc building.
Located at the .southeast corner
of Escondido Road and Arguello
Street on the campus, the new resi
dence will be close to existing men's
dormitories.
An extensive recreational area,
large enough to serve the adjacent
living groups, will be part of the
project.
It is expected that most of the
hall's first tenants will be freshmen.
The future use of Eneina Hall, first
occupied in 1891 and for many years
the home of Stanford freshmen, has
not yet been determined.
The new hall will be reinforced
concrete, with gable roofs of red
tile. Floor space will total approxi
mately 21(5,000 square feet,. The cost
estimate includes equipment, fur
nishings, utilities, and landscaping.
Cost of the buildings alone is esti
mated at $2,750,000.
With a few exceptions, the rooms
will be double. They will provide
each student with a wardrobe closet,
chest of drawers, desk, bookcase,

and bed.
The apartments for resident as
sistants represent an innovation in
student housing at Stanford. The
assistants are to be married gradu
ate men who will act as counselors
to the students. The apartments
will have a living - dining room,
kitchenette, bedroom, study, and
bath.
The student lounges attached to
each wing will be approximately 40

by 50 feet. They will be equipped
with fireplaces and small galleys for
serving light refreshments.
The large central building will
contain the kitchen, two cafeterias,
and six dining rooms. It will also
include the administrative offices,
the director's living quarters with
a guest room, and five employees'
rooms. There will be a storage base
ment below the kitchen.
All of the units will be connected

by covered walkways and the spa
cious areas between buildings will
be made into surfaced and land
scaped courtyards. The dining areas
may be used for ballrooms, and ad
joining courts will be suitable for
outdoor dancing.
Softball, volleyball, and basketball
facilities and opcai grassy areas will
be provided in the recreation area,
which will lie mainly between the
new residence and Stern Hall.


FOR FUTURE FROSHâ€”Here is the architect's conception of how Stanford's new men's hall will
look when completed. University officials report that construction on the eight-winged dormi
tory should begin this summer and should be concluded in about two years.
