### 
WASHINGTON, May 24 (UP)—
The Supreme Court, today rein
forced its decision outlawing segre
gation in public schools by taking
steps to apply it to undergraduate
colleges supported by public funds.
Government lawyers said the
court's previous rulings, coupled
with today's action, make it clear
that segregation in any kind of pub
lic schools — from nursery schools
through university postgraduate in
stitutions—is unconstitutional.
Underscoring this view, the high
court sent two cases back to lower
courts in Louisiana and Florida with
instructions to study last week's
non-segregation opinion "and con
ditions that now prevail."
The cases involve efforts of Ne
groes to win admission to state-sup
ported Louisiana State University
and the University of Florida, hith
erto restricted to white students.
