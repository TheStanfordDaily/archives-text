# McCarthy hearing
## Nixon Link With Army Case Bared 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 24 (UP).
Vice-president Richard M. Nixon
was disclosed today to have
taken a hand in the backstage
maneuvering that preceded re
lease of the Army's charges
against Sen. Joseph R. McCar
thy.
Conflicting descriptions of the
secret role played by Nixon high
lighted the 19th day of the bitter
Army-McCarthy hearings which got
under way again after a six-day
layoff.
McCarthy brought up the Nixon
matter in trip-hammer questioning
of Army Secretary Robert T. Stevens
over whether higher officials were
responsible for a report that McCar
thy and his aides used "improper
pressure" to seek favors for Pvt. G.
David Schine.
The subcommittee then dismissed
Stevens temporarily, completed the
testimony of Army counsel John G.
Adams and heard a report from Maj.
Gen. Cornelius V. Ryan, Comman
dant at Fort Dix, N.J., where Schine
took part of his basic training.
Acting chairman Karl E. Mundt.
(R., S.D.) said he "wouldn't be at
ali surprised" if the Army wound
up its case tomorrow. He said his
prediction that, the* hearings would
end in twn more weeks "looks better
and better."
Stevens and Adams insisted they
and a few other officials in the Penta
gon were solely responsible for the
charges against McCarthy. They de
nied they were trying to "cover up"
for other administration officials.
But McCarthy pounded away at
his contention the charges were in
spired on a higher level. He said
Stevens either had "a bad memory"
or had committed perjury.
Ryan vehemently denied that
Schine, former subcommittee staff
consultant, received "preferential
treatment" at Ft. Dix other than
extra time off for subcommittee bus
iness.
Mundt said Ryan will testify
briefly again tomorrow and a few
more Army witnesses will follow
him. He doubted, however, that Mc-
Carthy will take the witness chair
tomorrow even if the Army rests its
case.
Nixon was not mentioned in the
testimony, but a source friendly to
McCarthy said the Vice-President
was the high administration official
who suggested that Sen. Charles E.
Potter (R., Mich.) ask the Army for
a copy of its charges.
