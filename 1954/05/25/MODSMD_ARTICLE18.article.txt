* WASHINGTON, May 24 (UP)
â€”The United States is flying a
rush shipment of light arms and
military vehicles to Honduras
and Nicaragua to offset the re
cent shipment of Communist
arms to Guatemala, the State
Department announced today.
The Air Force, which called the
weapons airlift a "one-shot aaffir,"
said the arms are being flown to the
two Central American nations in
two giant C-124 Globemasters. A
Globemaster can carry about 25 tons
of equipment.
The United States has mutual aid
assistance pacts with both nations.
The agieements call for this country
to provide Nicaragua and Honduras
with arms in return for strategic
materials needed by the United

States.
Lincoln White, State Department
press officer, told reporters it was
correct to say the rush shipments
were being made because of the re
cent delivery of about 2.000 tons of
arms to Guatemala from the Polish
controlled port of Stettin.
White said previously that the
Guatemalan arms shipment could be
conisdered a threat to the security
of the Western Hemisphere under
the Caracas agreement calling for
consultations if any American re
public is threatened by Communism.
The United States long has been
concerned by Communist infiltration
of Guatemala and subversive activi
ties in other American republics
which apparently stem from Guate
mala.
White refused to say what kind of
weapons were being flown to Hon
duras and Nicaragua, strategically

located on Guatemala's southern
flank. But he made the following
statement:
"The United States, in implemen
tation of the mutual defense assist
ance program agreements recently
signed with Nicaragua and Hondu
ras, is making an initial shipment of
military equipment to both of these
countries by air."
The urgency with which the Unit
ed States apparently regards the Rod
arms shipments to Guatemala was
underscored by the fact that the
mutual assistance pact with Hondu
ras was signed only last Thlirsday.
The pact with Nicaragua was signed
earlier.
The State Department had con
firmed earlier that it had heard un
confirmed rumors that two more
arms shipments are en route to Gua
temala from Iron Curtain ports.
