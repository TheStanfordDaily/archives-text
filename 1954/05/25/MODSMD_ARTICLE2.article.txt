# Toyon to Be Renovated
## 
### 
Extensive renovation work will be
done in Toyon Hall over the summer
and overcrowding will be eased by a
reduction in occupancy.
The University's Board of Trustees
has appropriated $3(5,500 for painting
all the loom and bath units, lacquer
ing floors, painting or washing cor
ridor walls, refinishing furniture, and
for the purchase of new furniture.
The Board also determined that,
beginning with fall quarter, the
same room rate schedule will be
adopted for Toyon that is now in
efTect at Stern Hall.
Singles will he $100 a quarter;
doubles, $85; and multiples, mostly
triple rooms, $75. Current rales
arc: .singles, $X 0; doubles, $72.50;
triples, $64; quadruples, $57.50; and
quintuples, $51.50.
Occupancy will be reduced from
283 to 227 men, a total of 56, largely
by cutting the present quadruple
rooms to triples. Capacity of the hall
was expanded as an emergency
measure because of increased enroll
ment after World War 11.
The number of Toyon men gradu
ating will more than compensate
for the reduction in occupancy so
that no present occupants will need
to move and it is anticipated there
will be vacancies in the fall for eat
ing club men and independents, ac
cording to Richard L. Balch, chief
counselor for men.
New furniture to be purchased in
cludes 105 chests, .'55 double-deck
beds, and 64 wardrobes. Chairs and
desks will be refinished. New rugs
are also to be purchased for the
lounge .
