### 
GENEVA, May 24 (UP) —Franco
introduced a compromise plan tocjay
for ending a deadlock in the Indo
china peace talks, and won Commu
nist agreement to start talks tomor
row on a cease-fire.
French Foreign Minister Georges
Bidault submitted a seven-point,
plan on how to proceed in the Indo
china debate to the eighth session at
the conference.
It appeared designed to skirt for
the time being the key problem of
how to arrange armistices in Laos
and Cambodia separately from a
settlement in Viet Nam, where most
of the seven-year war has been
fought. J
Bidault presented a program
which paralleled the five-point plan
of procedure submitted last Friday
by Soviet Foreign Minister V. M.
Molotov.
The Molotov plan called for dis
cussion, in order, of cessation of
hostilities, zones for regrouping the
rival forces, measures for banning
foreign arms and forces, cease-fire
controls, and guarantees against vio
lations.
The Bidault plan, French sources
said, also starts with the same two
points. However, the third point
would be to consider disarmament
of irregular forces.
The French would insert the ques
tion of how to stop foreign ship
ments from entering Indochina be
tween the cease-fire controls and
the guarantees.
