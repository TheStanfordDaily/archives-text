# Eden Warns Reds To Take Action
## 
### 
LONDON. May 24 (UP)â€”Foreign
Secretary Anthony Eden flew back
to Geneva today with a thinly veiled
warning to the Communists to get
down to business on a settlement in
the Far East.
"I think it likely our discussions
in the next week or two will be de
cisive," Eden said at the airport be
fore his departure.
He set a tentative time limit on
the British search for peace in Indo
china after a special cabinet meet
ing and a weekend of urgent talks
with Prime Minister Winston
Churchill.
British officials openly interpreted
his words as notice to the Reds that
time was running out on the oppor
tunity for working out any possible
settlement for Indochina and Korea.
Eden's comment also went one
step toward easing the strain on re
lations between the United States
and Britain over Southeast Asia.
