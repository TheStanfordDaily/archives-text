# Open the Door to NSA
## 
### 
For the last time this year, we will talk about
Stanford's relation to NSA.
And once again, we will affirm our belief that
Stanford should retain and expand its member
ship in that organization.
The issue of Stanford membership in the Na
tional Students Association is not peculiar to
this year. The arguments pro and con have
been examined several times since the first
Stanford interest v/as shown several years ago.
And the arguments remain essentially the
same.
Those against Stanford's participation cry
for "concrete" benefits. They maintain that
NSA is not worth the cost of dues and transpor
tation to its conferences. They say that NSA is
weak—thus it can give us nothing and cannot
possibly act as a legitimate voice for Ameri
can students.
Those arguments raise valid questions on the
question of the present effectiveness of NSA,
and we respect those questions. But the under
lying attitude which has stood in opposition to
NSA this year is one for which we can have
little respect.
Essentially, it is an attitude which views Stan
ford and.the Stanford student as God's gift to
society and mankind and looks upon the stu
dent representatives from other schools as in
ferior beings, variously described as "turkeys,"
"elephants," and "freaks."
We have seen that attitude displayed both at
Stanford and at NSA conferences by some
of our outstanding student leaders. We have
heard the statements of "We are great . . .
they are freaks." We have watched the reac

tions of other schools to this manner of super
iority, and have experienced genuine embar
rassment for Stanford and for ourselves.
The attitude has had its effect on Stanford's
discussion on NSA membership. The major
ramification has been the expression of the idea
that Stanford cannot profit from such detailed
contact and exchange of information with other
colleges. Stanford, we. will hear, is perfect—
whatever problems it has cannot be settled by
anyone else . . . NSA can't do anything for us.
But we maintain that it can. We maintain that
the respectful exchange of information which
NSA offers can help Stanford in the operation
of its government and the organization of its
activities.
Beyond that "benefit," we see the more im
portant, but more difficult to describe, goal of
NSA. A "voice" for the Students of America is
not impossible. We do not advocate that Stan
ford suddenly devote all of its attention to poli
tics, but we do believe that Stanford should ex
tend its views on issues which affect the stu
dents*. NSA offers the potential "voice" for the
expression of those views. But it needs the sup
port of all American students to achieve that
goal. It needs the support of Stanford.
Stanford stuck its toe in the door of NSA this
year. It was a hesitant move, and one which, as
we have said, was opposed by a figure which
said, "Sorry, we don't need you."
We hope that figure will open his views to
a fair examination of NSA when the ASSU con
siders its membership next fall. We hope that
the door to NSA wi]] be opened, and that Stan
ford will step into the opportunities of that or
ganization.

rassment for Stanford and for ourselves.
The attitude has had its effect on Stanford's
discussion on NSA membership. The major
ramification has been the expression of the idea
that Stanford cannot profit from such detailed
contact and exchange of information with other
colleges. Stanford, we. will hear, is perfect—
whatever problems it has cannot be settled by
anyone else . . . NSA can't do anything for us.
But we maintain that it can. We maintain that
the respectful exchange of information which
NSA offers can help Stanford in the operation
of its government and the organization of its
activities.
Beyond that "benefit," we see the more im
portant, but more difficult to describe, goal of
NSA. A "voice" for the Students of America is
not impossible. We do not advocate that Stan
ford suddenly devote all of its attention to poli
tics, but we do believe that Stanford should ex
tend its views on issues which affect the stu
dents*. NSA offers the potential "voice" for the
expression of those views. But it needs the sup
port of all American students to achieve that
goal. It needs the support of Stanford.
Stanford stuck its toe in the door of NSA this
year. It was a hesitant move, and one which, as
we have said, was opposed by a figure which
said, "Sorry, we don't need you."
We hope that figure will open his views to
a fair examination of NSA when the ASSU con
siders its membership next fall. We hope that
the door to NSA wi]] be opened, and that Stan
ford will step into the opportunities of that or
ganization.
For the last time this year, we will talk about
Stanford's relation to NSA.
And once again, we will affirm our belief that
Stanford should retain and expand its member
ship in that organization.
The issue of Stanford membership in the Na
tional Students Association is not peculiar to
this year. The arguments pro and con have
been examined several times since the first
Stanford interest v/as shown several years ago.
And the arguments remain essentially the
same.
Those against Stanford's participation cry
for "concrete" benefits. They maintain that
NSA is not worth the cost of dues and transpor
tation to its conferences. They say that NSA is
weak—thus it can give us nothing and cannot
possibly act as a legitimate voice for Ameri
can students.
Those arguments raise valid questions on the
question of the present effectiveness of NSA,
and we respect those questions. But the under
lying attitude which has stood in opposition to
NSA this year is one for which we can have
little respect.
Essentially, it is an attitude which views Stan
ford and.the Stanford student as God's gift to
society and mankind and looks upon the stu
dent representatives from other schools as in
ferior beings, variously described as "turkeys,"
"elephants," and "freaks."
We have seen that attitude displayed both at
Stanford and at NSA conferences by some
of our outstanding student leaders. We have
heard the statements of "We are great . . .
they are freaks." We have watched the reac

tions of other schools to this manner of super
iority, and have experienced genuine embar
rassment for Stanford and for ourselves.
