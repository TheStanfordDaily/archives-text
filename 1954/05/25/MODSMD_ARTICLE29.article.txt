# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Time now 10 put into print several thoughts that
have been gnawing at. our mind for the past several
months. Time now. with only a few issues of The
Daily remaining, to submit for your consideration
several areas in which we think Stanford can be im-

proved. Time now to discuss how
we, the students, and yes, most
certainly, the faculty end admini
stration also, can make Stanford
the type of place we think it is
when we read the Frosh Hand
book while we're high school sen
iors.
Tlie greatest untapped resource
;il Stanford are the professors. We
don't mean professors as they de
li ver three lectures a week and

hand out grades at the end of the quarter. We mean
the professors as individuals—as men who invite a
group of students to their homes to chew the fat
with them, as men who have long personal conferences
with students.
It is true that there are far too many faculty mem
bers who are so enamoured with their subjects that
students are just necessary evils. They would much
rather teach engineering than John or Mary. But it
is also true that the majority of Stanford professors
are more concerned with persons than they are with
subjects. They would like to get to know the stu
ilviits as peisons better.
tvul (lie student has to take a n<iod part of the
initiative. How many of us can honestly say that we
can call even just one professor a good friend of
ours? And if the answer is "no." have we ever at
tempted (<> take the initiative?
There are two groups of students on chmpus who
meet, informally with a professor every week or two.
They have a bull session with the professor on his
particular field of study. Sometimes these students
have midterms the next day, and their grades suffer
because of the meetings. But then, all that you '"get
out of Stanford" isn't always measured in the grade
book. Sometimes you "get more out of Stanford" in
an evening's discussion with a professor than you do
out of a quarter's work in a class.

Pete Bing and Diane Goldman are now working
hard to ret up moans in which students and faculty can
better meet. Wc hop-, it will be taken advantage of.
There's another area of improvement that we're
concerned about this morning. Stated simply, it's bet
ter teaching.
We're concerned because the Stanford student is
paying $220 a quarter for the Stanford reputation,
not for the Stanford education. Many scholars,
writing- brilliant hooks, have earned Stanford the
reputation that the administration seeks. But the
tragic thing is thai few undergrads ever benefit
from that reputation.
We aic nol belittling the reputation, ll is import
ant. Securing grant and gifts depends, in large, upon
a high national standing. A university is given a high
national ranking on the basis of its research accom
plishments and its publications. A national standing
rarely is correlated with teaching. A great teacher
is seldom heard of beyond the next county.
Thus, Stanford, whether it admits it or not. has put
emphasis on research. It has done this to maintain
its high national reputation, which, in turn, brings in
cold cash. It has done this at the expense of good
teaching for the students Many of the heads of the
departments and tlu' administration have woefully
neglected good teaching when it has come to promo
tion.' and appointments.
We are convinced that Dr. Sterling is very con
cerned with this problem and that forward strides
have been made. We are ; lso convinced that much
improvement is needed. I» you don't believe the latter
statement, think back about your years at Stanford
and determine just what per cent of your profs have
really been inspiring teachers, particularly in Lower
Division. Can you count them on the fingers of one
hand?
We like the words of one top professor who said.
"All my hooks are two-legged." In other words,
he stakes l is reputation on the success that his stu
dents make, not oh tombs of research.
When the administration comes to realize that the
' two-legged book .ire more important than the other
kind, then we'll be paying $220 a quarter for the Stan
ford education as well a: the reputation.
