### BOB DURAND 
Some say it was 12 lengths; some
; say it was 10 lengths; and some say
i it was eight lengths. It really doesn't
! matter.
Stanford's varsity oarsmen re
! ceived a tremendous round of ap
| plause when they crossed the finish
{ line Saturday afternoon at the Oak
j land Estuary. However, the applause
was for a hard - fighting group of
; boys who had been outclassed by a
powerful California crew.
The Bear she.U had glided under
the Fruitvale Avenue bridge almost
i half it minute earlier, having stroked
| over the three-mile course in a time
j of 15 minutes 27 seconds. The In
dian eight was not officially clocked
.so the winning distance could not be
j accurately estimated.
Three other of Coach Ky Ebright's
[ Blue and Gold boats captured their
races during the course of the after
j noon to make it a clean sweep of the j
j river for the veteran mentor.
The Cal junior varsity oarsmen
I led their Stanford counterparts all
the way to easily triumph by 10
lengths in a time of 10:28 for two
1 miles. In a 2,000-meter sprint be
tween the second freshman boats,
the Bear Cubs stopped the watches
in six minutes fiat, holding a lead
of five lengths.
The first frosh crews provided
the closest event of the day. The
Tribe yearlings pushed their op
ponents to the utmost before final
ly succumbing by two lengths.
The winning time for the two-mile
i distance was 10:32.

The winning formula for the races
was power, as can be evidenced by
the stroke chart. Both varsity
sweepswingers opened at 35 beats
per minute. By the half-way point,
the Bears were rowing a 30, the
Indians a 32.
In the home stretch, Cal's stroke,
Marshall Leve, upped the count to
a 35, while the Tribe's number eight
man. Bill Findlay, finished at a 38.
The Cards' second freshmen cov
ered over half of their course using
only seven men. Number two man
Deryck Hautau broke his slide after
the race was well under way and
was unable to pull.


RECORD â€” Eric Lindvall dives ;
pitward after clearing the 6-foot
.IVa-inch bar to garner five points {
for the champion Chi Phi's and
break his own mural record.
