# FOREIGN SCHOLAR INTERVIEWED
## U.S. Conformity Criticized 
### JIM PALMER 
"People in Europe are proud
to be individualistic, but Ameri
cans fear to be different—they
conform," stressed Lise - Lotte
Langbein, ASSU foreign scholar
from Frankfurt, Germany, in a
recent interview.
Lotte, a 24-year-old graduate eco
nomics student, says there is less
conformity in Europe, where the aim
is to educate individuals. "The re
sult of this desire of Americans to
conform is insincerity," she re
marked.
Lotte is a business administration
graduate of the University of
Frankfurt. She has been active in
student groups in Frankfurt, includ
ing the International Student Rela
tions Association which promotes
educational and cultural relations
between students throughout the
world.
Following World War 11, she took
part in a newspaper campaign to
stimulate the rebuilding of Ger
many's educational system. '"There
were no books, no teachers, and poor
facilities," she said Later, at the
University of Frankfurt, she became
society editor of the college news
paper.

Germany's chief problem at
present, Lotte stated, is overpop
ulation. "With 48 million people,
West Germany is plagued by a
crowded housing condition, a low
standard of living, and many so
cial problems. The election of
Konrari Adenauer, though, proves
that the people are loyal to de
mocracy despite their social prob
lems."
The way to stop Communism,

Lotte asserted, is by increased for
eign aid and trade. "Communism is
ideological, and it is impossible to
shoot an idea. Americans must show
the world what democracy means."
On the subject of American stu
dents, Lotte said she believes that
the Germans are more mature and
serious because of their experiences
in war. "In European universities
the emphasis is on studying. But in
America, the social activities are
emphasized." The women here, she
continued, seem more serious than
the men.
"But," she added, "the women,
even with the many rights they have
here, have few possibilities of get
ting important jobs. There are only
four women in the graduate school.
In Germany there are many women
in the graduate school. The big jobs
in America go to the men and the
women arc discriminated against."
Lotte is planning to obtain a posi
tion with an export-import com
pany in the East this summer in
order to gain American business ex
perience. Eventually she will have
an executive post with an export
import company in Germany.
She stressed that people must
travel outside in the world to really
get acquainted with people and sec
the other side of life. She is enthu
siastic for the American cultural life
and thinks that Americans are
pleasant and friendly, even if some
times insincerely so.

University of Frankfurt, she became
society editor of the college news
paper.

Germany's chief problem at
present, Lotte stated, is overpop
ulation. "With 48 million people,
West Germany is plagued by a
crowded housing condition, a low
standard of living, and many so
cial problems. The election of
Konrari Adenauer, though, proves
that the people are loyal to de
mocracy despite their social prob
lems."
The way to stop Communism,

Lotte asserted, is by increased for
eign aid and trade. "Communism is
ideological, and it is impossible to
shoot an idea. Americans must show
the world what democracy means."
On the subject of American stu
dents, Lotte said she believes that
the Germans are more mature and
serious because of their experiences
in war. "In European universities
the emphasis is on studying. But in
America, the social activities are
emphasized." The women here, she
continued, seem more serious than
the men.
"But," she added, "the women,
even with the many rights they have
here, have few possibilities of get
ting important jobs. There are only
four women in the graduate school.
In Germany there are many women
in the graduate school. The big jobs
in America go to the men and the
women arc discriminated against."
Lotte is planning to obtain a posi
tion with an export-import com
pany in the East this summer in
order to gain American business ex
perience. Eventually she will have
an executive post with an export
import company in Germany.
She stressed that people must
travel outside in the world to really
get acquainted with people and sec
the other side of life. She is enthu
siastic for the American cultural life
and thinks that Americans are
pleasant and friendly, even if some
times insincerely so.

"People in Europe are proud
to be individualistic, but Ameri
cans fear to be different—they
conform," stressed Lise - Lotte
Langbein, ASSU foreign scholar
from Frankfurt, Germany, in a
recent interview.
Lotte, a 24-year-old graduate eco
nomics student, says there is less
conformity in Europe, where the aim
is to educate individuals. "The re

conform is insincerity," she re
marked.
