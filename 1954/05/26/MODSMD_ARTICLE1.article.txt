### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
A new policy affecting gradu
ating Air Force ROTC students
went into effect recently to an
swer complaints of many Air
ROTC seniors who were not of
fered commissions because of a
slash in Air Force appropria
tions.
Under the new policy many grad
uating seniors in Air RO will be
offered commissions us officers in
the Air National Guard. As Guard
officers they will serve three years
on active duty, then three years with
the Guard, ;ind finally two years on
inactive status subject to recall.
Many protests were raised last
year when the Air Force announced
that because of drastic budget
slashes it would be unable to give
commissions to all students in Upper
Division Air ROTC. Instead, the
students who could not be commis
sioned were promised "certificates
of completion" which would allow
them to enlist in the Air Force after
graduation for a two-year period in
stead of the normal four years.
Excom two days ago approved a
resolution outlining the complaint
and agreed to send a letter of pro
test to several government officials,
including Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon.
Lt. Col. Ralp W. Keller, head of
the Stanford Air RO Department,
explained that the certificates of
completion were offered through a
ruling of the Department of De
fense, and that4he Air Force at that
time definitely protested against us
ing them.
However, Keller explained, the
certificates were the only alterna
tive, since the Selective Service Act
requires that students deferred for
ROTC must serve at least two years
in the armed forces.
The lack of funds so seriously af
fected the Air Force that it was
forced to release many reserve offi
cers who were already on acLive
duty.
The new plan to yive National
Guard commissions will give grad
uating seniors a chance to net. their
commissions or to take the certifi
cates of completion.
The plan affects only those cadets
who are unable to fiy for the Air
Force, since all those eligible for
flight training will reecive reserve
commissions.
Keller pointed out that while the
National Guard has certain disad
vantages compared to the Reserve, a
Guard commission would give the
graduates status as officers rather
than as enlisted men.
Officials of the NROTC and Army
ROTC Departments here said there
has been no change in their commis
sioning policy, and that all their
graduates this year will become offi
cers.

the Air National Guard. As Guard
officers they will serve three years
on active duty, then three years with
the Guard, ;ind finally two years on
inactive status subject to recall.
Many protests were raised last
year when the Air Force announced
that because of drastic budget
slashes it would be unable to give
commissions to all students in Upper
Division Air ROTC. Instead, the
students who could not be commis
sioned were promised "certificates
of completion" which would allow
them to enlist in the Air Force after
graduation for a two-year period in
stead of the normal four years.
Excom two days ago approved a
resolution outlining the complaint
and agreed to send a letter of pro
test to several government officials,
including Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon.
Lt. Col. Ralp W. Keller, head of
the Stanford Air RO Department,
explained that the certificates of
completion were offered through a
ruling of the Department of De
fense, and that4he Air Force at that
time definitely protested against us
ing them.
However, Keller explained, the
certificates were the only alterna
tive, since the Selective Service Act
requires that students deferred for
ROTC must serve at least two years
in the armed forces.
The lack of funds so seriously af
fected the Air Force that it was
forced to release many reserve offi
cers who were already on acLive
duty.
The new plan to yive National
Guard commissions will give grad
uating seniors a chance to net. their
commissions or to take the certifi
cates of completion.
The plan affects only those cadets
who are unable to fiy for the Air
Force, since all those eligible for
flight training will reecive reserve
commissions.
Keller pointed out that while the
National Guard has certain disad
vantages compared to the Reserve, a
Guard commission would give the
graduates status as officers rather
than as enlisted men.
Officials of the NROTC and Army
ROTC Departments here said there
has been no change in their commis
sioning policy, and that all their
graduates this year will become offi
cers.
