# DULLES:
## Arms Pose Threat In Guatemala 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 25 (UP) —
Secretary of State John Foster Dul
les said today the recent Red arms
shipment to Guatemala makes it the
dominant military power in Central
America and poses a potential threat
to the Panama Canal.
Simultaneously, House Democratic
Leader John W. McCormack (Mass.)
called for an urgent study of the
problem by the House Foreign Af
fairs Committee.
Dulles told a news conference the
Red-infiltrated government of Gua
temala could use the arms to build
a Communist stronghold near the

Panama Canal, vital link between
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and
"endanger the peace of America."
He added that if war breaks out
in Central America the United
States would expect, to act with its
Western Hemisphere allies to halt
it. But he said nothing will be done
until this country completes a cur
rent study of the overall situation.
At the same time, military sources
said more U.S. arms are expected to
be rushed by sea to Nicaragua and
Honduras, Guatemala's southern
neighbors.
Radio Moscow accused the United
States of arming Nicaragua and
Honduras in preparation for an at
tack on Guatemala.
Dulles said the Guatemalan mili
tary machine, aided by the Red
weapons, now is three to four times
as large as that of any of its neigh
bors. In addition, he said, Guate
mala already has made gestures
which have alarmed its neighbors.

GUATEMALA CITY. May 25
