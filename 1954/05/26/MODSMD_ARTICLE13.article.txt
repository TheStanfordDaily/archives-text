### JERRY SMITH 
"The best way to pursue music if
you don't have an instrument is to
be a composer," composer Henry
Cowell said last night at the Tues
day Evening Series in Memorial Au
ditorium.
"I lived in an age when people
around me felt that if you were
inspired, you composed, and if you
weren't, you didn't," Cowell con
tinued. It never occurred to him to
study harmony, but when he did,
he commented, "I found several
things wrong with it."
"At 14 or 15 I decided it was high
time my music should be heard, so
I rented a concert hall," Cowell said
"My friends and parents happened
to be ill, so I went to perform all
alone." His first audience was a lone
music critic.
"I went to Eurhpc to get. brilliant
notices.' he recalled. At his first
European concert in Leipzig one per
son in ten clapped, the other nine
hissed, but no one left except those
who were arrested for fightifig. "The
brilliant notices didn't quite come
off."
His music wa.> declared "too radi
cal ' for Russia by a group of "rather
dilapidated ucntlcmon" who had
hired him, but. he played privately
He was flattered because the Rus
sians wanted to hear his pieces sev
eral times until he discovered they
accepted pieces they liked on first
hearing. According to a Russian
newspaper, he was the "fourth most
decadent American composer."
"A composer grows by heai ing his
own works and discovering intimate
details that need to be changed,'"
Cowell concluded.
