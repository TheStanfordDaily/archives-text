# New RA Plan Discussed At IFC Meeting
## 
### 
At the Interfraternity Council
meeting last night, Richard H. Balch,
chief counselor for men, discussed
the University's proposal for a new
resident assistant program in fra
ternities next year.
Balch also answered questions re
garding a . fraternity inspection
committee which would include
Fire Chief John Marston, Louis Ol
son, director of health on campus,
and three representatives from the
IFC.
The IFC postponed tin til next fall
any decision on the proposal to
switch rushing to spring quarter as
well as discussion on general rush
ing procedure.
Under the new RA plan, the Uni
versity would contribute one-half
the cost of room and board up t.o
$250 for the resident .assistants. The
fraternity will provide a single
room.
The new resident assistants, who
must be graduate or fifth-year en
gineering students, will be nomi
nated by the individual houses. The
fraternities' nominations must be ac
ceptable to the Men's Counselor.
The RA's duties will be to counsel
students who request help and to
provide the University with a con
tact with each man in the fraterni
ties.
Balch said that at the present time
the University does not have suffi
cient information with which to an
swer inquiries from parents or po
tential employers about a fraternity
man's record at Stanford.
The fraternities were generally in
favor of the proposal although some
houses said that they would have
difficulty setting aside a single room
for the RA. Balch emphasized that
a single room was essential if the
RA is to carry out his responsibili
ties satisfactorily.
The inspection will also provide a
basis for the Board of Trustees to
judge the validity of any fraternity
requests for University loans.
