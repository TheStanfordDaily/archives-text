# Frosh Claims False Licenses Sold on Campus
## 
### 
A Stanford freshman, placed
under arrest by Palo Alto police,
said yesterday that "someone"
on campus makes doctored
driver's licenses and has sold
some 400 of them at SI each.
Men's Counselor Piichard L.
Balch launched an immediate
investigation into the matter.
The student, Harry R. Havens, 19,
was one of three men arrested yes
terday morning for an incident at
the Greyhound bus depot in Palo
Alto. On booking him, officers found
he was carrying two operator's li
censes, one with his age altered.
Balch Said, "The statement is a
very serious charge, and if true we
intend to discover and prosecute
whoever is selling altered driver's
licenses."
Havens, freshman Ronald Pataky,
and sophomore Tony Serra were j
placed under arrest and later released j
on bail. Havens was booked on a J
charge of possessing a faked opera
tor's license, Pataky for drunkenness,
and Serra for malicious mischief.
According to the bus driver's state
ment, the students demanded to
board the bus at 12:38 a.m. When
he refused because they looked
drunk, one of them began hammer
ing on the windshield with a wine
bottle.
The driver, Jack Pierce, went to
the station's phone booth to call
police, but found that the receiver
had been ripped from the wait.
When police finally were called,
Havens and Pataky were placed
under arrest. Serra was found, after
a search, hiding between two parked
busses. He was released when his
friends said he had nothing to do
with breaking the phone. However,
he went to the police station early
that morning to post bail for the
other two, and was then booked after
he admitted ripping off the receiver.
Balch has turned punishment for
the arrests over to Men's Council
chairman Rusty Russell, but said his
office would handle the matter of the
licenses. Making or possessing false j
operator's licenses in California is
a misdemeanor, normally punishable
by up to $500 fine and six months in
jail.
Havens charged that about 400
students possess such license! in
order to purchase liquor at Possotti's
Beer Garden.
E. J. Clark and lieke Mann, co
operators of the Alpine Road estab
lishment, said that they have been
insisting on either drivers licenses
or draft cards for proper identifica
tion. Rossotti's went under new man
agement about, a year ago, invoking,
according to the proprietors, "a I
much stricter policy than before."
A similar situation occurred four
years ago. when an Encina student
was found with ;> photostating ma- j
chine in his closet.
