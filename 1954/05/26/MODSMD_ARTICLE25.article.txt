# Student Government Report
## 
### 
Tonight the special student government com
mittee of the ASSU will present its report and
recommendations to the Executive Committee.
The report is the result of a full quarter of
work by seven students whom we feel were
well-qualified for the task of reviewing the stu
dent government situation at Stanford. The
committee conducted dozens of interviews and
drew a mass of reports from students who have
been active in the ASSU.
Out of those interviews and reports, we ex
pect to see several specific changes in the
structure of the ASSU. But more important, we
expect to see a clarification of that structure and
the responsibilities of its officers. The clarifica
tion is needed. Too often we have heard the be
wildered dry of "Whose job is this?" from stu
dent officers.
We do not doubt that Stanford's student gov
ernment will be improved if the recommenda
tions of the report are followed. In anticipation
of that improvement, we commend the mem
bers of the student government committee. And
in the hope that that improvement is near, we

suggest Excom adoption of the report
