# To Excom

### 
The Executive Committee will meet for the
last time of the year tonight.
Before its members leave their posts and at
tempt to catch up on iecently neglected
studies, we would like to commend each mem
ber and the whole group for its work this year.
It was a busy, significant, and occasionally
exciting year for Excom. Several outstanding
issues, and a million normal details, received
the attention they deserved. We did not always
agree with Excom's decisions. We attempted
to co-operate, but also to view Excom from a
neutral observation.
Out of that observation, we have come to re
spect the sincerity of the Executive Committee
members in contributing to Stanford. The con
tribution, throughout the year, took time, and
for some, a few grade points.
But the time and sacrifice were worth it.
