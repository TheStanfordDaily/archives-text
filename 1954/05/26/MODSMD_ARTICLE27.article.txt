When you know that any day the forces that de
cide one's fate in this Army will soon be deciding your
own, you sit up and take notice. Following your
sixteen weeks of basic training (and you are con
sidered a trainee for your first 16 rntarrfipus

of whether you're toting a rifle or fj
not), you are assigned perma- j
nently to some post and the
chances are good that you will j
remain there for the remainder of j
your time in the service. j
Therefore the importance of the •
assignment cannot be overesti- j
mated and the individual's con- j
cern is naturally understood.
Some of the men wish to stay
right here at Old—they are few j

in number; others wish to travel, some to the East
ern seaboard. Many would like to go overseas, pro
vided they go in the right direction, that is, to Europe.
A majority of the men, for obvious reasons, would
like to be stationed at a post somewhere near their
home. But an individual has no choice. We have men
in our class from New York and from San Fran
cisco, but when orders come, each may find himself
in the other's home town.
It is a fact that the clerk typists will get a softer
job than the riflemen. That is assured. But to the
men themselves the location rather than the job is
all-important. In other words, a man may have the
easiest job in the world, but if he is stationed in some
spot completely off (be beaten track or 5,000 miles
from home he may not be too happy. Most men
would take any job as long as the location was agree

able. However, yielding to apparently reasonable
wishes is not the way the Army does it. You take
what you get, and often what you get makes a man
bitter and resentful when a bit more personal deal
ing with the individual may actually make him do a
good job, be efficient, and conscientious, instead of
the "what the hell" attitude which is so prevalent
in this draft Army of today.
Last Saturday morning our training schedule, which
the higher-ups insisted was so intense and necessary
that no early passes could be given, was actually a
contrast between the horrors of war and the time
wasted by the Army.
Following a 0730 to 0830 inspection, which is rou
tine Saturday morning procedure, we were taken to
a film entitled "Baptism of Fire" and it showed the
horrors and tenor of combat in all its blood, gore,
and waste. And when it was over the beginning
typists, who are sometimes threatened with the
thought of being sent back to the marching infantry,
were heard to mutter that if given a time test right
then they could have done forty words a minute. It
was a terrifying look at war.
This eyeful of real combat, in films that you woidd
never see at the Stanford, Varsity, or Guild, were
followed by a sweeping ol the Company streets. II
you have ever seen a group of men, almost a bun
died, each with a broom in hand, ten or twelve
abreast, sweeping r.trects some two or three blocks
long, then you know what we did Saturday. If you
haven't, think about it, and you can realize why at
times some of the things we must do seem foolish
arid a waste of manpower, taxes, and time.

a film entitled "Baptism of Fire" and it showed the
horrors and tenor of combat in all its blood, gore,
and waste. And when it was over the beginning
typists, who are sometimes threatened with the
thought of being sent back to the marching infantry,
were heard to mutter that if given a time test right
then they could have done forty words a minute. It
was a terrifying look at war.
This eyeful of real combat, in films that you woidd
never see at the Stanford, Varsity, or Guild, were
followed by a sweeping ol the Company streets. II
you have ever seen a group of men, almost a bun
died, each with a broom in hand, ten or twelve
abreast, sweeping r.trects some two or three blocks
long, then you know what we did Saturday. If you
haven't, think about it, and you can realize why at
times some of the things we must do seem foolish
arid a waste of manpower, taxes, and time.

When you know that any day the forces that de
cide one's fate in this Army will soon be deciding your
own, you sit up and take notice. Following your
sixteen weeks of basic training (and you are con
sidered a trainee for your first 16 rntarrfipus

of whether you're toting a rifle or fj
not), you are assigned perma- j
nently to some post and the
chances are good that you will j
remain there for the remainder of j
your time in the service. j
Therefore the importance of the •
assignment cannot be overesti- j
mated and the individual's con- j
cern is naturally understood.
Some of the men wish to stay
right here at Old—they are few j

in number; others wish to travel, some to the East
ern seaboard. Many would like to go overseas, pro
vided they go in the right direction, that is, to Europe.
A majority of the men, for obvious reasons, would
like to be stationed at a post somewhere near their
home. But an individual has no choice. We have men
in our class from New York and from San Fran
cisco, but when orders come, each may find himself
in the other's home town.
It is a fact that the clerk typists will get a softer
job than the riflemen. That is assured. But to the
men themselves the location rather than the job is
all-important. In other words, a man may have the
easiest job in the world, but if he is stationed in some
spot completely off (be beaten track or 5,000 miles
from home he may not be too happy. Most men
would take any job as long as the location was agree

able. However, yielding to apparently reasonable
wishes is not the way the Army does it. You take
what you get, and often what you get makes a man
bitter and resentful when a bit more personal deal
ing with the individual may actually make him do a
good job, be efficient, and conscientious, instead of
the "what the hell" attitude which is so prevalent
in this draft Army of today.
Last Saturday morning our training schedule, which
the higher-ups insisted was so intense and necessary
that no early passes could be given, was actually a
contrast between the horrors of war and the time
wasted by the Army.
Following a 0730 to 0830 inspection, which is rou
tine Saturday morning procedure, we were taken to
a film entitled "Baptism of Fire" and it showed the
