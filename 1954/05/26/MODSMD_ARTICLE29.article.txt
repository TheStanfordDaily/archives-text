# Buck Club Provides Scholarships, Solves Problem of Athletic Subsidies
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
Quite a furor has been raised
during the past several years
about the deplorable athletic
subsidization practices on many j
leading campuses throughout i
the nation.
Several schools have been ex
pelled from NCAA membership.
Others have been given a proba
! tionary status.
The Ivy League ilune out with its
j "code of ethics" stand and many
I schools have followed suit.
But, what about Stanford? How I
|do Mts athletes get through four
j years of college?
The answer is the Stanford Buck
! Club, a club that could easily be
said to have done so much for so
. little recognition. The Buck Club
: puts many Stanford athletes through
I school, but does so within strict
j compliance with the rules of the Pa
i cifie Coast Conference. The club
j doesn't need publicity, but can be
proud of the fact that publicity
doesn't hurt it.
In short, the members of the
I Stanford Buck Club are alumni and
friends of Stanford who contribute
j each year to tuition scholarships for
j students with athletic ability and
1 who demonstrate a real need for aid.
j It should be kept in mind that the
| scholarships go for tuition and tui
j lion only.
j 't he student never has the money
j in his possession. The gift donation
i is paid directly to Stanford in his
name. Full accounts of all contribu
tions are maintained and books are
kept on the campus which are al
ways open for inspection.
During the concluding atheltic
year the club granted $70,010 to 123
athletes, an average of better than
$550 per individual. Not every stu
dent received full tuition for three
i quarters as some dropped out of
school, some fell behind in their
grades (they must maintain a C av
erage), and a few found they no
longer needed aid.
While the major part of the Buck
Club aid goes to football, because
of the number who turn out for that
activity and because of the stronger
alumni interest, the other sports are
also greatly benefited.
A breakdown in scholarships re
* veals that 72 grants-in-aid went
for football, IK for basketball, l(i
for baseball, 10 for track, 5 for
swimming, and 2 for golf.
Football Coach Chuck Taylor has
emphasized the point many times
and other Card coaches are in
agreement when he says that "With
out Buck Club funds, we would find
[ it very difficult to compete with
| schools in our conference. It is much
different in conferences like the Ivy
1 | League where all schools are on the
1 i same financial and academic level,
j I In our conference there is a tremen
dous difference. It is a state vs. pri
vate school set-up."
Figures released from the Athletic
a Department show that less than 10
per cent of the top-flight high school
* athletes whom Stanford wants can
3 i be admitted to the University. The
j athlete who is qualified to enroll,

but hasn't the financial backing, ]
probably would go to a state school
unless Stanford helps him.
Many athletes enter the Univer
sity on scholastic scholarships, in ;
which case they don't need the
grants-in-aid, but the majority need
the help that the Buck Club offers.
Among the many outstanding I
principles of the Buck Club is the 1
fact that once an athlete is granted
aid he gets it for his full four years
at Stanford as long as he remains
active in sports.
The scholarship is subject to
need and is decided upon by the
Academic Scholarship Committee,
which tfives out the scholastic
scholarships as well. The athlete
must first and foremost he a stu
dent and keep his marks up.
The Buck Club is proud of the 1
fact that it continues its aid for the
full time even if a boy is injured. |
Last year, a veteran footballer had
his career ended when he injured a
knee.
He thought his Buck Club grant
would be discontinued and asked
Taylor if he might get a coaching
assistant's job to help him complete
his schooling. Taylor was able to
tell him that the Buck Club would
carry him through his four years of
college.
It isn't the club's purpose to turn
out top-grade athletes. Its view is
that the main purpose of the Uni

versity as far as athletes are con
cerned is to give them an education. ;
As long as sports are making a
contribution to the development ol j
individuals, without crowding the
main purpose of education, they are
considered worth while. When they
become the primary aim they are no
longer valuable.
As far as the mechanics of the I
club are concerned the minimum
dues for non-alumni or alumni to
become Stanford Bucks are $18 a
year. The original figure was $11'
when the club was organized as the
Buck-01-the-Month Club.
Every Stanford Buck thus assist. 1
in making it possible for worth}
and needy athletes to receive a i
Stanford education.
Each Stanford B u c k receives j
monthly bulletins which report on j
the athletic program at Stanford and
each Stanford Buck making the ]
minimum contribution receives a
preferred ticket classification for all |
Stanford football games.
The largest single donation to dMe I
has been $2,200 and their are hun
dreds of "Big Bucks" who contribute
$50 or more each year.
At present there are 1,400 metn
| bers in the club who are spread over j
! the nation and in the outlying areas
of the United States. With the rise
! in tuition, the club will need an in-.
I creased membership and has set
$85,000 as its goal for this year.

which case they don't need the
grants-in-aid, but the majority need
the help that the Buck Club offers.
Among the many outstanding I
principles of the Buck Club is the 1
fact that once an athlete is granted
aid he gets it for his full four years
at Stanford as long as he remains
active in sports.
The scholarship is subject to
need and is decided upon by the
Academic Scholarship Committee,
which tfives out the scholastic
scholarships as well. The athlete
must first and foremost he a stu
dent and keep his marks up.
The Buck Club is proud of the 1
fact that it continues its aid for the
full time even if a boy is injured. |
Last year, a veteran footballer had
his career ended when he injured a
knee.
He thought his Buck Club grant
would be discontinued and asked
Taylor if he might get a coaching
assistant's job to help him complete
his schooling. Taylor was able to
tell him that the Buck Club would
carry him through his four years of
college.
It isn't the club's purpose to turn
out top-grade athletes. Its view is
that the main purpose of the Uni

versity as far as athletes are con
cerned is to give them an education. ;
As long as sports are making a
contribution to the development ol j
individuals, without crowding the
main purpose of education, they are
considered worth while. When they
become the primary aim they are no
longer valuable.
As far as the mechanics of the I
club are concerned the minimum
dues for non-alumni or alumni to
become Stanford Bucks are $18 a
year. The original figure was $11'
when the club was organized as the
Buck-01-the-Month Club.
Every Stanford Buck thus assist. 1
in making it possible for worth}
and needy athletes to receive a i
Stanford education.
Each Stanford B u c k receives j
monthly bulletins which report on j
the athletic program at Stanford and
each Stanford Buck making the ]
minimum contribution receives a
preferred ticket classification for all |
Stanford football games.
The largest single donation to dMe I
has been $2,200 and their are hun
dreds of "Big Bucks" who contribute
$50 or more each year.
At present there are 1,400 metn
| bers in the club who are spread over j
! the nation and in the outlying areas
of the United States. With the rise
! in tuition, the club will need an in-.
I creased membership and has set
$85,000 as its goal for this year.
Quite a furor has been raised
during the past several years
about the deplorable athletic
subsidization practices on many j
leading campuses throughout i
the nation.
Several schools have been ex
pelled from NCAA membership.
Others have been given a proba
! tionary status.
The Ivy League ilune out with its
j "code of ethics" stand and many
I schools have followed suit.
But, what about Stanford? How I
|do Mts athletes get through four
j years of college?
The answer is the Stanford Buck
! Club, a club that could easily be
said to have done so much for so
. little recognition. The Buck Club
: puts many Stanford athletes through
I school, but does so within strict
j compliance with the rules of the Pa
i cifie Coast Conference. The club
j doesn't need publicity, but can be
proud of the fact that publicity
doesn't hurt it.
In short, the members of the
I Stanford Buck Club are alumni and
friends of Stanford who contribute
j each year to tuition scholarships for
j students with athletic ability and
1 who demonstrate a real need for aid.
j It should be kept in mind that the
| scholarships go for tuition and tui
j lion only.
j 't he student never has the money
j in his possession. The gift donation
i is paid directly to Stanford in his
name. Full accounts of all contribu
tions are maintained and books are
kept on the campus which are al
ways open for inspection.
During the concluding atheltic
year the club granted $70,010 to 123
athletes, an average of better than
$550 per individual. Not every stu
dent received full tuition for three
i quarters as some dropped out of
school, some fell behind in their
grades (they must maintain a C av
erage), and a few found they no
longer needed aid.
While the major part of the Buck
Club aid goes to football, because
of the number who turn out for that
activity and because of the stronger
alumni interest, the other sports are
also greatly benefited.
A breakdown in scholarships re
* veals that 72 grants-in-aid went
for football, IK for basketball, l(i
for baseball, 10 for track, 5 for
swimming, and 2 for golf.
Football Coach Chuck Taylor has
emphasized the point many times
and other Card coaches are in
agreement when he says that "With

different in conferences like the Ivy

: puts many Stanford athletes through
I school, but does so within strict
j compliance with the rules of the Pa
i cifie Coast Conference. The club
j doesn't need publicity, but can be
proud of the fact that publicity
doesn't hurt it.
In short, the members of the
I Stanford Buck Club are alumni and
friends of Stanford who contribute
j each year to tuition scholarships for
j students with athletic ability and
1 who demonstrate a real need for aid.

kept on the campus which are al
ways open for inspection.
During the concluding atheltic
year the club granted $70,010 to 123
athletes, an average of better than
$550 per individual. Not every stu
dent received full tuition for three
i quarters as some dropped out of
school, some fell behind in their
grades (they must maintain a C av
erage), and a few found they no
longer needed aid.
While the major part of the Buck
Club aid goes to football, because
of the number who turn out for that
activity and because of the stronger
alumni interest, the other sports are
also greatly benefited.
A breakdown in scholarships re
* veals that 72 grants-in-aid went
for football, IK for basketball, l(i
for baseball, 10 for track, 5 for
swimming, and 2 for golf.
Football Coach Chuck Taylor has
emphasized the point many times
and other Card coaches are in
agreement when he says that "With
out Buck Club funds, we would find
[ it very difficult to compete with
| schools in our conference. It is much
different in conferences like the Ivy
1 | League where all schools are on the
1 i same financial and academic level,
j I In our conference there is a tremen
dous difference. It is a state vs. pri
vate school set-up."
Figures released from the Athletic
a Department show that less than 10
per cent of the top-flight high school
* athletes whom Stanford wants can
3 i be admitted to the University. The
j athlete who is qualified to enroll,

but hasn't the financial backing, ]
probably would go to a state school
unless Stanford helps him.
Many athletes enter the Univer
sity on scholastic scholarships, in ;
which case they don't need the
grants-in-aid, but the majority need
the help that the Buck Club offers.
Among the many outstanding I
principles of the Buck Club is the 1
fact that once an athlete is granted
aid he gets it for his full four years
at Stanford as long as he remains
active in sports.
The scholarship is subject to
need and is decided upon by the
Academic Scholarship Committee,
which tfives out the scholastic
scholarships as well. The athlete
must first and foremost he a stu
dent and keep his marks up.
The Buck Club is proud of the 1
fact that it continues its aid for the
full time even if a boy is injured. |
Last year, a veteran footballer had
his career ended when he injured a
knee.
He thought his Buck Club grant
would be discontinued and asked
Taylor if he might get a coaching
assistant's job to help him complete
his schooling. Taylor was able to
tell him that the Buck Club would
carry him through his four years of
college.
It isn't the club's purpose to turn
out top-grade athletes. Its view is
that the main purpose of the Uni

versity as far as athletes are con
cerned is to give them an education. ;
As long as sports are making a
contribution to the development ol j
individuals, without crowding the
main purpose of education, they are
considered worth while. When they
become the primary aim they are no
longer valuable.
As far as the mechanics of the I
club are concerned the minimum
dues for non-alumni or alumni to
become Stanford Bucks are $18 a
year. The original figure was $11'
when the club was organized as the
Buck-01-the-Month Club.
Every Stanford Buck thus assist. 1
in making it possible for worth}
and needy athletes to receive a i
Stanford education.
Each Stanford B u c k receives j
monthly bulletins which report on j
the athletic program at Stanford and
each Stanford Buck making the ]
minimum contribution receives a
preferred ticket classification for all |
Stanford football games.
The largest single donation to dMe I
has been $2,200 and their are hun
dreds of "Big Bucks" who contribute
$50 or more each year.
At present there are 1,400 metn
| bers in the club who are spread over j
! the nation and in the outlying areas
of the United States. With the rise
! in tuition, the club will need an in-.
I creased membership and has set
$85,000 as its goal for this year.
Quite a furor has been raised
during the past several years
about the deplorable athletic
subsidization practices on many j
leading campuses throughout i
the nation.
Several schools have been ex
pelled from NCAA membership.
Others have been given a proba
! tionary status.
The Ivy League ilune out with its
j "code of ethics" stand and many
I schools have followed suit.
But, what about Stanford? How I
