## 
### RUSS WILKS 
Stanford's three baseball
teams compiled a season's rec
ujd of 40 wins, 20 losses, and
three ties in a successful year
of play, despite the fact that the
Vuisily came out second best in
its league action.
Co , h Everett Dean, who was
•mining for his eennd straight PCC
iitl<.'. was disappointed but far from
<li heartened by his team's perform
n r. Hi* had 11is crew on top for
i In' entire season and then, "the lost
v\ H-.t nd. in »which Stanford drop
ped three tilt., and amassed two
" m the trio of contests, cost the
the Indians the league laurels.
!• igures don't lie! The Cards had
a l< ague team batting average of
.219, the lowest in the loop, but
a< cording to Dean took several con
t< t-. when they were outhit "with
good p'tching. strong down the mid
di: defense, some timely hitting, and
l!i( exploiting of our speed."
Trie Cards lose nine men via the
graduation route. Dean praised his
senior short .top, Warren Goodrich.
Goodrich, team captain, was elected
the best CIBA shortstop for the
third season in a row and was sec
ond in the balloting for "Most Val
u;.U< Player" behind teammate Ray
Y< j111! ~ Goodrich copped the MVP
award in his sophomore year. His
le .din ■ .tickwork garnered him the
Keeble desk set award.
Dean stated, "His hustle was an
inspiration which led the team in
its aggressive play.
Outgoing hurlers Don DeLong,
Mike Acker, and Phil Page were
i; u ed by Dean when he said they
would be sorely missed next season.
"They were always in condition to
do their best and among them had
many line pitching performances."
Colorful A 1 Talboy proved his
vi . atility by moving from right
field to first base. Dean called the
two errors that he was charged with
this season "questionable calls."
Tn y were the only two miscues in
his two years of competition at
S itn'ord. Dean stated, "A 1 loves the
ime and is a good hustler and
allele I ((j the life on the field."
I. < i'ves Gordon Galloway, Clarke

Nelson, Ralph Cassady, and Olie
Suzdaleff al.so came in for praise.
Galloway, despite a mid - season
injury, was termed a "greatly im
proved player," and catcher Nelson
showed up well in the appearances
he made.
Next season Dean will have a
wealth of talent to work with, in- !
eluding seven returning - starters, j
several promising junior college
transfers, and good talent from

the frosli ranks.
The pitching department figures to
| be strong with Young back to bol
! ster reserve chuckers Dave Free
| man, Ray Highsmith, and Gil Dun- 1
| can, a pair of JC dingers, and prom
| ising frosn hurlers including Ed j
; Verdurmen, Ral Looney, Dick Jones, |
Dan Bohnen, and Don Petters.
Len Swartz will be back at his J
! catching spot and Tom Dandurand !
and Dixie Workman will set a good j
chance to win the vacated first base
spot. Three-year man Rich Scrama
! glia will have the inside track at
second over Mickey Holzman and
frosh captain. Bob Fletcher and frosh
j shortstop Rudy Figueroa is the lead-
I ing candidate over George Selleck.
who can go at short or third.
Hal Messner and Stockton trans
fer Loyd Canton also figure to put
a claim in on the third sack "berth. ;
Sid Hall will return for what should 1
be his best year in center field and i
veteran Bob Evans also returns. |
Terry Evans, Workman, and frosh
candidates are also expected to be in
the battle for a garden spot.
The season is over, but already
5 the wheels are turning in prepara- !
| tion for that "till next year."
