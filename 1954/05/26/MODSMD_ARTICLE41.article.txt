# Long Best of Good Crowd In PCC Meet Spear Throw
## 
### 
With Stanford's Leo Long the
well-established favorite, a bulk of
the nation's best javelin throwers
will make the spear-throwing coin
petition one of the feature attrac
tions at the '24th annual Pacific Coast
Conference track meet at Seattle
Friday and Saturday.
Long, easily the leading collegiate
javelin artist in the country, has
already tossed 233-11,
Long should threaten the meet
mark and possibly the national col
legiate record of 237-10 held by Bill
Miller ol Arizona State at Tempe.
Although Long's recent perform

ances rank him as the class of the
field, eight other javelin throwers
who are among the best in the coun
try will be scrambling for points in
the PCC meet.
Oregon State's Jerry Church leads
the rest of the field with a toss of
2113-11. Dick Righter of Cal and Des
Koch of USC are right behind at
213-3% and 213 feet *ven.
The others with throws over 200
feet are Bob Kimball of the Cards
(211-5%), John Bugge, also of
Stanford Doyle Higdon of
Oregon (205-8), and Bruce West of
Idaho (200-I'4).
