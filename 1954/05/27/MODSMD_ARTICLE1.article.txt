# Yorty Hits 'New Look,' Calls for More Funds
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Samuel W. Yorty, Democratic
candidate for Senator, blasted
away at the current administra
tion and the "disgusting side
show that is now being put on
in Washington," last night be
fore the Political Union.
He hailed the "New Look" in the
administration's foreign policy as
nothing but the "old look" with a
postponement of military prepared
ness and a weakening of defense.
In reference to the recent Con
gressional action to reduce Air

Force appropriations by $5 billion,
Yorty maintained that we are play
ing right into the hands of the Com
munists by cutting out our strongest
line of attack.
The old Air Force program called
for 143 wings by 1957, Yorty said.
The "New Look" program, feigning
to call for a "great new security,"
has reduced the number of wings by
.six and extended the time limit by
two years.
He called it "an unprecedented
action in history to cut back military
power at a time when we hadn't yet
won the Korean war and signal our
retreat to the enemy."
"The administration," he declared,
"is cutting power merely to keep
campaign promises that, never
should have been made in the first
place."
Yorty hailed the .so-called "20
years of treason" as beginning to
look like "20 years of reason."
