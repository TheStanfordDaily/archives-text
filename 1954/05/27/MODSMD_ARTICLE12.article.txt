## Bidault To Ask Quick Ceasefire 
### 
BY UNITED PRESS, May 20â€”The
French government ordered Foreign
Minister Georges Bidault today to
press for a quick cease-fire in Indo
china, even if it means acccpting
some points of the "dishonorable"
Communist peace plan.
At a meeting lasting nearly three
hours, the cabinet expressed confi
dence that Bidault would be able to
win a settlement essentially follow
ing the fines laid down by Premiei
Joseph Laniel.
In Geneva, the United States
warned that Western acceptance of
the new Communist cease-fire pro
posal would mean a dishonorable
peace and eventual loss of all Indo
china to the Reds.
U.S. Undersecretary of State Wal
ter Bedell Smith expressed Ameri
can opposition to the armistice plan
proposed by the Communist Viet
Minh which would partition Viet
Nam, Cambodia, and Laos.
The American delegation has said
that the United States feels that
Burma and Thailand would be
threatened seriously by a partition
ing of Laos and Cambodia.
Bidault's comments at today's cab
inet meeting were officially secret.
But it was learned he told the cab
inet he believes some concessions
can be wrung from the Reds if they
are convinced the United States,
Britain, and France will act together
against Communism in Indochina if
the Geneva talks fail.
Britain has been consistently cool
toward proposals for united action,
but Bidault said British officials now
'are "less opposed" to the idea.
Meanwhile, in Indochina the Red
Viet Minh rebels hurled 20,000
troops against tho southern Red
River delta town of yen Phu today
in an assault that threatened to
turn the besieged outpost into a new
Dien Bien Phu.
French high command sources
said that if the outpost falls the road
will be open to Phu Ly which in
turn controls the whole southern
delta area and the gateway to Hanoi.
