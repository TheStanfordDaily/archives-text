# Excom Hears Proposals For Cabinet, Legislature
## Student Government Com Asserts Excom 'Inadequate' 
### WALT WILLIAMS Associate Editor, The Daily 
A proposal to abolish the present Executive Committee and
replace it with a legislative group composed of 30 to 36 elected
representatives and a 15-man cabinet was presented to Excom
last night.
The proposal was included in the report of the ASSU Committee

on Student Government.
Excom members spent four hours
discussing the recommendations, and
had not taken any action at the
time The Daily went to press.
Most of the discussion centered
on the status of ASSU administra
tive board presidents as voting mem
bers of the cabinet, and on the re
lationship between the student man
ager and the student controller, a
new post suggested by the commit
tee.
The committee's recommendations
call for the setting up of a legisla
tive body made up of area repre
sentatives elected from campus liv
ing groups, and a cabinet composed
of the ASSU president and vice
president, the five class presidents,
the presidents of the seven ASSU
administrative boards, and a coun
selor. The student manager and
student controller would be ex-of
ffcio members.
In making the recommendations,
Tom Bnrtlett, member of the student
government committee, asserted that,
the present. Excom organization is
too small to pr.ovide adequate rep
resentation, and yet too large and
unsuited by its composition to be an
effective executive body.
Under the suggested system, the
cabinet, would consider and develop
policy and draw up motions to be
presented to the entire legislature for
consideration.
The committee suggested thai, the
student manager be the presiding
officer over the legislature.
The committee also recommended
that the duties of the present stu
dent. manager be broken down and
divided between the manager and
the new office of student controller.
Committee members pointed out
that the office of ASSU president
should be strengthened, and that the
student manager should act as an
advisor and assistant to the presi
dent. Under this system, financial
details would be handled by the
student controller.
The only changes recommended in
the judicial branch of student, gov
ernment were proposals to change
the name of the Council for Student
Control to the Judicial Council and
to include a counselor in the mem
bership of the Council.
