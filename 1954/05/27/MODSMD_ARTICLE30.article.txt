# For the Future
## 
### 
Two weeks ago we presented our opinions
on what we called an exampie (and just one ex
ample) of Administration discouragement of a
worthwhile student activity — the academic
freedom discussion program.
Last week we outlined the apparent reasons
for such discouragement and lay the bulk of
responsibility on the University's excessive
emphasis on public relations.
Our comments in both these editorials
amounted to what we consider valid, but nega
tive criticism of the Administration.
But we do not want the subject to end there.
Rather we want to turn our attention to a posi
tive and constructive suggestion for the future.
That future concerns Stanford, but not just as
a name or a reputation or an expanding campus.
It concerns Stanford as a body of several thou
sand students with individual and youthful in
stincts for inquiry and thought and action.
And it concerns the contribution to society
that those students will make after they leave
Stanford.
We have already stated that we think those
instincts should be encouraged, to the end that
each graduate will contribute an inquiring mind
and an expressive voice to his world.
And we have already stated that we think
the present Stanford student has occasionally
been discouraged from such inquiry and ex
pression, by an expanding University that is
public relations conscious on "touchy" sub

jects.
The "touchy" subjects are, however, the vi
tally important subjects that the modern Amer
ican must face if he is to succeed in the present
conflict between freedom and fear and the
present struggle between democracy and total
itarianism. They are subjects within the realm
of politics; they touch upon communism- and
fascism and the personalities of each.
Our suggestion is simple, and an obvious ex
tension of all that we have said. We suggest
that the students be allowed to join together
to discuss such subjects and to speak out on
such issues. We suggest that each member of
the Administration re-examine his views to
ward such activity and acknowledge the stu
dent's right to that activity.
In recent years we have detected an in
creased recognition of the student by the Ad
ministration. We have watched with satisfac
tion such efforts as the "Stanford—Today and
Tomorrow" program and have been aware of
that recognition.
But what we ask for now, what we suggest
now, is that the student be directly recognized
as more than a future alumnus and a potential
fund raiser.
We ask that he be recognized as a mature
and responsible citizen of this community and
of this nation.
He is capable of that position—if he is given
the trust and encouragement he deserves.
