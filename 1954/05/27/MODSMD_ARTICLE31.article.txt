# Advance on the Honor Code
## 
### 
Throughout the year we have editorialized
several times on the Honor Code — what it
means to Stanford and what it means to the in
dividual student. Now, with the end of another
school year less than two weeks away, we
would like to summarize and appraise the ac
complishments that have been made in this
area during the last three quarters.
A special committee was set up by the Ex
ecutive Committee to study the Code, investi
gate stuednt opinion, and present their findings
to Excom.
A questionnaire was circulated among 2,384
students, and the results of that survey weie
presented to Excom in the form of the recom
mended changes in the by I<jws of the ASSU
Constitution.
The committee realized that this "deeper
problem" than the question of exams taken
from the classroom was essentially one of ori

entation and education and the need for closer
co-operation between students and the faculty.
For these reasons, Excom approved the rec
ommendation that the Honor Code orientation
program be expanded and that an annual dis
cussion program be held to educate the stu
dents in specific procedures and to "invigorate
social attitudes" regarding the Code.
The by-law change adopted provides for con
ditions under which students and faculty will
be able to work together to establish conditions
for optimum academic performance.
A specific and absolute decision on the ques
tion of taking exams outside the classroom has
not been formulated, but definite progress has
been made on the deeper problem cited above.
We feel that the committee and Excom
should be commended for the constructive ad
vances they have made in this area during the
year.
