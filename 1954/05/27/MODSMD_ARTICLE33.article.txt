## From Another Viewpoint 
### 
Good-bye, '54. The hours of spring i
are idling to their close as you pre- |
pare to strike your tents (and what !
is there fairer than the Farm in j
spring?). But if it is sad to see so
•ioodly a company depart, it is sad
der to reHect upon what the past
lour years might have been.
Four long years ago you burst
upon the Farm alight with eager
ness, excitement, curiosity and hope. ,
Today in how many of you has ea- !
gerness been replaced by apathy, !
excitement by boredom and curios- !
ity by indifference until there re- \
mains only Hope, that perennial
weed of the human spirit. Four
years ago a distinguished columnist
called you "the hope of the ages," }
adding, "Talk ,to one of the mid
century freshmen and you have
talked to all—and to all that is best
and most worth saving in civiliza- ;
tion." What would he write of you
today ?
Oh, you are still the hope of the
ages. But how much better an
answer to man's desiring might
you bring if Stanford, grown too
large for the old ways to suffice,
had overcome the handicap of
size?
Many a recent faculty committee
and student group have furrowed
brows over this problem. If '58, soon
to tread upon your heels, fares bet
ter than did you, it will be in part
because the Stanford family came to
grips with what might be called the
"Three C's": contact, confidence and
curriculum. What would it have i
meant to your Stanford career if
there had been a closer relationship
between you and the faculty, a i
greater mutual respect, and under- '
graduate instruction better adapted
to the individuals' needs?
The greatest deficiency lay in too j
little closer contact with your teach- !
ers from the time you were fresh- j
men. It is a small thing, perhaps, I
but if Pie-reg Week had included I
a visit with a faculty member at j
home, if during that first year your i
Lower Division advisers and you |
had exchanged dinner visits, might ;
you not have supported more read- \
ily the efforts in later years to draw I

faculty members into the life of the
living groups? There might have
been more than one such company
as the mis-named "Cynics" shang
hai-ing faculty members at fort- [
nightly intervals for off-the-record I
discussions. And what if there had 1
been (as there once was at Stan
ford) a student group engineering
opportunities for you to see the fac
ulty animal in his native habitat?
Or if tea were served each afternoon

in some convenient spot like the
Women's Clubhouse to such faculty
and students as might drop by?
(Such a "Faculty - Student Club"
once flourished on the Farm.)
Living groups and student ac
tivities might have made greater
use of faculty members for run
ning interference where a knowl
edge of University ropes or a
friend at court was needed. More
professors might have resorted to
individual conferences with all
the students in their courses and
more students might have availed
themselves of the scheduled office
hours.
If they did nothing else these and

similar measures would have spared j
us now (when business firms and j
draft boards need letters) that I
plaintive refrain, "But 1 don't know
anyone on the faculty."
Of the question of confidence, the !
second of our Three C's, space per
mits speaking only of one point. De
spite your cherished institutions of
self-government, the Stanford fam
ily as a whole (which includes you)
did not expect you quite to exhibit
the maturity and to shoulder the te
sponsibility of which, as the war
i showed us, men and women of col
i lege age are fully capable. You have
J moral and intellectual resources
i which could have been better mobi
i lized and exploited if there had been
I closer contact, greater confidence,
; and a curriculum to challenge your
! abilities. Certainly as seniors you
j were adult members of the Stanford
| community; you might have acted
and been treated more like it.
And finally as to the curricu
lum. the last of the Three C's.
Wouldn't you agree that many of
I you might have been saved from
plopping into the "sophomore
slump at the end of your first year
thereafter to drift about the misty
flats of mediocrity or to seek in
unfocussed student activities an
outlet for academic frustrations?
The flame of excitement and ad
-1 venture with which you ap
proached Stanford four years ago
and which flickered and died in
the sophomore year, that grave
yard of the collegiate mind, might
have fed upon a different and
more challenging curriculum.
How many of you ever really had
j enough to do?
The furrowed brows have made
many a suggestion ranging from a
second core course following upon
Western Civilization to a four-year
program of studies for majors in the
Humanities and Sciences. But per
haps the most important of these
curriculum "might-have-beens" are
the measures which, while stopping
short of tempering the wind to the
shorn lamb, would have met the
needs of the superior student: inde
pendent study, an honors program
in each major, more undergraduate
seminars, and latitude for those gift
ed mavericks who do not take to the
Procrustean bed of our present sys
tem. Most of you would have risen
to the challenge of high hurdles in
a curriculum that made sense to you
just as you have always done in
sports or extracurricular activities.
The yeast is in the loaf. Stanford,
good step-dame, welcomed you four
years ago. Watching you now make
ready for the high road beyond
Commencement, she promises (if the
auguries are to be trusted) that four
years hence '58 shall look back with
less to regret of what might have
been. Good-bye, '54.

J moral and intellectual resources
i which could have been better mobi
i lized and exploited if there had been
I closer contact, greater confidence,
; and a curriculum to challenge your
! abilities. Certainly as seniors you
j were adult members of the Stanford

and been treated more like it.
And finally as to the curricu
lum. the last of the Three C's.
Wouldn't you agree that many of
I you might have been saved from
plopping into the "sophomore
slump at the end of your first year
thereafter to drift about the misty
flats of mediocrity or to seek in
unfocussed student activities an
outlet for academic frustrations?
The flame of excitement and ad
-1 venture with which you ap
proached Stanford four years ago
and which flickered and died in
the sophomore year, that grave
yard of the collegiate mind, might
have fed upon a different and
more challenging curriculum.
How many of you ever really had
j enough to do?
The furrowed brows have made
many a suggestion ranging from a
second core course following upon
Western Civilization to a four-year
program of studies for majors in the
Humanities and Sciences. But per
haps the most important of these
curriculum "might-have-beens" are
the measures which, while stopping
short of tempering the wind to the
shorn lamb, would have met the
needs of the superior student: inde
pendent study, an honors program
in each major, more undergraduate
seminars, and latitude for those gift
ed mavericks who do not take to the
Procrustean bed of our present sys
tem. Most of you would have risen
to the challenge of high hurdles in
a curriculum that made sense to you
just as you have always done in
sports or extracurricular activities.
The yeast is in the loaf. Stanford,
good step-dame, welcomed you four
years ago. Watching you now make
ready for the high road beyond
Commencement, she promises (if the
auguries are to be trusted) that four
years hence '58 shall look back with
less to regret of what might have
been. Good-bye, '54.


JAMES T. WATKINS IV
—"Three C's"
Good-bye, '54. The hours of spring i
are idling to their close as you pre- |
pare to strike your tents (and what !
is there fairer than the Farm in j
spring?). But if it is sad to see so
•ioodly a company depart, it is sad
der to reHect upon what the past
lour years might have been.
Four long years ago you burst
upon the Farm alight with eager
ness, excitement, curiosity and hope. ,
Today in how many of you has ea- !
gerness been replaced by apathy, !
excitement by boredom and curios- !
ity by indifference until there re- \
mains only Hope, that perennial
weed of the human spirit. Four
years ago a distinguished columnist
called you "the hope of the ages," }
adding, "Talk ,to one of the mid
century freshmen and you have
talked to all—and to all that is best
and most worth saving in civiliza- ;
tion." What would he write of you
today ?
Oh, you are still the hope of the
ages. But how much better an
answer to man's desiring might
you bring if Stanford, grown too
large for the old ways to suffice,
had overcome the handicap of
size?
Many a recent faculty committee
and student group have furrowed
brows over this problem. If '58, soon
to tread upon your heels, fares bet
ter than did you, it will be in part
because the Stanford family came to
grips with what might be called the
"Three C's": contact, confidence and
curriculum. What would it have i
meant to your Stanford career if
there had been a closer relationship
between you and the faculty, a i
greater mutual respect, and under- '
graduate instruction better adapted
to the individuals' needs?
The greatest deficiency lay in too j
little closer contact with your teach- !
ers from the time you were fresh- j
men. It is a small thing, perhaps, I
but if Pie-reg Week had included I
a visit with a faculty member at j
home, if during that first year your i
Lower Division advisers and you |
had exchanged dinner visits, might ;
you not have supported more read- \
ily the efforts in later years to draw I

faculty members into the life of the
living groups? There might have
been more than one such company
as the mis-named "Cynics" shang
hai-ing faculty members at fort- [
nightly intervals for off-the-record I
discussions. And what if there had 1
been (as there once was at Stan
ford) a student group engineering
opportunities for you to see the fac
ulty animal in his native habitat?
Or if tea were served each afternoon

in some convenient spot like the
Women's Clubhouse to such faculty
and students as might drop by?
(Such a "Faculty - Student Club"
once flourished on the Farm.)
Living groups and student ac
tivities might have made greater
use of faculty members for run
ning interference where a knowl
edge of University ropes or a
friend at court was needed. More
professors might have resorted to
individual conferences with all
the students in their courses and
more students might have availed
themselves of the scheduled office
hours.
If they did nothing else these and

similar measures would have spared j
us now (when business firms and j
draft boards need letters) that I
plaintive refrain, "But 1 don't know
anyone on the faculty."
Of the question of confidence, the !
second of our Three C's, space per
mits speaking only of one point. De
spite your cherished institutions of
self-government, the Stanford fam
ily as a whole (which includes you)
did not expect you quite to exhibit
the maturity and to shoulder the te
sponsibility of which, as the war
i showed us, men and women of col
i lege age are fully capable. You have
J moral and intellectual resources
i which could have been better mobi
i lized and exploited if there had been
I closer contact, greater confidence,
; and a curriculum to challenge your
! abilities. Certainly as seniors you
