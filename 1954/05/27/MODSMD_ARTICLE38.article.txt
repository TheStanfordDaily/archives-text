# Golfers to Defend Crown In Houston on June 20-24
## 
### 
For the fifth time in five years,
golf coach Charles "Bud" Finger
will take a powerful contingent
of Stanford linksters East for the
National Intercollegiate Golf
championships.
However, there's a difference this
year. The Indians won the last tour
ney and thereby will be the de
fending champs in the affair, which
will open in Houston, Texas, on
June 20 and run for four days.
This year's squad, with four re
taining veterans from last season's
titlists, is given a good chance to
repeat. A tournament of this type,
with up to ten top teams entered, is
extremely difficult to win twice in a
row.
Only North Texas State's great
post-win- teams have been successful
in dominating the classic year in
and year out. although Stanford's
pre-war clubs were frequent win
ners.
Tourney scoring goes like this: six
players from each school play 36
holes with the low four counting
for the team total.
I.ast year's Indian golfers toured
the Broadmoor, Colorado, course
in 57S strokes to triumph by three
over their closest competitors.
The low four were Warren Dailey.
Fred Brown. Grant Spaeth, and
Stu Ledbetter. Only Ledhetter has
graduated.
The individual championship is
decided by match play. Dailey and
Brown have both reached the quar
ter-fiAils in past years.
Two very promising sophomore*
will round out this year's squad:
Phil Getchell, who was the medal
ist in the Northern California Ama
teur championships last week, and
Chuck Van Linge,
