# PUNTS AND PITCHES
## On Standards and Records 
### PETE GROTHE 
You've probably heard of footballers Jackie Jensen, Paul Larson, Jon
Arnett. Paul Cameron, and Tom Schabarum. They all tried to get into
Stanford and all were rejected, except Schabarum, because of grades.
Schabarum had the grades but applied too late. USC basketballer Kenny
Flower, one of the great guards in PCC history, defperately wanted to
come to Stanford, but didn't have the grades. Current Cal track stars
- Hon Bauer and Jim Plessas and USC cindermen Bill

Taylor and Frank Flores were rejected for the same
reasons.
That these men could have helped Stanford ath
letic teams is so obvious that it doesn't need any dis
cussion. Don Liebendorfer reports that less than 10
per cent of the outstanding prep athletes whom we
want can he admitted, and that Stanford has the
stiffcst entrance requirements on the Pacific Coast.
Further, Liebendorfer says, "When you hear of an
outstanding high school athlete registering at Stanford,
take your hat off to that boy; thelchances are 100 to 1

that he is doing so at an immediate financial sacrifice. Purely from the
standpoint of dollars and cents over the four year period of his college
career, he could have done better .elsewhere. Stanford adheres strictly
lo the Pacific Coast Conference Code and maks no 'deals'."
Compare USC and Stanford. The Trojans give 36 track scholarships.
Stanford has nine. There isn't a USC football player on the first three
strings who doesn t have a scholarship. This doesn't include payments
for such work as sweeping the snow out of the Coliseum. On the other
hand. America's most-sought athlete in the last 30 years, Bob Mathias,
paid his own way to Stanford. Further, seven of the offensive starters
on Staniord s 1952 Rose Bowl team didn't have athletic scholarships.
Considering the above facts, one would think that Stanford teams have
been losers. This is not the case. Since !X!M. Stanford has won 365 foot
ball games, lost 1 US. and tied 3!). Stanford's all-time basketball record
is -110 wins and 295 losses. There is not a sport in which Stanford wins
don't far overshadow its losses.
Within the last 15 years, the Indians have garnered national champion
ships in basketball, lootball, and golf. They have placed among the top
four in swimming and track and won the PCC in baseball. The trackmen
from a single university, Stanford, have set 18 world records. The Farm
has turned out athletes like Bob Mathias, Ernie Nevers, Frankie Albert,
Hank Luisetti. Ben Eastman, Bob Garrett, George Yardley, Jack Shep
ard, Chuck Taylor, Lawson Little, Bud Held, Ted Schroeder, Norm
Standlee, and Otis Chandler.
What we're trying to say in this, our last sports column, is that
praise is due. Praise, in abundant portions, is due to Stanford's terrific
stall ol coaches and to the athletes who have compiled an enviable
record against staggering odds.
There are other things we want to say. We want to say that 82.2 per
cent ol the footballers and basketballers graduate, as compared to ihe
all-men's average of 75 per cent. We want to cite the example of the
well-known Stanford athlete who was assured ol a new convertible if
he went to USC. We want to venture the opinion that Stanford athletes are
high caliber persons as well as being high caliber athletes.
Sure, there will be lean moments in the future, as there have been in
the past. Disgruntled grads like Dick Hyland are going to suggest that
Stanford j;ive up athletics and bury itself under the tall pine outside
ol Palo Alto. But we wouldn't for a moment consider lowering Stanford's
entrance requirements and giving "deals" on the side just to have per
petual winners. Stanford has done all right while adhering to the rules
of amateurism in the past.
It will continue to do all right in the future.

paid his own way to Stanford. Further, seven of the offensive starters
on Staniord s 1952 Rose Bowl team didn't have athletic scholarships.
Considering the above facts, one would think that Stanford teams have
been losers. This is not the case. Since !X!M. Stanford has won 365 foot
ball games, lost 1 US. and tied 3!). Stanford's all-time basketball record
is -110 wins and 295 losses. There is not a sport in which Stanford wins
don't far overshadow its losses.
Within the last 15 years, the Indians have garnered national champion
ships in basketball, lootball, and golf. They have placed among the top
four in swimming and track and won the PCC in baseball. The trackmen
from a single university, Stanford, have set 18 world records. The Farm
has turned out athletes like Bob Mathias, Ernie Nevers, Frankie Albert,
Hank Luisetti. Ben Eastman, Bob Garrett, George Yardley, Jack Shep
ard, Chuck Taylor, Lawson Little, Bud Held, Ted Schroeder, Norm
Standlee, and Otis Chandler.
What we're trying to say in this, our last sports column, is that
praise is due. Praise, in abundant portions, is due to Stanford's terrific
stall ol coaches and to the athletes who have compiled an enviable
record against staggering odds.
There are other things we want to say. We want to say that 82.2 per
cent ol the footballers and basketballers graduate, as compared to ihe
all-men's average of 75 per cent. We want to cite the example of the
well-known Stanford athlete who was assured ol a new convertible if
he went to USC. We want to venture the opinion that Stanford athletes are
high caliber persons as well as being high caliber athletes.
Sure, there will be lean moments in the future, as there have been in
the past. Disgruntled grads like Dick Hyland are going to suggest that
Stanford j;ive up athletics and bury itself under the tall pine outside
ol Palo Alto. But we wouldn't for a moment consider lowering Stanford's
entrance requirements and giving "deals" on the side just to have per
petual winners. Stanford has done all right while adhering to the rules
of amateurism in the past.
It will continue to do all right in the future.

You've probably heard of footballers Jackie Jensen, Paul Larson, Jon
Arnett. Paul Cameron, and Tom Schabarum. They all tried to get into
Stanford and all were rejected, except Schabarum, because of grades.
Schabarum had the grades but applied too late. USC basketballer Kenny
Flower, one of the great guards in PCC history, defperately wanted to
come to Stanford, but didn't have the grades. Current Cal track stars
- Hon Bauer and Jim Plessas and USC cindermen Bill

Taylor and Frank Flores were rejected for the same
reasons.
That these men could have helped Stanford ath
letic teams is so obvious that it doesn't need any dis
cussion. Don Liebendorfer reports that less than 10
per cent of the outstanding prep athletes whom we
want can he admitted, and that Stanford has the
stiffcst entrance requirements on the Pacific Coast.
Further, Liebendorfer says, "When you hear of an
outstanding high school athlete registering at Stanford,
take your hat off to that boy; thelchances are 100 to 1

that he is doing so at an immediate financial sacrifice. Purely from the
standpoint of dollars and cents over the four year period of his college
career, he could have done better .elsewhere. Stanford adheres strictly
lo the Pacific Coast Conference Code and maks no 'deals'."
Compare USC and Stanford. The Trojans give 36 track scholarships.
Stanford has nine. There isn't a USC football player on the first three
strings who doesn t have a scholarship. This doesn't include payments
for such work as sweeping the snow out of the Coliseum. On the other
hand. America's most-sought athlete in the last 30 years, Bob Mathias,
paid his own way to Stanford. Further, seven of the offensive starters
on Staniord s 1952 Rose Bowl team didn't have athletic scholarships.
