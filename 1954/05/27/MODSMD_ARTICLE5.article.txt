# Candidate Calls Geneva U.S.'s 'Greatest Failure'
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Samuel Yorty, the diminutive, energetic Democratis Senatorial
candidate, told The Daily last night that Geneva represents Amer
ica's "greatest diplomatic failure since the end of the war."
Yorty, sporting a blue suit and a gray tie, said, "America had
had the diplomatic leadership ever since the end of the war. We

lost it at Geneva, because we con
ceded that we wouldn't take the ro
tating chairmanship if Red China
also didn't take it. There were other
factors: Ever since the New Look,
we didn't have the power to back
up our words. Our Secretary of
State flew back home after only a
day or two at Geneva.
"Mind you, this is a conference
that can make the difference be
tween world peace and world war.
And we have been a dismal flop."
The mustached Yorty, who is try
ing to unseat the appointed incum
bent, Thomas Kuchel, was confident
about the primary. He said:
"Despite Republican propaganda,
the GOP has almost conceded the
Democratic nomination to me at the
primaries. After that, when the is
sues come clear, I think I can beat
Kuchel. Kuchel just doesn't, say
much or seem to take any stands.

"He's claiming he should be re
elected so he can support the Eisen
hower program. And yet in the
piece of legislation that Eisenhower
fought the hardest, the Bricker
amendment, Kuchel voted for it."
The Southern California Con
gressman also touched upon the Mc-
Carthy hearings:
"It shows a lack of leadership.
Eisehhower should never have let
things get out of hand and let a
Senator whom he supported for
election fight with one of his own
cabinet members."
In regard to the $6,0000,00 House
slash in funds for the Student Ex
change program, Yorty said, "This
is another example of the GOP try
ing to keep a rash campaign promise
of balancing the budget and being
penn wise and pound foolish."
