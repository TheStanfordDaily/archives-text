## Long, USC Favored In PCC Meet 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Leo Long and the 3C Trojans
are odds on to win when the best
track men in the Pacific Coast
Conference hook up in the
league cinder finals today and
tomorrow in Seattle.
Long, who will bo Stanford's big
threat in the NCAA trackfest next
month, should out-throw his javelin
opponents almost as easily as SC
will outscorc the rest of the teams
for its 14th consecutive PCC meet
win.
Coach Jack Weiershauser, Train
er Connie Jarvis, and the Tribe's
15 entries flew to Seattle yesterday
afternoon for the festivities. They
will return Sunday, probably with
a third-place finish to their credit.
Long, the proud possessor of the
school record of 233-11, hasn't been
vanquished by a collegian this year,
and with Bob Kimball and John
Bugge tossing over 200 feet, the jav
elin should be Stanford's best event.
Gerry Wood could well be another
Card winner in Seattle. Until last
week at Modesto when he was both
ered by a cold, Wood was unbeaten
against collegiate high hurdlers.
Willard Wright of the Trojans lost
to Wood in a dual meet, at Fresno,
and in the heat at Modesto, but in
the finals he led the Stanford speed
ster to the tape. Wood, who ripped
off a 14.1 clocking against the wind,
will be out for revenge.
Keith Brownsberger will be buck
ing, SC's Joe Graffio and Howard
Bugbee and Washington State's Bob
Gary in the 100. The Trojans' Jim
Lea, the best 440 man in the country
today, will join the 220 field.
Walt Garrett will fight for the
runner-up position behind Lea in
the quarter-mile against Steve Tur
ner of Cal, Rod Wigler and Mike
Larrabee of SC. Stanford captain
Fred George did not make the trip,
but Larry Spicer will run.
Lea will anchor SC's "bound-to
win" relay quartet, which has cov
ered the mile in 3:10.7. The Tribe,
with Brownsberger, Wood, Spicer,
and Garrett handling the baton pass
ing, figures second ahead of Cal.
If Jim Luttrell, the soph who has
tripped over the lows in 23.5, has
recovered from his leg injury, Stan
ford will have a threat in the 220-
yard low hurdles. John Morgan of
SC and Bob Leadbettcr of Washing
ton will be his toughest foes.
Ernie Shelton looks like the only
man to bet on in the high jump (the
SC ace will be shooting for seven
feet), but the Cards' John Stew
art looks good for second.
A 1 Cheney will fight it out with
Cal's big guns, John Stellern and
Charles Butt, in the shot put. The
Indian junior figures third.
Bill Flint will enter the pole vault,
where Cal's Larry Anderson is fa
vored, and Chuck Strong and Bob
Reed will try their luck in the two
mile.
