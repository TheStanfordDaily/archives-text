### 
(LditiM s note: The nine ASSU foreign scholars who have lived at
Stanford this past year have written the following letter to Stan
ford students:)
"The time has come when we must leave for home.
We have been your guests for a whole year.
You have made our stay in Stanford an unforgettable memory.
We have come to know you as we have exchanged our ideas.
We have become friends.
Understanding between peoples cannot be enforced by conferences
or elaborate scheme s: it is the living together, the simple talk from man
to man which forms a bridge. This is what made our stay in Stanford
so valuable.
In our time whole anxiety and fear, threat and uncertainty sur
round us we do need this mutual exchange, the mutual understand
ing more than ever. Only when we learn to respect and esteem each
other can we hope to preserve peace in our world. This exchange was
a step toward this goal and as we return to our home countries, let
us say to you:
Thank you all for your understanding and your great hospitality.
You have won us as friends."
