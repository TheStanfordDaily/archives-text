# Excom Accepts Proposal For Constitution Revision
## Legislature, Cabinet Plan Wins OK 
### WALT WILLIAMS By-LAW STRUCTURE 
A recommendation to replace
the present Executive Commit
tee with a legislature composed
of 3C elected representatives
and a 15-man cabinet was ac
cepted by Excom late Wednes
day night.
The recommendation was included
in the report of the ASSU Commit
tee on Student Qovernment.
Acceptance by a 12 to 2 vote came
after midnight, following more than
four hours of discussion.
The report will be passed on to the
new Excom next fall quarter for ac
tion.
The cabinet called for would in- !
elude the ASSU president and vice
president, the five class presidents,
chairmen of eight ASSU administra
tive boards, and a counselor.
The counselor would advise the
legislature and cabinet on judicial
matters. He would be appointed by
the Judicial Council, now known as
the Council for Student Control.
The student manager and student
controller, another new post recom
mended by the committee, would be ,
ex-officio members of the cabinet.
The committee urged that the du- ■
ties of the present student manager !
be divided between the manager and j
student controller. The controller !
would handle the budget and fi
nances of the ASSU -Students' Or
ganizations Fund.
This system would leave the stu- j
dent manager free to serve as an as
sistant to the president and secre- j
tary to the legislature and cabinet, j
Steve Horn, former student
manager, objected to the division
of the manager's duties. He as
serted that the manager should
retain final control over ASSU
funds, and that under the new
system the controller would be
little more than a "clerk."
Robert von Pagcnhardt, member
of the student government com
mittee, replied that the suggestion
was "a logical forward step." He
said the present student manager
is burdened with duties, and the
minutiae of financial details could
he handled more efficiently by the
controller.
Much discussion also centered on
the status of ASSU administrative
board presidents as voting members
of the cabinet. The eight boards
which would have representatives
on the body would be Cardinals,
AWS, lIR, Social, Political Union
and Speech Association, Publica
tions, and two new boards. Educa
tion and University Affairs, and Cul
tural.
Von Pagenhardt explained that
the committee's recommendations
were based on the following con
clusions on the present student gov
ernment system:
1. Excom does not truly represent
i the students, due to a "lack of rep
i resentativc quality."
2. Excom has insufficient consul-
I tation and co-operation and lacks
j cohesiveness.
3. It is difficult for Excom to de
j iineatc between its legislative and
executive duties.
4. Communication within and be
yond student government could be
improved.
5. The president's executive re
sponsibility is weakened by the
president constitutional system.

said the present student manager
is burdened with duties, and the
minutiae of financial details could
he handled more efficiently by the
controller.
Much discussion also centered on
the status of ASSU administrative
board presidents as voting members
of the cabinet. The eight boards
which would have representatives
on the body would be Cardinals,
AWS, lIR, Social, Political Union
and Speech Association, Publica
tions, and two new boards. Educa
tion and University Affairs, and Cul
tural.
Von Pagenhardt explained that
the committee's recommendations
were based on the following con
clusions on the present student gov
ernment system:
1. Excom does not truly represent
i the students, due to a "lack of rep
i resentativc quality."
2. Excom has insufficient consul-
I tation and co-operation and lacks
j cohesiveness.
3. It is difficult for Excom to de
j iineatc between its legislative and
executive duties.
4. Communication within and be
yond student government could be
improved.
5. The president's executive re
sponsibility is weakened by the
president constitutional system.

A recommendation to replace
the present Executive Commit
tee with a legislature composed
of 3C elected representatives
and a 15-man cabinet was ac
cepted by Excom late Wednes
day night.
The recommendation was included
in the report of the ASSU Commit
tee on Student Qovernment.
Acceptance by a 12 to 2 vote came
after midnight, following more than
four hours of discussion.
The report will be passed on to the
new Excom next fall quarter for ac
tion.
The cabinet called for would in- !
elude the ASSU president and vice
president, the five class presidents,
chairmen of eight ASSU administra
tive boards, and a counselor.
The counselor would advise the
legislature and cabinet on judicial
matters. He would be appointed by
the Judicial Council, now known as
the Council for Student Control.
The student manager and student
controller, another new post recom
mended by the committee, would be ,
ex-officio members of the cabinet.
The committee urged that the du- ■
ties of the present student manager !
be divided between the manager and j
student controller. The controller !
would handle the budget and fi
nances of the ASSU -Students' Or
ganizations Fund.
This system would leave the stu- j
dent manager free to serve as an as
sistant to the president and secre- j
tary to the legislature and cabinet, j
Steve Horn, former student
manager, objected to the division
of the manager's duties. He as
serted that the manager should
retain final control over ASSU
funds, and that under the new
system the controller would be
little more than a "clerk."
Robert von Pagcnhardt, member
of the student government com
mittee, replied that the suggestion
was "a logical forward step." He
said the present student manager
is burdened with duties, and the
minutiae of financial details could
he handled more efficiently by the
controller.
