# Preferential Voting System Is Abolished
## 
### 
Preferential voting in ASSU elec
tions was abolished late Wednesday
night when the Executive Commit
tee voted to drop the present system
of balloting and replace it with the
direct primary and final.
Under the new system, only the
top two candidates in the primary
will be carried over to the final
election.
Excom also voted to make write
in candidates legal in the primary
but not in the final.
Other changes in election proce
dure adopted include provisions for
two-day elections, with polls closing I
at 1:30 p.m. the second day; the es- |
tablishment of one central polling j
booth in the Library area; and con- j
tinuation of the Village polling j
booth.
The election procedure revisions
were presented by Nancy Nichol
son, Women's Row representative to
Excom and chairman of the com
mittee set up by Excom to study
ASSU elections. They were adopted
by a 7 to 6 vote, with one absten
tion.
Miss Nicholson asserted her rec
ommendations would simplify the
elections, and result in greater em
phasis on specific issues rather than
on personalities alone.
Sophomore class representative
John Spraguc voiced opposition to
the change and charged that stu
dents understand the present pref
erential system, and that the direct
method of election would "unneces
sarily limit" the number of candi
dates.
"Under the direct election, 20 per
cent of the electorate could choose
the two candidates who will be car
ried over to the finals," he asserted.
