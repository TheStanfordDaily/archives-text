# DAILY EDITORIALS—FEATURES
## To The Daily 
### 
It is the tradition that this last editorial of the
year be in the form of a personal letter from the
outgoing editor to the new editor. The tradi
tion demands that I milk my sentiments and
say, "Do this—do this—do this" to the person
who will succeed me.
But you will excuse me, Pat, if I break another
tradition and address these last words to the
whole staff.
You will excuse me because you will realize
as I do that the editor of The Daily is not and
should not be an isolated figure whose success
*is dependent on his own talents and whims.
His success is the success of The Daily. And
The Daily is not one person—it is the combined
efforts and personalities of the 70 or 80 indi
viduals who contribute to its production.
To those individuals, to the staff, I address
these comments.
Each of you has made individual sacrifices
for a newspaper that offers little material re
ward. You have given up studying on a night
before a midterm. You have lost sleep when
the next day demanded a clear mind. You have
said "no" to parties and the beach and the doz
ens of "fun" activities offered to every Stan-
N ford student.
But the hours you have spent on The Daily
have not been wasted. You have learned —
you have learned the mechanics of a profes

sion. You have learned the details and import
ance of co-operation. You have learned about
Stanford in a way that few others can.
You know these things, though, and I fear
the repetition will make them dull. But I fear
also that you have not discovered one of the
greatest rewards for your work.
It is difficult to describe - and for that reason
it is difficult to comprehend. But it involves a
sense of contribution, an awareness of your
own ideals, and a reaction of satisfaction that
you are helping to inform and, perhaps, to im
prove the community in which you live.
Let me finish with a word on ideals and ideal
ism. Each of you and all of us are idealists—
or were at one time. But we find that there is
an ever-increasing skepticism for idealism to
day. Most of our practical training concerns
the "mechanics of a profession." We are told,
indirectly, to forget our ideals, and to be "prac
tical." We are not taught how to apply our
ideals practically and realistically.
We must learn that ourselves. Or we must
forget our idealism and concentrate all of our
attention on the acquisition of Cadillacs and
Prestige.
I leave with you one request. That each of
you hang onto your ideals and apply them.
You may never be rich. But you, and your
world, will be better because of your efforts.
