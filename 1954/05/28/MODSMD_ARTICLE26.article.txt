# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
The years are gone.
You sit down to write the last column. You are
going to try to sum up what Stanford has meant to
you, and you know it will be tough. In a way, you
are happy. No more finals to cram for. No more dull
lectures. No more library and parking fines. No

more thinking of excuses for a
late term paper.
And then you think that if
your worries for the rest of your
life are as inconsequential as
these, then your life will be soft
indeed. You think of the im
mediate future: Responsibilities of
family life for some. Two or three
years in the Army for others. And
for still others, working eight
hours a day in a stuffy office and

getting as much vacation all year as we get for
Christmas now. It's only when we consider some of
the grimmer aspects of non-academic life that we
appreciate the freedom and lack of responsibility
that have been characteristic of these best years of
our lives.
You think about some of the events that you'll
best remember. Stanford's climactic 27 to 20 victory
over Southern California in 1951 for the Rose Bowl
honors, with Bob Mathias racing 96 yards in the
last quarter. There never was or never will be another
one like that. And only second to it, the Indians
spearheaded by Bobby Garrett, whipping UCLA this
year. Bryan Green's whirlwind visit, and the un
precedented discussion he provoked. Spring Sing,
1953, when the heavens began to cry in the middle
of Delt and Guthrie's rendition of "Singing in the
Rain."
You think more about Stanford, and you suddenly
realize that it has been the people who have been
Stanford, not buildings and grounds and lecture
rooms. It's the people.
You think also about some of the every-day scenes
and happenings which you will remember:

Red feathers, pom poms, white saddle shoes,
rooters' caps, and megaphones. The look on the
face of a pom pom girl when a green card shows
up in a sea of red and white. The heart-in-the
throat feeling just before the kick-off in the Big
Game. That moment of pride when the gridders
gallop onto the turf.
A student dozing in class, looking as relaxed as
a poached egg on toast. An elderly gardener, leaning
on his shovel in Union Court, watching a couple go
by, and probably nostalgically wishing that he were
young again. (
A Mem Church service on a pleasant autumn morn
ing. Cars speeding four abreast down that wash
board known as Palm Drive at 1:27 a.m. after a Sat
urday date. Two Democratic poly sci majors, lying
on the lawn in front of the Libe, arguing politics
with a duet of Republican biz schoolers.
Winter quarter . . . galoshes, boots, plastic rain
coats, drenched students scurrying for cover, wet
socks, and umbrellas. The treks to the slopes . . .
nylon parkas, snow bunnies, chair lifts, peeling
noses, and autographed casts.
Stanford in spring . . . girls with Balboa tans in
pastel spring dresses and boys in blue denims and
Hawaiian shirts coming out of class and looking
like a flower garden breaking rank. The friendly
meeting of students at a prof's home. The games of
catch on the Row. L'Ommies, Rossotti's, and Rudy's.
The sundecks . . . bodies, burning skins, and the
smell of suntan lotion. The jalopies sputtering down
the Row. The friendly greetings on Quad. Spring
Sings, Spring Shows, Gaieties. The classes, inter
esting and dull. The drives to the beach. The dances,
the books, the study times, the play times, the bad
times, the good times.
You set to the end of the column, and you realize
that you still haven't really summed up Stanford.
You can't fully put just what Stanford has meant
to you in words.
And then you punch the period key and stop
writing.

family life for some. Two or three
years in the Army for others. And
for still others, working eight
hours a day in a stuffy office and

getting as much vacation all year as we get for
Christmas now. It's only when we consider some of
the grimmer aspects of non-academic life that we
appreciate the freedom and lack of responsibility
that have been characteristic of these best years of
our lives.
You think about some of the events that you'll
best remember. Stanford's climactic 27 to 20 victory
over Southern California in 1951 for the Rose Bowl
honors, with Bob Mathias racing 96 yards in the
last quarter. There never was or never will be another
one like that. And only second to it, the Indians
spearheaded by Bobby Garrett, whipping UCLA this
year. Bryan Green's whirlwind visit, and the un
precedented discussion he provoked. Spring Sing,
1953, when the heavens began to cry in the middle
of Delt and Guthrie's rendition of "Singing in the
Rain."
You think more about Stanford, and you suddenly
realize that it has been the people who have been
Stanford, not buildings and grounds and lecture
rooms. It's the people.
You think also about some of the every-day scenes
and happenings which you will remember:

Red feathers, pom poms, white saddle shoes,
rooters' caps, and megaphones. The look on the
face of a pom pom girl when a green card shows
up in a sea of red and white. The heart-in-the
throat feeling just before the kick-off in the Big
Game. That moment of pride when the gridders
gallop onto the turf.
A student dozing in class, looking as relaxed as
a poached egg on toast. An elderly gardener, leaning
on his shovel in Union Court, watching a couple go
by, and probably nostalgically wishing that he were
young again. (
A Mem Church service on a pleasant autumn morn
ing. Cars speeding four abreast down that wash
board known as Palm Drive at 1:27 a.m. after a Sat
urday date. Two Democratic poly sci majors, lying
on the lawn in front of the Libe, arguing politics
with a duet of Republican biz schoolers.
Winter quarter . . . galoshes, boots, plastic rain
coats, drenched students scurrying for cover, wet
socks, and umbrellas. The treks to the slopes . . .
nylon parkas, snow bunnies, chair lifts, peeling
noses, and autographed casts.
Stanford in spring . . . girls with Balboa tans in
pastel spring dresses and boys in blue denims and
Hawaiian shirts coming out of class and looking
like a flower garden breaking rank. The friendly
meeting of students at a prof's home. The games of
catch on the Row. L'Ommies, Rossotti's, and Rudy's.
The sundecks . . . bodies, burning skins, and the
smell of suntan lotion. The jalopies sputtering down
the Row. The friendly greetings on Quad. Spring
Sings, Spring Shows, Gaieties. The classes, inter
esting and dull. The drives to the beach. The dances,
the books, the study times, the play times, the bad
times, the good times.
You set to the end of the column, and you realize
that you still haven't really summed up Stanford.
You can't fully put just what Stanford has meant
to you in words.
And then you punch the period key and stop
writing.

The years are gone.
You sit down to write the last column. You are
going to try to sum up what Stanford has meant to
you, and you know it will be tough. In a way, you
are happy. No more finals to cram for. No more dull
lectures. No more library and parking fines. No

more thinking of excuses for a
late term paper.
And then you think that if
your worries for the rest of your
life are as inconsequential as
these, then your life will be soft
indeed. You think of the im
mediate future: Responsibilities of
family life for some. Two or three
years in the Army for others. And
for still others, working eight
hours a day in a stuffy office and

getting as much vacation all year as we get for
Christmas now. It's only when we consider some of
