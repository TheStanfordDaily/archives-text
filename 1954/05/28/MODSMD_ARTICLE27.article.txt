To the Editor:
This is the story of three Stanfordites who just
experienced an affiliation with the Free University
of West Berlin.
It would take pages to detail the planned and for
tuitous experiences which befell us during our eight
days in Berlin. We watched both East and West May
Day demonstrations', we visited factories, a refugee
camp, the West Berlin parliament, a Stalin-allee
apartment and the Soviet "House of Culture," and
department stores in the East and the West. Placed
in German homes for the week, we were afforded
close contact with West Berlin life.
After an exciting and exhausting eight days, we
boarded the military train leaving behind a group
of waving friends who had afforded us a week which
could not help qualifying as a highlight of anyone's
stay in Europe.
As we settled back in our train chairs and tried to
commence evaluating the week's experiences, we
were as one in desiring to write you in order to

• i
(1) give yo'.i some idea of the personal welcome
awaiting Stanfordites who visit the outpost city, and
(2) to express how much we personally feel that a
permanent exchange .student relationship with West
BerlMi would help to make concrete the affiliation of
the two universities.
The Free University needs not just dollar aid, but
the kind of personal contacts and support that will
help it sparkplug a new, democratic Germany.
The general welcome for Stanfordites constitutes
solid evidence of how Berlin students feel about
affiliation with Stanford. This manifest enthusiasm
will be evident when you meet next year's exchange
student, Eckart Rottka. ■
Experiences such as we have just enjoyed in Berlin
are indicative of the benefits to be derived from the
affiliation as it exists today. We hope there may be
some way of making this relationship permanent.
