# ...And Another Year Is Gone
## 
### PAT KING 
The largest frosh class in the
history of Stanford was bulging
out of Roble and Encina last j
September when the high and
mighty — the class of '54 — re
turned to the Farm.
Something new had been added
to the still - too - bulky reg books.
Technology and higher education
had collided, and Johnny Jones was
reduced from an illegible scrawl on
a registration card to a series of
punched holes and serial numbers.
The IBM card was here to stay.
Other procedures followed a fa
miliar pattern. Checks for $220 ad
dressed to Stanford University de
flated summer bank accounts. Stu
dents who "just couldn't stand" to
wait in the line dangling from the
Bookstore queued up lor hours to
purchase Big Game tickets. And the
football team had already lost its
first game.
Big Game rivalry began just as
early as first eight o'clock
classes. Rally Com barely had time
to announce that new metallic cards
would glitter in the Indian rooting
section before Cal admitted the sa
cred Stanford Axe was missing.
A special Axe-finding committee
was promptly named. The Berkeley
sleuths investigated, probed, and
searched. And uncovered a fake axe
which they brandished about the
Cal campus as the original Stanford
trophy. The real blade was finally
discovered the morning of the Big
Game in the car of footballer Norm
Manoogian.
The library embarked on a new
policy and opened the stacks to all
undergraduate students. But serious
studying was somewhat retarded by
traditional festivities such as Back
to the Farm Week. The annual
Olympic Day race drew crowds to
Rudy's—plu -. the announcement that
the speed limit on Alpine Road
would be reduced from 55 to 35
miles per hour.
Partisan politics finally got
through the Sianfc.-d ivy cur-twin
when the Political Union held its

first meeting in October. Over 150
students filed into fCubberley Au
ditorium to hear Dr. Graham H.
Stuart discuss "A Student's Inter -
I est in Political Affairs." Wayne
Fuller and Tom Maxwell were
elected to lead the new organi
zation through the year.
Progress was made in other fields,
too. Excom announced it would
! study the Honor Code with specific
| reference to taking examinations
from the testing room.
And in answer to a chorus of com
plaints from late sleepers or early
I studiers, the Sunday carillon con
cert was shortened and moved back
to play immediately after church
was finished.
October also saw the Big Red Ma
chine upset UCLA, 21 to 20, with the
aid of three touchdown passes by
All-America Bobby Gart-ett. While
the Stanford Players were practic
ing for "The Male Animal," Excom
; voted to rejoin the National Stu
dents Association on a one-year trial
basis.
Seniors held the first of many "last
i get-togethers" with a Raunch Re
! union at Rudy's. Luthrop just fin
ished leading the campus in con
tributing to the fall drive for the
World University Service when the
bad news came. Tuition for fall
I quarter 1954 would reach the astro
i nomical heights of $250.
November. "Sad Sam" Tsagalakis.
Remember him? The score was 20
to 20 with 20 seconds to go and
Stanford had the ball on the USC
20-yard line. Then an intercepted
pass. A 38-yard field goal booted by
"Sad Sam." And a final score of 23-
j 20.
"Ah, wait till the Big Game" was
our reply to the taunts of rivals. We
waited. And we'll wait still another
! year for the Axe.
Winter rains were beginning to
put puddles in the bed of Lake Lag
when the frontless, backless, and al
legedly useless ride shelter was in
stalled at the beginning of Palm
j Drive.
Some students proposed an inves
tigation to discover why the shelter
cost several hundred dollars. Mean

while in San Francisco, Harold
Velde was conducting some investi
gations of his own, which again fo
cused campus attention on the
Communist issue.
Fraternities rushed into the new
j'ear by pledging 337 members.
Excom threw out a suggested
plan by David Can on the Honor
Code which would have left the
question of tests in or out of the
classroom up to the individual de
partments. A few weeks later Ex
com rejected the Ivey plan for the
Honor Code, which called for a j
class discussion and vote to settle !
the issue.
Distinguished vis tors Hocked
beneath the sandstone arches on
Quad. Celal Bayar, president of
Turkey, was an honored guest at
the Hoover Library.
Frank Lloyd Wright spoke at a
Tuesday Evening Series and later
described Stanford architecture as
a "soul sore, which strikes deeper
than an eyesore."
But the biggest news of all was
the week-long visit of Canon Bryan
Green, the English clergyman who
packed Memorial Auditorium daily
for his lectures on Christianity.
Another well - known individual
made an appearance in San Mateo
about the same time. Dozens of stu
dents drove up to Bay Meadows to
see America's number one contro
versy in person—Joseph R. McCar
thy.
Winter quarter ended with the j
Card cagers out-shooting Cal, 80-70,
in their final game of the season,
Coach Bob Burnett announced he
would retire to enter private busi
ness.
Spring quarter 1954. News of gi
gantic Pacific H-bomb blasts hardly
caused a ripple in brim-full Lake
Lag. Per usual, the official senior
opening of the Lake was marred by
rain.
And not too unusual, ASSU elec
tions met with some difficulty be
lore stricter rules and simplified
procedures straightened out the
balloting.
This was a quarter of poll-taking
and discussion. Students were
evenly divided on the question of

the 18-year-old vote. A survey ta
ken on the Honor Code highlighted
another campus split on taking tests
from examination rooms.
The proposed VA psychiatric hos
pital on Stanford land was met with
protest from nearby residents and
qualified approval from the meditfal
school.
The final E xcom meeting was
devoted to a proposed overhaul
ing of ASSU student government.
Just as with the Honor Code and
VA hospital, tlie final decision will
come later.
Names continued to make news.
California Governor Knight and his
Democratic opponent Richard
Graves each addressed the Political
Union.
Bruno Walter survived two re
hearsals in drafty Woodpecker
Lodge to prepare the Stanford cho
rus for its appearance with the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra.
And a pair of simians—Cheeta and
Pogo—were elected queen and king
in *the annual Con Home Drive.
May was a musical month. Sylvia
Haining and Bill Burke had the
campus whistling hits from the
Spring Show "Anything Goes." The
Alpha Delts changed the tune to
"Doggie in the Window" at the
Spring Sing. And finally the melody
from"The Moon Is Blue" was on
everyone's lips—at least everyone
who managed to squeeze into Mem
Aud for the Sunday flick of the same
name.
A ferryboat ride, "McCarthy lor
Fuehrer" buttons, prom tickets,
graduation announcements. Spring
quarter was gone.
And for the Class of '54, there was
no "waiting till next year."
