# AT CASTLEWOOD
## Two Bands To Play For Senior Ball 
### 
The annual Senior Ball will
be held at the Castlewood Coun
try Club from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. on
June 10. Music will be furnished
by the bands of Charlie Barnet
and Jack Fina.
Castlewood Country Club is lo
cated near Livermore and Pleasan
ton, about 40 minutes' drive from
Stanford, and was formerly the
Hearst Ranch.
It has been converted into an en
tertainment spot with two swimming
pools, a nine-hole golf course, ball
room, and an outside patio for danc
ing. These facilities will be avail
able the day of the ball and the fol
lowing day to students who plan to
stay overnight. â€¢
In an effort to make the last so
cial activity of the class of '54 an
outstanding one, the committee de
cided to present two "name" bands
rather than one. Charlie Barnet's
organization is making its first West
Coast appearance this spring. Jack
Fina, formerly featured with Freddy
Martin, has appeared in Berkeley
and San Francisco hotels.
The ball is an all-campus func
tion. Tickets are on sale now in the
ASSU office and in living groups.
The $10 price includes a bre'akfast
which will be served at 2 a.m., and
programs to be given out at the
dance. There will be an additional
charge for overnight accommoda
tions and drinks.
Members of the Senior Ball com
mittee are Pat Stusser, chairman;
Kay Johnson and Jeanese Crist,
publicity; Tam Flower, bids and
decorations; Dick Castle, arrange
ments; and Peter Cosovich, patrons.
