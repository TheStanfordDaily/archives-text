FAREWELL!—The good old days down on The Farm soon will take their place as fond memories
in the minds of some 2,000 members of the Class of '54. Commencement ceremonies have been
scheduled for Sunday, June 13, at Frost Amphitheater. Here two seniors pay their last respects
.to Stanford during a stroll down Inner Quad. More news on Commencement and Senior Week
will be found on pages 3, 4, and 5. —Daily photo by Ken Green
