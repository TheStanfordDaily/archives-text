VARSITY
Swimming Coach Tom Haynie was
very optimistic about the varsity
mermen at the beginning of the
season—and he had right to be. How
ould he be worried with stars like
Jim Gaughran, Larry Heim, Dm
Osborne, and Winston Black work
up for him?
Ilis optimisms did not prove false
ither, for the Indian tankmen swept
to their fifth straight Pacific Coast
Conference championship, increased
their dual meet string of victories
to 35, broke all kinds of records',
and placed fifth in the National
3wim Meet.
At the end of this year, Osborne
holds three conference marks—the
1500-meter, 220-yard and 440-yard
freestyle—while C'aughran holds the
PCC record in the 100-yard freestyle,
and Heim has the record in the 220-
yard backstroke and the 150-yard
individual medley.
An Indian 400-yard relay team j
••onposed of Phil Gay, Bob Morris, j
Doug Ackerman, and Lee Gunner
son smashed the standard in that
event, while the 300-yard medley ,
relay trio of Black, Heim, and Gau
hran also raced to a new best time.
FROSH
Paced by a bevy of former high j
school stars, the freshman swimmers
swept to an undefeated season that i
included wins over Junior Colleges i
and two easy triumphs over the I
California yearlings.
Backatfoker Ron Grunt finished |
the season without a loss, while free
styler distance man Tom Burton and
sprinter Denny Stimson turned in
outstanding records.
