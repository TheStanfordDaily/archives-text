j Coach tßob < Renker's tennis squad
! ends up its season solidly embedded
! in fourth place in the PCC (southern
division); however, the year was
j much better than the record book
indicates.
Several conference losses were by
only very narrow margins and the
team and team members made fin.
showings in non-conference matches,
outside matches, and tourneys.
Next year, despite the losses of
| Jim Cornish, Art Fish, and Gary
I Gray, the team should be stronger
than ever. Jack Frost, who will be
ranked quite high nationally after
! his outstanding season, v/ill be
j backed up bjP Ernie Dußray. Du-
Bray, a star of two seasons ago, is
out of the service with two years of
j eligibility remaining.
