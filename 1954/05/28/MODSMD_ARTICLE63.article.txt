Stanford's gymnastic squad came
out second best in the AAU meet
behind the Olympic Club and also
looked good in the PCC meet.
Jerry NesSelrod was voted the all
around champ of the PCC while his
teammates, Bob Pierce on the rope
climb, Russ Royden on the high bar,
and Jerry Gilmore on the trampo
line, placed in the meet.
