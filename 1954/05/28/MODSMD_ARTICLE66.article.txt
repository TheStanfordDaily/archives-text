On the whole, however, Mazour has been pretty co-operative.
Our appreciation goes out to Don Liehendorfer, Athletic News Service

Thank to Walt Gamaee, amicable Sports Editor of the Palo Alto Times
who lias upplied us with pictures and news; to Dink Templeton lor a line

Thanks to Boh Haydock who did "outstanding" sketches end whose
drav/.ng ol Stanford seniors appt.a o" nave 6 today and to Eileen

Orchids to -dine quality photographic work by Messrs. Frank Huntress,
Ken antes Ken G*een, and John l.uetvclier, and for the full cooperation
ol 1 ! oto- ruphy Editor Jack Tracy.
An.l ol course, you have to appreciate the fine efforts of the athletes
lln in Ives who gave the sports staff' some contexts to cover. Many
of 11 " n have played their last games for Stanford.
Itch Garrett. Sam MorJev. and John Steinberg take a great aerial show
with them ; nd who would forget the Morley-Steinberg double-decker
roirtmc f 1 ootballers Phil Wilson, Norm Manoogian, Ted Tanner, Bill Schei
dcckcr. Bill Wentworth, Dirk Monteith, Dick Gant, Marv Kou
Cook. |.en Hosier, and Marsh llewe all leave.
I v. o to i notch wrestlers, George Russell, who was undefeated during
his c< lie - .ate career, and Ken James, also pull up stakes.
Soccer greats John Sentous, John Ilanna. Mills Verdiinr, and Derek
Licet,y have played their last games for the Cardinal and White.
B.v ketl fillers Don DcLong, Olie Suzdalclf, Dave Epperson, and the color
lul Jim Johnsen mbve along with their coach Boh Burnett.
Tony Wyhn, who was injured throughout most of the boxing season, has
had tiis last college fight. The practically uncomparable Leo Long leads
I' ret' George. Gerry Wood, and Larry Broeren to a new trail.
H< I) Sims and Grant Spaeth will be among the Stanford golfers who
defend their NCAA crown in June, and they will attempt to wind up their
careers in a blaz? of triumph.
Sw mmers Jim Gaiighran, Lee Gunnei son, Bill Mrlvor, and water polo
players Jhu Lee, John Schmidt, Fritz Kunzel, Wall.v Parks, and Gaughran
leave on a winning note having captured all the Pacific Coast honors in
both sports.
C( .;,!.e Toepfer, Bill Findlay, Stan Lewis, and Pete Paup will row their
last crew race tomorrow at Newport. Baseballers Warren Goodrich,
Phil Pare, Mike Acker, Al Talboy, Clarke Nelson, Gordon Gallo
way, and Ralph Cassady retire alter several successful seasons under
Everett Dean. Sport by sport, many valuable men will play no more.
1 o tiy and single out all would be impossible because some are always
in.id vet tnntly left out and so this should suffice as a nod to everyone con
cerned lor his or her part in Stanford athletics
But, ol course, I can't forgot my happy-go-lucky, tie-up but come
through staff. You're inheriting a fine, but unpredictable gang, Don. There's
your assistant sports editor and jack-of-all-trades Bill Wright, who to
my knowledge has never turned out a poor storv; there's soccer star Dick
Koenigsherger; the aloof Vic Casebolt, Bill Nichols. Kent's own Boh Durand,
Kay Waddington; Stanford's answer to girl sports writers, Lee Hansen; plus
Dale Dunn. Dick Maristal. an<| Bill Jones.
Hut you're also losing a few talented scribes. Elmore Seeds will be in
Med School and Ray Loynd winds his way into the outside world with
diploma in hand.
•And so, Don, when you finish sharpening your Eberhard Faber pencil
and try and unscramble unseramhable files, you can take over here and
. crawl out those assignments for the fall.
As for this reporter, I'm going over to the news side for a spell, but will
be coming at you with a sports item here and there.
And so, as the sun sinks in the west and we hear beautiful tropical
music in the background, we wave goodbye to our friendly little island.
