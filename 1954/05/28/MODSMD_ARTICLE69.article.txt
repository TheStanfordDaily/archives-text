# 'Rags to Riches' Story Of Indians' Top Passer
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
There ir a cerlain quality in the American sporting fan, a cer
tain almost nherent feeling that leads him to believe that the most
exciting story in the world of sports is that of the athlete who rises
from the obscurity of non-recognition to the pedestal of sporting
renown.
Such was the 1953 story of Indian quarterback Bob Garrett, the

Stanford Daily's "Athlete of the
Year." From just another Card foot
baller to the title of the nation's
leading passer and the bonus choice
of the titans of professional football,
the Cleveland Browns, this was the
1953 success saga of San Marino's
Bobby.
It started with the miserable Sep
tember opening day 25-20 loss at
the hands of COP. when Bobby
"only" threw one TD pass, and it
culminated in Sjpin Francisco's Kezar
Stadium on Jan. 2, 1954, when quar
terback Garrett led the Chuck Tay
lor-coached We t squad to a 31-7
trouncing of the favored East in the
Annual Shrine All-Star game. Gar
rett was overwhelmingly chosen the
game's most valuable player.
And (hen there were the nine
Saturdays in between, as the shy, !
blond slingshot hurled his way I
to the national parsing title, com- !
plction wise, as well as touch
down wise, he hooted his way to
the mo t points after touchdowns, |
kicked, and anuznv.ly enough, he '
also led the nation in intercep
tions, stealing nine enemy passes.
For Garrei», as well as for most
Stanford rooters, the UCLA come
back victory highlighted the 1953 (
season. With the Indians trailing
20-7 in the third quarter, Garrett
connected with ends Morley and |
Napoleon for two quick touchdowns
and then kicked the extra point
which gave Stanford the PCC up
set of the season, 21-20.
And so was climaxed the season
which the incredibly shy Garrett
began with a desire to make up for
the lack of success the year before.
He gives all the credit to j

caach," Chuck Taylor, and to his two
"tremendous ends," John Steinberg
nd Sam Morley, and "to the fine
|. roieetion the .est of the team gave
me."
And now, what lies ahead of Stan
ford's 1953 "rags to riches" kid?
First of all there's marriage, to San
Marino's Joan Connolly, shortly al
ter graduation. Then there is the
August All-Star game in Chicago
•gainst professional football's cham
pion . the Detroit Lions.
And next, fall, Garrett will try to
■ lit the finishing touches on his suc
cess story, as he attempts In displace
the aging Otto Graham, incompar
able quarterback of the Cleveland
Browns.

"Alhlele of the Year"
There ir a cerlain quality in the American sporting fan, a cer
tain almost nherent feeling that leads him to believe that the most
exciting story in the world of sports is that of the athlete who rises
from the obscurity of non-recognition to the pedestal of sporting
renown.
Such was the 1953 story of Indian quarterback Bob Garrett, the

Stanford Daily's "Athlete of the
Year." From just another Card foot
baller to the title of the nation's
leading passer and the bonus choice
of the titans of professional football,
the Cleveland Browns, this was the
1953 success saga of San Marino's
Bobby.
It started with the miserable Sep
tember opening day 25-20 loss at
the hands of COP. when Bobby
"only" threw one TD pass, and it
culminated in Sjpin Francisco's Kezar
Stadium on Jan. 2, 1954, when quar
terback Garrett led the Chuck Tay
lor-coached We t squad to a 31-7
trouncing of the favored East in the
Annual Shrine All-Star game. Gar
rett was overwhelmingly chosen the
game's most valuable player.
And (hen there were the nine
Saturdays in between, as the shy, !
blond slingshot hurled his way I
to the national parsing title, com- !
plction wise, as well as touch
down wise, he hooted his way to
the mo t points after touchdowns, |
kicked, and anuznv.ly enough, he '
also led the nation in intercep
tions, stealing nine enemy passes.
For Garrei», as well as for most
Stanford rooters, the UCLA come
back victory highlighted the 1953 (
season. With the Indians trailing
20-7 in the third quarter, Garrett
connected with ends Morley and |
Napoleon for two quick touchdowns
and then kicked the extra point
which gave Stanford the PCC up
set of the season, 21-20.
And so was climaxed the season
which the incredibly shy Garrett
began with a desire to make up for
the lack of success the year before.
He gives all the credit to j

caach," Chuck Taylor, and to his two
"tremendous ends," John Steinberg
nd Sam Morley, and "to the fine
|. roieetion the .est of the team gave
me."
And now, what lies ahead of Stan
ford's 1953 "rags to riches" kid?
First of all there's marriage, to San
Marino's Joan Connolly, shortly al
ter graduation. Then there is the
August All-Star game in Chicago
•gainst professional football's cham
pion . the Detroit Lions.
And next, fall, Garrett will try to
■ lit the finishing touches on his suc
cess story, as he attempts In displace
the aging Otto Graham, incompar
able quarterback of the Cleveland
Browns.
