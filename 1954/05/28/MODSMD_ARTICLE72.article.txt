# Card-Bruin Football Came Chosen 'Best of the Year'
## 
### VIC CASEBOLT 
In a choice that could surprise no one, and one that few others
would dispute, The Daily sports staff unanimously picked Stan
ford's 21-20 victory over the UCLA Bruins as the "Greatest Sporfs
Event of the Year. Even the die-hard conservatives who lament
for the "good old days" would have to go back a long way—at

least two years to the 1951 S.C. con-<
test—to pick a better afternoon for
the Big Red than the day that Bob
Garrett came into .his own as the
All-American quarterback he is, and
Sam Motley and John Steinberg
proved that they were two of the
finest offensive ends in the country.
"The greatest I'vv ever seen,"
gasped a fan who has seen quite a
few in his day—Olympic Decatha
lon champion and football star at
Stanford. Beth lYfathias. And as he
and (he rest of (he 5(1,000 fans filed
out of Stanford Stadium, most
were speechless at what they had
witnessed.
Sure, Stanford had swiped a
touchdown from the powerful Bruin
before three minutes were up, after
the Bruin's "pre-season All Ameri
can'' Paul Cameron had fumbled the
opening kickoff. But mighty UCLA
had amassed three touchdowns by
the third quarter, and coach Rod
Sanders and his boys had settled
down to a comfortable two-touch
down lead.
Then Coach Taylor and the l{i;{
Ked machine decided they had
other ideas, (iurrett, who passed
for all three TD's and added (he

►
PAT each (ime, passed (o Morley
fer nine yards iust before the third
! period rest, and Al Napoleon grab
bid another in the last period for
the tying tally. Then came the per
fect kick, four endless minutes,
i and bedlam.
But it wasn't only the passing trio
| who stole the show for Stanford,
j and dropped UCLA out of their
number three national rating. Matt
' Armitage, Phil Wilson, Jerry Gold
berg, Norm Manoogian, Ray Kricke-
I berg, and Barry Smith all turned in
j outstanding line play. Bill Went
| worth, Jarvis Watson, and Bill Tarr
I helped provide Garrett with a pro
, tectivt; ring, giving him ample time
to launch his aerial attack.

In a choice that could surprise no one, and one that few others
would dispute, The Daily sports staff unanimously picked Stan
ford's 21-20 victory over the UCLA Bruins as the "Greatest Sporfs
Event of the Year. Even the die-hard conservatives who lament
for the "good old days" would have to go back a long way—at

least two years to the 1951 S.C. con-<
test—to pick a better afternoon for
the Big Red than the day that Bob
Garrett came into .his own as the
All-American quarterback he is, and
Sam Motley and John Steinberg
proved that they were two of the
finest offensive ends in the country.
"The greatest I'vv ever seen,"
gasped a fan who has seen quite a
few in his day—Olympic Decatha
lon champion and football star at
Stanford. Beth lYfathias. And as he
and (he rest of (he 5(1,000 fans filed
out of Stanford Stadium, most
were speechless at what they had
witnessed.
Sure, Stanford had swiped a
touchdown from the powerful Bruin
before three minutes were up, after
the Bruin's "pre-season All Ameri
can'' Paul Cameron had fumbled the
opening kickoff. But mighty UCLA
had amassed three touchdowns by
the third quarter, and coach Rod
Sanders and his boys had settled
down to a comfortable two-touch
down lead.
Then Coach Taylor and the l{i;{
Ked machine decided they had
other ideas, (iurrett, who passed
for all three TD's and added (he

PAT each (ime, passed (o Morley
fer nine yards iust before the third

bid another in the last period for
the tying tally. Then came the per
fect kick, four endless minutes,
i and bedlam.
But it wasn't only the passing trio

j and dropped UCLA out of their
number three national rating. Matt
