St.II seeking a quarterback to re
place Bob Garrett. Taylor will prob
ably let Don Kafka, Jerry Gustaf
son, and Jack Gebert do most of the
play calling from the new split 1'
formation which the Cards will use
at least on a limited ba is next fall.
This will be the final public ap
pearance ol the looLballers in tin
Stadium unlil the Oct. 2 game with
Illinois.

Garrett, Morley, Steinberg, Cook,
Manoogian, Wilson, and all the rest
are gone. And Cal lias Hazeltine,
Larson, and Knox among the head
liners. SC is loaded—natch. With
the exception of Cameron, Ellena,
and Doud, UCLA has its Rose Bowl
team almost intact.

classed as the number one dark
horse in the PCC.
Chuck Taylor, the man who fits
his attack to his material, has the
makings of another dangerous ae
rial - minded offense. Jack Gebert
doesn't look like another Garrett,
but he is an adept passer. And soph
omore Don Kafka has been a sharp
quarterback in the spring drills.
Taylor has been teaching his quar
terbacks a new variation of the
Tribe's basic Shaughnessy-type 'In
formation. It is the "keep" play
which is so common in the offense of
>pi it—T attacks, like that of Notre
Dame, 'the quarterback carries the
ball parallel to the line; then he lias
the choice of running himself or 1 at
eraling to a back.
John Stewart, the soph high
jumper, Jack Kannells, Ted Polich,
and lion Bush should he rugged,
glue-fingered ends.
From tackle to tackle, Taylor con
siders Stanford stronger than it has
been in many years. Win Wedge,
Chris Marshall, Joel Sappenfield,
Koy Krickeberg, Matt Armitage,
Donn Carswell, Don Manoukian, Joe
Long, and Jerry Goldberg will be
battling for first-string line berths.
Taylor and staff have a bevy of
halfbacks to choose from, but most
of them are relatively small scat
backs. Ernie Dorn and Bill Tarr
appear to be in line for the starting
nod, but John Neff, Gordy Young,
Dorsey Atkinson, ahd others will be
pressing for some action.
Jarvis Watson has the first call
on the fullback slot, but Paul Cam
era, Tom Jacobs, and Mike Ander
son are also in the running.
