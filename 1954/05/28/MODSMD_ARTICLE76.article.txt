## 
### BOB DURAND 
When Stanford's water polo team concluded their season, hold
ng the Pacific Coast Conference championship ana the repu.aiion
of the best squad in the history of the sport on the Faim, Coach
iom Haynie wasn't satisfied.
The balding, genial mentor went right to work on his varsity

swimming team which was to de-"<
end its PCC crown come spring.
.«'ot only did the mermen success
fully defend their title, but they
'.jroke practically every record in
Joing it.
Along with this, a third Haynie
coached squad, the freshman swim- |
mers, likewise swept to an unde- '
.eated schedule.
On the basis of this overwhelm
ing evidence, Tom llaynie was
voted '1 he Daily's "Coach of the
Year."
Tom came to Stanford in 1946 as
an assistant to Ernst Brandsten, who
previously had been the only coach
in the history of Indian swimming, j
He took over as head mentor in |
1943, and ever since then, the Caid :
mermen have been regarded as the j
power of the Pacific Coast.
With the close of competition this
season, Haynie's teams have to their
credit 35 straight dual meet wins,
11 straight conference meet tri— j
umphs, 20 straight Big Swim vie- j
tories, and five consecutive Pacific I
Coast Conference championships.
This year's Ilaynienien hold rec- !
tnds in the 10ft-, 220-, and 440-
yard freestyle events, the 1,500- j
meter distance swim, the 150-yard
individual medley, the 200 ami
100-yard backstroke, and the 400-
yard freestyle and :»00-yard med
ley relays.
In water polo, Tom coached this j

fall's squad to the PCC till:' over
California, who lias been perennially
the strongest team in the league.
The tankmen finished with a confer
ence mark of five wins and one loss,
the only setback coming at the hands
of the Bears by one goal.
His team set one PCC record in a
tilt with USC by racking up 17
goals during the game.
His frosh mermen also rang up an
unbeaten mark with seven wins in
seven outings. With no immediate
end of good material coming along,
and the ever-increasing experience
of his own coaching, Tom Haynie
should continue to produce top
flight teams and keep up the repu
tations of Stanford's winningest
teams.
