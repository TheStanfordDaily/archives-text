TEGUCIGALPA. Honduras, June
21 (UP) — Guatemala launched a
general counterattack against invad
ing anti - Communist rebels today,
claiming victory in the first land
battle near the town of Gualan and
capture of an arms-laden schooner
oft' Puerto Barrios.
A Guatemalan government com
munique said federal troops forced
the insurgents to retreat in the Gua
lan area "after overcoming stubborn
resistance." A later communique
said the schooner Siesta of Hondu
ran registry was captured at Puerto
Barrios "after some bloodshed."
A dispatch from Guatemala City
said rebel forces were reported re
treating in the Gualan area, some
75 miles from the capital. A govern
ment communique said the rebels
were driven back by Guatemalan
rs 'well trained snd equipped

with modern armament."
The government communique said
federal troops had refrained from at
tacking the invaders before today
because the government wished to
avoid any possible frontier incidents
which might lead to an ''interna
tional war."
Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas,
leader of the anti-Communist forces
striking from Honduras, set up a
government inside Guatemala and
called for the unconditional surren
der , of President Jacobo Arbenz
Guzman and his Communist - sup
ported regime.
Meanwhile, United States re

anti-Communist rebel forces in the
Central American country are using
