# The 						Daily in the Summer
## 
### 
The Stanford Farm, normally swarming with seven thousand
busy students, is more relaxed in the summer time. Take The
Daily as an example. The Daily isn't a daily this quarter, publish
ing only Tuesday and Friday mornings.
Despite the curtailed schedule, The Daily will try to continue
to be a newspaperâ€”your newspaper. Every registered student
paid his Daily subscription fee when he paid his tuition, and we
will try to see that you receive an informative and interesting
paper in return.
Summer quarter brings to Stanford a student body which in
cludes numerous graduate students, first-quarter freshmen, "vet
eran" matriculated students, and visitors from other schools. We
will attempt to respond to this varied audience with the news
which will interest everyone. We hope to achieve a balance be
tween world developments, campus activities, and news of Stan
ford students, alumni, and faculty.
In addition and in particular. The Daily wants to know your
opinions and your ideas. This is your newspaper. Letters to the
editor, suggestions, comments will be welcomed.
