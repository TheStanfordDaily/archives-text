# Leo Long Paces Trackmen
## 
### 
Leo Long, who holds the Stan-!
ford record in the javelin, 1
proved his national collegiate
supremacy by winning the
NCAA spear-throwing as he led
the Indians' midwestern track
invasion.
Long's toss of 22G-8 3 /4, although
well off his personal best of 235-11 '4, j
was easily enough to win the NCAA
meet at Ann Arbor. Reinaldo Oliver '

of Puerto Rico was far back in sec
ond place at 213-10%.
Then last Saturday in St. Louis
representing the Olympic Club,
Long placed third in the national
AAU meet behind Bud Held, ex-
Stanford ace, and Bill Miller. Long
threw the spear 226-2.
Long had previously won the Pa
cific Coast Conference meet at
Seattle at 228 feet.
Stanford as a team was third in
the PCC meet behind Southern

I California and Cal and eighth in the
NCAA with 15 points.
With John Bugge joining Long.
I the javelin was the Cards' best j
point-making event. Bugge was 1
fourth in the PCC and sixth in the
NCAA at 195-l :t 4, and fourth in the
AAU at 214-10, his personal record. |
Gerry Wood, the Indians' stellar
hurdler, finished fourth in the na
tionals. He was timed in 14.4. He
; was second in the coast meet, trail
ing SC's improving Will Wright.
Wood and Wright were on the vie- j
torious PCC 480-yard shuttle relay
team which tripped a Big Ten quar
tet in the annual meet between the
i two leagues which followed the na- :
â€¢ tionals.
Indian sprinter Keith Browns- i
berger, who was third in the PCC j
100 and fourth in the 220, reached j
the semi - finals of the NCAA fur- j
i long. His 21.6 clocking was enough
to gain the finals.
In the PCC meet Bob Kimball was
fifth in the javelin, A 1 Cheney was !
third behind Cal's John Stellern
and Charlie Butt in the shot put,
j and John Stewart tied for third in
j the high jump.
