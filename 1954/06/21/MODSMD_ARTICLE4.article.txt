Stanford's Board of Trustees was

County Superior Court to "enable
the board to keep pace with the ex
pansion of the University."
The new board members are:
Ernest C. Arbuckle, executive
vice-president, Grace & Co. (Pacific
Coast), San Francisco.
Mrs. Allan E. Charles. San Fran

man's Fund Insurance Company,

Mitchum, Tully & Co.. Los Angeles.

lett-Packard Company, Palo Alto.

Three of the new members were
nominated by the executive board
of the Stanford Alumni Association.
The three are Mrs. Lipman. Mr.
Middleton. and Mr. Petree.
