### 
PARIS, June 24 (UP) â€”Premier
Pierre Mendes-Franee told the Na
tional Assembly today that Commu
nist China had agreed to reach a
cease-five in Indochina as rapidly as
possible.
The Assembly immediately gave
the premier a resounding vote of
confidence, 433 to 23.
Before the vote Mendes - France
reported on his meeting in Bern,
Switzerland, yesterday with Chinese
Communist Premier Chou En-lai.
He made four major points in out
lining results of his discussions with
Chou:
1. "Everyone" agrees that Laos
and Cambodia, the two smallest of
the three Indochina states, shall be
independent.
2. Red China recognizes France's
position in the Far East and is not
expected to demand French depar
ture as a condition of peace.
3. He hopes to meet Soviet For
eign Minister V. M. Molotov next
time the Russian goes to Geneva.
4. He pledged himself against any
world - wide bargaining such as
stacking the fate of the European
Army plan against an Indochina
peace.
The peace reports brought the war
in Indochina to a virtual standstill.
Rebel guerrillas inside the Red
River delta and troops massed out
side it stood idly by, tending to bear
out a report of the outcome of ne
gotiations in Europe.
French officers at Hanoi awaited
any orders from Paris to undertake
the first contacts with the Viet Minli
Communists.
