# Wanted: Opinions and Ideas
## 
### 
Tomorrow night the Executive Committee will tackle a problem
over which it has no jurisdiction, about which it can make no final
decision. That problem is the report of the ASSU Committee on
Student Government and its proposals for a new type of student
body government.
But Excom, if it accomplishes its objectives, will not be wasting
its time, nor the time of anyone who attends the session in the
Stern Hall lounge tomorrow night.
Excom feels, and we wholeheartedly concur, that the findings of
the student government committee are for the most part valid and
that the proposed changes, many of which are embodied within a
new constitutional framework, should be adopted by the Excom
and the student body as soon as possible in the fall.
However, the summer Excom doubts that the solution advanced
by the student government committee and recommended for adop
tion by last year's Excom is perfect. That is the prime motivation
for the open hearing tomorrow night.
Excom will hear a report from the student government commit
tee, outlining its findings and proposals. Then the meeting will be
thrown open for discussion of the report and the suggested by-law
and constitutional changes.
Excom wants the students' ideas on student government. Excom
feels that the students should be sounded out before the issue is
carried much further.
In addition, Excom would like to hear ideas and observations
from students from other universities who have experienced vari
ous forms of student body government.
Most important, any suggestions and student opinions which
may come out of the discussions will not be wasted. All findings
will be reported directly to the Committee on Student Government
which is on campus at the present time writing a detailed draft of
its recommendations to be submitted to the fall Excom for action.
The Daily supports the goals of Excom's present program one
hundred per cent. We feel that a change in the ASSU government
is vital. Above all, we hope that any changes made will be the
right changes.
With that in mind, we urge all students who can contribute to
the formulation of an effective constitution to join the discussion
tomorrow night. We also suggest that the Excom meeting will
provide an excellent opportunity for all students to learn many of
the intricacies of Stanford's representative system.
