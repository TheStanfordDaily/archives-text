The latest developments in the ease history of Ronnie Knox, the well
aveled quarterback from —well, I can't accurately say just where- al
lough adequately detailed and discussed in almost every paper around, j
re irresistible. I just have to comment.
Don't be a bit surprised if Knox, after departing from Cal, never en
jlls at UCLA. The Bruin single wing is not Knox's formation. He has
ad four years of experience (under four coaches) as a T quarterback.
Harvey Knox, his father, was distressed, or so he says, at the possibility
nt Ronnie might have to scurry around without protection in the Stan-
Jid backfield. What about those UCLA power thrusts at tackle by the

iilback?
Rube Samuelson, the ace column
t for the Pasadena Star News,
links Knox might be headed for
ime college at which the transfer
ould not cost a year of eligibility,
ouston as an example. But if the
(ding picks up again for the young
asser's services, Knox may yet
ind up in Los Angeles. Not in
/estwood, but at USC.
At any rate, Knox will not be
aming to Stanford. The Admissions
iflifce makes a practice of turning j
\"iy transfer athletes such as Knox, j
aid Chuck Taylor doesn't need any
lore coaches anyway.

One more note on the Knox case,

There has been talk ever since
pring practice that Taylor would
e switching to the split-T forma
ion in the fall. The Tribe's All
american head coach says that
•tanford will do nothing of the sort.
/he Indians will continue to em
loy their standard T formation with
:ie ends and backs sometimes
pread. But they will not split the
inemen.
The cause of the rumor was a
ew variation which Taylor in
tailed. In the spring drills, the
u.trterback was keeping the ball
nd running parallel to the line of
crimmage for a few yards. The qb
/ould either lateral to a back or
un with the ball himself.
This variation, Taylor says, is a
tandard play from the split-T. but
itanford will run it from the In
. ,ns' regular formation.

/he Indians will continue to em
loy their standard T formation with
:ie ends and backs sometimes
pread. But they will not split the
inemen.
The cause of the rumor was a
ew variation which Taylor in
tailed. In the spring drills, the
u.trterback was keeping the ball
nd running parallel to the line of
crimmage for a few yards. The qb
/ould either lateral to a back or
un with the ball himself.
This variation, Taylor says, is a
tandard play from the split-T. but
itanford will run it from the In
. ,ns' regular formation.
