WASHINGTON, June 28 (UP) —
President Eisenhower and Prime
Minister Winston Churchill said to
day the United States and Britain
will "press forward" with collective
defense plans in Southeast Asia re
gardless of whether France con
cludes an Indochina truce.
Ending four days of momentous
talks on world issues, the two lead
ers also said Western Germany
should be made an "equal partner"
of the West so it can make its
"proper contribution" to the defense
of the free world.
The brief statement issued by the
White House was purposely vague,
but authoritative American sources
made clear Eisenhower and Sir Win
ston had significantly narrowed the
issues dividing them when their
talks began last Friday.
These sources said British and
American officials will continue
talks here with an eye to a possible
later conference of all nations will
ing to join the proposed anti-Com
munist alliance in Southeast Asia.
The U.S. - British agreement to
move toward a collective defense
system in Southeast Asia now was
an apparent triumph for Mr. Ei
senhower. Previously Britain had
agreed only to discuss the possibility
of such a plan.
Churchill called for "patience and
a cool, friendly examination of what
the Russians want."
In London Britain opened an ac
tive campaign to boost trade with
Communist China today by welcom
ing a delegation of Red economists
for a fact-finding tour.
Seven trade experts and an inter
preter flew in from Geneva, where
the talks that led to the visit were
carried out.
