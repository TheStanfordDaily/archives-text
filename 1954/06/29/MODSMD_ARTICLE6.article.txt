# Excom to Discuss Plan For New Constitution
## Open Meeting To Be at Stern 
### 
The ASSU Executive Commit
tee will hold an open hearing to
morrow night at 7:30 in the Stern
Hall lounge to discuss a propo
sal to abolish the present Excom
system.
The recommendation to replace
the present student body govern
ment with a 35-man legislature and |
a 15-man cabinet was approved by J
last year's Excom in its last meeting j
of spring quarter.
Excom will first hear the propo
sals of the ASSU Committee on Stu
dent Government which drew up !
the plans for constitutional reorgan
ization. An open discussion of the j
committee's report will follow.
Excom will report any findings
and suggestions which result from
tomorrow's meeting to the student
government committee. The com- ,
mittee is now composing a detailed I
draft of the proposed constitution \
on which the fall Excom will take
action.
The new constitution would create
a 15-member cabinet of the ASSU
president and vice-president, the five
class presidents, presidents of seven
ASSU administrative boards, and a
counselor.
The cabinet would consider policy !
and draw up motions to be approved
by the legislative council. One con- I
troversial aspect of the new constitu- J
tion would give the cabinet officers !
membership and voting privileges in |
the legislature.
The position of student controller
would be created to share part of
the burden of work now handled by
the student manager. The controller
would handle the budget and fi
nances of the ASSU Students' Or
ganizations Fund.
Summer ASSU President Marsh
Freeman stressed that tomorrow's
Excom meeting is being held at
Stern so that students may join the
discussion. Freeman said, "We would
particularly like to have students
from other universities, students
who have solved problems similar to
the ones which face us, help us
make the ASSU government more
efficient and more truly representa
tive."
The recommendations of the com
mittee were based on the following
S conclusions about the present gov
ernment:
1. Excom does not truly repre
sent the students, due to a "lack of
representative quality."
2. Excom has insufficient consul
tation and co-operation and lacks
cohesiveness.
3. It is difficult for Excom to de-
I lineate between its legislative and
i executive duties.
4. Communications within and be
yond student government could be
improved.
5. The president's executive re
sponsibility is weakened by the
present constitutional system.
