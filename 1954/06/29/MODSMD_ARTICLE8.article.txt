TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras, June 28 (UP)—Anti-Communist war
planes bombed and strafed Guatemala City today a few hour
after Guatemala's new military regime outlawed the Communis
party.
The rebel action appeared to be a demand for unconditional sur-

render of the new military junta *
headed by Colonel Carlos Enrique
Diaz. The rebels had demanded the
ouster and arrest of all Reds in i
the Guatemalan government under |
threat of bombing the capital.
Diaz's regime replied to the threat
by outlawing the Communist party
and declaring a state of emergency,
but did not comply completely with
the rebel demand.
A broadcast over the official Gua
temalan radio said rebel planes
started bombing and strafing Guate
mala City at 3:40 p.m. (2:40 p.m.
PDT) and were trying to destroy the
government radio station.
The action of the new government
in outlawing the Communist party
was interpreted as a bid for peace
with the rebel forces headed by
General Carlos Castillo Armas.
On the military front, the rebel
air force was reported to be stepping
up its attacks, threatening an "all
out'" bombing of Guatemala City.
Government forces still held all
major cities, including the important
Caribbean port of Puerto Barrios,
the Pacific port of San Jose, and the
important railroad town of Zacapa. J
As both sides in the revolt moved
toward the establishment of a cease
fire agreement, there came a strong
hint of early United States recogni
tion of a Guatemalan government
which the U.S. can believe is truly
anti-Communist.
Whiting Willhauer, U.S. ambassa
dor to Honduras, refused to com
ment on Castillo's demand for rec
ognition, but he said pointedly: "We
don't like Communism in Guate
mala."
Meanwhile, United States officials
moved to evacuate hundreds of
American families to El Salva
dor. Twelve American planes were
standing by
