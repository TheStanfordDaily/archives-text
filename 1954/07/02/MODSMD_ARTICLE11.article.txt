# It's the Whole That Counts

Little was accomplished at the Excom meeting Wednesday
night. This seems to be a typical failure of most Excom meetings.
The discussion of the new constitution as outlined and proposed
by the Committee on Student Government broke down into wran
gling about details in the system.
That a single meeting was lost in petty arguments would not be
particularly distressing. But there was a significance to this "lost"
meeting. All indications are that any fall Excom consideration of
the new constitution will degenerate into a similar, but far more
serious, struggle between factions, with each faction fighting stub
bornly and heatedly for minor changes.
It would be strangely ironic, wouldn't it, if continual stress of
the minute in long-winded Excom debate is responsible for the
defeat of the very measure designed to correct that particular Ex
com flaw.
AH this is not to say that the discussion at Wednesday's meeting
was devoted exclusively to relatively insignificant issues. Many
piinciples of the over-all structure and the interrelationship of stu
dent body organizations were profitably examined.
But the predominant tendency to become sidetracked on spe
cifics caused the "lost" meeting. It appears likely that this attitude
wjll be accentuated and exaggerated in the fall. Meaning more
"lost" Excom meetings. And a "lost" constitution as well.
Whenever the constitution prepared by the Committee on Stu
dent Government is critically analyzed, we urge that all parties
realize that it is the whole of the proposal, not each and every
clause, which is of primary concern. Many details which seem so
important at this stage will resolve themselves when the system
gees into operation.
A constitution by its very nature is produced by unifying a con
glomeration of ideas and theories. No person who carefully con
siders the new constitution can ever hope to approve every article
and section. We suggest that Excom remember this in the future.
