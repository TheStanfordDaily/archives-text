# 'THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY'
## Movie Dramatic, Tense, but Character Buildup Weak 
### BILL WRIGHT 
"The High and the Mighty,"
the dramatic account ol an air
; trip from Honolulu lo San Fran
cisco, is a study of human reac
tions in the face of disaster and
probable death.
This is at once the book's great
i ness and the movie's pitfall.
112 The John Wayne-Robert Fellows
production catches the drama and

the tension of the
ocean crossing,
particularly after
the plane's num
ber one engine
conks out, but the
movie can't match
Ernest K. Gann's
best-selling novel i
in character build-

up.
The book provides a lengthy but
none the less well-knit character
study, but the movie just doesn't
have time. The background of each
person, which is so necessary to un
derstand their reactions, was rushed.
And often shown in disconcerting
flashbacks which were foreign to the
continuity of the adventure.
Thus the movie was unable to
portray the passengers' personalities
in completeness and it took too long
trying. But once these preliminaries
are out of the way, "The High and
the Mighty" becomes a tense, finger
nail-biting story.
The instrument approach to San
Francisco, with almost no gasoline
is the high point of the tension and
the realism. It was too bad that you
didn't get a chance to see the re
actions of the passengers when they

realized that the destination of the
plane's descent was a runway in
stead of a wave. They all thought
they were headed for the sea.
Despite the limitations of the
movie compared to the book, the
characterizations of the passengers
were superbly handled by the big
name cast.
John Wayne, in his own produc
tion, was John Wayne, but at the
same time he accurately portrayed
the steady, veteran co-pilot who
masterminded the ilight.
Robert Stack isn't completely con
vincing as the pilot who suddenly
develops a "yellow streak," and one
scene between him and navigator
Wally Brown, in which two trains
of thought come out simultaneously
on the .sound track, is particularly
hard on the nerves.
For the most part, however, Stack
and Brown seem to be real people.
What more can you say?
Among the passengers there are
many standouts. Robert Newton and
Laraine Day are very impressive.
Newton plays an impatient, self-cen
tered theater director who needs the
imminence ot death to awaken him
to the realism of life and death.
Miss Day is a rich socialite to
whom lile life has a meaning differ
ent from that of her husband, John
Howard. Claire Trevor, Jan Ster
ling, Phil Harris, and David Brian,
among the stars, also give fine per

lormances.
Doe Avedon, a newcomer to Hol
lywood movies, is surprisingly good
in the vital role of the stewardess
who has to handle the passengers'
varying degrees of panic.
If you can overlook some of the
poor spots—including a few humor
ous bits that make you laugh when
you think you shouldn't—"The High
and the Mighty" combines humor,
drama, pathos into a rewarding
movie experience.

tions in the face of disaster and
probable death.
This is at once the book's great
i ness and the movie's pitfall.
112 The John Wayne-Robert Fellows
production catches the drama and

the tension of the
ocean crossing,
particularly after
the plane's num
ber one engine
conks out, but the
movie can't match
Ernest K. Gann's
best-selling novel i
in character build-

up.
The book provides a lengthy but
none the less well-knit character
study, but the movie just doesn't
have time. The background of each
person, which is so necessary to un
derstand their reactions, was rushed.
And often shown in disconcerting
flashbacks which were foreign to the
continuity of the adventure.
Thus the movie was unable to
portray the passengers' personalities
in completeness and it took too long
trying. But once these preliminaries
are out of the way, "The High and
the Mighty" becomes a tense, finger
nail-biting story.
The instrument approach to San
Francisco, with almost no gasoline
is the high point of the tension and
the realism. It was too bad that you
didn't get a chance to see the re
actions of the passengers when they

realized that the destination of the
plane's descent was a runway in
stead of a wave. They all thought
they were headed for the sea.
Despite the limitations of the
movie compared to the book, the
characterizations of the passengers
were superbly handled by the big
name cast.
John Wayne, in his own produc
tion, was John Wayne, but at the
same time he accurately portrayed
the steady, veteran co-pilot who
masterminded the ilight.
Robert Stack isn't completely con
vincing as the pilot who suddenly
develops a "yellow streak," and one
scene between him and navigator
Wally Brown, in which two trains
of thought come out simultaneously
on the .sound track, is particularly
hard on the nerves.
For the most part, however, Stack
and Brown seem to be real people.
What more can you say?
Among the passengers there are
many standouts. Robert Newton and
Laraine Day are very impressive.
Newton plays an impatient, self-cen
tered theater director who needs the
imminence ot death to awaken him
to the realism of life and death.
Miss Day is a rich socialite to
whom lile life has a meaning differ
ent from that of her husband, John
Howard. Claire Trevor, Jan Ster
ling, Phil Harris, and David Brian,
among the stars, also give fine per

lormances.
Doe Avedon, a newcomer to Hol
lywood movies, is surprisingly good
in the vital role of the stewardess
who has to handle the passengers'
varying degrees of panic.
If you can overlook some of the
poor spots—including a few humor
ous bits that make you laugh when
you think you shouldn't—"The High
and the Mighty" combines humor,
drama, pathos into a rewarding
movie experience.

"The High and the Mighty,"
the dramatic account ol an air
; trip from Honolulu lo San Fran
cisco, is a study of human reac
tions in the face of disaster and
probable death.
