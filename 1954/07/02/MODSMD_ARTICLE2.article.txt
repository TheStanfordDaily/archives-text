### 
HANOI, July 1 (UP) —The French army evacuated 1,000 square
miles of the Red River Delta, and abandoned 2,000,000 Viet Nam
natives to Communist forces today as they retreated into a cramped
north Indochina pocket near Hanoi and Haiphong.
It was the biggest withdrawal of the war for French troops, and it

gave the Reds four key cities: Nam
Dinh, Ninh Binh, Phat Diem, and
Lac Quan. With them went scores
of smaller towns and the rich rice
fields of the southern delta.
Hundreds of civilian refugees
streamed northward toward Hanoi
and Haiphong in the wake of the
troop convoys. Behind them the
Communist vanguard poured into
the area yielded them with scarcely
a shot fired.
Embittered and fearful Viet Nam
officials circulated reports that the
French had signed a truce deal with
the Reds and the pull-out was one
of its terms.
The French high command con
firmed only today what nearly ev
erybody in Hanoi had known for
days, but could not be reported
through the military censorship —
that 15.000 French Union troops
had pulled out of the lower delta.
The officials said the decision to
abandon the area was "extremely
grave, but absolutely necessary."
The whole southern delta was so
"rotted" with Communist infiltration
it could not have been held against
a major attack, according to the
French. Seven Red divisions were
massed around the delta, awaiting
the signal of failure at Geneva and
in the truce village F Trung Gia.
