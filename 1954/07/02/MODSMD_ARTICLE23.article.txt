# Guatemalan Peace Conference Snags Over Future of Rebels

### 
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador,
July 1 (UP) â€”Negotiations to settle
the Guatemala revolt snagged in a
dispute over the future of the rebel
army today, but informed sources
predicted agreement within 24
hours.
The principal hitch in the nego
tiations between rebel Colonel Car
los Castillo Armas and Colonel El
fego Monzon, head of the latest
Guatemalan military junta regime,
was said to be Castillo's refusal to
disband his insurgents until they
have marched in triumph into Gua
temaal City.
Sources close to teh "peace con
ference" said both sides agree that
those guilty of murdering and tor
turing anti-Communists during the
the administration of ousted pro-
Red President Jacobo Arbenz shall
be speedily prosecuted and pun
ished.
Legal action already has been

started against Communist leaders
and other high officials arrested
since Castillo's troops attacked two
weeks ago.
The rebel leader was reported de
manding that all known Communists
be expelled from Guatemala and
that Arbenz himself and every 1
member of his cabinet be impris- j
oned and brought to trial.
It appeared unlikely that many |
major figures could be brought into
court. Arbenz and a number of his |
chief aides already have sought asy- j
lum in various embassies and lega
tions in Guatemala City, and others j
have fled the country or gone into j
hiding.
Rebel machine guns sprayed the !
last French plane taking off from
Nam Dinh at 10 a.m. today. The rich |
industrial city with a normal popu- |
lation of 100.000 fell under the un
disputed sway of jubilant Red forces. I
