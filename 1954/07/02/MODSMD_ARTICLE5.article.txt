# Proposed Constitution Discussed at Excom
## 
### PAT KING 
Proposed constitutional chan
ges to revamp the present ASSU
student government were aired
at an open hearing for the sec
ond time at the Executive Com
mittee Wednesday night.
The suggested structure of the
I new government was outlined by
' four members of the student gov
ernment committee, who explained
| the plan to the regular Excom last
I spring. The committee is now draw
i ing up a draft constitution and by
j laws to present to Excom in the fall
| for discussion and possible adoption.
Committee member Robert von
Pagenhardt said that the suggestions
of the group, which call for a 35-
member legislature and 15 - man
cabinet to replace the present Ex
com, took into account the following
facts:
1. The high rate of turnover in
I student government, with almost a
| completely fresh group of students
1 in charge every year.
2. The limited amount of time a

student has to give to student gov
ernment.
3. The limited experience which
many students bring with them into
office.
Therefore, von Pagenhardt ex
plained, the goal of the committee is
to strengthen and clarify the formal
lines of communication within the

government and to promote closer
co - operation between all groups
participating in the government.
Tom Bartlett briefly described the
new legislature, which would be
elected roughly on a basis of one
representative for every 1(55 to 200
students. This would eliminate much
of the present inequality of repre
sentation on the present Excom,
where students represent anywhere
from 50 to several hundred constitu
ents.
The legislature would have three
main functions: to debate matters of
policy, to censor reports submitted
by the ASSU executive boards, and
to serve as a funnel for students
complaint or questions.
Bartlett further explained that the

proposed legislature, over twice th
size of the present Excom, shoui
not prove unwieldy if strict parlia
mentary procedure were followed
This would mean all motions woul
have to be submitted in writing i:
advance, discussion could only b<
held on the motions, and routin
discussion of administrative wori
such as social dates would be han
died by the cabinet.
The cabinet would include th
ASSU president and vice-presiden
the five class presidents, president
of the seven ASSU administratis
boards, and a judicial counseloi
wtho would be the chairman of wha
is now the Council for Student Con
trol.
Cabinet members would also b
voting members of the legislature,
system which the committee hope
would broaden the thinking of boar
presidents by acquainting them wit'
the over-all needs of the studen
body.
Heated discussion arose over th
issue of who should preside ove
meetings of the legislature.
As originally established by th
committee, the president would b
free to hand over the gavel to th
student manager. The student mar.
ager would serve as an assistant t
the president on policy-making mat
ters, and his present duties as finar
cial maanger for the ASSU would I:
handled by a student controller.
Steve Horn, former ASSU studer
manager now doing graduate wor
in the Political Science Departmen
urged that a member of the legisla
ture who had stood for electioi
rather than a person who receive
his position by appointment, be cho
sen to act as chairman.
Horn argued that among the o
elected representatives there shoul
be at least one student capable o
handling the chair, and that choos
ing one of these elected member
would be more democratic.
Committee members explaine


808 VON PAOKNHARDT
—He explained the goals
that they felt the president should
have wide latitude in choosing who
w. s to take over the chair, since it
would be essential to find a person
will versed both in campus affairs
an<l in parliamentary procedure to
handle the job.
The best person for the job of
chairman, they argued, might be a
non-elected or ex-officio member
of the legislature, such as the stu
dent manager or a board president.
The controversy over whether the
chairman could be any voting mem
ber o< just an elected member of the
legislature was not finally resolved.
Debate on the commissions out
liner! in the proposal lasted over an
hour. The committee has set up four
spi'i-ia commissions- -drives, foreign
scholarship, pre - registration, and
public relations — as separate and
distinct from the established ASSU
boards such as Cardinals, the lIR,
AWS, and Publications Board.
Ttu so commissions would be in
dcpen tent, responsible only to the
ASSv. president. The committee
members explained that these four
were -singled out as having special,
specifi., somewhat narrow functions,
while 'he administrative boards cov
ered activities of more general cam
pus in'erest.
Hon raised the possibility of
making the foreign scholarship com
mission an ASSU board, which
would allow the foreign scholarship
chairman a place in the cabinet.
Bob Jessen of the lIR further sug
gested that pre-registration activi
ties be placed under the jurisdiction

of Cardinals and that the public re
lations commission be turned into a
special group in the ASSU office to
serve the president.
Again no final decision was
reached. Von Pagenhardt empha
j sized ihat the committee had stud
j ied the functions of these four spe
! cial groups and that their special
ized activities made an independent
status seem to be the best solution.
Students who have ideas and sug
gestions to ofTer on the new consti
i tution may contact any of the com
mittee members in the Political Sci-
I ence Department—Bob von Pagen
hardt, Tom Bartlett. Erland Higgen
j botham, and chairman Harrison
I Schmidt.
In the only other business of the
! evening, Excom approved a closed
| formal for Lagunita residents and
j their dates on July 24 and an all
campus informal dance at Stern on
! Aug. 7.
