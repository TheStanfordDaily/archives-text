### 
HANOI, July 5 (UP)—French forces falling back on Hanoi ahead
of three fast-moving Communist divisions struggled today to seize
a foothold along a new defense line 15 to 20 miles below the city.
The Red vanguard had plunged northward some 15 miles from
Phu Ly since the key outpost was lost Saturday. It was pounding

►at the heels of the French Union
rear guard at Thinh Due Cau, 21
miles south of Hanoi.
The battle for this northern capi
tal, if not for all the fast-shrinking
French pocket in north Indochina,
appeared to be shaping up rapidly.
Violent fighting between French
outposts and strong Communist pa
trols broke out at Bac Ninh, 18 miles
northeast of Hanoi. Rebel troops at
tacked Le Khu just northeast of
Hung Yen, 25 miles southeast of this
northern capital.
The high c o m m a n d announced
troops and artillery in the Ha Dong
area six miles southwest of Hanoi
had been reorganized completely,
obviously as a forward defense post
for the capital itself.
Military sources admitted that the
Reds might try to maintain the mo
mentum of their sweep through the
abandoned southern delta to ram
through, to Hanoi before the French
could reorganize and dig in.
Meanwhile, French and Commu
nist negotiators :agreed today at their
second meeting in the Indochina
truce hut at Tiling Gia to exchange
sick and wounded war prisoners be
ginning July 14.
Details were lacking. French of
ficials would give no hint of the size
or scope of the prisoner exchange
program. Tens of thousands of pris
oners on either side had been taken
in the almost eight years of combat
in Indochina.
Western newsmen were not al
lowed to accompany the French Un
ion delegates from Hanoi to the
truce village. Rut Communist re
ixjrters were said to be on hand.


REDS TAKING OVER—French forces fell back northward to
ward Hanoi yesterday in the face of the Communist divisions
which have moved into the Red River delta territory (in the area
of the numbers) vacated by the French. Most of the fighting is
taking place between Phu Ly and Hanoi, 35 miles to the north.
