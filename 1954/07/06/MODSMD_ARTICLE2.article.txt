OKLAHOMA CITY, July 5 (UP)
—A battle between two oil million
aires for a U.S. Senate nomination
will highlight Oklahoma's primary
election Tuesday—with khaki-clad
troops patrolling the polls in five
counties.
Incumbent Senator Robert S. Kerr
faces former Governor Hoy J. Tur
ner for the Democratic Senate nom
ination. Polls indicate the two oil
men are in a very close race going
to the wire. Both today predicted
victory by "overwhelming" majori
ties.
Governor Johnston Murray called
out 200 unarmed troopers because
his investigations show that absentee
ballots are being sold.
