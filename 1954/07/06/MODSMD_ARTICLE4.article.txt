WASHINGTON, July 5 (UP)â€”
The United States has expelled
three Russian officials from this
country for "espionage and im
proper activities," and the So
viets have retaliated by ousting
two Americans from Moscow,
the State Department said today.
The three Russians were the as
sistant naval attache and the assist
ant air attache at the Soviet embassy
here and the second secretary of the
Russian delegation to the United
Nations.
The State Department refused to
disclose details of their espionage
activities. But department spokes
man Henry Suydam said: "I am sure
that the evidence was conclusive.
We got the goods on them and out
they went."
Two of the Russians were ex
pelled in February and the other
on June (!. The State Department
said nothing about it then in hopes
the Russians would not retaliate.
But the department announced to
day that the Kremlin ousted the
two Americans Saturday.
The U.S. officers were Lt. Col.
Howard L. Felchlin of New York
City, assistant military attache at
the American embassy in Moscow,
and Major Walter McKinney of
Santa Cruz, Calif., assistant air at
tache in Moscow.
The State Department categorical
ly rejected as "baseless" a Russian
charge that the two Americans were
spies. It noted that the formal So
viet note demanding their departure
contained no documentation of the
Red charges.
But it said the two officers will
be withdrawn from Moscow as
signments. Major McKinney and
his wife now arc vacationing in
Switzerland and will not return to
Moscow. Colonel Felchlin and his
family will leave the Soviet capi
tal Thursday.
The Soviets began trying to build
up a case against Felchlin and Mc-
Kinney as far back as March 25. The
Soviet , newspaper Trud said then
that they had left espionage notes in
a compartment they occupied on a
trans-Siberian train. The newspaper
called for their expulsion.
The newspaper said the Ameri
cans illegally photographed airfields
and oil dumps in Russia during Au
gust and September of 1953 while
they were on a trip.
The last previous Russian to be
expelled from this country was Yuri
V. NovikoiT, second secretary of the
Soviet embassy here. He was ousted
Jan. 15, 1953, after he was linked
with Kurt Ponger and Otto Verber,
naturalized Americans convicted of
spying for the Red*.
