### BILL WRIGHT 
The Executive Committee con
sidered social calendar and bud
geting problems and then batted
around ideas and possible rec
ommendations regarding the |
proposed constitutional reorgan-;
ization of the student govern
ment at its weekly meeting
Wednesday night.
No final action was taken about i
the new constituiton, but Excom did
indicate that it would favor formal j
meetings between the Committee on
Student Government, which drew j
up the revisions, and people inter- j
ested in the proposals.
The Excom did agree that the ;
ASSU will sponsor a Stanford Sym- !
phony Orchestra concert next Fri
day night in Memorial Auditorium. 1

A::\ profits will be turned over to
the Women's Residence Summer
Club for its summer quarter schol
arship.
Excom also voted an appropriation
of $50 to the Education Council to
purchase soft drinks and ice cream
for a picnic tentatively scheduled for
July 24.
Summer President Marsh Free
man opened discussion of the pro
pose'! constitution by asking that the
summer Excom make a statement of
its reactions to the plan and the
problems which the fall Excom will
face.
Don King, representing under
graduate men, strongly urged that
some hearing be set up this
quarter to discuss many of the issues
before they are incorporated in the
final draft of the now constitution.
Norm Richardson of the Educa
tfon Council pointed out that his
organization was not contacted by
the Student Government Committee
when it made its initial study. He
suggested that there be a meeting
in the fall of representatives from all
student organizations which would
be affected by a constitution change.
The idea of open hearings in the
fall, with the Student Government
Committee explaining its proposals
and answering questions, was also
advocated by Bob Jessen, under
graduate men's representative.
