# TOO MANY LABELS
## Speegle Favors TV Cameras in Congress 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Paul Speegle—who is a pro
fessor, a radio and TV critic, and
a popular master of ceremonies
— spoke in favor of more tele
vision coverage of public hear
ings as he commented on trends
in American thinking and action.
Speegle, who is teaching at the!
Stanford Radio-Television Institute, j
entertained a small Tuesday Eve
ning Series gathering this week in
Memorial Auditorium with his sto
ries and his tine comic timing.
It didn't matter that the title of his
talk, "Television Is a Sometime
Thing," was never clearly defined.
Speegle said his feeling that Con
gressional sessions and other gov
ernment meetings should he pre- j
.senled to the television audience de- j
veloped during the two months of
Ai my-Mc(vthy hearings.
Of the officials themselves he said: j
"1 kept wishing they would live up
i.o their stature as men and .stop
acting like little boys."
He continued: "I think it would be
wonderful il all public hearings were
open to the eye ol the TV camera.
I am not one who fears thai some
Machiavelli would take over tele
vision to serve his own ends.
"1 don't sell the American people
.short. It may take them a while to
catch on, but over the long run they

show great intelligence."
Speegle discussed the complaint
that television does not live up to
its possibilities. He stated that "a
TV st.ition is only as courageous as
the men who run it,"
But he added: "11 they do not
bring you what you want, it is your
faidt, not their fault." The best line
of action for the public to take i.s to
write letters to the stations, he ad
vised.
Speegle used stories of his expo- i
riences as a radio man and a col- |
umnist to illustrate some emotional
tendencies of the American public.
He considers that "too many peo
ple in this country are starved for
affection" and for a way of express
ing themselves. He said that he be
came an object for the "expression,"
not the "affection," when he made j
some comments about "a certain
gentleman named Liberace" in his
column.
Speegle said: "1 contended that he
(LiberaceJ was not a second Chopin. I
or even a third or a fourth as his ;
followers like to think." Until this I
time, Speegle said, he didn't know j
there were "so many ways of call- i
ing you .so many things."
He was called everything from a
"mealy-mouthed goon" ("this was
from a lady") to a "lame-brained 1
jerk" ("this too was from a lady").
He added that while he was on the
Menlo Park Planning Commission
he had been called a "Communist"
| and a "fascist" on one night and a
! "potential murderer" a few nights
later.
"We are using labels much too
frequently and with too great aban
don." he observed. "If the pressures
I are so great in Menlo Park, think
j what they must be like in Sacra-
I mento or Washington. Is it any won
j del' that people don't want to go
I into public life?"
"The idea is that if a man accepts
a public office he sets out on a trail
of dishonor," he continued.
Other observations Speegle made
| included: "We are losing our sense
I of humor. Everybody has an axe to
grind. Everything has become too
important."
"I have found that the people who
berate the most about free speech
are the first to abuse it."
"Nobody on television wants to
say that an act is 'good.' It has to
; be 'sensational,' 'magnificent,' or
i 'stupendous.' Why can't we get our
values back on a stable plane?"
