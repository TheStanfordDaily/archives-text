Dave Melton, the Stanford grad

the Week for his performances
against Sacramento last week.
Melton banged out 12 hits, in
cluding three doubles and a homer,
for a .414 average as the Seals won
six out of seven games.
Melton was one of the California
League's top sluggers before the
Seals recalled him from the Chan

shortstop at Stanford in 1950, he is
being used in the outfield by the
Seals.
