ATOMIC WEAPON WORKERS STRIKE—President Eisenhower
has named a special three-man board to investigate a strike by
4,500 production workers at the key atomic plants at Oak Ridge,
Tenn., and Paducah, Ky. Board chairman Thomas Glennan told
reporters that the board hopes to settle the strike by Saturday. If
the strike does not end then, the President might obtain a Taft-
Hartley court injunction halting the walkout for 80 days. Above
are shown strikers at the huge gaseous-diffusion plant at Oak
Ridge, who launched the first strike in the history of the nation's
atomic weapons production. —NEA Telephoto
