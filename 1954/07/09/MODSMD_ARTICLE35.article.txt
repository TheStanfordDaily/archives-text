## Clash Expected On Farm Bill 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 8 (UP) â€”
The Senate Agriculture Committee
all but completed work today on a
new general farm bill which is cer
tain to touch oil a bitter Senate bat
tle over rigid versus flexible price
supports.
The big Senate battle is expected
to arise over a previous committee
vote to extend rigid high price sup
ports lor one year and another pro
posal to raise dairy supports from
7. r > to 85 per cent of parity.
Committee Chairman George D.
Aiken (R., Vt.) said today lie may
propose a system of flexible sup
ports ranging from 80 to 90 per cent
of parity when the measure reaches
the Senate floor, probably late next
week.
This would compare with Presi
dent Eisenhower's original request
for supports ranging from 75 to 90
per cent of parity and the House
approved "catch-all" farm bill under
which supports woudl range from
S2 1 u to 90 per cent.
