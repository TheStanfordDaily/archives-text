## 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 8 (UP) —The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee tentatively approved a proposal today requesting
President Eisenhower to consult with Congress on foreign policy
changes if Communist China is admitted to the United Nations.
The wateied-down proposal was approved 6-0 as an amendment

♦to the committee's foreign aid bill
shortly after Secretary of State John
Foster Dulles disclosed this country
will use its veto to keep Red China
i off the U.N. Security Council.
Dulles told a news conference,
however, that he is certain the Pei
j ping regime will not be admitted to
the world organization and that
there will be no occasion for a U.S.
walkout as demanded by Senate Re
publican Leader William F. Know
! land of California.
The proposal for "consultation"
was worked out by Knowland after
j conferences with key Democrats. It
; was far weaker than the California
I Republican's original demand for the
: United States to quit the U.N. the
I minute Red China gets in.
The amendment also restates Con
gress' opposition to admission of the
Peiping government to the world or
ganization. The committee action
< was not final because only six of
the 13 members were present.
Knowland told newsmen he is
| confident his proposal will win over
j whelming endorsement in the Sen
ate. The plan makes no specific rec
ommendation for steps the President
; should take other than to consult
I with Congress.
Dulles' views, given at a news
' conference, reinforced President Ei
-1 senhower's statement Wednesday
i that he is "unalterably opposed" to
! Communist China's admission to the
j world body.
It was the first time, however, that
the U.S. government has openly
j threatened to use its veto to bar the
| Peiping regime from the Security
Council. The previous Democratic
! administration regarded the issue as
j one of "procedure" and thus not
! subject to the veto.
