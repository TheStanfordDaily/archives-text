# 'Bathsheba' Film Studied For Social Significance
## 
### 
A Stanford researcher has probably established a new movie
going record by seeing the same full-length feature at least 18
times (he isn't sure how many).
On the strength of this record and his other exhaustive studies
of "David and Bathsheba," the number one box-office film hit of

1951, communications analyst Jay D.-
Haley has written a thesis analyzing I
the movie and its significance in |
American society.
Like other films, "David and |
Bathsheba" appeals to audiences be- 1
cause of its relation to the social j
and emotional condition of the au
dience, Haley points out.
The film explores war. hostility
between nations, a ruler's relation
to his people, religion, morality, and
man's relation to God. It also deals
with the primary human emotions
involved in birth, marriage, sex, and
death.
''Movie-goers can enjoy seeing
their situation—their beliefs about 1
life—projected on the 'make-be
lieve' screen," Haley theorizes.
'Their anxieties are presented, I
explored, and temporarily relived in
the screen fantasy. Wishes and fears J
are placed in ordered form, reassur
ingly shown to be shared by others,
and their conclusions about what the
world is like are reaffirmed.
'An ideally healthy person or so
ciety would not produce such fan
tasies," Haley says. "There would
be no need to justify one's conclu
sions about life if that life satisfied
those conclusions."

The content of such films may
therefore be valuable in making
predictions about the future of our
society, he believes. But he adds
that analysis of one film is hardly
sufficient.
lop box-office attractions of vari
ous years and different countries
would have to be studied and com
pared. Audiences would be ques
tioned.
Haley's is the first study of its
kind on a contemporary film.
The work took more than a year.
Besides viewing the film in many
public theaters, he obtained a copy
and studied scenes in detail. A com
plete script of the dialogue was
transcribed from the sound track.
His research was part of a larger
project for the investigation of the
processes of communication among
humans and animals. The project
has been supported by the Rocke
feller Foundation and is under the
auspices of the Department of So
ciology and Anthropology at Stan
ford.
It is directed by Gregory Bateson,
visiting professor at Stanford and
ethnologist with the Veterans' Ad
ministration Hospital in Menlo Park.
