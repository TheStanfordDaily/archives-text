-This has become the era in sports of the infinite Ail-American teams,
all-star teams, and halls of fame for athletes, coaches, and water-boys.
But Walt Gamage, the alert sports editor of the Palo Alto Times, and his
newspaper have come up with an idea that can't miss—a Stanford Hall
of Fame.
A selection board of 29—a1l of whom have been in close contact with
the athletic history of the Farm—will name 33 charter members to the
Hall this year and then an additional three each following year.
The strange part of this arrangement is that before long a good per
centage of the selection board will be in the Hall. Ernie Nevers, Bobby
Grayson, and Harlow Rothert are odds on. Although no spot has been
provided in the Hall for coaches, Pop Warner and Dink Templeton cannot
be left oil' any Stanford athletic honor roll. Perhaps Templeton will be
selected in rugby if no proviso is made for coaches.
All the above-mentioned are on the selection board. Dick Hyland, the
controversial columnist of the Los Angeles Times, stands a good chance of

making the Hall in years to come.
Hyland was one of the best defen
sive backs the Cards ever had.
Track star Bud Spencer, now a
columnist for the San Francisco
News and member of the selection
board, helped Stanford win the NC
AA title in 1928.
It will be interesting to see how
quickly some of the Tribe's coaching
staff make the Hall. The board will
select 13 football players, 8 track
men, 3 baseball players, 3 basket
ballers, 2 golfers, 2 swimmers, and
2 tennis players among the first
batch.
Head grid mentor Chuck Taylor,
who was an Ail-American guard and
one of the Wow Boys, stands very
high on the list of all-time stars.
Athletic Publicist Don Leibendorfer
(who is a member of the board) has
named Taylor to his all - Stanford
eleven.
The other local football hero
among the coaches is Taylor's as
sistant Pete Kmetovic, who ran at
half in the Wow Boy backfield which

included Frankie Albert, Norm Standlee, and Hugh Gallarneau.
Another Indian mentor who ranks among the Farm's best is track
headman Jack Weiershauser. Weiershauser was an iron man who could
run the 100 in 9.7, the 220 in 20.7, the low hurdles in 23.2, the 440 (his
best event) in 46.8. He also ran on an 880 relay team in 1937 which set
a world record of 1.25 flat.
The fourth in the list of present Stanford coaches who should soon gain
entrance to the Hall is the latest addition to the staff, the new basketball
coach Howie Dallmar. Hank Luisetti ranks number one in Stanford annals
and should be a unanimous choice. Then come Dallmar, Jim Pollard,
George Yardley, Eddie Tucker, Bill Cowden, and Don Burness all bunched
together.
It will be no easy job for the selection board to name just 33 athletes to
the new Hall this year; everyone they choose will deserve the honor.

A selection board of 29—a1l of whom have been in close contact with
the athletic history of the Farm—will name 33 charter members to the
Hall this year and then an additional three each following year.
The strange part of this arrangement is that before long a good per
centage of the selection board will be in the Hall. Ernie Nevers, Bobby
Grayson, and Harlow Rothert are odds on. Although no spot has been
provided in the Hall for coaches, Pop Warner and Dink Templeton cannot
be left oil' any Stanford athletic honor roll. Perhaps Templeton will be
selected in rugby if no proviso is made for coaches.
All the above-mentioned are on the selection board. Dick Hyland, the
controversial columnist of the Los Angeles Times, stands a good chance of

making the Hall in years to come.
Hyland was one of the best defen
sive backs the Cards ever had.
Track star Bud Spencer, now a
columnist for the San Francisco
News and member of the selection
board, helped Stanford win the NC
AA title in 1928.
It will be interesting to see how
quickly some of the Tribe's coaching
staff make the Hall. The board will
select 13 football players, 8 track
men, 3 baseball players, 3 basket
ballers, 2 golfers, 2 swimmers, and
2 tennis players among the first
batch.
Head grid mentor Chuck Taylor,
who was an Ail-American guard and
one of the Wow Boys, stands very
high on the list of all-time stars.
Athletic Publicist Don Leibendorfer
(who is a member of the board) has
named Taylor to his all - Stanford
eleven.
The other local football hero
among the coaches is Taylor's as
sistant Pete Kmetovic, who ran at
half in the Wow Boy backfield which

included Frankie Albert, Norm Standlee, and Hugh Gallarneau.
Another Indian mentor who ranks among the Farm's best is track
headman Jack Weiershauser. Weiershauser was an iron man who could
run the 100 in 9.7, the 220 in 20.7, the low hurdles in 23.2, the 440 (his
best event) in 46.8. He also ran on an 880 relay team in 1937 which set
a world record of 1.25 flat.
The fourth in the list of present Stanford coaches who should soon gain
entrance to the Hall is the latest addition to the staff, the new basketball
coach Howie Dallmar. Hank Luisetti ranks number one in Stanford annals
and should be a unanimous choice. Then come Dallmar, Jim Pollard,
George Yardley, Eddie Tucker, Bill Cowden, and Don Burness all bunched
together.
It will be no easy job for the selection board to name just 33 athletes to
the new Hall this year; everyone they choose will deserve the honor.


HANK LUISETTI
—Ranks number one
-This has become the era in sports of the infinite Ail-American teams,
all-star teams, and halls of fame for athletes, coaches, and water-boys.
But Walt Gamage, the alert sports editor of the Palo Alto Times, and his
newspaper have come up with an idea that can't miss—a Stanford Hall
of Fame.
