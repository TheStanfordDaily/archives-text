# Churchill Says No Red China In U.N.—Yet
## 
### 
LONDON, July 12 (UP)—Prime
Minister Winston Churchill said to
day in a major policy speech that
Britain, like the United States, op
poses admission of Communist China
to the United Nations at this time.
Churchill reported to the House
of Commons on his Washington talks
with President Eisenhower. He said
they healed the split between the
nations and brought their historic
alliance back into full flower.
''I have never had a more fruitful
visit than on this occasion," he said,
"nor has the feeling' of good will
been more strongly borne in upon
me."
"We dispelled, I think, some mis
understandings, even nightmares,
from the minds of our American
friends about the direction of our
policies," he told the House.
Commons will debate on Wednes
day the report ranging through the
focal points of world troubles and
tensions and making these main
points:
1. "This is certainly not the mo
ment" to reconsider U.N. member
ship for Red China, and it will take
some time for the Communists to
prove their good faith even if settle
ments on Indochina and Korea were
reached.
2. Britain still favors admission of
the Chinese if and when they con
vince'the world they are living up
to the U.N. charter — a point on
which Britain now is not satisfied.
3. Peaceful co-existence with the
Communists, rather than trying to
wipe out Communism by force,
might avert over the years the mass
destruction of humanity in the hy
drogen bomb age.
4. A Southeast Asia defense sys
tem is not incompatible with a set
tlement on Indochina in Geneva, lor
in any case "security arrangements"
for the area must be made.
5. It would be "little less than
madness" for France to leave West
Germany with no alternative to rais
ing a national army because of
French refusal to ratify the Euro
pean Army plan.
(i. Churchill and Eisenhower dis
cussed a possible meeting with Pre
mier Georgi Malenkov of Russia and
"broadly speaking I think the ques
tion is more one of timing than any
thing else."
