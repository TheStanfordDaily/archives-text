# Communists Take Key French Fortress in Advance on Hanoi
## 
### 
HANOI, July 12 (UP) —The Communists reported today that
their forces closing in on Hanoi had captured the fortress city of
Son Tay anchoring the French Union defenses 24 miles to the west.
On the other side of the capital, 3,000 Reds smashed at Hung
Yen, lower cornerpost of the delta lines. They were beaten off

and 300 were killed in five hours of+
violent combat. But the ultimate
fate of the town, 24 miles southeast j
of Hanoi, was uncertain.
Guerrilla raiders struck within six j
miles of Hanoi. Both sides suffered
"substantial losses" when a French j
commando force clashed with the
rebels.
The gunfire could be heard plainly
in the rain-drenched capital, where
garrison forces were preparing for
siege and civilians struggled to get :
out.
The Viet Minh radio broadcast
word of the capture of Son Tay,
sprawling city controlling transport 1
over a trunk highway running west j '
and a little north of Hanoi.
The report lacked immediate con
firmation. But the high command !
reported brisk skirmishing in the j
area. Newsmen who visited Son Tay
over the weekend found it largely j
deserted. Store fronts were nailed |
up. Markets were idle. Regular Viet
Minh forces were encamped across
the Red River.
The high command reported only
yesterday that strong rebel units
were overrunning outposts near Son
Tay. One was Aitno, 10 mites due
east of Son Tay.

Hanoi from the Red River delta, setting up roadblocks in its
wake, as the Communist troops move within 24 miles of the
capital city. Red guerrillas are reported only six miles from
Hanoi. —NEA Telephoto
