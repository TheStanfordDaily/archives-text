### 
WASHINGTON. July 12 (UP) â€”
The Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee today approved. 11 to 2, a
$3,100,000,000 foreign aid bill after
softening a proposed ban on aid to
France and Italy.
In a sometimes-stormv four-hour
session, the committee voted 8 to 5
on the recommendation of Secretary
of State John Foster Dulles to re
tain a milder restriction on Italian-
French military aid than approved
by the House.
Dulles made the plea in a brief
appearance today with the commit
tee before flying to Paris.
The Senate tentatively voted Sat
urday to chop off all aid to Italy and
France on Dec. 31, if they have not
by then, ratified the European De
fense Community agreement. How
ever, it contained a loophole that
would have permitted such aid to
continue if they joined in "alterna
tive" collective defense programs.
