Car Washing
Made Easy
For the past two years, a service
; has been available to local resi
dents which has taken the drudg
ery out of washing the family car.
In fact there is nothing to it. All
a motorist has to do is drive to the
Sharin System 5 Minute Car Wash
j on El Camino next to the Town &
' Country Village. In less time than
! it takes to smoke a cigarette, the
car is thoroughly cleaned inside
and out. And the costâ€”only $1.50.
Try the Sharin System. Most peo
ple believe it to be the finest auto
matic car wash on the Peninsula.
You'll agree.
