# France, Britain Draw Up Indochina Peace Terms
## 
### 
GENEVA, July 15 (UP)—France
and Britain have drawn up final
terms for peace in Indochina, in
cluding the partition of Viet Nam,
'neutralization" of Cambodia and
Laos, and writing off Hanoi, authori
tative sources reported tonight.
Premier Mendes-France and For
eign Secretary Anthony Eden were
described as confident of winning a
cease-fire in Indochina by Monday
night.

The drafting of terms for an "hon
orable" settlement in Indochina was
done without the active participation
of the United States, but it had the
tacit approval of Washington, won
in the Paris talks of Mendes-France,
Eden, and Secretary of State John
Foster Dulles.
The job done, Mendes-France and
Eden informed the foreign ministers
of the three associated states of In
dochina.
Meanwhile, in Indochina, thou
sands of Communist troops swarmed
over the three trunk highways west
and north of Hanoi today in an effort
to bypass outlying defenses and
sweep in against the capital itself.
Several rebel regiments overran
the outposts of Chi Kuan and Trung
Ha guarding Son Tay, anchor base
24 miles to the west. Son Tay was
imperiled or already untenable, mil
itary sources admitted.
The high command faced the de
cision of whether to weaken the de
fences of the Hanoi-Haiphong life
line by rushing troops to have the
roads to the west and north.
