# EXCOM RECOMMENDATION:
## No Open Hearings on New Constitution 
### 
The Executive Committee
modified its position on the stu
dent government committee
new constitution question Wed
nesday night after hearing a rec
ommendation from Erland Hig
ginbotham.
Higginbotham, who is a member of
the Committee on Student Govern
ment as well as the graduate repre
sentative to summer Excom, strongly
objected to plans for summer hear
ings between the student govern
ment and students interested in the j
proposed changes in the ASSU con- |
stitution.
Last week Excom favored a plan

for open sessions of the student gov
ernment committee to discuss dis
puted sections of the constitutional
outline before they are incorporated
in the draft constitution.
The sMdent government commit
tee is writing the first draft at the
present time.

Bob Jessen, undergraduate men's
representative, took immediate issue
with Higginbotham's views. Jessen
said that experts on both sides of the
constitutional controversy should be
heard in public hearings now.
Higginbotham stated that the
Committee on Student Government
was instructed by last spring's Ex
coni to prepare a draft constitution
for presentation in the fall and until
that was done the committee did not
feel that it could take the time for
open discussion sessions. He said
the committee "would get bogged
down."
Higginbotham pointed out that
most of the points which had been
argued at the open Excom meeting
