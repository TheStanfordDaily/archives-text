# EXCOM RECOMMENDATION:
## No Open Hearings on New Constitution 
### 
The Executive Committee
modified its position on the stu
dent government committee
new constitution question Wed
nesday night after hearing a rec
ommendation from Erland Hig
ginbotham.
Higginbotham, who is a member of
the Committee on Student Govern
ment as well as the graduate repre
sentative to summer Excom, strongly
objected to plans for summer hear
ings between the student govern
ment and students interested in the j
proposed changes in the ASSU con- |
stitution.
Last week Excom favored a plan

for open sessions of the student gov
ernment committee to discuss dis
puted sections of the constitutional
outline before they are incorporated
in the draft constitution.
The sMdent government commit
tee is writing the first draft at the
present time.

Bob Jessen, undergraduate men's
representative, took immediate issue
with Higginbotham's views. Jessen
said that experts on both sides of the
constitutional controversy should be
heard in public hearings now.
Higginbotham stated that the
Committee on Student Government
was instructed by last spring's Ex
coni to prepare a draft constitution
for presentation in the fall and until
that was done the committee did not
feel that it could take the time for
open discussion sessions. He said
the committee "would get bogged
down."
Higginbotham pointed out that
most of the points which had been
argued at the open Excom meeting
three weeks ago by Steve Horn, for
mer ASSU student manager and
graduate in political science, had
been discussed by the student 40v
rnment committee many times be
fore.
He added that the issues impor
tant to a few individuals may not be
important to the whole student body.
Higginbotham said that in concen
trating a discussion on these issues
the committee might be losing per
spective.
Higginbotham requested that the
Committee on Student Government
bo permitted to finish the draft con
stitution in peace and then if there
were time left in the quarter, the
committee would be glad to hold an
open forum for a word-by-word
discussion of the document.

Jessen was not satisfied, but as a
substitute he suggested that Steve
Horn be urged to write a formal
statement of his objections to the
proposals of the student government
committee which would be pre
sented to the fall Excom.
Therefore summer President
Marsh Freeman will draw up a for
mal declaration of summer Excom's
recommendations for approval at
next week's meeting. The declara
tion will incorporate Higginbotham's
request for a report from Horn, and
suggestions that the fall Excom in
itiate a widespread campaign to ed
ucate the student body on the prob
lems in the government structure.
In other business, Excom decided
that the all-campus dance in Stern
on Aug. 7 will be semi-formal. Bid
tickets will be sold for $1.50.
