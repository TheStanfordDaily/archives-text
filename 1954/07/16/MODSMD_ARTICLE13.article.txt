## They Wonder in Guatemala 
### 
'j the Editor:
Guatemala is a country about the size of Vermont and Maine put to
other—with a population the size of Minnesota—a country which in 1953
-ported $70 million worth of bananas, coffee, et al. to the United States
ud bought $55 million worth in return—a country whose three main in
'istries are U.S. owned (Sydney Gruson, N.Y. Times, June 2G).
On June 18 an army under the direction of Colonel Armas, a Guate
ulan in exile since 1951, entered Guatemala from Honduras and in the
ourse of two weeks successfully overthrew the existing government of
'resident Arbenz. On July 13 the United States recognized the new Armas
overnment.
What the future holds in store for Guatemala—for Latin America—for
he United States in its relations with Latin America—is anyone's guess,
nd man> are guessing. And some don't guess about the future—they
under about the present and the past.
They wonder about the statements like this referring to U.S. aid to
umas and company:
"We were late, but not too late. We gave little support, but it was still
nough . . . our world position could have collapsed on our own doorstep.
)ut we made it. Like the British in their days of imperial greatness we
uiddled through. Our moral support to anti-Communist forces in Guate
>.ala has crushed the anti-Christ and church bells will ring . . (Fred
parks, San Francisco News, July 7).
They wonder about our attempt to stop arms shipments to the former
Guatemalan government and our confiscation of a supply of practice shells
flipped by a Swiss firm to Guatemala (Nation, June 28). They wonder
oca use it's said that we fought the War of 1812 against England because
ohn Bull was searching and seizing on the high seas.
They wonder because some of the same diplomats who advised the
N. to clean up the mess in Indochina advised the U.N. to let the Guate
malans go it alone.
They wonder about such quick recognition of a government erected
y "force and violence" in one case and absence of recognition in other
ases.
rhey wonder with Ledwell Denny, Scripps-Howard foreign editor, San
rancisco News, June 23. He refers to the obvious advantage to the United
tates of a friendly regime in Guatemala but cautions:
"The price would be too high if Latin America, and the world generally,
elieved the revolution was made in the U.SA., and that the new govern
lent was a Ya'nqui puppet."
They wonder with Delaplane (San Francisco Chronicle. July 9) when
<• says in reference to the Guatemalan situation:
"A situation so fantastic that Eden was asked in Commons what was
ting on here. Mr. Edsn had no answers either. He said the situation was
mclear.' So did Washington. I hoped Mr. Aldrich (America's ambassador
England) was bringing home the answers. Maybe if we stand for some
ling, a good part of the world will stand with us."

"The price would be too high if Latin America, and the world generally,

Guatemala is a country about the size of Vermont and Maine put to
other—with a population the size of Minnesota—a country which in 1953
-ported $70 million worth of bananas, coffee, et al. to the United States
ud bought $55 million worth in return—a country whose three main in
'istries are U.S. owned (Sydney Gruson, N.Y. Times, June 2G).
On June 18 an army under the direction of Colonel Armas, a Guate
ulan in exile since 1951, entered Guatemala from Honduras and in the
ourse of two weeks successfully overthrew the existing government of
'resident Arbenz. On July 13 the United States recognized the new Armas
overnment.
What the future holds in store for Guatemala—for Latin America—for
he United States in its relations with Latin America—is anyone's guess,
nd man> are guessing. And some don't guess about the future—they
under about the present and the past.
They wonder about the statements like this referring to U.S. aid to
umas and company:
"We were late, but not too late. We gave little support, but it was still
nough . . . our world position could have collapsed on our own doorstep.
)ut we made it. Like the British in their days of imperial greatness we
uiddled through. Our moral support to anti-Communist forces in Guate
>.ala has crushed the anti-Christ and church bells will ring . . (Fred
parks, San Francisco News, July 7).
They wonder about our attempt to stop arms shipments to the former
Guatemalan government and our confiscation of a supply of practice shells
flipped by a Swiss firm to Guatemala (Nation, June 28). They wonder
oca use it's said that we fought the War of 1812 against England because
ohn Bull was searching and seizing on the high seas.
They wonder because some of the same diplomats who advised the
N. to clean up the mess in Indochina advised the U.N. to let the Guate
malans go it alone.
They wonder about such quick recognition of a government erected
y "force and violence" in one case and absence of recognition in other
ases.

rancisco News, June 23. He refers to the obvious advantage to the United
