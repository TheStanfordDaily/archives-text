# INTELLECTS. NOT TOMMY GUNS
## Plot, Acting Make 'Dial M' Successful Murder Movie 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Hollywood found a murder
suspense script that was far
from routine; Alfred Hitchcock
took charge of the production,
and "Dial M for Murder" is the
best movie I've seen iii a long
time.
The film was taken from the suc
cessful stage drama of the same
name, and Hitchcock has created a
rarity by enhancing rather than
spoiling the play's dramatic effect.
The camera can put across the story
in a way that the stage show could

not do.
Hitchcock takes
the audience away
from the London
apartment of Ray
Milland and Grace
Kelly for only a
few minor scenes.
"Dial M" is an
unusual type of

murder plot for the movies to han
dle. This is murder between gentle
men, a battle of intellects instead of
tommy guns. Except for one star
tling scene, there is no violence.
The smooth-talking Milland is the
central figure. He has lost the love
of his wife (Miss Kelly) and has
conceived the perfect murder to gain
revenge and to collect her money.
But Milland is far too smart to at
tempt the assignment. Instead he
blackmails (in his straight-from
the-shoulder, gentlemanly way, he
calls it "influencing") an old col
lege acquaintance, played by An
thony Dawson, to tie the death knot.
Milland portrays a man with an

j extraordinarily ingenius mind and |
I does his job convincingly. And that
I requires a little doing.
Miss Kelly makes a beautiful vic
j tim. It is easy to see why Robert
Cummings is in love with her. Even
I il it is not so easy to see she is
i in love with him.
Cummings appears to be the j
weakest actor of the lot. He handles j
his part well until he is required to i
be caught up in frenzied panic when ;
Miss Kelly's life is in danger. It
doesn't quite go over.
Dawson is excellent as the heart
less victim of Milland's blackmail
scheme.
But witli all due considerations to
Milland and Miss Kelly, I will prob
ably remember longest John Wil
liams' performance of the tall,
straight-backed police inspector.
Williams goes about his investiga
tion like a gentleman, like a Sher
lock Holmes. He puts the typical
police detectice, movie or other
wise, to disgrace.
His excellence as an actor and as- ;
tuteness as an inspector contribute
immeasurably to the production and i
the plot.

from routine; Alfred Hitchcock
took charge of the production,
and "Dial M for Murder" is the
best movie I've seen iii a long
time.
The film was taken from the suc
cessful stage drama of the same
name, and Hitchcock has created a
rarity by enhancing rather than
spoiling the play's dramatic effect.
The camera can put across the story
in a way that the stage show could

not do.
Hitchcock takes
the audience away
from the London
apartment of Ray
Milland and Grace
Kelly for only a
few minor scenes.
"Dial M" is an
unusual type of

murder plot for the movies to han
dle. This is murder between gentle
men, a battle of intellects instead of
tommy guns. Except for one star
tling scene, there is no violence.
The smooth-talking Milland is the
central figure. He has lost the love
of his wife (Miss Kelly) and has
conceived the perfect murder to gain
revenge and to collect her money.
But Milland is far too smart to at
tempt the assignment. Instead he
blackmails (in his straight-from
the-shoulder, gentlemanly way, he
calls it "influencing") an old col
lege acquaintance, played by An
thony Dawson, to tie the death knot.
Milland portrays a man with an

j extraordinarily ingenius mind and |
I does his job convincingly. And that
I requires a little doing.
Miss Kelly makes a beautiful vic
j tim. It is easy to see why Robert
Cummings is in love with her. Even
I il it is not so easy to see she is
i in love with him.
Cummings appears to be the j
weakest actor of the lot. He handles j
his part well until he is required to i
be caught up in frenzied panic when ;
Miss Kelly's life is in danger. It
doesn't quite go over.
Dawson is excellent as the heart
less victim of Milland's blackmail
scheme.
But witli all due considerations to
Milland and Miss Kelly, I will prob
ably remember longest John Wil
liams' performance of the tall,
straight-backed police inspector.
Williams goes about his investiga
tion like a gentleman, like a Sher
lock Holmes. He puts the typical
police detectice, movie or other
wise, to disgrace.
His excellence as an actor and as- ;
tuteness as an inspector contribute
immeasurably to the production and i
the plot.
It is the plot that makes "Dial M" |

j an unusual suspense drama. It is the
line acting and directing that makes
'"Dial M" an unusually successful
movie.
