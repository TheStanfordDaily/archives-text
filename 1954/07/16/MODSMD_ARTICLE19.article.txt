# WRIGHT ANGLES
## 
### Bill Wright 
Ray Young, the sophomore Stanford pitcher who stunned the Pacific !
Coast Conference last season with his miserly habits on the mound, hasn't ,
lost his golden touch as a member of a Pendleton, One.; semi-pro club.
Young, who was voted the PCC's most valuable player, has chalked up \
five wins against no defeats and has an amazing earned-run average of ;
.075. He has allowed only four earned tallies in 48 innings.

Young plays first base when he
isn't on the mound, and he's banging
the ball at a .378 clip. And be has
committed no errors at the initial
sack.

Clarke Nelson, the steady catcher,
and Rudy Figueroa, last year's frosh
shortstop, are also playing for Pen
dleton. and both are hitting in the
neighborhood of .300.
Figueroa is an outstanding pros
pect and may step right into the var
sity shortstop vacated by Warren
Goodrich. And that is some vacancy
to fill. Goodie virtually walled off
the left side of the infield.

Howie Dallmar, the Tribe's new
basketball coach, finally met a mem
ber of the varsity. Lanky Russ Law
ler, who led the PCC in scoring last

year, dropped into the BAC Wednesday to say hello.
Dallmar has been on the coast for a couple of weeks, briefing the basket
ball and housing situations. The housing has been taken care of; he bought
a Menlo Park home from Billy Alhouse, assistant baseball coach and Palo
Alto real estate man.
But Dallmar hasn't been able to study next year's cage material too well.
He s never seen the team in action and movies were taken of only two of
lats year's games. Both were early-season contests.

Energetic Chuck Taylor is taking a short vacation. This will be his
last chance to try to forget tootball for a good long time.
Taylor will be off to Chicago shortly to assist head coach Jim Tatum
ot Maryland prepare the College All-Stars for their game with the pro
fessional Detroit Lions,next month. Then it will be back to the Farm for
another season.
