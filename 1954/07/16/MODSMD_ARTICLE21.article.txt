CINCINNATI. 0., July 15 (UP)—
Stout Steve O'Neill, who came out
of the Pennsylvania hard coal coun
try to spend a long career as a big
league catcher and manager, went
back to the mines tonight and Terry
Moore, former star center fielder,
succeeded him as manager of the
Philadelphia Phillies.
For the 63-year-old O'Neill, one
of the most popular men in baseball,
it probably marked the finish of his
active career. For Moore, a hell-for
leather ex-member of the old St.
Louis Cardinal gas-house gang it
marked "a great opportunity."
Roy Hamey, the general manager
of the Phillies, said that O'Neill was
replaced because "a change was in
order."
The third - place Phillies, who
floundered badly of late — dropping
seven of their last nine Raines —had
lost much ground in the pennant
race to the first-place Giants and
runner-up Dodgers. Brooklyn beat
them in five of those games and the
Giants in two.
