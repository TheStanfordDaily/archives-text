# Banana Boat Saves Crew Of Raft Lehi
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, July 14
(UP) — Five weary crew mem
bers of the ill-fated raft Lehi
sailed toward San Francisco
aboard a banana boat today after
they had drifted erratically for
six days off the coast of Cali
fornia.
The cruise of the Lehi came to a
disastrous end early this morning
when the banana freighter Metapan
picked up her crew 20 miles off the
coast of Southern California after
the crew had radioed an SOS and
reported the Lehi was breaking up
in the choppy Pacific waters.
The first SOS from the Lehi came
at 7:43 p.m. yesterday after almost
eight hours of radio silence. The
Metapan, en route to San Francisco
from Central America, picked up the
crew at 4 a.m.
The ship reported the five, led by
DeVere Baker, 38 - year - old elder
of the Mormon church, were all in
good condition.
The Coast Guard said they would
hold an investigation of the Lehi's
final hours as soon as possible. A
Coast Guard spokesman said the
cutter Alert was still searching
coastal waters for the derelict raft
and would take it in tow or sink it
as the condition of the craft war
ranted.
When Baker and his crew left
here last Friday, he hoped to drift
2,400 miles to Hawaii in the raft as
a "shakedown" cruise for a longer
trip from the Persian Gulf to Cen
tral America to prove a Mormon
theory of migration to this continent.
The crew aboard the Metapan said
they would not tell their story until
they had checked with Dr. Arthur
Fearon, University of San Francisco
professor and sponsor of the expedi
tion.
