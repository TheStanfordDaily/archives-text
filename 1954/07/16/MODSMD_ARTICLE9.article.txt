# McCarthy Delays Staff Shake-up

### 
WASHINGTON, July 15 (UP) â€”
Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy staved off
a showdown today on demands for
a thorough "housecleaning" of the
staff of his Investigating Subcom
mittee by refusing to honor a proxy
vote by an absent member.
In a fiery three-hour secret ses
sion at which he accused his oppo
nents of "playing politics," McCar
thy prevented an immediate vote on
two motions which could have led
to a staff shake-up.
He refused to accept a proxy vote
by Sen. John L. McClellan, top Dem
ocratic member of the subcommit
tee, who is campaigning in his home
state of Arkansas. The Wisconsin
Republican ruled the proxy did not
conform with subcommittee rules
because it was too vague.
McCarthy said he will begin pub
lic hearings in Boston Saturday
on alleged Communists in defense
plants. He said he was inviting all
members of the subcommittee to at
tend, but Jackson and Symington
could not go on such short notice.
