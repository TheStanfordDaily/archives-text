# INDOCHINA TRUCE NEAR
## Reports Say Reds to Get All of Northern Viet Nam 
### 
GENEVA, Tuesday, July 20 (UP)—A truce agreement ending
the fighting in Indochina was reported near completion today and
scheduled to be signed before midnight tonight (4 p.m. PDT).
French Premier Pierre Mendes-France met with Viet Minh rebel
officials until late last night. A French spokesman said the premier

would meet later this morning with
British Foreign Secretary Anthony
Eden and Soviet Foreign Minister
V. M. Molotov.
A final plenary session of the Ge
neva conference at which the agree
ment will be signed was scheduled
to be held tonight before the dead
line set by the French premier.
Informants said several points re
main to be cleared up, but that
French agreement to give the Com
munists all of northern Viet Nam,
including Hanoi and Haiphong, made
agreement virtually certain.
The cease-fire agreement was ex
pected to partition Viet Nam near
the 17th parallel, some 300 miles be
low Hanoi. Informants said after
last night's meeting that the parti
tion line probably will be just north
of Route Nine, leaving the Tourane
air and naval base and the ancient
city of Hue in French hands.
A Communist source said the Reds
had agreed to leaving Tourane and
Hue under French control. It was
understood also that the agreement
will provide for the early surrender
of Hanoi and the evacuation of Hai
phong within 230 to 260 days after
the truce is signed.
Officials said that the agreements
would be signed by delegates of the
rival commanders in chief in each of
the three states of Indochina.
As the negotiations went full tilt
into the last round, the situation
shaped up like this, on the basis of
known facts and briefings by au
thoritative sources:
1. The Western and Communist
blocs were "very close" to agree
ment on the cease-fire line across
Viet Nam, almost certainly between
the 16th and 17th parallels.
2. "Tentative agreement" had been
reached on a three-nation control
commission to supervise the cease
fire, composed of Caanda, India, and
Poland.
3. Haggling went on over the
dates for the French evacuation of
Haiphong and the holding of elec
tions in Viet Nam.
4. The Communists were reported
demanding stronger guarantees by
the West of the cease-fire pact.

GENEVA, Tuesday, July 20 (UP)—A truce agreement ending
the fighting in Indochina was reported near completion today and
scheduled to be signed before midnight tonight (4 p.m. PDT).
French Premier Pierre Mendes-France met with Viet Minh rebel
officials until late last night. A French spokesman said the premier

would meet later this morning with
British Foreign Secretary Anthony
Eden and Soviet Foreign Minister
V. M. Molotov.
A final plenary session of the Ge
neva conference at which the agree
ment will be signed was scheduled
to be held tonight before the dead
line set by the French premier.
Informants said several points re
main to be cleared up, but that
French agreement to give the Com
munists all of northern Viet Nam,
including Hanoi and Haiphong, made
agreement virtually certain.
The cease-fire agreement was ex
pected to partition Viet Nam near
the 17th parallel, some 300 miles be
low Hanoi. Informants said after
last night's meeting that the parti
tion line probably will be just north
of Route Nine, leaving the Tourane
air and naval base and the ancient
city of Hue in French hands.
A Communist source said the Reds
had agreed to leaving Tourane and
Hue under French control. It was
understood also that the agreement
will provide for the early surrender
of Hanoi and the evacuation of Hai
phong within 230 to 260 days after
the truce is signed.
Officials said that the agreements
would be signed by delegates of the
rival commanders in chief in each of
the three states of Indochina.
As the negotiations went full tilt
into the last round, the situation
shaped up like this, on the basis of
known facts and briefings by au
thoritative sources:
1. The Western and Communist
blocs were "very close" to agree
ment on the cease-fire line across
Viet Nam, almost certainly between
the 16th and 17th parallels.
2. "Tentative agreement" had been
reached on a three-nation control
commission to supervise the cease
fire, composed of Caanda, India, and
Poland.
3. Haggling went on over the
dates for the French evacuation of
Haiphong and the holding of elec
tions in Viet Nam.
4. The Communists were reported
demanding stronger guarantees by
the West of the cease-fire pact.
