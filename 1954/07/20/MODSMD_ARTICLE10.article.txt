## "Denizens of the Bookstore' 
### 
To the Editor:
For seven consecutive summers I have joyfully made a pilgrimage to
•this mecca of learning which is Stanford, and each year it has been a
pleasure to see the improvements which have been wrought during the
intervening months. No one knows better than we who have attended
«,ther institutions of higher learning the superior qualities of "the farm."
Consequently, it is a never-ending source of amazement that this mighty
Unversity which assumes a role of leadership in advancing the dignity of
the human race would harbor in its bosom a gross example of man's in
humanity to man.
Did not Elsa Koch fall with Buchenwald? Who is it then that trains the
snapping, snarling denizens of the Bookstore? What powerful potion of
vitriol is it that each must drink to qualify for employment in that neces
sary adjunct to the University?
There have been exceptions, but alas! their tenure has always been
short lived.
It is to be hoped, for the sake of those who sojourn here during the
regular quarters, that this is only a seasonal malady and like dog days
passes away with the autumn leaves.
Ah well! "After many a summer dies the swan."
