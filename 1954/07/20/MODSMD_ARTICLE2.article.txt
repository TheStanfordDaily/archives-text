## 
### 
"Long - run prospects are
bright for business expansion
and industrial progress," pre
dicted Robert D. Calkins, presi
dent of the Brookings Institute
at Washington, D.C., in the open
ing address of the 13th Stanford
Business Conference yesterday.
Calkins also forecast "no settling
down to established practices" for
business and industry. "Innovation
and social readjustment are likely to
characterize the American society
for the foreseeable future," he said.
To support his forecast, Calkins
cited these factors:
1 Recent discoveries have not yet
had full impact in industry and so
ciety.
2. Problems now being investi
gated may yield discoveries that are
even more revolutionary than those
of recent experience.
3. More is currently being spent

on research and development than
ever before in history, and the re
sults of such research are likely to
be substantial in the years to come.
