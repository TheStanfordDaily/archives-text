# Construction Started On New Linear Accelerator
## 
### 
Stanford scientists, now mov
ing into their brand-new, $200,-'
000 Microwave Laboratory, are
losing no time in starting con
struction of still another electron
linear accelerator to be known
as "Mark IV."
Laboratory Director Edward L. i
Ginzton said the new atom smasher |
will be used for studies which will
contribute to development of more ]
efficient machines of this type, as j
well as for biological and medical
investigations.
Mark IV will generate about 70 .
million election volts, far less than
the big Mark 111 his group left be
hind.
Mark Ill's use as a key for un- j
locking the secrets of the atom will !
continue in the former building,
now known as the High - Energy
Physics Laboratory. This laboratory
is under the direction of Professor
W. K. H. Panofsky.
Both laboratories together com
prise the W. W. Hansen Laboratories
of Physics. They were named for
the late William Webster Hansen, |
pioneering Stanford physicist who
founded the University's large mi
crowave center.
Professor Ginzton said a staff of j
about 85 will man the new labora- j
tory when the move iS completed'
sometime next month. Transfer of
heavy shop equipment awaits the
installation of special electric power !
apparatus in the new building.
The laboratory also includes a
special underground radiation vault
for experiments with the now-build
ing Mark IV. The vault was de
signed for possible eventual use in j
radiation treatment of cancer and '
other diseases.
The accelerator development work '
is part of the laboratory's expanding '
program of microwave research. |
with renewed emphasis on funda- '
metnal investigations.
The feasibility of building linear

accelerators many times more pow
erful than even the Mark 111 is also
under investigation. Mark I and |
Mark II were the earlier pilot model |
accelerators which are still in use j
for experimental purposes.
Other microwave research in
cludes the further development of
accelerators for medical and indus
trial uses, and of klystrons, the j
world's most powerful vacuum 1
tubes. Besides being used to power !
the accelerators, the klystrons are j
key parts of radar, television, and
other radio communications.
The bulk of the new laboratory's |
work is government sponsored. In |
particular, the U.S. Atomic Energy j
Commission is supporting the Mark
IV and larger accelerator studies.
The Office of Naval Research is
sponsoring klystron work, while the
medical accelerator studies are un
der American Cancer Society and
U.S. Public Health Service sponsor
ship. /

Stanford scientists, now mov
ing into their brand-new, $200,-'
000 Microwave Laboratory, are
losing no time in starting con
struction of still another electron
linear accelerator to be known
as "Mark IV."
Laboratory Director Edward L. i
Ginzton said the new atom smasher |
will be used for studies which will
contribute to development of more ]
efficient machines of this type, as j
well as for biological and medical
investigations.
Mark IV will generate about 70 .
million election volts, far less than
the big Mark 111 his group left be
hind.
Mark Ill's use as a key for un- j
locking the secrets of the atom will !
continue in the former building,
now known as the High - Energy
Physics Laboratory. This laboratory
is under the direction of Professor
W. K. H. Panofsky.
Both laboratories together com
prise the W. W. Hansen Laboratories
of Physics. They were named for
the late William Webster Hansen, |
pioneering Stanford physicist who
founded the University's large mi
crowave center.
Professor Ginzton said a staff of j
about 85 will man the new labora- j
tory when the move iS completed'
sometime next month. Transfer of
heavy shop equipment awaits the
installation of special electric power !
apparatus in the new building.
The laboratory also includes a
special underground radiation vault
for experiments with the now-build
ing Mark IV. The vault was de
signed for possible eventual use in j
radiation treatment of cancer and '
other diseases.
The accelerator development work '
is part of the laboratory's expanding '
program of microwave research. |
with renewed emphasis on funda- '
metnal investigations.
The feasibility of building linear

accelerators many times more pow
erful than even the Mark 111 is also
under investigation. Mark I and |
Mark II were the earlier pilot model |
accelerators which are still in use j
for experimental purposes.
Other microwave research in
cludes the further development of
accelerators for medical and indus
trial uses, and of klystrons, the j
world's most powerful vacuum 1
tubes. Besides being used to power !
the accelerators, the klystrons are j
key parts of radar, television, and
other radio communications.
The bulk of the new laboratory's |
work is government sponsored. In |
particular, the U.S. Atomic Energy j
Commission is supporting the Mark
IV and larger accelerator studies.
The Office of Naval Research is
sponsoring klystron work, while the
medical accelerator studies are un
