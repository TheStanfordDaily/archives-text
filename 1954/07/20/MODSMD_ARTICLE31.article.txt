try -
The SHI will establish a facility to

erature-search service to public in
terests.
Business Week discusses the

"Nonprofit Research Can Pay Its
i Way." The institute began in 194G
with a $100,000 gift from business
men led by Athol Mc√üean of Stand
| aid Oil of California.
Now under the direction of Dr.
Jesse Edward Hobson, SRI is lo
cated in the Stanford Village. But
i a new site is expected to be selected
j within two months.
The research covers the fields of
physical sciences, engineering, and
industrial economics and entails
yearly operating expenses of $7,000,-
: 000.
SHI does not come under the con

j President Wallace Sterling and sev
