# French Tanks Push Reds Back

### 
HANOI, July 19 (UP)â€”Tank-led
French Union forces 5,000 strong
drove the Communists back along
the main highway northwest of Ha
noi today in heavy fighting that was
regarded here as probably the last
of the war.
Military sources said one purpose
of the powerful thrust along Hlim
yen Road was to show the Reds that
the French would fight right up to
the expected signing of a truce in
Geneva.
The high command reported "fa
vorable progress" by French and
Viet Nam troops fanning out along
both sides of Highway 2 this side of
Vinh Yen, 25 miles northwest of Ha
noi.
With air and armored support, the
attacking units were rolling the
Reds back in the area of Huong
Canh, four miles southwest of Vinh
Yen, where they had seized a stretch
of the highway and cut off the
French outpost defenses at and
around Vinh Yen.
