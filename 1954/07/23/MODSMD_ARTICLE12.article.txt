## 'Friendly Bookstore Employees' 
### 
"1 . the Editor:
I find it most regrettable that reader Don Bryant (The Daily of July 20)
should have harbored his dissatisfaction with the Stanford Bookstore for
years.
However, 1 find it even more regrettable that he should express this
dissatisfaction in the editorial columns of The Daily, and, moreover, make
a blanket denouncement of the entire staff. It has been my experience that
the Bookstore employees are as friendly and courteous a group as one
could hope for.
I feel quite suit' that the management and Board of Directors are always
receptive to comments, both pro and con, with respect to the operation of
the Bookstore. 1 would suggest that we try to practice one of the oldest
principles of good human relationships: "Praise in public; criticize in
private."
