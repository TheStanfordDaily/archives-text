## Italy Needs Economic Aid To Retain Its Democracy 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Vincent M. Barnett, visiting professor in political science, told
the Tuesday Evening Series audience this week that there is no
immediate danger of a collapse of democratic institutions in Italy.
But he said that in the long run Italy will not be able to maintain
its democratic government unless it obtains economic aid from
the United States. ♦

Burnett, who lias spent four and 1
a half years in Italy since the war,
titled his talk "U.S. Foreign Eco
nomic Policy and the Crisis of Ital- ;
ian Democracy."
While there is no need for hasty i
action such as a repressive crack- ;
down on the Communist or the far- J
hit Socialist in Italy, Bar- !
licit said, "Over the next 10 or 12
years there must be joint U.S. and
Italian action aimed at reducing un
employment and raising living
standards."
He recommended that the Ameri
can government, if it wishes to save j
the democratic institutions, reduce j
tariffs, grant a higher immigration j
quota to Italians, and provide eco- j
liomic aid and technological assist- ;
ance.
However, he added, "In the pres
ent climate of American opinion, it
is unlikely that these things will be
done."
The fear that democracy might be
slipping in Italy resulted from the
elections of June 195;} when the cen
ter coalition led by Alcide de Gas
peri's Christian Democrats suffered
a setback.
The votes which the center coa
lition lost were divided between the
Communists on the far left and the
Monarchists and the neo-Fascists on
the far right.
Burnett didn't see any serious

Communist danger in this trend be
cause there has been no increase in
the number of card-carrying Reds.
He considered it primarily a protest
against the economic situation in the
country.
The economic problem is a serious
one with about two million unem
ployed and another two million
"psychologically unemployed," that
is, in danger of losing their jobs or
working at tasks far below individ
ual capacity.
But Barnett did blame United
States policy for at least part of the
decline in de Gasperi's strength. He
charged that mishandling of the
Trieste problem and negotiations
with Yugoslavia at the time of the
election hurt the center parties.
