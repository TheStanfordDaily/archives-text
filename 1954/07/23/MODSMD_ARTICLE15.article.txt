# Grad Crash-Lands Jet
## Pilot Sustains Minor Injuries 
### 
Stanford graduate Lieut. Jo
seph David Cusick is recovering
today from his dramatic jet
plane ciash in Sunnyvale.
Cusick, class of '51, landed his
crippled jet fighter Wednesday night
i in a cherry orchard next to the Pa
cific Can Co. building. He .suffered
! only a broken right arm and cuts
and bruises on his face.
According to observers, the plane
j hurtled through the tops of the
trees, ripped a 15-foot hole in the
; roof of the Pacific Can Co. building,
j and landed a scant 100 yards from
[ the nearest houses.
According to Navy spokesmen, the
j 24-year-old jet pilot was returning
from a routine flight with other
| planes in his squadron at 8:21 p.m.
[ The planes were over Sunnyvale in
| a normal landing pattern.
Cusick had lowered the wheels of
his plane, an FGF-9 Cougar, when
the jet developed a "flameout," or
j motor failure due to lack of fuel.
Refusing to bail out, Cusick guid
| ed his plane to the only place in the
j heavily populated area clear of
j houses — the cherry orchard. The
i plane was completely demolished.
Cusick was pulled out of the
plane, which landed right side up
without bursting into flame, by resi
dents of nearby homes.
Cusick was graduated from Stan
ford in 1.951 with a degree in jour
j nalism. He was sports writer on The
| Stanford Daily, a letterman in wres-
I tling, and president of Delta Sigma
Chi, honorary journalism fraternity.
A veteran of the Korean War, Cu
! sick lives in Palo Alto with his wife
and son.
