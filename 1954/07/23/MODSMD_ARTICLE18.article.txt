# Menlo Park May Enter Negotiations for Village
## 
### 
Discussions on the future of
Stanford Village have taken a
new twist. Until lately, it has
been assumed that Stanford
would negotiate with the U.S.
government for the entire area.
Now it appears that Menlo Park
might acquire a portion of the
Village.
The late of the 85-acre property
is still under consideration by Menlo
Park. Stanford, and the San Fran
cisco office of the Public Housing
Administration.

According to Arthur Chladek, as
sistant director of the S.F. office,
preliminary negotiations have indi
cated that Stanford, which needs
the land for student housing, may
purchase only a portion of it.
If the final agreement confirms
that only a portion of Stanford Vil
lage will be sold to the University,
he added, Menlo Park will be in
vited to negotiate for the remainder.
A Stanford spokesman . said that it
"may or may not" turn out that the
University will need only a portion
of the Village.
Dwight Adams, assistant business
manager, said the final decision will
hinge on how much land the Uni
versity is offered and how much it
will cost.
Stanford officials have agreed in
formally to turn the land over to
Menlo Park at cost after it is no
longer needed for student housing.
Chladek stated that Stanford offi
cials said that their "minimum"
needs are for a portion of the land
now used for single student housing
and for all of the land used for fam
ily apartments.
This would leave a substantial
portion of the Village for Menlo
Park to purchase, including the area
now occupied by the Stanford Re
search Institute.
