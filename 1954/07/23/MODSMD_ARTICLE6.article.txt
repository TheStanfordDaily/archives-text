# Senate Argues On Atomic Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. July 22 (UP) —
A weary Sentate headed toward its
second straight all-night session to
night and Republican leaders moved
to invoke a rarely-used "gag" rule
to force action on the administra
tion's atomic bill.
The Senate took time tut to ap
prove two amendments to the con
troversial emasure—including one to
let the government make and sell
atomic power — and then resumed
its marathon talkathon with no end
in sight.
Senate Republican Leader Wil
liam F. Knowland sent word to re
porters he is sticking to his plan to
keep the Senate in session until the
bill is passed.
Senator Albert Gore (D., Tenn.),
leader of the bloc opposing the bill,
although weary from long hours on
the floor, said he saw no immediate
prospect of a vote. He said critics of
the legislation still have amend
ments to offer.
Meanwhile, the House passed a
$1,303,334,628 supplemental money
bill today after bowing to Presiden
tial pressure and restoring part of
a whopping 40 per cent cut ordered
by its Appropriations Committee.
Despite the action, the final bill
was about 33.5 per cent below Pres
ident Eisenhower's original request.
The measure, which now goes to the
Senate, was approved by voice vote.
The Appropriations Committee had
recommended only S 1,194,188.079 for
the program.
