# Ex-FBI Man Tells Of U.S. Red Setup
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
The FBI as an investigating force and an investigating force only
can combat Communism in the United States, said Harry M. Kirn
fcall, former head of FBI espionage during the war, at last night's
session of the Stanford Business Conference.
But he guickly added that Congressional committees are "very,

very wonderful" things and can be"*
of tremendous assistance in ridding
the country of Communists.
Kimball outlined the Communist
organization and underground intel- |
licence setup in the United States in
a talk entitled "Communism at Your \
Door."
He said that there are from 2,500 '■
to 3.000 known Communists in the
organization's 13th district, which
includes California, Nevada, and
Hawaii. The headquarters is in San J
Francisco.
Kimball indicated the amount of
pressure that the FBI has put on
the Red agents by showing the de
cline in party activity since 1950.
Communist national conventions are
scheduled every two years, but
there hasn't been one in the last
four. The national committee of the
party totaled 55 members in 1948
but only 13 in 1952.
Kimball said that the best method
of combatting the Communists is the
informer system, that is, Red agents
turning over data to the FBI. In a
question and answer period he said
the FBI knows 90 per cent of the
Comunists in this country and
where they are.
In answer to another question,

Kimball said, "1 don't think we
should outlaw the Communist par
ty" because it would hurt investiga
tions. "I think we can defeat it with
good American common sense."
Asked about a possible Red mas
ter plan to take over the country in
case of war, Kimball said, "We
probably know what that plan is
and we just hope we can beat it."
He was strongly against giving the
FBI any judicial authority because
this has been the first step toward
securing a dictatorship in other
countries in the world.
In one of his final questions Kim
ball was asked about Senator Jo
seph McCarthy. He called McCar
thy "a streetfighter," but said that
he wasn't un-American.
Kimball said that the people are
responsible for the McCarthy situa
tion. He said that "evidently the
people of Wisconsin wanted him and
we're stuck with him. And God bless
us, it's American."
Kimball also expressed a lear that
the Communists might be able to
take over the rest of Asia by infil
trating their agents through the
boundary lines set up in the peace
treaties.

pressure that the FBI has put on
the Red agents by showing the de
cline in party activity since 1950.
Communist national conventions are
scheduled every two years, but
there hasn't been one in the last
four. The national committee of the
party totaled 55 members in 1948
but only 13 in 1952.
Kimball said that the best method
of combatting the Communists is the
informer system, that is, Red agents
turning over data to the FBI. In a
question and answer period he said
the FBI knows 90 per cent of the
Comunists in this country and
where they are.
In answer to another question,

Kimball said, "1 don't think we
should outlaw the Communist par
ty" because it would hurt investiga
tions. "I think we can defeat it with
good American common sense."
Asked about a possible Red mas
ter plan to take over the country in
case of war, Kimball said, "We
probably know what that plan is
and we just hope we can beat it."
He was strongly against giving the
FBI any judicial authority because
this has been the first step toward
securing a dictatorship in other
countries in the world.
In one of his final questions Kim
ball was asked about Senator Jo
seph McCarthy. He called McCar
thy "a streetfighter," but said that
he wasn't un-American.
Kimball said that the people are
responsible for the McCarthy situa
tion. He said that "evidently the
people of Wisconsin wanted him and
we're stuck with him. And God bless
us, it's American."
Kimball also expressed a lear that
the Communists might be able to
take over the rest of Asia by infil
trating their agents through the
boundary lines set up in the peace
treaties.
The FBI as an investigating force and an investigating force only
can combat Communism in the United States, said Harry M. Kirn
fcall, former head of FBI espionage during the war, at last night's
session of the Stanford Business Conference.
But he guickly added that Congressional committees are "very,

very wonderful" things and can be"*
of tremendous assistance in ridding
the country of Communists.
Kimball outlined the Communist
organization and underground intel- |
licence setup in the United States in
a talk entitled "Communism at Your \
Door."
He said that there are from 2,500 '■
to 3.000 known Communists in the
organization's 13th district, which
includes California, Nevada, and
Hawaii. The headquarters is in San J
Francisco.
