The 13th annual Stanford Business Conference winds up this
morning in Cubberley Auditorium with another series of three
talks by prominent business leaders.
Robert D. Calkins, president of the Brookings Institution in
Washington, D.C., will lead off the session, as he has each of the

four previous days, with a discus
sion of ''The Problems Ahead."
Gilbert Brighouse. chairman of
the Department of Psychology at
Occidental College, will talk on
"What Kind of a Leader Are YOU?"
George Albert Smith, Jr., of the
Harvard Graduate School of Busi
ness Administration, will conclude
the week-long conference, speaking
on '"Management Decentralization
Programs."
In his talk yesterday morning
Calkins stated that because of the
stiff competition for customers, busi
nesses must be ready to innovate in
order to survive.
He said: '"Changes and innova
tions resulting from research are es
sential to national survival and to
the growth and survival of Ameri
can business."
Calkins further stressed that these
changes should be made when busi
ness conditions are good.
We need technological superior
ity in the United States, he said,
because we are depleting our na
tional resources faster than any
other nation in the world and be
cause the Communist bloc has a
great deal more manpower avail
able than the United States.
Wednesday Sydney Roslow, direc
tor of The Pusel, Inc.. said that he
didn't think television would mean
the death of radio.
In his talk titled "A Review of
Radio and Television Audience Re
search" Roslow said that the num
ber of daytime radio listeners is on
the increase.
Over 400 business leaders are at
tending the conference, which is
sponsored by the Graduate School
