## 
### 
LONDON, July 26 (UP)—Britons
were alarmed tonight over the pos
sible consequences of the shooting
down of two Chinese fighters by U.S.
Navy planes.
The alarm was reflected in
screaming newspaper headlines and
parliamentary reaction. For the time
being official reaction was lacking.
The mounting concern overrode
limited satisfaction derived from a
quick Chinese Communist apology
for shooting down a British airlienr.
Prime Minister Winston Church
ill and Foreign Secretary Anthony
Eden were believed studying re
ports ot fhe American-Chinese clash
in the Hainan area off the Chinese
ocast, where the passenger plane
was destroyed last Friday. Six
Americans were aboard.
British Overseas Airways ordered
its pilots flying to and from Hong
Kong to skirt Hainan by a greater
margin henceforth. Informed sources
said the notice meant the national
ized airline's planes would fly "sub
stantially farther south" than the 90-
mile limit previously observed.
"Following the incident involving
an air liner of Cathay Pacific Air
Lines last week, BOAC has rerouted
their aircraft flying between Singa
pore and Hong Kong and Bangkok
and Hong Kong to a course still far
ther south of Hainan Island," the
announcement said.
News of the clash was flashed from
Washington while Eden was wel
coming in the House of Commons
the Chinese apology for the attack
on the British aircraft.
Unaware at the time of the subse
quent aerial combat, Eden made it
clear that Britain appreciated and
welcomed the U.S. air assistance in
the area.
