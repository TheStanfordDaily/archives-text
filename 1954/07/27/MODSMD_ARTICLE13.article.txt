# FILM 'MAGNIFICENTLY STAGED'
## 'Caine Mutiny' Absorbing, But Lacks Book's Punch 
### MARY ELLEN ROMNEY 
There are two ways that Columbia's film of "The Caine Mutiny"
can be jud<f*d: one, as an ordinary movie for entertainment, and
two, as a dramatiztion of Hermn Wouk's novel.
The two methods of consideration bring different answers.
The United States Navy in World War II is the movie's setting.

Specifically the setting is the U.S.S.
Caine, a battered minesweeper, "an
outcast in the Navy named after the
greatest outcast in history," to quote
Lieutenant Keefer.
More significant than the naval

war in the Pacific,
however, is the
war aboard the
Caine — between
assorted personal
ities recruited
from the regular
Navy and from ci
vilian life to be
come the ship's of
ficers.

There's Willis Seeward Keith, a
c. '»w-cut Princetonian with new en
sign stripes on his sleeve. Robert
Francis looks every inch the part,
although his acting is not yet of
very convincing caliber.
Lieutenant Keefer, communica
tions officer and novelist aboard the
Caine, at times emerges as the real
hero—or villain—in the tale as the
"tragic flaw" of his character un
folds. Fred Mac Murray does an ad
equate job in the role.
The movie is generally well cast
and boasts particularly fine per-

T
formances from Humphrey Bogart
as the paranoic Captain Queeg, Van
Johnson in the role of the simple,
honest Lieutenant Maryk, and Jose
Ferrer as the brilliant Jewish law
yer who comes to the aid of the
Caine's mutinous crew.
As for the love story—it cannot
be said that the drama between Wil
lie and the nightclub singer May j
Wynn is over emphasized. Rather it
is over simplified so that only hoi- 1
low scenes remain of the emotion
ally momentous romantic parts of 1
j the book.
With the elimination of a large j
j part of Willie's personal conflicts in
[ the movie, it is easy to feel that he j
J has become a mere bystander in his j
own story.
As a whole, "The Caine Mutiny" |
is magnificently staged, with techni
color, Uic Navy, and natural scenery
effectively combined. As in the book,
the two pictorially vivid scenes are
the typhoon sequence, when the un
! balanced Queeg endanegrs his ship,
and the tense court martial scene
with Steve Maryk on trial for mu
tiny.
These scenes capture the spirit of
the novel, with dialogue often taken j
verbatim.
"The Caine Mutiny" as a movie
has lost much of the punch it has as
j a book, particularly in the psycho
j logical presentation of the main
I characters.
The film offers several hours of j
fast - moving, absorbing entertain- J
ment with a good look at life in the i
Navy, but the ending is disappoint
ing and rather confused. Willie
Keith is left without a command, a
personality, or a character.

As a whole, "The Caine Mutiny" |
is magnificently staged, with techni
color, Uic Navy, and natural scenery
effectively combined. As in the book,
the two pictorially vivid scenes are
the typhoon sequence, when the un
! balanced Queeg endanegrs his ship,
and the tense court martial scene
with Steve Maryk on trial for mu

the novel, with dialogue often taken j

"The Caine Mutiny" as a movie
has lost much of the punch it has as
j a book, particularly in the psycho
j logical presentation of the main
I characters.
The film offers several hours of j
fast - moving, absorbing entertain- J
ment with a good look at life in the i
Navy, but the ending is disappoint
ing and rather confused. Willie
Keith is left without a command, a
personality, or a character.

There are two ways that Columbia's film of "The Caine Mutiny"
can be jud<f*d: one, as an ordinary movie for entertainment, and
two, as a dramatiztion of Hermn Wouk's novel.
The two methods of consideration bring different answers.
The United States Navy in World War II is the movie's setting.

Specifically the setting is the U.S.S.
Caine, a battered minesweeper, "an
outcast in the Navy named after the
greatest outcast in history," to quote
Lieutenant Keefer.
More significant than the naval

war in the Pacific,
however, is the
war aboard the
Caine — between
assorted personal
ities recruited
from the regular
Navy and from ci
vilian life to be
come the ship's of
ficers.

There's Willis Seeward Keith, a
c. '»w-cut Princetonian with new en
sign stripes on his sleeve. Robert
Francis looks every inch the part,
although his acting is not yet of
very convincing caliber.
Lieutenant Keefer, communica
tions officer and novelist aboard the
Caine, at times emerges as the real
hero—or villain—in the tale as the
"tragic flaw" of his character un
folds. Fred Mac Murray does an ad
equate job in the role.
The movie is generally well cast
and boasts particularly fine per-

T
formances from Humphrey Bogart
as the paranoic Captain Queeg, Van
Johnson in the role of the simple,
honest Lieutenant Maryk, and Jose
Ferrer as the brilliant Jewish law
yer who comes to the aid of the
Caine's mutinous crew.
As for the love story—it cannot
be said that the drama between Wil
lie and the nightclub singer May j
Wynn is over emphasized. Rather it
is over simplified so that only hoi- 1
low scenes remain of the emotion
ally momentous romantic parts of 1
j the book.
