### 
NEW YORK, July 2(1 (UP) — A
shy, freckle-faced French nurse in
a simple white uniform was hailed
as the heroine of the entire free
world today when she came to the
United States as the first woman Ln
history to be the honored guest of
Congress.
"1 do not deserve this honor, for
I have only done my duty," said
modest Lieutenant Genevieve tie
Galard Terraube, 29 -year-old "An
gel of Dien Bierv Phu."
Not since the Marquis de Lafa
yette came to the United States jis
the guest of Congress in 1924 has a
French citizen been so honored.
Only one other person has been a
Congressional guest the Hungarian
patriot revolutionary leader Lajos
Kossuth, who came here in 1951.
