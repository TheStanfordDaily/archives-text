## 
### 
NEW YORK. July 2(! (UP) A
revolutionary proposal that the ma
jor league. play inter-league com
petition during the regular season
was withdrawn before a joint Aifier
iean-National League meeting today
after it was defeated in a meeting of
the American League.
Hank Green berg, general mana
ger of the Cleveland Indians, had
hoped to obtain support for a sug
gestion that each major-league team
play four games with every other
club of the rival circuit.
The recommendation, withdrawn
at a joint meeting mefore Commis
sioner Ford Fi ick, had drawn heavy
opposition at a separate American
League meeting, where it was at
tacked by Chicago, Washington, De
troit. New York, and Philadelphia.
"I didn't think it had a prayer,"
Grecnberg admitted. "I still think
it would lie good for baseball, but
theft' things have to he beaten
three or four times before they
are accepted. There was opposi
tion to night baseball, too, before
it was accepted."
The most interesting action taken
at the meeting was the award of the
l!)r>. r > All-Star game to Milwaukee.
There was no date set for the game.
Other action included:
The meeting approved a resolu
tion from the NationaP Collegiate
Athletic Association which provides
that players cannot be signed by the
majors after they have become var
sity athletes in their second year of
college.
The boys can be signed from the
time they graduate from high school
through their first year in college
until they become eligible for the
varsity.
ft ruled that no games shall be
I played following the Sunday imme
diately preceding the All-Star game
until the day alter the classic.
It ruled that players may not be
ordered to report for spring train-*
. ing before March 1 and that the first
exhibition may not be played until
March 10, as requested by the play
ers' organization.
