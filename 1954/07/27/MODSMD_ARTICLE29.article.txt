# Passage of Gore Amendment May Break Senate 'Logjam'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. July 26 (UP) —Senate Republican leaders ac
cepted a major Democratic amendment to President Eisenhower's
atomic bill today, and Senator Albert Gore (D., Tenn.) said the
"logjam" in the three-weeks-old talkathon "is now broken."
Meanwhile Eisenhower and his Republican legislative leaders

agreed to keep Congress in session
xin4i 1 "Labor Day or later" it neces
sary to break the Senate filibuster
and complete action on the GOP
program.
Before the Senate debate began.
Congressional leaders had been aim
ing at a July 31 adjournment date.
Chairman Homer Ferguson of the
Senate GOF Policy Committee said
the target has been moved back to
Aug. 7. Other veteran legislators
th< ughht Aug. 14 would be a more
realistic date.
Gore, a top leader in the tight
against the atomic measure, said the
Si late should be able to take a final
vote on the measure by Wednes
day. He added that he would be
"very much surprised" if Republican
leader William F. Know land (Calif.)
orders any mote all-night sessions.
The break came with dramatic
suddenness just a few hours after
the House, impatient with the long
Senate delay, hustled its own ver
sion of the bill to easy passage.

Gore said his amendment repre
i sented a "test" from the standpoint
|of foes of the President's bill. He
said they had "had enough" of
Know land's previous tactics of kill
ing amendments bv tabling them—a
parliamentary maneuver which is
not debatable.
The big question mark now ap
| peared to be Senator Wayne Morse
! (Ind., Ore.), the Senate's filibuster
champion, who has vowed to con
; tinue the tight alone if necessary.
However, Morse raised no objection
j to two unanimous consent agree
! ments today.
The House approved the atomic
! bill by' a roll call vote of 230 to 154
I after voting 222 to (55 to reject a
I move by Representative Chet Holi
i field Calif.), to kill the legis
] lation by sending it back to the
I Joint House-Senate Atomic Energy
I Committee.


A DECISION IS REACHED—Speaker of the House Joseph Mar
tin leaves the chamber with Richard E. lefford, deputy sergeant
at arms in charge of the mace, after the House came to an agree
ment on the atomic energy bill. Yesterday the House approved
its version 230-154. but the Senate was still debating the issue.

WASHINGTON. July 26 (UP) —Senate Republican leaders ac
cepted a major Democratic amendment to President Eisenhower's
atomic bill today, and Senator Albert Gore (D., Tenn.) said the
"logjam" in the three-weeks-old talkathon "is now broken."
Meanwhile Eisenhower and his Republican legislative leaders

agreed to keep Congress in session
xin4i 1 "Labor Day or later" it neces
sary to break the Senate filibuster
and complete action on the GOP
program.
Before the Senate debate began.
Congressional leaders had been aim
ing at a July 31 adjournment date.
Chairman Homer Ferguson of the
Senate GOF Policy Committee said
the target has been moved back to
Aug. 7. Other veteran legislators
th< ughht Aug. 14 would be a more
realistic date.
Gore, a top leader in the tight
against the atomic measure, said the
Si late should be able to take a final
vote on the measure by Wednes
day. He added that he would be
"very much surprised" if Republican
leader William F. Know land (Calif.)
orders any mote all-night sessions.
The break came with dramatic
suddenness just a few hours after
the House, impatient with the long
Senate delay, hustled its own ver
sion of the bill to easy passage.

Gore said his amendment repre
i sented a "test" from the standpoint
|of foes of the President's bill. He
said they had "had enough" of
Know land's previous tactics of kill
ing amendments bv tabling them—a
parliamentary maneuver which is
not debatable.
