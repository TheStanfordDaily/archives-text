# U.S. DOWNS RED PLANES
## Chinese Fighters Attack Navy Rescue Operations 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 26 (UP) —U.S. Navy planes on a "mission
of mercy" shot down two attacking Chinese fighters last night in
a blazing air battle over the China Sea, it was disclosed today.
The Communist pilots and a Chinese gunboat crew opened fire
on the carrier-based American planes as they were searching for

survivors of a British airliner shot
clown by the Reds.
The Navy pilots did not return the
gunboat fire but they whirled into ;
the two Red planes and sent them
spinning into the ocean about 12
miles off the coast of Red-held Hai
nan Island.
There were no U.S. casualties in
the brief but sharp encounter, which i
occurred about 8 p.m. PDT, two !
days after the British airliner was
downed with the loss of three Amer
ican lives.
The incident was announced in
statements by Defense Secretary
Charles E. Wilson and Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles, who vig
orously denounced Red China's
"belligerent" action.
Diplomats here viewed the two
weekend clashes as the most seri
ous strain on U.S.-Chinese rela
tions since the end of the Korean
war.
Angry Congressional leaders ac- i
cused Red China of "piracy" in
the air and threw full hacking to
the action of the U.S. airmen.
Senate leaders—including Repub
lican William F. Knowland (Calif.)
and Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson
(Tex.) —called for national unity in
the face of "an unprovoked, warlike
attack on the United States."
Johnson declared, "This is a time
for America to unite. . . . There can
be no partisanship on such an issue.
We must resolve to be cool, decisive,
and ready to act as Americans must
always act in the face of danger."
The Senate and crowded galleries
burst into loud applause.
House Speaker Joseph W. Martin,
Jr. (R„ Mass.), told reporters, "If the
Chinese Reds atacked rescue planes
there was no alternative but for the
U.S. planes to shoot. We must let
them know that, if necessary, we are
ready to protect our rights."
President Eisenhower, keeping
close tabs on the situation, had
top administration leaders to the
White House for lunch.
The attack brought U.S.-Chinese
relations to a new crisis just when
it appeared the airliner incident
was about to he smoothed over by
Red China's apology to the British.
Wilson said the attack occurred
"outside of the 12 - mile area"
which the Reds claim as territorial
waters.
The U.S. planes were Douglas AD
Skyraiders, single - engine attack
bombers based aboard the two Navy
carriers, the Hornet and the Philip
pine Sea, that were sent to the scene
when Red fighters shot down the
British airliner Friday.
They were attacked by Commu- !
nist LA-7 planes, described as low- '
wing, single-seat aircraft, one of the
Reds' faster propeller-driven fight
ers.

The Senate and crowded galleries
burst into loud applause.
House Speaker Joseph W. Martin,
Jr. (R„ Mass.), told reporters, "If the
Chinese Reds atacked rescue planes
there was no alternative but for the
U.S. planes to shoot. We must let
them know that, if necessary, we are
ready to protect our rights."
President Eisenhower, keeping
close tabs on the situation, had
top administration leaders to the
White House for lunch.
The attack brought U.S.-Chinese
relations to a new crisis just when
it appeared the airliner incident
was about to he smoothed over by
Red China's apology to the British.
Wilson said the attack occurred
"outside of the 12 - mile area"
which the Reds claim as territorial
waters.
The U.S. planes were Douglas AD
Skyraiders, single - engine attack
bombers based aboard the two Navy
carriers, the Hornet and the Philip
pine Sea, that were sent to the scene
when Red fighters shot down the
British airliner Friday.
They were attacked by Commu- !
nist LA-7 planes, described as low- '
wing, single-seat aircraft, one of the
Reds' faster propeller-driven fight
ers.
WASHINGTON, July 26 (UP) —U.S. Navy planes on a "mission
of mercy" shot down two attacking Chinese fighters last night in
a blazing air battle over the China Sea, it was disclosed today.
The Communist pilots and a Chinese gunboat crew opened fire
on the carrier-based American planes as they were searching for

survivors of a British airliner shot
clown by the Reds.
The Navy pilots did not return the
gunboat fire but they whirled into ;
the two Red planes and sent them
spinning into the ocean about 12
miles off the coast of Red-held Hai
nan Island.
There were no U.S. casualties in
the brief but sharp encounter, which i
occurred about 8 p.m. PDT, two !
days after the British airliner was
downed with the loss of three Amer
ican lives.
The incident was announced in
statements by Defense Secretary
Charles E. Wilson and Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles, who vig
orously denounced Red China's
"belligerent" action.
Diplomats here viewed the two
weekend clashes as the most seri
ous strain on U.S.-Chinese rela
tions since the end of the Korean
war.
Angry Congressional leaders ac- i
cused Red China of "piracy" in
the air and threw full hacking to
the action of the U.S. airmen.
Senate leaders—including Repub
lican William F. Knowland (Calif.)
and Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson
(Tex.) —called for national unity in
the face of "an unprovoked, warlike
attack on the United States."
Johnson declared, "This is a time
for America to unite. . . . There can
be no partisanship on such an issue.
We must resolve to be cool, decisive,
and ready to act as Americans must
always act in the face of danger."
