# 'Blend of Talents' Makes Shaw Comedy a Success
## 
### FIRST NIGHTERS 
It is a toss-up whether the credit for Wednesday's opening of
"You Never Can Tell" should go to the Stanford Players. F.
Cowles Strickland, or George Bernard Shaw.
But while there may be a question of whom to single out for
praise, there is no doubt that praise is in order. And probably the

plaudits should go to all three for an
excellent blending of talents.
The Players' performance of the
Shaw comedy was lively, entertain
ing. and well received by the audi
ence in the Little Theater.
Captivating was Eva Wald as the
impetuous Dolly Clandon. Teamed
with her twin brother Phil, played
by Phil Griffiths, she handled some
of Shaw's best comic lines and scenes j
with a pleasing sparkle. She was !
constantly the center of attraction as
she bounded about the stage regis- j
tering her reaction to the events i
with delightful facial expressions.
Griffiths was also a hit as Dolly's
partner in fun, frolic, and conspir
acy. He played his part with amus
ing seriousness.
The stage presence and timing of
William Adams as- the matchless
waiter were outstanding. He con

tributed probably the most profes- i
sionul acting job of the evening.
The wit and wisdom of Shaw were |
at their best in the lines of the young j
Dr. Valentine, performed by Ed i
Williams. His discussion of love and I
i chemical reactions in the second act J
! and his explanation of the "duel of )
1 the sexes" in the third act were high
points in the comedy.
Barbara Armstrong as the proper-
I ly brought-up. strong-willed Gloria
was an effective contrast to the col
j lection of other characters. Hers
! was the only non-comic role in the
j P^y.
In the part of Mrs. Clandon, Shaw
j provided an opportunity for a fine
i character portrayal, but Harriet i
Ketchum seemed to be reciting her
; lines instead of dominating the
| stage.
Walter Krumm was funny at
times, but he seemed stiff and un- j
convincing as the crotchety Mr.
Crampton. Max Whittaker, the so- !
licitor, was good when he wasn't
over-acting.
Charles Lown. although he had
the fewest lines of any of the prin- j
cipals. will be well remembered for j
his mastery of the inter-family strife j
in the last act. Only he could con
trol the obstreperous twins.
The precision, the smoothness, and
the comic timing of the production
illustrate the excellent directing of
If. Cowles Strickland. He should take
u bow along with the rest of the cast.

The Stanford Players' produc
tion of "You Never Can Tell" will
continue its run tonight and to
morrow at 8:15 p.m. in the Little
Theater of Memorial Hall. There
will also he performances Wed
nesday through Saturday of next
week.
All seats are reserved. Tickets
priced at SI may be obtained at
the Memorial Hall box office be
tween 12:30 and 4:30 Monday
through Friday afternoons.
