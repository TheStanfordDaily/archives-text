## Busy Fifteen Minute Session 
### 
The Executive Committee of the j
Associated Students of Stanford
University held its weekly meeting
Wednesday night and did nothing. I
The surprising part was that Exeom
didn't try to do anything.
Jody Stevens took roll. Erland j
Heginbotham "apologetically sub- i
mitted" the minutes of the previous
meeting. Student Manager Bob Ga
ble had no report. Summer Vice- |
President Foster Keene had no re
port. There was no old business.
The only new business was intro
duced by Miss Stevens as she re
ported a Howie Rubin complaint
that the chaining off of the road by
Cubberley was a fire hazard. Sum
mer President Marsh Freeman sug
gested that Rubin contact Police
Chief Gordon Davis.
The meeting was adjourned 15 j
minutes after it began.
