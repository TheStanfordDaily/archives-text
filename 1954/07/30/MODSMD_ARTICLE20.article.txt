# Tanner to Play In All-Star Tilt
## 
### 
Ted Tanner, last year's varsity
center, has been named to a vacancy
in the college roster for the AU-
Star game against the Detroit Lions
in Chicago next month.
Tanner was one of the main links
in the passing cup set up to protect
the passing of Bobby Garrett. Gar
rett will also be on hand to spark
the collegians' attack.
