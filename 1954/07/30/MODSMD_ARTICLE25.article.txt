## 
### 
PARIS, July 29 (UP)—Fashion
King Christian Dior gave the male
population of the world another jolt
by deflating the womanly bosom.
The man who irked males when
he covered up female legs in his
post-war "new look" came out to
day with a flat-chested look in his
new season clothes.
It promised to shake the "falsie"
market and make such shapely lu
minaries as Marilyn Monroe and
Jane Russell out of style—Dior style,
that is.
Dior did throw one bone to the
wolves, however, by shifting the
spotlight to the hips—which flare out
in supreme feminine triumph.
The Dior collection, traditional
high point of the Paris showinfs,
bore the official label, "The Hipfy
Silhouette."
Basically the collection called fsr
a spinsterish bust and almost prud
ishly high neckline atop luxurious
billowing hips.
"This is just an evolution, not ja
revolution," Dior said plaintively.

Asked what generously favored
women are supposed to do to look
"Dior-chic," the master admitted he
is calling a conference of all his
aides tomorrow to find the answer.
His new autumn line was an exact
reverse of his 1953 "tulip" style
which pointed all attention on mi
lady's upper-works.
