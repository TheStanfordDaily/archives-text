# McCarthy Debate Set For Today
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. July 29 (UP) â€”
Senate Republican Leader William
F. Knowland (Calif.) abruptly
switched signals today and cleared
the way for a full-dress debate on
Sen. Ralph E. Flanders' censure mo
tion against Sen. Joseph R. McCar
thy.
In another development, the Sen
ate Democratic Policy Committee
decided aaginst taking a party stand
on the issue. It said the question
"is a matter of conscience upon
which each individual Senator
should vote his convictions without
regard to policy affiliation."
Meantime, Senator H. Alexander
Smith (R., N.J.) said he would try
to pigeonhole the Flanders proposal
tomorrow in favor of a bipartisan
commission headed by Vice-Presi
dent Richard M. Nixon to investigate
"so-called McCarthyism."
Smith, who said the idea came to
him when he suddenly awoke at 5
p.m., told reporters it would permit
the question to be handled in a "ju
dicial way" and not on the basis of
"preconceived prejudices." He said
Nixon is the "ideal" man for the
job because "everybody trusts him."
Knowland's announcement was
something of a surprise. He had in
dicated previously he would offer
a non-debatable motion to "table,"
or kill, Flanders' resolution when
the 73-year-old Vermont Republi
can forces a showdown tomorrow.
Asked why he changed his mind,
Knowland said Flanders and some
other McCarthy foes "seem to be
giving the inference that some of the
Senate didn't want to stand up and
be counted."
"We're going to give a demonstra
tion that no one in the Senate is ob
jecting to a decision and casting a
vote," he said.
Knowland predicted "a rather full
discussion, Friday and maybe Sat
urday and perhaps Monday."
