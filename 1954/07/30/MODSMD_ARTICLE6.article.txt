WASHINGTON, July 29 (UP) —Communist China has rejected
American protests against Red plane attacks with a diplomatic
slap-in-the-face that sent official U.S. anger soaring.
The State Department disclosed today that the Peiping govern
ment not only spurned two U.S. protests, but returned the actual
notes —an unusually brusgue action viewed here as a deliberate

insult. "▼
State Department Press Officer
Henry Suydam. who announced the
Chinese action, said the issue "will
not be permitted to rest there."
He refused to predict future U.S.
action. One possibility would be to
fire further angry notes via the Brit
ish, through whom the two previous
notes were sent. This country has no
diplomatic relations with Red China.
While the Chinese rejection was
not unexpected, the manner of the
rejection increased U.S. anger which
already had expressed itself in con- i
demning the Red plane attack on a \
British airliner as "barbarous" and
"criminal."
Meantime, the "Voice of America" j
said it was "difficult to conclude" I
that the attack on the airliner, in
which 10 persons, including three j
Americans, lost their lives, was "an
! accident."
The "voice" jibed at the Reds for !
"so loudly proclaiming" their peace
fulness after the Indochina armis
tice, and said "this is a queer way
of celebrating."
". . . If Peiping is out to intimi
date the British and Americans, it
has failed," the government's radio j
propaganda voice added.
The United States sent Red China
two protest notes through the Brit
ish. One objected to the "barbarous"
; shooting down of the British plane,
i The other protested the Red at
j tack on American rescue planes j
looking for survivors of the airliner, j
The U.S. fighters shot down two i
j Red attackers.
Peiping in turn angrily protested
j the shooting and warned the United
| States it would "suffer the conse- i
quences" of any more such actions. I
Red China, which is not a member j
of the United Nations, cabled a pro
| test to the U.N. today against the t
American action.
