# IN CINEMASCOPE, TOO
## 'Garden of Evil' Drags Audience for a Long Ride 
### BILL WRIGHT 
"Garden of Evil." now at the Stanford, is making its first swing
around the local theater circuit, and I am just afraid that it isn't the
last we'll see of the film.
This is the kind of movie that sarcastically critical movie re
viewers relish; they can talk about the beautiful scenery with com-

plete disregard of plot and acting.
And if you see "Garden of Evil,"
you'll lie awfully glad it's done in
CinemaScope, allowing more of the
rugged Mexican country to be vis-

ible behind the ac
tors.
Among the cast
is Richard Wid
ni.nk, playing a
typical Richard
Widmurk role. He
is a sarcastic, sar-

donic gambler, and he's awfully
pleased with the fact that he knows
all there is to know.
Gary Cooper is a know-it-all. too;
but as the father-philosopher for the
whole cast, he doesn't say much
about what he knows. None the less,

| you can tell that he does know.
As the movie progresses (and I
! use the term loosely) Cooper turns
out to be a really outstanding all -
i around man. He goes unarmed after
j a crazed gunman. He picks off In
dians, .shooting his rifle with one
arm while riding in the other direc
j tion. He fixes a broken leg. He
j speaks Spanish. He clips a gal on
[ the chin with a hefty right uppercut.
And he tucks just about everybody
| in the cast into bed at night.
Also featured is Susan Hayward,
who is extra - slinky with a six
shooter strapped to her hip.
The dialogue is the film's best as
pect. There's a laugh in every line,
j although most of them aren't sup
; posed to be there. However, you
! are not laughing at the lines them
selves; you are laughing at the peo
ple (directors, producers, actors)
who expect you to take the whole
thing seriously.
The first half of the picure is the
story of a long horseback ride up
a mountain. The second half is the
[ story of the ride back down. The
latter trip is more interesting thanks
to the arrival of some bloodthirsty
Indians. That is about all that can
j be said for the plot.
When it is all over and four people
have died with arrows inserted at
various angles, you just wish that
you had remained in the sleepy sa
loon at the foot of the mountains
i with Rita Moreno.
