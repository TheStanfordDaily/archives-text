HOLLYWOOD, Aug. 2 (UP) â€”
j Crooner Dick Haymes was ordered
deported today by Immigration
I Service Special Inquiry Officer
| Ralph Farb on grounds he was an
j alien ineligible for citizenship.
Farb upheld the government's
| claim that Haymes, husband of film
| star Pita Hayworth, should be de
! ported because he left continental
United States without permission
1 and was ineligible for citizenship on
I grounds he had claimed draft ex
| emption as an alien.
Attorneys for the crooner had the
j case reopened on the grounds that
i Haymes was entrapped by Immigra-
I tion Officer Herman Landon.
