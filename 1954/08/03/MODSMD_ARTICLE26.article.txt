## SRI Says Sun Causes Smog Formation 
### 
Unusual reactions of gaseous
chemical substances in the presence
of sunlight produce most ot' the un
desirable characteristics of Los An
geles smog, according to a report of
the Stanford Research Institute re
leased last week.
The 134-page report, which is a
result of six years of study, indi
cates that the stagnant condition of
th< air over such large metropolitan
areas as Los Angeles with its many
industrial, commercial, and domes
tic activities allows time for the or
dinarily harmless chemicals emitted
to react with one another.
The sun is apparently the "motor
element" which drives the chemical
reaction, producing an atmosphere
â– with unusual chemical activity.
Strong and enduring sunlight is
also a critical factor in the produc
tion of "parent" substances respon
sible for smog conditions, the SRI
report states.

Most of the chemical activity of
the air is due to the presence of
large amounts of ozone produced in
the atmosphere. Ozone has been re
ported previously to be a chief vil
lain in the Los Angeles smog prob
lem.
In most areas of the world where
ozone measurements have been
made, levels have been found to
vary between one and six parts per
100 million parts of air. In Los An
geles, 30 to 40 parts per 100 mil
lion parts of air are commonly
reached during smog attacks and as
much as 80 parts per 100 million has
been measured.
The SRI report says there has
been general agreement among sci
entific interests that most of the
oxidant in the Los Angeles atmos
phere is ozone and that the ozone
concentration correlates with mani
festations of smog such as reduced
visibility, eye irritation, and dam

age to vegetation.
Ozone concentrations are at pres
ent the best measurements of smog
intensity in Los Angeles.
The report indicates that the Los
Angeles atmosphere contains within
itself a potential for the formation
of .smog both day and night. The
actual formation proceeds when suf
ficient sunlight is available and the
air is calm. The formation usually
occurs just after sunrise.
The SRI also says that automobile
exhaust is the largest single source
of pollutant emitted to the air. On
a weight basis, between 7 anil 9 pel'
cent of the gas fed to the automobile
motor is emitted in the exhaust.
The brand or type of gas used ap
pears to have little effect on the
chemical composites of the exhaust.
In a special section devoted to crop
damage, the report states that no
geographical pattern of injuries
could be detected within the area.
