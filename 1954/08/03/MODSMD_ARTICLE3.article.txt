### 
Bids are due Thursday for the
three and a half million dollar men's
residence hall which will be built
east of Stern and across the street
from Branner.
Construction on the dormitory for
704 students is expected to begin
within two weeks after a bid has
been accepted.
Because the contract will allow

for occupancy until January 1956
instead of by autumn quarter 1955
as hoped earlier.
The hall will consist of a quad
rangle of eight living units, each
three stories high. The units will
be grouped around a central dining
administrative building.
The buildings will be of rein
forced concrete with gable roofs of
red tile. Floor space will total ap
proximately 216.000 square feet.
Most of the rooms will be doubles.
They will provide each student with
a wardrobe closet, chest of drawers,
desk, bookcase, and bed.
It is expected that most of the
hall's first tenants will be freshmen.
The future use of' 63-year-old En
cina has not yet been determined.
There will be lounges in each of
the eight living units, two cafeterias
and six dining rooms in the dining
bulding. and extensive recreatonal
areas with softball, volleyball, and
basketball facilities.
The resident assistants at the new
dorm will be married graduate stu
dents who will live in apartments
attached to each unit.
