give him the "right to cross-exam
ine those who made the charges."
"If they do," McCarthy said. "I
assure the American people the Sen
ators will either indict themselves
as perjurors or show what consum
mate liars they are."

McCarthy's Investigating Subcom
mittee. toid the Senate he believes
the Wisconsin Republican is "en
titled" to a fuller hearing.
"I cannot bring myself to condemn
someone until he has had a chance
to answer the charges against him."

he said.

that he felt "an issue of fact" was
raised by various amendments to
add specific charges to Flanders'
original resolution.
"It would be unthinkable for the
Senate to proceed without resolving
those facts by some appropriate
committee," he said.
George himself has been men
tioned as a possible member of the
special committee authorized by the
motion.
Flanders argued there is "no need
to have any further testimony." In
this he was backed by Sens. A. S
Mike Monroney (D., Okla.) and J,
William Fulbright (D., Ark.).
Fulbright said McCarthy has am
ple opportunity to defend himself in
the floor debate. Monroney said
Knowland's proposal would put the
