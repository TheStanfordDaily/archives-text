# China Rejects Second Protest On Shooting
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 5 (UP) —
Communist China has brusquely re
jected a second U.S. protest over
the shooting down of an unarmed
British airliner with the loss of
three American lives, the State De
partment said today.
Department spokesman Lincoln
White, who made the official an
nouncement, refused to say what
this country's next step might be in
a situation which has plunged rela
tions between the United States and
Red China to a post - Korean war
low.
But other officials said "this mat
ter is not settled." They made it
..iear the United States will take
some further action to obtain satis
faction for the "unprovoked" attack.
Possibilities appeared to include
possible seizure of any Red assets
within U.S. jurisdiction, inclusion of
U.S. demands for damages in any
British claim against the Reds, or
some action before the United Na
tions.
White disclosed that the second
protest was rejected by the Peiping
regime in the same blunt manner as
the first two U.S. notes. He said
the Reds again refused even to ac
cept the note—an action previously
termed "insulting" by diplomats.
The British Cathay Pacific airliner
was shot down over the South China
Sea July 23 while on a routine flight
from Bangkok to Hong Kong. It
crashed into the sea, killing three of
six Americans aboard and seven
other persons.
Eight survivors, including three
other Americans, were plucked from
the sea in a daring rescue by U.S.
planes.
