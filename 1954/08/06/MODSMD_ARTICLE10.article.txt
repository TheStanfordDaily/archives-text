BREMERHAVEN. Germany, Aug.
5 (UP) â€”German householders and
shipyard workers routed 100 police
! men from a community requisi
tioned by the U.S. Army today in
the biggest post - war rebellion
against the American occupation.
Housewives, some of them wield
-1 ing pitchforks, and other occupants
of 29 homes marked for replacement
with a U.S. military housing devel
opment took part in the demonstra
tion.
Five thousand employees of near
by shipwards stormed to their aid,
! and then marched to the city hall to
present the case to Mayor Gerhard
j Rumpf.
The mayor worked out an uneasy
truce ending the day's hostilities.
But it did not solve the problem, and
I left the city tense tonight. Guards
were placed at all U.S. housing proj
ects in the area, and work was
called off at those still under con
struction.
Casualties were light. A number
of women were reported injured or
overwrought and taken away in am
bulances. But hospitals reported no
one was seriously injured. Rumpf
i ?aid one policeman was beaten badly
j and several others were mauled.
