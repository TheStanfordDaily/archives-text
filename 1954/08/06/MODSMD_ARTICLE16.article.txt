# Excom Holds Last Summer Meeting
## 
### 
The Executive Committee provid
ed an indication that summer quar
ter is almost over. It held its last
meeting Wednesday night.
Student Manager Bob Gable re
ported that the summer budget of
$700 has been expended, plus or mi
nus a few dollars, without consider
ing the all-campus dance tomorrow
night at Stern. Excom hopes the
dance, which will cost the ASSU
about $200, will be self-supporting.
If the ASSU goes into the hole, the
Women's Residence Summer Club
will make up the deficit up to a
maximum of $85. That was the cost
of the second open house at Lagu
nita which the Summer Club said
earlier in the quarter that il would
sponsor if necessary.
Excom also approved a coffee hour
for Laeunita Sundav night.
