# Chappie Parodies Singled Out, Among Best of Campus Humor
## 
### 
Two Chaparral parody issues were
singled out by the current Compact
magazine ("The Young People's Di
gest") as examples of the best cam
pus humor for 1954.
Last year's "The Saturday Eve
ning Pile" had excerpts from its Let
ters to the Editors column reprinted
together with a copy of its cover.
The other Chaparral, "Lite," was
published two years ago. Compact

reprinted the cover and a burlesque*
on a Statler Hotel ad.
Other takeoffs on popular maga
zines that were praised by Compact
were Columbia University's "Lad
dies Home Journal," University of
Pennsylvania's "Modern Scream,"
and Purdue University's "Took."
Compact also ran an article on
Gary Crosby's summer radio show
and his recent record releases.
