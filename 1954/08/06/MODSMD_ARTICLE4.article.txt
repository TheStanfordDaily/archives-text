# University Asks San Mateo County to Help Build Bridge
## 
### 
Stanford, in a letter from Business
Manager Alt' E. Brandin, asked the
San Mateo County Board of Super
visors yesterday to help the Univer
sity construct a bridge ( over San
Francisquito Creek.
The proposed bridge will be part
of a road expansion program in con
junction with a $7,f)00,00l) shopping

center which will be built on the
campus.
The two-lane bridge will conduct
an extended Willow Road with Al
pine and Sand Hill Roads near the
third hole of the Stanford golf
course. The estimated cost is $88,500.
The bridge is the only part of the
road development which will be in
San Mateo County. The rest will be
in Santa Clara County.
The University plans to extend
Embarcadero Road from El Camino
behind the hospital to the creek.
The new section of Willow Road
will run from the rear of the shop
ping center, to be built near El Ca
mino and the creek, to the junction
with Sand Hill and Alpine.
Ultimate plans call for an exten
sion ol Willow across El Camino
with an expensive over-pass near
Alma Street.
The San Mateo board will consider
the request at its Aug. 17 meeting.
