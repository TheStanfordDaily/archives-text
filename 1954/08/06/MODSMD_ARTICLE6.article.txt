### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 5 (UP) —
The Air Force announced tonight it
has ordered production of America's \
first jet transport plane for use as
a flying tanker.
Air Secretary Haloid E. Talbott
said use of the plane to refuel jet
bombers in the air "will vastly in
crease the range, flexibility, and ca
pability of the Air Force's bomber j
force."
The transport is the Boeing Model
707. a swept-wing plane which cost
the firm $15,000,000 to develop.
Flying 550 miles an hour as a
transport, it could span the conti- 1
nent in less than five hours or cross
the Atlantic in seven hours.
As a tanker, the 707 would be !
used to refuel the giant new globe
girdling B-52 heavy bomber and the
medium B-47, present backbone of
i the Strategic Air Command.
