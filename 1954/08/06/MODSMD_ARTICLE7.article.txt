### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 5 (UP)â€”A "select" six-member Senate
committee was named today to investigate censure charges
against Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy and promptly spurned the Wis
consin Republican's bid for an immediate conference.
The members, appointed by Vice-President Richard M. Nixon,

are Republican Senators Arthur
V. Watkins (Utah), Frank Carlson
(Kan.), and Francis Case (S.D.) and
Democrats Edwin C. Johnson
(Colo.), John C. Stennis (Miss.), and
Sam J. Ervin (N.C.).
Three are former judges, two are
ex-Governors, and the other is a
one-time newspaper publisher.
Senate Republican Leader William
F. Knowland and Democratic Leader
Lyndon B. Johnson, who actually
selected the members, said all were
men of judicial temperament and
patriotism in whom the Senate and
nation could have confidence.
Nixon said the six were "outstand
ing in their qualifications to sit in
judgment on a fellow Senator," and
declared, "None has prejudged the
case."
Senator Ralph E. Flanders (R.,
Vt.), author of the censure move
that led to creation of the commit
tee, termed the group "excellent."
McCarthy had no immediate com
ment on his "jury of peers," but an
nounced from the Senate floor that
he wished to meet with the com
mittee "immediately, this after
noon."
He said he wanted to make sura
his Investigating Subcommittee work
doesn t conflict with the new grouj:
and to discuss "the method of proof,
the nature of proof they want."
The committee met secretly for
less than an hour in Nixon's office
off the Senate chamber. The Vice-
President was not present.
Watkins said afterward nothing
was decided except to meet again
at 11 a.m. EOT (8 a.m. PDT) to
morrow, at which time a chair
man may he chosen and the ques
tion of press coverage settled
Watkins thought reporters would
he admitted.
"We have no plans to meet with
Senator McCarthy until we are
ready to go ahead with the hear
ings," Watkins said.
Watkins said it had not been de
cided whether McCarthy will be al
lowed to cross-examine witnesses
against him, a privilege the Wis
consin Senator has demanded.
