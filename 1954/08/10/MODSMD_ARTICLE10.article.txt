# The
						End Is Near
## 
### 
This is the first summer, and probably the last, we have spent on
the Farm. We have been to watermelon fi-asts, beach parties, open
houses, receptions (a day ahead of time), Excom meetings, and
even classes and the Library. Now as we shed sorrowful crocodile
tears we realize that the end is near. Yes, with finals starting Fri
day morning, the end is very near.
But actually it was a good summer. Going to school is so much
easier than looking for a job. We had some fun with The Daily, too.
However, it will be no strain at all to step down to the sports staff
where life is so much more restful and let Miss Patricia King sit
behind the big desk in the fall.
We liave tried not to bore you too often in this space—at least
not with editorials. But before we slip the covers on the type
writers for the last time this summer, we want to extend special
plaudits to a couple of*"unsung heroes."
First prize goes to the ASSU's invaluable Jody Stevens. Jody,
the undergraduate women's representative, was secretary of Ex
com. She was in charge of the symphony concert and the recep
tion at the beginning of the quarter. In addition she assisted with
practically every other ASSU and Lagunita function of the quarter.
Whenever we needed information from Lag or the ASSU, we could
count on Jody to help us out.
Our own special thanks go to Ed Small for working with us in
the Shack this summer. Ed isn't a regular Daily staffer, but none
the less he was here almost every publication day and helped
immeasurably.
There is just one more thing. Summer quarter attracts a woeful
minority of undergraduates to the campus. For a better all-around
summer program, we suggest that the University make a greater
effort to enroll undergraduates. A 5250 tuition fee is not the
needed inducement.
Good luck with finals.
