NEW YORK. Aug. 9 (UP) -The
Girl Scouts of America flatly denied
today American Legion charges of
vill - American tendencies but said
they would appease complainers by
restoring to the official handbook a
picture of the Bill of Rights that was
dropped because it was almost un- J
readable.
The organization said it also I
planned to drop a comparison of the
United Nations Universal Declara
tion of Human Rights to the Ameri
can Declaration of Independence to
satisfy persons who charged the |
Scouts with "one-world" bias.
Mrs. Roy F. Layton, national pres- j
ident of the Girl Scouts, issued a 1
statement containing a blanket de- .
nial that her organization was or i
ever had been un-American in its

12 years of existence.
The Legionnaires charged the Girl
Scouts published the writings of
"certain pro - Communist authors,"
stressed United Nations and one
world citizenship over American cit
izenship, and eliminated patriotic
materal, including the Bill of Rights,
from the handbook.
A spokesman for the Girl Scouts
said the chief complaint apparently
involved the Bill of Rights, which is
contained in the first 10 amendments
to the Constitution. For years, she
said, the handbook included a pho
tograph of the amendments in writ
ing so small it strained Scouts' eyes
to read.
Leaders said the girls generally
used more readable copies than the
one in the handbook. To put the
space to better use, the spokesman
said, the photograph was dropped
from the handbook.
