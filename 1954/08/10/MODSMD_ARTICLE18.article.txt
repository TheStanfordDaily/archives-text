The Wednesday Matinee Scries of
| the Speech and Drama Department
I will conclude its summer season
I with a program of two one-act com
edies at 4:15 p.m. in the Little The
j ater of Memorial Hall.
Ben Etheridge is directing "Dear
j Departed" by Stanley Houghton,
j which takes place in the living room
of a lower-middle class family in a
! provincial English town when rela
tives arrive to collect their expected
inheritance left by the "dear de
parted."
Members of the cast are Lau-Â»
ren Keys, Walter Krumm, Dorothy
Lindsey, Leonard Love, Robert Kee
ly, and Nancy Widdas.
In "The Lost Silk Hat" by Lord
Dunsany, the author humorously
contrasts the somewhat effete male
of modern society with the dashing,
j fearlessly noble heroes of romance.
This comery-vignette is directed
I by Thomas Bower who also appears
! in the cast which includes Eugene
; Peyroux, Kenneth Walters, John
! Gibson, and Kenneth Kiley.
The Wednesday Matinee Series
will be continued with the opening
! of the University in the fall.
