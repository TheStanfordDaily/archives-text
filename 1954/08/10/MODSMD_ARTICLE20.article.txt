Perhaps it is ton bad that All-American Bobby Garrett, Stanford's
greatest passer, has left the powerful Cleveland Browns for the lowly
Green Bay Packers. With Cleveland headman Paul E. Brown and All-Pro
quarterback Otto Graham as instructors and the talented Browns as team
mates, Garrett couldn't have picked a better springboard to professional
fame.
But last week's trade was a good one for both teams. Garrett's military
duties didn't fit in with the Browns' quarterback needs. Instead Cleveland
now has experienced Babe Parilli who will be available in 1955 if Graham
and George Rattcrman call it quits at the end of this season.
For Garrett himself, the trade has its advantages along with its disad
vantages He will have a much better chance of breaking into the Packer

starting eleven than he would have
had at Cleveland. Green Bay will j
certainly be glad to have Garrett's
aerial punch. But they don't have as
much money to offer as Paul E.
Brown. Not by a long shot.

Don't be surprised if Garrett fails
to steal the show in the College All-
Star game Friday night the way he
did in the East-West Shrine classic
last December.
He isn't too much of a runner and j
thus doesn't fill the requirements of
the split-T attack which head coach
Jim Tatum will employ. Zeke Brat
kowski of Georgia will probably get
the starting nod against the Detroit
Lions in the Chicago game. Maybe
lino coach Chuck Taylor will see to
it that Bobby gets a little action.
That game will be televised locally
on channel 5 Friday at 6:30 p.m.

I hope none of you track fans j
missed the TV showing of the "mil - j
acle mile" between Britain's ' Jolly

Roger" Bannister and John Landy, the Aussie butterfly chaser. They say
it was the greatest mile race of all time. ,
I couldn't say for sure myself, not having seen very many great milers.
I have seen Wes Santee in a 4:00.7 effort last June and Gil Dodds, the
Flying Parson, setting the old indoor record in the Garden a few years
back with nothing but the stopwatch as competition.
But Bannister and Landy put on a better show than those other two
races put together. Their times alone were enough to make it a great race;
Bannister surged through the tape in 3:58.8 with Landy striding evenly
four yards back in 3:59.6. That's fast, brother.
Two things impressed me about the race: Landy's unbelievably fast and
seemingly tireless "cruising speed," and Bannister's tremendous strides as
he closed the gap and took the lead as they turned for home.

By chance I noticed a United Press story Friday night from LaGrange,
111., breaking the news that a 16-year-old gal from Everett, Wash., had won
the Women's Western Junior Golf Tournament.
The interesting thing is that Ann Quast intends to enroll at Stanford in
the fall. More interesting is the fact that her name appears on the list ot
freshmen who have been accepted for admittance.
The metropolitan press is constantly announcing that this prep star and
that prep star are headed for the Farm. Most of them are never admitted.
However, a number of last year's footballers are on the list of potential
Stanfordites. The list includes Dick Elliott of Antioch, Noel Robinson ot
San Francisco, Russ Steele of Concord, Joel Fries of Los Angeles, and
Andrew Reed of Pasadena.
But I won't count on seeing them in uniform until I see them in the
Bookstore line.
