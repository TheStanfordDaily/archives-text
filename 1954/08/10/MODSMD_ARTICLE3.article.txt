# Farm Support Bill Approved
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Aug. 9 (UP) —
The Senate handed President Eisen
hower a legislative victory tonight
by approving a system of flexible
farm price supports ranging from
82V2 to 90 per cent of the "fair" par
ity price.
The roll call vote was 49 to 44.
In its vote on the politically ex
plosive issue, the Senate adopted the
compromise formula passed by the
House several weeks ago.
Just before the crucial ballot, the
Senate voted 81 to 12 to reject an
amendment by Senator Joseph R.
McCarthy (R., Wis.) to fix supports
at from 90 to 100 per cent of parity.
The outcome was a stinging defeat
for the Senate farm bloc which
fought to the end to maintain the
present system of rigid 90 per cent
supports for wheat, cotton, corn,
rice, and peanuts.
Meanwhile, the Senate Judiciary
Committee narrowly defeated an at
tempt to kill the administration's bill
to authorize the use of wire-tap evi
dence to prosecute spies and traitors.
The 7-7 vote by which the com
mitte reversed an earlier tentative
decision to table the bill indefinitely
was reported to be along straight
party lines. Chairman William E.
Langer (R„ N.D.) voted "present."
The final vote left the bill still
pending before the committee. An
other vote will be required to send
it to the Senate.
The decision narrowly averted a
severe blow to President Eisen
hower's anti-subversive program.
Originally the committee voted
6-5 to table the bill. But Langer,
two other Republicans and one
Democrat were absent and were al
lowed until 6 p.m. EDT to cast their
votes.
No breakdown on the final vote
was released.
