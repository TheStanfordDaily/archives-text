# McCarthy Allowed Cross-Examination; Committee Will Insist on 'Court Rules'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 9 (UP) — The special Senate committee
studying censure charges against Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (R.,
Wis.) voted today to permit McCarthy to cross-examine witnesses
at public hearings beginning Aug. 30.
Chairman Arthur V. -Watkins (R., Utah) said after a 3'/2-hour

secret meeting that the six-man bi
partisan committee will insist on
court rules. He said this means evi
dence and cross-examination must
be material, relevant, and compe
tent.
Watkins said it is "conceivable"
that such cross-examination might
stretch into something like the 13
days Army Secretary Robert T. Ste
vens was questioned at the recent
televised Army-McCarthy hearings.
But he said this would be "highly
unlikely" under the strict judicial
rules to be followed. He said the
cross-examination may be conduct
ed either by the Wisconsin Repub
lican or his attorney, but not both.
Watkins said no witnesses will be
called unless they have personal
knowledge of any of the charges
filed against McCarthy by Senators
J. William Fulbright (D., Ark.),
Wayne L. Morse (Ind., Ore.), and
Ralph E. Flanders (R., Vt.), who in
troduced the original censure mo
tion.
The chairman said this makes it
unlikely that Fulbright, Morse, or
Flanders will be asked to testify be
cause they are "not plaintiffs or
participants." McCarthy has de
manded the right to question them
but Watkins said the committee did
not vote today on this issue.
Watkins said the fact that Flan
ders, Fulbright, and Morse would
not be called as witnesses and are
not "principals" in the case would
rule out their right to cross-examine
witnesses. None of the three had
demanded such a right.
Watkins said the group studied
"all the charges" against McCarthy
but will not announce which ones
will be thrown out until the hear
ings start.
Watkins said the questioning of
witnesses will be conducted by
members of the committee, rather
than the hired counsel.
