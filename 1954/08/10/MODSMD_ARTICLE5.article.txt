WASHINGTON, Aug. 9 UP) —
High-ranking U.S. officials said to
day two letters written by Dr. Otto
John to his wife indicate he was
"lured" into Communist hands and
did not leave the West voluntarily.
Government sources, who made
the letters available to the United
Press, said they are convinced the
West German security chief is being
held in East Germany against his
will despite Communist trumpeting
that he does not want to return.
After reading the letters, U.S. of
ficials said positively: "There is no
question about it—he was lured!"
The first letter, postmarked three
days after John disappeared into
East Berlin July 20, apparently was
written in great haste on a rough
piece of paper.
