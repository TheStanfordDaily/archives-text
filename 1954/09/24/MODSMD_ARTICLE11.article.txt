[ hope that by now, the second
day of your pre-registration, you
fire beginning to feel at home at
Stanford. Let me say again our
welcome is most sincere.
You will hear much of the fact
that you have extensive freedom
here: freedom to seize opportu
nities and freedom to make mis
takes. Your main job at Stanford
will be to capitalize the oppor
tunities and minimize the mis
takes.
To achieve this you must take
some initiative. I urge you to get
to know your professors as well
as you can and to take seriously
my sincere invitation to visit me
at my home or my office.
These are days of exciting prog
revs at Stanford and 1 am glad
you are here to share them with
u . Best of luck to all of you.
J. E. WALLACE STERLING

I am giad to extend this wel
come to the Class of '58.
You are coming to Stanford at
an exciting time in the Univer
sity's physical and academic de
velopment. During your student
days here, you will see fruits of
the efforts of Stanford genera
tions who have preceded you, and
the results of plans which have
been years in the making. This
will challenge you to write the
record of your class prominently
in Stanford history now being
Hiade.
I know something about the
capacities and past, achievements
of individuals in your class. I
also know that, in gaining admis
sion, you survived a rigorous
competition. Unquestionably, the
Class of '58 can become one of
Stanford's great classes.

A "highly select" group ol
freshmen, (according to Dean
of Students H. Donald Win
bigler), arrived at Stanford yes
terday to begin a packed pre
registration and orientation
schedule.
One hundred and fifty upper
classmen cut short their vacations to
welcome the Class of '58 with an
introduction to campus life. Din
ners, dances, assemblies, tours of the
campus, and academic counseling
sessions have been planned by this
year's Pre-registration Committee.
Approximately 800 men and iOO
women will join the Stanford fam
ily, which, including all registered
students, is expected to reach a total
of 7,450 members, according to Reg
istrar Harvey Hall. This total, which
exceeds last fall's by about 125, is
made up of 5,400 men and 2,050
women students, a ratio of about
2.(i men per woman.
Approximately 337 of the freshman
class intend to major in the humani
ties. Numbers of students planning
other majors are as follows: engi
neering, 208; sciences, 138; pre-med,
122; pre - legal, 77; education, 69.
business, 46; mineral sciences. 22;
and prc-nursing, 4. One hundred
and seventy - seven students have
not yet chosen majors.
Representatives of 36 states are
included in the Class of '58, as well
as students from several foreign
countries and possessions. The ma
jority of new students, 782, come
from California, with Los Angeles
County contributing the largest sin
gle group of 238. Three hundred
ninety come from other states of the
Union, and 29 come from foreign
countries and U.S. possessions.
Registration will take place Mon
day and Tuesday, with classes be
ginning Wednesday.
A change in registration proce
dure has b»en announced, which will
eliminate the need for student;, to
file their study lists on registration
day. The new method is as follows:
When the student has filled in his
registration book, he will turn it in
at the signout desk, where the clerk
will hand back to him his study list,
enclosed in an envelope.
The student will be given an in
dividual course card by the instruc
tor for every course that is being
taken for credit. These course cards
will be placed in the envelope with
the study list.
If the student wishes to change a
course during the first three week-,
he need only have his adviser ap
prove the change by initialing the
study list, and return or obtain in
dividual course cards from instruc
tors whose courses are dropped or
added.
The student may turn in the en
velope containing study list and in-
Hividual class cards any time after
his first day of classes and no later
than the second Friday of the quar
ter. Late fees will be assessed for
cards turned in after this date.
This revised procedure has been
adopted, according to Registrar Hall,
for three reasons:
1. To bring about increased effi
ciency in the Registrar's office.
2. To simplify the change of
program procedure during tfic
first two weeks.
3. To place in the student's
hands more completely the respon
sibility for the correctness of his
program.
Students in charge of welcoming
he frosh to Stanford are Creswell
Cole and Jean Lenzen, chairmen of
the pre-registration program; Bruce
VlcNaughton, chairman of the pro
gram for transfer students; and
3rice Wightman, chairman of ar
rangements for new graduate stu
lents and foreign students.
