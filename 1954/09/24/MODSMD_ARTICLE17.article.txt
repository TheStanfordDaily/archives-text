This is it. This is the goal toward which you
aimed your high school studies. This is the
opportunity you hoped for as you dogged the
mailman's footsteps last spring. This is the day
you have planned for all summer—your first
full day as a Stanford student.
This is the day, also, on which we want to
do more than add our sincere "welcome" to
the chorus of hellos you have already received.
We want to repeat, for your serious consider
ation, the guestion which several of you were
asked as you arrived yesterday—"What do
you expect to gain from four years at Stan

in the future.
And what does .ill this have to do with you,
a freshman, a member of the Class of 1358?
Everything. On you depends the continued
success of all that has been established' in the
past, of all thai is being planned for tomorrow.

you will be asked to contribute to Stanford.
You v/ill be called upon for ideas, for time, for
physical energy.
What you gain from your four years'at Stan

your leadership.
