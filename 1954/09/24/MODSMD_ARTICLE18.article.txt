feeble fabi.es
Tragic the tale of Flash Cooley, who came to Stan
ford a serious-minded child determined to love his
professors and get straight A. Flash hit the hooks;:
All through the fall quarter he slaved with his nose
in a book and a pencil and notebook at. hand. His
notes on Burns were an expansion of the text. He
• ;iI in the front row at Biology lecture with his chin
on the edge of the stage. He even took notes in
liOTc.

Flash Cooley come to a hoV
i ible end. He neither ate nor slept,
and when his resistance was down
to nothing he succumbed to an
attack of the loathsome tse-ts(f„#
lly and missed all his finals. He
went so far minus that the dean
threw in a lew extra points so
Flash could set a new record. As
.1 scholar Flash was through; he
had to transfer to California and
[/lay football.

Also tragic the tale of Percival Penster, who came
to Stanford freed of the bondage of life at home and
determined to live if up. Percy spent his nights
partying with the boys and girls, and slept through
all his classes by day. He bought a fast convertible
with the money his father gave him for books
'.■.■ hat he did v/itli his clothe: allowance put every night

spot on the Penin ula hack on ii• fe< I. P< i rival Pen ter
got his kicks.
And the last kick Percival Pen. ter go I. administer! d
by the dean, carried him eh ar back to Saint Louis.
And the moral of the lory: i it that \\< nnisf not
go to extrt me;;. <! ar kiddie . I ,iii~Talh< . •. t'T i\ • lor a
wholesome balance?
No.
Farley <«in:;i strove fur a vvlmlesome balance and

after the Oregon State game and was never seen
again.
In summary: Fla h Cooley was dot Tmined to meta
morphi'e himself into a bookworm; Percival Pensler
gave his all for popularity or nothing: Farley (.Jimp
tried going both ways. In a way. they all succeeded.
Flash crawled out of the picture, Percy got nothing,
and Farley ('.Jimp had hi. 1 fling at shed ling a lovely
light.
And you, too, can get what you want at Stanford, il
you know for sure what il is you want. The Campus
has file hails of learning and El Caiviino lur the recre
ational facilities. Plenty of diversions, eurricular and
extra-curricular. The difficult part is deciding what,
it is you really want from Stanford.
As the man says, Class ni 1958, Stanford is yours!
