# Stanford ROTC's Offer Opportunities For Reserve Military Commissions
## 
### DICK MANSFIELD Associate Editor, The Daily 
Rese. ve Officers Training
Corps represented in ail three
major branches of America's
armed services offers Stanford
men training in leadership at
war and in peace and a chance
for a commission on the services
of their choice.
The Aii Force ROTC offers re
serve commissions to qualified stu
dents in initial assignment and duty
classification chosen to accord with
die:r ma or fields of concentration at
Sta'ni'pi d.
The Navy ROTC gives students
the option of Navy or Marine Corps
reserve.' cornmi: sions as the possible
result. of successful completion of
the Naval Science curriculum.
Succes ful e o m p 1 e t i on of the
Army ROTC's General Military Sci
ence curriculum may lead to a cotn
mi-sion as second lieutenant in the
United States Army Reserve.
Training in all three branches is

of a general nature, with more spe
cific instruction to follow commission
and assignment. Subjects covered
aim primarily at developing leader
ship and coveimg certain funda
mentals of procedure in the various
branches. Some history and theory j
is presented.
Ail ROTC programs at Stanford
and el-ewhere involve 12 quarters of I
classroom work and drill and one j
summer camp or cruise. Army and
Air Force ROTC devotes two hours
a week to classroom work through
the first two years of the course, |
four hours a week through the last j
two years. One hour of drill a week !
is held throughout the program. !
Navy ROTC involves three hours of ;
class and two drill sessions a week j
each quarter.
Army and Air Force ROTC pro- j
grams are divided into basic and ad
vanced courses of two years each,
with admission to the advanced
course contingent on performance in
the basic course. On admission to j
the advanced course students are |
paid $27 per monlh during the .school j
year.

Navy ROTC students enter into a
contract with the Navy for comple
tion of 12 quarters of work. On be
ginning their third year, student,; in
the Naval Science program are paid
the same scale as Army and Air
j ROTC advanced students.
All ROTC programs provide all
textbooks for ROTC courses as we!)
las uniforms, which normally arv
j worn only for drill.
Summer camp, generally between
junior and senior years, lasts four
weeks for Air Force candidates, six
| weeks in Navy and Army pro
! grams. Pay for summer camp ses
i dons is $78 per month plus board,
J clothing, and a travel allowance to
I and from camp which, for instance,
| is 5 cents per mile in Army ROTC.
All ROTC programs offer defer
' ment from the draft, the condition
being that the student must agree to
try for completion of the entire
four-year course. Students leaving
the ROTC program before complet
| ing the course are again subject to
| the draft.
The University gives one unit per
! hour credit for classroom work in
ROTC. ROTC drill, if taken for six
| quarters, satisfies the University's
j lower division physical education
j requirement.
Candidates contemplating career
| work in any branch of the armed
: services may apply for regular com
missions after receiving their re
t serve commissions, subject to ccr
| tain conditions.
Although all ROTC branches pre
fer to enroll applicants during their
freshmah year, applicants from other
classes will be conisdered, if they
plan to remain at Stanford, engaged
in a normal course of stujjy, long
enough to complete the ROTC pro
gram. Thus the last year in which
any applicant may successfully
apply for ROTC depends on the
I amount of graduate work which he
contemplates doing.
ROTC courses are not offered dur
ing the summer quarter at Stanford.
