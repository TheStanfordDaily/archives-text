THE QUAD —The tile-roofed buildings above house the class
rooms which make up the well-known Stanford Quad. Inner
Quad and Memorial Church are shown in the center of the
photo. The flat-topped building at the upper right is the new
Microwave Lab. Roble and Lagunita are in the upper left
corner. Left foreground is the walk between Quad and the
Main Libe (see opposite page); in the background rise Stan

ford's rolling foothills and the Coast Range. This view looks
o rc-ctly west across the campus from the top of Hoover Tower
page). Expansion of the campus has forced some classes
cut o f the original guadrangle plan into buildings at upper left
of photo and elsewhere; but the Quad remains the center of
academic activities at Stanford.
