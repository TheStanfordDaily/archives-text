CIV LIBE —The Civ Libe houses the large collection of reference materials used in the History
of Western Civilization course. The Civ Libe is located in the temporary buildings behind
Cubberley Auditorium and the Main Library. The library is used largely by freshmen students.
All books and pamphlets needed in the Western Civ course are on the shelves. Since all ma
terials are on "reserve," however, they may be checked out for only short periods of time. All
Western Civ materials must be checked out at the circulation desk, and may be taken from
the Libe only if checked out for over-night reading. All books must be returned before 8 a.m.
the day after they are checked out.

torium and Hoover Tower. Tours of the Library will be held from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday and
from 9 a.m. to 2:3 C p.m. on Tuesday. Students will be shown through the "stacks," the reference
room, the reserved book room, and other parts of the Main Libe In addition to the usual library
functions of Supplying books and other study materials, the Stanford Main Library sponsors film
and lecture series and features displays of art and literature of special note. Alpha Phi Omega's
book exchange is located at the rear of the main floor. The library has a record listening room
for music course materials and its document library receives new documents daily from all
over the world. Stanford Libraries plan a complete rebuilding of the library with attendant re
vamping of procedure in the near future.
