# Taylor Picks Tribe to Beat Oregon In PCC Opener Tomorrow at Portland
## 
### DON WEBSTER Sports Editor, the Daily 
Chuck Taylor's S t a nt or d
eleven, regaining confidence
after last week's shaky win over
COP, travel to Portland this aft
ernoon to face a highly touted
Oregon football team tomorrow
night in Multnomah Stadium.
Though the Cards didn t look too
good last weekend, the coaches re
member that Stanford has in the
past been a slow starter. La; 112 year,
for instance, they were upset by the
Tigers, 25-0, in their opener. Later
in the season, a much-improved*ln
dian team missed going to the Rose
Bowl by a single point. Included in
tiie wins was a 54-0 decision over
San Jose State, a team that was able
to defeat COP.
Three years ago Stanford opened
their season with an unsure 27-20
win over Oregon. They improved
enough to go to the Rose Bowl.
Taylor's mentors were heartened
by the fact that last week's defi
ciencies were mechanical, not phys
ical. That means that if the mechan
ical faults are collected, Stanford
could have an outstanding team; hud
they been due to lack of competent
personnel, there would have been
no hope.
Oregon has an outstanding hall
clyh, headed by quarterback
(jeorgc Shaw. Ho can do every
thing— pass, run, and kick. Last
week, when the Ducks trounced

Idaho, 41-11, Shatv was benched
much of (lit- time so the second
stilus could play, imi (lie Indian
team knows his potential.
Oilier outstanding Oregon players
are eenter and captain Hon Phei.ster,
right guard Jack Patera, and end Hal
Reeve.
This will be only the third night
game in Stanford's history. The first
was against UCLA in 19M0, the sec
ond last week. Oregon will he
sporting new green-and-gold uni-

forms, the gold satin part of which
"shines like a boy's new watch"
under the lights, Oregon officials
claim.
Stanford coaches who scouted
the Idaho game say that despite
the big score the Ducks are vul
nerable. Their linebacking is
weak, it is said, and several of
tilil* linemen besides , Kecve.
I'heistcr, and I'aiera are somfwhat
below par .Their best runner is
halfback Dick James.
They are also handicapped by the
loss of lirst-string fullback Jasper
McGee. who will be sidelined with
an injury.
Taylor was very disappointed with

the practice session yesterday. He
plans a night workout at the Sta
dium when the team arrives tonight.

tiie wins was a 54-0 decision over
San Jose State, a team that was able
to defeat COP.
Three years ago Stanford opened
their season with an unsure 27-20
win over Oregon. They improved
enough to go to the Rose Bowl.
Taylor's mentors were heartened
by the fact that last week's defi
ciencies were mechanical, not phys
ical. That means that if the mechan
ical faults are collected, Stanford
could have an outstanding team; hud
they been due to lack of competent
personnel, there would have been
no hope.
Oregon has an outstanding hall
clyh, headed by quarterback
(jeorgc Shaw. Ho can do every
thing— pass, run, and kick. Last
week, when the Ducks trounced

Idaho, 41-11, Shatv was benched
much of (lit- time so the second
stilus could play, imi (lie Indian
team knows his potential.
Oilier outstanding Oregon players
are eenter and captain Hon Phei.ster,
right guard Jack Patera, and end Hal
Reeve.
This will be only the third night
game in Stanford's history. The first
was against UCLA in 19M0, the sec
ond last week. Oregon will he
sporting new green-and-gold uni-

forms, the gold satin part of which
"shines like a boy's new watch"
under the lights, Oregon officials
claim.
Stanford coaches who scouted
the Idaho game say that despite
the big score the Ducks are vul
nerable. Their linebacking is
weak, it is said, and several of
tilil* linemen besides , Kecve.
I'heistcr, and I'aiera are somfwhat
below par .Their best runner is
halfback Dick James.
They are also handicapped by the
loss of lirst-string fullback Jasper
McGee. who will be sidelined with
an injury.
Taylor was very disappointed with

the practice session yesterday. He
plans a night workout at the Sta
dium when the team arrives tonight.
