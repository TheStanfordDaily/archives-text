# Card Gridders Top COP, 13-12
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
In a defensive football game—which is another way of saying
neither offense looked very good—Stanford's footballers were
unable to score more touchdowns than their host, College of
Pacific, at Pacific Memorial Stadium last Friday night.
They won the game, 13-12, on the basis ol the only conversion

1 con d in the game—a bootleg by"
-ophomore quarterback 'John Bro
die.
I'° 11 rn hies almost proved the
downfall of the Card g.idders.
'I he few times they were able to
»(art a su tained drive, (he hall
was lost to the Timers. They fum
bled nine times in the contest, sev
eral of them deep in their own
territory.
On only two occasions were the
Indians able to gain more than two
eon eeutive first downs.
On the bright side for Stanford,
tluir rookie quarterback Brodie
did a very satisfactory job in his
fir t varsity game. He completed
only nine out of 21 passing at
tempts, hut bis receivers were
dropping numerous throws. Seldom
was he actually wide of his in
tended mark.
The disappointing Card offense
can be chalked up to two things, be
ide> inexperience: poor blocking on
the running plays and dropped
passes on the aerial game. Stanford
continued its ability of last, season
to protect the passer, as Brodie was
sol Join bothered by defensive men.
He was caught behind the line only
once, for a nine-yard loss
The Cards put somewhat more
pressure on Tiger passer Bill Jacobs,
who was able to gain only 31 yards
through the air. COP had a net of
fense of I Ml) yards on 53 plays, an
average ol only 2.0 yards per carry.
One of these was for 20 yards.
Early in the second period Stan
ford drew first blood. They took
over the bail on the Tiger 42. End
John Stewart dropped a Brodie pass,
then caught two more to give the
Cards a first down on the 20-yard
I ine.
A costly and unusual penally—
illegal use of the hands on de
fense —moved the ball to the tine
yard line*. lull hack Bill Tarr
boomed off right tackle for the
score. The fullback's conversion
attempt, though, was wide to the
right.
Tiger 4 penalties, incidentally, .hurt
them on numerous occasions. They
drew five of them, all for 15 yards •
75 yard ; total. „ ,
The clubs battl.ed evenly the re
main ier of the second period, and at
the half Stanford had only a 0-0
iead. COP Coach Jack Myers had

predicted that (JO points would be
cored in the game.
The Tigers looked ;i winner mid
way through the final period, when
with a 0-0 lead Dun Cornell aimed
oil left guard and gaine.l 2(> yards
tor a tally. The conversion attempt
hit the left goal post upright and
bounced back.
•Net die ss io say, Stanlovd needed
some place-kicking practice. Be
sides faulty ctmvei tinif, the Indians
kicked out of Itounds twice in a
row, which gave COP the hall at
inidfield.
The Indians retaliate.} by making
the only su tained drive of the eon
test. They took the ball on their own
2') and drove all the way. Brodie
stuck to the ground game. Later
asked why, he said r "They finally
started blocking."
Eight plays luter, the game was
tied. Biggest gainer of the series
was on a split T pitchout to ball
back Gorcly Young, who scooted lor
24 yards. Turr again drove over
right tackle for the tally.
With Tail's second touchdown,
the score was tied with four and a
quarter minutes remaining to play.
Came conversion time.
Stanford's kicking had been un
predictable. so Card Coach Chuck
Taylor sent in fullback Paul Camera
with a play. The team lined up in a
T-formation. Brodie faked a send
off, and raced to his right. He scoot
ed across untouched for the conver
sion and the ball game.
