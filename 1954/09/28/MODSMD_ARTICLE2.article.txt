LONDON, Sept. 27 (UP)--Sec
retary of State John Foster Dulles
assured French Premier Pierre
Mendes-France today of American
; backing in a new European defense
plan. He tnade it olear, however,
i that failure means revision of U.S.
"forward strategy," an authoritative
source said.
A revision of "forward strategy'
could mean the pulling back of
American forces from exposed areas
on the European continent since the
North Atlantic Treaty powers long
have agreed that the line of the
Elbe Pivot - can be held only with
German help.
But informed sources said Dulles
told Mendes-France that American
backing of a satisfactory system
definitely would include maintain
ing American troops in Europe so
long as a threat to the area exists.
Informed sources said Dulles told
| Churchill and Mendes-France, as he
; told British Foreign Secretary
Anthony Eden last night, that the
United States would back any sat
isfactory European defense system
just as far as it backed the E.D.C.
The French premier in turn as
| sured Dulles on eve of the nine
powet*" conference to decide West
Germany's future that he could win
80 percent backing for his own plan
i for German rearmament from the
| same French National Assembly that
killed the E.D.C.
