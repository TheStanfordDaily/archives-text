# Blueprint in Action
## 
### 
In the past few years we have heard much
about Stanford's blueprint for the future. We
have seen sketches of new dormitories and
diagrams of proposed roads and a shopping
center.
We have learned of plans to construct a
medical center on the campus and watched the
gradual development of light industrial tracts
to the south along El Camino Real.
Yet even prior knowledge of what to expect
couldn't stem our amazement over all that has
happened in the three short months of sum
mer "vacation."
A look around campus is enough to startle
even the most blase of individuals. In the past
90 days:
The Ford Foundation has completed build
ing a $458,000 center for the study of the be
havioral sciences on the hilltop behind Lake
Lagunita and begun research.
Ground has been broken on the corner across
from Stern and Toyon for a $2,690,000 dormi
tory to house 704 men, primarily freshmen.
The building will be ready for occupancy next
September.
Clearing has started on the land bordering

along El Camino Real near the Convalescent
Home, site of the future Stanford shopping
center.
Work has begun on the extension of Em
barcadero Road through the eucalyptus trees,
across Palm Drive, and over the San Fran
cisguito Creek.
Added to this construction activity is the
announcement that General Electric will build
a laboratory on Stanford land near College
Terrace to be ready by December this year.
And the news that a $930,000 addition to
Stern Hall will almost double its capacity. This
is expected to be ready by next September.
And the news that Lloyd Dinkelspiel, chair
man of the Board of trustees, has donated a
music building to Stanford in memory of his
wife. Construction will begin as soon as archi
tects complete their plans.
All thisâ€”in Jhree months.
The dreaming and planning and negotiating
behind these developments come from a Stan
ford team composed of administrators and
friends of the University. We and the students
after us will long reap the rewards of their
efforts.
