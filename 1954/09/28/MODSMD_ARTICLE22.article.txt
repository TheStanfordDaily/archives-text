The announcement that President Eisen
hower's long-heralded "Aioms for Peace" pro
posal will be placed on the agenda of the U.N.
General Assembly has come too late for a Jap
anese fisherman named Aikichi Kuboyama.
He died last week the first victim of the
fl-bomb.
But for his friends in Japan and millions of
other potential innocent victims around the
world, the announcement may have come just
in time. Just in time to squelch some of the
current talk of waging a preventive war. Just
in time to give new impetus to the battJe for
peace.
The plan, as outlined by Secretary of State
Dulles in his opening address to the General
A;>sernbly, included these specific points:
1. Establishment of an international agency
composed of all interested governments to ad
minister the atomic energy pool.
2. An international scientific conference to
consider the proposal. This meeting would be
held under the auspices of the United Nations
next spring.
3. Opening a school in the United States
early next year to train students in the working
principles of atomic energy, with emphasis on

its peacetime role.
4. An invitation to foreign medical and surg
ical experts to participate in atomic energy
techniques used to combat cancer in hospitals
here.
Formidable obstacles to the practical appli
cation of this program arise at once.
In the past Russia has blocked all attempts
to establish an international pool of atomic re
sources for non-military use.
However, Soviet U.N. delegate Andrei Vi
shinsky supported the motion to put Dulles'
plan on the agenda of the General Assembly.
This may mean he has retreated from his
earlier position of insisting that all atomic
weapons be outlawed before discussion of any
pool for peacetime purposes.
Or this may be just another propaganda
blast by the communists, with the usual out
come of loud talk and no action.
When the nations of the world meet to dis
cuss Dulles' proposals, we hope the delegates
remember the name of Aikichi Kuboyama.
Perhaps fifty years from now he will be
known as the only victim of the age of the
hydrogen bomb, rather than the first of mil
lions.
