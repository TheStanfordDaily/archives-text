The seven Stanford students at the
Congress were Pete Bing, ASSU

Students; Al Loomis, NSA co-ordi
nator for the Stanford campus; Bar
bara Klass, president of Stanford's

TWO !OLD PURPOSE
The two-fold purpose of the Con
gress was to provide practical train
ing for student government and NSA
leaders, and to set up discussion ses
sions at which NSA policy and pro
grams lor the year could he drawn
up.
The Congress was planned to fur
ther NSA's basic purpose of seeking
to "maintain academic freedom,
stimulate and improve democratic
student governments, develop better
educational standards, improve stu
dent welfare, promote international
understanding, guarantee to all peo
ple equal rights and possibilities for
education and foster the recognition
of the rights and responsibilities of
students to the school, the commu
nity, humanity and God, and to pre
serve the interests and integrity of
the government and constitution of
the United States."
The busy 10-day program of the
Congress was roughly divided
equally into plenary sessions, at
tended by all 750 delegates, and
commission and sub commission
sessions.
Topifs studied
The topics studied by the four

I commissions were "Student Govern
ment Administration," "The Role of
Students in the Cafnpus Commu
nity," "Student Government Pro
; gramming," aijd "The Role of Stu
dents Beyond the Campus Commu
nity."
Each of the commissions was bro
ken down into from four to seven
sub-commissions for detailed study
by small groups of delegates inter
ested in specific areas within the
commission topics.
The resolutions drawn up in sub
commissions were discussed and per
fected in commission sessions and
then submitted to the plenary floor
for final consideration and adoption
or rejection by the entire body.
Among the topics studied in com
missions which were later carried to
the plenary floor and considered by
all delegates were academic free
dom, school segregation, student ex
change programs, FEPC, military
manpower policies, and student tax
ation.
