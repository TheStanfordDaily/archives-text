### DICK MANSFIELD 
BOATERS AT BERKELEY
Among the recent and readable from the San Fran
cisco Chronicle comes word that "The University of
California's giant, and sometimes raucous, men's
rooting section will be abolished unless Saturday af
ternoon behavior is at a high level during the coming
football season."
The thought of our little blue brothers from Berke
ley comporting themselves 'at a high level" is prelty
entertaining. Let's see . . .
Standard dress for the looting section, of course,
will be white duck trousers (Immaculate! Let's keep
this at a high level), blue and white striped coats (or
perhaps blazers) which can be had fiom the Yale
University Archeology Department at cost, and straw

hats with blue and gold bands.
Such Berkeley men as wear shoes
will undoubtedly wear white
bucks.
High level music must be fur
nished. The Bear marching band,
a noisy outfit at best, must be re
placed by a California Brass
Choir, and let's get rid of that
p-l-e-b-e-i-a-n California song,
which is actually the (ugh!)
"Lights Out March." "Gaudea-

mus Igitur" will do nicely; theme music from Brahms'
First Symphony, last movement, is strictly inspiring
if we wish to remain on a high level.
Furthermore, we can't have the Brass Choir
drowning out the singing. That would be unpolished.
The men's rooting section will have to learn to sing
a capella.
No more hajf-time card stunts. Stunts are coarse.
Instead, we will call them exhibitions, with designs

drawn up by the Art Department.
The UC yells (says the Chronicle: "The past objec
tionable behavior of the rooting section has included
chanting of obscene yells . . .") would be replaced
by invocations spoken soi'tly and in a cultured accent.
Short but never guttural — cries of "Valiantly,
Bears!" or "With a will, fellows!" may be ejaculated
somewhat more loudly. But if, when Stanford scores
another touchdown, we don't hear cries of "Well
played! Jolly well played!" those cheers just aren't
on u high enough level.
The rooting section will maintain an orderly si
lence during penalty measurements, brawls, and
even opponent try-for-points. Should anyone so
much as cough until the hall is snapped on each
play, he must tuVn in his straw hat and watch the
game on TV.
Courtesy—high level courtesy—is expected. When,
in the excitement of a pass from Larsen to Hanifan
for 78 and a TD, someone behind you mashes your
boater, you must turn with a smile, say "Inspiring,
what!" .and make no more of it.
NEVER will the new Cal man rooter throw any
thing—bombs, rolls of paper, or what not —from the
rooting section. He will not pass freshmen up and
down the stands. On sunny days he will wear a gar
denia and a smile, and always maintain a high level
of behavior.
And if that picture goes beyond the realm of the
entertaining, just stop to think: What if this hap
pened to us? Funny? We'd die laughing.
But at that, to die laughing might be cheaper than
to go up to Berkeley to inspect the new men's root
ing section this November. It's going to cost us $2 a
seat to get into Memorial Stadium this year, student
body card or none. Think that one over.

The men's rooting section will have to learn to sing
a capella.
No more hajf-time card stunts. Stunts are coarse.
Instead, we will call them exhibitions, with designs

drawn up by the Art Department.
The UC yells (says the Chronicle: "The past objec
tionable behavior of the rooting section has included
chanting of obscene yells . . .") would be replaced
by invocations spoken soi'tly and in a cultured accent.
Short but never guttural — cries of "Valiantly,
Bears!" or "With a will, fellows!" may be ejaculated
somewhat more loudly. But if, when Stanford scores
another touchdown, we don't hear cries of "Well
played! Jolly well played!" those cheers just aren't
on u high enough level.
The rooting section will maintain an orderly si
lence during penalty measurements, brawls, and
even opponent try-for-points. Should anyone so
much as cough until the hall is snapped on each
play, he must tuVn in his straw hat and watch the
game on TV.
Courtesy—high level courtesy—is expected. When,
in the excitement of a pass from Larsen to Hanifan
for 78 and a TD, someone behind you mashes your
boater, you must turn with a smile, say "Inspiring,
what!" .and make no more of it.
NEVER will the new Cal man rooter throw any
thing—bombs, rolls of paper, or what not —from the
rooting section. He will not pass freshmen up and
down the stands. On sunny days he will wear a gar
denia and a smile, and always maintain a high level
of behavior.
And if that picture goes beyond the realm of the
entertaining, just stop to think: What if this hap
pened to us? Funny? We'd die laughing.
But at that, to die laughing might be cheaper than
to go up to Berkeley to inspect the new men's root
ing section this November. It's going to cost us $2 a
seat to get into Memorial Stadium this year, student
body card or none. Think that one over.

BOATERS AT BERKELEY
Among the recent and readable from the San Fran
cisco Chronicle comes word that "The University of
California's giant, and sometimes raucous, men's
rooting section will be abolished unless Saturday af
ternoon behavior is at a high level during the coming
football season."
The thought of our little blue brothers from Berke
ley comporting themselves 'at a high level" is prelty
entertaining. Let's see . . .
Standard dress for the looting section, of course,
will be white duck trousers (Immaculate! Let's keep
this at a high level), blue and white striped coats (or
perhaps blazers) which can be had fiom the Yale
University Archeology Department at cost, and straw

hats with blue and gold bands.
Such Berkeley men as wear shoes
will undoubtedly wear white
bucks.
High level music must be fur
nished. The Bear marching band,
a noisy outfit at best, must be re
placed by a California Brass
Choir, and let's get rid of that
p-l-e-b-e-i-a-n California song,
which is actually the (ugh!)
"Lights Out March." "Gaudea-

mus Igitur" will do nicely; theme music from Brahms'
First Symphony, last movement, is strictly inspiring
if we wish to remain on a high level.
Furthermore, we can't have the Brass Choir
drowning out the singing. That would be unpolished.
