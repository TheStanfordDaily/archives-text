# Hitchcock Technique Makes 'Rear Window’ Engrossing Film
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window," which leaves the Stanford
Theater early this week, has the compelling fascination of the
novel "you just can't put down."
You sit engrossed, eagerly expectant from the first moments
of the movie as the masterful Hitchcock technique builds the

suspense to a frenzied excite
ment at the climax.
At the beginning, as the
camera scans the apartments and the
court-yard visible from Jimmy
Stewart's wide picture window, you

in the audience
are just another
spectator. You
are watch in g
Stewart watch.
Stewart is in dry
dock with a
broken leg, his
only entertain
ment—with one
notable excep-

tion: Grace Kelly—is watching his
neighbors.
Gradually your attention wavers
among Miss Torso, as Stewart calls
the perpetually practicing ballet
dancer; the newlyweds: Miss Lonely
Hearts; the musician; and the fire
escape sleepers before it finally con
centrates on the unfathomable man
with the invalid wife.
Just as gradually your attitude
changes. Then, almost before you
are aware of that change, you ARE

Jimmy Stewart. You think like him;
you are tense, almost panicked; you
can hear the murderer, whom Stew
art has detected, approaching YOU;
you can feel his hands at YOUR
throat.
Such is the effect of the Hitch
cock direction. But he must share
the honors with Stewart. He in
trigues and capitvates with his soft,
sometimes-halting drawl.
But one of his ideas exasperates
the audience. That he doesn't want
to marry Grace Kelly is unbeliev
able. She is a capable, desirable
woman and clearly in love with
Stewart. Besides all this, she is beau
tiful; and the beauty is much more
than skin deep. Stewart has amaz
ing resistance, but naturally he
doesn't stand a chance.
Raymond Burr is ominous and
convincing as the hulking, cokl
faced, slow-moving killer. In fact
the casting and all the characteri
zations are practically perfect.
And the result is another smooth,
flawless Hitchcock suspense thriller
which leaves you gasping at the
finish.
