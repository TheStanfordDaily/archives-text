STILL KICKIN'—The 1920 Willys Knight—a four-door convertible yet—is one of eight ancient
cars belonging to members of the California chapter of the Antique Automobile Club of America
which were parked in front of the Museum Sun day. The members were headed for Betty and
Lee's for dinner. The 1909 Ford in the background was completely reassembled by its owner,
