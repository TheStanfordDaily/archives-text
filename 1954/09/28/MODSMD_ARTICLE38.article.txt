# Farm Seeks Annexation

### 
Stanford will seek to have its land
annexed by Menlo Park in the fu
ture, according to Business Manager
Alf E. Brandin. Brandin made the
j statement last week at a meeting at
Las School.

The meeting was called by the Las
Lomitas trustees to learn about the
future development plans so they
could map their own building plans.
Brandin said Stanford would co
operate with the school district when
the time came to select specific school
sites.
He added a plan was being pre
pared for 875 acres of property to
be annexed by Menlo Park when
the shopping center is finished. Three
tentative school sites have been
planned for the area.
Menlo Park may also acquire a
portion of the 85-acre Stanford Vil
lage area.
The fate of the area is still under
consideration by Menlo Park, Stan
ford and the San Francisco office
of the Public Housing Administra
tion.
Preliminary negotiations indicate
that Stanford, which needs the land
for student housing, may be able to
purchase only a portion of it.
