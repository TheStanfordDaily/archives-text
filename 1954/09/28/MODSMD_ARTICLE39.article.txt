# Center Site Work Begins
## 
### 
Work has begun to prepare the site
for the Stanford multi-million dol
lar regional shopping center west of
El Camino Real between the Palo
Alto Hospital and San Francisquito
Creek.
Wagner and Martinez, a San
Francisco contracting firm, is at
work leveling the area and is mov
ing 100,000 cubic yards of dirt. The
job will take from four to five
weeks and will cost $30,000. accord
ing to Stanford Business Managei
Alf E. Brandin.
Once the site is levelled, McFad
den and Sons, and the City of Palo
Alto will start to work on the in
stallation of utilities. After this the
actual construction will begin.
Six merchandisers have already
revealed that they will be located
in the shopping center. They include
the Emporium, I. Magnin, Roos Bros.,
Sommer & Kaufmann, Anglo Bank,
and American Trust.
Only the Emporium has signed a
lease. Brandin stated that completion
of a lease takes a long time because
Stanford requires building plans to
be part of the document. This is in
conjunction with the University's
policy of carefully controlling the
development.
Construction on roads to the shop

ping center has also gotten under
way. Workers have been clearing
an area in the woods between the
Stadium and the hospital in ordei
to extend Embarcadero Road from
El Camino behind the hospital to
San Francisquito Creek.
The new road will cut across Palm
Drive. A traffic light will bo in
serted at the intersection of the two
roads. Proposals were made to run
Embarcadero under Palm Drive, but
Brandin stated that the Embarca
dero extension may be only a temp
orary road, in which case an ex
tension would be a waste of money.
A two-lane bridge has also been
planned to extend Willow Road from
the Sand Hill and Alpine Read
junction to the rear of the shopping
center. Brandin said San* Mateo and
Santa Clara Counties had agreed to
give $25,000 each to help construct
part of the bridge. Work on the
bridge will begin after the winter
rains.
Ultimate plans call for an ex
tension of Willow across El Camino
with an overpass near Alma Street.
