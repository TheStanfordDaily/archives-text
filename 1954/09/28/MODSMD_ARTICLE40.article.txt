# GE to Build Campus Lab
## 
### 
The General Electric Company re- I
cently became the third member of J
Stanford's light industrial family. I
GE is going to establish an ultra
modern laboratory for research
which the company says could revo
lutionize broadcast, communications
and radar industries over the next
10 years.
Construction of the $175,000 lab
oratory building began in the mid
dle of August and is slated to be
completed by December 1, 1954. The
10,000 square foot lab, designed to
provide for future expansion, is to
be located on a 2Va acre site south
east of California Avenue and about
two blocks west of El Camino Real
in the College Terrace area.
Eastman Kodak and Varian Asso
ciates already operate laboratories
in the tract. Eastman recently an
nexed five acres to provide for park
ing and employee recreation areas.
President Wallace Sterling men
tioned that several other companies
are negotiating with Stanford for
sites. >,
Stanford will erect the GE lab
under an agreement to lease both
the building and site.

Dr. W. R. G. Baker, vice presi
dent ;inrl general manager of GE
revealed that they would concen
trate on exploring and developing
the application of microwave elec
tron tubes.
Ontil the lrtb is completed, Gen
oral Electric will operate in tempo
rary space provided at the Stanford
Research Institute.
A year-long study of potential
<ites preceded the choice of the
Stanford property. The selection was
tided by the,fact that the Bay Area
is a center of advanced tube de
velopment and that Stanford's elec
trinics research and microwave labs
are pioneering in the field of micro
wave tubes.
The location of the lab will also
give GE's scientists the opportunity
for advanced study leading to mast
er's and bachelor's degrees at Stan
ford.
