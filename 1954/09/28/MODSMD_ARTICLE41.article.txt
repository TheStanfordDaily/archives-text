Stanford has taken on a now look
as the result of two new buildings
and some summer repair work.
The most significant structure is
the $200,000 Microwave Laboratory
which is part of the W. W. Hansen
Laboratories of Physics.
A staff of about 85 men has begun
work on a new electron linear ac
celerator to be known as "Mark
IV." Special electric power appar
atus has been installed in the lab
oratory along with a special under
ground radiation vault for experi
ments with the "Mark IV."
The U. S. Atomic Energy Com
mission is supporting the "Mark
IV" and larger accelerator studies.
The Stanford University Press re
cently completed a $50,000 ware
house in the Corporation Yard and
the books that were stored in the
Village have been moved there.
The University spent $36,500 to
renovate Toyon Hall during the
summer and also fixed up the sphinx
and statue at the Mausoleum
which had been misfaced by vandals.
