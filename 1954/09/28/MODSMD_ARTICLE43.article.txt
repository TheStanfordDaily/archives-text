# Behavioral Experts Commence Work At Ford-Sponsored Research Center
## Grant of $3.5 Million Aids Advanced Study Project 
### DICK MANSFIELD Associate Editor, The Daily 
The first post - doctoral re
search center in the field of be
havioral sciences opened its
doors to selected scholars from
all over the world earlier this
month at its hilltop site just
south of the Stanford campus.
The Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences, established
for a five-year term by the Ford
Foundation on an original grant of
$3.5 million, stands at the former lo
cation of the Charles Lathrop home,
"Alta Vista," near the Stanford golf
course and across Junipero Serra
Boulevard from Lake Lagunita.
Here 36 scholars representing
fields of political science, psychol
ogy, economics, anthropology, biol
ogy, sociology, and closely related
fields have gathered to work on
projects of their own choosing for
one year, each man enjoying the ad
vantages of a secluded, scholarly at
mosphere and contact with other
outstanding men in the fields of be
havioral sciences.
The research center leases 11 acres
of land from the University under
terms which dictate five years' ten
ancy with an option to continue the
lease for an additional ten years.
The original Ford Foundation grant
is for one year of planning (already
past) and five years of operation
(just begun) of the center.
Establishment of the center was
based on the fifth point of a Ford
Foundation report issued in Sep
tember 1950, statin, 1 ? that "The
Ford Foundation will support sci
entific activities designed to in
crease knowledge of factors which
influence or determine human
conduct, and to extend such
knowledge for the maximum ben
efit of individuals and of society."
Various committees formed to
carry out the projects implied by
this aim arrived at the conclusion
that more training was needed in
the field, and that "training of a
moderate number of first-rate peo
ple" was a more judicious step than
attempting more general training.
Planning for a Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences
began in 1951.
The Stanford site was announced
last April 1, with destruction of the
old Lathrop home to begin imme
diately. Actual construction of the
center began about June 15 and
ended just two and one-half months
later, on September 1. Total cost of
the construction project approached
$460,000.
Physical layout of the research

enter is built around a central ad
ninistrative building containing au
litorium, offices, library, seminar
ooms, and library. Six outlying
tudy buildings, containing four to
ix individual studies each, have
been built, and one existing building
ias been refurbished to contain four
norc studies—42 studies in all.
Architecture of the center is mod
•rn, with one-story, fiat-roof con
iruction throughout. Aichitecti
vcre Wurster, Bernardi, and Em
mons, of San Francisco. Interior
decoration, also modern in motif, is
by Knoll Associates of New York,
vvith landscaping, employing largely
materials from the existing grounds
and gardens, by Thomas Church.
The purpose of the center, as
outline:! by its director, Dr. Ralph
YV. Tyler, is "to train the people
here," with individual goals being
to perfect personal methods of re
search. The center frees the schol
ar from the duties imposed upon
him in his regular career, and
allows him self - development
through study, travel, or concen
trated scholarly work.
Scholars to be admitted to the
center were nominated by individ
ual institutions, and about 3,000
nominations were submitted for the
center's first year. After a great leal
of interviewing and screening, 36
men were chosen, ranging in status
from "senior scientists" to men who
have held the Ph.D. degree as little
as three years. All are known as
"Fellows" at the center.
Methods of compensation for the
Fellows differ. Some institutions
continue to pay salaries to their men
and are reimbursed by the center.
In some cases, often with state uni
versities, the center pays the schol
ars directly, at the rate which they
received in their institutions.
By general agreement, the Fel
lows will spend their mornings in
individual work. At other times,
Fellows will group themselves into
six general areas of concentration,
and may belong to any number of
these.
Dr. Tyler noted that Fellows who
complete works at the center will
publish there, but work at the cen
ter may be of any nature —beginning
new projects or working on and
completing projects already started.
Dr. Tyler indicated that contact
between Fellows at the center and
students in behavioral sciences
fields at Stanford would be lim
ited. Contact with students would
in part negate the value of the
center in getting scholars away
from their regular duties, Dr.
Tyler pointed out.
All the Fellows live in rented
homes in the Palo Alto area. No

- residences tire maintained for the!
' Fellows or at the center, and j
lunch is the only meal served. Those ;
Fellows wishing to work with sub- I
jects generally rlo not do so at the I
center, although facilities are pro- J
j vided for consultations. i
The old Lathrop Estate was built
1 over 50 years ago for Charles La- '
throp, brother of Mrs. Leland Stan- j
! ford. The site commands a view of
I most of the central peninsula, and
study buildings are so situated as to
take advantage of this view. All
have view windowsr and plastic sun 1
I domes.

ADMINISTRATION BUILDING —This building, x-shaped in plan view, houses offices, seminar
rocrns, the library, meeting rooms, and the lunchroom of the Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences. Landscaping for the Center was done by Thomas Church; architects were
Wurster, Bernardi, and Emmons, of San Francisco. Architecture and furnishings are modern
throughout. Total cost of the research center construction was $458,000. The administration
building stands at the site of the old Charles Lathrop estate, Alta Vista, which was razed to make
room for the center.
