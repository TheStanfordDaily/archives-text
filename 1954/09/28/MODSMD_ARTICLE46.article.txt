# Was It Luck or Did Tribe Play 'Heads Up’ Game?
## Taylor—Cards Deserved Upset Win Over Oregon 
### DON WEBSTER 
"Earlier I believed Stanford didn't deserve to win its game
against Oregon, because of the poor football we played. But after
studying tha films I've changed my mind. Oregon made even
more mistakes than we did."
Card Coach Chuck Taylor was discussing last Saturday's thriller

against the talent-laden Ducks. So
called "breaks" gave the game to
Stanford, 18-13.
Breaks are a rather nebulous
thing, for it's never too clear where
luck begins and playing heads-up
football ends. Fumbles, for instance,
can be due to a hard-hitting defense
or sloppy ball-handling. And pen
alties during key plays can hardly
be considered "breaks."
Even so. luck was with the Cards
when they went to Multnomah Sta
dium to face a team with superior
personnel. Despite the victory, Coach
Taylor was very disappointed with
the showing of his Indians.
"We played below par for our
second game of the season," he
commented. "Oregon's mistakes
gave lis the game. We'll need to
i improve tremendously if we ex
pect to win any of our next three
i games" (against Illinois, Navy, and
IJCLA).
The ball game had hardly begun
I before the visitors had a 6-0 lead,
j Oregon took the kickoff and re
j turned it to the 24. A fumble oc
curred on the first play from scrim
mage, as halfback Walt Gaffney, at
i tempting to sweep wide, fumbled on
j the Duck 16. Stanford's soph half
back Gordy Young recovered.
An offside play and-ti run up the
middle canceled each other out.
Then quarter b a c k John Brodie
passed to Young near the left side
line. He tapped the ball up in the
air, snared it, and raced into the end
zone for the score.
Both the fumble and the bobbled
pass were good breaks for the Cards,
but could they be called "lucky" for
this?

Oregon took the next kickoff and
started to roll. They moved steadily
from their own 38 to the Stanford 15.
A 15-yard penalty halted the drive,
and gave them a fourth and two sit
uation. There wasn't much for them
to worry about though, for every
running play had previously gained
at least four yards.
But Duck quarterback George
Shaw, instead of calling for a line
smash, faded back and threw a long
pass that was incomplete in the end
zone. The Cards took over.
Can the Stanford eleven be
called because Shaw made
a had call?
Five plays then netted 19 yards
for Stanford. Brodie faded back to
pass and tossed a 30-yarder intended
for end John Stewart. The ball hit
the flailing hand of safetyman Shaw.
Stewart grabbed the loose pigskin
and raced for 21 more yards for a
51-yard pass play.
Shaw. had allowed Stewart to
get behind him and then failed to
knock the hall to the ground. Does
this make the Indians "lucky"?
This put the ball on the 16, and a
few plays later Brodie quarterback
sneaked a yard for the tally. Stan
ford, 13-point underdogs according
to the experts, had a 12-0 lead in the
first quarter.
Oregon returned the next kickoff
fil yards to the Card 10-yard line.
Halfback Dick James was hit at the
line of scrimmage, fumbled, and
Jerry Gustafson recovered for Stan
ford.
Again a Duck drive was halted
by either "luck" or heads-up foot
ball.
Oregon scored on a 27-yard drive,
aided by a long punt return. They
too missed the conversion. The
Ducks almost scored again in the
second quarter, being on the four
yard line when the gun sounded.
Perhaps the only real break for
the Cards occurred in the third pe
riod. With fourth down and one
yard to go on their own 45, Taylor
indicated from the sidelines that
Brodie should punt.
The rookie play - caller missed
the sign, though, and sent Tarr on
an off-tackle play. He soootcd sli
yards on a situation that should
have been a punt. "That particu
lar play didn't gain ground for us,
either before or after," said Tay
lor. "I called for a kick, hut later
was glad we ran."
The next time Oregon got the
ball, they were forced to punt at
midfield. It was the onlv time in

1 the game the losers had to kick.
One time the Oregon left end
was offside. This gave him an ex
tra step or. the defense, and al
lowed him to catch a Ion,? pass.
Was Stanford "lucky" that offi
cials nullified the play with a pen
alty?
Oregon's powerful offense drove
79 yards for a fourth-period score.
But the gains were all made on the
ground, which took up precious
time. Stanford defensive men were
allowing the losers to make short
gains to eat up the time. It is not
inconceivable that, had they not
! been ahead by two touchdowns, the
Cards would have stiffened.
There's little doubt that: (1) Ore
[ gon had superior personnel; (2;
| Stanford played a below-par game;
I (3) the Cards took advantage of the
' Duck mistakes while the losers did
: not do the same for Stanford; (4)
Oregon mistakes (fumbles, bad play
calling, penalties, etc.) cost them the
1 game.
Does this make the Cards
1 "lucky"?


A TOOTH FOR A TOUCHDOWN—Quarterback
John Brodie (12) knifes through a nice hole in the
Oregon line for a touchdown in the first period
Saturday night to put the Indians on top by 12-0.

Brodie's yard and a half sneak was the 11th play
in an 85-yard drive. The Tribe sophomore, be
cause his tongue was hanging out of his mouth,
lost a tooth on the play. Blocking for Brodie is

Bill Tarr (20). Identifiable Oregon players are
Walt Gaffney (47) and Jerry Nelson (68). Over
30,000 saw the Indians win, 18-13.
