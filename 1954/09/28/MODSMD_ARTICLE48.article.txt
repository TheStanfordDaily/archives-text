# Was It 'Too Many Malted Milks’ That Caused Illini to Be Upset?
## 
### 
"We had too many malted
milks."
Doug Mills, athletic director
at Illinois, summed up his team's
defeat to Penn State that way.
But Stanford coaches aren't be
ing fooled by the upset—they
know the Illini are one of the
top teams in the nation.
The malted milk gag stems from
the Rose Bowl game of 1952, when
the Cards were trounced by the
Champaign eleven. One Los Angeles
sportswriter attributed the loss to
lack of condition and "too many
malted milks."
In preparing for Saturday's con
test, Coach Chuck Taylor called it
off' the Card showing against Ore
gon, "the greafest injustice in the
game of football."
The coach is particularly pessi
mistic about Stanford's chances
because he learned yesterday that
end John Stewart will he side
lined.
The ace high-jumper injured his
ankle Saturday when he dropped a
pass and then landed on the foot
ball. He sprained his right ankle,
but should be ready for the Navy
game two weeks hence.
Trainer Connie Jarvis commented
that "he could play this week were
it not for the fact he takes off high
jumping on his right foot."
Jim McCamant will he moved to
the left end spot, and Steve Docter
will start at right end. McCamant
and Docter were fighting for the
right end berth.
The scout report from Illinois in
dicated the following:
(1) Ray Elliot's club is as strong
as they were expected to be, but
underrated Penn State's abilities.
(2) J. C. Caroline, Mickey Bates,
and Abe Woodson make up one of
the strongest running backfields in
college football history.

(3) Illinois is traditionally a slow
starter, like Stanford. Last season
their club tied Nebraska in the op
ener, 21-21.
(4) Their conversion situation is
like the Card's—poor. Their 14-12
defeat came on the extra points.
A 1 Masters, Stanford Athletic Di
rector, estimated yesterday that the
game will draw 35,000 fans. He said
Stanford will lose $30,000 because
the game is being locally (and na
tionally) televised.
Taylor said that Stanford will pass
even more against Illinois than
against their previous opponents,
"because we know we won't gain
any yardage at all on the ground."
