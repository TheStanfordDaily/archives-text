# New Wings To Be Built For Stern
## 
### 
Stanford added another con
struction project to its growing
list of expansion activities yes
terday v/ith the announcement
by President Wallace Sterling
that two new wings would be
added to Lucie Stern Hall.
The construction of two three
story wings will nearly double the
undergraduate number living in the
dormitory. The addition, which will
provide room for about 200 students,
has been made possible by new gifts
from the estate of Mrs. Louis Stern.
The estimated cost is $930,000.
Spencer & Ambrose, San Fran
cisco architects, have been commis
sioned by the Stanford Board of
Trustees to prepare working plans.
The University hopes to have the
wings completed by September. 1955.
The addition is the second step
in the original plan to complete the
dormitory in the form of eight
wings enclosing a quadrangle. The
existing portion of Stern Hall was
completed in 1949. It houses 229 stu
dents in four two-story wings.
Some of the facilities provided at
the time the first four wings were
built have sufficient capacity to
serve all eight wings. These include
the kitchen, director's office and
living quarters, employee living
quarters, and the food storage base
ment.
The new rooms will also be
doubles and each wing will have its
own lounge. A cafeteria and dining
room will be constructed to serve
both wings and there will be a
storage basement under one.
The entire addition, comprising
53,700 square feet of floor space, will
be built of reinforced concrete. The
contemporary architectural design
of the original units will be fol
lowed.
