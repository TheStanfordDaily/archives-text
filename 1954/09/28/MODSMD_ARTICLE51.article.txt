# Under Coach Pop Warner Stanford Became National Football Power
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
Glenn Scobey (Pop) Warner,
probably 112 o o t b a 1 l's greatest
coach and mentor of the Stan
ford Indians from 1924 to 1932,
died in Palo Alto Hospital Sept.
7. He was 83.
Warner had been in critical con
dition for some time after undergo
ing surgery for removal of a tumor
on his neck. He was operated on a
year ago for a coneerous growth on
his throat and had in recent years
been receiving treatment for an
arthritic condition of his leg.
Warner was acknowledged as one
of the top figures in the history of

football and developed such athletes
as Ernie Nevers and Jim Thorpe,
both all-time Ail-Americans.
In 1951, members of the National
Coaches Association named him
"Coach of All the Years."
Warner started his football career
in 1893 when he captained and
coached at Cornell. Two years later
he became coach at lowa State and
the following season he returned as
coach at Cornell. In 1897 he moved
to the Carlisle Indian School in
Pennsylvania where he remained
for seven years.
Cornell called him back for three
more seasons, but in 1907 he re
turned to Carlisle and soon won
nation-wide fame as a coach. Car
lisle, with such gridiron greats as

Thorpe and Frank Mount Pleasant,
played and defeated the leading
teams of the country at the time.
Among them were Penn, Harvard,
Minnesota, Chicago, and Army.
Warner molded Thorpe into one
of the greatest all-around athletes
of all time, a position challenged
only by Stanford's Bob Mathias.
Warner shifted to Pittsburgh in
1914 and his success continued; two
years later he fielded a national
champion. He remained at Pitt until
1924 to complete his contract with
the Panthers, although he was of
fered the Stanford head coaching
position in 1922.
Under Pop Warner, the Indians
became a big time football power.
It was on the Farm that he develop
ed the famous wingback formation
that put two backs close to the
line so they could become more
effective blockers.
For the Big Red Machine he also
devised the unbalanced line, double
reverses, the crouching start for
backs, and the screen pass. All these
innovations are generally accepted
and used by all coaches in football
today.
Ei'nie Nevers first played the
"Warner System" in 1924. As a full
back he received the ball from cen
ter on every play. This style ol
play received the nation-wide at
tention in the 1925 Hose Bowl game,
v\ hen Stanford played Notre Dame's
famous "four horsemen." Although
the Tribe bowed, 27-10, soon two
thirds of the country's college
elevens were using the formation.
Warner never coached the Indians
to a losing season;'during his regime
Stanford won 05 and lost but 17. His
lifetime record was 312 wins, 104
losses, and 32 ties.
With Warner in charge, Stanford
football became more than just an
exciting contest. It grew into an
exciting show, and gate receipts
from the games paid off the debts
on the Stadium, built the Women's
Gym, the golf course, the BAC, and
started Branner Hall.
While at Stanford Warner sent
three teams to the Rose Bowl. In
addition to the 1925 defeat to Notre
Dame, the Tribe tied Alabama in
1927 and defeated Pittsburgh in
1928.
Warner's 1932 Stanford squad,
however, lost four times and tied one
which created considerable grumb
ling among alumni. So following the
season Warner resigned and took
over at Temple. He remained at
Temple until 1939. During that time
he sent a team to the Rose Bowl.
Warner made his home in Palo
Alto and retained his intense in
terest in football. He attended most
of the Stanford and San Francisco
49er home games.
A few years ago, a Pop Warner
award was established and presented
annually to the outstanding Senior
football player on the Pacific Coast.
Warner presented the award each
year at the PALO Sports Club's
"Million Dollar Banquet." Among
those receiving the award were Russ
Pomeroy, Stanford captain in 1950,
and Bob Garrett of 1953 fame. The
latter presentation was Warner's
last public appearance.
