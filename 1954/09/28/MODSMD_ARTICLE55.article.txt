### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 27 — (UP)—
Charley Dressen, the only man the
Senators wanted "because of his
tremendous drive," was named the
new Washington manager today and
given a two-year contract "to run
the club any way he sees fit.
Terms of the two-year pact were
not revealed but it was believed the
stocky, ex-Brooklyn Dodger man
ager will receive $35,000 per year
through 1955 and 1956.
Dressen, who managed Oakland of
the Pacific Coast League this year
after turning his back on a one-year
contract offered by Brooklyn Presi
dent Walter O'Malley last October,
said he felt the Senators have "a
nucleus of a really good ball club."
He succeeds Stanley (Bucky)
Harris, who was fired two days ago
by Washington, which wound up
sixth in the American League. It
was Harris' third managerial term
with the Senators, for whom he
starred as a player.
Dressen said he would select his
coaches "sometime later on" but one
,of them was expected to be Cookie
Lavagetto, who served in a similar
capacity with him in Brooklyn and
at Oakland this year.
Vice President Cal Griffith of the
Senators said that both he and his
father, Club President Clark Grif
fith, were "elated" at landing the
stocky, aggressive 50-year-old Dres
sen.
