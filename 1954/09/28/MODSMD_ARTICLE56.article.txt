SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 27
(UP) —Coach Lynn Waldorf of Cal
ifornia said today that his Bears
were in for a "terrific test" this
Saturday when they play Ohio State
at Columbus.
"I understand that Bob Watkins,
who ripped off so much yardage
against us last season, is battling
James Roseboro for the right half
spot which will make both men
twice as tough," Waldorf told the
weekly meeting of local football
writers.
At the same time, Waldorf seemed
fairly satisfied with his own squad,
which romped over San Jose State
45-0.
"San Jose had the misfortune to
lose nine of its 13 fumbles and that
spelled the story of the ball game,"
Waldorf said. "Our conversions have
to be ironed -out. We kicked only
three out of seven against San Jose.
But Larson showed definite im
provement and probably will be the
main place kicker before the season
is much older."
