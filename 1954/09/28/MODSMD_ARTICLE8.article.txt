## Committee Recommends McCarthy Be Censured 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept 27 (UP) A special committee unani
mously recommended in a stinging report today that the senate
censure Son. Joseph R. McCarthy on two charges- contempt of
the senate and abuse of Brig. Gen. Ralph W. Zwicker.
The committee, composed of three Republicans and three Demo-

jcrats also criticized in excep
; lionalJy strong language Mc-
I Carlhy's conduct in connection
with three-other charge.; in a five
' count bill of particulars. But it said
j they did not warrant censure.
| The Watkins resolutions, which
j are expected to carry no punish-
I meni other than oral chastisement,
| will he subject to debate and
i amendment. McCarthy's attorney,
Edward Bennett Williams, said the
| Senator will make a "vigorous and
I lengthy defen.se on the Senate floor.
McCarthy, who could become the
fourth Senator to be cen. ured in the
history of the Senate, was reported
| vi.sit.ing in Arizona and as not im
mediately available for comment on
| the caustic 68-page report.
The report, a rare document in
Senate annals, was severely critical
of McCarthy's conduct over the past
few years. It was sprinkled with
denunciations accusing McCarthy of
"reprehensible'' actions, "highly im
| propei " conduct, and "vulgar and
j insulting" language.
On the two charges in which it
: recommended censure, the commit
tee found that:
"1. McCarthy committed contempt
of the Senate wheh he failed to
j appear before a 1951-52 Senate
J Elections Subcommittee which in
j vestigated his finances and other ac
tivities. He was "contemptuous,
contumacious, and denunciatory."
especially of Senator Robert C. Hen
drickson (R., N.J.), a subcommittee
member. McCarthy said Hcndrick
son was "a living miracle with nei
ther brains nor guts." It said Mc-
Carthy to this day never has an
swered three "serious" questions
I raised by the subcommittee.
2. M c Cart h y abused General
Zwicker, World War II combat hero
and former commander of Camp
Kilmer, N.J., during a secret hear
-1 ing in New York. McCarthy's con
duct was "inexcusable" and "for this
conduct he should be censured by
the Senate." The committee said
this held regardless of whether the
witness was a general or a private
citizen. McCarthy told Zwicker he
| was "not fit to wear that uniform."
