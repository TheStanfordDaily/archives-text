yf
for Cat
One thing nice
about cats is
they never worry
about where all
the money
Do you?
With Bank of
America's Tenplan
checks you can
account for every
last penny. You
can afford them,
too: Costs just 12 j
a check, and no
minimum balance;
Moral: A man with
a Tenplan check
book can be as
carefree as a cat.
