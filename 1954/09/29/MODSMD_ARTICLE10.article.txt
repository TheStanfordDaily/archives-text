# Sen. McCarran Dead Following Heart Attack
## 
### 
HAWTHORNE. Ncv., Sept. 28
(UP) —Sen. Pat McCarran, vet
eran Nevada lawmaker and one
of the most influential members
of the Senate, died tonight of
an apparent heart attack. He
was 78.
McCarran collapsed shortly after
ho had made a plea for harmony in
Nevada's Democratic party in the
Nov. 2 election at a campaign rally
attended by the party's candidates
for state and national office.
The final speaker on the program,
McCarran walked off the platform
at Civic Center and began shaking
hands with admirers. At 9:15 p.m..
he suddenly fell backward and col
lapsed or the floor before anyone
could reach him.
He was pronounced dead by doc- !
tors at approximntely 9:30.
McCarran began his political ca
reer in 1926, when he ran for the
Senate and was defeated. Six years
later, however, he was elected in
the landslide that carried Franklin
Roosevelt into the White House.
After that, he held his seat contin- I
uously until'his death.
A former district attorney, state
legislator, and chief justice of the
Nevada Supreme Court, McCarran
had planned to seek re-election in
195(i to his fifth consecutive term in
the Senate.
During his long career in the Sen
ate, McCarran was sometimes a
staunch backer of Roosevelt and
Truman and on some issues one of
their severest critics. At his elec
tion to the Senate in 1 D»J2. McCarran
was an ardent Roosevelt supporter,
but later split with the late Presi
dent over the Supreme Court pack
ing is. lie and on subsequent mat - I
ters.
One of McCarran's most famous I
and controversial actions came in j
1952 when he pushed through a new i
immigration law co-sponsored with
Francis I'. Walter CD., Pa.). This
bill, the McCarran-Walter Act, con
tinued the national origins system
-if arriving at immigration quotas.
Last Monday McCarran had con
demned the Watkins Committee for I
its action in recommending censure |
of Senator Joseph McCarthy and j
had indicated he planned to oppose j
such action.
McCarran's death cuts the Demo- i
cratie strength in the Senate to 4fi, J
with 48 Republicans and one inde- j
pendent. Nevada's Republican Gov- j
ernor, Charles H. Russell, is ex- j
poctcd to appoint a Republican as j
McCarran's successor. Assuming that
a Republican is named in McCar- j
rail's place, the Senate makeup will
be: 49 Republicans, 4fi Democrats. I
and one independent.
