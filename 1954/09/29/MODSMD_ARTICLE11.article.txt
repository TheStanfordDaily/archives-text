# LOCAL CONSULS RULE
## Three Foreign Scholars Denied American Visas 
### 
Throe of tho 10 ASSU foreign scholars scheduled lo study here
this year have been denied visas by American consuls in their
j respective countries.
Petar Macanovic of Yugoslavia and Kyu Whan Kim of South
Korea will be unable to enter the United States this year to par-

ticipate in Stanford s foreign stu
dent program although the two cases
are still under inquiry in Washing
ton, D.C.
The third scholar, J Scott Birnie
of Scotland, lias been refused a visa
on medical grounds. Birnie had been
j selected by the committee, when the
committee received word that the
1 Scottish Cultural Society would sup
j port a scholar.
Grant Spaeth, last year's Foreign
Scholarship Committee co-chairman,
put an inquiry before the State De
partment early this summer in an
effort to gain full particulars of the
two cases, and is now awaiting final
word.
In both cases, according to this
year's co - chairmen John Sprague
and Lois Mossman, there is no
chance of their coming this year, but
a possibility that they might next,
if visas are granted. The power of
granting or denying visas lies in the
hands of the American consul in the
foreign country.
Macanovic is a social science ma
jor and student government leader.
Kim was preparing to study as a
political science graduate student,
having studied journalism at the
University of Tokyo and served as a
front-line correspondent for the
United Press.
Two days before Kim was due to
arrive in the United States, the com
mittee received a letter from him
saying his departure had been de
layed for lack of a visa. Although
studying in Japan, he was informed

that he must obtain a visa from his
native Korea.
The consul in Seoul denied the
visa. Kim is now in Seoul attempt
ing to secure his papers, and the
committee has sent an inquiry to the
Cultural Affairs Officer at the Amer
ican Embassy.
The only other foreign student
who has not yet arrived is Mushar
raf Soofi of Pakistan, who is await
ing confirmation of her Fulbright
travel grant.
