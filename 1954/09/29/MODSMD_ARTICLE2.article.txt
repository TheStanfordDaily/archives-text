# Nixon Praises McCarthy Report, Predicts Effects
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 (UP) —Vice President Richard M.
Nixon predicted today that the unanimous committee report
recommending censure of Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy will carry
"great weight with the Senate."
Nixon, who appointed the special committee which held the

censure inquiry, said the group con
ducted its hearings "in a very ad
mirable fashion."
But Chairman William E. Jenncr
(R-Ind.) of the Senate Internal Se
curity Subcommittee said the com
mittee failed to consider that the
"discrediting" of McCarthy is what
the Communists want.
He said the attack on McCarthy
"is the front line of a continuing at
tack on the United States Congress
which will end only in the destruc
tion of the Communists or of the
Congress."
The statements of the two Repub
licans were indicative of the bitter
fight that is almost certain to occur
when the Senate returns Nov. 8 to
consider the censure report.
McCarthy is planning to wage a
vigorous defense to avoid becoming
the fourth senator in history to re
ceive a formal rebuke from his col
leagues.

There was some speculation the
report would he used extensively in
the congressional election campaign,
keeping the issue fired up until the
senate returns six days after the
election.
But Republican National Chair
man Leonard W. Hall predicted to
day it will "not have an effect on the
election whatsoever."
Hall told a national press club
lunch he thinks the American people
are "sick and tired" of the McCarthy
issue. He declined to say how he
would vote on the censure report if
he were a senator.
Nixon told reporters as he arrived
at Lowell, Mass., for a campaign
swing through Massachusetts that
Senate leaders acted wisely in post
poning the Senate session until after
the election.
He said he appointed senators to
the censure committee who were not
candidates for re-election this year
and thus "would not be under po
litical pressure."

Sen. Joseph It. McCarthy will
appear on the "Meet the Press"
television and radio programs Sun
day for what may be his las pub
lic comment on the special Senate
committee's recommendation that
he he censured.
Locally the program will lie car
ried over KKON-TV at 3 p.m. and
KNBC radio at !»:30 p.m.


HERE IT IS, BOYS—Reporters swarm around Harold Beckley, superintendent of the Senate press
gallery, as he hands out copies of the Senate Censure Committee's report recom,mending the
censue of Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy on two of the five general charges. Vice-President Richard
Nixon has gone on record as predicting that the report would greatly influence the Senate's
consideration of the charges. , * NEA Telephoto

WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 (UP) —Vice President Richard M.
Nixon predicted today that the unanimous committee report
recommending censure of Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy will carry
"great weight with the Senate."
Nixon, who appointed the special committee which held the

censure inquiry, said the group con
ducted its hearings "in a very ad
mirable fashion."
But Chairman William E. Jenncr
(R-Ind.) of the Senate Internal Se
curity Subcommittee said the com
mittee failed to consider that the
"discrediting" of McCarthy is what
the Communists want.
He said the attack on McCarthy
"is the front line of a continuing at
tack on the United States Congress
which will end only in the destruc
tion of the Communists or of the
Congress."
The statements of the two Repub
licans were indicative of the bitter
fight that is almost certain to occur
when the Senate returns Nov. 8 to
consider the censure report.
McCarthy is planning to wage a
vigorous defense to avoid becoming
the fourth senator in history to re
ceive a formal rebuke from his col
leagues.

There was some speculation the
report would he used extensively in
the congressional election campaign,
keeping the issue fired up until the
senate returns six days after the
election.
But Republican National Chair
man Leonard W. Hall predicted to
day it will "not have an effect on the
election whatsoever."
Hall told a national press club
lunch he thinks the American people
are "sick and tired" of the McCarthy
issue. He declined to say how he
would vote on the censure report if
he were a senator.
Nixon told reporters as he arrived
at Lowell, Mass., for a campaign
swing through Massachusetts that
Senate leaders acted wisely in post
poning the Senate session until after
the election.
He said he appointed senators to
the censure committee who were not
candidates for re-election this year
and thus "would not be under po
litical pressure."

Sen. Joseph It. McCarthy will
appear on the "Meet the Press"
television and radio programs Sun
day for what may be his las pub
lic comment on the special Senate
committee's recommendation that
he he censured.
Locally the program will lie car
ried over KKON-TV at 3 p.m. and
KNBC radio at !»:30 p.m.
