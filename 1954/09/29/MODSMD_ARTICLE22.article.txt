# The 						McCarthy Censure
## 
### 
Contemptuous, contumacious, denunciatory,
unworthy, inexcusable, and reprehensible.
With this battery of adjectives six United
Slates senators have officially announced what
a great many Americans have known for a
long time.
Namely that Senator' Joseph McCarthy is
a liability to the prestige of the Senate, a
menace to the liberties guaranteed in the Con
stitution, and an affront to the dignity of self
respecting men.
The effect of this ringing denunciation of
the* manner .and methods of the junior senator
from Wisconsin will penetrate far beyond the
boundaries of the United States.
For these words were uttered not by Mc-
Carthy's favorite target, the "left wing press,"
but six of his colleagues who are respected rep
resentatives of a large number of Americans.
To those abroad who have woefully pointed

to a growing anti-communist hysteria in the
United States, to those in this country who have
smarted from the crudeness and ill-temper of
the senator, this report provides great relief
and satisfaction.
Relief from the fear that in our anxiety to rid
the nation of communists we would allow one
man to flout the rules of fair play and common
courtesy. Satisfaction in the fact that the repri
mand has come from official representatives of
the American people.
The full effect of this report won't be realized
until the second weekend of November when
the Senate will reconvene to consider the cen
sure recommendations.
Ai that time, free from the pressures of elec
tion campaigning, we hope the remaining
members of the Senate will make this report
the unanimous censure of the American
public.
