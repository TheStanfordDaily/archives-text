There will be new personalities in a familiar
setting tonight as the Executive Committee
holds its first meeting of the quarter.
But while those sitting around the large oval
table in the Excom room may be meeting to
gether for (he first time, the issues and prob
lf hi;; confronting them have been with us lor
many months.
Topic; if.'.'t over from last year which will
appear on Excom agendas this quarter include:
A report by the student government com
mittee which will.contain a new constitution
and set of bylaws for the ASSU. Excom will
evaluate the report and determine whether or
not to have a student referendum on the con
stitution this quarter.
Membership in the National Student's Asso
ciiition. Last year membership was on a trial
basis, and Ex corn will have to appropriate

money if the membership is continued this
year.
Implimentation of the recommendations of
last year's Honor Code committee.
These three issues alone are so serious and
far-reaching they could occupy more than one
quarter of discussion. Yet definite decisions
will be needed soon if students are to benefit
from them this year.
We feel sure the Excom members who meet
tonight realize the dual responsibility that i«
theirs—a responsibility to fairly represent the
opinions of the students who elected them and
a responsibility to think clearly and wisely
for themselves.
Tonight we will look for more than new faces.
We will look for new ideas and inspirations,
new decisions and solutions. Most of all we
will look for the leaders who will put new life
and meaning into Stanford student govern
ment.
