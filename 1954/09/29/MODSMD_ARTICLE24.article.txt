# To Reward Leadership
## 
### 
One of the most frequently-heard state
ments at Stanford is "Grades aren't every
thing." We hear it from our sponsors as fresh
men; it is implied in the publicity put out by
the extra-curricular activities; at times we have
even tried to convince our parents of the fact.
And now, thanks to the action of the Execu
tive Committee last spring, this statement has
taken on a fuller meaning.
It was all very well to be told that grades
weren't everything, but students seeking schol
arships found out that they were important.
They found out that the 30 or 40 hours a week
that they devoted to an activity didn't count

with the scholarship committee -what counted
was financial need and a B average.
Last spring Excom set up an entirely new
kind ol scholarship. Aptly entitled Leadership
Scholarships, they are awarded on -the basis
of financial need and leadership in extra-cur
ricular activities.
This fall, four students each received $250
in Leadership Scholarships. They are all active
in student affairs.
We applaud Excom's decision to endow this
new type of scholarship. An individual's con
tribution to and benefit from a university can
not be measured solely by the grades on his
transcript.
