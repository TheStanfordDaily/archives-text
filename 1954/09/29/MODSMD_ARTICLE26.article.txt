(Editor's note: This is the sec

sponsoved National Student Con
gress held at Aines, lowa, in Au
gust. Seven Stanford students at
tended the 10-day Congress.)

Managing Editor, The Daily
Delegates to the seventh an
nual National Student Congiess
adopted approximately 20 reso
lutions, ranging from Academic
Freedom to the Supreme Court
ruling on segregation.
Each of the resolutions was origi
nally drawn up by small groups of
delegates, meeting in sub-commis
sion sessions, then discussed and
perfected in larger commission
meetings, and finally presented to
the plenary floor for acceptance or
rejection by all of the 750 delegates.
Three days of the Congress were
devoted to plenary sessions and con
sideration of the resolutions.
The following is a brief summary
of some of the more important reso
lutions which were approved by the
Congress:
ACADEMIC FREEDOM
"The NSA believes that the only
grounds on which a professor should

be judged are his professional com
petence and integrity. Further, the
NSA reaffirms its belief in the demo
cratic process of law wherein an
individual is presumed innocent
until proven guilty. NSA believes
that a tribunal of one's faculty col
leagues is (the only body) competent
to determine the facts and judge
fairly the nature and degree of any
trespass upon academic integrity, as
well as the penalty such trespass
merits. (NSA condemns) the meth
ods of some of the current investi
gations into education as unjust and
unsatisfactory. The NSA further
believes that although an educator
should answer questions put to him
by investigating committees, his use
of the Fifth Amendment, or any
other applicable section of the Bill of
Rights or the Constitution, as his
reason for not replying to questions
concerning his views and affiliation
is not, in and of itself, justifiable
cause for dismissal."
McCARRAN AND COMMUNIST
CONTROL ACTS
"The Internal Security Act ol 1950
(McCarrun Act) and the Communist
Control Act of 1954 luive been inter
preted by a substantial part of the
educational community as restrict
ing free and intelligent discussion of

problems of general interest. NSA
believes that limitation of discussion
and inquiry on any subject is in
compatible with a free society. NSA
directs the National Affairs Vice-
Presiden,t to contact capable, judi
cious, and objective organizations to
. . . conduct a study of all portions
of these acts pertaining to the free
exchange of ideas in the academic
community."
SEGREGATION RULING
"The NSA, pledged to seeking the
elimination of segregation, urges the
swiftest possible integration of the
races at all educational levels, in
all parts of the country. There can
be no justification for delay in the
implementation of the Supreme
Court decision. We suggest the fol
lowing principles:
"1. The immediate ending of seg
regation in institutions of higher; ed
ucation in all geographic areas.
"2. The immediate desegregation
of all units of public education in
those states in which the cultural
pattern, distribution of population,
racial attitudes, and other conditions
warrant (the so-called 'border state
areas').
"3.The application of the principle
of selective desegregation beginning
immediately on a unit - school or
grade basis in those states in which
existing racial attitudes are more
.sharply defined.
"We further believe that teachers
should be integrated at a rate paral
lel with students and that school
boards and administrative officials

should exercise an attitude of fair
ness in assigning positions."
MILITARY MANPOWER
"The NSA, as the most representa
tive student voice in this country,
desires to take a more meaningful
role in the formulation of manpower
policy and in reflecting student opin
ion on this policy to the federal
government. The NSA shall estab
lish a Military Manpower Study
Commission ... to study all man
power policies which have been con
sidered and enacted in the past sev
eral years. It shall evaluate these
policies and recommend new ones or
such modifications of existing poli
cies as may seem advisable."
TAX RELIEF
"NSA endorses the principle of
further tax relief for the educational
expenses of students and persons re
sponsible for their support and rec
ommends action in support of such
legislative programs be undertaken
by the national office. The NSA fur
ther recommends that the National
Affairs Vice-President discuss with
appropriate persons and legislators
the possibility of obaining tax ex
empton for direct educational ex
penses; e.g., tuition, books, and re
quired student fees."

Managing Editor, The Daily
Delegates to the seventh an
nual National Student Congiess
adopted approximately 20 reso
lutions, ranging from Academic
Freedom to the Supreme Court
ruling on segregation.
Each of the resolutions was origi
nally drawn up by small groups of
delegates, meeting in sub-commis
sion sessions, then discussed and
perfected in larger commission
meetings, and finally presented to
the plenary floor for acceptance or
rejection by all of the 750 delegates.
Three days of the Congress were
devoted to plenary sessions and con
sideration of the resolutions.
The following is a brief summary
of some of the more important reso
lutions which were approved by the
Congress:
ACADEMIC FREEDOM
"The NSA believes that the only
grounds on which a professor should

be judged are his professional com
petence and integrity. Further, the
NSA reaffirms its belief in the demo
cratic process of law wherein an
individual is presumed innocent
until proven guilty. NSA believes
that a tribunal of one's faculty col
leagues is (the only body) competent
to determine the facts and judge
fairly the nature and degree of any
trespass upon academic integrity, as
well as the penalty such trespass
merits. (NSA condemns) the meth
ods of some of the current investi
gations into education as unjust and
unsatisfactory. The NSA further
believes that although an educator
should answer questions put to him
by investigating committees, his use
of the Fifth Amendment, or any
other applicable section of the Bill of
Rights or the Constitution, as his
reason for not replying to questions
concerning his views and affiliation
is not, in and of itself, justifiable
cause for dismissal."
McCARRAN AND COMMUNIST
CONTROL ACTS
"The Internal Security Act ol 1950
(McCarrun Act) and the Communist
Control Act of 1954 luive been inter
preted by a substantial part of the
educational community as restrict
ing free and intelligent discussion of

problems of general interest. NSA
believes that limitation of discussion
and inquiry on any subject is in
compatible with a free society. NSA
directs the National Affairs Vice-
Presiden,t to contact capable, judi
cious, and objective organizations to
. . . conduct a study of all portions
of these acts pertaining to the free
exchange of ideas in the academic
community."
SEGREGATION RULING
"The NSA, pledged to seeking the
elimination of segregation, urges the
swiftest possible integration of the
races at all educational levels, in
all parts of the country. There can
be no justification for delay in the
implementation of the Supreme
Court decision. We suggest the fol
lowing principles:
"1. The immediate ending of seg
regation in institutions of higher; ed
ucation in all geographic areas.
"2. The immediate desegregation
of all units of public education in
those states in which the cultural
pattern, distribution of population,
racial attitudes, and other conditions
warrant (the so-called 'border state
areas').
"3.The application of the principle
of selective desegregation beginning
immediately on a unit - school or
grade basis in those states in which
existing racial attitudes are more
.sharply defined.
"We further believe that teachers
should be integrated at a rate paral
lel with students and that school
boards and administrative officials

should exercise an attitude of fair
ness in assigning positions."
MILITARY MANPOWER
"The NSA, as the most representa
tive student voice in this country,
desires to take a more meaningful
role in the formulation of manpower
policy and in reflecting student opin
ion on this policy to the federal
government. The NSA shall estab
lish a Military Manpower Study
Commission ... to study all man
power policies which have been con
sidered and enacted in the past sev
eral years. It shall evaluate these
policies and recommend new ones or
such modifications of existing poli
cies as may seem advisable."
TAX RELIEF
"NSA endorses the principle of
further tax relief for the educational
expenses of students and persons re
sponsible for their support and rec
ommends action in support of such
legislative programs be undertaken
by the national office. The NSA fur
ther recommends that the National
Affairs Vice-President discuss with
appropriate persons and legislators
the possibility of obaining tax ex
empton for direct educational ex
penses; e.g., tuition, books, and re
quired student fees."
