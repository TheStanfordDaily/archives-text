# 'MERELY COMPETENT TREATMENT
## 'So Little Time' Called 'Fresh, Straightforward' 
### TOM ARP 
The 1951 British importation, "So Little Time," at the Guild has
as little to recommend it as it has to condemn it. It is merely a
competent treatment of an interesting story. There is not much
excitement, little suspense, and hardly a moment of top-notch
film technique.
Perhaps just for these reasons it is worth seeing, particularly if

you have become glutted with the
slick perfection of Hollywood's pro
ductions or the over-arty tricks of
many European companies. "So Lit
tle Time" has a story to tell, and it
tells it with a straightforward fresh
ness too often lacking in films of
late.
Adapted from a post-war Belgian
novel, "Je ne suis pas une heroine,"

it is the story of
a Belgian girl and
her experiences
with the German
occupation forces—
in particular, with
the German officer;
who is billeted in ■
her mother's home.

Because her father and two cous
ins were killed by the Germans, Ni
cole is so thoroughly convinced of
her hatred for the enemy that she
refuses to recognize her love for the
officer. Only his ability to play the
piano makes her realize her feelings,
and she is then thrown into the old
love-duty conflict.
Both Maria Schell as Nicole, and
Marius Goring, who portrays the
German, are competent actors. While
he may have a tendency to lean a
little heavily on the stereotype Prus
:ian officer charactrization, al
low himself to stare coldly just a bit
too often, it is interesting to notice
iow he makes love a plausible fac
tor in his personality.

Miss Schell is less restricted in her
role, and very convincingly ex
presses the emotional conflict her
part requires. The excellent piano
playing oi' Shura Cherkassky for
both Nicole and the officer is one
of the brighter stars in the other
wise gray firmament of the picture.
The short subject, "The Queen in
Australia," which accompanies the
picture, is evidence that the British
government is not going to allow
posterity to forget the glory of the
second Elizabeth. This is a film rec
ord of the queen's visit to the land
down under during January and
February. Unlike the fdming of the
coronation day, this one has bene
fited by some tactful editing. It suf
fers from few dull, drawn-out se
quences, and there are cricket
matches, horse racing, and surfboard
riding to heighten the interest.
Fortunately for American audi
ences, who for the most part are not
particularly excited by the mere
sight of a British monarch, there are
a good number of entertaining shots
of Australia minus the queen.

many European companies. "So Lit
tle Time" has a story to tell, and it
tells it with a straightforward fresh
ness too often lacking in films of
late.
Adapted from a post-war Belgian
novel, "Je ne suis pas une heroine,"

it is the story of
a Belgian girl and
her experiences
with the German
occupation forces—
in particular, with
the German officer;
who is billeted in ■
her mother's home.

Because her father and two cous
ins were killed by the Germans, Ni
cole is so thoroughly convinced of
her hatred for the enemy that she
refuses to recognize her love for the
officer. Only his ability to play the
piano makes her realize her feelings,
and she is then thrown into the old
love-duty conflict.
Both Maria Schell as Nicole, and
Marius Goring, who portrays the
German, are competent actors. While
he may have a tendency to lean a
little heavily on the stereotype Prus
:ian officer charactrization, al
low himself to stare coldly just a bit
too often, it is interesting to notice
iow he makes love a plausible fac
tor in his personality.

Miss Schell is less restricted in her
role, and very convincingly ex
presses the emotional conflict her
part requires. The excellent piano
playing oi' Shura Cherkassky for
both Nicole and the officer is one
of the brighter stars in the other
wise gray firmament of the picture.
The short subject, "The Queen in
Australia," which accompanies the
picture, is evidence that the British
government is not going to allow
posterity to forget the glory of the
second Elizabeth. This is a film rec
ord of the queen's visit to the land
down under during January and
February. Unlike the fdming of the
coronation day, this one has bene
fited by some tactful editing. It suf
fers from few dull, drawn-out se
quences, and there are cricket
matches, horse racing, and surfboard
riding to heighten the interest.
Fortunately for American audi
ences, who for the most part are not
particularly excited by the mere
sight of a British monarch, there are
a good number of entertaining shots
of Australia minus the queen.

The 1951 British importation, "So Little Time," at the Guild has
as little to recommend it as it has to condemn it. It is merely a
competent treatment of an interesting story. There is not much
excitement, little suspense, and hardly a moment of top-notch
film technique.
Perhaps just for these reasons it is worth seeing, particularly if

you have become glutted with the
slick perfection of Hollywood's pro
ductions or the over-arty tricks of
many European companies. "So Lit
tle Time" has a story to tell, and it
tells it with a straightforward fresh
ness too often lacking in films of
