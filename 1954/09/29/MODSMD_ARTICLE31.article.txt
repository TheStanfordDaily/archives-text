# Frosh Study Skills Talks Start Today
## 
### 
Stanford's Counseling and Testing
Center will offer freshmen a special
series of five lectures on Study Skills
this fall. This is the first time such
a series of lectures has been offered
for freshmen, acording to Dr. John
D. Black, director of the Center.
The lectures will be held at 4 p.m.
each Wednesday, starting today, in
two sections, one at the Village Au
ditorium and one in Encina Lounge.
They cover such subjects as organi
zation of study time, preparation for
exams, note taking, efficient methods
of studying for an assignment, and
vocational planning.
Dr. Henry A. Bamman, assistant
director of the Center, explained,
"Because we are unable to accom
modate all those who want to enroll
in our regular reading and study
skills course, we hope the lectures
wil' meet the needs of many fresh
men who would otherwise have to
wait until winter or spring quarter
for this work."
Dr. Bamman, along with Guy
Browning, senior counselor for the
Center, will be the lecturers. Bam
man is director of the Center's pro
gram of developmental and remedial
reading and serves as a consultant
on reading to public schools and in
dustrial firms.
Browning, in addition to his work
in the reading program, is in charge
of the Center's library of occupa
tional information.
