## 
### BELL NICHOLS

ing to organized basebal's final sta
tistics.
Card Baseball Coach Everett Dean
said, "ft is a pleasure to see so many
boys from Stanford giving profes
sional ball a try."
Dean said that Jack SJiepard and
Isol> Murphy both showed very
well this year, and that Murphy
had a very good chance of joining
Jack in the majors in the next few
seasons.
Shepard, who played only one
season of minor league ball before
• ticking with Pittsburgh, was the
outstanding Farm gracl of the year.
He got off to a spectacular start be
fore hitting a mid-season slump, but
picked up again through August and
September to hit .303 while catch
ing about half of the Pirate games.
Ray Swaits hit .368 for Phoenix
and collected 205 hits. He was sold
to Pittsburgh on the basis of his fine
stickwork, and will probably play
for Hollywood of the PCL next sum
mer.
Warren Goodrich, who was
named to the shortstop position
on the College All-America team
last spring, is another Indian who
may he in a Hollywood uniform
next year. Goodie got off to a slow
start with Salinas of the California
State League, hut finished with a
.2X5 hat mark and shone brilliantly
at times in his defensive work,
Dean said.
Channel Cities of the State League
had four ex-Stanfordites on its ros
ter. Dave Melton of the 1950 squad
was leading the league in hits and
KBf's before being called up by the
San Francisco Seals. With the Seals,
Melton hit .301 and was high in
banners and RBl's. though he played

only half the season with them.
Chuck Essegian, Don DeLong, and
Mike Acker, all Sacramento posses
sions, played for Channel Cities and
did well with a last-place team. Es
segian hit 25 homers and hit over
.300.
The Modesto Reds of the same
circuit won the championship,
thanks to the strong right arm of
Murphy. He had worked for Oak
land until mid - season in relief
roles. With Modesto, Murphy
hunff up 11 wins against only two
losses and hurled a o-l playoff
victory over San Jose.
Phil Page signed with Portland
following his graduation in June,
and worked for Victoria in the W.I.
league until the team folded in Au
gust.
Pitchers Rog Osenbaugh, Joe Chez,
and Dave Dahle are currently in the
military but should do well once

Twelve former Stanford baseball
ers who went into professional ranks
did very well this summer, accord
ing to organized basebal's final sta
tistics.
Card Baseball Coach Everett Dean
said, "ft is a pleasure to see so many
boys from Stanford giving profes
sional ball a try."
Dean said that Jack SJiepard and
Isol> Murphy both showed very
well this year, and that Murphy
had a very good chance of joining
Jack in the majors in the next few
seasons.
Shepard, who played only one
season of minor league ball before
• ticking with Pittsburgh, was the
outstanding Farm gracl of the year.
He got off to a spectacular start be
fore hitting a mid-season slump, but
picked up again through August and
September to hit .303 while catch
ing about half of the Pirate games.
Ray Swaits hit .368 for Phoenix
and collected 205 hits. He was sold
to Pittsburgh on the basis of his fine
stickwork, and will probably play
for Hollywood of the PCL next sum
mer.
Warren Goodrich, who was
named to the shortstop position
on the College All-America team
last spring, is another Indian who
may he in a Hollywood uniform
next year. Goodie got off to a slow
start with Salinas of the California
State League, hut finished with a
.2X5 hat mark and shone brilliantly
at times in his defensive work,
Dean said.
Channel Cities of the State League
had four ex-Stanfordites on its ros
ter. Dave Melton of the 1950 squad
was leading the league in hits and
KBf's before being called up by the
San Francisco Seals. With the Seals,
Melton hit .301 and was high in
banners and RBl's. though he played

only half the season with them.
Chuck Essegian, Don DeLong, and
Mike Acker, all Sacramento posses
sions, played for Channel Cities and
did well with a last-place team. Es
segian hit 25 homers and hit over
.300.
The Modesto Reds of the same
circuit won the championship,
thanks to the strong right arm of
Murphy. He had worked for Oak
land until mid - season in relief
roles. With Modesto, Murphy
hunff up 11 wins against only two
losses and hurled a o-l playoff
victory over San Jose.
Phil Page signed with Portland
following his graduation in June,
and worked for Victoria in the W.I.
league until the team folded in Au
gust.
Pitchers Rog Osenbaugh, Joe Chez,
and Dave Dahle are currently in the
military but should do well once
they get back to the diamond sport.
