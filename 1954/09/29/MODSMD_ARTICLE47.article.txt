MORE ROOMâ€”New wings to be added to Stern Hall will increase its capacity to about 430. The
new wings, being designed by San Francisco architects Spenser & Ambrose, are scheduled to
be completed in September 1955, University officials hope. The new additions, financed by
gifts from the estate of Mrs. Louis Stern, will cost an estimated $930,000 and will include addi
tional dining facilites as well as dormitory space. This architects' sketch shows the relation of
the new three-story units to the existing two-story wings.
