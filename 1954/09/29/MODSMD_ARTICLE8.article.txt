# Big Three Agree Over Sovereignty For West Germany
## 
### 
LONDON, Sept. 28 (UP)â€”The
nine-power conference on Eu
ropean defense split at its first
session today over how to con
trol German rearmament.
French Premier Pierre Mondes-
France put forward his own
"package plan" and refused to
give an inch.
The United States, Britain, and
*Francc agreed to restore German
sovereignty, but France demanded |
that it lie conditional on strict Ger- I
man armament controls. The end of
the first day found the delegates' far
apart.
Mendes - France's "package plan"
tied restoration of sovereignty to J
iron-clad controls and called for si
multaneous settlement of the long
disputed French and German claims
for control ol the coal-rich Saar.
He insisted on putting controls
under the Brussels Pact and refused
to budge under sharp questioning by
other foreign ministers. British For
eign Secretary Anthony Eden, with
U.S. backing, told the opposite view
that controls should come under
NATO.
Although the first day of the ecu- i
cial conference ended without
agrement, German sources said this
was only the first day and that, no
conclusion about the outcome of the
conference could be drawn from the
fir.'it split in views.
German sources warned in ad
vance that introduction of the ex
plosive Saar issue now would prove
a major roadblock to the rearming
of a sovereign West Germany on the
side of the West. Refusal to bargain
on this issue could wreck the con
ference.
British Foreign Secretary Anthony
Eden, who was made permanent |
chairman of the conference, began
today's session with a warning that
the future of Western unity and pos
sibly the survival of the free world
itself depended on this conference.
