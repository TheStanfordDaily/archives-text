### JOHN L. CUTTER United Press Staff Correspondent 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 (UP) —The death of Sen. Pat McCarran
(D-Nev.) adds to the difficulties facing the Democrats in their
fight to wrest control of the Senate from the Republicans in the
Nov. 2 elections.
McCarran's death at Hawthorne, Nev., Tuesday night left the

Senate lineup at 48 Republicans, 46
Democrats and Sen. Wayne Morse,
Oregon Independent. Thirty - six
seats are at stake in November, 28
outside the Democratic South.
Maine already has re-elected Re
publican Sen. Margaret Chase Smith.
In the November balloting, 10 Re
publican Senators will be up for re
election. Eleven Democratic Sena
tors will be up for re-election. Elev
en Democratic Senators outside the
"solid South" are seeking to hold on
to their posts.
Four Senate election races involve
no incumbents. In additions, special
elections for short terms are being
held in three states. Of these seven
seats, four now are held by Repub
licans and three by Democrats.
A political battle appeared to be
shaping up between Nevada Repub
licans and Democrats over whether
GOP Gov. Charles Russell could
name a Republican successor to Mc-
Carran, or whether both parties
should nominate candidates for the
November election.
In cither case, Democrats were
faced with an unexpected fight to
hold McCarran's old scat. They had
been sure of it before the Nevada
veteran's death since he would not
have been up for re-election until
1956.
Nevada Democratic State Chair
man Keith Lee today called a meet
ing of the Sate Central Committee
in Reno on Friday "for the purpose
of nominating a candidate."
Likewise, the Republican State
Central Committee was called to
session in Reno today to consider
possible nomination of a candidate
or a recommendation to the Gov
ernor on an appointment.
