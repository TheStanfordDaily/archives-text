WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 (UP) -
As part of a two-year Army pro
gram, draftees will be trained at
home but spend 17 of their 24 months
in the service overseas, Secretary
Robert T. Stevens disclosed today.
Stevens made the announcement
at a news "conference at which he
also revealed a major change in the
method of funneling troops over
seas. The plan is designed to bene
fit Gl's, spur rot-enlistments, and in
crease combat effectiveness.
The Army plans to build up from
19 to 24 combat divisions over the
next two years while continuing to
trim its overall manpower.
Under this plan, the Army, start
ing next summer, will rotate .men
overseas on a division rather than
on an individual basis. Each division
will serve 33 months overseas and
31 months in this country.
The Army Secretary said the new
Army goals will be achieved by con
verting five present training divi
sions into combat outfits.
Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway, Army
Chief of Staff, who also attended the
news conference, said the new out
fits will be eqftipped and organized
as combat divisions although he con
ceded they will be considerably un
der strength.
In discussing the new programs,
Ridgway said the Army will have
nine divisions assigned overseas as
far ahead as he can see. He said this
will include five divisons in Europe,
three in the Far East, and one in
Honolulu.
Stevens and Ridgway said the new
plan for adding five combat divi
sions is based on "conditions short
of general war." They said it will
be carried out "within current
strength and budget limitations."
The Army, which began the cur
rent fiscal year with 1,409.500 men,
is scheduled under present plans to
be down to 1,173,000 by next July 1
when the new fiscal year starts.
Stevens said the step-up in divi
sions in the face of declining man
power will be achieved by increased
efficiency and transfer of personnel
from non-combat to combat assign
ments.
He said that by next June 30 about
(50 percent of the Army will be in
the operating—or field—forces. He
said this would be an increase of
about 10 percentage points since
June, 1953, when the Army began
its drive to get rid of "chair jock
eys."

its drive to get rid of "chair jock
eys."
WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 (UP) -
As part of a two-year Army pro
gram, draftees will be trained at
home but spend 17 of their 24 months
in the service overseas, Secretary
Robert T. Stevens disclosed today.
Stevens made the announcement
at a news "conference at which he
also revealed a major change in the
method of funneling troops over
seas. The plan is designed to bene
fit Gl's, spur rot-enlistments, and in
crease combat effectiveness.
The Army plans to build up from
19 to 24 combat divisions over the
next two years while continuing to
trim its overall manpower.
Under this plan, the Army, start
ing next summer, will rotate .men
overseas on a division rather than
on an individual basis. Each division
will serve 33 months overseas and
31 months in this country.
The Army Secretary said the new
Army goals will be achieved by con
verting five present training divi
sions into combat outfits.
Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway, Army
Chief of Staff, who also attended the
news conference, said the new out
fits will be eqftipped and organized
as combat divisions although he con
ceded they will be considerably un
der strength.
In discussing the new programs,
Ridgway said the Army will have
nine divisions assigned overseas as
far ahead as he can see. He said this
will include five divisons in Europe,
three in the Far East, and one in
Honolulu.
Stevens and Ridgway said the new
plan for adding five combat divi
sions is based on "conditions short
of general war." They said it will
be carried out "within current
strength and budget limitations."
The Army, which began the cur
rent fiscal year with 1,409.500 men,
is scheduled under present plans to
be down to 1,173,000 by next July 1
when the new fiscal year starts.
Stevens said the step-up in divi
sions in the face of declining man
power will be achieved by increased
efficiency and transfer of personnel
from non-combat to combat assign
ments.
He said that by next June 30 about
(50 percent of the Army will be in
the operating—or field—forces. He
said this would be an increase of
about 10 percentage points since
June, 1953, when the Army began
its drive to get rid of "chair jock
eys."
