# SUBVERSIVE GROUPS LISTED
## AROTC Men Must Sign New Revised Loyalty Oath 
### 
A new policy of the Federal Government has brought the loy
alty oath to the Stanford campus, some students found this week.
Students enrolling in the Army ROTC program were asked to
sign a specific oath that they had never been a member of any
subversive organization.
On the two-page form were listed what the Armed Forces con-

sider subversive activities, plus
a long list of all organizations
considered to be subversive.
Students enrolling in all the ROTC
departments here at Stanford have
always been required to sign a loy
alty oath, according to ROTC offi
cials. Formerly, however, the stu
dent was merely asked to certify that
he had never belonged to any or
ganization which conspired to teach
and advocate the overthrow of the
Federal Government by force or
violence.
The new form lists in detail the
conditions which the Attorney Gen
eral's office considers "subversive."
In addition it lists some 256 organi
zations, such as the Young Com
munist League, the German-Amer
ican Bund, Palo Alto Peace Club,
and the North American Spanish Aid
Committee, which have been named
subversive by that office.
The new form went into effect on
February 1, 1954, but was not re
quired here at Stanford for students
until the fall influx of ROTC candi
dates. All members of the Armed
Forces, including ROTC staff mem
bers here at Stanford, were required
to sign the form soon after it came
out.
Col. Peter J. Kopsaek, command
er of the Army ROTC detachment
here, made it clear that there is no
change in the Armed Services' policy
toward loyalty oaths. He pointed out
that the new form merely specifies
what is considered subversive be
havior.
He said "It has always been tiic
policy to require persons to sign a
loyalty certificate; however, form
erly the certificate was not so spe
cific. No change has been made as
far as requiring a certification of
loyalty, the only difference being
that the new form is now very clear
and specific, designating organiza T
tions which are subversive.
He went on to say "the Problem
at Stanford does not exist as it does
at land-grant universities, where
students are required to enroll in
the ROTC program."
Kopsaek explained that at Stan
ford, enrollment is entirely volun
tary, ancl that if a student wishing
to enroll failed to sign the loyalty
oath, he would be taken into the
program on an informal status,
which would mean that he would
not receive his Service Commission
on graduation, and would get no pay
or uniform allowance while he was
an ROTC student.
Officials of all three ROTC de
tachments on campus said that so
far there had been no refusal to
sign a loyalty oath by any student.
