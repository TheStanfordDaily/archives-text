# England Promises to Maintain Troops, Air Power on Continent
## Move Follows Dulles Threat 
### 
LONDON, Sept. 29 (UP) — A
historic decision by Britain to
reverse its traditional policy and
maintain troops and air power
on the continent sent the nine
nation conference on European
defenses surging forward on a
new note of optimism tonight.
Britain's promise to abandon its
policy of aloofness from the conti
nent during the life of the 50-year
Brussels pact and a stern act-now
warning from United States Secre
tary of State John Foster Dulles
seemed to assure the conferences
success.
The British decision announced by
Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden
was a tremendous victory for French
Premier Pierre Mendes-France but
at the same time served notice that
—with its greatest single demand yet
—France now must bear full re
sponsibility for success or failure of
European unity.
French and German sources said
also that tentative agreement was
reached on at least part of the
French demand to place control of
German rearmament under the
Brussels Pact instead of the North
Atlantic Treaty organization.
Dulles, before the conference,
bluntly warned that Western Eu
rope faced the prospect of Ameri
can withdrawal from the continent
unless there was an agreement now
on defense plans.
Eden then told the nine-nation
meeting Britain will pledge to keep
its troops on the continent if the
conference succeeds in an agreement
on German rearmament. He said
Britain promised in that case not to
withdraw its present four divisions
and tactical air foice without the
consent of the Brussells Treaty na
tions.
French representatives were de
scribed as gratified over Britain's
"historic" concession to European
unity. France has insisted that Brit
ish divisions serve alongside French
troops on the continent, to balance
the power of Germany. Fear of Ger
man rearmament without a solid
commitment from Britain was one of
the main reasons the French killed
EDC.
Afterward West German Chancel
lor Konrad Adenauer told a press
conference "the London conference
will successfully end tomorrow night
or Friday morning at the latest."
