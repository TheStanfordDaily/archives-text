# Enrollment Totals 6,840
## 
### 
With the official period of regis
tration at a close, Stanford's enroll
ment for 1954-55 showed a slight
drop-off from last year's figures at
the end of registration. According
to the Registrar's Office, 4,921 men
and 1,919 women registered during
the two-day period, for a total of
6,840 students now enrolled.
At the end of the reg period last
year the total enrollment stood at
6,892, with the ratio of men to wom
en at 2.56 to 1. The 1952 ratio came
to 2.69 men per woman, while in
1951 the figure at the end of reg
period was 2.54 to 1. This year's
ratio, figured the other way, makes
a total of 0.391 woman for each man
student. The Registrar's Office
warned, however, that such ratios
calculated now are misleading, since
there is a special registration period
this Saturday for teachers, who are
predominantly men.
Registrar Harvey D. Hall said that
he was unable to predict the total
enrollment, since it will still be pos
sible to register late for the next
three weeks.
