# Denial of Understanding
## 
### 
When considering problems that span thou
sands of miles and deal with individuals in
vastly different situations, facts often become
inexorably entwined with assumption.
Such is the case with the two ASSU foreign
scholars who have been denied visas by the
American consul in their country.
News concerning Kyi Whan Kim of South
Korea and Petar Macanovic of Yugoslavia has
come io Stanford only through letters from the
students themselves.
No word has been received from the United
States State Department or from the consuls
involved as to the official reasons for denying
them entrance to this country.
However, after looking at the facts, we can
make some assumptions which seem to be
valid. The facts, briefly, are these:
Both students had met the scholastic quali
fications for Stanford and had been selected
by the Foreign Scholarship Committee and
campus living groups as ASSU foreign schol
ars for 1954-55.
Both were in good health, had a working
knowledge of the English language, and could
claim a means of support. Neither were crim
inals.
Thus we can assume they had met the gen
eral qualifications for admittance with one not
able exception- security.

At this point all the facts were not in. The
specific reasons why the consuls considered
these two students possible security risks are
not known.
What is known is that two students who are
qualified and sincere in their desire to study in
the United States are still in their homes.
If they have had communist connections,
their one big chance to learn of democracy
first hand has been denied them.
If they are victims of circumstance, the frus
tration and disappointment they must feel at
being barred from the United States does little
to further the spirit of international gpod-will.
The Foreign Scholarship co-chairmen have
written to Washington for information and ex
planation. If, as the two chairmen hope, the
difficulties are of a technical nature, Kim and
Macanovic may yet enroll as Stanford students
next year.
In the meantime we have the ironic situation
of three groups of people in three parts of the
world trying to span the miles between them
by living and talking and thinking togetherâ€”
and being halted by a government which seeks
peace as its primary goal.
This is not the way to get an education or to
answer the challenge of communism. It is
hardly the path to a greater understanding
among the peoples of the world.
