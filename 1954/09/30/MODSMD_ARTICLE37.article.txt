## Giants Top Indians, 5-2, On Rhodes' Home Run 
### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 29 (UP) —Raging Dusty Rhodes, his anger
mounting as he rode the bench, spent his spleen on the Cleveland
Indians today with a three-run pinch-hit homer in the 10th inning
which swept the underdog New York Giants to a 5 to 2 victory
in the opening game of the World Series.

Through 10 tense innings before
record Polo Grounds World Series
crowd of 52,751, the husky 27-year
old from Mathews, Ala., had steamed
on the bench — enraged at being
passed up by Manager Leo Durocher
in lavor of another outfielder.
But in the 10th, with Willie Mays
and Hank Thompson on base
through a pair of walks, the Giants
finally turned to the man who so
often had come through for them as
a pinch-hitter, and Dusty didn't let
them down.
'Dusty at the Bat'
He went up there swinging his bat
viciously and stepped into the first
pitch to send it screaming into the
right field stands. And as it soared
into the seats, the crowd sent forth
a mighty ovation which rocked the
ancient green and gray horseshoe
shaped stadium and ricocheted off
the red brick faces of the apartment
houses towering in the background.
It was a heart-breaking ending for
chunky Bob Lemon, the 23 - game
ace of the favored Indians. For he
had pitched a steady, stout-hearted
game through nine grueling innings.

But as Rhodes sent his pitch power
ing up into the seats tossed
his glove high into the air and went
down to defeat.
As the Giants came up in the 10th,
Mueller went down swinging. Next
Lemon looked down the lane and
there was the menacing Mays. Bob
wavered slightly and walked Willie
and then, after Mays stole second
on his first pitch to Thompson, gave
Thompson an intentional walk.
That's when Rhodes came out of
the dugout with anger riding his
shoulders.
Bitter Batter
He was bitter when the game
opened as Durocher picked Irvin to
play in the outfield instead of giving
him the assignment.
Nor was Rhodes mad any longer
as, a grin a mile wide on his face, he
stood with Durocher's arm around
his shoulders and heard the skipper
of the battling Giants announce that
tomorrow it will be young Johnny
Antonelli. a 2l-game winner, against
23-game winning Early Wynn of the
Indians.

finally turned to the man who so
often had come through for them as
a pinch-hitter, and Dusty didn't let
them down.
'Dusty at the Bat'
He went up there swinging his bat
viciously and stepped into the first
pitch to send it screaming into the
right field stands. And as it soared
into the seats, the crowd sent forth
a mighty ovation which rocked the
ancient green and gray horseshoe
shaped stadium and ricocheted off
the red brick faces of the apartment
houses towering in the background.
It was a heart-breaking ending for
chunky Bob Lemon, the 23 - game
ace of the favored Indians. For he
had pitched a steady, stout-hearted
game through nine grueling innings.

But as Rhodes sent his pitch power
ing up into the seats tossed
his glove high into the air and went
down to defeat.
As the Giants came up in the 10th,
Mueller went down swinging. Next
Lemon looked down the lane and
there was the menacing Mays. Bob
wavered slightly and walked Willie
and then, after Mays stole second
on his first pitch to Thompson, gave
Thompson an intentional walk.
That's when Rhodes came out of
the dugout with anger riding his
shoulders.
Bitter Batter
He was bitter when the game
opened as Durocher picked Irvin to
play in the outfield instead of giving
him the assignment.
Nor was Rhodes mad any longer
as, a grin a mile wide on his face, he
stood with Durocher's arm around
his shoulders and heard the skipper
of the battling Giants announce that
tomorrow it will be young Johnny
Antonelli. a 2l-game winner, against
23-game winning Early Wynn of the
Indians.

NEW YORK, Sept. 29 (UP) —Raging Dusty Rhodes, his anger
mounting as he rode the bench, spent his spleen on the Cleveland
Indians today with a three-run pinch-hit homer in the 10th inning
which swept the underdog New York Giants to a 5 to 2 victory
in the opening game of the World Series.

Through 10 tense innings before
record Polo Grounds World Series
crowd of 52,751, the husky 27-year
old from Mathews, Ala., had steamed
on the bench — enraged at being
passed up by Manager Leo Durocher
in lavor of another outfielder.
But in the 10th, with Willie Mays
and Hank Thompson on base
through a pair of walks, the Giants
finally turned to the man who so
often had come through for them as
a pinch-hitter, and Dusty didn't let
them down.
