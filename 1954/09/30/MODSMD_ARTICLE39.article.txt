# Taylor Happy With Practice
## 
### 
Stanford's footballers, preparing I
for Saturday's contest against llli- j
nois, drew praise from Card Coach i
Chuck Taylor yesterday for then
practice session.
For the second straight day, Tay
lor jvas very happy about the per
formance of his gridders in practice.
They held a 40-minute scrimmage
session, emphasizing running offense
against simulated Illini defenses.
Indian end John Stewart remains
a question mark for the nationally
televised tilt. Stewart, an ace high
jumper on the track team, sprained
an ankle when he came down on a
football in the Oregon game. Stew
art again reported for practice, but
did not wear pads.
Two reserve players have also
been injured this week, and they j
too are question marks. Fullback
Jarvis Watson twisted ankle
yesterday. He will be examined
j today to definitely determine the
I extent of the injury, but trainer
I Connie Jarvis said the injury did
! not look serious.
Halfback Jim Sarah pulled a leg
muscle in Tuesday's practice, but
did not report the injury until yes
terday when it continued to bother
him. He was not suited up, and is
a more doubtful participant than
Watson. «•
Taylor's starting lineup for the
Illini tilt will be announced today.
If Stewart can't play, Jim McCamant
will be moved to his left end post,
and Steve Docter will start at the
right end slot. • . V-
