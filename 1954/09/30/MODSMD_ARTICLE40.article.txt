# Shepard Returns From Majors With .303 Mark
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
There is in the United States a very select group of about 400
young men whose job every summer is that of a major league
baseball player. One of this select group is Jack Shepard, star
catcher of the Pittsburgh Pirates, who has returned to Stanford
this quarter after completing his first full season in the National
League. ▼

Shepard, who batted a hefty .303
in 82 games for the Pirates, is now
a Resident Assistant at Enoina Hall
and is studying in the Graduate
School of Business as well as work
ing for his Master's in physical ed
ucation.
Shepard, who started off fast this
past season, tailed oft' in his hitting
during July and August, but came
on strong again toward the end of
the year, attributes his final success
to "more confidence as the year went
along."
"For the last month and a half I
was swinging real good with power,"
Shepard said, "and I was catching
and throwing good too. 1 felt I could
do the job if given the chance."
Thinking of baseball of the cur
rent moment, we asked Jack who
he thought would win the World
Series.
Giant Rooter
"I hope New York wins the se
ries," he replied, and I think they
will win because they have the bet
ter defensive club. Alvin Dark, their

shortstop, is the key to the club;
he's a heads-up fielder and hitter
who always seems to make the big
play. As far as I am concerned he's
the top man on the team, not Willie
Mays."
Getting back to his own season,
we asked Jack who was the National
League pitcher who gave him the
most trouble and we got a surpris
ing answer.
"They're all tough, of course," he
stated, "but Steve Ridzik, sidearm
right - hander of the Philadelphia
Phillies, seemed to be extra tough.
Johnny Antonelli of the G'ants gave
me trouble too.'"
Who was the toughest man in the
league to pitch to?
"Hank Sauer of the Cubs hurt us
all year," Shepard answered, "and
Ted Kluszewski of Cincinnati had
some good day.'. - against us. Sur
prisingly. we had good success in
getting Stan Musial of the Cardinals
out."
"Did the Pirates give you much
coaching and many tips throughout
4vc season?" we psked.
' "Fred Haney, the Pirate manager,

and Clyde Sukeforth, a coach, helped
me a lot," Shepard replied. "So did
Walker Cooper, veteran catcher,
when he was with the ball club."
Free Rein
"While I was catching, though,
they gave me a free rein to call the
pitches to let me get experience,"
Jack said.
"However, let me add," Shepard
stated, "that we at Stanford are for
tunate to have coaches like Everett
Dean and Billy Alhouse who can
help ball players prepare for pro
fessional baseball. T'he number of
Stanford players in recent years who
had success in playing professional
baseball shows what kind of coaches
they are."
