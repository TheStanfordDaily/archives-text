STARTING THE QUARTER WITH FANFARE—Between 1.300 and 1,400 Stanford students
crowded into the Pavilion last night to dance to the music of Spike Lynch and his Stardusters
at the fall quarter Registration Dance, Fanfare, which was sponsored by the Stanford Band and
Kappa Kappa Psi. Decorations for the dance were cutouts of band instruments.
