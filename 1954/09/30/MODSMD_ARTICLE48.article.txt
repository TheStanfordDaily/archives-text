he leaves the stacks.
2. Upon leaving the stacks, he
must stop at the portal desk to have
his books inspected and charged out.
3. Students and faculty are re

they have taken from the shelves.
They should be left on stack tables
or window ledges for reshelving by
library attendants.
Stack entrance privileges are

bers and to graduate students. Spe
cial permits will be issued to under
graduates upon recommendation of
a faculty member.
