WASHINGTON. Sept. 29 (UP) -
Senator William E. Jenner (R., Ind.)
criticized the Watkins committee to
day for proposing "fair play"
changes in Senate rules in its report
recommending censure of Senator
Joseph R. McCarthy.
Jenner said he will ask Chairman
Arthur V. Watkins (R., Utah) of the
censure group to testify, if he wishes,
before the Senate Rules Committee
which has been holding hearings on
the subject.
Jenner, who is chairman of the
Rules Committee, said the Watkins
committee should have held up its
rules recommendations in view of
the study being made by a regular
standing committee.
He said he was interested in the
fact that the Watkins group recom
mended that at least two Senators
always be present when witnesses
are questioned before a committee.
He said that on one occasion the
censure committee took testimony
when only Watkins was present. He
referred to the questioning of the
Senate parliamentarian.
Jenner said he did not feel the
censure group had adequate time to
study the rule changes which it pro
posed in the report recommending
that McCarthy be censured by the
Senate.
Jenner, who like McCarthy has
been an active Communist investi
gator, also has said he disagrees with
the censure committee's findings.
