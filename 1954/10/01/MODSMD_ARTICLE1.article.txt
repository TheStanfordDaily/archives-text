### 
UNITED NATIONS, New York, Sept. 30 (UP) â€”Russia introduced a new and sweeping dis
armament plan in the United Nations today, including a drastic arms slash and prohibition of
weapons of mass destruction such as the A-bomb.
Soviet Chief Delegate Andrei Y. Vishinsky offered the plan at the end of a one-hour and 41
minute'speech in the General Assembly.
U. S. Delegate Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., said in a statement issued immediately after the meeting:
"The United States will consider this proposal objectively and with the sincere hope that it

will prove to be a real step toward
a comprehensive, effective, and
workable disarmament."
The plan seems to mark an ad
vance over the previous Soviet po
sition, Lodge said. But he warned
that the test of good faith was still
to come.
British Chief Delegate Selwyn
Lloyd, due to speak in Assembly de
bate tomorrow, postponed his speech
until Monday so he could consult his
government on the Russian plan.
Vishinsky swept over the whole
range of world problems in laying
down the Kremlin's policy line for
the current ninth U.N. annual As
sembly.
He hammered away at the theme
of "peaceful co-existence," accused
the United States and its allies of
fomenting war, and said peaceful
settlement of all world problems is
possible.
Then he charged that the United
States, though it has launched an
"atoms for peace" plan, still bases its
whole policy on force, including the
use of atomic weapons.
Concluding, he dramatically of
fered his government's plan for "re
duction of armaments and the prohi
bition of atomic, hydrogen, and other
types of weapons of mass destruc
tion."
