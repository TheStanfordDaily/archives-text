# Undefeated Cardinals Meet Illinois Tomorrow
## 
### DON WEBSTER Sports Editor, The Daily 
A power-packed Illinois football eleven, generally acknowl
edged to have the finest running backfield in collegiate football,
will invade Stanford Stadium tomorrow to face a ready and willing
Stanford team in a nationally televised game.
The Indians are undefeated after two games, while the Illini

have lost their only contest this sea
son. Yet the visitors are rated a 13 to
20 point favorite, and with good
reason.
Coach Ray Eliot's club features the
most feared backfield in football to
day. J. C. Caroline, who last season
broke Red Grange's Illinois rushing
record, will team at halfback with
Mickey Bates. They are tough men
to stop—each of them gained over
200 yards more last season than any
Stanford ball carrier.
The Illini had a third outstanding
running back — sophomore Abe
Woodson. But he, besides being in
jured, did not live up to expectancy
last week and Bates has been shafted
from fullback to half, where he played
last year, to fill the gap. Bob Wiman
will start at fullback.
The Illini were upset last week
by Penn State, but Stanford
coaches don't believe that means
they're a weak team. Card men
tors base their respect on the fol
lowing points;
1. Illinois is traditionally a- slow
starter. Last season they could only
tie Nebraska in their opener, 21-21,
and were not too impressive in beat
ing Stanford the following week, 33-
21. They went on to tie for the Big
Ten championship, though.
2. Penn State has a heavily under
rated team, and had scouted Illinois
well before the game.
3. Illinois, in playing Penn State,
faced a team four times better than
last year's Nebraska opener. Yet this
year they were outscored only on
conversions (final score: 14-12).
Though Card Coach Chuck Tay-


QUITE A TRlO—Here are three of the backfield
men who will face Stanford's footballers in tomor
row's Illinois game. J. C. Caroline (left), was rated
an Ail-American last season, though only a sopho
more at the time. He piled up a total of 1,256 yards
rushing to smash the old Illinois marks held by Red
Grange for rushing and total offense. Last week,


when the Illini were upset by Penn State, he was
"held" to a net 115 yards running. Quarterback
Em Lindbeck (center) won a tough battle for the
starting quarterback berth on the team. Illinois is
not primarily a passing team this season, so he won't
get too much opportunity to throw the ball. Mickey


Bates (right) was shifted from fullback this week
and will team with Caroline at the halfback spots.
Bates gained 602 yards rushing last year (by com
parison, Ron Cook led Stanford's rushers in 1953
with 424 yards), yet had to play second fiddle to
Caroline. He is a fine blocker in addition, and on
many occasions was the key to Caroline's success.
