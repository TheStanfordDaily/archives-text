# Undefeated Cardinals Meet Illinois Tomorrow
## 
### DON WEBSTER Sports Editor, The Daily 
A power-packed Illinois football eleven, generally acknowl
edged to have the finest running backfield in collegiate football,
will invade Stanford Stadium tomorrow to face a ready and willing
Stanford team in a nationally televised game.
The Indians are undefeated after two games, while the Illini

have lost their only contest this sea
son. Yet the visitors are rated a 13 to
20 point favorite, and with good
reason.
Coach Ray Eliot's club features the
most feared backfield in football to
day. J. C. Caroline, who last season
broke Red Grange's Illinois rushing
record, will team at halfback with
Mickey Bates. They are tough men
to stop—each of them gained over
200 yards more last season than any
Stanford ball carrier.
The Illini had a third outstanding
running back — sophomore Abe
Woodson. But he, besides being in
jured, did not live up to expectancy
last week and Bates has been shafted
from fullback to half, where he played
last year, to fill the gap. Bob Wiman
will start at fullback.
The Illini were upset last week
by Penn State, but Stanford
coaches don't believe that means
they're a weak team. Card men
tors base their respect on the fol
lowing points;
1. Illinois is traditionally a- slow
starter. Last season they could only
tie Nebraska in their opener, 21-21,
and were not too impressive in beat
ing Stanford the following week, 33-
21. They went on to tie for the Big
Ten championship, though.
2. Penn State has a heavily under
rated team, and had scouted Illinois
well before the game.
3. Illinois, in playing Penn State,
faced a team four times better than
last year's Nebraska opener. Yet this
year they were outscored only on
conversions (final score: 14-12).

QUITE A TRlO—Here are three of the backfield
men who will face Stanford's footballers in tomor
row's Illinois game. J. C. Caroline (left), was rated
an Ail-American last season, though only a sopho
more at the time. He piled up a total of 1,256 yards
rushing to smash the old Illinois marks held by Red
Grange for rushing and total offense. Last week,


when the Illini were upset by Penn State, he was
"held" to a net 115 yards running. Quarterback
Em Lindbeck (center) won a tough battle for the
starting quarterback berth on the team. Illinois is
not primarily a passing team this season, so he won't
get too much opportunity to throw the ball. Mickey


Bates (right) was shifted from fullback this week
and will team with Caroline at the halfback spots.
Bates gained 602 yards rushing last year (by com
parison, Ron Cook led Stanford's rushers in 1953
with 424 yards), yet had to play second fiddle to
Caroline. He is a fine blocker in addition, and on
many occasions was the key to Caroline's success.
lor has displayed pleasure with
(his week's workouts, the team
will he handicapped by the loss of
two first stringers. End John
Stewart suffered a sprained ankle
last week against Oregon, and will
see limited action, if any. Jim Mc-
Camant has been moved to Stew
art's left end post, and big Steve
Docter will start at right end.
Guard Roy Krickeberg has a leg
injury, and also will not start. Matt
Armitage has been moved to his
right guard slot, and Tony Mosich
will take over the left guard duties.
Krickeberg can also see only lim
ited action.
Stanford's starting backfield will be
the same: John Brodie at quarter
back, Ernie Dorn and Gordy Young
at halfbacks, and Bill Tarr at full.
Several other injuries have oc
curred this week to reserve players.
Guard Paul Revak fractured his
hand Wednesday night, and will be
lost for two weeks. Halfback Jim

Saras, who has a leg strain, will
also not suit up. Tackle Win Wedge
has been hospitalized 24 hours with
the flu. but will be ready for action.
Only good news injury-wise is
that the ankle injury of second
string fullback Jarvis Watson is not
as serious as was feared. He will be
ready for action come gametime.
Pay Eliot's squad arrived last night
and is staying at Rickey's. This aft
ernoon they will hold an informal
practice session at the Stadium.
Stanford's grid fortunes so far
this year are a familiar story. They
squeeked by in their first game
over COP, 13-12, thanks to a boot
leg play by Brodie. In their sec
ond outing, they took advantage
of a number of Oregon miscues
to upset the highly-touted Ducks,
18-13.
A fine pass catch by Young scored
one if the vital TDs against Oregon.
In the first game, he rambled 24
yards on another vital play. Brodie
and Tarr were key men in the first
two Card wins.
Last week, Tarr rambled 55 yards
for the winning touchdown, and
against COP scored both of the
touchdowns. Dorn has showed fine
blocking, tackling' and ball-carrying
ability, though he hasn't yet reached
the peak he obtained last season as
a 'Sophomore, but the coaches know
his potential.
Though this may sound like a
top-notch brickfield, it can't com
pete with the visitors. Caroline

chalked up a fabulous 1,256 yards
rushing last season. Bates was not
far behind, besides being a fine
blocker for Caroline. Both are
juniors this season.
The visitor's team isn't perfect,
and Ray Eliot agrees that it is far
from the best squad he ever
coached. In the line, Jim Smid is
the top player, and a candidate for
Ail-American at the guard spot.
Smid, standing 5-11 and weighing
196, combines speed with aggress
iveness, and should give Card line
men plenty of trouble. However,
after that the quality dwindles con
siderably.
Don Tate, the other top guard, is
injured, and will see little or no ac
tion. Their ends, Dean Renn and
Charles Butler are as
are their tackles, Roger Wolf and
Floyd McAfee. Wolf is the only let
terman of the group. Their center
is Jack Chamblin.
The quarterback spot for the
Illini, like Stanford, was wide open
at the beginning of the season.
Em Lindbcck has earned the first
string berth and will be their
starter tomorrow.
Because of the unsure quality of
both the quarterback and ends, the
Illini didn't do much passing last
week: even though they were be
hind, they threw only 10 passes, com
pleting 4 and having one inter
cepted. So the Indians expect to
moet little but a strong ground
game of the Illini.
Docter and McCamant will be the
starting ends, with Paul Wiggin and
Chris Marshall starting again at the
tackle slots.- A'rmitage and iMosich
will be at guards,' and Jerry Gold
berg, who diti an Outstanding
a linebacker last week, will draw the
call at center.

not primarily a passing team this season, so he won't
get too much opportunity to throw the ball. Mickey


Bates (right) was shifted from fullback this week
and will team with Caroline at the halfback spots.
Bates gained 602 yards rushing last year (by com
parison, Ron Cook led Stanford's rushers in 1953
with 424 yards), yet had to play second fiddle to
Caroline. He is a fine blocker in addition, and on
many occasions was the key to Caroline's success.
lor has displayed pleasure with
(his week's workouts, the team
will he handicapped by the loss of
two first stringers. End John
Stewart suffered a sprained ankle
last week against Oregon, and will
see limited action, if any. Jim Mc-
Camant has been moved to Stew
art's left end post, and big Steve
Docter will start at right end.
Guard Roy Krickeberg has a leg
injury, and also will not start. Matt
Armitage has been moved to his
right guard slot, and Tony Mosich
will take over the left guard duties.
Krickeberg can also see only lim
ited action.
Stanford's starting backfield will be
the same: John Brodie at quarter
back, Ernie Dorn and Gordy Young
at halfbacks, and Bill Tarr at full.
Several other injuries have oc
curred this week to reserve players.
Guard Paul Revak fractured his
hand Wednesday night, and will be
lost for two weeks. Halfback Jim

Saras, who has a leg strain, will
also not suit up. Tackle Win Wedge
has been hospitalized 24 hours with
the flu. but will be ready for action.
Only good news injury-wise is
that the ankle injury of second
string fullback Jarvis Watson is not
as serious as was feared. He will be
ready for action come gametime.
Pay Eliot's squad arrived last night
and is staying at Rickey's. This aft
ernoon they will hold an informal
practice session at the Stadium.
Stanford's grid fortunes so far
this year are a familiar story. They
squeeked by in their first game
over COP, 13-12, thanks to a boot
leg play by Brodie. In their sec
ond outing, they took advantage
of a number of Oregon miscues
to upset the highly-touted Ducks,
18-13.
A fine pass catch by Young scored
one if the vital TDs against Oregon.
In the first game, he rambled 24
yards on another vital play. Brodie
and Tarr were key men in the first
two Card wins.
Last week, Tarr rambled 55 yards
for the winning touchdown, and
against COP scored both of the
touchdowns. Dorn has showed fine
blocking, tackling' and ball-carrying
ability, though he hasn't yet reached
the peak he obtained last season as
a 'Sophomore, but the coaches know
his potential.
Though this may sound like a
top-notch brickfield, it can't com
pete with the visitors. Caroline

chalked up a fabulous 1,256 yards
rushing last season. Bates was not
far behind, besides being a fine
blocker for Caroline. Both are
juniors this season.
The visitor's team isn't perfect,
and Ray Eliot agrees that it is far
from the best squad he ever
coached. In the line, Jim Smid is
the top player, and a candidate for
Ail-American at the guard spot.
Smid, standing 5-11 and weighing
196, combines speed with aggress
iveness, and should give Card line
men plenty of trouble. However,
after that the quality dwindles con
siderably.
Don Tate, the other top guard, is
injured, and will see little or no ac
tion. Their ends, Dean Renn and
Charles Butler are as
are their tackles, Roger Wolf and
Floyd McAfee. Wolf is the only let
terman of the group. Their center
is Jack Chamblin.
The quarterback spot for the
Illini, like Stanford, was wide open
at the beginning of the season.
Em Lindbcck has earned the first
string berth and will be their
starter tomorrow.
Because of the unsure quality of
both the quarterback and ends, the
Illini didn't do much passing last
week: even though they were be
hind, they threw only 10 passes, com
pleting 4 and having one inter
cepted. So the Indians expect to
moet little but a strong ground
game of the Illini.
Docter and McCamant will be the
starting ends, with Paul Wiggin and
Chris Marshall starting again at the
tackle slots.- A'rmitage and iMosich
will be at guards,' and Jerry Gold
berg, who diti an Outstanding
a linebacker last week, will draw the
call at center.
A power-packed Illinois football eleven, generally acknowl
edged to have the finest running backfield in collegiate football,
will invade Stanford Stadium tomorrow to face a ready and willing
Stanford team in a nationally televised game.
The Indians are undefeated after two games, while the Illini

have lost their only contest this sea
son. Yet the visitors are rated a 13 to
20 point favorite, and with good
reason.
Coach Ray Eliot's club features the
most feared backfield in football to
day. J. C. Caroline, who last season
broke Red Grange's Illinois rushing
record, will team at halfback with
Mickey Bates. They are tough men
to stop—each of them gained over
200 yards more last season than any
Stanford ball carrier.
The Illini had a third outstanding
running back — sophomore Abe
Woodson. But he, besides being in
jured, did not live up to expectancy
last week and Bates has been shafted
from fullback to half, where he played
last year, to fill the gap. Bob Wiman
will start at fullback.
The Illini were upset last week
by Penn State, but Stanford
coaches don't believe that means
they're a weak team. Card men
tors base their respect on the fol
lowing points;
1. Illinois is traditionally a- slow
starter. Last season they could only
tie Nebraska in their opener, 21-21,
and were not too impressive in beat
ing Stanford the following week, 33-
21. They went on to tie for the Big
Ten championship, though.
2. Penn State has a heavily under
rated team, and had scouted Illinois
well before the game.
3. Illinois, in playing Penn State,
faced a team four times better than
last year's Nebraska opener. Yet this
year they were outscored only on
conversions (final score: 14-12).

Last week, Tarr rambled 55 yards
for the winning touchdown, and
against COP scored both of the
touchdowns. Dorn has showed fine
blocking, tackling' and ball-carrying
ability, though he hasn't yet reached
the peak he obtained last season as
a 'Sophomore, but the coaches know
his potential.
Though this may sound like a
top-notch brickfield, it can't com
pete with the visitors. Caroline

chalked up a fabulous 1,256 yards
rushing last season. Bates was not
far behind, besides being a fine
blocker for Caroline. Both are
juniors this season.
The visitor's team isn't perfect,
and Ray Eliot agrees that it is far
from the best squad he ever
coached. In the line, Jim Smid is
the top player, and a candidate for
Ail-American at the guard spot.
Smid, standing 5-11 and weighing
196, combines speed with aggress
iveness, and should give Card line
men plenty of trouble. However,
after that the quality dwindles con
siderably.
Don Tate, the other top guard, is
injured, and will see little or no ac
tion. Their ends, Dean Renn and
Charles Butler are as
are their tackles, Roger Wolf and
Floyd McAfee. Wolf is the only let
terman of the group. Their center
is Jack Chamblin.
The quarterback spot for the
Illini, like Stanford, was wide open
at the beginning of the season.
Em Lindbcck has earned the first
string berth and will be their
starter tomorrow.
Because of the unsure quality of
both the quarterback and ends, the
Illini didn't do much passing last
week: even though they were be
hind, they threw only 10 passes, com
pleting 4 and having one inter
cepted. So the Indians expect to
moet little but a strong ground
game of the Illini.
Docter and McCamant will be the
starting ends, with Paul Wiggin and
Chris Marshall starting again at the
tackle slots.- A'rmitage and iMosich
will be at guards,' and Jerry Gold
berg, who diti an Outstanding
a linebacker last week, will draw the
call at center.
A power-packed Illinois football eleven, generally acknowl
edged to have the finest running backfield in collegiate football,
will invade Stanford Stadium tomorrow to face a ready and willing
Stanford team in a nationally televised game.
The Indians are undefeated after two games, while the Illini

have lost their only contest this sea
son. Yet the visitors are rated a 13 to
20 point favorite, and with good
reason.
Coach Ray Eliot's club features the
most feared backfield in football to
day. J. C. Caroline, who last season
broke Red Grange's Illinois rushing
record, will team at halfback with
Mickey Bates. They are tough men
to stop—each of them gained over
200 yards more last season than any
Stanford ball carrier.
The Illini had a third outstanding
running back — sophomore Abe
Woodson. But he, besides being in
jured, did not live up to expectancy
last week and Bates has been shafted
from fullback to half, where he played
last year, to fill the gap. Bob Wiman
will start at fullback.
The Illini were upset last week
by Penn State, but Stanford
coaches don't believe that means
they're a weak team. Card men
tors base their respect on the fol
lowing points;
1. Illinois is traditionally a- slow
starter. Last season they could only
tie Nebraska in their opener, 21-21,
and were not too impressive in beat
ing Stanford the following week, 33-
21. They went on to tie for the Big
Ten championship, though.
2. Penn State has a heavily under
rated team, and had scouted Illinois
well before the game.
3. Illinois, in playing Penn State,
faced a team four times better than
last year's Nebraska opener. Yet this
year they were outscored only on
conversions (final score: 14-12).

QUITE A TRlO—Here are three of the backfield
men who will face Stanford's footballers in tomor
row's Illinois game. J. C. Caroline (left), was rated
an Ail-American last season, though only a sopho
more at the time. He piled up a total of 1,256 yards
rushing to smash the old Illinois marks held by Red
Grange for rushing and total offense. Last week,


when the Illini were upset by Penn State, he was
"held" to a net 115 yards running. Quarterback
Em Lindbeck (center) won a tough battle for the
starting quarterback berth on the team. Illinois is
not primarily a passing team this season, so he won't
get too much opportunity to throw the ball. Mickey


Bates (right) was shifted from fullback this week
and will team with Caroline at the halfback spots.
Bates gained 602 yards rushing last year (by com
parison, Ron Cook led Stanford's rushers in 1953
with 424 yards), yet had to play second fiddle to
Caroline. He is a fine blocker in addition, and on
many occasions was the key to Caroline's success.
lor has displayed pleasure with
(his week's workouts, the team
will he handicapped by the loss of
two first stringers. End John
Stewart suffered a sprained ankle
last week against Oregon, and will
see limited action, if any. Jim Mc-
Camant has been moved to Stew
art's left end post, and big Steve
Docter will start at right end.
Guard Roy Krickeberg has a leg
injury, and also will not start. Matt
Armitage has been moved to his
right guard slot, and Tony Mosich
will take over the left guard duties.
Krickeberg can also see only lim
ited action.
Stanford's starting backfield will be
the same: John Brodie at quarter
back, Ernie Dorn and Gordy Young
at halfbacks, and Bill Tarr at full.
Several other injuries have oc
curred this week to reserve players.
Guard Paul Revak fractured his
hand Wednesday night, and will be
lost for two weeks. Halfback Jim

Saras, who has a leg strain, will
also not suit up. Tackle Win Wedge
has been hospitalized 24 hours with
the flu. but will be ready for action.
Only good news injury-wise is
that the ankle injury of second
string fullback Jarvis Watson is not
as serious as was feared. He will be
ready for action come gametime.
Pay Eliot's squad arrived last night
and is staying at Rickey's. This aft
ernoon they will hold an informal
practice session at the Stadium.
Stanford's grid fortunes so far
this year are a familiar story. They
squeeked by in their first game
over COP, 13-12, thanks to a boot
leg play by Brodie. In their sec
ond outing, they took advantage
of a number of Oregon miscues
to upset the highly-touted Ducks,
18-13.
A fine pass catch by Young scored
one if the vital TDs against Oregon.
In the first game, he rambled 24
yards on another vital play. Brodie
and Tarr were key men in the first
two Card wins.
Last week, Tarr rambled 55 yards

Coach Ray Eliot's club features the
most feared backfield in football to
day. J. C. Caroline, who last season
broke Red Grange's Illinois rushing
record, will team at halfback with
Mickey Bates. They are tough men
to stop—each of them gained over
200 yards more last season than any
Stanford ball carrier.
The Illini had a third outstanding
running back — sophomore Abe
Woodson. But he, besides being in
jured, did not live up to expectancy
last week and Bates has been shafted
from fullback to half, where he played
last year, to fill the gap. Bob Wiman
will start at fullback.
The Illini were upset last week
by Penn State, but Stanford
coaches don't believe that means
they're a weak team. Card men
tors base their respect on the fol
lowing points;
1. Illinois is traditionally a- slow
starter. Last season they could only
tie Nebraska in their opener, 21-21,
and were not too impressive in beat
ing Stanford the following week, 33-
21. They went on to tie for the Big
Ten championship, though.
2. Penn State has a heavily under
rated team, and had scouted Illinois
well before the game.
3. Illinois, in playing Penn State,
faced a team four times better than
last year's Nebraska opener. Yet this
year they were outscored only on
conversions (final score: 14-12).
Though Card Coach Chuck Tay-


QUITE A TRlO—Here are three of the backfield
men who will face Stanford's footballers in tomor
row's Illinois game. J. C. Caroline (left), was rated
an Ail-American last season, though only a sopho
more at the time. He piled up a total of 1,256 yards
rushing to smash the old Illinois marks held by Red
Grange for rushing and total offense. Last week,


when the Illini were upset by Penn State, he was
"held" to a net 115 yards running. Quarterback
Em Lindbeck (center) won a tough battle for the
starting quarterback berth on the team. Illinois is
not primarily a passing team this season, so he won't
get too much opportunity to throw the ball. Mickey


Bates (right) was shifted from fullback this week
and will team with Caroline at the halfback spots.
Bates gained 602 yards rushing last year (by com
parison, Ron Cook led Stanford's rushers in 1953
with 424 yards), yet had to play second fiddle to
Caroline. He is a fine blocker in addition, and on
many occasions was the key to Caroline's success.
lor has displayed pleasure with
(his week's workouts, the team
will he handicapped by the loss of
two first stringers. End John
Stewart suffered a sprained ankle
last week against Oregon, and will
see limited action, if any. Jim Mc-
Camant has been moved to Stew
art's left end post, and big Steve
Docter will start at right end.
Guard Roy Krickeberg has a leg
injury, and also will not start. Matt
Armitage has been moved to his
right guard slot, and Tony Mosich
will take over the left guard duties.
Krickeberg can also see only lim
ited action.
Stanford's starting backfield will be
the same: John Brodie at quarter
back, Ernie Dorn and Gordy Young
at halfbacks, and Bill Tarr at full.
Several other injuries have oc
curred this week to reserve players.
Guard Paul Revak fractured his
hand Wednesday night, and will be
lost for two weeks. Halfback Jim

Saras, who has a leg strain, will
also not suit up. Tackle Win Wedge
has been hospitalized 24 hours with
the flu. but will be ready for action.
Only good news injury-wise is
that the ankle injury of second
string fullback Jarvis Watson is not
as serious as was feared. He will be
ready for action come gametime.
Pay Eliot's squad arrived last night
and is staying at Rickey's. This aft
ernoon they will hold an informal
practice session at the Stadium.
Stanford's grid fortunes so far
this year are a familiar story. They
squeeked by in their first game
over COP, 13-12, thanks to a boot
leg play by Brodie. In their sec
ond outing, they took advantage
of a number of Oregon miscues
to upset the highly-touted Ducks,
18-13.
A fine pass catch by Young scored
one if the vital TDs against Oregon.
In the first game, he rambled 24
yards on another vital play. Brodie
and Tarr were key men in the first
two Card wins.
Last week, Tarr rambled 55 yards
for the winning touchdown, and
against COP scored both of the
touchdowns. Dorn has showed fine
blocking, tackling' and ball-carrying
ability, though he hasn't yet reached
the peak he obtained last season as
a 'Sophomore, but the coaches know
his potential.
Though this may sound like a
top-notch brickfield, it can't com
pete with the visitors. Caroline

chalked up a fabulous 1,256 yards
rushing last season. Bates was not
far behind, besides being a fine
blocker for Caroline. Both are
juniors this season.
The visitor's team isn't perfect,
and Ray Eliot agrees that it is far
from the best squad he ever
coached. In the line, Jim Smid is
the top player, and a candidate for
Ail-American at the guard spot.
Smid, standing 5-11 and weighing
196, combines speed with aggress
iveness, and should give Card line
men plenty of trouble. However,
after that the quality dwindles con
siderably.
Don Tate, the other top guard, is
injured, and will see little or no ac
tion. Their ends, Dean Renn and
Charles Butler are as
are their tackles, Roger Wolf and
Floyd McAfee. Wolf is the only let
terman of the group. Their center
is Jack Chamblin.
The quarterback spot for the
Illini, like Stanford, was wide open
at the beginning of the season.
Em Lindbcck has earned the first
string berth and will be their
starter tomorrow.
Because of the unsure quality of
both the quarterback and ends, the
Illini didn't do much passing last
week: even though they were be
hind, they threw only 10 passes, com
pleting 4 and having one inter
cepted. So the Indians expect to
moet little but a strong ground
game of the Illini.
Docter and McCamant will be the
starting ends, with Paul Wiggin and
Chris Marshall starting again at the
tackle slots.- A'rmitage and iMosich
will be at guards,' and Jerry Gold
berg, who diti an Outstanding
a linebacker last week, will draw the
call at center.
