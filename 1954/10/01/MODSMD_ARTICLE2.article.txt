# AT RICKEY'S
## Juniors Hold Reunion Today 
### 
Juniors will gather in Rickey's
Rose Room this afternoon from 3
to 6 for the Junior Reunion.
Stan Wilson, singer and guitar
player from the hungry i in San
Francisco, will entertain with ca
lypso, blues, and folk songs. Be
tween songs, Wilson will autograph
his records and albums. The singer
has just returned to the hungry i
after a six-month tour of the coun
try.
Rides to the reunion for those who
signed up yesterday will leave from
the Post Oflice at 2:30, 3, 4, and 5.
Wilson will arrive at the reunion
soon after it begins.
Originally scheduled for Chez
Yvonne, the affair was moved to
Rickey's Rose Room because of the
additional space available there.
There is also ample parking space.
The reunion is open to all mem
bers of the class of '56. There is no
admission charge. Student body
cards, however, will be necessary for
admission.
