## 
### 
Stanford's men students will per
form 16 card stunts before an esti
mated 35,000 fans in the stadium and
millions more on the nationally tele
vised "Game of the Week."
It will be the second appearance
of Stanford card stunts on a na
tional hook-up, the first being the
Michigan game two years ago which
the Cards won 14-7.
The following stunts will be dis
played at half time:
STUNT 1 — The rooting section
will come up with a completely
black field, and a metallic-gold "HI"
will be written throughout the black
field.
STUNT 2 and 6—With the HI still
showing, the section will gradually
become an all white field, obliterat
ing the "HI." First a metallic-red
spot will appear in the white field.
The spot will grow out in rings—
as would appear in water —then a
large Indian head will appear
throughout the rings.
STUNTS 7 and B—Number8 —Number seven
will be the word "WELCOME" giv r
en in green letters on a white field,
and number eight will be "58" given
in metallic-red letters on a white
field.
STUNTS 9 and 15—These stunts
are a series showing the Stanford
Indian and the Illinois Indiaij smok
ing the "peace" pipe. The Stanford
Indian will have one feather for a
headdress while the Illinois Indian
will have a large headdress. No. 9 is
the words, "PIPE DREAM" in green
on a white field. No. 10 is the
words, "ENDS IN" in blue on a
white field. No. 11 is the words
"NITE MARE" in black in a white
field. The following four stunts are:
No. 12, the Stanford Indian hands a
peace pipe to the Illinois Indian; No.
13, the pipe flares up as the Illinois
Indian takes a puff on it; No. 14, a
large explosion and No. 15, the Stan
ford Indian is shown holding the
Illinois Indian's headdress as he looks
down at the ashes at his feet.
STUNT 16—The Signature stunt
shows a large Block "S" in metallic
red cards on a white field. As the
numbers 1-15 are called, the Stan
ford Tree grows up through the
"S".
