## "Yes, Dear" "Yes, Dear" "Yes, Dear" New Role for Britain 
### 
When the nine-nation conference on Euro
pean defense concludes this weekend, one fact
will have been established.
Great Britain is again the leading nation in
Europe.
Not since the end of World War II have the
British been so vitally concerned with the de
fense of the continent.
Foreign Secretary. Anthtany Eden's promise
of British forces to serve alongside the French
is a sharp reversal of their former "hands-off"
policy. It is also the basis for much of the
optimism currently emmenating from London.
This new look in British foreign policy was
evident right after the French parliament voted
down EDC.

While the United States State Department
wallowed amidst wails of consternation and
confusion, Eden flew to Berlin, Paris, and Rome
to line up support for the nine-power meeting.
When the conference opened, Eden threw
his full support behind Dulles' "do it now or
else" demand. The decision reached yester
day to bring Germany and Italy into the Brus
sels Pact is a tribute to their combined states
manship.
At a time when so much depends on the suc
cess of European defense, it is heartening to
find our closest ally assuming a full share of
responsibility. The United States—and Europe
—has long needed that support.
