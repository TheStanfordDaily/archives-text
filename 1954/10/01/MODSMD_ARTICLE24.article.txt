# Off to a Good Start

### 
If Wednesday night's meeting of the Execu
tive Committee was any indication of things to
come, we can predict nothing but an efficient
and productive series of Excom sessions this
year.
With Honor Code, NSA, the new ASSU Con
stitution, and many other important and contro
versial issues coming up for consideration, we
commend Excom's attempt to more carefully
plan their agenda each week. Individual mem
bers were urged to study the issues more
thoroughly before they are presented to the
entire body in the form of motions.
We also like the Committee's decision to

schedule their biggest issues for specific times
on the agenda. This will clearly be an added
incentive for more student participation in Ex
com meetings, since it will mean that interested
students will not have to sit through the reports
and other detailed procedures which must be
presented each week.
The issues which will face the Committee
this year are important, and much considera
tion will have to go into the decisions which
will be made.
The goals for which Excom will be aiming
are apparent; after sitting in on Wednesday
night's meeting, we are confident those goals
will be reached.
