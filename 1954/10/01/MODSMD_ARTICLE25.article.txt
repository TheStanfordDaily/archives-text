# BULL SESSION
## 
### DICK MANSFIELD 
A group of idlers lolled about in the Daily nev/sroom
yesterday afternoon contemplating Dusty Rhodes and
the Giants when a New Face, attached to a lanky
youth, moved through the Daily Shack and out the
back door. A silence fe'l.
"Who was he?"
"A fresh tryout!"
"I guess it's that time of year . . ."
You could indeed tell it is Daily tryout time once
more. One can no more than sit down at a typewriter
l>efore he is being pointed out to wide-eyed frosh as
one of the architectural features of The Daily's "plant."
"This is the typewriter," some guide will say, patting
you on the head. "Gollies," the freshman will say.
Well-meant cynicism aside, the Dailv staff is always

happy to see new tryoutees. And
this year they get to see a lot of
them: sixty hopefuls for the edi
torial side have signed a list which
has marched down off the bulletin
board onto the floor in the course
of signups. What's further, each
and every one of these hopefuls
who wishes to go through the try
outs program will become a mem
ber of the Daily Staff.
"So what?" says a voice. So the

Daily Staff Is a fine group, fraught with esprit dc corps
and the old University Attitude, and dedicated to
publishing, once a weekday, everything current and
topical at Stanford University. This includes perti
nent dispatches from the United Press and certain of
the bits of campus opinion which drift into the Shack

after every controversial misprint (example: last night,
The Daily submitted a bit of copy to the back shop
which mentioned Tim Moore, the Junior Class presi
dent. Back from the back shop it came, and the Jun
ior Class president was Tom Bing, according to the
linotype operator. Pete Bing, ASSU President, stoutly
maintains that there is no relationship. Tim Moore
is planning to sue).
This is why we have Daily tryouts. Tryoutees sit
at the copy desk, po-ring over The Daily for proof
errors such as this. They also write very short head
lines for very long stories ("But how can you get
'existential calculus' into 11 counts?"—any freshman)
and write stories about the Placement Service. We
must have tryoutees, because upperclassmen tend to
let proof errors slip by after-a certain amount of time,
and dislike writing short headlines for long stories
("You can't get 'existential calculus" into 11 counts!"
—any sophomore) er writing stories about Place
ment Service.
But all this leads to better things, for in a very
short time the erstwhile tryoutee will be wonderinp
what he can possibly tell the new tryoutee that won't
be trite.
Tryoutees and prospective tryoutees interested ir
hearing whether the current Editorial Board has es
caped the onus of the trite should plan to attend the
first tryout meeting this afternoon at 3:30 at the Dailj
Shack. Editor Pat King, Sports Editor Don Webster
Head Photographer Ken Green, and many other not
ables will speak; it's likely to be an interesting l

Daily Staff Is a fine group, fraught with esprit dc corps
and the old University Attitude, and dedicated to
publishing, once a weekday, everything current and
topical at Stanford University. This includes perti
nent dispatches from the United Press and certain of
the bits of campus opinion which drift into the Shack

after every controversial misprint (example: last night,
The Daily submitted a bit of copy to the back shop
which mentioned Tim Moore, the Junior Class presi
dent. Back from the back shop it came, and the Jun
ior Class president was Tom Bing, according to the
linotype operator. Pete Bing, ASSU President, stoutly
maintains that there is no relationship. Tim Moore
is planning to sue).
This is why we have Daily tryouts. Tryoutees sit
at the copy desk, po-ring over The Daily for proof
errors such as this. They also write very short head
lines for very long stories ("But how can you get
'existential calculus' into 11 counts?"—any freshman)
and write stories about the Placement Service. We
must have tryoutees, because upperclassmen tend to
let proof errors slip by after-a certain amount of time,
and dislike writing short headlines for long stories
("You can't get 'existential calculus" into 11 counts!"
—any sophomore) er writing stories about Place
ment Service.
But all this leads to better things, for in a very
short time the erstwhile tryoutee will be wonderinp

A group of idlers lolled about in the Daily nev/sroom
yesterday afternoon contemplating Dusty Rhodes and
the Giants when a New Face, attached to a lanky
youth, moved through the Daily Shack and out the
back door. A silence fe'l.
"Who was he?"
"A fresh tryout!"
"I guess it's that time of year . . ."
You could indeed tell it is Daily tryout time once
more. One can no more than sit down at a typewriter
l>efore he is being pointed out to wide-eyed frosh as
one of the architectural features of The Daily's "plant."
"This is the typewriter," some guide will say, patting
you on the head. "Gollies," the freshman will say.
Well-meant cynicism aside, the Dailv staff is always

happy to see new tryoutees. And
this year they get to see a lot of
them: sixty hopefuls for the edi
torial side have signed a list which
has marched down off the bulletin
board onto the floor in the course
of signups. What's further, each
and every one of these hopefuls
who wishes to go through the try
outs program will become a mem
ber of the Daily Staff.
