# Public Affairs Luncheon Meetings Feature Hot and Varied Discussions
## 
### RUTH WOLPE 
Hot discussions and hot lunches
are standard commodities at the
Public Affairs luncheon group.
While downing home-cooked UO-cent
lunches, the members talk over
problems of current public interest.
The ijroup will meet for the first
time tliis quarter Monday noon on
the third floor of the Women's Club
house. The topic will be "Should
the United States Defend Formosa?"
The group began four years ago as
a public affairs forum over Stan
ford's radio station KZSU. As inter
est grew, a luncheon group was sub
stituted for the radio program.
In the past such topics as academic

freedom, McCarthy ism, FEPC, capi
tal punishment, and birth control
have been mulled over. Two sug
gested topics lor forthcoming lunch
eons are: "What ethical standards
should apply to legislators?" and
"Should a scientist follow his own
beliefs and ethics or those of his j
employer: The Oppenheimer Case."
A typical discussion begins in an
aura of coffee and dessert. A very
brief preliminary presentation of the
topic is made to clarify the quesion
and introduce the subject. Then the
moderator starts the venerable "ball"
on its erratic course.
The moderator's job includes ev
erything from being referee and

peacemaker to being soother of ruf
fled feathers in time for one o'clock
classes.
There are experts and novices, but
all freely expound their points of
view—not always with dignity, but
always to the enjoyment and inter
est of all.
Carl Stover of the Political Sci
ence Department will moderate
Monday's discussion on the Formosa
question. Ruth Wolpe is chairman
of the group.
An invitation is extended to new
students and transfers to be on hand
