I WAS AWARDED A RIBBON
AND PROMPTLY PUT IT IN MY TYPEWRITER
First of all —how come?
How do 1 come to be writing a column for Philip Morris in your
campus newspaper?
I'll tell you how come:
' It all began on a summer night. The air was warm, the sky was
full of stars, and I sat in a cane-bottomed chair on my verandah,
peaceful and serene, smoking a cigarette, humming the largo from
Death and Transfiguration, and worming my dog.
Into this idyllic scene came a stranger —a tall, clean limbed
stranger, crinkly-eyed and crooked-grinned, loose and lank. "How
do you do," he said. "My name is Loose Lank and I am with the
Philip Morris people."
"Enchanted," I said. "Take off your homburg and sit down." I
clapped my hands. "Charles!" I called. "Another chair for Mr. Lank."
Obediently my dog trotted away and returned directly with a
fan-back chair of Malayan rattan. He is the smartest dog in our block.
"I'm sorry I don't have a Morris chair," I said to Mr. Lank. "That
would be rather more appropriate — you being with Philip Morris
and all."
Well, sir, we had many a laugh and cheer over my little witticism.
When we had finished laughing and cheering, we wiped our eyes and
Mr. Lank pulled out a fresh package of Philip. Morris. He yanked
the tape and the pack sprang open with a fetching little snap.
"Did you hear that fetching little snap?" asked Mr. Lank.
"Yes," I said, for I did.
"Cigarette?" he said.
."Thank you," I said.
Wo puffed contentedly for three or four hours. Then Mr. Lank
said, "I suppose you're wondering why I'm here."
"Well," I replied, my old eyes twinkling, "I'll wager you didn't
come to read my meter."
, You can imagine how we howled at that one!
"That's a doozy!" cried Mr. Lank, giggling wildly. "I must re
member to tell it to Alice when I get home."
"Your wife?" I said.
"My father," he said.
\ "Oh," I said.
"Well," he said, "let's get down to business ... How would you like
to write a campus column for Philip Morris?"
, "For money?" 1 said.
1 "Yes," he said.
"My hand, sir," I said and clasped his. Warmly he returned the
pressure, and soft smiles played on our lips, and our eyes were bright
with the hint of tears, and we were silent, not trusting ourselves
to speak.
I "Cigarette?" he said at length.
I nodded.
We lit up and puffed contentedly for eight or ten hours. "I under
stand you've made quite a study of college students," said Mr. Lank.
"Yes," I said, blushing modestly. "I have been collecting them for
years. I have over four thousand students in my basement right now."
"In mint condition?" he said incredulously.
"Students don't come in mint condition," 1 explained. "They go to
great expense to acquire the 'beat-up look.'"
"How interesting," he said. "Tell me something more about them —
their feeding habits, for example."
"They are omnivores of prodigious appetite," 1 said. "It is wise
not to leave food about when they are present. Their favorite food
is a dish called the Varsity Gasser — one scoop raspberry ice, one
scoop raw hamburger, leechee nuts and maple syrup."
"Fascinating," said Mr. Lank. "And what are students interested
in chiefly?"
"Each other," I replied. "Roy students are interested in girl
students, and girl students are interested in boy students."
"This seems to me an admirable arrangement," said Mr. Lank.
"But is it true even in these parlous days of worldwide tension and
dreadful armaments?"
"It is always true," I said. "It isn't that college students don't
know what's going on in the world. They know all too well. They're
perfectly aware of the number of lumps waiting for them ... But
meanwhile the limbs are springy and the juices run strong and
time is fleeting." I
"What will you write about in your column?" asked Mr. Lank.
"About boys and girls," I said. "About fraternities and sororities
and dormitories and boarding houses and dances and sleighrides
and hayrides and cutting classes and going to classes and cramming
for exams and campus politics and the profits of bookstores and con
vertibles and BMOCs and BWOCs and professors who write new
texts every year and the world's slowest humans — the page boys
at the library."
"And will you say a pleasant word about Philip Morris from time
to time?" asked Mr. Lank.
"Sir," I replied, "I can think of no othev kind of word to say about
Philip Morris."
We shook hands again then, and smiled bravely. Then he was gone
— a tall silhouette moving erectly into the setting sun. "Farewell,
good tobacconist!" I cried after him. "Aloha, aloha!"
And turned with a will to my typewriter. <?m« siiuim«n, 1031
