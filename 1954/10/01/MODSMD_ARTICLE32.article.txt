# Giants Whip Indians Again, 3-1
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 30 (UP) —
Young Johnny Antonelli realized a
dream today when he took an ass ; st
from yesterday's hero, Dusty
Rhodes, and then personally pitched
and batted the New York Giants to
a 3 to 1 second straight World Series
victory over the frustrated Cleve
land Indians.
The 24-year-old Antonelli was a
sad-eyed rookie who didn't even put
on a uniform when his team played
in the World Series six years ago.
But he was a bright-eyed young
man, long on courage, today as he
gave up a home run with his first
pitch and then slammed the door in
the faces of 13 Indian base runners
to chalk up a grueling eight-hit tri
umph.
And the one-time $G5,000 "bonus

baby" sent Indian ace Early Wynn
down to defeat with his bat as well
as his arm before 49,099 excited
fans. For after Rhodes again had
come off the bench to tie the score,
with a pinch single, it was Johnny
who outlegged a possible double play
relay to send home the winning run.
Dusty Rhodes had come in as a
pinch-hitter to tie up the score in
the fifth, and the Alabama boy "iced
it" for Antonelli with a towering
seventh-inning home run against the
upper right field facade—his third
straight hit.
His white flannels stained with
sweat, Antonelli appeared to be tir
ing as the final inning came up and
he was greeted by singles off the
bats of A 1 Smith — the man who
touched him for that first - inning
homer —and Bobby Avila, the Amer
ican League batting champion.
That's when Johnny really poured
that last ball in there. Rearing back,
he threw three straight pitches past
Larry Doby, and then saw Smith go
to third as Rudy Regalado forced
Avila at second when the Giants
missed a game-ending double play.
Vic Wertz, the leading hitter in
the Series, strode up there then, and
once the ball almost got away from
Johnny for a wild pitch. But finally
he sent one blazing in there which
Wertz sent flying out to left center
field and Antonelli had the game of
which he long has dreamed as
Rhodes—the man who helped him to
victory—grabbed it.
Just as in the first game, which
they lost, the Indians jumped into a
first-inning lead when Smith, the
rangy outfielder from Kirkwood,
Mo., stepped into Antonelli's first
pitch and sent it sailing high onto
the left field roof for a home run.
Not a player moved in his tracks as
the ball curved toward the foul line
but stayed fair by several yards.
Throwing a wide assorment, the
sweat-stained Wynn set the Giants
down in perfect order until the
top of the fifth. There he got behind
the menacing Mays, leading off, and

gave him a free trip to first on a
walk. Thompson followed with the
first Giant hit of the game, a single
to right on which Mays galloped all
the way to third.
That's when the Giants once more
called on Rhodes, the home run hero
of the first game, and again he came
through.
Striding off the bench, Rhodes
took a ball and two strikes and then
looped a single into center. Mays
scored and Thompson moved to
third, drawing a throw on which
Rhodes went all the way to second.
Davey Williams went down swing
ing but then Wynn got behind Wes
Westrum. with three straight balls,
and put him on intentionally to fill
.the bases.
Antonelli helped his cause then
with his speed afoot. He bounced
to Avila, forcing Westrum, but out
legged Strickland's double play re
lay to first as Thompson raced home
to give the Giants a 2 to 1 lead they
never lost.
It was a big one for the underdog
Giants, this second straight victory,
for they shift to Cleveland's Munici
pal Stadium tomorrow for a third
and fourth—and fifth game if neces
sary. And there it will be burly
Mike Garcia, a 19-8 pitcher for the
Indians, against slender Ruben Go
mez, whose mark was 17 and 9 for
the Giants this season.
The Giants can only hope that
Gomez will do as well as the one
time bonus "baby" who grew up in
the Polo Grounds today.
