BIG MANâ€”Steve Docter is a 6-3, 220-pound end for the Stan
ford team. Though hampered so far this season with a heel in
jury, he has been battling on fairly even terms with Jim Mc-
Camant for the starting spot. He'll get his chance to start tomor
row, for McCamant has been shifted to left end to replace the
injured John Stewart. Docter, a junior, was a standout on the
frosh team two years ago, but did not turn out for football last
season.
