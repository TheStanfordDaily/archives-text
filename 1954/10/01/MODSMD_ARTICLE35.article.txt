# Braves Meet Cal Ramblers In Preliminary
## 
### 
The Stanford Braves seek their
third win of the season tomorrow
at 11 a.m. in the Stadium, when they
meet California's Ramblers.
Coach Mai EI ward's junior varsity
has won two straight games already
this year, while the Blues, coached
by Carl Van Heuit, have won two
and lost one. The Ramblers whipped
the Cal Aggies 33-6 and scored a
big 40-6 win over Treasure Island
last Saturday. Their defeat was to
Phib Pac 20 to 14.
Stanford, led by quarterback
Jack Lewis, beat Alameda MAS
two weeks ago by a 27 to 7 count
anil got by the Presidio soldiers
113-24 in a free scoring game.
Coach Van Heuit, an Ail-Ameri
can safety man on Cal's Rose Bowl
teams of a few years ago, will have
many lower echelon varsity players
at his command since Waldorf can
take only 36 Bears back to the Ohio
State game. However, many late in
juries in the California ranks make
it uncertain just who will be in the
starting Rambler lineup.
This is the first of a two-game
series between the two teams.
Stanford won both tilts last year
by 12-6 and 20-12 scores.
The starting lineup for the Braves
has Frank Hook, Phil Ritzau, V/alt
Eagle, Don Geddes, Wes Wedge,
Dale Smith, and Carl Isaacs in the
line, and Jack Lewis, Jerry Angove,
Jim Truher, and Scott Jones operat
ing in the backfield.
