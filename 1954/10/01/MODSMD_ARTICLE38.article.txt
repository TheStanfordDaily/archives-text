# Stadium Gets New Seats, New Electric Scoreboard
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
When Stanford roughs and rooters settle down in their seats for
the Illinois game tomorrow afternoon, they will be sitting on new
bleachers—purchased from the University of California.
And when the game begins, Indian rooters will be following
the action with the aid of a fancy new $10,000 scoreboard at the

south end of the field.
The installation of the new seats
and scoreboard over the summer is
the first in a series of Stadium con
struction jobs. The two middle sec
tions on each side, seating approxi
mately 7,000 rooters for the Cards
and the visiting school, are being
replaced with new benches and
floors.
After workers had begun ripping
out the old seats from these sections,
the. University's order for wood re
placement was canceled because of a
lumber strike. Fortunately, UC had
stockpiled some extra redwood
bleachers and sold them to Stanford.
The University plans to gradually
replace' each section of the Stadium
until there is an entire set of new
seats. Cost of the overall project is
estimated at $750,000, nearly twice
as much as the Stadium cost when it
was constructed in 1921.
Athletic Publicity Director Don
Liebendorfer said that this year's
work cost about $40,000. "The center
sections are in the poorest condition
for several reasons," he said recent
ly-
"For one, students give the seats
and floors the hardest use with their
jumping up and down, and another,
when we have a track meet, if there
are only about 5,000 fans in the Sta
dium, then they use the center
stands."
The Stadium's new clock was pro
duced by IBM, and instead of using
a sweep-second hand, it will flash
the minutes and seconds remaining
to play starting at the beginning of
each quarter with 15:00. It will also
show the score, quarter, downs,
yards to go, and yardline on which
the ball rests, all of which will be
regulated from the field and press
box.
