# Football Ticket Sales End Today
## 
### 

THE LONG WAlT—Students found yesterday that the early bird doesn't always get the worm
right away, the worm in this case being football tickets sold at the Pavilion for eight Stanford
games. Students who got there even before eight o'clock found they had an hour's wait; later
in the day the line of people clutching student body cards and fistfuls of money stretched clear
across the street to the Encina lawn. Today is the final day student tickets will be on sale.
