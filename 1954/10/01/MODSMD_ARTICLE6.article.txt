## 
### 
LONDON, Sept. 30 (UP) â€” The
nine-nation conference on German
rearmament and sovereignty neared
adjournment in agreement on nearly
all major points tonight by making
new, far - reaching concessions to
France.
French Premier Pierre Mendes-
France emerged with impressive
diplomatic victories to his credit and
was the loser only when he ran
headlong into a resounding American
"no" on his demand for control of
American military aid to Europe by
the Brussels Pact organization.
The conference agreed to make
the Brussels Pact the main control
agency in armaments and on how to
include Germany and Italy in the
pact. The principle of a German
arms contribution to was ap
proved and representatives of the
nine nations were instructed to draw
up plans for it.
A committee of experts from the
nine nations tonight began writing
the first draft of a final conference
communique.
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles announced he will fly home
Saturday. Informed sources said he
expects the conference to end before
he leaves.
The consensus was the conference
would last through tomorrow but
many of the remaining details will
be turned over to experts for work
ing out later.
