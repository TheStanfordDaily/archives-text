LONDON, Oct. 3 (UP) Nine Western foreign ministers signed
away in ten taut minutes today nine years of German occupation
and left that nation free to rearm as a sovereign state aligned with
the West.
Once ratification is completed Germany can have three to six

divisions marching within two years,
12 divisions within four years. The
United States will supply most of
their equipment, Germany will
manufacture the rest.
The agreement must be ratified
by the parliaments of the nine na
tions that signed it — the United
States, Britain, Fiance, Germany,
Italy, Belgium, Holland, Canada and
Luxembourg—before it becomes ef
fective.
The Soviet Union was expccted to
counter the Western decision by
granting immediate "sovereignty" to
East Germany's 18,000,000 persons
and creating the 100,000-man police
army there into a full-fledged army.
Western officials believed that army
might be expanded even furthef - and
an air force and navy added.
France, which fears the rearming
of her traditional foe, asked for and
received strait-jacket controls on
German arms and the German army,
but within four years Germany,
which signed an unconditional sur
render in 1045, is expected to have
500,000 men under arms.
French Premier Pierre Mendcs-
France has promised parliament ac
tion by the first of the year. He
called a special session of the As
sembly for Thursday to vote on his
conduct at the London conference.
He believes the assembly will rati
fy it for he was able to place German
arms and troops under a complex
system of controls by the North At
lantic Treaty Organization and an
expanded Brussels Pact Treaty org
anization.
The new Germany is specifically
prohibited from manufacturing any
atomic, biological and chemical
weapons and there is to be no ex
emption of this prohibition at a later
date. Germany also is forbidden to
manufacture guided missiles, atomic
submarines, warships of more than
3,000 tons, submarines of more than
350 tons and long-range rockets.
The Brussels Treaty Organization
and NATO will exercise tight con
trols and inspections over these pro
grams and see that Germany keeps
her pledge not to go to war over
unification of Germany or for her
lost, territories.
