# Is Illinois Best in the Big Ten? Stanford Triumphs Easily, 22-2
## Card Line Play Is Outstanding 
### DON WEBSTER Sports Editor, The Daily 
"If Illinois is the best the Big
Ten has to offer this year, then
we should be national cham
pions."
Such were the sentiments ex
pressed by Stanford players
after Saturday's game, when the
Cards rolled to a surprisingly
easy 12-2 victory over the sup
posedly powerful Illini.
"The score should have been
worse," commented quarterback
Jerry Gustafson. '"We could easily
have scored two more touchdowns."
The victory, achieved before some
35,000 Stanford Stadium viewers and
millions of television fans, brought
several points to light:
1. Illinois is, as Coach Ray Eliot
has insisted all along, a heavily
overrated club.
2. The Cards have a strong, smart
line, both on offense and defense.
3. Stanford will be a definite
threat to defeat any team on its
schedule, and doesn't need any so
called "breaks" to do so.
4. Coach Chuck Taylor's eleven
has a powerful running attack to
add to its passing game.
5. Soph quarterback John Brodie
is being hard pressed for the starting
berth by Gustafson.
6. Stanford still has weaknesses.
The passing game didn't click Sat
urday. Four Card drives bogged
down within 30 yards of pay dirt,
two of them inside the 20-yard line.
And two more conversions were
missed.
After all the talk about the out
standing running hacks Illinois
has, the game was decided in the
line. Stanford's men outcharged,
outmaneuvered, and generally out
played the visitors.
The top runners, J.' C. Caroline
and Mickey Bates, were supposed to
run wild. They have speed, but
never had a chance to use it. Bates
was able to smash through the sec
ondary only once, Caroline never.
The nation's top runner last season
and a near-unanimous All-Ameri
can this year gained only 34 yards
on 11 attempts—a 3.1 average. His
longest gain was for but seven yards.
The Card linemen and linebackers
get credit for this. When Illinois'
guards pulled out, Stanford rushers
swarmed in to stop the play. On at
tempted end sweeps, Card defensive
ends stopped the runners cold.
They just didn't have it.
On offense, though the passing
game wasn't too successful, it
wasn't needed. Time and again the
Illini tackles were trapped, net
ting big games for Stanford there.
Center smashes worked equally
well. An occasional split-T play
added to the visitors' confusion.
Brodie, who completed eight passes
in 16 attempts last week against
Oregon, played little more than half
the game. It didn't seem to matter
who was in there at quarterback—
both he and Gustafson led long
Stanford drives.
The pair attempted only 15 passes,
completing six. Though this isn't too
good, many of them were admittedly
used simply to keep the Illinois de
fense "honest" — when the running
game works so well, who cares about
passing?
And work the running game
did. Card rushers rolled up a net
191 yards, compared to 50 for the
visitors. Fullback Bill Tarr car
ried the hall an incredible 24 times


UP AND OVER—Fullback Bill Tarr leaps over a pile of players
to score the first of Stanford's two touchdowns Saturday over
Illinois. The Cards won easily, 12-2. The Illini were offside on
this play, but the penalty, needless to say, was refused. Guard
and captain Jan Smid attempts to stop Tarr's score; his hand
can be seen on Tarr's leg. The Card player driving under Tarr

is tackle. Chris Marshall. Some 35,000 fans at the Stadium and
millions on television watched the Cards roll to an easy victory
over a highly-rated Big Ten team. Stanford has their work cut
out for them in the future, though, as they meet a powerful Navy
eleven this Saturday and then UCLA the next.

for X 5 yards net. Half Ernie Dorn
was not far behind with 70 yards
in lli carries. Both, in other words,
gained more than the entire Illi
nois team.
On the dimmer side, two more
j conversions were missed, by Tarr
, and halfback Dorsey Atkinson. That
' means six misses in six attempts this
| season. The only successful one so
far this season was on a bootleg by
Brodie (which won the COP game.
13-12). They don't mean much as
i long as you're scoring more TD's
j than your opponents. But the day
may come when they'll be needed.
Had the Illini had a more power
! ful offense, some of the lost touch-
I downs would also have been useful.
In the first period, the Indians
drove 30 yards to' the visitors' 17.
Four plays netted a loss of two
yaids, and Illinois took over. In the
second quarter, Stanford drove to a
first-and-goal on the nine, but again
failed to score, thanks to a 15-yard
penalty and a 20-yard loss attempt-
I ing to pass.
A second drive in that period
halted 28 yard? from pay dirt, when
■ a pass was intercepted. And in the

third quarter a first down on the
11 was attained without a touch
down resulting.
Fans watching the TV "Game
of the Week" saw a powerful Card
offense that had complete control
of the game after the first safety.
But the Indiana won't have much
time to relax following their upset.
Next week they face Navy, which
defeated Dartmouth Saturday, 42-
7. The following weekend they
travel to Los Angeles to vie with
defending champion UCLA.
It's a long, rocky road ahead.
