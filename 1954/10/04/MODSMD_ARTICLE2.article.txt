to attend. The meeting will be held
at 8 p.m. in the Women's Clubhouse.
Ivey said that tomorrow night's
meeting will be an "idea session," to
bring out new ideas and plans. He
said he feels that the full potential
of the National Students Organiza
tion has rtot been developed at Stan
ford, but that Ai Loomis, NSA co
ordinator for Stanford, is "working
hard to develop a great interest in
NSA with the students here."
"Our job," he said, "is to bring
NSA to the students here."
Stanford's membership in the NSA
is still on a trial basis. The ASSU
became a member of the national
intercollegiate organization in win
ter quarter of 1954, on a trial basis.
Seven Stanford students attended
the NSA conference held this sum
