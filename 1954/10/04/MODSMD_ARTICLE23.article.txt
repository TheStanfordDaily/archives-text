## Back to the Farm Freshness 
### 
The Stanford of the past will be revived.for
fow days this week as Cardinals present their
.inimal Bafck to the Farm Days. Fortunately,
however, this year's Back to the Farm com
mittee lias drawn up a revised program which
veals a welcomed spark of freshness and
vitality.
Old Clotlfes Day and other events which in
past years have largely gone over like the
proverbial lead balloon have been abandoned,
while the popular Olympic Day and Old Car
Parade have been maintained and improved
upon.
One of the innovations of this year's pro
gram is the Student-Faculty Farm Frolics
v/hich are set for Wednesday night in Frost
Amphitheater. Highlights of this entertain
ment packed event will include an informal ad
dress by President Sterling and the staging

of a varied program of outstanding faculty and
student talent. Since the student-faculty inti
macy of an earlier-day Stanford has faded
somewhat, we applaud this attempt to bring
the two groups together and restore the friend
ship and cooperation which can prove so valu
able to both.
Since IS4O, when Stanfordites first aban
doned their city ways and headed "back to the
farm," the annual event has included many
activities which have met with little acceptance
and even less success. At the same time, other
Back to the Farm activities have developed
into some of the campus' most popular tra
ditions.
This year, Cardinals and the Back to the
Farm chairmen have obviously drawn up. a
program original enough and varied enough
to be greeted by enthusiastic student partici
pation and support.
