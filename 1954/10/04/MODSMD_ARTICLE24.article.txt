## 'A Frustrating Experience' 
### 
To the Editor:
Haying undergone a frustrating experience in at
t«uiptiti - to buy football tickets, we would like to
ask:
I. Why is it necessary that the sale of tickets be
completed in three days? Especially at the start of
the year, when we are all so busy standing in book
line;-:, etc.
'l Why can't tickets be sold at several campus lo
cations? If this is impractical, why can't there be
additional ticket sellers at the present location?
A the closing time for the day approaches, why
can't the ticket sellers show a little more consider
ation for those waiting in line, by estimating how
la: nv more they can serve, then telling the rest not
to wait?
■1 Why is it necessary to secure tickets for the
' no charge" games? This takes up time at the ticket
."iiidows, and it seems to us that a student body card
would serve just as well for admission.
°ei haps the Athletic Department has reasonable
answers. II so, we would certainly like to know what
they are. Time is valuable to everyone on this
aiupus and there is certainly a lot of it being wasted
a I the football ticket sales.

trailers Miouii and iVlulhall:

Ticket sales must l>e completed within three days
to give the Athletic Department ;i fairly clear idea
of how large the rooting section will hfc for each
game—and thus at what point in the side sections
they can sell reserved seat tickets to the public.
Tickets are needed for the "no charge" games
for the same reason. If only student body cards
were required for admission, there would be no
way for the Athletic Department to know if 700
or 7,(100 students were planning to attend the game.
To alleviate the problem of long waiting lines,
Athletic Director Al Masters has promised more
booths will be sel up at the Pavilion next year.
