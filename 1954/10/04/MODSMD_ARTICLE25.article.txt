# They 'Stink'!

To the Editor
It is the consensus of our wing that the new rooters
caps stink! What happened to the clever red and
white caps used traditionally at Stanford games?
The color does not reflect the true Stanford card
inal and the shape makes the Stanford men look
like slobs. The style is also identical to that of the
Cal Rally Com- DO WE NEED TO' COPY CAL?
