TV) thn Editor:
I would like to comment on your editorial, "New
112 'ule for Britain" in which you wrote: "Great Britain
a-rain the leading nation in Europe."
II is a matter of common knowledge that Great
iiiitain practiced in Europe the policy of balance of
jower and played each of the continental countries
(gainst the others in order to protect herself . . .
Today there was a great deception in this country
hen it was learned of the voting down of the EDC
y the French Parliament. I do agree with those who
laim that the time has come to bring an end to the
ild French-German quarrel.
Nevertheless, the Congress that voted against the
"IJC has some ground for doing so. It did not listen
-) the voice of hatred as some were inclined to be
icve. France was asked to give up a part of her
â– overeignty in matters of defense and to become the
Jly of Germany.
Tin draft treaty was designed to include the Ger

man manpower in the Western camp. But in this
army neither the U.S.A. nor the British were willing
to participate. . . .
When the French premier, Mr. Mendes-France,
made it clear that the British participation was the
sine qua non condition for the French ratification
of any treaty similar to the late EDC, the British
government came to his terms.
You called this shift in the British attitude a lead
ing position. I believe that the location of the Nine
Powers Conference in London makes the pill not so
bitter to swallow.
But I think that when someone comes to someone
else's terms, the latter and not the former is the real
leader. This goes beyond a mere question of vo
cabulary, since France has been accused of having
a negative attitude in Europe in the last ten years.
