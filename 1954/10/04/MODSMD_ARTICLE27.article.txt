### JACK BYRNE 
C ONTAINING A PROTEST ON CRASS
COMMERCIALISM
I don't know exactly how it came about, but it
ppeai> to me that fellow bullet - Dick Mansfield and
I liiivo been dealt a cruel blow at the hands of free
ml private enterprise.
We've got competition.
I ''idav morning I put my regular 93c bet on the
Clove land Indians, drew up a scrambled egg, and sat
down lo breakfast with the Daily. I turned to page
to see what of my material Mansfield had swiped.
Then I saw it.
Two columns wide, and a full twelve inches lontj

it wa.s. It bore the title "On
Campus" (that ought to take .
r-' >nsort of cake for originality)
• iiid the writer's name of Max
Shulman. (Obviously a nom de
plume).
I won't play this dumb, I've
heard ol Max Shulman. I've even
• -.id hi . rummy book, '"Barefoot
1 ><iy with Cheek," and I liked the
darn thing. But that was before
he turned into competition. After

I Max old thing, there's such a thing as ethics.

Consider: Have T ever tried to crash into the lit
erary world with a bit of living literature entitled
''Barecheeked Boy with Feet"? (A saga of the Health
Service). I have my territory, you keep yours.
What next? Will we poor Bull Sessioners be ex
commuhicated from the edit column to be replaced
by Winchell? Pearson? Earl Wilson? Grothe?
If one reads far enough into the Shulman effort, it
becomes obvious what it's all about. Shulman's been
bought.
Shulman has prostituted himself. He's an ad writer.
I suppose I should have some compassion for a poor
and starving author who has had to go commercial
to cat, but dadgummit, does he have to go commercial
on MY page? t
A warning: Get off my page, Shulman, or I'll never
buy another of your vile cigarettes. Back to corn
silks if necessary, but this is war.
And a word to the business manager of the Daily,
to boot. If we must have Shulman, put him with
sports or someplace else where he'll be lost. Don't
knock the staff in the fair name of profit.
But if the truth is to be known, I'm really a bit
jealous. No one around here ever even considered
giving me 24 column inches of space.
