# SALT OF THE EARTH'
## New Movie Has impact, Realism Despite 'Message' 
### TERRY COMITO 
Within the narrow limits of a
frankly propagandist picture,
"Salt of the Earth," currently at the
Guild Theater in Menlo Park, is
something of a triumph: of manner
over matter, of cinematic guts over
handbill bunk.
Nothing could be further from the

well - cosmeticized
Hollywood tradi
tion. A labor un
ion and a band of
blacklisted ex-
Hollywoo d i a n s
produced the film
in a New Mexico
mining town with
a largely amateur

cast. It is a tough picture, and it
doesn't flinch.
The grey countryside, the miners'
dismal shacks, the homely faces, the
angry ones and the stolid ones: these
are real places and these are real
people. They live.
Of them director Herbert Biber
man has fashioned scenes that pulse
with excitement and anger and even,
sometimes, a gaunt kind of beauty.
There is in the picture sweep
enough and artistry enough almost
to make the viewer forget that its
realism is only skin deep. But not
quite.

Because Michael Wilson's screen
play is a shrill mishmash of old-time
melodrama and proletarian cliches
reminiscent of the wide-eyed 'thir
ties: Uncle Tom's Cabin all over
again, with leering capitalists in
stead of hound dogs.
In it, the story of a Spanish-
American union's fight against the
implacable "Company" is paralleled
|by the personal story ef what
{ amounts to one woman's awakening
j to militant unionism.
The mass drama fares the better:
I it has an epic sort of scope that car
| l ies it off despite a few ludicrous
I moments (pickets chorusing "the
union is our leader" to an old Sun
'■ day-school tune) and prevents the
; generally thin characters from be
ing too great a liability.
But personal drama is just not the
dish of this sort of film. The people,
' for all the "honesty" of their presen
tation, are too obviously mouth
j pieces; the situations are too obvi
j ously rigged. When the focus is nar
rowed, the result is less intense
than tedious.
Yet "Salt of the Earth" remains a
picture of unusual impact. Its scenes
| hiss with a reality and a power quite
independent of the rather simple
minded story behind them. The di
rector's art is greater than the writ
j er's failure.

in a New Mexico
mining town with
a largely amateur

cast. It is a tough picture, and it
doesn't flinch.
The grey countryside, the miners'
dismal shacks, the homely faces, the
angry ones and the stolid ones: these
are real places and these are real
people. They live.
Of them director Herbert Biber
man has fashioned scenes that pulse
with excitement and anger and even,
sometimes, a gaunt kind of beauty.
There is in the picture sweep
enough and artistry enough almost
to make the viewer forget that its
realism is only skin deep. But not
quite.

Because Michael Wilson's screen
play is a shrill mishmash of old-time
melodrama and proletarian cliches
reminiscent of the wide-eyed 'thir
ties: Uncle Tom's Cabin all over
again, with leering capitalists in
stead of hound dogs.
In it, the story of a Spanish-
American union's fight against the
implacable "Company" is paralleled
|by the personal story ef what
{ amounts to one woman's awakening
j to militant unionism.
The mass drama fares the better:
I it has an epic sort of scope that car
| l ies it off despite a few ludicrous
I moments (pickets chorusing "the
union is our leader" to an old Sun
'■ day-school tune) and prevents the
; generally thin characters from be
ing too great a liability.
But personal drama is just not the
dish of this sort of film. The people,
' for all the "honesty" of their presen
tation, are too obviously mouth
j pieces; the situations are too obvi
j ously rigged. When the focus is nar
rowed, the result is less intense
than tedious.
Yet "Salt of the Earth" remains a
picture of unusual impact. Its scenes
| hiss with a reality and a power quite
independent of the rather simple
minded story behind them. The di
rector's art is greater than the writ
j er's failure.
