The Rose Room of Rickey's Studio Club, site of the Junior re
union, was packed last Fiiday. Juniors, seniors, and sophomores
were all crammed into the normally spacious banquet hall to hear
the voice and guitar of Stan Wilson- sensation of San Francisco's
hungry i night club.
A native born Californian ("a rarity these days," he says) Stan

has loved the guitar since his teen
age days in Berkeley High School.
Playing for private parties and im
promptu get-togethers, Stan initially
specialized in the ukulele. But as
his fame grew, so did his instrument.
Since 1948 Stan has been a pro
fessional entertainer. He traveled
around the Bay Area for a while,
.and finally two years ago found a
home at the hungry i. Since then
both he and the"i" have found in
creasing fame and popularity.
"When I first came to the 'i,' it was
(wo bits at the door and two bits a
shot," said Stan retrospectively.
This Bay Area troubadour has just
returned from a tour of the United
States which has taken him to Reno,
Sacramento, Chicago, and Milwau
kee. Although he found his road
stint very maturing professionally
and himself well appreciated by all
his audiences, Stan smiled when he
.said, "It's good to be home again in
San Francisco and at the 'i'—and
what a home."
As for his future plans, Wilson is
looking around for an opening in
New York, which he feels will be
the real test of his entertaining abil
ities.
"As soon as I get around to New
York and a bit more around the
country I'd like to go to Europe and
give it a try."
Stan, who took a short tour of
Stanford before making his appear
ance at Rickey's, was quite im
pressed with the immensity of the
campus and its great sandstone

structures. He had to admit that he
thought Hoover Tower was more
beautiful than California's Campa
nile—even though he practically was
raised in the shadow of the Berke
ley tower.
Stan has appeared once before on
the campus several years ago—then
relatively unknown—as a guest of
Stanford's radio station KZSU.
He is completely impartial as to
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia because, he says,"I meet lots
of the kids from both schools at the
hungry i and I always have a lot of
fun with them."
When asked about his aspirations
Stan was quick to answer, "I like to
entertain people, and therefore plan
to do concerts sometime—but right
now my medium is night clubs and
I like them very much."
He especially likes to play before
high school and college audiences
because they have come to hear his
music rather than to see the name.
"College people can dig me. They
let me know honestly if they like
me, and if they don't, they let me
know that too."
Because of this sincere feeling
that he gets from young audiences,
Stan hopes to arrange many more
engagements with colleges around
the country.

just before he drove oil the cam
pus Stan pointed at Stanford Sta
dium and said, "That's a place I'm
quite familiar with." He still re
membered vividly the 21 to 21 tie
Big Game last year. "That was the
most story-hook game I ever saw."
When asked whom he would pick
this year, he paused, thought about
all his Cal and Stanford friends at
the hungry i, and chuckled, "I bet
ter hope for another tie again this
year."
