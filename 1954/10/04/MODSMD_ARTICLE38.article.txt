Led by Jack Lewis and Mike Raf
lery, the Stanford Braves came from
behind to trounce the Cal Ramblers,
in the preliminary to the Illi
nois game.
Midway in the first period Lewis
threw an 18-yard pass to Carl Isaacs
on the Cal eight, but a fourth-down
fumble on the one-foot line staved
off an Indian score momentarily.
Two plays later Cal al.so fumbled
and Dick Crepeau recovered t>n the
seven.
After two touchdown tries had j
been nullified by penalties, Lewis
passed to Raftery in the end zone
lor a 0-0 Brave lead.
Cal got rolling in the second pe
riod with a 75-yard drive, aided by
two 15-yard Stanford penalties on
fourth - down situations. Stanford
finally took over but Don Kafka, at
tempting to punt, was forced to run
on fourth down and the Bears gained
possession on the Indian four. Nat
Brazil punched it over and kicked
the extra point.
Following the kickolf, the two
teams exchanged fumbles again on
the Stanford 25. The Indians j
lianlly punted out to Cal at mid- ;
field. Seven plays later Nick Pa- j
pac hit Ed Vial with a 24-yard
scoring toss for a 14-0 lead.
In the second half, Lewis broke
up the middle for 29 yards to the
Bear five. After he lost yardage try
ing to pass, he made up for it by
pitching out to Angove around left
end for the TD. Raftery kicked and
Stanford trailed by but one point.
Lewis put Stanford ahead for good
with two minutes remaining in the
quarter. On first down Lewis quar
terback - sneaked through the Cai
line and outraced the secondary 62
yards for a Card score. Raftery
again added the PAT.
