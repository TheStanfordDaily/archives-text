# Ray Eliot: 'They Pushed Us All Over the Gridiron'
## 
### BOB DURAND 
Illinois grid mentor Ray Eliot has
always been a great supporter of
games with Pacific Coast Confer
ence teams. Until Saturday, he had
a record of eight wins in eight con
tests with West Coast elevens.
At 4:30 p.m. Saturday the final
gun had sounded, and the score
board showed his team had suffered
a 12-2 defeat.
Walking off the field, quarterback
Em Lindbeck said, "They just out
played us." "We didn't expect any
j thing we got," said star halfback
Mickey Bates. "No comment," added
Dean Renn.
The Illini dressing room was a
j sad-looking place a few minutes
; later. Not a word was spoken as
! the players trudged into the build
ing. Everyone seemed to be think
ing over the events of the past
three hours.
Then coach Eliot began to speak.
"Maybe we were playing up to our
capacity, maybe we weren't. Stan
ford's line had more of everything,
and that's what counted"."
lie went on, "They pushed us
all over the field—on offense as
I well as defense. I can't pick out

i any one member of their line.
They were all good, the whole
club, all the time."
By that time, a crowd had gath
ered around the bespectacled men
tor. Everyone — reporters, friends,
players, and even autograph-seeking
kids—was "listening intently.
"We don't have as good a team
as everyone said we did," contin
ued Eliot. "I suppose the papers
' will call this an upset like they
did the Penn State game last week
I (Illinois lost, 14-12). We have been
J greatly overrated.
"I must admit that I never saw
Caroline contained like this before.
No discredit to J. C., you under
stand — he's still one of the finest
backs I've ever seen. However, foot
ball is a team game, and without
the help of the other players a boy
| like Caroline can't break loose."
"You know,"he concluded, "dur
ing the game I had the feeling that
something would happen, but it just
didn't."
AH this time, the much-talked -
about star, J. C. Caroline, had
i been slowly dressing in the cor
ner. When asked to comment on
the game, he mumbled, "I just
i couldn't get started out there."
Later, a reporter from Champaign,
! after backing up Eliot's story, added,
j "Stanford today acted the way our
| teams (the Big Ten) usually act
against yours."

against yours."
Illinois grid mentor Ray Eliot has
always been a great supporter of
games with Pacific Coast Confer
ence teams. Until Saturday, he had
a record of eight wins in eight con
tests with West Coast elevens.
At 4:30 p.m. Saturday the final
gun had sounded, and the score
board showed his team had suffered
a 12-2 defeat.
Walking off the field, quarterback
Em Lindbeck said, "They just out
played us." "We didn't expect any
j thing we got," said star halfback
Mickey Bates. "No comment," added
Dean Renn.
The Illini dressing room was a
j sad-looking place a few minutes
; later. Not a word was spoken as
! the players trudged into the build
ing. Everyone seemed to be think
ing over the events of the past
three hours.
Then coach Eliot began to speak.
"Maybe we were playing up to our
capacity, maybe we weren't. Stan
ford's line had more of everything,
and that's what counted"."
lie went on, "They pushed us
all over the field—on offense as
I well as defense. I can't pick out

i any one member of their line.
They were all good, the whole
club, all the time."
By that time, a crowd had gath
ered around the bespectacled men
tor. Everyone — reporters, friends,
players, and even autograph-seeking
kids—was "listening intently.
"We don't have as good a team
as everyone said we did," contin
ued Eliot. "I suppose the papers
' will call this an upset like they
did the Penn State game last week
I (Illinois lost, 14-12). We have been
J greatly overrated.
"I must admit that I never saw
Caroline contained like this before.
No discredit to J. C., you under
stand — he's still one of the finest
backs I've ever seen. However, foot
ball is a team game, and without
the help of the other players a boy
| like Caroline can't break loose."
"You know,"he concluded, "dur
ing the game I had the feeling that
something would happen, but it just
didn't."
AH this time, the much-talked -
about star, J. C. Caroline, had
i been slowly dressing in the cor
ner. When asked to comment on
the game, he mumbled, "I just
i couldn't get started out there."
Later, a reporter from Champaign,
! after backing up Eliot's story, added,
j "Stanford today acted the way our
| teams (the Big Ten) usually act
against yours."
