## Segregation Back Before High Court 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 3 (UP)â€”The
Supreme Court reconvenes tomor
row to solve touchy school segrega
tion problems in the face of spread
ing rebellion against its order min
gling white and Negro children in
the nation's classrooms.
In addition to segregation, major
issues before the cqurt concern the
validity of state sedition laws, the
constitutionality of state "fair trade"
laws, the Uniform Code of Military
Justice, and other important consti
tutional questions.
As the court prepared to open its
165 th year, disorder and threats of
violence prevailed in the border
states of Delaware and Maryland in
protest of efforts to implement the
tribunal's desegregation ruling of
last May 17.
At the same time, Representative
Emanuel Celler, ranking Democrat
on the House Judiciary Committee,
called on Attorney General Herbert
Brownell, Jr., to investigate what he
termed "the sordid outburst of ra
cism" in Milford, Del.
Celler (D., N.Y.) told Brownell in
a telegram that "violence continues"
in Milford and "Milford's virus has
spread to Baltimore." He urged im
mediate action to block "a nation
wide conspiracy to take from Ne
groes their right to equal education."
Milford school officials, who ended
an integration attempt because of a
strike of white pupils, scheduled a
hearing for Oct. 12 on a request that
10 Negro pupils be readmitted to a
local high school.
Baltimore officials, however, re
fused to back down on their limited
integration plans in the face of spot
ted violence and similar strikes in
six schools. Police Commissioner
Beverly Ober said his men will be
stationed at all schools tomorrow to
prevent new outbursts.
