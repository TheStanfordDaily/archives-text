Color + collar + comfort =
The right ARROW Shirt for you!
You don't have to be a math major to figure it out. Arrow
shirts offer you so many fine colors and patterns in your
favorite collars, that it's a breeze to have plenty of style
in your wardrobe.
Shown above are, the Sussex button-down in a neat tatter
sol check, and the smooth Radnor "E" in solid colors.
Both $5.00. The goodlooking Arruw Sussex in a well-bred
stripe, $4.50. They're comfortable, "correct " thrifty too.
