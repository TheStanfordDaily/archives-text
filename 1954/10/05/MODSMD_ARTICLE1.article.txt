# Francis Carr Quits Post As McCarthy Staff Head
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 4. (UP)—Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy lost
another of his top aides today with the resignation of Francis P.
Carr as executive director of the Senate Investigating Subcom
mittee.
Carr, one of the original principals in the stormy Army-

McCarthy dispute last, spring, re
signed effective Oct.. 31 to take a job
in private industry.
His departure leaves McCarthy
with the task of replacing the top
staff echelon when the subcommit
tee, which has been inactive during
the Army-McCarthy and the cen
sure hearings, resumes its regular
work.
Roy M. Colin, who resigned un
der fire as chief counsel shortly
after the Army-McCarthy inquiry
ended, never has been replaced.
It was understood that Carr also
wanted to quit at that time hut
was persuaded by McCarthy to
stay on after the subcommittee
held his employment.
Pfc. G. David Schine, a former
McCarthy aide and a key figure in
the Army-McCarthy row, began a
15-cfay leave from Camp Gordon,
Ga., today prior to an assignment in
Alaska. The Army accused McCar
thy, Cohn, and Carr of trying to win
favors for Schine after his induction
into the Army.
Carr, 38, a former FBI man, is ex
pected to take a job Nov. 1 with
Associated Transport, Inc., a truck
ing firm with headquarters in New
York.
McCarthy praised Carr's 15
months as head of the subcommit
tee staff but did not indicate when
he will name a new director. It
may be several weeks before Mc-
Carthy is able to devote much
time to subcommittee business.
Some Senators predicted today
that the forthcoming Senate ses
sion on the censure charges
against him will produce such
heated debate that it may drag on
most of the fall. That 'would keep
McCarthy largely tied up in de
fending himself.
With the Congressional elections
out of the way and no limit on the
Senate discussion, the debate might
range far afield from the censure
question.
Senator James O. Eastland (D.,
Miss.) said the session "might last
almost until Christmas."
But Senator Arthur V. Watkins
(R„ Utah), chairman of the spe
cial committee that recommended
censure of McCarthy, was more
optimistic about the length of the
session starting Nov. 8. He said,
"We should be able to clean up
this question in a Week,"

His departure leaves McCarthy
with the task of replacing the top
staff echelon when the subcommit
tee, which has been inactive during
the Army-McCarthy and the cen
sure hearings, resumes its regular
work.
Roy M. Colin, who resigned un
der fire as chief counsel shortly
after the Army-McCarthy inquiry
ended, never has been replaced.
It was understood that Carr also
wanted to quit at that time hut
was persuaded by McCarthy to
stay on after the subcommittee
held his employment.
Pfc. G. David Schine, a former
McCarthy aide and a key figure in
the Army-McCarthy row, began a
15-cfay leave from Camp Gordon,
Ga., today prior to an assignment in
Alaska. The Army accused McCar
thy, Cohn, and Carr of trying to win
favors for Schine after his induction
into the Army.
Carr, 38, a former FBI man, is ex
pected to take a job Nov. 1 with
Associated Transport, Inc., a truck
ing firm with headquarters in New
York.
McCarthy praised Carr's 15
months as head of the subcommit
tee staff but did not indicate when
he will name a new director. It
may be several weeks before Mc-
Carthy is able to devote much
time to subcommittee business.
Some Senators predicted today
that the forthcoming Senate ses
sion on the censure charges
against him will produce such
heated debate that it may drag on
most of the fall. That 'would keep
McCarthy largely tied up in de
fending himself.
With the Congressional elections
out of the way and no limit on the
Senate discussion, the debate might
range far afield from the censure
question.
Senator James O. Eastland (D.,
Miss.) said the session "might last
almost until Christmas."
But Senator Arthur V. Watkins
(R„ Utah), chairman of the spe
cial committee that recommended
censure of McCarthy, was more
optimistic about the length of the
session starting Nov. 8. He said,
"We should be able to clean up
this question in a Week,"
