## 
### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
Fourteen years ago this
week, the Stanford campus
went back to the style of Jane
and Leland Stanford's day —
rules were passed banning
"horseless carriages" from
Palm Drive; a force of twen
ty deputized "vigilantes"
prowled Quad to make sure
that everyone was dressed
according to the fashion of the
week; and a parade of hearses,
tandems, fire engines, and antique
cars led of! in what was to be
come the first of Stanford's
"Back-to-the-Farm" weeks.
In the following years, the tra
dition faded and was changed.
Celebration of the event in 1941
featured a' promenade and danc
ing on Quad, playing records of
David Starr Jordan, and old ster
eopticon slides showing the his
tory of the Stanford campus.
One of the main events in the
present. "Back-to-the-Farm" tra
dition was started in 1945, when
the first Olympic Day events were
helcl- Starting on campus, the J8
toga-clad entrants,raced by canoe
across Lake Lag, fighting off pi
rates, and across the hills to Ros
sotti's where the contestants
ilinked the flaming torch in an
abandoned toilet bowl.
"Back-to-the-Farm" Week will
start off officially this year to
morrow evening with the stu
dent-faculty dinner at which 80
professors and their wives will be
guests of various campus living
groups.
