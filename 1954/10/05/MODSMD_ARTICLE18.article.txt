A $250,000 electronics re
search laboratory will be built
by the Kaiser-Willys Corpora
tion on the Stanford light in
dustrial tract according to an an
nouncement made yesterday by
corporation Vice-President Clay
Bedford.
It will be the fourth concern to
join the Stanford tract. Eastman Ko
dak and Varian Associates are pres
ently operating laboratories and
General Electric is scheduled to be
gin operations November 1.
Stanford Business Manager Alf
Brandin confirmed that negotiations
for the site were nearly complete,
but said that Stanford couldn't make
the announcement because no lease
had been signed. Stanford is await
ing final plans and ' specifications
which must be attached as an ex
hibit to the lease before it can be
signed.
This is in keeping with the Stan
ford policy of maintaining close
control over appearance and use
of buildings.
Kaiser will build on a 3'/4-acre
site next door to the GE lab on Cali
fornia Avenue and across the street
from the block bounded by Yale and
Williams streets in College Terrace.
A Kaiser spokesman said pluns
for a 12,000 square foot building
were complete and tliat construc
tion was planned to begin Novem
ber 1. The building is expected to
be in operation by spring.
Bedford announced that, "We al
ready have a small stockpile of
ideas which are ready for intensive
investigation."
These ideas for revolutionizing
television, radar and electronics will
be investigated, said Bedford. Many
of the scientists have been with
Kaiser for a long time, working in
various sections of the country.
They are getting a chance to work
together in one completely equipped
laboratory and test their theories.
