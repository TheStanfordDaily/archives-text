# Teenagers Protest Desegregation
## Mob of 2,000 In Baltimore 
### 
EALTIMORE, Oct. 4 (UP)
Two thousand white teenagers
"stormed" the Baltimore city
hall to protest racial integration
of public schools Monday as
demonstrations were staged for
the first time in the nation's
capital.
High school students, shouting
protests and anti-Negro slogans,
clambered up the Baltimore city hall
steps after Mayor Thomas R. D'Ales
andro ignored their demands that he
come out and talk to them.
An emergency police squad, led by
Commissioner Beverly Ober, finally
pushed back the unruly crowd after
about 50 entered the building.
After a stormy 10 minutes, the
demonstrators returned to the school
grounds.
In Washington, white students
staged a peaceful but noisy demon
stration at Anacostia and McKinley
high schools.
It was the first such incident in
the nation's capital since segregation
bars were lifted this fall.
Milling around the school yards,
they taunted students inside to
join them, and waived signs read
ing "Send them back to the plan
tation;" "Back to Africa" and "We
want segregation."
As Washington classes were dis
missed this afternoon, these strikers
cheered and jeered at their depart
ing schoolmates, and passed the
word to be ready for more of the
same tomorrow. They also threat
ened to visit a neighboring school to
morrow.
The demonstration at Baltimore
High School broke up about 2:30
p.m. Eastern Standard time when 36
Negro students were escorted from
the school by elder James L. John
son, a Negro minister.
Police followed the Negro group
several bloaks toward their homes.
Behind them came a jeering group
of about 200 white students and
adults. They stopped before the
Negro students entered the predom
inently Negro district.
President Eisenhower had ex
pressed the hope last spring that
Washington would serve as a
model for the nation in bringing
white and Negro students into the
same ciass rooms under the Su
preme Court decision.
Integration had gone so smooth
ly until today that Mr. Eisenhow
er congratulated the District of
Columbia commissioners last week
on the way it was working out.
The Baltimore-Washington dem
onstrations were by far the largest
thus far in the various cities where
mixed classes are being tried out for
the first time this year. Similar in
cidents have occurred in Milford,
Delaware and White Sulpher
Springs, West Virginia.
