# In Search of Ideas
## 
### 
The National Students Association is coming
to Stanford tonight in search of ideas.
In an open meeting the Northern California
district of NSA—the University of California,
Mills, and Stanford—will discuss plans for the
forthcoming year.
District chairman A 1 Ivey and Stanford NSA
co-o.rdinator A.l Loomis have emphasized their
invitation to all students to attend the meeting.
For those who have doubts about the value
of NSA, this is an opportunity to learn of its
past program and enthusiastic endorsement by
such men as President Dwight D. Eisenhower,
who has said:
"By making possible ever greater oppor
tunity for the exercise of democratic re
sponsibility on the campus, and by enabling
American students and students of other
lands to work together toward the solution
of their common problems, the United States
National Student Association is rendering a
significant service to the people of this coun
try and to the world."
For those who have questions about the
actual functioning of NSA, this is a chance to
meet several of the students who attended the
national NSA convention held last August and

to hear first-hand reports on what took place.
And for those who are enthusiastic about the
future of NSA, this is the night to offer the sup
port and suggestions which will make that po
tential a reality.
Stanford joined NSA last fall on a one-year
trial basis. During this past year there has been
no sudden influx of "practical benefits" such
as discount systems to which students could
point and say "that is NSA."
Because there has been no immediate tan
gible benefit from NSA, the general attitude
has been one of dissatisfaction with an organi
zation full of "wide-eyed idealists" who ac
complish nothing.
NSA does sponsor programs which are of
direct material gain to each student, and dis
count systems are a part of that program.
NSA is also a thinking and debating and
speaking organization which represents col
lege students on issues such as academic free
dom, school segregation, and student taxation.
If the voice of NSA has been a weak one, so
has Stanford's.
Which is why we hope that tonight, when
NSA looks to Stanford for ideas, it won't look
in vain.
