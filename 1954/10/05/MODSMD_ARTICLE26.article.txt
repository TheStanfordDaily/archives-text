# Invasion From the East
## 
### 
Could it be that Stanford is casting off its tra
ditional cloak of conservatism and adopting the
rash fashion ways of the "collegiate," "gung
ho" East?
Could it be that the colorful denim styles of
the Farm are giving way to the garb of Welles
ley, Vassar, and Princeton?
From the looks of things so far, it could be.
For example: among the thousands of fans
who filed into the Stanford Stadium the other
day were roughs dressed in charcoal grey and
khaki Bermuda shorts, and in checked and
plain waistcoats. This is typical at a Harvard-
Brown contest, but this is the West.
The usual T-shirt, "BAC cashmere," apparel
is being replaced by pink, yellow, and narrow
striped shirts by many of the male populace.

The button-downs are giving way to the col
lar pin. The straight collar is being supplanted
by the round collar.
The white bucks, which are standard equip
ment for many Stanford girls and die-hard Law
renceville grads, are all over campus walks.
The charcoal or oxford grey suit with regi
mental stripe tie is also in evidence.
And the coeds have finally added the Ber
muda shorts and knee-length socks to their
wardrobes, not to mention charcoal grey suits
so that they can be their date's twin.
The infiltration of Eastern style isn't com
plete, however. Plaid kilts are missing and
only a select few have blazers.
But the Eastern fashions are heeding Gree
ley's advice and are coming West.
