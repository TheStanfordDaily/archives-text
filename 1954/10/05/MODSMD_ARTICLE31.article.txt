# 'Peaceful World Society' Is Aim of Rhodes' Grant
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
A half-century has elapsed since Cecil Rhodes, philanthropist
and diamond monarch of the world, died, providing in his will for
a plan which he dreamed would "unify the English-speaking
peoples of the world."
A trust, providing for the famous Rhodes Scholarships, was set

up for outstanding students of the
British dominions, Germany, and the
United States. Thirty-two are se
lected every year from the United
States.
The English philanthropist be
lieved that members of such a care
fully selected, elite group would
eventually become their nations'
leaders, and having studied on com
mon ground at Oxford, would have a
feeling of affinity and be able to
bring about a peaceful world society.
The method of selection in the
United States starts on the college
level, with each institution appoint
ing two or three to its state commit
tee for selection and four or five to

other state committees. A student
may seek application either in his
home state or the state where he is
attending college, provided he has
studied there two years. Two are
appointed from the state committees,
who then pass on to regional com
mittees composed of six states, who
have the final say in appointing four
scholars.
Cecil Rhodes sought scholars pot
only for their academic achievement,
but also for their qualities of charac
ter. personal leadership, and skill in
athletics. He sought the well

rounded individual, the "man most
likely to succeed." "The last thing
I want," Rhodes said, "is a hook
worm."
The following qualifications have
been set: a candidate must be a male
citizen of the United States with at
least five years' residence; he must
be between the ages of 19 and 25 on
Oct. 1, 1955 (although a candidate
serving in the Armed Forces for
over 90 days since June 27, 1950,
may deduct the period of service);
he must have completed his sopho
more year by the time of applica
tion; and he must receive official
endorsement of his college or uni
versity.
A t'6oo stipend is allotted each
Rhodes scholar, and the GI Bill of
Rights or any other military educa
tional funds apply to Oxford as well
as to American universities.
Scholarship appointment is for
two years, with a possible third if a
scholar's studies warrant such an
award.

Stanford has been successful in
the past few years in nominating
successful candidates. Ralph Amado.
a physics major who received his
degree here last year, will begin his
s'tudies at Oxford this month.
