# Taylor—'Don't Overestimate Stanford'; Erdelatz—'This Is Our First Big Test'

Navy Coach Eddie Erdelatz, in looking toward Saturday's game at Stanford Stadium, said yes
terday, "We've done well in the minors. Now let's see how we do in the big leagues."
There's no doubt his team has done well so far. They defeated William and Mary, 27-0, and
trounced Dartmouth, 42-7. That's 69 points scored by the Middies against but seven for their op
ponents.
The Navy eleven may be a good team, but they're not a powerhouse, publicity director John
Cox commented to sportswriters yesterday. Th ey rolled up five touchdowns in ten minutes in

the last quarter Saturday. That in - ,
dicates something besides an out
standing offense; a few breaks, and
perhaps a collapsed Dartmouth de- J
fense.
According to witnesses, Navy's of
fense, like Illinois', is sparked by a
powerful backfield. The Ulini, who
succumbed easily to the Cards last
week, 12-2, feature speedy running
backs. Navy, on the other hand, has
hard-driving runners.
Coach Chuck Taylor yesterday
cautioned fans not to overestimate
Stanford's abilities on the basis of
last week's game. "Illinois is not
as strong a team as many people
originally thought. Our line play
proved the difference in the game.
Because of it, we were able to
stop their olTense and move, our
selves, on the ground."
After viewing the films, Taylor
praised center Jerry Goldberg for
his fine work as a linebacker. "Jerry
did a good job for us, and was the
key to our defensive play," he said.
The coach also mentioned half
back Dorsey Atkinson. Though he
carried the ball only once (for a gain
of 13 yards), his blocking and tack
ling game has improved consider
ably, Taylor commented.
He was cautious about praising
the Cards too highly for Saturday's
victory. "We missed a lot of blocks,
particularly downfield," he said.
And though we didn't need it, our
passing game looked bad. "We'll
work on that this week."
The mentor then turned to the
upcoming game. "On our only
look at Navy, we found them to
have fine, hard - running backs.
They will be helped this weekend
by the return of Phil Monahan,
who until now has been injured."
The two best players on the Mid
die team, according to Cox, are half
back Bob Craig and end Ron Beagle.
Craig raced 61 yards for a score

against Dartmouth, and romped 69
yards for a tally in the opener. Still
another run, of 57 yards, was called
back.
Beagle had been a so-so performer
at left end until this season. Last
year he caught 14 passes for 146
yards gained. Yet last Saturday
alone he snared eight tosses for 105
yards, including two for TD's.
Craig is light—l6B pounds. The
other halfback. Jack Garrow, is
only 170. Two other good players
are fighting it out for the full
back spot.
Phil Monahan, from nearby Bur
lingame, was a Navy standout last
season at halfback. He was shifted
to full in spring practice, and suf
fered a knee injury. Following a
summer operation, he participated

in the first scrimmage this fall and
injured the other knee.
Monahan saw no action against
W&M, and only a few moments of
play last week. But it is believed he
will be ready for woi'k Saturday. He
may have a hard time making the
starting lineup, though.
The other fullback is Joe Gattuso,
who last season carried the ball a
full hundred yards farther than any
other Navy player. Both Monahan
and Gattuso are definite scoring
threats. It is believed Gattuso will
start, but Monahan can play if
needed.
The Navy weakness, as with Il
linois, may be in the line. Strategy
for the Cards will probably be
similar to last week: stop the run
ners before they can get into the
secondary.
However, the Middie passing at
tack will be stronger than the Illi
ni's: quarterback John Weaver can
be dangerous when throwing to
Beagle. The first-string signal caller,
George Welsh, has been injured.


INJUNS BEWARE—Fullback Joe Gattuso is a big scoring threat
for the Navy team that faces Stanford this weekend at the
Stadium. Gattuso last season carried the ball 98 times for 412
yards—a 4.2 average and over 100 yards more than any other
ball-carrier. He will be pressed for the starting berth, though, by
big Phil Monahan, who until now has been injured.
