85 yards running through and around the Illini line and was
very instrumental in the Indian win. Illinois captain lan Smid
and tackle John Gremer (72) are attempting to pull Tarr back

Roger Wolf (75) watch the score as Illini backs Bob Wiman (33)
and Mickey Bates (44) come up too late. Tarr will be in action
