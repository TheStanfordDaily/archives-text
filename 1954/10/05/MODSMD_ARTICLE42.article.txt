# NCAA Faces Crisis Over Video Problem
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
"We've got to do something about the present system of TV
football coverage."
This represents Stanford Athletic Director A 1 Masters' views on
the NCAA "Game of the Week" video program. The present set
up, which allows only one college game to be televised each

week, was supposed to be a tempo
rary substitute until a more thor
ough study could be but Mas
ters stated that it now appeared to
be permanent.
"I hope that the I3ig Ten threat.
I hinted at by Illinois Athletic Direc
j tor Doug Mills, to withdraw from
' the NCAA over the TV question.

will cause the video committee to
modify their stringent control.''
Masters continued.
The athletic director went on to
explain the present television setup.
The NCAA has a special TV com
mittee, but this group is controlled,
not by the big football schools which
are vitally affected by it, but by all
NCAA members, many of wh6m
don't even field football teams. This
committee arbitrarily lists the game
that is to be shown all over the
nation each week.
"They televise the Illinois game,
which cuts the attendance about 15,-
000, but"they won't let us show the
Big Game which is an automatic
sellout," Masters said. "All we get

from last Saturday's showing is 20
per cent of $70,000 plus an equal
share with the other PCC schools of
the remaining 80 per cent."
This means Stanford received
about $20,000 from the Dumont TV
network, while they lost $45,000
from the drop at the gate.
Masters says he doesn't go along
with the Notre Dame demand for
unlimited television coverage, be
cause that would wipe out many
small colleges, but there is no rea
son why we can't work out rea
sonable limited regional TV cover
age.
Masters stated that a regional plan
for the PCC would mean TV of
about 15 or 20 games a seascm. These
would all be West Coast games. The
broadcast would be blacked out in
the immediate area of the game un
less it was a sellout as in the case
i of the Big Game or perhaps USC
UCLA. The game would also be
blacked out in any other areas
where a local game was being
played.
Under this system Friday night
games at the Coliseum would be
shown in the Bay Area and the
Northwest, and if there was no Sat
urday afternoon Los Angeles game,
fans down there could view a top
Stanford or Cal tilt.

Masters continued.
The athletic director went on to
explain the present television setup.
The NCAA has a special TV com
mittee, but this group is controlled,
not by the big football schools which
are vitally affected by it, but by all
NCAA members, many of wh6m
don't even field football teams. This
committee arbitrarily lists the game
that is to be shown all over the
nation each week.
"They televise the Illinois game,
which cuts the attendance about 15,-
000, but"they won't let us show the
Big Game which is an automatic
sellout," Masters said. "All we get

from last Saturday's showing is 20
per cent of $70,000 plus an equal
share with the other PCC schools of
the remaining 80 per cent."
This means Stanford received
about $20,000 from the Dumont TV
network, while they lost $45,000
from the drop at the gate.
Masters says he doesn't go along
with the Notre Dame demand for
unlimited television coverage, be
cause that would wipe out many
small colleges, but there is no rea
son why we can't work out rea
sonable limited regional TV cover
age.
Masters stated that a regional plan
for the PCC would mean TV of
about 15 or 20 games a seascm. These
would all be West Coast games. The
broadcast would be blacked out in
the immediate area of the game un
less it was a sellout as in the case
i of the Big Game or perhaps USC
UCLA. The game would also be
blacked out in any other areas
where a local game was being
played.
Under this system Friday night
games at the Coliseum would be
shown in the Bay Area and the
Northwest, and if there was no Sat
urday afternoon Los Angeles game,
fans down there could view a top
Stanford or Cal tilt.

"We've got to do something about the present system of TV
football coverage."
This represents Stanford Athletic Director A 1 Masters' views on
the NCAA "Game of the Week" video program. The present set
up, which allows only one college game to be televised each

week, was supposed to be a tempo
rary substitute until a more thor
ough study could be but Mas
ters stated that it now appeared to
be permanent.
"I hope that the I3ig Ten threat.
I hinted at by Illinois Athletic Direc
j tor Doug Mills, to withdraw from
' the NCAA over the TV question.

will cause the video committee to
modify their stringent control.''
