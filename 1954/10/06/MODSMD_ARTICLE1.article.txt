provide a basis for the further im

Although the scope of the study
will be defined more clearly as Ihe
work proceeds, the tentative plan is
that attention will he given to three
broad questions:
1. What can he done to increase
Ihe effectiveness of undergraduate
teaching? This includes consider
ation of the relation between
teaching and research, the admin
istration of undergraduate educa
tion, and problems of salary.
2. What steps can be taken lo
improve the intellectual motiva
tion of Stanford undergraduates?
Related questions here concern
the ability and preparation of en
tering students, the intellectual
atmosphere of the campus, and the
kinds of careers chosen by Stan
ford graduates.
3. What changes in course offer
ings and requirements are need
ed?' Included here arc both the
problems of general education as
involved in the lower division
requirements and the problems of
specialization as involved in the
major systems. Also included are
Ihe questions concerning inde
pendent study and honors pro
grams as well as those assmiatcH
with Hie improvement of the
methods used in appraising stu
dent achievement.

the participation of undergraduate
students in the study by working
