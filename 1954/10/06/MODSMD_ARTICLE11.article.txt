### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Oct. 5
(UP) -The United States accused
Russia today of making a "gratui
tous and wildly inaccurate" charge
that the American Navy is respon
sible for attacks on shipping off the
Chinese Communist coast.
Chief Soviet Delegate Andrei Y.
Vishinsky, asking that the United
Nations take up his complaint
against the attacks, called the Chi
nese Nationalists a bunch of "would
be pirates," but he said the United
States must . hare the responsibility
because the waters in which attacks
have occurred are under American
control.
"I doubt that the Soviet delegate
really believes his own charges,"
American Delegate Henry Cabot
Lodge, Jr., replied. "He is totally
incapable of documenting it or pro
ducing any facts to show any re
sponsibility at all on the part of my
country."
