# Card Display Rules Outlined
## 
### 
As a result of the Stanford card
section's first performance at last
week's Illinois game, steps are being
taken by Rally Com to make sure
errors present in last Saturday's
card stunts do not occur again.
Card stunt chairman Jim Roberts
emphasizes that if the following
simple rules are followed by those
in the card section the execution
and appearance of the card tricks
will be greatly improved:
1. DO NOT THROW CARDS.
There is only a limited supply and
they are expensive to replace if lost
or destroyed.
2. PASS CARDS TO YOUR LEFT
AFTER STUNTS ARE FINISHED.
There will be a Rally Com member
at the left end of each row to col
lect them.
3. LISTEN TO LEADER AND
FOLLOW HIS DIRECTIONS. From
now on there will be only one per
son calling the card stunts and he
will be in plain sight and within
hearing distance.
4. SIT OVER WHITE MARKS.
There is a white mark over each
hook where the cards are hung.
5. FLIP CARDS. By holding cards
in the middle, rather than too high
or too low, it becomes easy to flip
from one stunt to another.
6. HOLD CARDS AT EYE LEV
EL. Cards should be held so that
only the part of the face and head
from the eyes up is visible.
