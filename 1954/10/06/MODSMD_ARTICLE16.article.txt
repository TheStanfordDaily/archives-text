## 'Farm Follies' Revue to Feature Campus Talent in Amphitheater 
### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
Two big events tonight will open a jampacked calendar for
Stanford's Back-to-the-Farm week. Beginning this evening will be
the student-faculty dinner, followed by "Farm Follies," an hour
long revue of campus talent, at 7:30 in Frost Amphitheater.
Main event of the evening, the Follies will feature an assortment

of campus student and faculty talent,-
emceed by grad student Richie Mey
er, and Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler.
On the faculty side of the program
are Professor David E. Faville, of
the Biz School, Professor Robert M.
Loper, who teaches acting and di
recting here, and Mr. and Mrs. Bill
White from the Main Library.
White, a former tapdancer, singer,
and band leader, will do several
dance routines and songs from his
wide show business repertoire, while
Mrs. White said she would play one
or tv/o numbers on the trumpet,
"probably 'Tenderly" and some oth
ers."
Faville, who is well-known among
the faculty for his comedy routines
will do two numbers, "Jams from
the Opera," and "Anne Boleyn," an
old English ballad. Loper, just end
ing his first year at Stanford, is
scheduled to do several light-comedy
dramatic sketches.
President Wallace Sterling will
officially open the show with . a
speech on the traditions of Stan
ford's Back-to-the-Farm Week, and
James Triolo, former cheerleader
and class of '35, will lead group
singing.
Upholding the student's end of the
evening show, Spring Show head
liner Sylvia Haining, Paul Burk
hardt, Suzy Klein and Ron Engle
hart will be in on the act. Klein,
who danced in last year's Gaieties,
and Englehart, a transfer from Harv
ard where he Starred with the Hasty
Puddings, will do an interpretative
dance number.
Hairung will take over the stage
doing Cole Porter's "Can't Help Lov
ing That Man" with the special Hain
ing-Ethel Merman style, backed up

by Bill Burkhardt, who will do
"What's the Hurry," a tune from
the 1953 Gaieties, written by Dick
Bai'e. Burkhardt, a junior, and
member of Ram's Head, transferred
from Northwestern University.
Follies planners stated that people
who come to watch the show should
be sure to dress warmly for the
hour-long entertainment session. Co
master of ceremonies Winbigler said
he was "hoping for a big turnout
of both faculty and students. The
show," he said, "promises to be a
very interesting one, and I think
it's a very appropriate way to start
off Back-to-the-Farm week."
Winbigler also commented on the
student-faculty dinner which will
precede the "Farm Follies." He said
that he has heard "very favorable
reactions concerning the dinners,"
and that it was a "very fine pro
gram."
The dinners, designed to bring the
teachers and students of Stanford
closer together, will include dinner
for about 80 professors and their
wives at different living groups and
Eating Clubs, with many students
also invited to faculty homes for
dinner.
The dinner and the Follies this
evening are only a start to the now
traditional Back-to-the-Farm week
celebrations. Tomorrow's highlight
will be the Old Car Parade, start
ing at 4:30 p.m. in front of the Fiji
house, to be followed that evening
by Cardinal-sponsored football mov
ies in Cubberley Auditorium.
Shown will be movies of famed
Stanford quarterback Frankie Al
bert, films of last year's Stanford-
UCLA gridiron classic, and high
lights of last year's Pacific Coast
League football.
Festivities Friday will be given
over mostly to the Olympic Day
celebration, with 21 seniors entered
in the relay race to Rudy's. In the
evening a pre-game rally at 4:45
p.m. and an informal dance are
scheduled.
Saturday's big event is the Stan
ford-Navy game, which will be fol
lowed by open houses at Storey and
Lathrop, and a street dance spons
ored by AWS.
During the halftime of the football
game, Stanford cheerleaders from
earlier years will lead the rooting
section.
