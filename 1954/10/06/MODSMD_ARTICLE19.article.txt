# A 						Study of Education
## 
### 
A "Study of Undergraduate Education" will
be conducted at Stanford this year.
The idea of a committee tackling the prob
lems of undergraduate education is not a new
one. In the, past there have been many such
studies. Some have dealt with general cur
ricula problems. Others have considered the
duties and qualifications of the professor. Still
others have specialized in Lower Division re
quirements.
This study is different.
It is different because the Executive Com
mittee in charge of the study is composed of
many of the best-known and most-respected
members of the Stanford faculty and admin
istration.
It is different because every effort is being
made to assure board representation of the
faculty and to solicit opinions from the student
body.
It is different because the area of this study
has not been limited to any one phase of aca
demic life, or even to the strict category of
academics.
And it is different because this study coulpl
produce a new Stanford.
In the course of the study, the Committee
will face and endeavor to solve the recurrent
problems of the undergraduate study program
problems such as modernizing the language
requirements, improving the quality of fresh
man courses, and adapting programs to the
special requirements of students majoring in

engineering, law, or medicine.
But the Committee will do more.
It will consider the intellectual atmosphere
of Stanford—its defects, the reasons for those
defects, and suggestions for improvement.
This will not be an easy task.
An intellectual atmosphere is not a tangible
object, to be grasped and nailed down with a
few terse words of description.
It is abstract, evasive, tenuous, indescribable
—and the backbone of a university.
Occasionally a student is aware of the intel
lectual atmosphere at Stanford, and is dis
appointed.
He wondfers what has happened to the in
tense enthusiasm and eager curiosity he
brought to Stanford as a freshman. He feels
that somehow he has not taken advantage of
all that Stanford has offered.
For other students, the realization that they
are in some ways unfitted to face the world out
side Palm Drive comes only after graduation.
Faculty and administration leaders have also
realized that a certain spirit is missing at Stan
ford. They have decided that this situation
needs-correction, as well as the more specific
matters of curricula.
This, then, is the scope of the new study. It
is broad. It is indefinite. It deals with ideas as
well as examples, with the abstract as well as
the concrete.
We hope it will go far toward producing a
new and better Stanford.
