WASHINGTON, Oct. 5 (UP)—Fo-
I ice resorted to scattered arrests and
"school or else" ultimatums here to
day to break up student demonstra
tions against racial integration.
Student leaders at one high school
launched a back-to-the-classroom
movement.
Simultaneously Baltimore County
Superior Judge James K. Cullen
ruled that the city of Baltimore
acted legally and "with discretion"
in ending segregation in its schools
Sept. 1.
He threw out a petition by six
parents and two outside groups—in
cluding the new National Association
for the Advancement of White Peo
ple— to require the city to return to
segregated schools.
Cullen said the Supreme Court
had outlawed school segregation and
"the law of the land must be ac
cepted." He said, "Wc live in a
country where our rights and liber
ties have been protected under a
system of laws which wc know are
the best known to man."
In Washington some 2,000 senior
and junior high school students
staged mass demonstrations, most of
them short-lived, against admission
of Negroes and whites to the same
schools.
