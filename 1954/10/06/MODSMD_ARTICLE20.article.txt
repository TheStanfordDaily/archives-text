# Statistics and 'Security Risks'
## 
### 
The hottest issue of all—communism within
the United States — has the political ther
mometer close to the boiling point as the day
of judgment for the GOP looms less than a
month away.
Vice-president Richard Nixon ignited the lat
est controversy with the assertion that the ad
ministration is "kicking the communists and
the fellow travelers and the security risks out of
the government, not by the hundreds, but by
the thousands."
Democratic National Chairman Stephen
Mitchell immediately steamed forth with de
mands for the names of all communists and
security who were released.
Secretary of Defense Wilson, suspended
somewhere in the middle, warmly assured the
press that the number of security risks now
under investigation or already ousted from' the
four-million-man military setup is "happily
guite small percentagewise."
And so the fireworks continue, increasing
in magnitude and intensity as the campaign
moves forward.

We would like to remind the gentlemen of
both parties of a simple fact of linguistics be
fore the air becomes any hotter.
The term ' security risk," as applied to per
sons working for the government, is not a
synonym for "communist."
Security risks include those who drink too
much or are homosexuals or who have a moth
er-in-law who belongs to an organization on
the Attorney General's list.
Employees who have been fired for lack of
competence or who retire voluntarily from gov
ernment service often find themselves tabulat
ed as "security risks."
To make political dynamite out. of the sta
tistics on the number of persons released from
government service is an unwarranted smear
on the lives of many loyal Americans.
We would suggest that barnstorming poli
ticians find a target for their verbal gunfire
other than the large corps of government em
ployees who have served and continue to
serve them so well.
