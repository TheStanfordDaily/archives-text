# Bailey—'McCarthy Has Hurt Our Cause'

### RUTH WOLPE 
"McCarthyism and Other Isms" was the topic of the question
and answer period led by Dr. Thomas A. Bailey, executive head
of the History Department, Monday night at the meeting of the
Political Union Democrats.
"McCarthy has become almost a religion," said Bailey. "His

followers have become fanatical and
those who oppose him have become
fanatical." In many ways, he con
tinued, he is like Huey Long.
"McCarthy has hurt our cause . . .
by these diversionary tactics," he
stated. Instead of uniting against
the enemy abroad, we have devel
oped fears in people abroad about
ourselves. Disunity and distrust of
America abroad has done much to
further the Communist cause.
Dr. Bailey called the censorship of
liberal ideas "unfortunate." "If we
all have to think safe ideas, we won't
get many new ideas," he said.
"America originally was made up of
dissenters. What I'm afraid of is that
some awfully good ideas won't be
expressed because they aren't safe
ideas."
Questioned about academic and
political freedom at Stanford, Dr.
Bailey replied, "We have a motto
here that 'the winds of freedom
blow,' and so far as I know, they
blow!"
The Oppenheimer affair, he said,
will hurt our defense program be
cause the better scientists will not
endure what they now must put up
with. "It is a surprise to rrie," he

continued, "that there are yo many
abie people in the foreign service,
where they are paid low in salary
and high in abuse."
On the Eisenhower administration,
Dr. Bailey said that on the whole,
considering that the President was
a rank amateur, he's done somewhat
better than we might have thought
and hiis restored considerable dig
nity to the Presidential office.
