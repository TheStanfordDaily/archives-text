## 
### 
Stanford's defending Southern Division water polo champs ,
open the 1954 season Friday at 4:30 against San Jose State in the
Encina Pool. i
The Indians play their first league game Saturday at 10 against
California's strong team. This g4me is also at the Encina Pool.

' Coach Tom Haynie's team has lost
six out of seven starters from last
year's great squad. Amon|f those
lost through graduation is Jim
Gaughran, captain of last year's
team, leading scorer in the league,
and All-Coast for three years:
Others not returning are Jim Lee
and Dave Murton, both all-league
performers. The other three starters
lost were Fritz Kunzel, John
Schmidt, and Wally Parks.
The only returning starter from
last season's team is this year's cap
tain-elect, Irwin Johnson. Also with
Johnson at forward will probably be
Dan Oiborne and Bob Bergland.
The guards probably will be Car
ver Nixon, Karl Brenner, and Bill
Clements, with Ed Barr as goalie.
Coach Haynie rates SC as prob
ably the strongest team, with Cal a
clo e second. Stanford is presently
picked for third with UCLA fourth.
However, these positions could
change a lot by season's end.
