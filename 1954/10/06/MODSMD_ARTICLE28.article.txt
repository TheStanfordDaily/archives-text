# Morley Placed On Waivers
## 
### 
The Washington Redskins, who
are fast becoming famous for their
personnel changes, went on the line
again Monday when Sam Morley,
Stanford's Ail-American end from
last season, and South Carolina's
Blackie Kincaid were placed on the
waiver list.
Another change was also effected
with the acquisition of tackle Bob
Morgan from the Chicago Cardinals.
The Redskins, who have yet to win
a game this season, haven't had the
same roster two weeks in a row.
Morley, who last year was on the
receiving end of the Bob Garrett
thrown passes that led the Cards to
an outstanding season, injured his
knee in practice for the annual
Shrine East-West game last January
and has not been playing up to par
since.
Garrett, number one draft choice
of the Cleveland Browns, was traded
and is at present playing for the
Green Bay Packers.
