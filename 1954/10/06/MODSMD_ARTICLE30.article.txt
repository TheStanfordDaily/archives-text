# Hard-Running Halfbacks Clash Saturday
## 
### 

HALF AND HALFâ€”These two halfbacks will be opposing each
other Saturday when Stanford hosts a strong Navy team at Stan
ford Stadium. Bob Craig (left) is the break-away specialist for
the Middies. This season he has already made three long runs:
61 yards against Dartmouth, and 69 and 57 yards against Wil
liam and Mary. Included in his romps last year were a 79-yard
burst against Princeton and a 69-yard punt return against Co-


lumbia. He's a sprinter and a hurdler on the track team, besides.
Ernie Dorn (right) has again this season been playing fine ball
for Coach Chuck Taylor. Last week against Illinois he raced off
70 yards in 16 carries, more than the entire Illini backfield com
bined. The Middies and the Indians are undefeated going into
Saturday's clash.
