## 
### 
Coach Chuck Taylor deemed yes
terday's scrimage in preparation for
teh Navy game "terrible." The In
dians ran through a half-hour wok
out and scored two touchdowns. Bill
Tarr added one extra point.
Taylor stressed passing in the drill,
with Don Kafka and John Brodie
doing the throwing. Jerry Gustaf
son and Steve Docter missed the
practice because of colds but both
will be back by Saturday. Tackle
Paul Wiggin banged a knee and will
sit out until the Middie tussle.
The scrappy junior, who has been
unable to gain lost weight will
undergo a medical checkup today.
Trainer Connie Jarvis didn't antici
pate any serious ailment, however.
Best news of the day was that sen
ior quarterback Jack Gebert, who
has been out with a knee injury
since the first week of fall practice,
was out in sweatclothes for the first
time. Gebert will suit up in about
two weeks but it is doubtful wheth
er he will play at all this year.
Gebert claimed he heard some
thing snap in his knee Monday night
while in bed, and when he got up,
he could stretch it straight for the
first time since he was upended ear
ly in September.
Back Jim Saras is due to get back
into action either today or tomorrow.
He suffered a pulled leg muscle.
Guard Paul Revak should be ready
by Monday.
Taylor shifted Jarvis Watson to
halfback in yesterday's workout so
that the hard-hitting fullback can
play both positions in case of injury
to Tarr, Dorn, or Young.

The Card mentor also announced
that Jim McCamant, whose ankle
injury is on the mend, would start
on Saturday in place of John
Stewart at left end. Steve Docter
will probably get the call at the
other wing position.
The Cards, who have been rated
among the top twenty teams by the
press polls for the first time this
season, also went through group
drills. The backs and ends worked
on pass patterns, while the line
labored on pass protection and line
blocking.
Taylor also had Bill Tarr, who
booted 17 extra points in a row be
fore the Illini tilt, attempting the
placements under game conditions.
Gebert, who owns a fine arm. also
has a talented toe.
