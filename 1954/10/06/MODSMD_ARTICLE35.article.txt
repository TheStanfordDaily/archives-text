# Uclans Dominate Statistics; Tarr Second in Rushing
## 
### 
After their two surprise wins over Oregon, and Illinois, the red
shirted Indians loom as the new powerhouse of the PCC. How
ever, you wouldn't be able to prove it with statistics.
Three weeks into football season UCLA and Oregon lead the

parade in the adding machine field.
The Uelans are tops in five depart
ments in PCC statistics. Coach Red
Saunders' Bruins are currently first
in rush offense, rush defense, total
defense, punts, and punt returns.
Oregon holds first in the two im
portant divisions of pass ocense, and
total offense.
The best Stanford can muster to
date is second in the punt column
and third in rush defense. The In
dians are fourth in total defense and
rush offense. Besides these the
Cards are strictly second division in
the record book.
Stanford does have something to
boast about with the fine individual
performance of fullback Bill Tarr.
Tarr was nosed out of first place in
rushing by Washington State's Duke
Washington.
Washington rolled up 252 yardsâ€”
a scant two yards more than Tarr's
250. Washington is averaging 6.2
yards per carry to Tarr's 4.8 yards.
Tarr is also second in PCC scor
ing with 24 points. SC's Jon Arnett
is first with 30 points on five touch
downs. Tarr has four TDs.
Oregon's veteran quarterback
George Shaw holds the lead in total
offense so far. Shaw's 420 yards
passing and 75 rushing give him a
total of 495 yards, 47 more than
Washington's Sandy Lederman.
