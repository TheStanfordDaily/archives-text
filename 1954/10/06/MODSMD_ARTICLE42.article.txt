# ASSU FOREIGN SCHOLAR
## Swiss Coed Finds Contrast In University Life Here 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Monica Kaufman, the blonde,
vivacious ASSU Foreign Schol
ar from Switzerland, is excited
and slightly bewildered by im
pressions gathered during her
first month in the United States.
In a recent interview, she stressed
the great differences she has wit
nessed between the Swiss and the
American university educational
programs. "Here," Monica said, "the
great emphasis is upon the building
of the well-rounded individual. So
cial and other extra-curricular ac
tivities appear to be as much a part
of a university's purpose as aca
demic pursuits."
"Now, in Switzerland, there is
complete concentration on academ
ics. There is no social life, a uni
versity having only one purpose and
that being to give a student an op
portunity to study in his own par
ticular Held for six years and then
to be immediately situated in an
academic career."
"In Switzerland," Monica recalled,
"students study all year round. They
never work during vacations as I
see they do here. Possibly this is the
one advantage that the Americans
hold ovpr the Swiss in that one
meets people outside of his own im
mediate circle."
"Oh, yes, we have a student gov
ernment at my university (Univer
sity of Zurich)," Monica said, "but
it is passive in the sense that it has
title, but does not function. It is
very hard to find students who think
it important to work with other stu
dents in an extracurricular sense,
;md waste valuable free time that
could be spent on academics.
"There are no exams in Switzer
land. Students are expected to se
lect a career that they will pui'sue
for their own interest and training.
They are people dedicated to educa
tion."
She cited another great contrast
between Swiss and American uni
versities—that of the foreign schol
arship program itself. "Here." she
said, "it is such a wonderful thing
that Americans arc so interested in
us, always asking us questions.
Abroad there is a big failure in that
Swiss students believe themselves
superior in the ability to think, and
therefore have no interest in for
eign scholars.
In the University of Zurich, Mon
ica—who was elected president of
her student government but de

clined on the grounds that it is not
the place of a Swiss woman to ac
cept such an office—worked hard to
integrate the foreign populacc by
social gatherings, but saw her idea
fail because of Swiss apathy.
Facing the question of interna
tional affairs in which Switzerland
is known for its historically neutral
stand, Monica first gave insight into
the little nation's ringside view of
the Geneva Conference. The Swiss,
she remarked, deemed it a failure
from the beginning, and found it
truly a great victory for the Com
munist countries.
Turning to the issue of the Amer
ican tariff on Swiss watches passed
this summer by Congress, Monica
reported great bitterness in Switzer
land over the action. Twenty-five
per cent of the watchmakers were
put out of work, she said, and pro
duction has rapidly declined. "Nev
ertheless, there is still a hope that
the United States may find a middle
ground on the tariff problem."
To a question concerning Ameri
can prestige in the Swiss republic,
Monica responded that there is a
great tendency to dislike the United
States both because of political is
sues in the United States and the
prototype of American tourists.
"The Swiss," Monica remarked,
"cannot understand why Senator Jo
seph McCarthy has such a great in
fluence in this country. Then, again,
I have found that the Swiss have
exaggerated the situation.
"The second reason for Swiss an
tipathy—that of the tourist trade—
arises from traditional national con
ventionality and the fact that Amer
icans have a relatively short national
heritage and do not have as great a
sense of appreciation for old gener
ation ideas."
"Americans are friendly and very
informal—such a contrast from my
country," she said with a broad,
warm smile spreading over her face.
"I do not feel at home, but I like it."
