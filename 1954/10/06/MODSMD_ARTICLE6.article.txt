# Agreement Reached On Trieste Line
## 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 5 (UP)—ltaly
and Yugoslavia agreed today to
partition the Free Territory of
Trieste in a major diplomatic
triumph for the West that ended
a nine-year feud and forged a
stronger defense line against
Soviet aggression.
The two nations accepted almost
exactly the same dividing line that
set off a year of bloodshed and bit
terness In the? ham-shaped section
of Adriatic coast when the United
States and Britain tried and failed
to settle it by decree last Oct. 8.
Today's historic decision was
achieved by a new type Anglo-
American cloak-and-dagger diplo
macy with Italian and Yugoslav
diplomats kept from face -to - face
meetings during the negotiations
carried out in four capitals. The
United States and Britain pledged to
guarantee the settlement.
It gave Italy the Allied-occupied
Zone A of Trieste and the city of
Trieste with a population of 257,000
and specified that Trieste is to be a
free port. Yugoslavia retained Zone
B with most of the hinterland
(called Venezia Giulia) and a popu
lation of 76,000.
Yugoslavia will be allowed to
build its own port' in Zone B under
the agreement, which becomes effec
tive in three weeks.
The entire Trieste area of 302
square miles is about the size of
New York City. During the months
of secret parleys, climaxed at Lon
don's nine-power conference, diplo
mats said much of the argument was
over territory "y° u could throw a
stone across."
Trieste has been disputed territory
for 22 centuries. It was the main
port for the Austro-Hungarian Em
pire and fell to Italy in World War
I. At the end of the second World
War Yugoslav partisans occupied if
for 40 days, during which Italy
claims 5,000 Italians disappeared.
British General Sir William Mor
gan made a pistol-point agreement
with the Yugoslav commander for
the division of the territory that was
the basis of the settlement today.
The accord closed one of the most
troublesome gaps in the unity of
the West. It frees Italy to join the
Balkan entente among Yugoslavia,
Greece, and Turkey, and Yugoslavia
to participate more closely with the
NATO powers.
It cleared the way for Italian
troops lo bold the Austrian border
while Yugoslavs hold the Lubljana
gap in event of invasion from the
East. Thus it plugs two more holes
which were used as historic gate
ways to invasion.
