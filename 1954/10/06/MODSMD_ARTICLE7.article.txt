# TUESDAY SERIES
## Spangenberg Speaks On Contrasts Within Brazil 
### RALPH CAHN 
Brazil, as seen by a professor of electrical engineering, was the
subject of the Tuesday Evening Series lecture last night.
Before a large audience in Memorial Auditorium, Dr. Kajrl R.
Spangenberg gave impressions of Brazil as he saw it over a 15-
month period while at the Institute of Aeronautical Technology,

Sao Paulo.
The Stanford professor, who
showed approximately 75 color
slides in accompaniment to his lec
ture, stressed the fact that "Brazil
is a land of contrast."
Spangenberg, who returned to
Stanford at the beginning of the
summer, was accompanied during
part of his trip by his wife and chil
dren.
The speaker showed throughout
the lecture examples of old and new
ways of life—often side by side. His
color slides pictured modern white
skyscrapers and ancient, architec
ture,, gently rolling country and rug
ged mountains.
Most of Dr. Spangenberg's time
was spent in Sao Paulo, where he
supervised organization of the elec
tronics division of the Aeronautical
Institute. The pictures of that city
show Sao Paulo to be "the Chicago
of Brazil: jumping-off place to t,he
interior," as he described it.
In Rio dc Janeiro, the professor's
camera demonstrated again the
theme of contrast. He showed flat

sandy beaches close by sharp peaks
rising thousands of feet above the
sand.
Transportation, according to Span
genberg, was quite varied: ox carts
and modern automobiles shared the
same super-highways.
In the streets where traditional
celebrations occurred before new
skyscrapers, where festivals featured
night-time floats pulled by horses
and lit by modern electric generat
ing systems—everywhere Dr. Span
genberg found contrast.
11c concluded by pointing out that
the people of Brazil are replacing
outmoded methods with new. It was
clear that the contrast of Brazil,
caused by the adjustment of people
to new ways of life, was one of the
high points of Spangenberg's trip.
He was introduced by ' Professor
Hutili H. Skilling, head of the De
partment of Electrical Engineering,
who offered the official "welcome"
of the Committee of Public Exer
cises, sponsor of the Tuesday Eve
ning Series.
