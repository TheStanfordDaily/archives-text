# NSA Meeting To Deal With Election Topic
## 
### 
Delegates to Tuesday night's
meeting of the National Students
Association voted that the next dis
trict session be devoted to an ex
change of information and ideas on
election problems and procedures.
This conference, scheduled for
Oct. 21 at the University of Califor
nia, will be attended by election of
ficials of NSA member schools and
other colleges of Northern Califor
nia.
The "idea session," conducted by
A1 Ivey, NSA district chairman and
regional vice - president, produced
several suggestions for future re
gional programs, and one project to
be started this fall.
The project adopted was the pub
lishing of a complete list of college
scholarships available to California
students.
Among the ideas discussed was
NSA sponsoring of a concert or po
litical speech. This would be given
in the San Francisco Opera House
or Civic Auditorium for all Bay
Area college students.
Also suggested was an interschool
Spring Sing, to be presented for
residents of the area. Participants
would be the winners of individual
school Spring Sings.
A1 Loomis. Stanford NSA co-ordi
nator, reported that the possibility
of discounts at local theaters is be
ing investigated. Other schools, in
cluding Cal, have adopted such stu
dent discount services.
Last week 11 students from Asia
and the Middle East visited the cam
puses of Stanford, Mills, and Cal.
Their tour was part of an NSA pro
gram which brings student leaders
from all over the world to become
acquainted with American univer
sity life.
Another project successfully con
ducted by NSA at Mills this fall was
a leadership training program for
officers of organizations and dormi*-
tories.
Mills was represented at Tuesday
meeting by Sally Johnson. NSA co
ordinator; and Diane Smith, student
body president. Cal delegates were
Joan Pardee, NSA cn-ordinator, and
Jan Stevens, editor of the Daily Cal.
