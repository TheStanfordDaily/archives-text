One of the early features of

Also on the schedule of events for

7:00 p.m.
Riding in the car with Balch will

trio, who will judge the parade, will
be suitably attired at keeping with
the tradition of Back to the Farm
week.
Beginning in front of the Fiji
house at 4:00 p.m., the parade, con
sisting of vintage vehicles "and any
thing else on wheels that wants to
enter," according to Chairman Bill
Tooley, will drive or be pushed to a
spot in front of the Bookstore, where
they will park. The judges will view
the procession from in front of the
postoffice.
The grandaddy of them all — a
1915 Pierce Arrow—has been enter
ed in the parade, along with "about
twelve others," including entries
from the Alpha Delt, Kappa Sig,
Sigma Chi, Delta Chi, Phi Delt, and
Phi Kap houses.
Trophies will be awarded for the
all-over best car in the parade, for
the best old car, and for the most
humorous entry. Officials stated that
entries will be open "right up to the
time of the parade, and that any ve
hicle, animal-powered or otherwise,
may enter, as long as it's on wheels.
Later in the evening, at 7:00 p.m.,
old football movies, sponsored by
Cardinals, will be shown in Cub
berley, and will include two sound
films, one of the classic Stanford-
UCLA tilt of last year, and 1953

Tomorrow's schedule of events is
topped by Olympic Day, starting at
3 p.m. from the Cellar when the
first 21 entrants in flapping white
togas will take up the torch and
head for Rudy's Alpine Inn. Relief
runners, stationed every quarter
mile, will carry the torch forward,
followed by the Dixieland Band in a
truck. The pre-game rally will be a
held at Rudy's after the runners ar
