# New Freshman Class Shows Excellent Records
## 
### 
A third of Stanford's new freshman crop made an "A" grade
average in high school and every last one of them was active in
extracurricular student affairs.
This laurel-heavy record was revealed today in a report pre
pared by Stanford's Admissions Office on the approximately 800

men and 400 women in the
class.
Competition for entrance in
the Clays of '58 was probably the
keenest in Stanford history, in the
opinion of Director of Admissions
Rixford K. Snyden
About one out of every three men
who applied and met Stanford re
quirements was accepted and iwo
out of every seven women.
About half were student officers in
high school, among them 82 student
body presidents, 147 senior
presidents, and 166 editors of school
papers or annuals.
To insure students of well-round
ed ability, participation in extra
curricular activity is one of the
main criteria used in selecting Stan
ford freshmen, the director of ad
missions pointed out. Two other
standards are applied—high school
grades and scores on the scholastic
aptitude test given by the College
Entrance Examination Board.
The Class of '58 is outstanding in
its College Board Scholastic Apti
tude Test scores, considerably out
distancing the average of the 53 U.S.
colleges requiring the test.
In fact, Stanford's freshman class
compares favorably with those
classes accepted for admission by a
.select group of institutions which,
like Stanford, have highly competi
tive admissions.
Of current Stanford frosh men, 80
per cent received scores in the ver
bal test of 450 or higher, while 91
per cent received scores in the
mathematical test above this figure.
Latest available comparable figures
for men in this select group, which
includes Yale, Harvard, Amherst,
Haverford, Swarthmore, Carleton,
and Princeton, indicate that 83 per
cent were above this score verbally

and 91 per ccnt mathematically.
Stanford's frosh women made rec
ords of approximately 93 per cent in
the verbal test and 73 per ccnt. in
the mathematical test above the 450
mark. The latest comparative fig
ures for a group including Welles
ley, Smith, Vassar, RadclifTe. Mount
Holyoke, Bryn Mawr, and Barnard
are 84 pet cent for the verbal and
66 per cent for the math.
Most of this year's freshmen—over
three-fourths of them — are public
school graduates.
The class was drawn from 37
states and seven foreign countries.
Nearly every California county is
represented.
About 100 men and 75 women (ap
proximately 15 per cent of the class)
are sons or daughters of Stanford
alumni. Another 10 per ccnt are
brothers or sisters of students al
ready attending the University.
As to age, Stanford freshmen have
settled back into the pre-World War
II pattern. Over 95 per cent are
either 17 or 18. Twenty arc 16 years
old, the youngest age represented.

missions pointed out. Two other
standards are applied—high school
grades and scores on the scholastic
aptitude test given by the College
Entrance Examination Board.
The Class of '58 is outstanding in
its College Board Scholastic Apti
tude Test scores, considerably out
distancing the average of the 53 U.S.
colleges requiring the test.
In fact, Stanford's freshman class
compares favorably with those
classes accepted for admission by a
.select group of institutions which,
like Stanford, have highly competi
tive admissions.
Of current Stanford frosh men, 80
per cent received scores in the ver
bal test of 450 or higher, while 91
per cent received scores in the
mathematical test above this figure.
Latest available comparable figures
for men in this select group, which
includes Yale, Harvard, Amherst,
Haverford, Swarthmore, Carleton,
and Princeton, indicate that 83 per
cent were above this score verbally

and 91 per ccnt mathematically.
Stanford's frosh women made rec
ords of approximately 93 per cent in
the verbal test and 73 per ccnt. in
the mathematical test above the 450
mark. The latest comparative fig
ures for a group including Welles
ley, Smith, Vassar, RadclifTe. Mount
Holyoke, Bryn Mawr, and Barnard
are 84 pet cent for the verbal and
66 per cent for the math.
Most of this year's freshmen—over
three-fourths of them — are public
school graduates.
The class was drawn from 37
states and seven foreign countries.
Nearly every California county is
represented.
About 100 men and 75 women (ap
proximately 15 per cent of the class)
are sons or daughters of Stanford
alumni. Another 10 per ccnt are
brothers or sisters of students al
ready attending the University.
As to age, Stanford freshmen have
settled back into the pre-World War
II pattern. Over 95 per cent are
either 17 or 18. Twenty arc 16 years
old, the youngest age represented.
A third of Stanford's new freshman crop made an "A" grade
average in high school and every last one of them was active in
extracurricular student affairs.
This laurel-heavy record was revealed today in a report pre
pared by Stanford's Admissions Office on the approximately 800

men and 400 women in the
class.
Competition for entrance in
the Clays of '58 was probably the
keenest in Stanford history, in the
opinion of Director of Admissions
Rixford K. Snyden
About one out of every three men
who applied and met Stanford re
quirements was accepted and iwo
out of every seven women.
About half were student officers in
high school, among them 82 student
body presidents, 147 senior
presidents, and 166 editors of school
papers or annuals.
To insure students of well-round
ed ability, participation in extra
curricular activity is one of the
main criteria used in selecting Stan
