# 'Back to Africa!'
## 
### 
"Back to Africa!"
White students milling around school yards
of high schools in the nation's capital, which
President Eisenhower had hoped would serve
as a model for the end of racial segregation
in schools, yelled at the newly-integrated
Negro students and waved signs:
"Send them back to the plantation!"
"We v/ant segregation!"
"Back to Africa!"
So they want to send them back to Africa.
Pick out the ones with black skins and put them
on a boat. Well, they came here in a boat.
They came here in chains, and you kids—
you, waiving your signs and yelling your dis
pleasure on the Washington streets —your
great-great-grandfathers invited them. They
invited them with clubs and ropes, on the Afri
can Gold Coast. The Negro was considered
one of an "inferior race." Perfectly permissible
to put him in a boat and bring him here.
"Back to Africa!" Reserve a third-class for
Booker T. Washington, kids. Ail he did was
entrench the Negro in our society. Tuskegee
Institute, the National Negro Business League
. . . the Negroes love his memory but you'll
send them "Back to Africa."
You won't have any trouble with the Negro
-Ralph Bunche will go with them, and he's a
pretty good peace-maker.

Of course you'll be sending people like
George Washington Carver you might send
the few hundred new products he developed
along, too.
Do you kids like music? You're sending a
fine contralto singer on that boat when Marian
Anderson goes aboard. Like Jazz? Bid Louis
Armstrong goodbye.
"Back to Africa!" You're sending 10 per cent
of the American people on that boat: more
than 15 million people. But you kids will do
even better than that in the nation's capital,
because you're sending more than one fourth
of the citizens of the District of Columbia.
The Negro came here more than 100 years
ago, and he got a rough deal then. Since that
time, he's been trying to fit into our society
. . . to earn respect. He's a citizen now. He's
had a few good breaks. He hasn't gotten much
from us, but he's contributed the best he's had.
So you see, kids, you can't send him "Back
to Africa." He's part of America now, and he
deserves his latest and biggest break: egual op
portunity for education. You can't hurt the Ne
gro's feelings any more by taunting him. He'll
just laugh, and rightly so. And, kids, there are
a great many people in this country now who'd
be glad to pitch in if the Negro took it into
his head to send you to Africa.

ago, and he got a rough deal then. Since that
time, he's been trying to fit into our society
. . . to earn respect. He's a citizen now. He's
had a few good breaks. He hasn't gotten much
from us, but he's contributed the best he's had.
So you see, kids, you can't send him "Back
to Africa." He's part of America now, and he
deserves his latest and biggest break: egual op
portunity for education. You can't hurt the Ne
gro's feelings any more by taunting him. He'll
just laugh, and rightly so. And, kids, there are
a great many people in this country now who'd
be glad to pitch in if the Negro took it into
his head to send you to Africa.
"Back to Africa!"
White students milling around school yards
of high schools in the nation's capital, which
President Eisenhower had hoped would serve
as a model for the end of racial segregation
in schools, yelled at the newly-integrated
Negro students and waved signs:
"Send them back to the plantation!"
"We v/ant segregation!"
"Back to Africa!"
So they want to send them back to Africa.
Pick out the ones with black skins and put them
on a boat. Well, they came here in a boat.
They came here in chains, and you kids—
you, waiving your signs and yelling your dis
pleasure on the Washington streets —your
great-great-grandfathers invited them. They
invited them with clubs and ropes, on the Afri
can Gold Coast. The Negro was considered
one of an "inferior race." Perfectly permissible
to put him in a boat and bring him here.
"Back to Africa!" Reserve a third-class for
Booker T. Washington, kids. Ail he did was
entrench the Negro in our society. Tuskegee
Institute, the National Negro Business League
. . . the Negroes love his memory but you'll
send them "Back to Africa."
You won't have any trouble with the Negro
-Ralph Bunche will go with them, and he's a
pretty good peace-maker.

Of course you'll be sending people like
George Washington Carver you might send
the few hundred new products he developed
along, too.
Do you kids like music? You're sending a
fine contralto singer on that boat when Marian
Anderson goes aboard. Like Jazz? Bid Louis
Armstrong goodbye.
"Back to Africa!" You're sending 10 per cent
of the American people on that boat: more
than 15 million people. But you kids will do
even better than that in the nation's capital,
because you're sending more than one fourth
of the citizens of the District of Columbia.
The Negro came here more than 100 years
ago, and he got a rough deal then. Since that
time, he's been trying to fit into our society
. . . to earn respect. He's a citizen now. He's
