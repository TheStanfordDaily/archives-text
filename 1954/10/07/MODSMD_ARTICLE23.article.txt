## An Honor Code at Dinner? 
### 
To the Editor:
«
Monday night I lost my billfold containing my Stern
Hall meal ticket. Supposing that my plight was not
unique in the history of the dinina hall and that policy
had been formed 1o insure that ticketless students
would not starve. 1 waited in line for my dinner as
usual.
But my waiting was in vain.
The ticket-puncher said that I would have to pay
for my dinner or go without. But how could I pay?
My money was In my billfold which I might never
si e again.
The purpose of this letter is not to lament an empty

stomach nor to challenge the Stern Hall staff to a
duel with celery stalks. Rather it is to pose a funda
mental question:
Stanford operates on the honor system. Is it not
then obligatory for Stanford to treat its students as
if they were honorable all the time—not just" when
taking examinations?
I resent the implication that I was trying to pro
mote a free meal with a hard-luck story. And I am
opposed to any university policy posited upon the
assumption that Stanford students are hoods at heart.
WAYNE DANIELSON
PS. Happy ending! I found my billfold. Cheers,
cheers, cheers. Now I can eat again!
