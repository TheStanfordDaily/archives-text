# Lavish Sets and Mob Scenes Don't Help 'The Egyptian'
## 
### TOM ARP 
"The Egyptian," enjoying a
smash run at the Stanford, is cer
tainly one of the dullest of the
Cinemascopic "spectatculars."
It depends for any interest at all
upon lavish sets and mobs of ex
tras, because there is little ac
tion and no distinguished act
ing.
The film is an adaptation of Mika
Waltari's novel, which I missed on
purpose. It may or may not be a
faithful transmutation, but no mat
ter; it is a bad movie. The title role
is filled by an actor named Edmund
Purdom — you'll have difficulty if
you try to find his name in the over
sexed advertisements for tlie picture,
but you may remember him as the
acting form for the singing voice of
Mario Lanza in "The Student
Prince."
Sinuhe, for this is the Egyptian's
name, is apparently a low - born
foundling (though you and I may be
sure that there will be a revelation
somewhere along the way) wfio en
meshes himself in the intrigues of
Egyptian royalty, manages to botch

! up his own life as a result, and even
adds a few complications to an over
complex struggle for the pharaoship
(or is it -dom?).
There are other and more inter
esting personalities in this star-stud
ded splash. Gene Tierney, for one.
She is a rather dark skeleton in the
royal closet, but true to her type
cast form she is even a little more
evil than she seems. Victor Mature
(enjoying almost as great a vogue in
Cinemascope as Robert Taylor) is
there too. He is a real stinker, a
power - hungry military type who
starts off as a friend of Sinuhe's, but
his evil tendencies make short work
pf that.
Others, and there are lots, are Mi
chael Wiltling, a.s Akhnaton the good
pharaoh; Bella Darvi. as a Babylon
ian seductress; Jean Simmons, as
Sinuhe's girl friend or something
I (the relationship is not too clear);
j and Peter Ustinov, as his servant.
The latter is the most capable per
former of the lot, and ought to be
ashamed of himself for being caught
up in something like this.
Plot-wise things are slow. Suffice
it to say that Sinuhe, a man of nat
ural goodness, is tempted, fails, and
must' regain his former beatified
state through a powerful effort of

will and good works. The accom
panying actors work upon him for
good or evil, little else. Miss Darvi,
who draws him to the depths of per
sonal degradation, is the most effec
tive, and her green and blue wigs
are nice. too.
The situation, briefly, is this:
Someone (Darryl F. Zanuck per
haps?) chose to present "The Egyp
tian" in the form of the normal Cin
emascope picture without the only
virtue the form has, the spectacle.
Even the mass of people and over
expensive sets are ineffective, and
since these comprise the business of
the new form it flops rather com
pletely.

adds a few complications to an over
complex struggle for the pharaoship
(or is it -dom?).
There are other and more inter
esting personalities in this star-stud
ded splash. Gene Tierney, for one.
She is a rather dark skeleton in the
royal closet, but true to her type
cast form she is even a little more
evil than she seems. Victor Mature
(enjoying almost as great a vogue in
Cinemascope as Robert Taylor) is
there too. He is a real stinker, a
power - hungry military type who
starts off as a friend of Sinuhe's, but
his evil tendencies make short work
pf that.
Others, and there are lots, are Mi
chael Wiltling, a.s Akhnaton the good
pharaoh; Bella Darvi. as a Babylon
ian seductress; Jean Simmons, as
Sinuhe's girl friend or something
I (the relationship is not too clear);
j and Peter Ustinov, as his servant.
The latter is the most capable per
former of the lot, and ought to be
ashamed of himself for being caught
up in something like this.
Plot-wise things are slow. Suffice
it to say that Sinuhe, a man of nat
ural goodness, is tempted, fails, and
must' regain his former beatified
state through a powerful effort of

will and good works. The accom
panying actors work upon him for
good or evil, little else. Miss Darvi,
who draws him to the depths of per
sonal degradation, is the most effec
tive, and her green and blue wigs
are nice. too.
The situation, briefly, is this:
Someone (Darryl F. Zanuck per
haps?) chose to present "The Egyp
tian" in the form of the normal Cin
emascope picture without the only
virtue the form has, the spectacle.
Even the mass of people and over
expensive sets are ineffective, and
since these comprise the business of
the new form it flops rather com
pletely.
"The Egyptian," enjoying a
smash run at the Stanford, is cer
tainly one of the dullest of the
Cinemascopic "spectatculars."
It depends for any interest at all
upon lavish sets and mobs of ex
tras, because there is little ac
tion and no distinguished act
ing.
The film is an adaptation of Mika
Waltari's novel, which I missed on
purpose. It may or may not be a
faithful transmutation, but no mat
ter; it is a bad movie. The title role
is filled by an actor named Edmund
Purdom — you'll have difficulty if
you try to find his name in the over
sexed advertisements for tlie picture,
but you may remember him as the
acting form for the singing voice of
Mario Lanza in "The Student
Prince."
Sinuhe, for this is the Egyptian's
name, is apparently a low - born
foundling (though you and I may be
sure that there will be a revelation
somewhere along the way) wfio en
meshes himself in the intrigues of
Egyptian royalty, manages to botch

! up his own life as a result, and even
adds a few complications to an over
complex struggle for the pharaoship
(or is it -dom?).
