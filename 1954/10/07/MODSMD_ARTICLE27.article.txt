charge of selling tickets, advertising
the concerts, and arranging for the
electricians, ushers, piano tuners,
and other crew members.
Further, they must meet the artist,
arrange suitable accommodations for
him. and, on the night of the per

Forum. This enables students to sell
or purchase tickets for one concert.

Concert Series office in the Nitery.

staff on a "first come, first served"
basis.
