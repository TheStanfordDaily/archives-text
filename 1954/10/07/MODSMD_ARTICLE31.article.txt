# Taylor Still Unhappy As Navy Contest Nears
## 
### 
After a brief 15-minute scrim
mage, Coach Chuck Taylor again
expressed displeasure over the way
the Stanford football team was pre
paring for the big intersectional
battle coming up with Navy. "We
looked dead, again today," Taylor
said after the head bashing.
The Indians worked largely on
passes, and several new patterns
were added to the repertoire in hope
of surprising the admirals - to - be.
The only touchdown of the scrim
mage was set up by a screen pass to
Sill Tarr covering 40 yards.
In the injury department, trainer
Connie Jarvis reported that there

were no new hurts, and that end
Jim McCamant would definitely be
ready by Saturday. McCamant
sprained his ankle against Illinois
and. cannot yet go at top speed.
Cardinal strategy for the game
will be to pass, unless the running
game goes exceptionally well, in
which case Stanford will play much
the same offense they showed
against the Ulini: one of sending
Tarr, Dorn, and Young off guard and
tackle at four or five yards a crack,
and methodically grinding out the
yardage.
