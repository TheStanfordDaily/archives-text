# Card Booters Open Season Against SJS
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
At 10 a.m. Saturday, Stanford's
varsity soccer team will make sev
eral "firsts": the Indians open their
1954 season; the booters play their
first game under their new head
coach, Fred Priddle; and the Indians
play San Jose State for the first time
in Stanford soccer history.
The Spartan entry, newest addi
tion to the growing Northern Cali
fornia Soccer Association, makes its
league debut against the Indians
with unknown potential.
To oppose the Spartans, Coach
Priddle has assembled a veteran
team, including seven starters
from last year's eleven. A record
turnout of 45 candidates greeted
the new coach at opening practice
last week.
If there is any weakness in the
1954 aggregation of "feetball" ar
tists, it is found at the fullback po
sitions, where graduation cost the
Cards most heavily. Four candidates
are in contention for Saturday's two
starting jobs: Ken Wilson, Sam
Thornton, and John Wohler, from
last year's jayvees, and Tom Lom
bard, a promising freshman.
The halfback spots are very well
stocked with veteran and fast-im
proving newcomers. Don Yates, Pe
ter Mack, and Sam Register/ all let
termen, occupy the firs*-string posi
tions, with Steve Griffith, Dick Babb,
and Bob Maddox ably backing them
up.
Four of the five forward line posi
tions will be occupied by veterans,
as Ail-American Sam Suarez an
chors what should be a powerful at
tacking wall. Bill Wren and Niels
Vinding are among the other re
turning linemen, while newcomer
Geof Gregory moves in at right
wing.
Ken Woods, a two-year veteran,
will probably start at goalie. He is
being pressed, however, for the
starting job between the posts by JV
veteran Fred Frye.
The main Stanford handicap Sat
urday will be lack of practice. The
Spartans started school earlier, and
have a two-week edge in practice.
