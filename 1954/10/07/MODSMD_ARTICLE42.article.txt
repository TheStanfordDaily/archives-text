## 
### 
Footballs, volleyballs, and golf i
balls will fill the air next Monday
when Stanford's intramural pro
gram begins its thirty-fifth year.
By the time the full program gets
under way, an estimated 1,900 stu
dents, participating for some 65 or
ganizations, will pit their skills in
touch football, volleyball, table ten
nis, golf, bowling, horseshoes, swim
ming, and boxing.
When winter quarter rolls around,
basketball, table tennis, and wres
tling will provide competition.
Spring quarter activities include
softball, volleyball, tennis, handball,
horseshoes, and track and field.
For the uninitiated, murals may
seem like a minor league affair. But
veterans know that fierce competi
tion marks all of the games.
There are three types of compe
tition: league, elimination, and
single-event play. Football, bas
ketball, softball, and volleyball
teams are in leagues, and the
league winners play at the end of
the season to determine the Uni
versity champion.
Horseshoes, handball, tennis, and
golf use the bracket-form elimina
tion tournament to determine the
winner. Track and swimming en
thusiasts vie for honors in a single

meet.
Intrnmurals are based on a point
system, whereby groups are
awarded a designated number of
points for a win in a particular
sport. The team with the most
points at year's end w ins the All -
University intramural champion
ship.
Last season, the Biz School rolled
to an easy championship with 524
points. The second-place team ac
cumulated only 281 points. The
Business School won titles last year
in volleyball, softball, table tennis,
horseshoes, handball, and golf.
All competitors must have medical
approval. Students currently en
rolled for at least six units ore eli
gible to participate. Those on social
probation are prohibited. Students
playing in major sports may not
compete during the time they are
squad members.
