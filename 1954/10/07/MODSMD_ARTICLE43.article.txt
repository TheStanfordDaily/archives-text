# QUARTZ CRYSTALS
## How a 1¼ hour "gem-cutting" operation became an 8-minute mechanized job 
### 
Jy PROBLEM: Preparing
Vjf "'vSk quartz crystals for use
as electronic frequency
controls calls for the
highest degree of precision. So much so,
in fact, that prior to World War II
skilled gem-cutters were employed to
do the job.
But during the war, there were not
enough gem-cutters to keep up with the
demand for crystals in radar, military
communications and other applications.
Western Electric tackled the job of
building into machines the skill and
precision that had previously called for
the most highly skilled operators.
SOLUTION: Here is how quartz crystals
are made now—by semi-skilled labor in
a fraction of the time formerly required:
A quartz stone is sliced into wafers on
a reciprocating diamond-edged saw,
after determination of optical and elec
trical axes by means of an oil bath and
an X-ray machine. Hairline accuracy is
assured by an orienting fixture.
The wafers are cut into rectangles on
machines equipped with diamond saws.
The human element is practically elim
inated by means of adjustable stops and
other semi-automatic features.
* The quartz rectangles are lapped
automatically to a thickness tolerance
of plus or minus .0001". A timer prevents
overlapping. Finally, edges are ground
to specific length and width dimensions
on machines with fully automatic micro
feed systems.

Most of these machines were either
completely or largely designed and 4e*.
veloped by Western Electric engineers.
RESULTS: With skill built into the
machines—with costly hand operations
eliminated—this Western Electric mech
anization program raised production
of quartz crystals from a few thousand
a year to nearly a million a month
during the war years. This is just one of
the many unusual jobs undertaken and
solved by Western Electric engineers.
