# KEAR Maintains Schedule In Spite of Union Walkout
## 
### JACK BYRNE 
An amazing lack of harmony
has arisen in the Bay Area's
"Station (or Good Music," KEAR.
The diai-ord began Tuesday morn
ing at 8:51 when the station's engi
neers and announcers turned the
transmitter off and walked out on
strike for improved wages and
working conditions.
At approximately 2 p.m. the same
rlay, the supervisory personnel of
the station had taken over and re
turned to the regular program
schedule, with the aid of one engi
neer.
When contactcd by phone yester
day afternoon, General Manager
Ken Hildebrandt announced that
business (and programs) would go
on as usual.
"We're on our regular schedule,"
he said, "and we're staying on, come
hell or high water."
The situation is complicated by
the fact that two separate unions
arc involved in the dispute. One is
the American Federation of Tele
vision and Radio Artists, AFL; the
other is the National Association of
Broadcasting Engineers and Techni
cians of the CIO.
"Prospects for a settlement don't
look good right now," Hildebrandt
said, "but it's up to the unions to

| pull their picket lines."
"We won't negotiate until the
[ pickets are gone," he stated.
Besides higher wages, the unions
I are asking for improved sanitary
facilities, installation of safety
equipment at the transmitter, and
cessation of "continual harassment,
such as being urged to work for
their employer on their day off."
Yesterday morning the unions
sent out "sponsor committees" to
visit the station's sponsors in the
hope of having advertising with
drawn. At noon yesterday, the un
ion reported some considerable suc
cess.
The station reported that they had
no notification of any advertising
withdrawals.
Hildebrandt also reported that a
threat had been made on the life of
the son of one of the supervisory
staff, but declined to name names.
He stated that the sheriff had been

notified.
Walter Moore, chief deputy of the
sheriff's oflice, reported that he had
talked on the phone with Hilde
hrandt about the .situation, but that
he had nothing to work on.
Further, Moore said, although he
had been asked to say nothing to
the press, KEAR had run a story on
the threat over the air.
"When I get something concrete to
work on, I'll move," Moore said.
''But they're handling this thing like
a bunch of kids, and I'm not going
to get caught in the middle."
KEAR reported they had received
some 1,000 calls and letters in the
past two days from listeners offering
assistance and donations.
"It's the most amazing thing I've
ever seen," Hildebrandt said.
