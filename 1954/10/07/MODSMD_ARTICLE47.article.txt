FOOTBALL THROUGH THE AGES
The football frenzy is upon us. But let us, in the midst of this
pandemonium, call time. Let us pause for a moment of tranquil
reflection. What is this game called football? What is its history?
Its origins? Its traditions? These are not idle questions, for when
we have the answers we will appreciate even more fully, enjoy even
more deeply, this great American game of football.
First of all, to call football an American game is somewhat mis
leading. True, the game is now played almost exclusively in America,
but, it comes to us from a land far away and a civilization long dead.
Football was first played in ancient Rome. Introduced by Julius
Caesar, it became one of the most popular Roman sports by the time
of Nero's reign. The eminent historian Sigafoos reports a crowd of
MMCLDDXVIII people at the Colosseum one Saturday afternoon
to see the Christians play the Lions.
With the decline of the Roman empire football fell into disuse.
The barbaric Huns and Goths preferred canasta. However, by the
Twelfth Century A.I), football had emerged from its twilight and
risen to its rightful place in the firmament of European pastimes.
The eminent historian Sigafoos reports that the whole continent
■was in the grip of wild excitement in the year 1192 when the
Crusaders, under Freddie Barbarossa, journeyed all the way to
Damascus to play the Saracens in the Fig Bowl game. The Crusaders
squeaked through, 23 to 21, on a field goal by Dick Coeur de Lion
in the closing seconds of the game.
October 21, 1512, will ever remain a red letter day in the history
of football. On that day Leonardo da Vinci, who has often been called
"The Renaissance Man" because of his proficiency in a hundred arts
and sciences, was painting a picture of a Florentine lady named
Mona Lisa Schultz. "Listen, Mona baby," he said as she struck a
pose for her portrait,"I keep telling you-don't smile. Just relax and
look natural."
"But I'm not smiling," she replied.
"Well, what do you call it?" he said.
"Gee, I don't know," said Mrs. Schultz. "It's just an expression,
kind of."
"Well, cut it out," said The Renaissance Man.
"I'll try," she promised.
And try she did, but without success, for a moment later the artist
was saying to her, "Look, Mona kid, I'm not gonna ask you again.
Wipe that silly grin off your face."
"Honest to goodness, The Renaissance Man," said she to him, "it's
no grin. It's just the way I look." _ !
"Well, just stop it," said Leonard testily and turned away to mix
his pigments.
When he turned back to Mona Lisa and saw the smile still on
lier face, he became so enraged that he seized the nearest object —
a casava melon, as it happened — and hurled it at her with all his
strength. Showing preat presence of mind, she caught the melon and
ran with it from the studio until The Renaissance Man's temner
should cool.
This was, of course, the first completed forward pass.
Another date dear to the hearts of all football fans is September 29,
1442. It was on this date, according to the eminent historian Sigafoos,
that a sixteen year old lad named Christopher Columbus tried out
for the football team at Genoa Tech. He failed to make the team
bccause he was too light. (He weighed at that time only 12 pounds.)
And why, you ask, is this date — September 29, 1442 — so dear to
the hearts of all football fans? Because young Columbus was so
heartbroken at not making the team that he ran away to sea. And
if that hadn't happened, he never would have discovered America.
And if Columbus hadn't discovered America, the world never would
have discovered tobacco. And if the world hadn't discovered tobacco,
football fans never would have discovered Philip Morris — which, as
every fan knows, is the perfect companion to football. As Sigafoos,
the eminent historian, says, "Land's sakes, I can't even imagine
football without Philip Morris. I'd sooner go to a game without my
raccoon coat than without my neat, rich tobacco-brown snap-open
pack of mild vintage Fhilip Morris Cigarettes which come in regular
or king-size at prices young and old can afford. Land's sakes!"
The end of football in Europe came with the notorious "Black Cox
Scandal" of 1587, in which Ed Machiavelli, one of the Pisa mob,
paid off the University of Heidelberg Sabres to throw the champion
ship game to the Chartres A. and M. Gophers. It was a mortal blow
to football on the continent.
But the game took hold in the American colonies and thrived as it
had never thrived before. Which brings us to another date that
remains evergreen in the hearts of football lovers: December 16,1771.
On that date a British packet loaded with tea sailed into Boston
harbor. The colonies had long been smarting under the English king's
tax on tea. "Taxation without representation," they called it, and
feelings ran high.
When on December 16, 1771, the British ship docked at Boston, a
semi-pro foctball team called the Nonpareil Tigers, coached by
Samuel (Swifty) Adams, was scrimmaging near the harbor. "Come,
ladsj" cried Swifty, seeing the ship."Let's dump the tea in the ocean!"
With many a laugh and cheer the Nonpareil Tigers followed Swifty
nboard and proceeded to dump the cargo overboard in a wild, dis
organized and abandoned manner. "Here now!" called Swifty
sharply. "That's no way to dump tea overboard. Let's get into some
kind of formation."
And that, fans, is how the "T" formation was born.

"Honest to goodness, The Renaissance Man," said she to him, "it's
no grin. It's just the way I look." _ !
"Well, just stop it," said Leonard testily and turned away to mix
his pigments.
When he turned back to Mona Lisa and saw the smile still on
lier face, he became so enraged that he seized the nearest object —
a casava melon, as it happened — and hurled it at her with all his
strength. Showing preat presence of mind, she caught the melon and
ran with it from the studio until The Renaissance Man's temner
should cool.
This was, of course, the first completed forward pass.
Another date dear to the hearts of all football fans is September 29,
1442. It was on this date, according to the eminent historian Sigafoos,
that a sixteen year old lad named Christopher Columbus tried out
for the football team at Genoa Tech. He failed to make the team
bccause he was too light. (He weighed at that time only 12 pounds.)
And why, you ask, is this date — September 29, 1442 — so dear to
the hearts of all football fans? Because young Columbus was so
heartbroken at not making the team that he ran away to sea. And
if that hadn't happened, he never would have discovered America.
And if Columbus hadn't discovered America, the world never would
have discovered tobacco. And if the world hadn't discovered tobacco,
football fans never would have discovered Philip Morris — which, as
every fan knows, is the perfect companion to football. As Sigafoos,
the eminent historian, says, "Land's sakes, I can't even imagine
football without Philip Morris. I'd sooner go to a game without my
raccoon coat than without my neat, rich tobacco-brown snap-open
pack of mild vintage Fhilip Morris Cigarettes which come in regular
or king-size at prices young and old can afford. Land's sakes!"
The end of football in Europe came with the notorious "Black Cox
Scandal" of 1587, in which Ed Machiavelli, one of the Pisa mob,
paid off the University of Heidelberg Sabres to throw the champion
ship game to the Chartres A. and M. Gophers. It was a mortal blow
to football on the continent.
But the game took hold in the American colonies and thrived as it
had never thrived before. Which brings us to another date that
remains evergreen in the hearts of football lovers: December 16,1771.
On that date a British packet loaded with tea sailed into Boston
harbor. The colonies had long been smarting under the English king's
tax on tea. "Taxation without representation," they called it, and
feelings ran high.
When on December 16, 1771, the British ship docked at Boston, a
semi-pro foctball team called the Nonpareil Tigers, coached by
Samuel (Swifty) Adams, was scrimmaging near the harbor. "Come,
ladsj" cried Swifty, seeing the ship."Let's dump the tea in the ocean!"
With many a laugh and cheer the Nonpareil Tigers followed Swifty
nboard and proceeded to dump the cargo overboard in a wild, dis
organized and abandoned manner. "Here now!" called Swifty
sharply. "That's no way to dump tea overboard. Let's get into some
kind of formation."
And that, fans, is how the "T" formation was born.

FOOTBALL THROUGH THE AGES
The football frenzy is upon us. But let us, in the midst of this
pandemonium, call time. Let us pause for a moment of tranquil
reflection. What is this game called football? What is its history?
Its origins? Its traditions? These are not idle questions, for when
we have the answers we will appreciate even more fully, enjoy even
more deeply, this great American game of football.
First of all, to call football an American game is somewhat mis
leading. True, the game is now played almost exclusively in America,
but, it comes to us from a land far away and a civilization long dead.
Football was first played in ancient Rome. Introduced by Julius
Caesar, it became one of the most popular Roman sports by the time
of Nero's reign. The eminent historian Sigafoos reports a crowd of
MMCLDDXVIII people at the Colosseum one Saturday afternoon
to see the Christians play the Lions.
With the decline of the Roman empire football fell into disuse.
The barbaric Huns and Goths preferred canasta. However, by the
Twelfth Century A.I), football had emerged from its twilight and
risen to its rightful place in the firmament of European pastimes.
The eminent historian Sigafoos reports that the whole continent
■was in the grip of wild excitement in the year 1192 when the
Crusaders, under Freddie Barbarossa, journeyed all the way to
Damascus to play the Saracens in the Fig Bowl game. The Crusaders
squeaked through, 23 to 21, on a field goal by Dick Coeur de Lion
in the closing seconds of the game.
October 21, 1512, will ever remain a red letter day in the history
of football. On that day Leonardo da Vinci, who has often been called
"The Renaissance Man" because of his proficiency in a hundred arts
and sciences, was painting a picture of a Florentine lady named
Mona Lisa Schultz. "Listen, Mona baby," he said as she struck a
pose for her portrait,"I keep telling you-don't smile. Just relax and
look natural."
"But I'm not smiling," she replied.
"Well, what do you call it?" he said.
"Gee, I don't know," said Mrs. Schultz. "It's just an expression,
kind of."
"Well, cut it out," said The Renaissance Man.
"I'll try," she promised.
And try she did, but without success, for a moment later the artist
was saying to her, "Look, Mona kid, I'm not gonna ask you again.

harbor. The colonies had long been smarting under the English king's
tax on tea. "Taxation without representation," they called it, and
feelings ran high.
When on December 16, 1771, the British ship docked at Boston, a
semi-pro foctball team called the Nonpareil Tigers, coached by
Samuel (Swifty) Adams, was scrimmaging near the harbor. "Come,
ladsj" cried Swifty, seeing the ship."Let's dump the tea in the ocean!"
With many a laugh and cheer the Nonpareil Tigers followed Swifty
nboard and proceeded to dump the cargo overboard in a wild, dis
organized and abandoned manner. "Here now!" called Swifty
sharply. "That's no way to dump tea overboard. Let's get into some
kind of formation."
And that, fans, is how the "T" formation was born.

FOOTBALL THROUGH THE AGES
The football frenzy is upon us. But let us, in the midst of this
pandemonium, call time. Let us pause for a moment of tranquil
reflection. What is this game called football? What is its history?
Its origins? Its traditions? These are not idle questions, for when
we have the answers we will appreciate even more fully, enjoy even
more deeply, this great American game of football.
First of all, to call football an American game is somewhat mis
leading. True, the game is now played almost exclusively in America,
but, it comes to us from a land far away and a civilization long dead.
Football was first played in ancient Rome. Introduced by Julius
Caesar, it became one of the most popular Roman sports by the time
of Nero's reign. The eminent historian Sigafoos reports a crowd of
MMCLDDXVIII people at the Colosseum one Saturday afternoon
to see the Christians play the Lions.
With the decline of the Roman empire football fell into disuse.
The barbaric Huns and Goths preferred canasta. However, by the
Twelfth Century A.I), football had emerged from its twilight and
risen to its rightful place in the firmament of European pastimes.
The eminent historian Sigafoos reports that the whole continent
■was in the grip of wild excitement in the year 1192 when the
Crusaders, under Freddie Barbarossa, journeyed all the way to
Damascus to play the Saracens in the Fig Bowl game. The Crusaders
squeaked through, 23 to 21, on a field goal by Dick Coeur de Lion
in the closing seconds of the game.
October 21, 1512, will ever remain a red letter day in the history
of football. On that day Leonardo da Vinci, who has often been called
"The Renaissance Man" because of his proficiency in a hundred arts
and sciences, was painting a picture of a Florentine lady named
Mona Lisa Schultz. "Listen, Mona baby," he said as she struck a
pose for her portrait,"I keep telling you-don't smile. Just relax and
look natural."
"But I'm not smiling," she replied.
"Well, what do you call it?" he said.
"Gee, I don't know," said Mrs. Schultz. "It's just an expression,
kind of."
"Well, cut it out," said The Renaissance Man.
"I'll try," she promised.
And try she did, but without success, for a moment later the artist
was saying to her, "Look, Mona kid, I'm not gonna ask you again.
Wipe that silly grin off your face."
"Honest to goodness, The Renaissance Man," said she to him, "it's
no grin. It's just the way I look." _ !
"Well, just stop it," said Leonard testily and turned away to mix
his pigments.
When he turned back to Mona Lisa and saw the smile still on
lier face, he became so enraged that he seized the nearest object —
a casava melon, as it happened — and hurled it at her with all his
strength. Showing preat presence of mind, she caught the melon and
ran with it from the studio until The Renaissance Man's temner
should cool.
This was, of course, the first completed forward pass.
Another date dear to the hearts of all football fans is September 29,
1442. It was on this date, according to the eminent historian Sigafoos,
that a sixteen year old lad named Christopher Columbus tried out
for the football team at Genoa Tech. He failed to make the team
bccause he was too light. (He weighed at that time only 12 pounds.)
And why, you ask, is this date — September 29, 1442 — so dear to
the hearts of all football fans? Because young Columbus was so
heartbroken at not making the team that he ran away to sea. And
if that hadn't happened, he never would have discovered America.
And if Columbus hadn't discovered America, the world never would
have discovered tobacco. And if the world hadn't discovered tobacco,
football fans never would have discovered Philip Morris — which, as
every fan knows, is the perfect companion to football. As Sigafoos,
the eminent historian, says, "Land's sakes, I can't even imagine
football without Philip Morris. I'd sooner go to a game without my
raccoon coat than without my neat, rich tobacco-brown snap-open
pack of mild vintage Fhilip Morris Cigarettes which come in regular
or king-size at prices young and old can afford. Land's sakes!"
The end of football in Europe came with the notorious "Black Cox
Scandal" of 1587, in which Ed Machiavelli, one of the Pisa mob,
paid off the University of Heidelberg Sabres to throw the champion
ship game to the Chartres A. and M. Gophers. It was a mortal blow
to football on the continent.
But the game took hold in the American colonies and thrived as it
had never thrived before. Which brings us to another date that
remains evergreen in the hearts of football lovers: December 16,1771.
On that date a British packet loaded with tea sailed into Boston
harbor. The colonies had long been smarting under the English king's
