in the National Students Associa
tion.
Al Loomi:j, NSA co-ordinator,
gave a report summarizing the opin
ions of the seven Stanford students
who attended the NSA summer con
gress in Ames, lowa.
In his opinion, the main idea ex
pressed by most of the students who
, had attended various commissions
and subcommissions was that Stan
ford "learned little but contributed
a lot,"
He added that, although many of
the workshops resulted in valuable
exchange of ideas and information,
organization was definitely needed
in the congress. "Meetings often
started late," he continued, "and
there seemed to be a lack of interest
in many parts of the agenda."
Loomis added that the reports of
the students attending the conven
tion would be filed in the ASSU
office, and any student who wanted
to read them was welcome to do so,
ASSU President Pete P.ing sug
gested that, Excom tackle one phase
of the NSA at a time at succeeding
Excom meetings, and that members
keep in mind two questions before
voting on retaining or dropping
membership:
1. What has NSA done in the year
that Stanford has been a member?
2. What are NSA's potentialities?
In other action, Excom approved
an appropriation of $100 to the Car
dinals Hospitality Committee, head
ed by Barbara Klass. The commit
tee plans to havo open houses for
i visiting teams and the Stanford team
after each of the games. The Navy
open house will be held at one of the
Women's Row houses.

tion by Bob Gable, student manager,
