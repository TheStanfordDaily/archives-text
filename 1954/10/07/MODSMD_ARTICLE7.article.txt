### 
PARIS, Oct. (i (UP) — Premier
Pierre Mendes-France won author
ization today to stake his govern
ment's life in debate on the nine
power plan for German rearmament
and promised swift action on rati
fication of the London accord.
The French cabinet authorized
Mendes-France to pose an "eventual
confidence vote" on the Issue com
ing up for debate tomorrow in the
National Assembly.
Armed with the confidence vote
threat, the premier quickly took his
fight for ratification to the Assembly
foreign affairs committee-—the body
instrumental in killing off the ear
lier European army plan.
He warned the committee in a
blunt statement that Germany will
be rearmed with or without French
approval and said the new defense
agreement would probably be sub
mitted for parliamentary ratifica
tion within a month.
Mendes-France told the commit
tee the Western Allies had decided
definitely to rearm West Germany
and were now waiting to see wheth
er France would fall in line.
Mendes - France said would
meet Oct. 20 with German Chan
cellor Konrad Adenauer to consider
the status of the Saar dispute.
