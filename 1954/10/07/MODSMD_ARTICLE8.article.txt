# Old-Fashioned Cars, Football Movies Will Enliven 'Back-to-the-Farm Week'
## Sterling Opens 'Farm Follies' 
### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
Back to the Farm week was
off to a good start last night in
the footlights of the "Farm Fol
lies." Leading off the eight-act
bill at Frost Amphitheater, Pres
ident Wallace Sterling keynoted
the traditions embodied in Back
to the Farm week in a short talk.
fie spoke of the spirit of this week
as an attempt to recall the ideas and
visions of the original Stanford stu
dents and of the founders. The "pat
tern and tempo" of the life of those
days, he said, is being lost in the
advancement and the hurry-up at
titude of today, and Back to the
Farm week is an attempt, to bring
back the closeness and the unity
which the first students and faculty
felt here at Stanford 63 years ago.
Following Dr. Sterling's talk, Syl
via Haining came on. Miss Ilaining
managed a very ct-editable rendi
tion, of three top tunes, in a belt
'em-out style which filled Frost Am
phitheater to the brim with noise.
After Mi:-:s Haining, Professor
Robert M Loper raised chuckles
from the audience with a humorous
reading from S. J. Pcrelman.
Other student talent, included
Suzy Klein and Ron Englehardt do
ing an interpretative dance num
ber, and transfer student Paul Burk
hardt with two vocal renditions.
Professor David E. Faville gave
the audiencc a Wagnerian rendition
of a number from the 1921 Gaieties,
"Jams from the Opera." He fol
lowed through with a ballad, "Anne
Boleyn."
Top performers of the evening
were Mr. and Mrs. Bill White. Mrs.
White preceded her husband with
three numbers on the trumpet, in
cluding "St. Louis Blues," and "Ten
derly," played with an artistry that
brought bursts of applause from the
audience. Her husband showed very
definitely that he is still the show
man who got top billing in the 19205,
doing old favorites, "Don't Take
Your Love from Me" and "Me and
My Shadow," in a voice-tap routine.


A FORD IN THEIR FUTURE?—Dean Richard L. Balch, Mrs. Balch and Mrs. Ellene Sumner re

Back to the Farm week was
off to a good start last night in
the footlights of the "Farm Fol
lies." Leading off the eight-act
bill at Frost Amphitheater, Pres
ident Wallace Sterling keynoted
the traditions embodied in Back
to the Farm week in a short talk.
fie spoke of the spirit of this week
as an attempt to recall the ideas and
visions of the original Stanford stu
dents and of the founders. The "pat
tern and tempo" of the life of those
days, he said, is being lost in the
advancement and the hurry-up at
titude of today, and Back to the
Farm week is an attempt, to bring
back the closeness and the unity
which the first students and faculty
felt here at Stanford 63 years ago.
Following Dr. Sterling's talk, Syl
via Haining came on. Miss Ilaining
managed a very ct-editable rendi
tion, of three top tunes, in a belt
'em-out style which filled Frost Am
phitheater to the brim with noise.
After Mi:-:s Haining, Professor
Robert M Loper raised chuckles
from the audience with a humorous
reading from S. J. Pcrelman.
Other student talent, included
Suzy Klein and Ron Englehardt do
ing an interpretative dance num
ber, and transfer student Paul Burk
hardt with two vocal renditions.
Professor David E. Faville gave
the audiencc a Wagnerian rendition
of a number from the 1921 Gaieties,
"Jams from the Opera." He fol
lowed through with a ballad, "Anne
Boleyn."
Top performers of the evening
were Mr. and Mrs. Bill White. Mrs.
White preceded her husband with
three numbers on the trumpet, in
cluding "St. Louis Blues," and "Ten
derly," played with an artistry that
brought bursts of applause from the
audience. Her husband showed very
definitely that he is still the show
man who got top billing in the 19205,
doing old favorites, "Don't Take
Your Love from Me" and "Me and
My Shadow," in a voice-tap routine.
