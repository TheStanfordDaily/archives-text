What! Roos gives 6
months to pay I
you mean we don ! t have to
look like this ?
Cur "bookkeeper will flip when he hears about this, but
now Roos gives you 6 months to pay, and even lets you
set your own charge 'limit! The best part, is that you don ! t
need a PhuD, in math to understand how the plan works®
Here's the pitch*
You figure out how much you can spend for clothes each
month after essentials like food and dates - say $10«
You multiply by 6 to get your charge limit -
in this case $60®
There's no down payment® You just buy what you want, then ,
make your first payment after 30 days* When you ! ve paid off
part of what you owe, you can charge something new - up to
the limit you havo set® There's al% carrying charge on
your balance, just to pacify our bookkeeper®
I ~ 7^Y3\
Of course Roos still has the Regular ( \
Charge Account payable each month, or \
the 30-60-90 Account which lets you \) y\
pay one-third every 30 days® No down \ /^v
payment or interest on these* /^

ROOS puts it on the cuff® /K' .* /
