# 21 Seniors Bear Olympic Torch
## 
### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
Back to the Farm week will go into high gear today with the
opening of Olympic Day, traditional big event in the Back to the
Farm frolics.
A flaming torch will start from in front of the Cellar at 3 p.m.,
held high in the hand of one of 21 valiant seniors clad in the

fashion of ancicnt Rome.
The 21 runners will be stationed
along the long route to Rudy's Alpine
Inn at quarter-mile intervals to take
up the torch and bear it forward.
Following the runners will be a
truck with the Dixieland band play
ing jazz selections.
This year, said Olympic Day offi
cials, vehicles will not be allowed in
the race. In past years wagons,
bikes, and other aids to rapid loco
motion were used to help the run
ners toward the victory prize.
Running in the race, clad only in
togas, laurel wreaths, and dignity,
will be Kar! Schwartz, president of
Stern Hall; John Tirrell, manager of
Concert Series; Walt Williams, Daily
managing editor; Harmon Brown,
Rally Com president; Fred Aurel,
head sponsor of Encina; Bob Gable,
student manager; Fred Stern, spon
sor; Tom Timberlake, Chappie edi
tor; Len Stroud, president of Phi
Phi; Bill Clemans, senior class pres
ident; Guy Shoup, sponsor; Kress
Cole, pre-reg head chairman; Marty
Armbrust, president of Interclub
Council; Ron Tomsic, basketball;
Marty Spangler, Cardinals; Russ
Lawler, basketball; Art Staiiffer,
Cardinals; Gene Pepper, ex-junior
class president; Marco Vitulli, ex

sophomore class president; Peter
Bing, ASSU president; Bill Crow,
Olympic Day chairman.
Unlike last year's torch, the flam
ing wand they will carry is desig
nated as a "common, ordinary torch"
of oil rags on the end of a stick.
Last year's instrument was a lamp
set in a tin can fastened to the end
of a stick.
Spectators who go Saturday to
watch the Big Red Machine roll will
be offered an added attraction at
half-time, when former Stanford
cheerleaders will go on the field to
lead the rooting section.
In yesterday's attraction, the Old
Car Parade, the Kappa Alpha entry,
a "Ruggles," swept the field. Win
ning the prize for the most humor
ous entry was the Alpha Delts'
"driverless" model A, and the best
old car was judged to be a 19U0
Packard entered by the Phi Kap
house. The featured entry, a 1915
model Pierce-Arrow, was unable to
enter because of starting difficulties.
Another entry, a 1926 Dodge, had a
flat tire in the assembly area and
was unable to compete.
The judging, done by Mr. and Mrs.
Richard Batch and Mrs. Ellene Sum
ner, was done from in front of the
Post Office.
Contrary to rumors circulated
around campus yesterday, today is
not an election day, and Rudy's will
be open for business this afternoon.
