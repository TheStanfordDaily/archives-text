# The 						Daily Photos 2 Goats In Wild Kid-naping Caper
## The 						Case of the Missing Mascot 
### 
"We've just stolen the Navy's
goat!"
Two wild automobile rides,
leading to two different goats,
and a great deal of amateur su
persleuthing by members of the
Daily staff followed this anony
mous announcement, phoned to
The Daily early yesterday, that
the Naval Academy football
team's mascot goat, "Captain
Nemo," had been kid-napped.
"Captain Nemo" is the West Coast
version of Navy's goat; he reposed,
until 2 a.m. yesterday, in a barn
behind Sunnyvale's Fremont High
School. At that time, persons un
known lured Nemo out of his barn
and into a car, and took him lo an
unknown hideaway.
On first contact, the Naval f?OTC
I department at Stanford, official cus
! todians of the goat, denied Nemo
had been stolen. They took Daily
photographers and reporters to a
point near La Honda, and after a
wait of two and one-half hours, pro
duced a goat.
It was the wrong goat.
Nemo's owner, one Bill Slattcry,
said that ain't my goat, and the
Daily photogs fired away. This was
a clean-shaven goat, handsome but
not Nemo. Nemo is a "valuable An
gora goat," sources say. Sources add
lie's worth $350 and woe to his ab
ductors.
Back at The Daily, the abductors
themselves called again. Would The
Daily like to see the real goat? Send
a photographer! A Daily photog was
waiting at the Post Office within the
hour.
Shades of Alfred Hitchcock! Blind
folded, the photographer was driven
away. He thinks they drove south
It) "somewhere near L'Ommic's." He
saw the "real goat," so woolly it
looked like a sheep. He took more
pictures. He was dropped by the
conspirators at an El Camino dtive
in. lie didn't know any of the men,
all Stanford students.
Meanwhile, The Daily continued
hot. on the trail. Liccnse numbers of
the two cars which carried the pho
tographer away were noted and dis-
I patched to Sacramento; registration
J and ownership of the cars had been
noted. The Daily had its ear to the
ground.
Naval ROTC facility Lieutenant. C.
Turner Joy was contacted; he knew
a few things about the intrigue. He

also, knew a few things about the
goat:
Nemo, besides being an Aneora ol
some worth, i:. accustomed to a diet
of barley snd a warm, sheltered bod.
Without these luxuries. .Toy avers,
the goat will turn poorly. Awl that,
he points out, would be most dis
tressing to both the Navy Depart
ment and the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals, and
most unfortunate for the kid-nap-
I pers.
The Daily, after a great deal of
j work, has very few printable facts.
One of these implicates members of
the Alpha Kappa Lambda house on
campus. Another indicates that at
least one of the conspirators is pres
ently "on the carpet" with the Uni
versity administration for his part
in other capers.

Another anonymous phone call,
late in the evening, gave The Daily
the information that stunts of this
type are not new to the five (ad
mittedly the number of conspira
tors). "They've done this sort of
thing before," a somewhat amused
informant said.
"Captain Nemo" is scheduled to
go on the field at the stadium to
morrow about. 2 p.m. Where, oh,
where is Nemo?

Another anonymous phone call,
late in the evening, gave The Daily
the information that stunts of this
type are not new to the five (ad

thing before," a somewhat amused
informant said.
"Captain Nemo" is scheduled to

where is Nemo?

"We've just stolen the Navy's
goat!"
Two wild automobile rides,
leading to two different goats,
and a great deal of amateur su
persleuthing by members of the
Daily staff followed this anony
mous announcement, phoned to
The Daily early yesterday, that
the Naval Academy football
team's mascot goat, "Captain
Nemo," had been kid-napped.
"Captain Nemo" is the West Coast
version of Navy's goat; he reposed,
until 2 a.m. yesterday, in a barn
behind Sunnyvale's Fremont High
School. At that time, persons un
known lured Nemo out of his barn
and into a car, and took him lo an
unknown hideaway.
On first contact, the Naval f?OTC
I department at Stanford, official cus
! todians of the goat, denied Nemo
had been stolen. They took Daily
photographers and reporters to a
point near La Honda, and after a
wait of two and one-half hours, pro
duced a goat.
It was the wrong goat.
Nemo's owner, one Bill Slattcry,
said that ain't my goat, and the
Daily photogs fired away. This was
a clean-shaven goat, handsome but
not Nemo. Nemo is a "valuable An
gora goat," sources say. Sources add
lie's worth $350 and woe to his ab
ductors.
Back at The Daily, the abductors
themselves called again. Would The
Daily like to see the real goat? Send
a photographer! A Daily photog was
waiting at the Post Office within the
hour.
Shades of Alfred Hitchcock! Blind
folded, the photographer was driven
away. He thinks they drove south
It) "somewhere near L'Ommic's." He
saw the "real goat," so woolly it
looked like a sheep. He took more
pictures. He was dropped by the
conspirators at an El Camino dtive
in. lie didn't know any of the men,
all Stanford students.
Meanwhile, The Daily continued
hot. on the trail. Liccnse numbers of
the two cars which carried the pho
tographer away were noted and dis-
I patched to Sacramento; registration
J and ownership of the cars had been
noted. The Daily had its ear to the
ground.
Naval ROTC facility Lieutenant. C.
Turner Joy was contacted; he knew
a few things about the intrigue. He

also, knew a few things about the
goat:
Nemo, besides being an Aneora ol
some worth, i:. accustomed to a diet
of barley snd a warm, sheltered bod.
