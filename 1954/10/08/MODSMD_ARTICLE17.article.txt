## 'Slap Down' the Demonstrators 
### 
To the Editor:
Today's editorial "Back to Africa" was the finest bit
of journalism seen in The Daily for quite a while.
Such copy should be sent to the capital in order to
"slap down" the students in their most childish and
valueless demonstrations.
For it is these non-thinking people who advocate
a change for a specific groupâ€”a change that they
themselves would not wish to take.

The ravings of Communists who praise the USSR
ar.d degrade the United States are good examples and
very similar to the anti-Negro demonstrators. For as
.soon as the tables are turned and some group sug
gests sending the reds and pinks to Russia, they
become immediately silent.
Good work, Daily; keep those hard-hitting, timely
editorials coming.
