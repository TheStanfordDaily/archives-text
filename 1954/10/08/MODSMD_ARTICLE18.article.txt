To Ihe Editor:
The Rally Committee wishes to thank the fresh
man class for your enthusiasm during our tryouts
held last week. Our choice was a very difficult one,
since our selection was limited in number.

We greatly appreciate the interest that you have
â€¢ hown and trust that it is indicative of the overall
spirit of the Class of '58.
