WHISTLES AND BELLS — The
University of Kansas has given its
whistle a new look—er, new tone.
The new whistle, higher pitched and
less full-bodied than the old one,
was thought to bo the old whistle
simply getting temperamental in its
old age. After 32 years of service, it
was laid to rest. KU students tem
porarily will have to do without the
quarter - hour chimes from their
campanile. The bells have been dis
connected while painters remove
dust and rust and repaint worn spots
on the bell frame supports.
