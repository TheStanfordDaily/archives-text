## 'Arms or Unity For Germany' 
### 
BERLIN, Oct .7 (UP)—Soviet For
eign Minister V. M. Molotov, in an
other effort to wreck the decisions
of the London conference, told West
Germans today they must choose
between reunification of Germany
and rearmament.
Molotov told a mass meeting in
East Berlin's Marx-Engels Platz, the
former Lustgarten, that West Ger
man remilitarization is the "main
hindrance" in the path of German
reunification and blamed it on
American and European "aggressive
forces."
Molotov spoke against a back
ground of these major developments
in the European diplomatic scene:
At Blackpool, England, Foreign
Secretary Anthony Eden warned the
parliaments of West Europe today
the United States will seek its sal
vation elsewhere if they do not rat
ify the London pact on rearming
free Germany.
"And who can blame them?" he
asked.
Eden's warning, delivered at the
anuual convention of the Conserva
tive party, obviously was aimed pri
marily at the French National As
sembly, which rejected the EDC
plan and now holds the fate of the
historic London agreement.
In Paris, Premier Pierre Mendes-
France began his fight for ratifica
tion of the London pact when he
appeared before the National As
sembly and said its adoption would
not increase the chances of war with
Russia.
