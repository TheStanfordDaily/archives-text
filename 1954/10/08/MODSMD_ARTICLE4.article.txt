# Engineering Grad Dorm Work to Start
## 
### RUSS WILKS Associate Editor, The Daily 
Judge George E. Crothcrs, '95,
broke ground yesterday morning at
11:50 to signal the start of construc
tion on a $680,000 dormitory to house
156 graduate students in engineer
ing.
The building, to be known as
Crothers Memorial Hall, will be
erected on the same lot that contains
the Crothers law dormitory in the
section enclosed by Argueilo, Escon
dido, and Galvez streets.
The project is the third in Univer
sity student housing plans within the
last two months. Work began in Au
gust on a new freshman dorm and
construction will begin shortly on
the Stern Hall extension.
The engineering building was
made possible through gifts made
by Judge Crothers.
Among the many engineering and
administrative officials participating
in the informal ceremonies were
President Wallace Sterling, Dean F.
E. Terman of the School of Engi
neering; and David Packard of Palo
Alto, Stanford trustee and an engi
neering alumnus. '
Architectural plans were prepared
by Spencer & Ambrose of San Fran
cisco and Wagner & Martinez, who
will also work on the Stanford shop
ping center. Landscaping, furnish
ings, and other activation expenses
are included in the cost figure.
Present plans call for the comple
tion of the dorm in time for occu
pancy autumn quarter 1955. Croth
crs law residence, which houses 143
students, is U - shaped and the
engineering structure will be L
shaped. Future plans will link the
two dorms with the addition of a
wing which will form a quadrangle
encompassing a courtyard.
Crothers Memorial Hall students
will be housed in 24 single and 66
double rooms and lounge facilities
will be provided on the main floor.
Floor space totals 39,000 square feet.
The engineering unit will resem
ble the law building in that it will
have concrete exterior walls of con
trasting buff and grey color and a
red tile roof.
Judge Crothers graduated in the
pioneer class of '95 at Stanford and
obtained a Master's degree in law
in 1896. In 1902 he became the first
alumnus to be clectcd to the Stan
ford Board of Trustees, serving a 10-
year term.
