# Cards Seek 4th Straight Against Navy
## Both Squads Are Unbeaten 
### BOB DURAND 
The fleet's in! Coach Eddie
Erdelatz and a crew of 37 Navy
Middies have come and are
ready to do battle in Stanford
Stadium tomorrow at 2 p.m.
One might call it a battle of the
undefeateds. The visitors have
racked up two wins in two outings—
27-0 over William and Mary and
42-7 over Dartmouth. However, as
Erdelatz said earlier in the week,
"Now that we've played our minor
league competition, let's see how we
do against the majors."
The Indians, meanwhile, had to
work mighty hard to eke out a 13-12
squeaker over COP, then spun the
wheel of fortune to win from the
hapless Oregon Ducks, 18-13, and
last, week looked like a top - rate
team in outplaying highly touted Il
linois to the tune of 12-2.
The professional odds rank the
game as even money. John T. Cox,
Navy's information director, says
that the Cards have the edge be-

cause "our offense is only spasmodic,
and our defense is below par."
Tribe mentor Chuck Taylor said,
"It will be our toughest game, but—
Stanford to win in a low-scoring
contest."
A crowd of around 45,000 grid fans
is expected to file through the gates
tomorrow to watch the Cards try to
make it four in a row. A majority
of the people don't know what to
look for in the visiting team.
The midshipmen won their first
two games, according to the experts,
on the basis of a strong all-letterman
backfield. George Welsh, a 157-pound
quarterback who completed 39 out
of 92 passes last year, has been lead
ing the attack and will without
doubt start tomorrow.
At the halfback slots are Jack
Garrow and Bob Craig. The former
was the most consistent ball carrier
on the squad last year, while the
latter, who is a sprinter on the
track team, averaged over four yards
a carry in a second-string role.
The fullback position is one that
coach Erdelatz is not too worried
about. Expected to see only limited
action because of leg injuries is cap
tain Phil Monahan. He paced the
team in both kickoff returns and
touchdowns while playing halfback
last season.
Probable starter at the spot will
be Joe Gattuso, who was the lead
ing rusher and punter for the squad
last season.
As for the forward wall, Erdelatz
said at the beginning of the season,
"We face a terrific rebuilding job
