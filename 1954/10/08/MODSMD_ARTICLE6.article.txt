# Cards Seek 4th Straight Against Navy
## Both Squads Are Unbeaten 
### BOB DURAND 
The fleet's in! Coach Eddie
Erdelatz and a crew of 37 Navy
Middies have come and are
ready to do battle in Stanford
Stadium tomorrow at 2 p.m.
One might call it a battle of the
undefeateds. The visitors have
racked up two wins in two outings—
27-0 over William and Mary and
42-7 over Dartmouth. However, as
Erdelatz said earlier in the week,
"Now that we've played our minor
league competition, let's see how we
do against the majors."
The Indians, meanwhile, had to
work mighty hard to eke out a 13-12
squeaker over COP, then spun the
wheel of fortune to win from the
hapless Oregon Ducks, 18-13, and
last, week looked like a top - rate
team in outplaying highly touted Il
linois to the tune of 12-2.
The professional odds rank the
game as even money. John T. Cox,
Navy's information director, says
that the Cards have the edge be-

cause "our offense is only spasmodic,
and our defense is below par."
Tribe mentor Chuck Taylor said,
"It will be our toughest game, but—
Stanford to win in a low-scoring
contest."
A crowd of around 45,000 grid fans
is expected to file through the gates
tomorrow to watch the Cards try to
make it four in a row. A majority
of the people don't know what to
look for in the visiting team.
The midshipmen won their first
two games, according to the experts,
on the basis of a strong all-letterman
backfield. George Welsh, a 157-pound
quarterback who completed 39 out
of 92 passes last year, has been lead
ing the attack and will without
doubt start tomorrow.
At the halfback slots are Jack
Garrow and Bob Craig. The former
was the most consistent ball carrier
on the squad last year, while the
latter, who is a sprinter on the
track team, averaged over four yards
a carry in a second-string role.
The fullback position is one that
coach Erdelatz is not too worried
about. Expected to see only limited
action because of leg injuries is cap
tain Phil Monahan. He paced the
team in both kickoff returns and
touchdowns while playing halfback
last season.
Probable starter at the spot will
be Joe Gattuso, who was the lead
ing rusher and punter for the squad
last season.
As for the forward wall, Erdelatz
said at the beginning of the season,
"We face a terrific rebuilding job

up front." As to the verity of this
statement, the first two games have
been no indication.
Two regulars return to anchor the
Middie line. Ron Beagle at left end
will be a man to keep an eye on
tomorrow. The 185-pound junior
caught three touchdown passes
against Dartmouth last week and
now rates among the tops in the
country in that department.
The other, Hugh Webster, played
tackle in 1953 but is being switched
to guard for this season's campaign.
At right end for the Blue and Gold
will be a big 205 - pounder, Jim
Owen. In the tackle slots are two
200 - pounders, John Hopkins and
Jim Royer, while at the other guard
post will be Alex Aronis from Holly
wood. In the middle of the line will
be Bob Davis, up from last year's JV
squad.
Those are the midshipmen who
will be on the field come 2 p.m. to
morow. As far as passing judgment
on them, that is a job which should
wait until three hours later. One
thing that is sure—Navy doesn't like
to lose football games, and tomor
row will be no exception.
The Indians meanwhile tapered
off on drills yesterday and concen
trated on running signal and dummy
drills. Taylor looked more pleased
than he had all week, but still was
not completely satisfied.
Taylor at present is planning on
starting the same eleven which
opened against Illinois. At quarter

back will be John Brodie, although
Jerry Gustafson is expected to play
as much if not more than the 185-
pound sophomore.
Ernie Dorn and Gordy Young will
pace each other at halfbacks, while
line-blaster Bill Tarr will carry the
load at fullback.
Anchoring the center of the line
will be the Associated Press Line
man of the Week, Jerry Goldberg.
Flanking him at the guard posts
will be Tony Mosich and Roy
Krickeberg, artd at tackles, Cris
Marshall and Paul Wiggin.
Steve Docter and Jim McCamant
will open at the e*nd positions, while
John Stewart will be ready if need
ed. Injury-wise, the Cards should
be in top shape.
Two questions that have been
bothering sportswritars all week
should be answered tomorrow. One,
is Stanford as good as it showed in
the Illinois game? Two, how good
is Navy? It should be an interesting
afternoon.

line-blaster Bill Tarr will carry the
load at fullback.
Anchoring the center of the line
will be the Associated Press Line
man of the Week, Jerry Goldberg.
Flanking him at the guard posts
will be Tony Mosich and Roy
Krickeberg, artd at tackles, Cris
Marshall and Paul Wiggin.
Steve Docter and Jim McCamant

CAPTAIN PHIL MONAHAN
—Leg injury hampers Navy fullback
The fleet's in! Coach Eddie
Erdelatz and a crew of 37 Navy
Middies have come and are
ready to do battle in Stanford
Stadium tomorrow at 2 p.m.
One might call it a battle of the
undefeateds. The visitors have
racked up two wins in two outings—
27-0 over William and Mary and
42-7 over Dartmouth. However, as
Erdelatz said earlier in the week,
"Now that we've played our minor
league competition, let's see how we
do against the majors."
The Indians, meanwhile, had to
work mighty hard to eke out a 13-12
squeaker over COP, then spun the
wheel of fortune to win from the
hapless Oregon Ducks, 18-13, and
last, week looked like a top - rate
team in outplaying highly touted Il
linois to the tune of 12-2.
The professional odds rank the
game as even money. John T. Cox,
Navy's information director, says
that the Cards have the edge be-

cause "our offense is only spasmodic,
and our defense is below par."
Tribe mentor Chuck Taylor said,
"It will be our toughest game, but—
Stanford to win in a low-scoring
contest."
A crowd of around 45,000 grid fans
is expected to file through the gates
tomorrow to watch the Cards try to
make it four in a row. A majority
of the people don't know what to
look for in the visiting team.
The midshipmen won their first
two games, according to the experts,
on the basis of a strong all-letterman
backfield. George Welsh, a 157-pound
quarterback who completed 39 out
of 92 passes last year, has been lead
ing the attack and will without
doubt start tomorrow.
At the halfback slots are Jack
Garrow and Bob Craig. The former
was the most consistent ball carrier
on the squad last year, while the
latter, who is a sprinter on the
track team, averaged over four yards
a carry in a second-string role.
The fullback position is one that
coach Erdelatz is not too worried
about. Expected to see only limited
action because of leg injuries is cap
tain Phil Monahan. He paced the
team in both kickoff returns and
touchdowns while playing halfback
last season.
Probable starter at the spot will
be Joe Gattuso, who was the lead
ing rusher and punter for the squad
last season.
As for the forward wall, Erdelatz
said at the beginning of the season,
"We face a terrific rebuilding job

up front." As to the verity of this
statement, the first two games have
been no indication.
Two regulars return to anchor the
Middie line. Ron Beagle at left end
will be a man to keep an eye on
tomorrow. The 185-pound junior
caught three touchdown passes
against Dartmouth last week and
now rates among the tops in the
country in that department.
The other, Hugh Webster, played
tackle in 1953 but is being switched
to guard for this season's campaign.
At right end for the Blue and Gold
will be a big 205 - pounder, Jim
Owen. In the tackle slots are two
200 - pounders, John Hopkins and
Jim Royer, while at the other guard
post will be Alex Aronis from Holly
wood. In the middle of the line will
be Bob Davis, up from last year's JV
squad.
Those are the midshipmen who
will be on the field come 2 p.m. to
morow. As far as passing judgment
on them, that is a job which should
wait until three hours later. One
thing that is sure—Navy doesn't like
to lose football games, and tomor
row will be no exception.
The Indians meanwhile tapered
off on drills yesterday and concen
trated on running signal and dummy
drills. Taylor looked more pleased
than he had all week, but still was
not completely satisfied.
Taylor at present is planning on
starting the same eleven which
opened against Illinois. At quarter

back will be John Brodie, although
Jerry Gustafson is expected to play
as much if not more than the 185-
pound sophomore.
Ernie Dorn and Gordy Young will
pace each other at halfbacks, while
line-blaster Bill Tarr will carry the
load at fullback.

Those are the midshipmen who
will be on the field come 2 p.m. to
morow. As far as passing judgment
on them, that is a job which should
wait until three hours later. One
thing that is sure—Navy doesn't like
to lose football games, and tomor
row will be no exception.
The Indians meanwhile tapered
off on drills yesterday and concen
trated on running signal and dummy
drills. Taylor looked more pleased
than he had all week, but still was
not completely satisfied.
Taylor at present is planning on
starting the same eleven which
opened against Illinois. At quarter

back will be John Brodie, although
Jerry Gustafson is expected to play
as much if not more than the 185-
pound sophomore.
Ernie Dorn and Gordy Young will
pace each other at halfbacks, while
line-blaster Bill Tarr will carry the
load at fullback.
Anchoring the center of the line
will be the Associated Press Line
man of the Week, Jerry Goldberg.
Flanking him at the guard posts
will be Tony Mosich and Roy
Krickeberg, artd at tackles, Cris
Marshall and Paul Wiggin.
Steve Docter and Jim McCamant
will open at the e*nd positions, while
John Stewart will be ready if need
ed. Injury-wise, the Cards should
be in top shape.
Two questions that have been
bothering sportswritars all week
should be answered tomorrow. One,
is Stanford as good as it showed in
the Illinois game? Two, how good
is Navy? It should be an interesting
afternoon.

CAPTAIN PHIL MONAHAN
—Leg injury hampers Navy fullback
The fleet's in! Coach Eddie
Erdelatz and a crew of 37 Navy
Middies have come and are
ready to do battle in Stanford
Stadium tomorrow at 2 p.m.
One might call it a battle of the
undefeateds. The visitors have
racked up two wins in two outings—
27-0 over William and Mary and
42-7 over Dartmouth. However, as
Erdelatz said earlier in the week,
"Now that we've played our minor
league competition, let's see how we
do against the majors."
The Indians, meanwhile, had to
work mighty hard to eke out a 13-12
squeaker over COP, then spun the
wheel of fortune to win from the
hapless Oregon Ducks, 18-13, and
last, week looked like a top - rate
team in outplaying highly touted Il
linois to the tune of 12-2.
The professional odds rank the
game as even money. John T. Cox,
Navy's information director, says
that the Cards have the edge be-

Shaw and commentator Ernie

cause "our offense is only spasmodic,
and our defense is below par."
Tribe mentor Chuck Taylor said,
"It will be our toughest game, but—
Stanford to win in a low-scoring
contest."
A crowd of around 45,000 grid fans
is expected to file through the gates
tomorrow to watch the Cards try to
make it four in a row. A majority
of the people don't know what to
look for in the visiting team.
The midshipmen won their first
two games, according to the experts,
on the basis of a strong all-letterman
backfield. George Welsh, a 157-pound
quarterback who completed 39 out
of 92 passes last year, has been lead
ing the attack and will without
doubt start tomorrow.
At the halfback slots are Jack
Garrow and Bob Craig. The former
was the most consistent ball carrier
on the squad last year, while the
latter, who is a sprinter on the
track team, averaged over four yards
a carry in a second-string role.
The fullback position is one that
coach Erdelatz is not too worried
about. Expected to see only limited
action because of leg injuries is cap
tain Phil Monahan. He paced the
team in both kickoff returns and
touchdowns while playing halfback
last season.
Probable starter at the spot will
be Joe Gattuso, who was the lead
ing rusher and punter for the squad
last season.
As for the forward wall, Erdelatz
said at the beginning of the season,
"We face a terrific rebuilding job

up front." As to the verity of this
statement, the first two games have
been no indication.
Two regulars return to anchor the
Middie line. Ron Beagle at left end
will be a man to keep an eye on
tomorrow. The 185-pound junior
caught three touchdown passes
against Dartmouth last week and
now rates among the tops in the
country in that department.
The other, Hugh Webster, played
tackle in 1953 but is being switched
to guard for this season's campaign.
At right end for the Blue and Gold
will be a big 205 - pounder, Jim
Owen. In the tackle slots are two
200 - pounders, John Hopkins and
Jim Royer, while at the other guard
post will be Alex Aronis from Holly
wood. In the middle of the line will
be Bob Davis, up from last year's JV
squad.
Those are the midshipmen who
will be on the field come 2 p.m. to
morow. As far as passing judgment
on them, that is a job which should
