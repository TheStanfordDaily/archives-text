# SUPREME COURT
## Delay Foreseen On New Jurist 
### 
DENVER, Oct. 10 (UP)â€”Presi
dent. Eisenhower, it was learned to
night, will go slow on filling the
Supreme Court vacancy while he
examines the qualifications of sev
eral high-ranking judges on the fed
eral district and appellate benches.
The vacancy, caused by the death
yesterday of Associate Justice Rob
ert H. Jackson, will cause long ad
ministration conferences and Mr.
Eisenhower was not expected to dis
cuss filling the vacancy to any ex
tent until after he returns to Wash
ington late this week.
NOT DEWEY OR DULLES
Members of his staff ruled out any
idea that the post was to go to either
Governor Thomas E. Dewey of Now
York or Secretary of State John
Foster Dulles.
Administration leaders regard
Dewey as completely sincere in his
desire to improve his financial posi
tion by leaving government for pri
vate law practice. And the Presi
dent regards Dulles as the keystone
of administration foreign policy and
for the present at least, irreplace
able.
MEDINA MENTIONED
The name of Judge Harold Me
dina of the U.C. Circuit Court of
Appeals in New York cropped up in
speculation here tonight.
Medina won national acclaim as a
U.S. district judge ftir his patience
and forbearance when he presided al
the trial of the 11 Communist lead
ers in New York,
As a natural course of events,
there also is unofficial mention ht>re
of Attorney Central Herbert Brown
ell, Jr., for the vacancy, but Brown
ell would seem to have several dis
advantages working against him.
