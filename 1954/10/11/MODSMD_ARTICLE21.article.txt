# SAE's Dampen Màdroño Rivals
## 
### 
Traditional rivalry between the
SAE's and Madrono broke out again
yesterday with the "mysterious"
disappearance of paddles and pool
balls and the equally "mysterious"
dissappearance of a front door.
Who began it all, no one knows;
but, in the middle of last night's
dinnsr at Union, about six girls left
their meals to run to the aid of
their bouse. It was getting a slight
soaking.
Upon their arrival, they found a
few changes. Half of the front door
was gone; a few pieces of furniture
had been shuffled around, providing
a nice space for dancing, and the
front and side of the house were a
little wet.
Before the girls had time to con
template the event, the door re
turned from its journey and all
missing objects reappeared.
No damage was done, and the
after - effects are a slightly fire
: proofed Madrono and an interesting
topic for the breakfast table.
