## Cards Confident About UCLA Despite 25-0 Sinking by Navy Navy Called 'Inspired' Team 
### BOB DURAND 
"I knew it was too good to be
rue." "That wasn't the same
earn that played Illinois."
Those sailor boys really want
jd to play football." So went the
comments late Saturday afier
noon in the vicinity of Stanford
stadium.
The reason was that a rugged
Navy eleven had just succeeded in
waking Stanford out of a good
-ream to the tune of 25-0.
Despite the low feeling among In
dian rooters, however, coach Chuck
Taylor and his tribe were not taking
it so hard. Although they admitted
they had played way below par, they
ail seemed to be of the general opin
ion that "If it had to happen, I'm
glad it happened now."
The trend in the Cards' dressing
room seemed to be to write this
game off and do nothing but con-

centrate on next week's tilt with
UCLA in Los Angeles. Everyone in
cluding Taylor felt that it would be
possible to take the Bruins.
Going into Saturday's contest, the
sportswriters were asking two ques
tions. Is Stanford really as good as
it looked last week? How good is
Navy?

however, commented thus:

"Navy was the best team out there
today. They were inspired —we
weren't, and therefore they took us
apart.
"I can't believe we're as bad as
we looked. I think we should have
a good chance to win the rest of
our games."
As to the latter question, not many


TERRIFIC TARR—BiII Tarr, Stanford's bruising fullback, picks
up 18 yards against Navy in Saturday's game. Tarr, with 63
yards in nine carries v/as by far the best ball crrier for the In-

dians all afternoon, as the Cards gained only 132 net yards rush
ing against a rugged Middie forward wall.
