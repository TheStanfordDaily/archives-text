# Tars Fail To Halt Bill Tarr
## Cards Confident About UCLA Despite 25-0 Sinking by Navy Navy Called 'Inspired' Team 
### BOB DURAND 
"I knew it was too good to be
rue." "That wasn't the same
earn that played Illinois."
Those sailor boys really want
jd to play football." So went the
comments late Saturday afier
noon in the vicinity of Stanford
stadium.
The reason was that a rugged
Navy eleven had just succeeded in
waking Stanford out of a good
-ream to the tune of 25-0.
Despite the low feeling among In
dian rooters, however, coach Chuck
Taylor and his tribe were not taking
it so hard. Although they admitted
they had played way below par, they
ail seemed to be of the general opin
ion that "If it had to happen, I'm
glad it happened now."
The trend in the Cards' dressing
room seemed to be to write this
game off and do nothing but con-

centrate on next week's tilt with
UCLA in Los Angeles. Everyone in
cluding Taylor felt that it would be
possible to take the Bruins.
Going into Saturday's contest, the
sportswriters were asking two ques
tions. Is Stanford really as good as
it looked last week? How good is
Navy?
Most people would like to answer
"no" to the former question. Taylor,
however, commented thus:
INSPIRED'
"Navy was the best team out there
today. They were inspired —we
weren't, and therefore they took us
apart.
"I can't believe we're as bad as
we looked. I think we should have
a good chance to win the rest of
our games."
As to the latter question, not many


TERRIFIC TARR—BiII Tarr, Stanford's bruising fullback, picks
up 18 yards against Navy in Saturday's game. Tarr, with 63
yards in nine carries v/as by far the best ball crrier for the In-

dians all afternoon, as the Cards gained only 132 net yards rush
ing against a rugged Middie forward wall.

football fans should have trouble an
swering it. The Middies were sup
posed to have a good backfield and
a very good passing attaek. Their
line and defense were questionable.
Eleven backs carried the bull 49
times for the visitors. The average
yards - gained - per - carry was j.ust
under six. Leading this department
was a modest first classman (senior)
by the name of Joe Gattuso who
rushed an average of 10.9 yards for
the 14 times he got the pigskin.
Dick Echard, starting his first var
sity game after, two years on the
JV's, put on a fine display ol' passing,
completing nine out of 17 throws,
including two touchdown tosses to
Jim Owen and Dick Guest.
MIDDIE LINE SCRAPPY
The talents of the Middie forward
wall, virtually unknown until Satur
day, were summed up this way by
Taylor: "They just outscrapped us."
The Navy defense speaks for itself
on the scoreboard. Three times,
Stanford drives were stopped deep
in scoring territory, while only Bill
Tarr was able to make any decent
gains. '
Both Middie touchdowns in the
first half came as a result of mis
takes according to Taylor. These
plus the failure to push the ball
across on the drives were the main
factor in defeat.
NAVY CONTROLLED BALL
Navy played the principle of ball
control in the second half and did
"a wonderful job of it," said Taylor.
"We just didn't hold up under it."
Comparing the ptay of last week's
Illinois game with Saturday's, Chuck
said it was all "in the head."
As to next week's contest with
UCLA, the Indian mentor stated,
"We have a heck of a lot of work
to do. They're going to be after us,
especially after last year's game, but
I think we can take them.
"Remember, we beat the Bruins
last year after losing to Illinois the
week before."
