# Agreement on Trieste
## 
### 
It takes so little to start the ball rolling to
ward international war or peace.
The Trieste Agreement, recently signed in
London, may be the long-awaited diplomatic
achievement that will point out to the world the
road to peace.
Trieste is small, but strategically of great im
portance to Italy and Yugoslavia. Given to Italy
after World War I, it was converted into a Free
Territory after World War 11. Part was occu
pied and ruled by Yugoslavia, and the rest, in
ciuding th city of Trieste, was administered by
British and American troops.
The dispute that came very close to provok
ing World War 111 broke out when the United
States and Britain announced in 1953 that they
would withdraw their troops from their sector,
Zone A, rid returned it to Italian jurisdiction.
Zone B was to remain under Yugoslavian con
trol.
This announcement was greeted with riot
ing and bloodshed in Rome and Belgjade.
Each contended, violently, that it had a right to
tiiÂ»- vhole t; rritory, and that they would not
consider Mottling for a mere half.
The sigr.ing of the 1954 Trieste Agreement

by Italian and Yugoslavian diplomats, how
ever, was followed by whole-hearted celebra
tions in Italy and the city of Trieste, enthusi
asm in London and other parts of the world, and
quiet acceptance in Yugoslavia.
Why was this settlement successful when
the 1953 attempt failed so miserably, almost
disastrously? The division of territory and pro
visions are almost identicaWZone A, including
the city of Trieste, goes to Italy. Zone B, plus
port privileges in Trieste, goes to Yugoslavia.
The difference, then, lies not in the terms of
the settlement, but in the diplomatic process.
In 1953 Yugoslavs considered the proposal "a
unilateral decision, an attempt to impose an
order on a free country without its consent."
They view the 1954 plan, however, as "an
agreed solution, voluntarily accepted by both
sides. This we can accept, even though it
means sacrifices."
Trieste should teach the world two lessons:
One, international disputes must be subjected
to mutual understanding and mutual agree
ment before permanent, peaceful settlements
can be made. Two, the evils of nationalism
don't have to be fatal to world peace.
