But what about the goat?
Suppose you are a goat. It is two
days before the Stanford-Navy
game. You ;re giving three to
five against Stanford, You stand

in ;' siaK corrvortably munching barley and produc
ing at' ;i ; a leisurely rate. Suddenly you hear a
noise 'r !v i you. You turn, and there SHE is. She
softly rub. your flank with the points of her horns,
sidli-s up to you, speaking with a bleating sound.
Ten minutes later, we go back to the story:
Between one mouthful of barley and the next
you a" in a car speeding down El Camino. Or is it
up'.' At any rate, you are speeding. What will Chief
Go'.dy Davi.-; -ay? What will Sunnyvale police say?
Thf Sunnyv; le police will say quote, if one of those
smelly & <<<' , &* came in here I'd get it out as
last, as possible. U).quote.

Sunnyvale police don't like goats.
Most people d>n"' lii*e Daily Bull Session.
Nobody, but nobody i likes Gattuso.
Then you arc i miely l/ol 1 out of the car into a
rundown combination arbor-Heidelberg beer
garden in an orchard vom« when up the canyon be
tween San Francisco end Los Banns. Nobody loves
you. Nobody ",•<■. Nobody bring:- anything to eat
except alfalfa. Asking a goaf to eat alfalfa is like
asking you to munch on your mattress for lunch.
Another ear comes to a roaring stop, and out
climbs a guy woarine a blindfold. surrounded by
twenty-seven guys in trench coats with their hats
pulled Avei their eyes at.d hulg" under their left
arm. ' What is it?" you f.hi;• k Then a big white light
goes off in your faeo.
"Ah-hah!" you think, "What could it be but a
screen test," as you remer.ibo' the scene from Rear
Window. %> you star! walking toward the light,
trying to Stagger and look like the guy in the movie,
Thorslcin Veblen or whoever it was.
And what happen:;? You ..»•<• blinded six times by
this flash, Then ill flu li his are turned out and
they leave you again. Slid no barley. Such a nerve.
I ask you. what is a self-i < specting goat supposed
to do. Who can think about, angora at a time like
this?
And so, dear friend.-', you can see why the Navy
football team w; in such a hurry to leave our fair
campus. It's not that we don't want them. It's just
that nobody know which goat is which, and when
your mascot sometimes play- left guard, you want to
be sure he knows the plays.
Furthermore, the goals have gone on strike, for
better working conditions. Consider: kept for three
days, hauled around with not! ing to oat, this poor
creature was even at last forced out of a job .by im
ported labor.
Since the NKG'TC teaching staff is getting a free
dinner out of all thi \ il seems only fair to ask: did
the goat ever get his barley?
