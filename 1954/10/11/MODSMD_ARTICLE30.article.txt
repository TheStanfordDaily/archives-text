# 801,000 CUPS OF COFFEE
## Many Stores, Concessions Comprise Stanford Union 
### DAVE SCOTT 
If you buy a cup of. coffee
this year at Ihe Cellar, the out
door snack bar, or the Encina
store, it will be but one of op
proximately 801,000 cups.. That's
the amount the stores run by the
Stanford Union sold last year.
Stafford Union, Cellar — these
are words often misused by Stan
ford students according to Miss
Ricker, director of the Unioru "Its
like the story of the three blind
men," she said. "When confronted
with an elephant one stuck his hand
out and felt the ears and swore they
were the sails of a boat; then an
other felt its side was sure it was a
wall, and the third felt the tail and
declared it was a snake.
"It's the same tiding with Stan
people. Their interpretation of the
Union is the part with which they
come in contact. To students it is
the particular place they buy a cup
of coffee; to faculty wives it is the
place they phone to send me three
gallons of punch in a hurry."

MANY DEPARTMENTS
The Stanford Union is the organi
zation which encompasses many de
partments, all on a separate financial
basis. There is the cigar-candy coun
ter and the outdoor snack bar, both
supervised by Miss C.unther, and the
public dining room and the women's
residence dining room, both operated
by Miss Bell, assisted by Miss Koors.
.The Cellar, the section in back of
the grill downstairs, is headed by
Miss Hawkins, aided by Mr. Strouse
who keeps it open late at night. Per
forming similar functions at the En
cina basement store is Mr. Black,
betted known as "Blackie." The
Union runs a catering service which
serves "everything from a gallon of
coffee to a full, dinner for the Men's
Faculty Club."
BOARD OF GOVERNORS
The Union is operated by a board
of governors composed of the dean of
students, the university business
manager, the alumni secretary, a
faculty member, the student man
ager, the student body president, and
one appointed student.
Operating the Union is a large job,
according to Miss Ricker. Aside

from the aforementioned 801,000 cups
of coffee, last fiscal year, from Sep
tember 11)53 to August 1954, the
Union sold 225,000 Jialf pints of milk,
3G.000 hamburgers, manufactured
13,134 gallons of ice cream, not to
mention hundreds of "gallons of
punch, syrup and sauces.
LOSS ON COFFEE
The problems in operating such a
large establishment are great, she
declared. Prices keep going up, but
the Union tries to keep operating
costs at a minimum. "The Union
price for a cup of coffee is only 5c,"
she said. "Stanford is practically the
only place where you can buy coffee
so cheap. The Union takes a loss on
every cup of coffee, but the board
figured it was worth it for the benefit
of the students."
Of course, when first bought
wholesale, coffee, or anything else f6r
that matter, costs less, but the stu
dent help, the containers and the
like brings the cost up.
MANY CRISES
"Crises are arriving all the time.
During the bread strike last year
we were making our bread, freez
ing bread and all sorts of things.
When a meat strike threatened last
week we began to load the freezers
up with meat.
"For the last couple of years the
Union had had trouble with the
leaky pipes in the building roof,
which was built in 1921. Last sum
mer 20 minutes before a large ban
quet a large portion of the ceiling
fell on the tables, burying in plaster
all the carefully set-up tables and
the fancy salads. But the tables
were cleared in time.
"You just take such things in
stride," she said.

Stafford Union, Cellar — these
are words often misused by Stan
ford students according to Miss
Ricker, director of the Unioru "Its
like the story of the three blind
men," she said. "When confronted
with an elephant one stuck his hand
out and felt the ears and swore they
were the sails of a boat; then an
other felt its side was sure it was a
wall, and the third felt the tail and
declared it was a snake.
"It's the same tiding with Stan
people. Their interpretation of the
Union is the part with which they
come in contact. To students it is
the particular place they buy a cup
of coffee; to faculty wives it is the
place they phone to send me three
gallons of punch in a hurry."

MANY DEPARTMENTS
The Stanford Union is the organi
zation which encompasses many de
partments, all on a separate financial
basis. There is the cigar-candy coun
ter and the outdoor snack bar, both
supervised by Miss C.unther, and the
public dining room and the women's
residence dining room, both operated
by Miss Bell, assisted by Miss Koors.
.The Cellar, the section in back of
the grill downstairs, is headed by
Miss Hawkins, aided by Mr. Strouse
who keeps it open late at night. Per
forming similar functions at the En
cina basement store is Mr. Black,
betted known as "Blackie." The
Union runs a catering service which
serves "everything from a gallon of
coffee to a full, dinner for the Men's
Faculty Club."
BOARD OF GOVERNORS
The Union is operated by a board
of governors composed of the dean of
students, the university business
manager, the alumni secretary, a
faculty member, the student man
ager, the student body president, and
one appointed student.
Operating the Union is a large job,
according to Miss Ricker. Aside

from the aforementioned 801,000 cups
of coffee, last fiscal year, from Sep
tember 11)53 to August 1954, the
Union sold 225,000 Jialf pints of milk,
3G.000 hamburgers, manufactured
13,134 gallons of ice cream, not to
mention hundreds of "gallons of
punch, syrup and sauces.
LOSS ON COFFEE
The problems in operating such a
large establishment are great, she
declared. Prices keep going up, but
the Union tries to keep operating
costs at a minimum. "The Union
price for a cup of coffee is only 5c,"
she said. "Stanford is practically the
only place where you can buy coffee
so cheap. The Union takes a loss on
every cup of coffee, but the board
figured it was worth it for the benefit
of the students."
Of course, when first bought
wholesale, coffee, or anything else f6r
that matter, costs less, but the stu
dent help, the containers and the
like brings the cost up.
MANY CRISES
"Crises are arriving all the time.
During the bread strike last year
we were making our bread, freez
ing bread and all sorts of things.
When a meat strike threatened last
week we began to load the freezers
up with meat.
"For the last couple of years the
Union had had trouble with the
leaky pipes in the building roof,
which was built in 1921. Last sum
mer 20 minutes before a large ban
quet a large portion of the ceiling
fell on the tables, burying in plaster
all the carefully set-up tables and
the fancy salads. But the tables
were cleared in time.
"You just take such things in
stride," she said.
If you buy a cup of. coffee
this year at Ihe Cellar, the out
door snack bar, or the Encina
store, it will be but one of op
proximately 801,000 cups.. That's
the amount the stores run by the
Stanford Union sold last year.
