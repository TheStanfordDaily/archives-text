Area.
Herr Blauth was born in Worms, Germany. He studied at the

universities of Heidelberg, Frei
burg, and Giessen. While he
was completing his teacher's
training at the latter, he was sent
to Italy by the foreign office of Ger
many under the Weimar Republic to
be headmaster of a German school
there. He held this position from
1928 to 1934. „
Blauth had ample opportunity to
observe a fascist country, but it
"didn't represent any personal prob
lem for me," he said, "for as a guest
of the country, I didn't think I had
any right to interfere with its poli
tics."
DIFFERENT SITUATION
When the Nazis took over in 1933,
the situation became entirely differ
ent. He was faced with the problem
of either conforming and carrying
on his work in accordance with the
orders of the new regime or giving
up his position. He left the school
in 1934.
Having made this decision, he
could not return to Germany with
out being placed under arrest. In
Italy, however, he was unmolested
because of the bitter quarrels of
Mussolini and Hitler over Austria.
BLAUTH EXPELLED
In 1938 when Rome and Berlin
joined hands, the anti-Nazi Germans
in Italy were shadowed day and
night. In 1939 Blauth was expelled
from Italy and came to the United

States.
For reservations for the dinner
students may call Ruth Wolpe at
Union, DA 3-9043.
