Jean Paul Sartre's philosophy that
"Life is a foul mess, and we must
all do the right thing and light evil,"

the last meeting of the Thursday
Lunch Club.
The discussion began with a talk,
"A Few Reflections on Sartre," by
Professor Georges LeMaitre of the
Department of Germanic and Ro
manic Languages.

difficult to understand Sartre's point
of view. "You do not understand
that Sartre speaks for over nine
tenths of the world's population,
which lives in squalor and fear."

followed it were similar to other
talks and discussions sponsored by
the Thursday launch Club in con
junction with the YWCA and the
Memorial Church Committee.
The meetings are held at noon on
the third floor of the Women's Club
house. Lunches are served for 30
