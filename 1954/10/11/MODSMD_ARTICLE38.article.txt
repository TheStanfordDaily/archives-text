# Desire' Played Big Pan In Navy's Win—Erdelatz
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Like Willie Mays, the Navy "come to win." And win they did
But you wouldn't have guessed it as the Middies strode into the
dressing room— grim, determined, expressionless.
Then, after about 20 minutes of tight-lipped guiet, the win-or
else tension exploded into a wild, back-slapping victory jubilee

Their 3,000-mile gridiron expedition
was a complete, glorious success.
Coach Eddie Erdelatz sat down
with the reporters and explained his
players' attitude: "You can wrap
them up in one word—desire. They
love to play football."
A couple of minutes later he em
phasized Navy's determination again:
"They want to play more than any
team I've been associated with."
Erdelatz was asked if the hard
charging, crunching style of play
came as a surprise. He shook his
head. "They play like this all the
time," he said.
SLOW STARTER
He explained the series of Navy
fumbles which followed the opening
kick-off: "It took 'em a little while
to get their poise. But when they
have a bad break, it doesn't mean
a thing to them."
The pleasant Navy headman was
radiating pride and satisfaction, but
he spoke softly and almost only
when questioned. One of the few
times he talked without prompting
was to praise Len Benzi, the driv
ing Midshipman guard who blocked
the punt for the first-period touch
down.
BEAGLE PRAISEI)
About Ron Beagle, a great end
with tremendously quick reactions,
Erdelatz almost shouted his praise:
"He's terrific, just terrific! Every
game he plays is a good one."
Then he was quiet again as he
praised the Cards' Jerry Goldberg
and told how the Navy took ad
vantage of Stanford defensive spac
ing.
"Yes, this was our best game," he
answered. "Yes, I'd say this is the
best team I've had in five years at
the Academy."
How did Erdelatz himself feel
about the Bay Area triumph? "This
is peaches and cream for me," he
said with a big grin. And indeed it
was peaches and cream for Navy
men around the world.
