## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
After a slow start the Stanford
Brave smashed Treasure Island by
a 20-0 score in the preliminary to
the Annapolis debacle.
Once again the Stanford star was
quarterback Jack Lewis. Lewis
threw 11 passes and completed six
for 140 yards, three for touchdowns,
and ran 02 yards for a fourth score
only to have it called back because
of a clipping penalty.
The Braves controlled the game
throughout the first half but could
not .score until the last 35 seconds
of the second quarter. Lewis and
Scott Jones alternated carrying'the
ball and worked it down to the TI
10. Then Lewis faded back and hit
Bob Beatie in the end zone and John
Forbush added the PAT.
The second half was no contest as
the Cards sewed up the game with
two quick scores and settled down
to hold TI. The sailors kicked off.
and after a fumble stopped the first
drive. The Braves started again
from their own 32. Lewis hit Jim
Stewart for 31 yards, Stewart ran
for 13, and Lewis went for 10 to
place the ball on the 15. A penalty
set the Cards back to the 35, so
Lewis hit Phil Backer on the five
and Phil went in to score. Angove's
try for the extra point was wide.
A minute and a half later Stan
ford was in the end zone again. The
Braves took over on the TI 43 and
Lewis hit Carl Isaacs on the 25 and
the big end rambled the remaining
distance. This time Jerry Angove
split the uprights,
Roy Ottoson, ex-COP star, tried
vainly to move the Navy boys into
the Stanford end zone, but it was a
one-man effort and all in vain. He
completed 18 of 33 aerials but many
were short spot passes.
