Footballers from the Class of '58 |
start vigorous workouts this after
noon in preparation lor a clash with
the UCLA Brubabes next Saturday
in the Coliseum.
Among the 75 hopefuls who will
report to Coach Bob Ghilotti are
All-CIF quarterback Jon Douglas,
Lou Valli of Bellarmine, and Stan
ford's first Negro footballer, Tom
Williams, a 165 - pound speedster
from Chicago.
Ghilotti has two 220-pound tack
les in Chris Plain and Gary Allen
as well as many outstanding high
school backs, but with only one
week of practice before the first
