FOOD FOR ALL—Guests of the seven men's eating clubs, women of the row houses are pic
tured above eating lunch in the patio of the club houses. There were approximately 400 alto
gether who ate at the cafeteria-style lunch which began at 11:30. As the lunch was held prior
to the Stanford-Navy game last Saturday, most of the girls were dressed in the traditional red
skirts and white blouses. The building which now houses the eating clubs was constructed in
1952; until that time the members ate in Encina. —Daily photo by Ken Green
