# Atom-Powered Planes Planned

WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 (UP) —
The Air Force, moving a step nearer
atom-powered planes, is expected to
start work soon on a $30,000,000 lab
oratory at East Hartford, Conn., to
help in developing an atomic air
plane engine.
The laboratory, known as the
"Hartford Research Facility," will be
built by the Air Force in conjunc
tion with Pratt & Whitney Aircraft
of East Hartford. Pratt & Whitney
is one of five companies which have
been working for three years on an
atomic engine and airplane.
IN TESTING STAGE'
When completed, it will cost $30,-
000,000. Plans for its construction
offered the first concrete clue that
progress is being made on an atomic
plane engine and that the program
is moving out of the "study stage"
into perhaps the "development" or
"testing" stage.
No description of the future pur
pose of the laboratory was given in
a non-secret listing of the project
when it was approved by the last
session of Congress. But informed
sources linked it with Pratt & Whit
ney's work on an atomic engine.
There is a possibility the facility
will not be devoted entirely to
atomic research, but wiil also be
used in connection with the Air
Force's goal to develop a jet engine
with 25,000 pounds of thrust—more
than twice as powerful as any jet
engine it now has.
