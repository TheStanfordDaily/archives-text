# ASSU:
## Clarification Of Liquor Policy Told 
### DICK MANSFIELD Associate Editor, The Daily 
The Associated Students of
Stanford University have
clamped down on the issuance
of purchase orders for alcoholic
beverages, according to a notice
released recently through the
office of Student Manager Bob
Gable.
The mimeographed statement, is
sued to treasurers of all campus or
ganizations and living groups, said,
in part:
"At no time during the coming
year will any liquor purchases
knowingly be authorized or pro
cessed by the ASSU."
PURPOSE
Purpose of the move is to protect
the treasurers and the student man
ager, who sign purchase orders, and
members of the administration
staff, who countersign payment
checks for ASSU.
Under Section 61 of the California
State* Alcoholic Beverages Control
Act, all these persons would be le
gally responsible for providing liq
uor to minors should it be proved
that minors imbibed liquor pur
chased on ASSU purchase orders.
The law specifies that "Every
person who sells, furnishes, or
causes to be sold, furnished, or given
away any alcoholic beverage to any
person under the age of 21 years
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."
In signing purchase orders and
payment checks for liquor for per
sons under 21, all persons listed
above are thus guilty of a misde
meanor.
TREASURERS SIGN
The statement as circulated in
cluded a note specifying the ASSU
stand and a copy of pertinent parts
of the California state liquor law as
it applies to minors.
Group treasurers were directed to
read the liquor laws carefully, then
sign a statement indicating that they
had done so and return this state
ment to the ASSU office.
Gable hopes thus to publicize the
law through the treasurers to all
students on campus, and especially
to warn the individual treasurers
who, in signing purchase orders for
refreshments, are ultimately ex
posed to the risk.
RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of treasur
ers to ascertain whether or not mi
nors will be present at parties for
which liquor is to be purchased.
Gable indicates that groups such as
the Graduate Student Organization
which obviously should be exempted
from the ASSU restriction may get
purchase orders freely if the group
treasurer signs a statement that all
group members are over 21 years of
age.
Gable emphasizes that the law
quoted is not a new law. "We are
merely formalizing our procedure
and not changing it,"he said.
Students who have questions about
the ASSU restrictions may contact
the ASSU office, Gable indicated.

Gable indicates that groups such as
the Graduate Student Organization
which obviously should be exempted
from the ASSU restriction may get
purchase orders freely if the group
treasurer signs a statement that all
group members are over 21 years of
age.
Gable emphasizes that the law
quoted is not a new law. "We are
merely formalizing our procedure
and not changing it,"he said.
Students who have questions about
the ASSU restrictions may contact
the ASSU office, Gable indicated.
The Associated Students of
Stanford University have
clamped down on the issuance
of purchase orders for alcoholic
beverages, according to a notice
released recently through the
office of Student Manager Bob
Gable.
The mimeographed statement, is
sued to treasurers of all campus or
ganizations and living groups, said,
in part:
"At no time during the coming
year will any liquor purchases
knowingly be authorized or pro
cessed by the ASSU."
PURPOSE
Purpose of the move is to protect
the treasurers and the student man
ager, who sign purchase orders, and
members of the administration
staff, who countersign payment
checks for ASSU.
Under Section 61 of the California
State* Alcoholic Beverages Control
Act, all these persons would be le
gally responsible for providing liq
uor to minors should it be proved
that minors imbibed liquor pur
chased on ASSU purchase orders.
The law specifies that "Every
person who sells, furnishes, or
causes to be sold, furnished, or given
away any alcoholic beverage to any
person under the age of 21 years
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."
In signing purchase orders and
payment checks for liquor for per
sons under 21, all persons listed
above are thus guilty of a misde
meanor.
TREASURERS SIGN
The statement as circulated in
cluded a note specifying the ASSU
stand and a copy of pertinent parts
of the California state liquor law as
it applies to minors.
Group treasurers were directed to
read the liquor laws carefully, then
sign a statement indicating that they
had done so and return this state
ment to the ASSU office.
Gable hopes thus to publicize the
law through the treasurers to all
students on campus, and especially
to warn the individual treasurers
who, in signing purchase orders for
refreshments, are ultimately ex
posed to the risk.
RESPONSIBILITY
It is the responsibility of treasur
ers to ascertain whether or not mi
nors will be present at parties for
which liquor is to be purchased.
Gable indicates that groups such as
the Graduate Student Organization
which obviously should be exempted
from the ASSU restriction may get
purchase orders freely if the group
treasurer signs a statement that all
group members are over 21 years of
age.
