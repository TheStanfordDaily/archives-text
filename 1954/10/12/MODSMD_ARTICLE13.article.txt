### RALPH CAHN 
U.S. Senator Thomas H. Ku
chel, speaking before a lunch
eon audience at Rickey's res
taurant yesterday, toid of prog
ress made by the Eisenhower
administration and pi e d g e d
himself to support it.
The California Republican Sena
tor, up for re-election on Nov. 2,
gave his views on taxes, labor rela
tions, and farm price subsidies.
Kuchel stated that he had recently
talked to large groups of farmers
and told them that he favored re
duction of price subsidies. He ex
plained that he was in favor of free
enterprise and commented that the
farmers he had talked to agreed.
FARM PROGRAM
"On farm legislation," the Senator
said, "you will remember that for
years Congress has provided that
the government will purchase, at 00
per cent parity, surplus crops." The
people of the United States were
paying, Kuchel said, $700,000 per day
for crop storage.
He spoke of "spoon-feeding enough
narcotic to the American farmer"
being impossible, and favored, with
Eisenhower, "that a flexible price
control system be instituted."
The Senator pointed out his vot
ing record and the list of bills he
has sponsored or co-sponsored with

colleagues, Democrats as well as Re
publicans. He felt, as far as inter
party co-operation was conccrned,
"We are entering an area of agree
ment . . . with respect to the na
tion's government."
Among the bills Kuchel has spon
sored are a second southern crossing
of San Francisco Bay and plans'for
the building of a Veterans Admin
istration psycho-neurotic hospital in
this area. He has also sponsored a
farm-subsidy bill for cotton farmers
in California.
TAX REDUCTION
Kuchel pointed "with special
pride" to the achievements of the
Eisenhower administration in tax
reduction. Both excise and person
al - income taxes, Kuchel declared,
had been reduced —due primarily to
reduction of spending by federal
agencies.
Senator Kuchel was introduced,
after lunch, by Albert R. Bower,
who told of Kuchcl's past record.
After serving two terms in the Cali
fornia Assembly, one in the State
Senate, and three years in the U.S.
Navy, Bower said. Kuchel was ap
pointed to the Senate by California's
Governor Warren to rcplacc Vice-
President Nixon.
The Senator arrived with his wife
by plane a few hours befove the
luncheon and was escorted to Rick
ey's by a group of Stanford Area
Young Republicans, most of whom
also attended the luncheon.
