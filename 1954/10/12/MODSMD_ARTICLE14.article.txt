# French Assembly Votes On London Plan Today
## Issue Expected To Be Approved 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 11 (UP)—The So
cialist Party threw Its 104 votes
behind the London Plan for Ger
man rearmament tonight, virtual
ly assuring approval in tomor
row's national assembly vote on
which Premier Pierre Mendes-
France stakes his government.
Political experts figured Mendes-
France would get about 350 votes in
the 627 - member chamber on the
confidence test.
The ballot was set for 3 p.m. (6
a.m. PST). It would authorize Men
des-France to go ahead with nego
tiations aimed at putting into effect
the London scheme for restoring
sovereignty to West Germany and
mobilizing its arms in the ranks of
Western defenses.
NEEDS MAJORITY
Having made it a vote of confi
dence, Mendes-France needs a sim
ple majority to stay in office. In the
now unlikely event of a reverse, he
would be obliged to resign.
Almost all its leaders counseled
that it would be worse for France to
reject the London plan than to ac
cept it, with whatever misgivings.
The verdict came after Guy Mol
let, party secretary general; Daniel
Mayer, foreign affairs commission
chairman; Felix Gouin, former pre
mier; and Paul Ramadier, former
premier, lined up on the side of
Mendes-France.
They were joined by party chief
tains such as Charles Lussy, parlia
mentary group chairman; Robert
Lacoste, and Max Lejeune. Among
the big names, only Marcel Edmond
Naegelen and Andre Philip spoke
against the plan.
BIDS TO SOCIALISTS
The premier had invited the So
cialists to end three lean years in
the opposition and enter the govern
ment. Mollet was reported persist
ently to have been approached with
offers of the foreign ministry port
folio, which Mendes - France now
holds.
Actually, the vote tomorrow is
only on the principle of the agree
ment reached in London for West
German entry, into the North At
lantic Treaty Organization and the
Brussels Pact.
Ratification debate must follow
later. None of the parties had ex
tended provisional support to in
clude that.
On the negative side tomorrow
will be the Communists and a hard
core opposed to the premier's poli
•cies or any form of German rearma
ment. The Popular Republicans and
some Conservatives are expected to
abstain.

NEEDS MAJORITY
Having made it a vote of confi
dence, Mendes-France needs a sim
ple majority to stay in office. In the
now unlikely event of a reverse, he
would be obliged to resign.
Almost all its leaders counseled
that it would be worse for France to
reject the London plan than to ac
cept it, with whatever misgivings.
The verdict came after Guy Mol
let, party secretary general; Daniel
Mayer, foreign affairs commission
chairman; Felix Gouin, former pre
mier; and Paul Ramadier, former
premier, lined up on the side of
Mendes-France.
They were joined by party chief
tains such as Charles Lussy, parlia
mentary group chairman; Robert
Lacoste, and Max Lejeune. Among
the big names, only Marcel Edmond
Naegelen and Andre Philip spoke
against the plan.
BIDS TO SOCIALISTS
The premier had invited the So
cialists to end three lean years in
the opposition and enter the govern
ment. Mollet was reported persist
ently to have been approached with
offers of the foreign ministry port
folio, which Mendes - France now
holds.
Actually, the vote tomorrow is
only on the principle of the agree
ment reached in London for West
German entry, into the North At
lantic Treaty Organization and the
Brussels Pact.
Ratification debate must follow
later. None of the parties had ex
tended provisional support to in
clude that.
On the negative side tomorrow
will be the Communists and a hard
core opposed to the premier's poli
•cies or any form of German rearma
ment. The Popular Republicans and
some Conservatives are expected to
abstain.

PARIS, Oct. 11 (UP)—The So
cialist Party threw Its 104 votes
behind the London Plan for Ger
man rearmament tonight, virtual
ly assuring approval in tomor
row's national assembly vote on
which Premier Pierre Mendes-
France stakes his government.
Political experts figured Mendes-
France would get about 350 votes in
the 627 - member chamber on the
confidence test.
The ballot was set for 3 p.m. (6
a.m. PST). It would authorize Men
des-France to go ahead with nego
tiations aimed at putting into effect
the London scheme for restoring
sovereignty to West Germany and
mobilizing its arms in the ranks of
Western defenses.
