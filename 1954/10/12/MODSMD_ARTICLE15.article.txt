# Hindu Performers To Dance Tonight
## 
### 
Shivaram and Janaki, two Hin
du classical dancers, will present
a program of traditional Hindu
temple dances tonight as part of
the Tuesday Evening Scries. It
will be given at 7:30 in Memorial
Auditorium.
The dances are part of the
Kathakali dance-drama of south
west India and were originated to
educate Hindus in the lore of their
faith.
Both dancers are from the Mala
bar district of India and have been
studying dancing since they were
children. They have performed
previously in Europe, Canada,
Australia, and the Orient.
