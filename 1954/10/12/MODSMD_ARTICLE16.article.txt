# New Electronics Laboratory To Specialize in Research Work
## 
### 
The opening of a newly organized engineering research facility
at Stanford, the Applied Electronics Laboratory, was announced
yesterday by Dean F. E. Terman of the School of Engineering.
Scientists in the new laboratory will be engaged in industrial
and government research work, he said. Their efforts are to be

directed at the development and ex
ploitation of new discoveries in elec
tronics.
