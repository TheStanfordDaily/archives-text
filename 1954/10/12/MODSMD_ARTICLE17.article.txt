The administration said today that
fi.926 federal employees have been
fired or resigned under its new se
curity program—including 75 at the
Central Intelligence Agency and
three at the Atomic Energy Com
mission.
The report by the Civil Service
Commission touched off an angry
burst of political fireworks. GOP
National Chairman Leonard W. Hall
aid it "completely vindicates" Vice-
President Richard M. Nixon against
Democratic charges of "liar."
But Democratic National Chair
*nan Stephen A. Mitchell branded
the report as a "hoax" and "low pol
itics." He said the Republicans are
"rattled" at the prospect of defeat
in next month's Congressional elec
tions and are determined to win "at
any cost."
