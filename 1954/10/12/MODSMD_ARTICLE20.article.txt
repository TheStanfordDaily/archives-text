# The 						Crucial Vote
## 
### 
Trench Premier Pierre Mendes-France will
risk his government today in a vote of confi
dence on the newly signed London Pact.
He is asking the National Assembly, the
same body which voted against the European
Defense Community, to authorize him to con
tinue negotiations for granting West Germany
lull sovereignty and membership in the Euro
pean anti-communist coalition.
li has been encouraging to note the change
in French attitude since the nine-power talks in
London. Where once there was a negative
silence on the part of Mendes-France and sharp
disagreement among the deputies, there is now
.strong leadership and an apparent willingness
io compromise and agree within the Assembly.
The reasons for the new air of hope and
optimism in Paris aren't difficult to uncover.
First, under the London agreement Great
Britain has promised to maintain four divisions
and a tactical air force in Europe so long as a
threat to the area exists. One of the primary
objections to EDC by the French was the Brit
ish refusal to actively participate in the defense
of Western Europe.
Second, the German rearmament program
will be supervised jointly by the Brussels al
liance and the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion, providing a stronger safeguard than orig
inally guaranteed under EDC.

Third, the age-old French German battle over
control of the Saar has been temporarily put
aside in a mutual effort by the two countries
to absolve the differences that divide them.
Yet even these concessions haven't satisfied
the entire French Parliament. The Popular Re
publican Movement has threatened to vote
against the nine-power accord on the grounds
that German rearmament would not be suffi
ciently controlled. The MRP favors a closer
military-economic association such as was pro
vided by EDC.
Socialist opposition is reported weakening,
but the communists and pro-communists will
cast a block 'of 105 votes against the pact.
In short, although the primary obstacles to
German rearmament have been removed, dif
ficulties still exist. And it is in the faces of
these difficulties that Mendes-France is stak
ing his government and the fate of European
defense today.
The vote of the French Assembly today will
go down as one of the most crucial decisions
of recent history. If Mendes-France fails to win
a vote of confidence, his government will be
dissolved and European defense will be scut
tled along with French stability.
If he wins the vote, Europe will have ad
vanced a long way toward its goal of peace
through strength and unity. *

optimism in Paris aren't difficult to uncover.
First, under the London agreement Great
Britain has promised to maintain four divisions
and a tactical air force in Europe so long as a
threat to the area exists. One of the primary
objections to EDC by the French was the Brit
ish refusal to actively participate in the defense
of Western Europe.
Second, the German rearmament program
will be supervised jointly by the Brussels al
liance and the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion, providing a stronger safeguard than orig
inally guaranteed under EDC.

Third, the age-old French German battle over
control of the Saar has been temporarily put
aside in a mutual effort by the two countries
to absolve the differences that divide them.
Yet even these concessions haven't satisfied
the entire French Parliament. The Popular Re
publican Movement has threatened to vote
against the nine-power accord on the grounds
that German rearmament would not be suffi
ciently controlled. The MRP favors a closer
military-economic association such as was pro
vided by EDC.
Socialist opposition is reported weakening,
but the communists and pro-communists will
cast a block 'of 105 votes against the pact.
In short, although the primary obstacles to
German rearmament have been removed, dif
ficulties still exist. And it is in the faces of
these difficulties that Mendes-France is stak
ing his government and the fate of European
defense today.
The vote of the French Assembly today will
go down as one of the most crucial decisions
of recent history. If Mendes-France fails to win
a vote of confidence, his government will be
dissolved and European defense will be scut
tled along with French stability.
If he wins the vote, Europe will have ad
vanced a long way toward its goal of peace
through strength and unity. *
