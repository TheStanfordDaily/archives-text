# U.S. Called ‘Materialistic’ By Student from Australia
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
"Things we Australians hear
about the United States from
American films, comic books,
and tourists, the sordid tales of
a youthful killer in Brooklyn—
these give a totally unfair im
pression of the American peo
ple," David Penny, ASSU For
eign Scholar from the Land
Down Under, remarked thought
fully in a recent interview.
'"Frankly, though, I have found
one rumor to be true. I have found
that America is truly materialistic.
Your values of success are expressed
in economic, or rather materialistic,
terms."
The 23-year-old economics grad
uate of the University of Adelaide
sat back comfortably in his booth in
the Cellar and reflected on his first
impressions of his foster country.
"I was not at all surprised by Amer
ican sensitivity to feelings abroad,
but was quite pleasantly surprised
by the fact that people have as much
freedom of discussion here as they
do in Australia."
ACADEMIC FREEDOM
"The government in Australia," he
recalled, "controls all the universi
ties, but interferes little with aca
demic freedom. At the University
of Adelaide, we had one Communist
on the faculty. We despised his
opinions, but we would have fought
any attempts of the university to
release him."
Penny, who is now studying with
the Food Research Institute, was a
leader in his student government,
serving two years as treasurer of th§
student body, and also serving as
president of the Dramatics Society
and, last year, as president of the
Student Council.

He expressed a deep interest in
Stanford's National Student Associ
ation affairs, and cited examples of
work done on a practical plane by
a similar Australian organization,
the National Union of Australian
University Students.
HELP INDONESIA
"Through the association," he said,
"graduate students are sent to the
backward, undeveloped areas of In
donesia to work with the local in
habitants at local rates of pay. We
are helping them to help them
selves."
"This type of economic aid," he
said eagerly, "the United States
could well employ rather than mili
tary intervention."
On his return to Australia, Penny
plans either to become a part of the
Indonesian program or seek similar
work in Malaya.
To the oft - posed question of

American prestige abroad, Penny
stated that there is a dual attitude
in Australia. On one hand is the
great legacy oJ godd will because ol
American aid during the war, but
on the other hand there is the feel
ing that the American foreign policy
in Asia is too one-sided, blind to the
existence of Communist China.
WHITE AUSTRALIA'
"Australia," he declared, "is tied
more to the Western nations than
Asia. She follows Britain and the
United States hall and half."
Penny could foresee no end to the
"white Australia" policy, a policy
which has in the past restricted non
whites from taking residence on the
Australian continent. "There are
many Oriental students at Austral
ian universities and they meet very
little racial discrimination. The
problem arises when they attempt to
settle there."
"The majority of the university
population is against the 'white
Australia' policy," he injected, "bul
no politician dare speak out against
it for fear of getting his political
head chopped off "
Stanford informality'
Turning for a moment to one of
the lighter aspects of university life,
Penny observed with a twinkle in
his eye that a Stanford student is as
much obliged to wear sloppy clothes
as an Australian is to wear a more
formal attire. "Informality," he
chided, "is wearing what you want,
but wearing it neatly."
"Football?" he said. "It is not
football. There is only one football,
and that is soccer. There has been
such an emphasis placed on the
thing you call football that it has
become an institution within the
university.
"In Australia the emphasis is on
playing any sport, rather than all
competing to be a big shot in one.
And we still have the Davis Cup."
"I feel a certain freedom and ease
here that is lacking in Australia,"
he said with a far-off look in his
eye. "I could describe this as but
one of the reasons that I am glad to
be here."

On his return to Australia, Penny
plans either to become a part of the
Indonesian program or seek similar
work in Malaya.
To the oft - posed question of

American prestige abroad, Penny
stated that there is a dual attitude
in Australia. On one hand is the
great legacy oJ godd will because ol
American aid during the war, but
on the other hand there is the feel
ing that the American foreign policy
in Asia is too one-sided, blind to the
existence of Communist China.
WHITE AUSTRALIA'
"Australia," he declared, "is tied
more to the Western nations than
Asia. She follows Britain and the
United States hall and half."
Penny could foresee no end to the
"white Australia" policy, a policy
which has in the past restricted non
whites from taking residence on the
Australian continent. "There are
many Oriental students at Austral
ian universities and they meet very
little racial discrimination. The
problem arises when they attempt to
settle there."
"The majority of the university
population is against the 'white
Australia' policy," he injected, "bul
no politician dare speak out against
it for fear of getting his political
head chopped off "
Stanford informality'
Turning for a moment to one of
the lighter aspects of university life,
Penny observed with a twinkle in
his eye that a Stanford student is as
much obliged to wear sloppy clothes
as an Australian is to wear a more
formal attire. "Informality," he
chided, "is wearing what you want,
but wearing it neatly."
"Football?" he said. "It is not
football. There is only one football,
and that is soccer. There has been
such an emphasis placed on the
thing you call football that it has
become an institution within the
university.
"In Australia the emphasis is on
playing any sport, rather than all
competing to be a big shot in one.
And we still have the Davis Cup."
"I feel a certain freedom and ease
here that is lacking in Australia,"
he said with a far-off look in his
eye. "I could describe this as but
one of the reasons that I am glad to
be here."

"Things we Australians hear
about the United States from
American films, comic books,
and tourists, the sordid tales of
a youthful killer in Brooklyn—
these give a totally unfair im
pression of the American peo
ple," David Penny, ASSU For
eign Scholar from the Land
Down Under, remarked thought
fully in a recent interview.
'"Frankly, though, I have found
one rumor to be true. I have found
that America is truly materialistic.
Your values of success are expressed
in economic, or rather materialistic,
terms."
The 23-year-old economics grad
uate of the University of Adelaide
sat back comfortably in his booth in
the Cellar and reflected on his first
impressions of his foster country.
"I was not at all surprised by Amer
ican sensitivity to feelings abroad,
but was quite pleasantly surprised
by the fact that people have as much
freedom of discussion here as they
do in Australia."
ACADEMIC FREEDOM
"The government in Australia," he
recalled, "controls all the universi
ties, but interferes little with aca
demic freedom. At the University
of Adelaide, we had one Communist
on the faculty. We despised his
opinions, but we would have fought
any attempts of the university to
release him."
Penny, who is now studying with
the Food Research Institute, was a
leader in his student government,
serving two years as treasurer of th§
student body, and also serving as
president of the Dramatics Society
and, last year, as president of the
Student Council.

He expressed a deep interest in
Stanford's National Student Associ
ation affairs, and cited examples of
work done on a practical plane by
a similar Australian organization,
the National Union of Australian
University Students.
HELP INDONESIA
"Through the association," he said,
"graduate students are sent to the
backward, undeveloped areas of In
donesia to work with the local in
habitants at local rates of pay. We
are helping them to help them
selves."
"This type of economic aid," he
said eagerly, "the United States
could well employ rather than mili
tary intervention."
On his return to Australia, Penny
plans either to become a part of the
