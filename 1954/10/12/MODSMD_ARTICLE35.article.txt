# Stern 1 Edges Stern 4, 2-1, in Mural Opener
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
The .intramural season got under
way yesterday with a bevy of low
scoring games. Typical of games
played was the Stern 1 vs. Stern 4
brawl which saw a safety scored on
the last play to give the first llooi
a well-earned victory.
Aside from a 75-yard Stern 1 pass
from Cardoza to Spindler in the
opening minutes of the second half,
the game was a tooth-and-nail af
fair carried on in mid-field. After
Spindler's catch, the? offense died
out and Stern 4 took over on their
own five.
Neither team was without its
stars today and the low scoring
can he attributed to stellar de
fensive play by Cardoza, Brown,
anil Crocker of Stern 1 and Seeds
an:! Ken Townsend of Stern 4.
The most exciting' play of the

'janie came when with only one
more play left in overtime Cardoza
cut back over left tackle and raced
it) yards to the two-yard line. Here
Stern 4 took over and on the next
play Speizer, who looked good in
rushing all day, trapped Pete Fort
in his own end zone for tin* only
score of the game.
