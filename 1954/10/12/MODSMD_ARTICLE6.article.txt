# Reds to Leave Far East Port

### 
LONDON, Oct. 11 (UP)â€”Russia
and Communist China announced
jointly tonight that Soviet troops
and ships would withdraw by next
June from Port Arthur, the great
Manchurian port and naval base
they have occupied since the second
World War.
A statement of the two Commu
nist powers, broadcast from Moscow,
indicated plainly that the Port Ar
thur withdrawal was designed to
put pressure on the United States
to abandon the Chinese Nationalists
on Formosa.
The joint declaration shaped up as
a major policy proclamation by the
two major Communist powers. On
its face it hoisted Red China into a
position of full partnership with the
Soviets, rather than a satellite.
It was issued after negotiations in
Peiping. China was represented by
its two top men, party chairman
Mao Tse-tung and Premier-Foreign
Minister Chou En-lai. Russians en
voy was Nikita Krushchev, party
first secretary generally rated as No.
2 in Moscow.
The statement did not make clear
whether Russia proposed to with
draw all its troops from Chinese soil.
In addition to the garrison and naval
base at Port Arthur, the Soviets
maintain a small garrison in the
neighboring city of Darien.
