DO-IT-YOURSELF CHARGE PLAN
has no down payment,
gives 6 months to pay!
Big bills become small talk with this unusual
new charge plan!
You decide how much you want to pay for
clothes each month, multiply it by 6 for your
6-month charge limit. (There's a 1% service
charge on the monthly balance.) For example,
if you wanted to pay $10 a month, you could
always owe up to $60.
If you wish to open one of these new accounts
or convert your regular charge account or your
30-60-90 account to this new payment plan, drop
in to any Roos store today!
