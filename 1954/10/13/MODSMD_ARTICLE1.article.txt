# TUESDAY SERIES
## Colorful and Interpretive Hindu Dances Performed 
### RALPH CAHN 
Hindu dancer Shivaram, and his wife, Janaki, bolh from the
Malabar district of India, performed a group of ancient interpretive
dances before a full and enthusiastic audience in Memorial Audi
torium last night.
Demonstrating the means of expressing mood and even the

subtlest meanings through dance,
Shivaram showed why he is consid
ered the finest dancer of his type in
India.
He was accompanied by flute,
drums, and sitar (a stringed instru
ment,) on records, and symbols and
drums, played by Australian-born
Louise Lightfoot, who discovered
Shivaram and Janaki while study
ing in India.
Miss Lightfoot described the mean
ings of each movement in the dances
of Shivaram, explaining how a com
plete story can be told through the
medium of dance.
STUDENT OF THE DANCE
Shivaram performed also the va
rious exercises necessary for a stu
dent of the dance. He began his
training at the age of eight, Miss
Lightfoot said, and was required to
practice many hours every day, since
training for dancers in India in
volves even the co-ordination of eye
muscles. The slightest movements
of eyes and fingers have meaning
in the spiritual and supernatural
story plays of the Hindu Religion.
Shivaram also demonstrated nine
main moods in terms of the gesture
language of 26 hand positions, and
stylized expressions: love, heroism,
sympathy, anger, contempt, fear, dis
gust, wonder, and peace. With al

most incliscernable changes in ex
pression, Shivaram "said" the words
"growing," "separation" and "death,"
among others.
He translated a Hindu poem into
dance form, which was amazingly
graceful, due to a standard dance
pattern interlude between each
meaning expressed in the poem.
STORY IN DANCE
Shivaram told in dance a story of
a hermit and his meeting with vari
ous animals of the jungle: cobra,
lion, bees, and elephant. He was
dressed, for this interpretative dance,
in a leopard skin, and wore a wig
of long black hair. As Shivaram
danced, his every movement made
the nearness of the animal he was
describing seem real.
Close co-ordination between danc
ers, accompanying sound effects,
and dialogue were a major cause
of the success of the dance, but the
grace and expression of Shivaram
would undoubtedly be noticeable
under any conditions.

rious exercises necessary for a stu
dent of the dance. He began his
training at the age of eight, Miss
Lightfoot said, and was required to
practice many hours every day, since
training for dancers in India in
volves even the co-ordination of eye
muscles. The slightest movements
of eyes and fingers have meaning
in the spiritual and supernatural
story plays of the Hindu Religion.
Shivaram also demonstrated nine
main moods in terms of the gesture
language of 26 hand positions, and
stylized expressions: love, heroism,
sympathy, anger, contempt, fear, dis
gust, wonder, and peace. With al

most incliscernable changes in ex
pression, Shivaram "said" the words
"growing," "separation" and "death,"
among others.
He translated a Hindu poem into
dance form, which was amazingly
graceful, due to a standard dance
pattern interlude between each
meaning expressed in the poem.
STORY IN DANCE
Shivaram told in dance a story of
a hermit and his meeting with vari
ous animals of the jungle: cobra,
lion, bees, and elephant. He was
dressed, for this interpretative dance,
in a leopard skin, and wore a wig
of long black hair. As Shivaram
danced, his every movement made
the nearness of the animal he was
describing seem real.
Close co-ordination between danc
ers, accompanying sound effects,
and dialogue were a major cause
of the success of the dance, but the
grace and expression of Shivaram
would undoubtedly be noticeable
under any conditions.
