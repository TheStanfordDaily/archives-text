DETROIT, Oct. 12 (UP)—Sec
retary of Defense Charles E.
Wilson today accused political
opponents of "trying to capital
ize on a misinterpretation" of his
analogy of hunting dogs and un
employed workers.
The cabinet member drew heavy
labor and political fire for an off
the-cufT press conference remark
yesterday in which he used an anal
ogy contrasting bird dogs and ken
nel-fed dogs in discussing the prob
lems of the unemployed.
"To make a point that I admired
spirit and initiative, I said I even
prefer hunting dogs to kennel-fed
dogs because the hunting dogs or
bird dogs would get out and hunt
for what they wanted, whereas the
kennel-fed dog would sit back on
his haunches and yelp," WiLson said
in a prepared statement.
INTENDED NO COMPARISONS
"I certainly intended no invidious
comparisons, no insinuations liken
ing people to dogs in any sense.
And for anyone to imply that I did
or under any circumstances would
think that way is a complete dis
tortion of the facts," he added.
"I am sure that the distorted ver
sion of what I said is being used by
the people of the adverse political
party trying to capitalize on a mis
interpretation of the full meaning
of what I actually said."
His statement camc shortly after
Walter P. Reuther, president of the
CIO and the CIO United Auto
Workers' Union, staged a press con
ference at which he said Wilson
gave the Communists "a good psy
chological weapon" with the contro
versial remark.
