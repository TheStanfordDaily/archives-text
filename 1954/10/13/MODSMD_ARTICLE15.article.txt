## Blauth Depicts Fascist State 
### RUTH WOLPE 
A description of life in a fas
cist state and an analysis of cer
tain trends in this country were
given last night by Henry
Blauth at a dinner of the Young
Democrats of the Stanford Area.
"Hatred," said Blauth, "character
izes a fascist regime. The Nazi con
viction was that all men who do not
believe as I do are my enemies
whom I must convert or kill."
"If he is the enemy," he contin
ued, "any means is fair. The only
thing that counts is to knock him
down. It is disturbing to me to see
the similarities with a movement we
have here."
GUILT BY ASSOCIATION
One feature of public life in a fas
cist state which is superior to that in
a democracy is their emphasis upon
youth, Blauth said. "American youth
everywhere hears 'you are too
young.' Delinquency springs from
this feeling of unacceptance."
Guilt by association is a time-hon
ored fascist procedure, he said. "The
one trick used all the time by the
fascists was to refer to the enemy
in a derogatory way. In this country
I see the first signs of this technique.
McCarthy calls Senator Fulbright,
Senator Halfbright."
"You must stop things as they
start," he concluded. "If you wait
until the great change, then you can
save your efforts, for it is already
too late."
