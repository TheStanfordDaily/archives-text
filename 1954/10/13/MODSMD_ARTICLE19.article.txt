# LONDON CONFERENCE
## French Assembly Backs Premier 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 12 (UP) â€”The National Assembly gave an uncon
ditional vote of confidence today to Premier Pierre Mendos Franco
and his policy of rearming a free Germany under controls imposed
by the London conference.
The Assembly's vote of 350 to 113 gave Mendes-France a freo

hand in forthcoming
with the Western Allies on the Ger
man rearmament issue that has split
France and led the same Assembly
to reject EDC only 43 days ago by
a vote of 319 to 264. ,
Today's ballot was a showdown
vote although the Assembly will be
called upon later to ratify the Lon
don accords formally once a host of
difficult details have been ' worked
out at a series of international con
ferences.
MEETING SLATED
And although France will have
another chance to decide whether it
wants to rearm its old enemy, it
appeared almost certain the deputies
would agree, even if with resigna
tion and reservations.
An international conference opens
Oct. 20 when the nine nations of the
London conference meet to block
out the full details of how Germany
can be admitted into the 14-nation
NATO and the expanded Brussels
Pact.
After this meeting the National
Assembly will be asked to ratify the
London accord with the other eight
parliaments. In the meantime Men
des-France will be able to strength
en his chances by trying to win more
concessions from the Allies.
DIFFERENT SITUATION
The situation will be far differ
ent from the vote rejecting EDC and
plunging Europe into a defense
crisis, for the London conference
showed that France would be iso
lated if she refused anew and tried
to buck the Anglo-American deci
sion to rearm Germany without
French-inspired controls.
Mendes-France's victory became a
certainty last night when the So
cialist party, led by Guy Mollet, in
structed its 104 deputies to vote for
him on his promise to do his best to
obtain tighter integration of Allied
and German armies.
