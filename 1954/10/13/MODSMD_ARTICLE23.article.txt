WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 (UP) -
The administration is preparing a
detailed breakdown on its contro
versial new report showing that
1,743 federal employees resigned or
were fired for alleged subversive
connections, it was disclosed today.
Chairman Edward H. Rees (R.,
Kan.) of the House Civil Service
Committee said he asked the Civil
Service Commission for the break
down and set an Oct. 20 deadline
for its submission to his committee.
He said in a statement issued by
his office that the report will spell
out in detail the subversive activi
ties in which the former employees
allegedly were involved.
The report, issued yesterday,
stirred up a political storm. It. said
6,926 federal employees were fired
or resigned as "security risks" be
tween May 28. 1953, and last June 30.
It said the files of 1,743 of these
contained information indicating in
varying degree subversive activities,
membership in subversive organiza
tions, or subversive associations.
OEMOS CHARGE HOAX
Democrats charged (ho figures
were a "GOP hoax" designed to in
fluence the Nov. 2 Congressional
elections.
Republicans said the report
showed how well the administration
has been rooting out spies, subver
sives, and other "security" risk:,
from the government. The admin
istration's definition of security risk
includes those guilty or suspected of
sex deviation, past criminal activi
ties, habitual drunkenness, and "un
reliability."
Rees said the Civil Service Com -
mission breakdown will cover only
the 1,743 "subversive" list.
