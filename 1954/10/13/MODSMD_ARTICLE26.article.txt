## "I Had It In That Same Bag In 1948" The
						Measure of Democracy 
### 
The parade of hopeful candidates and po
litical luminaries currently passing through
Palo Alto and the Bay Area includes many of
the better known figures in state and national
life.
California Senator Thomas Kuchel and his
Democratic opponent Sam Yorty were both in
Palo Alto Tuesday. While Vice-President Rich
ard Nixon stumped the East Bay for the Re
publican candidates, gubernatorial candidate
Richard Graves addressed a Democratic din
ner in San Jose. And Saturday night Adlai
Stevenson, '52 presidential aspirant and titular
head of the Democratic party, will speak in
San Francisco.
This sudden influx of smiles and warm hand
shakes, gaudy campaign stickers and political
oratory, is the reflection of a situation some
what unusual for California. The Democratic
party has a full slate of candidates running in
the final election.
This is almost unique in California, home of
the cross-filing system and the incumbent Re
publican. Up until the state primaries last
June, the Democratic pony, although outnum
bering the Republican in registered voters,
seldom elected more than a hand_ful of candi
dates.
Candidates running in the primary election
had not been required to list party affiliation
on the ballot. As a result, the incumbent—as

the candidate whose name was best known—
usually won without difficulty.
The general party platforms to which the
other candidates subscribed were confused in
a haze of platitudes designed to win the vote
of both parties without committing the candi
date to any particular program.
This situation changed in June.
Cross-filing by candidates of both parties
was still allowed. But after each candidate's
name on the ballot appeared the abbreviation
"Rep." or "Dem."
Candidates were officially labeled by the
party to which they belonged, and the reaction
of the voters was definite. The primary elec
tion fulfilled its true purpose—the election of
candidates hem both parties to run in Novem
ber.
The advantages of the real functioning of the
two-party system to the voter is obvious. Can
didates can campaign on the issues that divide
them, rather than pussy-footing around and
discussing topics on which there is general
agreement. Voters have more time to size up
the two parties and the men who represent
them.
In the final analysis, votes should be cast for
the man rather than the party. But at last Cali
fornia has measured up to the test of democ
racy and allowed every opportunity for both
parties to be represented and their candidates
to be fairly heard.
