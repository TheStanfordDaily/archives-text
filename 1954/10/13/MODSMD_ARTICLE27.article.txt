# A 						Good idea

### 
Last spring the combined glee clubs of Harv
ard and Radcliffe sang in several concerts on
the West Coast, one at Stanford. The glee club
is a common institution at Eastern colleges and
universities and some of those who heard the
Harvard-Radcliffe group here asked them
selves "Why don't we have a glee club at Stan
ford?"
This fall, thanks to the effort of Harold
Schmidt of the Music Department and a few
interested students, Stanford is on its v/ay to
having a men's glee club.
Second tryout session for the group will be
held this afternoon at 4 in the Memorial Church
choir room. At last week's first meeting thirty

men tried out, and Schmidt and the glee club
officers hope to double this number. Men from
freshman to graduate may try out, and tenors
are especially needed.
Plans for the group indicate that the glee dlub
will perform several times each year for the
student body and make trips such as the Har
vard-Radcliffe tour. The value of a glee club—
a good glee club—to Stanford, in terms both
of entertainment and representation, is obvious.
Of course, a Stanford glee club is a new idea.
And new ideas often have trouble getting a
start. Bui certainly a glee club, promising real
interest to its members aijd real value to the
whole school, deserves at least a thorough trial.
