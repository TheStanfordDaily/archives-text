# 'Magnificent Obsession' Called Undistinguished Tear Jerker
## 
### TOM ARP 
The "Magnificent Obsession"
now playing at the Park is the
second Hollywood version of
the little melodramatic opus of
Lloyd C. Douglas.
The first one starred Merle Obe
ron, this one has Jane Wyinan, but
any way you slice it, it's typical Dr.
Douglas, and there's not much that
advanced film techniques can do for
it to make it any better than the
old black-and-white small screen
production. It gushes, and nothing
short of staying away will stanch it.
The stor>», or its moral, concerns
man's ability to tap the sources of
limitless spiritual power, and the
limitless emotional miracles that re
sult. Bock Hudson, not much of an
actor in cowboy melodramas, is no
better in faith-and-wonders melo
dramas. He is cast as a ne'er-do
well millionaire who is the indirect
cause of the death of a great Great
GREAT man.
PLOT THICKENS
The man happened to be not only
an eminent surgeon, but the hus
band of Jane Wyman. Mr. Hudson,
in an attempt to make it all up to
her, renders her blind, and is worse
off than ever. Only the intercession

I of an apostolic painter that the 1
dead doctor had saved from oblivion 1
j directs the boy to the worthy path. |
Once on it he is swept up in j
the magnificent obsession that has
! grabbed the whole cast, and every
thing works its miraculous way to
the very best end.
Mr. Hudson, as I've pointed out, is
no actor no matter what kind of a
picture he is appearing in. Miss
Wyman can, at times, come up with
something quite striking; this is not
one of her good days.* She relies a
little heavily on the heart-tearing
little mannerisms that won her such
acclaim for "Johnny Belinda" and
that dampest of tear-jerkers "The
Blue Veil." It is interesting to find
Agnes Moorehead in th cast, but she
is not particularly good either.
iIOBE' COMPARISON
In all, "Magnificent Obsession" is
right up there with Dr. Douglas'
other cinema triumph, "The Robe."
Neither film is distinguished by any
competent acting and—mostly be
cause of the stories themselves —
they both lack the guts that good
propaganda films must have.
Now it seems to me that Holly
wood is just trying to put one over
on us. We are dished up a little
vignette from Biblical history
("Samson and Delilah" or "David

and Bathsheba"), from neo-Blblical
faith conjurers ("Quo Vadis"), or
from an undistinguished literary
man with the idea of converting the
reading masses to the Good Life, and
because the story pretends to deal
with things sacred to many of us we
are not allowed to say the movie is
no good.
IDOLATERS BEWARE!
If we do sort of whisper it to
someone, lo! we are immediately
spotted for a mob of idolatrous cyn
ics.
It is my humble opinion that any
one who sees that these are bad
movies ought to say so, because if
there is any irreverence involved in
the situation it rests with someone
in a plushy office who decides that
it might not hurt his income any to
do a nice technicolor spectacle about,
say, the Book of Ruth—interesting
story, sex angle, maybe even a tear
or two in it. Or we might do up the
Salome story, with a twist — have
Salome dance to save John the Bap
tist; but then that's already been |
done, hasn't it?

one who sees that these are bad
movies ought to say so, because if
there is any irreverence involved in
the situation it rests with someone
in a plushy office who decides that
it might not hurt his income any to
do a nice technicolor spectacle about,
say, the Book of Ruth—interesting
story, sex angle, maybe even a tear
or two in it. Or we might do up the
Salome story, with a twist — have
Salome dance to save John the Bap
tist; but then that's already been |
done, hasn't it?
The "Magnificent Obsession"
now playing at the Park is the
second Hollywood version of
the little melodramatic opus of
Lloyd C. Douglas.
The first one starred Merle Obe
ron, this one has Jane Wyinan, but
any way you slice it, it's typical Dr.
Douglas, and there's not much that
advanced film techniques can do for
it to make it any better than the
old black-and-white small screen
production. It gushes, and nothing
short of staying away will stanch it.
The stor>», or its moral, concerns
man's ability to tap the sources of
limitless spiritual power, and the
limitless emotional miracles that re
sult. Bock Hudson, not much of an
actor in cowboy melodramas, is no
better in faith-and-wonders melo
dramas. He is cast as a ne'er-do
well millionaire who is the indirect
cause of the death of a great Great
GREAT man.
PLOT THICKENS
The man happened to be not only
an eminent surgeon, but the hus
band of Jane Wyman. Mr. Hudson,
in an attempt to make it all up to
her, renders her blind, and is worse
off than ever. Only the intercession

I of an apostolic painter that the 1
dead doctor had saved from oblivion 1
j directs the boy to the worthy path. |
Once on it he is swept up in j
the magnificent obsession that has
! grabbed the whole cast, and every
thing works its miraculous way to
the very best end.
Mr. Hudson, as I've pointed out, is
no actor no matter what kind of a
picture he is appearing in. Miss
Wyman can, at times, come up with
something quite striking; this is not
one of her good days.* She relies a
little heavily on the heart-tearing
little mannerisms that won her such
acclaim for "Johnny Belinda" and
that dampest of tear-jerkers "The
Blue Veil." It is interesting to find
Agnes Moorehead in th cast, but she
is not particularly good either.
iIOBE' COMPARISON
In all, "Magnificent Obsession" is
right up there with Dr. Douglas'
other cinema triumph, "The Robe."
Neither film is distinguished by any
competent acting and—mostly be
cause of the stories themselves —
they both lack the guts that good
propaganda films must have.
Now it seems to me that Holly
wood is just trying to put one over
on us. We are dished up a little
vignette from Biblical history
("Samson and Delilah" or "David

and Bathsheba"), from neo-Blblical
faith conjurers ("Quo Vadis"), or
from an undistinguished literary
man with the idea of converting the
reading masses to the Good Life, and
because the story pretends to deal
with things sacred to many of us we
are not allowed to say the movie is
no good.
IDOLATERS BEWARE!
If we do sort of whisper it to
someone, lo! we are immediately
spotted for a mob of idolatrous cyn
ics.
