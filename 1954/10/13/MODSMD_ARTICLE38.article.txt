# Phi Kaps Pass for Easy Victory Over Alpha Sigs
## 
### MIKE MeGINNIS 
An aerial Phi Kap eleven showed
sharp passing offense and good de
fensive play yesterday as they
bowled over the Alpha Sigs 20-0 in
the second day of intramural foot
ball.
The victors intercepted a pass in
the opening minutes of the game and
immediately scored on an aerial
from Dick Shea to Daryl Snyder.
The first half saw heavy scoring as
Shea connected with Jack Wilson
and Ed Askey for two more touch
downs.
Fast broken-field running by Al
pha Sig quarterback Sherman Kel
ler carried the team to the midfield
stripe once, but the drive died there.
The ball changed hands often
throughout the game. There were
eight interceptions.
