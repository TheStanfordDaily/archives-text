# IFC Alters Functions Of Its Judicial Committee
## 
### 
The Interfraternity Council made an important change in its
disciplinary procedure by altering the functions of the judicial
committee at the council's first meeting of the year last night.
Under the new set-up, the judiciary committee will be a four
man group with fact-finding powers only. Previously the com-

mittee had nine members and made
penalty recommendations for gen
eral council action.
Now responsibility for interpret
ing the facts in all cases will rest in
itially and exclusively with the en
tire IFC.
The other important item on the
agenda was an outline of the prob

lems to be decided before formulat
ing a rushing schedule for next win
ter quarter, presented by Steve
Horrell, Zcte, chairman of the rush
ing committee.
Plans discussed last year for
switching the rushing period to
spring quarter were permanently
dropped.
Rushing during the Christmas
holidays, which was discontinued
last year, is a major phase of the
rushing program which will be dis
cussed next week.
Other questions which must be
decided include when open houses
will begin, how many there will be,
and how they will be organized;
when formal rushing should begin
and end; and how to improve the
pledge night ceremonies.
President Otis Winters, Alpha
Delt, opened the meeting by say
ing, "This year is an important step
for this council. The opportunity is
here to take a great step forward.
Instead of a single project, this year
we will attempt several."
Included in the projects are plans
for an all-fraternity formal dance
in San Francisco winter quarter ai/l
methods for improving scholarship
in the bouses.
