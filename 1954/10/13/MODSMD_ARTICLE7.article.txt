# Yorty Challenges Knchel To Campaign Issue Debate
## 
### RUTH WOLPE 
"I intend to continue to try to force (Senator Thomas H. Kuchel)
to come out into the open and publicly debate the issues of this
campaign. His failure to do so is a form of political cowardice
which disqualifies him for the office lo which he has been ap
pointed end now seeks to hold by election."

This statement was made Monday*
night by Congressman Sam Yorty,
Democratic nominee for U.S. Sena
tor, to an informal gathering of
Stanford's first, precinct at the home
of Political Science Professor Alfred
de Grazia.
Yorty challenged Kuchel to state
his position on the Watkins commit
tee recommendation to consume Mc-
Carthy. "If I were Senator," he said,
"I would vote for censure. I have
complete confidence in the capabili
ties and impartiality of the Watkins
committee."
According to the Democratic nom
inee, Kuchel cannot vote impartially
on this issue because McCarthy
twice lias come to California to cam
paign for his re-election.
CITES KUCIIEL TELEGRAM
McCarthy received "a warm tele
gram of thanks from Tom Kuchel"
after his first visit," Yorty said. "By
last August, however. McCarthy was
in serious trouble in the Senate, and
when he returned to California for
a fund-raising dinner at San Diego,
Kuchel 'ducked out' on his friend,
refusing to pose for pictures. Ku
chel did, however, accept his share
of the $50,000 in campaign money
which resulted from the dinner!"
Continuing his charges against
Kuchel, Yorty said that silence is

â™¦
the junior Senator's answer to Yor
ty's challenge that both open their
war records to public inspection.
"For this lie called me a 'scoundrel'
while evidently considering himself
a statesman in mailing a post-dated,
last-minute 'smear' against me which
among other frauds featured a
croppcd composite photograph of
Kuchel and President Eisenhower,"
the Congressman told his audience.
"He has never even tried to ex
plain this brazen attempt to fool the
voters and distort my long record of
vigorous action against all types of
subversives, whether Nazis, Com
munists, Ku Kluxers, or Gerald L.
K. Smithers," he stated.
HITS PARTISAN PRESS
Yorty sairl that his opponent was
hiding in back of paid propagandists
and writers. "Kuchel expects to lit
erally sneak into the Senate under
the protective cloak of a partisan
press and huge campaign expendi
tures."
The Congressman said that he
would not want to have to defend
many of the bills passed by the last
Congress. "I don't, think we ought to
become a nation of corporations,"
Yorty said. "The present tax bill
discriminates against indivduals and
favors corporatons."
