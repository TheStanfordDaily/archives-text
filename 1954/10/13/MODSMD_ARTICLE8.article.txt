*At no time should motorcycles
or motor scooters be driven be
tween the closed corners of the
quad," Police Chief Gordon Davis
has announced.
"Those vehicles are subject to
the same rules and regulations as
automobiles. They are noisy and
disturb classes," Davis stated.
He added that motorcycles and
motorbikes are not considered in
the same classification as bicycles,
which are permitted in the closed
area.
