# Corp Yard Man Trapped Seeking Defunct Feline
## 
### 
The Faculty Men's Clubhouse became the scene of excitement
yesterday morning when Dave Callahan, 23, a corporation yard
worker, was trapped for almost an hour under the floor beams.
He was caught when he tried to extricate a dead cat which had
been odorizing the premises.
Callahan, who lives at 258 Palo Alto Avenue in Mountain View,

was treated at Palo Alto Hospital foH
shock, minor cuts and bruises, apd
possible chest injuries.
A fire truck was dispatched to the
scene at 8:50 a.m. after a call had
been sent in by Frank Luce, pro
prietor of the Encina Barber Shop.
Luce had been previously hailed on
Pine Avenue by Callahan's co-work -
er, Steve Aquiliano.
According to Aquiliano, Callahan
went in to get the cat at about 8:30
and a few minutes later became
stuck under a beam five feet from
the edge of the building. Aquiliano
tried to pull him out with no success
and then went out to the road to get
help.
When the fire truck arrived, the
redwood siding of the Clubhouse
was torn down to make the rescue
operations easier. One group of fire
men then began work on jacking up
the beam, while another group tore
up the floorboards.
A few minutes later when the
beam had been successfully raised,
Callahan was worked loose and
slowly pulled outside. Breathing
very hard and in a state of shock, he
was immediately given respirator
treatment and then removed by am
bulance to the hospital.
