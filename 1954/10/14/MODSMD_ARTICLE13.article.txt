MIAMI, Oct. 13 (UP) â€”Hurricane
Hazel, still a killer after devastating
two cities in Haiti with a possible
huge death toll, regenerated its 100-
miles-an-hour fury in the Bahamas
tonight and began an ominous shift
toward the northwest .
If the vicious storm continued its
northwesterly swing it might, rage
through the central Bahamas and
bring the south Atlantic seaboard of
the United States within its destruc
tive orbit.
The hurricane had caused huge
destruction in Jeremie and Aux
Cayes, Haiti, sweeping buildings
with their occupants into the sea
and dealing a heavy death toll, mes
sages from the stricken island re
public said.
Only 20 houses and two business
buildings were observed still stand
ing in Jeremie, a city of 20,000, by
relief parties who reached the hill
tops overlooking the city. Many
were killed or injured and thousands
left homeless in Aux Cayes, the re
ports said.
The carrier Saipan with 12 heli
copters started rescue and relief op
erations today.
At 5 p.m., the Miami Weather Bu
reau reported, the storm was rapidly
rebuilding its power and weather
planes found winds just below 100
miles an hour in its northeasf quad
rant. Earlier the wind strength had
dwindled to 75 miles an hour. Its
latest position was put at midway
between Mayaguana and Acklin is
lands which lie about 30 miles apart
roughly 150 miles north of Haiti.
