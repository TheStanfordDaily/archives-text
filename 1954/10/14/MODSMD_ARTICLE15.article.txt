# EXCOM:
## New Honor Code Program Adopted 
### RUSS WILKS Associate Editor, The Daily 
The Executive Committee of the ASSU approved and adopted
a special Honor Code Education program submitted by its Honor
Code subcommittee in its meeting last night.
Among the highlights of the evening were a National Students
Association report by A 1 Loomis, the passage of a motion to sell

a sports sampler book, and the clari
fication in the constitution of the
fact that the Graduate Student As
sociation is recognized as a class like
the freshman, sophomore, junior and
senior classes.
Excom went into executive session
at 10:30 to discuss the Axe Society.
Ann Irvine and Kathy Padgett pre
sented the Honor Code subcommittee
report. They reviewed the recom
mendations that were made by Ex
com last May and elaborated on what
had been done in these areas. The
result was a wide scale program of
close student and faculty cooperation
to alleviate the trouble areas.
COMMITTEE SET UP
The special Honor Code Education
Committee is to be set up under the
dual jurisdiction of Excom and the
Fundamental Standard Committee.
The chairman of the Honor Code
Education Committee will be a mem
ber of both Excom and Fun Stan
Com, but the co-ordinator will not
be a member of either committee.
Three groups will be established
under the Honor Code Education
Committee. They will be the Stu
dent-Faculty Education Orientation,
Student. Education Problems, and
Problem Study and Control. A big
ger organization will be a direct out
growth of the third committee to in
clude individuals from each living
area to help work on the over-all
honor code agenda.
Miss Irvine hoped the organization
of the staff would be completed by
the end of this quarter and that the
committee work would get under
way by winter quarter. She said,
"The project will entail many people,
but it can be handled. The more
people you have involved the more
inspiration there will be in it."
NSA REPORT
A 1 Loomis, NSA co-ordinator, re
ported that the total expenditure for
the year was $1,026.64. The btdk of
the money went for traveling ex
penses to the various conferences. He
foresaw that figure as being "about
what the yearly expense should be."
He also reported that the next
NSA meeting would be Oct. 21 at
California and would include a dis
cussion of election procedure, which
would also include problems like
getting out the vote.
Several members of Excom queried
whether the general student actually
knew what NSA was doing. A mo
tion was passed stating that if Ex
com decided to remain in NSA for
1954-55 that an educational program
would be undertaken to send the
delegates, who attended the National
NSA Conference this past summer,
to the various living groups to ex
plain the organization and answer
questions.
Excom directed Student Manager
Bob Gable and the Social Co-ordin
ating Board to take care of prepara
tions for the selling of the Research
Institute's sports sampler book on
campus. The book includes passes
to sporting events, movies, horse
shows, supper club entertainment,
etc. Gable said the book, valued at
$79.35, would sell for $4.
The Graduate Students recognized
as a class are eligible to have their
elections on ASSU ballots.
