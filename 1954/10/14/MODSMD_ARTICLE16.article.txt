ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Oct. 13
(UP) â€”The Democrats appeared to
night to have overwhelmingly swept
the Alaska general election, which is
considered a reliable barometer of
how the nation will go in November
Of the 35 territorial and legisla
tive positions on the ballots, the
Democrats were leading in 32, in
cluding the U.S. Congress delegate's
position and the territory treasurer.
Returns from 123 of the territory's
2fi2 precincts showed Republicans,
firmly entrenched for the past, two
years, were being crushed out of
power.
Democrats appeared to have swept
all eight Senate seats up for re-elec
tion and 22 of the 24 House seats.
