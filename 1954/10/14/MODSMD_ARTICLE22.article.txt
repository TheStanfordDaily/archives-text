## Whose Political Union? 
### 
The first anniversary of the founding of an
organization is an opportune time at which to
review its accomplishments and re-evaluate
its original aims.
It was one year ago tomorrow that Stanford
cautiously lifted its veil of political indiffer
ence and silence by holding the first meeting
of the Stanford Political Union.
The expressed purpose of the group was "to
present a varied program of education on po
litical issues and to give students an opportun
ity to study, make their own decisions, and ex
press their own opinions on these issues."
"The Political Union would also endeavor,"
so the announcement said, "to bring compe
tent speakers to the campus."
Under the bylaws established for the Union,
the guest speaker would talk for 45 minutes,
followed by a student who would speak in op
position for 15 minutes. Next there would be a
questioning period in which the entire audi
ence could participate.
Finally there was to be student debate be
tween three privileged speakers from each
Union group—Republican, Democratic, and In
dependent—with a hand vote taken at the end
of the meeting on the resolution under con
sideration.
In actual practice this procedure has not been
followed.
At the first few meetings the guest speaker
was followed by students from the three party
groups. The floor debate degenerated into a
disorganized, unprepared squabble between a
very few participants.
This unhappy result prompted suggestions
that student debate on the resolution be elim
inated or drastically curtailed, with the primary
emphasis on the guest speaker.
Although the student speaker idea was never
formally dropped, the meetings gradually be
came the forum of visiting politicians, with a
prolonged question and ansv/er period replac
ing any organized debate or rebuttal.
By the end of spring quarter the Political
Union could claim a fairly impressive list of
Republicans and Democrats who had spoken
in Cubberley. The values of their contribution
to the political consciousness at Stanford is un
questioned.
But we wonder what has happened to the
primary objective of the Political Union—the
opportunity for students to study, make de
cisions, and express themselves on political
issues.
We strongly object to the attitude expressed

by some members on the Political Union ex
ecutive committee that there are no students at
Stanford capable of delivering an intelligent,
15 minute rebuttal to the guest speaker. We
object to the assumption that student debates
must necessarily be poorly organized and
executed. We object to turning the Political
Union into a political Tuesday Evening Series.
To the numerous ideas and suggestions for
change currently being discussed by the Po
litical Union executive committee, we would
like to add the following:
That seating at the meetings be arranged
according to strict party lines, with areas
marked off for Republicans, Democrats, Inde
pendents, and observers. This would help pro
mote cohesiveness within the parties which is
now missing at the large Union meetings.
That guest speakers be asked to talk on a
topic of specific interest to students here, rather
than leaving the subject matter up to them.
This would make student rebuttal far easier
if the topic were, for example, "The Loyalty
Oath in California," rather than "Problems of
Soil Conservation."
That the student chosen to follow the main
speaker have some experience in public
speaking and a sound knowledge of the sub
ject under discussion.
That just one privileged speaker be chosen
from each of the three Union parties, and that
these three individuals be seated on the speak
er's platform or at a special table in front of the
auditorium. These three would each speak for
five minutes and have an opportunity for re
buttal.
That the three party groups be informed far
enough in advance of the specific topic which
will be discussed in order to allow their privi
leged speaker time for study and research.
That students who are already active in de
bating or speech association activities be en
couraged to participate in the Political Union.
That there be more emphasis placed on the
general student debating of issues and less em
phasis on the guest speaker as the focal point
for the whole meeting.
The Political Union has much to offer. By
presenting men active in public life and their
ideas on specific issues, it brings the outside
world to Stanford. By allowing the Stanford
student to express his own opinions on these
same issues, it can provide a sounding-board
for the ideas which may someday direct the
world.

according to strict party lines, with areas
marked off for Republicans, Democrats, Inde
pendents, and observers. This would help pro
mote cohesiveness within the parties which is
now missing at the large Union meetings.
That guest speakers be asked to talk on a
topic of specific interest to students here, rather
than leaving the subject matter up to them.
This would make student rebuttal far easier
if the topic were, for example, "The Loyalty
Oath in California," rather than "Problems of
Soil Conservation."
That the student chosen to follow the main
speaker have some experience in public
speaking and a sound knowledge of the sub
ject under discussion.
That just one privileged speaker be chosen
from each of the three Union parties, and that
these three individuals be seated on the speak
er's platform or at a special table in front of the
auditorium. These three would each speak for
five minutes and have an opportunity for re
buttal.
That the three party groups be informed far
enough in advance of the specific topic which
will be discussed in order to allow their privi
leged speaker time for study and research.
That students who are already active in de
bating or speech association activities be en
couraged to participate in the Political Union.
That there be more emphasis placed on the
general student debating of issues and less em
phasis on the guest speaker as the focal point
for the whole meeting.
The Political Union has much to offer. By
presenting men active in public life and their
ideas on specific issues, it brings the outside
world to Stanford. By allowing the Stanford
student to express his own opinions on these
same issues, it can provide a sounding-board
for the ideas which may someday direct the
world.

The first anniversary of the founding of an
organization is an opportune time at which to
review its accomplishments and re-evaluate
its original aims.
It was one year ago tomorrow that Stanford
cautiously lifted its veil of political indiffer
ence and silence by holding the first meeting
of the Stanford Political Union.
The expressed purpose of the group was "to
present a varied program of education on po
litical issues and to give students an opportun
ity to study, make their own decisions, and ex
press their own opinions on these issues."
"The Political Union would also endeavor,"
so the announcement said, "to bring compe
tent speakers to the campus."
Under the bylaws established for the Union,
the guest speaker would talk for 45 minutes,
followed by a student who would speak in op
position for 15 minutes. Next there would be a
questioning period in which the entire audi
ence could participate.
Finally there was to be student debate be
tween three privileged speakers from each
Union group—Republican, Democratic, and In
dependent—with a hand vote taken at the end
of the meeting on the resolution under con
sideration.
In actual practice this procedure has not been
followed.
At the first few meetings the guest speaker
was followed by students from the three party
groups. The floor debate degenerated into a
disorganized, unprepared squabble between a
very few participants.
This unhappy result prompted suggestions
that student debate on the resolution be elim
inated or drastically curtailed, with the primary
emphasis on the guest speaker.
Although the student speaker idea was never
formally dropped, the meetings gradually be
came the forum of visiting politicians, with a
prolonged question and ansv/er period replac
ing any organized debate or rebuttal.
By the end of spring quarter the Political
Union could claim a fairly impressive list of
Republicans and Democrats who had spoken
in Cubberley. The values of their contribution
to the political consciousness at Stanford is un
questioned.
But we wonder what has happened to the
primary objective of the Political Union—the
opportunity for students to study, make de
cisions, and express themselves on political
issues.
We strongly object to the attitude expressed

by some members on the Political Union ex
ecutive committee that there are no students at
Stanford capable of delivering an intelligent,
15 minute rebuttal to the guest speaker. We
object to the assumption that student debates
must necessarily be poorly organized and
executed. We object to turning the Political
Union into a political Tuesday Evening Series.
To the numerous ideas and suggestions for
change currently being discussed by the Po
litical Union executive committee, we would
like to add the following:
