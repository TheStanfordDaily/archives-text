# Austria Called 'European-Minded, But Friendly Toward United States'
## Diplomat Favors German Rearming 
### GERRY SMITH 
• "Our country is very Euro
pean - minded," Karl Gruber,
Austrian ambassador to the
United States, commented at an
interview in Hoover Library
early yesterday afternoon. He
was accompanied by Karl C.
Weber, Austrian consul-general
in San Francisco.
"We do not seek to preserve our
own state and to achieve our own
narrow aims. The students in our
universities are the standard bear
ers of the unifying movement and
often criticize the government for
not contributing enough to Euro
pean unity."
Gruber, who is giving a series of
talks in the West designed to build
up public opinion on the Austrian
question, said that his country is
especially interested in "getting oc
cupying troops out of Austria, main
ly the Russians. The others are
ready to go, as they have declared
repeatedly, but as long as the Rus
sians are there, the others must stay.
"Even in Vienna, though, it is hard
to know which sector you are in.
This is very different from Ger
many."
FAVORS GERMAN ARMS
Concerning German rearmament,
Gruber remarked, "I think it is a
good thing. Germany is a great
power and should have arms. France
has been forced to make concessions,
but that is for the best. Yes, it can
be a good thing if it does become
implemented."
Feeling toward the United States
is friendly in Austria, according to
Gruber. "We welcome American
students, and almost one-third of the
population ypeaks English. The tra
ditional German of the schools has
been replaced by English in some of

the classes. Certain summer schools
are conducted entirely in English.
American troops have paid their
own costs for a long while and take
no part in civil affairs."
As Austrian foreign minister just
after World War 11, Gruber attended
the Paris peace conference in 1946 as
a participating member. "The Aus
trian delegation was given 10 seats
at the conference," Gruber reflected.
"We had not enough people in Paris
to fill the seats, so we had to call
our women to come in and sit be
side us."
TREATY IIAKI) FIGHT'
"Here is my basic philosophy con
cerning the Austrian peace settle
ment," he continued. "We had a
hard fight to get what we wanted
into the treaty. Italy has a highly
developed bureaucratic democracy
which, although it does a lot of good,
is hard to handle. They lived up to
a part of the agreement, but there
had to be constant maneuvering to
keep it intact. However, the origi
nal character of the agreement was
preserved."
Gruber believes that Austria's part
in the future of Europe will be a

large one. "Vienna has always been
an intellectual center, and we are in
very good economic shape. We are a
nation with a long history of work
ing together. Our youth are train
ing for and building the spirit of
European unification."
EDC AND UNITY
Gruber's general opinion of the
EDC rejection was that it constitutes
no real threat to European unity.
He felt that Mendes-France served a
great purpose in defeating the meas
ure, and that Eden was right in
proposing a ' new system with
"checks and balances—much better."
In conclusion, Gruber, who for
merly taught national economy in
the University of Vienna, observed,
"You have a very fine campus here
and I admire it. If I could be a stu
dent again, I would certainly come
here for a year or more."

has been forced to make concessions,
but that is for the best. Yes, it can
be a good thing if it does become
implemented."
Feeling toward the United States
is friendly in Austria, according to
Gruber. "We welcome American
students, and almost one-third of the
population ypeaks English. The tra
ditional German of the schools has
been replaced by English in some of

the classes. Certain summer schools
are conducted entirely in English.
American troops have paid their
own costs for a long while and take
no part in civil affairs."
As Austrian foreign minister just
after World War 11, Gruber attended
the Paris peace conference in 1946 as
a participating member. "The Aus
trian delegation was given 10 seats
at the conference," Gruber reflected.
"We had not enough people in Paris
to fill the seats, so we had to call
our women to come in and sit be
side us."
TREATY IIAKI) FIGHT'
"Here is my basic philosophy con
cerning the Austrian peace settle
ment," he continued. "We had a
hard fight to get what we wanted
into the treaty. Italy has a highly
developed bureaucratic democracy
which, although it does a lot of good,
is hard to handle. They lived up to
a part of the agreement, but there
had to be constant maneuvering to
keep it intact. However, the origi
nal character of the agreement was
preserved."
Gruber believes that Austria's part
in the future of Europe will be a

large one. "Vienna has always been
an intellectual center, and we are in
very good economic shape. We are a
nation with a long history of work
ing together. Our youth are train
ing for and building the spirit of
European unification."
EDC AND UNITY
Gruber's general opinion of the
EDC rejection was that it constitutes
no real threat to European unity.
He felt that Mendes-France served a
great purpose in defeating the meas
ure, and that Eden was right in
proposing a ' new system with
"checks and balances—much better."
In conclusion, Gruber, who for
merly taught national economy in
the University of Vienna, observed,
"You have a very fine campus here
and I admire it. If I could be a stu
dent again, I would certainly come
here for a year or more."

• "Our country is very Euro
pean - minded," Karl Gruber,
Austrian ambassador to the
United States, commented at an
interview in Hoover Library
early yesterday afternoon. He
was accompanied by Karl C.
Weber, Austrian consul-general
in San Francisco.
"We do not seek to preserve our
own state and to achieve our own
narrow aims. The students in our
universities are the standard bear
ers of the unifying movement and
often criticize the government for
not contributing enough to Euro
pean unity."
Gruber, who is giving a series of
talks in the West designed to build
up public opinion on the Austrian
question, said that his country is
especially interested in "getting oc
cupying troops out of Austria, main
ly the Russians. The others are
ready to go, as they have declared
repeatedly, but as long as the Rus
sians are there, the others must stay.
"Even in Vienna, though, it is hard
to know which sector you are in.
This is very different from Ger
many."
FAVORS GERMAN ARMS
Concerning German rearmament,
Gruber remarked, "I think it is a
good thing. Germany is a great
power and should have arms. France
has been forced to make concessions,
but that is for the best. Yes, it can
be a good thing if it does become
