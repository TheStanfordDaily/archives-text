Theta Xi edged out the Biz School
I, 7-0, in intramural football yester
day afternoon. The only touchdown
of the same came in the first half
when Theta Xi's Tom Gillett inter

School's 21 yard line and ran it
back into the end zone for the
score. Dick Woodward scored an ex
tra point on a pass from Gillett.
Theta Xi put together the only
sustained drive of the game on their
first series of plays. From the Theta
Xi .'!() yard line, Gillett ran to the
Biz School 35. Gillett then complet
ed three passes in succession. He
threw to Woodward on the 15, to Ed
Abram on the 9, and again to Abram
on the 2, but Biz School stopped the
drive here by throwing Gillett for
a seven yard loss on fourth down.
Biz School threatened to tie the
score late in the game when Far
ms intercepted a Gillett pass on

the Theta Xi .'IH. On the next play,
Farriss passed to Ahem who lat
eralled to Homer Franklin. Frank
lin raced down (he sideline to a
first down on the 18 yard line.
The Theta Xi defense stiffened
here, however, and Biz School gave
lip the hall on the 15.
Theta Xi picked up one first down
but was then forced to punt. The
game ended with Biz School throw
ing long desperation passes in a last
ditch effort to tie the score.
