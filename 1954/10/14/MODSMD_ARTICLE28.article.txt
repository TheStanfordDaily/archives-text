# Jim McCamant to Miss UCLA Clash
## 
### 
Jim McCamant, who has b&?n al
ternating at first-string end, was lost
to the Stanford grids yesterday just
three days before Saturday's im
portant PCC encounter with UCLA
in the Coliseum Saturday.
McCamant twisted a previously
injured ankle during punt practice,
which opened yesterday's session.
All the other Cards receiving
treatment from trainer Connie Jar
vis are progressing as expected and
will be ready for action against the
Bruins. Players who have been
slowed up during the week with
bruises include Tony Mosich with a
sore ankle, John Brodie also with a
banged-up ankle, Gordy Young with
a foot infection, Steve Docter with a

cracked rib, and John Stewart with
a slight touch of the flu.
Coach Chuck Taylor continues to
indicate that Brodie will get the
starting call at quarterback despite
the gimpy ankle and Jerry Gustaf
son's steady improvement.
The Indians drilled again on pass
ing yesterday—with a good bit more
success than previously — which
seemed to furnish proof that Stan
ford may take to the air against
the rugged Bruin defenders.
Down in Westwood the self-same
rugged Bruins were cheered by the
improvement of the many Uclans
who had been hobbled with game

wounds. All of Red Sanders' re
venge-seeking crew will be able to
play except right tackle Joe Hay.
Second - stringer Gil Moreno or
guard Hardiman Cureton will fill the
gap for Ray.
Other Bruins who have been hurt
include blocking back Terry Debay,
guard Sam Boghosian, wingbacks
Jack Hermann and Jim Decker, and
center John Peterson.


BEWARE INJUNS! — Jim Salsbury, the hard-charging gent
above, has been known to spend considerable time in the oppo
sition's backfield. A guard, Salsbury is gunning to
make his last season an All-American one, and boosted that
hope by getting All-Coast mention last year.


BRUIN MAINSTAY —Pictured here is Terry Debay, UCLA quar
terback and one of Coach Red Sanders' mainstays. A three-year
letterman, Debay is the blocking member of the Bruin backfield.
He is 21, hails from Canoga Park, California, and scales 181 lbs.
and 5 ft. 11 in.
