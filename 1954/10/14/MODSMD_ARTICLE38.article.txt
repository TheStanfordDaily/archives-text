MY COUSIN HASKELL

1 have a cousin named Haskell Krovney, a sweet, unspoiled country
boy, who has just started college. A letter arrived from him this
morning which I will reprint here because I know that Haskell's
problems are so much like your own. Haskell writes:
Dear Haskell (he thinks my name is Haskell too),
I see that you are writing a column for Philip Morris cigarettes.
I think they are keen cigarettes which taste real good and which
make a pleasant noise when you open the pack, and I want to tell
you why I don't smoke them.
It all started the very first day I arrived at collegc. I had just
gotten off the train and was walking across the campus, swinging
my cardboard valise whistling snatches of Valencia, Barney Google,
and other latest tunes, admiring statues, petting dogs and girls, when
all of a sudden I ran into this fellow with a blue jacket, gray pants,
and white teeth. He asked me was I a freshman. I said yes. He asked
me did I want to go places on campus, make a big name for myself,
and get pointed at in fashionable ballrooms and spas. I said yes. He
said the only way to make all these keen things happen was to
join a fraternity. Fortunately he happened to have a pledge card
on him, so he pricked my thumb and I signed. He didn't tell me the
name of the fraternity or where it is located, but I suppose I'll find
lout when I go active.
' Meanwhile this fellow comes around every week and collects his
dues which are $100. Lately he has been collecting $10 extra each
week. He says this is a fine because T missed the meeting. When I
'remind him that I can't go to meetings because I don't know where
the house is, he twists my arm.
I have never regretted joining the fraternity because it is my
dearest wish to be somebody on campus and get pointed at in spas,
but you can see that it isn't cheap. It wouldn't be so bad if I slept
at the house, but you must agree that I can't very well sleep at
the house if I don't know where the house is.
I have had to rent a room. This room is not only hellishly expensive,'
but it isn't the kind of room I wanted at all. What I was looking for
was someplace reasonably priced, clean, comfortable, and within easy
walking distance of classes, the downtown shopping district, the
movies, and my home town. What I found was a bedroom in the
home of a local costcrmonger, which is dingy, expensive, uncom
; fortable, inconvenient, and I don't even get to use the bed till six
o'clock in the morning when my Landlord goes off to mong his costers.
Well, anyhow, 1 jrot settled and started going to classes. But first
1 had to pay my tuition. This came to a good deal more than the
advertised rates. When I asked the bursar what the extra money
was for, he told me lab fees. When I said I wasn't taking any labs,
he said I was taking psychology which counted as a lab because
they used white mice. When I offered to bring my own mice, of
which there are plenty in my room, he twisted my arm.
So I paid the man and. went to my classes where I found that
fill my professors had spent busy summers writing brand new text
books. Over to the bookstore I went, saw the prices on the text
books, and collapsed in a gibbering heap. At length I recovered and
made indignant demands to speak to the proprietor, but they told
me the Brinks truck had already taken him home for the day. There
was nothing for it but to buy the books.
i
Next I turned to romance—and found it. Harriet, her name was—a
great, strapping girl. I first spied her leaning against the statue of
the Founder, dozing lightly. I talked to her for several hours without
effect. Only when I mentioned dinner did she stir. Her milky little
ryes opened, she raised a heavy arm, seized my nape, and dragged
me ofT to a dimly lit placo called The Trap where everything was
n la carte. She ordered cracked crab ($1.75), sirloin Chateaubriand
($7.00), a scuttle of french fries (18<* the french fry), an artichoke
(oOif the leaf), and compote (80tf the prune).
After dinner she lapsed into a torpor from which I could not rouse
her, no matter how I tried. I banged my glass with my fork. I did
bird calls of North and South America. I pinched her huge pendulous
jowl. I rubbed the legs of my corduroy pants together ... But nothing
worked, and finally I had to sling l her over my shoulder and carry
her to the prirls dormitory, to the vast amusement of everybody
along the route.
But it was not the jeers of bystanders that bothered me. It was
the hernia. I 1 ortunately, medical care for students is provided free
at the college dispensary; all I had to pay for were a few extras,
like X-rays, anaesthesia, operating room, forceps, hemostats, scal
pels, sponges, catgut, linens, towels, amortization, and nurses. They
would not, however, let me keep the nurses.
So, dear, cousin, if you see me these days without a Philip Morris
cigarette, it is not because I don't like Philip Morris cigarettes. I
do. I flip when I taste their mild rare vintage tobaccos. Rut I can't
afford cigarettes. I can'f even afford matches, what with fraternity
dues and room rent and lab fees and textbook prices and my girl
Harriet and medical rare.
• Well, I'll write you again soon. Keep 'em flying.

great, strapping girl. I first spied her leaning against the statue of
the Founder, dozing lightly. I talked to her for several hours without
effect. Only when I mentioned dinner did she stir. Her milky little
ryes opened, she raised a heavy arm, seized my nape, and dragged
me ofT to a dimly lit placo called The Trap where everything was
n la carte. She ordered cracked crab ($1.75), sirloin Chateaubriand
($7.00), a scuttle of french fries (18<* the french fry), an artichoke
(oOif the leaf), and compote (80tf the prune).
After dinner she lapsed into a torpor from which I could not rouse
her, no matter how I tried. I banged my glass with my fork. I did
bird calls of North and South America. I pinched her huge pendulous
jowl. I rubbed the legs of my corduroy pants together ... But nothing
worked, and finally I had to sling l her over my shoulder and carry
her to the prirls dormitory, to the vast amusement of everybody
along the route.
But it was not the jeers of bystanders that bothered me. It was
the hernia. I 1 ortunately, medical care for students is provided free
at the college dispensary; all I had to pay for were a few extras,
like X-rays, anaesthesia, operating room, forceps, hemostats, scal
pels, sponges, catgut, linens, towels, amortization, and nurses. They
would not, however, let me keep the nurses.
So, dear, cousin, if you see me these days without a Philip Morris
cigarette, it is not because I don't like Philip Morris cigarettes. I
do. I flip when I taste their mild rare vintage tobaccos. Rut I can't
afford cigarettes. I can'f even afford matches, what with fraternity
dues and room rent and lab fees and textbook prices and my girl
Harriet and medical rare.

MY COUSIN HASKELL

1 have a cousin named Haskell Krovney, a sweet, unspoiled country
boy, who has just started college. A letter arrived from him this
morning which I will reprint here because I know that Haskell's
problems are so much like your own. Haskell writes:
Dear Haskell (he thinks my name is Haskell too),
I see that you are writing a column for Philip Morris cigarettes.
I think they are keen cigarettes which taste real good and which
make a pleasant noise when you open the pack, and I want to tell
you why I don't smoke them.
It all started the very first day I arrived at collegc. I had just
gotten off the train and was walking across the campus, swinging
my cardboard valise whistling snatches of Valencia, Barney Google,
and other latest tunes, admiring statues, petting dogs and girls, when
all of a sudden I ran into this fellow with a blue jacket, gray pants,
and white teeth. He asked me was I a freshman. I said yes. He asked
me did I want to go places on campus, make a big name for myself,
and get pointed at in fashionable ballrooms and spas. I said yes. He
said the only way to make all these keen things happen was to
join a fraternity. Fortunately he happened to have a pledge card
on him, so he pricked my thumb and I signed. He didn't tell me the
name of the fraternity or where it is located, but I suppose I'll find
lout when I go active.
' Meanwhile this fellow comes around every week and collects his
dues which are $100. Lately he has been collecting $10 extra each
week. He says this is a fine because T missed the meeting. When I
'remind him that I can't go to meetings because I don't know where
the house is, he twists my arm.
I have never regretted joining the fraternity because it is my
dearest wish to be somebody on campus and get pointed at in spas,
but you can see that it isn't cheap. It wouldn't be so bad if I slept
at the house, but you must agree that I can't very well sleep at
the house if I don't know where the house is.
I have had to rent a room. This room is not only hellishly expensive,'
but it isn't the kind of room I wanted at all. What I was looking for
was someplace reasonably priced, clean, comfortable, and within easy
walking distance of classes, the downtown shopping district, the
movies, and my home town. What I found was a bedroom in the
home of a local costcrmonger, which is dingy, expensive, uncom
; fortable, inconvenient, and I don't even get to use the bed till six
o'clock in the morning when my Landlord goes off to mong his costers.
Well, anyhow, 1 jrot settled and started going to classes. But first
1 had to pay my tuition. This came to a good deal more than the
advertised rates. When I asked the bursar what the extra money
was for, he told me lab fees. When I said I wasn't taking any labs,
he said I was taking psychology which counted as a lab because
they used white mice. When I offered to bring my own mice, of
which there are plenty in my room, he twisted my arm.
So I paid the man and. went to my classes where I found that
fill my professors had spent busy summers writing brand new text
books. Over to the bookstore I went, saw the prices on the text
books, and collapsed in a gibbering heap. At length I recovered and
made indignant demands to speak to the proprietor, but they told
me the Brinks truck had already taken him home for the day. There
was nothing for it but to buy the books.

'remind him that I can't go to meetings because I don't know where
the house is, he twists my arm.
I have never regretted joining the fraternity because it is my
dearest wish to be somebody on campus and get pointed at in spas,
but you can see that it isn't cheap. It wouldn't be so bad if I slept
at the house, but you must agree that I can't very well sleep at
the house if I don't know where the house is.
I have had to rent a room. This room is not only hellishly expensive,'
but it isn't the kind of room I wanted at all. What I was looking for
was someplace reasonably priced, clean, comfortable, and within easy
walking distance of classes, the downtown shopping district, the
movies, and my home town. What I found was a bedroom in the
home of a local costcrmonger, which is dingy, expensive, uncom
; fortable, inconvenient, and I don't even get to use the bed till six
o'clock in the morning when my Landlord goes off to mong his costers.
Well, anyhow, 1 jrot settled and started going to classes. But first
1 had to pay my tuition. This came to a good deal more than the
advertised rates. When I asked the bursar what the extra money
was for, he told me lab fees. When I said I wasn't taking any labs,
he said I was taking psychology which counted as a lab because
they used white mice. When I offered to bring my own mice, of
which there are plenty in my room, he twisted my arm.
So I paid the man and. went to my classes where I found that
fill my professors had spent busy summers writing brand new text
books. Over to the bookstore I went, saw the prices on the text
books, and collapsed in a gibbering heap. At length I recovered and
made indignant demands to speak to the proprietor, but they told
me the Brinks truck had already taken him home for the day. There
was nothing for it but to buy the books.
i
Next I turned to romance—and found it. Harriet, her name was—a
great, strapping girl. I first spied her leaning against the statue of
the Founder, dozing lightly. I talked to her for several hours without
effect. Only when I mentioned dinner did she stir. Her milky little
ryes opened, she raised a heavy arm, seized my nape, and dragged
me ofT to a dimly lit placo called The Trap where everything was
n la carte. She ordered cracked crab ($1.75), sirloin Chateaubriand
($7.00), a scuttle of french fries (18<* the french fry), an artichoke
(oOif the leaf), and compote (80tf the prune).
After dinner she lapsed into a torpor from which I could not rouse
her, no matter how I tried. I banged my glass with my fork. I did
bird calls of North and South America. I pinched her huge pendulous
jowl. I rubbed the legs of my corduroy pants together ... But nothing
worked, and finally I had to sling l her over my shoulder and carry
her to the prirls dormitory, to the vast amusement of everybody
along the route.
But it was not the jeers of bystanders that bothered me. It was
the hernia. I 1 ortunately, medical care for students is provided free
at the college dispensary; all I had to pay for were a few extras,
like X-rays, anaesthesia, operating room, forceps, hemostats, scal
pels, sponges, catgut, linens, towels, amortization, and nurses. They
would not, however, let me keep the nurses.
So, dear, cousin, if you see me these days without a Philip Morris
cigarette, it is not because I don't like Philip Morris cigarettes. I
do. I flip when I taste their mild rare vintage tobaccos. Rut I can't
afford cigarettes. I can'f even afford matches, what with fraternity
dues and room rent and lab fees and textbook prices and my girl
Harriet and medical rare.

MY COUSIN HASKELL

1 have a cousin named Haskell Krovney, a sweet, unspoiled country
boy, who has just started college. A letter arrived from him this
morning which I will reprint here because I know that Haskell's
problems are so much like your own. Haskell writes:
Dear Haskell (he thinks my name is Haskell too),
I see that you are writing a column for Philip Morris cigarettes.
I think they are keen cigarettes which taste real good and which
make a pleasant noise when you open the pack, and I want to tell
you why I don't smoke them.
It all started the very first day I arrived at collegc. I had just
gotten off the train and was walking across the campus, swinging
my cardboard valise whistling snatches of Valencia, Barney Google,
and other latest tunes, admiring statues, petting dogs and girls, when
all of a sudden I ran into this fellow with a blue jacket, gray pants,
and white teeth. He asked me was I a freshman. I said yes. He asked
me did I want to go places on campus, make a big name for myself,
and get pointed at in fashionable ballrooms and spas. I said yes. He
said the only way to make all these keen things happen was to
join a fraternity. Fortunately he happened to have a pledge card
on him, so he pricked my thumb and I signed. He didn't tell me the
name of the fraternity or where it is located, but I suppose I'll find
lout when I go active.
' Meanwhile this fellow comes around every week and collects his
dues which are $100. Lately he has been collecting $10 extra each
week. He says this is a fine because T missed the meeting. When I
'remind him that I can't go to meetings because I don't know where
the house is, he twists my arm.
