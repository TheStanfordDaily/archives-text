## 
### DICK MANSFIELD 
Richard Graves, Democratic candidate for Governor of Cali
fornia, cited Republican "refusal to face the facts" of public edu
cation in the state as he spoke after a Democratic political dinnei
in San Jose Tuesday night.
Graves' specific example was the current condition at San Jose

State College, where the Republican
administration in Sacramento, faced
a choice between "turning away ap
plicants for entrance or rationing the
education." The decision, Graves
said, was to "ration the education."
Then the Democratic candidate
extended his example to include all
public schools and colleges in the
state of California. "Classes have
been doubled up or arranged in
shifts in public schools throughout
the 'state," he said.
"Why don't we face up to the
problem, which is that present and
future school children in this state
will need 5i,250,000,000 in the next
five years?" Graves asked.
He pointed out the GOP - spon
sored bond issue for the public
schools which will be on the Nov. 2
ballot is for only $100,000,000.
REPEATS CHARGES
Referring to previous charges
which he had made against Republi
can Governor Goodwin J. Knight,
Graves asked, "What do you think
of a man who will raise tuition at
the University of California (a move
Knight allegedly made in lieu of
raising school taxes) and refuse to
raise taxes on race tracks?"

The man v.o was introduced a.'
"the next Governor of the state of
California" commented with a smilt
on Charles Wilson's recent "bird
dog" analogy: "You know, he just
made us another 300,000 votes in
this state . .
He supported relief as a means to
rehabilitation, and came out foi
public housing. He spoke of the
"Democratic philosophy" and of his
hope that it would be installed in
office in three weeks.
CHARGES NOT DENIED
Mentioning his series of charges at
Knight: "What has been denied has
not been charged, and what I have
charged has not been denied."
About 350 people attended the $1
a plate dinner. Local Democratic
candidates and political workers
were introduced.

Richard Graves, Democratic candidate for Governor of Cali
fornia, cited Republican "refusal to face the facts" of public edu
cation in the state as he spoke after a Democratic political dinnei
in San Jose Tuesday night.
Graves' specific example was the current condition at San Jose

State College, where the Republican
administration in Sacramento, faced
a choice between "turning away ap
plicants for entrance or rationing the
education." The decision, Graves
said, was to "ration the education."
Then the Democratic candidate
extended his example to include all
public schools and colleges in the
state of California. "Classes have
been doubled up or arranged in
shifts in public schools throughout
the 'state," he said.
"Why don't we face up to the
problem, which is that present and
future school children in this state
will need 5i,250,000,000 in the next
five years?" Graves asked.
He pointed out the GOP - spon
sored bond issue for the public
schools which will be on the Nov. 2
ballot is for only $100,000,000.
REPEATS CHARGES
Referring to previous charges
which he had made against Republi
can Governor Goodwin J. Knight,
Graves asked, "What do you think
of a man who will raise tuition at
the University of California (a move
Knight allegedly made in lieu of
raising school taxes) and refuse to
raise taxes on race tracks?"

The man v.o was introduced a.'
"the next Governor of the state of
California" commented with a smilt
on Charles Wilson's recent "bird
dog" analogy: "You know, he just
made us another 300,000 votes in
this state . .
He supported relief as a means to
rehabilitation, and came out foi
public housing. He spoke of the
"Democratic philosophy" and of his
hope that it would be installed in
office in three weeks.
CHARGES NOT DENIED
Mentioning his series of charges at
Knight: "What has been denied has
not been charged, and what I have
charged has not been denied."
About 350 people attended the $1
a plate dinner. Local Democratic
candidates and political workers
were introduced.
