# Wilson Says Dog Remark Was Error
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 13 (UP)—De
fense Secretary Charles E. Wil
son, in an address prepared for
delivery to a Republican dinner
here tonight, said he made a
"mistake — bringing up those
bird dogs at the same time I
was talking about people."
He also accused his opponents of
making a campaign of "desperation,
of deliberate misrepresentation, of
hitting below the belt."
Wilson appeared at a GOP fund
raising dinner, along with Illinois'
Republican Governor William G.
Stratton, who earlier had said he
believed Wilson's address should be
canceled because of the Secretary's
remarks in Detroit Monday.
At that time, Wilson was discuss
ing at a news conference the prob
lem of defense contracts for dis
tressed areas, and he cited as an ex
ample what a delegation from such
an area told him about the problems
in their district. He said one had
cited that a reduction of the draft
meant "110 more young men that
won't have to go to the Korean fight
now, and that'll add to our unem
ployment."
A MISTAKE'
As part of his reply, Wilson said,
"I've always liked bird dogs better
than kennel-fed dogs myself."
Tonight, in his prepared address,
he said in discussing the matter and
the controversy aroused:
"In the first place, I admit that I
made a mistake, an unfortunate mis
take, bringing up those bird dogs at
the same time I was talking about
people.
"There are times when my re
marks get me into trouble especially
in political matters, and I seem to
be in trouble now.
"The way my remarks were dis
torted by our left-wing opponents
certainly looks terrible in print. I
admit that.
I AM SORRY'
"So right here, right now, I want
to say to the American people that
I am sorry I made inept remarks
which were subject to misinterpre
tation. But there is one thing that I
will not do, one thing that I know
you would not want me to do. It is
this:
"I will not let our political assail
ants get away with the charge that
I am unsympathetic with the prob
lems of workmen or that the vicious
interpretations they have put on my
statements represent in any manner
my feelings for or philosophy to
ward the working men and women
of this country.
"Their statements could not be
further from the truth. Their phony
political charges are completely the
insinuations that come from desper
ate political enemies. Actually, I'll
match my labor record with anyone
in this nation, and that goes for par
tisan politicians, labor leaders or
anyone else."

"Their statements could not be
further from the truth. Their phony
political charges are completely the
insinuations that come from desper
ate political enemies. Actually, I'll
match my labor record with anyone
in this nation, and that goes for par
tisan politicians, labor leaders or
anyone else."
CHICAGO, Oct. 13 (UP)—De
fense Secretary Charles E. Wil
son, in an address prepared for
delivery to a Republican dinner
here tonight, said he made a
"mistake — bringing up those
bird dogs at the same time I
was talking about people."
He also accused his opponents of
making a campaign of "desperation,
of deliberate misrepresentation, of
hitting below the belt."
Wilson appeared at a GOP fund
raising dinner, along with Illinois'
Republican Governor William G.
Stratton, who earlier had said he
believed Wilson's address should be
canceled because of the Secretary's
remarks in Detroit Monday.
At that time, Wilson was discuss
ing at a news conference the prob
lem of defense contracts for dis
tressed areas, and he cited as an ex
ample what a delegation from such
an area told him about the problems
in their district. He said one had
cited that a reduction of the draft
meant "110 more young men that
won't have to go to the Korean fight
now, and that'll add to our unem
ployment."
A MISTAKE'
As part of his reply, Wilson said,
"I've always liked bird dogs better
than kennel-fed dogs myself."
Tonight, in his prepared address,
he said in discussing the matter and
the controversy aroused:
"In the first place, I admit that I
made a mistake, an unfortunate mis
take, bringing up those bird dogs at
the same time I was talking about
people.
"There are times when my re
marks get me into trouble especially
in political matters, and I seem to
be in trouble now.
"The way my remarks were dis
torted by our left-wing opponents
certainly looks terrible in print. I
admit that.
I AM SORRY'
"So right here, right now, I want
to say to the American people that
I am sorry I made inept remarks
which were subject to misinterpre
tation. But there is one thing that I
will not do, one thing that I know
you would not want me to do. It is
this:
"I will not let our political assail
ants get away with the charge that
I am unsympathetic with the prob
lems of workmen or that the vicious
interpretations they have put on my
statements represent in any manner
my feelings for or philosophy to
ward the working men and women
of this country.
"Their statements could not be
further from the truth. Their phony
political charges are completely the
insinuations that come from desper
ate political enemies. Actually, I'll
match my labor record with anyone
in this nation, and that goes for par
tisan politicians, labor leaders or
