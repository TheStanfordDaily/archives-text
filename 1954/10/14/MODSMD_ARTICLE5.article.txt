Canadian Delegate Paul Martin in
troduced a resolution in the General

asking that the negotiations be con
ducted in private by the United
States, Canada, Britain, France, and
Russia, the leading atomic powers.
The U.S., British, and French del
egates accepted at once Martin's in
vitation to co-sponsor his resolution.
Russia's Andrei Y. Vishinsky, who
has a disarmament plan before the
