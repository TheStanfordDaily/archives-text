# Smog Persists; L.A. Protests

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 13 (UP) —
Eye-irritating smog hung for the
seventh consecutive day over the
Los Angeles basin today, and
touched off a new series of angry
protests, including a demand from
the Pasadena City Board of Direc
tors that Governor Goodwin J.
Knight declare a state of emergency
in the area.
The directors, whose city has suf
fered the worst of the smog attacks,
also approved the request of a citi
zens* committee for a mass smog
protest meeting Oct. 28 in the city
auditorium.
The problem continued as an issue
in the gubernatorial race as Demo
cratic nominee Richard Graves de
clared in Los Angeles that smog
control "is primarily a legal and po
litical job."
This was in direct opposition to
the statement yesterday of Knight,
who said it was "primarily an engi
neering and scientific job." Knight
promised to'place the issue before
the State Legislature in January.
Francis H. Packard, head of the
four - man citizens' committee in
Pasadena, said after the crowded
city directors' meeting, "We don't
care where smog comes from—let's
just get rid of it."
