# WITH GERMANY:
## France Tries For Joint Rearmament 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 14 (UP)â€”France
began a campaign today for
joint French and German pro
duction of armaments in the
same factories as another guar
antee against a runaway Ger
man war potential.
The project, obviously inspired by
Premier Pierre Mendes-France, was
.sent up as a sensational trial balloon
before next week's top-level confer
ence here to seal formal agreement
on German rearmament.
The plan was unveiled first in the
afternoon newspaper Paris-Presse
which called it a Mendes-France
project and expounded in a speech
at the 49th annual convention of the
Premier's own Radical - Socialist
party in Marseille.
'IDEA IN THE AIR'
A government spokesman admitted
"the idea definitely is in the air."
He said it not only would place new
curbs on German rearmament but
would make European factory ca
pacity less dependent on continued
U.S. military aid.
Observers said the idea of the old
French and German wartime ene
mies reconciling themselves to turn
ing out weapons on the same as
sembly lines was an extension of a
seed planted in stony ground at the
London conference.
Mendes-France suggested in Lon
don "the possibility of creating, in
common, factories destined to satisfy
common demands." His proposal re
ceived a frigid reception and he
dropped it for the time being.
The Paris-Presse, in what appeared
to be an inspired story, wrote that
tightly integrated Franco-German
production of armaments would be
a "practical reconciliation" between
the two countries. The factories
would be controlled by a common
organization.
