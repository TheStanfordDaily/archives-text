# EXCOM NOTES
## Tie Vote Procedure Considered by Excom 
### RUSS WILKS Associate Editor, The Daily 
President Pete Bing pointed out at the Executive Committee
of the ASSU meeting Wednesday evening that the election com
mittee was without a method of resolving a tie vote.
The old system, which was thrown out with preferential voting
last spring, was to settle the conflict by lot. Discussion on the

motion was tabled until the next"
meeting to give the Excom members
time to think about a solution.
A committee was established to
look into the by-laws of the consti
tution and determine what appoint
ments had to be approved by Excom.
In conjunction with President
Wallace Sterling's Stanford re-eval
uation program a committee was set
up to contact him and work out the
details for the construction of an Ex
com re-evaluation committee.
ELECTION DAYS
A proposal to have election booths
open for one day during primaries
and two days during finals was de
feated. The present plan calls for
the booths to be open two days in
both cases.
Jack Eraser, Ann Irvine, and Don
Peck were approved as co-chairmen
for the Union Planning Committee
and 29 sophomores were accepted to
serve on the class excom.
The sophomore class told of its
plans to sponsor a benefit "Jazz at
Mem Aud" on a Sunday afternoon
in winter quarter. The class hopes
to raise money for two foreign
scholarships. The plan met with fa
vorable comment from Excom.
Excom allocated $143 to three of
its committees. The health commit
tee received $20 to pay for traveling

expenses for three representatives to
a health conference in early Decem
ber. Fifty dollars was appropriated
to the foreign scholarship committee
for public relations work to cover
mailing and printing expenses and

new banner for the UCLA game.
The other banner received a fatal
rip during the Navy tilt.
The sports sampler booklet is be
