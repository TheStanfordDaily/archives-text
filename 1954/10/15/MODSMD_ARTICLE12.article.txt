### 
LONDON, Oct. 14 (UP) —The government stepped in tonight in
an effort to settle a Communist-backed dock strike threatening
Britain's supply lifelines. The government move followed a warn
ing by union chiefs that they would spread the walkout to all
British ports.
An emergency cabinet meeting called by Prime Minister

Winston Churchill decided against
using troops in the strike now. But
shortly after the session, Labor Min
ister Sir Walter Monckton asked em

which have stilled the world's larg
est port and snarled the transport

working of "compulsory" overtime.
They said they would refuse to re
turn to their jobs until such over
time work was eliminated.
The walkouts were mushrooming
into Britain's largest strike since the

general strike of 1926.
The cabinet decided the time was
not ripe to call in troops to unload
ships but Churchill was keeping per
sonal watch on the situation and his
ministers were standing by.
Shortly after th 6' cabinet session
leaders of the striking National
Amalgamated Stevedores and Dock
ers Union (NASD), joined by wild
cat transport strike leaders, threat
ened to extend the stoppage all along
the British coast in a few days.
Britain's Communists were among
their active backers and the rank
and-file strikers were in open revolt
against the right-wing leaders of the
big General Workers' Union (TG
WU).
