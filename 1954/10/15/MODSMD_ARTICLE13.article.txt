SOUTHLAND RENDEZVOUSâ€”The Huntington-Sheraton Hotel in Pasadena where Stanford stu
dents will gather tonight at 8:30 for a pre-UCLA game rally. Head cheer leader Ed Mahoney
and his assistants, the Rally Com pom-pom girls, and a pep band will be on hand to help Indian
rooters get up steam for the Card-Bruin classic in the Coliseum. Rendezvous time is 8:30 in the
Horseshoe Gardens of the hotel, Indians' headquarters for the weekend. The rally, which will
be "short but spirited" according to Rally Com, will feature a talk by assistant varsity football
coach Dutch Fehring, as Coach Chuck and his team go into hiding for the evening. Card root
ers will be hoping for a repeat of last year's 21-20 Stanford win.
