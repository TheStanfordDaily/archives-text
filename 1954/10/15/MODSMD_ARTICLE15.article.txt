# Card Stunts Spoof Bruins, Root Indians
## 
### 
Half-time card stunts on the Stan
ford side of Memorial Coliseum to
morrow will spoof the Bruin and
root the Red Machine to victory,
according to the card stunt plan re
leased by Rally Com.
First stunt will show the words
"Good Afternoon" in green on a
white field.
A flip stunt spoofing the UCLA
spell stunt will begin by spelling out
the letters "ALCU" in yellow on a
blue field. Since the "ALCU" is
backward, the flip will come up with
a black "OOPS!" on a white field.
Second stunt series will .follow
the "Can the Cub" theme: first
stunt will show the words "Big Red
Cannery" in red on a white field;
second stunt will show a bruin cub
lying on a conveyor belt with four
knife blades cutting him into sec
tions; third stunt shows a brown
bear being put into a can; the last
will show the can being borne away,
labeled "Grade B Bear."
CARDS' RECORD #
Then the card section will resume
the Indians' first four games. The
cards will form black "X's" to cross
out "COP," "Oregon," and "Illini"
in three flip stunts. Then the Navy
game will be represented by a black
"NAVY" on a black field â€”solid
black in the card section.
Predicting a Stanford triumph, the
card section will then depict a blue
"UCLA" on a yellow field and cover
it with a red field in a four-count
flip.
The last stunt will be the tradi
tional expanding "S" in white on
a red field.
