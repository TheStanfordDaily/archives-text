It couldn't happen here.
That's what we thought way back when a
ranting, undersized demagogue took over
Germany.
We kept on thinking that as the personal
liberties of the once-proud Germans were cur
tailed, and the citizenry transformed into one
of the most ruthless destructive forces the
world has ever known.
But now we wonder.
When Henry Blauth spoke last Tuesday on
life in a Fascist state, he reminded us of cer
tain disturbing similarities between the Ger
many of 1932 and the America of 1954.
Before Hitler took over, Germans pointed
disdainfully at the Italians under Mussolini
and said smugly "it couldn't happen here."
Because the Germans had a long history as
a free people, they acted differently from the
Italians, who were accustomed to domination
by foreigners.
The Italian was used to behaving outwardly
as his superior bid, inwardly remaining true
to himself.
The German found this almost impossible.
He was proud of his individuality, an individu
ality reflected in the many political parties
that existed freely in Germany. He gloried
in his right of free speech, free thought, and
free action.
When, under the Fascist regime, tttis free
speech and free action was curtailed, the only
way the German could solve his inner conflict
was to force himself to believe in Hitler.
With this comparison before us, we wonder
how Americans, with their long heritage of
personal freedom, would react to a dictatorial
regime.
In 1932 the youth of Germany was restless

and confused. To them unemployment was a
grim reality, with little hope of improved con
ditions. They had no responsibilities, no se
cure position in German society.
When Hitler took over, his strongest appeals
were directed to German youth. Over and
over again he told them that they were the
salt of the earth, the future of their country.
And youth responded. They marched. They
fought. They laid down their liyes for this man
who treated them as people, who gave them a
job and an importance in their society.
We think of this as we consider the Amer
ican youth ot today—unsure about their fu
ture, discouraged by the fact that no one
seems to need them, some turning to de
linquency in their efforts to "be somebody."
and we wonder what a clever leader could
do iLhe appealed to this untapped reservoir
ot power, gave it direction, and unleashed it
upon the American public.
The key word throughout the Nazi regime
might be hatred. Hatred for anyone who does
not believe what was "right" to believe. Hatred
for "the enemy," who must either be con
verted to the proper beliefs or be killed.
Fair play was forgotten in the attempt to
knock the enemy down, whether it be by de
rogatory remarks, name-calling, or the time
honored Fascist procedure, guilt by associa
tion.
We wonder about this as we hear reputa
tion-shattering labels thrown at anyone who
does not hew to the "correct" beliefs, as we
see fair play discarded as useless ballast in
the battle for power.
And yet, Americans think "it can't happen
here."
We hope not.

and said smugly "it couldn't happen here."
Because the Germans had a long history as
a free people, they acted differently from the
Italians, who were accustomed to domination
by foreigners.
The Italian was used to behaving outwardly
as his superior bid, inwardly remaining true
to himself.
The German found this almost impossible.
He was proud of his individuality, an individu
ality reflected in the many political parties
that existed freely in Germany. He gloried
in his right of free speech, free thought, and
free action.
When, under the Fascist regime, tttis free
speech and free action was curtailed, the only
way the German could solve his inner conflict
was to force himself to believe in Hitler.
With this comparison before us, we wonder
how Americans, with their long heritage of
personal freedom, would react to a dictatorial
regime.
In 1932 the youth of Germany was restless

and confused. To them unemployment was a
grim reality, with little hope of improved con
ditions. They had no responsibilities, no se
cure position in German society.
When Hitler took over, his strongest appeals
were directed to German youth. Over and
over again he told them that they were the
salt of the earth, the future of their country.
And youth responded. They marched. They
fought. They laid down their liyes for this man
who treated them as people, who gave them a
job and an importance in their society.
We think of this as we consider the Amer
ican youth ot today—unsure about their fu
ture, discouraged by the fact that no one
seems to need them, some turning to de
linquency in their efforts to "be somebody."
and we wonder what a clever leader could
do iLhe appealed to this untapped reservoir
ot power, gave it direction, and unleashed it
upon the American public.
The key word throughout the Nazi regime
might be hatred. Hatred for anyone who does
not believe what was "right" to believe. Hatred
for "the enemy," who must either be con
verted to the proper beliefs or be killed.
Fair play was forgotten in the attempt to
knock the enemy down, whether it be by de
rogatory remarks, name-calling, or the time
honored Fascist procedure, guilt by associa
tion.
We wonder about this as we hear reputa
tion-shattering labels thrown at anyone who
does not hew to the "correct" beliefs, as we
see fair play discarded as useless ballast in
the battle for power.
And yet, Americans think "it can't happen
here."
We hope not.
It couldn't happen here.
That's what we thought way back when a
ranting, undersized demagogue took over
Germany.
We kept on thinking that as the personal
liberties of the once-proud Germans were cur
tailed, and the citizenry transformed into one
of the most ruthless destructive forces the
world has ever known.
But now we wonder.
When Henry Blauth spoke last Tuesday on
life in a Fascist state, he reminded us of cer
tain disturbing similarities between the Ger
many of 1932 and the America of 1954.
Before Hitler took over, Germans pointed
disdainfully at the Italians under Mussolini
