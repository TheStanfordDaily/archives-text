# KEAR Faces Advertising Cancellation
## 
### 
Some 75 per cent of the regular
paid advertising on station KEAR
has been canceled or suspended at
the request of the striking unions, it
was reported yesterday.
The station was struck earlier this
month by the American Federation
of Television and Radio Artists of
the AFL and the National Associa
tion of Broadcasting Engineers and
Technicians of the CIO.
Station manager Ken Hildebrandt
confirmed that the Burgermeister
Brewing Corporation had canceled
its nightly "Burgie Music Hall," and
that a few smaller advertisers had
also suspended advertising for the
duration of the labor difficulty.
Charlie Lynn, KEAR announcer
now on strike and head of the "spon
sor visiting" committee for the un
ions involved, said that some 75 per
cent of the advertisers had sus
pended advertising activities.
Lynn also claimed that KEAR was
continuing to run the commercials
even though the sponsors had can
celed.
Several sponsors have started
legal action to obtain an injunction
against this practice, he added.
Among the other sponsors the
union claims have joined Burger
meister are the RCA and Admiral
co-operative shows (cost shared by
the company and the local dealer),
Paoli's Grill, Larry Blake, The Shad
ows, Berkeley Sewing Machine
Company, and the Little Lamb Res
taurant.
