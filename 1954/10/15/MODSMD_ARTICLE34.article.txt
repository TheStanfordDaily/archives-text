Stanford 82, UCLA 0; Stanford

0.
Predictions for tomorrow's
clash with the Bruins in the Col
iseum? We're afraid not, al
though most Indian rooters
would probably settle for a re
peat of last year's 21-20 win.
No, these are the scores of the first
three Stanford-UCLA games when
the Bruins were still sporting the
name: University of California,
Southern Branch.
That 82-0 affair was back in 1925,
when the Indians, with the redoubt
able Ernie Nevers on the bench,
scored two touchdowns in the first
four minutes of play and were
spearheaded by Dick Hyland, now a
Los Angeles sportswriter.
Since then the Cards and Bruins
have clashed 24 times, with Stanford
coming out on top 14 times. There
has been one tie in the series, which

ranks as the longest with any PCC j
opponent for UCLA.
After those first three lacings,
UCLA started making the scores
pretty respectable—it was only 20-0
for Stanford in 1930; in 1931, the In- 1
dians squeaked by only 12 to 6. The :
Bruins won their first contest in the j
rivalry in 1932 with a 13 to 6 tri
umph.
Probably the greatest wins for the
Cards in the series came in 1948 and
last year.
In 1948 the Indians, decided un
derdogs, held the v«unted Bruins to
a 7-7 tie at half-time and then
roared back in the second half to
bury the Uclans 34-14. It was sweet
revenge for the Cards since they
had been blasted 26-6 and 39-6 the j
two previous seasons.
Probably even a greater win for i
the Indians was last year's 21 -20 ]
thriller, which was the only loss j
over the regular season for the UC- i
LA eleven.
Generally regarded as one of the
most exciting games in Farm foot
ball history, it was All-American
Bob Garrett who engineered the up
set by completing 18 of 27 passes for j
196 yards, throwing three touch
down passes, recovering a fumble to
set up one of the TD's, and inter
cepting a pass to thwart a Bruin
scoring drive. Garrett also kicked
the three extra points which gave
Stanford its margin of victory.
UCLA is not without its upsets in
the series, too. One of their best
was a 7-6 triumph over the Vow
Boys in 1935, Stanford's only loss
(hat season, while 14-7 and 21-7 vic
tories in 1949 and 1350 chilled In
dian Rose Bowl hopes for those' Se
asons.

down passes, recovering a fumble to
set up one of the TD's, and inter
cepting a pass to thwart a Bruin
scoring drive. Garrett also kicked
the three extra points which gave
Stanford its margin of victory.
UCLA is not without its upsets in
the series, too. One of their best
was a 7-6 triumph over the Vow
Boys in 1935, Stanford's only loss
(hat season, while 14-7 and 21-7 vic
tories in 1949 and 1350 chilled In

Predictions for tomorrow's
clash with the Bruins in the Col
iseum? We're afraid not, al
though most Indian rooters
would probably settle for a re
peat of last year's 21-20 win.
No, these are the scores of the first
three Stanford-UCLA games when
the Bruins were still sporting the
name: University of California,
Southern Branch.
That 82-0 affair was back in 1925,
when the Indians, with the redoubt
able Ernie Nevers on the bench,
scored two touchdowns in the first
four minutes of play and were
spearheaded by Dick Hyland, now a
Los Angeles sportswriter.
Since then the Cards and Bruins
have clashed 24 times, with Stanford
coming out on top 14 times. There
has been one tie in the series, which

ranks as the longest with any PCC j
opponent for UCLA.
After those first three lacings,
UCLA started making the scores
pretty respectable—it was only 20-0
for Stanford in 1930; in 1931, the In- 1
dians squeaked by only 12 to 6. The :
Bruins won their first contest in the j
rivalry in 1932 with a 13 to 6 tri
umph.
Probably the greatest wins for the
Cards in the series came in 1948 and
last year.
In 1948 the Indians, decided un
derdogs, held the v«unted Bruins to
a 7-7 tie at half-time and then
roared back in the second half to
bury the Uclans 34-14. It was sweet
revenge for the Cards since they
had been blasted 26-6 and 39-6 the j
two previous seasons.
Probably even a greater win for i
the Indians was last year's 21 -20 ]
thriller, which was the only loss j
over the regular season for the UC- i
LA eleven.
Generally regarded as one of the
most exciting games in Farm foot
ball history, it was All-American
Bob Garrett who engineered the up
set by completing 18 of 27 passes for j
196 yards, throwing three touch
down passes, recovering a fumble to
set up one of the TD's, and inter
cepting a pass to thwart a Bruin
scoring drive. Garrett also kicked
