# Tankmen Travel South; Challenge USC, UCLA
## 
### JIM BAKER 
"I'd rate Friday's game with USC a toss-upt" said varsity water
polo coach Tom Haynie last night, "but we ought to beat UCLA
easily on Saturday."
Both games will be played in the southland. The varsity will
meet USC today at 3 p.m. in the Trojan pool. The UCLA game

will be played tomorrow morning at'
10 in the Westwood pool.
Leading the Indian mermen will
be forward Irwin Johnson. Johnson,
who scored six goal* in Stanford's
win over San Jose State and two
of the Indians' three in their loss to
Cal, will be a big factor in both
contests.
The Cards need to win both tilts to
remain in contention for the PCC
crown, as they lost their league
opener to a more experienced Blue
and Gold.
Last year Stanford's undefeated
| championship team overran UCLA
13-G and later trampled USC 17-5,
! to set a new all-time conference
t scoring record.
Starting lineup for the Tribe: for
wards —Irwin Johnson, Bob Berg
lund, Bill Templeton; guards—Bob
Ziegler, Danny Osborne, Carver
Nixon; goalie—Ed Barr.
