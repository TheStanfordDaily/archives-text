# Sedition, Labor Laws Will Be Court Topic

WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 (UP)
—The Supreme Court agreed
today to decide whether the
states as well as the federal gov
ernment may maintain sedition
laws to curb Communists and
other subversives.
It also left standing a lower court
ruling that labor unions may not
strike during the lifetime of their
wage contracts.
These two actions highlighted the
court's first business session of its
1954-55 term. The Justices, reduced
to eight in number by the death of
Judge Ko»bert H. aJckson, announced
their decisions on whether to con
sider some 150 cases presented to
them for review.
The sedition case is one of the
most important the court agreed to
hear this year. It involves the va
lidity of sedition laws now in force
in more than three-fourths of the
states.
Specifically it involves Pittsburgh
Communist leader, convicted in 1952
of violating Pennsylvania's law for
bidding conspiracies to overthrow
the U.S. government.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court
reversed the conviction on grounds
only federal law applies to such of
fenses. Pennsylvania and the at
torneys general of 27 other states
appealed to the high court to uphold
state sedition statutes.
A union spokesman said the action
on the no-strike ruling may cause
laibor unions to seek shorter wage
contracts in the future in contrast to
a current trend to long-term agree
ments.
The court, in a brief order with no
opinion, refused to overturn a rul
ing by the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals that the CIO Packing
house Workers violated the Taft-
Hartley Law by striking before their
contract with Wilson & Company
expired in 1948.
