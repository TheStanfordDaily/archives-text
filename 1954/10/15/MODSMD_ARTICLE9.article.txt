# Major Battle Will Rage in Southland As Tribe Goes off to War With Bruins
## 70,000 Will Watch Cards Tackle Highly Rated UCLA 
### BILL WRIGHT 
They may need a Bobby Garrett or just a routine miracle, but
none the less Stanford's green but amazing gridiron knights are
reasonably confident about tomorrow's encounter with the Rose
Bowl boys from UCLA.
The Indians know the Bruins can be handled; they have that
intangible feeling that the Bruins are ripe to be knocked off. Now.
And 70,000 fans, including a large contingent from the Farm,
may gather at 2 p.m. in Los Angeles' giant Memorial Coliseum
to see if lightning —the lightning of aerial artistry—can strike the
Bruins down again.
Last year the Westwood powers with Paul Cameron in charge
were two-touchdown favorites as the Indians laid out the welcome
mat. But there was a booby trap beneath that carpet named Bobby
Garrett. The Cards choked off the Cameron offense and the Bruins
withered on the vine, 21-20.
Once more the Bruins, ranked third nationally, have the experts'
backing—two touchdowns' worth. Once more the Indians are a

mysterious amoeba, drncing and
spirited fighters one day and just
aimless blobs in football gear the
next.
Once more the Indians will rely
on their air game. If you wonder
why passes or what passing attack,
you are in the same boat with Chuck
Taylor and his staff.
The Stanford air performance has
not been a joy to watch; and if passes
from John Brodie and Jerry Gustaf
son fall incomplete tomorrow, the
clock will stop and the Bruins will
have more time to control the ball.
But on the other hand, how are
you going to run through the bul
wark which is the Bruin line? Coach
Red Sanders has possibly the finest
defensive team against running in
the nation. The only hope may be to
throw beyond the line and over the
heads of a couple short UCLA sec
ondary defenders.
PASSING IMPROVES
Stanford has been drilling on
passes this week with noticeable day
by-day improvement. Taylor indi
cates that Brodie will get the start
ing nod if his sore ankle has recov
ered. Gustafson will be the relief
pitcher.
With Jim McCamant almost defi
nitely a bench-warmer because of
his recently twisted ankle, John
Stewart of high jump fame and Steve
Docter will be responsible for find
ing daylight amidst the Bruin sec
ondary.
But how good are the big, bad,
bruising Bruins? Dumping San Di
iego, Navy, and Kansas meant noth
ing; however, high pre-season rank
ings seemed to have been substanti
ated when monstrous Maryland fell
before the rock-ribbed Bruin de
fensive wall, 12-7.
But another week and another at
titude. Maryland, oh monstrous
Maryland, was held even by Wake
Forest. It might have comc as a
shock that Wake Forest still played
football. Then the Bruins them
selves went to sleep in Seattle, woke
up tied in knots, and were lucky to
hold a 21-20 edge over Washington
at the final gun.
HOW ABOUT UCLA?
So how good are the Bruins?
Personnel - wise they're plenty
good. They have two lines which
would make any football coach hap
py. Right tackle Joe Ray probably
will miss the tilt, but that shouldn't,
bother folks in Westwood too much
If all the other minor Bruin
wounds clear up as expected, there
will be abundant talent, to replace
Ray. Gil Moreno and Warner Ben
jamin, the second-team tackles, and
Hardiman Cureton, alternating fust
string guard, are capable of taking
over.
