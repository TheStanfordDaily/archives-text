# Bruin 'Snowball' Rolls Over Stunned Indians
## Scoring Records Broken in Rout 
### BILL WRIGHT 
MEMORIAL COLISEUM, Los
Angeles, Oct. 16 — "What is
there to say?" the man asked.
You concede it was the worst
defeat in Stanford history. Beat
Washington. Then you stop.
Yop've just about covered it.
All you want to do is forget.
The scorc, in case by chance yon
have forgotten, was seventy-two to
nothing. In favor of UCLA.
It was really something to see. If
you could bear it. The Uclans were
just like a snowball rolling down a
steep hill. TJiey couldn't be slowed.
They couldn't be stopped. They got
bigger, faster, and better as the min
ute hand made four excruciatingly
slow circuits around the clock.
At 4:08 of the first period, the
snowball was visible. And it. was
none too small then. Battering Bob
Davenport spun through center 33
yards for six.
The rolling mass of baby blue was
moving full tilt at 14:25 of the same
period as Jim Decker swooped
around left end and was long gone—
64 yards.
By the time Sam Brown tripped H'/.
yards behind ferocious blocking with
an Indian punt, in the fourth stanza,
it was practically a glacier.
That in essence was the football
game (pardon the expression) as it
looked from the stands.
TAYLOR S VIEWS
How did it look from the side
lines where Chuck Taylor watched
festivities? The Indians' head man
grinned weakly as the newsmen
gathered in the morgue which was
the Stanford dressing room: "We
can't be that bad."
"They've got a great team, a hel
luva team," Taylor said in awe.
"There's very little you can say
about it. The whole team was a
helluva good outfit."
"No," he laughed, "they didn't do
anything I didn't expect them to do,
but they did it better than I ex
pected. We just couldn't seem to
stop those damn reverses."
But despite the insulting rout in
front of him, Taylor saw some things
which pleased him: "1 felt bettei
about the boys after this game than
the Navy game. They were putting
out 100 per cent."
PASSING GOOD
Taylor was more than compli
mentary about the Cards' passing at
tack, which gained 203 yards on 2?
completions (although the Bruins
ran back eight interceptons for 218
yards): "I was pleased with John
Brodie regardless of the intercep
tions. He was hitting on passes fo!
the first time.
"And I was very pleased with
John Stewart. He came into his own
today; he looked alive for the first
time."
It was true; the Stanford passing
did look pretty good. In fact the
Indians were an excellent offensive
ball club between the 30-yard lines


NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHlNG—Fullback Bill Tarr meets
the fate which was shared by the whole Indian team Saturday.
He is stopped rudely and emphatically by Uclans Roger White
(84) and Bob Heydenfeldt (83) for no gain in the Coliseum.

There was a weakness in the Bruin
pass defense and the Cards went
after it 46 times.
For the most part Brodie was ac
curate. He missed some completions
only by inches, including two tosses
off Gordy Young's finger tips. But
Brodie wasn't accurate all the time.
As Taylor said, "Sometimes it was
the defense, but Brodie was throw
ing interceptions."
KAFKA TO TAYLOR
One passing play engineered by
Don Kafka gave the Card rooters
their biggest cheer. Taylor caught
it neatly, effortlessly on the side
lines. "It was a well-thrown pass,"
he said. "I didn't have to move to
catch it."
Kafka, played a good part of the
second half after Gus Gustafson dis
located his thumb and Brodie, who
had a hip point, was removed to
save him for Washington.
The Indians had a number of other
injuries, but everybody but Docter,
who rewounded his knee, should be
ready Saturday.
Those were the bright spots from
the Stanford viewpoint. There was
more darkness. The blocking was

poor. The tackling looked worse,
but Taylor wasn't sure whether it
was just excellent Bruin running.
After the press conference, there
was a small group, including Coach
Dutch Fehring, near the door, listen
ing to news from next door. A Bruin
had been asked what mistakes Stan
ford had made. "They made one
mistake," he replied, "beating us up
there last year."
Fehring spun toward his dressing
room. You heard his clear mono
tone, crisp, almost harsh: "And we're
just liable to beat them up there
next year, too."
