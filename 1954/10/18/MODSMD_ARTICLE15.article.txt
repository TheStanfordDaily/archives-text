## 
### 
(Editor's note: Following is a
statement prepared for The Daily
by President Wallace Sterling.)
"A treat is in store for Stan
ford students next Friday, and
it will carry with it the dividend
of helping a worthy cause.
"I speak of the concert to be
given at 8:30 p.m. in Memorial
Hall by a quartet of singers
known as The King's Men. They
will be familiar to many-through
their appearances on radio and
in motion pictures. To those
who do not know them. I recom
mend them as a group who will
present an interesting and de
lightful program.
"Now as to the cause:
"The King's Men are coming
to Stanford at the invitation of
the Institute of International Re
lations lo present a concert
which we hope will raise funds
for a scholarship which will per
mit a student from the free Uni
versity of Berlin to study al
Stanford.
"I know that students and
other members of the University
community who attend this con
cert will spend an enjoyable and
worthwhile eveninq.
