# 'An Edifice of Hope'
## 
### 
"Back in 1945 . . . out of the ashes of anxiety,
sacrifice, and war emerged a bright new edi
fice of hope. It was morning and all the world
was fresh."
A bright new edifice of hope—the term one
statesman used recently to describe the emer
gence of the United Nations.
Today, nine years later, much of that original
luster is gone. The shiny exterior has been
scuffed by the split between the great powers,
scarred by battles in Korea, dented by the hy
drogen bomb.
Morning has passed by, and a few voices cry
out that man has already entered the twilight
zone of civilization and that total darkness is
approaching rapidly.
Yes, time has moved on since 1945. The
Anglo-Iranian oil dispute and the disagreement
over Trieste have been settled. The Philip
pines, India, Israel, and Egypt have taken their
first steps as independent nations. The eco
nomic rehabilitation of Europe and Asia has
progressed beyond expectation.
If the iron curtain has been clamped down

across half the world, the free half of the world,
acting through the United Nations, has proved
it can meet — and turn back—aggression.
If the hydrogen bomb has made some men
confirmed pessimists, it has led others to turn
to the United Nations with plans for pooling in
formation for peaceful purposes and outlawing
atomic weapons.
If the communist menace has made cowards
of some so that they demand a preventive war
or an international organization without Rus
sia, it has convinced many others that we must
strive all the harder to make the United Na
tions function, for it is all we have.
That is why, as Stanford joins San Francisco
and the world today in celebrating the start of
United Nations week, we don't mind if some of
the original brightness is gone. It has worked,
even if imperfectly.
The United Nations is still an "edifice of
hope." If morning has gone by since 1945, the
afternoon is yet young. With the United Na
tions in existence, chances are good that it
will be a long and pleasant one.
