For 10 days (up to but not including last Sat

Richard Graves, Democratic nominee for Gov
ernor, told his sniffling voters.

It was reported that one wailing constituent
even wrote President Eisenhower and asked
him to declare a local state of emergency. So
far no reply has been received.
Somehow we are sure that the citizens of
greater Los Angeles will be capable of finding
their own Super-solution to it all. They have
learned to survive their own driving - they can
survive anything.
