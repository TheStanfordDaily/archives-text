# Stevenson Blasts GOP Administration For Pacifying Right-Wing Extremists
## 
### PAT KING 
While serpentine swirled from the balconies and a band blared
forth with "Happy Days Are Here Again," Adlai Stevenson
mounted the speakers' platform in San Francisco's Civic Audito
rium Saturday night and charged the Administration with placing
"the welfare of the right wing of the Republican party above the

welfare of the country."
Lashing out at the Republican
"Old Guard," the '52 Presiden
tial nominee said, "The administra
tion is trapped in a dilemma of its
making—it is trying to conduct a
responsible foreign policy and also
appease the extremist wing of the
Republican party.
"It is trying to reconcile the ir
reconcilable. And it acts as though it
was more important to unite the
Republican party than to unite our
country and the free world."
Citing inconsistencies beiween Re
publican words and policies, Steven
son said, "They talk tough to satisfy
the extremists and reduce the Army
and Air Force to satisfy the budget
cutters.
"Secretary Dulles demands united
action in Indonesia and settles for
united inaction, with nothing to
show for our part in the Geneva
Conference but the preposterous
boast that we had refused to speak
to our adversaries. Why? Because
the right wing of the Republicans
have successfully identified negotia
tion with appeasement."
"Over and over we are wobbly
when we should be firm. . . . We
shake our fist and "then our finger.
Repeatedly we have bluffed friend
and foe alike."
HI I | | AND BLUSTER'
tn question after question Steven
'iii tore into the present "bluff and
bluster" foreign policy of the Re
publicans.
"Why in there no bi-partisanship
in the formulation of our foreign
policy these days? Why arc there
no Democrats in high positions in
President Eisenhower's administra
tion?
"Why have they cut economic and
tecHYiical assistance programs, just
as the Soviets venture into this

field? Why have they failed to keep
their foreign trade promises, just as
the Moscow - Peiping axis dangles
seductive trade proposals before our
hard-pressed friends?"
The answer to all these questions,
Stevenson said, is the same: "politi
cal expediency, appeasement of the
Republican extremists, party unity
at the price of national unity and
international influence."
RIPS ADMINISTRATION
Referring several times lo his l!). r >2
campaign visits to San Francisco;
Stevenson drew repeated bursts of
applause as he ripped apart the ad
ministration's foreign policy. He go)
the biggest laugh of the evening
when he mentioned the "smile and
smear technique of campaigning.
The President smiles while the Vice-
President smears."
World problems facing the United
States today, Stevenson said, include
"a trembling alliance in Europe, less
than confidence in Asia, the growing
attraction of monstrous China, Rus
sia's military and economic might,
a restless Africa, and a South Amer
ica we have taken for granted too
long."
We discard either world destruc
tion or world tyranny as solutions,
he continued. "The only course re
maining is co-existence, and I con
fess I get a little impatient wilh the
semantic debate for and against co
existence, for it i.s either co-exist
ence or no-existence."
However, the Democratic cam
paigner warned, "negotiation with
out strength, which some of our Eu
ropean friends seem to want, i.s mad
ness. Strength without negotiation
is futility .Negotiation on the basis
of strength and solidarity is the only
policy which can hold out hope to
patient and suffering mankind."
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS
With the election of a Democratic
Congress in November, Steven.-on
said, the United States "could move
from disunity, mutual recrimination,
and antagonism to that mutual re
spect and well-wishing which are
the pre-conditions of political ma
turity and responsibility."
In conclusion, he said: "The world
at the moment i.s in a long and dark
valley. Science offers us mass ex
termination. But it also offers the
world a greater abundance than we
have ever known. Our generation
will have to make a fateful choice.
"Just two years ago, here in San
Francisco, I said that: 'America has
been called to greatness. The sum
mons of the twentieth century is a
summons to our vision, to our hu
manity, to our practicality. If these
provide the common purpose of
America and Asia' (and I might have
added, of the free world), 'we need
have no fear for the future. Because
it will belong to free men.'
"I am still content to leave it there,
adding only that the Democratic
party i.s faithful to this vision and
ready to work with all like-minded
men and women in answering des
tiny's summons."

tn question after question Steven
'iii tore into the present "bluff and
bluster" foreign policy of the Re
publicans.
"Why in there no bi-partisanship
in the formulation of our foreign
policy these days? Why arc there
no Democrats in high positions in
President Eisenhower's administra
tion?
"Why have they cut economic and
tecHYiical assistance programs, just
as the Soviets venture into this

field? Why have they failed to keep
their foreign trade promises, just as
the Moscow - Peiping axis dangles
seductive trade proposals before our
hard-pressed friends?"
The answer to all these questions,
Stevenson said, is the same: "politi
cal expediency, appeasement of the
Republican extremists, party unity
at the price of national unity and
international influence."
RIPS ADMINISTRATION
Referring several times lo his l!). r >2
campaign visits to San Francisco;
Stevenson drew repeated bursts of
applause as he ripped apart the ad
ministration's foreign policy. He go)
the biggest laugh of the evening
when he mentioned the "smile and
smear technique of campaigning.
The President smiles while the Vice-
President smears."
World problems facing the United
States today, Stevenson said, include
"a trembling alliance in Europe, less
than confidence in Asia, the growing
attraction of monstrous China, Rus
sia's military and economic might,
a restless Africa, and a South Amer
ica we have taken for granted too
long."
We discard either world destruc
tion or world tyranny as solutions,
he continued. "The only course re
maining is co-existence, and I con
fess I get a little impatient wilh the
semantic debate for and against co
existence, for it i.s either co-exist
ence or no-existence."
However, the Democratic cam
paigner warned, "negotiation with
out strength, which some of our Eu
ropean friends seem to want, i.s mad
ness. Strength without negotiation
is futility .Negotiation on the basis
of strength and solidarity is the only
policy which can hold out hope to
patient and suffering mankind."
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS
With the election of a Democratic
Congress in November, Steven.-on
said, the United States "could move
from disunity, mutual recrimination,
and antagonism to that mutual re
spect and well-wishing which are
the pre-conditions of political ma
turity and responsibility."
In conclusion, he said: "The world
at the moment i.s in a long and dark
valley. Science offers us mass ex
termination. But it also offers the
world a greater abundance than we
have ever known. Our generation
will have to make a fateful choice.
"Just two years ago, here in San
Francisco, I said that: 'America has
been called to greatness. The sum
mons of the twentieth century is a
summons to our vision, to our hu
manity, to our practicality. If these
provide the common purpose of
America and Asia' (and I might have
added, of the free world), 'we need
have no fear for the future. Because
it will belong to free men.'
"I am still content to leave it there,
adding only that the Democratic
party i.s faithful to this vision and
ready to work with all like-minded
men and women in answering des
tiny's summons."


FOR A HAPPY BIRTHDAY—AdIai Stevenson, '52 Presidential candidate, shakes hands with
fellow Democrat Richard Graves at a Civic Auditorium rally in San Francisco Saturday night.
It was Graves' birthday. Stevenson spoke in behalf of Graves' campaign for Governor of Cali
fornia and Sam Yorty for the United States Senate. —Daily photo by Jack Byrne
While serpentine swirled from the balconies and a band blared
forth with "Happy Days Are Here Again," Adlai Stevenson
mounted the speakers' platform in San Francisco's Civic Audito
rium Saturday night and charged the Administration with placing
"the welfare of the right wing of the Republican party above the

welfare of the country."
Lashing out at the Republican
"Old Guard," the '52 Presiden
tial nominee said, "The administra
tion is trapped in a dilemma of its
making—it is trying to conduct a
responsible foreign policy and also
appease the extremist wing of the
Republican party.
"It is trying to reconcile the ir
reconcilable. And it acts as though it
was more important to unite the
Republican party than to unite our
country and the free world."
Citing inconsistencies beiween Re
publican words and policies, Steven
son said, "They talk tough to satisfy
the extremists and reduce the Army
and Air Force to satisfy the budget
cutters.
"Secretary Dulles demands united
action in Indonesia and settles for
united inaction, with nothing to
show for our part in the Geneva
Conference but the preposterous
boast that we had refused to speak
to our adversaries. Why? Because
the right wing of the Republicans
have successfully identified negotia
tion with appeasement."
"Over and over we are wobbly

We discard either world destruc

he continued. "The only course re

fess I get a little impatient wilh the
semantic debate for and against co
existence, for it i.s either co-exist

However, the Democratic cam
paigner warned, "negotiation with

DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS
With the election of a Democratic
Congress in November, Steven.-on
said, the United States "could move
from disunity, mutual recrimination,
and antagonism to that mutual re
spect and well-wishing which are
the pre-conditions of political ma
turity and responsibility."
In conclusion, he said: "The world
at the moment i.s in a long and dark
valley. Science offers us mass ex
termination. But it also offers the
world a greater abundance than we
have ever known. Our generation
will have to make a fateful choice.
"Just two years ago, here in San
Francisco, I said that: 'America has
been called to greatness. The sum
mons of the twentieth century is a
summons to our vision, to our hu
manity, to our practicality. If these
provide the common purpose of
America and Asia' (and I might have
added, of the free world), 'we need
have no fear for the future. Because
it will belong to free men.'
"I am still content to leave it there,
adding only that the Democratic
party i.s faithful to this vision and
ready to work with all like-minded
men and women in answering des
tiny's summons."

While serpentine swirled from the balconies and a band blared
forth with "Happy Days Are Here Again," Adlai Stevenson
mounted the speakers' platform in San Francisco's Civic Audito
rium Saturday night and charged the Administration with placing
"the welfare of the right wing of the Republican party above the

welfare of the country."
Lashing out at the Republican
"Old Guard," the '52 Presiden
tial nominee said, "The administra
tion is trapped in a dilemma of its
making—it is trying to conduct a
responsible foreign policy and also
appease the extremist wing of the
Republican party.
"It is trying to reconcile the ir
reconcilable. And it acts as though it
was more important to unite the
Republican party than to unite our
country and the free world."
Citing inconsistencies beiween Re
publican words and policies, Steven
son said, "They talk tough to satisfy
the extremists and reduce the Army
and Air Force to satisfy the budget
cutters.
"Secretary Dulles demands united
action in Indonesia and settles for
united inaction, with nothing to
show for our part in the Geneva
Conference but the preposterous
boast that we had refused to speak
to our adversaries. Why? Because
the right wing of the Republicans
have successfully identified negotia
tion with appeasement."
"Over and over we are wobbly
when we should be firm. . . . We
shake our fist and "then our finger.
Repeatedly we have bluffed friend
and foe alike."
HI I | | AND BLUSTER'
tn question after question Steven
'iii tore into the present "bluff and
bluster" foreign policy of the Re
publicans.
"Why in there no bi-partisanship
in the formulation of our foreign
policy these days? Why arc there
no Democrats in high positions in
President Eisenhower's administra
tion?
"Why have they cut economic and
tecHYiical assistance programs, just
as the Soviets venture into this

field? Why have they failed to keep
their foreign trade promises, just as
the Moscow - Peiping axis dangles
seductive trade proposals before our
hard-pressed friends?"
The answer to all these questions,
Stevenson said, is the same: "politi
cal expediency, appeasement of the
Republican extremists, party unity
at the price of national unity and
international influence."
RIPS ADMINISTRATION
Referring several times lo his l!). r >2
campaign visits to San Francisco;
Stevenson drew repeated bursts of
applause as he ripped apart the ad
ministration's foreign policy. He go)
the biggest laugh of the evening
when he mentioned the "smile and
smear technique of campaigning.
The President smiles while the Vice-
President smears."
World problems facing the United
States today, Stevenson said, include
"a trembling alliance in Europe, less
than confidence in Asia, the growing
attraction of monstrous China, Rus
sia's military and economic might,
a restless Africa, and a South Amer
ica we have taken for granted too
long."
We discard either world destruc
tion or world tyranny as solutions,
he continued. "The only course re
maining is co-existence, and I con
fess I get a little impatient wilh the
semantic debate for and against co
existence, for it i.s either co-exist
ence or no-existence."
