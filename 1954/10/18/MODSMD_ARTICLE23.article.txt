# UNESCO Chairman Lauds Stanford IIR
## 
### STEW TOY 
"Stanford students," Dr. Mil
ton Eisenhower said recently,
"are doing a job which might
well be imitated by other
schools throughout the land."
The recent chairman of the U.S.
j National Commission for UNESCO
and president of the University of
j Pennsylvania was referring to Stan
ford's Institute of International Re
lations, student-managed organiza
tion which promotes world under
standing on a college level.
Organized as a branch ol the AS
SU. the lIR acts as Stanford's "for
eign office." Its main purpose is to
"contribute to the maintenance of
peace and security through those
means most available to university
students: education and service."
This broad aim is achieved
! through such varied projects as the
maintenance of a Stanford Library
at the University of Naples, support
of a student center and dormitory
at New Delhi University in India,
and sponsoring of book and clothing
drives.
Since 1940 the Institute has main
tained on the Stanford campus a
U.N. Education Center, one of the
first and few in the nation. An offi
cial agency of the U.N., the Center
provides library facilities on world
affairs for Stanford and other stu
dents throughout the Pacific Coast
region.
SCHOLARSHIPS
An lIR scholarship program grants
several scholarships per year to de
serving foreign students. Several ol
the grants are reciprocal, allowing
Stanford students to attend colleges
in European countries.
The Host Department of the Insti
; tute assists the 300 foreign students

attending Stanford to become mem
bers of the Stanford Family. This
includes telling them about Stanford
traditions and showing them how
they can be active participants in
campus life.
An lIR Speakers' Bureau pro
vides qualified speakers, most of
whom are foreign students, for civic
and private clubs throughout the
Bay Area.
The lIP holds an annual Northern
California High School Conference
on UNESCO to promote good citi
zenship among high school students.
Benefit concerts are frequently
held to help raise funds for Insti
tute work. "The King's Men" quar
tet will appear Oct. 22 in Memorial
Auditorium to provide funds for a
scholarship for a student from the
Free University of Berlin.
STUDENT MEMBERSHIP
Staffed solely by students, the
Institute elects officers annually to
supervise its many duties. This
year's officers are A! Brouse, presi
dent; Ginny Waxman, vice - presi
dent; Joan Charvat, executive secre
tary; and Art Alexander, business
manager.
Although all Stanford students are
automatically members of the lIR
upon registration, the actual duties
of the Institute are carried out by
only 100 actively participating stu
dents.
Over the years the Institute has
collected and distributed over $25,-
000, carloads of clothes, and tons of
books to assist less fortunate stu
dents and educational institutions.
For the Institute's work in service
and education, Dr. Eisenhower went
on to say, "I know of no student
body which is doing more to educate
itself for world citizenship than the
student body of Stanford Univer
sity."
