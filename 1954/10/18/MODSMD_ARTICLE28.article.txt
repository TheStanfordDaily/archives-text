HIGH JUMP —Left end John Stewart goes skyward after a John
Brodie pass at Los Angeles Saturday. Although the Bruins came
out on top by a 72-0 score, the Cards completed 22 aerials for
203 yards against the Westwooders. The Uclans picked off eight
Indian passes during the day, and four of these led directly to
Bruin scores. Stewart was one of the few bright spots for the
Stanfords as he caught six passes for a total of 73 yards.
