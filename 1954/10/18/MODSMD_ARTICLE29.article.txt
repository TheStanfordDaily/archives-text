# Sanders Is Unemotional Over Bruin Scoring Spree

### PHIL BERMAN 
LOS ANGELES MEMORIAL COLISEUM, Oct. 16â€”For a coach
who had just won by a 72 to 0 avalanche, UCLA mentor Red San
ders seemed surprisingly unelated in the dressing room.
Sanders kept the same taciturn, unemotional countenance that
he possesses either in victory or defeat or on the practice field

think (he Stanford defense was
playing our fullbacks a little bit
tight and that allowed us to use our
end sweeps more."
Any comment on Stanford's of
fense was the next question.
"Stanford's passing attack was
hard to rush, but I was more sur
prised by their total disintegration
in the second half."

Possibly' a stranger" wandering into
the Bruin dressing room might have
thought he was seeing the defeated
coach, not the victorious one.
The obvious question first asked of
Sanders was had he deliberately
tried to run tip or hold down the
lopsided margin.
"We made no attempt to hold
down the score and the boys were
given no instructions to hold it
down," answered Sanders. 4 'We
just played our game and that's
the way it worked out."
The next query was how Sanders
thought the Bruin offense looked.
"We couldn't have asked for
more," he replied grudgingly. "I

Had UCLA made any vow to get
even with the Indians this season
after last year's 21 to 20 upset by the
Cards?
"I don't know about any vows,
hut we've thought a lot about last
year during this season and we
were ready for this game," an
swered Sanders in a Simon Legree
tone.
Far more enthused about the In
dian massacre was Vic Kelley, Bruin
sports publicist, who said, "So far
this season I've seen UCLA play its
only two perfect football games, first
against Maryland and then today."
But none of this gay spirit seemed
to rub off on Sanders as he left the
dressing room with the "Let's get
ready for next week's practice and
work ofit the-flaws of tp(!*iy,"..lpok. t -
You might remember UCLA did
n't kick a single extra point in the
fourth quarter when the Bruin mar
gin ballooned from 48 to 72 to 0,
Sanders was probably thinking
something has got to be done to rec
tify that.
