# Crowds Cheer As Candidates Deliver Views
## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
There were colored balloons, paper
streamers, noiscmakers, and people
â€”people who packed Civic Audito
rium to capacity and a little over,
people who cheered and waved ban
ners for their favorite candidates,
people who had come to hear Adlai
Stevenson.
They were in a mood to cheer.
They cheered a telegram from Ed
Roybal, candidate for Lieutenant
Governor. They applauded wildly
at a telegram from Mrs. Eleanor
Roosevelt. And they gave a stand
ing ovation when a telegram from
ex-President Harry S. Truman was
read.
Bands, drummers, and a group of
Irish bagpipers added to the spirit of
the occasion as the candidates were
introduced.
The crowd also gave a tremendous
hand to Representative Rrrbert L.
Condon, running for re-election in
the Contra Costa - Solano district.
Condon, who last year was barred
as a security risk from the atom
bomb test, in Las Vegas, received
prolonged applause when he ex
claimed:
"We don't want Nixon, we don't
want Dixon, and we don't want
Yates. And we're not children to be
frightened by the nasty words they
throw at us."
Both Sam Yorty, candidate for
U.S. Senator, and Richard Graves,
candidate for Governor, made short
speeches.
HARKS FOR WILSON
At one point in Yorty's speech,
I following a casual reference to Sec
retary of Defense Charles Wilson,
the audience broke into barks. When
the noise had died flown somewhat,
Yorty commented, "From the diver
! sity of harks I can't tell if they are
kennej dogs or bird dogs."
lie contemptuously referred to
Kuchel as ' my silent opponent" and

Ufs od how Kuchcl had refused to
J make a stand on McCarthy, on mov

; or the water problem.
GOI' NEW LOOK
Hitting out at, the Republicans,
: Graves said, "The Republican New
Look is as flat-busted us the Dior
New Look in fashions, and 1 pro
die! that, the people of California
will emphatically reject both."
He continued, "The Republicans
feel that the people must be the
servants of free enterprise, while we
Democrats believe that free enter
prise must be the servant of the
people."
Commenting on Democratic slo
! gans, Graves told the audience of
one that went: Roosevelt, New Deal;
Truman, Fair Deal; Stevenson, no
| deal; and Eisenhower, ordeal.
"However," he concluded, "My fa-
I vorite slogan is simply 'Proud to Be
