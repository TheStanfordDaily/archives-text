# CHIANG:
## Russia Plans To Launch War in 1956 
### 
TAIPEI, Oct. 17 (UP) â€” Presi
dent Chiang Kai-shek warned to
day that Russia would launch a
Pacific war in 1956.
He said it would begin upon
completion of a giant railroad
network which would link the Asian
and Eurasian land masses and run
across the China mainland from
north to south and west to east,
thereby giving Russia strategic dom
ination of the entire area.
President Chang told the United
Press in an exclusive interview that
it was a certainty that Soviet Rus
sia would have finished her war
preparations by the summer of 1956
and would start the war because the
free world made the unfortunate
mistake of allowing her to complete
the railway net.
Once Russia had the capacity to
move her vast land armies at will
across the great land masses, the
generalissimo said, she would no
longer be afraid of an air-sea war
with the United States and Britain.
Chiang said the recent joint Chi
nese Communist - Russian declara
tions were basically a smoke screen
to cover up from the peoples of
America and Europe the urgent
Communist preparations for Asian
domination.
He pointed out that one railroad
from Ulan Bator to Thining, which
is 750 miles in length and nearly
completed, would be finished next
summer, and another from Alma
Ata to Lanchow, which is 1,700 miles
long and partly constructed, would
be finished in the summer of 1956.
These would give the Communists
a vertical and horizontal connection
to the South China coast and into
the heart of China running off the
Russian Trans-Siberian Railway.
Wearing a military tunic, appear
ing in excellent health, and looking
a decade younger than his 67 years,
President Chang traced the proposed
Red rail network on a giant wall
map in his Taipei office.
