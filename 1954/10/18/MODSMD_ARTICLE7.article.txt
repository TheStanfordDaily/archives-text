(Compiled from UP Releases)
Death and destruction swept
areas of the eastern part of the
continent this week as a result
of hurricane Hazel and floods in
West Virginia.
President Eisenhower slashed
through government red tape and
ordered immediate "blank - check"
federal aid for wide areas of North
and South Carolina still reeling from
the onslaught of hurricane Hazel.
White House Press Secretary
James C. Hagerty, who announced
the unusual action, said "immediate
consideration" will be given similar
aid requests from any of nine other
states hit by the full-scale winds
of the storm, one of the worst ever
to rip the continent.
CANADA HIT
The hurricane, which left more
than 100 known dead with the toll
still rising, was blowing itself out
over northern Quebec today. But
rescue workers in this country,
Haiti, and Canada were continuing
the grim task of counting the dead
and restoring some semblance of
normal living.
In Toronto, scene of Ontario's
worst natural disaster, rescue crews
boated and waded through debris
left by floods which followed Hazel.
Crowds of anxious persons waited
at police stations and morgues for
word of missing relatives.
FLOOD WATERS
. In Wheeling, West Virginia, flood
waters washed their wave of death
and destruction from western Penn
sylvania through Wheeling and into
the upper Ohio River Valley today,
forcing more than 3,000 persons to
flee their homes.
The swirling waters inundated
about two-thirds of Wheeling Island
and poured into hundreds of homes
in low-lying South Wheeling and
neighboring West Virginia and Ohio
towns.
