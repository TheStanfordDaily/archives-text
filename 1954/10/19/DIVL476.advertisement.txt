THE
ALUMINUM INDUSTRY
WAS BORN ON
A Ny In 1888, the aluminum industry consisted of one company—
located in an unimpressive little building on the east side ot
STREET Pittsburgh. It was called The Pittsburgh Reduction Company.
The men of'this company had real engineering abilities and
viewed the work to be done with an imagineering eye. But
they were much more than that. 1 hey were pioneeis . . .
leaders . . . men of vision.
A lot has happened since 1 888. The country ... the
company .. . and the industry have grown { up. Te;ij «
territories have become states, for one thing. The total
industry now employs more than 1,000,000 people
and the little outfit on Smallman Street? Well, it's a lot
bigger, too—and the name has been changed to Alcoa.
Aluminum Company of America . . . but its still the
leader—still the place for engineering "firsts."
As you prepare to trade textbooks for a position in
industry, consider the advantages of joining a
