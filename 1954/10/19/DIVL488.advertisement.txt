enthuses over Jockey brand underwear
Impeccably groomed Chisley J. Chisley ("Chi-chi"
to his friends) says,"I like new-fashion fashion and
old-fashion comfort. For instance, this week I give
the nod to tartan cummerbunds and ascots of shock
ing pink — but every week I go for the at-case feeling
of Jockey shorts! Take it from a clothes-horse . . .
never say Neigh to Jockey comfort!"
Whether you share Chisley's taste for sartorial
splendor or not, you'll enjoy the casual, at-ease ap
pearance that comes from wearing Jockey shorts.
Better drop into your dealer's soon . . . buy ;i supply
of Jockey shorts and T-shirts . . . and feel as good as
you look!
it's in style to be comfort able... in
underwear
