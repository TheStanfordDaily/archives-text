# Berlin Scholar Rottka Views This 'Wonderful University'
## 
### 
(Editor's note: The following
letter \v;ts written by Eckart
Kollka, •■tudent from Berlin. He
is at Stanford this year, due to
efforts of the Berlin Afliliation
Committee of the Institute of
International Relations, which
has established a scholarship as
part of its program of affiliation
with the Free University of
Berlin.
(Now the Affiliation Commit
tee is hard at work, raising
money for a scholarship that
will enable another student to
come next year. Friday tliey
will present "The King's Men
Quartet" in a benefit concert at
Memorial Auditorium, at
p.m.
(In reference to "The King's
Men," President Wallace Ster
ling sa»d, "I recommend them
as a ft roup who will present an
interesting and delightful pro
gram."
(Tickets for the concert,
priced from $1 to $2.50, are on
sale at the Concert Series of
fice in the Nitery, from 1 to 5
p.m. today through Friday, and
on Quad.)

"Whore did you learn your tre
mendous English?"
'In Stanford, California" was
the answer.
"That was the first time I ever
heard the name of this wonderful
University. From Rudy Geissler
(the exchange student from the
Free University of Berlin in 1952-
53), who came back in April 1953
and took on an important job in
our student government.
"As his secretary I heard more
about Stanford University, about
the affiliation between our two
universities, and I met the mem
bers of the Stanford Affiliation
Committee in Berlin, of whom
three had already been at Stan
lord.
"I saw the preparations which
were made for the arrival of Joan
Steindorf, the scholar from Stan
lord, and I began to learn what a

wonderful institution this Stan
ford family must be. I discussed
student government problems
with former Stanfordites, and my
interest about Stanford's handling
of student problems grew every
day.
"In the winter of 1953-54 we re
ceived the generous gift of $700

to aid some of our poorest stu
dents who escaped from the So
viet Zone. Stanford sent clothing
parcels, and we were happy to be
able to give Stanford's help to the
poorest of us. These facts showed
me the great interest Stanfordites
take in overseas and especially in
Berlin problems and affairs.
"Finally I decided to apply for
the Berlin Afliliation Committee
scholarship administered by the
ASSU Foreign Scholarship Com
mittee; I wanted to see for myself
how it would be possible that
across thousands of miles, stu
dents could be interested in us
and how they could afford to help
us, besides taking care of their

own problems.
"After several more interviews
for my FuLbright Travel Grant, I
really came to Stanford. Already
on the boat every American con
gratulated me on this wonderful
year of experience I am going to
have. And from the very first
day of my stay here I began to
congratulate myself again and
again. I was amazed by the
friendly atmosphere I found. Ev
ery day I experienced the en
thusiasm which prevailed when
youth meets youth.
"My scholarship includes tui
tion for three quarters, which was
provided half by the administra
tion — the other half was raised
through the Berlin Affiliation
Committee from private sources.
Three different fraternities (Sig
ma Nu, Phi Gamma Delta, and
Delta Upsilon) gave me room,
board, and spending money.
"Already after two weeks I
made so many friends that I can
not even remember all their
names. My brothers in the Sigma
Nu house immediately made me
feel at home, 112 found a consider
able interest in Berlin fn this
house, largely due to Rudy Geiss
ler's stay with the Sigma Nu's.
"I feel that the personal ex
change is very important for
growing understanding between
the two universities. After all
these experiences I am sorry that
not more Berlin students can
come to Stanford. I think we
have to do everything to continue
this exchange and give other Free
University students the opportu
nity to learn about the people and
especially the academic youth in
the United States.
"The benefit concert on Oct. 22
with the "King's Men" quartet is
an . excellent way to enable Stan
ford to bring a Berlin student
here. The profit of this concert
will be used to bring a stydent
from the Free University of Ber
lin over here in 1955-56."
