# MENDES-FRANCE
## New Bid For U.S. Aid In Arms Pool 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 18 (UP)—Authori
tative sources said tonight on
the eve of a German rearma
ment showdown that Premier
Mendes-France had renewed an
appeal to the United States for
more and stronger controls to
safeguard France from any pos
sibility of aggression.
Mendes-France urged the United
States to back his already rejected
scheme for a continental arms pool
and a West European agency to dole
out American aid as it see fit, in
formants said.
They reported the Premier reop
ened the whole issue of arms con
trol last week in a long talk with
U.S. Ambassador C. Douglas Dillon.
SAAR DISPUTE
Tomorrow Mendes-France and
Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of
West Germany will tackle the prob
lem of what to do about the Saar.
The meeting kicks off a series of
negotiations and consultations which
Western leaders hoped to climax
Saturday with final accords on the
substitute for the dead European
defense community.
The goal was admission of West
Germany into the North Atlantic
Treaty organization and the Brus
sels Treaty, restoration of sover
eignty, and authorization of an army
of 500,000 men.
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles turned down Mendes-France's
request for an arms pool and the
channeling of aid through a Euro
pean agency at the London confer
ence last month.
SITUATION CHANGED
But now the situation was re
ported to have changed—sufficiently,
at least, to prompt Mendes-France's
renewal of his proposition.
Authoritative sources intimated
that Dulles might have yielded from
his firm stand when he arrives Wed
nesday for the new round of con
sultations.
