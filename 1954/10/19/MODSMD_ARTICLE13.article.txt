WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 (UP) -
Secretary of State John Foster Dul
les held an hour-long strategy hud
dle with President Eisenhower to
day. He wiil fly to Paris tomorrow
for meetings on the crucial German
rearmament problems.
Although Dulles declined to ex
press his feelings about this week's
European conference, a State De
partment aide said the Secretary
feels "quite optimistic" that Ameri
ca's allies will agree on a plan to
bring West German troops into the
anti-Communist alliance.
Dulles will meet with British,
French, and German leaders Wed
nesday to sign a series of agreements
formally ending the Big Three's
nine-year occupation of West Ger
many.
On Thursday, he will sit in on a
meeting of Brussels Pact nations
while they consider admission of
Germany and Italy and other mem
bers clearing the way for German
rearmament. The United States is
not a memibcr of the Brussels Pact.
After this meeting with Mr. Eisen
hower, Dulles told reporters: "I'm
not going into the optimism game.
We arc jus't going to do the best we
can."
But an aide said, "Dulles feels
quite confident and optimistic that
the agreement reached in London
will be implemented without much
problem." The United States and
its allies agreed "in principle" at
London two weeks ago that Ger
many should be rearmed and admit
ted into the anti-Red camp.
