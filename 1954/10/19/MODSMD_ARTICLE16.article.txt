# Men's Council Puts 5 Frosh On Probation
## 
### 
Five freshman men were given a
sentence of one year's probation by
the Men's Council at their meeting
last night.
All five had entered a plea of
guilty.
One of the five was given 15 Con
Home hours in addition to the pro
bation.
The five, of which two were min
ors and the other three juveniles,
were arrested September 25 for pos
session of alcohol, and turned over
to the council by municipal authori
ties.
The council emphasized to the
men that the case had been turned
over to them because they were
Stanford students, and were thus re
garded as above-average citizens.
The one year probation specifies
that they will be subject to suspen
sion by the council at their dcscre
tion for any further misconduct in
the remainder of their freshman
year.
The student who was given the
Con Home hours, had purchased
beer using a false identification
card.
The council plans to take the
stand in the future that possession
of a false ID will be regarded as a
"premeditated attempt to deceive,
and hence a violation of the Funda
mental Standard."
