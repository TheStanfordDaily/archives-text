# Streit Voices Dangers Of World War and Depression
## 
### JAE HUNLEY 
"We face two dangers in the modern world, that of another
world war and that of a major economic depression. It seems to
me that we are much more endangered by an economic de
pression."
This statement was made by Clarence K. Streit in a talk in

Cubberley Auditorium last night.
Streit said, "We are maintaining
conditions of anarchy in the name
of liberty . . . through our perfec
tion of a system of, mass production
and mass instruction.
"We unite people by means of in
vention, and we splinter the free
world by. political notions, refusing
a government among ourselves be
cause of ideas of individual liberty.
"I believe that if we do not start

within a year to federate an Atlan
tic democracy ... we will be faced
with another major depression with
in two or three years."
Strcit, who is in favor of a gov
ernmental union among the powers
bordering on the Atlantic, stated,
"The way to peace that we have
been following is to creatc more and
more sovereign nations with no
workable means of government
among them.
"We have had the League of Na
tions, and now we have the United
Nations and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, but none of
these offer an effective means of
government. All form what Alex
ander Hamilton called a 'political
monstrosity,' all association of gov
ernments."
j Streit pointed out that the last 50
years have seen seven "epoch-mak
ing events," ranging from aviation to
women suffrage. "All of these have
been founded on ideas which origi
nated in the area of the Atlantic
communities.
"I think that we would be much
better off if wc had one government
for determining foreign policy for
people in the Atlantic area. If wc
discuss this possibility of uniting,
wc will be practicing liberty as our
forefathers saw it."
Streit, whose talk was sponsored
by the Political Science Department,
was introduced by Dr. Graham Stu
