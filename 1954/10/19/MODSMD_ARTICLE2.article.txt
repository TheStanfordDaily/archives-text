# Dr. Freidel to Be First Political Union Speaker
## 
### 
Dr. Frank Freidel, associate professor of history at Stanford and
nationally recognized authority on Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
will be the first guest speaker of the year at the Stanford Po
litical Union meeting Thursday night at Cubberley Auditorium.

"A Change in '52: Yes or No?"
will be Dr. Freidel's topic, giving a
survey of Roosevelt's major policies
and their effect on current party
platforms. Whether or not the Re
publicans brought a change in 1952,
as they promised, will be the focal
point in the discussion. Dr. Freidel
has stated that he will not take a
partisan stand on the resolution, but
will draw a factual picture as he
sees it.
The Union will follow its policy of
student participation by having a
student opposition speaker reply to
the main address, after which the
topic will be opened to floor debate.
Dr. Freidel, who is beginning his
second year at Stanford, is currently
working on the third book of his
six-volume biography of FDR. "Ap
prentice" and "Ordeal," the first two
volumes, have previously been pub
lished by Little, Brown and Com
pany. Dr. Freidel taught the popular
"Age of Roosevelt" course here, in
addition to other United States his
tory courses.
This will be the first Political Un
ion general meeting of the year.
The Union is composed of three
caucuses, Democratic, Republican,
and Independent, and is open to all
interested students.
