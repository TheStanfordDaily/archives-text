UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 18 (UP)
—Soviet Chief Delegate Andrei Vi
shinsky rejected today an emotional
appeal that Russia waive its veto in
the United Nations Security Council
in the event that Russia should be
accused of violating an agreement to
abolish nuclear weapons.
Victor Andre Belaunde, 70-year
old Peruvian delegate, pleaded al
most tearfully with Vishinsky in the
United Nations Political Committee
that Russia make a real disarma
ment agreement possible by waiving
the veto.
"I beg, I plead with the Soviet
Union to give us proof of its sin
cerity. The acid test, the Final test,
the final yes or no is the veto."
"Is the destiny of the world such
a fragile reed that such powerful
emotional expositions are warrant
ed?" Vishinsky replied sarcastically.
"If the great powers reach a deci
sion against a state by a majority,
then the one that disagreed could
be made to submit to that decision
only by force, and this means war,"
Vishinsky said.
"There will be no disarmament
without the abolition of the veto,"
Belaunde retorted. "The veto is a
legal right. Is it a moral right?"
"The Soviet Union is not here to
prove anything and we do not in
tend to prove anything as regards
our sincerity, our good will, etc.,"
Vishinsky replied.
