# Matt Armitage Breaks Leg
## Cards Lose Senior Guard For Season 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Stanford's rapidly - dropping
football stock took another sud
den—and totally unexpected—
fall yesterday afternoon as a
practice injury caused the loss
of guard Matt Armitage for the
remainder of the season.
Armitage, one of the three seniors
in the starting lineup, suffered a
multiple fracture of the lower left
leg. The break was located about
five inches above the ankle. Both
bones were fractured.
The squad was running through
kick returns when the accident oc
curred. Armitage, acting as an of
fensive guard, was running inter
ference for the ball-carrier when he
was hit hard by one of the defensive
players.
This play was to have been the
last one of the lengthy scrimmage.
AMBULANCE ORDERED
Trainer Connie Jarvis immediately
ordered an ambulance and gave Ar
mitage as much aid as possible until
it arrived. Armitage was taken to
the Palo Alto Hospital.
The cost of Armitage's injury can
be estimated by the fact that only
yesterday noon at the Alumni Asso
ciation meeting in San Francisco
Armitage was awarded the-first an
nual Bob Mathias Sportsmanship
Trophy.
A 204-pounder from Fresno, Ar
mitage is a three-year letterman. He
was a standout defensive guard in
1952 under the two-platoon system.
Armitage was shifted to tackle lasl
year, but did not show up well in
(hat position. However, he did well
enough to play 307 minutes at tackle
last season.
This fall Armitage returned to his


END OF THE ROAD Matt Armitage, being wheeled into the Palo Alto Hospital on a stretcher,
came to the almost certain end of his college football career yesterday when he broke his leg
on the last play of the day's practice. Assisting Armitage above are Stanford trainer Connie
Jarvis and an ambulance attendent. Roy Krickeberg has been named to fill Armitage's position
at left guard. —Daily photo by Ken Green
old position at guard where he was
described by Coach Chuck Taylor
as "one of the most important men
in the Stanford line."
Armitage's place in the Cards' for
ward wall will be taken by Roy
Krickeiberg, a seasoned 205 - pound
senior. Tony Mosich will go in the
other guard spot.
DOCTER OUT
The Indians now are certain to
open against Washington Saturday
minus the services of still another
starter. Steve Docter, the big, rug
ged end from Santa Barbara, is defi
nitely out with a wrenched knee
suffered in the UCLA fiasco.
Sophomore halfback Bob Burget
also suffered an injury, a wrenched
knee, in the bruising scrimmage yes
terday. Burget may be in shape by
the end of the week, however.
Backs Ernie Dorn, Jerry Gustaf
son, and Dorsey Atkinson, and line
men Chris Marshall and Paul Wig
gin sat out the grueling season with
injuries.
OTHER INJURIES
Dorn and Marshall are under ob
servation for head injuries. Wiggin
has a badly bruised knee. Gustafson
still has an injured thumb from the
UCLA game, while Atkinson has a
strained big toe.
All are expected to be in shape by
tomorrow.
Taylor plans to continue with all
out scrimmages similar to yester
day's in this week's practice sessions.

Krickeiberg, a seasoned 205 - pound

other guard spot.
DOCTER OUT
The Indians now are certain to

son, and Dorsey Atkinson, and line
men Chris Marshall and Paul Wig
gin sat out the grueling season with
injuries.
OTHER INJURIES

servation for head injuries. Wiggin
has a badly bruised knee. Gustafson
still has an injured thumb from the
UCLA game, while Atkinson has a
strained big toe.
All are expected to be in shape by
tomorrow.
Taylor plans to continue with all
out scrimmages similar to yester

MATT ARMITAGE
—A block, then a had break
Stanford's rapidly - dropping
football stock took another sud
den—and totally unexpected—
fall yesterday afternoon as a
practice injury caused the loss
of guard Matt Armitage for the
remainder of the season.
Armitage, one of the three seniors
in the starting lineup, suffered a
multiple fracture of the lower left
leg. The break was located about
five inches above the ankle. Both
bones were fractured.
The squad was running through
kick returns when the accident oc
curred. Armitage, acting as an of
fensive guard, was running inter
ference for the ball-carrier when he
was hit hard by one of the defensive
players.
This play was to have been the
last one of the lengthy scrimmage.
AMBULANCE ORDERED
Trainer Connie Jarvis immediately
ordered an ambulance and gave Ar
mitage as much aid as possible until
it arrived. Armitage was taken to
the Palo Alto Hospital.
The cost of Armitage's injury can
be estimated by the fact that only
yesterday noon at the Alumni Asso
ciation meeting in San Francisco
Armitage was awarded the-first an
nual Bob Mathias Sportsmanship
Trophy.
A 204-pounder from Fresno, Ar
mitage is a three-year letterman. He
was a standout defensive guard in
1952 under the two-platoon system.
Armitage was shifted to tackle lasl
year, but did not show up well in
(hat position. However, he did well
enough to play 307 minutes at tackle
last season.
