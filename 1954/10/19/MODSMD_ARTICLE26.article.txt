# Matt Armitage Breaks Leg
## Cards Lose Senior Guard For Season 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Stanford's rapidly - dropping
football stock took another sud
den—and totally unexpected—
fall yesterday afternoon as a
practice injury caused the loss
of guard Matt Armitage for the
remainder of the season.
Armitage, one of the three seniors
in the starting lineup, suffered a
multiple fracture of the lower left
leg. The break was located about
five inches above the ankle. Both
bones were fractured.
The squad was running through
kick returns when the accident oc
curred. Armitage, acting as an of
fensive guard, was running inter
ference for the ball-carrier when he
was hit hard by one of the defensive
players.
This play was to have been the
last one of the lengthy scrimmage.
AMBULANCE ORDERED
Trainer Connie Jarvis immediately
ordered an ambulance and gave Ar
mitage as much aid as possible until
it arrived. Armitage was taken to
the Palo Alto Hospital.
The cost of Armitage's injury can
be estimated by the fact that only
yesterday noon at the Alumni Asso
ciation meeting in San Francisco
Armitage was awarded the-first an
nual Bob Mathias Sportsmanship
Trophy.
A 204-pounder from Fresno, Ar
mitage is a three-year letterman. He
was a standout defensive guard in
1952 under the two-platoon system.
Armitage was shifted to tackle lasl
year, but did not show up well in
(hat position. However, he did well
enough to play 307 minutes at tackle
last season.
This fall Armitage returned to his
