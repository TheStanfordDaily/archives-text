It's a good team.
It was a good Stanford team that traveled to
Los Angeles, and a good team that fought right
down to the end of the game against a UCLA
scoring machine that got every conceivable
break and could do no wrong, it seemed.
And it's a good Stanford team that's back on
campus now, getting ready to beat Washington
this Saturday and win a few more games after
that.
Seventy-two points to none is a score big
enough to make any team want to forget about
football and just about everything else. But
the Indian team still wants to play football.
They want to play ball and win games, and
they have the stuff to do it.
It's also easy for rooters to give up on a team
that has lost by a score like that. It's even easier
for the rooters to give up than it is for the team.
This Indian team won't give up. The Indians
showed that against C.0.P., when they came

from behind to win, and against Oregon, when
they invaded the Duck's country to trounce the
highly-rated Northwesterners, and against Il
linois, when Mickey Bates and J. C. Caroline
couldn't run because a fighting Stanford line
wouldn't let them. And when they played the
Navy, they were accused of "letting down."
But they didn't give up; they were still moving
that ball at the end of the game.
A University of Washington team better than
its record would indicate will come to Stanford
to test our football team this Saturday. And
Stanford's team can beat them; don't be sur
prised if Stanford bounces back to tear the
Husky apart.
That's the kind of team we have; they aren't
licked yet! On the line and in the backfield, on
the turf or the bench, they'll be out after more
wins the <rest of this year. And a team like
that deserves our support —ALL of it —and we
can assure them they'll get it.
