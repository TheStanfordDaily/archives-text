There's music in the air.
On Friday night, the renowned King's Men
Quartet will come to Stanford, with a repetoire
of songs ranging from popular to spiritual to
light classical.
In itself, this concert is worthwhile. But there
is more to it than just an evening's entertain
ment. For the King's Men have been brought
to Stanford for a purpose.
The benefits from this concert, sponsored
by the Berlin Affiliation Committee of the In
stitute of International Relations, will go to
bring a student from the Free University of
Berlin to study at Stanford next year.

But this student will do more than simply
study. He will have an opportunity to see de
mocracy in action, to partake in our student
government, to learn what it's like to live in the
United States.
When he returns to Germany, he will carry
with him a picture of America to show to his
friends —a picture that might help to correct
erroneous or uninformed views about America
or Americans.
The King's Men recital is more than just
another concert. It may be looked upon as an
other step toward international understanding.
