# CAMPUS OPINION
## Thanks to the 'Faithful' 
### 
To the Stanford Studentrßody:
Sunday afternoon at 1 our football team returned
from Los Angeles by plane. Needless to say, the
players were very dejected after their tough defeat
to UCLA.
As we pulled into the airport, we saw close to 200
Stanford students gathered there to greet us, give a
few cheers and pats on the back, and generally bring
a ray of sunshine to the boys.
I want to take this opportunity to thank that group
for their wonderful effort and support, despite the
one-sidedness of the final score. The team was unable
to express at that time their appreciation of the greet
ing. But you can be sure that because of that wel
come their spirits picked up tremendously.
I want the students who were there to know that I
too, as coach, also got a tremendous lift from the
greeting. It is not a difficult chore to join a band
wagon when things are rosey and the team is win
ning. But it takes a great deal of courage and in
testinal fortitude to stick with a club when they've
had some bad luck and lost a few games.
We didn't have a chance of winning the game ac
cording to the scoreboard; but those students who
attended the game know we really didn't look that
bad. UCLA will undoubtedly be the toughest team

we Tace this season, and despite the loss I saw a great
improvement in certain aspects of our play.
This weekend we will play Washington, a team
which lost to the Biuins by but one point. Yet t don't
believe for a minute we should be considered out of
the running in this Saturday's game. With continued
support as was shown at the airport Sunday, we could
win both that and more than one other game the
remainder of this season.
Again, my thanks to the faithful who helped the
team over a rough mental bump Sunday.
Sincerely,
CHARLES A. "Chuck" TAYLOR

We feel that the eating clubs should be given a
special vote of thanks for the wonderful lunch they
gave the Row girls two Saturday's ago. It was un
doubtedly the best social function the Row has been
to for a long time.
