# BULL SESSION

### JACK BYRNE 
Shed a tear, good men of Toyon, for progress Is
taking its toll.
At the end of the past week, I was v/ending my
accustomed way across the field that separates Toyon
and Crothers. The field, 1 noted, was covered with
surveyor's stakes.
"Ahah," I thought to myself, "they're going to pave
this so I won't get my shoes dusty coming across
here. So very thoughtful of them."
The next day, as I crossed the field, I found myself
chased by a man riding a snorting behemoth, push
ing a load of dirt in front of him.

"Gedoffa here!" he shouted
pleasantly.
I gottoffa. I know when I'm
licked. My path has fallen to
progress for a new crop of en
gineers, so that they can go pound
stakes in some vacant lot and
chase people around with D-8
tractors.
But. fellow denizens of Toyon,
this is not the only indignity
heaped on us.

Those of you with the appraising and observing
eye will note they have installed new electroliers on
Escondido Road between the Quad and Branner.
What was once the pleasantest of strolls home with
your girl is now roughly comparable to stepping into

the spotlight at a national political convention. The
area postively drips lumens.
Those of you who are by now deploring the limited
audience of this column get your warning now.
In the process of expanding to the north of the
Campus with a shopping center, the University has
let a road cross Palm Drive.
Now I don't mind roads per se. But what I do
mind is ihat they're going to put a stop* light in out
thorp
Every time the county discovers they've got $7.93
that is not earmarked, they put in a four-way stop.
Just drive to Los Altos and back some time if you
don't believe me.
But if they can stir up a thousand bucks or so,
Wow! They put in a super duper nine-way traffic
signal system, so arranged that the green light for
the way you want to go comes on semi-annually.
Try the California Avenue-Alma Street-Southern
Pacific crossing for the world's best example of this.
So there it is. Stanford roads, never good, aren't
getting any better from the armies of earth-moving
machines rolling over them. Another stop light
doesn't look like the answer this time.
Maybe when all of the new building program is
completed, or with luck, a little sooner, the Board
of Trustees will lavish a little loving care and money
on Stanford roads.
But skip the lights, please.
