STUDYING MADE SIMPLE
I have passed my thirty-fifth birthday, and my dewlaps droop and
my transmission needs oil. More and more my eyes turn inward,
reminiscing, sifting- the past, browsing lovingly among my souvenirs,
for at my time of life memories are all a man has.
And most precious are the memories of college. It still makes my
pulses quicken and my old glands leap to life just to think of it.
Ah, I was something then! "Swifty" my friends used to call me,
or "Rakehell" or "Candle-at-both-Ends" or "Devil Take the Hind
most." INIy phone was ringing all the time. "Come on, Devil-Take-the
llindmost," a cohort would say, "let's pile into the old convertible
arid live up a storm. 1 know a place that serves all-bran after hours."
So it went—night after mad night, kicks ypon kicks, sport that
wrinkled care derides, laughter holding both his sides. "Come on,
"Candle-at-Both-Ends," my companions would plead, "sing us an
other two hundred verses of Sweet Violets."
"No, my companions," I would reply with a gqntle but firm smile,
"we must turn homeward, for the cock has long since crowed."
" 'Twas not the cock," they would answer, laughing merrily.
" 'Twas Sam Leghorn doing his imitation of a chicken!"
And, sure enough, 'twas. Crazy, madcap Sam Leghorn. How I
miss his gaiety and wit! I never tired of hearing his imitation of
a chicken, nor he of giving it. 1 wonder what's become of him. Last
1 heard he was working as a weathervane in Tacoma.
Oh, we were a wild and jolly gang in those days. There was Sam
Leghorn with his poultry imitations. There was Mazda Watts who
plways wrtro a lampshade op her head. There was -Freddie Comp
who stole a dean. There was Cap Queeg who always curried tWb
steel marbles in his hand. There was Emily Hamp who gilded her
house mother.
Yes, we were wild and jolly, and the wildest and jolliest was I . . .
But not right away. I blush to admit that in my freshman year I
was dull, stodgy, and normal. I finally corrected this loathesome
condition, but for a while it was touch and go. And, dear reader—
especially dear freshman reader—be warned: it can happen to you.
Trie makers uf Philip Morris have bought this space T ran
bring you a message each week. There is no more important message
1 can give you than the following: College can be beautiful. Don't
louse it up with studying.
That was my mistake. At first, cowed by college, I studied so much
that I turned into a dreary, blinking creature, subject to dry-mouth
and fainting fits. For a year this dismal condition prevailed—but
then 1 learned the real function of college. And what is that? I'll tell
you what: to prepare you to face the realities of the world. And
what do you need to face the realities of the world? I'll tell you
what — poise, that's what you need. And how do you get poise? I'll
tell you how: not by keeping your nose in a book, you may In; sure!
Relax! Live! Enjoy! . . . That's how you get poise. Of course you
have to study, but be poised about it. Don't be like some clods
who spend every single night buried in a book. Not only are they not
learning poise; they are also eroding their eyeballs. The truly poised
student knows better than to make the whole semester hideous with
studying, fle knows that the night before the exam is plenty of time
to study.
Yes, I've heard that lots of people have condemned cramming. But
have yon heard who these people are? They are the electric light and
power interests, that's who! They want you to sit up late and study
every night so you'll use more electricity and enrich their bulging
coffers. Don't be a sucker!
Clearly, cramming is the only sensible way to study. But beware!
Even cramming can be overdone. Take it easy. On the night before
your exam, eat a hearty dinner. Then get a date and go out and eat
another hearty dinner. Then go park someplace and light up a
Philip Morris. Enjoy the peaceful pleasure it otters. Don't go
home until you're good and relaxed.
Once at home, relax. Do not, however, fall asleep. This is too
relaxed. To insure wakefulness, choose a chair that is not too
comfortable. For example, take a chair with nails pointing up
through the seat—or a chair in which somebody is already sitting.
Place several packs of Philip Morris within easy reach. Good
mild tobacco helps you to relax, and that's what Philip Morris is—
good mild tobacco. But Philip Morris is more than just good mild
tobacco; it is also cigarette paper to keep the good mild tobacco from
spilling all over the place.
Now you've got the uncomfortable chair and the Philip Morris.
Now yoii need light. Use the lit end of your Philip Morris. Do not
enrich the electric power interests.
Read your textbook in a slow, poised manner. Do not underline. It
reduces the re-sale value of your book. Always keep your books in
prime re-sale condition; you never know when you'll need getaway
money.
As you read you will no doubt come across many things you don't
understand. But don't panic. Relax. Play some records. Remove a
callus. Go out and catch some night crawlers.
Relax- Be poised. Stay loose. And remember—if things really close
in, you can always take up teaching.

have yon heard who these people are? They are the electric light and
power interests, that's who! They want you to sit up late and study
every night so you'll use more electricity and enrich their bulging
coffers. Don't be a sucker!
Clearly, cramming is the only sensible way to study. But beware!
Even cramming can be overdone. Take it easy. On the night before
your exam, eat a hearty dinner. Then get a date and go out and eat
another hearty dinner. Then go park someplace and light up a
Philip Morris. Enjoy the peaceful pleasure it otters. Don't go
home until you're good and relaxed.
Once at home, relax. Do not, however, fall asleep. This is too
relaxed. To insure wakefulness, choose a chair that is not too
comfortable. For example, take a chair with nails pointing up
through the seat—or a chair in which somebody is already sitting.
Place several packs of Philip Morris within easy reach. Good
mild tobacco helps you to relax, and that's what Philip Morris is—
good mild tobacco. But Philip Morris is more than just good mild
tobacco; it is also cigarette paper to keep the good mild tobacco from
spilling all over the place.
Now you've got the uncomfortable chair and the Philip Morris.
Now yoii need light. Use the lit end of your Philip Morris. Do not
enrich the electric power interests.
Read your textbook in a slow, poised manner. Do not underline. It
reduces the re-sale value of your book. Always keep your books in
prime re-sale condition; you never know when you'll need getaway
money.
As you read you will no doubt come across many things you don't
understand. But don't panic. Relax. Play some records. Remove a
callus. Go out and catch some night crawlers.
Relax- Be poised. Stay loose. And remember—if things really close
in, you can always take up teaching.

STUDYING MADE SIMPLE
I have passed my thirty-fifth birthday, and my dewlaps droop and
my transmission needs oil. More and more my eyes turn inward,
reminiscing, sifting- the past, browsing lovingly among my souvenirs,
for at my time of life memories are all a man has.
And most precious are the memories of college. It still makes my
pulses quicken and my old glands leap to life just to think of it.
Ah, I was something then! "Swifty" my friends used to call me,
or "Rakehell" or "Candle-at-both-Ends" or "Devil Take the Hind
most." INIy phone was ringing all the time. "Come on, Devil-Take-the
llindmost," a cohort would say, "let's pile into the old convertible
arid live up a storm. 1 know a place that serves all-bran after hours."
So it went—night after mad night, kicks ypon kicks, sport that
wrinkled care derides, laughter holding both his sides. "Come on,
"Candle-at-Both-Ends," my companions would plead, "sing us an
other two hundred verses of Sweet Violets."
"No, my companions," I would reply with a gqntle but firm smile,
"we must turn homeward, for the cock has long since crowed."
" 'Twas not the cock," they would answer, laughing merrily.
" 'Twas Sam Leghorn doing his imitation of a chicken!"
And, sure enough, 'twas. Crazy, madcap Sam Leghorn. How I
miss his gaiety and wit! I never tired of hearing his imitation of
a chicken, nor he of giving it. 1 wonder what's become of him. Last
1 heard he was working as a weathervane in Tacoma.
Oh, we were a wild and jolly gang in those days. There was Sam
Leghorn with his poultry imitations. There was Mazda Watts who
plways wrtro a lampshade op her head. There was -Freddie Comp
who stole a dean. There was Cap Queeg who always curried tWb
steel marbles in his hand. There was Emily Hamp who gilded her
house mother.
Yes, we were wild and jolly, and the wildest and jolliest was I . . .
But not right away. I blush to admit that in my freshman year I
was dull, stodgy, and normal. I finally corrected this loathesome
condition, but for a while it was touch and go. And, dear reader—
especially dear freshman reader—be warned: it can happen to you.
Trie makers uf Philip Morris have bought this space T ran
bring you a message each week. There is no more important message
1 can give you than the following: College can be beautiful. Don't
louse it up with studying.
That was my mistake. At first, cowed by college, I studied so much
that I turned into a dreary, blinking creature, subject to dry-mouth
and fainting fits. For a year this dismal condition prevailed—but
then 1 learned the real function of college. And what is that? I'll tell
you what: to prepare you to face the realities of the world. And
what do you need to face the realities of the world? I'll tell you
what — poise, that's what you need. And how do you get poise? I'll
tell you how: not by keeping your nose in a book, you may In; sure!
Relax! Live! Enjoy! . . . That's how you get poise. Of course you
have to study, but be poised about it. Don't be like some clods
who spend every single night buried in a book. Not only are they not
learning poise; they are also eroding their eyeballs. The truly poised
student knows better than to make the whole semester hideous with
studying, fle knows that the night before the exam is plenty of time
to study.

Leghorn with his poultry imitations. There was Mazda Watts who
plways wrtro a lampshade op her head. There was -Freddie Comp
who stole a dean. There was Cap Queeg who always curried tWb
steel marbles in his hand. There was Emily Hamp who gilded her
house mother.
Yes, we were wild and jolly, and the wildest and jolliest was I . . .
But not right away. I blush to admit that in my freshman year I
was dull, stodgy, and normal. I finally corrected this loathesome
condition, but for a while it was touch and go. And, dear reader—
especially dear freshman reader—be warned: it can happen to you.
Trie makers uf Philip Morris have bought this space T ran
bring you a message each week. There is no more important message
1 can give you than the following: College can be beautiful. Don't
louse it up with studying.
That was my mistake. At first, cowed by college, I studied so much
that I turned into a dreary, blinking creature, subject to dry-mouth
and fainting fits. For a year this dismal condition prevailed—but
then 1 learned the real function of college. And what is that? I'll tell
you what: to prepare you to face the realities of the world. And
what do you need to face the realities of the world? I'll tell you
what — poise, that's what you need. And how do you get poise? I'll
tell you how: not by keeping your nose in a book, you may In; sure!
Relax! Live! Enjoy! . . . That's how you get poise. Of course you
have to study, but be poised about it. Don't be like some clods
who spend every single night buried in a book. Not only are they not
learning poise; they are also eroding their eyeballs. The truly poised
student knows better than to make the whole semester hideous with
studying, fle knows that the night before the exam is plenty of time
to study.
Yes, I've heard that lots of people have condemned cramming. But
have yon heard who these people are? They are the electric light and
power interests, that's who! They want you to sit up late and study
every night so you'll use more electricity and enrich their bulging
coffers. Don't be a sucker!
Clearly, cramming is the only sensible way to study. But beware!
Even cramming can be overdone. Take it easy. On the night before
your exam, eat a hearty dinner. Then get a date and go out and eat
another hearty dinner. Then go park someplace and light up a
Philip Morris. Enjoy the peaceful pleasure it otters. Don't go
home until you're good and relaxed.
Once at home, relax. Do not, however, fall asleep. This is too
relaxed. To insure wakefulness, choose a chair that is not too
comfortable. For example, take a chair with nails pointing up
through the seat—or a chair in which somebody is already sitting.
Place several packs of Philip Morris within easy reach. Good
mild tobacco helps you to relax, and that's what Philip Morris is—
good mild tobacco. But Philip Morris is more than just good mild
tobacco; it is also cigarette paper to keep the good mild tobacco from
spilling all over the place.
Now you've got the uncomfortable chair and the Philip Morris.
Now yoii need light. Use the lit end of your Philip Morris. Do not
enrich the electric power interests.
Read your textbook in a slow, poised manner. Do not underline. It
reduces the re-sale value of your book. Always keep your books in
prime re-sale condition; you never know when you'll need getaway
money.
As you read you will no doubt come across many things you don't
understand. But don't panic. Relax. Play some records. Remove a
callus. Go out and catch some night crawlers.
Relax- Be poised. Stay loose. And remember—if things really close
in, you can always take up teaching.

STUDYING MADE SIMPLE
I have passed my thirty-fifth birthday, and my dewlaps droop and
my transmission needs oil. More and more my eyes turn inward,
reminiscing, sifting- the past, browsing lovingly among my souvenirs,
for at my time of life memories are all a man has.
And most precious are the memories of college. It still makes my
pulses quicken and my old glands leap to life just to think of it.
Ah, I was something then! "Swifty" my friends used to call me,
or "Rakehell" or "Candle-at-both-Ends" or "Devil Take the Hind
most." INIy phone was ringing all the time. "Come on, Devil-Take-the
llindmost," a cohort would say, "let's pile into the old convertible
arid live up a storm. 1 know a place that serves all-bran after hours."
So it went—night after mad night, kicks ypon kicks, sport that
wrinkled care derides, laughter holding both his sides. "Come on,
"Candle-at-Both-Ends," my companions would plead, "sing us an
other two hundred verses of Sweet Violets."
"No, my companions," I would reply with a gqntle but firm smile,
"we must turn homeward, for the cock has long since crowed."
" 'Twas not the cock," they would answer, laughing merrily.
" 'Twas Sam Leghorn doing his imitation of a chicken!"
And, sure enough, 'twas. Crazy, madcap Sam Leghorn. How I
miss his gaiety and wit! I never tired of hearing his imitation of
a chicken, nor he of giving it. 1 wonder what's become of him. Last
1 heard he was working as a weathervane in Tacoma.
