# Chuck Hands Bruins Over To Waldorf

Compiled from the United Press
Chuck Taylor was awfully gen
erous to his coaching friend from
across the Bay at yesterday's foot
ball writers' luncheon:
"Thank God we don't have to play
UCLA again. The Bruins are all
yours, Pappy."
But Coach Waldorf has another
week before he must prepare his
Golden Bears for UCLA. Cal only
has to play Southern California this
week.
After wishing the Bruins on Pap
py, Taylor was ready to quit. How
ever, he wanted to remind everyone
again that he has confidence in the
Indians.
"We're not as bad as we looked
and UCLA isn't that good. It -was
one of those things. We played some
good football. The problem now is
to make sure the kids realize they've
got a lot of good football in them,
which they have," Chuck said.
Taylor also pointed out that Stan
ford has only three men 20 years of
age on the team, while a large num
ber of Uclans are 22 or over. "That
can make a tremendous difference,"
he said.
Bert Rose, advance publicity man
for the Palo Alto-bound Washington
Huskies, startled the gathering by
saying, "Our scouts say that Stan
ford has a little more speed than
Washington." This Is after Hardi
man Cureton and other Bruin line
men were catching Stanford backs
from behind.
Rose continued, "We haven't any
one who can break out and go all the
way. Our best running back is full
back Stew Crook, who has a six
yards-per-carry average. We rely
almost entirely on the passing of
sophomore Bobby Cox."
"The line is average. Earl Mon
lux is our best lineman, potentially,
but he has played two mediocre
games. We're hoping that string ends
Saturday," Rose said.
In Los Angeles, UCLA assistant
coach Johnny Johnson, speaking for
Coach Red Sanders, said the whole
Bruin staff was so dazed by the
UCLA scoring spree that they
couldn't think of any way to hold
the score down.
"Our tailback, Primo Villanueva,
performed better than he ever had
before at UCLA," Johnson said. "It's
difficult to compare him with Paul
Cameron, but he ran that optional
pass-run play as well as anyone we
have ever seen."
