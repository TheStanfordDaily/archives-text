"STOCKHOLDER" BROWNâ€”Morris Brown, Stanford business student, brings up a point at the
"Mock stockholders' " meeting of General Mills, Inc., held Monday in the Business School. Harry
A. Bullis, chairman of the board, and eight other top company officials presented the re-enact
ment of Ihis year's meeting. General Mills has presented such meetings at two universities each
year for five years in the belief that actual demonstrations of business practices can be of great
value in augmenting a student's formal education. A similar session will be held at Yale later
this year. The company's executives are in San Francisco to conduct a regional stockholders'
meeting.
