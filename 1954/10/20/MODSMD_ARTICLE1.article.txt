# De Grazia Forecasts Demo Win

### HELEN DEWAR 
"I predict no nappy future for
Republican candidates in many
areas of the nation and a reor
ganization of Congress with
Democrats in many key posi
tions," Alfred de Grazia re
marked yesterday afternoon to
an open meeting of Pi Alpha
Sigma, national political science
fraternity.
De Grazia, associate professor of
political science and authority on
public opinion, risked "going out on
a limb to say that the next House
of Representatives will be Demo-

cratic, and then crawling out a little
farther to say that the Senate will
be Democratic as well."
"California," he said, "looks a lit
tle more promising for the Demo
crats than Republicans." As an ex
ception to this general rule, he main
tained that "few would dispute that
Richard Graves has the toughest job
on the ticket. It now looks as though
Knight has it."
YORTY AND KUCIIEL
"The polls carry Yorty and Ku
chel neck and neck," he stated. "The
undecided vote will favor Yorty and
bring him in by a comfortable mar
gin."
The Democrats, he believes, are
also fairly certain of securing Con
gressional seats from the 9th, 13th,
and 24th districts.
Going on down the list of candi
dates, de Grazia pointed out that
the Democratic candidate for Lieu
tenant Governor, Edward Roybal,
has a strong following among Cali
fornians of Mexican descent. "There
are indications in the south," he
said, "that Roybal will run well
ahead of Graves although there is
tremendous Democratic party unity."
GOP TO LOSE
Taking a broader view of the
United States, he predicted the Re
publicans to lose 10 Congressional
scats in the West and "a larger per
centage in the rest of the nation."
Dc Grazia estimated that the ma
jor reason for the impending Repub
lican loss is the fact that Eisenhow
er's name does not appear on the
ballot. "Nineteen fifty-two was more
an Eisenhower year than a Repub
lican year," he said.
He cited many factors pointing to
a Republican defeat: economic re
cession, unemployment, and the fact
that many right - wing groups arc
displeased with Eisenhower. They
resent the fact that they must be
supported by Eisenhower to win;
that they must bo carried along on
a 'Miadow coattail."
"The Republicans won't win as
many votes for having peace in 1954
as the Democrats lost for having war
in 1952," he said. "And it doesn't
lake much to stir up fear of 'bour
bonism,' or fear of big business."

ballot. "Nineteen fifty-two was more
an Eisenhower year than a Repub
lican year," he said.
He cited many factors pointing to
a Republican defeat: economic re
cession, unemployment, and the fact
that many right - wing groups arc
displeased with Eisenhower. They
resent the fact that they must be
supported by Eisenhower to win;
that they must bo carried along on
a 'Miadow coattail."
"The Republicans won't win as
many votes for having peace in 1954
as the Democrats lost for having war
in 1952," he said. "And it doesn't
lake much to stir up fear of 'bour
bonism,' or fear of big business."


ALFRED DE GRAZIA
—No happy future for GOP
"I predict no nappy future for
Republican candidates in many
areas of the nation and a reor
ganization of Congress with
Democrats in many key posi
tions," Alfred de Grazia re
marked yesterday afternoon to
an open meeting of Pi Alpha
Sigma, national political science
fraternity.
De Grazia, associate professor of
political science and authority on
public opinion, risked "going out on
a limb to say that the next House
of Representatives will be Demo-

cratic, and then crawling out a little
farther to say that the Senate will
be Democratic as well."
"California," he said, "looks a lit
tle more promising for the Demo
crats than Republicans." As an ex
ception to this general rule, he main
tained that "few would dispute that
Richard Graves has the toughest job
on the ticket. It now looks as though
Knight has it."
YORTY AND KUCIIEL
"The polls carry Yorty and Ku
chel neck and neck," he stated. "The
undecided vote will favor Yorty and
bring him in by a comfortable mar
gin."
The Democrats, he believes, are
also fairly certain of securing Con
gressional seats from the 9th, 13th,
and 24th districts.
Going on down the list of candi
dates, de Grazia pointed out that
the Democratic candidate for Lieu
tenant Governor, Edward Roybal,
has a strong following among Cali
fornians of Mexican descent. "There
are indications in the south," he
said, "that Roybal will run well
ahead of Graves although there is
tremendous Democratic party unity."
GOP TO LOSE
Taking a broader view of the
United States, he predicted the Re
publicans to lose 10 Congressional
scats in the West and "a larger per
centage in the rest of the nation."
Dc Grazia estimated that the ma
jor reason for the impending Repub
lican loss is the fact that Eisenhow
er's name does not appear on the
ballot. "Nineteen fifty-two was more
an Eisenhower year than a Repub
lican year," he said.
He cited many factors pointing to

cession, unemployment, and the fact
