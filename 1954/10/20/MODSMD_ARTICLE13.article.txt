# TUESDAY EVENING SERIES
## Renowned Poet Traces Development of the Hero 
### RALPH CAHN 
W. H. Auden, world-renownd British poet, told a Tuesday
Evening Series audience in Memorial Auditorium last night that
two of the more important trends in modern poetry are "the dis
appearance of a kind of public voice and the disappearance of
the public hero."
He began by defining the terms in his topic, "The Hero in

Modern Poetry." By modern, the
British poet said, he meant that pe
riod, not merely in poetry, but in
other fields as well since before the
beginning of the 20th century. "We
are living," Auden said, "not in the
beginning, but in the middle of
something—the change to the mod
ern came before the beginning of
the 20th century: between the 70's
and 905."
Auden then defined the word
hero: "All art has as its central sub
ject the celforalion of a hero—he
roic—a real person, with a faqg of
his own and a name of his own. The
hero is the nearest literary equiva
lent of what the human ought to be."
HERO IN POETRY
Auden then gave specific examples
of the hero in poetry: first was the
ancient hero "Achilles — man who
does things no other man can do."
Then was the 17th century hero—
"a man with tremendous power of
will—whether for good or evil, who
by virtue of this will was able to
establish sovereignty over others."
Finally came the 18th century hero,
"perhaps a man of balance, reason
ing, and common sense who defends
the city just as the knight - errant
defends against the dragon."
Auden then gave examples and
contrasted the works of four mod
ern poets whom he considers most
important: D. H. Lawrence, Robert
Frost, T. S. Eliot, and W. B. Yeats.
"Reading "Circus Animals' Deser
tion" by Yeats, Auden saw nature
viewed as "intended to be brought
into order by man." He also added,
"Yeats spent his first 48 years being
a minor poet so that he could spend
the rest of his life being a major
poet writing about his life as a minor
poet."
FROST S POETRY
In Frost's poetry, Auden pointed
out as his second example, "Man and
Nature are in direct antithesis to one
another. The heroic man—stoic man
—is capable of standing up to na
ture, alone."
These two examples, Auden said,
were expressive of the difference
between America and Europe: "Eu
ropeans grow up in nature which is

full of sacred places— nature is a
mother," the poet said; "here (in
the U.S.) nature is not a mother: it
is the dragon against whom St.
George struggles."
TWO VIEWS
In the early examples of what Au
den termed modern poetry he found
two tyipes of heroes: first, "the sensi
tive man who can't act—who pas-

sivcly experiences"; and second, "the
brutal, insensitive man." Later, he
said, these two disappear and new
characteristics of hero become com
mon, among which is a feeling on
the part of audience of closeness to
the hero, a feeling of being inti
mately addressed:
BUCOLICS
Mr. Audcn concluded his lecture
by reading a group of seven poems
which he called his "Bucolics":
Winds, Woods, Mountains, Lakes,
Islands, Plains, and Streams.
The British poet, who has resided
in the United States since the late
1930'5, was introduced by Professor
Yvor Winters.
