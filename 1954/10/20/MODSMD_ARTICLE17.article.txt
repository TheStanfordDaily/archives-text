# IFC Bans Rushing at Christmas
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
During a discussion of rush
ing plans at the Interfraternity
Council meeting last night, the
IF C overwhelmingly voted
down the idea of rushing fresh
men during Christmas vacation.
Most of the house presidents fell
that Christmas rushing, which was
banned last year on a trial basis, was
impractical because of the expense
and the geographical limitations in
volved.
The IFC discussed problems re
lated to open houses, the start of
rushing, the start of formal rushing,
and off-campus parties in order to
convey the body's views to the rush
ing committee headed by Steve Hor
rell, Zete.
The rushing committee will for
mulate a detailed plan for winter
quarter rushing and will present
that for IFC approval at the next
meeting in two weeks.
MAIN ISSUE
The main issue at last night's ses
sion was the problem of open
houses. A slim majority seemed to
favor the method utilized two years
ago. Under that plan only the up
per Row would be open one night
and only the lower Row the fol
lowing night.
Last year all the fraternities were
open during each open house period,
but the rushees were split alphabeti
cally. The first half went to upper
Row while the second half went to
lower Row. This procedure was re
versed the following night.
Many of the house presidents felt
that it was difficult to maintain in
terest during a long, consecutive pe
riod of open houses.
The IFC also indicated that it
would disapprove any plan to limit
the number of off-campus rushing
parties, although the fraternity
alumni would like to sec this prac
tice curtailed.
RUSHING
In addition the council favored the
suggestion that there be no delay
between the end of open houses and
the beginning of formal rushing be
cause it would slow rushing mo
mentum and would be hard to en
force.
In other business the IFC took no
action against Zeta Psi, which had
been reported for a disturbance at
Guthrie late Friday night, Oct. 15.
Guthrie filed no complaint because
the Zetes rectified the damage to
the volleyball court the next morn
ing.
JUDICIAL POWER
President Otis Winters, Alpha
Dclt, reported that the plan Whereby
the IFC would assume its own ju
dicial power from the Interfraternity
Board of Control, which has been
approved by the IFC and Univer
sity President Wallace Sterling, must
be ratified by the student body in
the Nov. 11-12 campus election.
A minor change in the ASSU con
stitution is required, dissolving the
IFB and giving its powers to the
IFC. The ASSU Executive Commit
tee is expected to take action to put
this on the ballot at tonight's meet
ing.
The house presidents reported
that the majority of the fraternities
were strongly in favor of an all
fraternity formal dance during win
ter quarter, but not in connection
with pledging. The social committee,
headed by Bob Smith of AKL, will
work on plans to hold the dance late
in February or early in March.

parties, although the fraternity
alumni would like to sec this prac
tice curtailed.
RUSHING
In addition the council favored the
suggestion that there be no delay
between the end of open houses and
the beginning of formal rushing be
cause it would slow rushing mo
mentum and would be hard to en
force.
In other business the IFC took no
action against Zeta Psi, which had
been reported for a disturbance at
Guthrie late Friday night, Oct. 15.
Guthrie filed no complaint because
the Zetes rectified the damage to
the volleyball court the next morn
ing.
JUDICIAL POWER
President Otis Winters, Alpha

the IFC would assume its own ju
dicial power from the Interfraternity
Board of Control, which has been

stitution is required, dissolving the
IFB and giving its powers to the

ing.
The house presidents reported
that the majority of the fraternities
were strongly in favor of an all
fraternity formal dance during win
ter quarter, but not in connection
with pledging. The social committee,
headed by Bob Smith of AKL, will
work on plans to hold the dance late
in February or early in March.
During a discussion of rush
ing plans at the Interfraternity
Council meeting last night, the
IF C overwhelmingly voted
down the idea of rushing fresh
men during Christmas vacation.
Most of the house presidents fell
that Christmas rushing, which was
banned last year on a trial basis, was
impractical because of the expense
and the geographical limitations in
volved.
The IFC discussed problems re
lated to open houses, the start of
rushing, the start of formal rushing,
and off-campus parties in order to
convey the body's views to the rush
ing committee headed by Steve Hor
rell, Zete.
The rushing committee will for
mulate a detailed plan for winter
quarter rushing and will present
that for IFC approval at the next
meeting in two weeks.
MAIN ISSUE
The main issue at last night's ses
sion was the problem of open
houses. A slim majority seemed to
favor the method utilized two years
ago. Under that plan only the up
per Row would be open one night
and only the lower Row the fol
lowing night.
Last year all the fraternities were
open during each open house period,
but the rushees were split alphabeti
cally. The first half went to upper
Row while the second half went to
lower Row. This procedure was re
versed the following night.
Many of the house presidents felt
that it was difficult to maintain in
terest during a long, consecutive pe
riod of open houses.
The IFC also indicated that it
would disapprove any plan to limit
the number of off-campus rushing
parties, although the fraternity
alumni would like to sec this prac
tice curtailed.
