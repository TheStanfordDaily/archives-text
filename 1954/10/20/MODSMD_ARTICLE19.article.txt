# Adenauer, France Talk On Economy
## 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 19 (UP) â€”Premier
Pierre Mendes - France and
Chancellor Konrad Adenauer
agreed today to expand eco
nomic relations between Franco
and Germany in a dramatic
meeting that also made progress
toward settlement of the Saar
dispute.
A communique said the two
statesmen reached agreement on
some points in a bold Franco-Ger
man reconciliation program pro
posed by Mendes-France with the
aim of making the two nations both
economic and military partners.
The German chancellor, who flew
here from Bonn, met with the
French premier in the seeluded 17th
century chateau of La Celle St.
Cloud, where Mme. de Pompadour
used to entertain Louis XV.
NO GLOWING CLAIMS
The communique steered clear of
any glowing claims of final succcss
on clearing up the Saar question
the main obstacle to conclusion of
the treaty to rearm Western Ger
many. It reported, however, that
progress had been made by the ne
gotiators.
The announcement stressed the
accord reached on points in the
Mendes - France plan for a vast
Franco-German projcct of joint eco
nomic and commercial development
in Europe and French North Africa.
FIRST OF SERIES
The talks were the first of a series
of major international conferences
designed to bring West Germany
into the Western defense camp
through membership in the North
Atlantic Alliance and the Brussels
Pact.
The main item was settlement of
the status of the Saar, of vital im
portance to the Western world.
Mendes-France has proclaimed he
will not seek French parliamentary
ratification of the London accord to
rearm West Germany before such a
settlement is reached.
But the resourceful French pre
mier was trying to make a Saar bar
gain only part of a bigger package
into which he could wrap up most
of the outstanding issues still divid
ing France and Germany.
