# Absentee Voters
## 
### 
Political awareness is getting another boost
up the Stanford ladder from isolation and pre
occupation today.
Of the 3,000 or so Stanford students who are
legally entitled to vote in state and national
elections, a shamefully small proportion actual
ly cast ballots. The reason for this is, of course,
that most of these potential voters are regis
tered in other countries or other states, and they
seldom take the trouble to obtain and file ab
sentee ballots.
But today a booth will be staffed in front of
the Cellar. This booth will supply any regis
tered voter with an application form to fill out.
The students manning the booth will then ad
dress a stamped envelope, which they also
supply, and mail the application to the county

where the student is registered. The county
will then mail an absentee ballot to the student.
What could be simpler for the student voter?
All he does is fill out the application. The stu
dents staffing the booth do everything else,
even supplying the stamp.
The students behind this project, the Young
Republicans of the Stanford Area, wish to em
phasize that this is a service project and is for
Democrats and Republicans. This attitude, one
of non-partisan service for the benefit of po
litical awareness among Stanford students, is
truly commendable.
We hope all registered voters on campus
whose homes are outside Santa Clara County,
will take advantage of this new departure in
political activity.
