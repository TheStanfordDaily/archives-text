# CAMPUS OPINION
## Political Union 
### 
To the Editor:
I would like to express a word of appreciation for
your fine editorial in last Thursday's Daily evaluat
ing the progress of the Stanford Political Union. How
ever, inasmuch as your statements were in some de
gree critical of the position expressed by some mem
bers of our executive committee, I think it well that
a proper answer be given. Because the Political
Union executive committee is not in complete agree
ment on the issues you have presented, I must refrain
from speaking in their behalf and confine these com
ments to my own opinions.
It cannot be denied that student expression and
participation in debate on important political issues
is the very essence of the purpose of the Political
Union. The question is not whether we shall abolish
student participation, but rather, how we can best
att in that objective.
i believe that continuation of the present policy
of presenting a guest speaker on a specific resolution
at the same meeting with a student speaker in oppo
sition and student debate is not the best way to
achieve the objective, but can do immeasurable harm
to the growth and success of the Political Union. On
the other hand, the Political Union should continue
its policy of inviting political figures of state and
national prominence to appear at Stanford.
Let me explain the reasons for this position. First,
there is the problem of procuring political figures as
speakers. Here we must make Stanford attractive to
people who have very little free time and to whom
visiting Stanford is more of a sacrifice than a political
advantage. They must accept or decline our invita
tions on very short notice. Planning for any length
of time in advance is virtually impossible.
Secondly, to add to the burden of negotiating with
the speaker to arrive at a precise resolution for the
meeting which the speaker feels willing and compe
tent to take a stand on and yet at the same time is
timely and sufficiently publicized to provoke student
interest is a terrific burden on our program chairman.
Dictating the topic to the prospective guest speaker,
as your editorial suggests, is not a good way of
encouraging him to come,
Thirdly, it we are successful in obtaining the speak
er and arriving at the resolution, in most cases there
will be a minimum of time for publicity of the event
to r level op student interest in the resolution and for
the student speakers to be chosen and to prepare for
the debate. The selection and preparation, of the 15-
minute opposition speaker becomes extremely diffi
cult. It is small wonder, therefore, that the student
floor debate of last year "degenerated into a disor

ganized, unprepared squabble between a very few
participants," as your editorial so aptly put it.
Fourthly, the question period presents a fine op
portunity for participation. At ail of last year's meet
ings the questioning of the guest speaker was the most
successful and desirable aspect of the program. To
further add. student debate results in a program that
is too long or forces the question period to be cut short.
What then is the solution to the dilemma? Your
editorial appears to assume that if student speakers
are eliminated from those meetings of the Political
Union to which a guest speaker has been invited,
there will be no student participation in the Political
Union's program at all. I think this assumption fails
to take into account the vast variety of political type
programs which the Political Union can present on
a smaller scale. These would include faculty led
discussions on such topics as Far Eastern policy, model
legislative sessions, a trip to the state capitol, and, of
course, debates on current issues of interest to stu
dents.
The debate program might well be conducted with
a single major political issue each quarter. Students
could study the issue, form their opinions, and pre
pare for debate in meetings of the Political Union's
three caucuses, Democratic, Republican, and Inde
pendent. The debate itself would take place near
the end of the quarter. In this way, we would have
more enlightened participation rather than mere
partisanship.
To these programs would be added the programs
which the individual caucuses themselves present.
But we should never abandon our aim of bringing
to the Stanford campus well-known political leaders.
Only in this way will the Political Union develop the
interest to sustain the rest of its program.
These suggestions are but a small part of the poten
tial program of the Political Union. We must re
member that the Political Union is a new idea at
Stanford. It departs from Stanford's traditional pol
icy of avoiding politics. It may reasonably take five
or ten years to develop the Political Union to its full
potential. During this time it will need the interest
and self-sacrifice of students, faculty, and administra
tion alike if it is to succeed. The course ahead will be
largely the product of and error.
In conclusion, I wish to express the thanks of the
Political Union executive committee for the constant
interest and support which The Stanford Daily has
given the Political Union since its inception.
Sincerely,
BILL FUNDENBERG
President, Stanford Political Union
