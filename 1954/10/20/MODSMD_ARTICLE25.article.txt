# 48 Years Independent, Axe Society Joins ASSU
## 
### MARGARET DALGLIESH 
Axe Society was integrated
into ASSU at a meeting of Ex
com earlier this month.
This change was made to
make for smoother running elec
tions and a more unied commit
tee.
Sam Palmer, president of Axe So
ciety, commented on this move say
ing, "We feel that this move by the
Axe Society might act as a focal
point for other activity groups in
integrating themselves into the AS
SU."
Axe Society has had a long his
tory. It was started in 190G when a
group of prominent senior men
formed what was then called the
Quad Club. Its purpose at that time
was to provide a place for student
leaders to discuss campus problems.
This was a successful organization
but in 1933 it was decided that jun
ior men should be admitted to its
membership. It was then that the
name was changed to the Stanford
Axe Society.
The group took charge of the
frosh bible, pre - registration, the
annual student - faculty field day,
and junior transfer orientation be
tween 1930 and 1941. World War II
brought a lack of men to the campus
and the organization was suspended
until 1952.
SOCIETY REORGANIZED
The Axe Society was then reor
ganized, opening its membership to
both men and women. A new char
ier was issued by the ASSU and the
society began its operation as the
official liaison committee between
the student body and the Alumni
Association.
Now, as a subcommittee of ASSU,
the Axe Society will continue in
its function of furthering alumni re
lations. Part of this activity includes
planning, in connection with the
Alumni Association, the Spring
Conference and all reunions for past
classes.
NEW FUNCTION
The new function of the Axe So
ciety will be that of being in charge
of all campus elections. This will

give elections a permanent person
nel trained specifically to run elec
tions. It is hoped that this move
will alleviate many of the past prob
lems faced by the election commit
tee.
The Activities handbook is the
newest project in the hands of Axe

Society. It will include the purpose,
activities, and requirements for ad
mittance to each activity on campus.
This is scheduled to come out at the
beginning of winter quarter.
MEMBERSHIP
The society consists of 30 mem
bers taken from all classes except
the freshman class. These members
are selected by tryouts.
Present officers are: Sam Palmer,
president; Eileen Conaghan and Dick
Bolton, vice-presidents; and Joanne
Cuddihy, secretary - treasurer.
The structure of the organization
is that of three subcommittees to
make lor more efficient planning.
These are the election, Activity
Handbook, and alumni relations
committees. Each committee is
headed by one member of Axe So
ciety.

integrating themselves into the AS
SU."
Axe Society has had a long his
tory. It was started in 190G when a
group of prominent senior men
formed what was then called the
Quad Club. Its purpose at that time
was to provide a place for student
leaders to discuss campus problems.
This was a successful organization
but in 1933 it was decided that jun
ior men should be admitted to its
membership. It was then that the
name was changed to the Stanford
Axe Society.
The group took charge of the
frosh bible, pre - registration, the
annual student - faculty field day,
and junior transfer orientation be
tween 1930 and 1941. World War II
brought a lack of men to the campus
and the organization was suspended
until 1952.
SOCIETY REORGANIZED
The Axe Society was then reor
ganized, opening its membership to
both men and women. A new char
ier was issued by the ASSU and the
society began its operation as the
official liaison committee between
the student body and the Alumni
Association.
Now, as a subcommittee of ASSU,
the Axe Society will continue in
its function of furthering alumni re
lations. Part of this activity includes
planning, in connection with the
Alumni Association, the Spring
Conference and all reunions for past
classes.
NEW FUNCTION
The new function of the Axe So
ciety will be that of being in charge
of all campus elections. This will

give elections a permanent person
nel trained specifically to run elec
tions. It is hoped that this move
will alleviate many of the past prob
lems faced by the election commit
tee.
The Activities handbook is the
newest project in the hands of Axe

Society. It will include the purpose,
activities, and requirements for ad
mittance to each activity on campus.
This is scheduled to come out at the
beginning of winter quarter.
MEMBERSHIP
The society consists of 30 mem
bers taken from all classes except
the freshman class. These members
are selected by tryouts.
Present officers are: Sam Palmer,
president; Eileen Conaghan and Dick
Bolton, vice-presidents; and Joanne
Cuddihy, secretary - treasurer.
The structure of the organization
is that of three subcommittees to
make lor more efficient planning.
These are the election, Activity
Handbook, and alumni relations
committees. Each committee is
headed by one member of Axe So
ciety.

Axe Society was integrated
into ASSU at a meeting of Ex
com earlier this month.
This change was made to
make for smoother running elec

Sam Palmer, president of Axe So
ciety, commented on this move say
ing, "We feel that this move by the
Axe Society might act as a focal
point for other activity groups in
integrating themselves into the AS
SU."
