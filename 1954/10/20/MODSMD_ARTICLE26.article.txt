# Candelight Hour Changed to 9:30
## 
### 
The candle]ight service at Memo
rial Church will be held at 9:30 p.m.,
starting this evening, instead of at
9. A study group on devotional life
will be held. tonight at 9 in the
vestry before the candlelight serv
ice. It will be led by Acting Chap
lain Charles F. Whi.ston and is open
to anyone who wishes to attend.
These changes in the Memorial
Church program are in response to
the results of questionnaires distrib
uted at the candlelight service two
weeks ago. The replies showed a
majority in favor of the 9:30 time
for the service and a considerable
interest in inaugurating a religious
study group.
The candlelight service will con
sist of Scripture reading, organ
meditation, and prayer.
