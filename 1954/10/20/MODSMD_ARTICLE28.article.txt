# Freidel to Speak At Political Union
## 
### 
Have the Republicans brought the
change they promised in 1952, or do
the policies of Franklin Delano Roo
sevelt still dominate American gov
ernment?
This is the topic which will be dis
cussed tomorrow night at the Stan
ford Political Union's first meeting
of the year. Dr. Frank Freidel, as
sociate history professor and Roose
velt authority, will present the main
address, "A Change in '52: Yes or
No?" followed by a student opposi
tion speaker and floor debate.
Dr. Freidel, who is currently
working on the third volume of a
biography of the late Democratic
President, will not take a partisan
stand on the issue, but will attempt
to present both viewpoints.
The meeting will be held at 8 p.m.
in Cubberley Auditorium, and is
open to the public.
