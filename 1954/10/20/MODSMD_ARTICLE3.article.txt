# ICC Asks Ban Of Railroad Segregation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 (UP) —
The Justice Department urged the
Interstate Commerce Commission
today to ban the separation of white
and Negro passengers on 12 railroads
serving the South.
The department, supporting an
anti-segregation petition by the Na
tional Association for the Advance
ment of Colored People, said, "The
time has come for the Commission
. . . to declare unequivocally that a
Negro passenger is free to travel the
length and breadth of this country
in the same manner as any other
passenger."
Simultaneously, seven of the rail
roads asked the Commission to rule
that racial segregation is "not con
trary" to any provision of the ICC
Act. They contended that the com
plaint should be dismissed.
NO RULING YET
Hearings on the petition were held
last summer. No ruling has been
made yet.
An ICC hearing examiner recom
mended last month that a petition
charging racial discrimination on an
interstate bus be dismissed. He said
there is no law or court ruling for
bidding segregation in transporta
tion.
The examiner's recommendation is
subject to review by the ICC Board.
Commission chairman Richard F.
Mitchell said recently he believes
the decision in the bus case is "com
pletely out of line."
The Supreme Court in 1950 out
lowed segregation in railroad din
ing cars but no ruling has been is
sued specifically applying to overall
bus or railroad travel.
VIOLATES CONSTITUTION
The Justice Department contended
in a brief that separation of whites
and Negroes on railroads operating
in interstate commerce violates not
only the ICC Act but also the con
stitution.
The seven railroads in their brief
said they set aside separate coaches
or parts of coaches for Negro and
white passengers and that accommo
dations for the two races are "sub
stantially equal."
The brief was filed by the Atlantic
Coast Line; Santa Fe; Gulf, Mobile
& Ohio; Kansas City Southern;
Louisville & Nashville; St. Louis-
San Francisco; and Southern Rail
roads.
