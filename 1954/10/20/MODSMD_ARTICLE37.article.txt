HUSKY AIR ARMâ€”Bob Cox (left) passing to Jim Houston (right)
has been one of the chief reasons the Washington Huskies have
moved so well this season via the air lanes. Cox, a sophomore,
is heralded as another Don Heinrich after a spectacular frosh
season, and has moved in to full-time duty now that Sandy
Lederman is out with a broken leg. Jim Houston is the only
returning letterman end on the squad and has garnered in seven
passes for 121 yards in five Purple and Gold games.
