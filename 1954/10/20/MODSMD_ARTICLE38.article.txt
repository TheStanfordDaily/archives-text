# Bounceback Takes Hold
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
"Operation Bounce Back" shifted
into high gear yesterday afternoon
as Coach Chuck Taylor led the Stan
ford gridmen through still another
bone-jarring scrimmage that finally
ended under the lights.
Taylor would only call the bruis
ing workout "just another scrim
mage," but it was obvious that this
was just as rugged a session as yes
terday's when guard Matt Armitage
suffered a broken leg and was lost
for the season.
Taylor refused to single out any
players for special notice. However,
sideline experts tabbed quarterback
Jack Lewis' performance as one of
the best of the day. Lewis' running,
passing, and signal calling all seemed
first-rate.
With the exceptions of Armitage
and Doeter, the injury situation
seems well in hand. Armitage, of
course, has no hope of playing
again this year, while Doctor's
wrenched knee will definitely
sideline him for (he Washington
tilt.
The quarterback position will
seem almost opulent today as Jack
Gebert will work out in scrimmage
for the first time since pre-season
practice and Jerry Gustafson, too.
will be back in harness.
Gebert's game knee has been pro
nounced nearly as good as new by
trainer Connie Jarvis. Gustafson
has been laying off since the UCLA
game with an injured pinkie.
The remainder of the crippled
Cards, Paul Wiffgin, Ernie Dorrv,
Chris Marshall, and Dorsey At
kinson, are (all expected to he in
(op shape by the lend of the week.
In an attempt to bolster the Indian
reserves.at guard, Taylor yesterday
shifted center Manny Vanderlip
over to that spot. Roy Kricjceberg
will, as previously reported, fill Matt
Armitage's vacated left guard posi
tion. Jim McCamant and Dick Jones
are fighting for Docter's position at
right end.
