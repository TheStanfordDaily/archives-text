An interception, a touchdown pass, and another interception in
quick succession enabled Phi Psi to trip Sigma Chi 12 0 in mural
competition last night.
After Bob Nichols intercepted a Sigma Chi pass on the Sigma
Chi 25-yard line, Nat Leanse tossed to Don Day in the end zone

for Phi P.si's first score. On the next*
play, Phi Psi captain Scott Gray in- :
tercepted another Sigma Chi pass
and ran it into pay dirt.
Sigma Chi tried to strike back
right before the half ended. With
the ball on the Sigma Chi 20. Bob
Sampson passed to Bill Carrel 1 for
15 yards and a first down. On the
next play, Sampson raced around
right end for 20 yards and another
first - down. However, the threat j
ended when Sampson's pass intended !
for Carrel 1 fell incomplete. Before
Sigma Chi could run another play,
the half ended.
Phi Psi threatened again in the
second half. Leanse punted 40 yards
to put Sigma Chi on their own five. |
He then intercepted a Bob Sampson I
pass and ran it back to the 13. How
ever, two bad passes from center
put the ball back on the midfield

stripe and Sigma Chi took over on
downs.
Late in the fourth quarter, Sigma
Chi started to move. Sampson
passed to Joe Cox for five yards.
Then, on an end run, Sampson net
ted 15 yards and a first down. With
