# Playground Help Needed by YWCA
## 
### 
Men and women interested in be
ing future directors of the South
Palo Alto playground will meet at
4:30 p.m. today in the YWCA office
on the third floor of the Women's
Clubhouse. Sue Galla.%l, in charge
of playground direction, urges es
pecially that men come, as the boys
of junior high age need particular
supervision.
The playground, operated by the
Stanford YWCA, sponsors recrea
tional games for children, and will
open Saturday with a full day of
activity. On succeeding Saturdays,
student - directed play periods will
be organized from 10 a.m. to noon.
