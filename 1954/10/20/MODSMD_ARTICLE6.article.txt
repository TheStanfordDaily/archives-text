In an angry clash with Andrei Y.
Vishinsky, he accused the Soviet
chief delegate of engaging in a "cold
war exercise" in making the charge.
In a second clash, Lodge said that
there has been an easing of tension
in the world—but that it came about
despite the Soviet Union and"the
much-advertised new look of the

mouths of Communist leaders kept

"But . . . one can not accept
words at their face value when ut

whose masters operate from with
in the steel-white walls of the
Kremlin—or wherever it is that they
happen to be operating from these
days," he said.
