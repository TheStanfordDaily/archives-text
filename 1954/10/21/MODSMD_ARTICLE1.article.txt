# NEW YORK SPEECH
## Ike Gives Three Point Peace Plan 
### 
NfiW YORK, Oct. 20 (UP)—President Eisenhower promised the
world tonight that American military forces never would be used
to launch a war against any nation and set forth a three-point
program for peace.
The President, speaking at a $50-a-plate dinner marking the

'300 th anniversary of Jewish settle
ment in this country, said U.S. forces
would be used "only for the defense
of the free world."
Mr. Eisenhower made a pledge to
press on in search for agreement
with the Soviet Union, "no matter
how discouraging the prospect, no
matter how intractable the Commu
nist regimes."
The Russians have every weapon
known to man, whether designed to
destroy people or ideals, the Presi
dent said, and they have shown no
evidence of practicing their preach
ments of peace.
Nevertheless, Mr. Eisenhower re
newed his invitation to the Russians
to join in the global "atoms for
peace" program he first suggested
last year.
THREE POINTS
The three avenues to peace .which
Eisenhower outlined were:
1. "We must tirelessly seek —
through the United Nations, through
every other available means—to es
tablish the conditions for honorable
peace."
2. "We must promote the unity
and collective strength of other free
peoples."
3. "We must maintain enough mil
itary strength to deter aggression
and promote peace."
The chief executive said the prob
lem of carrying out his third "major
road" to peace was stubborn but
did not defy solution.
He said the American military es
tamlishment., in the face of "con
stantly changing dangers" across the
world, could not be held static. But
he added that the "awesome power"
possessed by America in "today's
uncertain world" must be main
tained "to deal effectively and flex
ibly with whatever situations may
arise."
ARMS LIMITATIONS
The chief executive said the Unit
ed States would welcome an arms
limitations and atomic control
agreement.
This was Mr. Eisenhower's first
swing into the East since the 1954
campaign rolled into high gear. Al
though the trip was labeled officially
as "non-political," GOP strategists
privately counted on it to give the
party cause considerable help.
