## 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 20 (UP) — The
United States, Britain, and
France reached formal agree
ment today on ending the occu
pation of Germany and restoring
its freedom. The three powers
and the Gorman Federal Repub
lic are expected to sign the texts
Saturday.
However, France and Germany
had not reached a firm settlement of
the Saar problem. Premier Pierre
Mendes-France indicated he would
insist on a Saar agreement before he
.signed the Bonn Treaty.
A four-power communique issued
after today's meeting said there were
a few "remaining issues" on restor
ing German sovereignty and that the
foreign ministers would meet again
tomorrow but a spokesman called
the communique "less optimistic
than it might have been" since major
points were solved.
On Saturday the Western foreign
ministers hope to sign a series of 14
momentous documents restoring
West Germany's freedom, giving it
the right to arm 500,000 men and ad
mitting it to NATO and an expanded
Brussels Treaty Organization.
ALL BUT SIGNED
An official spokesman said the first
Four-Power session ended with the
Bonn Treaty "an agreed item,"
meaning it was all but signed.
Agreements reached today include
restoration of Germany's freedom to
fly, to resume aircraft production, to
rearm 500,000 within the framework
of NATO and the Brussels Pact, and
the gradual abolishment of the $142,-
860,000 occupation costs which will
be replaced by higher defense costs.
Mendes-France entertained Sec
retary of Stata John Foster Dulles at
dinner tonight and observers be
lieved Mendes-France would use the
occasion to press for further conces
sions such as U.S. approval for dis
tribution of American military aid
through the new Brussels Pact
Agency.
