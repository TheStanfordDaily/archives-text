# EXCOM:
## Preferential Vote System Abolished 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS Associate Editor, The Daily 
The Executive Committee unanimously passed a motion abol
ishing the preferential election system in its meeting last night.
The motion, as stated by Rudy Reich, ratified the action of last
year's Excom, which failed to satisfy the constitutional require-

ment of a three-fourths majority*"
vote in favor of the motion.
The new election system, as voted
in last night, will mean that the
two candidates finishing highest in
the primary election will run off
against cach other in the final elec
tion.
Excom then considered the possi
bility of a tie vote in either the pri
mary or the final. A motion by Bob
Gable for a new election in this
situation failed to get the necessary
three-fourths affirmative vote. The !
problem was tabled until next (
week's meeting.
In other action, Excom heard a re- 1
port from AI Ivey, NSA co-ordina
tor. Ivey told the history of NSA
and explained some of the advan
tages of the international program.
ADVANTAGES
One of these advantages is the
summer seminar in international
student relations, Ivey said. Fifteen
students from schools with an NSA
organization are given a scholarship
to attend Harvard for study in in
ternational affairs for six weeks,
after which they attend the NSA
summer congress.
Other advantages cited by Ivey
arc the International Student Con
ference, to be held this spring at
Mexico City; the Student Mutual
Assistance Program; tours of the
United States for foreigners, and
tours of Europe for Americans at
reduced prices.
John Sprague, co-chairman of the
Foreign Scholarship Committee, re
ported on the three ASSU Scholars
who had not conic to Stanford.
In the case of J. Scott Birnie from
Scotland, Sprague said that Birnie
himself had refused to come to
America for medical reasons.
COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES?
In the cases of Kyu Whan Kim
from Korea and Petar Macanovic
from Yugoslavia, Sprague said that
authorities arc still working to try
to get visas for the two, and hope
that they might be able to attend
Stanford next year.
Kim's visa was refused by the
Seoul embassy because of informa
tion regarding Kim's alleged activi
ties with the Communists during the
early part, of the Korean war.
Sprague said that Kim's letter de
nied all such charges, and cited his
service with the U.N. as a war cor
respondent.
Macanovic's visa was denied by |
the Yugoslav embassy because of
his "voluntary membership" in the
Union of Students, which is affiliated
with the People's Youth, which is,
in turn, under the direction of the
Union of Communists:
Sprague quoted a letter from Ma
canovic saying, "I am not a member
of the Union of Communists of Yu
goslavia or of any Communist or
ganization."
NEXT YEAH . . .
Sprague said that the Foreign
Scholarship Committee was working
through the Attorney General to get
a visa for Macanovic next year.
Dianne Goldman, Rudy Reich, and
Pat King were named by Pete Bing
to compose a committee to meet, with
President Wallacc Sterling to con
sider the re-evaluation of Univer
sity curriculum.
Bing also named Eric Frickcr, Jim
Flanagan, and Bobby Clark as a
Constitutional Committee, to exam
ine the ASSU constitution.
