# KEAR Negotiation Fails on First Day
## 
### 
The first negotiations in the strike
of two announcing and enginccering
unions against radio station KEAR
broke up yesterday afternoon over
the fate of three employees.
The three men had been hired by
the station during the strike. The
station now wants to keep them as
tegular employees, but the union
refuses to accept them on the
grounds they have served as strike
breakers.
The one concrete outcome of the
meeting was a concession by the
management to allow the unions to
present their side of the strike story
over the facilities of KEAR.
The unions had asked for equal
time to respond to a broadcast made
by station president Steven A. Cis
ler last weekend.
The broadcast is now scheduled
for 7:30 tomorrow night.
Yesterday's negotiations were the
first since the unions struck on Oct.
5, over wage and safety grievances.
Since that time, the station has been
manned by supervisory personnel
and two new employees.
