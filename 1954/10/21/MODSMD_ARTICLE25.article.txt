# Homecoming Float Parade Entries Due
## 
### 
Plans for Stanford's traditional
Homecoming Week got started
as entries for the pre-game float
parade began coming in.
Parade planners said that
about 30 entrants were expected
in response to letters and appli
cation forms sent out last week.
This year's parade will headline
the theme "Trojans Fail on Indian
Trail," and will follow the route
taken by last year's parade, down
University Avenue.
The deadline for applications is
being held up longer than planned
to give all groups who want to enter
the parade a chance to do so. Offi
cials announced, however, that in
terested living groups should get
their applications in as soon as pos
sible.
Chairman Art Stauffer mentioned
that those who applied first would
have the first choice of slogans for
their floats, and warned that several
popular slogans had already been
spoken for.
Planners for this year's parade
have made special arrangements for
buying float-building materials: this
year all groups who plan to enter
will buy their crepe paper, wood,
and chicken wire through the Inter
fraternity Council treasury. By buy
ing the supplies collectively, the
committee hopes to save up to 40
per cent. Managing the buying are
Watson Clifford and Heath MaeLen
don of the House Managers' Associ
ation. who originated the idea.
Prizes to be awarded for the pa
rade winners will include awards in
eight classifications: humor, origi
nality, theme, execution, men's divi
sion, and mixed division, plus two
grand prizes, one for living groups
with more than 150 members, and
one prize for smaller living groups.
