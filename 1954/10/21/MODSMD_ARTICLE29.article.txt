# A 						Chance for Stanford to Learn
## 
### 
Ever since Stanford joined the National Stu
dent Association pessimistic students have
registered their complaints against the organi
zation without ever giving it a chance to set
its ship on even keel and sail into action. Stu
dents expected something to come out of NSA
that would shake the campus and necessitate
an eight-column banner in the Daily exclaim
ing the news. All this in a year no less.
But the NSA isn't a sensational organization
which promises to remold student governments
drastically and change the campus ways. It is
a hard working body which divides its mem
ber schools into regions, calls them all together
in a summer convention, and then lets them
set their agenda for the year. It is an educating
organization which seeks to cure campus mal
adies by inter-member discussions and through
a common sharing of past experience and ideas.
Stanford has spent a year in getting its ship
in shape and in working out organization prob
lems with the Northern California members
Mills and California.
Many students maintain that Stanford doesn't
need any help and can't possibly gain anything
by remaining in the organization. Stanford en
tered on a one year trial basis and the year is
up. The Executive Committee of ASSU will
vote on the status of NSA in the near future.
A 1 Loomis, NSA Co-ordinator, is fighting for
the organization's life on iampus and is attempt
ing to prove that Stanford can derive as much
as it puts into NSA.
The initial benefits were gained from the
summer conference in Ames, lowa where seven
Stanford delegates pooled their knowledge
with 750 college representatives from all over
the United States. They came back with sound
ideas for government and have made their re
port available to students at the ASSU office.
The Conference provided practical training

in student government and set up NSA policy
and programs for the year. The four main top
ics of the conference were: (1) Student Govern
ment Administration, (2) Role of Students in the
Campus Community, (3) Student Government
Programming, and (4) Role of Students beyond
the Campus Community—all worthwhile sub
jects.
Tonight in Stephens Hall at California, we're
getting our first big chance to really get some
thing out of NSA. The three region members
—California, Mills and Stanford—have invited
San Jose State, Belmont, USE and San Fran
cisco State to participate in a session on elec
tion procedures which will include discussion
o{ student interest in elections and methods to
run elections efficiently.
Does Stanford need any aid in running elec
tions? Can we possibly benefit from proced
ural tips?
These seem like silly guestions after the
farcial primary last spring when five contests
were invalidated.
Election officials from all the schools are ex
pected to be in attendance and present their
ideas and attempt to solve the many problems
which have arisen in the past.
In early November NSA President Harry
Lund is expected to be at Mills to lead a discus
sion on the Foreign Student program. He is
considered to be an expert on this field and
surely Stanford, with its large foreign student
program, can benefit from his experience.
The pessimists, the show-me's, the hecklers,
are getting a chance to see concrete proof in
black and white that Stanford stands to gain
more than a mere fringe benefit.
Il is up to Stanford to'back the organization
if it is to share in the dividends. It is up to the
students to find out what NSA is all about.
There's room for education in this field.

summer conference in Ames, lowa where seven
Stanford delegates pooled their knowledge
with 750 college representatives from all over
the United States. They came back with sound
ideas for government and have made their re
port available to students at the ASSU office.
The Conference provided practical training

in student government and set up NSA policy
and programs for the year. The four main top
ics of the conference were: (1) Student Govern
ment Administration, (2) Role of Students in the
Campus Community, (3) Student Government
Programming, and (4) Role of Students beyond
the Campus Community—all worthwhile sub
jects.
Tonight in Stephens Hall at California, we're
getting our first big chance to really get some
thing out of NSA. The three region members
—California, Mills and Stanford—have invited
San Jose State, Belmont, USE and San Fran
cisco State to participate in a session on elec
tion procedures which will include discussion
o{ student interest in elections and methods to
run elections efficiently.
Does Stanford need any aid in running elec
tions? Can we possibly benefit from proced
ural tips?
These seem like silly guestions after the
farcial primary last spring when five contests
were invalidated.
Election officials from all the schools are ex
pected to be in attendance and present their
ideas and attempt to solve the many problems
which have arisen in the past.
In early November NSA President Harry
Lund is expected to be at Mills to lead a discus
sion on the Foreign Student program. He is
considered to be an expert on this field and
surely Stanford, with its large foreign student
program, can benefit from his experience.
The pessimists, the show-me's, the hecklers,
are getting a chance to see concrete proof in
black and white that Stanford stands to gain
more than a mere fringe benefit.
Il is up to Stanford to'back the organization
if it is to share in the dividends. It is up to the
students to find out what NSA is all about.
There's room for education in this field.
Ever since Stanford joined the National Stu
dent Association pessimistic students have
registered their complaints against the organi
zation without ever giving it a chance to set
its ship on even keel and sail into action. Stu
dents expected something to come out of NSA
that would shake the campus and necessitate
an eight-column banner in the Daily exclaim
ing the news. All this in a year no less.
But the NSA isn't a sensational organization
which promises to remold student governments
drastically and change the campus ways. It is
a hard working body which divides its mem
ber schools into regions, calls them all together
in a summer convention, and then lets them
set their agenda for the year. It is an educating
organization which seeks to cure campus mal
adies by inter-member discussions and through
a common sharing of past experience and ideas.
Stanford has spent a year in getting its ship
in shape and in working out organization prob
lems with the Northern California members
Mills and California.
Many students maintain that Stanford doesn't
need any help and can't possibly gain anything
by remaining in the organization. Stanford en
tered on a one year trial basis and the year is
up. The Executive Committee of ASSU will
vote on the status of NSA in the near future.
A 1 Loomis, NSA Co-ordinator, is fighting for
the organization's life on iampus and is attempt
ing to prove that Stanford can derive as much
as it puts into NSA.
The initial benefits were gained from the
summer conference in Ames, lowa where seven
Stanford delegates pooled their knowledge

port available to students at the ASSU office.
