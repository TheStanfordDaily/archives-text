## On Back to the Farm Week 
### 
'I o the Faculty, Administration, and Students:
Back to the Farm Week was organized this year to
help close the flap between students, faculty, and ad
ministration. Cardinals 1 elt that the only reason this
j>ap existed was because ol a lack of opportunity, not
a lac k of interest or desire.
This proved to be true. Not only did the faculty
and administration entertain at the Farm Follies, have
students to their homes for dinner, and come them
selves to dinner at various living groups, but they as
sumed some of the burdensome details of execution
and planning for Back to the Farm Week.
Cardinals, in conjunction with the student body

extend our thanks to you, along with the hope that
the purpose achieved in Back to the Farm Week will
continue.
We also extend our thanks to the students and
various living groups for their excellent cooperation
and participation in the different activities of the
week.
Sincerely,
MAUREEN MAXWEIjL

Back to the Farm Week
Co-Chairmen.
