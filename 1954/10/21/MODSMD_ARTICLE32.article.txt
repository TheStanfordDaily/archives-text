## Nouhy Tells of Similarity Between U.S. and Egypt 
### HELEN DEWAR 
"Since my arrival in the Unit
ed States, I have been struck by
the similarity between condi
tions here and the growing rac
ial, religious, and financial
equality under the New Regime
in Egypt," ASSU Foreign Schol
ar Nabila Nouhy remarked med
itatively in a recent interview.
"Although we are now passing
through a transition where power is
in the hands of the Revolutionary
Council," she said, "much has been
done to increase the per-capita in
come of the Egyptian.
"We have a land reform law pro
viding the peasants with higher
wages and an opportunity to own
land. Industrial development is de
signed to absorb part of the tre
mendous rural population."
"Popular support is behind the
New Regime," Nabila reasoned, "be
cause it is the best government we
have ever had."
With respect to a recent flare-up
among the Egyptian high command,
Nabila believes that "petty disagree
ments among the Revolutionary
Council should not be taken too se
riously. As long as you are on the
direct road and have one aim, that
being the national welfare, any slight
deviations or quarrels should not be
overemphasized."
NASSAR IS SPARK'
"Naguib is the symbol and chosen
leader of the revolutionary move
ment," .■•.he said, "but Colonel Nas
sar has 'always been the brains and
spark."
In regard to Egyptian-American
relations, Nabila, who graduated
with honors as an economics major
from the American University in
Cairo, can see a very warm feeding
between the two peoples.
"Egyptians are welcoming Ameri
can aid and friendship," she re
marked, "although the government
may hesitate to show its feeling be
cause it has just thrown off the yoke
of British imperialism and wishes
that the people may not misunder
stand American participation.

"Still, although In most of the
Middle East there is the very human
feeling of jealousy of American eco
nomic superiority and the general
feeling that economic assistance
leads to political imperialism, I per
sonally have not noticed any such
feeling in Egypt."
MUTUAL BENEFITS
"The Egyptian government," she
■ explained, "believes that American
j assistance brings mutual benefits to
both nations; that is why we believe
there will be no economic or political
imperialism rising from a condition
of Egyptian dependence on American
aid."
"You'll be amazed," she said
knowingly, "to hear that a great
change has taken place in the tra
ditional anti-British feeling. It has
faded away since the British have
i left the Suez Zone."
In regard to the nervous Egypt-
Israel relations, Nabila stated that it
is her feeling that, "as long as Is
raelites do not move to overtake our
lands, things will be all right. Egypt
wishes first to solve its internal
problems and then work for the
| whole of which it is a part.
"The Communist threat? That is
a job we are fighting with our souls.
We are striving hard to strengthen
j every part of our ecoonmy so that
i the Communists will not find oppor

tunity to take over from within. We
also have special laws against Com
munists. Still, we don't have such a
serious problem in Egypt, and people
don't talk of it too much."
Nabila, who is now studying as a
graduate in economics here, has been
especially impressed by three facets
of American life since she first em
barked on the train that took her
across the country to Stanford.
IMPRESSIONS
Initially she was struck by the
high standard of living of the people,
especially the rural population.
In the second place, she stated that
she "liked the responsibility of the
citizenry, the cleanliness and con
cern with the nation's property and
well-(being."
"And, thirdly," she said, "I like
the complete liberty of the women
here. Egyptian women have eco
nomic and social equality, but not
political. Yet we are doing a very
prominent job in health service and
education in village life."
"I see a marked difference here
and in Egypt," she observed, "in that
here the students are not as much
involved in politics. Whenever there
is a political action distasteful to an
Egyptian student, he will demon
strate against it.
"I like here, too, the intricate stu
dent government and the responsi
bility of the students themselves. I
find here a feeling of friendship, co
operation, and unity which I like
very much."

"Since my arrival in the Unit
ed States, I have been struck by
the similarity between condi
tions here and the growing rac
ial, religious, and financial
equality under the New Regime
in Egypt," ASSU Foreign Schol
ar Nabila Nouhy remarked med
itatively in a recent interview.
"Although we are now passing
through a transition where power is
in the hands of the Revolutionary
Council," she said, "much has been
done to increase the per-capita in
come of the Egyptian.
"We have a land reform law pro
viding the peasants with higher
wages and an opportunity to own
land. Industrial development is de
signed to absorb part of the tre
mendous rural population."
"Popular support is behind the
New Regime," Nabila reasoned, "be
cause it is the best government we
have ever had."
With respect to a recent flare-up
among the Egyptian high command,
Nabila believes that "petty disagree
ments among the Revolutionary
Council should not be taken too se
riously. As long as you are on the
direct road and have one aim, that
being the national welfare, any slight
deviations or quarrels should not be
overemphasized."
NASSAR IS SPARK'
"Naguib is the symbol and chosen
leader of the revolutionary move
ment," .■•.he said, "but Colonel Nas
sar has 'always been the brains and
spark."
In regard to Egyptian-American
relations, Nabila, who graduated
with honors as an economics major
from the American University in
Cairo, can see a very warm feeding
between the two peoples.
"Egyptians are welcoming Ameri
can aid and friendship," she re
marked, "although the government
may hesitate to show its feeling be
cause it has just thrown off the yoke
of British imperialism and wishes
that the people may not misunder
stand American participation.

"Still, although In most of the
Middle East there is the very human
feeling of jealousy of American eco
nomic superiority and the general
feeling that economic assistance
leads to political imperialism, I per
sonally have not noticed any such
feeling in Egypt."
MUTUAL BENEFITS
"The Egyptian government," she
■ explained, "believes that American
j assistance brings mutual benefits to
both nations; that is why we believe
there will be no economic or political
imperialism rising from a condition
of Egyptian dependence on American
aid."
"You'll be amazed," she said
knowingly, "to hear that a great
change has taken place in the tra
ditional anti-British feeling. It has
faded away since the British have
i left the Suez Zone."
In regard to the nervous Egypt-
Israel relations, Nabila stated that it
is her feeling that, "as long as Is
raelites do not move to overtake our
lands, things will be all right. Egypt
wishes first to solve its internal
problems and then work for the
| whole of which it is a part.
"The Communist threat? That is
a job we are fighting with our souls.
We are striving hard to strengthen
j every part of our ecoonmy so that
i the Communists will not find oppor

tunity to take over from within. We
also have special laws against Com
munists. Still, we don't have such a
serious problem in Egypt, and people
don't talk of it too much."
Nabila, who is now studying as a
graduate in economics here, has been
especially impressed by three facets
of American life since she first em
barked on the train that took her
across the country to Stanford.
IMPRESSIONS
Initially she was struck by the
high standard of living of the people,
especially the rural population.
In the second place, she stated that
she "liked the responsibility of the
citizenry, the cleanliness and con
cern with the nation's property and
well-(being."
"And, thirdly," she said, "I like
the complete liberty of the women
here. Egyptian women have eco
nomic and social equality, but not
political. Yet we are doing a very
prominent job in health service and
education in village life."
"I see a marked difference here
and in Egypt," she observed, "in that
here the students are not as much
involved in politics. Whenever there
is a political action distasteful to an
Egyptian student, he will demon
strate against it.
"I like here, too, the intricate stu
dent government and the responsi
bility of the students themselves. I
find here a feeling of friendship, co
operation, and unity which I like
very much."
