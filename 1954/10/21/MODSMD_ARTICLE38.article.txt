# Husky Coach John Cherberg Calls Stanford 'A Fine Team'
## 
### LEE HANSEN 
SEATTLE, Oct. 20—In the midst of rain, wind, and what felt like
snow to a Californian, there sat a tired man with greying hair—a
coach who will have much to do with Stanford's gridiron success
this Saturday. .He was Johnny Cherberg, the Huskies head football
coach.
How do the Indians look to Coach Cherberg? "Stanford has a

fine team with a good solid offense
and a strong defense. We saw the
Stanford-Illinois tilt on TV, and al
though Illinois N was just getting
started, the Cards played an out
standing game against a good team."
And how did Cherberg view
last week's "mishap" with UCLA?
"That's just what it was—an acci
dent. a mishap. We expect Stan
ford to bounce back with viin and
vigor and we are not lessening our
efforts because of one game."
What about the Huskies' 20-21
''moral victory" over UCLA? "We

♦ —
'had them well scouted and matched
our defense to their line. We
dropped two passes in the end zone
in the last minutes of the game.
Washington might have won. But
because we had a 'hot' team and
Stanford suffered what could be
called a coach's nightmare, there's
no reason our positions couldn't
have been reversed.
"I repeat, Stanford is a good team
and a well - rounded one. Brodie,
Gustafson, Tarr—they're good boys.
And the experts rate us as an aver
age, ordinary club that got the
breaks. Don't forget, we're a young
team, with lots of sophomores."
The game Saturday? "No, it won't
be a passing duel, although our
quarterback Bob Cox will give Bro
die some competition. At present
our biggest problem is in improving
our total defense. With no injuries
this week, we hope to start our en
tire first string for a 'wild and wool
ly' game."
What about the PCC champion
ship? "UCLA is the strongest team
on the Pacific Coast and should take
the championship. SC has the best
| chance of going to the Rose Bowl,
i They're undefeated in league com
! petition at the present time. But
| don't forget Washington—and Stan
| ford."
