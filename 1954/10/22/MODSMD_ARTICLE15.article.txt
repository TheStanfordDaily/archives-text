# Freidel: '52 Change 'Not too Enormous'
## 
### MARY ELLEN ROMNEY 
"There has been a change, but it has not been too enormous.
As a historian, I find it amusing and exciting to see the dead cats
thrown back and forth."
So concluded Dr. Frank Freidel, Stanford professor of history
and Roosevelt authority, speaking at the Political Union's first

meeting of the year on the topic "A
Change in '52: Yes or No?"
Dr. Freidel stater) the biggest
change, in his opinion, is the trend
to a "'business - oriented govern
ment." "The Democratic adminis
tration leaned on farm and labor
strength for support, depending on
the lower two-thirds of the economic
strata. The Republicans arc shifting
the emphasis back to the upper third
of the Hoover era."
"Policy determination is again be
ing shifted to the Congress," Dr.
Freidel continued. "As a result, the
power is falling back into the hands
of the old senior Republican Sena
tors, whom I call the 'Bourbon Re
publicans," recalling the French gov
ernment, after the fall of Napoleon:
they have forgotten nothing, learned
nothing."
Dr. Freidel called himself an "In
dependent Demorcat," but said he
would lecture as a non-partisan his
torian.
The major concepts of govern

ment greatly changed during the
last, 20 years, stated Dr. Freidel, and
have to a great extent been carried
on by the Republican administra
tion. "The present government is
still living up to commitments made
in previous years in the fields of
farm, labor, social legislation, and so
forth.
CONCEPTS CHANGED
"The United States has assumed a
position of direct leadership, and
United States citizens have come to
expect, a tremendous amount of eco
nomic control. The whole concept
has changed, and this has remained
through the change in administra
tions."
Dr. Freidel pointed out the new
order in Washington of placing suc
cessful businessmen in important
political positions. "These men may
be tops in industry," he said, "but
they are not even freshmen in poli
tics." He cited Secretary of Defense
Charles E. Wilson as a perfect ex
ample of the politically inept, busi
nessman, who, he said, "has the most
remarkable gift for inappropriate re
marks in the history, of the country.
Wilson and his associates believe
that 'what's good for business is
good for the country,' and haven't
yet. realized that you cannot, run
government like you can run Gen
eral Motors."
FOREIGN POLICY
Enumerating the major i:, ues of
the current Congressional campaign
in the lighl of change, Dr. Freidel
found no significant difference in
foreign policy. "I find the Indochina
'bungling' very similar to the Korea
bungling," he stated.
Dr. Freidel found real achieve
ment in the field of social legislation
by the Republican revision of Ihe
old Roosevelt innovation. "A politi
cally dangerous shift toward the old
Brannan policies" was the trend he
noted in farm policies. "Benson's
flexible price support plan is admir
able, but, will cost, the GOP many
votes."
Taxes, Dr. Freidel stated, are a
complicate! subject, and therefore
not a good campaign issue.
ECONOMIC QUESTION
"Communism, corruption, and Ko
rea—these are the stated issues of
the Republican campaign. But ac
tually it is an economic question:
will rising unemployment and wage
drops lead to a Democratic Con
gress?" In any case, Dr. Freidel
predicts a continuing middle-of-the
road administration, "still going
ahead very much as it has in the
past."

noted in farm policies. "Benson's
flexible price support plan is admir
able, but, will cost, the GOP many
votes."
Taxes, Dr. Freidel stated, are a
complicate! subject, and therefore
not a good campaign issue.
ECONOMIC QUESTION
"Communism, corruption, and Ko
rea—these are the stated issues of
the Republican campaign. But ac
tually it is an economic question:
will rising unemployment and wage
drops lead to a Democratic Con
gress?" In any case, Dr. Freidel
predicts a continuing middle-of-the
road administration, "still going
ahead very much as it has in the
past."
"There has been a change, but it has not been too enormous.
As a historian, I find it amusing and exciting to see the dead cats
thrown back and forth."
So concluded Dr. Frank Freidel, Stanford professor of history
and Roosevelt authority, speaking at the Political Union's first

meeting of the year on the topic "A
Change in '52: Yes or No?"
Dr. Freidel stater) the biggest
change, in his opinion, is the trend
to a "'business - oriented govern
ment." "The Democratic adminis
tration leaned on farm and labor
strength for support, depending on
the lower two-thirds of the economic
strata. The Republicans arc shifting
the emphasis back to the upper third
of the Hoover era."
"Policy determination is again be
ing shifted to the Congress," Dr.
Freidel continued. "As a result, the
power is falling back into the hands
of the old senior Republican Sena
tors, whom I call the 'Bourbon Re
publicans," recalling the French gov
ernment, after the fall of Napoleon:
they have forgotten nothing, learned
nothing."
Dr. Freidel called himself an "In
dependent Demorcat," but said he
would lecture as a non-partisan his
torian.
The major concepts of govern

ment greatly changed during the
last, 20 years, stated Dr. Freidel, and
have to a great extent been carried
on by the Republican administra
tion. "The present government is
still living up to commitments made
in previous years in the fields of
farm, labor, social legislation, and so
forth.
CONCEPTS CHANGED
"The United States has assumed a
position of direct leadership, and
United States citizens have come to
expect, a tremendous amount of eco
nomic control. The whole concept
has changed, and this has remained
through the change in administra
tions."
Dr. Freidel pointed out the new
order in Washington of placing suc
cessful businessmen in important
political positions. "These men may
be tops in industry," he said, "but
they are not even freshmen in poli
tics." He cited Secretary of Defense
Charles E. Wilson as a perfect ex
ample of the politically inept, busi
nessman, who, he said, "has the most
remarkable gift for inappropriate re
marks in the history, of the country.
Wilson and his associates believe
that 'what's good for business is
good for the country,' and haven't
yet. realized that you cannot, run
government like you can run Gen
eral Motors."
FOREIGN POLICY
Enumerating the major i:, ues of
the current Congressional campaign
in the lighl of change, Dr. Freidel
found no significant difference in
foreign policy. "I find the Indochina
'bungling' very similar to the Korea
bungling," he stated.
Dr. Freidel found real achieve
ment in the field of social legislation
by the Republican revision of Ihe
old Roosevelt innovation. "A politi
cally dangerous shift toward the old
Brannan policies" was the trend he
noted in farm policies. "Benson's
flexible price support plan is admir
able, but, will cost, the GOP many
votes."
Taxes, Dr. Freidel stated, are a
