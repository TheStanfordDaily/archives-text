The American Broadcasting Com
pany banner, missing since the na
tionally televised Illinois game Oct.
2, was returned to its owners yes
terday after Officer George Lester
had found it hanging across Lasuen
Street on the banner cable in front
of the Cellar.
The red and gold pennant, valued
at $135, was discovered early yes
terday morning. The standard poles
on cither side of the street were
greased, apparently to prevent
climbing up the poles to reach the
banner.
Officer Lester retrieved the ban
ner from the top of a truck.
