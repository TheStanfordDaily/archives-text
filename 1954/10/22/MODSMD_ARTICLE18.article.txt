How far can they bounce

This game proved that Bobby Cox
's every bit as good as his repute-
Lion, when he uncorked three TD
}as<--es within twenty minutes. It al
o proved that the green Husky line
has acquired polish. In the second
luarter they stopped the Uclan ma
chine three times in goalline stands
it the ten, three, and two-yard -
lines.
In their last outing the Purple
and Gold Huskies were dumped, 34-
7, by the rugged Baylor Bears. This
tilt showed that the northerners can
be scored against via the air route.
AREN'T THAT IJAI)
So much for the Huskies. Now
the Indians.
Chuck Taylor's Redshirts cannot
possibly be as bad as they looked
against UCLA. But, on the other
hand, can they be as good as they
looked against Illinois? Can they
really pull games out of the hole as

they did against COP and Oregon'
Or are they still the team that ha
given up 97 points in two week
without scoring a single tally them
selves?
Now is the time for the Cards t<
reveal what they really are. The;
have to redeem themselves for th<
"exhibition" they put on in thi
Coliseum Saturday. They want ti
win this one for Matt Armitage.
The squad is as ready as evei
John Brodie seems to have come o
age as a passer. John Stewart i
playing ball as if he meant it. Gordii
Young looks sharp. Bill Tarr is a
tough as ever. Jerry Gustafson i
determined to earn the number on<
quarterback position. The India)
forward wall seems ready again.
With the exceptions of Armitagi
and Steve Docter, the whole squto;
is jn shape. They're somewhat bat
terpd after the bruising scrimmage
Taylor has been putting then
through, but they're still ready.
Roy Krickeberg and Dick Jone
are set to go in place of Armitagi
and Docter. Jack Gebert is stil
ready, willing, and perhaps able, t<
boot an extra point.
The time is ripe. Now can the In
dians come through?
How far can they bounce
back?

the Indians.
Chuck Taylor's Redshirts cannot
possibly be as bad as they looked
against UCLA. But, on the other

looked against Illinois? Can they
really pull games out of the hole as
