# Impressive Record
## 
### 
With the 1954 election campaign moving
into its final 10 days, California's Senator
Thomas Kuchel is busily criss-crossing the state
in a serious and industrious attempt to make his
record in Congress known to the voters he has
represented since 1952.
Kuchel has been dubbed the "silent senator"
by his opponent, since the Senator is clearly
building his campaign on his record in Con
gress and his policies, rather than resorting to
mud-slinging and political gyrations.
After serving in the State Assembly and as
State Controller, Kuchel was appointed to the
Senate by former Governor Warren two years
ago. At that time, Warren predicted that
Kuchel would become a "truly outstanding
legislator."
A study of Kuchel's record in the Senate in
dicates that Warren's choice was a wise one
foi the people of California. Kuchel's achieve

ments have beenP impressive both in volume
and in worth.
The junior Senator has authored or co-auth
ored 28 bills that have been passed into law.
As a sub-committee chairman he steered the
passage of the Lease-Purchase Act, a bill which
President Eisenhower says "will greatly affect
the Government's space-acquisition proced
ures for years .to come."
He also sponsored the cotton acreage bill,
the billiqn-dollar Highway Bill, increased So
cial Security coverage, return of the Tidelands
to the states, small-business aid legislation, and
President Eisenhower's program of flexible
farm price supports.
Sena-tor Kuchel has clearly shown himself
qualified to be ranked with Vice President
Nixon and Chief Justice Warren as one of the
most able leaders to come out of California
politics.—W.W.
