# A 						Chance Flipâ€”Or a Vote
## 
### 
Elections are one of the few occasions when
Stanford students may take an active and direct
voice in their government.
Now, the Executive Committee is consider
ing whether or not to partially gag that voice.
Ai their last meeting, Excom discussed what
methods were to be applied in case of a tie
vote in either the primary or the final election.
At first, the only two solutions offered were
decision by lot and decision by Excom in
Executive Session.
We are opposed to both of these solutions.
The law of chance, be it applied in the flip of
a coin or in the drawing of straws, is unfair to
bolh candidates and students. To candidates
because they have expended time, money, and
energy in campaigning. To students because
they want the best man for the job.
Leaving the decision up to Excom is also in
advisable. A group of students, however rep
resentative of the student body they may be,
are not gualified to pick Stanford student lead
ers. Since these leaders will represent the stu
dents, not Excom, they should be selected by
their constituents.
A third suggestion was placed before Excom,
a suggestion that we feel is the only feasible
one. It provides for a runoff election in the
case of a tie.

This motion was approved, nine to four, but,
lacking the three-fourths majority, it was not in
corporated into the ASSU constitution.
Opponents to this measure based their argu
ments on two points. Primarily, they claimed
that Excom was the best judge of what the stu
dents of Stanford wanted. Secondly, they
brought out the expense and time needed for
a runoff.
In our opinion, these objections are unim
portant.
A body like Excom, where personal feelings
are bound to enter into a decision, cannot con
sider itself the final judge on matters of stu
dent elections.
The second objection may be true. Time
would be needed to print up ballots. Extra
personnel would be reguired to man the voting
booths and to count the ballots.
But this is not the prime consideration. The
main point to consider is that the students
should be given the leaders of their choice, re
gardless of time and money.
These leaders should not be picked by lot.
These leaders should not be picked by
Excom.
These leaders should be elected by the stu
dents of Stanford.
