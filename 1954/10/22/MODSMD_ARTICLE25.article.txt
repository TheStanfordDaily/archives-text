# THE 						GREAT FANTASY
## Bogart Deserves Huzzahs For 'Sabrina' Performance 
### BILL WRIGHT 
"Sabrina" may not be the
equal of "Roman Holiday"—the
comparison is a natural because
of Audrey .Hepburn's presence
in both — but Billy Wilder's
comedy attraction now at the
Stanford is delightful, forget
your-midterms entertainment.
Humphrey Bogart, William Hol
den, and Miss Hepburn (now Mrs.
Tl A _ 1 TT* \

Mel Ferrer) run
snappily through
a plot situation
which seems to be
lpproaching clas
sification as the
Great American
Fantasy: the rags
to-riches, cinder-J
ella romance.

Miss Hepburn is the celebrated
expert—one Oscar in one try—at j
playing the gay, charming heroine
in a merry, almost accidental court- I

ship. As Sabrina she again ap
proaches perfection. But impeded
by a slightly sluggish plot, she will
not win the Academy Award this
time around.
To Bogart must go the huzzahs
(as Mahoney would say). He fol
lows his great characterization of
Captain Queeg with an outstanding
portrayal of the cool, calculating
business mogul who shuffles un
countable fortunes at the push of a
button.
Holden is Bogart's playboy, cham
pagne - drinking, marrying brother.
He is headed toward installment
number four, matrimony with a
business touch, when Miss Hepburn,
the chauffeur's daughter, goes into
action. She is fresh from a course in
Paris sophistication and is set on
snaring Holden to satisfy a long
time crush. .
Miss Hepburn knocks Holden for
a loop and thus threatens to knock
big business transactions even far
ther. Bogart, who understands wom
en even less than the rest of us,
comes none-too-gallantly to the res

cue of the financial merger.
Holden is undoubtedly good in hit
role, but there is an intangible feel
ing about his performance whicl
leaves you wondering. Isn't he t
little too blase about the whole
thing?
Walter Hampton, as the father o'.
wealthy brothers, adds immeasur
ably to the comedy with his hugi
cigar and his quest for the elusivi
olive. John Williams is sufficiently
austere as the chauf
feur.
The movie has all the ingredients
required for sensational success -
big-name stars, top-flight direction
standard but good plot, and numer
! ous comic scenes.
But there are a few unnecessary
items tossed about indi'criminately
wiii-'h botch up the recipe. The rol
licking action and many sharp punch
lines are not quite enough to carry
the audience over the dull moments.
Thus "Sabrina" does not provide
the continuous spark needed to pro
ject either itself or its stars into
Oscar contention. But don't miss it.

big business transactions even far
ther. Bogart, who understands wom
en even less than the rest of us,
comes none-too-gallantly to the res

cue of the financial merger.
Holden is undoubtedly good in hit
role, but there is an intangible feel

leaves you wondering. Isn't he t
little too blase about the whole
thing?
Walter Hampton, as the father o'.
wealthy brothers, adds immeasur
ably to the comedy with his hugi

The movie has all the ingredients
required for sensational success -
big-name stars, top-flight direction
standard but good plot, and numer

But there are a few unnecessary
items tossed about indi'criminately

the audience over the dull moments.
Thus "Sabrina" does not provide
the continuous spark needed to pro
ject either itself or its stars into
Oscar contention. But don't miss it.

"Sabrina" may not be the
equal of "Roman Holiday"—the
comparison is a natural because
of Audrey .Hepburn's presence
in both — but Billy Wilder's
comedy attraction now at the
Stanford is delightful, forget
your-midterms entertainment.
Humphrey Bogart, William Hol

Mel Ferrer) run
snappily through
a plot situation
which seems to be
lpproaching clas
sification as the
Great American
Fantasy: the rags
to-riches, cinder-J
ella romance.

Miss Hepburn is the celebrated
expert—one Oscar in one try—at j
playing the gay, charming heroine
in a merry, almost accidental court- I

ship. As Sabrina she again ap
proaches perfection. But impeded
by a slightly sluggish plot, she will
not win the Academy Award this
time around.
To Bogart must go the huzzahs
(as Mahoney would say). He fol
lows his great characterization of
Captain Queeg with an outstanding
portrayal of the cool, calculating
business mogul who shuffles un
countable fortunes at the push of a
button.
Holden is Bogart's playboy, cham
pagne - drinking, marrying brother.
He is headed toward installment
number four, matrimony with a
business touch, when Miss Hepburn,
the chauffeur's daughter, goes into
action. She is fresh from a course in
Paris sophistication and is set on
snaring Holden to satisfy a long
time crush. .
Miss Hepburn knocks Holden for
