### JERKY ROTHSCHILD 
During the days when David Starr Jordan strode
the campus there was an easy informality pervading
the cloistered halls, but the burning zeal for de
mocracy and enlightenment made the man a formid
able figure even so.
One of the prankish undergrads bet another that
he would not dare call the president by his first
name. After being bolstered up by an unnatural dar
ing, the callow youth at length approached President
Jordan on Quad one day.
"Hello, David," he said.
"Don't be so formal," was the answer. "Just call
me Dave."

The prize butch of the season has already been
committed. It appears President Sterling was having
dinner one Sunday night for a group of students.
During the middle of the meal, there came a loud
banging at the door. The maid opened it, and three
sloppy-looking frosh stepped in. Shouted they in the
approved Rabelaisian manner: "Bring on the wim
men."
The astute gentlemen retired in utter rout after
finding that the resemblance of the President's home
to a women's dormitory (Roble), being purely ac
cidental and not such a great resemblance at that,
after you get back and give it a good look, eh
laddies?

A story which Athletic Director A 1 Masters is wont

to tell on himself concerns a "lockout" he gave Mrs.
Masters.
One cold, wintry night upon returning home from
a party, they found that they had forgotten their
keys.
Mr. Masters went around to the back of the house,
climbed in a window, and went to bed—forgetting
his wife, who was shivering on the front steps.

One of the stories that ex-President Hoover used
to tell on himself concerns that nemesis of foot
heavy and fancy-free California motorists: the small
town speed cop.
At a late hour one night a year or so ago, he was
returning from a meeting in Southern California.
Mr. Hoover drove his car through the deserted
streets of the rodeo-and-hamburger-stand-center of
the Pacific Coast at a rate certainly insulting to
traffic conditions in the rodeo metropolis.
There were three people awake in the cow town
that night: Mr. Hoover, his companion, and a speed
cop. All of a sudden there was the tintinnabulation of
a rather well-done imitation of an ambulance.
Mr. Hoover pulieu over to the curb. The cop
accosted the driver: "Where's your driver's license?"
Mr. Hoover produced. The cop studied it a mo
ment. "Are you the guy?" he asked.
"Yes," said Mr. Hoover.
"Well, buddy," came the reply, "If you get any
pleasure out of it, go to it."

the Pacific Coast at a rate certainly insulting to
traffic conditions in the rodeo metropolis.
There were three people awake in the cow town
that night: Mr. Hoover, his companion, and a speed
cop. All of a sudden there was the tintinnabulation of
a rather well-done imitation of an ambulance.
Mr. Hoover pulieu over to the curb. The cop
accosted the driver: "Where's your driver's license?"
Mr. Hoover produced. The cop studied it a mo
ment. "Are you the guy?" he asked.
"Yes," said Mr. Hoover.
"Well, buddy," came the reply, "If you get any
pleasure out of it, go to it."
During the days when David Starr Jordan strode
the campus there was an easy informality pervading
the cloistered halls, but the burning zeal for de
mocracy and enlightenment made the man a formid
able figure even so.
One of the prankish undergrads bet another that
he would not dare call the president by his first
name. After being bolstered up by an unnatural dar
ing, the callow youth at length approached President
Jordan on Quad one day.
"Hello, David," he said.
"Don't be so formal," was the answer. "Just call
me Dave."

The prize butch of the season has already been
committed. It appears President Sterling was having
dinner one Sunday night for a group of students.
During the middle of the meal, there came a loud
banging at the door. The maid opened it, and three
sloppy-looking frosh stepped in. Shouted they in the
approved Rabelaisian manner: "Bring on the wim
men."
The astute gentlemen retired in utter rout after
finding that the resemblance of the President's home
to a women's dormitory (Roble), being purely ac
cidental and not such a great resemblance at that,
after you get back and give it a good look, eh
laddies?

A story which Athletic Director A 1 Masters is wont

to tell on himself concerns a "lockout" he gave Mrs.
Masters.
One cold, wintry night upon returning home from
a party, they found that they had forgotten their
keys.
Mr. Masters went around to the back of the house,
climbed in a window, and went to bed—forgetting
his wife, who was shivering on the front steps.

One of the stories that ex-President Hoover used
to tell on himself concerns that nemesis of foot
heavy and fancy-free California motorists: the small
town speed cop.
At a late hour one night a year or so ago, he was
returning from a meeting in Southern California.
Mr. Hoover drove his car through the deserted
streets of the rodeo-and-hamburger-stand-center of
the Pacific Coast at a rate certainly insulting to
traffic conditions in the rodeo metropolis.

that night: Mr. Hoover, his companion, and a speed
cop. All of a sudden there was the tintinnabulation of
