# CAMPUS OPINION
## A
						Little Band of Malcontents' 
### 
To the Editor:
In the last few clays you have followed the strike
of the announcers and technicians of KEAR. You
have consistently shown the union side of the argu
ment and not the management's. There is a great deal
to be said for them, and if you are not going to pi-e
-sent a fair view of the situation, it would be best if
you presented none at all.

The majority of the students at Stanford favor the
KEAR side of the dispute and the Daily, in spite of
its editors, is still an organ of the students. If it will
not reflect their opinions, it could at least refrain
from attacking them. I trust that your judgment in
the future will reflect a more balanced view of the
world and not that of a little band of malcontents.
