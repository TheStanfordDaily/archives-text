DRY RUSHING REPEALED—The
clause prohibiting the serving of beer
at fraternity rushing parties recently
was stricken from the Intra-Fratern
ity Council constitution at San Jose
State. The clause, which had been
voted down, was accidentally in
serted in 1953 when the IFC con
stitution was revised. The serving
of beer at rush affairs is left to the
discretion of the individual house.

TRAPPED—A University of Cali
fornia electronics instructor was
caught 'by one of his own devices
recently. He was convicted of speed
ing in Oakland by the testimony of
his own radar speed trap. The elec
tronics expert was fined $5 plus $1
for the state's educational fund. He
has appealed the decision on the
grounds that the radar device was a
'.-peed trap." Section 751 of the
State Vehicle Code outlaws evidence
| obtained from "speed traps."
