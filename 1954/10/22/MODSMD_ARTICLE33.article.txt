# Art Gallery Exhibits Work Of Ex-Stanford Student
## 
### MATT PHILLIPS 
The Stanford Art Gallery has
on display a new exhibit by a
contemporary artist. Bryan Wil
son, a former Stanford student,
is represented by 14 oils, two
water-colors, and one sculpture, |
which may be seen until Nov. 7.
In many respects it is a genuine '
pleasure to report on Wilson's paint
ings, for not only is the total impres- j
sion of the exhibit pleasing and sat
isfactory, but—taste aside —one can
objectively discern an original and j.
creative talent, whose picures merit j
serious consideration.
His subject is nature; more spe
cifically landscapes, birds, and ani
mals. By virtue of his plastic means j
he has (though not uniformly so) !
managed to catch the spirit of his j
subjects in a striking and aestheti
cally moving fashion. Regarding the
large landscapes, his color is fresh
and lively, and though his palette
is limited, he reveals to us a light
ness that is moving throughout.
USE OF COLOR
Like his predecessors the impres
sionists, and one of his masters,
Bonnard, he employs patches of
multiple colors to create animation,
light, and space. However, in both
color scheme and over-all applica
tion of brushwork, a difference be
tween the two is obvious.
Of the treatment of space we may
observe a fondness for toying with
effects which are generally engaging
because of the contrast between
deep and foreshortened space (e.g.,
"Landscape With Egrets," "Tules,"
and "Sturnella Neclecta").
With respect to his bird pictures,
however, and aside from the primi
tive and almost Indian character he
creates in them, both the limited
color range and the abridgment of

special effects narrows the final ef
fect to mere pattern.
INDIVIDUALIST
Nevertheless, when compared to
the well-known Morris Graves, an
other American painter of birds, it
is quite apparent that Wilson's treat
ment of them is much more indi
vidual, daring, and plastically sig
nificant.
Because of the conception of his
forms, or perhaps due to his haste to
record his experiences, Wilson fre

quently neglects to carry out or
complete some of his compositions.
Thus some are deficient in any
drawing power whatsoever, and oth
ers are merely beginnings of possi
bilities.
For this reviewer the single most
satisfactory painting is the one titled
"Tules." Here the tradition of Rous
seau and Bonnard, to name but two,
are successfully fused and endowed
with a spirit quite his own. It is a
daring composition and will reward
repeated visits.

The Stanford Art Gallery has
on display a new exhibit by a
contemporary artist. Bryan Wil
son, a former Stanford student,
is represented by 14 oils, two
water-colors, and one sculpture, |
which may be seen until Nov. 7.
In many respects it is a genuine '
pleasure to report on Wilson's paint
ings, for not only is the total impres- j
sion of the exhibit pleasing and sat
isfactory, but—taste aside —one can
objectively discern an original and j.
creative talent, whose picures merit j
serious consideration.
His subject is nature; more spe
cifically landscapes, birds, and ani
mals. By virtue of his plastic means j
he has (though not uniformly so) !
managed to catch the spirit of his j
subjects in a striking and aestheti
cally moving fashion. Regarding the
large landscapes, his color is fresh
and lively, and though his palette
is limited, he reveals to us a light
ness that is moving throughout.
USE OF COLOR
Like his predecessors the impres
sionists, and one of his masters,
Bonnard, he employs patches of
multiple colors to create animation,
light, and space. However, in both
color scheme and over-all applica
tion of brushwork, a difference be
tween the two is obvious.
Of the treatment of space we may
observe a fondness for toying with
effects which are generally engaging
because of the contrast between
deep and foreshortened space (e.g.,
"Landscape With Egrets," "Tules,"
and "Sturnella Neclecta").
With respect to his bird pictures,
however, and aside from the primi
tive and almost Indian character he
creates in them, both the limited
color range and the abridgment of

special effects narrows the final ef
fect to mere pattern.
INDIVIDUALIST
Nevertheless, when compared to
the well-known Morris Graves, an
other American painter of birds, it
is quite apparent that Wilson's treat
ment of them is much more indi
vidual, daring, and plastically sig
nificant.
Because of the conception of his
forms, or perhaps due to his haste to
record his experiences, Wilson fre

quently neglects to carry out or
complete some of his compositions.
Thus some are deficient in any
drawing power whatsoever, and oth
ers are merely beginnings of possi
bilities.
For this reviewer the single most
satisfactory painting is the one titled
"Tules." Here the tradition of Rous
seau and Bonnard, to name but two,
are successfully fused and endowed
with a spirit quite his own. It is a
daring composition and will reward
repeated visits.
