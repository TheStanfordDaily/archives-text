# These Huskies Will Test Indian Gridders

### 


TOUGH TRIO â€”These three Washington Huskies are primed to
ruin Stanford's "Operation Bounce Back" tomorrow afternoon
in the Stadium. At left is Stew Crook, a 190-pound six-footer,
who is playing his second year on the Washington first string.
Last year he handled halfback chores, but this season he
switched to fullback to become the Huskies' outstanding run
ning back. Center is Earl Monlux, a 205-pound junior guard who
has received a pre-season All-American build-up. But Husky
publicist Bert Rose says that Monlux has been a disappoint
ment. Bill Albrecht is the slashing Husky halfback at right. He
led all Huskies in amount of game action in 1952 (408 minutes),
but last year was out with a broken leg.
