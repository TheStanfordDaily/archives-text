# Cards Face Old Husky Jinx On Saturday
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
Stanford will try 10 break a
five-year jinx tomorrow when
Ihey meet the Washington
Huskies. Not since 1948 when
Stanford ground out a 20-0 win
over UW has the home team
come out on top.
The Cards are comfortably ahead,
having chalked up 17 wins in 30
! games. Washington has won 10 times
and there have been three ties. The
series .started in 1893 when Stanford
beat the Huskies 40-0 in Seattle, but
! the two did not meet again until
1920.
The Cards handed Washington an
| other 40-0 licking in 1949, but the
' largest ignominy the Huskies have
heaped upon Stanford was a 25-0
trouncing in 1947.
Perhaps the strangest game of
rivalry was in 1939 at Seattle.
Stanford scored a field goal and a
safety, hut the Iluskv was supreme
J with a touchdown and a safety as
they chalked up a baseball score
X-5 decision.
Don Heinrich, the Bremerton
Bomber, had two of his greatest days
| against the Cardinal and White, jn
1950 and 1952. His passes led the
i Huskies to two wins. 21-7 and,
27-14.
Stanford's most recent wins were
! 1951 and 1953. In the Rose Bowl
season of 1951, Kerkorian, Hugasian,
j and McColl were too much for speed -
I ster Hugh McElhenny et al and
hung up a tough 14-7 win.
Last year Washington got olT one
of its better efforts of an unsuc
cessful season against the Indians.
Stanford got off to first quarter
lead when Ron Cook took a Husky
punt on the Card 49 and went all
! the way. In the second quarter
; Stanford drove 43 yards in four
plays with Cook scoring again on
a 15 yard screen pass from Boh
| Garrett.
Washington came back strong in
the second half and sent Jack Nu
gent 10 yards around end to cap a
G3 yard drive, to make the score 12-
7. This was the final score, but the
Huskies had one touchdown called
back, and Sandy Lederman came
close with long passes to beating the
| Cards.
