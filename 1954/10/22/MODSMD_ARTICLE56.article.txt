# JV'S to Face Humboldt
## 
### 
Stanford's unbeaten Junior Var
sity collides with a tough Humboldt
State College team tomorrow night
at Eureka.
Humboldt, coached by Phil Sarboe,
former head man at WSC, has won
its last four games after dropping
the opener to Williamette by a 10-19
score. In these last four tilts the
Humboldters have scored 116 points
to their opponents' seven.
The Braves have run wild over
their opponents so far this year, win
ning four games while dropping
none, but Humboldt promises to pro
vide the toughest opposition of the
year.
Both teams feature a T or Split
T attack sparked by an outstanding
quarterback. For the Indians it will
be Jack Lewis under center, while
Merl Hagbo will do the signal-call
ing for the Staters.
At ends for Stanford will be Ed
McLellan and Frank Hook, at tack
les, Dale Smith and Bob Seymore,
at guards will be Walt Eagle and
Wes Wedge. Center will be Don
Geddes, while Jim Stewart, Jerry
Angove and Dick Crepau will round
out the backfield with Lewis.
