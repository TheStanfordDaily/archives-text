## 
### LARRY JENSEN 
Sparked by the running and pass
ing of Gary Larson, the Delts edged
out the Betas, 6-0, yesterday in in
tramural football play.
Midway through the first half,
Larson engineered the only touch
down drive of the game. Starting on
the Delt 37, Larson ran 11 yards to
the Beta 32. From there, he passed
to Bob Gledhill on the Beta 22 and
then threw to Terry Evans in the
end zone for the touchdown. A
Larson to Evans pass for the extra
point fell incomplete.
The Delts threatened repeatedly
throughout the game, but were halt
ed four times Â»on pass interceptions
inside the Beta line.
The Betas were in Delt territory
only once during the game. Late in
the second half, they took over on
downs on the Delt 39. Dan Feltham
completed a 12-yard *pass to Tom
Shepard, but on the next play Delt
Kirk Nieland intercepted a Feltham
pass and ran it back to the Beta 30.
The Delts almost added another
touchdown when Larson threw 15
yards to Marty Spangler and five
yards to Gledhill, but Beta Mike
Arnstein intercepted Larson's next
pass on his own five.
Feltham tried to pull the game out
of the fire for the Betas with last
second long passes. He completed
one for 15 yards, but on the last
play of the game Feltham was
snowed under attempting to pass.
