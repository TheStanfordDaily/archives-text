# New Cage Mentor Is Coaching by Film
## 
### 
Howie Dallmar, Stanford new head basketball coach, has a prob
lem. He's the coach of a team he hasn't seen yet.
Dallmar transferred last Spring from the University of Pennsyl
vania to Stanford, where he replaced Bob Burnett at the cage helm.
The first basketball game is in a few weeks, yet Dallmar hasn't

seen his club perform. PCC rules'
prohibit basketball practice before
November Ist. That's only five weeks
before the initial tilt against San
Jose State.
The regulations hamper Dallmar
more than the veteran coaches. He
hasn't seen a Stanford team play
since 1950, when the Cards met his
Pennsylvania dub.
All he has to go on are two mo
tion picture films of the Oregon
and Washington games last season.
They weren't the Card's best, com
ing early in the year.
Needless to say, with that little
contact with his team, he's studied
those two films scrupulously. By
now, he knows every movement in
the two contests.
Despite his lack of contact with
the Pavilion and his players, Dall
mar is confident about the upcom
ing season. "We have the two lead
ing scorers returning this year —
George Selleck and Russ Lawler.
Besides, Ron Tomsic will play for us
again after missing most of last sea
son with an injury.
"Besides these returning starters,
there are a number of reserves and
freshmen from last year who I think
will help us. But it will be a tough
season.
"We have a tough schedule. We
make an Eastern tour, playing such
teams as Seton Hall, Tulane,
Vanderbilt, and lowa. In.,addition,
we travel to Honolulu for their
Invitational."

Even if the Cards don't win games,
they'll know their geography.
At any rate, wheh November Ist
rolls around, the team will work un
usually hard. Dallmar is anxious
to quit watching his two films and
at least view the real thing.
