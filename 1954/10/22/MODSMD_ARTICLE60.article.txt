# USF Tests Indians In Soccer Tilt
## 
### 
The Stanford soccer team will get
its fi 171 real test of the season this
Saturday morning at 10. The In
dian Looters, who racked up a (J-l
victory over San Jose State two
weeks ago, clash with mighty USF,
perennial We. t Coast soccer champs.
Two weeks ago, the powerful Dons
had a 56-game unbeaten string bro
ken, but lost a 5-4 tilt to CCSF.
Lai.t week they drubbed weak San
Jose. And this week, the revenge
inclined Hi 11 toppers hope to get a
new streak rolling against the Cards,
who after two rounds are the only
undefeated and untied team in the
league.
Stanford marred USF's perfect
record last year, holding (Jus
Donohue's Dons to a scoreless tie
in the season's finale. This season,
the Indians hope to go one better.
The Indians' forward line, which
has scored 13 goals in its lirst two
outings, looks strong. It is sparked
by All-America left inside Sam Sua
rez, and is complemented by Niels
Vinding, Bill Wren, Geoff Gregory,
and Dick Koenigsberger.
The forwards are lent support by
a stalwart halfback line composed
of Sam Register, Don Yates, and Pe
ter Mack. Veteran Ken Woods holds
the goalie position.
USF graduated several men off
last year's championship team. But
the brilliant George Durshlag is only
starting his second year as goalie,
and he has All - America fullback
Fred Kellerman in front of him.
