## 
### JOANNE OLSON 
At. the district meeting of the
National Student. Association last
Thursday, representatives of Stan
ford, Mills College, and the Uni
versity of California compared
campus election practices and
problems.
Sam Palmer, Erie Flicker, find
A1 Wilson of the Axe Society,
which has recently been put in
charge of ASSU elections, were
among the Stanford students at
tending. Palmer, Axe Society
president, stud of the meeting: 'A
lot of good ideas came out of it
which will he profitable to elec
tions here in the future."
One problem discussed was the
procedure to he followed in case
of a tie vote. Cal. like Stanford,
has only two candidates for each
office in the finals. Ties arc re
solved I y means of a run-ofT elec
tion.
Cal ■ 11.* f> limits campaigning be
fore final elections to two or three
days, allowing eight to 10 days be
fore primaries. At Stanford there
is a full week of campaigning be
fore both primaries and finals.
The use of voting machines in

elections here has been con: iclered
in the past. Cal reported a sue
ccs. ful use of the machines, as
they increased speed and accuracy
of vote tabulation, and also seemed
to bring out a larger percentage of
voters. The only problem was that
of educating the tudents in the
proper use of the machicns.
Another idea from Cal was to
require 100 signatures on nomina
tion petitions for class office:- and
150 for student body offices. Only
15 names are necessary on ASSU
election petitions. It wa, suggested
that the larger number might help
to discourage those not seriously
interested in the office.
The ASUC also require all can
didates to pass an examination on
the workings of the .Indent gov
ernment before they are eligible
to enter the primaries.
The election methods of Mills
were found not generally appli
cable to a school as laigi a: Stan
