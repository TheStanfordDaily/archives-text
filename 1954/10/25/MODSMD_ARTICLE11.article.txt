### 
BONN, Oct. 24 (UP;—Chancellor
Konrsd Adenauer today called a
special meeting of his coalition cab
inet tomorrow to chart a campaign
to quell a mounting revolt in West
Germany against, the Paris agree
ments on sovereignty and rearma
ment.
A l the same time Adenauer
planned to consult his ministers on
the new Soviet note calling for free
■ill-German elections and a Big Four
conference.
Officials of the Bonn regime joined
Allied authorities in denouncing the
Soviet note as merely another effort
to wreck the plans for rearming
West Germany.
Adenauer was scheduled to leave
by plane for Washington Tuesday
morning. He will confer with Presi
dent Ei; '-nhower and Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles. While in
the United States he also will re
ceive an honorary degree from Co
lumbia University.
Adenauer returned in triumph
from Paris last night after signing
the interlocking pacts giving the
Bonn rcpublc virtually unlimited in
dependence and authorizing rearma
ment, within the North Atlantic
Treaty and Brussels alliances.
