# Indians Show 'Operation Bounceback' By Trouncing Fumbling Huskies, 13-7
## Coach Taylor 'Disappointed' 
### 
The drought has ended.
"Operation Bounceback" is
temporarily, at least, a success.
Stanford once again is in the vic
tory column, as they chalked up
a 13-7 triumph over the Uni
versity of Washington Huskies.
The game also marked the end of
one of the longest scoreless periods
in recent Stanford history. When
Jerry Gustafson sneaked over in
the first quarter, it marked the first
Stanford score since John Stewart
caught a scoring pass in the Illinois
game. Not since 1939 had the Cards
been blanked for two consecutive
contests.
The win leaves the door to Pasa
dena still open. The USC Trojans,
who squeaked past Cal last Satur
day, constitute a large obstruction.
And Washington State, which was
upset by Idaho 10-0, will be looking
for revenge in next Saturday's game,
while the Cards may be looking
ahead to El Troy the following week.
The Stanford effort was not over
ly impressive, but any time you
beat a team that lost to UCLA by
only one point, it's good. Especially
if you lost to the Bruins 0-72 the
week before.

Stanford recovered five Husky
fumbles, one of which camc just, as
white - jerseyed Bob Dunn hit the
Stanford goal for what would have
been the tying points. Gordy Young
grabbed the loose ball, held it aloft
tor the officials to see. and Stanford
took over on the 20. This was the
ball game to all intents and pur
poses.
Coach Chuck Taylor was disap
pointed in the outcome. "I was sure
we'd beat them, but our drives dur
ing the second half seemed to bog
down." Taylor also thought Stan
ford got most of the breaks, but the
Huskies can't complain too loudly.
WASHINGTON SCORES
The lone Washington score was
set up on a questionable interference
call on Jerry Gustafson, when he
batted Bob Cox's 55-yard pass in
tended for Jack Kyllingstad to the
ground. The officials ruled that Gus
hit Kyllingstad before he hit thn
ball, and gave the ball to the Purple
and Gold on the one-yard line.

UP AND OVER—BiII Tarr put Stanford ahead to stay on this
play in the second quarter. Tarr capped an 84-yard drive as he
hurdled into the end zone. Bob Cox has an arm around Tarr
while Bob McNamee reaches out for the Indian fullback. Identi

the year for Stanford on the next play, in the foreground, Roy
Krickeberg and Jerry Goldberg, face down under Tarr. Jim

OPERATION BOUNCEBACK—Card quarterback Jerry Gustaf
son scored the first Indian touchdown in the first quarter last
Saturday on a sneak with guard Tony Mosich (69) leading the
way. After a penalty moved the Cards back to the Washington
nine, Bill Tarr, with an eight-yard end run, set up the score on
the play before. - Daily photo by John Leutcher
disaster for Washington but a quick
whittle saved the Huskies. Cox went
hack to pa i s, was caught, but man
aged to get the ball away. A Card
lineman .stuck up a paw and de
fkcted the ball into the hands of biv
215-pound tackle John Ludeke who
set off toward the Husky goal and
vitions of a lineman's dream come
true, a touchdown. But
ruled that Cox had been stopped
before the ball was in the air.
Bob Cox, the only GO-rninulc man
of the day, stole the show for the

visitors as he turned in a Heinrich
like performance, completing 10 of
16 passes for 158 yards. Several
times he wound up and threw the
55 yards into the hands of Washing
ton receivers.
TAYLOR UNIMPRESSED
Taylor* was unimpressed by the
youngster, though. He said Cox's
high floaters should have been
| knocked over by a more alert Stan
; ford secondary. However, it was
! Cox who sifiglehandedly almost beat
UCLA two "weeks ago, and a Bruin
fingertip just did cite fleet a Cox pass
headed for Jim Houston who was
all alone in the end zone for what
would have given UW a 27-21 win.
And Taylor certainly can't knock the
UCLA pass defense, for remember
those eight interceptions last week
end?
Several times two or three red
! shirts would go up with one Husky
1 to bat down a Cox pass that was on
I its mark. Granted that Cox isn't a

Garrett yet, but then neither was
Garrett when he was only a sopho
more.
TAYLOR PRAISES
On the other side of the ledger,
Taylor was very Well pleased with
Jerry Gustafcon and Bill Tarr. And,
lie added, "don't forget Dorsey At
kinson," who endeared himself to all
Stanford rooters and brought forth
the loudest and longest cheers ol
die day when, after Tarr scored the
second TD, he booted the ball long
and square through the uprights lor
an extra point,
Gu tafson, playing almost the en
tile game, showed very well on
plit-T option plays, and his pass
ing was very promising. He com
pleted five out of 15 for 113 yards
including lour to John Stewart, who
continued his fine showing in the
UCLA game.
Stewart played a terrific game on
offense as he caught five passes and
his defensive work looked up, too.
He saved Stanford much embarrass
ment when Steve Roake picked off
a Gustafson pass to* Stewart and
set oft' down the sideline with two
blockers. One of them hit Stewart,
who was coming up from behind,
but the rangy end rode over the
block and tripped up Roakeby the
shoestrings.
All in all, Stanford didn't look too
impressive, but any time you come
hack after a slaughter like last week
to win 13-7 over a representative
team, it's a big step in the right di
rection.

WASHINGTON SCORES
The lone Washington score was
set up on a questionable interference
call on Jerry Gustafson, when he
batted Bob Cox's 55-yard pass in
tended for Jack Kyllingstad to the
ground. The officials ruled that Gus
hit Kyllingstad before he hit thn
ball, and gave the ball to the Purple
and Gold on the one-yard line.

UP AND OVER—BiII Tarr put Stanford ahead to stay on this
play in the second quarter. Tarr capped an 84-yard drive as he
hurdled into the end zone. Bob Cox has an arm around Tarr

OPERATION BOUNCEBACK—Card quarterback Jerry Gustaf
son scored the first Indian touchdown in the first quarter last
Saturday on a sneak with guard Tony Mosich (69) leading the
way. After a penalty moved the Cards back to the Washington
nine, Bill Tarr, with an eight-yard end run, set up the score on
the play before. - Daily photo by John Leutcher
disaster for Washington but a quick
whittle saved the Huskies. Cox went
hack to pa i s, was caught, but man
aged to get the ball away. A Card
lineman .stuck up a paw and de
fkcted the ball into the hands of biv
215-pound tackle John Ludeke who
set off toward the Husky goal and
vitions of a lineman's dream come
true, a touchdown. But
ruled that Cox had been stopped
before the ball was in the air.
Bob Cox, the only GO-rninulc man
of the day, stole the show for the

visitors as he turned in a Heinrich
like performance, completing 10 of
16 passes for 158 yards. Several
times he wound up and threw the
55 yards into the hands of Washing
ton receivers.
TAYLOR UNIMPRESSED
Taylor* was unimpressed by the
youngster, though. He said Cox's
high floaters should have been
| knocked over by a more alert Stan
; ford secondary. However, it was
! Cox who sifiglehandedly almost beat
UCLA two "weeks ago, and a Bruin
fingertip just did cite fleet a Cox pass
headed for Jim Houston who was
all alone in the end zone for what
would have given UW a 27-21 win.
And Taylor certainly can't knock the
UCLA pass defense, for remember
those eight interceptions last week
end?
Several times two or three red
! shirts would go up with one Husky
1 to bat down a Cox pass that was on
I its mark. Granted that Cox isn't a

Garrett yet, but then neither was
Garrett when he was only a sopho
more.
TAYLOR PRAISES
On the other side of the ledger,
Taylor was very Well pleased with
Jerry Gustafcon and Bill Tarr. And,
lie added, "don't forget Dorsey At
kinson," who endeared himself to all
Stanford rooters and brought forth
the loudest and longest cheers ol
die day when, after Tarr scored the
second TD, he booted the ball long
and square through the uprights lor
an extra point,
Gu tafson, playing almost the en
tile game, showed very well on
plit-T option plays, and his pass
ing was very promising. He com
pleted five out of 15 for 113 yards
including lour to John Stewart, who
continued his fine showing in the
UCLA game.
Stewart played a terrific game on
offense as he caught five passes and
his defensive work looked up, too.
He saved Stanford much embarrass
ment when Steve Roake picked off
a Gustafson pass to* Stewart and
set oft' down the sideline with two
blockers. One of them hit Stewart,
who was coming up from behind,
but the rangy end rode over the
block and tripped up Roakeby the
shoestrings.
All in all, Stanford didn't look too
impressive, but any time you come
hack after a slaughter like last week
to win 13-7 over a representative
team, it's a big step in the right di
rection.
The drought has ended.
"Operation Bounceback" is
temporarily, at least, a success.
Stanford once again is in the vic
tory column, as they chalked up
a 13-7 triumph over the Uni
versity of Washington Huskies.
The game also marked the end of
one of the longest scoreless periods
in recent Stanford history. When
Jerry Gustafson sneaked over in
the first quarter, it marked the first
Stanford score since John Stewart
caught a scoring pass in the Illinois
game. Not since 1939 had the Cards
been blanked for two consecutive
contests.
The win leaves the door to Pasa
dena still open. The USC Trojans,
who squeaked past Cal last Satur
day, constitute a large obstruction.
And Washington State, which was
upset by Idaho 10-0, will be looking
for revenge in next Saturday's game,
while the Cards may be looking
ahead to El Troy the following week.
The Stanford effort was not over
ly impressive, but any time you
beat a team that lost to UCLA by
only one point, it's good. Especially
if you lost to the Bruins 0-72 the
week before.
