# Indians Show 'Operation Bounceback' By Trouncing Fumbling Huskies, 13-7
## Coach Taylor 'Disappointed' 
### 
The drought has ended.
"Operation Bounceback" is
temporarily, at least, a success.
Stanford once again is in the vic
tory column, as they chalked up
a 13-7 triumph over the Uni
versity of Washington Huskies.
The game also marked the end of
one of the longest scoreless periods
in recent Stanford history. When
Jerry Gustafson sneaked over in
the first quarter, it marked the first
Stanford score since John Stewart
caught a scoring pass in the Illinois
game. Not since 1939 had the Cards
been blanked for two consecutive
contests.
The win leaves the door to Pasa
dena still open. The USC Trojans,
who squeaked past Cal last Satur
day, constitute a large obstruction.
And Washington State, which was
upset by Idaho 10-0, will be looking
for revenge in next Saturday's game,
while the Cards may be looking
ahead to El Troy the following week.
The Stanford effort was not over
ly impressive, but any time you
beat a team that lost to UCLA by
only one point, it's good. Especially
if you lost to the Bruins 0-72 the
week before.
FUMBLES RKCOVKRKI)
Stanford recovered five Husky
fumbles, one of which camc just, as
white - jerseyed Bob Dunn hit the
Stanford goal for what would have
been the tying points. Gordy Young
grabbed the loose ball, held it aloft
tor the officials to see. and Stanford
took over on the 20. This was the
ball game to all intents and pur
poses.
Coach Chuck Taylor was disap
pointed in the outcome. "I was sure
we'd beat them, but our drives dur
ing the second half seemed to bog
down." Taylor also thought Stan
ford got most of the breaks, but the
Huskies can't complain too loudly.
WASHINGTON SCORES
The lone Washington score was
set up on a questionable interference
call on Jerry Gustafson, when he
batted Bob Cox's 55-yard pass in
tended for Jack Kyllingstad to the
ground. The officials ruled that Gus
hit Kyllingstad before he hit thn
ball, and gave the ball to the Purple
and Gold on the one-yard line.
