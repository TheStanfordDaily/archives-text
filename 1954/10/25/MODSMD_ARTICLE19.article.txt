# Why No Proclamation?
## 
### 
One of the most amazing examples of ex
treme provincialism, narrow-sightedness, and
confusion we have ever witnessed was dis
played this past weekend by Goodwin J.
Knight, governor of California.
Mr. Knight refused to allow California —the
home of the United Nations—to participate of
ficially in the world-wide celebration of United
Nations Day yesterday.
Apparently the Governor was somewhat
baffled by the problems of United Nations Day,
so he solved his dilemma by doing nothing.
He issued a statement to the press which
read, in part:
"Numerous requests have been received for
the issuance of proclamations on the same date
for divergent observances. You will under
stand that ... to accede to all such requests
would result in a number of different procla
mations for the same date, thus defeating the
purpose of any proclamation."
Yes, Mr. Knight had quite a difficult choice
to make.
On one side he had President Eisenhower's
request that all states join in the international
celebration of the signing of the United Nations
Charter on October 24.
On the other side he was faced by a group
known as The United States Day Committee,
Inc. This organization carries the endorsement
of segregation's greatest proponent, Governor
Herman Talmadge of Georgia.
The United States Day Committee has de

nounced the "hullabaloo about the United Na
tions as 'the one hope of peace' as a smoke
screen hiding what is going on behind the
scenes."
The group had urged governors to proclaim
October 24 as "United States Day" rather than
"United Nations Day." Governor J. Bracken
Lee of Utah went along with the committee—
and drew a sharp rebuke from the White House.
This, then, was the difficult choice facing Mr.
Knight. Perhaps he had a few letters urging
him to proclaim October 24 as "Kennel Dog
Day" or "California Poppy Day" or "The Week
before Halloween Day," but we can assume
these requests didn't weigh on his mind too
heavily.
The upshot of his deliberations and consul
tations with his staff was announced Saturday.
Mr. Knight would issue no proclamation.
- Does this mean that Mr. Knight doesn't think
the United Nations is an' important enough
group to honor with a special day? Or that
California, this unique land of milk and honey
and sunshine, doesn't need to be concerned
with the world beyond its borders? Or that the
United States Day Committee Inc. and its re
quests are just as important as the United Na
tions and its requests?
We hope not. And we feel our disgust and
embarrassment over Mr. Knight's course of in
action is shared by thousands of other Cali
fornians and by the United States as a whole.

played this past weekend by Goodwin J.
Knight, governor of California.
Mr. Knight refused to allow California —the
home of the United Nations—to participate of
ficially in the world-wide celebration of United
Nations Day yesterday.
Apparently the Governor was somewhat
baffled by the problems of United Nations Day,
so he solved his dilemma by doing nothing.
He issued a statement to the press which
read, in part:
"Numerous requests have been received for
the issuance of proclamations on the same date
for divergent observances. You will under
stand that ... to accede to all such requests
would result in a number of different procla
mations for the same date, thus defeating the
purpose of any proclamation."
Yes, Mr. Knight had quite a difficult choice
to make.
On one side he had President Eisenhower's
request that all states join in the international
celebration of the signing of the United Nations
Charter on October 24.
On the other side he was faced by a group
known as The United States Day Committee,
Inc. This organization carries the endorsement
of segregation's greatest proponent, Governor
Herman Talmadge of Georgia.
The United States Day Committee has de

nounced the "hullabaloo about the United Na
tions as 'the one hope of peace' as a smoke
screen hiding what is going on behind the
scenes."
The group had urged governors to proclaim
October 24 as "United States Day" rather than
"United Nations Day." Governor J. Bracken
Lee of Utah went along with the committee—
and drew a sharp rebuke from the White House.
This, then, was the difficult choice facing Mr.
Knight. Perhaps he had a few letters urging
him to proclaim October 24 as "Kennel Dog
Day" or "California Poppy Day" or "The Week
before Halloween Day," but we can assume
these requests didn't weigh on his mind too
heavily.
The upshot of his deliberations and consul
tations with his staff was announced Saturday.
Mr. Knight would issue no proclamation.
- Does this mean that Mr. Knight doesn't think
the United Nations is an' important enough
group to honor with a special day? Or that
California, this unique land of milk and honey
and sunshine, doesn't need to be concerned
with the world beyond its borders? Or that the
United States Day Committee Inc. and its re
quests are just as important as the United Na
tions and its requests?
We hope not. And we feel our disgust and
embarrassment over Mr. Knight's course of in
action is shared by thousands of other Cali
fornians and by the United States as a whole.
One of the most amazing examples of ex
treme provincialism, narrow-sightedness, and
confusion we have ever witnessed was dis
