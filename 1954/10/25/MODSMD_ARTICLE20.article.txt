## On Senator Kuchel's Record 
### 
To the Editor:
As prt)cJaimed in Friday's editorial, an "impressive
record" has indeed been established by the junior
Republican Senator from California. The impression
is drear, dismal, and depressing.
Today our President needs the greatest freedom
in executing our foreign policy. Therefore Mr. Eisen
hower fought the odious Bricker Amendment, which
would have tied his hands in international relations.
The junior senator, who seeks election on the basis
of his claimed support of the President, opposed the
President und voted for the Bricker Amendment.
(100 Cong. Rec. 2251).
The President advocated a four-year extension of
the Housing Act of 1949. The junior senator voted
against the President. (100 Cong. Rec. 11883).
The President urged a three-year extension of the
reciprocal trade program. The junior senator voted
against the President. (100 Cong. Rec. 8408).
The President counseled against reducing excise
taxes because of the detrimental effect such a move

would have on his attempts to balance the budget.
The junior senator voted against the President. (100
Cong. Rec. 3830).
When asked how he .will vote on the McCarthy
censure resolution, the junior senator refused to state
his position. (Personal interview with the writer,
10-11-54).
Over and over and over the junior senator has said
he is no rubber stamp. This is certainly true so far
as support of the President goes! But the junior sen
ator is a rubber stamp for the senior senator from
California, Mr. Knowlandâ€”their voting records in
the just-concluded session of Congress differ in no
material respect.
If we are to support our President in fashioning a
strong and wise domestic and foreign policy, in the !
expansion of freedom and prosperity and the maint- !
enance of peace, we hav.e no choice but to elect Sam i
Yorty to the Senate and send the junior senator back j
to Anaheim.
