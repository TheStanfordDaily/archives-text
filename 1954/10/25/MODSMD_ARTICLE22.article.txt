; laurel tie for the occasion and was
' responsible for having them made.

The gold spike which Leland
Stanford drove into a laurel tie
in 1869 to complete the first
! transcontinental railroad is be
ing returned to the Stanford
University Museum.
For 27 years the historic shaft of
gold has been kept for the Univer
sity by the Wells Fargo Bunk in San
Francisco, where it has been shown
in the bank's History Room.
The spike's special display safe,
with a heavily reinforced glass win
dow and lighted interior, has been
presented to Stanford by Welh? Far
go. it is now being installed in the
Stanford Museum, which was re
cently reopened after a long period
of dormancy.
The spike will have a preview
showing at the Chrysanthemum Tea,
annual benefit of the Stanford Moth
ers' Club, Nov. 9, and will be on
public view thereafter.
THE CEREMONY
It was May 10, 1809, when Sena-
I tor Stanford tapped the i;old spike
j into place at a ceremonious joining
lof the Central Pacific and Union
j Pacific rails at Promontory, Utah.
After the celebration the spike
was withdrawn and was presented
-by Senator Stanford to David
| Hewes, Sacramento and San Fran
j cisco financier. Hewes had origi
nated the idea of a gold spike and
; laurel tie for the occasion and was
' responsible for having them made.
Hewes presented the gold spike to
the Stanford Museum in 1892, short
j ly after the opening of the Univer
j sity founded by Senator and Mrs.
Stanford. In 1927 it was transferred
to the Wells Fargo Bank for safe
keeping.
The Stanford Museum, after a
complete remodeling, was reopened
last May.
HAMMER DENTS SEEN
Resembling an ordinary railroad
spike in size and design, the cere
monial spike contains about $350 in
gold. Clearly visible on its head are
the dents made by Senator Stanford
when he tapped it in with a silver
hammer.
Also on the head are the engraved
words, "The Last Spike." Engraved
on two sides are the names of offi
cers and directors of the Central Pa
cific.
The third side is inscribed "The
Central Pacific. Ground broken Jan.
Bth, 1863 —Completed May 10, 1869."
On the fourth side is the sentiment,
"May God continue the unity of our
country as this railroad unites the
two great oceans of the world."
