# 'Vanishing Prairie' One of Disney's Best
## 
### First Nighter 
"Vanishing Prairie," now showing at the Stanford Theater, has
no triple axe murder, leggy chorus girls, or love triangle. As a
matter of fact, not a single human being wanders across the cellu
loid during the entire two hours. However, this doesn't prevent
Walt Disney's second full length "True-Life" film from being one
of the best productions ol' the year.*

The new Disney film is the second
full-length movie in history to be
human being-less, "Living Desert"
being the first. Five of the eight
previous "True-Life" pictures have
garnered Oscars, and this ninth ap-

pears to be more
of a shoo-in than
Frank Lloyd
Wright'in an ar
chitecture class.
Eleven camera
men spent two
years filming
"Vanishing Prai
rie," a flick which j
•shows what ani-

mal life was like on the Great Plains
of America before civilization en
croached on nature.
"Vanishing Prairie," though show
ing many electrifying clashes be
tween animal dwellers of the Great
Plains, lacks the dazzling ferocity of
"Living Desert." However, its great
charm is that it gives the movie-goer
a swelling feeling of the elegance
and symmetry of nature unspoiled
by man.
If there is a villain in this picture,
it is not the rattler who attacks the
prairie dog, the mountain lion who
stalks the fawn, or the cunning wea
sel who ferrets out smaller rodents
of the Great Plain. No, the villain
never actually appears on the
screen, for it is Man.
It is as if Man were standing at
the edge of the screen, about to dis-,,
rupt the tranquillity of life on the
prairie; about to demolish the vast
herds of regal buffalo; and about to
build his ugly, stilted houses where
previously heroic scegery aiul -ani-
mal. life held sw&y.

"Vanishing Prairie" has all the un
usual photography that marks the
other Disney "True - Life" adven
tures. Some of the more memorable
scenes are:
1. The birth and first steps of a
buffalo.
2. The wanderings of a buffalo
herd, filmed by a photographer who
hid under a buffalo pelt.
3. The communal life of the prai
rie dogs, showing amazing under
ground shots of how these animated
rodents escape weasels, rattlers, and
badgers in their maze of tunnels,
4. Food-hunting by two of the
great villains of the Great Plain . . .
the mountain lion and the coyote.
One of the distinguishing features
of the picture is the background mu
sic. When the male Bighorn sheep
butt their metallic-sounding horns,
the anvil chorus is played in the
background. When ducks land on
the ice and skid for 20 feet, the
"Skaters' Waltz" is played. It's the
music that gives the stars of the film
a kind of Mickey Mouse animation.
"The Vanishing Prairie" is another
sure-fire Oscar winner for the gen
ius Disney and is about as worth
missing as the Big Game.

of America before civilization en
croached on nature.
"Vanishing Prairie," though show
ing many electrifying clashes be
tween animal dwellers of the Great
Plains, lacks the dazzling ferocity of
"Living Desert." However, its great
charm is that it gives the movie-goer
a swelling feeling of the elegance
and symmetry of nature unspoiled
by man.
If there is a villain in this picture,
it is not the rattler who attacks the
prairie dog, the mountain lion who
stalks the fawn, or the cunning wea
sel who ferrets out smaller rodents
of the Great Plain. No, the villain
never actually appears on the
screen, for it is Man.
It is as if Man were standing at
the edge of the screen, about to dis-,,
rupt the tranquillity of life on the
prairie; about to demolish the vast
herds of regal buffalo; and about to
build his ugly, stilted houses where
previously heroic scegery aiul -ani-
mal. life held sw&y.

"Vanishing Prairie" has all the un
usual photography that marks the
other Disney "True - Life" adven
tures. Some of the more memorable
scenes are:
1. The birth and first steps of a
buffalo.
2. The wanderings of a buffalo
herd, filmed by a photographer who
hid under a buffalo pelt.
3. The communal life of the prai
rie dogs, showing amazing under
ground shots of how these animated
rodents escape weasels, rattlers, and
badgers in their maze of tunnels,
4. Food-hunting by two of the
great villains of the Great Plain . . .
the mountain lion and the coyote.
One of the distinguishing features
of the picture is the background mu
sic. When the male Bighorn sheep
butt their metallic-sounding horns,
the anvil chorus is played in the
background. When ducks land on
the ice and skid for 20 feet, the
"Skaters' Waltz" is played. It's the
music that gives the stars of the film
a kind of Mickey Mouse animation.
"The Vanishing Prairie" is another
sure-fire Oscar winner for the gen
ius Disney and is about as worth
missing as the Big Game.

"Vanishing Prairie," now showing at the Stanford Theater, has
no triple axe murder, leggy chorus girls, or love triangle. As a
matter of fact, not a single human being wanders across the cellu
loid during the entire two hours. However, this doesn't prevent
Walt Disney's second full length "True-Life" film from being one
of the best productions ol' the year.*

The new Disney film is the second
full-length movie in history to be
human being-less, "Living Desert"
being the first. Five of the eight
previous "True-Life" pictures have
garnered Oscars, and this ninth ap-

pears to be more
of a shoo-in than
Frank Lloyd
Wright'in an ar
chitecture class.
