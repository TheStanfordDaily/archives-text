### BILL NICHOLS 
Husky coach John Cherberg seemed not at all depressed fol
lowing Stanford's 13-7 win over his team. He said his team put
forth one of their better efforts of the year considering all the re
cent manpower losses that hit the squad.
Cherberg said that the loss of Fred Robinson, regular right

tackle, "was like losing your heavy
artillery just when you needed it
most." The big 235-pound junior,
who was declared ineligible Satur
day morning because of a scholastic
deficiency, was conisdered by Cher
berg t.o be the anchorman of the
Purple and Gold line. Robbie was
the third of Washington's first four
tackles to be declared ineligible in
the last two weeks.
"We were beaten by two boys
from the Northwest, and that hurts."
The brown-suited mentor was refer
ring to Bill Tarr of Bellingham,
W; shington, and Jerry Gustafson of
Astoria. Oregon, who scored the two
Cardinal touchdowns.
'"We knew Stanford wasn't as poor
as it showed against UCLA, but our
injuries, especially to Stu Crook,
and that fumble of ours recovered in
the end zone by Stanford cost us the
game." Cherberg said that the offi
cials undoubtedly were right on
their ruling that gave the Indians

the ball on the 20 after Bob Dunn
fumbled as he hit the center of the
line from the one-yard mark.
Dunn, himself, said that the first
official signaled a Husky TD; the
second ruled that Dunn was stop
ped on the one-inch line and it
was still Washington's ball. While
these two were arguing, a third
ran in and gave the ball to Stan
ford on the 20. Dunn thought he
lost the ball after he crossed the
goal, but he couldn't be sure, he
said, because of the huge pileup of
players.
Cherberg refused to name any
body who looked good for Stan
ford, stating diplomatically that they
all played well. He disagreed with
Taylor about his soph quarterback.
Bob Cox. Cox. Cherberg felt, filled
in'admirably for the injured Sandy
Lederman.
