LOS ANGELES, Oct. 24 (UP)
Los Angeles basin residents today
hailed their first real relief from
eye - stinging fog that blanketed
the area for 18 clays, but there was
no letup in the smoke and fury of
debate over what to do about the
acrid fumes.
A light curtain of smog greeted
the sun in some downtown area.s but
by noon breezes had swept the skies
fairly clean.
Governor Goodwin J. Knight took
note of the break in the smog seigc
with the statement it "should not be
the cause for complacency."
At the same time, he renewed his
request that the oil industry shut
down its refineries here for a "test
period" to determine the "extent of
the industry's responsibility in this
very -serious problem." The industry
rejected his request last Friday and
Knight said at the time he had no
legal authority to force their clos
ing.
