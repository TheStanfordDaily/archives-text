# $5.5 MILLION
## Gifts to Farm Hit New High 
### DICK MANSFIELD Associate Editor, The Daily 
Five and one-half million dollars in gifts—the highest yearly gift
total in the history of the University—was turned over to Stanford
in 1953 54, President Wallace Sterling announced yesterday.
About three-fifths of the gifts were given for current use—i.e.,
to apply to current University expenses and the balance was

given as gifts to endowment. The
University's endowment now stands
at approximately $47,000,000.
Individual gifts from Sept. 1, J953,
to Aug. 31, 1954. numbered 12,299
and totaled $5,408,948. This is an
increase over the previous all-time
high, set last year, of $1,400,000.
Stanford's General Secretary Da
vid S. JaeObson, whose office works
with alumni volunteer committees in
soliciting and processing gifts to the
University, cites growing awareness
of the importance of strengthening
higher education and greatly ex
panded alumni-volunteer activity as
responsible for the increased sup
port.
UNRESTRICTED TOTALS
But Jacobson adds that this year's
record figure "still leaves esomething
to be desired when you look at the
unrestricted totals." Of the $3,151,-
809 given for current use, only $201,-
972 was given unrestricted. All other
current use funds arc earmarked for
use in specific projects and fields.
JacObson points out that unre
stricted funds can be used by the
University to cover most important
items of expense, whereas ear
marked funds are often given in
fields where they arc less needed.
Gifts to endowment were $2,257,-
139. At its inception in 1891 the
most richly endowed university
in America, Stanford now ranks
twelfth. Harvard has the largest en
dowment of American colleges, with
over $200,000,000.
Stanford's overall gift program
has grown rapidly since its incep
tion in 1936. At that time, gift pro
grams at Harvard and Yale netted
10 to 15 times as much as Stanford's.
Now the gift programs at Harvard
and Yale net two to three times as
much as Stanford's.
CHIEF DONORS
Largest source of gift money, in
terms iboth of gifts and amounts
given, was the group of living indi
viduals, who gave 11,644 gifts to
taling $2,190,042. Foundations gave
$1,704,592 in 167 gifts.
Gifts from business and industry
totaled $405,964. The University is
currently attempting to encourage
gifts from this source, having re
cently published a booklet explain
ing the role of business and industry
in supporting private education.
Bequests numbered 36 and totaled
$624,151. Associations presented
$132,944 in 130 gifts. Other sources
accounted for $351,255 in 59 gifts.
Gifts, Jaeobson noted, come from

all over the world. Not over $1500,000
of the 1953-54 gift total came from
Santa Clara County. One alumna in
Australia, unable to send American
dollars out of the country for her
gift, sent a Bookstore rebate check
instead.
The two largest single gifts were
$500,000 each, one anonymous and
the other from the Rockefeller
Foundation.,
EARMARKED FUNDS
Earmarked funds include $1,161,-
986 for research projects, half of it
for the School of Medicine; $485,811
for scholarships, fellowships, and
various forms of student aid; and
$749,595 for buildings and equipment.
Annual giving programs netted
$488,775 for the University through
six funds: Engineering Fund, Law
School Fund, Medical Alumni Fund,
Parents Committee, University Fund,
and Special Appeals. The Parents
Committee, soliciting gifts from par
during the 1953-54 year and netted
ents of Stanford students, was begun
$45,881. A fund to be collected
among alumni of the Business School
is currently being formed.
