Plans for Stanford's Homecoming
Weekend were well past the initial
stages, planners announced yester
day, with a total of 2G entries in one
of the weekend's main events, the
float parade.
Though entries for the float parade
will be held open until tomorrow,
chairman Art Stauffer said, most of
the entries have come in, since early
entries guaranteed a choice of themes
for the different fiats; also, under
the new "collective buying" system
set up this year, orders for float
materials were made up yesterday.
Stauffer said that the order will be
held up until 11 a.m. today to give
late entries a chance at the 40 per
cent discount.
