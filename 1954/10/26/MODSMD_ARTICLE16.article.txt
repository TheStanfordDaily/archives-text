### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 (IJP) —
President Eisenhower called tonight
for a vast expansion in the U.S.
economy that would equal $3,000
more per family in 1964 and banish
fears of unemployment and depres
sion.
In a radio-television address just
a week before the Congressional
election, the President said it is
"high time" to lay aside dread of war,
unemployment, and the future to
boost the U.S. annual output to half
a trillion dollars by 1964.
He said he thinks this enormous
expansion—4o per cent above pres
ent annual production—is possible if
the nation opens its "treasure house '
of brains and energy.
lie also offered his own general
economic philosophy as a prescrip
tion for .prosperity to help achieve
the new goal. This included an ex
panded foreign economic program,
continued cuts in federal spending,
more highways, schools, housing,
and social security, continued farm
improvement, and peaceful use of
the atom.
