LONDON. Oct. 25 (UP) Ameri
j can:, in Warsaw ;uid along Llic Iron
Curtain kept a sharp lookout, tonight
for Hermann Field, U.S. architect
who Communist Poland said had
heen freed after five years in prison
on trumped-up spy charges.
The U.S. embassy in Warsaw re
ported by telephone that it expected
Field ill any time, but had heard
nothing of him since the skimpy
Polish statement nearly 24 hours
earlier.
The sudden Polish action prompt
ed speculation that, the Communists
also might release other members of
the Field family, whose disappear
ance in Eastern Europe was one of
the greatest post-war mysteries.
