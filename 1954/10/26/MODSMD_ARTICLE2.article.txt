# Smog Study Is Speeded

### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 25 (UP) â€”
Governor Goodwin J. Knight, in a
statement released from his Los An
geles office, last night threw all of
the state's technical resources into
research for a practical and inex
pensive dcvice to control smog-pro
ducing exhaust from automobiles.
The Governor's statement came as
the Los Angeles area went through
its second day of relatively smog
free conditions, with a slight breeze
blowing away most fumes and eye
smarting irritants. The relief came
after 18 days of smog that had the
area on the verge of an emergency
situation.
As president of the University of
California Board of Regents, Knight
asked the university to give priority
to the testing of anti-smog vehicle
exhause devices, making money
available from the Governor's emer
gency fund.
At the same time, he announced
the university was stepping up work
on other smog control projects in
cluding improvements in air condi
tioning equipment, means of predict
ing smog conditions, and improve
ment of combustion in incinerators.
Knight revealed the university's
expanded role in the smog control
picture after conferring with Presi
dent Robert G. Sproul and other
university officials.
Action by the university, he said,
should go hand in hand with a test
shutdown of oil refineries in the Los
Angeles area which the Governor
requested last Friday and was
turned down by five major oil com
panies.
