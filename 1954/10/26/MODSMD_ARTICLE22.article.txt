# NATION SEES CABINET MEETING
## Dulles Gives Paris Report 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 (UP) —Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles said last night at a televised cabinet meeting that the his
toric agreements on German rearmament eventually may form the
basis for new peace talks with Russia.
The eKtraordinary cabinet meeting was called by President

Eisenhower to dramatize the accord
reached at the recent Paris confer
ence for bringing West Germany
back into the family of nations.
With Mr. Eisenhower and nine
other department heads seated
around a table in the green-carpeted
cabinet room, Dulles traced the his
tory of the free world's efforts to
form a united front against Commu
nism.
Television cameras and radio mi
crophones carried his report to a na
tionwide audience, marking the first
time that a business session of the
cabinet had been broadcast.
Speaking from notes and waving
a pencil for emphasis, Dulles con -
ceded that Russia "won't like" the
Paris agreements and will, try every
"trick or device" to destroy Euro
pean unity.
But, he said, "when we create, as
we hope we will, a position of so
lidity and strength for Wes't. Europe,
then there may be a new basis for
discussion that doesn't exist at the
present time."
"At least we can hope that there
can be talks more satisfactory than
these that exist when the only ob
ject of the Soviet Union is by trick
or device to try and break up Euro
pean unity," he said.
As for Russian objections, he said
the plan for controlled rearmament
of West Germany will "protect Rus
sia as much as anybody else" against
a resurgence of German militarsm.
During the discourse, Mr. Eisen
hower, who said Dulles deserved "a
standing ovation," nodded and
smiled in agreement. On three or •
casions, members of the cabinet in
terrupted to question Duiles about
certain points.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Eisenhower
had taken another unusual step by
going to the airport to give his globe
trotting Secretary of State a per
sonal "welcome back."
The President decided late Sunday
to assemble the cabinet to head Dul
les' report. Then it was decided to
day to let the public "sit in" through
the medium of radio and television.
Mr. Eisenhower and several of his
cabinet members held a televised
"roundtable" at the White House
some months ago. But this was the
first business meeting of the cabinet
to be televised.

But, he said, "when we create, as
we hope we will, a position of so
lidity and strength for Wes't. Europe,
then there may be a new basis for
discussion that doesn't exist at the
present time."
"At least we can hope that there
can be talks more satisfactory than
these that exist when the only ob
ject of the Soviet Union is by trick
or device to try and break up Euro
pean unity," he said.
As for Russian objections, he said
the plan for controlled rearmament
of West Germany will "protect Rus
sia as much as anybody else" against
a resurgence of German militarsm.
During the discourse, Mr. Eisen
hower, who said Dulles deserved "a
standing ovation," nodded and
smiled in agreement. On three or •
casions, members of the cabinet in
terrupted to question Duiles about
certain points.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Eisenhower
had taken another unusual step by
going to the airport to give his globe
trotting Secretary of State a per
sonal "welcome back."
The President decided late Sunday
to assemble the cabinet to head Dul
les' report. Then it was decided to
day to let the public "sit in" through
the medium of radio and television.
Mr. Eisenhower and several of his
cabinet members held a televised
"roundtable" at the White House
some months ago. But this was the
first business meeting of the cabinet
to be televised.

Dulles said last night at a televised cabinet meeting that the his
toric agreements on German rearmament eventually may form the
basis for new peace talks with Russia.
The eKtraordinary cabinet meeting was called by President

Eisenhower to dramatize the accord
reached at the recent Paris confer
ence for bringing West Germany
back into the family of nations.
With Mr. Eisenhower and nine
other department heads seated
around a table in the green-carpeted
cabinet room, Dulles traced the his
tory of the free world's efforts to
form a united front against Commu
nism.
Television cameras and radio mi
crophones carried his report to a na
tionwide audience, marking the first
time that a business session of the
cabinet had been broadcast.
Speaking from notes and waving
a pencil for emphasis, Dulles con -
ceded that Russia "won't like" the
Paris agreements and will, try every
"trick or device" to destroy Euro
pean unity.
