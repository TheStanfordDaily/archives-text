## "Something's Wrong. Last Time HE Was Running Scared" We've Heard Enough 
### 
Closely contested political campaigns al
most inevitably develop into mud-slinging,
name-calling slugfests between the principals.
With each sweep of the second hand the temp
tation is greater to hint at shady records, fabri
cate scandals, and dig for irrelevant issues
with which to discredit the opposition.
Such has been the unfortunate trend as the
fall 1954 Congressional campaign steams into
its last full week. And of 2(11 the trumped-up
charges and wild insinuations being hurled
across the nation, none have been more re
prehensible or far-fetched than the words of
Vice-President Richard Nixon.
Mr. Nixon has taken the Republican slogan
of "Korea, corruption, and Communism" to
heart with special emphasis on the word
"Communism."
He has apparently learned what Joseph R.
McCarthy has known for a long time: Equate
the Communist party with the Democratic party
long enough and loud enough and you're
bound to win a few votes.
Mr. Nixon's latest remarks, released by the
Republican National Committee in Washing
ton, claim that the Communist party is fighting
desperately for the election' of an anti-Eisen
hower Congress because many Democratic
candidates belong to a "left-wing clique" which
has "tolerated" the Red conspiracy.
"If a Congress of Stevenson's choosing is
elected,'-' 'he continues, "the security risks
which have all been fired by the Eisenhower
administration will all be hired back."
Furthermore, he proclaims, the Truman ad
ministration "covered up and cleared the Com

munists and the security risks" while the Ei
senhower program has "cleaned up and fired
them."
We have heard enough of this slanderous
nonsense.
We would remind Mr. Nixon that it was Pres
ident Truman who initiated stringent security
regulations in 1947. These were not designed
to promote the overthrow of the United States
government. And is Mr. Niicon's memory so
short he can't remember his own role as a mem-
I
ber of the Senate Committee on Investigations
under President Truman?
Further, we would point out that the Marshall
Plan, NATO, Brussels Pact, Point Four Pro
gram, and Berlin airlift were notable acomplish
ments of the Truman-Acheson administration.
These programs v&ere designed specifically to
meet and overcome the Communist threat
abroad.
As for Korea- where has the world seen a
greater example of united action to stop Com
munist invasion?
We would suggest that Mr. Nixon find some
thing else to campaign about. There are issues
available — foreign policy, taxes, unemploy
ment, farm policy, the return of public property
to private ownership.
Until Mr. Nixon stops trying to dupe the
American public into believing that one of our
two great political parties stands for treason
and tragedy, our respect for the Republican
leadership is slight.
Our respect for Mr. Nixon as the Vice-Presi
dent of the United States is already done.

Our respect for Mr. Nixon as the Vice-Presi
dent of the United States is already done.
- P. K.

Closely contested political campaigns al
most inevitably develop into mud-slinging,
name-calling slugfests between the principals.
With each sweep of the second hand the temp
tation is greater to hint at shady records, fabri
cate scandals, and dig for irrelevant issues
with which to discredit the opposition.
Such has been the unfortunate trend as the
fall 1954 Congressional campaign steams into
its last full week. And of 2(11 the trumped-up
charges and wild insinuations being hurled
across the nation, none have been more re
prehensible or far-fetched than the words of
Vice-President Richard Nixon.
Mr. Nixon has taken the Republican slogan
of "Korea, corruption, and Communism" to
heart with special emphasis on the word
"Communism."
He has apparently learned what Joseph R.
McCarthy has known for a long time: Equate
the Communist party with the Democratic party
long enough and loud enough and you're
bound to win a few votes.
Mr. Nixon's latest remarks, released by the
Republican National Committee in Washing
ton, claim that the Communist party is fighting
desperately for the election' of an anti-Eisen
hower Congress because many Democratic
candidates belong to a "left-wing clique" which
has "tolerated" the Red conspiracy.
"If a Congress of Stevenson's choosing is
elected,'-' 'he continues, "the security risks
which have all been fired by the Eisenhower
administration will all be hired back."
Furthermore, he proclaims, the Truman ad
ministration "covered up and cleared the Com

munists and the security risks" while the Ei
senhower program has "cleaned up and fired
them."
We have heard enough of this slanderous
nonsense.
We would remind Mr. Nixon that it was Pres
ident Truman who initiated stringent security
regulations in 1947. These were not designed
to promote the overthrow of the United States
government. And is Mr. Niicon's memory so
short he can't remember his own role as a mem-
I
ber of the Senate Committee on Investigations
under President Truman?
Further, we would point out that the Marshall
Plan, NATO, Brussels Pact, Point Four Pro
gram, and Berlin airlift were notable acomplish
ments of the Truman-Acheson administration.
These programs v&ere designed specifically to
meet and overcome the Communist threat
abroad.
As for Korea- where has the world seen a
greater example of united action to stop Com
munist invasion?
We would suggest that Mr. Nixon find some
thing else to campaign about. There are issues
available — foreign policy, taxes, unemploy
ment, farm policy, the return of public property
to private ownership.
Until Mr. Nixon stops trying to dupe the
American public into believing that one of our
two great political parties stands for treason
and tragedy, our respect for the Republican
leadership is slight.
Our respect for Mr. Nixon as the Vice-Presi
dent of the United States is already done.
