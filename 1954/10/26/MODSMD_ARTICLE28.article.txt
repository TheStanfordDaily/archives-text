# The 						Dixon-Yates Story: Campaign Sound and Fury
## 
### RUTH WATERS

"Why all the fuss? Just what is the Dixon-Yates contract?" Could you answer those questions
without research? We couldn't, so we lied to the New Yoik Times files for help. As a result, we
will try to clarify what has become a violently argued campaign issue.
It started last February, when the Tennessee Valley Authority found that the 600,000 kilowatts
of energy which they were supplying to the Paducah, Ky., plant of the Atomic Energy Commis
sion was straining their facilities. The solution was either for TVA to build itself another steam
plant to supply the AEC, or for AEC to employ a private utility company to do the job.

At that point, the administration*
decided that they needed time to
study TVA and decide whether the
nation would benefit most from fur
ther expansion of TVA bv conversion
of fringe developments to private
ownership. The immediate problem
of power for AEC had to be solved,
however, so the administration di
rected the AEC to go ahead and ne
gotiate with private business while
they studied the whole problem.
Two months later, April 24 to be
precise, President Eisenhower first
learned that the Middle South Utili
ties, Inc., and Southern Company,
represented by Edgar H. Dixon and
Eugene A. Yates, president and
chairman respectively, were the pri
vate parties negotiating with AEC.
BOARD SPLIT
It was not until spring that the
administration learned another fact
—the AEC board of commissioners
was split, three against and two for,
on giving the contract to a private
business.
According to the chronological
record of the Bureau of the Budget,
released and published in the New
York Times Aug. 22, a propositi was
presented to the AEC by Walter Von
Tresckow on April 28 to contract for
the steam plant. Von Tresckow is a
New York financial consultant whose
organization evidently includes con
struction and utilities firms.
The AEC suspended negotiations
with Dixon-Yates while Republican
leaders of Congress and the Presi
dent considered their proposal, the
Von Tresckow proposal, and an esti
mate of the cost of TVA constructing
and operating the plant itself. The
Von Tresckow proposal was found
unacceptable in a June 14 announce
ment for three reasons:
1. The government would be re
quired to pay all costs and take all
risks, while paying the contractor a
fixed fee of $4,000,000.
2. There was no assurance of the
contractor's proved ability and ex
perience.
3. The estimated cost was about
the same or possibly greater than
the Dixon-Yates proposal.
By June 30, the President issued
a directive approving the proposed
contract between AEC and the Dix
on-Yates group for a steam plant at
West Memphis, Ark., costing an esti
mated $107,205,000.
OPPOSITION
Opposition to the proposed con
tract came first from Senator Lan
ger, Republican from North Dakota.
He asserted that it might be detri
mental to the public interest. Langer
is chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee and of the subcommittee
in charge of investigating monopoly
practices. In August he attempted to
finance a committee to investigate
the issue with his private funds.
Stephen A. Mitchell, national
Democratic party chairman, has led
the Democratic attack on the Dixon-
Yates contract. He has consistently
charged that the administration is
negotiating for a contract without
having opened it to competitive bid
ding. He ylso -challenges the deci
sion against the Von Tresckow pro
■posal and says it would have -saved
the government a million or so -dol
lars. <1 -4. : . S it m -» ' KV •+* .
The proposed Dixon-Yates con
tract was hotly debated in Congress,
and July 22 the Senate upheld Ei
senhower's directive to the AEC to
continue negotiations with Dixon-
Yates by a roll-call vote of 5(5-35.
The vote was mostly Republicans for
and Democrats against, but two Re
publicans* and 11 Democrats crossed
party lines.
By August President Eisenhower
found it .advisable to open the rec
ords to public scrutiny. Since then,
the news has been primarily of
changes in the proposed contract
which is still ibeing negotiated. It is
scheduled for signing Nov. 4.
Conclusions? We can't say hon
estly that either side's arguments are
flawless. All we can suggest is that
some of the facts are known, and we
hope judgments will be drawn from
these facts, not campaign speeches.
