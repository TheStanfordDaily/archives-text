# Berlin University Rector Discusses Student Life
## 
### DAVE SCOTT 
Ihe problems of exchange students and a view oi student uni
versity life in Germany were both topics of a discussion led by
Dr. Ernest Hirsch, Rector of the Free University of Berlin, in the
lower lounge of the Women's Clubhouse yesterday afternoon.
Dr. Hirsch, with Dr. Helmut R. Boeninger of the German Depart-

ment interpreting, explained that he +
was spending two days at Stanford
investigating the exchange problem
in regard to both students and fac
ulty, and the possibility of setting up
a permanent exchange program be
tween Stanford and Berlin. "As far
as Berlin is concerned," summed up
Hirsch, "we are willing to receive
a Stanford student each and every
year."
Berlin, according to Hirsch, has
103 foreign students, about 20 per I
cent of them being from the United .
States. All the students live in an
International House, rather than in
a fraternity as they do in Stanford.
Berlin does have fraternities, how
ever, which. Hirsch heartily supports.
The old-fashioned dueling fraterni
ties, politically predominant in the
university between the two world
wars, have been abolished.
' Before joining the university, the j
student must sign a pledge declaring
that he is not then nor ever will be
a member of a dueling fraternity. At
present a case is before a West Ger
man court of a student saying it was
unconstitutional for the university to
require this pledge to be signed.
The Free University of Berlin was j
founded in 1948 as the old univer- !
sity wont under the control of the |
Communists in East Berlin. The j
university has about 7,000 students; I
about 30 per cent of them are relugee !
students from East Berlin.
Stanford has been affiliated with
the Free University of Berlin for
several years. The Berlin Affiliation
Committee of the Institute of Inter
national Relations administers the
program, which has included hook
collections and fund drives.
