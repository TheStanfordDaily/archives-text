the squad prepared lor next Satur
day's game with the WSC Cougars.
Dick Jones suffered a hip pointer
last week and will miss the tilt, but
aside from him and Steve Docter,
who is still out of action, the injury
situation is good. For the Braves,
however, first-string halfback Jerry
Angove's knee went out in the Hum
boldt game, arid lie is out for the
season.
Taylor said the Cards would have
to play much better against WSC
than they had against the Huskies
if they wanted to win. He said that
technically the Indians were poor
lasL week. "We played a team hit
hard by injuries and ineligibilities
and still only managed to win by
13-7," he added.
The first three strings went
through a short drill stressing block
ing before retiring to hear the scout
ing report on the Cougars, who were
