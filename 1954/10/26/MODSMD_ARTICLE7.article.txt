# El Camino to Be Expanded To Six Lanes
## 
### 
The State Highway Commission
will expand El Camino Real to six
lanes from University Avenue un
derpass to San Francisquito Creek
in the near future it was revealed
yesterday.
In its budget report, which in
cludes the fiscal year starting July 1,
1955, the Commission allocated $240,-
000 for the project.
The section to be expanded runs
right in front of the Stanford re
gional shopping center, but it is not
being improved in conjunction with
this program. The Highway Depart
ment has been planning to expand
the area for some time and decided
to take positive action with the es
tablishment of the shopping center.
A stop light will be installed at the
entrance to the shopping center.
In order to increase the road from
four to six lanes some of the Stan
ford land will be condemned, all of
which means the Highway Depart
ment wil buy it. Using this method
they can get around the legal techni
cality that no Stanford land can be
sold.
Part of the land to be used cuts
into the right field of the Palo Alto
ball park, which is the home of the
Palo Alto Oaks. The Oaks will still
be ajble.to use the field.
The City of Palo Alto leased the
land under question for 99 years
from the University.
