UNITED NATIONS, New York,
Oct. 25 (UP) —Andrei Y. Vishinsky
told the United Nations today that
Russia will not permit aerial inspec
tion of its territory under a dis
armament plan. The Western Allies
hold that provision vitally necessary
to any inspection system.
The Soviet chief delegate, in a
two hour and 40 minutes harangue
in the U.N. Political Committee, also
stuck grimly to his demand for a
reduction of armaments by percent
ages, which would give the Soviet
Union military domination in land,
sea, and air forces.
He insisted that the U.N. Security
Council, in which Russia has the
veto, must alone have the power to
deal with final enforcement of a dis
armament plan.
Vishinsky ferociously denounced
the London and Paris agreements
under which Western Germany is to
be rearmed and said they would
increase international tension just
when disarmament Ls under discus
sion.
The aerial inspection proposal was
first made by the United States last
May.
