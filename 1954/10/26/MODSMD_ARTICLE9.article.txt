# Mock UN Security Council Denies Seat to Red China
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
A mock debate of the Security Council of the United Nations
held last night in Cubberley Auditorium determined by a seven
to two decision, with two abstentions, to uphold the United States
resolution to postpone indefinitely the seating of Communist
China.
Participating in this mock debate, presented by the Institute of

International Relations as a part of
the United Nations Week celebration,
were representatives of the 11 Se
curity Council nations: Denmark,
Per Ditlev-Sirnonsen; Brazil, Georg
Rawitscher; China, Jack Ling; Co
lombia, Rob Kline; France, Philippe
Senat; Lebanon, Claudia Mubayyed;
New Zealand, Dave Penny; Turkey,
Erdogan Altan; USSR, Fuad Quin
tal-; United Kingdom, Tom Maxwell;
and United States, Virginia Patter
son.
Ditlev-Simonscn, acting as Securi
ty Council President, introduced the
debate and cited the strange prob
lem of the possibility of having two
governments representing China—
one in the Security Council and one
in the General Assembly.
The delegate from the USSR, Fuad
Quintal*, launched the debate by
flatly stating that the present Chinese
delegation has neither the "political,
legal nor moral right to represent
the Chinese nation (in the United
Nations)," and went on to cite an
increasing demand among the na
tions, that Red China be seated.
U.S. HITS BACK
The United States delegate, Vir
ginia Patterson, immediately hit
back with the point that the UN
Charter specifies that membership is
not on a universal, but selective
basis. "Membership," she said, "is
open to all peace-loving nations, but
they must accept the obligations of
the Charter and be able and willing
to carry out these obligations."
FRANCE ABSTAINS
France's delegate, Philippe Senat,
disagreed with both resolutions as
he thought "what is in the past must
stay in the past," and abstained in
the final tabulation.
Delegate from the United King
dom, Tom Maxwell, reminded the
Council that his government long
ago recognized Red China, but
pointed out that "it should be taken
into account the conduct of that na
tion in international affairs and
especially in regard to that organi
zation into which they now seek
membership."
"To admit the Communist dele
gation would be to atone and abet
aggression," Jack Ling, the delegate
from the exiled Chinese government
put forth.
Ditlev-Simonsen, now voicing
Denmark's opinion on the question,
maintained that "the new govern
ment is more in the sentiment of the
people than was the National Chinese
government."
LEBANON ABSTAINS
The Lebanese delegate would not
take a stand, but pointed out that
the United States supported a na
tion which the Lebanese themselves
considered an aggressor—lsrael.
One of the Western bloc nations,
Australia, took stand against the
resolution, believing that there is
now a far greater threat (to world
peace) than if China's voice could
be found between the walls of the
United Nations."
Turkey lined up behind the United
States on the question, and Colombia
voiced the final opinion in favor of
the United States resolution, saying
that "if admitted, the Communist
delegation would immediately by the
subject of expulsion proceedings."

resolution, believing that there is
now a far greater threat (to world
peace) than if China's voice could
be found between the walls of the
United Nations."
Turkey lined up behind the United
States on the question, and Colombia
voiced the final opinion in favor of
the United States resolution, saying
that "if admitted, the Communist
delegation would immediately by the
subject of expulsion proceedings."
A mock debate of the Security Council of the United Nations
held last night in Cubberley Auditorium determined by a seven
to two decision, with two abstentions, to uphold the United States
resolution to postpone indefinitely the seating of Communist
China.
Participating in this mock debate, presented by the Institute of

International Relations as a part of
the United Nations Week celebration,
were representatives of the 11 Se
curity Council nations: Denmark,
Per Ditlev-Sirnonsen; Brazil, Georg
Rawitscher; China, Jack Ling; Co
lombia, Rob Kline; France, Philippe
Senat; Lebanon, Claudia Mubayyed;
New Zealand, Dave Penny; Turkey,
Erdogan Altan; USSR, Fuad Quin
tal-; United Kingdom, Tom Maxwell;
and United States, Virginia Patter
son.
Ditlev-Simonscn, acting as Securi
ty Council President, introduced the
debate and cited the strange prob
lem of the possibility of having two
governments representing China—
one in the Security Council and one
in the General Assembly.
The delegate from the USSR, Fuad
Quintal*, launched the debate by
flatly stating that the present Chinese
delegation has neither the "political,
legal nor moral right to represent
the Chinese nation (in the United
Nations)," and went on to cite an
increasing demand among the na
tions, that Red China be seated.
U.S. HITS BACK
The United States delegate, Vir
ginia Patterson, immediately hit
back with the point that the UN
Charter specifies that membership is
not on a universal, but selective
basis. "Membership," she said, "is
open to all peace-loving nations, but
they must accept the obligations of
the Charter and be able and willing
to carry out these obligations."
FRANCE ABSTAINS
France's delegate, Philippe Senat,
disagreed with both resolutions as
he thought "what is in the past must
stay in the past," and abstained in
the final tabulation.
Delegate from the United King
dom, Tom Maxwell, reminded the
Council that his government long
ago recognized Red China, but
pointed out that "it should be taken
into account the conduct of that na
tion in international affairs and
especially in regard to that organi
zation into which they now seek
membership."
"To admit the Communist dele
gation would be to atone and abet
aggression," Jack Ling, the delegate
from the exiled Chinese government
put forth.
Ditlev-Simonsen, now voicing
Denmark's opinion on the question,
maintained that "the new govern
ment is more in the sentiment of the
people than was the National Chinese
government."
LEBANON ABSTAINS
The Lebanese delegate would not
take a stand, but pointed out that
the United States supported a na
tion which the Lebanese themselves
considered an aggressor—lsrael.
One of the Western bloc nations,
Australia, took stand against the
resolution, believing that there is
now a far greater threat (to world
peace) than if China's voice could
be found between the walls of the
United Nations."
