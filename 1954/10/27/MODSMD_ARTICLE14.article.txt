# Did Huskies Get 2d TD?
## 
### 
A Seattle sportswriter last night
quoted an unnamed University of
Washington official as saying that
game movies of last Saturday's
Stanford-Washington football game
showed that the Huskies scored an
other touchdown, only to have the
ball "stolen" in a pileup in the end
zone. Stanford won the game, 13
to 7.
The reporter, George Vamell of
the Seattle Times, quoted the official
as saying the ball was pulled from
halfback Bob Dunn's hands by a
Stanford player wearing number 44.
That is Indian halfback Gordy
Young.
Members of the Washington
coaching staff refused to comment
on the disputed play, the story con
tinued. Officials ruled the ball to be
a fumble.
"Last Saturday's game is over and
the records show Stanford won,"
stated Johnny Cherbcrg, Washing
ton coach. '.'We have no complaint
to make and will make none."
When asked to comment on the
story, Stanford Coach Chuck Taylor
told The Daily last night there was
"nothing to comment about." But
members of his staff indicated that
the game movies showed the play
was a fumble and the ball was not
"stolen."
The disputed play occurred late in
the fourth quarter with Stanford
ahead and Washington with first
down and goal to go on the Indians'
one-yard line. Dunn carried the ball
into the left side of the line and he
and the ball disappeared under a
huge pile of players. The next '.liing
fans knew, it was ruled a tor.ehback
and Stanford had possession on its
own 20-yard line.
The dispute is the second in Pa
cific Coast Conference football this
week. Newspaper pictures of the
California-USC game last Saturday
showed that a Trojan touchdown
should have been disallowed be
cause of a holding penalty. Game
officials did not see the infraction
and allowed the score as USC won,
29-27.
