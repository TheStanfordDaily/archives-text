## Churchill Backs Up U.S.; Rejects Big Four Meet 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 26 (UP) —Prime Minister Winston Churchill
aligned Britain solidly with the United States today in rejecting
a Soviet invitation to a Big Four conference before the new Eu
ropean defense agreements have been ratified.
Russia, in a bid to prevent ratification of the new agreements

rearming a free West Germany, pr o
posed a new meeting with the United
States, France, and Britain in notes
Saturday a few hours before the
agreements were signed in Paris.
ANSWER TO LABOR PARTY
Churchill's statement came in an
swer to left-wing Labor party ques
tions in Commons asking "in what
form he has conveyed to authorities
in the Soviet Union his expression
of willingness" last week to meet So
viet Premier Georgi Malenkov at the
right time and place.
Left-wing faction leader Ancurin
Bcvan then reminded him of the
Soviet four - power invitation.
Churchill said any personal meeting
with Malenkov would be separate
and indicated such a meeting still
would have to be discussed with
Britain's allies.
CHURCHILL'S STATEMENTS
' Whether there would be a four
power conference including the So
viet is a matter which must be dis
cussed by the governments con
cerned and the exact relation of such
a very important meeting to any
personal contacts I might have an
opportunity of making with Mr. Ma
lenkov — that personal intervention
ought not in any way to affect the
general decisions of the main is
sues," Churchill said.
"At this particular stage when the
agreements reached in Western Eu
rope have still to be ratified, I do
not think the moment has been
reached for a four-power confer
ence."
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles took the same stand that the
agreements must be ratified first.
French Premier Pierre Mcndes-
Francc was expected to adopt the
same attitude.
