## The 						Record of the 83rd Congress 
### 
With Congressional elections less than a
week away, Democrats and. Republicans are
pulling out all the stops to either "get in" or
"stay in." The dark handwriting is supposedly
on the wall for the Administration team.
Polls indicate that the Democrats will grab
power by as many as six seats in the Senate
and by a possible 50 in the House. History re
veals that only twice since the Civil War has
a party in power gained additional strength in
an off-year election.
Republicans faced with a dilemma have at
tempted to catch on to President Eisenhower's
coattails and make the election a vote of confi
dence in his administration. Eisenhower has
gathered the sheep into his fold in asking the
voters for a Republican Congress.
But, the President, who retains dignity wheth
er it be swinging a golf club to chop strokes
off his game or wielding a pen to enact a bill
into law, wanted to maintain his activity on
a high plane and not make the election a con
fidence vote.
Although he thought it would be out of char
acter to entertain a full scale stumping cam
paign, he has made several speeches and posed
for pictures with his adherents. He has made
no bones about the fact that "Ike needs more
Democrats" out of Congress. And so Republi
cans are staking their Congressional life on the
83rd Congress. ,
How good is the 83rd's record? Since neither
the Democrats nor the right-wing Republicans
had programs of their own, the question must
be answered in terms of Mr. Eisenhower's
legislative program. Much has been enacted,
much has not. The House, with a larger Re
publican majority, was more co-operative than
the Senate.
The working result was a reversed drift to
welfare-ntatism and positive proof that the 03rd

was far more productive than the Democratic
controlled 81st and 82nd.
Wha«t has been passed?
The St. Lawrence Seaway which was 30
years in the making; tax revision which is ex
pected to cut next year's anticipated revenues
by $1.36 billion; excise taxes, which saw many
20 per cent taxes halved; the Air Force Acad
emy was approved; $1.93 billion went in
grants-in-aid to states for highway improve
ment; the Commodity Credit Corporation was
given increased borrowing authority to the ex
tent of 51.75 bilhon.
The Korean Defense Pact was ratified; hos
pitals got a boost when a SIB 2 million program
was passed for the construction of hospitals,
medical centers, and nursing homes; a limited
victory was won for Eisenhower on housing as
he asked for 140,000 housing units over a four
year period and was given 35,000 for one year;
the Atomic Energy Bill was passed which set
up machinery to create a private atomic energy
industry for generating power and which per
mits the AEC to exchange nuclear materials
and information with friendly nations.
Measures passed in Ihe House which will
probably be put into law by the Senate next
year:
Farm parity prices with a compromise version
of flexible price supports; social security ex
pansion; death penalty for peacetime espion
age; witness immunity to force Fifth Amend
ment witnesses to testify by protecting them
from prosecution based on their testimony.
All in all, it's an enviable record. Indications
are that local issues will settle the election. But
win or lose, the Republicans can be proud of
the fact that they injected a working atmo
sphere into Congress and didn't just sit around
and watch as some of their predecessors did.

pulling out all the stops to either "get in" or
"stay in." The dark handwriting is supposedly
on the wall for the Administration team.
Polls indicate that the Democrats will grab
power by as many as six seats in the Senate
and by a possible 50 in the House. History re
veals that only twice since the Civil War has
a party in power gained additional strength in
an off-year election.
Republicans faced with a dilemma have at
tempted to catch on to President Eisenhower's
coattails and make the election a vote of confi
dence in his administration. Eisenhower has
gathered the sheep into his fold in asking the
voters for a Republican Congress.
But, the President, who retains dignity wheth
er it be swinging a golf club to chop strokes
off his game or wielding a pen to enact a bill
into law, wanted to maintain his activity on
a high plane and not make the election a con
fidence vote.
Although he thought it would be out of char
acter to entertain a full scale stumping cam
paign, he has made several speeches and posed
for pictures with his adherents. He has made
no bones about the fact that "Ike needs more
Democrats" out of Congress. And so Republi
cans are staking their Congressional life on the
83rd Congress. ,
How good is the 83rd's record? Since neither
the Democrats nor the right-wing Republicans
had programs of their own, the question must
be answered in terms of Mr. Eisenhower's
legislative program. Much has been enacted,
much has not. The House, with a larger Re
publican majority, was more co-operative than
the Senate.
The working result was a reversed drift to
welfare-ntatism and positive proof that the 03rd

was far more productive than the Democratic
controlled 81st and 82nd.
Wha«t has been passed?
The St. Lawrence Seaway which was 30
years in the making; tax revision which is ex
pected to cut next year's anticipated revenues
by $1.36 billion; excise taxes, which saw many
20 per cent taxes halved; the Air Force Acad
emy was approved; $1.93 billion went in
grants-in-aid to states for highway improve
ment; the Commodity Credit Corporation was
given increased borrowing authority to the ex
tent of 51.75 bilhon.
The Korean Defense Pact was ratified; hos
pitals got a boost when a SIB 2 million program
was passed for the construction of hospitals,
medical centers, and nursing homes; a limited
victory was won for Eisenhower on housing as
he asked for 140,000 housing units over a four
year period and was given 35,000 for one year;
the Atomic Energy Bill was passed which set
up machinery to create a private atomic energy
industry for generating power and which per
mits the AEC to exchange nuclear materials
and information with friendly nations.
Measures passed in Ihe House which will
probably be put into law by the Senate next
year:
Farm parity prices with a compromise version
of flexible price supports; social security ex
pansion; death penalty for peacetime espion
age; witness immunity to force Fifth Amend
ment witnesses to testify by protecting them
from prosecution based on their testimony.
All in all, it's an enviable record. Indications
are that local issues will settle the election. But
win or lose, the Republicans can be proud of
the fact that they injected a working atmo
sphere into Congress and didn't just sit around
and watch as some of their predecessors did.

With Congressional elections less than a
week away, Democrats and. Republicans are
pulling out all the stops to either "get in" or
"stay in." The dark handwriting is supposedly
