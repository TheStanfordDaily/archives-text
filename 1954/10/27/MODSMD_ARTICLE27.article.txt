Private business versus public administration
this ancient controversy has reappeared in
time for elections, this time with a now twist
in the form of the Dixon-Yates contract.
The government, when faced with the prob
Jem of relieving TVA of the strain on its facili
ties caused by supplying the AKC Paducah
plant, directed the AEC board of commissioners
to investigate the possibility of employing a
private business to construct and operate the
necessary steam plant.
This was intended as an emergency measure
which would give the government time to study
the total situation and see whether expanding
TVA or converting fringe developments to
private ownership will be best for the nation
as a whole.
Opposition to Dixon-Yates has been led by

Senator Langer, a staunch Republican from
North Dakota who is convinced that letting
private business in on a piece of a government
project will be disastrous for the nation, and
Stephen A. Mitchell, national Democratic clusii
man.
Mitchell accuses the administration of not
opening the project to competitive bidding, and
backs up this charge with statements that the
Von Tresckow proposal would have saved the
taxpayers a million or so. The statements seem
contradictory to us maybe Mitchell can ex
plain just v/hat the Von Tresckow proposal was
if it was not a competitive bid.
When issues like the Dixon-Yates contract
become high-voltage political material, with
little information available, we wonder what the
purpose of political campaigns is constructive
criticism or destructive sniping?
