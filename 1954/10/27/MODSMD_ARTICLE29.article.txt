# Proposition Three Plans New Liquor Control Agency
## 
### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
One of the questions which
the people of California will he
asked to decide when they go
lo the poljs next week is a meas
ure to rearrange the present
liquor-law administration in the
state.
The measure, set on the ballot as
Proposition 3, would transfer ad
ministration of California's liquor
laws from the overworked, unsuit
ed-for-the-task Board of Equaliza
tion to a specially created office, the
Department ol Alcoholic Beverage
Control.
Proposition 3 is not an attempt to
change the laws which actually gov
ern the merchandising of liquor in
California, but is simply to give the
enforcement of these laws to a more
efficient agency.
AI) M IN ISTR AIION SET - U|>
In that respect, Proposition 3 will
have little effect on the voters. Al
though not a major campaign issue
tliis year, Proposition 3, if passed,
may become one of the hottest issues
of California politics to inaugurate
1955. A quick look at the history of
the alcoholic beverage control law
will help explain the reasons.
The present administrative set-up
was put into effect through a law
drawn up in 1934, right after the re
peal of prohibition, by a group which
included the former chief booster
of the beer barons, Artie Samish.
At the time the bill became law, as
a state constitutional amendment,
the Governor and the Legislature
were in the middle of a feud. No

| agreement could have been reached
: to set up a new agency. So the task
was turned over to the Board of
Equalization, a tax agency which at
llie time had very little real respon
sibility.
Since then the Board has been
given the job of collecting almost a
billion dollars in taxes, including
such headaches as the collection of
the gas tax.
Subsequently the Board has re
peatedly asked and has approved
measures which would have trans
ferred liquor control out of their
jurisdiction. The requests have been
| repeatedly ignored. Proposition 3
' involves many of the BOE's recom
i mendation.s.
Although both former Governor
Earl Warren and Governor Good
win J. Knight have "demanded"
such reforms; although Paul R.
; Leake, appointed to the Board of
Equalization by Warren, has "cru
saded" unceasingly for reform; and
although the necessity for .some
change has been evident to Califor
nia legislators since 1937 when the
•fir.-;I reform measure was proposed,
the decision of the legislators to put
this question on the ballot this year
was substantially the first actual
step which has been taken.
DIFFICULTIES IN KhTOKVI
Why have these requests been ig
nored?
The reasons that they have been
ignored are the same reasons why
Proposition 3 may be a little hot for
political fingers if it goes into effect
next year. The real reasons are a
little hard to pin down. About the
clearest statement made concerning
opposition to liquor-law enforce

ment reform was by the Southern
California member of the Board,
William G. Bonelli.
He was asked if it was the well
organized California liquor lobby
which had blocked reforms that the
Board brought forward. His answer
was, "You know it did."
There are other reasons. There is
the confusion fostered in former
years by legislative muddling as to
details of the proposed reforms.
There is the fact that Artie Sainish
so blatantly admitted in commenting
on his lobby's contributions to eam
| paigns. He said, "We've got to have
' a winner."
And the facts would seem to indi
i cate that the liquor lobl y lias had a
winner, or a majority of winners, for
! quite some time.
OTHKK PROBLEMS
If Proposition 3 receives the ap
j proval of the voters, the problem
I will then l>e how much of the old
will be incorporated into the new
enforcement policy. Will the sale of
liquor licenses go on in spite of the
ratio set by law at one license per
thousand people? Will the quasi
legal resale of these licenses at tre
mendous profits be allowed to con
tinue? How will the new Depart
ment of Alcoholic Beverage Control
solve the touchy problem of regu
lating retail liquor sales?
Proposition 3 does not offer any
answer to these problems which it
forces into the open, but does, ac
cording to the Commonwealth Club,
provide a "great improvement over
present conditions. . . . Proposition
3 is a step forward in the enforce
ment of better liquor law adminis
-1 tration than we now have."

One of the questions which
the people of California will he
asked to decide when they go

liquor-law administration in the
state.
The measure, set on the ballot as
Proposition 3, would transfer ad
ministration of California's liquor
laws from the overworked, unsuit
ed-for-the-task Board of Equaliza
tion to a specially created office, the
Department ol Alcoholic Beverage
Control.
Proposition 3 is not an attempt to
change the laws which actually gov

California, but is simply to give the
enforcement of these laws to a more
efficient agency.

In that respect, Proposition 3 will
have little effect on the voters. Al
though not a major campaign issue
tliis year, Proposition 3, if passed,
may become one of the hottest issues
of California politics to inaugurate
1955. A quick look at the history of
the alcoholic beverage control law
will help explain the reasons.
The present administrative set-up
was put into effect through a law
drawn up in 1934, right after the re
peal of prohibition, by a group which
included the former chief booster
of the beer barons, Artie Samish.
At the time the bill became law, as
a state constitutional amendment,
the Governor and the Legislature
were in the middle of a feud. No

| agreement could have been reached
: to set up a new agency. So the task
was turned over to the Board of
Equalization, a tax agency which at
llie time had very little real respon
sibility.
Since then the Board has been
given the job of collecting almost a
billion dollars in taxes, including
such headaches as the collection of
the gas tax.
Subsequently the Board has re
peatedly asked and has approved
measures which would have trans
ferred liquor control out of their
jurisdiction. The requests have been
| repeatedly ignored. Proposition 3
' involves many of the BOE's recom
i mendation.s.
Although both former Governor
Earl Warren and Governor Good
win J. Knight have "demanded"
such reforms; although Paul R.
; Leake, appointed to the Board of
Equalization by Warren, has "cru
saded" unceasingly for reform; and
although the necessity for .some
change has been evident to Califor
nia legislators since 1937 when the
•fir.-;I reform measure was proposed,
the decision of the legislators to put
this question on the ballot this year
was substantially the first actual
step which has been taken.
DIFFICULTIES IN KhTOKVI
Why have these requests been ig
nored?
The reasons that they have been
ignored are the same reasons why
Proposition 3 may be a little hot for
political fingers if it goes into effect
next year. The real reasons are a
little hard to pin down. About the
clearest statement made concerning
opposition to liquor-law enforce

ment reform was by the Southern
California member of the Board,
William G. Bonelli.
He was asked if it was the well
organized California liquor lobby
which had blocked reforms that the
Board brought forward. His answer
was, "You know it did."
There are other reasons. There is
the confusion fostered in former
years by legislative muddling as to
details of the proposed reforms.
There is the fact that Artie Sainish
so blatantly admitted in commenting
on his lobby's contributions to eam
| paigns. He said, "We've got to have
' a winner."
And the facts would seem to indi
i cate that the liquor lobl y lias had a
winner, or a majority of winners, for
! quite some time.

If Proposition 3 receives the ap
j proval of the voters, the problem
I will then l>e how much of the old
will be incorporated into the new
enforcement policy. Will the sale of
liquor licenses go on in spite of the
ratio set by law at one license per

liquor licenses go on in spite of the
ratio set by law at one license per
thousand people? Will the quasi
legal resale of these licenses at tre
mendous profits be allowed to con
tinue? How will the new Depart
ment of Alcoholic Beverage Control
solve the touchy problem of regu
lating retail liquor sales?
Proposition 3 does not offer any
answer to these problems which it
forces into the open, but does, ac
cording to the Commonwealth Club,
provide a "great improvement over
present conditions. . . . Proposition
3 is a step forward in the enforce
ment of better liquor law adminis
-1 tration than we now have."
