# 'Le Plaisir' Labled Cinematic Conglomeration--Disappointing
## 
### TOM ARP 
"Le Plaisir," playing at the
Guild in Menlo Park, is another
of those cinematic conglomera
tions in which three short stories,
with nothing in common but the
name of their author, are placed
end-to-end in an attempt to
achieve some sort of unified ef
fect.
The result id usually a mixture of
ideas and personalities as similar in
mood and representing about as
much unity as three consecutive tel
evision programs. The name of the
author and the titles of the short
stories thus treated are the greatest
attraction such films have, for
whether they are by Maugham, de
Maupassant, Stephen Crane, or even
Joseph Conrad, the pictures them
selves are always disappointing.
THE MASK"
The three de Maupassant stories
selected for this film are not par
ticularly good, not particularly bad.
The array of French actors is the
most impressive part, but again the
brevity of their separate roles leaves
most of their impressiveness to the
expectation aroused by the theater
marquee.
The first story, "The Mask," stars
Claude Dauphin as a doctor inter
rupted in his frolicking at a dance in
MOntmartre to revive a dancer un

| able to take the strain of a lively
I quadrille. The dancer, wearing a
| mask to hide the wrinkles time has
| bestowed upon him, is taken home,
j and his wife philosophizes to Dau
phin in the de Maupassant manner.
The episode in all takes less than
15 minutes, and much of the time
is devoted to sweeping the camera

j through the crowd
; in the dance hall
in an attempt to
; indicate the ex
j hilaration of the
mob. Dauphin
! does almost noth
i ing.

"The Model," the second episode,
is scarcely longer. It boasts Simone
j Simon (looking as youthful as she
| ever has) and Daniel Gelin, who is
youthful enough to require a beard
! to look his part. She is a model, he
j is a painter; they enjoy a brief idyl
| lie romance, he tires of her, and a
I full-scale catastrophe is required to
| reunite them. Most of their time the
j two stars spend rushing somewhere
!or breaking something, neither of
which allows them much time to
act.
"MADAME TELLIER"
The final story is called "The
House of Madame Tellier." The story
! takes as long to tell as the other two
combined, and for this reason alone
it would be the best of the three.
And here the French film industry
whips out two of its biggest guns:
Danielle Darrieux and Jean Gabin.

Madame Tellier, highly successful
and respected in her business, locks
her doors one Saturday (causing a
small riot in the town, a Norman
seaport) and troops her young ladies
off to the country to attend the first
communion of her niece. After an
amusing train ride she herds them
into her brother's waiting cart, and
off they bounce across the pictu
resque Norman countryside. The
fete is a success, and the brother
(Jean Gabin), having had a bit too
much to drink, evinces no small
amount of interest in Madame Kosa
(Danielle Darrieux), one of his sis
ter's tribe.
AUTHOR'S VOICE
Miss Darrieux and Mr. Gabin,
given the opportunity to appear on
the screen for a longer time, show
up better than any of the other
.stars. But the flat one-sidedness of
their roles gives them nothing to
work with. Consequently Miss Dar
rieux is seen either strutting about
with a cigarette dangling from her
lips, or weeping over her lost youth
during the church ceremony. Mr.
Gabin is limited to being a clownish
peasant, and this he does very well;
but it is a bit short of his capacities.
The narrator, supposedly the voice
of the author, is Peter Ustinov, who
gets off some of the best lines in
the film, and even adopts a French
accent for the sake of realism. But
nothing, not even the amazing Mr.
Ustinov, can hold the picture to
gether.
