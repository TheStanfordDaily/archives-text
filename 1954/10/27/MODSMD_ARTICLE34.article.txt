# Will These Be Saturday's Starting Quarterbacks?
## 
### 

GOING UP, GOING DOWNâ€”There will be a number of quarter
backs playing in this weekend's Stanford-WSC tilt. Here are
two ol them. Jerry Gustafson (left) of the Cards is a second
stringer who is edging towards a first-string berth, while Frank
Sarno of the Cougars seems headed in the opposite direction.
After warming the bench behind John Brodie for several weeks,
Gustafson seems to have come into his own as a play-caller.


Last week against Washington he played practically the entire
first quarter, and may be the starter this weekend. Sarno was
first string for WSC most of last season. However, his playing
against Idaho (when the Cougars were upset, 10-0) left much
to be desired, according to experts. Former second stringer
Bob Iverson has been named as starting QB against the Indians.
Iverson, Sarno, and Gustafson are all juniors.
