### JAE HUNLEY 
The success of the United
1 States aid program in Turkey
was stressed last night by Pro
| lessor Mollis B. Chonery, in a
talk at the Tuesday Evening
| Serjes.
Chenery, who has made a study
|of the economic modernization of
Turkey, pointed out the benefits that
both the United States and Turkey
have derived from the programs re
sulting from the ISM 7 Truman
Doctrine.
INCOME RISE
National income in Turkey has
been rising six or seven per cent a
year for the last five years, according
to Chenery.
"This is important," he said, "be
cause it is higher than the income
rise of any of the Western countries
and is comparable to that in the
Soviet Union. The example set by
the Turks in this respect will aid in
combating Communism in Asia by
demonstrating what American meth
ods can do."
Chenery stated that the program
of aid to Turkey has been beneficial
to the Unted States in that we have
learned from the progress in Turkey,
eign aid programs more successful.
"Among the things that we have
learned from the prigress in Turkey,
the fact that impresses me most,"
said Chenery, "is that a piecemeal
approach in an aid program will not
work. That is, we need to combine
military aid, technical assistance, and
economic help to obtain truly suc
cessful results."
TURKS OPTIMISTIC
"The Turks arc among the most
; optimistic peoples that I have ever
: met," Chenery mentioned. "In West
! ern Europe, American aid officials
j spend their time urging the coun
tries to do something. In Turkey,
time is spent suggesting that they
j go slower."
"As a result of their initiative,
| however," he added, "Turkish di
visions comprise 25 per cent of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
ground forces; they rank fourth in
the world production of wheat; and
they have made great advances in
combating Communism."
Chenery concluded, "I believe
that it is a great achievement for
Western aid to accomplish this much
in an Asiatic country, especially in
so short a time."
