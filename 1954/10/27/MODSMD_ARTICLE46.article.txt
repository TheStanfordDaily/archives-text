# Spiegelberg's Students Hear Swami Talk on God vs. Ego
## 
### 
Students of Professor Spiegelberg's Indian Civilization classes
were able yesterday to hear and question Swami Ramdas, one of
India's most famous living sages. The Indian spiritual leader is
on a global tour of good-will and, according to him, "has made
friends everywhereâ€”a most successful tour."
Ramdas referred to himself in the third person only. As he

put it, "God has taken away Ram
das' sense of Ego." This occurred
some three years ago while he was
living a secluded existence in a cave
in Kashmir.
MIND LOST IN GOD
The Swami said that this was not
a personal decision but a manifes
tation of divine will, for "his mind
was so filled with God it (ego) auto
matically disappeared."
Ramdas stressed the importance of
losing one's mind and thoughts in
God. When this happens, "it is phys
ically impossible to hate someone."
One should always contemplate and
receive the fullness of God first.
The Swami used parables and leg
ends to illustrate his points. He
pointed out that a God-conscious
ness can be revealed to anyone who
follows the precepts of his own re
ligion. He regards Christ as one of
the great incarnations, on a par with
Buddha, Krishna, and other great
Hindu and Buddhist deities.
EMOTIONAL ATTITUDES
When asked what he would do if
someone suddenly took his shoes and
glasses and threw them out the win
dow, Ramdas laughingly replied,
"Ramdas would dance with joy."
One does not have emotions when
tiie fullness of God is in one. Good
and evil are only in men's minds.
There is no evil in the world for

the all-pervading prcscncc of God is
everywhere.
