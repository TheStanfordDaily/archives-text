# 'SKIN OF OUR TEETH'
## Wilder's Comedy Labeled 'Theatrical 3-Ring Circus' 
### TERRY COMITO 
"The Skin of Our Teeth" may not be a great play but it's a
three-ring circus of a show, and the current Stanford Players'
production, despite a few weak spots, keeps it that way.
The play's conception of Man as an eternal suburbanite who
has managed to muddle through ice, deluge, and war is an en-

gaging one, but (for better or worse) *
Wilder has dressed it in a thick
layer of theatrical horseplay. Sets
fly ciazily nil over the stage, people
rii h up and down the aisles, and the
actors ■ top not once but dozens of
limes to talk to each other or to the
audience.
This is tricky stuff, but the Play- .
ers have pace and style enough to
bring most of it of! pretty well. |
Some of the individual scencs are j
extraordinarily exciting: the first and
second act finales for instance.
SEMI-DARK DRAMA
One might argue only with the j
apparently firmly held opinion that ]
comedy must be played on a well- I
lighted stage, and drama in semi- ]
darknes. Always.
In a show where the characters are j
generally less important than the
stage manage!', Priscilla Oliver as
Mrs. Antrobus is a gratifying excep
tion. Her wealth of small gesture,
her intensity and control without
(usually) any hint of phony histri
onics give the play its most real
moments.

To the role of Sabina, Ruth Binns
blinds her vivacity, her charm, and
her leys. Unfortunately, though, she
never quite makes up her mind
whether she's Eve Arden or an only
slightly-less nasal Corliss Archer.
She "does" both of them rather
well, but the alternation is a little
disconcerting. One could, of course,
argue that she should be neither one.
George Willey as Mr. Antrobus
does a frequently convincing job
until the third act. Here Wilder acts
down to what he apparently consid
ers brass tacks: the Moral. After the
war, it seems, everybody has to
build a Now-World-through-Co-op
e ration-and-Philosophy.
I ANCV TKAI'PINCS
Jn 1912 this may have shown that
Wilder was patriotic; 12 years later
it shows only that beneath the fancy
trappings he didn't really have much
to say.
The whole weight of making this
prolonged and not very inspired
preachment moving or even dra
matic is put on the actors. And Wil
ley just collapses into elocution.
Luckily, however, the third act is
short. For the rest, "The Skin of"
Our Teeth," if not as profound as
Wilder thought, proves to be pretty
good fun.


ON THE BRINK Mr. Antrobus (George Willey), newly elected
president of the Grand Order of Mammals, allows himself to be
spirited away by Miss Atlantic City (Ruth Binns). The scene is
from the Stanford Players' production of "The Skin of Our
Teeth" which opened last night in the Little Theater. It runs
through Saturday this week and Wednesday through Saturday
next v/eek. —Daily photo by Ken Green

comedy must be played on a well- I
lighted stage, and drama in semi- ]
darknes. Always.
In a show where the characters are j
generally less important than the
stage manage!', Priscilla Oliver as
Mrs. Antrobus is a gratifying excep
tion. Her wealth of small gesture,
her intensity and control without
(usually) any hint of phony histri
onics give the play its most real
moments.

To the role of Sabina, Ruth Binns
blinds her vivacity, her charm, and
her leys. Unfortunately, though, she
never quite makes up her mind
whether she's Eve Arden or an only
slightly-less nasal Corliss Archer.
She "does" both of them rather
well, but the alternation is a little
disconcerting. One could, of course,
argue that she should be neither one.
George Willey as Mr. Antrobus
does a frequently convincing job
until the third act. Here Wilder acts
down to what he apparently consid
ers brass tacks: the Moral. After the
war, it seems, everybody has to
build a Now-World-through-Co-op
e ration-and-Philosophy.
I ANCV TKAI'PINCS
Jn 1912 this may have shown that
Wilder was patriotic; 12 years later
it shows only that beneath the fancy
trappings he didn't really have much
to say.
The whole weight of making this
prolonged and not very inspired
preachment moving or even dra
matic is put on the actors. And Wil
ley just collapses into elocution.
Luckily, however, the third act is
short. For the rest, "The Skin of"
Our Teeth," if not as profound as
Wilder thought, proves to be pretty
good fun.


ON THE BRINK Mr. Antrobus (George Willey), newly elected
president of the Grand Order of Mammals, allows himself to be
spirited away by Miss Atlantic City (Ruth Binns). The scene is
from the Stanford Players' production of "The Skin of Our
Teeth" which opened last night in the Little Theater. It runs
through Saturday this week and Wednesday through Saturday
next v/eek. —Daily photo by Ken Green
"The Skin of Our Teeth" may not be a great play but it's a
three-ring circus of a show, and the current Stanford Players'
production, despite a few weak spots, keeps it that way.
The play's conception of Man as an eternal suburbanite who
has managed to muddle through ice, deluge, and war is an en-

gaging one, but (for better or worse) *
Wilder has dressed it in a thick
layer of theatrical horseplay. Sets
fly ciazily nil over the stage, people
rii h up and down the aisles, and the
actors ■ top not once but dozens of
limes to talk to each other or to the
audience.
This is tricky stuff, but the Play- .
ers have pace and style enough to
bring most of it of! pretty well. |
Some of the individual scencs are j
extraordinarily exciting: the first and
second act finales for instance.
