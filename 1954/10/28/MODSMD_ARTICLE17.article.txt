# Lawyers vs. Medics: A Case of Bad Blood
## 
### JOHN FLYNN 
Deypilc administration efforts,
the bitter, long-smouldering rival
ry between the Medical and Law
Schools has finally burst into a
full-scale feud, it was learned last
night.
An unidentified high official of
the Law School has turned over to
The Daily a secret three-and-a
quarter-page condensation of the
School's explosive "Correspond
ence File X," dealing exclusively
with tlie M.D.'s.
The incident began Oct. G when
Dr. G. B. Hobson (alias "The
Voice"), Associate Dean of the
Medical School, shot an angry
challenge to a sudden-death golf
match at Dean Carl B. Spaeth,
grahitc-jawed father of the legal
clan.
Emphasizing the "spirit and
physical vigor" of the Stanford
doctors and their desire to "dem
onstrate thai clean living and
proper utilization of medical ?ei
cnce brings results," Dr. I'obson
defied Dean Spaeth to form ;i team
"if there are enough able-bodied
men on the law faculty."
KMOTIONAI, FKRVOIt
Apparently flushed with emo
tional fervor at the heroic ring of
his words, Dr. Hobson recklessly
conceded "j.he use of electric wag
ons, carts, etc., to any of our more
decrepit law brethren."
Angrily brandishing his cane,
Dean Spaeth accepted the chal
lenge, acknowledging that "we are
decrepit, due primarily to the fact
that ail our medical advice comes

from members of your stall."
Craftily he suggested today, a
Thursday, as the day for the bat
tle. Near the end of the week hi:;
medieal opponents would be drawn
and weary from carrying their
huge rolls of money about with
them all week.
Dr. Robson accepted this handi
cap, commenting that "we have
pared down our team to nine
members. Realizing that there are
probably not .nine able-bodied
lawyers in the whole area, we
thought you might like to recruit
some members of other depart
ments."
SUBVERSIVE MEDS?
The time has been set for 1 p.m.
today at the Stanford golf course.
So far, as Dr. Robspn predicted,
the Law School has not been able
to find nine able-bodied golfers.
This may or may not imply sub
versive activities on the part of
over-zealous local doctors.
Last - minute strategy by the
grizzled Law School dean includes
appointment of Phil Ncal who "is
opposed to all forms of team
sports," as team captain. Can this
mean that the fury of the lawyers
will be released unchecked? This
reporter hesitates to reflect upon
the utter chaos and destruction of
such a decision.
A second move has been the ap
pointment of Dwifihl Adams as
"Professor of Emergency Law.'' a
mysterious and foreboding title.
At this writing the Medical
School waits, nine strong, mashies
in hand, cool and determined.
