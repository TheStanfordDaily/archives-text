# The 						Republican Foreign Policy
## 
### 
Foreign policy is a term not frequently men
tioned in the current campaign. It lacks the
emotional impact of Korea, the sensationalism
of corruption, the glamour of communism—the
three "real" issues of the election.
Yet who will question the fact that American
foreign policy today is a matter of vital inter
est, for it is a case of survival or extinction in
the era of the hydrogen bomb.
In reviewing the Republican foreign policy
of the past two years, we find that the admin
istration has generally followed the pattern
established under former president Harry Tru
man. The Republicans can boast of a few major
accomplishments and blush over numerous
bungles and mistakes.
The final settlement of the Korean War is a
feather proudly displayed in the cap of every
Republican campaigner. They rejoice—as do
we all—that American troops are no longer in
active battle.
Republicans also point with just pride at
SEATO, the South-Eastern Asia Treaty Organi
zation, which will provide greater military and
economic co-operation in an area seriously
threatened by communism.
Noble and praiseworthy though these
achievements may be, they should not obscure
the less favorable aspects of our relations with
Asia. If Korea was a victory, surely Indo-china
was a defeat.
Here we had the example of the United States
vacillating back and forth between the ex
tremes of immediate intervention and complete
aloofness. President Eisenhower said Ameri
can forces would not be used; Vice-president
Nixon called for troops; Secretary of State
Dulles assured the country that technical assist
ance was all we were prepared to give. This
left something to be desired in the way of a
firm, united policy.
The tragic result was the Geneva Confer
ence, at which we had the amazing example of
Secretary Dulles walking out in the midst of
negotiations—leaving France and 3ritain com

pletely stranded —refusing to go back, and then
finally changing his mind and returning at the
end to look at the pieces.
Throughout it all Dulles' one claim to dis
tinction seems to have been his proud an
nouncement that never once, during the entire
course of the deliberations, did he look at or
talk to Red Chinese Premier Chou-en-lai. What
a distinction—and what a way to solve inter
national problems.
Our policy in Europe is similarly spotty.
Everyone acclaims the London Pact as a step
ping-stone toward world peace. But what of
the events which preceded it?
What of the Republican promise to lower
tariffs for our European friends? President
Eisenhower settled for a one-year extension
of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act.
Seme tariffs were raised, including those on
Swiss watches, which cut deeply into the Swiss
export trade and strained relations with several
nations dependent on United States trade for
existence.
What of the ridiculous picture the United
States Slate Department presented after the
French parliament voted down EDC? Nothing
but angry recriminations, hurt denunciations,
and stunned insensibility from Washington.
No alternative plan was suggested, for none
had been devised. No proposal for a confer
ence to absolve differences was mentioned,
for no one was willing to speak to the French
to find out what those differences were.
Indeed, if it weren't for the quick-thinking of
British Secretary Anthony Eden, there never
would have been a London Conference for
which the Republicans could take credit.
Added to this are the gyrations of Senate
Majority Leader William Knowland as he de
mands war against Red China or United States'
withdrawal from the United Nations should Red
China be admitted.
This over-all picture of Republican foreign
policy is less rosy than many like to admit.

Foreign policy is a term not frequently men
tioned in the current campaign. It lacks the
emotional impact of Korea, the sensationalism
of corruption, the glamour of communism—the
three "real" issues of the election.
Yet who will question the fact that American
foreign policy today is a matter of vital inter
est, for it is a case of survival or extinction in
the era of the hydrogen bomb.
In reviewing the Republican foreign policy
of the past two years, we find that the admin
istration has generally followed the pattern
established under former president Harry Tru
man. The Republicans can boast of a few major
accomplishments and blush over numerous
bungles and mistakes.
The final settlement of the Korean War is a
feather proudly displayed in the cap of every
Republican campaigner. They rejoice—as do
we all—that American troops are no longer in
active battle.
Republicans also point with just pride at
SEATO, the South-Eastern Asia Treaty Organi
zation, which will provide greater military and
economic co-operation in an area seriously
threatened by communism.
Noble and praiseworthy though these
achievements may be, they should not obscure
the less favorable aspects of our relations with
Asia. If Korea was a victory, surely Indo-china
was a defeat.
Here we had the example of the United States
vacillating back and forth between the ex
tremes of immediate intervention and complete
aloofness. President Eisenhower said Ameri
can forces would not be used; Vice-president
Nixon called for troops; Secretary of State
Dulles assured the country that technical assist
ance was all we were prepared to give. This
left something to be desired in the way of a
firm, united policy.
The tragic result was the Geneva Confer
ence, at which we had the amazing example of
Secretary Dulles walking out in the midst of
negotiations—leaving France and 3ritain com

pletely stranded —refusing to go back, and then
finally changing his mind and returning at the
end to look at the pieces.
Throughout it all Dulles' one claim to dis
tinction seems to have been his proud an
nouncement that never once, during the entire
course of the deliberations, did he look at or
talk to Red Chinese Premier Chou-en-lai. What
a distinction—and what a way to solve inter
national problems.
Our policy in Europe is similarly spotty.
Everyone acclaims the London Pact as a step
ping-stone toward world peace. But what of
the events which preceded it?
What of the Republican promise to lower
tariffs for our European friends? President
Eisenhower settled for a one-year extension
of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act.
Seme tariffs were raised, including those on
Swiss watches, which cut deeply into the Swiss
export trade and strained relations with several
nations dependent on United States trade for
existence.
What of the ridiculous picture the United
States Slate Department presented after the
French parliament voted down EDC? Nothing
but angry recriminations, hurt denunciations,
and stunned insensibility from Washington.
No alternative plan was suggested, for none
had been devised. No proposal for a confer
ence to absolve differences was mentioned,
for no one was willing to speak to the French
to find out what those differences were.
Indeed, if it weren't for the quick-thinking of
British Secretary Anthony Eden, there never
would have been a London Conference for
which the Republicans could take credit.
Added to this are the gyrations of Senate
Majority Leader William Knowland as he de
mands war against Red China or United States'
withdrawal from the United Nations should Red
China be admitted.
This over-all picture of Republican foreign
policy is less rosy than many like to admit.
