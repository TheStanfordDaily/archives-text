## The 						Attempt That Failed 
### 
To the Editor:
This year there was an attempt to resurrect the
Stanford Men's Glee Club. The attempt has failed for
reasons which are typical of so many new ideas that
never get a chance to take a single breath of life on
this campus.
One reason was of course financial—always a worry
but not unconquerable. Another was a failure of talent
to turn out for auditions. Approximately 40 men tried
out but we needed more- especially tenors. Unused
talent is getting to be a bad habit on this campus.
We were also unable to obtain a director from the
music faculty who was wholeheartedly devoted to the
idea. And then there was a matter of competition with
the choir and the chorus. And on and on until reasons
for failure begin to sound more like excuses.
The principal reason for failure was that both stu
dents and faculty lacked the courage to start some
thing new.
Nevertheless it is my hope, along with others in
terested in a men's glee club, that this idea can be

worked out in the near future. It will have to lx? a
joint student-faculty cooperative project with only one
goal in mind—e successful glee club. One of the pre
dominant characteristics of this university is its casual
atmosphere, and a glee club would do much to express
the real Stanford character and would be a welcome
contrast to the somewhat formal rigidity of the choir
and the chorus.
Those who attempted this recent effort at revival of
the glee club quit before thoy got started, but they
also failed to get the support of a number of very
apathetic men who had the ability to sing but lacked
the initiative to put their talents to somfe creative use.
Outstanding colleges and universities throughout
the nation have glee clubs for which they are famous
and to which it is an honor to belong. As long as Stan
ford does not have a glee club it is lacking in its out
ward expression of "the Stanford spirit," and it is
denying a necessary, enjoyable, thrilling means of ex
pression to individuals within the university.
