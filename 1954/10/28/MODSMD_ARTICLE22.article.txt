# PRECINCT WORK
## De Grazia Tells Principles Of 'Grass Roots' Politics 
### HELEN DEWAR 
With the last fanfare of the
1954 political campaign drawing
to a close, eyes are now focused
on the candidates' final burst of
speech making and politicking.
Yet, few citizens realize the other
necessary facet oi' political cam
paigning— the "grass roots" tech
nique which involves campaign work
in its most fundamental form. It in
volves organization of party pre
cincts within a county and the ex
tensive foot work of the many pre
cinct workers.
Alfred de Grazia, associate profes
sor of political science and executive
chairman of the Committee on Re
search in Social Sciences at Stan
ford, has served as the principal or
ganize)' for the Democratic party oi
the 732 precincts of Santa Clara
County. Aiding him on his staff is
another member of the Stanford
faculty, Carl Stover, also of the Po
litical Science Depatrment.
In a recent Di>ily interview, de
Grazia remarked that he had been
retired from politics for a number of
years, but now, deciding to become
active again, "looked for the tough
est and most necessary political job
there was." This he found to be the
job of organizing a county for pre
cinct work.

"112 began," he went on to say, "by j
! taking all my party's clubs in the j
| county and from them selecting the J
1 most active workers. I then decided
on the definite territory to allot to
each club and divided the larger un
covered part into task force areas
and looked around for promising
leaders and precinct workers for
each."
State Democratic leaders have
ranked Santa Clara County as per
haps the best organized county in
the state.
De Grazia pointed out that
finances come entirely from local
sources, mainly individual and group
j contributions. "Very little money is
| collected," he said, "but much less
is required for precinct work than
j for the more splashy and less effec
tive means of campaigning, such as
radio and billboards. In precinct
campaigning, a person's entire at
tention is captured, even though for
I just a few minutes."
Ssnta Clara County, the fifth larg
| est in the state, includes Palo Alto,
! San Jose, Gilroy, Sunnyvale, Moun
; tain View, Milpitas, Saratoga, Mor
i gan Hill, San Martin, and Santa
I Clara. Each precinct involves about
j 200 registered voters, regardless of
party registration, and may cover
I anywhere from one city block to
many square miles.

De Grazia and his staff reorganized
I the campaigning itself in that, pre
vious to this year, each candidate
I had his own indiviaual group of
workers. Now the campaigning is
under one directive and only one
group of party workers invades a
single territory.
Dt> Grazia drew a line of compari
son between "grass - root" political
work and the tactics of warfare.
"There is the same recruitment, as- ;
signment, staff work, intelligence,
and supply of material," he pointed
out, "but we lack the resources, re
liable manpower, and efficient disci
i pline of an effective army."
"Nothing is so effective as personal
contact and every effective propa
! gandist knows this," he pointed out.
"We shall cover every bit of the
I county before polling time.
"We are forced to recognize a very
1 realistic condition of this type oi
! political work — that few people
! change their minds. The most im
! portant thing is the mustering of
favorable voters to the polls."
, j "Most politicians," de Grazia ar
| gued, "do not understand the real
| organization of politics and keep
ii grasping for the single great issue
I that will magically win the cam
' i paign and have no conception of the
• I routine, detail, and arduous house
i keeping of the true campaign or

In a recent Di>ily interview, de
Grazia remarked that he had been
retired from politics for a number of
years, but now, deciding to become
active again, "looked for the tough
est and most necessary political job
there was." This he found to be the
job of organizing a county for pre
cinct work.

"112 began," he went on to say, "by j
! taking all my party's clubs in the j
| county and from them selecting the J
1 most active workers. I then decided
on the definite territory to allot to
each club and divided the larger un
covered part into task force areas
and looked around for promising
leaders and precinct workers for
each."
State Democratic leaders have
ranked Santa Clara County as per
haps the best organized county in
the state.
De Grazia pointed out that
finances come entirely from local
sources, mainly individual and group
j contributions. "Very little money is
| collected," he said, "but much less
is required for precinct work than
j for the more splashy and less effec
tive means of campaigning, such as
radio and billboards. In precinct
campaigning, a person's entire at
tention is captured, even though for
I just a few minutes."
Ssnta Clara County, the fifth larg

j 200 registered voters, regardless of
party registration, and may cover
I anywhere from one city block to
many square miles.

De Grazia and his staff reorganized
I the campaigning itself in that, pre
vious to this year, each candidate
I had his own indiviaual group of
workers. Now the campaigning is

work and the tactics of warfare.
"There is the same recruitment, as- ;

and supply of material," he pointed
out, "but we lack the resources, re
liable manpower, and efficient disci
i pline of an effective army."
"Nothing is so effective as personal

! gandist knows this," he pointed out.
"We shall cover every bit of the
I county before polling time.
"We are forced to recognize a very
1 realistic condition of this type oi
! political work — that few people
! change their minds. The most im
! portant thing is the mustering of
favorable voters to the polls."
