### HELEN DEWAR 
What exactly is the American 1
"dating system" and of what
importance is it in American life,
especially to the university
student?
Possible answers to this and simi- !
lar questions along the line of Amer
ican and foreign social customs were
offered at a recent informal seminar
ol' four American students and six
of the ASSU Foreign Scholars.
The Americans — Julie Rufner,
Norm Lenzer, and Foreign Scholar
Committee co-chairmen Lois Moss
man and John Sprague—explained
the pattern of social events in the

United States based on individual
dates. They contrasted this pattern
with that in practically every for
eign country in which social func

und receive much more parental re

Ekhart Rottka. scholar from Ber
lin, proposed that the roots of this
rather unique American system stem

American manner of living in many

Lenzer interjected that he believed

, each other in a much freer fashion j
I than in most foreign countries.
Monica Kaufman of Switzerland j
| observed that girls here appear much i
i older than in her country and tend {
to marry earlier. "University life in j
Switzerland is so extensive," she
said, "that there is no time for both i
social* and academic life."
"Egypt would not accept a dating .
system," Nabiia Nouhy remarked, j
"because it is felt that the young

people are not responsible enough,
and our religion would not accept
it."
Another presumption was drawn
that the dating system is an out
growth of coeducation from an early
age, and one will find no evidences
of such a social pattern where there
is separation in schools.
Muni Soofi oi Pakistan. Dave Pen
ny of Australia, and Aki Calametsis
of Greece also reflected marked dif
ferences between social mores here
and in their respective countries.
