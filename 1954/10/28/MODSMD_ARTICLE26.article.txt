# Harriers Will Run Saturday
## 
### 
Track mentor Jack Weiershauser
| will send a strong, well-balanced
Stanford cross-country team into
j action for the first time this fall
! against UCLA and California Sat
urday on the Bears' Berkeley course.
Will King, Bob Reed, Chuck
Strong, Ralph Love, and Maury
Graves make up the Indians' first
| line team. Graves is a promising
! freshman distance man from Oak
! land High.
Although all Stanford runners are
expected to test Cal's four-mile
I road run, King, Reed, Love, and
j Graves have been slowed in their
training by colds. Love also has a
bad Achilles tendon.
In cross-country the team with the
lowest score wins with one point
awarded for first place, two points
for second place, etc. The first five
finishers score points, and the sixth
and seventh men may push opposi
tion runner back additional places.
