# Split-T May Solve Stanford's Slowness
## 
### 

TAYLOR'S ANSWER —Coach Chuck Taylor thinks he has the
answer to the speed problem of the Indian backfield. Finding
the Card backs too slow to run the ends well from the T, Taylor
has started utilizing split-T plays in order to keep the opposition
"honest." Here Stanford quarterback Jerry Gustafson rolls out
for thirteen yards against Washington on au optional pass-run

play. Blocking for Gustafson is halfback Gordie Young (No. 44),
who is knocking out Husky Bill Albrecht (No. 40). Indian half
back Ernie Dorn (No. 42), is on the ground. Washington end Jim
Houston (No. 80) is attempting to overtake Gustafson. Taylor
has indicated he will use more split-T plays against Wash
ington State Saturday. —Daily photo by Frank Huntress
