# Zete I Blasts Biz I, 13-0

### DON JACKSON 
Zeta Psi I made it three in a row
yesterday, rolling to a 13-0 triumph
over Biz School I to retain their lead
in League I of intramural football.
Behind the strong passing arm of
Malcolm McCloud, the Zetes chalked
up touchdowns in the early minutes
of each half, and stalled the only
drives by the Biz School gridders
that threatened the Zete goal.
Powered by sharp blocking, the
Zetes tallied first on a short pass
from McCloud to Fletcher Metten,
after a long aerial from McCloud to
Tom Howell put the ball on the
Biz School two-yard line.
Early in the second half the win
ners scored again, this time on a
fourth-down toss from McCloud to
Steve Horrell. The conversion at
tempt. a short flip to Howell, made it
13-0.
An earlier march by the Zetes that
took them to the losers' three-yard
stripe was halted when McCloud
was dumped for losses on two con
secutive plays.
