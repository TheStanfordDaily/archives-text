# 'Will Name Quarterback Today' Says Coach Chuck
## 
### 
Coach Chuck Taylor said last night that he would name Satur
days quarterback this morning. Both Jerry Gustafson, who has
been hampered slightly by a bad thumb and John Brodie have
looked good all week in practice, but Taylor stated that whoever
started against WSC would play 50 minutes of the game.
Apparently Taylor has abandoned the "two platoon" quarter-

back system which he has used to 4
date this season. His choice will de
pend on whether the coaching staff
decides on a running or passing
game against the Cougars. The as
sumption is that Brodie is the pass
ing signal-caller, but that the ground
game moves better with Gustafson
in.
However yesterday's work con
sisted mainly of defensive work and
passing before a rugged half hour
scrimmage, with which Taylor was

â™¦
well pleased. "There were no in
j dividual stars, but the whole team
is coming along well," he added.
Don Manoukian, who has been
| running with the first string this
i week,' received a concussion, and
| trainer Connie Jarvis listed him a.s
| a doubtful participant against WSC
j unless he snaps out of it soon.
