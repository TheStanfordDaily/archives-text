WHAT EVERY YOUNG COED SHOULD WEAR
Gather round, girls. Snap open a pack of Philip Morris, light up,
relax and enjoy that mild fragrant vintage tobacco while Old Dad
tells you about the latest campus lashions.
The key word this year is casual. Be casual. I'e slapdash, lie rakish.
Improvise. Invent your own ensembles — like ski pants with a peek
a-boo blouse, like pajama bottoms with an ermine stole, like a hocky
sweater with a dirndl. . . . ,
(Dirndl, incidentally, is one of the truly fascinating words in the
English language. Etymologists have quarreled over its origin lor
years. Some hold with Professor -Manley Lk that Lirinil is a coi 1 op
tion of Dardanelle and is so named Because it resembles the skirts
worn by the women of that region. r I his theory, is at first glance
plausible, but begins to fall apart when you consider that there are
no women jn the Dardanelle region because of the loalhesome .ocal
custom of female infanticide.)
(Another theory is advanced by Dr. Clyde Feb. Dirndl, says he,
is a contraction of "dairy in the dell" and r< lers to the milkmaidis-h
appearance of the skirt. But again close examination causes one to
abandon a plausible hypothesis. As every child knows, it is not "dairy
in the dell" but "farmer in the dell", in which case the skirt should
be called not dirndl but firndl. . .
(There are some who contend we will never know the true origins
of dirndl. To those faint hearted Cassandras I say, remember how
everyone laughed at Edison and Franklin and 1 ulton and Marconi
aud Sigafoos. ISigafoos, in case you have forgotten, invented tin*
nostril, without which breathing, as we know it today, would not be
The origins* of'dirndl will he found, say I.,and anyone
who believes the contrary is a lily-livered churl and i1 he'll step
outside for a minute, I'll give him a thrashing he won't soon lorget.)
But T digress. We were smoking a Philip Morvi? and talking about
the latest campus styles. Casual, we agree, is the key word. But
casual need not mean drab. Liven up your outfits with a touch of
glamor. Even the lowly dungaree and man-shirt combination can
be made exciting if you'll adorn it with a simple necklace of 1-0
matched diamonds. With Bermuda shorts, wear gold knee-cymbals.
Be guided by the famous poet Cosmo Sigafoos (who e brother Sam
it was who invented the nostril) who v. rote:
Sparkle, my beauty,
Shimmer and shine,
The night is young,
The air's lilee wine,
Cling to a leaf,
Hang on a vine,
Crawl on your belly,
It's time to dine.
(Mr. Sigafoos,.it should be explained, was writing about a glow
worm. Insects, as everyone knows, are among Mr. Sigafoos' favorite
subjects for poems. Who can ever forget his immortal Ode to a Boll
Weevil? Or his Tumbling Along With the Tumbling Tv.mbbbvg?
Or his Fly Gently, Sweet Aphid? Mr. Sigafoos has been inactive
since the invention of DDT.)
But I digress. We were smoking a Philip Morris and discussing
fashions. Let us turn now to luadwear. The motif in hats this year
will be familiar American scenes. There will be models to tit. every
head — for example, the "Empire State Building" for tall thin heads;
the "Jefferson Memorial" for squatty ones; "Niagara Falls" for dry
scalps. Feature of the collection is the "Statue of Liberty," complete
with a torch that actually burns. This is very handy for lighting
your Philip Morrises, which is very important because no matter
how good Philip Morrises are, they're nowhere unless you light them.
We come now to the highlight of this year's fashion parade — a mad
fad that's sweeping the chic set at high tone campuses all over the
country. All the gals who are in the van, in the swim, and in the
know are doing it. Doing what, you ask? Getting tattooed, of course!
You just don't rate these days unless you've got at least an anchor
on your biceps. If you really want to be the envy of the campus, get
yourself a four masted schooner, or a heart with FATHER printed
inside of it, or a—
I interrupt this column to bring you a special announcement. A
runner has just handed me the following bulletin:
"The origin of the word dirndl has at long last been discovered.
On June 27, 1840, Dusty Schwartz, the famous scout and Indian
fighter, went into the Golden Nugget Snloon in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
The Goldep Nugget had just imported a new entertainer from the
East. She came out and did her dance in pink tights. Dusty Schwartz
had never seen anything like that in his life, and he was much
impressed. He watched with keen interest as she did her numbers,
and he thought about her all the way home. When he got home, his
wife Feldspar was waiting to show him a new skirt she had made
for herself. 'How do you like my new skirt, Dusty?' said Feldspar.
He looked at the large voluminous garment, then thought of the
pink tights on the dancing girl. 'Your skirt is darn dull,' said Dusty.
'Darn dull' was later shortened to 'dirndl' which is how dirndls
got their name." ©Max Shtilman, 1 !>."• 1
