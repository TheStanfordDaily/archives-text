### DICK MANSFIELD 
Associate Editor, The Daily
A proposed draft of a drastically revised ASSU constitution
termed by ASSU President Pete Bing "probably the most im
portant piece of business (the Executive Committee) will handle
this year"—v/as received in the ASSU office yesterday and copies
v/ere distributed to Exeom members in their weekly meeting
last nighty
The constitutional draft, put into final form by Harrison Schmidt

of the Class of '54 and sent lo Stan
ford from Texas, where Schmidt is
on active duty with tlie Air Force,
will he studied hy Exeom members
this week. Discussion on the draft
is expcclcd to begin at next week's
meeting.
Schmidt's report, designed to ac
company the constitutional draft, is
expected in its entirety in ihc ASSU
office within the next day or two,
Bing indicated.
Election procedure was the topic
of extended discussion at last night's
meeting.
Exeom passed a motion to dccide
placing of names on ballots in the
forthcoming primary and final elec
tions by drawing the names from a
hat. Previously, names had been
placed on ballots alphabetically,
with the contention being raised
that an automatic advantage went to
the person whose name was placed
highest on each ballot.
Also passed, to apply this quar
ter's elections only, was a motion to
reopen the polls on the first evening
of voting in both primary and final
elections, for the benefit of graduate
students unable to vote during the
clay.
The move was at the request of
Ed Council of the Education School;
polls will be open from 7 to 8 p.m.
The referendum which will de
cide whether or not to sanction the
newly - reformed Interfratcrnity
Council, incorporating features of
the old Interfratcrnity Board, will
appear on the primary ballot, Ex
eom dccidcd. Purpose of the action
was to assure a maximum vote on
the measure; it was feared that there
would be a decline in vote in the
finals since several offices will be
decided in the primaries.
The rule now in cfTcct under IFC
forbidding fraternity men (and, by
tacit consent, eating club men) from
campaigning in freshman men's resi
dences, will be studied by Rudy
Reich and Jim Flanagan of Exeom,
with a decision due today as to the
ruling's validity.
Liz Livadary presented a report on
the progress of her Student-Faculty
Committee, recommending that the
committee, which would work for
closcr contact between students and
faculty, be made a standing com
mittee of ASSU. The question was
tabled to study the .contention of
Public Relations Committee that the
proposed committee would merely
duplicate established Pub Rcl Com
functions.

A proposed draft of a drastically revised ASSU constitution
termed by ASSU President Pete Bing "probably the most im
portant piece of business (the Executive Committee) will handle
this year"—v/as received in the ASSU office yesterday and copies
v/ere distributed to Exeom members in their weekly meeting
last nighty
The constitutional draft, put into final form by Harrison Schmidt

of the Class of '54 and sent lo Stan
ford from Texas, where Schmidt is
on active duty with tlie Air Force,
will he studied hy Exeom members
this week. Discussion on the draft
is expcclcd to begin at next week's
meeting.
Schmidt's report, designed to ac
company the constitutional draft, is
expected in its entirety in ihc ASSU
office within the next day or two,
Bing indicated.
Election procedure was the topic
of extended discussion at last night's
meeting.
Exeom passed a motion to dccide
placing of names on ballots in the
forthcoming primary and final elec
tions by drawing the names from a
hat. Previously, names had been
placed on ballots alphabetically,
with the contention being raised
that an automatic advantage went to
the person whose name was placed
highest on each ballot.
Also passed, to apply this quar
ter's elections only, was a motion to
reopen the polls on the first evening
of voting in both primary and final
elections, for the benefit of graduate
students unable to vote during the
clay.
The move was at the request of
Ed Council of the Education School;
polls will be open from 7 to 8 p.m.
The referendum which will de
cide whether or not to sanction the
newly - reformed Interfratcrnity
Council, incorporating features of
the old Interfratcrnity Board, will
appear on the primary ballot, Ex
eom dccidcd. Purpose of the action
was to assure a maximum vote on
the measure; it was feared that there
would be a decline in vote in the
finals since several offices will be
decided in the primaries.
The rule now in cfTcct under IFC
forbidding fraternity men (and, by
tacit consent, eating club men) from
campaigning in freshman men's resi
dences, will be studied by Rudy
Reich and Jim Flanagan of Exeom,
with a decision due today as to the
ruling's validity.
