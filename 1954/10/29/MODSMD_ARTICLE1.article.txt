# Card Gridders to Meet Upset-Minded Cougars
## Taylor Shuffles Stanford Lineup 
### BILL NICHOLS 
Stanford will present a much
changed lineup tomorrow when
the Indians take the field against
the underdog Washington State
Cougars at 2 p.m. in the Stadium.
Coach Chuck Taylor announced a
i starting lineup yesterday that had
John Brodie back in the signal call-
J er spot and a complete new set of
| guards and tackles. Two sopho
l more Dons, Manoukian and Carswcll.
i get the starting call for the first
time at the guard spot. At tackles
will be Captain Win Wedge and
John Ludekc.
The remainder of the lineup is the
same—John Stewart and Dick Jones
at ends, Jerry Goldberg at center,
Ernie Dorn and Gordie Young at
halls, and Bill Tarr in the fullback
slot.
Washington State's ofTense has
i sputtered all season but in Duke
Washington they have the second
leading ground gainer in the Con
j fercncc and the eighth in the na
tion. The Duke is one of the fop
! backs on the Coast, and many ob
j servers rank him ahead of Bob Dav-
I enport of UCLA.
Although Stanford's offense has
, not looked too sharp either, the
j game should be decided in this de
partment'. Washington State is sec
ond in the PCC in rushing offense,
while Stanford is near the bottom
in rushing defense. On the other
| hand, Stanford's passing should go
4 because the WSC pass defense is
I very weak.
John Brodie is considered the
| "passing" quarterback over Jerry
I Gustafson, and Coach Chuck Taylor
has announced that Brodie will play
! at least 50 minutes of the game.
This means that the Cards will go
J all out to exploit the Cougar weak
! ness that allowed Paul Larson of Cal
i to complete 17 of 31 passes for a
new school record, Oregon State to
| complete 10 out of 19, and Idaho to
score its touchdown in an upset 10-
J 0 win via the air lanes.
Washington State came out of the
Idaho game free from injuries, but
j Stanford is not so fortunate. End
I Dick Jones has missed practice
| most of the week thanks to a game
lee, and guard Don Manoukian has
a concussion, but both are expected
to go at close to top speed by tomor
row.
If Manoukian is unable to meet
the opening whistle, Tony Mosich,
who has an injured shoulder, will !
replace him.
Washington Slate runs most of
their plays from a winged T, occas
sicnally shifting into the single-wing.

KNBC will carry tomorrow's
clash between Stanford and Wash
ington State, starting at 1:45 p.m.
Jack Shaw will do the play-by
play with Mel Venter doing the
color.

Washington, who has provided the
breakaway threat needed so badly
by the Cougars last year, is the top
runner with a 5.8 yard per carry
average. He has scored on runs of
53, f»0, and 7:5 yards so far this sea
son.
The Washington State quarterback

situation is also causing Cougar
head coach A 1 Kirchcr ;.ome head
aches. Frank Sarno, a f stocky 200
pounder, ran the team ag;.insl Ida
ho, but Bo)) lvei*on seems destined
to get the call tomorrow. The Cou
gar line averages 200 pound.; and i-;
led by Tom Gunnati at left tackle.
Coach Taylor said the Indians
were in for a rough game asiaim t
WSC, and that the Cougars would
be looking for revenge after then
astounding upset at the hand of the
Idaho Vandals last Saturday.
He also said that the Cards had
looked good during the hard work
outs in the first part of the week.
Yesterday the workouts ea;-ed off,
though, as the squad went through
a passing and play calling drill ~an'
pads.
The Cougars will arrive at 3 p.m.
today and will work out briefly in
the Stadium before retiring to Rick
ey's for the night.
