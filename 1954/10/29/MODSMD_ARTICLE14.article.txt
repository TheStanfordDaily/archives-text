STOCKHOLM. Oct. 2H (UP) Er
nest Hemingway won the 1954 Nobel
Prize for Literature today for his
"style-making mastership" demon
strated in "The Old Man and the
Sea."
The 18 judges of the Swedish
Academy of Literature selected the
56 - year - old novelist as the fifth
American winner of the Nobel Prize
in its 50-year history. Sinclair Lew
is, Eugene O'Neill, Pearl Buck, and
William Faulkner won it before
Hemingway. â€¢
Hemingway's virile epics of pride
and passion such as "A Farewell to
Arms" and "For Whom the Dell
Tolls" had brought him considera
tion by the Academy for the prize,
but never the award.
