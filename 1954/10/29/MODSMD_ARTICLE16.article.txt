# Election Issue Pros and Cons Are Discussed

### MARY ELLEN ROMNEY 
A comprehensive picture of the 20
state-wide propositions on the Nov.
2 ballot was presented last night by
Mrs. William Ervine and Mrs. Walter
Gamage, speakers from the League
of Women Voters, at a special edu
cational program sponsored by the
Stanford Political Union.
The discussion group met in the
Law School Building. Union Presi
dent BiJI Fundcnbcrg introduced tho
speakers, who explained the con
tent, history, and pros and cons of
each of the issues.
The controversial alcoholic bever
age control proposition, Proposition
3, proposes establishing a depart
ment exclusively for liquor control,
explained Mrs. Ervine. The elected
Board of Equalization, which now
administers over 50 per cent of Cali
fornia state taxes, would be replaced
by an appointive director and a
three-man Board of Appeals.
Arguments for the proposition
state that liquor enforcement could
be carried out. most effectively under
a single head responsible to the Gov
ernor, freeing the BOE for its func
tions as a major tax-collecting agen
cy. This would eliminate discrepan
cies existing under the present dis
trict system.
Opponents of the bill argue thai
liquor enforcement would become a
political football, ruining the conti
nuity of administration and placing
the office-holders too close to fear
of political removal.
The McLain-sponsored Proposition
4, the only initiative issue on the
ballot, proposes raising aid to needy
aged to $100 a month, from the pres
ent $80, authorizing the Legislature
to raise but not lower the payments.
Increased cost of living, stepped
up buying power, and moral obliga
tion to support needy aged are the
pros of the issue. Cons are that the
measure would increase the state's
fixed funds by $70,000,000 a year,
pushing farther out. of balance an
already strained budget. California's,
pension payments arc now one-third
higher than the national average.
Proposition 14, which has no offi
cial argument against it, would ex
empt colleges from paying taxes on
land where buildings are under con
struction. This, Mrs. Ervine pointed
out is a logical extension of the
buildings - under - construction ex
emption.
