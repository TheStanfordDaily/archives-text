r ' lifornia has long been known as a "liberal"
state.
For eleven years wo had as governor one of
riost intelligent, forward-looking men in
/.merican politics, Earl V/arren.
Now California voters are faced with the re
i i ty of electing a man to fill the gov
ernor's chair in-Sacramento for the next four
years.
Wo feel that the only possible choice for the
oter, be he Democrat or Republican, is
mocratic candidate Richard Graves.
though Graves has expressed opinions on
most of the campaign issues, we feel that the
• ent should be specially interested in his
>n state aid for schools and on academic
freedom.
i T e has gone on record as opposing the part
Knight's budget which would cut down ap
itions to universities and state schools
: om the 528.3 million provided in Warren's
■iget to a mj%j.ffcjil4.,.9 million. This cut was
-ommendedf by Knight in spite of drastic
ler and class-room shortages, in the face
double sessions end overcrowding in the
schools.
'Jraves has also ntrongly objected to the in
• ase of 52,700,000 in student fees for state
-• ols and universities. He feels that, an in
crease on liquor taxes would be a more desir
ble way to up the state's income.
ii the matter of academic freedom, Graves
' -en a firm stand against loyalty oaths,

which he labeled as "ineffective in catching
Communists" and "objectionable because they
single out whole groups of Americans as sus
pects and cast aspersions on theijr previous
loyalty."
(Knight has defended the oath against both
former governor Warren and University of Cal
ifornia President Robert Sproul, and has de
clared "I don't think it hurts anyone to sign the
oath.")
Graves, refusing to equate controversy with
subversion, has expressed concern over the
trend of pressure toward conformity, of re
luctance and even fear in expressing unortho
dox opinions.
Recently, he pointed out the results of a sur
vey taken by a Los Angeles newspaper which
stated that 40 per cent of that city's high school
social science teachers were afraid to discuss
the New Deal, public housing, and communism,
that over 20 per cent considered the U.S. Con
stitution and the Bill of Rights "dangerous sub
jects" for classroom discussion.
He calls for a restoration of freedom to our
classrooms.
In every one of Graves' stands on campaign
issues—agriculture, water and power, welfare
programs, labor relations, public housing —
can be seen his emphasis on fair, impartial
legislation and his firm belief in freedom of
speech, thought, act, and inquiry.
In the battle for governor, we feel that the
liberal student can make but one decision—

most of the campaign issues, we feel that the

Knight's budget which would cut down ap

ii the matter of academic freedom, Graves
' -en a firm stand against loyalty oaths,

which he labeled as "ineffective in catching
Communists" and "objectionable because they
single out whole groups of Americans as sus
pects and cast aspersions on theijr previous
loyalty."
(Knight has defended the oath against both
former governor Warren and University of Cal
ifornia President Robert Sproul, and has de
clared "I don't think it hurts anyone to sign the
oath.")
Graves, refusing to equate controversy with
subversion, has expressed concern over the
trend of pressure toward conformity, of re
luctance and even fear in expressing unortho
dox opinions.
Recently, he pointed out the results of a sur
vey taken by a Los Angeles newspaper which
stated that 40 per cent of that city's high school
social science teachers were afraid to discuss
the New Deal, public housing, and communism,
that over 20 per cent considered the U.S. Con
stitution and the Bill of Rights "dangerous sub
jects" for classroom discussion.
He calls for a restoration of freedom to our
classrooms.
In every one of Graves' stands on campaign
issues—agriculture, water and power, welfare
programs, labor relations, public housing —
can be seen his emphasis on fair, impartial
legislation and his firm belief in freedom of
speech, thought, act, and inquiry.
In the battle for governor, we feel that the
liberal student can make but one decision—
