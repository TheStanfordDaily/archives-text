umbia T > ity's 150-pound football team
' ;! Columbia Grammar, 13-6 at Baker Field yes
. The excel!< nt p.,- ing of Captain Ben Barker
responsible for t! • Lion touchdowns.

''In the first quarter Barker hit Mike Ferragamo, an
end, with an 8-yard aerial on the Grammar 10-yard
line. Ferragamo went across untouched. Another
Barker-to-Ferragamo pass was good for the extra
point.
"Again in the third session the Lions scored on a
25-yard pass, with the same men combining for the
score.
"A 60-yard pass play from Harlan Stroud to. Mike
Hudson was good for a Grammar touchdown in the
closing minutes of the game.
"The Lions compiled 225 yards on the ground to
their foe's 25."
A line score follows.
The explanation is simple enough, as we get it from
our New York correspondent. Zimbo is working as a
campus correspondent at Columbia for the Herald-
Tribune in New York City. After the game, the Times
man came over and asked him for help, as he didn't
know the names of the players.
Zimbo, as you can see, helped.
Result, to me at least, is to glory in the knowledge
that pranksters can still get away inventing people
who never did and never will exist.
And there's a bit of satisfaction in knowing that
even the New York Times can be suckered occas
sionally.

If;.is off to Ihe Ch: ppie for one of the funniest
•ver wit!i "The Harlan Stroud Incident."
'••e Chaparral would o well to note that Stroud's

i xpose.)
author Dick Maltzman has yet to hear the
V.troud. And ;>. I suspect, has the nation. We

Ii ■i just received the latest in
•i- once of Stroud from our
Now York correspondent,.
The chief of our New York Bu
i was perusing the Times the
( day, October I(J to be exact,
■ re, hidden in the oblivion ol
ports pages, she found tha
following priceless insertion.
(We have changed nothing
fx, n the staid and straight .style
o< the New York Times, pre
f' lring t<i quote verbatim.)

"LION" 150-POUNDERS WIN

umbia T > ity's 150-pound football team
' ;! Columbia Grammar, 13-6 at Baker Field yes
. The excel!< nt p.,- ing of Captain Ben Barker
responsible for t! • Lion touchdowns.

''In the first quarter Barker hit Mike Ferragamo, an
end, with an 8-yard aerial on the Grammar 10-yard
line. Ferragamo went across untouched. Another
Barker-to-Ferragamo pass was good for the extra
point.
"Again in the third session the Lions scored on a
25-yard pass, with the same men combining for the
score.
"A 60-yard pass play from Harlan Stroud to. Mike
Hudson was good for a Grammar touchdown in the
closing minutes of the game.
"The Lions compiled 225 yards on the ground to
their foe's 25."
A line score follows.
The explanation is simple enough, as we get it from
our New York correspondent. Zimbo is working as a
campus correspondent at Columbia for the Herald-
Tribune in New York City. After the game, the Times
man came over and asked him for help, as he didn't
know the names of the players.
Zimbo, as you can see, helped.
Result, to me at least, is to glory in the knowledge
that pranksters can still get away inventing people
who never did and never will exist.
And there's a bit of satisfaction in knowing that
even the New York Times can be suckered occas
