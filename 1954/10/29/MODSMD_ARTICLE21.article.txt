# Welcome 'New' Parents
## 
### 
We'll see something new at Stanford tomorrow. It's the first
of what may become a series of annual Parents' Days.
Parents of new students have been invited to come to the
campus tomorrow for an all-day program designed to honor the
parents and acquaint them with the University. There'll be a
welcoming assembly, panel discussion, an open house at fresh
man dormitories, campus tours, and a reception. Big plans for
a "new thing."
And those big plans seem to be well justified. More than 800
parents have accepted invitations to come. They'll be coming
from New York, Chicago, and San Antonio as well as from near
by towns. A tentative offer by the University to get tickets to
the Washington State College football game for the guests
brought hundreds of ticket requests.
So it looks like this is a "new thing" with a bright future.
It's certainly a good idea; a plan of this sort is excellent public
relations as the first-year turnout indicates. We're sure a day
such as this will win new friends fend confirm old ones for Stan
ford.
To more than 800 parents of new students—welcome! We're
sure you'll like what you see at Stanford.
