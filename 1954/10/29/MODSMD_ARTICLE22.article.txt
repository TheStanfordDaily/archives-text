A 'NEW LOW'
To the Editor:
Congratulations—you have hit a new low in political editorials. When
you start defending the Truman administration in general and his sloppy
security techniques in particular, you are not only ignoring the objectivity
of evidence but also, like so many unthinking Americans today, you are
putting your head in the sand and letting pure emotionalism rule your
thinking and your writing.
If you really think that Mr. Nixon meant that the Democratic party stands
for "tragedy and treason," you have completely missed the boat, us well
as ignoring the tendency which has been in evidence in the Democratic
party since F.D.R. towards government control and socialism.
LENNARD LIVINGSTON
ON CONGRESSMAN YORTY
: To the Editor:
In Monday's Daily you were gracious enough to publish a letter at
tacking your editorial views on Senator Kuchel. Tht> writer, Will Jourdin,
attacked Senator Kuchel's record as "dreary, dismal, and depressing."
He states that "today our President needs the greatest freedom in execut
ing our foreign policy," and that, in order to "support our President in
fashioning a strong and wise domestic and foreign policy," we should elect
Sam Yorty to the Senate and "send the junior senator back to Anaheim."
In support of his judgment of Senator Kuchel, Mr. Jourdin cites four
instances in which Senator Kuchel voted against President Eisenhower's
program and policy. The logical question is, then, what Mr. Yorty did to
indicate that he is a better supporter of the Eisenhower program?
Mr. Yorty hardly ever entered a House debate on any national issue, but
he preferred simply to have his views put into the Appendix to the
Congressional Record. Here, then, we find that he: -
1. Attacked the President's Highway Program (H.R. 8127) as inade
quate. (Cong. Rec. 100, A1695).
2. Advocated increased personal exemptions for income-tax purposes, j
which the President and his supporters fought tooth and nail. (Cong. |
Rec. 100, A160G, A3863).
3. Attacked the President's farm program as "ineffective." (Cong. Rec.
100, A2346).
4. Attacked the social security program amendments passed by the 83rd
Congress as "piece-meal" and "stop-gap." (Cong. Rec., AGG44.)
The question I wish to ask Mr. Jourdin and all those who voice similar
opinions (and there are quite a few) is: just how do we help the Presi
dent by sending Mr. Yorty to Washington as a senator? In what way can
we be certain that Mr. Yorty would support the President more than a
Republican senator?
I think the answer, is obvious. I believe that the manner of supporting
a Republican President is not to send to Washington a Democratic senator.
It is to elect such men as are of the same basic opinions as the man whom
we all wish to support, men of the same party that President Eisenhower
chose to join.

A THANK YOU'
To the Editor
We would like to offer a brief "thank you" to the editorial staff for
your current policy. Now that election time is drawing near, it is grati
fying to read your observations, opinions and criticisms on political issues.
For agree with them or not, they give us another view to evaluate, cause
for more thought, and ye-examination of the facts.
We particularly commend the recent editorials on Governor Knight's
.failure to proclaim U.N. Day, the McCarthyistic campaigning tactics of
our Vice-President, and the summary of the achievements of the 83rd
Congress. We are looking forward to the next editorial.

KOREA ... A LIABILITY
To the Editor:
The editorials appearing in the Daily during recent weeks have in gen
eral been written from but one side of the political fence. Many of these
views have been in need of an answer, but few have needed it quite so
badly as the recent "We've Heard Enough." ,
It is stated that Mr. Truman did not "cover up and clear the communists
and security risks" as Mr. Nixon says he did. How else, then, are we to
describe the cases of Harry Dexter White, Alger Hiss, Harold Glasser,
Judith Coplon, Owen Lattimore, and the rest of the gang?
Even most Democrats do not truly believe that an effective security pro
gram existed during the Truman administration. It was a Republican
Congress which began a cleanup of this mess from 1950-52 and a Re
publican administration which has continued it. The Truman adminis
tration did nothing to foster such a cleanup. "Red Herring" was the best
assistance Mr. Truman could offer. Every thorn was thrown in the path i
of Congressional investigation.
Korea was hardly a "united action to stop communism." With the ex
ception of South Korea the United States was virtually alone in Korea
and millions of Americans, including General MacArthur, felt that it was
absurdly stupid of our leaders in Washington to allow our enemy, the
same enemy slaughtering our soldiers, to have a protected sanctuary be- j
yond the Yalu River. Korea is no feather in the cap of the Democrats and
the Truman-Acheson Regime—it is a liability to them, as it should be,
for Korea was the result of a series of Democratic blunders.
Yes, "Korea, corruption, and communism," are still the issues in this
campaign as Mr. Nixon says they are. And no one can overlook the great
achievements of the Eisenhower administration —clean government, a re
storing of dignity to the White House, a solid security program, a thorough
housecleaning, and now the shining London Agreement, an achievement
unmatched in American diplomatic history during the last 30 years.

WHY ALL TIIE KNEES?
! To the Editor:
Where did all the knees exposed two inches above and two inches be
low come from? What is this Bermuda short plague? Bermuda shorts
to parties, Bermuda shorts to breakfast, Bermuda shorts to Row Carnival,
Bermuda shorts to football games, Bermuda shorts for Saturday.
Does someone's father own a Bermuda short factory? Did the stores in
Paly overstock?
And why hasn't someone thought of an abbreviation for them. Wo have
Mem Aud, RBR, Quad, why not "mudas" or "Bermshors?"
Finally, if we have to have them why don't we go all out'.' Declare
Stanford an isle where cars are prohibited and reserved for those that
have knees that like to show.
