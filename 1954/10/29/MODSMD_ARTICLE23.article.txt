# What 'Doom and Gloom'?
## 
### 
Adlai Stevenson's admission earlier this
week that he had sold a large part of his com
mon stock holdings "much to my regret" makes
us wonder what has happened to the prophe
sies of economic disaster which the Democrats
proclaimed so loudly prior to Pre§idant Eisen
hower's sweeping victory just two short years
ago.
In 1952 the Democrats repeatedly discounted
Eisenhower's promisQS of peace with prosper
ity, and warned that another depression would
be the inevitable result of a Republican victory.
Nov/, Stevenson has made a complete about
face and admits that he would be "a great deal
better off" if he had not sold his stocks.
Although Mr. Stevenson's statement is note
worthy, there are many other aspects of the
present economic situation which are even
more significant in the sudden silence of the
Democratic prophets of gloom.
Statistics released last week show that the
average earnings of American workers rose to
$71.86 last month, an all-time high for Septem
ber. Sixty-two million Americans are em
ployed today at the highest wages ever paid
in peacetime history.
The Democratic scare tactics of 1952 have
obviously fallen flat as voters realize that the
20 years of Roosevelt-Truman rule resulted in
what amounted to a cycle of prosperity, infla
tion, and recession, as the country moved in
and out of war. During those 20 years, unem

ployment averaged over nine per cent of our
workers—twice what it is today.
Although unemployment during the 1950
Truman administration was above 4 million,
the Republicans clearly do not agree with Tru
man's statement at that time that "a certain
amount of unemployment—say from three to
five million —is supportable." They realize
that with an estimated 2,740,000 out of work to
day, the situation is serious, and they are do
ing everything possible to reduce that figure.
Striving for sound money and a stable econ
omy, President Eisenhower is also making de
termined efforts to curtail government spend
ing and reduce the budgetary deficit. Reduc
tion in the cost of running the government has
been achieved by retracting the Democrats'
over-extended activities and by increasing gov
ernment efficiency.
Administration policies have clearly been ef
fective in halting the rapid rise in the cost of
living and in stabilizing the value of the dollar.
In the face of these Republican accomplish
ments, it is easy to see why the Democrats
have so conveniently dropped the present eco
nomic situation as one of the major issues of
this campaign.
Such a thorough refuting of Democratic
charges and predictions makes us wonder just
how effective that party's campaign oratory
will prove to be when the voters go to the
polls next Tuesday.—W.W.

fective in halting the rapid rise in the cost of
living and in stabilizing the value of the dollar.
In the face of these Republican accomplish
ments, it is easy to see why the Democrats
have so conveniently dropped the present eco
nomic situation as one of the major issues of
this campaign.
Such a thorough refuting of Democratic
charges and predictions makes us wonder just
how effective that party's campaign oratory
will prove to be when the voters go to the
polls next Tuesday.—W.W.

Adlai Stevenson's admission earlier this
week that he had sold a large part of his com
mon stock holdings "much to my regret" makes
us wonder what has happened to the prophe
sies of economic disaster which the Democrats
proclaimed so loudly prior to Pre§idant Eisen
hower's sweeping victory just two short years
ago.
In 1952 the Democrats repeatedly discounted
Eisenhower's promisQS of peace with prosper
ity, and warned that another depression would
be the inevitable result of a Republican victory.
Nov/, Stevenson has made a complete about
face and admits that he would be "a great deal
better off" if he had not sold his stocks.
Although Mr. Stevenson's statement is note
worthy, there are many other aspects of the
present economic situation which are even
more significant in the sudden silence of the
Democratic prophets of gloom.
Statistics released last week show that the
average earnings of American workers rose to
$71.86 last month, an all-time high for Septem
ber. Sixty-two million Americans are em
ployed today at the highest wages ever paid
in peacetime history.
The Democratic scare tactics of 1952 have
obviously fallen flat as voters realize that the
20 years of Roosevelt-Truman rule resulted in
what amounted to a cycle of prosperity, infla
tion, and recession, as the country moved in
and out of war. During those 20 years, unem

ployment averaged over nine per cent of our
workers—twice what it is today.
Although unemployment during the 1950
Truman administration was above 4 million,
the Republicans clearly do not agree with Tru
man's statement at that time that "a certain
amount of unemployment—say from three to
five million —is supportable." They realize
that with an estimated 2,740,000 out of work to
day, the situation is serious, and they are do
ing everything possible to reduce that figure.
Striving for sound money and a stable econ
omy, President Eisenhower is also making de
termined efforts to curtail government spend
ing and reduce the budgetary deficit. Reduc
tion in the cost of running the government has
been achieved by retracting the Democrats'
over-extended activities and by increasing gov
ernment efficiency.
Administration policies have clearly been ef
fective in halting the rapid rise in the cost of
living and in stabilizing the value of the dollar.
