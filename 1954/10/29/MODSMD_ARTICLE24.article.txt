i behind the Democratic program of
! full parity payments.

i units of housing during the next
four years. However, the bill that
reached Congress called for only
j 35.000 units din ing this period. Ku
| chel voted.for this measure. Yorty
j voted to recommit the bill with in-'
j stryctions to raise the number of
| units back to the 140,000 that the
' President, had requested.

i The new tax bill is another issue

Lo the Vice Presidency.

i« Sam Yorty, who is finishing out
his second term in the House of Rep
resentatives.
Here is a brief rundown of their
viewpoints on some of the major

bills that came up before Congress
during the past two years.
The Bricker Amendment to limit
the President's treaty-making pow
ers was supported by Kuchel. Ei
senhower spoke out very strongly
against this bill on the grounds that
it would tie the hands of the State
Department. The measure did not
come up in the House, so Yorty did
not vote on this controversial issue.
In the field of reciprocal trade
Eisenhower called' for a measure
! which would extend the Trade
j Agreements Act for three years.
! Kuchel voted against this, while
I Yorty missed the roll call in the
House. The President's proposal was
defeated and a compromise bill ex
tending the Act for one year was
passed. Kuchel voted for the com
promise version.
Both Senator Kuchel and Repre
sentative Yorty voted for U.S. par
ticipation in the St. Lawrence Sea
way project which was called for
by the President.
The two candidates also agreed
with the President on the subject
of foreign aid and voted for an au
thorization of $2.7 billion for the
Mutual Security Program in the
coming year.
On domestic issues Kuchel and
Yorty split on the question of farm
subsidy levels. The Senator backs
J the administration in its call for
: flexible supports, while Yorty stands
i behind the Democratic program of
! full parity payments.
The two also split on the public
housing issue. Eisenhower called
upon Congress to authorize 140.000
i units of housing during the next
four years. However, the bill that
reached Congress called for only
j 35.000 units din ing this period. Ku
| chel voted.for this measure. Yorty
j voted to recommit the bill with in-'
j stryctions to raise the number of
| units back to the 140,000 that the
' President, had requested.

i The new tax bill is another issue
; on which the candidates are split.
Kuchel backed the President's pro
gram. but Yorty stood firm with the
Democrats in their call for increased
personal exemptions from $600 to
$700.
Both voted favorably from the ad-
I ministration's point of view on the
Tidetands Oil Bill. Both were count-

Ed as being for the proposal which
turned over the vast oil resources
lying off the California coastline to
the state.
On the new Social Security Act,
the main difference between the
two was in the vote to establish na
tionwide standards for the amount
and duration of unemployment ben
efits. Kuchel voted against this.
Yortv favored it.
