# Netherlands Student, Nico Scholten, Impressed by Stanford Social Life
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
"A great paradox — absolute
personal freedom and yet set
regulations."
This was ASSU Foreign Schol
ar Nico Scholtens' concise de
scription of Stanford life—a life
which he said differs so much
from that of the State University
of Leiden in Holland where he
studied prior to his arrival at
Stanford.
"The terrific difference," he point
ed out, "lies in the fact that Stan
ford is concerned with the social
welfare of the student. This is part
of the spirit of co-operation to which
an American student is made to con
form from early life.
"At the University of Leiden
there is a much freer atmosphere
in that there are few social regula
tions." He went on to explain that
there is no campus life as such since
the university consists of only build
ings and all students must live of!
campus.
Another difference he pointed out
was that one goes to a university in
Holland for specialized study; high
schools have already prepared him
with a good broad background.
"This system tends to take longer,

but also makes for a more scholarly
type of individual," he reasoned.
"Students in the Netherlands," he
stated, "possess a very great politi
cal consciousness, though not in the
sense of standing on tables and
shouting. It is more a sense of po
litical awareness arising from great
readership of national and interna
tional newspapers and magazines."
Scholtens, who' is near completion
of his law studies at the Dutch uni
versity, is seeking to absorb from
Stanford all he can of what he terms
"Americana," or the American way
of life.
At the University of Leiden, he

served as an administrator of "Green
Time," a period of initiation imposed
on freshman men—basically similar
to the fraternity "Hell Week" here.
He also worked with a student
organization which provided for the
transportation of American students
to Holland, and represented the
Dutch group at an international
conference in England.
Then, turning to an issue vital to
every free European nation, he ob
served that German rearmament is
greeted by the Dutch with mixed
feelings. "Rearmament is a neces
sity, but you must realize that we
had the Germans at our doorstep for
five years.
"We must count ofl some of the
past or we will never achieve any
success, since Germany is the big
gest industrial nation in Europe and
Holland is to some extent economi
cally dependent on her."
In regard to his nation's loss of
Indonesia after the war, Scholtens
sensed that "in many quarters there
is the feeling that action of the gov
ernment was weak and that the
United States had not taken enough
interest in the situation, which it will
regret, since the new Indonesian
government has come under a de
gree of Communism."
"The economic effect was not felt
as much as was expected, though,"
he added.
"We were fully prepared to give
them independence slowly but in
fluence from Britain and the United
States has made things go wrong, I
am afraid to say."
"Although I won't say that the
Dutch love the Americans, there is a
general sense of goodwill toward the
United States," he went on to say.

"We recognize American world lead
ership and do not resent it as the
French do.
"Of course, there is the usual be
wilderment about American fastness
and know-how."
As to the problem of Communists
in government, Scholtcns pondered
the matter a bit, and then remarked
that he believed Americans were
"unduly preoccupied" with the issue.
"Holland," he said, "is more cynical,
more realistic, in its approach."
"What we need," he added, "is a
strong Europe aided and backed by
the United States."
