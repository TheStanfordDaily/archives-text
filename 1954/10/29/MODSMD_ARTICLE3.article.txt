# Law Faculty Team Bows, But Not Without Protest
## 
### JOHN FLYNN 
With cries of "ringer" and "blast |
the thieving scoundrels," an aged
but lighting Law Faculty golf team
went down to a one-point defeat at
the hands of a suspiciously profes
: ional Medical School aggregation
yesterday at the Stanford course.
Immediately following the match, j
several heated protests were regis
tered by the irate lawyers with the i
POA the AAU. two gardeners, and
a number of mildly interested pass- j
ers-by. Reading from a prepared j
statement, Law Dean Carl B. Spaeth
accused his medical brothers of us- {
ing a ringer, and deliberate delay so ,
that certain key members of his
team would contract a chill.
At «i post-game gathering of the i
teams in the Spaeth home, feeling I
ran Jiigh. The winners were pre
sented with a silver cup earned by j
Dean Spaeth several seasons ago
which is to be engraved by the '

holders and offered as a perpetual
prize in succeeding contests.
Dr. G. B. Robson. Associate Dean
of the Medical School, goodnaturedly
commented that "the Law School
tried hard, but, as usual, class told."
Law team captain Phil Neal ob
served only that "the Medical School
team all had caddies, while the law
yers carried their own clubs. This
is a significant social fact.'"
Although threatening glances were
exchanged at the presentation cere
monies, there was no violence. Dean
Spaeth announced that an investi
gating committee had been appoint
ed to look into the eligibility of Dr.
Peter Jones. "Who has ever heard
of a PROFESSOR Peter Jones?" he
asked.
In handing over the cup Professor
Neal noted that "this is the only
kind of cup Dean Spaeth would de
vote to such a useless purpose. This
is a very small cup."
