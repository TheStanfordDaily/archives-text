# INDONESIA:
## IIR Members Hear Consul-General 
### EDA MENDELS 
"Indonesia follows a course of active independence, not neu
trality."
So characterized Abdole Hamid, Consul-General of Indonesia
in San Francisco, the position of his country in a speech he de
iivered yesterday in Bowman Alumni House. The meeting war

sponsored by the Institute of Inter
national Relations.
Ilamid elaborated that neutrality
meant indifference. Indonesia, he
j pointed out, is active in the pursuit
oi peace in th ? worM. Economically
it is dependent on others and po
l litically it is weak, but .the country's
! moral strength is concentrated on
j peace.
Indonesia is of interest to the
j Western world because of its stra
| tegic position in Southeast Asia,
j between two oceans. The country
j is composed of 3,000 islands and has
a population of 80 million people.
The consul said that Indonesia has
been called "naively idealistic" for
its independent position. "It fights
with one bloc on one issue, on an
other issue with the other bloc, and
thus has the protection of neither.
This position other nations find "po
| litically unrealistic."
In answer to a question, Hamid
explained that Indonesia had not
joined the Southeast Asian Treaty
Organization because this would in
crease world tension and thus go
against the quest of peace.
Economic problems figure largely
in the difficulties which beset the

young republic. The standard of liv
ing is very low. The food supply
needs augmentation, for home use
and for export. The economy is stil
largely agricultural, though small in
dustry is developing.
Hamid told of the wealth of hi;
country's resources, which arc
scarcely exploited. Foreign capita
is required to develop these assets
Indonesia's oil supplies are the only
ones in that part of the world.
Hamid was asked whether many
Indonesian students went abroad to
study. He replied that the shortage
of educated men was so great that
the country could not miss them for
extended study, but the men in spe
cific jobs were often sent abroad for
a year to get special training.
The country is trying to escape
Dutch influence, now that Indonesia
has its independence after 350 years
as a Dutch colonial subject, but be
cause Dutch is a familiar language,
a majority of the students Still go
to Holland for advanced studies.
Indonesia's first general election is
scheduled for next year. Then the
job of registering the inhabitants
will have been completed.
