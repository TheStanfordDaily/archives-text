# WSC Is Northern Power, But Ineffective in South
## 
### 
Washington State, considered a breather team by most Cali
fornians, is a paradox in the PCC. lust as regularly as the Cougars
drop contests to the California schools, they whip their Northern
opponents. ,
During the last four years WSC has won 13, lost three, and tied

one against Washington, Idaho, and
»he two Oregons. A 20-20 tie with
USC in 1950 is the Cougars' best
effort against a southern team,
though, as they have dropped 11
tilts in the same period.
Against Stanford they have scored
five victories against eight defeats.
The last time the Cards dropped a
ontest to the Cougars was the 1948
game at Pullman, when the Jinx of
the Palouse prevailed by a 14-7
count. Since that time Stanford has
racked up four straight victories.
Last year saw the biggest Stanford
margin as Bob Garrett led his mates
to a 48-19 trouncing of WSC. The
highlight of the game came on a
fourth-down situation. Stanford, af
ter several penalties and losses, had
the ball on the Cougar 48 with goal
to go. Garrett, ignoring the punting
situation, faded back and threw to
John Steinberg for a touchdown.
The Cougars' last conference

championship was in 1930 when they
went through nine games unbeaten,
but Washington State's claim to
gridiron fame lies not in its own won
and lost records.
Washington State has sent more
players, who have become stars,
into pro ball than any other school
of comparable size. From that 1930
team came such professional stal
warts as Mel Hein, an all-time, all
pro center who played many seasons
for the New York Giants, Turk Ed
wards, and George Hurley.
Ed Goddard was another pre-war
player who made -a name in play
for-pay game. ' Since the war Lauri
