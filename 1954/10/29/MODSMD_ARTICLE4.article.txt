# Excom Discusses NSA, Concerts, and Elections
## 
### 
All future benefit concerts at Stanford will be presented under
the supervision of the Concert Series manager and his assistants
without compensation, the Executive Committee decided Wed
nesday night.
Although the ASSU Constitution bylaws specify that the Concert
Series manager shall have "general*

supervision of all concerts put on
under the; auspices of the ASSU,"
this provision has generally been dis
regarded in the staging of benefit
concerts. The case in point is the
recent King's Men concert, which
was run under ASSU auspices by
the Institute of International Rela
tions.
Following this concert, the Con
cert Scries Board called the bylaw
to Excom's attention, offering to
handle future benefit concerts with
out pay, and this was incorporated
into the bylaws at the Wednesday
night meeting.
A 1 Loomis and Steve Voykovich
spoke to Excom on NSA. Excom

will vote on the question of Stan
ford's membership in the national
student organization within the next
few weeks. Voykovich's motion for
consideration of the issue on Nov. 10
was carried, but the vote may come
before that time.
Dave Jenks questioned the effect
iveness of NSA after-dinner speak
ers at Stanford recently. Loomis,
who is NSA coordinator at Stanford,
cited the time limit of 5 to 10 min
utes per speaker as a serious re
striction on the speakers.
Jack Tracy and Carol Gevurtz
were named to Excom's Election
Judgment Committee, which must
pass on the validity of the forth
coming ASSU elections.
Several bylaw changes in regard
to elections were passed at the meet
ing. Several of these merely adapted
the bylaws to the newly-instituted
preferential voting system at Stan
ford.
There will be a primary election
for Men's and Women's Council po
sitions, with candidates numbering
twice the number of positions to be
filled to appear on the final ballot.
In case of-ties in primary elections,
when the top two candidates cannot
be determined, the top three candi
dates will be placed on the final
ballot. If in this case there is no
majority among the three in the
final, or if in any case there is a tie
in the final, a runoff or revote shall
be held as soon as possible.
