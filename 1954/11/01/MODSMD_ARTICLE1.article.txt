# Nixon: War, Hard Times If Demo Congress Elected
## Three-Point Policy Cited 
### DON WEBSTER 
In a nationally televised
spcech Friday night, Vice-Presi
dent Richard Nixon told a Bay
Area audience that election of
an anti-Eisenhower Democratic
Congress would mean a return
to policies of "war, corruption,
and hard times."
After the televised portion of the
program had ended, Nixon lambasted
a heckler who had shouted during
the telecast: ''Tell us a dog story,
Dick!"
Nixon's speech—his last in Cali
fornia — hammered away at three
themes: success of the Republican"
foreign policy, the drive to clean
subversives and security risks out of
government, and the lack of recession
in peacetime.
The greatest responsibility the gov
ernment has in an atomic age is to
keep the peace," he said. "If we
don't, domestic problems won't make
much difference, for we won't be
around to look for solutions.
"By January, 1953, the United
States had spent billions of dollars
for foreign aid and defense, but we
were not strong enough to meet the
threat of communism anywhere in
i.he world.
"Under the Republican adminis
tration, the war has been ended, and
for the first time in 15 years, the
world is at peace.
"Truman-Acheson got us into war,
but Eisenhower-Dulles has kept us
out."
TIIREE - POINT PROG RAM
Nixon cited a three-point program
the Republicans had been invoking
to reduce government corruption.
"We're enforcing existing laws, pass
ing new ones to make the penalty fit
the treachery of the crime.
"It is significant that Stevenson
and Mitchcll still pooh-pooh the
danger of Communism," he said.
The Vice-President mentioned a
recent statement by Adlai Stevenson
which said in the field of foreign
policy the Eisenhower administration
is guilty of "mismanagement
amounting to genius."
"Adlai may think it's funny, but
the people don't," Nixon commented.
"Statements such as this prove that
34 million voters were right when
they said he wasn't fit to be presi
dent."
HECKLER'S REMARK
The heckler's remark came in the
middle of Nixon's words on unem
ployment. It was picked up by tele
vision microphones. At the end of
the speech Secret Service men start
ed to evict him. Nixon told them,
"Bring him back. I want him to hear
what I have to say."
"This man has asked for a dog
story and I'll tell him a dog story.
Before the Korean War there were
some 5 million unemployed. That's
over one-and-a-half million more
than are out of jobs today. In an
interview with Arthur Krock of the
New York Times, Truman said that
wc need 5 million unemployed be
cause they must move from place to
place to have an expanding econ
omy."
Nixon said the Republicans realize
that high employment in peacetime
is a difficult thing. "Wc don't try to
make unemployment a political issue
and wc don't believe in the philoso
phy of war to make employment."
The heckler, James Heavcy, was
involved in a scuffle with several of
the agents and angry bystanders
when they tried to get him to leave.

Nixon cited a three-point program

The Vice-President mentioned a
recent statement by Adlai Stevenson
which said in the field of foreign
policy the Eisenhower administration

"Adlai may think it's funny, but
the people don't," Nixon commented.
"Statements such as this prove that

HECKLER'S REMARK
The heckler's remark came in the
middle of Nixon's words on unem
ployment. It was picked up by tele
vision microphones. At the end of
the speech Secret Service men start
ed to evict him. Nixon told them,
"Bring him back. I want him to hear
what I have to say."
"This man has asked for a dog
story and I'll tell him a dog story.
Before the Korean War there were
some 5 million unemployed. That's
over one-and-a-half million more
than are out of jobs today. In an
interview with Arthur Krock of the
New York Times, Truman said that
wc need 5 million unemployed be
cause they must move from place to
place to have an expanding econ
omy."
Nixon said the Republicans realize
that high employment in peacetime
is a difficult thing. "Wc don't try to
make unemployment a political issue
and wc don't believe in the philoso
phy of war to make employment."
The heckler, James Heavcy, was
involved in a scuffle with several of
the agents and angry bystanders
when they tried to get him to leave.

In a nationally televised
spcech Friday night, Vice-Presi
dent Richard Nixon told a Bay
Area audience that election of
an anti-Eisenhower Democratic
Congress would mean a return
to policies of "war, corruption,
and hard times."
After the televised portion of the
program had ended, Nixon lambasted
a heckler who had shouted during
the telecast: ''Tell us a dog story,
Dick!"
Nixon's speech—his last in Cali
fornia — hammered away at three
themes: success of the Republican"
foreign policy, the drive to clean
subversives and security risks out of
government, and the lack of recession
in peacetime.
The greatest responsibility the gov
ernment has in an atomic age is to
keep the peace," he said. "If we
don't, domestic problems won't make
much difference, for we won't be
around to look for solutions.
"By January, 1953, the United
States had spent billions of dollars
for foreign aid and defense, but we
were not strong enough to meet the
threat of communism anywhere in
i.he world.
