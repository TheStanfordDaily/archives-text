## An Effective Appeal 
### 
President Eisenhower's dramatic and un
precedented "chain phone call" plan which
began with telephone pleas to 10 typical Am
erican voters over the weekend should con
vince every Republican and Democrat in the
country of the importance of going to the polls
tomorrow.
Talking informally with 10 voters from all
parts of the country, the President urged them
to vote, and to carry the program forward by
in turn calling 10 of their friends in "chain
letter" fashion and asking them to do likewise.
The ten times-ten telephone campaign will
be, we leel, effective in developing a multi
plication of votes which will reduce the voter

apathy found in off-year elections in the past.
The President's action is especially justified by
the importance of the many issues which will
be decided tomorrow. It is further justified by
the extremely close contests expected in many
cases â€” the race for U.S. Senator from Calif
ornia, for example.
Jt is because of these important issues and
because of the closeness of these contests, that
we applaud the President's attempt to get a
larger percentage of the voters to the polls.
A large electorate is certainly the best guar
antee that government of and for the people
will also be government by the people.- W.W.
