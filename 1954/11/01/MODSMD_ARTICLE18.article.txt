## 
### 
(Editor's nolc: The following
lei lit was received by The Daily
front the of!ice of California Gov
ernor Goodwin J. Knight. It came
in reply to a letter sent him ask
ing for further explanation of liis
decision not to declare United Na
lions Day on Oct. 21 and criliciz
iii,'; lite stand he had taken.)
This will acknowledge your
letter of October 28 with refer
ence to United Nations Day. Ol
course, we regret that you are
not in accord with the Govern
or's decision on this matter.
When large numbers of Cali
fornians make reguests of the
Governor, we must accept their
communications in good faith
unless we have prior reasonable
evidence that they are insincere.
Many people asked for the decla
ration ol one occasion; many for a
divergent one. When similar cir
cumstances have arisen in the past,
the Governor has stood aside unless
lie was convinced that his action
could resolve the difficulty.
A courteous reply was sent (o
everyone requesting both United
Nations Day and United Stales Day.
There was no effort nor intent on
our part to embarrass the supporters
ol either viewpoint. News of the
Governor's decision was given to the
newspapers by the recipient of one
of these letters.
I point out that the Governor of
California did not receive an official
request from the President of the
United States for a proclamation in
connection with the date in question.
The United Nations is a feature ol
American foreign policy. The Presi
dent's proclamation had the same
effect in California which it had in
every other state. Since this is pri
marily a matter dealing with the for
ego relations of our nation and the
states are specifically constrained
from acting upon them by the Fed
eral Constitution, the Governor felt
that it would he neither, appropriate
nor useful for him to issue.sueh a
proclamation.
It will be of interest to you to
know that Governor Knight has
joined with San Francisco public
officials and civic groups in inviting
the United Nations General Assem
bly to bold its tenth anniversary ses
sions in that city.
Sincerely,
DOUGLAS BARRETT,
Secretary
