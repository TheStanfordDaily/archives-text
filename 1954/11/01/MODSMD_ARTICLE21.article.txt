# Wastebasket Fire Stirs Encina Men
## 
### 
A wastepaper basket Ore on the
fifth floor of Encina Hail briefly dis
turbed many sleepy-eyed freshmen
at 11:50 p.m. Saturday.
The small blaze in Room 5.")8 was
quickly extinguished by the Stan
ford Fire Department. Freshman
Don Skipworth suffered a slightly
cut right hand when he broke the
alarm box glass to report the fire.
Fire Chief John Marston said that,
the fiue was apparently caused when
Skipworth dropped a match into the
wastepaper basket without extin
guishing it first.
