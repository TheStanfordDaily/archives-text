# Trobabes Capitalize on Breaks To Nip Indian Frosh, 20-19
## Douglas Shreds SC Defense With Passes But Fumbles Hurt 
### BOB DURAND 
"... the team that takes advantage oi the breaks will win."
So commented frosh grid coach Bob Chilotti before Saturday's
clash between the USC and Stanford yearlings.
The Trobabes took advantage ol two breaks in the fourth quar
ter of the game, which was played as a preliminaiy to the varsity

till m tiie Stadium, and thereby
eked out a 20-19 decision over the
Papooses.
With Ghilotli's men holding a 19-
13 lead halfway into the final stanza,
the vi itor ' Bob Rosendahl and
Pete ShuLin blocked a Jack Taylor
punt and their teammate Gene Cosce
fell on the ball two yaru.s from pay
dirt.
Chi the next play, Trobabe half
back Puss flailing swept wide
around right end for the score. The
all-important extra point was added
when Harling passed to Rosendahl
in the end zone.
Itlil.AK NCIWHI'iH TWO
The Card freshmen were not to
be denied, however, and several ball
exchanges later they drove to their
opponents' two-yard line. The stage
was set for break number two. Bill
Patten, outstanding guard of the
visitors, recovered a fumble, and .'54
seconds later the game was over.
For most Indian fans, though, the
final score was overshadowed by the
performance of one Jack Douglas, a
product of the Southland's Santa
Monica High. Douglas merely com
pleted 17 passes out of 25 attempts
for 257 yards, 13 first downs, and one
touchdown.
The former All-CIF quarterback
played almost the entire game and
continually made his presence felt—
on defense as well as offense. Per
haps his only drawback was not be
ing able to spot his receiver and then
being trapped behind the line lor
lost yardage.
FIRST BLOOD
The Papooses drew first blood five
minutes into the first quarter. Half
back Lou Villii ran back a punt 33
yards to the USC 24. and five plays
later Douglas tossed to Valli who
was all alojie in the end zone.
The other two Card scores came
or. marches of K(,i yards in 11 plays
and 58 yards in 10 plays. Gary Van
Galder tallied from one yard out fol
lowing the long march, while Dick
accounted for the other on a two
yard end sweep.
Trobabe quarterback Walt Gor
rell had his hand in the first two
six - pointers for the visitors. He
plunged over from the one late in
the first period, and then passed to
Joe Agapay in the third quarter. Ed
Isherwood converted in one out of
two attempts.
Line play on both elevens was
praiseworthy. Noel Robinson, Russ
Steele, Jim Kroeter, and Joel Freis
lurried in top-rate jobs for the Pa
poose., while Patten, Mike Henry,
Vie Kdelbrook, anil Sliubin paced the
Trojan frosh.


OUT YOU GO Stanford's star freshman quarterback Jack
Douglas shoves Ed Isherwood of the out of bounds on
* the SC 34-yard line. Douglas tossed 17 completions in 25 tries
for 257 yards, but missed conversions and fumbles cost the
Card frosh a 20-19 defeat in their opening game.
