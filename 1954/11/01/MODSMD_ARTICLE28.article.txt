## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
"Anytime we beat a California team, we're happy," said Wash
ington State Coach A 1 Kircher when it was all over Saturday. The
30-26 triumph the Cougars rung up was their first against a south
ern team since 1948. And they were happy.
But Kircher and others in the contingent thought that WSC had

played better ball against Cal, "but
we didn't throw." Kircher thought
j the defense was better against the
| Bears.
Kircher was firm in His opinion
that it was passing, particularly the
j surprise tosses of Bob Miller, which
[ pushed the Cougars over the hump.
I He also felt his players wanted to
I win a lot more than they did against
Idaho the week before.
Kircher thought Stanford and
Washington State had very similar
I personnel young. Ten of the 11
WSC starters will be back next year.
Senior Duke Washington, who
j suffered a severely sprained left
| ankle, will probably he replaced by
| Ray Alvarado from Fremont High in
Los Angeles, a 218 - pound 9.9
| sprinter.
Washington left the field after his
first-half injury to have his ankle
X-rayed. Kircher explained that
: The Duke wasn't in condition to play
J when he came back in the ambu
lance aftei the intermission. He just
I came back to watch.
Among the Stanford players, Kir
! cher was particularly impressed by
! the line work of Jerry Goldberg.
Kircher admitted it was "a long
| afternoon with all those breaks back
and forth;" But he was happy. Until
someohe' 'asked whom the 'Cougars
played next.
Kircher scowled darkly: "Michi-
I gan State, Oregon, and Washington.
I Why spoil a good day?"
