### 
SAN FL'ANCISCO, Oct. 31 (UP) â€”
The last shots in one of California's
hottest election campaigns were fired
todriy.
Governor Goodwin J. Knight,
whose energetic campaign carried
him into almost every one of the
state's 58 counties in the last few
weeks, fired one la t broadside at
his Democratic foe, Richard P.
Graves.
Graves, in return, predicted a
weeping ' Democratic victory two
days hence and said "the day of the
one-party November ballot in Cali
fornia is past.'
California, with a hefty 30 seats
in Congress piu.s the Kuchel contest,
thus becomes nationally important
in next Tuesday's election.
Also at stake in the election are
the offices of Lieutenant Governor,
Treasurer, Controller, Secretary of
State, three seats on the State Board
of Equalization, 80 in the State As
sembly, and 40 in the State Senate.
