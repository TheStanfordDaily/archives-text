# Ike, Nixon Plug GOP
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Beth President Eisenhower
and Vice - President Richard
Nixon spent busy weekends try
ing to help Republican candi
dates win tomorrow's elections.
The President, in Washington,
starting a pyramid phoning
"Vote Republican" movement,
and Nixon continued on his
whirlwind campaign tour.
Eisenhower Saturday mo r n in g
phoned 10 "plain ordinary" persons
around the country. He urged them
to support Republican candidates,
and to each phone 10 other persons,
starting a "pyramid system" aimed at
reaching every citizen who might go
to the polls.
The President had mentioned only
the night before to a Wilmington,
Del., audience that he felt'a heavy
voter turnout would aid the Repub
lican cause. "If. everybody votes,
we're in," he said.
Though the President had just
wound up a 1,400-mile aerial tour of
four key states — Ohio, Michigan,
Kentucky, and Delaware—his trav
els were short compared with those
of the Vice-President.
NIXON CONCLUDES TOUR
Nixon today concludes a tour of
22 states. When he was interviewed
by newspapermen Friday at the San
Francisco Airport, it was the third
time that week he had arrived there.
The Vice - President was asked
what he thought Republican chances
were in the election. He said he be
lieved "those prognosticators who
have said the Republicans will lose
the Congress are out on a limb."
He said they are basing their pre
dictions on voter reaction two weeks
ago. "The same tiling we did in
1948," he commented.
UPSWING TO GOP
But Nixon believes there has been
an upswing toward the GOP in the
last 10 days. He said crowds at
Southern California rallies were
much larger than expected, and that
Republican workers are now dis
playing confidence instead of uncer
tainty.
"The experts underestimated the
number of undecided voters," Nixon
said, "and those voters mean the
difference between a winning and a
losing campaign."
The Vice-President has been in
Oregon the first part of the week,
and flew to Southern California on
Wednesday. He addressed crowds in
the Los Angeles area, including a
Pomona audience Friday morning.
He then flew to the Bay Area,
where he spoke to a San Mateo
crowd. Early Saturday morning
Nixon flew to Spokane, Wash.,
where he spoke Saturday night.
Yesterday he moved to Denver to
prepare for a national TV program,
which will be telecast tonight. Pres
ident Eisenhower will speak from
Washington and Nixon from Denver.
Nixon isn't staying much in Den
ver, though. This morning he trav
els to Cheyenne, Wyo., to speak, and
returns to Denver this afternoon.

Beth President Eisenhower
and Vice - President Richard
Nixon spent busy weekends try
ing to help Republican candi
dates win tomorrow's elections.
The President, in Washington,
starting a pyramid phoning
"Vote Republican" movement,
and Nixon continued on his
whirlwind campaign tour.
Eisenhower Saturday mo r n in g
phoned 10 "plain ordinary" persons
around the country. He urged them
to support Republican candidates,
and to each phone 10 other persons,
starting a "pyramid system" aimed at
reaching every citizen who might go
to the polls.
The President had mentioned only
the night before to a Wilmington,
Del., audience that he felt'a heavy
voter turnout would aid the Repub
lican cause. "If. everybody votes,
we're in," he said.
Though the President had just
wound up a 1,400-mile aerial tour of
four key states — Ohio, Michigan,
Kentucky, and Delaware—his trav
els were short compared with those
of the Vice-President.
NIXON CONCLUDES TOUR
Nixon today concludes a tour of
22 states. When he was interviewed
by newspapermen Friday at the San
Francisco Airport, it was the third
time that week he had arrived there.
The Vice - President was asked
what he thought Republican chances
were in the election. He said he be
lieved "those prognosticators who
have said the Republicans will lose
the Congress are out on a limb."
He said they are basing their pre
dictions on voter reaction two weeks
ago. "The same tiling we did in
1948," he commented.
UPSWING TO GOP
But Nixon believes there has been
an upswing toward the GOP in the
last 10 days. He said crowds at
Southern California rallies were
much larger than expected, and that
Republican workers are now dis
playing confidence instead of uncer
tainty.
"The experts underestimated the
number of undecided voters," Nixon
said, "and those voters mean the
difference between a winning and a
losing campaign."
