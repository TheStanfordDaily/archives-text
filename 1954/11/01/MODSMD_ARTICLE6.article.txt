## Fraternity, Club Men to Visit Frosh 
### 
For the first time, fraternity
and eating club members who
are running for Men's Council
offices may campaign in Encina
and Village freshman dormito
ries.
The Men's Council candidates may
be in the dorms today and tomor
row between 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. to
seek support in the ASSU primary
elections to be held Wednesday and
Thursday.
The candidates must register first
with the Resident Adviser on duty,
and they may not tell the frosh to
what club or fraternity they are af
filiated.
The decision was reached Friday
night by Mrs. Elaine Sumner, di
rector of Encina; Sam Palmer, Men's
Row representative to the Executive
Committee; Fred Aurel, head spon
sor at Encina; and Fred Stern, head
sponsor in the Village.
The committee felt that to allow
only independents to canvass poten
tial voters in the frosh dorms was
an unfair restriction to impose on
the fraternity and eating club men.
The Men's Council candidates will
be permitted in the frosh dorms
under the same arrangements for the
final elections.
The Election Committee has an
nounced the following meetings for
candidates:
Today at 4:15 p.m. all candidates
may meet with incumbents in the
lower lounge of the Women's Club
house.
After dinner in Roble tonight
there will be a meeting of all Wom
en's Council candidates to introduce
them to the freshmen.
Tomorrow is the deadline for
turning in itemized expense ac
counts. Candidates who fail to re
port their expenditures will be rec
ommended for Con Home hours by
the Election Judgment Board. The
$10 limit is the total which may be
spent for both the primary and the
final.
Voting booths will be set up in
front of the Main Library and at
the Village.
