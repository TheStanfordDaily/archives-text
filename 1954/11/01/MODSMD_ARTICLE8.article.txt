# TOO MANY MISTAKES'
## Cougars Manage Upset In Seesaw Clash, 30-26 WSC Passes Wreck Cards 
### BILL NICHOLS 
Washington State 30, Stanford
26.
This was the score in Stan-'
ford's most disappointing foot
ball game of the season. The In
dians' pass defense and tackling
were atrocious and the only
thing that prevented the score
from going higher was that WSC
wasn't any great shakes either.
About the only departments that
offered any consolation to Coach
Chuck Taylor were the work of
sophomore guards Donn Carswoll
and Don Manoukian—and the pa;,
ing attack.
Taylor said following the game
that Carswell played a good game
as did Manoukian before he received
a concussion that forced him out of
action.
Stanford chalked up two touch
downs via the air, and two more on
bootlegs, one of which was set up
by a 29-yard pass from Jerry Gus
tafson to Bill Tarr.
COUGARS TAKE TO AIR
But it was the Cougars, who wex
supposed to move on the ground,
who really did themselves proud in
the passing department. Or perhaps
it would be more correct to say that
the Stanford secondary, trying to*
defend against a previously nori
existent Cougar passing attack, nul
lifiecf the efforts of Gustafson and
Brodie on offense.
The Stanford dressing room aftet
the game was not a cheerful spot
The place was permeated by a spirit
of frustration. Ernie Dorn, who car
ried six times and gained a net of
three yards, sat disconsolately head
in hands, while John Stewart said.
"We just made too many mistake...''
The latter was a pretty common
utterance throughout the aftermath.
Stewart was one of the bright spo ;
for the Cards as he caught six pas:-'
for 128 yards and a touchdown, but
nobody feels good after your team
scores 26 points and still manage:; to
throw the game away.
SCORING RECORD
Those 26 points represent, another
dubious scoring record to be placed
in the books along side the 72 racked
up by UCLA two weeks ago. This
was the highest point total evci
turned in by a losing Stanford team
Taylor, naturally, was very di
couraged. He said, "From the point
of view of mistakes, it was easily
our worst game."
From his point of view, there was
nothing good about the game except
for the aforementioned Carswell and
Manoukian and the work of another
soph, end Bob Gergen, who filled in
for Dick Jones.
Taylor felt Cougar running went,
well because the Card halfbacks
weren't coming up fast on the end
runs. "We had our ends crashing,"
he said, "but they were cut down
and there was nobody else to make


ALMOST, BUT NOT QUITE —Cougar Russ Quackenbush and
Indian Gordy Young leap vainly for a WSC pass thrown by
quarterback Eob Iverson. The ball bounced off the finger tips of
the Cougar wingman and dropped out of the end zone. But WSC
scored moments later in their 30-26 upset over Stanford in the
Stadium Saturday. —Daily photo by Keith Frazier
the stops,"
The reason why the Cougar pass
ing went well? Uyh! Stanford's sec
ondary defenders, notably Bill Tarr
and Dorsey Atkinson, looked like
Cleveland pitchers vvlio had just
served up home run pitches to Dusty
Rhodes, as they watched Cougar
passes lloal over their heads into the
waiting arms of whiteshirted re
ceivers.
SHADES OF SAD SAM
WSC's Frank Sarno hrought back
bitter memory's of last year's USC
game when early in the second
quarter he kicked an 11-yard field
goal to give the Cdugars a brief lti
l.'i lead. It didn't make too much
difference in the final outcome of the
game, however, since the visitors
outbooted the Indians three to two
in the extra point column anyway.
But it gave local spectators a look
at a novel event. It was the first
field ;hj■ 11 i:i the Stadium since 1947
when Mai ty Feldman made one in a
lo- ing l(i- I!) effort against Idaho.
Forgetting last weekend and* look
ing ahead doesn't do too much to
relieve the agony of Card rooters.
Coming up next weekend is USC.
Taylor stated optimistically that the
Trojans could be had, but it would
take an awful lot of hard work by
Stanford to pull i! off.
The injury situation doesn't make
the task any easier. The only se~
i ion. 1 ; injury wa' lo boy Ki ickeberg's
knee, lie probably is out of next
week's game. But Manoukiari and
(Justafson both were banged up
some and the condition of Steve
IJocter is still in doubt.
The road ahead looks very bleak.
