# CAMPAIGN ISSUES ARGUED:
## Party Chairmen Clash In Pre-Election Debate 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 (UP)—The Democratic and Republican
National Chairmen wound up their campaign for Tuesday's Con
gressional elections yesterday with a public quarrel over pros
perity, farm prices and government scandals.
Except for the traditional "non-partisan" election eve get-out-

the vote appeals tonight, the debate
by Democratic Chairman Stephen A.
Mitchell and Republican Chairman
Leonard W. Hall practically brought
to a close the hard-fought campaign
over which party shall control Con
gress during the remaining two
years of the Eisenhower adminis
tration.
The Hall - Mitchell debate over
CBS television was, in effect, a re
view of the issues which the two
parties sought to dramatize.
Hall urged the election of a Re
publican Congress as a vote of con
fidence in the record of the Eisen
hower administration during its first
two years in office. He listed, among
other things, the end of the war in
Korea, tax relief, budget cuts, and
"the two most prosperous years in
the nation's history."
Mitchell countered that the budget
cuts endangered national security,
the tax relief went to the rich in
stead of the poor, and that "pros
perity" is not actually keeping pace
with the growth of the nation.
They also brought in(n the cam
paign the controversial question of
whether Senator Joseph R. McCar
thy (R., Wis.) "abused" Brig. Gen.
Ralph W. Zwicker in the course of
his anti - Communist investigations,
and former President Truman's fir
ing of General Douglas Mac Arthur.
Mitchell promised that a Demo
cratic Congress would not "brow
brat and harass a general ... as
Senator McCarthy has done."
Hall said that when they speak of
generals be wanted to recall that
"one of our greatest, General Mac-
Arthur, was fired in the middle of
the night by Mr. Truman."
The debate ended with Hall ap
pealing for "the .biggest vote in the
history of non - Presidential elec
tions."
The election-eve schedule tomor
row calls for a Republican broadcast,
featuring Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon from Denver and President
Eisenhower from Washington, on
CBS television from fi to 6:30 p.m.
(PST), and Adlai E. Stevenson, the
1952 Democratic Presidential nomi
nee, on CBS radio from 7:15 to 7:30
p.m. (PST).
After that it is up to the voters.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 (UP)—The Democratic and Republican
National Chairmen wound up their campaign for Tuesday's Con
gressional elections yesterday with a public quarrel over pros
perity, farm prices and government scandals.
Except for the traditional "non-partisan" election eve get-out-

the vote appeals tonight, the debate
by Democratic Chairman Stephen A.
Mitchell and Republican Chairman
Leonard W. Hall practically brought
to a close the hard-fought campaign
over which party shall control Con
gress during the remaining two
years of the Eisenhower adminis
tration.
The Hall - Mitchell debate over
CBS television was, in effect, a re
view of the issues which the two
parties sought to dramatize.
Hall urged the election of a Re
publican Congress as a vote of con
fidence in the record of the Eisen
hower administration during its first
two years in office. He listed, among
other things, the end of the war in
Korea, tax relief, budget cuts, and
"the two most prosperous years in
the nation's history."
Mitchell countered that the budget
cuts endangered national security,
the tax relief went to the rich in
stead of the poor, and that "pros
perity" is not actually keeping pace
with the growth of the nation.
They also brought in(n the cam
paign the controversial question of
whether Senator Joseph R. McCar
thy (R., Wis.) "abused" Brig. Gen.
Ralph W. Zwicker in the course of
his anti - Communist investigations,
and former President Truman's fir
ing of General Douglas Mac Arthur.
Mitchell promised that a Demo
cratic Congress would not "brow
brat and harass a general ... as
Senator McCarthy has done."
Hall said that when they speak of
generals be wanted to recall that
"one of our greatest, General Mac-
Arthur, was fired in the middle of
the night by Mr. Truman."
The debate ended with Hall ap
pealing for "the .biggest vote in the
history of non - Presidential elec
tions."
The election-eve schedule tomor
row calls for a Republican broadcast,
featuring Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon from Denver and President
Eisenhower from Washington, on
CBS television from fi to 6:30 p.m.
(PST), and Adlai E. Stevenson, the
1952 Democratic Presidential nomi
nee, on CBS radio from 7:15 to 7:30
p.m. (PST).
After that it is up to the voters.
