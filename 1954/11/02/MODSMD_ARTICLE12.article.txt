WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 (UP)
— Republican and Democratic
leaders, seeking a key to con
trol of the next Senate and
House of Representatives, will
keep a close watch tomorrow on
early returns from "marginal"
districts.
There are 75 to 80 such toss-up
districts—which sometimes go Re
publican and sometimes go Demo
cratic—that could give either politi
cal party control of the House. They
are scattered all the way from Mas
sachusetts to California.
SENATE CONTESTED
Control of the Senate is also at
stake. Democratic leaders predicted
today they can gain control by win
ning Republican-held seats in Ken
tucky, New Jersey, Wyoming, and
Nevada in tomorrow's election. If
they hold what they already have,
that would give them 50 of the 96
Senate seats.
The present Senate lineup is 49
Republicans, 46 Democrats, and in
dependent Senator Wayne Morse of
Oregoil. Morse has said he will vote
with the Democrats if the election
results in a tie lineup. Thirty-seven
Senate seats are at stake in 34 states.
Fifteen of the seats are held by Re
publicans and 22 by Democrats.
BATTLEGROUNDS LISTED
The real battlegrounds, as far as
House control is concerned, are in
the populous states of California,
Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio,
Massachusetts, Illinois, and Michi
gan.
A sweep, of the marginal districts,
hardly likely, would give the win
ning party a healthy majority in the
435-member House. A bare majority
in the House is 218, exactly the
number of Republicans serving
when the 83rd Congress quit two
months ago.
The marginal districts take on
added significance this year because
the last House was so closely di
vided. It had 218 Republicans, 212
Democrats, one independent, and
four vacancies.
