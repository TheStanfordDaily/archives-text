the Republicans have failed to
earn a renewal of the voters' man

in politics by trying to divide the
nation.
Stevenson wound up the hardest
hitting campaign of his political ca

over a CBS radio network.
He charged the Republicans were

harshest criticism, saying:
"Tonight, I have even heard the
Vice-President of the United States,

Stevenson labored over his speech
for seven hours and at the last mo

Nixon, who appeared a few minutes

Stevenson said in his blast at the

the votes of Americans tomorrow
because of the leadership of ob

the United States at home and
abroad.
He said a Democratic Congress
would more closely unite the U.S.

NEW YORK, Nov. 1 (UP)—Ad
lai E. Stevenson, whose 1956
presidential chances may de
pend on the outcome of tomor
row's elections, charged tonight
the Republicans have failed to
earn a renewal of the voters' man
date and have reached "new depths"
in politics by trying to divide the
nation.
Stevenson wound up the hardest
hitting campaign of his political ca
reer with a sharply critical 15-min
ute speech broadcast to the nation
over a CBS radio network.
He charged the Republicans were
"disloyal to the deepest traditions of
constitutional democracy" with a
political campaign of .denunciation
and smear.
CRITICIZES NIXON
Stevenson singled out Vice-Presi
dent Richard M. Nixon for his
harshest criticism, saying:
"Tonight, I have even heard the
Vice-President of the United States,
who not long ago was for sending
American boys to fight in Indo
china, claim that peace in the world
is an achievement of the Eisenhower
administration.
"We are, I fear, reaching new
depths in the pursuit of office. But

hardship. But who can truthfully
say that this is 'peace' when there
are 3,500,000 men under arms, and
our government spends more for de
fense today than we were spending
at the height of the Korean war?"
BLASTS GOP
Stevenson labored over his speech
for seven hours and at the last mo
ment inserted his remark about
Nixon, who appeared a few minutes
earlier on a nationwide Republican
program. Also not included in the
Stevenson t,ext was an interlude in
which Averell Harriman, Democratic
candidate for Governor of New
York, appeared.
Stevenson said in his blast at the
GOP that its candidates do not merit
the votes of Americans tomorrow
because of the leadership of ob
structionists who had embarrassed
the United States at home and
abroad.
He said a Democratic Congress
would more closely unite the U.S.
and its allies, remove the GOP "ob
structionists," give all Americans
equal economic consideration, and
revise laws to increase foreign trade.
