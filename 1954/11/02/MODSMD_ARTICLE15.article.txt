# Ike Asks Nation For Heavy Vote

### 
V/ASHINGTON, Nov. 1 (UP)
—President Eisenhower wound
up the angry Congressional
election campaign tonight, with
a new "get out the vote" tele
phone appeal.
Mr. Eisenhower, following Vice-
President Richard M. Nixon on a
special GOP television half-hour,
told Americans they will be making
a "gPtjat decision" when they vote
tomorrow to decide control of the
84th Congress.
The President, who appeared be
fore the TV cameras with his wife,

KZSU has announced that it
will present "up-to-the-minute"
broadcasts of election returns fre
quently tonight.

Mamie, said the results of the bal
loting will "affect the national life
for the next two years and far be
yond that." Even Americans who
stay at home, he said, will have an
effect—but a negative one.
"HAVE YOU VOTED?"
Recalling that last week he
launched a telephone get-out-the
vote blitz, he appealed to his listen
ers to call up 10 persons tomorrow
and say, "Have you voted?"
With Mr. Eisenhower concentrat
ing his appeal to all Americans to
vote, Nixon wound up the GOP po
litical gunfire. He declared that elec
tion of a Republican Congress was
needed to carry on the Eisenhower
program of "peace and prosperity."
He said the only way to continue
the program of smashing the "Com
munist conspiracy" at home and
continue the "liberal and humani
tarian" policies of the President is to
send a GOP Hpuse and Senate back
to Washington.
ACTIVE CAMPAIGN
In his 10-minute talk, Mr. Eisen
hower ended the most active cam
paign conducted by a U.S. President
in an off-year election in modern
times.
Mr. Eisenhower said that the vot
ers, having listened to all the cam
paign oratory, now have to decide
for themselves "where the truth
lies." There is no escape, he said,
from taking part one way or another
in "this great decision."
GOP CONFIDENT
Brisk cool weather was forecast
for much of the country. However,
regardless of the weather, pollsters
and experts generally expected, a
Democratic tide strong enough to
shift the House and perhaps the Sen
ate to Democratic control.
But Republicans insisted that their
llth-hour blitz, led by Mr. Eisen
hower's re-charged political drive,
had pulled the fat out of the fire and
that they would hold both Houses
by a slim margin.
