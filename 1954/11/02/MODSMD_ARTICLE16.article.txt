SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 1 (UP)â€”
Republican and Democratic party
leaders issued last - minute victory
claims today on the eve of a crucial
California general election.
With California rated a key state
# by national party wheels, an esti
mated 4,000,000-plus voters were ex
pected to cast their ballots during
the 12-hour period the polls arc open
tomorrbw starting at 7 a.m.
The people will elect a Governor,
U.S. Senator, 30 Congressmen, 190
state legislators, Lieutenant Gover
nor, Treasurer, Secretary of State,
Controller, fill four spots on the
State Board of Equalization, and de
cide 20 ballot propositions.
The U.S. Weather Bureau here
predicted the weather throughout
the state generally would be "pretty
good" on election day with no rain
forecast for any area.
' Although the weather was ex
pected to be good and the long pe
riod of campaigning in the state was
one of the most active in 20 years,
only about 65-70 per cent of the

state's 5,885,237 registered voter
were expected to ballot.
Thomas W. Caldecott, state chair
man of the Republican party, said he
thought the intense GOP campain'i
of the last 10 days would be cli
maxed by the election of all state
wide Republican incumbents.
Mrs. Elizabeth Snyder, chairman
of the Democratic State Central
Committee, issued an election - eve
prediction differing sharply from
Republican Caldecott's analysis.
"Sam Yorty's going to make it
against Kuchel," she said, "and we
expect to pick up three, possibly five
scats in Congress in California."
