# For the Republicans
## 
### 
As the curtain falls on all the charges and
counter-charges, the political demonstrations
and the predictions of the 1954 Congressional
campaign, the American voter today steps into
the political spotlight and in the privacy of the
voting booth will decide which party will con
trol the legislative branch of our government
for the next two years.
Many of the issues of the 1952 campaign are
still present, but today, the voters have the op
portunity of comparing the records of 20
months of Republican leadership with the 20
years of Democratic rule which preceded it.
The guestion facing the voter today, we feel,
is simply: shall the United States continue to
go forward with the Republicans or shall we
turn back to the Democratic policies of toler
ation of war, corruption, and a false sense of
economic security based on inflation?
What is that Eisenhower record upon which
the Republicans have based their campaign?
In the field of foreign policy, after 20 months
of Republican leadership, the Korean war is
ended and for the first time in 15 years the
world is at peace. Before Mr. Eisenhower
moved into the White House, the Democrats had
spent billions on foreign aid, yet the United
States was not able to meet the threat of Com
munism anywhere in the world. The Demo
cratic foreign policy had gotten us involved in
a Korean "police action"—a war which we
could not win, but could not afford to lose—
a war which cost us 140,000 American casual
ties.
The threat of war was also present in Trieste,
in the Suez, in Iran, in Guatemala, and several
other hot spots when the Republicans took over
in 1952. The Democrats have adopted tactics
of criticize, attack, and misrepresent in an at
tempt to cover up the failures of their own
policies in these areas.
Yet, we have heard not one Democrat re
fute the obvious fact that this country's position
in world affairs today is improved 100 per cent
over what it was in 1952. Those who say we
should go back to the Democratic policies con
veniently ignore the figures which show that
during Truman's seven years in the White
House, GOO million people were lost to the Com
munists. Foreign aid spending has been re
duced $6 billion below 1952-53, and still Com
munism has been turned back in Korea and in
Indochina, and the once-overpowering Red
tide has been halted in other areas. When con
fronted with these facts, Mr. Truman recently
said that after all, there really isn't "any differ
ence between the Eisenhower policy and the
policy which preceded it." We feel that the
American voter can very definitely see a.dif
ference. ,
What is the Republican record in areas other
than foreign policy? On the domestic economic
scene, the Democrats have fallen flat in the
prophecies of gloom which they so loudly ex

pounded in 1952. Taxes have been reduced;
government spending has been slashed; the
national deficit has been cut; and still the sky
rocketing cost of living has been leveled off
and the value of the dollar has at last been
stabilized. Although unemployment was con
siderably higher during several years of Roose
velt-Truman leadership, the Republicans realize
that with 2,740,000 out of work today, the situ
ation is serious, and they are taking construc
tive steps to reduce that figure, rather than
accepting it as a "necessary evil," as did their
predecessors.
The Republicans have expressed a desire
to preserve those incentives which inspire cre
ative imagination in the economy, coupled
v/ith a sound money policy to maintain eco
nomic stability. Following through on this
philosophy, the Republicans pushed for remov
al of price, v/age, and rent controls; the reduc
tion of income taxes; and suspension of excess
profits taxes. Reduction in the cost of running
the government has been achieved by retract
ing over-extended activities of the Democrats
and increasing efficiency.
• The Republicans are determined to establish
efficiency and integrity in government, while
tempering federal intervention with a faith in
local initiative and responsibility which was so
obviously lacking under the Democratic admin
istrations which preceded them.
Efficiency and integrity in government have
been demonstrated by the economy measures,
security tightening, reorganization programs,
and corruption clean-up. Government bureaus
have been stripped of employees who suc
cumbed to favoritism and bribery. Communisf
infiltration into government has been recog
nized as a serious threat by the Republican ad
ministration. A sane and effective program of
dealing with Communists in government has
finally been adopted, and has shown the issue
to be much more than the "red herring" Mr.
Truman continually referred to so casually.
The issue in 1952 was clearly whether the
American voter wanted to continue the Demo
cratic policies or repudiate them and go for
ward under new leadership. The results of that
election left little doubt as to what was wanted.
Today, the issues are the same, but the voter
has the advantage of being able to compare
the Republican achievements during the last
20 months with those of their Democratic op
ponents.
In the voting booth today, the voter will de
cide whether to continue forward with the Re
publicans or whether to turn to the left and head
back down a road leading to Democratic foreign
policies which failed, the toleration of Com
munism at home, a slipshod economic founda
tion upon which to build a false feeling of pros
perity and security, and ever-expanding gov
ernment intervention and control; or whether
to continue forward along the clearly-mapped
road which the Republicans have established.
