# Republicans Lead Democrats In Poll Conducted by Students
## 
### 
A recent election poll of Santa
Clara County conducted by six
Stanford students chalked up
for the Republican Party a 53 to
47 per cent margin over the
Democrats. t
The students from Dr. Alfred de
Grazia's and Dr. Robert Clark's
classes in Public Opinion and Dr.
Thomasr Barclay's class in American
Government contacted 240 of the
county's voters last weekend in a
random sample in order to discover
the trend of today's vote.
"To the 53 to 47 per cent split,"
Dr. De Grazia reported, "can be
added a percentage point or two to
the Democratic column." He attrib
uted this to the finding that more
Democratic voters are suspicious of
poll takers than Republicans.
Nevertheless, the students found
an indication of a strong Democratic
trend in the county and a probability
that the Democrats will make their
strongest showing in the last 18

years.
The conclusion was also drawn
that it will be primarily an election
I based on party labels and very little .
1 splitting of the ballot, as contrasted
: to previous California elections.
The six pollsters discovered a pro
found ignorance -among the voting
! populace as to the candidates run
: ning from both parties.
Do Grazia admitted that the re
j suits were not overly conclusive be
| cause of the small number of voters
! contacted. 4
A limitation of time and method
I prevented a more complete coverage
of the county. The survey was con- !
ducted by telephone instead of per- t
I sonal contact because of the small
number of poll takers and the length 1
1 of time in which the poll had to be
, concluded.
"Polls are always affected by sam- ;
| pling errors and the ratio of the j
parties which turn out to vote i
election day," De Grazia added.
The subjects were asked (1) if
l they were going to vote, (2) if so,
; if they were going to vote a*Repub

lican, Democratic, or evenly split
ticket, (3) il there was any particu
lar candidate of the other party for
. whom they intended to vote, and (4)
how they were going to vote in the
race for sheriff.
They were asked about the sher
iff's race because it is a particularly
hot contest and there is no party
label attached to the candidates.
In every other case, candidates
stated their party affiliation. The
question was asked in an effort to
find the effect of a Democrat or Re
publican label after a candidate's
name.
The poll indicated the closeness of
! the race and showed a large num
ber of undecided voters, estimated
to be about 40 per cent. It was found
that (JO per cent of the votes for Wil
: liam Young, a Republican, came
; from Democrats, and 40 per cent for
i Melvin Hawley, an independent,
! came from Republicans.
Participating in the election sur
vey were Carolyn Slack, William
Hosier, Peter Francis, Donald Win
ston, James Eaves, and Gary Eller.
