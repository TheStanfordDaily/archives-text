# For the Democrats

The personal charm of President Eisenhower
coupled with the list of programs he might have
accomplished will meet head-on at the polls
today with the pro-big business and schizo
phrenic foreign policies of the Republican
party.
Mr. Eisenhower has chosen to make his Con
gressional record the main campaign issue.
Mr. Nixon has preferred to base his speeches
on Korea, corruption, and communism. Repub
lican candidates who are "running scared" have
tabbed Mr. Eisenhower himself as the number
one topic of discussion.
Let's look at the record.
The revised tax bill is one of the glittering
accomplishments of the Republican Congress.
This bill has divided up the tax-reduction dol
lar in the following manner: 73 cents to corpo
rations, 18 cents to families earning more than
$5000, 9 cents to families earning less than
$5000. Taxes on income from corporation stock
were reduced; taxes on earned income were
not correspondingly cut.
Mr. Eisenhower has bragged about the hous
ing legislation which, if passed in the Senate,
will authorize construction of 35,000 homes this
year. He had originally asked for 140,000 units,
but Republican Congressmen whittled this
down over the sharp protests of the Democratic
Party.
Perhaps the field of pubiic power best illus
trates the Republican concern for the welfare
of business. During the '52 campaign Mr. Eisen
hower said "TVA will be operated and main
tained at maximum efficiency . . . and will con
tinue to serve and promote the prosperity of
this great section of the U.S." Last year the
President called TVA an example of "creeping
socialism."
In their haste to turn the country back to the
businessmen, the Republicans have: negotiated
with a private utilities company to build a pow
er plant in the TVA area, turned the Hells Can
yon water power site over to the Idaho Power
Company which will mean higher costs to con
sumers, abandoned the "preference clause" in
the law requiring that first chance at low-cost
power be given to non-profit groups such as
REA co-ops and municipalities.
Mr. Nixon will find no opposition to his sup
port of peace and honesty in government. It
is reasonably safe to take a strong stand aaainst
war and corruption.
Neither will Mr. Nixon find opposition to his
intense dislike of the communist party, its meth
ods and its goals.
But Democrats everywhere deeply resent

the constant slurs upon their loyalty made by
the Vice-President. "Security risks"—alleged
ly released from the government—varying in
number from 37 to over 6000—have spear
headed his cry that the Democratic Party is soft
towards communism.
It is interesting to note, however, that of all
the "dangerous elements" in the government
which have been "cleaned out" under the Eis
enhower administration, not one definite case
of a proven communist has been released. And
the communist "gang" which Mr. Nixon is so
fond ot mentioning was brought to trial under
the Smith Act of the Truman administration.
In foreign policy we find the greatest weak
ness of the Republican Party. American leader
ship and prestige are at an all-time low. Why?
Because our relations with European nations
have been strained by the increase in certain
tariff rates and the difficulty with which Pres
ident Eisenhower and the Democrats managed
to push through a one-year extension of the
Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act.
Because Secretary Duhes' great achievement
at Geneva was walking out in the middle of the
conference, almost wrecking negotiations, then
reluctantly returning at the very end to com
plain because the West had "lost" Indochina.
Because the Bricker Amendment, which
would have destroyed the power exercised by
the executive over foreign affairs, was defeated
by the Democrats by a margin of one vote.
Because Senate Majority Leader Knowland
has hampered work in the United Nations by
calling for United States withdrawal should Red
China be admitted. ,
Because credit for the London Pact, which
the Republicans hail so loudly, belongs to
Anthony Eden, who acted with speed and
statesmanship to salvage Western unity from
the rubble of EDC.
Because the rantings of Joseph R. McCarthy
resound around the world more loudly than
the platitudes of Dwight D. Eisenhower, and
with great effect, for he is the man who was
able to disrupt the entire United States govern
ment for six weeks last spring.
Why, then, a Democratic Congress? To give
bipartisan strength to our foreign policy and
insure that world peace won't be washed down
the drain of isolationism and indecision. To in
sure domestic legislation for the benefit of all
the people, not just business interests.
And, above all, to restore to the individual
American his sense of importance and dignity,
which have been badly damaged during 20
months of suspicion and neglect.

would have destroyed the power exercised by
the executive over foreign affairs, was defeated
by the Democrats by a margin of one vote.
Because Senate Majority Leader Knowland
has hampered work in the United Nations by
calling for United States withdrawal should Red
China be admitted. ,
Because credit for the London Pact, which
the Republicans hail so loudly, belongs to
Anthony Eden, who acted with speed and
statesmanship to salvage Western unity from
the rubble of EDC.
Because the rantings of Joseph R. McCarthy
resound around the world more loudly than
the platitudes of Dwight D. Eisenhower, and
with great effect, for he is the man who was
able to disrupt the entire United States govern
ment for six weeks last spring.
Why, then, a Democratic Congress? To give
bipartisan strength to our foreign policy and
insure that world peace won't be washed down
the drain of isolationism and indecision. To in
sure domestic legislation for the benefit of all
the people, not just business interests.
And, above all, to restore to the individual
American his sense of importance and dignity,
which have been badly damaged during 20
months of suspicion and neglect.
The personal charm of President Eisenhower
coupled with the list of programs he might have
accomplished will meet head-on at the polls
today with the pro-big business and schizo
phrenic foreign policies of the Republican
party.
Mr. Eisenhower has chosen to make his Con
gressional record the main campaign issue.
Mr. Nixon has preferred to base his speeches
on Korea, corruption, and communism. Repub
lican candidates who are "running scared" have
tabbed Mr. Eisenhower himself as the number
one topic of discussion.
Let's look at the record.
The revised tax bill is one of the glittering
accomplishments of the Republican Congress.
This bill has divided up the tax-reduction dol
lar in the following manner: 73 cents to corpo
rations, 18 cents to families earning more than
$5000, 9 cents to families earning less than
$5000. Taxes on income from corporation stock
were reduced; taxes on earned income were
not correspondingly cut.
Mr. Eisenhower has bragged about the hous
ing legislation which, if passed in the Senate,
will authorize construction of 35,000 homes this
year. He had originally asked for 140,000 units,
but Republican Congressmen whittled this
down over the sharp protests of the Democratic
Party.
Perhaps the field of pubiic power best illus
trates the Republican concern for the welfare
of business. During the '52 campaign Mr. Eisen
hower said "TVA will be operated and main
tained at maximum efficiency . . . and will con
tinue to serve and promote the prosperity of
this great section of the U.S." Last year the
President called TVA an example of "creeping
socialism."
In their haste to turn the country back to the
businessmen, the Republicans have: negotiated
with a private utilities company to build a pow
er plant in the TVA area, turned the Hells Can
yon water power site over to the Idaho Power
Company which will mean higher costs to con
sumers, abandoned the "preference clause" in
the law requiring that first chance at low-cost
power be given to non-profit groups such as
REA co-ops and municipalities.
Mr. Nixon will find no opposition to his sup
port of peace and honesty in government. It
is reasonably safe to take a strong stand aaainst
war and corruption.
Neither will Mr. Nixon find opposition to his
intense dislike of the communist party, its meth
ods and its goals.
But Democrats everywhere deeply resent

the constant slurs upon their loyalty made by
the Vice-President. "Security risks"—alleged
ly released from the government—varying in
number from 37 to over 6000—have spear
headed his cry that the Democratic Party is soft
towards communism.
It is interesting to note, however, that of all
the "dangerous elements" in the government
which have been "cleaned out" under the Eis
enhower administration, not one definite case
of a proven communist has been released. And
the communist "gang" which Mr. Nixon is so
fond ot mentioning was brought to trial under
the Smith Act of the Truman administration.
In foreign policy we find the greatest weak
ness of the Republican Party. American leader
ship and prestige are at an all-time low. Why?
Because our relations with European nations
have been strained by the increase in certain
tariff rates and the difficulty with which Pres
ident Eisenhower and the Democrats managed
to push through a one-year extension of the
Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act.
Because Secretary Duhes' great achievement
at Geneva was walking out in the middle of the
conference, almost wrecking negotiations, then
reluctantly returning at the very end to com
plain because the West had "lost" Indochina.
Because the Bricker Amendment, which
would have destroyed the power exercised by
the executive over foreign affairs, was defeated
by the Democrats by a margin of one vote.

the Vice-President. "Security risks"—alleged
ly released from the government—varying in
number from 37 to over 6000—have spear
headed his cry that the Democratic Party is soft
towards communism.
It is interesting to note, however, that of all
the "dangerous elements" in the government
which have been "cleaned out" under the Eis
enhower administration, not one definite case
of a proven communist has been released. And
the communist "gang" which Mr. Nixon is so
fond ot mentioning was brought to trial under
the Smith Act of the Truman administration.
In foreign policy we find the greatest weak
ness of the Republican Party. American leader
ship and prestige are at an all-time low. Why?
Because our relations with European nations
have been strained by the increase in certain
tariff rates and the difficulty with which Pres
ident Eisenhower and the Democrats managed
to push through a one-year extension of the
Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act.
Because Secretary Duhes' great achievement
at Geneva was walking out in the middle of the
conference, almost wrecking negotiations, then
reluctantly returning at the very end to com
plain because the West had "lost" Indochina.
Because the Bricker Amendment, which
would have destroyed the power exercised by
the executive over foreign affairs, was defeated
by the Democrats by a margin of one vote.
Because Senate Majority Leader Knowland
has hampered work in the United Nations by
calling for United States withdrawal should Red
China be admitted. ,
Because credit for the London Pact, which
the Republicans hail so loudly, belongs to
Anthony Eden, who acted with speed and
statesmanship to salvage Western unity from
the rubble of EDC.
Because the rantings of Joseph R. McCarthy
resound around the world more loudly than
the platitudes of Dwight D. Eisenhower, and
with great effect, for he is the man who was
able to disrupt the entire United States govern
ment for six weeks last spring.
Why, then, a Democratic Congress? To give
bipartisan strength to our foreign policy and
insure that world peace won't be washed down
the drain of isolationism and indecision. To in
sure domestic legislation for the benefit of all
the people, not just business interests.
And, above all, to restore to the individual
American his sense of importance and dignity,
which have been badly damaged during 20
months of suspicion and neglect.
