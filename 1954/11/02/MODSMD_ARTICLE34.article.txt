### JIM PIGOTT 
Los Arcos, sparked by the speedy I
running and pin-point throwing of |
Larry Bishop, rolled to a 25-7 vie- 1
tory over El Tigre in intramural
play yesterday. The game turned
into a passing duel between Los Ar- [
cos' Bishop and Jack Leider of El
Tigre. Bishop threw four touchdown |
passes to one for Leider.
After El Tigre took the opening
series of downs and failed to make
the necessary yardage, Bishop
steered his team goalward, pitching
to Karl Verhoye for the score. Later I
in the half this same combo com
bined to score again and this time j
Bishop threw to Bob Durand for the
extra point.
The second half was much the
same story as the first. Bishop threw j
three straight passes to Chuck
Forbes, the last one good for 12 \
yards and a touchdown.
At this point. El Tigre made its \
only sustained drive of the day. The !
climax of the drive came when Lei
der passed 26 yards to Walt Wun
derlich in the end zone. On the
next play he hit Rufus Morgan, j
standing all by himself in the end
zone, for the extra point.
The final score came when Bishop j
and Dick Olson teamed up on a pass ;
play.
