"I think I made a wise decision when I made up my mind to
play baseball instead of football," said Cincinnati Redleg slugger
led Kluszewski as he sat in the btaniord Stadium Press Box at
Saturday's game.
Kluszewski, whb is a strong possibility to get the Most Valuable

Player award in the National *
League, is in California on vacation
visiting his brother-in-law who lijjes I
in Mountain View.
The big first baseman played two |
years of football at Indiana before

he went into pro
fessional baseball.
In his sophomore
year, he was
named to honor
able mention All-
America.
"Football play- '
ers have a short- '
er life span than
baseballers," h e
said, "and a 1 so I

j theies Jess com- j C( | Kluszewski
petition on the
l diamond than there is on the grid- '
j iron."
"In baseball, an athlete really has
to work to get somewhere, while in
I football, all you have to have is a
; little brawn or a little speed plus
! some polish. I'll take baseball any
i day."
While Ted *rnade it clear that he
was just out here for a rest and
not to play baseball, he did con-
I sent to take part in the Oakland
i Elks Major-Minor all-star game at
Emeryville a week ago Sunday.
He satisfied the many Bay Area
| fans who came to see him by
j knocking two home runs and get
! ting credit for live runs-batted-in.
We asked Ted what he thought
of Jack Shepard. who graduated

from Stanford in 1953 and was a
catcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates
this year.
'"He's done a good job as a
catcher just out of school. I think
he will really shape up, as he
hasn't had too much to work with
yet."
Shepard hit .303 in his first year i
as a major leaguer.
The amiable athlete also com- ;
mented on the possibility of the big
leagues moving to the West Coast.
"I wouldn't mind it at all, but before
a solution can be worked out two
problems have to be taken care of. j
"First, the travel and time situa- \
tion would make it such that two \
teams would be needed on the coast
before the plan would be feasible.
Second, the schedules would have to
be completely changed around to al
low for traveling time and such.
"You have the population out here,
so I think major league ball would
really catch on if given the oppor
tunity."
When asked about the chance of
the Philadelphia Athletics moving,
Kluszewski commented, "Of course,
I'm in no position to judge happen
ings in another league, but I think it
would probably be good for the city
of Philadelphia if they did move."
Kluszewski finished his fifth year
in the majors this fall with an bat
ting average of .332, which was good
for fourth in the league. He also
paced all big leaguers in the home
run department with 49 and in the
RBI rankings with 141.
