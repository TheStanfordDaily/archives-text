# Senate Close; Demos Lead House, Governor Races
## Knight Gains Early Lead Over Graves; Kuchel Scores Victory Over Yorty 
### 
(Compiled from dispatches of the United Pre3s)
Republicans had a razor-edge lead for control of the Senate early today but the Democrats scored
sensational gubernatorial gains and seemed headed for control of the House.
For a measure of the House trend, politicians kept a close eye on 84 so-called "marginal" districts
which might swing either way.
A United Press tabulation showed the Democrats had won four of these districts and were lead
ing in 32 while Republicans had won three and were leading in 14.
The Democrats picked up two House seats which the Republicans won by a small margin in

1952 — the Indiana Eighth and
Dclaware-at-large.
Republicans picked off a
Democratic seat in Florida, which
they narrowly missed two years ago.
Two other Republicans who won
llou c scats from the South in the
Eisenhower sweep of 1952—Repre
sentatives Richard H. PofT and Joel
T. Broyhill—came through again this
time.
