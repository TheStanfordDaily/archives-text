# Liquor Violation Penalty Levied Against Theta Xi
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
' Thctii Xi fraternity was assessed 400 Con Home hours last night by the Interfraternity Council for
a violation of the Stanford campus liquor regulations early last month.
The penalty, as announced by IFC president Otis Winters, stipulated that the 400 members must
be divided equally among the members of the house and worked off by the end of autumn quarter.
Jack Young is president of Theta Xi. Forty men live in the house.
According to the report of the IFC's fact-finding judiciary committee which investigated the sit-

j uation, Theta Xi served liquor at a
j "spontaneously arranged" party af
j ter the Lagiinita Farm Fair between
10:30 p.m. Oct. 2 and 1 a.m. Oct. 3.
Last night's case was the most .se
rious problem tackled by the IFC
since it assumed last spring the dis
ciplinary powers previously held by
the Interfratcrnity Board of Con
trol.
The judiciary committee reported
that "evidently the cocktail party
did not cause any loud noise because
| no police were called." The com
| mittee also pointed out that Theta
I Xi's "previous record . . . shows no
j violations during recent years."
The report continued that 15 to 20
] couples we.re present in the house
I during the evening. Jack Young
1 stated at the meeting that there was
community singing in the living
room, dancing in the hall, and three
I private cocktail parties upstairs.
With these facts as a basis, the
majority of the IFC members—pres
idents of the 24 fraternity houses—
| felt that suspension or loss of rush
ing privileges would be too severe a
penalty to impose.
Bob Pedersen of the Dckes urged
also that social probation bo elimi
nated from the list of possible pun
ishments because it would be too
hard to enforce.
Thus the bulk of the hour-long
discussion narrowed to a debate
about the relative merits of mone
tary fines or Con Home hours. The
Council majority felt that hours at
the Con Home would have more
lasting effect and as a result would
j be a better corrective measure.
The IFC thought, that for many
| men a fine would not be a stiff pun
1 ishment. The decision to assess Con
i Home hours resulted from t.hi. opin
i ion.
Before the Council approved the
motion containing the penalty which
j lias been incurred, it strongly voted
down a similar motion for 400 Con
Home hours which did not contain
the provision that the work would
be shared equally by the members
1 of the house.
The reasons for this decision were
I (1) to relieve pressure from the
house president and (2) to empha
size the fact that this is a group
penalty although the infraction may
have been made by only a few mem
! bers of the house.
In other business Steve Horrcll of
| the Zrtcs presented the proposed
i procedures for rushing as drawn up
| by the IFC rushing committee.
The committee recommended that
rushing begin on Tuesday. Jan. 4
(the day after registration day) with
I a series of five open houses. Formal
rushing would begin Saturday, Jan.
i 8, and continue through Saturday,

' Thctii Xi fraternity was assessed 400 Con Home hours last night by the Interfraternity Council for
a violation of the Stanford campus liquor regulations early last month.
The penalty, as announced by IFC president Otis Winters, stipulated that the 400 members must
be divided equally among the members of the house and worked off by the end of autumn quarter.
Jack Young is president of Theta Xi. Forty men live in the house.
According to the report of the IFC's fact-finding judiciary committee which investigated the sit-

j uation, Theta Xi served liquor at a
j "spontaneously arranged" party af
j ter the Lagiinita Farm Fair between
10:30 p.m. Oct. 2 and 1 a.m. Oct. 3.
Last night's case was the most .se
rious problem tackled by the IFC
since it assumed last spring the dis
ciplinary powers previously held by
the Interfratcrnity Board of Con
trol.
The judiciary committee reported
that "evidently the cocktail party
did not cause any loud noise because
| no police were called." The com
| mittee also pointed out that Theta
I Xi's "previous record . . . shows no
j violations during recent years."
The report continued that 15 to 20
] couples we.re present in the house
I during the evening. Jack Young
1 stated at the meeting that there was
community singing in the living
room, dancing in the hall, and three
I private cocktail parties upstairs.
With these facts as a basis, the
majority of the IFC members—pres
idents of the 24 fraternity houses—
| felt that suspension or loss of rush
ing privileges would be too severe a
penalty to impose.
Bob Pedersen of the Dckes urged
also that social probation bo elimi
nated from the list of possible pun
ishments because it would be too
hard to enforce.
Thus the bulk of the hour-long
discussion narrowed to a debate
about the relative merits of mone
tary fines or Con Home hours. The
Council majority felt that hours at
the Con Home would have more
lasting effect and as a result would
j be a better corrective measure.
The IFC thought, that for many
| men a fine would not be a stiff pun
1 ishment. The decision to assess Con
i Home hours resulted from t.hi. opin
i ion.
Before the Council approved the
motion containing the penalty which
j lias been incurred, it strongly voted
down a similar motion for 400 Con
Home hours which did not contain
the provision that the work would
be shared equally by the members
1 of the house.
The reasons for this decision were
I (1) to relieve pressure from the
house president and (2) to empha
size the fact that this is a group
penalty although the infraction may
have been made by only a few mem
! bers of the house.
