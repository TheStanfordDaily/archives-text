### 
LONDON, Nov. 2 (UP)â€”Prime
Minister Winston Churchill told
the House of Commons today he
believed the explosion of "an
undue number" of hydrogen and
atom bombs "might have very
serious effects" on the world.
Churchill hedged on a suggestion
that he propose to President Eisen- 4
hower and Premier Gcorgi Malen
kov of Russia that such test explos
ions be stopped pending the out
come of United Nations disarma
ment proceedings.
Speaking gravely of the subject,
Churchill chided members who
laughed when he said he was in
formed that "5,000 years is about the
limit of the time during which the
atmosphere would be afTected" by
the blasts.
''I do not want to talk in a face
tious manner about what is per
petually in all our minds." he said.
The discussion was set. ofT by a
question from Laboritc R. T. Paget.
He asked, "How many of these ex
plosives will it take to make the
atmosphere lethal, and are they
cumulative?"
Laboritc Arthur Henderson asked
Churchill if in consideration of re
cent nuclear explosions in Russia
lie would propose the stoppage to
Eisenhower and Malenkov.
"There are v several proposals he
fore the United Nations, and it is
there that the solution should he
sought," Churchill said. "I am not
convinced that the cessation, wholly
or partly, of these explosions would
be best advanced by our interven
tion or by my personal intervention
;ii the present time."
