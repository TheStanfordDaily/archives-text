# Autos Collide On Palm Drive
## 
### 
A two-car collision occurred at
9:15 a.m. yesterday at the campus
end of Palm Drive near the edge of
the center oval. There were no in
juries.
A car driven by Steve Klee, 855
Partridge, Palo Alto, collided with a
cur driven by Dan Flower, a Stern
Hall sophomore, as both were com
ing from opposite sides of the oval.
A third automobile driven by Bill
Rodriguez, a worker employed in
construction of the new men's dorm,
received some damage in attempting
to avoid the accident.
Both drivers said the accident oc
curred because they couldn't see
each other in time, since parked cars
blocked the view. Damage was to
the left front fender area of Klee's
car, to the right front area of Flow
er's car, and to the grille of Rodri
guez' car.
Officer Carl Gielitz said the acci
dent was due in part to negligence
of both drivers and a violation of
right -of - way. Three parked cars
were cited at the accident scene for
"parking in a white zone, creating a
traffic hazard, and blocking the view
of an intersection where an accident
happened."
