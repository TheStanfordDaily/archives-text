CHECK YOUR GUM. PLEASE—
i Report from Brigham Young Uni-
I versity recently said that the clean-
J ing crew had collected from the
j main reading room of the library
! over 11,000 sticks of gum that had
\ been stuck to the under sides of the
; tables there. And this wasn't the
remains of an entire year's chew
1 ing! The library had been cleaned
i the previous Christmas vacation.

REPEAT PERFORMANCE —The
I Big "C" at Cal, which was recently
| painted green, has changed colors
again. This time it is pink, although
there has been a switch—wallpaper,
1 not paint. The plastering with nurs
-1 ery wallpaper was done by 11 Cal
i coeds. Cal men were urged to stand
up to the outrage and to paint the
hallowed landmark its proper color
I —blue.
