# Card Injuries Unimproved As USC Game Draws Near
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
The injury jinx continued to plague the Card gridmen yesterday
aiternoon as they went through a practice chiefly notable for the
number of varsity players who were absent from the playing field.
Sophomore halfback Bob Burget is the latest casualty. Burget
wrenched a knee in tackling practice yesterday and will

definitely miss the game Saturday.*
John Stewart, Stanford's only !
sixty-minute man against Washing- ;
ton State, missed the workout with 1
a bad cold. However, he is expected
to be ready to go by the end of the ;
week.
Trainer Connie Jarvis also an- ;
nounced that Steve Docter, the

►
McColl-like end, will he out all
season. Don Manoukian the sopho
more guard from Reno, may be
lost for the rest of the season, too.
Doeter's kne«, which has been
holding him out for three weeks
/iow, will require an operation it
has been decided. He will undergo
surgery following the Thanksgiving
vacation.
The concussion Manoukian re
ceived against the Cougars last Sat
urday, his second this season, may
bench him all year. His eyes have
been temporarily affected by the
blow.
Center Jerry Goldberg and quar
terback Jerry Gustafson are still
listed as having no better than a 50-
50 chance of seeing action against
the Trojans. Gustafson's knee ap
pears to be mending better than
Goldberg's however.
Fullback Bill Tarr and halfback
Gordie Young both worked out in
sweat clothes. They will probably
he fully recovered from muscle
strains by the end of the week.
Taylor, who held a lengthy con
ference with ex-Stanford and San
Francisco 49er-immoi'tal Frankie Al
bert on the field, termed the prac
tice as "mainly a review" with a
full scrimmage to be held today.
