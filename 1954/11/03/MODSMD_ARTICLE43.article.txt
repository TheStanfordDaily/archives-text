# Bill Tarr Outstanding Ball Player Both in High School and College
## Tarr: 'Prospects Good for SC Win' 
### LEE HANSEN 
Take one top-flight high school
athlete who has made All-State in
football and basketball. Add one
"Coach-oi'-the-Year," Chuck Taylor.
Introduce them at the Whatcom
County (Washington state) "Sports
Banquet of the Year." Fill in with a
trip to Stanford, and Bill Tarr, out
standing halfback of Bellingham
High School, becomes a freshman
at Stanford.
Three years later Tarr is one of
the most valuable players on the
Stanford team. Now holding down
the fullback position, he is second
only to Duke Washington of WSC
for rushing yardage in the Pacific
Coast Conference. In addition, he
has a total of five touchdowns for
the season.
In his sophomore year Tarr played
light half behind Dorn but switched
to full this year. As to his prefer
ence, Tarr answers, "I learned to
play football as a little kid. Didn't
know much about it so when they
asked me about position I said I
wanted to carry the ball. I still do.
My choice is where I can play the
most."
Tarr doesn't limit his sports inter
est to football but has played guard
on the frosh and JV basketball
'teams. Majoring in pre-denti.stry,
he plans to take four years at Stan
ford and then see about dental
school.
As for this week's homecoming
game with USC, Tarr is optimistic.
"We have a good chance of win
ningâ€”a gt>od chance. SC will
be over-confident. We're bothered
by injuries but our replacements
are capable." Sitting - out from
practice this week because of a leg
injury, Bill Tarr only hopes that
he won't be one of the men re
placed.
