### BILL RHOADES 
Breakers clinched at least a tie
for the eating club championship
yesterday by defeating El Capitan
13-6. Breakers has one game left
with once-beaten Los Arcos.
El Capitan drew first blood late in
the first half. Hal Tennant took a
screen pass from Hugh Roberts and
run 25 yards for the touchdown. The
half ended with the score 6-0.
With about three minutes left in
the game, Don Du√üois intercepted
a pass on his own two and returned
it 60 yards. Tennant finally overtook
him on the El Capitan 18. On the
next play, Jim Zarifes passed to Dick
Theilan who was standing in the end
zone. The ball bounced out of his
hands and after being batted around
a while, it was caught by Hal Spra
ger for the first Breakers TD.
Less than a minute- later, Wally
Weisman intercepted a pass on the
37 and returned it to the 25. Zarifes
then passed to Theilan who made a
leaping catch and fell into the end
zone. Bob Margolis took the pass for
the extra point.
El Capitan had several chances to
score in the last half but just could
n't make them pay off. Once they
had a first down and goal to go on
the 15. A fourth down pass carried
only to the three. A short time
later, they had a first and goal on
the 17. This threat ended with Du
Bois' interception. After that, they
didn't threaten.
