# New Relief Map Developed Here
## 
### 
A "3-D' schoolroom map of Cali
fornia and Nevadt in full color, exe
cuted in a new "shaded relief" tech
nique of map-making, has been pi e
pared by a Stanford University car
tographer.
Professor Joseph E. Williams, head
oi the Stanford Geography Depart
ment, developed the map. It has
been published by John W. Guntei
of San Francisco.
In preparing the map, undergrad
uate Stanford students performed
considerable research and applied
color and shading under Professor
Williams' direction. Most of them
are now employed in government or
private cartographic work.
