# U.S. Servicemen In Europe Watch Election Results
## 
### 
.LONDON. Nov. 2 (UP)â€”Election
returns were followed with unusual
interest in Europe tonight by U.S.
servicemen, British, French, and
Germans.
Army officials said a high per
centage of the 400,000 American
troops in Europe cast absentee bal
lots as did the other thousands in
Europe on business and pleasure.
The interest in the elections was
centered in Supreme Allied Head
quarters in Paris where a spccial
bulletin board was installed along
side a news agency teletype.
This followed the precedent estab
lished at Shape when troops from
14 nations insisted on following the
voting that swept Gen. Dwight. D.
Eisenhower, the former supreme
commander, into the White House.
American-language newspapers in
Rome and Paris prepared special
editions while the army in Berlin
organized a spccial election service
for troops manning the island out
post behind the Iron Curtain.
Free radio stations flashed election
news behind the Iron Curtain al
though as usual the Soviets tried to
jam such broadcasts.
The armed forces began its get
out the vote campaign months ago
and a spokesman said, "I believe the
percentage who voted was as high
or even higher than the percentage
cxpcctcd to go to the polls in Am
erica."
