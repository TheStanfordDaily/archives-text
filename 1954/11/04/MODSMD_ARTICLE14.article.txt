at 11:00 last night after a dramatic vote-by-vote race in Oregon.
Richard L. Neuberger, Democrat of Oregon, moved out to a
commanding 2,271-vote lead over Republican incumbent Guy

lous Multnomah County had not
reported in by 11 p.m.
Neuberger, trailing by as many
as 13,000 votes in early returns

after dropping behind by 127 votes
for a brief period.

held a 1,388-vote margin over Dem
ocrat Charles P. Howell on the ba is
of complete but unofficial returns.

Oregon and the Republican triumph

next January will be: Democrats. 48;
Republicans, 47; Independent, J.

gon, who bolted the Republicans in
1952, has announced that he will
vote with the Democrats, giving

CALIFORNIA RETURNS
Goodwin J. Knight emerged as a
major figure in the Republican party
today as a result of his imposing vic
tory in California's gubernatorial
election.
Knight's victory came in an elec
tion year that saw GOP guberna
torial candidates go down to defeat
in the important states of New York
and Pennsylvania. It ensured him
of nationwide attention.
Late returns in the race for Gov
ernor from 17.801 of 22.899 prccind
gave for Knight 1.681,810, and for
Graves 1,303,757.
Knight swept into office with him
every major state GOP candidate
They included Lt. Gov. Harold J.
Powers, Secretary of State Frank M
Jordan, Treasurer Charles G. John
son, and Robert C. Kirkwood, Con
troller.
The only major state post held by
a Democrat is that of Attoreny Gen
eral, won by Edmund G. Brown in
the June primary.
Voters returned comfortable GOP
majorities to the State Senate and
Assembly, although it appeared tlx-
Republicans lost at least two sea'
in the upper house and three in the
Assembly.
The Republicans will be repvo
sented at next January's session wi h
24 Senators to 15 Democratic mem
bers of the Senate. In the Assembly
the Republicans were assured of 1(i
seats and the Democrats of 29, with
five contests undecided.
In the last session the Democrat .
had 13 Senators and 26 Assembly
men.
