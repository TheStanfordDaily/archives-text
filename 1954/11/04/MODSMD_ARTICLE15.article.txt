# U.S. Seeks Red Co-operation In Atom Plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 (UP) â€”
The United States sent Russia a new
message today seeking Soviet co
operation in President Eisenhower's
global "atoms for peace" program.
Mr. Eisenhower told a news con
ference he hopes the message will
open "a new phase" in U.S.-Rus
sian negotiations which will be
"more fruitful" than previous talks
in which the Soviets cold-shouldered
the plan.
The communication is the U.S. re
ply to a message from Russia on
Sept. 22 in which the Reds indicated
they wanted to renew negotiations
on the atoms proposal Mr. Eisen
hower first advanced before the
United Nations General Assembly
last year.
The text apparently will not be
made public until tomorrow, some
time after it is delivered in Moscow.
In a statement announcing the
new move, Mr. Eisenhower noted
that Rusisa in the past "showed a
lack of interest in co-operating with
the United States to further inter
national co-operation in developing
the peaceful uses of atomic energy."
Although hopeful future negotia
tions might prove more successful,
Mr. Eisenhower again stressed that
"we arc determined to get on with
this international project whether
or not the Soviets participate."'
