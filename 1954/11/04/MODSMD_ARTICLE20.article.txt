# Every Vote Counts

"Every vote counts."
It's an old saying, and it was proved true in
Tuesday's national election, when a few hun
dred votes meant the difference in many hard
fought contests.
"Every vote counts."
Since this is the final day of the ASSU pri
maries, every Stanford student should remem
ber this adage, as he considers whether or not
to take time out from his crowded schedule to
mark a ballot.
Those who listened to the radio or watched
television Tuesday night were aware of the
close races, the see-saw races, between Ives
and Harriman in New York, Bender and Burke
in Ohio, Furcolo and SaltOnstall in Massa
chusetts, Howell and Case in New Jersey, Neu
berger and Cordon in Oregon.

These contests—and there are many more
examples that might be cited —were ones in
which a few hundred votes would have tipped
the balance.
Here at Stanford, because of the smaller
population, close races are ihe rule. Ten votes
have been known to make the difference be
tween victory and defeat for a candidate.
For this reason, if the Stanford, student really
wants representative student government, if is
up to him to ensure this leadership by casting
his vote.
The Election Board has done its part.
They have set up voting booths at conven
ient places. They have picked competent stu
dents to man the booths. They have done all
in their power to ensure a smooth-running,
trouble-free election.
The rest is up to you.
