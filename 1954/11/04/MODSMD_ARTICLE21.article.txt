# Did IFC Pass Its Test?
## 
### 
Interfraternity Council faced an important
test Tuesday night. IFC, for the first time since
it assumed judicial functions from the old Inter
fraternity Board of Control last spring, sat in
judgement of one of the houses represented on
the Council.
Student body, faculty, and administration
watched this test with considerable interest.
The question: could IFC . . . would IFC ... sit
as an effective disciplinary board for its own
members. Everyone seemed pleased when the
Interfraternity Board was abolished; everyone
was confident that the fraternities could take
care of their own disciplinary problems. The
test came Tuesday night.
The case was that cf a fraternity whose mem
bers were accused of violating the University's
liquor regulations. The rule says, in effect, "no
liquor on campus." And the house brought
liquor on campus and had a party and was
caught.
Interfraternity Council weighed the evi
dence, found the fraternity guilty of the al
leged violation, and passed sentence. The sen
tence was 400 hours labor at the Con Home,
to be divided equally among the members of
the house. There are 40 men in the house;
that's 10 Con Home hours per man.
Did Interfraternity Council pass its first test?
As one student commented, "10 Con Home
hours is about what you get for throwing a
water bag out of Encina." And yet the fratern
ity's violation was the same sort of thing that,
for instance, caused IFB to throw another house
off campus, in the spring of 1953.
The IFC judicial committee mentioned facts
which they apparently took to be points in
favor of a lighter sentence for the fraternity.
First: "Evidently the cocktail party did not
cause any loud noise because no police were
called." This is not a reason for a lighter sen
tence. The sentence was administered for vio

lating the liquor regulation, not for disturbing
the peace.
Another point, however, is a good one. The
house has a good record at Stanford, has main
tained a high scholastic standing, and has con
tributed to extracurricular activities. The ju
dicial committee pointed out that the house's
previous record "shows no violations in re
cent years." ,
The IFC felt that suspension or loss of rush
ing privileges would be too severe a penalty
to impose. A fine was considered less effective
than Con Home hours.
The pressure was on IFC, of course, to crack
down hard the first time, if merely to prove that
it could and would deal harshly with its mem
bers in the future if such action were necessary.
IFC was fully aware of this; in a way, its action,
which is quite generally considered to be quite
lenient in view of the nature of the offense, was
a courageous one.
But did IFC, on the other hand, evade the
issue on one or two points? Social probation
was dismissed as "too hard to enforce." But
this is the sort of penalty that IFC must be able
to enforce if it is to be its own judicial body.
Also, IFC noted that the action "does not estab
lish any precedent to be followed in future ac
tions." But IFC must establish and follow
precedents. Justice dictates consistency; if this
case does not establish a precedent, then to
morrow IFC might consider the same set of
facts and send a house off campus. »
IFC has considered and acted upon its first
serious problem under the new system. We
must consider the action as in some way in
dicative of how IFC will act in the future. There
is no question but that IFC has attempted to act
wisely in the matter. We do not question IFC's
motivation in the particular matter, but, deriv
ing as we must a generalization, we do question
the leniency of the act.

IFC has considered and acted upon its first
serious problem under the new system. We
must consider the action as in some way in
dicative of how IFC will act in the future. There
is no question but that IFC has attempted to act

motivation in the particular matter, but, deriv

the leniency of the act.
Interfraternity Council faced an important
test Tuesday night. IFC, for the first time since
it assumed judicial functions from the old Inter
fraternity Board of Control last spring, sat in
judgement of one of the houses represented on
the Council.
Student body, faculty, and administration
watched this test with considerable interest.
The question: could IFC . . . would IFC ... sit
as an effective disciplinary board for its own
members. Everyone seemed pleased when the
Interfraternity Board was abolished; everyone
was confident that the fraternities could take
care of their own disciplinary problems. The
test came Tuesday night.
The case was that cf a fraternity whose mem
bers were accused of violating the University's
liquor regulations. The rule says, in effect, "no
liquor on campus." And the house brought
liquor on campus and had a party and was
caught.
Interfraternity Council weighed the evi
dence, found the fraternity guilty of the al
leged violation, and passed sentence. The sen
tence was 400 hours labor at the Con Home,
to be divided equally among the members of
the house. There are 40 men in the house;
that's 10 Con Home hours per man.
Did Interfraternity Council pass its first test?
As one student commented, "10 Con Home
hours is about what you get for throwing a
water bag out of Encina." And yet the fratern
ity's violation was the same sort of thing that,
for instance, caused IFB to throw another house
off campus, in the spring of 1953.
The IFC judicial committee mentioned facts
which they apparently took to be points in
favor of a lighter sentence for the fraternity.
First: "Evidently the cocktail party did not
cause any loud noise because no police were
called." This is not a reason for a lighter sen
tence. The sentence was administered for vio

lating the liquor regulation, not for disturbing
the peace.
Another point, however, is a good one. The
house has a good record at Stanford, has main
tained a high scholastic standing, and has con
tributed to extracurricular activities. The ju
dicial committee pointed out that the house's
previous record "shows no violations in re
cent years." ,
The IFC felt that suspension or loss of rush
ing privileges would be too severe a penalty
to impose. A fine was considered less effective
than Con Home hours.
The pressure was on IFC, of course, to crack
down hard the first time, if merely to prove that
it could and would deal harshly with its mem
bers in the future if such action were necessary.
IFC was fully aware of this; in a way, its action,
which is quite generally considered to be quite
lenient in view of the nature of the offense, was
a courageous one.
But did IFC, on the other hand, evade the
issue on one or two points? Social probation
was dismissed as "too hard to enforce." But
this is the sort of penalty that IFC must be able
to enforce if it is to be its own judicial body.
Also, IFC noted that the action "does not estab
lish any precedent to be followed in future ac
tions." But IFC must establish and follow
precedents. Justice dictates consistency; if this
case does not establish a precedent, then to
