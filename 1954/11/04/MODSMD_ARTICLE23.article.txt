# Winbigler: Parents' Day Big Success
## 
### 
Parents' Day was a very success
ful undertaking, according to Don
ald Winbigler; Dean of Students.
Letters have been pouring into the
University expressing parent appre
ciation for the program that was
held last Saturday for the benefit
of parents of the freshmen.
Eight hundred fifty parents repre
senting more than 400 freshmen at
tended the affair, which included a
panel discussion, luncheon, the
Washington State football game, and
a reception at President Wallace
Sterling's home.
The panel discussion seemed to be
the most beneficial part of the pro
gram. Five members of the faculty
discussed the various aspects of the
freshman program and lower divi
sion curricula.
According to Dean Winbigler
many parents got their first insight
on the academic program. He added,
"It seems that the students write
home about everything but their
studies."
The program, which had been
thought about for several years, was
tried on an experimental basis. It
was so successful that Winbigler
said, "It was like a mandate from
the parents to continue it."
Cardinals was instrumental in the
success of the event as it sponsored
the day and efficiently handled the
luncheon at Bowman Alumni House.
Forty per cent of the parents had
to travel 250 or more miles and some
came from as far away as New York,
New Jersey, Texas, Wisconsin, Mis
souri, and Illinois. Senator William
Knowland and wife were among the
visiting parents.
