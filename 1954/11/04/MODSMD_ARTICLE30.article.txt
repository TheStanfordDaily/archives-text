# Troublesome Trojan Tackle
## 
### 

NO WOODEN HORSEâ€”Trojan tackle Ed Fouch is the real thing. Co-captain of the Figueroa
Street mob, the burly 227-pounder is considered the outstanding lineman on the squad. Un
usually fast for his size, Fouch ran a fumble back G7 yards for the deciding touchdown in SC's
12-7 win over Northwestern. Fouch also boots PATs when Coach Jesse Hill is unable to bring
Sam Tsagalakis into the game. This is Fouch's fourth year on the Trojan varsity. He is a two
year letterman.
