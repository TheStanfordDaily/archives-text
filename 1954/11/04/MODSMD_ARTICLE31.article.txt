# Sigma Chi Wins, Loses by Forfeit
## 
### MIKE McGINNIS 
Sigma Chi forfeited to the Fiji
seven in a grueling intramural foot
ball contest yesterday. Three ineli
gible graduate students nullified the
apparent 8-6 Sigma Chi victory.
Foster Bumpus caught a ball de
flected off the hands of Fred "Gandi"
Steinkamp for the Fiji's lone TD in
the first quarter.
Sigma Chi bounced back when
tailback Frank Tenerello climaxed a
drive into Fiji territory in the second
quarter with a 40-yard pass to end
Dick Hall for a tying score.
A bad pass from center got past
the Fiji quarterback, Doug Glenn,
early in the second half. Harvey
Hiber pounced on it in the end zone
for the Sigma Chi's.
In the third quarter the ball was
punted back and forth as each team
failed to move.
A determined Fiji drive in the last
minutes of the game was stopped on
the Sigma Chi eight-yard line.
