# Cards 'Ready' for USC; Gustafson Will Play
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Coach Chuck Taylor stoood bare-j
headed in the rain yesterday after
noon, watching his team file off the i
Held from a bruising scrimmage. He
turned and said quietly, "We're
i ready."
The squad finished up their con
tact work for the week with a gruel
ing but still very spirited scrimmage.
Taylor gave them a thorough work
out before he was satisfied.
Everyone was obviously cheered ;
by the improved injury situation. I
Quarterback Jerry Gustafson, who 1
only yesterday was given no bet
ter than a 50-50 chanfte of playing j
against USC, is greatly improved.
, Trainer Connie Jarvis predicted that
Gustafson W4II be completely re
covered from his leg injury by game
time.
Center Jerry Goldberg, Stanford's
! candidate for All-Coast honors, is
j still a question mark. Jarvis stated
I that Goldberg will be able to stand
| limited action Saturday. However,
| just how much Goldberg can play
I will not be determined until he gets
j in action. This could be one of the
! biggest factors in the game. Gold
berg has been the key lineman in
the Card forward wall in every game i
so far.
John Stewart has shaken off a bad

cold, and was out on the field yes
terday. Another Card wingman,
Dick Jones, is also in good playing
condition again after recovering
from a hip-pointer.
Fullback Bill Tarr and halfback
Gordy Young are again in top shape,
but taking it easy in order to avoid
restraining leg muscles.
