# Fall Drive Will Start Monday
## 
### 
KickofT day for the fall quarter
campus drive, engineered by the
Drives Committee, will be next
Monday, fall quarter chairman Jim
Eaves announced.
The goals of this quarter's drive
arc to collect funds for both the
Community Chest and the Mid-
Peninsula Children's Health Council.
The Children's Council, an organi
zation founded last year, is cur
rently aiding in the rehabilitation of
handicapped children. Their head
quarters are in Palo Alto.
Besides a Guidance Center for
emotionally disturbed children, the
Council provides a nursery school
for mentally retarded children be
tween 3 and 8 years old and a physic
al rehabilitation center for disabled
children 12 or younger.
The major share of the money col
lected, however, will go to the Palo
Alto-Stanford Community Chest, an
agency which serves eleven civic
organizations in the area.
Eaves said that the drive will last
all next week, and the method used
will be door-to-door solicitation.
