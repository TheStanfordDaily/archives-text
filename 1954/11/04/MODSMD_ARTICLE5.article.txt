# EXCOM DECISION
## Student-Faculty Group Is Temporary Committee 
### RUSS WILKS Associate Editor, The Daily 
The Executive Committee of ASSU decided to make the Stu
dent-Faculty Committee a temporary one in its meeting last night.
The decision ended two hours of spirited discussion which
saw Mary Margaret Fiaser, director of the Public Relations Com
mittee, and Liz Livadary lead opposing forces.
The problem which confronted Excom was whether the Student-

Faculty Committee should be
included in Pub Rel's jurisdic
tion, which Miss Fraser favored,
or whether it should be made a stan
or whether it should be made a
standing committee, which was Miss
Livadary's position.
Miss Fraser argued that Pub Rel
has been handling student-faculty
relations efficiently and had the or
ganization to do the job.
She contended that the removal of
this major duty would practically
remove Pub Rel Com as an impor
tant committee. She stated that
"Pub Rel constitutes working with
the administration, faculty, and
community..Our job would be ham
pered if we lose this faculty con
tact."
She asserted that since the ad
ministration and faculty are so in
tertwined contact with one without
the other wouldn't give Pub Rel the
complete picture in its dealings.
Miss Livadary in supporting the
motion to make the Student-Faculty
Committee a completely independ
ent standing committee pointed out
that the area was so important that
it needed a full - time committee
which was free to expand. If it was
under Pub Rel, she said, its impor
tance would be minimized.
The faculty is in a co-operative
mood, according to Miss Livadary,

and favors an independent commit
tee to work with. She said it would
"promote a closer bond with the
faculty. We would go slowly and
surely and do a little at a time, but
do it effectively. We would be ex
perimenting at first."
Refuting Miss Fraser's comment
that Pub Rel would sink into obliv
ion, she offered positive actions

which Pub Rel could undertake and
seriously doubted if they would have
nothing to do.
The motion to establish the stand
ing committee required a three
fourths vote, as it was a by-law
change. It was defeated 8-4.
The motion to make it a tempo
rary committee to be observed and
eventually placed was passed 9-0
with three abstentions.
