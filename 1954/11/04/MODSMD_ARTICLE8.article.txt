# Big Game Bon Fire Plans Laid
## 
### DON JACKSON 
An urgent call for long planks to
he used as support for the Big Game
bonfire has been issued by bonfire
committee chairman Walt Hays. The
boards are needed to string between
telephone poles to hold the brush
inside the bonfire.
Additionally, boards measuring
either 2 by 6 or 2 by 12 feet arc
needed for stairs on the ladder up
the side of the pyre. Anyone who
has this type of lumber or any scrap
wood is urged to phone DAvenport
3-4521 between 2 and 5 p.m. daily.
Hays also pointed out that the
freshmen will start collecting the
wood and begin the preliminary con
struction of the bonfire next week.
Using three trucks donated by local
firms and upperclass chauffeurs do
nated independently, the freshmen
will collect the lumber in four-hour
afternoon shifts, with one Encina or
Village wing working each afternoon
from 1 to 5.
A 24-hour guard patrol, protect
ing the budding bonfire structure
from random antagonists, will also
get underway next week and will
likewise be handled by the class of
'58. Each of the 21 frosh wings will
guard for 12-hour shifts between
next week and the night of the
fire and rally, Nov. 18.
The first report of any vandalism
has been given by Hays, who men
tioned that some scrap wood was
burned at the Lake Lag site of the
fire, but pointed out that the wood
was of no value.
This year's bonfire, to be adorned
by a paper mache replica of Cali
fornia's fabled "Oskie," will roast
on the Thursday night preceding the
Big Game as part of the rally at
Lake Lag.
Following up on a plan utilized
by last year's bonfire committee, the
fire will be constructed in a "Big
Push" of freshman labor starting 24
hours before the fire is scheduled to
be lit.
