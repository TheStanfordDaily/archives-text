# Demos May Support Ike Abroad, But Not at Home

(Compiled from Dispatches of United Press)
The newly elected Democratic 84th Congress yesterday offered
President Eisenhower its support in foreign affairs and a fight on
such domestic issues as public power, taxes, and farm legislation.
But there already were signs that the era of good feeling may
fade swiftly under the pressure of 1956 Presidential politics and

the sting of Democratic assaults on
the Republican record of the last
two years.
Speaker designate Sam Rayburn
said yesterday that leaders of the
new Congress will demand that the
Republicans "put up or shut up" on
their claims of mass dismissals of
federal security risks.
The Texas Democrat obviously
was irritated by GOP charges, both
before and during the election cam
paign, that large numbers of hold
overs from past Democratic admin
istrations had been fired as Commu
nists or other security risks.
Taxes, power, and farm legisla
tion arc some of the other things on
wihch a considerable number of
Democrats have disagreed with the
Eisenhower program during the last
two years.
However, Senate Democratic
Leader Lyndon Johnson of Texas
said last night that the new Demo
cratic majority in the Senate will
not "obstruct for the sake of ob
struction a truly bi-partisan for
eign policy."
Democratic control of the Senate
was assured early yesterday when
Democrat Richard L. Neubergcr de
feated Senator Guy Cordon in Ore
gon. Barring reversals by recounts
or challenges cropping up as an
aftermath to the angry and hard
fought campaign, the lineup of the
next Congress in January will be:
Senate — Democrats 48, Republi
cans 47, Independent 1.
House—Democrats 232, Republi
cans 20I5.
