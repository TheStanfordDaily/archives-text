# Bowl-Bound Trojans Favored Over Injury-Hampered Tribe
## 
### BILL, WRIGHT 
What awaits the battered, bruised, and thrice-beaten Stanford
Indian when it attempts to hold of! the fast, powerful Southern
California Trojan tomorrow afternoon at 2 in the Stadium?
The men from Troy are running amuck, unbeaten in PCC com
petition, and thundering toward Pasadena's roses. The injured,

notably Leon Clarke and Jon Ar- j
nett., arc fast, recovering and will
be ready for genie duty.
But the Big Red's "Operation
Boutice'back" plopped rather flat last j
week and the normally slow Indians
have been slowed even more by a
eries of injuries.
All, however, is not lost. Not yet,
at least. Chuck Taylor, although
more gloomy than usual, says Stan
ford has a chance. And Stanford j
does. Troy has failen once before —
to Texas Christian. Troy is not the
football monster that is UCLA and ,
can thus fall again.
Jess Hill's SC band definitely has
the manpower to send the Indians
reeling once more and the Trojans
come to the Bay Area as a just HV2-
point favorite.
SUDDEN DEATH
Southern Cal started tlic season
as a sudden-death passing aggrega
tion, when it whipped Washington
State, but with the tremendous run
ning of Jon Arnctt leading the way,
the multiple Troy offense concen
trated on a ground attack.
Last week in walking lightly over
Oregon State, SC did all its scoring
on ground plays. But the passing
game is still dangerous. Jim Con
tratto has completed 60 per cent of
his tosses, and both Arnctt. and
Frank Hall have better than 50 per
cent records.
To make matters worse, Hill has
been drilling his squad this week
specifically in the art of throwing
passes over and through the proven
weaknesses in the Card secondary.
Aramis Dandoy will probably get
the starting call at tailback for SC
with Gordon Duvall from Burbank
a surprise choice at full. Arnett, and
Decker are still slightly hobbled but
both will be ready in reserve for
part-time action.
CROW DANGEROUS
Lindon Crow, one of the best
backs—particularly on defense—on
the coast, is a dangerous threat as a
wingback. Contratto is the blocking
•back or the quarterback when Troy
runs from the T.
Leon Clarke, the big end from
Venice, lias recovered from a con
cussion and will start at one flank
slot. Chuck Greenwood will open at
right end.
The middle of the Troy line will
include George Galli, Marv Goux,
Orlando Fcrrante, Mario Da Re, and
Ed Fouch. Ferrante is just getting
back into shape after a broken leg
I suffered in practice.
The Indians are in terrible physi
j cal condition. Roy Krickeberg,
| Steve Docter, and Don Manoukian
j are definitely out of tomorrow's
game. Bill Tarr, Jerry Goldberg,
and Dick Jones are all in doubtful
playing shape.
John Ernie Dorn, Tarr,
and newcomer John Neff are ex
pected to open in the backfield for
the Cards. Neff will be inserted in
place of Gordy Young to speed up
the Tribe's pass defense secondary.
John Stewart and sophomore Bob
Gergen will get the call at ends for
Stanford, with Jim McCamant as the
lone sound replacement. Taylor has
only three guards in shape also:
Fritz Furlanic, Donn Carswell, and
Tony Mosieh, who will ride the
bench at kick-off time.
John Ludeke and Chris Marshall
will be the tackles with Goldberg
slated to begin at center.
Thus Stanford is thoroughly rid
| died even before the Trojans arrive.
And the Trojans are ready to do
| more riddling.


TROJAN TERRORS—Atamis Dandoy, above, and Leon Clarke,
below, will be big guns for the visitors from Southern California
tomorrow. Dandoy, a two-year letterman, is an outstanding
halfback, while Clarke is a triple-threat end.
