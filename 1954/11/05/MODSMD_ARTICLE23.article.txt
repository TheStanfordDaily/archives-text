# From Wishes to Action
## 
### 
The weather, as most people are fond of re
calling, is what everyone talks about and no
body does anything about.
So it has been at Stanford in the field of
student-faculty relations.
Students wistfully remark they wish they
knew some of their professors personally. Pro
fessors complain because they don't know the
faces behind the names on the blue books.
Several organizations have attempted small
scale programs of their own to promote closer
contact between students and faculty mem
bers, but these plans have necessarily been
limited in scope.
Wednesday night the Executive Committee
turned wishes into action and established the
Student-Faculty Committee.
The lengthy debate preceding this action to
determine whether this group should be in
corporated in the Public Relations Committee
or be established as an ASSU standing com
mittee, clouded the goal for which everyone
was aiming—to develop a warm, permanent
bond between students and faculty.
On a small campus this relationship develops
naturally and spontaneously. At a university

as large as Stanford,'a more formal program
must be adopted to give all students and fac
ulty members a chance to participate.
The initiative has already come from several
students. The chairman of the new committee,
Liz Livadary, presented a plan to the Execu
tive Committee which emphasizes student
faculty relations on the academic level.
Specific projects call for student-faculty
dessert discussions, symposiums, personal in
troductions by professors at the beginning of
each quarter, departmental clubs, and the pos
sibility of establishing an Honors Program in
several departments.
We agree with Miss Livadary's explanation
that once contacts are established on an in
formal yet academic basis, the more personal
social relationships will follow.
The ASSU now has a committee, a chairman,
a plan of action. All that 1 is needed is the con
tinued effort of both students and faculty to
bridge* the gap created between them in the
classroom. We know both groups will be
richly rewarded by the acquisition of new
friends.
