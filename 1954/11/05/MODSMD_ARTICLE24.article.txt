# CAMPUS OPINION
## Why 'Temporary?' 
### 
To the Editor
As incoming freshmen, we received much literature
from Stanford describing every aspect of activity and
organization on the campus. Upon arrival, we were
introduced to these activities through the Pre-Reg
program.
One of the featun s of Pre-Reg Week that impressed
us greatly was the Faculty Open House. This event
seemed to indicate to us the close bond between the
students and faculty that we had expected to exist at
Stanford. However, we were disappointed to learn
that the committee sponsoring this program was only
temporarily set up as a part of the Pie-Reg program,
for we had fully expected one to exist as an ASSU
standing committee.
We were pleaded to find that the consideration of
such a committee was on the Executive Committee
agenda for Nov. 3.
We would like to congratulate the Public Relations
Committee for devoting attention to this problem and
delegating a committee to work out plans for a Stu
dent-Faculty Committee. However, we think it was
short-sighted (of Pub Rel) not to recognize the im
portance of this committee and to seek instead to es
tablish it as a Public Relations Committee subsidiary.
At this time we would like to extend our congratu-

lations to Excom for removing the proposed com
mittee from the realm of Public Relations and setting
it up as a separate organization. We have just one
question: Why was it. established as a temporary
committee rather than given the full status of a
standing committee?
Any standing committee is "temporary" in that it
may be recalled at any time. Therefore, the estab
lishment of the Student Faculty Committee as a
temporary committee is unnecessary as a precaution
against failure.
Also, the decision seems to minimize the import
ance of the committee without affecting its function
in any way. It seems to us a useless compromise on
a matter that should entail no compromise. We feel
that every step should be taken to facilitate the es
tablishment o! this committee on a permanent basis,
and every effort made to encourage its growth, give
it support, and thereby, insure its success.
We hope that the establishment of Student Faculty
relations as a temporary committee indicates its pos
sible establishment as a standing committee as it b«~ j
gins to realize its potential.
