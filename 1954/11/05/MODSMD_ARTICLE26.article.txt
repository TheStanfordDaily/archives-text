# Bob Mathias Movie 'Not Bad’ But Will Keep Farm Laughing
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Bob Mathias is too much a
part of contemporary Stanford
history for the movie of his ex
ploits to be anything but a
source of convulsing laughter
for most Farm inhabitants.
It is Sunday Night Flick material
at its best—and on a nightly basis
at the Varsity Theater.
But "The Bob Mathias Story,"
featuring Bob Mathias as Bob Ma
thias and Melba Mathias as Melba
Mathias, when you come right down

to a bit of serious
consideration, is
not such a bad
movie.
Granted it is
not a notably
good movie,J
granted it could

have been a very excellent movie;
but after you weed through the
fantasy, particularly with regard to
Stanford, you find a pretty respec
table movie.
"The Bob Mathias Story" will be
avidly watched by the average
American movie addict and gener
ally enjoyed.
At Stanford, however, the flick
will be picked apart until there is
nothing left but the newsreel strips
of the Olympics and the 96-yard
touchdown run against SC three
years ago which no Indian observer
will ever forget.
Stanford—campus, students, ath
letic teams, or faculty—almost don't
make it into the movie. There are
two short sequences of Mathias in
action in the Coliseum, an aerial
view of Quad, and a still shot of
Roble. That's all there is. The rest
of the campus scenes — ostensibly
Stanford—were filmed at Occidental.
The dialogue is hilarious. How
many finance majors do you know
living in Encina Hall? However, if
you think the banter between Bob
and Melba is corny, consider that it
might be deliberately corny.
In many cases—which is probably
true of most film biographies—the
facts are grossly misrepresented. I
think you'll find life on the Farm
a bit changed from what you are
accustomed to. And Melba has been
gently moved from Vallejo to Tu
lare for the sake of high school ro
mance. Just to indicate a few.
Clearly the movie was produced

on a very meager budget. Other- i
wise it could have been developed '
into an outstanding, instead of rou- I
tine, presentation of the small-town
athlete to world - wide celebrity
theme.
And its' a shame a little more time
and money weren't made available, i
The real Bob Mathias story is quite
impressive. The movie does cap- |
ture convincingly his outstanding
achievements at the Olympics.
But it stops after his triumph in 1
Helsinki in 1952 and lets it go at 1
that. Mathias had an outstanding j
career as a Stanford track star and
a noteworthy career as fullback. He
was an all-around standout at Tu
large High — football, basketball,
track.
But the movie mentions none of
it and indicates that he went out for
football for the first time at Stan
ford. Allied Artists missed a tre
mendous bet for the sake of a few
expense account bucks.
The story as presented starts with
Mathias falling in love with Melba
back home in Tulare. At about that
time his track coach talks him into
trying out for the decathlon in 1948.
Despite a previous anemic condition,
his training pays off in victory. Then
he wins the Olympics.

On his return he gets the bad
news. Stanford has turned him
down for lack of credits and he has
to give prep school a whirl. So he
breaks up with Melba.,
They meet later at Stanford, but
Melba will have nothing to do with
him. Finally love blossoms again,
Bob goes back for another whirl at
the Olympics, wins, and they live
happily ever after.
Melba's performance is exception
al for a film newcomer. Bob makes
a handsome, rugged-looking appear
ance, but he's no actor.
Despite all the movie's faults—the
corn, the ridiculous, the misrepre
sentations, the obvious lack of mon
ey—there is in "The Bob Mathias
Story" a touch of greatness — the
legend of the Mathias story itself.
