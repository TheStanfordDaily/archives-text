# Card Booters Tackle Gators
## 
### 
The Stanford soccer team has its
back against the wall. To remain in
contention for the league title, the
Indians must win all of their re
maining games, including tomor
row's home game against San Fran
cisco State. Starting time is 10 a.m.
The Gator booters haven't won a
game in three tries this year, but
the present soggy weather condi
tions will make the S.F. booters from
19th Avenue way more at home and
more dangerous.
The Indians, meanwhile, after
winning their first encounter of the
season have lost their last two out
ings. Last week they were humil
iated, 7-1, by CCSF. And so tomor
row. they hope to make amends.
The Indians' main fault this year
has been lack of a strong backfield
to back up a potentially high-scor
ing line. Coach Fred Priddle hopes
the defensive holes have been plug
ged and says,"I think we will win
our last three games."
Stanford's probable starting line
up; goalie, Woods or Frye; full
backs, Thornton, Wilson, or Cortez;
halfbacks, Register, Yates, Mack;
forwards. Vinding, Suarez, Wren,
DeForest, and Koenigsberger.
