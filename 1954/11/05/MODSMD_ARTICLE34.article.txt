# 'Sad Sam’ Brings Back Sad Memories
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Sitting on the far end of the
Trojan bench tomorrow after
noon will bi' an inconspicuous
little man with a sad expression
on his face.
If anyone in the stands does no
tice him they perhaps will wonder
what he is doing in uniform since he
obviously can't be a lineman and
certainly doesn't resemble a back.
Maybe once or even twice during
the game Coach Jess Hill will mo
tion the sad-eyed man off the bench.
He will trot out onto the field, re
• main in the game for three or four
seconds, then trot off the field again.
People from Southern California
say he is a nice, quiet man. 11 is
name is Sam Tsagalakis.
' Just one year ago at the Coliseum
a magnificent Bobby Garrett and an
inspired group of Stanford football
players had a 20-20 tie with a highly
regarded Trojan team, and the game
seemed certain to end that way.
Garrett had already thrilled the 79,-
000 spectators by completing ten
passes in succession to Sam Morley
and John Steinberg. The Trojans
had the ball in Stanford territory
but were getting nowhere fast.
Then granite - faced Jess Hill
turned and nodded to little Sam.
Tsagalakis trotted out on the field.
There were 13 seconds remaining in
the game. From the Indians' 38-
yard line Tsagalakis booted the ball.
It arched upward, then came down
neatly bisecting the cross-bar for
three points.
Tsagalakis trotted off the field
j again. The scent of roses had
turned into ashes that tasted hit
ter in the mouths of the battered,
weary Stanford team.
Now Sam is back once more. This
is his last year, but he still has one
more chance. He'll be sitting there
tomorrow, waiting for Hill to give
him the word. If it comes, this freak
left over from the two-platoon sys
tem will go into action with his me
chanical deadly accuracy, justifying
his existence.
