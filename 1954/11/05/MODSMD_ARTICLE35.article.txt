# Efforts to Televise Big Game Fail Because of NCAA Rule
## 
### 
An effort by the University of
California to televise the Big Game
has failed, and for the first time in
several years the classic will not be
on television.
UC wired Washington's Harvey
Cassill, chairman of the NCAA tele
vision committee, asking permission
to locally telecast the classic, which
is a sell-out. Cassill replied that,
because of a rule put into effect this
year, it would be necessary to first
gain permission of every member
school. With but two weeks remain

ing before the game, this would be
both too cumbersome and too ex
pensive.''
Stanford's athletic director yes
terday called the rule "a stupid one,"
and said that he plans to ask for a
chnage at the next NCAA meeting,
I Jan. 5, 0, and 7 in New York.
