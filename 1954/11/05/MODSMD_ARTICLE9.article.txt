### RALPH CAHN 
Before a caucus of the Political
Union Independents, Professor Ed
gar Robinson, former head of the
Stanford History Department, told
the importance of the independent,
voter yesterday at Bowman Alumni
House.
He answered questions concerning
the position of the Republican and
Democratic parties in the light of
the election results.
Professor Robinson pointed out
that being an independent has two
advantages: the independent feels
I hat "he is following his own prin
ciples" and"he can't surely be de
livered to the Democrats on election
day, nor can he be delivered surely
to the other side."
However, Robinson pointed to the
disadvantage: "you sit back and let
the other fellow do (he work ... it
is kind of like running out on the
job."
Asked several questions concedi
ng the recent election, Robinson
said, in reference to the results on a
nation-wide level: . . after all,
there w;<sn'l such a great change."
The profo-.sor felt that the results
''id not mark a great anti-Republi
can surge, but merely the normal,
ifT-year election movement away
,'rom the administration's party.
Referring to both Eisenhower and
Stevenson, Professor Robinson said,
'Those are the kind of men who
'merge when you have a strong in
dependent."
The independent voter, Robinson
felt, had a great deal of importance
in choosing such leaders, for the in
dependent, voter constitutes approx
imately 15-20 per cent of the voting
population.
