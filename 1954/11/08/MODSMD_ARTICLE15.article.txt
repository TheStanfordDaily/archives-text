## An Important Decision 
### 
A new episode in the stormy career of Joseph
R. McCarthy will unfold today as the Senate
reconvenes to consider possible censure of the
junior senator from Wisconsin.
The national spotlight is again focused on the
familiar burly figure of the man who stole the
show during the McCarthy-Army hearings last
spring with his line, "Point of order, Mr. Chair
man."
The script changed somewhat in September.
A committee of six senators under the chair
manship of Utah's Arthur V. Watkins studied
five charges levied against Senator McCarthy.
The charges: that he had been in contempt
of the Senate, that he abused General Ralph W.
Zwicker, that he abused fellow senators, that he
urged U.S. employees to give him classified
information, that he used unlawfully such
classified information as the 2\'a page "'FBI
letter" in the McCarthy-Army hearings.
Their verdict: Censure recommended tor the
first two charges, strong condemnation for the
remaining three.
At the committee's suggestion, the Senate
hearings on their report were postponed until
November 8 to relieve senatorial consciences
of the pressure of elections.
Today is November 8. Election returns are

in. There is no excuse for further equivocating
or delay.
Mr. McCarthy has already referred to the
forthcoming session as a "lynch party" and a
"circus." We doubt that it will be either.
We do expect the colleagues of the gentle
man in question to study the Watkins' commit
tee report, listen to the rebuttal for the defense,
and decide accordingly. Their decision will
have world-wide significance.
Their decision will prove the strength of the
democratic system in curbing the evils which
may rise within it, or the weakness of a nation
which allows one man to abuse the principles
on which it founded.
Their decision will restore the dignity and
authority of the United States Senate as a whole,
or it will confirm the right of one senator to
establish a set of rules to bolster his personal
authority.
Above all, their decision will determine
whether or not the government of the United
States of America will move on to consider
issues of great national and international im
portance, or if once again it will be hampered
by the constant side-line diversion of Mr. Mc-
Carthy which has proven so detrimental and
so time-consuming in the past.
