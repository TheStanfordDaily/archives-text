# Bi-partisanship Essential
## 
### 
With election by the siiinmest margin of a
Democratic Senate and House last week, there
is suddenly much talk of bi-partisan policies.
Where there were once angry words of "left
winger" or "isolationist," "bluff and blunder"
or "treason," there are now melodious sounds
wafting down from Capitol Hill.
President Eisenhower made the first step in
this direction by calling a meeting of leaders
of both parties at the White House on Novem
ber 17 to discuss foreign policy.
Senate Majority Leader William Knowland
and his successor Lyndon Johnson met last
week to discuss the special Senate session op
ening today. After their luncheon conference,
they both predicted there would be the "closest
type of co-operaiion" in the next Senate.
Another Democratic senator, Albert Gore of
Tennessee, commented "there may be more
co-operation between the President and the
Congress next year than there was this year."
Certainly these signs of agreement are en
couiaging. The bitterness of the election cam
paign must fade guickly if the important legis-

lation scheduled for the next Congress is to be !
passed.
Democrats, many of whom candidly cam
paigned on a "support Eisenhower" platform,
find they hold wide areas of agreement with
the President. This is particularly true in the
field of foreign policy, where the Democrats
are pledged to support Mr. Eisenhower's effort
to reduce tariffs, improve trade relations, and
strengthen U.S. military and economic-assist
ance programs abroad.
Mr. Eisenhower's domestic policies may
meet more Congressional opposition, especial- !
lv in the areas of public power, taxation, and
farm supports.
But even here he will find Democratic sym
pathy with plans to modify the Taft-Hartley
Law, provide more federal aid to housing, and
initiate a national health insurance program.
This new era of bi-partisianship, which has
been forced upon Washington by the American
voters, must proceed in an atmosphere of co
operation, compromise, and clear conscience. :
World peace is too precious a prize to be sacri- ;
ficed on the altar of partisan politics.
