j Editor's note: This is the first of four articles on Women's and Men's
I Councils.

Women's Council has passed through three stages of develop
ment in its history, culminating in the live-member educative and
judicial body it is today.
The Council was originally a faculty committee, then a student
faculty committee, and is now completely student-controlled.

Together with Men's Council, it
functions as the Council for Student
Control, which hears Honor Code
cases and Election Board violations.
The primary role of Women's
Council is educative. Each year the
Council aims at a new area for edu
cation. This year it was an orien
tation program on women's social
regulations for men's and women's
sponsors, RA*, foreign scholars,
graduate women, and new directors.
The network of communication
from the Council to the women on
campus is handled through area
heads and Council representatives
from each of the women's living
groups. There are six women's res
idence areas: Branner, Roble, Lagu
nita, Women's Row, Union Units,
and Ventura. The representatives
from each area meet weekly with
Council.
Representatives l'rom each house
or division in the areas meet bi
weekly with Council and the area
heads. In this way, information is
taken back to the living groQps.
"Communication is one of our
greatest problems, and one of the
most important for education," .said
| Jean McClure, Council chairman.
Besides working, with Men's
â–  Council as the Council for Student
Cantrol to heat; Honor Code and
Election Board cases, Women's
Council functions separately in
hearing women's Fundamental
Standard violations. These cases are

usually violations beyond the letter
of stated social regulations, such as
deceit, disregard of regulations, or
unacceptable conduct.
The defendant is heard by Wom
en's Council, then any witnesses are
heard separately. The Council bases
its decision on the iactg presented,
and sends its recommendation to the
administration for final judgment.
Women's Council has ex - officio
members on tHe Fundamental
Standard Committee, AWS Cabinet,
and AWS Social Regulations Com
mittee. Through the Social Regula
tions Committee, changes in wom
en's social regulations are made and
voted on.
The present members of Women's
Council are Jean McClure, chair
man; Lynn Ferguson, vice - chair
man; Coleen Baker, supply chair
man; Ann Franks, secretary; and
Clare Van Sickle, key clerk.
The present chairman and vice
chairman of Council will go out of
office at the end of this quarter, and
a new chairman and vice-chairman
will be elected from the present
members. Two newly elected mem
bers will take office winter quarter.
One of them is Lois Padelford, elect
ed in last week's primary elections,
and the second member will be
elected in this week's ASSU final
elections.
