## 
### 
Among the functions of the
National Student Association
is that of providing the voice
of the country's university
students in national affairs,
particularly on those issues
directly affecting students.
NSA's national program is set
up through resolutions and rec
ommendations adopted each year
by the National Congress. This
group is composed of delegates
from NSA member schools, as
well as faculty and administra

tries abroad.
The Seventh National Congress

a professor should be judged are
his professional competence and
integrity," but that in almost ev
ery case present membership in
a subversive organization de
stroys his ability to teach. It was
also maintained that each case
should be judged individually by
the faculty involved.
In action on the school segre
gation issue, the Congress en
dorsed a special committee re
port initiated by Southern
schools calling for an immediate
end to segregation in. all insti
tutions of higher education. It
also suggested that teachers
should be integrated at a rate
parallel with students.
