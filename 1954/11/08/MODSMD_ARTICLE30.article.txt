### RAY WADDINGTON 
There was no excitement in the
Trojan dressing room.
Players came straggling in through
the door by ones, twos, and threes.
Their casual good - humoredness
might have indicated a light prac
tice session rather than a two touch
down victory.
Their attitudes showed more plain
ly than words that it just never oc
curred to them that they could have
lost to a team that was defeated
72-0. They didn't seem to realize
that Stanford could have won the
game.
The only excited person in the
dressing room was husky - voiced
movie actor Aldo Ray who demand
ed exurbantly "Where's my broth
er? Where's Mario?" Mario Duße
was starting left tackle for the
Trojans.
Finally Coach Jesse Hill appeared
and called the three waiting report
ers into an anteroom. Hill, an un
imposing man in a brown suit, sat
down on a bench and began munch
ing an apple.
"Stanford played a fine, high-spir
ited, inspired ball game," he re
flected between mouthfuls of apple.
"Yessir, they played a whale of a
ball game."
Hill continued this train of thought
expressing surprise that Stanford
didn't pass more. "I was just as hap
py they didn't though," he added in
his Missourian accents.
He singled out John Stewart and
Bill Tarr for particular praise. For
his team he picked out Aramis Dan
doy as the best back. Hill admitted
that SC wasn't off to good
advantage because of the fine game
Stanford turned in. However, "The
score is the final proof of success,"
he pointed out.
Hill spoke at some length about
SC's worthiness as a Rose Bowl rep
resentative, and complained about
his squad's being hampered all sea
son by injuries.
Finished with his apple Hill rose,
to a final question opined that the
Big Game would be a "whale of a
ball game," and started out the door.
As an afterthought he turned at
the doorway and said carefully,
"You can just say that this was an
aggressive, hard-fought — but clean
—ball game."
