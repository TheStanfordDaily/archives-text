Seconds later, Card fullback Bob
Schmidt intercepted a pass on the
home team's 30 and raced untouched
to pay dirt. Halfback Wallace Hon
eywell then added the only con
version of the day, to make the score
19-0.
The final tally was scored after
the Indian yearlings once again got
control of the ball. Fullback Doug

Camilli crashed through a weak and
tiling Uclan line and went all the
way standing up.
The first Papoose touchdown had
come early in the first quarter, when
Douglas tossed ten yards to end Joel
Freis climaxing a 45-yard march.
LAUDS DEFENSE
"It was our defense that won the
game," said coach Ghilotti after
wards. His words were backed up
by the statement that Brubabes were
never able to get a sustained march
going against a strong and deter
mined Card line.
Only once did the host team ever
threaten to score. Well into the sec
ond period, Jim Matheny who played
an outstanding game for the Bruin
yearlings, intercepted a Douglas
aerial and ran it back 52 yards to
the Card 11 before he was finally
tackled.
A fumble on the next play, how
ever, wrecked the Brubabes' only
chance to stay in the game.
GHILOTTI PLEASED
Ghilotti singled out Noel Robinson,
Russ Steele, and Freis as being the
main factors In the fine defense
showed by his club. He added,

though, that he was definitely
"pleased" with the work of his re
serves.
In the bivckfiold it was Lou Valli
and Doug Dick who were mainly
responsible for the Papooses 227
yards gained rushing while Douglas
was mainly responsible for 78 yards
I earned through the air.
As to the California frosh game
next week, Ghilotti said, "They were
greatly improved in their game with
USC on Friday, and they will prob
j ably be at their best for us. How
ever we will also be at our best for
I them."
