# ASSU ELECTION
## Final Ballot Will Decide IFC Powers 
### 
An AS S U constitutional
amendment v/hich would give

placed on the ballot of the cam- i
pus final election Thursday and
Friday.
To pass, the amendment must re
ceive a two-thirds majority of the
votes cast.
Also to be decided in this week's
election are seven student body of
fices for which there are two can- j
didates each
Freshman president, secretarv- j
treasurer, and Executive Commit
tee representative; Graduate Stu
dents' Association treasurer; two
Men's Council openings; and one j
position on Women's Council will be
nlled.
One Women's Council vacancy I
was filled in the primary last week '
when Lois Padelford was selected
on a majority of the ballots. (See
picture, page 2.) Ann Mueller and

CONSTITUTION AMENDMENT
The constitutional amendment,
placed on the ballot by an Excom
vote, would make the IFC the ju
diciary body for fraternity discipli- I
nary cases, replacing the Interfra- |
ternity Board of Control.
The IFB has 'been dissolved and
the IFC has been making its own
disciplinary decisions on a trial basis
since last spring when the plan re
ceived the approval of University
President Wallace Sterling.
The proposed amendment to Ar
ticle IV, section 3, reads as follows:
'"The Interfraternity Council shall
hear and judge all cases involving a
fraternity or fraternities, and such
other cases involving fraternity
members as Men's Council may
deem appropriate for judgment by
the Council."
The only change in the current j
constitution would be to substitute j
"Interfraternity Council" for the i
current "Interfraternity Board of l
Control."
