# Stanford Loses to Trojans, But 'It Was A Wonderful Effort'
## SC Captures 21-7 Contest 
### BILL WRIGHT 
The Southern California Tro
jans may be going to the Ro;;e
Bowl, but I'll still take Stanford.
Also UCLA, Notre Dame, and
Ohio State and give points.
"It was a wonderful effort," km id
Chuck Taylor. The players, the
rooting" section, and SC knew it was
a wonderful effort. But nobody
knew more than the team that they
pay off on more than effort when it
comes to football games with SC.
The rewards and the roses are
handed out fiom what it says on the
scoreboard. And Saturday the score
board said 21-7 Trojans. Stanford
wanted to win desperately, playt I
to the hilt, deserved at least a tie,
but made a couple of mistakes and
lost. As Bill Tarr said, "It kills mt."
Saturday afternoon in the Sta
dium, Stanford was as good a foot
ball team as Southern California.
For three quarters the Indians were
better, although it wasn't until the
fourth quarter that the Tribe scored.
STRATEGY
Taylor's strategy was ball control.
That plan put Jerry Gustafson in at
quarterback and John Brodie on the
bench. And for three quarters it
worked. It worked if you don't
count the fumbles and the untimely
penalties.
With Tarr ripping through gaping
holes in the SC line, the Indians
marched deep into Trojan territory
four times. The only time Stanford
hit pay dirt during the first three
quarters—a 42-yard pass from Gus
tafson to John Neff — a penalty
rubbed it out.
Meanwhile Orlando Ferrante and
Gordon Duvall had plopped on In
dian fumbles deep in Stanford tci
ritory. Jim "Rip Sewell" Contralto
heaved his blooper ball twice ovei
hapless Card defenders to make the
most of both opportunities.
FOURTH QUARTER SCORES
The teams traded well - earned
sustained drives for fourth-quartei
scores. The Trojan ground game
was consistent for the first time
against Indian reserves. Brodie
whipped seven completed passes in
nine tries through Troy's substitute
secondary.
The Big Red line was pushing the
Trojan forward wall almost at will
in the first half. Down out
passes to John Stewart were spread
ing the secondary. Tarr was batter -
ing for yardage. One good fast
back and Troy would have been out
of it.
The Indians didn't get the break .
while it still counted. The injury
to Jerry Goldberg hurt the Cards
badly. Junior Don Geddes, who
played a spirited bang-up game on


TARR TOE TACKLE—Stanford fullback Bill Tarr is tripped up in Saturday's USC game by
Gordon Duvall as the Trojan defender manages to grab hold of his toe. The action was in the first
guarter of the game, which the Trojans won, 21-7. Tarr had an outstanding day as a runner, net
ting 93 yards on 17 carries. The fullback picked up 77 of those yards during the first half. On
this play, good for 10 yards, USC ends Leon Clarke (81) and Bing Bordier (86) come in to assist
Duvall. . —Daily photo by John Luetscher
defense, was erring with his center
snaps which led to a couple of fum
bles.
But you can't take anything away
from the men from Troy. They
knew just what to do when it had
to be done . For three quarters the
SC running game was barely ade
quate. However, Contratto was sure
he could beat the Indians through
the air and he did. He knew when
to throw and where to throw; that
he took a long time getting it there j
didn't seem to matter.
CARDS NOT IMPRESSED
The Card players, the memory of
UCLA still vivid, weren't overly
impressed by the Trojans. Tony
Mosich said there was "no compari- i
son" between the Southland elevens.
'We could push their line around j
when we wanted to. They're bigger j
than UCLA, but they're not as fast,
as aggressive, or as good," Big Mo |
said.
Tarr talked about all the running
room he had. "UCLA hit me before
I could get started," he added. And i
Stewart picked UCLA by four TD's. '
TAYLOR iROUD
Taylor wouldn't talk about SC,
naturally, but he had lots of good
things to say about the Indians: "I'm
awfully proud of that team. From
an effort standpoint it was the best
game we played. A break or two j

made the difference.
"We tried to defense them differ
ently (often a 4-4-3 or a 5-3-3). I
was very happy about the way it
held up."
For top performances he named

Gustafson, Tarr, Stewart, Geddes,
and Neff. He might have named the
whole team.
If Stanford, Taylor, and the play
ers were justly disappointed, they
were also justly proud.


NO FRIENDLY FACES—Booming Bill Tarr finds no good will in
Ihis crowd of Trojans as he rips off six yards from the USC 31
down to the 25. The effort was for nothing, however, since the
Indian drive bogged down at that point and USC took over on
their 23. Laying angry hands on Tarr is tackle Ed Fouch, 77,
while fullback Gordon Duvall, 40, end Chuck Leimbach, 82, and

quarterback Jim Cantratto, 12, hem Tarr in. Guard Donn Cars
well, 64, rushes up from behind too late to assist Tarr. Tarr was
the most effective Card ballcarrier in Taylor's "ball-control"
strategy. He toted the mail 17 times to gain 94 yards while
losing only one for a net total of 93 gained.

when we wanted to. They're bigger j

I could get started," he added. And i
Stewart picked UCLA by four TD's. '
TAYLOR iROUD
Taylor wouldn't talk about SC,
naturally, but he had lots of good
things to say about the Indians: "I'm
awfully proud of that team. From
an effort standpoint it was the best

made the difference.
"We tried to defense them differ
ently (often a 4-4-3 or a 5-3-3). I
was very happy about the way it
held up."
For top performances he named

Gustafson, Tarr, Stewart, Geddes,
and Neff. He might have named the
whole team.
If Stanford, Taylor, and the play
ers were justly disappointed, they
were also justly proud.

pay off on more than effort when it
comes to football games with SC.

Saturday afternoon in the Sta

worked. It worked if you don't
count the fumbles and the untimely
penalties.
With Tarr ripping through gaping
holes in the SC line, the Indians
marched deep into Trojan territory
four times. The only time Stanford
hit pay dirt during the first three
quarters—a 42-yard pass from Gus

rubbed it out.
Meanwhile Orlando Ferrante and

hapless Card defenders to make the

The Big Red line was pushing the

Bowl, but I'll still take Stanford.

"It was a wonderful effort," km id
Chuck Taylor. The players, the
rooting" section, and SC knew it was
a wonderful effort. But nobody
knew more than the team that they
pay off on more than effort when it
comes to football games with SC.
The rewards and the roses are
handed out fiom what it says on the
scoreboard. And Saturday the score
board said 21-7 Trojans. Stanford
wanted to win desperately, playt I
to the hilt, deserved at least a tie,
but made a couple of mistakes and
lost. As Bill Tarr said, "It kills mt."
Saturday afternoon in the Sta
dium, Stanford was as good a foot
ball team as Southern California.
For three quarters the Indians were
better, although it wasn't until the
fourth quarter that the Tribe scored.
STRATEGY
Taylor's strategy was ball control.
That plan put Jerry Gustafson in at
quarterback and John Brodie on the
bench. And for three quarters it
worked. It worked if you don't
count the fumbles and the untimely
penalties.
With Tarr ripping through gaping
holes in the SC line, the Indians
marched deep into Trojan territory
four times. The only time Stanford
hit pay dirt during the first three
quarters—a 42-yard pass from Gus
tafson to John Neff — a penalty
rubbed it out.
Meanwhile Orlando Ferrante and
Gordon Duvall had plopped on In
dian fumbles deep in Stanford tci
ritory. Jim "Rip Sewell" Contralto
heaved his blooper ball twice ovei
hapless Card defenders to make the
most of both opportunities.
FOURTH QUARTER SCORES
The teams traded well - earned
sustained drives for fourth-quartei
scores. The Trojan ground game
was consistent for the first time
against Indian reserves. Brodie
whipped seven completed passes in
nine tries through Troy's substitute
secondary.
The Big Red line was pushing the
Trojan forward wall almost at will
in the first half. Down out
passes to John Stewart were spread
ing the secondary. Tarr was batter -
ing for yardage. One good fast
back and Troy would have been out
of it.
The Indians didn't get the break .
while it still counted. The injury
to Jerry Goldberg hurt the Cards
badly. Junior Don Geddes, who
played a spirited bang-up game on


TARR TOE TACKLE—Stanford fullback Bill Tarr is tripped up in Saturday's USC game by
Gordon Duvall as the Trojan defender manages to grab hold of his toe. The action was in the first
guarter of the game, which the Trojans won, 21-7. Tarr had an outstanding day as a runner, net
ting 93 yards on 17 carries. The fullback picked up 77 of those yards during the first half. On
this play, good for 10 yards, USC ends Leon Clarke (81) and Bing Bordier (86) come in to assist
Duvall. . —Daily photo by John Luetscher
defense, was erring with his center
snaps which led to a couple of fum
bles.
But you can't take anything away
from the men from Troy. They
knew just what to do when it had
to be done . For three quarters the
SC running game was barely ade
quate. However, Contratto was sure
he could beat the Indians through
the air and he did. He knew when
to throw and where to throw; that
he took a long time getting it there j
didn't seem to matter.
CARDS NOT IMPRESSED
The Card players, the memory of
UCLA still vivid, weren't overly
impressed by the Trojans. Tony
Mosich said there was "no compari- i
son" between the Southland elevens.
'We could push their line around j
when we wanted to. They're bigger j
than UCLA, but they're not as fast,
as aggressive, or as good," Big Mo |
said.
Tarr talked about all the running
room he had. "UCLA hit me before
I could get started," he added. And i
Stewart picked UCLA by four TD's. '
TAYLOR iROUD
Taylor wouldn't talk about SC,
naturally, but he had lots of good
things to say about the Indians: "I'm
awfully proud of that team. From
an effort standpoint it was the best
game we played. A break or two j

made the difference.
"We tried to defense them differ
ently (often a 4-4-3 or a 5-3-3). I
was very happy about the way it
held up."
For top performances he named

Gustafson, Tarr, Stewart, Geddes,
and Neff. He might have named the
whole team.
If Stanford, Taylor, and the play
ers were justly disappointed, they
were also justly proud.


NO FRIENDLY FACES—Booming Bill Tarr finds no good will in
Ihis crowd of Trojans as he rips off six yards from the USC 31
down to the 25. The effort was for nothing, however, since the
Indian drive bogged down at that point and USC took over on
their 23. Laying angry hands on Tarr is tackle Ed Fouch, 77,
while fullback Gordon Duvall, 40, end Chuck Leimbach, 82, and

quarterback Jim Cantratto, 12, hem Tarr in. Guard Donn Cars
well, 64, rushes up from behind too late to assist Tarr. Tarr was
the most effective Card ballcarrier in Taylor's "ball-control"
strategy. He toted the mail 17 times to gain 94 yards while
losing only one for a net total of 93 gained.
