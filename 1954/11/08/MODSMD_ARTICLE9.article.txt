The Southern California Tro
jans may be going to the Ro;;e
Bowl, but I'll still take Stanford.
Also UCLA, Notre Dame, and
Ohio State and give points.
"It was a wonderful effort," km id
Chuck Taylor. The players, the
rooting" section, and SC knew it was
a wonderful effort. But nobody
knew more than the team that they
pay off on more than effort when it
comes to football games with SC.
The rewards and the roses are
handed out fiom what it says on the
scoreboard. And Saturday the score
board said 21-7 Trojans. Stanford
wanted to win desperately, playt I
to the hilt, deserved at least a tie,
but made a couple of mistakes and
lost. As Bill Tarr said, "It kills mt."
Saturday afternoon in the Sta
dium, Stanford was as good a foot
ball team as Southern California.
For three quarters the Indians were
better, although it wasn't until the
fourth quarter that the Tribe scored.
STRATEGY
Taylor's strategy was ball control.
That plan put Jerry Gustafson in at
quarterback and John Brodie on the
bench. And for three quarters it
worked. It worked if you don't
count the fumbles and the untimely
penalties.
With Tarr ripping through gaping
holes in the SC line, the Indians
marched deep into Trojan territory
four times. The only time Stanford
hit pay dirt during the first three
quarters—a 42-yard pass from Gus
tafson to John Neff — a penalty
rubbed it out.
Meanwhile Orlando Ferrante and
Gordon Duvall had plopped on In
dian fumbles deep in Stanford tci
ritory. Jim "Rip Sewell" Contralto
heaved his blooper ball twice ovei
hapless Card defenders to make the
most of both opportunities.
FOURTH QUARTER SCORES
The teams traded well - earned
sustained drives for fourth-quartei
scores. The Trojan ground game
was consistent for the first time
against Indian reserves. Brodie
whipped seven completed passes in
nine tries through Troy's substitute
secondary.
The Big Red line was pushing the
Trojan forward wall almost at will
in the first half. Down out
passes to John Stewart were spread
ing the secondary. Tarr was batter -
ing for yardage. One good fast
back and Troy would have been out
of it.
The Indians didn't get the break .
while it still counted. The injury
to Jerry Goldberg hurt the Cards
badly. Junior Don Geddes, who
played a spirited bang-up game on


TARR TOE TACKLE—Stanford fullback Bill Tarr is tripped up in Saturday's USC game by
Gordon Duvall as the Trojan defender manages to grab hold of his toe. The action was in the first
guarter of the game, which the Trojans won, 21-7. Tarr had an outstanding day as a runner, net
