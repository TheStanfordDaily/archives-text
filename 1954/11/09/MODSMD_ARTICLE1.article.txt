# ASSU FINAL ELECTIONS
## Constitutional Amendment, 7 Offices to Be Decided 
### 
Seven ASSU offices and a constitutional amendment will bo de
cided Thursday and Friday in the fall quarter final elections.
The offices which are to be filled are freshman class president,
secretary-treasurer, and Executive Committee representative; one
position on Women's Council; two positions on Men's Council; and

treasurer of the Graduate Students'
Association.
The constitutional amendment
would put the Interfratcrnity Coun
cil in charge of all fraternity dis
ciplinary action, replacing the In
terfratcrnity Board of Control.
The proposed amendment to Ar
ticle IV, section 3, of the ASSU con
stitution reads Â«ls follows:
"The Interfraternity Council shall
hear and judge all cases involving a
fraternity or fraternities, and such
other cases involving fraternity
members as Men's Council may
deem appropriate for judgment by
the Council."
This amendment would change
the wording of the current constitu
tion in two places: "Interfraternity
Council" would be substituted for
"Interfraternity Board of Control"
and"Council" would be substituted
for "Board."
The IFC has been handling its
own judiciary cases since last spring
when President Wallace Sterling
gave his approval to the plan.
The amendment requires a two
thirds majority to pass.
Anne Powell, Election Board
chairman, announced that campaign
expense accounts are due in the
ASSU office tomorrow by noon. The
sum of expenses for the primary and
the final elections may not exceed
$10.
