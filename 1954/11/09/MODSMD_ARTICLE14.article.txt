LEARNING TO TALKâ€”The Stanford graduate student pictured here is a member of the staff of
the Children's Health Council in Palo Alto, an organization designed to help children suffering
from any type of physical or mental handicap. The child is learning how to speak through use of
the puppet as a motivator. The Council, and children like the boy above, will receive benefits of
40 per cent of Stanford contributions to the fall quarter drive.
