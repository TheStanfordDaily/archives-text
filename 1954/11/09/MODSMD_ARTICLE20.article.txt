WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 (UP) -
Russia and the United States ex
changed angry protests today over
the destruction Sunday of an Amer
ican B-29 map-making photo plane
off the coast of Japan.
A U.S. note delivered in Moscow
charged that, the plane was shot
down by two Russian MIGs "over
Japanese territory" and demanded
that die Soviet Union make every
"moral and material reparation"
within its power.
The sharp note of protest was filed
in Moscow by U.S. Ambassador
Charles E. Bohlen amid demands in
Congress for drastic action- to pre
vent "trigger happy" Russian pilots
from shooting more American planes
from the skies.
Moscow chargcd in a note of its
own that the plane had "violated"
Soviet air space over the Kurile
Islands north of Japan and then
opened fire when the two MIGs
sought to intercept.
The U.S. note made no mention of
who fired first. But reports from
Tokyo said the Russian fighters
opened fire in an unprovoked attack.
