Chuck Taylor, coach, prophet, gentleman,
and a public relations asset, will be feted by the
Class of '55 Sunday at Rickey's. The senior
class is paying homage to the Stanford grid
chief lor tv/o reasons.
Cue is that the class began its college book
learning career at the same time Chuck started
off on his varsity coaching career. The class
fee).; that it owes Chuck something for the many
exciting football moments he's provided in the
four year span.
The second reason is that Chuck deserves
to be recognized for the outstanding job he's
done. With limited personnel, because of the
University's rigid academic requirements, he's
turned out colorful, if not always winning,
clubs. Win, lose, or draw he's always upheld
the dignity of his profession managing a good
word and smile even in the darkest of situa
tions. He's always retained that genuine quali
ty of sportsmanship.
Stanford hasn't found itself in a drought for
wins either during his reign. He took over the

Stanford machine like an untried mechanic,
assembled the parts, provided the spark and I
drove the Big Red to the Rose Bowl.
Season after season he has confounded the
experts by winning the games that he said
Stanford shouldn't be playing. He's always
been good copy for newsmen, because of his !
colorful chatter whether it be predicting a 21-
13 victory over Oregon or describing how he
caught a pass in the UCLA tilt.
Well liked by his squad, he's met success by
adapting the plays to the players and not the
players to the plays. He's quick to spot a play-!
er's potential and doesn't ask the impossible.
Assuredly, as the standing joke goes, he builds
character, but he also builds good ball teams, j
Sunday, Chuck's teammates of the Rose
Bowl '40 team will join with Ernie Nevers, Dink
Templeton, Frankie Albert, members of the ad
ministration and faculty, and students from all
classes in honoring their football standard

It's a worthwhile undertaking, and, we might
add, its about time.
