### JACK BYRNE 
At hist, by all that's holy, it's started to rain. And
this. I think, is a mood thing.
1 approve very highly of rain. For one thing, it
nsak- s every one else's car so dirty that I don't feel
quit so embarrassed about the way mine looks.

Anolh i- cogent point is that it
,"/ashes the air out. Representa
ives of the greater Los Angeles
irea need not read further, but I
:ibmit th. i the Office of the Reg
trai should insert the following
jage in the Reg Book:
AM I-SMOG PLEDGE
1 realizing that
ino'j is a menace to health and
iappin<\' \ pledge myself to the
ibolishmc-nt of smog; and swear

that 1 am not now, have never been, never intend to
he, (cross my heart and hope to die), in favor of smog.
Tiii. ( will sign, along with the Library Oath and
what not.
Run. I have decided, is highly beneficial when the
air tak< >n that tan cast. And let's face it: that stuff
!i. . ir over the Stadium last Saturday wasn't the
rootj." section for St. Peter's Tech. That was lousy,
tin!. int ii(.- good, plain old fashioned smog. Whether
Ki:;u(" hi Subnormal brought it along or not is not de
11.'' 112i 1 '- li' re. The fact remains that the smog was here,

and might yet become a regional problem.
But I started this column with the intent of ap
plauding rain. Rain, the scientists tell us, is water.
Lagunita (when full), some assert, is water. Between
these two there is a correlation of -1- 1.
Despite those who claim La' imita is filled with
slime in lieu of water, it appears that it is water that
is put into the lake in winter time.
And it don't rain, we don't get no water in no
lake. It's that simple.
The lake is very handy. Those who object to show
ers have been known to swim in it; thus it renders a
community service. Those who are annoyed by
women find that it is handy for burling aforementioned
women into. (Always end a sentence a preposition
with). Thus, if the women drown, it may serve yet
another community service.
But best of all it's damn handy for i . ing quarter,
when you can't quite get interested in the books, to
go up to the lake and paddle about in a canoe all
afternoon.
But you have to have v/ah r in the lake.
And then you've got to have rain so you can have
water.
Ergo, for the above reasons, I'm glad it's settled
down to rain. And I'm hopii; < for many more inches
of rain.
Besides, it's handy for convei t ; on.
