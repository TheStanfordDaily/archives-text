# Rest Homes Offer 'Peace And Quiet'
## 
### GERRY SMITH 
"Peace and quiet —it's won
derful!"
And since 1928 that's what
the Men's and Women's Rest
Homes, operated by the Stan
ford Mothers Club, have provid
ed for the campus.
The two old houses, nestled among
the trees along Salvatierra, accom
modate those students who are ill
and need to get away from noise and
their companions.
Students with colds, mild infec
tions, poison oak, laryngitis, pleu
risy, bronchitis, minor athletic in
juries, ajid convalescents from hos
pitals are admitted through the
Health Service. Costs are taken care
of 'by the $5 Health Service fee per
quarter for each student. Conta
gious disease cases are taken to the
I.solation Hospital for treatment.
Both rest homes are run in much
the same way. There are no visitors,
except for the patient's family and
possibly -a sponsor. Usually no ra
dios or typewriters are permitted. A
Health Service doctor calls every
day to check patients and to dismiss
those no longer in need of treatment.
Each rest home has its own cook
and nurse-director; the Men's Rest
Home also has a hasher. The ca
pacity of the Women's Rest Home is
10; the men's, 11. About 3GO women
a year enter the rest home and
about 420 men.
A director, chosen by the Mother?,'
Club with Health Service approval,
procures food and help and is, in
turn, paid per patient by the Uni
versity. The Women's Rest Horrre is
owned and operated by the Mothers'
Club, while the men's is leased from
the University and operated b.v the
Mothers' Club. The Mothers' Club
pays for laundry, supplies, tele
phone, utilities, and any other main
tenance.
The rest homes were the first and
chief project of the Mothers" Club.
They began when near-by mothers,
who had been taking ailing students
into their own homes to recuperate,
realized that some place was needed
where students could stay during
the period between hospital care and
complete recovery. Thus the rest
homes began and have operated
continuously, although not at the
present locations, since 19'28.
Mrs. Effie Murray has been, the
Women's Rest Home director since
1937. The only other director before
her Was Mrs. Lillian Owen, who ran

the home from its beginnings till
1937. Since 1946 Mrs. E. M. Hoag
land has been the Men's Rest Home
director. Several others, including
Mrs. C. G. Allen, who still lives on
campus, preceded her.
Besides maintaining the rest
homes, the Mothers' Club has sev
eral other projects, including two
University scholarships, several oth
er scholarships, and emei'gency help
with things such as expensive medi
cal treatment and wardrobe prob
lems arising with foreign students.
The Mothers' Club has an annual in
come of over $11,000, and its 3,310
members come from all over the
world, wherever there are Stanford
students.*
