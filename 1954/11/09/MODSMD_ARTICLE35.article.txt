# WOMEN'S SOCIAL REGULATIONS
## Present System Approved in 1949 
### TACY ANN SMITH 
(Editor's note: This is the second of a series of four articles on Men's
and Women's Councils.)

The present women's social regulations do not have a long
history as part of Stanford life. In fact, they were initiated only
five years ago in January, 1949.
Before 1949, when the present Demerit System was introduced,
a system of lock-ins, fines, and other penalties was in effect.

j Violations under both systems were
classified as lock-outs, offenses, and
| technicals.
Under the old system, a woman
had to appear before her house
committee after every violation, and
the house committee could impose
a penalty of one or more lock-ins,
and a lecture. Women's Council had
the power to give a woman any
number of lock-ins, or put her on
J social probation for having accumu
j lated a large number of violations,
j or suspend her. No definite line was
! drawn as to when a woman could be
put on social probation or sus
pended, but the decision was left to
Council's judgment. Women had to
appear before Women's Council af
ter they had received seven techni
cals, a 60-rninute lock-out, or three
offenses.
Under the old system, a symphony
season ticket holder was eligible for
special symphony late leaves after
clearing through Women's Council.
Late leaves were on a weekly quota,
with only a few "floaters," thus the
necessity for special clearance.
The Dement Flan was introduced
to give the women more responsi
bility and to promote a uniform
( penalty system. The system would
be based on an accumulative record
j which carried through the women
students ' undergraduate years.
Women's Council would act as an
educative body and an appellate
court.
DEMERITS DEFINED
Demerits were defined as a total
of three offenses, eight technicals, a
late return of 30 minutes, or up to
five lock-outs totaling 30 minutes.
It was decided that upon accumula
tion of four demerits, a woman
would appear before Women's
Council for possible social probation,
and at the five demerit level, she
would be liable for suspension.
The individual was given the right

to appeal her case to the Council at
any time, unci area committees could
refer cases to Women's Council. It
was also decided that any violations
incurred by guests would go on the
hostess' record.
Penalties from house committees,
and lock-ins and fines were discon
tinued under the more uniform De
merit System. The bonus system,
which gave a woman 15 minutes
which could be used for an emer
gency late return without lock-out
minutes, was incorporated into the
Demerit System.
SYSTEM VOIDED
The Demerit System was proposed
in winter quarter of 194S by Wom
en's Council, which put the plan into
effect. But because the plan was
not passed through AWS, the De
merit System was said to be legally
void, and the old system had to be
reinstated until the new plan could
be passed through AWS.
In January, 1949, the Demerit
System was passed by AWS, and
voted in by the women at house
meetings. This action officially in
stalled the present system of social
regulations.
The Social Regulations Commit
tee has become a standing commit
tee of AWS; it recommends changes
in the social regulations to AWS
Cabinet and Board. As a six-mem
ber committee, headed this year by
Renee Reed, the group works with
Women's Council in constantly eval
uating the present system. They put
out the Social Standards booklet for
women students, and revise it from
time to time as new regulations are
needed or old ones become out
dated.

special symphony late leaves after
clearing through Women's Council.
Late leaves were on a weekly quota,
with only a few "floaters," thus the
necessity for special clearance.
The Dement Flan was introduced
to give the women more responsi
bility and to promote a uniform
( penalty system. The system would
be based on an accumulative record
j which carried through the women
students ' undergraduate years.
Women's Council would act as an
educative body and an appellate
court.
DEMERITS DEFINED
Demerits were defined as a total
of three offenses, eight technicals, a
late return of 30 minutes, or up to
five lock-outs totaling 30 minutes.
It was decided that upon accumula
tion of four demerits, a woman
would appear before Women's
Council for possible social probation,
and at the five demerit level, she
would be liable for suspension.
The individual was given the right

to appeal her case to the Council at
any time, unci area committees could
refer cases to Women's Council. It
was also decided that any violations
incurred by guests would go on the
hostess' record.
Penalties from house committees,
and lock-ins and fines were discon
tinued under the more uniform De
merit System. The bonus system,
which gave a woman 15 minutes
which could be used for an emer
gency late return without lock-out
minutes, was incorporated into the
Demerit System.
SYSTEM VOIDED
The Demerit System was proposed
in winter quarter of 194S by Wom
en's Council, which put the plan into
effect. But because the plan was
not passed through AWS, the De
merit System was said to be legally
void, and the old system had to be
reinstated until the new plan could
be passed through AWS.
In January, 1949, the Demerit
System was passed by AWS, and
voted in by the women at house
meetings. This action officially in
stalled the present system of social
regulations.
The Social Regulations Commit
tee has become a standing commit
tee of AWS; it recommends changes
in the social regulations to AWS
Cabinet and Board. As a six-mem
ber committee, headed this year by
Renee Reed, the group works with
Women's Council in constantly eval
uating the present system. They put
out the Social Standards booklet for
women students, and revise it from
time to time as new regulations are
needed or old ones become out
dated.
(Editor's note: This is the second of a series of four articles on Men's
and Women's Councils.)

The present women's social regulations do not have a long
history as part of Stanford life. In fact, they were initiated only
five years ago in January, 1949.
Before 1949, when the present Demerit System was introduced,
a system of lock-ins, fines, and other penalties was in effect.

j Violations under both systems were
classified as lock-outs, offenses, and
| technicals.
Under the old system, a woman
had to appear before her house
committee after every violation, and
the house committee could impose
a penalty of one or more lock-ins,
and a lecture. Women's Council had
the power to give a woman any
number of lock-ins, or put her on
J social probation for having accumu
j lated a large number of violations,
j or suspend her. No definite line was
! drawn as to when a woman could be
put on social probation or sus
pended, but the decision was left to
Council's judgment. Women had to
appear before Women's Council af
ter they had received seven techni
cals, a 60-rninute lock-out, or three
offenses.
