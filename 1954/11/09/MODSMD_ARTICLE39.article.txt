# Taylor, Bronzan Shed Tears About Coming Card-SJS Game
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
The crying towels were out yesterday at the weekly luncheon
of the Northern California Football Writers. Both Stanford coach
Chuck Taylor and San Jose State mentor Bob Bronzan complained
about this week's game at Stanford Stadium.
"For years," Bronzan said, "we've come up to Stanford hoping

to knock them off. But every sea
son they roll all over us. This year
it's going to be different. We're com
ing up to enjoy the game. I'll just

sit back and relax. The team may
not even wear padding—may play
in sweatsuits."
The Spartan mentor was lament
ing the loss to COP last weekend.
"They played better football than
we," he said, "and deserved to win."
One of the main troubles the San
Jose Staters have faced this year,
he said, was their visiting schedule.
The Spartans played their first game
of the season at home, before school
opened. They since have played at
Berkeley, Moscow (Idaho), Tempe
(Arizona), Eugene (Oregon), Den
ton (Texas), and Stockton. A week
from Saturday they face Fresno
State in their second home game .of
the year.
DIDN'T RECOGNIZE TEAM
"We wore the usual visiting white
uniforms at Stockton, and when we
came out on the field. I heard some
of our rooters booing, thinking we
were the COP team. That shows
how little they've seen us. And it's
been tough on our team playing in
a strange stadium every week."
Despite the fact the Stanford game
is a road tilt, this is homecoming
week for the Spartans.
"We won't be looking ahead to
Cal," Coach Chuck Taylor said.
"'Despite Bronzan's pessimism, we
have a high respect for San Jose.
We're not taking them lightly. We're
not in a position to take them light
ly.
"The have a' great -1,-Ine,
and line pafes receivers. We look for
a good game this weekend. We'need
a win badly.'* > . »<
FEW BUT COSTLY MISTAKES
Taylor repeated to the writers
that he was pleased with the Card
effort against USC. Though the team
made a few mistakes, he said, there
were some definite improvements.
"The mistakes were fewer, but
they were more crucial ones. I was
pleased with John Neff, Dick Ger
gen, Don Geddes, and Win Wedge.
Offensively, I like Bill Tarr's running
and John Stewart's pass catching."
The coach said Stanford suffered
no injuries in tfie contest. Guards
Don Manoukian and Roy Kricke
berg are out for the season.
