(Editor's note: This is the last
of a series of articles on the Na
tional Students Association. Pete
Bing, ASSU student body presi
| dent, points out some of the weak
nesses and limitations of NSA.)
"I seriously question," said
Bing, jn discussing the advis
ability of Stanford renewing its
membership in NSA, "with the
setup and operational principles
under which NSA now works,
whether our effort and money
could be utilized to best advant
ages."
Bing stated that his objections to
NSA lay not in its ideals, but in the
methods of carrying them out â€”
methods which were necessary be
cause of the organization of NSA.
Stanford's role in NSA, according
to the student body president, would
be much more of a giving than a
receiving one. "I don't feel that this
should be considered a basis for not
joining," he cautioned, "since we are
often members of organizations to
which we give much more than we
get.
"But if the situation is such that
it involves a utilization of contribu
tions, then it is questionable wheth
er our investment in effort and mon
ey could not be made where it would
accomplish more, such as our for
eign scholar program."
BROADER ASPECTS
Turning his attention to the
broader aspects of NSA, Bing ex
pressed disappointment in their cen
tral co-ordination, saying "though
they attempt to serve as a central
clearing house for all university
questions and problems, we have re
ceived numerous inquiries this year
directly from schools active and
powerful in NSA."
The student body president also
pointed out that one of the main
phases of NSA's international pro
gram is taking foreign students on
tours of the United States. He se
riously questioned the value of the
"touring parties of VlP's" as com
pared with resident exchange pro
grams such as the Fui bright grants
and Stanford's own foreign scholar
program.
"I truly don't feel that NSA should
work as a lobby in Washington.
D.C.," Bing added. "They represent
all the member colleges, when they
really don't have a chance to con
sult all members on individual is
sues."
SUMMER CONFERENCE
Commenting on the summer con
ference at Ames, lowa, Bing said his
overall impression was that "here
was a group of people earnest in
their ideals, but completely lacking
in practical discipline to carry them
out."
As an example of this lack of dis
cipline, he cited the fact that meet
ings usually started one to 2Vz hours
late, with so many of the 600 dele
gates absent that often barely a
quorum was present.
"The last day of the conference,"
Bing recalled, "all of the delegates
were expressly told to be at the
meeting hall at 8 a.m. sharp for
election of officers. I got there at
8:10 and found three people. Only
two of these three had votes. The
third was the janitor."
"Actually," Bing "this
whole problem of NSA membership \
boils down to a value judgment, j
We must decide whether NSA in its
present condition actually justifies
the enormous expenditure of time
and finances. I am not convinced
that, it does.
"But, together, we must find a
definite solution, make a decision,
and then give that decision our full
I support."
