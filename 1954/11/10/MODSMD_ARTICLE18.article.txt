# From Governor Lee of Utah
## 
### 
Today The Daily is turning its editorial space
over to Governor J. Bracken Lee of Utah.
Governor Lee was in the news recently for
refusing to proclaim United Nations Day in
Utah. Instead he designated October 24, the
date of international observance of the ninth
anniversary of the United Nations, as United
States Day.
Stanford student Phil Berman wrote Governor
Lee protesting his decision, enclosing in his
letter the Daily editorial which criticized Cali
fornia Governor Goodwin Knight for similarly
refusing to proclaim United Nations Day.
The personal reply sent to Mr. Berman by
Governor Lee is printed verbatim below, along
with quotes from an editorial in the New York
Daily News which the governor uses to sub
stantiate his viewpoint.
The letter and the Daily News editorial speak
for themselves.
We will be satisfied if they jolt the Stanford
student into a deeper realization of the import
ance of expressing his opinion on national and
international issues. Otherwise public officials
such as Governor Lee and papers such as the
Daily News will presume to speak for us all.

Dear Mr. Berman:
1 appreciate your letter of October 26, con
cerning my refusal to proclaim United Na
tions Day. I think if is worth observing that
you and others are able to object to my action
just as vociferously as you wish to. This
same situation would not apply, hov/ever, if
you resided in the Soviet Union which is no
respecter of freedom of speech, freedom of
religion, and the other freedoms we enjoy.
Despite this, however, ihe Soviet Union is
a member of the United Nations and holds the
power of veto in the Security Council.
All is not well with the United Nations, as
the enclosed reprints of recent United Na
tions articles make clear. I am certain that all
of us will agree that world peace is a desir
able objective, but there may be a great dif
ference of opinion as to (he means to attain
this end.
The Soviet-sponsored Peace Conference of
a few years back, for example, merited no
support whatsoevei from the good people of
this Country. We saw that effort as merely a
Communist front and that the sponsors of
the move were not sincere in their actions.

The United Nations effort in Korea, from
my standpoint, was nothing less than a dis
grace. The subsequent criticism of this ef
fort by such U.N. commanders as Mac Arthur,
Van Fleet and Clark fully substantiates my
view. I think that Korea is typical of the com
promising nature of the U.N., and unfortu
nately most of the compromises have been
made to appease the Communist nations.
When reference to God was omitted from
the U.N. Charter, it was simply a gesture to
ward Russia, and 1 think a most ill-advised
one.'
Although your newspaper has taken the
official position in favor of the United Nations,
there are other newspapers throughout the
country —perhaps not in the schools, how
ever—which are taking a dissenting view.
Enclosed is a copy of an editorial from the
New York Daily News which is a good ex
ample of this.
1 might add that the fact that college and
university newspapers are pro-U.N. is not so
much a tribute to the thinking of these
schools as it is a compliment to the effective
propaganda behind the U.N.
Sincerely,
J. BRACKEN LEE
Governor, of Utah
The last half of the Daily News editorial of
October 23 cited by Governor Lee is as follows:
"It happens that day before yesterday in the
U.N. General Assembly the latest evidence was
unveiled of what a dangerous nuisance this
would-be superstate is.
"The Assembly allowed Red Czechoslovakia
to put on the agenda a debate on a communist
sponsored resolution concerning 'prohibition
of propaganda in favor of a new war'.
"Communists around the world continually
howl that the United States is making such
propaganda.
"When debate comes on, the United States
will of course be given time to defend itself
against this charge. But the Red delegates will
hammer on it as long as the chair will allow.
As for nine years past, they will be able to use
the U.N. as a worldwide sounding-board for
their hate propaganda against the United States.
"We hope it will be a lot les3 than nine years
before this country has the common sense to
take itself out of the U.N.—and hurray for
United States Day, and the hell with United
Nations Day."

The last half of the Daily News editorial of
October 23 cited by Governor Lee is as follows:
"It happens that day before yesterday in the
U.N. General Assembly the latest evidence was
unveiled of what a dangerous nuisance this
would-be superstate is.
"The Assembly allowed Red Czechoslovakia
to put on the agenda a debate on a communist
sponsored resolution concerning 'prohibition
of propaganda in favor of a new war'.
"Communists around the world continually
howl that the United States is making such
propaganda.
"When debate comes on, the United States
will of course be given time to defend itself
against this charge. But the Red delegates will
hammer on it as long as the chair will allow.
As for nine years past, they will be able to use
the U.N. as a worldwide sounding-board for
their hate propaganda against the United States.
"We hope it will be a lot les3 than nine years
before this country has the common sense to
take itself out of the U.N.—and hurray for
United States Day, and the hell with United
Nations Day."
Today The Daily is turning its editorial space
over to Governor J. Bracken Lee of Utah.
Governor Lee was in the news recently for
refusing to proclaim United Nations Day in
Utah. Instead he designated October 24, the
date of international observance of the ninth
anniversary of the United Nations, as United
States Day.
Stanford student Phil Berman wrote Governor
Lee protesting his decision, enclosing in his
letter the Daily editorial which criticized Cali
fornia Governor Goodwin Knight for similarly
refusing to proclaim United Nations Day.
The personal reply sent to Mr. Berman by
Governor Lee is printed verbatim below, along
with quotes from an editorial in the New York
Daily News which the governor uses to sub
stantiate his viewpoint.
The letter and the Daily News editorial speak
for themselves.
We will be satisfied if they jolt the Stanford
student into a deeper realization of the import
ance of expressing his opinion on national and
international issues. Otherwise public officials

Dear Mr. Berman:
1 appreciate your letter of October 26, con
cerning my refusal to proclaim United Na
tions Day. I think if is worth observing that
you and others are able to object to my action
just as vociferously as you wish to. This
same situation would not apply, hov/ever, if
you resided in the Soviet Union which is no
respecter of freedom of speech, freedom of
religion, and the other freedoms we enjoy.
Despite this, however, ihe Soviet Union is
a member of the United Nations and holds the
power of veto in the Security Council.
All is not well with the United Nations, as
the enclosed reprints of recent United Na
tions articles make clear. I am certain that all
of us will agree that world peace is a desir
able objective, but there may be a great dif
ference of opinion as to (he means to attain
this end.
