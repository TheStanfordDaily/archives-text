# Scholarship, Activity, Character Required for Cap and Gown
## 
### GERRY SMITH 
Almost 50 years ago Cap and
Gown, the senior women's hon
or society, took its place among
student organizations at Stan
ford. Then and today its main
objective is to further the ideals
and interests of Stanford women.
Membership in Cap and Gown is
based on scholarship, activities, and
character. To be considered for
membership a student must have a
2.5 grade average, be active in at
least one organization, and possess
outstanding character.
A procession of black-robed fig
ures moves through women's resi
dences twice a year for the tapping
ceremony by which membership in
Cap and Gown is revealed to the
women chosen. Eight juniors are
tapped during spring quarter. Only
seniors are tapped during fall.
Present members of the group,
tapped last spring, are Ann Irvine,
president; Maureen Maxwell, vice

president; Nancy Lindsay, secretary;
Nt'l McDill, treasurer; Jean Read;
Claire Van Sickle; Jean McClure;
and Pat King.

There is an alumnae group in this
area with an advisory board headed
by Mrs. Jack Shoup. Mrs. Olive
Cook and Mrs. Barbara Pandy are
the group's advisers. Honorary Cap
and Gown members are chosen from
time to time from amon" women
members of the faculty and wives of
faculty members.
Cap and Gown raises money each
year by selling Cap and Gown Stan
ford Calendars and cookies. It also
sponsors a service project yearly.
This year's project has not yet been
picked.
Proceeds from the projects are
used for two scholarships. One is
given to a foreign student and the
other is awarded to a resident of
the United States. Recipients this
year are Musharof (Muni) Soofi
from Pakistan and Dotty Durham
from Menlo Park.
Founded in the spring of 1906, Cap

and Gown was reorganized after
that year's earthquake and became
active that fall. The first group was
limited to 12 members. At that time
there were approximately 250 to 300
women students at Stanford.
At the time of its founding the
requirements for membership were
a B average, prominence in at least
one field of campus activity, and ex
cellent character. It was first formed
for the purpose of bringing together
women who were particularly active
in only one organization and ac
quainting thenv with each other.
One of Cap and Gown's first proj
ects was the present Women's Club
house. They felt that Stanford wom
en needed a place for club meetings
and general social gatherings, so
plans for the Clubhouse swung into
action.
Cap and Gown members each
pledged a certain sum of money to
be. contributed to the Clubhouse
fund. This money was earned by
doing odd jobs, not given as gifts
from parents.
