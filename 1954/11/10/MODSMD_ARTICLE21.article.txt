The role of Mens Council has
become much stronger at Stan
ford in the past few years, fol
lowing its curtailment of activity
during the war.
The Council is assuming new edu
cative responsibilities on the cam
pus and in the Stanford area.
Bob Margolis, chairman of Men's
Council, said, "The educative role
of the Council is an area in which
we are growing, and are working on
constantly."
A new responsibility given Men's
Council this year is trying men's
Fundamental Standard cases. Most
of these cases come to the attention
of the Council through the local and
campus police, who report behavior
in violation of the Fundamental

Standard.
In the Stanford area, the campus
police are responsible to Men's
Council for reporting illegal drink
ing on the campus and vicinity.
The penalties for men's Funda
mental Standard violations range
from Con Home hours to suspension.
This year, the penalties are being
discussed by the Council to see
whether they are adequate.
The chairman of Men's Council
meets regularly with the Dean of
Students to discuss Council policies,
and to review penalty decisions
which have been recommended to
the administration.
Men's Council handles all traffic
violations on the campus, both men's
and women's. They function jointly
with Women's Council as the Coun
cil for Student Control in hearing
Honor Code and Election Board vio
lations.
The educative policy of Men's
Council extends beyond the stu

dents. The Council chairman has
opportunities to speak to local busi
ness groups, the Stanford Mothers'
Club, and other organizations.
Men's Council is composed of five
members. There is an ex-officio
member on Interfraternity Council,
one on Fundamental Standard Com
mittee, and one on Honor Code
Committee.
The chairman of Men's Council is
Bob Margolis, and John Ayres is
secretary. The other members are
Keith Brownsberger, Fundamental
Standard Committee representative;
Rod Hall, IFC representative; and
Don Patman, Honor Code Commit
tee representative.
Two new members will be elected
to Men's Council in the ASSU elec
tions this week to replace outgoing
members Bob Margolis and Rod
Hall. A new chairman will be elect
ed from among the old members,
and he will serve winter and spring
quarters.
