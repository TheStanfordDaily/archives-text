# CAMPUS OPINION

To the Editor:
It has come to my attention that
Prince Lightfoot, our faithful team
mascot, is regrettably not reim
bursed for his many hours and dol
lars annually spent by him person
ally for his appearance at all our
games—both at home and away.
Even though he does not ask to be
paid for his services, it seems very
disgraceful to me that neither some
one nor some organization in this
University does not offer to allocate
funds to cover his expenses. Why
cannot ASSU come forward and re
lieve this shameful situation? If
ASSU ie strapped for funds, then
why cannot the Director of Athletics
present him complimentary tickets
to the games—not just home games,
but all games?
He is allowed to enter free of
charge as a participant; but if he
wants to bring his mother along, he
must purchase her a ticket.
Some critics may aVgue that it Was

he who came forward and offered
his services free, and that it is a
privilege for him to be able to rep
resent our University.
But, instead, we must remember
that after his initial offer, it was the
students themselves who voiced the
request for his presence at all our
games; and indeed it is a privilege
for Stanford to have his services.
Why should he sacrifice his per
sonal time, possibly impair his em
ployment relations, and spend his

money to represent a University of
which he is not even an alumnus?
I think that it is only fitting and
right that Stanford should in some
way try to thank Prince Lightfoot
for his faithful representation of our
University. If we cannot find the
money to reimburse him, then it
seems to me that at least he de
serves a complimentary ticket or
two. There are only 90,000 seats in
Stanford Stadium.
