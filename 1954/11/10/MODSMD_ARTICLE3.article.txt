## Mass Poverty World Problem Says Speaker 
### RALPH CAHN 
"The extreme contrast be
tween the modern West and un
derdeveloped nations cannot ex
ist much longer," stressed Dr.
Eugene Staley last night in a
lecture on our state and under
developed countries.
Speaking from the Tuesday Series
rostrum, Dr. Staley went on to say
that "today wc face a new situa
tionâ€”peoples outside the Western
world have until now enjoyed little
of the benefits, but either the bene
fits of better developed countries
will become available in the non-
Western world, or they are going to
be lost, to the whole world."
An underdeveloped country, Sta
ley explained, is one which ex
periences chronic mass poverty.
Three-fifths of the world's popula
tion fits into this category. "In un
derdeveloped countries, length of
life is much shorter, there arc about
one-sixth the number of doctors as
there are in highly developed coun
tries . . . perhaps one person in four
knows how to read and write.
"Lack of education, low income
level, poverty, and poor health form
a vicious circle, and one of the key
problems in underdeveloped coun
tries is to reverse this cycle.
'"We must be careful not to as
sume that countries which are mak
ing gains economically and socially
are free from the threat of Commu
nism; we must avoid the thought
that tanks and guns alone can pre
vent the spread of Communism."
Staley pointed out that no coun
try can do the development for an
other nation. "More than 95 per
cent of what gets done in these
countries has to be done by the
people themselves."
"The temptation to play God is
great for a country our size," he
concluded, "but wc don't know all
the answers."
