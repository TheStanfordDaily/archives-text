UCLA's Bruins, heading for their
first unbeaten season in history, are
the number one college football
team in the nation, according to the
three press polls announced yester
day.
The Bruins, who only need to de
feat USC a week from Saturday to
complete an all-victorious year, are
atop the United Press, Associated
Press, and International News Serv
ice rankings.
UCLA was only 12 points short of
a perfect score in the UP poll, as
they polled 2''8 out of a possible 250
first-place points.
Following the Bruins in all three
ratings were Ohio State, Oklahoma,

Arkansas, and Notre Dame. USC
was ranked seventh by the INS, and
eighth by the AP and UP.
