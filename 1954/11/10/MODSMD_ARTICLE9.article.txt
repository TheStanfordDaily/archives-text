## Decision Needed Tonight 
### 
Stanford's membership in the National Stu
dents Association will again be discussed by
the Executive Committee tonight.
For the past six weeks NSA co-ordinator A 1
Loomis and NSA regional vice-president A 1
Ivey have presented short summaries of NSA
activities to the Executive Committee and in
terested living groups and organizations.
For six weeks the reports of the seven dele
gates to the summer NSA national convention
have been on file in the ASSU office, available
to anyone upon request.
For six weeks the Executive Committee has
delayed a final vote on NSA, waiting until Ex
com members were better informed on NSA,
waiting until the campus learned more about
NSA, waiting to discover what campus opinion
was on NSA.
The time for decision has come.
This weekend several Stanford students will
attend the California-Nevada-Hawaii regional
conference at UCLA.
It has been argued that their role at this con
ference will be the same whether or not Stan
ford is a member of NSA or even if the issue is
still undecided.
That is ridiculous. Stanford delegates have
the right to know if they can commit Stanford
to regional plans, if they can promise Stan
ford's backing of future projects, if they can
safely run for a regional office.
If Stanford has rejoined NSA, their position
will be clear. If Stanford has voted not to renew
membership, they will be able to act as rep
resentatives observing NSA activities and of
fering suggestions but not taking part officially
as voting members.
If no decision on NSA has been made, these

delegates will be pushed into the absurd po
sition of not knowing where they stand or
where they are going.
This will in turn disrupt the entire NSA
region. Other member schools will hesitate to
count on Stanford support or to elect Stanford
students to regional offices. Likewise they will
be reluctant to rule out the university which is
the main strength behind the northern Cali
fornia district.
We owe it to NSA to decide what we want
to do.
ft has also been argued that all the informa
tion presented to the Executive Committee has
been favorable towards NSA, and that several
students wish to present negative viewpoints.
We would suggest that all those who dis
agree with the programs and principles of NSA,
or v/ho feel that Stanford's best interests would
be served by staying outside NSA, present
their views to the Executive Committee tonight.
Their opinions must be heard.
But if the Executive Committee postpones a
final vote for another six weeks while negative
reports are given, winter quarter will be here.
At that point it won't much ,matter what they
decide, because for all practical purposes, Stan
ford will be lost to NSA for the remainder of
the year.
If Stanford wants to participate in and con
tribute to NSA, let the Executive Committee
vote to rejoin tonight. We strongly urge that
they decide affirmatively.
If Stanford's best interests lie outside NSA,
let the Executive Committee vote not to renew
membership tonight.
Either way, the decision must be made to
night.
