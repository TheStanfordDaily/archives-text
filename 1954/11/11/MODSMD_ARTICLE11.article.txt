# Gaieties Nears Opening
## 
### JAE HUNLEY 
Five more days 'til opening
night! and tension is beginning
to build up in the rehearsals of :
the 1954 Big Game Gaieties.
Directors are finding themselves
faced with a multitude of small,
ever-present details. Where to find
a feather duster? How thick are |
tickets? And what to do when the !
dancers kick the chorus in one of j
the second-act numbers?
De-pite these little frustrations, j
Gaieties directors feel that Tuesday |
night's show is going to be a good j
one.
"We have a great cast and the j
kids are working terrifically hard," j

said Director Milton H. Cohen. "We
hould have a good show for the au
dience."
Cohen and Assistant Director
Richard Learman agreed that work
on Gaieties starts from the top
down, and that a close degree of
co-operation is necessary to put on
the performance.
This means co-operation and mu
tual trust in each other by all mem
bers because the stafT has had much
more than just prop and placing dif
ficulties.
Gaieties cast, and crew have had
to face the problem of no place to
rehearse. Pre - scheduled functions
keep driving the cast from Wood
peker Lodge to the Little Theater to
Memorial Auditorium and back
again.
Further, some of the women cast
' members do not have sufficient late
leaves to spend many late nights in
rehearsal. This results in a rush to
get their numbers rehearsed before i
1 0:30.

Students interested in working
on the Gaieties shift crew may
contact Al Gibson in the Memo
rial Auditorium back shop any
night aftrr 7:.'{ft.

However, the* potty annoyances
seem to disappear as the show pro
gresses toward Nov. 16, and Big
Game spirit grows stronger.
Gaieties workers alternate be
tween wishing that they had more
time for practice and hoping that
the opening night will come quickly.
And it will. Only five more days
to go!
