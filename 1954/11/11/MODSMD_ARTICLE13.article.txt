# Excom Okays Permanent Membership in NSA , 10-3
## Second Motion to Reconsider Affiliation Is Voted Down 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS Associate Editor, The Daily 
Stanford's permanent membership in the National Stucloni
Association was approved by a 10 to 3 vote of the Executive Com
mittee in last night's meeting.
The three dissenters were Pete Bing, student body president
Dave Gibbs, graduate representative; and Dave lenks, repre

sentative of the class of '57. Row
representative Sam Palmer was not
at the meeting.
Immediately after the vote was
cast, a moi'c to reconsider affiliation
with NSA was made by Steve Voy
kovich, graduate representative; and
supported by Bob Gable, student
manager.
They held that the motion was
"railroaded" through Excom. and
that the opposition viewpoint had
not hecn given enough time for pre
sentation.
The reconsideration" motion was
defeated 6 to 4.
LUNN SPEAKS
Before the open discussion on NSA
membership began, Harry Lunn. na
tional president of NSA, briefly
spoke 011 the benefits of the organi
zation.
"New problems, new challenges,
new concepts of community relations
arc always arising," he said. "These
challenges arc better met.in a dis
cussion with students from other
parts of the country."
He said that NSA is the "most
representative voice of the American
student," and then qualified this
statement by asserting that NSA
nolicy on any matter is not binding
on any of the member schools.
OBSERVER ROLE?
One of the issues brought out in
the discussion was whether or not
Stanford could function satisfactorily
as an NSA observer rather than as
a dues-paying member.
Amber Spinning Henninger sup
ported the observer role. "Our con
tributions will be lost in value un
less they can be effectively coordin
ated," she stated.
Refuting her argument, Al Ivey
pointed out "as a member of NSA,
Stanford will be able to contribute
more, and will be able to work ac
tively to correct sonic of NSA's
weaknesses."
INEFFICIENCY CITED
A major objection to affiliation
with NSA, as pointed out by Dave
Jenks, was inefficiency and imprac
tical ity.

"Maybe one of the biggest cau < ,
of NSA's inefficiency," he charged,
"is that it tries to do things it doesn't
really have the means to accom
plish. The other day I was talking
with an administration official, and
he inquired when NSA was going Id
having a conference with God. Its
principles are floating around on ;i
clbud, but how practical are they
really?"
Rudy Reich held that "NSA is in
efficient at times, but this is not
something that can't be helped. With
Stanford a permanent member of
NSA, we should be able to contrib
ute to its improvement."
UTILIZING NSA
The fact that Stanford has not .is
yet learned how to utilize NSA as
well as possible was pointed out by
Al Loomis, NSA co-ordinator, and
Gable.
"We haven't given NSA a fair
test," declared Gable. "We must
have better correlation between the
NSA co-ordinator and Excom. I
frankly don't think we've tried hard
enough."
Al Ix>omis agreed. "Because of
our trial basis in NSA," he added,
"wc have spent all our time telling
the students about NSA instead ot
being able to concentrate on out
activity in it."
CONTRIBUTIONS
Stanford's possible contributions
to NSA were outlined by Gable.
"The California-Nevada-Hawaii re
gion is one of the strongest in the
country, and I sec no reason why
Stanford delegates should not be
able to be elected to regional nd.
national offices.
"Year in and year out, the quality
of students at Stanford is equal to
that of students attending the be •
schools in the country. Stanford can
contribute leadership to NSA."
It was pointed out that at the
summer NSA convention in Ames,
lowa, Stanford contributed to dis
cussions on international programs,
financial systems, honor systems,
and women's social regulations.
FINANCES
Discussing the question of finances
and whether ASSU money would
be better .spent in sponsoring a cam
pus activity, Gable stated: "I ques
tion whether building up an activity
out of proportion to its position in
student government is preferable to
giving money for membership in >
national organization like NSA.
"The attitude of 'we must look out.
for ourselves first' was the attitud"
of the United States before World
War I. I do not feel that it is a
good attitude."
After Stanford was officially votcH
into NSA, Bing urged that we
"make our contributions begin right
this weekend by having the dele
gates to the UCLA regional confer
ence establish Stanford as a 1< idei
in NSA."

defeated 6 to 4.
LUNN SPEAKS
Before the open discussion on NSA
membership began, Harry Lunn. na
tional president of NSA, briefly
spoke 011 the benefits of the organi
zation.
"New problems, new challenges,
new concepts of community relations
arc always arising," he said. "These
challenges arc better met.in a dis
cussion with students from other
parts of the country."
He said that NSA is the "most
representative voice of the American
student," and then qualified this
statement by asserting that NSA
nolicy on any matter is not binding
on any of the member schools.
OBSERVER ROLE?
One of the issues brought out in
the discussion was whether or not
Stanford could function satisfactorily
as an NSA observer rather than as
a dues-paying member.
Amber Spinning Henninger sup
ported the observer role. "Our con
tributions will be lost in value un
less they can be effectively coordin
ated," she stated.
Refuting her argument, Al Ivey
pointed out "as a member of NSA,
Stanford will be able to contribute
more, and will be able to work ac
tively to correct sonic of NSA's
weaknesses."
INEFFICIENCY CITED
A major objection to affiliation
with NSA, as pointed out by Dave
Jenks, was inefficiency and imprac
tical ity.

"Maybe one of the biggest cau < ,
of NSA's inefficiency," he charged,
"is that it tries to do things it doesn't
really have the means to accom
plish. The other day I was talking
with an administration official, and
he inquired when NSA was going Id
having a conference with God. Its
principles are floating around on ;i
clbud, but how practical are they
really?"
Rudy Reich held that "NSA is in
efficient at times, but this is not
something that can't be helped. With
Stanford a permanent member of
NSA, we should be able to contrib
ute to its improvement."
UTILIZING NSA
The fact that Stanford has not .is
yet learned how to utilize NSA as
well as possible was pointed out by
Al Loomis, NSA co-ordinator, and
Gable.
"We haven't given NSA a fair
test," declared Gable. "We must
have better correlation between the
NSA co-ordinator and Excom. I
frankly don't think we've tried hard
enough."
Al Ix>omis agreed. "Because of
our trial basis in NSA," he added,
"wc have spent all our time telling
the students about NSA instead ot
being able to concentrate on out
activity in it."
CONTRIBUTIONS
Stanford's possible contributions
to NSA were outlined by Gable.
"The California-Nevada-Hawaii re
gion is one of the strongest in the
country, and I sec no reason why
Stanford delegates should not be
able to be elected to regional nd.
national offices.
"Year in and year out, the quality
of students at Stanford is equal to
that of students attending the be •
schools in the country. Stanford can
contribute leadership to NSA."
It was pointed out that at the
summer NSA convention in Ames,
lowa, Stanford contributed to dis
cussions on international programs,
financial systems, honor systems,
and women's social regulations.
FINANCES
Discussing the question of finances
and whether ASSU money would
be better .spent in sponsoring a cam
pus activity, Gable stated: "I ques
tion whether building up an activity
out of proportion to its position in
student government is preferable to
giving money for membership in >
national organization like NSA.
"The attitude of 'we must look out.
for ourselves first' was the attitud"
of the United States before World
War I. I do not feel that it is a
good attitude."
After Stanford was officially votcH
into NSA, Bing urged that we
"make our contributions begin right
this weekend by having the dele
gates to the UCLA regional confer
ence establish Stanford as a 1< idei
in NSA."

tributions will be lost in value un
less they can be effectively coordin
ated," she stated.
Refuting her argument, Al Ivey
pointed out "as a member of NSA,
Stanford will be able to contribute
more, and will be able to work ac
tively to correct sonic of NSA's
weaknesses."
INEFFICIENCY CITED
A major objection to affiliation
with NSA, as pointed out by Dave
Jenks, was inefficiency and imprac
tical ity.

"Maybe one of the biggest cau < ,
of NSA's inefficiency," he charged,
"is that it tries to do things it doesn't
really have the means to accom
plish. The other day I was talking
with an administration official, and
he inquired when NSA was going Id
having a conference with God. Its
principles are floating around on ;i
clbud, but how practical are they
really?"
Rudy Reich held that "NSA is in
efficient at times, but this is not
something that can't be helped. With
Stanford a permanent member of
NSA, we should be able to contrib
ute to its improvement."
UTILIZING NSA
The fact that Stanford has not .is
yet learned how to utilize NSA as
well as possible was pointed out by
Al Loomis, NSA co-ordinator, and
Gable.
"We haven't given NSA a fair
test," declared Gable. "We must
have better correlation between the
NSA co-ordinator and Excom. I
frankly don't think we've tried hard
enough."
Al Ix>omis agreed. "Because of
our trial basis in NSA," he added,
"wc have spent all our time telling
the students about NSA instead ot
being able to concentrate on out
activity in it."
CONTRIBUTIONS
Stanford's possible contributions
to NSA were outlined by Gable.
"The California-Nevada-Hawaii re
gion is one of the strongest in the
country, and I sec no reason why
Stanford delegates should not be
able to be elected to regional nd.
national offices.
"Year in and year out, the quality
of students at Stanford is equal to
that of students attending the be •
schools in the country. Stanford can
contribute leadership to NSA."
It was pointed out that at the
summer NSA convention in Ames,
lowa, Stanford contributed to dis
cussions on international programs,
financial systems, honor systems,
and women's social regulations.
FINANCES
Discussing the question of finances
and whether ASSU money would
be better .spent in sponsoring a cam
pus activity, Gable stated: "I ques
tion whether building up an activity
out of proportion to its position in
student government is preferable to
giving money for membership in >
national organization like NSA.
"The attitude of 'we must look out.
for ourselves first' was the attitud"
of the United States before World
War I. I do not feel that it is a
good attitude."
After Stanford was officially votcH
into NSA, Bing urged that we
"make our contributions begin right
this weekend by having the dele
gates to the UCLA regional confer
ence establish Stanford as a 1< idei
in NSA."


BEFORE THE VOTE —Harry Lunn, national president of the Na
tional Students Association, presented his case in support of
Stanford's affiliation with NSA at last night's meeting of the
ASSU Executive Committee. Following Lunn's talk and ad
ditional discussion, Excom voted 10 to 3 in favor of Stanford's
becoming a permanent member of NSA. Several of the student

Stanford's permanent membership in the National Stucloni
Association was approved by a 10 to 3 vote of the Executive Com
mittee in last night's meeting.
The three dissenters were Pete Bing, student body president
Dave Gibbs, graduate representative; and Dave lenks, repre

sentative of the class of '57. Row
representative Sam Palmer was not
at the meeting.
Immediately after the vote was
cast, a moi'c to reconsider affiliation
with NSA was made by Steve Voy
kovich, graduate representative; and
supported by Bob Gable, student
manager.
They held that the motion was
"railroaded" through Excom. and
that the opposition viewpoint had
not hecn given enough time for pre
sentation.
The reconsideration" motion was
defeated 6 to 4.
LUNN SPEAKS
Before the open discussion on NSA
membership began, Harry Lunn. na
tional president of NSA, briefly
spoke 011 the benefits of the organi
zation.
"New problems, new challenges,
new concepts of community relations
arc always arising," he said. "These
challenges arc better met.in a dis
cussion with students from other
parts of the country."
He said that NSA is the "most
representative voice of the American
student," and then qualified this
statement by asserting that NSA
nolicy on any matter is not binding
on any of the member schools.
OBSERVER ROLE?
One of the issues brought out in
the discussion was whether or not
Stanford could function satisfactorily
as an NSA observer rather than as
a dues-paying member.
Amber Spinning Henninger sup
ported the observer role. "Our con
tributions will be lost in value un
less they can be effectively coordin
ated," she stated.
Refuting her argument, Al Ivey
pointed out "as a member of NSA,
