### 
WASHINGTON. Nov. 10 fUP)â€”
President Eisenhower said today
that American planes should be pro
tected by fighter escorts when flying
proper missions in risky areas
around the world.
He made the statement at his
news conference in a calm appraisal
of last Sunday's latest plane inci
dent in which two Russian jets shot
down a B-29 photo reconnaissance
plane on a map-making flight over
northern Japan.
Th President's proposal for fighter
protection drew a mixed reception
in Congress. Some members en
dorsed the proposal wholeheartedly.
But at least one Republican felt it
would be wiser to pull out of such
trouble spots completely.
The President made these other
points:
1. Russia's general attitude con
cerning the plane incident seems to
be more conciliatory than in some
instances in the past.
2, The problem is complicated by
h jurisdictional dispute between this
country and Russia over the area
in which the attack occurred.
The President did not explain the
basis for his remark about a more
conciliatory attitude on the part of
the Russians. State Department of
ficials declined to elaborate. They
said no new Russian note on the in
cident has been received.
In its first note, Moscow charged
that the American plane violated
Soviet air space and opened fire on
the two MIGs when they sought to
intercept. Secretary of State John
Foster Dulles said the Russians arc
lying in claiming the American
plane fired first.
