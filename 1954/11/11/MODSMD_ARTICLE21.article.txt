# A 						Question of Maturity
## 
### 
Students will go to the polls today and to
morrow to vote on an amendment to 4he ASSU
constitution which, if passed, would give the
Iriterfraternity Council the duties of the now
dormant Interfraternity Board of Control.
Originally IFB, which was composed of 13
representatives of the administration, faculty,
fraternities, and fraternity alumni, had charge
of all judicial matters concerning fraternity
discipline.
Last spring, the IFC obtained University ap
proval to assume the judiciary responsibility
on a trial basis. It is composed of delegates
from the 22 fraternities and Otis Winters, presi
dent, and Keith Brownsberger, secretary-treas
urer.
The IFC had its first real test last week when
it dealt out 400 Con Home hours to one fra
ternity for a liquor violation. This decision cre
ated some controversy on the campus.
IFC feels it took the right action. It was aware
that students would consider the decision a
piecedent to be followed in the future. Some
members felt that they would have to hand out
a harsh punishment and ignore the extenuating
circumstances to show that IFC was assuming
its new duty seriously. Such action would have
been unjust.
IFC felt that a fine would not have enough
effect, because it wouldn't make an impression
on people with money. They decided that
labor which would extend over a period of
time would make the punishment effective.

Winters has made it clear that the action
wasn't a precedent. The facts were considered
and a decision was rendered.
IFC believes that the judiciary power will
unify fraternities and make IFC a stronger or
ganization. They weren't satisfied with the
IFB because it didn't give fraternities enough
to say on their own matters. The Board couldn't
have the same insight into fraternity problems
as men living in the houses have today. Fra
ternity men couldn't feel as free to talk things
out among the members of the administration
and faculty as they could with their peers.
Now the question is, are the fraternities big
enough to cope with the paramount task? The
list of men of IFC reveals it has the potential
to do the job well, ll has the machine, but will
it run?
Fraternities are often plagued with apathy.
Rather than join in campus life they some
times stay within the confines of their houses
and create the opinion that all is a battle of
fraternities against the world. If IFC adopts
the all-for-one-and-one-for all attitude, it doesn't
deserve the judiciary duty.
On the other hand, if it accepts the responsi
bilities realistically, this will be an excellent
chance to prove that fraternities can be a posi
tive force on campus.
The IFC is asking for the chance. They be
lieve they are mature enough. The University
believes they are mature enough. Do you, the
voter, believe they are mature enough?

been unjust.
IFC felt that a fine would not have enough
effect, because it wouldn't make an impression
on people with money. They decided that
labor which would extend over a period of
time would make the punishment effective.

Winters has made it clear that the action
wasn't a precedent. The facts were considered
and a decision was rendered.
IFC believes that the judiciary power will
unify fraternities and make IFC a stronger or
ganization. They weren't satisfied with the
IFB because it didn't give fraternities enough
to say on their own matters. The Board couldn't
have the same insight into fraternity problems
as men living in the houses have today. Fra
ternity men couldn't feel as free to talk things
out among the members of the administration
and faculty as they could with their peers.
Now the question is, are the fraternities big
enough to cope with the paramount task? The
list of men of IFC reveals it has the potential
to do the job well, ll has the machine, but will
it run?
Fraternities are often plagued with apathy.
Rather than join in campus life they some
times stay within the confines of their houses
and create the opinion that all is a battle of
fraternities against the world. If IFC adopts
the all-for-one-and-one-for all attitude, it doesn't
deserve the judiciary duty.
On the other hand, if it accepts the responsi
bilities realistically, this will be an excellent
chance to prove that fraternities can be a posi
tive force on campus.
The IFC is asking for the chance. They be
lieve they are mature enough. The University
believes they are mature enough. Do you, the
voter, believe they are mature enough?
Students will go to the polls today and to
morrow to vote on an amendment to 4he ASSU
constitution which, if passed, would give the
Iriterfraternity Council the duties of the now
dormant Interfraternity Board of Control.
Originally IFB, which was composed of 13
representatives of the administration, faculty,
fraternities, and fraternity alumni, had charge
of all judicial matters concerning fraternity
discipline.
Last spring, the IFC obtained University ap
proval to assume the judiciary responsibility
on a trial basis. It is composed of delegates
from the 22 fraternities and Otis Winters, presi
dent, and Keith Brownsberger, secretary-treas
urer.
The IFC had its first real test last week when
it dealt out 400 Con Home hours to one fra
ternity for a liquor violation. This decision cre
ated some controversy on the campus.
IFC feels it took the right action. It was aware
that students would consider the decision a
piecedent to be followed in the future. Some
members felt that they would have to hand out
a harsh punishment and ignore the extenuating
circumstances to show that IFC was assuming
its new duty seriously. Such action would have
been unjust.
