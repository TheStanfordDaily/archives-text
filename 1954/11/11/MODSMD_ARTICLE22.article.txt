# Just Waiting in the Rain
## 
### 
Winter has come to Stanford.
A few stray puddles are appearing in Lake
Lag, the ground has taken on the consistency
of slightly soggy cement, and students wait
ing for rides to Palo Alto or the Village are
discovering the perils of the ride shelter on
Palm Drive.
They are finding out that the shelter (a flat
roof set on eight posts) is great protection from
the rain IF the rain is falling in a strict vertical
pattern.
But rain usually doesn't fall vertically. It
comes down in angles that drive between the
upright boards of the shelter, and boldly
sweeps through the space where the back of
the shelter isn't.
And then there is the wind, which howls
through the shelter with a force that causes
engineering students to mumble something
like "d natural wind tunnel" under their breaths.

But let us not be too carping in our criticisms.
Undoubtedly there are good and sufficient
reasons why the ride shelter is constructed in
its own unigue little fashion.
Aesthetically-minded Stanford shuddered at
the thought of an ordinary ride shelter — one
with a pitched roof, three walls, and benches.
Obviously such a building would not harmon
ize with the architectural scheme of Stanford.
What the present shelter harmonizes with
is plain to nobody- least of all to the shivering,
soaking students who ; huddle under its meager
protection.
As the winter weather continues, we should
like to offer a suggestion to hitchhiking stu
dents, a suggestion that will help them to get
maximum benefit from our ride shelter.
Stand in the exact middie of the shelter. Arm
yourself with an umbrella. Wear a warm over
coat and a raincoat.
Then wait.
