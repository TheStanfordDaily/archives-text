# Farm's Student Nurses Are Real Part of Stanford's Family Tree
## 
### MARG DALGLIESH 
Their pins and caps proclaim them
Stanford nurses wherever they go,
and yet they are considered the
stepchildren of the Farm.
Actually they would rather not be
considered a lost branch of the fam
ily tree. All students of the Stan
ford School of Nursing in San Fran
cisco are a part of the ASSU. They
live by the Honor Code, the Funda
mental Standard, and a set of social
regulations.
Of course life in the'seven-story
dorm across from the Stanford Lane
Hospital does have its peculiarities.
In what dorm on campus do you find
laundry and linen service in addi
tion to maid service? Where else do
you have monkeys living next door
(in a research lab) or where else
does the sunbathing coed have to
Hee at the sight ol a helicopter?
In spirit, though, the student
nurse is truly a Cardinal. Here on
the Farm rivalry with Cal is at a
peak for about two weeks a year.
Up in San Francisco they vigorously
carry on the give-'em-the-axe ri
valry with the Cal nursing and
medical schools, also in San Fran
cisco, all year long.
Spring Sing and the fall tea spon
sored by AYVS (today at Bowman
Alumni House at 4:15) are the only
direct contacts the nurses have with
the Farm.
II the Nursing School's contact
with the Farm is wobbly, the nurses
certainly make up for it in other
outside contacts by bringing praise
to the Stanford name.
Of eight schools of nursing in San
Francisco, the Stanford and Cal
schools are the only ones to have
reciprocity with other states. This
means that a graduate, having
passed the California test, need not
take another test to practice nurs
ing in another state.

The student nurses work a 40-
hour week, including classes. Alter
their pre-clinical period, they work
varying hours and shifts but class
time is always counted as regular
duty time.
Vacations are almost as irregular
as ward hours. Each woman gets
four weeks of vacation a year, plus
.seven free days for legal holidays
which may or may not fall on the
holidays.
The School of Nursing encom

passes a three-year program. Stu
dents may enter the school only
alter they have completed two years
of college pre-nursing training and
are out of lower division. About
one-third of the students take their
college pre-nursing requirements at
Stanford.
No charge is made to the students
for room or board during the 29
months in the School of Nursing. In
addition, uniforms are laundered
without expense to the student.


HOME SWEET HOME—This is the dorm which the Stanford
nursing students call home-during their three years in Nursing
School in San Francisco. There they enjoy laundry and maid
service.

Of eight schools of nursing in San
Francisco, the Stanford and Cal
schools are the only ones to have
reciprocity with other states. This
means that a graduate, having
passed the California test, need not
take another test to practice nurs
ing in another state.

The student nurses work a 40-
hour week, including classes. Alter
their pre-clinical period, they work
varying hours and shifts but class
time is always counted as regular
duty time.
Vacations are almost as irregular
as ward hours. Each woman gets
four weeks of vacation a year, plus
.seven free days for legal holidays
which may or may not fall on the
holidays.
The School of Nursing encom

passes a three-year program. Stu
dents may enter the school only
alter they have completed two years
of college pre-nursing training and
are out of lower division. About
one-third of the students take their
college pre-nursing requirements at
Stanford.
No charge is made to the students
for room or board during the 29
months in the School of Nursing. In
addition, uniforms are laundered
without expense to the student.


HOME SWEET HOME—This is the dorm which the Stanford
nursing students call home-during their three years in Nursing
School in San Francisco. There they enjoy laundry and maid
service.
Their pins and caps proclaim them
Stanford nurses wherever they go,
and yet they are considered the
stepchildren of the Farm.
Actually they would rather not be
considered a lost branch of the fam
ily tree. All students of the Stan
ford School of Nursing in San Fran
cisco are a part of the ASSU. They
live by the Honor Code, the Funda
mental Standard, and a set of social
regulations.
Of course life in the'seven-story
dorm across from the Stanford Lane
Hospital does have its peculiarities.
In what dorm on campus do you find
laundry and linen service in addi
tion to maid service? Where else do
you have monkeys living next door
(in a research lab) or where else
does the sunbathing coed have to
Hee at the sight ol a helicopter?
In spirit, though, the student
nurse is truly a Cardinal. Here on
the Farm rivalry with Cal is at a
peak for about two weeks a year.
Up in San Francisco they vigorously
carry on the give-'em-the-axe ri
valry with the Cal nursing and
medical schools, also in San Fran
cisco, all year long.
Spring Sing and the fall tea spon
sored by AYVS (today at Bowman
Alumni House at 4:15) are the only
direct contacts the nurses have with
the Farm.
II the Nursing School's contact
with the Farm is wobbly, the nurses
certainly make up for it in other
outside contacts by bringing praise
to the Stanford name.
