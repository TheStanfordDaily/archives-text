(Editor's note: This is the last in a series of four articles on Men's
and Women's Councils.)

Men's and Women's Councils, working as the Council for Stu
dent Control, hear an average of 15 Honor Code cases each year,
and statistics show that about two-thirds of those heard are guilty.
A majority of the Honor Code cases reported to the Council are
turned in by faculty members. However, since last year's re-

i education program on the Honor ♦
j Code, students have reported more
! violations.
The Council for Student Control
j establishes penalties for violations.
These penalties have been consist
ent over the years, but are not set.
They are determined by each new
Council through discussion and ex
ploration.
In setting penalties, the Council
does not take into consideration the
two subjective influences of first,
measuring the effect of the penalty,
and second, considering psychologi
cal or emotional problems.
The factor which Is considered in
setting a penalty for an Honor Code
violation is the intent to deceive.
The Council decisions are then rec
ommended to the Dean of Students.
The present Dean of Students, H.
Donald Winbigler, reports that in
the period he has served as Dean,
only four penalty recommendations
by the Council have been referred
back by the administration for re
consideration. Of these four cases,
' one decision was reversed by Coun
cil. The remaining three decisions
were retained, and were eventually
proven to have been correct, said the
Dean.
When a penalty is determined and
the .student is informed, the Council

for Student Control steps out, and
the Dean of Students comes into the
case for final action.
Dean Winbigler said, "In my ex
perience, the student accepts the
penalty more willingly than do his
parents. He is generally eager to
return to Stanford to graduate,
while often the parents feel he
should not."
The job of the Dean of Students is
then to try to interpret the mean
ing of the Honor Code penalty to
the parents. Sometimes his job also
involves reinstating a student in the
ROTC program, or in a scholarship
taken away when the penalty was
given.
"It is not the penalty itself which
is most important," said the Dean,
"but the way in which it is accepted,
and the effort to meet the situation,
and to make an asset out of a mis
take." He added that it was reward
ing to watch the students who re
turned to Stanford to take an active
part in scholastic and student ac
tivities.
At an Honor Code hearing, the
accused person and the witnesses
are heard separately, and the ac
cused person does not know who has
reported him.
Guilt must be absolutely certain
before a conviction and penalty are
assigned. If it is felt that a member
of the Council for Student Control
cannot render a completely objec
tive judgment for reasons of friend
ship or the like, he is disqualified
from hearing that case.

At an Honor Code hearing, the
accused person and the witnesses
are heard separately, and the ac
cused person does not know who has
reported him.
Guilt must be absolutely certain
before a conviction and penalty are
assigned. If it is felt that a member
of the Council for Student Control
cannot render a completely objec
tive judgment for reasons of friend
ship or the like, he is disqualified
from hearing that case.

Men's and Women's Councils, working as the Council for Stu
dent Control, hear an average of 15 Honor Code cases each year,
and statistics show that about two-thirds of those heard are guilty.
A majority of the Honor Code cases reported to the Council are
turned in by faculty members. However, since last year's re-

i education program on the Honor ♦
j Code, students have reported more
! violations.
The Council for Student Control
j establishes penalties for violations.
These penalties have been consist
ent over the years, but are not set.
They are determined by each new
Council through discussion and ex
ploration.
In setting penalties, the Council
does not take into consideration the
two subjective influences of first,
measuring the effect of the penalty,
and second, considering psychologi
cal or emotional problems.
The factor which Is considered in
setting a penalty for an Honor Code
violation is the intent to deceive.
The Council decisions are then rec
ommended to the Dean of Students.
The present Dean of Students, H.
Donald Winbigler, reports that in
the period he has served as Dean,
only four penalty recommendations
by the Council have been referred
back by the administration for re
consideration. Of these four cases,
' one decision was reversed by Coun
cil. The remaining three decisions
were retained, and were eventually
proven to have been correct, said the
Dean.
When a penalty is determined and
the .student is informed, the Council

for Student Control steps out, and
the Dean of Students comes into the
case for final action.
Dean Winbigler said, "In my ex
perience, the student accepts the
penalty more willingly than do his
parents. He is generally eager to
return to Stanford to graduate,
while often the parents feel he
should not."
The job of the Dean of Students is
then to try to interpret the mean
ing of the Honor Code penalty to
the parents. Sometimes his job also
involves reinstating a student in the
ROTC program, or in a scholarship
taken away when the penalty was
given.
"It is not the penalty itself which
is most important," said the Dean,
"but the way in which it is accepted,
and the effort to meet the situation,
and to make an asset out of a mis
take." He added that it was reward
ing to watch the students who re
turned to Stanford to take an active
part in scholastic and student ac
tivities.
