ROUGH SPARTANâ€”San Jose's Tom Louderback is one of the
mainstays of the heavy San Jose State line. The guard weighs
in at 210 and stands 6-1 and loves rough going. Louderback
was first string last year for the Spartans after attending Santa
Rosa J.C. The Golden Raiders will be shooting for their first
win in 12 games with Stanford on Saturday.
