## 
### 
A sharp brisk workout on a soggy
turf in a light rain described yes
terday's varsity football practice as
Coach Chuck Taylor sent his grid
ders through fianl contact work be
fore Saturday's contest with the San
Jose State Spartans.
Taylor refused to make any pre
dictions on the game, and just ex
pressed himself by saying that the
Indians would be "ready" for the
Spartans.
Donn Carswell, who has been
scheduled to start on Saturday,
came up with a nose injury which
he has been nursing for several days
and whether or not he will be able
to go is doubtful.
Taylor also made it clear that
John Neff would definitely start in
the right half spot for the second
straight week in place of Gordy
Young. John Stewart has been fight
ing a flu bug, but will be ready in
time for Saturday.
Frosh Coach Bob Ghilotti, mean
while, expressed his happiness in
having both of his two best line
men back and ready to play Sat
urday against the Cal frosh. Chris
Plain returned Tuesday and yester
day center Russ Steele was back in
acteion. Steele had suffered a con
cussion in the UCLA contest.
