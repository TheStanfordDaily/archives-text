## 
### DON JACKSON 
Business School II - cemented a
spot in the intramural football play
offs lor themselves yesterday, as
they rampaged to a 19-0 soggy vic
tory over SAE's second unit.
The Biz Schoolers, by their win,
clinched second place in League 111
with a record of four wins against
a single setback.
SAE was only in the game on
scattered occasions, as the Biz
School defensive backs caught as
many SAE passes as the losers' ends
could. Bill Redman, lanky Biz
School end, .spotlighted the triumph
by tallying twice, once on an inter
ception and again on a long pass.
The first touchdown, almost anti
climactic after a barrage of inter
ceptions by both sides, was scored
by Redman after he picked off an
SAE pass on the SAE 10-yard line
and scooted untouched across the
goal. The conversion pass was in
complete.
An exchange of intercepted passes
and mud-clogged footwork followed,
until Redman scored again with less
than a minute remaining in the half.
This time it was on a 40-yard fling
from Jake Ham, which Redman bat
ted like a volleyball, finally grab
bing it for the TD. Once again the
conversion attempt ffiled.
The Biz Schoolers scored again in
rapid fashion after the second half
opened. A parade of short passes
took them to the losers' two, where
Ham flipped a blooper to Wayne
Miller in the end zone. Completely
baffling the SAE secondary, Ham
lumbered into the end zone unboth
ered for the conversion to wrap up
the scoring at 19-0.
