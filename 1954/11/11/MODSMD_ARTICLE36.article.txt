! tions, punting, punt returns, rush
! ing defense, and total defense.
Only teams to break through the
; Bruin hold are California, first in
| passing and kickoff returns, and
Oregon, tops in pass defense.
Stanford's offense comes out bet

ter than its defense in the statistics.
The Indians are sixth in rushing of
fense with a 139.0 per game average
and fourth in passing with a 142.6
