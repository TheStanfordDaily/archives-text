# SRI: Moon Is A Step Closer
## 
### 
Stanford Research Institute scien
tists recently reported they believed
they had found a method of elimi
nating "combustion instability" in
rockets, thus putting man's dream of
a "trip to the moon" a step closer to
reality.
One of the major, problems in the
design of large - scale, long - range
rockets, the report said, has been a
phenomenon known as "combustion
instability." This instability, which
occurred for no apparent reason,
often caused vibrations which set a
rocket off course, and sometimes
were violent enough to destroy the
missile.
The research teair, found that the
bucking was caused by local pres
sure build-ups which move around
in the rocket's combustion tube dur
ing firing. By changing the material
of the tube's lining, the researchers
found that the acoustic qualities of
coarse bronze liners stopped the for
mation of the detonation waves.
