# Senators' Feud Continues for Second Day

### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 (UP)
The Senate's historic censure debate
Rot off to a rousing start today with
a fist-pounding argument in which
Senator Arthur V. Watkins accused
Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of
failing to uphold his oath of office.
The clash between the two Re
publicans highlighted a day of spo
radic debate which almost died out
in mid-afternoon for lack of speak
ers. The discussion picked up steam
again, however, shortly before the
Senate recessed.
McCarthy claimed Watkins re
fused to allow him to present evi- j
dence at the censure hearings to
justify his criticism of the elections
subcommittee.
Striking his fist several times into
his open palm for emphasis, Watkins [
defended his ruling. He told McCar
thy the censure committee was "not
trying" the elections subcommittee,
"we were only trying charges
against you."
He said McCarthy was ''blasting"
the subcommittee when, under his
oath of office, "you should have been
helping them. You refused to do
that."
Some 250 persons were lined up
at the gallery doors when the ses
sion opened and, after all the scats
had been filled, a line extended al- :
most to the Capitol rotunda.
