# German Official Discusses European Union Chances
## 
### EDA MENDELS 
"If the West German people were to cast a 'yes' or no v °tc on
a European union today, there would probably be a 75 per cent
'yes' vote," suggested Dr. Eberhard Hesse yesterday.
Dr. Hesse, vice-consul of the German consulate in San Francisco,
spoke on "Germany Today" at the Women's Clubhouse, at in-

vitation of the Institute of Interna- <
tional Relations.
"Other European countries are not
so enthusiastic about European un
ion, as we Germans arc," the consul
saicl. He attributed this to the fact
that Germany has only been a nation
since 1871 and that "the idea of form
ing a federation is quite alive. The
Germans are willing to give up their
sovereignty to the sovereignty of a
greater union." He cited the addi
tional factor that Germany had been
split since the war, while Germany's
neighbors emerged in national units.
Dr. Hesse advised his audience not
to underestimate the Council of Eu
rope. Though it has no actual pow
er, it is an effective advertising
agency for European union. "It gets
the European used to the idea of a

| power above his own country's."
The Gorman public and press docs
not blame France for her action and
reaction regarding German rearma
ment, the consul said. He pointed
out that results might be worse for
France if she did not co-operate with
West Germany.
Dr. Hesse examined briefly the
chances for ratification of the Paris
Agreement in the West German
Parliament and the complications
I about the Saar settlement. If the
! Saar question is considered an intc
i f»ral part of the Paris pact, chances
for ratification would be greatly
diminished.
In the question period Dr. Hesse
elaborated on West German ccon
' omy, which is generally stable.
