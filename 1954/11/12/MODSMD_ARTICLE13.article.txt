# RAM'S HEAD
## Celebrates 60th Birthday 
### JAE HUNLEY 
Happy Birthday to Ram's
Hood!
For GO years, this student dra
matic group has been producing
plays, songs, and dances for the
entertainment of the campus,
=ind Bay Area high schools and
clubs.
Ham's Head begin in 1894, when
the first campus dramatic organiza
tion was formed, but the name of
Ram's Head didn't appear until 1911.
No one quite remembers why this
particular name was chosen, but the
symbol, the rather benevolent-look
ing head of a ram, still peers down
from the wall of the Rain's Head
room in Memorial Auditorium.
This organization is unique among
college drama groups in the United
States, since all shows are written
and directed by the students them
selves. There is no faculty assist
ance or supervision.
The group : ponsors one major ac
tivity each quarter. Fall is the time
for the Big Game Gaieties with the
traditional football theme. The
- Act.-;" are featured during
winter quarter; and in spring, Ram's
Head blossoms out with the Spring
Show.

To fulfil its basic purpose of train
ing students in all phases of stage
craft, Ram's Head welcomes anyone,
with or without experience in writ
ing, acting, technical work, and di
rect inn, as long as he is interested
in I lie organization.
Always seeking improvement, the
Ram's Head reviewing committee is
debating the possibility of producing
"small package" shows of music and
kits. Each of these would be stu
dent - written, with its own cast,
technical crow, and director, thereby
giving more students a chance to
participate in dramatic activities.
Reviewing committee is also con
sidering the possibility of producing

a small musical revue during winter
quarter, composed of the best mate
rial from the "package shows."
Ram's Head has the distinction of
having had as members people who
are outstanding in the professional
dramatic fields today.
Among these are Lloyd Nolan, a
Ram's Header in 1926. who is cur
rently appearing on Broadway in
"The Cainr Mutiny"; Andre Previn.
a music writer for the 1047 Gaieties,
who is now a music director for
MOM; and Jules Irving, a former
Ram's Head director, who is, at
present, running the Actors' Reper
tory Theater in San Francisco and
was voted one of the 10 most prom
ising young men in the city last
year.
And, of course, there is Doodles
Weaver, who was a Ram's Head
president at one time.
In addition to the development of
talent, Ram's Head has contributed
over $20,000 for scholarships, better
ment of sound and lighting facilities
in Memorial Auditorium, and im
provement of the drama library.
This year, Ram's Head hopes too
continue its tradition of good enter
tainment on the campus with the
1954 edition of the Big Game Gaie
ties and the promise of even better
shows to come during the remainder
of the year,

Always seeking improvement, the
Ram's Head reviewing committee is
debating the possibility of producing
"small package" shows of music and
kits. Each of these would be stu
dent - written, with its own cast,
technical crow, and director, thereby
giving more students a chance to
participate in dramatic activities.
Reviewing committee is also con
sidering the possibility of producing

a small musical revue during winter
quarter, composed of the best mate
rial from the "package shows."
Ram's Head has the distinction of
having had as members people who
are outstanding in the professional
dramatic fields today.
Among these are Lloyd Nolan, a
Ram's Header in 1926. who is cur
rently appearing on Broadway in
"The Cainr Mutiny"; Andre Previn.
a music writer for the 1047 Gaieties,
who is now a music director for
MOM; and Jules Irving, a former
Ram's Head director, who is, at
present, running the Actors' Reper
tory Theater in San Francisco and
was voted one of the 10 most prom
ising young men in the city last
year.
And, of course, there is Doodles
Weaver, who was a Ram's Head
president at one time.
In addition to the development of
talent, Ram's Head has contributed
over $20,000 for scholarships, better
ment of sound and lighting facilities
in Memorial Auditorium, and im
provement of the drama library.
This year, Ram's Head hopes too
continue its tradition of good enter
tainment on the campus with the
1954 edition of the Big Game Gaie
ties and the promise of even better
shows to come during the remainder
of the year,
