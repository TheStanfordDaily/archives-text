### 
The Delta Upsilon fraternity found
this morning that it was the subject
of an erroneous article in Herb
Caen's column in tiic Examiner.
The squib concerned the visit of
a group of Japanese students to
Stanford carljer this week, and
stated that a sign proclaiminc ' Re
member Pearl Harbor" was torn
down from over the DU houje just
before the visitors arrived at the
fraternity.
"The whole thing is a hoax" de
clared Ron Crawford, secretary of
the DU house. "We'd like to clcar
it up because we've been getting
phone calls from the administration
and citizens of Palo Alto and vi
cinity.
"The Japanese students had a
wonderful time with us. Wc ex
changed fraternity pins, swords, and
banners.
"I don't know who phoned the
story in to Herb Caen, but I'd like
to make it clcar that there's not a
word of truth in it."
