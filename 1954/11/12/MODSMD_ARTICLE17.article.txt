# 'SOMEWHAT SOGGY'
## Freshmen Fight Elements, Clock in Building Bonfire 
### DON JACKSON 
The somewhat soggy class of 1958, battling with equal vigor
the elements and the clock, is going about the business of con
structing a Big Game bonfire.
The 1954 Big Game pyre, which, at the moment resembles a pile
of scrap lumber in a lake bed, is temporarily in drydock due to

a week of consistent rainfall. With a
ha If-century tradition and commu
nity backing, though, you can bet
all your plus points that the bonfire
will be ready when it's supposed to.
Next Thursday night the fire is
scheduled to spark the Big Game
rally, held at Lake Lag's dry bed
and heralded by a barrage of fire
works which will announce the rally
to the campus.
This Monday freshmen, aided by
trucks donated by local firms and
sophomores volunteering as chauf
feurs, began the tedious task of col
lecting all the wood donated by local
families and firms. This continues
until next Tuesday, when the wood
will be assembled preparatory to the
"Big Push," the actual construction,
on Wednesday and Thursday.
Telephone poles used as support
for the ribbings and scrap wood
were scheduled to be put up early
this week, but the consistent liquid
invasion from above has temporarily
thwarted the plans.
The "Big Push," a 24-hour mara
thon work session with all freshmen
contributing to the effort, will get
under way, rain or shine, next Wed
nesday afternoon. It is slated to be
completed by 7:30 p.m. Thursday.
