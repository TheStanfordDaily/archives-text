## An Smpracticality—Or a Possibility? 
### 
Americans pride themselves on their prac
tical creativeness. They love gadgets — all
kinds of gadgets—anything that will open a
can faster or catch a mouse guicker.
American "know-how" is a valuable export
commodity. Every year thousands of scientists,
engineers, agricultural experts, doctors, and
administrators travel abroad to spread the bene
fits of American ingenuity and inventiveness.
American trademarks cover the world.
Thus it is only natural that the first guestion
asked of any new idea is "Will it work?"
It is reasonably simple to answer this gues
tion when the idea involves a machine or a
building or a highway which can be di
agrammed in blueprints and tested with mathe
matical theorems.
It is more difficult to answer when the idea
has to be tested by chemical analysis or under
specific physical surroundings.
But when the idea depends for success solely
on the interest and enthusiasm of human be
ings; there is no test to pre-determine its practi
cality,. -The only possible test is to put the idea
into action and see what happens.
NSA is based on an idea—an ideal perhaps.
It seeks to further the interests of American
college students on the campus, national, and
international level. It promotes this idea
through specific programs or information or
travel. But it is always aiming toward that
greater, nebulous goal, "the interests of college
students."
Apparently this idea is too Utopian, too im
practical lor many people to envision. Hence
the cynical comment by one Stanford admin
istrator, "When is NSA going to plan a con

ference with God?"
Perhaps the idea of having one organization
represent the American student population is
impractical. It has worked in other countries,
but perhaps it won't work here.
Perhaps the idea of Stanford students par
ticipating in a vast exchange of information and
ideas is also impractical. The time and money
it will cost are known, the concrete benefits
uncertain.
Perhaps any idea aimed at increasing the
understanding between men or making ideals
work is impractical. Human nature has failed
before, and there is no guarantee that it won't
prove too weak again.
But we might remind our dubious friends
that all human achievements were at one time
viewed as impossibly impractical.
Adventurers before Columbus were laughed
at as fools when they talked of new lands and
strange peoples. American revolutionaries
were ridiculed by Europeans for planning to
turn a wilderness into a land of liberty and
opportunity.
The early organizers of the League of Na
tions would have been deemed insane by their
predecessors for thinking that the nations of the
world could meet together in the same room to
further their mutual interests.
Possibly the goals of NSA lie on the horizon
of a new world of national and international
student activity. Impractical? No, not if those
who believe will work to achieve their aims.
Impossible? Why should it be? Men have
been achieving the impossible since the begin
ning of time.

matical theorems.
It is more difficult to answer when the idea
has to be tested by chemical analysis or under
specific physical surroundings.
But when the idea depends for success solely
on the interest and enthusiasm of human be
ings; there is no test to pre-determine its practi
cality,. -The only possible test is to put the idea
into action and see what happens.
NSA is based on an idea—an ideal perhaps.
It seeks to further the interests of American
college students on the campus, national, and
international level. It promotes this idea
through specific programs or information or
travel. But it is always aiming toward that
greater, nebulous goal, "the interests of college
students."
Apparently this idea is too Utopian, too im
practical lor many people to envision. Hence
the cynical comment by one Stanford admin
istrator, "When is NSA going to plan a con

ference with God?"
Perhaps the idea of having one organization
represent the American student population is
impractical. It has worked in other countries,
but perhaps it won't work here.
Perhaps the idea of Stanford students par
ticipating in a vast exchange of information and
ideas is also impractical. The time and money
it will cost are known, the concrete benefits
uncertain.
Perhaps any idea aimed at increasing the
understanding between men or making ideals
work is impractical. Human nature has failed
before, and there is no guarantee that it won't
prove too weak again.
But we might remind our dubious friends
that all human achievements were at one time
viewed as impossibly impractical.
Adventurers before Columbus were laughed
at as fools when they talked of new lands and
strange peoples. American revolutionaries
were ridiculed by Europeans for planning to
turn a wilderness into a land of liberty and
opportunity.
The early organizers of the League of Na
tions would have been deemed insane by their
predecessors for thinking that the nations of the
world could meet together in the same room to
further their mutual interests.
Possibly the goals of NSA lie on the horizon
of a new world of national and international
student activity. Impractical? No, not if those
who believe will work to achieve their aims.
Impossible? Why should it be? Men have
been achieving the impossible since the begin
ning of time.
Americans pride themselves on their prac
tical creativeness. They love gadgets — all
kinds of gadgets—anything that will open a
can faster or catch a mouse guicker.
American "know-how" is a valuable export
commodity. Every year thousands of scientists,
engineers, agricultural experts, doctors, and
administrators travel abroad to spread the bene
fits of American ingenuity and inventiveness.
American trademarks cover the world.
Thus it is only natural that the first guestion
asked of any new idea is "Will it work?"
It is reasonably simple to answer this gues
tion when the idea involves a machine or a
building or a highway which can be di
agrammed in blueprints and tested with mathe
matical theorems.
