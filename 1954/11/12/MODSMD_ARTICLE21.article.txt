## From Another Viewpoint

(Editors Note: This article is in reply to The Daily's
request that Dr. Stegner answer the question "What
Do Europeans Think of Us?" on the basis of his ex
perience in Europe last summer.) «
What do Europeans think of us?
The question is perennial, impossible, and
wistfully American. We care dreadfully about
the impression we make, we worry about how
we're doing, we want to be told that our nation
al character is admired, our motives honored,
our generosity appreciated, our strength re
spected, our culture imitated, and our friend
ship sought. How are we doing? Do they like
us over there, or have they been poisoned
against us by the Communists?
1 shall speak not for all Europeans but only
lor some Danes; for though we visited Ger
many, Austria, Switzerland. France, Holland,
.Belgium, Norway, and Sweden as well as Den
mark, we stayed in those countries little longer
than the average visiting Congressman, and I
am not prepaied to have opinions. Even the
Danes I speak for are as different among them
selves as I am different from Joe McCarthy or
Douglas McKay; to lump them is like trying to
wiap several watermelons in one package.
The Danes like us, ooviously. They are on
our side. They approve of our automobiles,
which they call Dollargrins, and they value us
for our hard currency and our national liking
for Danish furniture, silver, and other exports.
They disapprove of our tariff on cheese. They
were not enthusiastic about EDC, which they
thought of as primarily an American institu
tion, and were not eager lo draft themselves to
serve in it. In spite of their hatred and fear of
Germany, Ihey can not have shed many tears at
1 IDC's decease. They have a fairly common be
lief, after two dozen jet crashes in the past few
months, that the Thunderjets we gave them for
training were old crocks we wouldn't fly our
selves. They look with suspicion on most of
fers of aid, suspecting strings. Being an inde
pendent people, they don't want to be bought
into anything, any more than they want to be
bulldozed into it.
Sitting as they do helplessly among the pow
er blocs, unable to make vital decisions or
initiate action themselves, tied economically,
militarily, and politically to England, or, fail
ing England, to Germany, or, failing Germany,

to Russia, Denmark makes the most of the in
alienable right of the weak to snipe at the
strong. The Danes snipe at all those who must
and do make the world's us among
them. But there is no danger that the nation will
be lured toward Russia. Just the opposite: the
Communist Party, which was very popular
after the war because of its resistance to the
Germans, has steadily fallen away until now
it amounts to only a tiny percentage and wields
no real power.
Most Danes are aware—as what European
is not? —that there is no true culture in America.
They have seen the movies and the magazines
and read some of the books, though an Ameri
can may think they rarely read the right ones.
If there is a single word to describe the most
characteristic Danish attitude toward the Am
erican, the word is "indulgent." There are so
many Danes in America that a home-Dane feels
like a relation; he has a family right to smile
at our follies and scold us for our errors. To the
American, he is likely to seem a little smug
while doing it. Nobody likes to be indulged.
The stereotypes of American materialism,
industrial ugliness, political hysteria, cultural
sterility and the garishness of taste, have
enough truth in them to hurt, enough European
complacency in them to be irritating, and
enough usefulness to the Communist line to be
alarming. But I doubt that the Danes or any Eu
ropeans will be cured of that complacency
soon; to the Greeks, Rome was always an up
start. There is one thing that should be said,
though it goes counter to our anxieties and our
compulsion to be loved: We can quit worry
ing about what they think of us, and care as
little what they think of us as they care what we
think of them. Maybe to have the courage of
oirr own character is the best way to win the
respect we are so keen for.
It is a fact that while we went around Den
mark asking a million questions about every
aspect of Danish life, history, art, and character,
hardly a Dane asked us any question about
America, and not a single Dane showed any
uneasiness about how Denmark was regarded
in the streets and offices of America. What do
they think of us? They don't think of us a tenth
as much as in our self-consciousness we think
they do.
