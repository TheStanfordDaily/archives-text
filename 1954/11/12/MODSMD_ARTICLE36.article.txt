THE INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT
OF NED FUTTY
Chloe McColgate was a beautiful coed who majored in psveh and
worked in the I.Q. testing department of the university. She did
not work there because she needed money; she worked there because
she loved and admired intelligence above all things. "1 love and
admire intelligence above all things," is the way she succinctly put it.
Ned Futty, on the other hand, was a man who could take intelli
gence <>r leave it alone. What he loved and admired above all tilings
was knls. "What 1 love and admire above all things is girls," is
the way he put it.
One day Ned saw Chloe walking by on the campus. "Holy Toledo,
ho exclaimed. "How sweetly flows that liquefaction of her clothes!
The following day he saw her walking past again. "Great balls of
fire!" he exclaimed. "Next, when 1 cast mine eyes and see that brave
vibration each way free, O, how that glittering taketh me!"
When lie saw her again the next day, he could no longer contain
himself. He ran up and blocked her way. "Excuse me," lie said,
tugging his forelock, "1 am Ned Futty and I love you beyond the
saying of it. Will you be mine?"
She looked at his quarter-inch haircut, his black rimmed glasses,
his two-day beard, his gamy T-shirt, his tattered jeans, his de
composing tennis shoes. "You arc not unattractive," she admitted,
"but for me beauty is not enough. Intelligence is what I require
in a man."
"I'm smart as a whip" said Ned with a modest blush. "Back home
everybody always said, 'You got to get up pretty early in the morning
to get ahead of old Ned Futty."'
"Maybe so," said Chloe, "but if you don't mind, I'd like to make
sure. Will you come into the I.Q. testing department with me?"
"With you T would go into a malted milk machine," cried Ned
Futty and laughed and smote his thigh and bit Chloe's nape in an
excess of passion and high spirits. Scampering goatlike, he followed
her nito the I.Q. testing department.
"First I will test your vocabulary," said Chloe.
"Siioot!" said Ned gaily and licked her palm.
"What does juxtaposition mean?"
"Heats me," he confessed cheerily.
"Mow about ineffable?"
"Never heard of it," smiled Ned, plunging his face into her clavicle.
" Furtive?"
"With fur on?" said Ned doubtfully.
Chine sighed. "How are you on arithmetic?" she asked.
"A genius," he assured her.
"What's the difference between a numerator and a denominntoV?"
"My feeling exactly!" said Ned with an approving nod. "What's
the difference?"
"If a man earns fifty dollars a month," said Chloe, "and saves 12%
of his earnings, how long would it take him to save $100?"
"Forever," said Ned. "Who can save anything on $50 a month?"
"How do you find a square root?"
"How should I know?" replied Ned, giggling. "I'm no square."
"flow are you on English?" asked Chloe.
"I speak it fluently," said Ned with quiet pride.
"What is the present tense of wrought?"
"Wieet," replied Ned, clutching Chloe to him and dancing bars
of the Maxixe.
"Next I will test you for manual dexterity," said Chloe. She handed
him a board punched full of oddly shaped holes and a collection of
oddly shaped pegs. "Fit the pegs in the holes," she instructed him.
"I-et's neck instead," suggested Ned.
"Maybe later," said Chloe. "First the pegs.' :
He fumbled about for a longish interval. Finally he tired of it and
reached for Chloe.
But she fended him off. "Ned Futty," she said, "you are dumb.
Yoii have the highest dumbness score of anybody I have ever tested.
Consequently I cannot be your girl, for I love and admire intelligence
above ali things."
He hurled himself on the floor and clasped her about the knees.
"Rut I love you!" he cried in anguish. "Do not send me from you, or
you will make my world a sunless place — full of dim and fearful
shapes!"
"I am sorry," she answered, "but you are too dumb."
"Reconsider, madam," he begged, "else a miasm looms before me."
".Co," she,said coldly.
Spent and speechless, he struggled to his feet. With leaden steps
lie -made his painful way to the door. There be stopped ttnd lit a
cigarette. Then he opened the door and started away to bis gray and
grimly future.
"Stay!" called Chloe.
He turned.
"Was that," she asked, "a Philip Morris you just lit?"
"Yes," he said.
"Then come to me and lip my love!" cried Chloe joyously. "For
you are not dumb! You are smart! Anybody is smart to smoke
l'hilip Morris with its fine vintage tobaccos, its cool relaxing mild
ness, its superior taste, its snap-open pack. Ned, lover, give me u
cigarette and marry me!"
And they smoked happily ever after. , ©M»ishuimtn,ib.m

she loved and admired intelligence above all things. "1 love and
admire intelligence above all things," is the way she succinctly put it.
Ned Futty, on the other hand, was a man who could take intelli
gence <>r leave it alone. What he loved and admired above all tilings
was knls. "What 1 love and admire above all things is girls," is
the way he put it.
One day Ned saw Chloe walking by on the campus. "Holy Toledo,
ho exclaimed. "How sweetly flows that liquefaction of her clothes!
The following day he saw her walking past again. "Great balls of
fire!" he exclaimed. "Next, when 1 cast mine eyes and see that brave
vibration each way free, O, how that glittering taketh me!"
When lie saw her again the next day, he could no longer contain
himself. He ran up and blocked her way. "Excuse me," lie said,
tugging his forelock, "1 am Ned Futty and I love you beyond the
saying of it. Will you be mine?"
She looked at his quarter-inch haircut, his black rimmed glasses,
his two-day beard, his gamy T-shirt, his tattered jeans, his de
composing tennis shoes. "You arc not unattractive," she admitted,
"but for me beauty is not enough. Intelligence is what I require
in a man."
"I'm smart as a whip" said Ned with a modest blush. "Back home
everybody always said, 'You got to get up pretty early in the morning
to get ahead of old Ned Futty."'
"Maybe so," said Chloe, "but if you don't mind, I'd like to make
sure. Will you come into the I.Q. testing department with me?"
"With you T would go into a malted milk machine," cried Ned
Futty and laughed and smote his thigh and bit Chloe's nape in an
excess of passion and high spirits. Scampering goatlike, he followed
her nito the I.Q. testing department.
"First I will test your vocabulary," said Chloe.
"Siioot!" said Ned gaily and licked her palm.
"What does juxtaposition mean?"
"Heats me," he confessed cheerily.
"Mow about ineffable?"
"Never heard of it," smiled Ned, plunging his face into her clavicle.
" Furtive?"
"With fur on?" said Ned doubtfully.
Chine sighed. "How are you on arithmetic?" she asked.
"A genius," he assured her.
"What's the difference between a numerator and a denominntoV?"
"My feeling exactly!" said Ned with an approving nod. "What's
the difference?"
"If a man earns fifty dollars a month," said Chloe, "and saves 12%
of his earnings, how long would it take him to save $100?"
"Forever," said Ned. "Who can save anything on $50 a month?"
"How do you find a square root?"
"How should I know?" replied Ned, giggling. "I'm no square."
"flow are you on English?" asked Chloe.
"I speak it fluently," said Ned with quiet pride.
"What is the present tense of wrought?"
"Wieet," replied Ned, clutching Chloe to him and dancing bars
of the Maxixe.
"Next I will test you for manual dexterity," said Chloe. She handed
him a board punched full of oddly shaped holes and a collection of
oddly shaped pegs. "Fit the pegs in the holes," she instructed him.
"I-et's neck instead," suggested Ned.
"Maybe later," said Chloe. "First the pegs.' :
He fumbled about for a longish interval. Finally he tired of it and
reached for Chloe.
But she fended him off. "Ned Futty," she said, "you are dumb.
Yoii have the highest dumbness score of anybody I have ever tested.
Consequently I cannot be your girl, for I love and admire intelligence
above ali things."
He hurled himself on the floor and clasped her about the knees.
"Rut I love you!" he cried in anguish. "Do not send me from you, or
you will make my world a sunless place — full of dim and fearful
shapes!"
"I am sorry," she answered, "but you are too dumb."
"Reconsider, madam," he begged, "else a miasm looms before me."
".Co," she,said coldly.
Spent and speechless, he struggled to his feet. With leaden steps
lie -made his painful way to the door. There be stopped ttnd lit a
cigarette. Then he opened the door and started away to bis gray and
grimly future.
"Stay!" called Chloe.
He turned.
"Was that," she asked, "a Philip Morris you just lit?"
"Yes," he said.
"Then come to me and lip my love!" cried Chloe joyously. "For
you are not dumb! You are smart! Anybody is smart to smoke
l'hilip Morris with its fine vintage tobaccos, its cool relaxing mild
ness, its superior taste, its snap-open pack. Ned, lover, give me u
cigarette and marry me!"

was knls. "What 1 love and admire above all things is girls," is
the way he put it.
One day Ned saw Chloe walking by on the campus. "Holy Toledo,
ho exclaimed. "How sweetly flows that liquefaction of her clothes!
The following day he saw her walking past again. "Great balls of
fire!" he exclaimed. "Next, when 1 cast mine eyes and see that brave
vibration each way free, O, how that glittering taketh me!"
When lie saw her again the next day, he could no longer contain
himself. He ran up and blocked her way. "Excuse me," lie said,
tugging his forelock, "1 am Ned Futty and I love you beyond the
saying of it. Will you be mine?"
She looked at his quarter-inch haircut, his black rimmed glasses,
his two-day beard, his gamy T-shirt, his tattered jeans, his de
composing tennis shoes. "You arc not unattractive," she admitted,
"but for me beauty is not enough. Intelligence is what I require
in a man."
"I'm smart as a whip" said Ned with a modest blush. "Back home
everybody always said, 'You got to get up pretty early in the morning
to get ahead of old Ned Futty."'
"Maybe so," said Chloe, "but if you don't mind, I'd like to make
sure. Will you come into the I.Q. testing department with me?"
"With you T would go into a malted milk machine," cried Ned
Futty and laughed and smote his thigh and bit Chloe's nape in an
excess of passion and high spirits. Scampering goatlike, he followed
her nito the I.Q. testing department.
"First I will test your vocabulary," said Chloe.
"Siioot!" said Ned gaily and licked her palm.
"What does juxtaposition mean?"
"Heats me," he confessed cheerily.
"Mow about ineffable?"
"Never heard of it," smiled Ned, plunging his face into her clavicle.
" Furtive?"
"With fur on?" said Ned doubtfully.
Chine sighed. "How are you on arithmetic?" she asked.
"A genius," he assured her.
"What's the difference between a numerator and a denominntoV?"
"My feeling exactly!" said Ned with an approving nod. "What's
the difference?"
"If a man earns fifty dollars a month," said Chloe, "and saves 12%
of his earnings, how long would it take him to save $100?"
"Forever," said Ned. "Who can save anything on $50 a month?"
"How do you find a square root?"
"How should I know?" replied Ned, giggling. "I'm no square."
"flow are you on English?" asked Chloe.
"I speak it fluently," said Ned with quiet pride.
"What is the present tense of wrought?"
"Wieet," replied Ned, clutching Chloe to him and dancing bars
of the Maxixe.
"Next I will test you for manual dexterity," said Chloe. She handed
him a board punched full of oddly shaped holes and a collection of
oddly shaped pegs. "Fit the pegs in the holes," she instructed him.
"I-et's neck instead," suggested Ned.
"Maybe later," said Chloe. "First the pegs.' :
He fumbled about for a longish interval. Finally he tired of it and
reached for Chloe.
But she fended him off. "Ned Futty," she said, "you are dumb.
Yoii have the highest dumbness score of anybody I have ever tested.
Consequently I cannot be your girl, for I love and admire intelligence
above ali things."
He hurled himself on the floor and clasped her about the knees.
"Rut I love you!" he cried in anguish. "Do not send me from you, or
you will make my world a sunless place — full of dim and fearful
shapes!"
"I am sorry," she answered, "but you are too dumb."
"Reconsider, madam," he begged, "else a miasm looms before me."
".Co," she,said coldly.
Spent and speechless, he struggled to his feet. With leaden steps
lie -made his painful way to the door. There be stopped ttnd lit a
cigarette. Then he opened the door and started away to bis gray and
grimly future.
"Stay!" called Chloe.
He turned.
"Was that," she asked, "a Philip Morris you just lit?"
"Yes," he said.
"Then come to me and lip my love!" cried Chloe joyously. "For
you are not dumb! You are smart! Anybody is smart to smoke
l'hilip Morris with its fine vintage tobaccos, its cool relaxing mild
ness, its superior taste, its snap-open pack. Ned, lover, give me u
cigarette and marry me!"
And they smoked happily ever after. , ©M»ishuimtn,ib.m

THE INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT
OF NED FUTTY
Chloe McColgate was a beautiful coed who majored in psveh and
worked in the I.Q. testing department of the university. She did
not work there because she needed money; she worked there because
she loved and admired intelligence above all things. "1 love and
admire intelligence above all things," is the way she succinctly put it.
Ned Futty, on the other hand, was a man who could take intelli
gence <>r leave it alone. What he loved and admired above all tilings
was knls. "What 1 love and admire above all things is girls," is
the way he put it.
