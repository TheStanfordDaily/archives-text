## Cubs' Scalp Is Sought By Papooses 
### BOB DURAND 
California vs. Stanford. The
Big Game — freshman style —
will be held tomorrow, begin
ning at 11 a.m., as preliminary
lo the varsity-San Jose State
contest.
For those who are looking ahead
to future Big Games, this tilt might
prove to be a very good preview.
The Papooses are supposed to have
one of the best teams ever. The
Cubs are a question mark.
Coach Bob Ghilotti's Card year
lings walloped the Brubabes of UC
LA, 25-0, after dropping a thriller
to (JSC's "best-ever" frosh by a 20-
19 count.
The Blue and Gold first-year men
of Coach Hal Grant were stopped
cold by the Brubabes, 21-0, but then
bounced back to scare the Trobabes
in a losing cause, 27-34.
In their first two games, the Pa
pooses showed that they are strong
in almost every aspect. A fine pass
ing attack was evident in the USC
tilt, while the UCLA contest brought
out a powerful running game and a
stalwart defense.
BIG IMPROVEMENT
The Cubs showed a big improve
ment in their second game, but they
also showed that they still have a
lot of improvement to do. Whether
or not this improvement will come
tomorrow is doubtful.
Ghilotti says,"The Cal frosh have
a lot of potential, especially in their
fullback, Art Forbes. They haven't
shown it yet, and they just might
surprise us Saturday. If such is the
case the game could_go either way."
The weather forecast for Saturday
reads "cloudy with rain." If it is
too rainy, the game will have to be
played on the rugby field instead of
on the Stadium turf.
The precipitation might also hin
der Papoose Jack Douglas' passing.
The former Santa Monica High star
has completed 28 aerials out of 48
attempts for 346 yards and two
touchdowns in two games.

However, if such is the case,
Douglas has some very capable
backs to hand the ball to. Halfbacks
Lou Valli and Doug Dick ripped the
Brubabe line to shreds last week in
Coliseum. Fullback Bob Schmidt
and reserves Jeri McMillan and
Wallace Honeywell can also be
counted on to gain valuable yardage.
If all offense fails, Ghilotti can
rely upon a line which did not allow
UCLA to get one sustained march
going last week. It is a forward wall
that is paced by Jim Kroeter, Noel
Robinson, Russ Steele, and Joel
Freis.
The Curbs will be pinning their
hopes upon Forbes and a couple of
speedy halfbacks, Max Hale and Jim
Fitzpatrick.
Probable starting lineups: Califor
nia—Jim Duff, le; Stan Nelson, It;
Ralph Clifford, lg; Bob Jordan, c;
Ken Short, rg; Gene Cherry, rt;
Roger Ramseier, re; Gus Gianulias,
