# Booters Ready For Broncos In 'Do or Die'
## 
### 
The Stanford soccer team, with
only the barest mathematical chance
of making the league playoffs, jour
neys down the Peninsula tomorrow
morning to take on Santa Clara's
Broncos.
The Indians have a chance of get
ting a tie for third place in the
Northern California Soccer Associa
tion, if they can beat the Bronocs
this week and California next. The
three top teams in the league play
off for the championship. j,
Stanford should be slightly fa
vored over the Broncos tomorrow,
although Santa Clara beat the same
San Francisco State team which tied
Stanford last Saturday. However,
the Broncs rank below Stanford in
league standings.
The Indians appear ready for their
upcoming "do or die" efforts. This
week's muddy practices indicate
that Stanford is ready for its usual
late-season splurge.
The Card backfield, which played
brilliantly last week in spite of a
couple of crucial mistakes, seems'to
have consolidated. Ken Woods, Sam
Thornton, Dan Cortes, Sam Regis
ter, Peter Mack, 'and Don Yates,
will probably comprise the starting
defensive unit.
The forward line, Niels Vinding,
Sam Suarez, Bill Wren, Tom DeFor
est, and Dick Koenigsberger, has
been working hard on its shooting
this week so as ngt to have the effect
of last week when they missed sev
eral crucial shots.
