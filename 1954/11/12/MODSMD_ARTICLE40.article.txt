# Hayniemen Face Bears
## 
### 
Coach Tom Haynie's water polo
ists end their season tomorrow when
they face California at Berkeley.
For the first time in several sea
sons, the Indian mermen are out of
the running for the PCC water polo
crown. However, they hope to play
a spoiler role in tomorrow's contest
by knocking the Bears out of the
championship. Cal is currently tied
with (JSC for the league lead, both
teams possessing a four and one
record. USC plays last-place UCLA
tomorrow.
Cal, which defeated Stanford C to
3 in their first meeting this year, is
led by right forward Gordon Gill,
who notched ten goals in one game
last week, and center forward Jerry
Hays.
Starting for the Indians will be
Bill Berglund, Dan Osborne, and
Mike Templeton at forwards; Car
ver Nixon. Karl Brenner, and Bill
Clemens at guards; and Ed Barr,
goalie.
Starting for Cal will be Gill, Hays,
and Bill Phillips at forwards; Pete
Barnato, Dan Smaiian, and Jack Mc-
Nees at guards; and Gordon Hall,
goalie.
