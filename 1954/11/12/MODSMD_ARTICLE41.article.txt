# Card Jinx At Stake
## 
### 
Stanford's footballers will be out
to preserve their jinx over San Jose
State in the Stadium tomorrow.
The Indians and Spartans have
met on the gridiron 11 times in the
past 54 years and the Cards have
emerged victorious every time. The
series has been so lopsided that
Stanford has outscored San Jose 392
to 62 in total points in these contests
and the Golden Raiders have been
blanked in seven contests.
Way back in 1900, the Indians,
coached by Fielding Yost, opened
the series with a pair of wins, 35 to
0 and 24 to 0.
The series was discontinued until
1933 when in successive years the
PCC champion Vow Boys walloped
San Jose 27 to 0, 48 to 0, and 35 to 0.
After another lapse in the rivalry,
this one until 1948, the two schools
met again, and this time the Spar
tans almost won one. San Jose held
a 20 to 0 lead midway through the
third period, but suddenly collapsed
and let the Indians pull out a thriller
26 to 20.
The Spartans reverted to form the
next two seasons as Stanford rolled
to 49 to 0 and 33 to 16 wins.
' It was a little tougher in 1951,
however, as the Cards scored an un
impressive 26 to 13 win.
It has been no contest the past two
years, however, as the Spartans
came into the Stadium witfi impres
sive season records and highly tout
ed stars only to be waxed 35 to 13
in 1952 and last season 54 to 0.
