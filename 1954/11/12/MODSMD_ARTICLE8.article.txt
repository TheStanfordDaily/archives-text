# Indians to Stalk Spartans Tomorrow
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
San Jose State Coach Bob
Bronzan is "playing it cool." He
says he is completely relaxed.
"Why should I get all wound up,
when I know perfectly well that
this year, as every year, Stan
ford will tear us apart?"
On the other hand, Stanford's
Chuck Taylor is tight-lipped and
wary about tomorrow's 2 p.m. Sta
dium struggle. As of yesterday,
Chuck had not even made his week
ly winning prediction. Taylor says,
"We're not. counting on the Spar
tans' choking up in Stanford Sta

dium. Nor are we looking past them
to next week."
The Spartans are working hard on
building up a tradition of going to
pieces in the huge Stanford Bowl.
They have never beaten the Indians
in 11 tries. Many years San Jose
State lias come in rated a good bet
to up et Stanford, only to end up
on the short end
Nevertheless, Taylor seems to
think the Spartans' chances against
his team a rc better than ever this
season, despite Bronzan's psychol
ogy. "Remember," says Chuck,
"we're not the same team we were
last year. Moreover, the record
4iows that we're at our worst this

year against the teams we're sup
posed to beat."
Stanford should beat San Jose to
morrow. But they should have beat
en Washington State two weeks ago.
But, Stanford won't look past the
Spartans to Cal. The record shows
they never have. As a matter of
fact, the Indians usually maltreat
the Spartans so badly each year they
raise a lot of false hopes for the en
suing Big Game.
San Jose State sports a mediocre
4-3 record in its own class. They
have had two opponents in common
with the Indians. They lost to Ore
gon, which Stanford narrowly de
feated. Last week they were upset

by COP, while the Cards nipped the
Tigers, 13-12.
This loss to their cross-bay rivals
has them smarting. If they can. they
will take it out on their Peninsula
neighbors. The visitors are in their
best physical condition of the year,

and will present a complete squad
for the big attempt.
Bronzan will probably start Benny
Pierce at the quarterback post. He
has been bothered by injuries all
year, but appears ready to handle
the tricky Spartan T offense.
Captain and guard Tom Louder
back anchors the light but aggres
sive Spartan forward wall. Taylor
thinks Louderback is one of the
finest linemen on the coast, and be
lieves he merits a place on the
Shrine West team.
Stanford is also in much better
physical shape than it was a
week ago. Jerry Goldberg is ready
to return at his center and line

backing spot. Bill Tart is apparent
ly recovered from the injury which
slightly hobbled him last week.
Taylor is starting John Brodie at
quarterback this week. After goinn
with Jerry Gustafson and ball-con
trol in last Saturday's struggle with
the Trojans, Taylor is turning to the
.soph quarterback in an attempt to
make a wide open game of it.
As Brodie tries to raise his 63-for
-129 passing percentage, which is
fourth in the country, his favorite
receiver, John Stewart, will try to
close ground on California's Jim
Hanifan. Stewart ranks behind the
California end in the passes received
department with 33 catches.

season, despite Bronzan's psychol
ogy. "Remember," says Chuck,
"we're not the same team we were
last year. Moreover, the record
4iows that we're at our worst this

year against the teams we're sup
posed to beat."
Stanford should beat San Jose to
morrow. But they should have beat
en Washington State two weeks ago.
But, Stanford won't look past the
Spartans to Cal. The record shows
they never have. As a matter of
fact, the Indians usually maltreat
the Spartans so badly each year they
raise a lot of false hopes for the en
suing Big Game.
San Jose State sports a mediocre
4-3 record in its own class. They
have had two opponents in common
with the Indians. They lost to Ore
gon, which Stanford narrowly de
feated. Last week they were upset

by COP, while the Cards nipped the
Tigers, 13-12.
This loss to their cross-bay rivals
has them smarting. If they can. they
will take it out on their Peninsula
neighbors. The visitors are in their
best physical condition of the year,

and will present a complete squad
for the big attempt.
Bronzan will probably start Benny
Pierce at the quarterback post. He
has been bothered by injuries all
year, but appears ready to handle
the tricky Spartan T offense.
Captain and guard Tom Louder
back anchors the light but aggres
sive Spartan forward wall. Taylor
thinks Louderback is one of the
finest linemen on the coast, and be
lieves he merits a place on the
Shrine West team.
Stanford is also in much better
physical shape than it was a
week ago. Jerry Goldberg is ready
to return at his center and line

backing spot. Bill Tart is apparent
ly recovered from the injury which
slightly hobbled him last week.
Taylor is starting John Brodie at
quarterback this week. After goinn
with Jerry Gustafson and ball-con
trol in last Saturday's struggle with
the Trojans, Taylor is turning to the
.soph quarterback in an attempt to
make a wide open game of it.
As Brodie tries to raise his 63-for
-129 passing percentage, which is
fourth in the country, his favorite
receiver, John Stewart, will try to
close ground on California's Jim
Hanifan. Stewart ranks behind the
California end in the passes received
department with 33 catches.
San Jose State Coach Bob
Bronzan is "playing it cool." He
says he is completely relaxed.
"Why should I get all wound up,
when I know perfectly well that
this year, as every year, Stan
ford will tear us apart?"
On the other hand, Stanford's
Chuck Taylor is tight-lipped and
wary about tomorrow's 2 p.m. Sta
dium struggle. As of yesterday,
Chuck had not even made his week
ly winning prediction. Taylor says,
"We're not. counting on the Spar
tans' choking up in Stanford Sta

dium. Nor are we looking past them
to next week."
The Spartans are working hard on
building up a tradition of going to
pieces in the huge Stanford Bowl.
They have never beaten the Indians
in 11 tries. Many years San Jose
State lias come in rated a good bet
to up et Stanford, only to end up
on the short end
Nevertheless, Taylor seems to
think the Spartans' chances against
his team a rc better than ever this
season, despite Bronzan's psychol
ogy. "Remember," says Chuck,

last year. Moreover, the record
