# Traditional Activities Planned to Boost Spirit For Big Game Week
## Paly Merchants Decorate Stores 
### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
Here it is—Big Game Week,
1954.
During the next six days, 1954
football spirit on the Farm will
.limb to its high point of the
year. Boosted by such tradition
al Big Game Week activities as
Gaieties, the Bonfire, and Button
Day, the flood of feeling will
reach a crest next Saturday aft
ernoon in Cal's Memorial Sta
dium.
Launching Big Game Week today
will be a series of Downtown Dis
plays in the store windows of Palo
Alto merchants, on the general
theme of "Beat Cal."
The displays will be judged this
Thursday afternoon, and the winner
will be given two tickets to the Big
Game.
NEW FEATURE
A new feature this year, pocket
size Big Game Week schedule cards,
will be distributed on Quad and at
the Cellar today by Cardinals.
Tomorrow's big feature will be the
opening of the 1954 Big Game Gai
eties in Memorial Auditorium.
On Wednesday the freshman class
will begin its ''Big Push" to com
plete the Bonfire.
Wednesday has also been set as
"Button Day" with red-and-white
"Beat Cal" buttons being passed out
on campus.
Cardinals will try another inno
vation this year. Instead of the tra
ditional "Lick the Bear" lollipops
stuck in the mouths of Stanford
roughs and women, Big Game Week
planners will pass out printed "Burn
the Bear" match folders.
THE BONFIRE
On Thursday evening, after the
Downtown Display judging, will
come what many consider the high
light of the pre-game activities: the
Big Game Bonfire on the dry bed
of Lake Lagunita.
At a rally set to begin at 7:45 that
evening, Coach Chuck Taylor and
team captain Win Wedge, plus Bob
Reynolds, All - American Stanford
tackle and Vow Boy from the 1930'5,
and Dick Marston, ASUC president,
will speak.
After the bonfire, Oft - Campus
Women and Toyon will sponsor an
open house dance from 9:30 to 12:30
at Toyon.
Friday's festivities will include the
final performance of Gaieties here
on the campus,
