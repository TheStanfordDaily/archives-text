WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 (UP)—
Senator Allen J. Ellender (D., La.)
said today the Senate might clear
Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of cen
sure charges if the Wisconsin Re
publican would give an accounting
of funds given him to fight Commu
nism.
McCarthy merely laughed when
informed of Ellender's statement.
Ellender talked with reporters on
the eve of the start tomorrow of the
second week of Senate debate on the
censure issue. He described as
"poppycock" McCarthy's argument
that the censure move is an effort
to "smear" his fight against Commu
nism.
He expressed disappointment in
the report of the committee, which
recommended censure. "I would
have been more satisfied," he said,
"if the committee had delved into
the contributions made to him (Mc-
Carthy) . . . toward his fight on
Communism."
In another development, retired
Air Force Lt. Gen. George E. Strate
meyer announced formation of a
new group which will conduct a na
tionwide drive for 10,000,000 signa
tures backing McCarthy "and the
fundamental principles he symbol
izes."
