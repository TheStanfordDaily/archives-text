# Orchids by the Dozen
## 
### 
No recounts, no voided elections, no ballots
scattered by the wind — the Election Board
earned several dozen orchids with its very
efficient handling of the primary and final fall
elections.
Last year we were tempted at times to say
it couldn't be done. We are overjoyed to find
that our pessimism was unwarranted.
The Election Board has completely over
hauled and modernized the election procedure.
Outstanding features are the centralized vot
ing area and expansion to two days of balloting.
Another improvement, permanent we hope, is
having the ballots padded so that the students
staffing the booths just tear olf the proper bal
lots and so avoid the past disasters of ballots

scattered in the streets by the winds, necessi
tating voiding whole elections.
Not only were elections handled efficiently
in reference to previous years' fiascos — the
Election Board overcame the weather too and
adjourned to the Cubberley arcade when the
rains came.
Expansion of voting facilities to night ballot
ing for the graduate student is another of the
very fine improvements worked out by Elec
tion Board for the benefit of the student body,
undergraduates and graduates alike.
Election Board deserves orchids by the dozen
for proving that Stanford can and will hold
elections efficiently with no hitches, no botches.
In doing this, Election Board has developed an
excellent election system that is a credit to
Stanford. ,
