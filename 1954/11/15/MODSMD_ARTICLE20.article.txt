# 'Non-Aggression Pact'
## 
### 
As Big Game Week, 1954, begins, Stanford
and California are once more making public
their annual Big Game Agreement, which is
less formally known as "the non-aggression
pact."
That's right . . . once a year, Stanford Uni
versity prepares for a football game by draw
ing up, with the University of California, a
statement which says in part: . . there shall
be no 'raids' by the students of either Univer
sity on the campus of the other."
You'd hardly think it was a football rivalry.
In effect, Stanford and California are declaring
a truce. Let's take a brief critical look at our
"non-aggression pact."
First of all, is it effective? Does it stop or ap
preciably slow the usual grass-burning and
statue-painting?
Probably not. In the first place, the majority
of damage at Stanford during Big Game Week
is done by the local high schools and small
colleges. It's a long trip from Berkeley to Palo
Alto for anything more than a large project,
such as the bonfire bombing plot of last year.
Cal students do turn up with their paint and
their matches, but the high school kids do most
of the work.
At the same time, consider the effect of a
"non-aggression pact" on potential "aggres
sors. What is its effect on you? In a way, it
seems to add spice to the idea of Big Game
rivalry; it almost makes a game of the tra
ditional vandalism.
Second, why do we emphasize aggression

—and non-aggression—for only this week?
After all, the sort of thing which is labelled as
aggression in our Stanford-Cal "non-aggression
pact" goes on all year.
Sure, the Stanford-California rivalry is a hot
one, and perhaps even a bitter one, but we've
also seen, this year, theft of the Navy's goat,
the disappearance of a television banner at the
Illinois game, and two incidents last week: The
burning of San Jose State's rally bonfire by a
group of what a San Jose spokesman called
"Stanford unmentionables" and the subsequent
destruction of a Public Relations Committee
'Beat San Jose' banner near the Cellar.
Let's also consider the whole id-ea of Big
Game Agreements. In banning raids and speci
fying what shall not be done, they emphasize
the rowdy aspects of the football rivalry to the
point where football is almost forgotten.
This is a football game, and one of a series
which began in 1892. Non-aggression pacts,
guards at the bonfire, and a suspicious attitude
in both Berkeley and Palo Alto make it sound
more like war! Back in high school we used to
make a lot of noise over the rivalries, rocking
cars and throwing paper. But this is college
football, between two good football teams, and
talk of non-aggression pacts doesn't really
seem in keeping with the event.
But there will be raids, and the non-aggres
sion pact does give school administrations a
concrete weapon for disciplinary action. Per
haps the non-aggression pact is a good thing.
But it's certainly a negative approach.

is done by the local high schools and small
colleges. It's a long trip from Berkeley to Palo
Alto for anything more than a large project,
such as the bonfire bombing plot of last year.
Cal students do turn up with their paint and
their matches, but the high school kids do most
of the work.
At the same time, consider the effect of a
"non-aggression pact" on potential "aggres
sors. What is its effect on you? In a way, it
seems to add spice to the idea of Big Game
rivalry; it almost makes a game of the tra
ditional vandalism.
Second, why do we emphasize aggression

—and non-aggression—for only this week?
After all, the sort of thing which is labelled as
aggression in our Stanford-Cal "non-aggression
pact" goes on all year.
Sure, the Stanford-California rivalry is a hot
one, and perhaps even a bitter one, but we've
also seen, this year, theft of the Navy's goat,
the disappearance of a television banner at the
Illinois game, and two incidents last week: The
burning of San Jose State's rally bonfire by a
group of what a San Jose spokesman called
"Stanford unmentionables" and the subsequent
destruction of a Public Relations Committee
'Beat San Jose' banner near the Cellar.
Let's also consider the whole id-ea of Big
Game Agreements. In banning raids and speci
fying what shall not be done, they emphasize
the rowdy aspects of the football rivalry to the
point where football is almost forgotten.
This is a football game, and one of a series
which began in 1892. Non-aggression pacts,
guards at the bonfire, and a suspicious attitude
in both Berkeley and Palo Alto make it sound
more like war! Back in high school we used to
make a lot of noise over the rivalries, rocking
cars and throwing paper. But this is college
football, between two good football teams, and
talk of non-aggression pacts doesn't really
seem in keeping with the event.
But there will be raids, and the non-aggres
sion pact does give school administrations a
concrete weapon for disciplinary action. Per
haps the non-aggression pact is a good thing.
But it's certainly a negative approach.
As Big Game Week, 1954, begins, Stanford
and California are once more making public
their annual Big Game Agreement, which is
less formally known as "the non-aggression
pact."
That's right . . . once a year, Stanford Uni
versity prepares for a football game by draw
ing up, with the University of California, a
statement which says in part: . . there shall
be no 'raids' by the students of either Univer
sity on the campus of the other."
You'd hardly think it was a football rivalry.
In effect, Stanford and California are declaring
a truce. Let's take a brief critical look at our
"non-aggression pact."
First of all, is it effective? Does it stop or ap
preciably slow the usual grass-burning and
statue-painting?
Probably not. In the first place, the majority
of damage at Stanford during Big Game Week
is done by the local high schools and small
colleges. It's a long trip from Berkeley to Palo
Alto for anything more than a large project,
such as the bonfire bombing plot of last year.
