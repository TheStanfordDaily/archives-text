# GAIETIES:
## High Kicks, Whistled Tunes Prepare for Opening Night 
### JAE HUNLEY 
People doing high kicks. People mumbling lines under their
breaths. People whistling tunes over and over again. This is all
in preparation for the 1954 Big Game Gaieties which will open to
morrow night in Memorial Auditorium.
Every night lor the last few weeks, the cast for the show has

been meeting for practice in Wood-'*
pecker, in the Little Theater; or in
the Memorial Auditorium lobby and
main stage.
They come in shorts, pedal push
ers, jeans, and old T-sJfrirts. They
bring their books and try to study
between calls. They bring talent

â–º
I and infinite patience.
They need patience, because a re
hearsal is repetition, doing an act
over and over until everyone is
kicking on the right note, or sing
ing in perfect unison.
Directors run up and down the
aisles, suggesting, arranging, con
! I'erring, and sometimes screaming
! "Quiet!" Stage crews try different
lighting techniques, causing sudden
J blackouts and startling bursts of
I glaring light.
Sets fly up and down. Hammers
pound out a staccato monotone. But,
despite it all, tlife cast rehearses the
[ different acts, songs, and dances, in
a continual search for perfection.
Running through all the rehear
sals, as opening night draws closer,
is an intangible spirit of co-opera
tion, excitement, and haste. More
emphasis is put on how the cast
looks from the audience. "Smile!"
shouts the dance director.
Superstitions play a large part in
theatrical productions, and they be
come more apparent as the actual
night of performance nears. New
actors are instructed to "Never,
never sing while putting on make
up."
Furthermore, while other com
mon luck-bearing charms are used,
actors are never wished "good luck"
on a performance. Instead, the pop
ular remarks are "Give 'em hell" or
"Break a leg!"
