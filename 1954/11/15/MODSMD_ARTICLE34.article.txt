# Booters Beat Broncos 5-2
## 
### 
Stanford's dormant soccer team
finally came to life last Saturday
morning, and the Indians pounded
out a decisive 5-2 triumph over San
ta Clara on the losers' home field.
The Indian hooters, in notching
their second win of the year and
their second highest goal total of
the season, thus remained in con
tention for a playoff berth at the
end of the season, if they can beat
Cal next Saturday.
Left inside Sam Suarez and cen
ter-forward Bill Wren accounted for
all of the Indian scores, Suarez
counting thrice, two of these penalty
kicks, and Wren twice, both his
goals being head-ins of corner kicks.
Stanford piled up a 5-0 advantage
over the Broncos in the first three
quarters of the game. The Indian
seconds, playing the last quarter,
allowed Santa Clara its two scores.
Stanford played its finest defen
sive ball of the season, holding the
tricky Bronco forwards in check for
most of the game. The play of all
three halfbacks deserves mention.
