## Frosh Gridders Run Wild; Papooses Bury Cubs, 60-0 
### BOB DURAND 
Could Stanford ever beat California by sixty points? The fans
who watched the preliminary to the Indian-Spartan game on Sat
urday would not think this such a foolish question.
They saw a fired-up Indian freshman team run roughshod over
their counterparts from the University of California by a 60-0

margin. The win gives the Papooses
the right to claim the title of "best
ever."
Cal Cub coach Hal Grant said,
"Although they don't have the indi
vidual stars, I think that this year's
Stanford frosh have a better all
around team than the great club of
1948." He of course was referring to

the freshman eleven that had Bill
McColl, Gary Kerkorian, and Harry
Hugasian on its starting lineup.
The score, needless to say, set an
all-time record for the first-year
men from the two schools. The old
mark was set way back in 1923 when
the Cubs overran the Papooses and
Ernie Nevcrs, 54-0.
The statistics told the titory of the
game. That coach Bob Ghilotti's
yearlings were sparkling on defense
was brought out by the fact that the
visitors managed to gain a total of
only 90 yards net on offense.

On the other hand, the Card
freshmen rolled up a total of 272
yards rushing and 197 yards passing
for 16 first downs as compared to
the Cubs' eight.
TEAM EFFORT
Individually, it would be hard to
single out any one Papoose as all
who played turned in a top-flight
effort. However, the running of Lou
Valli and Bob Schmidt, the quarter
backing of Jack Douglas and I_.es
Hopkins, and the line play of Ar
mand DcWeese, Ed Bucher, and
Noel Robinson were especially com
mendable in the eyes of coach Ghi
lotti.
Among the reserves, the play of
Wallace Honeywell, Jerry Hitchman,
Laury Seigal, Gary Van Galder, and
Jim Bryer drew the praise of Ghi
lotti.
The Papoose touchdowns were
scored like this:
