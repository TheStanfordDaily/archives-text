"Nice going!"
San Jose State Coach Boh Bron
zan had written this on the black
board in the Spartan dressing room
and was making a point of shajung
each player's hand as he entered.
The atmosphere was light and re
laxed. The Spartan gridders were
slowly coming to the realization that
they had finally broken the jinx and
beaten Stanford for the first time in
the football history of the two
schools.
"A win like this had to be a team
effort," said Bronzan, "although it
was Tony Teresa who kept us alive
in a few spots. The boys were still
thinking about the COP game out
there."
At this point. Tom Louderbach,
who played an outstanding game at
guard for the visitors, burst into the
locker room whooping and hollering.
In a few seconds, his spirit had
caught on, and the whole wing of
the building shook in response.
"Yes," said Bronzan, "I'd say we
had a little more hustle than Chuck's
team out there today."
When asked to compare Stanford
and California in viuw of this Sat
urday's contest, the Spartan mentor
said, "It's hard to say. We played
our worst game of the season against
Cal, while today we played one of
our better.
"For Stanford's side, from the
standpoint of the Big Game, this
was probably the best medicine pos
sible."
As he walked ofT to congratulate
more of his team, he remarked, "We
ought to have homecoming up here
every week."
