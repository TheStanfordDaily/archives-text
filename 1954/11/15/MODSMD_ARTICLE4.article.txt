appearance of a dry day or two.
The 1954 bonfire has begun to take
shape, with the installation by local
telephone men of the 60-feet-and
higher poles that will support the
j fire.
Wood collection by the class of
'58 continues until Tuesday, with
j preliminary construction, the plac
ing of connecting boards, and con
struction of ladders moving into the
final stage this week.
Wednesday, freshmen will begin
the "Big Push," the all-out drive to
complete the pyre for Thursday
night's rally. Every freshman man—
there are over 700 — will have a
chance- to participate at one time or
another in the united effort.
Besides the connecting boards be
tween telephone poles, trenches
under the base of the structure have
also been readied, in order to trans
mit air up through the blaze and
keep it sizzling.
Twenty - four - hour guarding by
freshmen is also continuing this
week, with each Encina or Village
wing working a shift of either col
lecting or guarding. Chairman Hays
cautioned the guards to keep a
warning eye in the direction of San
Jose as well as Berkeley, since dan
ger is not cmfind to the East Bay
Area.
