# Spartans Thump Stanford, 19 to 14
## 
### 
"It had to happen eventually," said San Jose Coach Bob Bronzan.
And it finally did. 9
For a while, as the goal posts gave way and blue and gold
trimmed cars raced with horns blaring along campus roads, the
Spartan team and fans could not have told the story of what

happened. All they could do was
react.
However, the new scoreboard in
the Stadium with unruffled effi
ciency and electrical accuracy gave
the gist of the story: "Stanford 14,
San Jose 19." Thus you can be sure
that it did happen.
But how did it happen that San
Jose beat Stanford for the first time
in 54 years and 12 games?
The visitors from down the Pe
ninsula ran and passed as i# they
vyere possessed. And they were pos
sessed—with a fierce determination
to humble the proud Indian.
Tony Teresa and Fred Delgadillo
rambled for constant long gains. Hie
Spartan secondary picked off Stan
ford aerials to halt touchdowns
which would have reversed the de
cision. But most of all, the Staters
overcame the jinx; they wouldn't
beat themselves.
The sparse gathering in the Sta
dium waited for the jinx to take
hold. The Spartans had always
cracked before. And so the fans
waited. Lackadaisical Stanford
waited. The jinx never happened;
the turning point never came.
At least a turning point in Stan
ford's favor never came. The for
tunes turned against the Tribe, how
ever, with 3:38 showing on the clock.
The Indians had the ball third and
one on the San Jose 16. John Brodie
passed. Roy Hiram intercepted. He
ran the ball out to the 40. For Stan
ford that was the afternoon.
From the San Jose point of view,

they deserved their long - awaited
victory. From the Stanford point of
view, well . . . Stanford certainly
did not deserve to win.
In the words of Connie Juryis, "It
was like a bad dream." And in
deed the Indians spent enough of
the afternoon sleeping that they had
lots of time to dream. So did the
rooting section.
Bill Tarr, however, did not sleep;
he played a bang-up football game.
Chuck Taylor was accurate when he
said Tarr did much of his running
without help.
Taylor in the dressing room was
quiet: "I have two great understate
ments to make. We didn't play well
and we have a big job ahead of us
this week."
"Without a doubt they deserved to
win," Taylor continued. "The Spar
tans did a good job of running and
we did a poor job of tackling."
"It is hard to find anything good
to say about Stanford. At least we
didn't fumble very often, did we?"
Taylor asked. No. the Indians didn't
fumble; they threw five intercep
tions instead.


DOWN HE GOES—San Jose's Matt Vujevich is hit hard here by
three Indians after he picked up five yards in a bit of fourth
quarter action last Saturday. Making the stop for Stanford are
Ernie Dom (42), John Stewart (84), arid an unidentified Card.
