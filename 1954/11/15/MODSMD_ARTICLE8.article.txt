BUT WHO WAS IT?â€”This smashed Studebaker was the result
of an accident yesterday afternoon on Palm Drive. The car ap
parently skidded into a tree on the east side of Palm Drive, and
the driver received a fractured right arm and possible shoulder
separation, plus severe cuts. His condition was described at the
hospital as "severe but not critical." Police attempting to in
vestigate the accident, found the car registered under the name
of Hideo Kishimoto, visiting professor of Philosophy last year.
The Stanford tag, however, was a different name. At the hos
pital, the injured man gave his name as Takao Ueda, of 747 Santa
Ynez, the same address as Professor Kishimoto's.
