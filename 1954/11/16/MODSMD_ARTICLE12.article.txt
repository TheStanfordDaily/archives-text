# Since '98--No End To Bonfire Spirit
## 
### 
"There was no end to the enthusiasm and college spirit," wrote
a Stanford journalist in 1898, reporting on the first Big Game bon
fire rally.
"Co-eds filled the bleachers and showed their enthusiasm in
becoming ways. When the fire blazed up, the students circled

around it until songs and yells
were begun in the bleachers."
This was the simple begin
ning of a tradition that has been ob
served on the Farm for the past 5(5
football seasons, except for the
World War II years.
But today there is little that is
simple about Big Game bonfires.
Ten thousand students and towns
people—more or less, depending on
the weatber —are expected to be on
hand Thursday evening when the
big torch roasts at Laguhita's dry
bed.
They will be there to witness the
burning of a 60-foot-high pile of oil
drenched scrap wood and brush
that is being assembled this week
by some 800 freshmen. v
These 800 men are not scrounging
the countryside for armloads of
wood. They are following a complex
operational plan that has been per
fected over the years.
Hostilities inevitably develop,
with feeling running high between
the Cal and Stanford camps. Last
year Cal raiders almost succeeded in
an ingenious time bomb attempt to
prematurely level the structure. So
the frosh maintain a 24-hour guard
at the site on the bed of Lagunita.
Sophomore chairman Walt Hays,
last year's Class of '57 president,
began organizing his forces seven
weeks ago.
Stories went out to Peninsula
newspapers asking potential wood
donors to call in and freshmen until
today were gathering the material in
three trucks loaned by local mer
chants. For protection against sabo
tage, the wood is dumped in small

dispersed piles at the lake.
In the meantime, the PG&E has
donated 19 telephone poles and
erected them in a pattern of two
triangles, with the small inner tri
angle framing a central trench.
Crossbars are nailed on to create a
huge crib.
All this is preliminary to what the
freshmen call the "Big Push." For
a number of years, packing the wood
into the crib went on for several
days and nights. This, it was felt,
was soaking up too much frosh time
and the stacks were getting too high
for safety. The 1951 pile was said to
have reached 85 feet.
Under the "Big Push" plan, con
centrated work gets under way at 1
p.m. tomorrow and carries on in
shifts through the night under flood
lights. Freshman girls keep coffee
pots boiling.
Two huge ladders are propped
against the sides of the structure and
the freshmen pass up wood in buck
et-brigade fashion. Twenty-foot ex
tensions will be nailed to the poles
to bring the pyre to a height of 60
feet. At the very top will be placed
a papier-mache effigy of Oskie, Cal's
mascot.
As a final step the whole will be
drenched with 600 gallons of Diesel
oil, also donated by merchants.
After the torches are applied
Thursday night, the fire will blaze
majestically for two hours and then
gradually burn down for three or
four days. A few pole stumps and a
blackened scar in the lake bed will
mark the site for a repeat perform
ance in 1955.

prematurely level the structure. So
the frosh maintain a 24-hour guard
at the site on the bed of Lagunita.
Sophomore chairman Walt Hays,
last year's Class of '57 president,
began organizing his forces seven
weeks ago.
Stories went out to Peninsula
newspapers asking potential wood
donors to call in and freshmen until
today were gathering the material in
three trucks loaned by local mer
chants. For protection against sabo
tage, the wood is dumped in small

dispersed piles at the lake.
In the meantime, the PG&E has
donated 19 telephone poles and
erected them in a pattern of two
triangles, with the small inner tri
angle framing a central trench.
Crossbars are nailed on to create a
huge crib.
All this is preliminary to what the
freshmen call the "Big Push." For
a number of years, packing the wood
into the crib went on for several
days and nights. This, it was felt,
was soaking up too much frosh time
and the stacks were getting too high
for safety. The 1951 pile was said to
have reached 85 feet.
Under the "Big Push" plan, con
centrated work gets under way at 1
p.m. tomorrow and carries on in
shifts through the night under flood
lights. Freshman girls keep coffee
pots boiling.
Two huge ladders are propped
against the sides of the structure and
the freshmen pass up wood in buck
et-brigade fashion. Twenty-foot ex
tensions will be nailed to the poles
to bring the pyre to a height of 60
feet. At the very top will be placed
a papier-mache effigy of Oskie, Cal's
mascot.
As a final step the whole will be
drenched with 600 gallons of Diesel
oil, also donated by merchants.
After the torches are applied
Thursday night, the fire will blaze
majestically for two hours and then
gradually burn down for three or
four days. A few pole stumps and a
blackened scar in the lake bed will
mark the site for a repeat perform
ance in 1955.
"There was no end to the enthusiasm and college spirit," wrote
a Stanford journalist in 1898, reporting on the first Big Game bon
fire rally.
"Co-eds filled the bleachers and showed their enthusiasm in
becoming ways. When the fire blazed up, the students circled

around it until songs and yells
were begun in the bleachers."
This was the simple begin
ning of a tradition that has been ob
served on the Farm for the past 5(5
football seasons, except for the
World War II years.
But today there is little that is
simple about Big Game bonfires.
Ten thousand students and towns
people—more or less, depending on
the weatber —are expected to be on
hand Thursday evening when the
big torch roasts at Laguhita's dry
bed.
They will be there to witness the
burning of a 60-foot-high pile of oil
drenched scrap wood and brush
that is being assembled this week
by some 800 freshmen. v
These 800 men are not scrounging
the countryside for armloads of
wood. They are following a complex
operational plan that has been per
fected over the years.
Hostilities inevitably develop,
with feeling running high between
the Cal and Stanford camps. Last
year Cal raiders almost succeeded in
an ingenious time bomb attempt to
prematurely level the structure. So
the frosh maintain a 24-hour guard
