# State College Rule Reviewed
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 15 (UP)â€”
Solution of a California state college
paradox was tossed to the Attorney
General today.
California's 10 state colleges re
ceived funds for their operations
llirough June on the basis of their
"rated capacity." But the actual
number of students knocking on the
door of higher education far exceeds
that and Attorney General Edmund
G. Brown has ruled that no "quali
fied" student can be turned away.
The apparent answer is to get a
new ruling from Brown or change
the entrance qualifications.
At a meeting of college presidents
and state officials today, Legislative
Auditor A. Alan Post received in
formal agreement on his suggestion
to ask for a new ruling whether a
school may restrict the number of
students. New facts not considered
by the first Attorney General's opin
ion have popped up. Post said. He
pointed to a legislative counsel opin
ion which disagrees with Brown's
ruling.
And earlier, the presidents of the
state colleges agreed on a revised
and stricter formula of entrance re
quirements.
But that proposal, too, went to the
Attorney General after Superin
tendent of Public Instruction Roy E.
Simpson indicated possible Illegality
in a section which allowed individ
ual colleges to devise special en
hance exams.
