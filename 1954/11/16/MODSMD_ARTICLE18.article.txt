### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 (UP)—
Senator Francis Case (R., S.D.), a
member of the Senate censure com
mitee, withdrew his support today
from one of the two counts on which
the group unanimously recommend
ed censure of Senator Joseph R.
McCarthy.
The Wisconsin Republican's sup
porters hailed the switch as the
forerunner of a "complete change of
atmosphere." But censure advocates
said it had not affected their case in
any way.
Case reported that "new evidence"
supplied privately by Army Secre
tary Robert T. Stevens shows that
the Army's top brass let Irving Pe
ress, a former Army dentist, "slip
outjrof their grasp" deliberately once
McCarthy advised that Peress was a
''Fifth Amendment Communist"
who ought to be court-martialed.
'CENSURE WRONG'
Under such circumstances, Case
wrote, "it would be wrong" to cen
sure McCarthy for using rough lan
guage in cross-examining Brig. Gen.
Ralph W. Zwicker. This was the sec
ond count on which McCarthy's cen
sure was recomended .
Case's surprise move came as Sen.
William E. Jenner (R., Ind.), a close
friend of McCarthy, denounced the
censure move as "Communist - in
spired." Jenner made an impas
sioned speech calling on the Senate
to pigeonhole the committee's rec
ommendations.
HONOR CHALLENGED
Senator Sam J. Ervin (D., N.C.),
a member of the censure group, said
tlie Senate should not "soil" its hon
or "by permitting Senator McCar
thy to go unwhipped of Senatorial
justice."
An angry exchange came during a
45-minute public hearing by McCar
thy's Investigating Subcommittee on
the question of who promoted Irving
Peress, the former New York Army
dentist described by McCarthy as a
"Fifth Amendment Communist."
Senator Arthur S. Watkins (R.,
Utah), chairman of the special Sen
ate committee which recommended
that McCarthy be censured, and Mc-
Carfhy sat at opposite ends ol the
long committee table swapping an
14ry glares and barbed insults.
