## 
### 
TAIPEI, Formosa, Nov. 15 (UP)—Generalissimo Chiang Kai
shek's military leaders met today to plan retaliatory attacks against
the Chinese Communists for the sinking of a Nationalist destroyer
escort.
Bad weather north of Tachen Island hampered any retaliatory

action. The destroyer escort Tai
ping was sunk by four Commu
nist PT boats off Tachen early
yesterday after a night-long battle.
Nationalist warships and air force
planes covered the rough seas north
of the island outpost in a search for
survivors oi the 1,800-ton destroyer
escort.
The sinking of the American-built
destroyer escort was the most re
cent incident in the fighting between
Nationalist and Communist Chinese
since the Reds began to shell the
island outpost of Quemoy, off Amoy,
Sept. 3.
Since the renewal of the fighting
off the Communbyt mainland, the
Reds have bombed Tachen Island
and pounded other Nationalist-held
island outposts with artillery and
naval guns.
The action by the Communist tor
pedo boats surprised Nationalist
military circles in Taipei because
the Reds were believed to have only
a few naval vessels. However, re
cently it has been reported that the
Russians had handed over an in
creasing number of PT boats to the
Chinese Communists.
The Taiping and seven other DE's
were turned over to the Chinese Na
tionalists in 1946. The ship was the
former U.S.S. Decker and was built
at the Philadelphia Naval Yard in
1943. The destroyer escort saw con
siderable action against the Japa
nese in World War 11.
