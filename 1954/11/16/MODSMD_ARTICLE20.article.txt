# Taylor Sees Cal Defeat
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
Head Football Coach Chuck Tay
lor kicked off Big Game Week Sun
day night predicting that "Stanford
is ripe for a great victory this Sat
urday."
Taylor was speaking to 375 people
at Rickey's at a dinner in his honor
sponsored by the senior class.
"Everyone thinks we're no good,"
Taylor declared, "but if we play the
game we are capable of we can de
feat Cal."
Taylor described this year's leam
as "tough to coach" because of its
many inexperienced players. "But
I wouldn't feel right coaching any
other boys," he added.
"Don't forget," Taylor added, "we
(the coaches) are teachers like any
one else in* the University, and
sometimes what we teach doesn't
always work out on a test (game),
just like what professors teach
sometimes doesn't come out in the
bluebooks."
CRITICISM UNFAIR'
"Even so," he said, "it's unfair to
Criticize the play of any player on
the team, for they are just students
trying to learn something a bout
football and are spending most of
their time in other activities."
Taylor also stated that "Stanford
is the only school I would ever
coach at. Not only for its athletic
program, not only for its winning
teams, but the kind of boys we have
here are the finest possible."
"It's been a great pleasure coach
ing here," he concluded, "and being
an alumnus I've really grown to
appreciate this University. As far
as I am concerned it is the greatest
in the country, and many coaches I
know would give a great deal to
coach here."
