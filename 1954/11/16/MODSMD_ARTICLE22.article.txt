# Big Game Fever Rides High During This Week
## Rivals Bury Hatchet With Across-the-Bay Invitations 
### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
Stanford Is Catching the Big Game Fever, headlined one
Peninsula paper last Sunday, and it wasn't wrong.
Stanfordites in general have been feeling the malady more and
more as the cfate for the annual football battle with the Blue and
Gold came nearer. But just during the past few days the flushed

lace ana mgn pulse symptomat
ic of this happy mania have
really become apparent on the
campus.
The first signs came yesterday
with the start of the downtown dis
plays celebrating Big Game Week.
Tonight these football humours will
be highlighted in the first showing
of the '54 Big Game Gaieties, and
Thursday will raise the general tem
perature a few degrees more at the
rally and bonfire.
But Stanfordites aren't the only
ones who feel the effects of the Big
Game's approach.
CAL'S PLANS
Over on the other side of the
Bay, beneath the shadow of the
Leaning Tower of Berkeley, a few
bk)ods are almost at the boiling point
in anticipation of what they hope
will be a Bear triumph.
Yesterday on the Cal campus the
UCers celebrated Blue Monday,
during which time not a speck of red
was allowed to show. Even the tiro
engines were repainted a suitable
decorous color (blue) for the occa
sion.
However, according to the student
body officials of both schools, the
Big Game is not an occasion for real
warfare, scalping, shedding of blood,
or even paint. For the last few years
the two schools have signed non
aggression pacts guaranteeing their
friendship.
INVITATION GIVEN
This year planners have decided
to go a little farther.
During this year's Big Game Week
both the University of California
and Stanford have extended an offi
cial invitation to the students of
their traditional rival to come up
to visit.
Here at Stanford the Blue and
Gold will be sanctioned fully as il
has not been for many years.
