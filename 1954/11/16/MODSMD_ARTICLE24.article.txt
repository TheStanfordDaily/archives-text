# Student-Faculty Committee
## 
### 
Willi interviews for the newly formed Stu
dent I'acuity Committee being held this week,
there is every indication that constructive ac
tion can be expected in this all-important area
of relations between the two most integral
parts of the Stanford community.
When the ASSU Executive Committee es
tablished this new group two weeks ago we
agreed with the confidence and faith they ex
pressed in. the many hours of work which the
chairman and her two assistants have put into
the .formulation of the organization and pur
poses of the Student-Faculty Committee. We
also agreed with Excom's belief that, once or
ganized, this committee will thrive and will
be productive as it works toward its goal of
developing closer personal contact between
professors and their students. The situation
in the past and the situation as it stands today
has shown that this student-faculty bond can

not develop naturally and spontaneously. The
formal program now in the organizational
stage is obviously the most effective method
of starting the ball rolling toward the desired
goal.
Specific projects which the committee has
outlined include student-faculty dessert dis
cussions, symposiums, personal introductions
by professors, informal open - house discus
sions, and departmental clubs.
The committee has been established, a chair
man and a faculty adviser have been chosen.
With the selection of committee members now
under way, we .can see nothing but benefit
and mutual rewards for both students and fac
ulty if they will only follow through with the
same spirit and enthusiasm which has been
shown by those few who h'ave developed the
new 'committee and carried it through to its
present position.
