# CAMPUS OPINION
## A
						Letter from Prince Lightfoot 
### 
VI .v I use this facility to express my thanks to all
of -.•■Hi who have been so very kind to mc during the
p. i l Hi roc years. As you probably know, it is drawing
near to the end of my third year as Mascot to the
Stanford football team, and I must say that during
thi lime I have enjoyed every minute of it. You
< not imagine just how many fine people and stu
'ienl , and friends that I have met since I've been
with Stanford.
It is to the students that I owe a great deal of
thanks, for their being so kind in many ways, for go
in • to a lot of personal trouble for my comfort. May
I pei ;ona!!y thank the individuals involved, that arc
too numerous to mention by name, who have ar
ia!) < ;! for beds, seats, etc., during my stay at Stan
ford on weekends. There are no words in the Eng-
I h vocabulary with meaning enough to express the
: ineei e appreciation that I feel toward these students.
People have asked me if it is a difficult job being
Mascot to a university, and how do I find the time
to do the job besides working a full employment,
chedule. My answer to this question is: "For some
university it might really be a job, but for Stanford
II has been a pleasure, mainly because the students
make it so."
A for time, what is time, it is here today, tomor
row, and is here forever, and we all have plenty of
it il we want to make it so. It has been easy being
a Mascot for Stanford because the students have co
in -rated in every way possible, and without this
cooperation it would never have worked. Cooperation

is a big word -and Stanford makes koom use of it to
obtain the spirit and reputation that you all arc well
known for. No matter how black the chips are.
they'll never break the Stanford spirit.
This I like, for they (meaning Stanford) arc like
true Indians, and it is our beiicf that we arc here
on earth only a short time so enjoy it, and that we
should get the best out of what is handed us re
gardless of how big or small; for we arc like the
rocks on earth, when it rains we get wet and when
the sun shines we dry o(T—who's to deny how long
the rocks have stood and so be it the way of the
Indian and so be it the way of Stanford.
It has been fun representing your school at social
gatherings and at high schools and grammar schools
as well as churches. I only wish there was some
way for me to repay the individual students as well
as the body itself for making me feel so welcomed
other than just saying THANKS. Even in caps that
word isn't big enough.
I would like to also thank our team and to give
them credit for the wonderful games they gave us
this year. You certainly all should be proud of them
for they have met some very discouraging moments
while playing, but came back with a will to win
and a spirit to fight, and in my book they are one
of the finest teams. Taylor is also on my "Great
List" as I consider him as one of the best coaches of
all time. I thank him whole-heartedly and also his
assistants.
Your faithful Mascot,
PRINCE LIGHTFOOT
