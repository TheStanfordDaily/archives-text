# REGIONAL MEETING
## NSA Spotlights Role of Student 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
The place of the student in the university community—his rights, his
responsibilities, and bis problems—was the central theme of the NSA
regional assembly held last weekend at UCLA.
Delegates from member schools of the northern and southern districts
met for two days to elect a new regional president, consider in discussion

groups some of the basic areas of
student life, and hear a keynote ad
dress by Harry Lunn, national pres
ident of NSA.
The assembly voted to undertake
a revision of the NSA constitution
for the California - Nevada - Hawaii
region. A Stanford committee con
sisting of A 1 Loomis, NSA co-ordi
nator, and A 1 WiLson will handle the
revision.
It was also decided to hold the
spring NSA regional assembly at
Stanford. The assembly is tentative
ly Scheduled for some time in May.
Barbara Klausner, graduate stu
dent at UCLA, was elected regional
president for the remainder of the
academic year. She replaces Don
Gerstman, who was forced to vacate
his office due to pressure of other
activities.
STUDENT GOVERNMENT
The discussion group on student
government brought out the fact
that Stanford is unique among Cali
fornia universities in its independ
ence of student government from
the faculty and administration.
It was pointed out that other uni
versities, especially the University
of Southern California, operated
under organized party politics.
The cementing of closer relations
between students and faculty was
one of the topics brought up in the
discussion group on the academic
community. In this field, Stanford
received valuable suggestions from
smaller colleges which had systems
of social get-togethers between stu
dents and teachers.
Honor systems were studied, as
well as the question of academic
freedom. On the latter point, the
group agreed on the right of the
professor to express his own opin
ion (if he stated that his opinion
was only a personal one) and to
search for the truth in the subject
of his choice.
lIR STUDIED
Stanford's Institute of Interna
tional Relations received a close
scrutiny in the discussion of campus
international programming. Many
delegates used it as a model in
planning or bettering their own in
ternational program.
A point stressed in this discussion
group was that an International
Club could be greatly overempha
sized as a cure-all. Delegates agreed
that foreign students should be
urged to join as many types of ac
tivities as posisble, such as dra
matics, radio, and rally committees.
They also discussed the problem
of making American students want

to meet foreign students.
The discussion group on student
economic affairs compared views on
matters such as student discount
services and Korean veterans'
checks, and committees to study
both these matters were set up.
The comparative freedom of The
Stanford Daily in regard to admin
istration and student government
control was apparent in the discus
sion group composed of members of
the student press.
It was also brought out that The
Daily used more national and inter
national news than the other papers,
and expressed itself more freely and
more fully in political matters.
KEYNOTE SPEECH
In his keynote address, Harry
Lunn, national president of NSA,
told the assembly about the new
concept of the university commu
nity that has been springing up over
the United States. This community
seeks to unite students, faculty, and
administration to work on common
problems, and to build up respect
between the three parts of the com
munity.
"The purposes of any university,"
he declared, "are to awaken the stu
dent intellectually and to give him
the ability to live with himself and
with the world around him."
"In a university community," Lunn
stated, "students are faced with the
challenge that responsibilities go
along with their rights. Now we need
leadership more than ever before,
and training for this leadership can
and should come from the univer
sity."
Delegates from Stanford were A 1
Loomis, Sam Palmer. Margot Wood
worth, Bob Faust, Frank Speizer,
and Connie Gomperts. Alternates
were A 1 Wilson and Jim Sammct.

the ability to live with himself and
with the world around him."
"In a university community," Lunn
stated, "students are faced with the
challenge that responsibilities go
along with their rights. Now we need
leadership more than ever before,
and training for this leadership can
and should come from the univer
sity."
Delegates from Stanford were A 1
Loomis, Sam Palmer. Margot Wood
worth, Bob Faust, Frank Speizer,
and Connie Gomperts. Alternates
were A 1 Wilson and Jim Sammct.
The place of the student in the university community—his rights, his
responsibilities, and bis problems—was the central theme of the NSA
regional assembly held last weekend at UCLA.
Delegates from member schools of the northern and southern districts
met for two days to elect a new regional president, consider in discussion

groups some of the basic areas of
student life, and hear a keynote ad
dress by Harry Lunn, national pres
ident of NSA.
The assembly voted to undertake
a revision of the NSA constitution
for the California - Nevada - Hawaii
region. A Stanford committee con
sisting of A 1 Loomis, NSA co-ordi
nator, and A 1 WiLson will handle the
revision.
It was also decided to hold the
spring NSA regional assembly at
Stanford. The assembly is tentative
ly Scheduled for some time in May.
Barbara Klausner, graduate stu
dent at UCLA, was elected regional
president for the remainder of the
academic year. She replaces Don
Gerstman, who was forced to vacate
his office due to pressure of other
activities.
STUDENT GOVERNMENT
The discussion group on student
government brought out the fact
that Stanford is unique among Cali
fornia universities in its independ
ence of student government from
the faculty and administration.
It was pointed out that other uni
versities, especially the University
of Southern California, operated
under organized party politics.
The cementing of closer relations
between students and faculty was
one of the topics brought up in the
discussion group on the academic
community. In this field, Stanford
received valuable suggestions from
smaller colleges which had systems
of social get-togethers between stu
dents and teachers.
Honor systems were studied, as
well as the question of academic
freedom. On the latter point, the
group agreed on the right of the
professor to express his own opin
ion (if he stated that his opinion
was only a personal one) and to
search for the truth in the subject
of his choice.
lIR STUDIED
Stanford's Institute of Interna
tional Relations received a close
scrutiny in the discussion of campus
international programming. Many
delegates used it as a model in
planning or bettering their own in
ternational program.
A point stressed in this discussion
group was that an International
Club could be greatly overempha
sized as a cure-all. Delegates agreed
that foreign students should be
urged to join as many types of ac
tivities as posisble, such as dra
matics, radio, and rally committees.
They also discussed the problem
of making American students want

to meet foreign students.
The discussion group on student
economic affairs compared views on
matters such as student discount
services and Korean veterans'
checks, and committees to study
both these matters were set up.
The comparative freedom of The
Stanford Daily in regard to admin
istration and student government
control was apparent in the discus
sion group composed of members of
the student press.
It was also brought out that The
Daily used more national and inter
national news than the other papers,
and expressed itself more freely and
more fully in political matters.
KEYNOTE SPEECH
In his keynote address, Harry
Lunn, national president of NSA,
told the assembly about the new
concept of the university commu
nity that has been springing up over
the United States. This community
seeks to unite students, faculty, and
administration to work on common
problems, and to build up respect
between the three parts of the com
munity.
"The purposes of any university,"
he declared, "are to awaken the stu
dent intellectually and to give him
the ability to live with himself and
with the world around him."
"In a university community," Lunn
