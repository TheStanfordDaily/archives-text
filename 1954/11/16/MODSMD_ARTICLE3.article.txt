President Eisenhower asked the
Senate today in the interests of
"peace and freedom" to give prompt

the special Senate session, Mr. Ei

the entire Atlantic relationship de
pends to a very great extent upon
the attainment of these objectives."

tory's first great practical experi
ments in the international control of
armaments," Mr. Eisenhower said
the pacts "will ensure freedom and
equality for the people of Germany
and at the same time will avoid the
danger of a revival of German mili
