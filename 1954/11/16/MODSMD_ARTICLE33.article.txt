Engineering Journal has been wel
comed by engineering faculties and
students alike as an excellent con tern-'
porary source book.

Rut—this is not a "circulation advertise
ment" for the Journal.
We mention it here—because we think
a glance through any issue will give you
a pretty clear picture of the high stand

climate fhey lind in which to think and
to work at GM.
Certainly such standards, such view
