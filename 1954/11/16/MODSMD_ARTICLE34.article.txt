BOOMING OVER—Card freshman fullback Bob Schmidt booms
over from the one-yard-line in the Papoose's 60-0 trouncing of
the Cal frosh Saturday morning. This play, in the third guarter,
made the score 40-0. It's easy to see how the Card line domi
nated the game, as a host of Indians push ahead of Schmidt.
Among them are guard Noel Robinson (20), and tackle Ed
Bucher (22, just ahead of Schmidt.) Halfback Doug Dick (18)

watches from the backfield. Among the Bear players in the play
are guarterback Neil Fox (21), half A 1 Mascarin (11), center Bob
Jordan (50), tackle Bob Currie (76), and end Jim Duff (80). This
was the final game of the season for the "best-ever" Card frosh.
Their two-and-one record was spotted only by a 20-19 loss to
the USC freshmen, even though Stanford dominated statistics in
that game. —Daily photo by Frank Huntress.
