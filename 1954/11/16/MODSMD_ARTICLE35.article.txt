## 
### BOB DURAND 
During the past few years, Americans have been hearing more
and more about the increasing athletic prowess of the Japanese
people. Since World War 11, baseball and many other different
sports have become popular in Japan.
However, "the shorts of Japan have a long way to go before

they can compare with those ot the
United States," said Niro Ohtake, a
student of Keio University in Tokyo
who visited the Stanford campus re
cently.
Ohtake, who is president pro tern
of the International Student Asso
ciation of Japan, is a member of the
delegation which visited the United
States as part of the 1954 Japan-
American Student Conference.
Niro can speak.as an authority on
athletics, as he is an outstanding
athlete in his own right. He is also
in charge of sports for the "Mita
Campus." English - language news
paper at Keio University.
He presently holds the record for
the 100-meter dash for the Tokyo
area and is third in all Japan in the
event. When he was but a second
year high school student, he took
a sixth in the broad jump while
competing in the All-Japanese track
meet.
Niro docs not restrict himself to
just two events, however. He also
competes in the hop step and jump,
the high jump, javelin, discus, shot
put, and the 1,500-meter run.
Also professing to be proficient in
skiing, tennis, and baseball, the lik
able visitor is by rights a southpaw,
although he tosses the discuss with
his right hand and bats right.
BASEBALL MOST POPULAR
When asked what the most popu
lar sport was in Japan, there was
no hesitatfon in his voice as he an
swered, "Without doubt, it is base
ball."
"Everybody plays it,"he went on,
"from grade school right through
the professional leagues. We have
two seasons—in spring, from April
10 through June 30, and in fall,

from Sept. 10 through Nov. 1."
Ohtake explained that the biggest
and best - known organization was
the metropolitan league which con
sisted of university teams from To
kyo. Waseda, Keio, Rikkyo, Hosei,
and Meiji. He also compared the
annual game between Keio and Wa
seda as equal in rivalry to our own
Big Game with California.
Besides baseball, he said other
sports that ranked as top favorites
of the Japanese people were skiing,
swimming, track and field, basket
ball, tennis, and volleyball. Ameri
can football was just instituted and
has not yet caught on, according to
Niro.
WRESTLING, JUDO
Four ancient sports also carry
over from past days. Sumou, the
Japanese wrestling, is carried on at
both college and professional levels.
Judo is also still very popular. (Two
of the visiting delegation gave an
exhibition of it in the Eating Club
lounge on Tuesday night.)
The other two sports, Karate and
Kando. arc very dangerous and are
only done by the very skilled. Ka
rate is a form of punching where
one tries to hit is opponent in the
weak and vulnerable spots with both
hands and feet.
Kando is played with bamboo
swords and is similar to fencing, but
much more dangerous.
GOOD FACILITIES
According to Ohtake, the sports
facilities in Japan are very good.
The best is Meiji Stadium in Tokyo
which scats 50,000. Meiji is similar
to New York's Madison Square Gar
den in that it can acommodate
many sports, 'including bowling, ice
hockey, and of course baseball.
Niro said that "Four countries are
responsible for the upswing of ath
letics in Japan. The United States,
of course, has been very influential,
while England, Germany, and Aus
tralia have been big factors."
Among the visiting delegation are
also three other prominent athletes.
Masahira Ugaya and Kohei Ucda are
holders of the coveted black belt
which is given for excellence in
judo, while Kazuni Matsumoto is an
advocate of Sumou.

hockey, and of course baseball.
Niro said that "Four countries are
responsible for the upswing of ath
letics in Japan. The United States,
of course, has been very influential,
while England, Germany, and Aus
tralia have been big factors."
Among the visiting delegation are
also three other prominent athletes.
Masahira Ugaya and Kohei Ucda are
holders of the coveted black belt
which is given for excellence in
judo, while Kazuni Matsumoto is an
advocate of Sumou.
During the past few years, Americans have been hearing more
and more about the increasing athletic prowess of the Japanese
people. Since World War 11, baseball and many other different
sports have become popular in Japan.
However, "the shorts of Japan have a long way to go before

they can compare with those ot the
United States," said Niro Ohtake, a
student of Keio University in Tokyo
who visited the Stanford campus re
cently.
Ohtake, who is president pro tern
of the International Student Asso
ciation of Japan, is a member of the
delegation which visited the United
States as part of the 1954 Japan-
American Student Conference.
Niro can speak.as an authority on
athletics, as he is an outstanding
athlete in his own right. He is also
in charge of sports for the "Mita
Campus." English - language news
paper at Keio University.
He presently holds the record for
the 100-meter dash for the Tokyo
area and is third in all Japan in the
event. When he was but a second
year high school student, he took
a sixth in the broad jump while
competing in the All-Japanese track
meet.
Niro docs not restrict himself to
just two events, however. He also
competes in the hop step and jump,
the high jump, javelin, discus, shot
put, and the 1,500-meter run.
Also professing to be proficient in
skiing, tennis, and baseball, the lik
able visitor is by rights a southpaw,
although he tosses the discuss with
his right hand and bats right.
BASEBALL MOST POPULAR
When asked what the most popu
lar sport was in Japan, there was
no hesitatfon in his voice as he an
swered, "Without doubt, it is base
ball."
"Everybody plays it,"he went on,
"from grade school right through
the professional leagues. We have
two seasons—in spring, from April
10 through June 30, and in fall,

from Sept. 10 through Nov. 1."
Ohtake explained that the biggest
and best - known organization was
the metropolitan league which con
sisted of university teams from To
kyo. Waseda, Keio, Rikkyo, Hosei,
and Meiji. He also compared the
annual game between Keio and Wa
seda as equal in rivalry to our own
Big Game with California.
Besides baseball, he said other
sports that ranked as top favorites
of the Japanese people were skiing,
swimming, track and field, basket
ball, tennis, and volleyball. Ameri
can football was just instituted and
has not yet caught on, according to
Niro.
WRESTLING, JUDO
Four ancient sports also carry
over from past days. Sumou, the
Japanese wrestling, is carried on at
both college and professional levels.
Judo is also still very popular. (Two
of the visiting delegation gave an
exhibition of it in the Eating Club
lounge on Tuesday night.)
The other two sports, Karate and
Kando. arc very dangerous and are
only done by the very skilled. Ka
rate is a form of punching where
one tries to hit is opponent in the
weak and vulnerable spots with both
hands and feet.
Kando is played with bamboo
swords and is similar to fencing, but
much more dangerous.
GOOD FACILITIES
According to Ohtake, the sports
facilities in Japan are very good.
The best is Meiji Stadium in Tokyo
which scats 50,000. Meiji is similar
to New York's Madison Square Gar
den in that it can acommodate
many sports, 'including bowling, ice
hockey, and of course baseball.
