##

you can throw out all season's records when it's Big Game time.
"I had to learn that the hard way," said the Bear mentor, "when
in 1947 we were an overwhelming favorite. Stanford hadn't won
l game, and we had lost to only (JSC. The Cards had a lead until

the closing minutes, and to this clay
I don't know how we ever won."
Taylor verified his contention.
"History shows that upsets are the
common thing in the Cal-Stanford
battle. According to this season's
records, we don't belong on the
same field with Pappy's men.
"Our kids can't run and can't pass.
But they kpep trying to do a good
job. We can only hope to get the
most out of them that they have.
We also hope that California is over
looking us. And we're praying for
rain, too."
