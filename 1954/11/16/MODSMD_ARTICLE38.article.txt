# Queen Had Smileâ€” But No Grid Ticket
## 
### 
It takes more than looks to .get
into a football game, San Jose
State's Homecoming queen learned
Saturday.
Stanford students taking tickets at
the visiting team's gate Saturday
before the game were charmed but
not convinced when the visiting
team's homecoming queen showed
up, flashing a pretty smile but no
ticket.
After some finagling and much
backing up by better prepared San
Jose students, the queen was finally
allowed to pass through the gates.
After all, the ticket takers admit
ted somewhat shamefacedly, it's
tough to argue with a queen.
