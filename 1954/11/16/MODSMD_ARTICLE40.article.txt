# Manoukian Back; To Play Saturday
## 
### 
Chuck Taylor's battered gridders
ran through a light contact session
in a drizzling rain yesterday after
noon, cheered by the return of soph
omore guard Don Manoukian to
practice.
Manoukian, who has been out
since the Washington game with a
concussion, scrimmaged lightly in
pads. Trainer Connie Jarvis indi
cated that Manoukian will be ready
to go at full tilt Saturday.
Guard Donn Carswell, halfback
Ernie Dorn, and center Jerry Gold
berg all worked out in sweat clothes.
Carswell is nursing an injured nose,
Dorn has a pair of bruised hips and
a sore eye. Of the three, only Gold
berg is a serious problem. His old
knee injury will hamper him some
what Saturday, as it has for the
last three games.
