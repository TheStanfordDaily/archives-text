in the first score of the game. The
scoring play came on a short pass
from Larson to Bob Gledhill. On the
next play Tom Christie ran over for
the extra point.
The rest of the first half saw much
play in mid-field. But with time
running out Larson faded back and
threw with a scoring pass. The play
was good for a total of 50 yards.
The extra point was missed, and the
scoring for the day was over.
Encina SE, in receiving their sec
ond defeat of the season, was led by
John Clark who did the running and
passing. Good line play was shown
by John Jordan of 5E and Howard
Evans of Delta Tau Delta.
One of the few drives of the En
cina team came late in the second
half when a series of short passes
from Clark resulted in a 40-yard
drive. At this point, with the ball
on the Delts' 20-yard line, smart
pass defense by Larson, who looked
good in this department all day, cut
the drive short.
