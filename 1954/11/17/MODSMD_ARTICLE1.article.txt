# IFC Sets Jan. 5th As Rushing Date
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
After a long hassel in a three-hour session last night, the Inter
fraternity Council finally reached a decision on dates and irn
portant procedure for rushing winter quarter.
The fraternities will start a series of five open houses beginning
on Wednesday night, Jan. 5, and continuing through Saturday,
Jan. 8, at 9 p.m.

Until Saturday, Jan. 8. at 9 p.m.,
the no-contact rule between frater
nity men and freshmen will prevail
except during the hours of the open
hou.ses. At 9 formal rushing will
begin. "Formal rushing" is the term
the IFC uses to describe the period
of organized rushing during which
contact between freshmen and fra
ternity men is unlimited.
FORMAL RUSHING
The formal rushing period will
continue through the night of Fri
day, Jan. 14. Pledge card signing
will be held following pledge din
ners Saturday night, Jan. 15. On
Jan. 15 another no-contact provi
sion will be enforced until 5 p.m. in
order to permit freshmen to reach
a final decision about pledging with
out fraternity pressure.
For the first four open houses—
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
nights from 7:30 to 9:45 and Satur
day afternoon from 2:30 to 4:30—
freshmen will be divided alphabeti
cally. One half (A-M) may go to
Upper Row and the other half (N-
Z) to Lower Row on, Wednesday
and Friday. Group A-M will go to
Lower Row Thursday and Saturday
afternoon and N-Z to Upper Row.
For the final open house, Satur
day, Jan. 8, from 7:30 to 9 p.m., the
whole Row will be open to all fresh
men.
Hie major point of dispute at last
night's meeting was whether to
schedule an open house Saturday
afternoon. Sentiment was against it
because the afternoon open houses
last year were poorly attended—by
both freshmen and fraternity men.
DEADLOCK
But many saw no other choice and
the first vote on the afternoon open
house issue resulted in a 12-12 dead
lock. IFC President Otis Winters
declined to break the tie, requesting
that the house presidents indicate
what was motivating their vote.
The majority of the Council was
in favor of five open houses. Four
was decided as too few. But the IFC
refused to start rushing a day earlier
—Tuesday, Jan. 4—in deference to
the eating clubs which will hold an
open house that night.
The Council was also strongly
against postponing the start of open
houses one week as well as post
poning the start of formal rushing
one day to Sunday.
Thus if the IFC wanted five open
houses, it had to resort to Saturday
afternoon. And finally that decision
was reached.

day, Jan. 14. Pledge card signing
will be held following pledge din
ners Saturday night, Jan. 15. On
Jan. 15 another no-contact provi
sion will be enforced until 5 p.m. in
order to permit freshmen to reach
a final decision about pledging with
out fraternity pressure.
For the first four open houses—
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
nights from 7:30 to 9:45 and Satur
day afternoon from 2:30 to 4:30—
freshmen will be divided alphabeti
cally. One half (A-M) may go to
Upper Row and the other half (N-
Z) to Lower Row on, Wednesday
and Friday. Group A-M will go to
Lower Row Thursday and Saturday
afternoon and N-Z to Upper Row.
For the final open house, Satur
day, Jan. 8, from 7:30 to 9 p.m., the
whole Row will be open to all fresh
men.
Hie major point of dispute at last
night's meeting was whether to
schedule an open house Saturday
afternoon. Sentiment was against it
because the afternoon open houses
last year were poorly attended—by
both freshmen and fraternity men.
DEADLOCK
But many saw no other choice and
the first vote on the afternoon open
house issue resulted in a 12-12 dead
lock. IFC President Otis Winters
declined to break the tie, requesting
that the house presidents indicate
what was motivating their vote.
The majority of the Council was
in favor of five open houses. Four
was decided as too few. But the IFC
refused to start rushing a day earlier
—Tuesday, Jan. 4—in deference to
the eating clubs which will hold an
open house that night.
The Council was also strongly
against postponing the start of open
houses one week as well as post
poning the start of formal rushing
one day to Sunday.
Thus if the IFC wanted five open
houses, it had to resort to Saturday
afternoon. And finally that decision
was reached.
After a long hassel in a three-hour session last night, the Inter
fraternity Council finally reached a decision on dates and irn
portant procedure for rushing winter quarter.
The fraternities will start a series of five open houses beginning
on Wednesday night, Jan. 5, and continuing through Saturday,
Jan. 8, at 9 p.m.

Until Saturday, Jan. 8. at 9 p.m.,
the no-contact rule between frater
nity men and freshmen will prevail
except during the hours of the open
hou.ses. At 9 formal rushing will

the IFC uses to describe the period
of organized rushing during which
contact between freshmen and fra
ternity men is unlimited.
