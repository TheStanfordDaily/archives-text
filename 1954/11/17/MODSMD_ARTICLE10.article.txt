# $175,000 G.E. Laboratory Opens in Stanford Tract
## 
### RUSS WILKS Associate Editor, The Daily 
Twenty-five scientists, engineers, and technicians will move
into a brand new $175,000 General Electric research laboratory
today which is located in the Stanford light industrial tract.
A brief ceremony will officially open the attractive building this
Friday. The laboratory is situated on a 2'/2-acre site southeast of

California Avenue and about two"
blocks form El Camino Real in the
College Terrace area.
General Electric is the third mem
ber of Stanford's light industrial
family, joining Varian Associates
and Eastman Kodak.
OLDFIELD DIRECTOR
H. R. Oldfield Jr., former mana
ger of the G.E. Advanced Electronics
Center at Cornell University (Ith
aca, N.Y.), will direct microwave
research at the lab. Oldfield ex
pressed satisfaction with the swift
progress that was made in the con
struction of the building, which was
completed two weeks ahead of
schedule.
General Electric will concentrate
on developing and exploring the
application of microwave election
tubes, which according to" leading
scientists could have an effect simi
lar to a "second industrial revolu
tion."
The G.E. staff, which began lim
ited operations in temporary space
at the Stanford Research Institute,
will work in what is termed "a sci
entist's heaven." The 10,000-square
foot laboratory, which was built by
Stanford for G.E., is set back 70 feet
from California Avenue on fully
landscaped grounds. G.E.'s scientists
and technicians, who will number
150 when fully staffed, will work in
close co-operation with Stanford's
electronics research and microwave
laboratories.
Stanford's scientists moved into a
new $200,000 microwave laboratory
only last July.
THE MICROWAVE
The microwave is used now in
complex radar sets and military de
vices which are cloaked in a blanket
of official secrecy.
The G.E. Company believes that
its research could revolutionize
broadcast, communications, and ra
dar industries over the next 10
years.
Basically the microwaves "are

electrical radiations of such high
frequency that they have many of
the properties of visible light," ac
cording to Oldfield.
They can be utilized to create
packets of energy and radiated at
unbelievably high powers. Unlike
visible light, they cannot be seen
and arc barely affected by weather
elements or darkness, which makes
j them useful in a number of military
■ and commercial applications.
Oldfield stated that, "The revolu
tionary effect of microwaves is the
immensely new frequency 'spec
trum' which they make usable., Fre
quencies arc the 'real estate' of the
communications field, and real
estate has been pretty well used up
at the lower frequencies possible
with conventional electron tubes."
American and British scientists
j lid a lot with microwaves during
j World War 11, but Oldfield stated
j that "the science of microwaves can
j be considered to be in its very in-
I fancy."'

the properties of visible light," ac
cording to Oldfield.
They can be utilized to create
packets of energy and radiated at
unbelievably high powers. Unlike
visible light, they cannot be seen
and arc barely affected by weather
elements or darkness, which makes
j them useful in a number of military
■ and commercial applications.
Oldfield stated that, "The revolu
tionary effect of microwaves is the
immensely new frequency 'spec
trum' which they make usable., Fre
quencies arc the 'real estate' of the
communications field, and real
estate has been pretty well used up
at the lower frequencies possible
with conventional electron tubes."
American and British scientists
j lid a lot with microwaves during
j World War 11, but Oldfield stated
j that "the science of microwaves can
j be considered to be in its very in-
I fancy."'
Twenty-five scientists, engineers, and technicians will move
into a brand new $175,000 General Electric research laboratory
today which is located in the Stanford light industrial tract.
A brief ceremony will officially open the attractive building this
Friday. The laboratory is situated on a 2'/2-acre site southeast of

California Avenue and about two"
blocks form El Camino Real in the
College Terrace area.
General Electric is the third mem
ber of Stanford's light industrial
family, joining Varian Associates
and Eastman Kodak.
OLDFIELD DIRECTOR
H. R. Oldfield Jr., former mana
ger of the G.E. Advanced Electronics
Center at Cornell University (Ith
aca, N.Y.), will direct microwave
research at the lab. Oldfield ex
pressed satisfaction with the swift
progress that was made in the con
struction of the building, which was
completed two weeks ahead of
schedule.
General Electric will concentrate
on developing and exploring the
application of microwave election
tubes, which according to" leading
scientists could have an effect simi
lar to a "second industrial revolu
tion."
The G.E. staff, which began lim
ited operations in temporary space
at the Stanford Research Institute,
will work in what is termed "a sci
entist's heaven." The 10,000-square
foot laboratory, which was built by
Stanford for G.E., is set back 70 feet
from California Avenue on fully
landscaped grounds. G.E.'s scientists
and technicians, who will number
150 when fully staffed, will work in
close co-operation with Stanford's
electronics research and microwave
laboratories.
Stanford's scientists moved into a
new $200,000 microwave laboratory
only last July.
THE MICROWAVE
The microwave is used now in
complex radar sets and military de
vices which are cloaked in a blanket
of official secrecy.
The G.E. Company believes that
its research could revolutionize
broadcast, communications, and ra
dar industries over the next 10
years.
Basically the microwaves "are

electrical radiations of such high
frequency that they have many of
the properties of visible light," ac
cording to Oldfield.
They can be utilized to create
packets of energy and radiated at
unbelievably high powers. Unlike
visible light, they cannot be seen
and arc barely affected by weather
elements or darkness, which makes
j them useful in a number of military
■ and commercial applications.
