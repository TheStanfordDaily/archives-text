### 
\ raid on the University of Cali
fornia campus night before last, al
legedly by Stanford students, left
in its wake a 10-foot tall papier
mache Indian in the middle of Cal's
Eshleman Court, a lantern hung
from the top of the Campanile, and
big red S's on university buildings.
Two S's were painted on the Al
pha Phi sorority house and another
two were splattered on two ticket
booths at the south end of Memorial
Stadium.
According to Richard L. Balch,
Chief Counselor for Men, attempts
at discovering the identity of the
raiders had failed, but added he
hoped that "hereafter we could keep
our rivalry on the gridiron."
