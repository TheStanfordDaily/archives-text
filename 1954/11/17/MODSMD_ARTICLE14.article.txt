WASHINGTON, Nov. 16 (UP)â€”
Secretary of State John Foster Dul
les gave Communist China stern new
warning today that an attack on
Formosa would mean hostilities with
the United States.
The Secretary's statement was in
reply to questions about a private
lunch meeting he held in New York
Monday with Latin American dele
gates to the United Nations. Asked
about conflicting reports of what he
said, Dulles denied he had predicted
any increasing hostile action in the
Formosa area.
He said he told the Latins the
Reds' proclaimed intentions toward
Formosa add up to a serious cloud
on the horizon. He said a Commu
nist attempt to conquer the big is
land off the China coast would mean
hostilities with this country.
