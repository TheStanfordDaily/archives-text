# Excom to Discuss New ASSU Constitution Tonight
## 
### DICK MANSFIELD Associate Editor, The Daily 
The student judiciary structure at Stanford will be a topic of
debate in the weekly Executive Committee meeting tonight as
discussion opens on the proposed new ASSU constitution.
The first trial draft of the proposed constitution was drawn up
by a committee headed by Harrison Schmidt, '54, who is now with

the Air Force in Texas, and was re
ceived by Excom earlier this quar
ter.
The draft constitution was accom
panied-by the committee's 'Rationale
and Discussion of Issues,' which pro
poses to clarify reasons for changes
in the existing ASSU Constitution.
Exeom will discuss the draft con
stitution by sections, and tonight
Article IV, Judiciary, will be con
sidered.
Few real differences exist between
the judiciary setup proposed in the
draft constitution and that which
is now in effect. A change in nomen
clature and formal addition of one
office are the main points of differ
ence.
Schmidt's committee proposes the
name 'Judicial Council' to take the
place of the currently-used title
'Student Board of Control.'
This suggestion is "in the interest
of clarity," according to the com
mittee's report. "Hie concept of
student control in this field is now
well established and the name serves
primarily to create confusion," the
l'eport states.
Tlie proposed constitution would
create the office of Counselor, "to
serve ... as (Judicial Council's)
principal administrative officer yul
legal adviser."
Explaining this proposal, the com
mittee's report says that "communi
cation with both the legislative and
executive organs appears to be the
greatest problem existing in this

proposes a Student Councelor "to
(judiciary) field." The committee
aids in both communication and ad
ministration."
The report indicates that the com
mittee relegated "several matters to
the bylaws in the interest of flexi
bility."
The number of members of Men's
and Women's Council, although the
bodies would be equal in size, is un
defined. The present constitution
specifies five in each.
No provision is made in the pro
posed constitution for election of Ju
dicial Council members. There is
no provision for formation by the
Judicial Council of its own rules and
regulations. No provision is made
for summer quarter student judic
iary.
These points are brought out with
in the body of the present constitu
tion. Schmidt has not as yet for
warded proposed bylaws lor the
proposed constitution to Excom.
In other respects, the proposed
constitution outlines a judicial setup
closely resembling the present sys
tem. Judicial Council would con
sist of Men's and Women's councils,
as the Council for Student Control
does now. Powers of the Judicial
Council would be fundamentally the
same as those of the present Coun
cil.
Discussion of the proposed ju
diciary structure will begin ul 8 !U)
tonight in the: Excom Hornn.
