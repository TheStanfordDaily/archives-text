### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
It's been in the back of your mind all season- you've heard it
spoken as you passed by, you've seen it written on the top. c ; of
desks:
BEAT CAL!
Today you'll see that slogan all over campus; bannered over

the street in front of the Collar,
pinned to shirts und sweaters and
caps, printed in big red-ant)-white
letters.
Today is Beat Cal Day.
The traditional little round pins
with their red-printed slogans will
be passed out starting at 8 this:
morning in front of the Cellar, at
Engineering Corner, and in front of
the Main Library.
The buttons not only highlight
the third day of Big Game Week,
but they also emphasize the theme
of the whole week, which started
Monday with the window displays
of downtown Palo Alto merchants,
and went into high gear last night
with the first performance of ihe
1954 Big Game paieties.
