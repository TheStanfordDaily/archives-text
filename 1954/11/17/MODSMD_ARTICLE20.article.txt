# Toward a New Constitution
## 
### 
Another step along the long, slow road to
a new Stanford student government will be
taken tonight when the Executive Committee
opens discussion of the new ASSU draft con
stitution.
This proposed constitution, which would
completely overhaul the present ASSU gov
ernment, is the work of a special constitution
committee appointed by last year's Executive
Committee.
Headed by Harrison Schmidt, this group of
political science graduate students studied the
present ASSU government, interviewed heads
of administrative boards and others active in
the ASSU, and presented their ideas for a new
constitution to the Executive Committee for
criticism and suggestions.
The draft constitution which they have sub
mitted to the Executive Committee is the result
of their summer-long effort to couch these ideas
and suggestions in constitutional languages.
Tonight's discussion will center around the
proposed judicial changes. In succeeding
weeks the executive and legislative branches
will be considered.

Members of the Executive Committee have
taken it upon themselves to memorize the draft
constitution and scrutinize the reasons behind
the suggested changes. In their hands is placed
the task of writing the final constitution which
will be presented to the student body in a
referendum next quarter.
There is more to a new constitution, how
ever, than study and debate by the Executive
Committee. If the initial responsibility for the
success of this work lies with the Excom mem
bers, the final responsibility falls to each stu
dent at Stanford.
He is the one who must study the proposals
as they are discussed each week, so that he
may understand the new constitution. He is
the one who must offer comments and criti
cisms, so that the new constitution will re
flect his ideas.
Establishing a constitution under which we
agree to be governed—that is the ba§is of de
mocracy. And functioning democracy at Stan
ford, as everywhere, depends on the interest
and support of every individual.
