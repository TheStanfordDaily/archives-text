## Mendes-France—A Nationalist

(Editor's Note: following article was written
by Kritii I*. Ilochleitncr, an ASSU foreign scholar
from Austria last year, wlio is now working for an
M.A. degree in economics. His is the first in a series
of articles written by foreign students on subjects of
general concern. Foreign students wishing to ex
press their views on his article or any other similar
topic are urged to send in articles to The Daily to be
printed in the International Forum column.)
When Mendes-France arrives in Washington, D.C.
today. President Eisenhower will receive one of the
most dynamic French Premiers since Clemenceau.
Much has been written in this country about his
Indochina peace settlement, his role at the recent
Paris conference, and his so-called "New Deal" eco
nomic policies in France.
One of the strongest features of the French po
litical character is to call everything progressive and
revolutionary. It is somehow necessary in political
life to be "left-wing." One who observes the French
political scene, will soon recognize that everybody
who opposed the late Louis XVT can be considered
"left" and that most conservative parties call them
selves "revolutionary."
Forgotten in the press was the recent meeting of
the Council of Ministers of the European Steel and
Coal Community (Schuman Plan.) Mr. Uliver, the
French delegate and a minister in Mendes' cabinet,
attacked the policy of Jean Monnet, who is working
hard to keep the common market for coal and steel
going. Uliver stated that from now on "national
rights have to be more respected," and he opposed
further attempts to extend the federal powers of the
Community.
Somehow this is the logical consequence of the
policy inaugurated by Mendes since the defeat of
EDC in the French parliament. It confirms only a
fact which every "European" has long suspected
since Mendes became Premier—namely that French
nationalism is riding high again and the idea of a
"united Europe" has received its greatest setback
since the war.
Of course Mendes-France pays lip service to Eu
ropean integration. The idea is too strong with
French youth for him to do otherwise. But what has
he really done for Europe?
He went to Brussels and asked to modify EDC
so that the revolutionary federal principle would
not apply. When he was coldly turned down by the
other European statesmen, he told the French parlia
ment during the short EDC debate that his national
pride was humiliated. Without a move he watched
the assembly kill EDC before a real debate was
undertaken. Today many who know French poli
tics are convinced that if he had backed EDC it
would have passed, for he had great popularity
after the settlement in Indochina.

The defeat of EDC has been the greatest setback
for European unity. Its substitute, the Paris Agree
ment, is far fram being ratified. France has de
manded the Saar from Germany as the price for
German sovereignty. "Europeanization" should make
this bitter pill easier for German public opinion to
swallow. But somehow any "Europeanization" where
France alone keeps the economic curbs, and after the
French rejection of EDC, seems more like French
national interest than common European welfare.
The recent French statement at the Coal and Steel
Community meeting clearly shows this new trend of
French policies. In the mind of Mendes-France a
real Europe can only be realized when France is
economically strong enough to match Germany.
Mendes, the man who likes deadlines, seems to for
get that time is working against Europe.
The tremendous economic expansion of the U.S.
and U.S.S.R. show that Europe, broken up in frag
ments. cannot hold pace. Monnet, the French econ
omist, has realized this and said that only European
integration will give her a chance to compete and to
provide prosperity for all the people of the continent
including the French.
Mendes thinks that he can build up French econ
omy on a national basis and achieve European unity
without giving up sovereign rights. He forgets that
in making it more difficult for the Coal and Steel
Community to operate he serves neither the peoples
of Europe nor of France.
What national state in Europe today can provide
its citizens with security and prosperity? What Eu
ropean government alone can provide the huge funds
necessary today for defense and technical and scien
tific progress? None.
Only the collaboration of all can guarantee eco
nomic expansion, mass production, and the raising of
the general standard of living. Only common en
dowment will provide European research institutes
with the funds necessary for nuclear research. To
everybody who thinks realistically and who has seen
the workings of a huge market such as the U.S., the
national states of Europe look like relics of charming
times gone by in an age of continental powers.
So far Mendes-France has appealed to French na
tionalism. His foreign and economic policies are noth
ing "revolution?ry" as were the policies of Robert
Schuman and Jean Monnet. Some might argue that
his policy is more realistic. This has been European
policy for centuries, but the result has always been
European conflicts and the decline of the continent.
I think that most "realists" and "idealists" will
agree with thousands of young French, Germans,
Dutch, and Austiians that only something new, some
thing that is real progress, can save the continent.
So far we young Europeans are still waiting for such
a "New Deal" from Mendes-France.

Coal Community (Schuman Plan.) Mr. Uliver, the
French delegate and a minister in Mendes' cabinet,
attacked the policy of Jean Monnet, who is working
hard to keep the common market for coal and steel
going. Uliver stated that from now on "national
rights have to be more respected," and he opposed
further attempts to extend the federal powers of the
Community.
Somehow this is the logical consequence of the
policy inaugurated by Mendes since the defeat of
EDC in the French parliament. It confirms only a
fact which every "European" has long suspected
since Mendes became Premier—namely that French
nationalism is riding high again and the idea of a
"united Europe" has received its greatest setback
since the war.
Of course Mendes-France pays lip service to Eu
ropean integration. The idea is too strong with
French youth for him to do otherwise. But what has
he really done for Europe?
He went to Brussels and asked to modify EDC
so that the revolutionary federal principle would
not apply. When he was coldly turned down by the
other European statesmen, he told the French parlia
ment during the short EDC debate that his national
pride was humiliated. Without a move he watched
the assembly kill EDC before a real debate was
undertaken. Today many who know French poli
tics are convinced that if he had backed EDC it
would have passed, for he had great popularity
after the settlement in Indochina.

The defeat of EDC has been the greatest setback
for European unity. Its substitute, the Paris Agree
ment, is far fram being ratified. France has de
manded the Saar from Germany as the price for
German sovereignty. "Europeanization" should make
this bitter pill easier for German public opinion to
swallow. But somehow any "Europeanization" where
France alone keeps the economic curbs, and after the
French rejection of EDC, seems more like French
national interest than common European welfare.
The recent French statement at the Coal and Steel
Community meeting clearly shows this new trend of
French policies. In the mind of Mendes-France a
real Europe can only be realized when France is
economically strong enough to match Germany.
Mendes, the man who likes deadlines, seems to for
get that time is working against Europe.
The tremendous economic expansion of the U.S.
and U.S.S.R. show that Europe, broken up in frag
ments. cannot hold pace. Monnet, the French econ
omist, has realized this and said that only European
integration will give her a chance to compete and to
provide prosperity for all the people of the continent
including the French.
Mendes thinks that he can build up French econ
omy on a national basis and achieve European unity
without giving up sovereign rights. He forgets that
in making it more difficult for the Coal and Steel
Community to operate he serves neither the peoples
of Europe nor of France.
What national state in Europe today can provide
its citizens with security and prosperity? What Eu
ropean government alone can provide the huge funds
necessary today for defense and technical and scien
tific progress? None.
Only the collaboration of all can guarantee eco
nomic expansion, mass production, and the raising of
the general standard of living. Only common en
dowment will provide European research institutes
with the funds necessary for nuclear research. To
everybody who thinks realistically and who has seen
the workings of a huge market such as the U.S., the
national states of Europe look like relics of charming
times gone by in an age of continental powers.
So far Mendes-France has appealed to French na
tionalism. His foreign and economic policies are noth
ing "revolution?ry" as were the policies of Robert
Schuman and Jean Monnet. Some might argue that
his policy is more realistic. This has been European
policy for centuries, but the result has always been
European conflicts and the decline of the continent.
I think that most "realists" and "idealists" will
agree with thousands of young French, Germans,
Dutch, and Austiians that only something new, some
thing that is real progress, can save the continent.
So far we young Europeans are still waiting for such
a "New Deal" from Mendes-France.

tics are convinced that if he had backed EDC it
would have passed, for he had great popularity
after the settlement in Indochina.

The defeat of EDC has been the greatest setback
for European unity. Its substitute, the Paris Agree
ment, is far fram being ratified. France has de
manded the Saar from Germany as the price for
German sovereignty. "Europeanization" should make
this bitter pill easier for German public opinion to
swallow. But somehow any "Europeanization" where
France alone keeps the economic curbs, and after the
French rejection of EDC, seems more like French
national interest than common European welfare.
The recent French statement at the Coal and Steel
Community meeting clearly shows this new trend of
French policies. In the mind of Mendes-France a
real Europe can only be realized when France is
economically strong enough to match Germany.
Mendes, the man who likes deadlines, seems to for
get that time is working against Europe.
The tremendous economic expansion of the U.S.
and U.S.S.R. show that Europe, broken up in frag
ments. cannot hold pace. Monnet, the French econ
omist, has realized this and said that only European
integration will give her a chance to compete and to
provide prosperity for all the people of the continent
including the French.
Mendes thinks that he can build up French econ
omy on a national basis and achieve European unity
without giving up sovereign rights. He forgets that
in making it more difficult for the Coal and Steel
Community to operate he serves neither the peoples
of Europe nor of France.
What national state in Europe today can provide
its citizens with security and prosperity? What Eu
ropean government alone can provide the huge funds
necessary today for defense and technical and scien
tific progress? None.
Only the collaboration of all can guarantee eco
nomic expansion, mass production, and the raising of
the general standard of living. Only common en
dowment will provide European research institutes
with the funds necessary for nuclear research. To
everybody who thinks realistically and who has seen
the workings of a huge market such as the U.S., the
national states of Europe look like relics of charming
times gone by in an age of continental powers.
So far Mendes-France has appealed to French na
tionalism. His foreign and economic policies are noth
ing "revolution?ry" as were the policies of Robert
Schuman and Jean Monnet. Some might argue that
his policy is more realistic. This has been European
policy for centuries, but the result has always been
European conflicts and the decline of the continent.
I think that most "realists" and "idealists" will
agree with thousands of young French, Germans,
Dutch, and Austiians that only something new, some
thing that is real progress, can save the continent.
So far we young Europeans are still waiting for such
a "New Deal" from Mendes-France.

When Mendes-France arrives in Washington, D.C.
today. President Eisenhower will receive one of the
most dynamic French Premiers since Clemenceau.
Much has been written in this country about his
Indochina peace settlement, his role at the recent
Paris conference, and his so-called "New Deal" eco
nomic policies in France.
One of the strongest features of the French po
litical character is to call everything progressive and
revolutionary. It is somehow necessary in political
life to be "left-wing." One who observes the French
political scene, will soon recognize that everybody
who opposed the late Louis XVT can be considered
"left" and that most conservative parties call them
selves "revolutionary."
Forgotten in the press was the recent meeting of
the Council of Ministers of the European Steel and
Coal Community (Schuman Plan.) Mr. Uliver, the
French delegate and a minister in Mendes' cabinet,
attacked the policy of Jean Monnet, who is working
hard to keep the common market for coal and steel
going. Uliver stated that from now on "national
rights have to be more respected," and he opposed
further attempts to extend the federal powers of the
Community.
Somehow this is the logical consequence of the
policy inaugurated by Mendes since the defeat of
EDC in the French parliament. It confirms only a
fact which every "European" has long suspected
since Mendes became Premier—namely that French
nationalism is riding high again and the idea of a
"united Europe" has received its greatest setback
since the war.
Of course Mendes-France pays lip service to Eu
ropean integration. The idea is too strong with
French youth for him to do otherwise. But what has
he really done for Europe?
He went to Brussels and asked to modify EDC
so that the revolutionary federal principle would
not apply. When he was coldly turned down by the
other European statesmen, he told the French parlia
ment during the short EDC debate that his national
pride was humiliated. Without a move he watched
the assembly kill EDC before a real debate was
undertaken. Today many who know French poli
tics are convinced that if he had backed EDC it
would have passed, for he had great popularity
after the settlement in Indochina.
