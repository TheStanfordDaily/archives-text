# Frosh Start Bonfire 'Big Push' Today

### DON JACKSON 
The bonfire "Big Push," an idea
created to solve a perennial prob
lem and Carried through by a deter
mined band of underclassmen, just
might prove to be another one of
those peculiar, pleasant and potent
things called Stanford traditions,
driginated only last year as a re
sult of necessity and ingenuity, the
"Big Push" turned out so success
fully that it has been adopted for
construction of the Big Game bon
fire this year. The Axe tradition got
started in just about, this manner,
and so did the bonfire itself, and no
one is wagering any Big Game tick
ets that the Big Push won't follow
the same pattern.
The birth of the Big Push was ef
fected by a joint effort of imagina
tive and problem-beset minds. Mrs.
Ellene Sumner, director of Encina;
former head Encina sponsor Mcl
Butler; Chuck Kashima, 1953 Big
Game chairman; and last year's
bonfire chairman Dick Mansfield all
had a hand in the new arrival.
In the five years preceding last
year's fire, the annual fall quarter
event had become an increasing
problem. The main difficulty was
(he freshman time that it consumed;
time that should, according to the
experts on such things, be spent in
study or sleep.
Until 1953 the fire was built every
year in about the final three days
before the bonfire rally. This led to
a concentration of lower class effort

during the actual building, which
disrupted the general routine and
was adding to both physical and
academic danger. Physical danger
was evident since the frosh were so
tired by the end of the third day of
work or so that accidents naturally
increased. Academic danger was
created when half a week crept by
with hardly the turning of a text
book page.
Mrs. Sumner was the one who ac
tually suggested a "Big Push" idea,
the plan of concentrating all the
work in one 24-hour period just be
fore the fire was scheduled to be lit.
The idea met with immediate suc
cess and seemed to include no end
of practical as well as theoretical ad
vantages. For one, it now became
more difficult for hostile invaders
from Berkeley way to commit their
sinful deeds, with the structure only
standing in to to a few hours before
it was cremated. For another, it
added to the freshman spirit, the
idea of a united crusade of labor.
In detail, the "Big Push" plan
called for an assemblage of the
forces around noon the day before
the rally, with all able freshmen
contributing to the work and thus
making it possible to complete the
structure in 24 hours or less. Three
ladders were to be put up the side
of the frame, where frosh would sit
and pass brush wood up to the top.
Mansfield, who supervised the
bonfire operations last year, said he
was "more than satisfied" with the

results of the Big Push, primarily
since the construction was com
pleted some nine hours ahead of
schedule. '"The big influx of fresh
men came at around 2 p.m. Wednes
day. At 6. we had to add extensions
to the 40-foot poles we had put up
previously." Mansfield added.
By 3 a.m. the structure had risen
to a height of 57 feet. At the peak
hour, around 11 a.m., over half the
freshman class was on hand and
working to beat the clock. Even the
menace of a Selective Service test
given the next day didn't slow down
the flow of willing workers.
The Push did breed a few hazards,
however, which this year's bonfire
committee hopes to elude. The rush
and confusion surrounding the mass
effort led to a few accidents, one of
which turned out to be serious. The
emphasis on speed also stimulated
the now-famous Cal time bomb at
tempt, which could have meant dis
aster for anyone near the structure
at the time the bomb went off.
Walt Hays, who is chairman of
this year's bonfire committee, ha*
followed almost to the letter the
plan inaugurated by the 1953 com
mittee, except for a few minor in
novations. Among them arc the use
of spliced telephone poles, providing
unlimited height, and two ladders
rather than three.
The "Big Push," then, seems here
to stay ,and might be just as famil
iar to the Stanford student of 2004 as
the bonfire is to us today.
