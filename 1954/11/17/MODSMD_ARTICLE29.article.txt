# Jim Walker asks:
## Can a mechanical engineer make real progress in a chemical firm? "Pick" Pickering answers: 
### 
Well, .'Jim, Mml's what Mh! lawyers call a loading
question, and the answer leads right into my baili
wick. I came to Du Pont in J 940, after taking a com
bined mechanical and electrical engineering course.
So T had what you might call a double reason for
wondering about my future with a chemical firm.
1 soon learned that the success of a large-scale
chemical process is vitally dependent upon mechan
ical equipment. And the success of this mechanical
equipment—especially for a new process—depends
on (1) Research, (2) Development, (3) Plant Engi
neering, and (4) close Supervision. The net result is
that a mechanical engineer at Du Pont can progress

My own Du Pont experience includes mechanical
engineering work in fields as varied as atomic energy,
fabrics and finishes, and nylon manufacture. Every
one of these brought with it a new set of challenging
problems in construction, instrumentation, and
power supply; and every one provided the sort of
opportunities a man gets in a pioneering industry.
So, to answer your question, Jim, a mechanical
engineer certainly has plenty of chances to get, some
where with a chemical company like Du Pont!

This 24 page booklet describes iti detail the four broad
categories of jobs mentioned by "Pick" Pickering. Typical
pioneering problems in each of these four categories are
outlined. This booklet briefs a voting mechanical engineer
on how some of i he newest and most challenging problems

Jciines B. Walker received his U.S. in mechanical engineering from
North Carolina Slate College in June 1954, and he's presently working
for his M.S. at, the same college. By asking pertinent questions, Jim is
making sure that the position he finally accepts will be the right one for
a fellow with his training.
