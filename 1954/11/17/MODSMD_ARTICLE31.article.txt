# Cards Hold Light Drill
## 
### 
Review was the order of the day j
as Chuck Taylor put his battered
Rcdmen through another light work
out yesterday afternoon.
Every effort is being made to have
the whole squad in the best possible l
condition for the Big One Saturday.
The Indians are going through ses
sions that wouldn't tire a grammar
school eleven in order to prevent
further injuries.
Taylor admitted that he is still un
able to tell how much guards Donn
Carswell and Don Manoukian will
be able to play. Center Jerry Gold
berg's knee will definitely hold him
back some.
The always - amiable Taylor was
unwilling to venture a starting line
up, indicating, rather, that he would
shift some personnel for the Berke
ley battle.
