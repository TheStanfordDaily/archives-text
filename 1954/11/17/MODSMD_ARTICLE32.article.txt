hold on first place in the nation's
three top football rating polls.
The Bruins, who only need to get
by USC this week to complete their
first undefeated season in history,
are atop the United Press and In
ternational News Service rankings,
but tryil Ohio State in the Associ
ated Press rating.
The Buckeyes, who face Michi
gan this Saturday and could clinch
a Rose Bowl bid with a victory, have
2.010 points in th(! AP poll to 2,0013

however, 92 to 87.
In the UP and INS polls, Ohio
State is second to UCLA, but again
it's close. In the UP poll the Bruins
have 333 points to 320. The INS
