# CREW
## Boathouse Completion Seen Soon 
### BOB DURAND 
A dream is coming true. A
dream that was first realized last
spring is now beginning to take
on a definite shape.
That shape is the new Stanford
crew shellhouse which has been un
der construction since August 15.
Located in Redwood City, the build
ing has been built almost entirely
by members of the crew. A sport
not financially supported by the Uni
versity.
Two weeks before the end of
school last spring, the varsity sweep
swingers made an important decision.
Instead of going east to compete in
the National Intercollegiate Rowing
Championships, they decided to use
their funds to improve their facilities
instead.
Crew Association president Dan
Ayrault then began to formulate the
idea of building a new boathouse at
a more suitable location not only to
possibly help in the betterment of the

conditions, but to make the sport
more attractive to prospective can- I
didates.
Ayrault, working with Mr. Fred- j
erick Glover, assistant to President j
Sterling, negotiated with and re- :
ceived the support of the Redwood
City Council to go ahead with plans
for a shellhouse at the city harbor.
10 YEAR LEASE
A 10-year lease on land across the
street from the Sequoia Yacht Club
was given the Association at a dol
lar a year.
During the summer, an extensive
letter campaign was carried on by
Rowd Davis, co-captain of the oars
men. By the time the actual work
was to be started on the house, an
added $1,000 had been added to the
$4,000 balance of the treasury.
Construction of the building weni
slow at first, but as more and more
crew members returned to school,
the work was speeded until at the
present, less than one-fourth of the
job remains to be done.
The estimated value of the com
pleted boathouse is $30,000. To date, j
only $4,700 has actually been spent ]
on materials. All the rest has been
donated by alumni and friends, while
the labor of course has been handled
by the Association members.
JOB FOREMAN
Acting as foreman for the job has
been Fritz Fjieldheim, an employee
of Guy F. Atkinson Co., who has
given both his time and services to
the cause.

Facilities of the new shellhouse |
will include a trophy room-lounge, j
locker room, showers, and storage j
facilities for 12 shells. The associa- j
tion now owns* eight post-war shells.
As to the course, it is "any bit as
good as any I've ever rowed on,"
said Davis, who is varsity coxswain.
The excellent wind and tide con
ditions at the new site will give the
sweepswingers a big advantage oVeV
the old Palo Alto location. They will
b6 able to practice at regular times
throughout the season and will not i
have to row at 5 a.m. as was the case
last year.

job remains to be done.
The estimated value of the com
pleted boathouse is $30,000. To date, j
only $4,700 has actually been spent ]
on materials. All the rest has been
donated by alumni and friends, while
the labor of course has been handled
by the Association members.
JOB FOREMAN
Acting as foreman for the job has
been Fritz Fjieldheim, an employee
of Guy F. Atkinson Co., who has
given both his time and services to
the cause.

Facilities of the new shellhouse |
will include a trophy room-lounge, j
locker room, showers, and storage j
facilities for 12 shells. The associa- j
tion now owns* eight post-war shells.
As to the course, it is "any bit as
good as any I've ever rowed on,"
said Davis, who is varsity coxswain.
The excellent wind and tide con
ditions at the new site will give the
sweepswingers a big advantage oVeV
the old Palo Alto location. They will
b6 able to practice at regular times
throughout the season and will not i
have to row at 5 a.m. as was the case
last year.
A dream is coming true. A
dream that was first realized last
spring is now beginning to take
on a definite shape.
That shape is the new Stanford
crew shellhouse which has been un
der construction since August 15.
Located in Redwood City, the build
ing has been built almost entirely
by members of the crew. A sport
not financially supported by the Uni
versity.
Two weeks before the end of
school last spring, the varsity sweep
swingers made an important decision.
Instead of going east to compete in
the National Intercollegiate Rowing
Championships, they decided to use
their funds to improve their facilities
instead.
Crew Association president Dan
Ayrault then began to formulate the
idea of building a new boathouse at
a more suitable location not only to
possibly help in the betterment of the

conditions, but to make the sport
more attractive to prospective can- I
didates.
Ayrault, working with Mr. Fred- j
erick Glover, assistant to President j
Sterling, negotiated with and re- :
ceived the support of the Redwood
City Council to go ahead with plans
for a shellhouse at the city harbor.
10 YEAR LEASE
A 10-year lease on land across the
street from the Sequoia Yacht Club
was given the Association at a dol
lar a year.
During the summer, an extensive
letter campaign was carried on by
Rowd Davis, co-captain of the oars
men. By the time the actual work
was to be started on the house, an
added $1,000 had been added to the
$4,000 balance of the treasury.
Construction of the building weni
slow at first, but as more and more
crew members returned to school,
the work was speeded until at the
present, less than one-fourth of the
job remains to be done.
The estimated value of the com
pleted boathouse is $30,000. To date, j
only $4,700 has actually been spent ]
on materials. All the rest has been
