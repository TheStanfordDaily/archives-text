CLEVELAND, Nov. 16 (UP) —
Ralph Kiner, one of baseball's all
time great home run sluggers, moved
to the Cleveland Indians from the

Chicago Cubs to
lay in a surprise
vaiver deal which
•eunited him with
his old friend and
eammate, Gener
il Manager Hank
jreenberg.
Kiner, the 32-
/ear - old right
landed swing
-king who has hit
more homers than

any other player now active in the
National League, was passed up by
the other, seven National League
teams which had an opportunity to
negotiate for him. The powerfully
built slugger, who hit 22 homers last
year to give him a lifetime total of
351, will play left field and be a
reserve first baseman for the In
dians.
