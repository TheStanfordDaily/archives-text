## Adler: Leisure Time Misused 
### RALPH CAHN 
"The word 'leisure' is the most
misunderstood word in America
today," said Dr. Mortimer Adler
last night to a packed house in
Memorial Auditorium.
The Tuesday Evening Series
speaker spoke on the topic, "Free
dom in a Democratic Society." He
said that if the day of the average
American is divided into eight hours
of sleep, eight hours of work, apd
eight hours of what most Americans
think the word "leisure" means —
play — "then there is absolutely no
point to a liberal education."
"The word leisure, as the Greeks
used it, was use of free time—for
purposes of learning," explained
Adler.
"The beginning of democracy was
in economic order, and it cannot ex
ist without the industrial revolution.
This revolution is recent: in 1850, 85 i
per cent of commodities were pro- j
duced by human hands, 15 per cent
by machines. In 1950 the figures
were reversed, and most of the
change took place between 1900 and
1950."
CHANGE CONTINUING
With the immense changes
wrought, and still continuing, Dr.
Adler felt, the working week will
be cut to 15 hours in the not too dis
tant future. "All men belong to the
leisure and ruling class in an in
dustrial democracy," he stated. "If
all men belong to the leisure and
ruling class, does it not follow that
the education which was once given
to the few must now be given to all?
If this is true, American education iS j
a total failure, not just a 'somewhat j
total failure,' for unless good ac- I
tivities occupy men's lives, bad ones ;
will rush in.
"Equal educational opportunities
consist in giving to each child the
opportunity to get as much of the
kind of education as others receive."
AIM OF SCHOOL
"The aim of school is not to cre
ate a 'learned man'—that is absurd
(the college*graduate is hardly what
one could call 'learned') —the aims
of school are: (1) to inculcate in
the child the skills of learning; (2)
to give the child an invitation to
learning. If the school does this," - '
Adler continued, "then it has done
its job." •
r> iS; not for child'ren,"
Adler concluded, "for in school
children can be prepared for learn
ing!"

of sleep, eight hours of work, apd
eight hours of what most Americans
think the word "leisure" means —
play — "then there is absolutely no
point to a liberal education."
"The word leisure, as the Greeks
used it, was use of free time—for
purposes of learning," explained
Adler.
"The beginning of democracy was
in economic order, and it cannot ex
ist without the industrial revolution.
This revolution is recent: in 1850, 85 i
per cent of commodities were pro- j
duced by human hands, 15 per cent
by machines. In 1950 the figures
were reversed, and most of the
change took place between 1900 and
1950."
CHANGE CONTINUING
With the immense changes
wrought, and still continuing, Dr.
Adler felt, the working week will
be cut to 15 hours in the not too dis
tant future. "All men belong to the
leisure and ruling class in an in
dustrial democracy," he stated. "If
all men belong to the leisure and
ruling class, does it not follow that
the education which was once given
to the few must now be given to all?
If this is true, American education iS j
a total failure, not just a 'somewhat j
total failure,' for unless good ac- I
tivities occupy men's lives, bad ones ;
will rush in.
"Equal educational opportunities
consist in giving to each child the
opportunity to get as much of the
kind of education as others receive."
AIM OF SCHOOL
"The aim of school is not to cre
ate a 'learned man'—that is absurd
(the college*graduate is hardly what
one could call 'learned') —the aims
of school are: (1) to inculcate in
the child the skills of learning; (2)
to give the child an invitation to
learning. If the school does this," - '
Adler continued, "then it has done
its job." •
r> iS; not for child'ren,"
Adler concluded, "for in school
children can be prepared for learn
ing!"
