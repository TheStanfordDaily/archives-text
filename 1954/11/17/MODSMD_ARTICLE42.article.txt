### NAN CERINI 
Memorial Church is traditionally
at the heart of the campus. The pur
pose of the Memorial Church pro
gram is to make this heart beat, to
"maintain and strengthen a living
reality of spirituality as the vital
heart of the Stanford community,"
according to David H. Romeis, as
sistant to the Chaplain.
The church is non-sectarian in
order to meet spiritual needs of the
entire Stanford community, both
collectively and individually. It is
thus unique in that it is meant for
all rather than only a specific part
of this community.
Dr. Charles F. Whiston is Acting
Chaplain this quarter, while Chap
lain Robert M. Minto is in Europe.
Dr. Whiston is professor of system
atic theology in the Church Divinity
School of Pacific, an Episcopal
seminary. He has written "Teach
Us to Pray."
His assistant, David H. Romeis, is
a graduate of the University of Chi
cago and the Chicago Lutheran
Theological Seminary. He is cur
rently doing graduate work in pub
lic speaking, radio, and television
here.
The Memorial Church program
contains more than the usual 11 a.m.
Sunday service of worship. Of
course, this service is a part of the

total program. The service has ser
mons by Acting Chaplain Whiston,
by Alexander Miller, lecturer in re
ligion here, and by visitors of vari
ous denominations from all over the
world. Bryan Green, canon of Bir
mingham, England, was one of the
moSt popular of last year's visitors.

He will return to deliver a sermon
on Feb. 20, 1955.
The Sunday morning service also
contains devotional music by the
Memorial Church Choir under the
direction of Professor Harold C.
Schmidt, with Professor Herbert B
Nanney at the organ.
A communion service is usually
offered jon the first. Sunday of the
month before the regular 11 a.m.
service. It is held at 9.
Wednesday is another important
day in the church program. A can
dlelight service of organ meditation.
Scripture reading, and prayer is
held at 9:30 p.m. Immediately pre
ceding it at 9 is a study group on
the devotional life, led by Acting
Chaplain Whiston.
Sunday school is held at the Edu
cation Building during the 11 a.m.
Sunday service. Dr. Virginia Woods
is director. Students participate in
the Sunday school program as
teachers of the various classes.
The church also offers other op
portunities for student participation
in the framework of church workâ€”
for example, as members of the Me
morial Church Committee under the
chairmanship of Will Oxtoby, as
ushers at the 11 a.m. Sunday serv
ice, as readers in the service, and as
participants in the candlelight serv
ice.
