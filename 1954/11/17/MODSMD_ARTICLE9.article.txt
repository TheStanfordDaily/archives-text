# Extravaganza Praised by Reviewer: 'Gaieties Was a Delight to Watch...'
## 
### JAE HUNLEY 
Brand-new, spirited, lively—all these describe last night's open
ing production of the 1954 Big Game Gaieties.
From the snappy opener, "Tickets Please,"* to the rousing finale,
"This Is the Year," Gaieties was a delight to watch.
Among the show's highlights was the operatic parody, "Gigo-

letto." The players hammed it to+
the hilt, and the audience loved it.
Besides the four principals, Charles
Meltzer, Bere Boynton, Roberta
Grant, and Stan Throneberry, turned
in excellent singing performances.
Also noteworthy were the antics
of Musical Director William Scott,
who brought personality, besides
good music, from the orchestra pit.
Included among the better num
bers was "Scotch on the Rocks." This
happy bit had everything—a beau
tiful panoramic background, an au
thentic bagpiper, and a happy Scot,
Hugh Roberts, with a chorus of lads
and lassies.
Another good number was Sylvia
Haining's "Second Chance." Sup
ported by the members of the danc
ing ensemble, Miss Haining gave a
performance of truly professional
caliber.
Other acts that were above the

usual run-of-the-mill college pro
ductions were: "Slink," with Bill
Davis' skillful puppet handling;
"Free Again" with vivacious Nancy
Wiser; and Alice Middlekauff's sweet
rendition of "I See You Every
where."
Music and lyrics for the show
were new, fresh, and bright. Com
posers John Boswell, Jon Elkus,
Ruth Binns and lyricist Judy Schae
fer contributed much to make the
1954 Gaieties a good production.
Skits, however, suffered by com
parison with the musical numbers.
Nevertheless, several good individ
ual performances were given.
Notable among these were Jim
Weilenmen, the heartbroken electri
cian, in "A Star Is Gone"; A 1 Reid's
dead-pan stagehand in the same
number, and his sneezing courtesan
in "Gigoletto."

An effective use of the juliets, the
balconies on either side of the stage,
was made during "Rear End" and
"A Star Is Gone." This provided
an eye-catching variation. Another
clever device was Judy Schaefer's
abrupt entrance and disappearance
in "A Star Is Gone."
Costumes, sets, lighting —all were
good, especially the and
"Scotch" scenes. Special effects
throughout the whole show, were
well-done, particularly the Gaieties
sign in the first-act opener.
Sound, however, could have been
much better. "Trinidad," a number
with great potential, particularly
was hampered by a lack of ade
quate sound facilities. Another act
that did not come up to the stand
ard of the rest of the show was
"Sing, You Happy Fool, You."
Several other acts were also dam
aged because the audience could not
distinguish the lyrics.
On the whole, the performance
was well-done. The theme of "Beat
Cal" was carried out in surprisingly
different ways — signs painted on
bars and the "frozen gremlin" bit in
"From Here to Snow White."
