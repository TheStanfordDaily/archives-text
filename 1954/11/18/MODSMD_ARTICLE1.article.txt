# ICC, IFC Plan Open Houses
## 
### BOB DURAND 
An eating club rushing schedule, which gives the clubs three
open houses during the first week of winter quarter, was approved
by the Interclub Council earlier this week.

The schedule allows for oper
on Jan. 4, 7, and 8. It was dra'
representatives of the ICC and the
Interfraternity Council to co-ordi
nate the two rushing programs.
The schedule as it stands now
will open Tuesday night, Jan. 4, with
the clubs' open house. Wednesday
and Thursday will be fraternity
open houses, while Friday night will
see both the eating clubs and fra
ternities open their doors to rushees.
The fraternities will again hold
open houses on Saturday afternoon
and that night the final open houses
will be held both by the Row houses
and the clubs.
The second wpek of rushing, from
Jan. 9 through 15, will consist of
closed affairs concluding with ac
tivities Saturday night.
Also brought up and clarified at
the ICC meeting was the University
policy on rushing freshmen other
than those who entered Stanford for
the first time fall quarter.
It was emphasized that absolutely
no one who had not completed 45
units or three quarters of University
residence was eligible to take part
In rushing during the fall quarter.
This cleared up the question of the
present position of second- or third
quarter freshmen.
A new policy will be in effect this
year for both eating club and frater
nity men during the rushing period.
The times for visiting the freshman
dormitories have been limited to
four hours a day. â€¢
In the two weeks of rushing dur
ing winter quarter, fraternity and
club men may see rushees in their
rooms only between the hours of
11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. and between
5:30 and 7:30 p.m. Last year, visiting
hours were from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.
When the formal rushing period is
over, the hours of 7 to 11 will again
go into effect.
