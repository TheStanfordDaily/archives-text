Jim Smith, president of Cardinals.
"Workers are needed from morning
through 7:30,". emphasized Smith.
"We're way behind schedule now,
and unless we get more workers the
bonfire will not be as good as it
should."
Today's festivities will conclude
with an open house and dance at
Toy on right after the bonfire. Burt
Whiting's band will play from
to 12:30 in the Toyon lobby. There
will be no admission charge for the
dance.
