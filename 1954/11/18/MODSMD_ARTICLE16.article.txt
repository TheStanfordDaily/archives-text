UNITED NATIONS, New York,
Nov. 17 (UP) —Soviet Russia held
out for the veto power today as its
price—or part of its price—for tak
ing part in President Eisenhower's
"atoms for peace" plan.
Andrei Y. Vishinsky, Russia's
chief delegate, insisted in the United
Nations Political Committee that the
Soviet government wants to co-op
erate in the plan to utilize nuclear
energy for peaceful purposes.
But Vishinsky also insisted the
international atomic energy agency
which is to take charge of carrying
out the plan must be linked closely
with the U.N. Security Council.
The principle was agreed upon
that the five great powers — the
United States, Great Britain, France,
China, and Russia — must agree
unanimously on any major Security
Council decision.
This "unanimity" rule has become
the veto power, and Russia has used
it 60 times to block action in the
Security Council.
