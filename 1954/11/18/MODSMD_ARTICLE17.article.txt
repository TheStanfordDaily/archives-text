# Sonic Wall Broken; Blast Shakes Area
## 
### 
The breaking of the sonic barrier
by jet planes is believed to have
caused a severe blast which shook
the mid-peninsula area between
Mountain View and San Mateo yes
terday morning shortly before 11
a.m.
Jet vapor trails were observed
over the Redwood City area im
mediately after the blast, which
shook windows, doors, and dishes,
but caused little damage.
Here at Stanford, Pete Allen, di
rector of information, said his first
thought was that the Big Game bon
fire had l>een blown up when he
heard the explosion. (It was not).
