# Student Council Acquits Two Men
## 
### 
The Council for Student Control
recently found two Stanford men
innocent of an Honor Code violation
charge involving a take-home as
signment in an Economics course.
The Council decided that there was
a basic misunderstanding between
the professor and the two students.
The professor had stated in his
assignment that the mathematical
solving of the problems was to be
done individually, but that the stu
dents could discuss them before
working them out.
The professor reported the two stu
dents when he found their papers
were identical in many mistakes,
and these mistakes were not in other
students' papers.
