WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (UP)â€”
The United States warned Russia
today that it will be forced to pro
vide fighter escorts for American
planes flying near the Iron Curtain
unless "unprovoked" Soviet attacks
are halted immediately.
Underscoring the explosive possi
bilities of such action, it said the
Soviet Union would have to take
"full responsibility for any conse
quences which ensue."
The note was applauded in the
Senate, scene of recent debates on
the dangers of "co-existence" with
Russia.
It demanded "appropriate disci
plinary" action against the two MIG
pilots and "all other possible steps
. . . to prevent the recurrence of
such incidents."
"In the absence of appropriate ac
tion by the government of the US
SR," it added, "the United States
government will be impelled to pro
vide the necessary defensive protec
tion for United States aircraft en
gaging in these legitimate and
peaceful missions and full responsi
bility for any consequences which
ensue will devolve upon the govern
ment of the USSR."
