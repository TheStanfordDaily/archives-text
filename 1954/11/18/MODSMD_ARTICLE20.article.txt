Much of the fuzzy thinking and outright con
tradictions on American foreign policy which
have come from Washington in recent months
are due to the simple fact that the United States
doesn't know where it's going.
This has been evident in the past when
phrases like "massive retaliation" and "peace
ful coexistence" have been tossed around and
nobody was able to supply a satisfactory defi
nition.
It has cropped up in tussles between the
White House and the Senate, or more specific
ally Senate Majority Leader William Knowland,
in open disagreements on the role of the United
States in the United Nations or foreign eco
nomic and military programs.
And it was demonstrated once again this
weeks, when Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles was asked in a press conference just
what the Eisenhower Administration is trying
to accomplish and where it is headed. He was
unable to answer.
His silence is frightening. For it seems to
substantiate what critics of American foreign
policy have long proclaimedâ€”that the United
States is a giant locomotive speeding through
history, gathering momentum as it swerves to
avoid pitfalls along a road whose destination
is unknown.
It is clear what the United States does not
want. It does not v/ant war. It does not want
communist expansion. It does not want to be
come involved in civil wars or border disputes.
It does not want the peoples in Russian-dom

inated countries to be enslaved forever.
But what is it after?
Peace? Does this mean "peaceful co-exist
ence" or peace on terms dictated by the United
States or the cold war peace which we have
now?
We will fight against communist aggression?
When? In Korea and not Indochina? When a
destroyer is sunk but not when a 829 is shot
down? After we have been attacked or before
hand in a 'preventive' war?
What of the world twenty and fifty and one
hundred years from now? Will we be satis
fied v/hen the Russian bear stops growling or
not until every nation in the world holds demo
cratic elections? Will we settle for an armed
truce and promote prosperity on 'our' half of
the globe or will we insist on the free exchange
of goods and ideas throughout the world?
One of the most powerful elements in the
communist philosophy to its adherents is its
clarity and consistency. The tactics may vary
and the words may change, but the goal re
mains: the establishing of a world-wide com
munist "people's democracy."
It would be well for the United States to
similarly define its purposes. If the goal is com
plex and difficult to understand, it is all the
more important that we as a nation clarify it
and use it as a common denominator in our
thinking.
Until we know where we are going and why,
we will never be able to chart a true course
out of the ideological fog bank which envelops
us today.
