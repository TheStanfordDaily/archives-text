# BULL SESSION
## 
### JACK BYRNE 
Hearken well, oppressed and perpetually harrassed
members of the impecunious male sex, for tradition
has once again come to our rescue.
I refer, as Bull Sessioners always refer at this time
of year, to the Ancient, Honorable, and yea, Vener
able tradition of SEGDOGD.
SEGDOGD is a phrase coined by some nameless Bull
Sessioner of the dark past. Freely translated, it
reads: She Either Goes Dutch or Gets Ditched. The
meaning of this phrase should be obvious to all save
the most dense Encina Freshman.

What it all boils down to is that
the little lady is expccted to kick
through with half of the Big Game
Niyht expenses. A nice round half,
that's all. (And considering the
high cost of loving the men pay
the rest of the year, that's not un
reasonable.)
And how do you approach your
date on the subject? Pick your
own time and place, but take care

that your conversation doesn't take this bent:
"Hyacinth?"

' Yes, Cuthbert?
"It's about SEGDOGD."
"I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking
about."
"Don't give me that stuff. You know damn well
you're supposed to pay half tonight. Cough up."
"After what this dress cost mc? I'll have you know
this is a Robert Hall original!"
"Well, if you hadn't insisted on champagne with
every course at dinner, I wouldn't have to ask you
now. But wc need gas to get home, and you can't buy
gas with hairpins."
"Gh, no. This is it. This is the end. Wc are through,
Cuthbert, do you understand, we're through!"
"Suits me."
(Slow curtain.)
You're not likely to get this scene, provided that the
Roble and Branncr sponsors have done their bit to
ward the education of Stanford girls and women. So
don't worry.
But bo sure to take your slide rule along Saturday
night. Awfully handy lor computing half of the ex
penses in a hurry.
And forget not: SEGDOGD.
