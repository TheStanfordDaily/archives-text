# Bonfire Sparks Memories
## First Pyre Was in 1898 
### DON JACKSON 
What's behind the big Game
bonfire? How did it begin? What
does it have that makes it bring
sparks to the eyes of an old
grad? How has it become so
deeply rooted as part of the
Farm tradition?
The bonfire story is as complex,
colorful, and exciting as the annual
burning of the pyre itself. Its em
bers waft out over half a century
of Big Game rivalry; its sparks re
flect a parade of triumphs, heart
breaks, frustration, and jubilation.
Energetic freshmen h;ive been
gutting landscape around Lake Lag's
dry autumn bed since the carefree
campus days of 1898 —when a group
of spirited Roble women came up
with the idea at a "hen party" in
their living room.
Sincc then bonfires have become
as natural a part of the fall quarter
environment as November rains, or
December cramming — and just
about as inevitable.
TIME BOMB LEVELS PYRE
The year 1928, when America was
riding on the crest of prosperity and
doomed to a terrible awakening,
looms as one of the high points of
bonfire history. The ever present
Cal men managed to elude guards
and set a time bomb that leveled the
stack to ashes the day before the
rally. Radio appeals for wood and
an aroused campus combined to re
build the giant structure in a day,
and the Big Game rally went off on
schedule.
One of the most memorable fig
ures to ever adorn a Big Game rally,
or any other rally—the incompar
able Doodles Weaver —saw many of
his brightest inspirations materialize
while gathered around a flaming
Oski.
In 1935 Doodles cemented the
popularity of the "Axe Yell" by
leading the student body in a colos
sal demonstration of support for the
famed "Vow Boys." The boys, who
as sophs had vowed never to lose to
Cal or USC, climaxed their glorious
career that Saturday with a 13-0
win over the bearers of Berkeley's
blue. At the '36 rally Doodles was
again on hand, this time verbally
lambasting the cross-bay rivals with
a "Nuts to Cal" chant.
BIG C' FENCE BURNED
Grandfathers of the class of '58
might recall the 1904 bonfire, which
was keyed when Stanford stalwarts
set the torch to the once-sacred "Big
C" fence in retribution for Oski's
snatching of the Axe in 1899.
Serpentine dances have been an

impulsive part of Big Game Week
in years past, dating from 1911 when
inspired rooters danced around In
ner Quad anticipating a red - hot
rugby tussle which the Cal men
eventually won, though it wasn't the
final game of the season. Again, 1947
featured a serpentine dance up the
Row, with Village residents hopping
on at the Post Office.
In 1925 Cal once more reached the
bonfire a day to soon. This time it
provoked a united academic and
community response; classes were
dismissed, Palo Alto merchants do
nated lumber and oil, and the fire
went up again inside of 24 hours.
Lagunita's boathouse got into the
act in 1939, supplying part of the
wood ftfr the flaming effigy, and even
the bandhouse porch supplied a
spark or two when it was contrib
uted to the 1952 blaze.
OSKI BURNED PERENNIALLY
Oski, who perennially sits in
confused proxy atop the glowing

I scene, has met his end in many
I forms. His effigy is the normal suf
ferer, but he has been known to ap
pear in a coffin, at his residence, or
even drawn and quartered.
Bonfire spirit kindled impressively
during the war even in the absence
of a Big Game. Students trekked
to Lake Lag to do their spirited best
on the eve of the Stanford-Merchant
Marine tussle.
Last year's bonfire saw two sig
nificant developments. One of the
most fantastic bomb attempts in
Cal's rowdy history was uncovered
shortly before the fire, featuring 300
feet of electric wire which would
have been attached to an incendiary
bomb in the woodpile, supposedly
potent enough to rattle volumes in
Hoover Library.
BIG PUSH'
The "Big Push" grew out of last
year's fire also, an innovation in
bonfite construction that delays the
actual building until 24 hours be
fore the rally. This year's bonfire
committee followed up on the idea,
created by the '53 construction
chairman, Paul Bissinger.
The Big Game tradition thus
burns on, with one of the spirited
granddaddics, the bonfire, kindling
a "Beat Cal" frame of mind and a
lusty spirit that simmers all year
long.


A CONCERTED EFFORT—Freshmen workers add their bit to
the growing structure of the Big Game Bonfire. The scientifical
ly-constructed pyre will blaze tonight as Oski is cremated to
heighten Big Game spirit. —Daily photo by Ken Green

One of the most memorable fig
ures to ever adorn a Big Game rally,
or any other rally—the incompar
able Doodles Weaver —saw many of
his brightest inspirations materialize
while gathered around a flaming
Oski.
In 1935 Doodles cemented the
popularity of the "Axe Yell" by
leading the student body in a colos
sal demonstration of support for the
famed "Vow Boys." The boys, who
as sophs had vowed never to lose to
Cal or USC, climaxed their glorious
career that Saturday with a 13-0
win over the bearers of Berkeley's
blue. At the '36 rally Doodles was
again on hand, this time verbally
lambasting the cross-bay rivals with
a "Nuts to Cal" chant.
BIG C' FENCE BURNED
Grandfathers of the class of '58
might recall the 1904 bonfire, which
was keyed when Stanford stalwarts
set the torch to the once-sacred "Big
C" fence in retribution for Oski's
snatching of the Axe in 1899.
Serpentine dances have been an

impulsive part of Big Game Week
in years past, dating from 1911 when
inspired rooters danced around In
ner Quad anticipating a red - hot
rugby tussle which the Cal men
eventually won, though it wasn't the
final game of the season. Again, 1947
featured a serpentine dance up the
Row, with Village residents hopping
on at the Post Office.
In 1925 Cal once more reached the
bonfire a day to soon. This time it
provoked a united academic and
community response; classes were
dismissed, Palo Alto merchants do
nated lumber and oil, and the fire
went up again inside of 24 hours.
Lagunita's boathouse got into the
act in 1939, supplying part of the
wood ftfr the flaming effigy, and even
the bandhouse porch supplied a
spark or two when it was contrib
uted to the 1952 blaze.
OSKI BURNED PERENNIALLY
Oski, who perennially sits in
confused proxy atop the glowing

I scene, has met his end in many
I forms. His effigy is the normal suf
ferer, but he has been known to ap
pear in a coffin, at his residence, or
even drawn and quartered.
Bonfire spirit kindled impressively
during the war even in the absence
of a Big Game. Students trekked
to Lake Lag to do their spirited best
on the eve of the Stanford-Merchant
Marine tussle.
Last year's bonfire saw two sig
nificant developments. One of the
most fantastic bomb attempts in
Cal's rowdy history was uncovered
shortly before the fire, featuring 300
feet of electric wire which would
have been attached to an incendiary
bomb in the woodpile, supposedly
potent enough to rattle volumes in
Hoover Library.
BIG PUSH'
The "Big Push" grew out of last
year's fire also, an innovation in
bonfite construction that delays the
actual building until 24 hours be
fore the rally. This year's bonfire
committee followed up on the idea,
created by the '53 construction
chairman, Paul Bissinger.
The Big Game tradition thus
burns on, with one of the spirited
granddaddics, the bonfire, kindling
a "Beat Cal" frame of mind and a
lusty spirit that simmers all year
long.


A CONCERTED EFFORT—Freshmen workers add their bit to
the growing structure of the Big Game Bonfire. The scientifical
ly-constructed pyre will blaze tonight as Oski is cremated to

What's behind the big Game
bonfire? How did it begin? What
does it have that makes it bring
sparks to the eyes of an old
grad? How has it become so
deeply rooted as part of the
Farm tradition?
The bonfire story is as complex,
colorful, and exciting as the annual
burning of the pyre itself. Its em
bers waft out over half a century
of Big Game rivalry; its sparks re
flect a parade of triumphs, heart
breaks, frustration, and jubilation.
Energetic freshmen h;ive been
gutting landscape around Lake Lag's
dry autumn bed since the carefree
campus days of 1898 —when a group
of spirited Roble women came up
with the idea at a "hen party" in
their living room.
Sincc then bonfires have become
as natural a part of the fall quarter
environment as November rains, or
December cramming — and just
about as inevitable.
TIME BOMB LEVELS PYRE
The year 1928, when America was
riding on the crest of prosperity and
doomed to a terrible awakening,
looms as one of the high points of
bonfire history. The ever present
Cal men managed to elude guards
and set a time bomb that leveled the
stack to ashes the day before the
rally. Radio appeals for wood and
an aroused campus combined to re
build the giant structure in a day,
and the Big Game rally went off on
schedule.

In 1925 Cal once more reached the
bonfire a day to soon. This time it
provoked a united academic and
community response; classes were

nated lumber and oil, and the fire
went up again inside of 24 hours.
Lagunita's boathouse got into the
act in 1939, supplying part of the

OSKI BURNED PERENNIALLY
Oski, who perennially sits in
confused proxy atop the glowing

I scene, has met his end in many
I forms. His effigy is the normal suf
ferer, but he has been known to ap
pear in a coffin, at his residence, or
even drawn and quartered.
Bonfire spirit kindled impressively
during the war even in the absence
of a Big Game. Students trekked
to Lake Lag to do their spirited best
on the eve of the Stanford-Merchant
Marine tussle.
Last year's bonfire saw two sig
nificant developments. One of the
most fantastic bomb attempts in
Cal's rowdy history was uncovered
shortly before the fire, featuring 300
feet of electric wire which would
have been attached to an incendiary
bomb in the woodpile, supposedly
potent enough to rattle volumes in
Hoover Library.
BIG PUSH'
The "Big Push" grew out of last
year's fire also, an innovation in
bonfite construction that delays the
actual building until 24 hours be
fore the rally. This year's bonfire
committee followed up on the idea,
created by the '53 construction
chairman, Paul Bissinger.
The Big Game tradition thus
burns on, with one of the spirited
granddaddics, the bonfire, kindling
a "Beat Cal" frame of mind and a
lusty spirit that simmers all year
long.

What's behind the big Game
bonfire? How did it begin? What
does it have that makes it bring
sparks to the eyes of an old
grad? How has it become so
deeply rooted as part of the
Farm tradition?
The bonfire story is as complex,
colorful, and exciting as the annual
burning of the pyre itself. Its em
bers waft out over half a century
of Big Game rivalry; its sparks re
flect a parade of triumphs, heart
breaks, frustration, and jubilation.
Energetic freshmen h;ive been
gutting landscape around Lake Lag's
dry autumn bed since the carefree
campus days of 1898 —when a group
of spirited Roble women came up
with the idea at a "hen party" in
their living room.
Sincc then bonfires have become
as natural a part of the fall quarter
environment as November rains, or
December cramming — and just
about as inevitable.
TIME BOMB LEVELS PYRE
The year 1928, when America was
riding on the crest of prosperity and
doomed to a terrible awakening,
looms as one of the high points of
bonfire history. The ever present
Cal men managed to elude guards
and set a time bomb that leveled the
stack to ashes the day before the
rally. Radio appeals for wood and
an aroused campus combined to re
build the giant structure in a day,
and the Big Game rally went off on
schedule.
One of the most memorable fig
ures to ever adorn a Big Game rally,
or any other rally—the incompar
able Doodles Weaver —saw many of
his brightest inspirations materialize
while gathered around a flaming
Oski.
In 1935 Doodles cemented the
popularity of the "Axe Yell" by
leading the student body in a colos
sal demonstration of support for the
famed "Vow Boys." The boys, who
as sophs had vowed never to lose to
Cal or USC, climaxed their glorious
career that Saturday with a 13-0
win over the bearers of Berkeley's
blue. At the '36 rally Doodles was
again on hand, this time verbally
lambasting the cross-bay rivals with
a "Nuts to Cal" chant.
BIG C' FENCE BURNED
Grandfathers of the class of '58
might recall the 1904 bonfire, which
was keyed when Stanford stalwarts
set the torch to the once-sacred "Big
C" fence in retribution for Oski's
snatching of the Axe in 1899.
Serpentine dances have been an

impulsive part of Big Game Week
in years past, dating from 1911 when
inspired rooters danced around In
ner Quad anticipating a red - hot
rugby tussle which the Cal men
eventually won, though it wasn't the
final game of the season. Again, 1947
featured a serpentine dance up the
Row, with Village residents hopping
on at the Post Office.
In 1925 Cal once more reached the
bonfire a day to soon. This time it
provoked a united academic and
community response; classes were
dismissed, Palo Alto merchants do
nated lumber and oil, and the fire
went up again inside of 24 hours.
