# Stanford Adopts Scholarship Plan
## 
### 
Stanford is joining in a nation
wide movement among 92 promi
nent colleges to award scholarships
on the basis of financial need.
The co-opcrative effort is aimed at
relieving "a situation which had be
come increasingly competitive in re
cent years as some colleges began
to bid against each other for tal
ented students, whether they needed
financial aid oi not."
This statement of purpose was
made by Frank H. Bowles, director
of the College Entrance Examina
tion Board.
Established by the Board at the
request of the colleges, the College
Scholarship Service will collect fam
ily financial information from par
ents of all students who apply to the
participating colleges for entering
scholarships.
At the parents' instruction, these
data will be transmitted to the col
leges concerned.
Mills College in Oakland and Stan
ford are the participants in the San
Francisco Bay Area. Harvard,
Princeton, and Yale are among the
Eastern members.
