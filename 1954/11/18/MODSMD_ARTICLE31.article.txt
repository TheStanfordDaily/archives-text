## 
###

portant individual statistical honors.

against San Jose State Saturday, now
has 669 yards net this season. Tarr
has lugged the pigskin 135 times,

carrj*

galloped for 283 yards against Ore
gon State last week and has gained
596 yards for a 9.3 average.
Stewart caught three passes
against the Spartans and now has 36

two in the nation, as wejl as in the
conference, this fall.

son will be out to set a new confer
ence and national percentage pass
ing record against the Indians Sat
urday. Larson has completed 111
