# Gustafson Is Out With Flu
## 
### RAYMOND WADDINGTON 
Stanford's big red grid machine
went through its third day of non
contact work in a spirited practice j
session yesterday afternoon.
Quarterback Jerry Gustafson, i
who has picked up a bit of flu,
missed the workout. However, Gus- ;
tafson is expected back out at prac
tice today. He should be able to
shake off the illness with a day's
rest.
Chuck Taylor was obviously
pleased with the improvement of his
duo of doubtful players. Guards
Donn Carswell and Don Manoukian
will be at full strength Saturday.
Both will suffer only from the ef
fects of an enforced layoff. Carswell
has only been out this past week
with a broken nose. Manoukian lias
been out three weeks with a con
cussion.
It looks as if junior Don Geddos
has earned the number two center
position behind Jerry Goldberg and
his trick knee. Geddes, who will see
a good deal of action since Goldberg
cannot play full time, has come up
very fast in the last half of the sea
son.
