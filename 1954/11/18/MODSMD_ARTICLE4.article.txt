# Otis Winters Explains IFC, ICC Joint Action
## 
### 
(Editor's note: This is a state
ment from Otis Winters, president
of the Interfraternit.v Council, re
garding a story in yesterday's
Daily.)
"The Interfraternity Council
owes an apology to the Interclub
Council — and also the rushing
committees of both groups—for a
possibly misleading article in yes
terday's Daily. From the headline,
it was easy to get the impression
that the IFC had dictated the
rushing policy for winter quarter.
Quite to the contrary, the policy
as presented was a result of sev
eral joint meetings between the
rushing committees of the ICC and
the IFC. These meetings marked
the first time that the two groups
have met together and worked out
a common program that involved
sacrifices on both sides.
"The reporter covering the IFC
meeting for The Daily did not
know of the co-ordination that had
gone on; and while it was men
tioned during the meeting, it was
a complete oversight on my part
that he did not clearly understand
the situation. As he was reporting
on only the IFC meeting, it was
natural that he should present just
what the IFC decided.
"I hope the fine spirit of co-op
eration which has been evident
between the clubs and the frater
nities as we decided the difficult
problems of rushing will spread
to other fields and thus strengthen
the position of both in the Stan
ford community."
