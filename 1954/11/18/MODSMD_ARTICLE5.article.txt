## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
The Interfraternity Council voted
down a plan to "de-emphasize" and
restrict rushing contact on three days
during the foiTnal rushing period in
winter quarter of its meeting Tuesday
night.
Formal rushing is scheduled to
start Saturday, Jan. 8, at 9 p.m. after
the fifth in a series of open houses,
and continue through Friday night,
Jan. 14. During that time fraterni
ties will ruling parties
and may r coihta<!ft freshman freely.
The proposal w6uld have limited
the contact on Monday and Tues
day, Jan. 10 and 11, to the hours
around lunch and dinner. On, We
dnesday, Jan. 12, daytime contact
would have been limited to the lunch
hour until unlimited contact would
go into effect again after dinner.
The proponents of the plan urged
that it would relieve the pressure of
rushing for two days and allow fra
ternity men and freshmen more time
to study. But the majority of the
Council felt it would severely dis
| rupt the rushing momentum the
I houses try to sustain.
OPEN HOUSES
| The open house schedule approved
I by the IFC provides for open houses
.( on Jan. 5, 6. and 7 from 7:30 to
j 9:45 p.m.; and two open houses Jan.
I 8 from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. and 7:30 to
9 p.m. The Council passed its sched
ule after co-ordinating its rushing
plans with those of the Interclub
Council.
Before discussing rushing, the IFC
heard short reports from Fred Aurel
and Fred Stern, head sponsors at
Encina and the Village respectively.
At Stern's request, the IFC de
clared the Village library, which is
connected to the five freshmen units,
out of bounds for fraternity men.
1 This was done to reduce the chances
I of violations of the no-contact rule.
THANKSGIVING RIDES
The Council also clarified the rules
concerning rides at Thanksgiving va
cation by establishing the same regu-
I lations which prevail at Christmas.
That policy makes it a violation for
freshmen to ride with fraternity men
on trips of less than (>OO miles unless
j the men are blood brothers.
Aurel told the IFC of the new
hours which the halls of Encina and
the Village frosh units wovdd be op
en to fraternity men during rushing.
Those hours are 11:30 a.m. to 1:30
p.m. and from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. On
I the day of pledge card signing—
Jan. 15—the freshmen halls will be
closed all day.
The regulations established by the
sponsors are designed to prevent the
tremendous pressure and commotion
which disturbed the dorms last year.

day, Jan. 10 and 11, to the hours
around lunch and dinner. On, We
dnesday, Jan. 12, daytime contact
would have been limited to the lunch
hour until unlimited contact would
go into effect again after dinner.
The proponents of the plan urged
that it would relieve the pressure of
rushing for two days and allow fra
ternity men and freshmen more time
to study. But the majority of the
Council felt it would severely dis
| rupt the rushing momentum the
I houses try to sustain.
OPEN HOUSES
| The open house schedule approved
I by the IFC provides for open houses
.( on Jan. 5, 6. and 7 from 7:30 to
j 9:45 p.m.; and two open houses Jan.
I 8 from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. and 7:30 to
9 p.m. The Council passed its sched
ule after co-ordinating its rushing
plans with those of the Interclub
Council.
Before discussing rushing, the IFC
heard short reports from Fred Aurel
and Fred Stern, head sponsors at
Encina and the Village respectively.
At Stern's request, the IFC de
clared the Village library, which is
connected to the five freshmen units,
out of bounds for fraternity men.
1 This was done to reduce the chances
I of violations of the no-contact rule.
THANKSGIVING RIDES
The Council also clarified the rules
concerning rides at Thanksgiving va
cation by establishing the same regu-
I lations which prevail at Christmas.
That policy makes it a violation for
freshmen to ride with fraternity men
on trips of less than (>OO miles unless
j the men are blood brothers.
Aurel told the IFC of the new
hours which the halls of Encina and
the Village frosh units wovdd be op
en to fraternity men during rushing.
Those hours are 11:30 a.m. to 1:30
p.m. and from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. On
I the day of pledge card signing—
Jan. 15—the freshmen halls will be
closed all day.
The regulations established by the
sponsors are designed to prevent the
tremendous pressure and commotion
which disturbed the dorms last year.
The Interfraternity Council voted
down a plan to "de-emphasize" and
restrict rushing contact on three days
during the foiTnal rushing period in
winter quarter of its meeting Tuesday
night.
Formal rushing is scheduled to
start Saturday, Jan. 8, at 9 p.m. after
the fifth in a series of open houses,
and continue through Friday night,
Jan. 14. During that time fraterni
ties will ruling parties
and may r coihta<!ft freshman freely.
