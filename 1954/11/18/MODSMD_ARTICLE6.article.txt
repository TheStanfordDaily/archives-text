# Car Needs New Home
## 
### 
Are you a foreign student? Do you
need an automobile? And if you
had an automobile, could you afford
gas, oil, maintenance and insurance?
If you fit these qualifications then
you may sign up with the Host Di
rector at the lIR by tomorrow at 3
p.m. fur a car which will be given
j away at Cosmopolitan Club at 5
p.m.
The 1937 Ford has been donated
by two Japanese students, Shunji
Manabe and Nakaji Kopima, who
have recently completed two years
of work at Ohio State University.
In a letter to the Stanford Daily
the students said "We know that we
. could not have fully appreciated Am
erican life without a car, and we
j sincerely wish to share the same joy
with another foreign student."
The car needs some repair work,
the students warned. They speci
fied that the student be in good aca
demic standing and that he be some
one who could not otherwise afford
to buy a car.
