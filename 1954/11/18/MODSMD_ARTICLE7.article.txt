nounced yesterday.
Lt. Gen. Wyman, commander of
the Sixth Army, informed the Menlo
Park City Council that the army has
dropped consideration of sites in
Stanford Village because "market
value is excessive for Army re
serve construction purposes."
The Army's original plan called
for construction of the training cen
ter on government-owned property
on Ravenswood Avenue near Mid
dlefield Road, in Stanford Village.
Later, as opposition mushroomed in
Menlo Park, the Army suggested a
second Stanford Village site, on Mid
dlefield Road near the U.S. Geo
logical Survey building.
Menlo Park opposed both sites on
i grounds that Stanford Village was
earmarked for development as an ad
ministrative and office building cen
ter.
Five other sites in various parts
of Menlo Park were recommended
and the Sixth Army was invited to
inspect them.
General Wyman said the Army still
needs a "conveniently located, well
equipped training center in the
Menlo Park-Palo Alto area to im
plement the reserve program."
