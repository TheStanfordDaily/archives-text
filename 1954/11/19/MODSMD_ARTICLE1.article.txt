# AXE-HUNGRY CARDS FACE LARSON, CAL
## 81,590 Expected at Berkeley for 57th 'Big Game' 
### DON WEBSTER Sports Editor, The Daily 
ft isn't for a Hose Bowl bic). It isn't for the conference champ
ionship. It isn't for a high national rating. But it's still the Big
Game.
Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, two teams with 4-and-5 records
will meet in Berkeley Memorial Stadium in their last game of the
1954 season. Though the teams aren't the best, the game will still
draw 81,590 fans. If the stadium seated 20,000 more, it would still
! be packed.
Stanford will be going into the 57th Big Game a seven to 13-
point underdog. But one of the traditions of the classic is that upset
games are almost as common as non-upset games.
Though the season records are identical, Cal has good reason
to be favored. Three of the games the Bears lost were to the top
trio of clubs in the nation—UCLA, Ohio State, and Oklahoma. One
of the other two defeats was to USC on a disputed touchdown play.
Stanford this season has been like the girl with the curl—when
they were good they were very very good, but when they were
bad—brother!
They defeated Oregon (pre-season consensus choice for the
Rose Bowl), Illinois (pre-season consensus choice for the Rose
Bowl), and looked good in losing to USC (post-season choice for
the Rose Bowl).
On the other side of the picture, three of their losses were bad

ones. The UCI.A scoring machine ran over them, backed up,
and ran over them again. Final score: a record 72-0. Against Wash
ington State, the Indians looked like good competition (or the Biz
School mural team, as they bowed by a >10-26 count. And even
their jinx on San Jose State couldn't stop a weak Spartan team
from winning its first game in history over the Cards, 19-14.
If the Indians play against California like they did against San
Jose, the contest will be a slaughter. If they play like they did
against Oregon and USC, it should bo an interesting afternoon.
The host Bears are led by Paul Larson, a good bet to be consen
sus Ail-American quarterback this season. He specializes in the
"roll-out option" taking the ball from center, fading to his right,
and waiting for the defense to commit itself. If they rush, he throws
a pass. If they follow the ends downfield, he runs. As a result

of this play, he is second in the nation in total offense and leads
the country in passing.
Other top players include end Jim Hanifan, the nation's leading
pass receiver, and centei Matt Hazeltine, another All American
candidate.
The Cards have been hobbled by injuries this season, partic
ularly at the guard post. Yesterday this situation was worsened
when it was announced that Donn Carswcll will not play because
of his nose injury. loel Sappenfield, a converted tackle, will start
in Carswell's place.
The Stanford offense, although sporadic, has been well-rounded.
The Indians have operated with two quarterbacks John Brodie
and Jerry Gustafson. The latter specialized in a running game off
both the T end split-T formations. The leading ball carrier and the
team's "work horse" is fullback Bill Tarr.
Quarterback Brodie is the better passer of the two. His favorite
target is big end John Stewart—currently second in the nation be
hind Hanifan in receiving.
The top Card lineman is center Jerry Goldberg, the team's
unsung hero. Like Phil Wilson of last season, he has done an
outstanding job without getting too much credit for it. He has been
injured the past few weeks, and may see only limited action.
Some fans have been saying "wait until next year." But the
team doesn't want to wait until next year. For them, particularly
the seniors, the time is now.
