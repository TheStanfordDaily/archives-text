## 
### 
Anne Powell, chairman of Elec
tion Board, termed the new ASSU
election voting method quite suc
cessful as she reported to the Exec
utive Committee Wednesday.
"The new voting system went over
very, very well," she said, Thf* new
system was easier for the voter to
understand and easier for election
workers to count, she pointed out.
Commenting on the turnout for
the elections—2,3oo for the primary
and 2,100 for the final—Miss Powell
said that "this year there were too
lew candidates, and too many of
fices were decided in the primary."
The evening polling place, estab
lished at the request of Education
Council for the benefit of graduate
students, drew only 38 voters in the
final elections, and 31 of these ad
mitted that they could have voted
during the day, Miss Powell re
ported.
