### LARRY JENSEN 
California's Memorial Stadium,
the scene of tomorrow's big battle,
was dedicated in the Big Game of
192!!. Called "The House That Andy
Built" because of the great demand
to see Andy Smith's Wonder Teams,
the stadium is situated at the foot
of Strawberry Canyon in the Berke
ley hills.

Construction of the stadium was
begun in December, 1922, and was
not completed until the eve of the
1923 Big Game. Construction costs
totaled $1.3 million.
The bowl-shaped stadium had an
initial capacity of 76,000 but has
since been enlarged to hold 82,000.
The entire stadium is surrounded by
a two-story coliseum fagade which
was designed to conform to the rest
bf the campus architecture.
The stadium has a good drainage
system. The turf is underlaid with
a base of broken rock, screenings,
and sand which provides solid foot
ing in wet weather. In case of rain,
the playing field is covered by a
giant tarpaulin which weighs 900
pounds and overlaps both the side
! lines and goal lines by five feet.

| the spectator. Unlike most college
stadiums, there is no running track
' around the playing field.
On the California side of the field
is located the Andy Smith bench,

time as the stadium. On it is in
scribed: "We do not want men who
will lie down bravely to die, but
men who will fight valiantly to live
. . . winning is not everything. And
it is far better to play the game
squarely and lose than to win at the
sacrifice of an ideal." 0
As an added effect California took
great pains to beautify a steep hill
which rises behind the stadium.
Freeloaders, however, found it a
perfect admission-free spot to watch
the games and trampled the terraces
and shrubs on the hill.
