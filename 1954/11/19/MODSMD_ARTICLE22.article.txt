## Waldorf's Never Lost a Big Game 
### DON MARTIN Sports Editor, The Daily Californian 
Pappy Waldorf doesn't have Rose Bowl teams any more, but
there's one thing he continues to do ... he doesn't lose to the Stan
ford Indians.
The "Wise Walrus of Strawberry Canyon" has been at the
helm of the Bears for eight seasons, and during that period has

nailed Stanford six times and tied
the Indians twice.
On paper, the favored Bears
should rack the Cards again, but
with the presence of the amazing
Big Game spirit, one never knows
what will ocur when the ancient
rivals get together . . . witness the
7-7 tie in '50 and the 21-21 dead
lock last season.
The Golden Bears have lost five
games this year, but only one was
convincing . . . the 27-6 defeat at
the hands of the rampaging UCLA
Bruins.
The other four setbacks ... to
Oklahoma, Ohio State, Oregon, and
USC . . . were all narrow defeats,
and the USC game was clearly a
case where the Bears outplayed the
somehow - always - come - through
Trojans.
Led by the rifle-arm of quarter
back Paul Larson, the Bears have
been called "the greatest team with
five losses in the country." That
could be true.
Larson will be gunning for the
all-time passing percentage record
currently held by Washington's Don
Heinrich at 60 per cent completion
rate. The Bear senior has 65 per
cent going into tomorrow's battle.
Jim Hanifan, Jim Carmichael, and
Sam Williams have been Larson's
favorite targets this year, with sen
ior Hanifan currently standing first
in the nation for pass receiving . . .
just ahead of John Stewart.
The Bear running game has come
along slowly, and should reach its
peak tomorrow ... it might well be
the most versatile Cal offensive
show of the season.
Fullback Jerry Drew has become
the top round-gainer. Drew, along
with Steve Dimeff and Hal Norris,
three-year lettermen at guard, sup
plies the power. The speed element
is handled nicely by Drew again,
Ted Granger, and John Wilson.
On defense, you can never tell
about the Bears. Their pass de
fense wae woefully week * against
George Shaw and his Oregon mates,
but the defenders came to life
against Washington and OSC and
currently rest second in the aerial
defense.
The injury bug hasn't been too
mean to the Bears, with only star

guard Don Gilkey missing most of
the games. Hal Norris, George Na
jarian, Tom Kramer, Herb Jackson,
Ted Granger, Mike Casey, and John
Wilson missed a few games, but all
should be ready for the Injuns to
morrow.
The Bear line, at a 215-lb. aver
ae, is one of the biggest on the Coast,
but lacks speed and experience. Star
center Matt Hazeltine is the bul
wark of the forward wall, and could
play the greatest game of his life
tomorrow.

currently rest second in the aerial
defense.
The injury bug hasn't been too
mean to the Bears, with only star

guard Don Gilkey missing most of
the games. Hal Norris, George Na
jarian, Tom Kramer, Herb Jackson,
Ted Granger, Mike Casey, and John
Wilson missed a few games, but all
should be ready for the Injuns to
morrow.
The Bear line, at a 215-lb. aver
ae, is one of the biggest on the Coast,
but lacks speed and experience. Star
center Matt Hazeltine is the bul
wark of the forward wall, and could
play the greatest game of his life
tomorrow.
Pappy Waldorf doesn't have Rose Bowl teams any more, but
there's one thing he continues to do ... he doesn't lose to the Stan
ford Indians.
The "Wise Walrus of Strawberry Canyon" has been at the
helm of the Bears for eight seasons, and during that period has

nailed Stanford six times and tied
the Indians twice.
On paper, the favored Bears
should rack the Cards again, but
with the presence of the amazing
Big Game spirit, one never knows
what will ocur when the ancient
rivals get together . . . witness the
7-7 tie in '50 and the 21-21 dead
lock last season.
The Golden Bears have lost five
games this year, but only one was
convincing . . . the 27-6 defeat at
the hands of the rampaging UCLA
Bruins.
The other four setbacks ... to
Oklahoma, Ohio State, Oregon, and
USC . . . were all narrow defeats,
and the USC game was clearly a
case where the Bears outplayed the
somehow - always - come - through
Trojans.
Led by the rifle-arm of quarter
back Paul Larson, the Bears have
been called "the greatest team with
five losses in the country." That
could be true.
Larson will be gunning for the
all-time passing percentage record
currently held by Washington's Don
Heinrich at 60 per cent completion
rate. The Bear senior has 65 per
cent going into tomorrow's battle.
Jim Hanifan, Jim Carmichael, and
Sam Williams have been Larson's
favorite targets this year, with sen
ior Hanifan currently standing first
in the nation for pass receiving . . .
just ahead of John Stewart.
The Bear running game has come
along slowly, and should reach its
peak tomorrow ... it might well be
the most versatile Cal offensive
show of the season.
Fullback Jerry Drew has become
the top round-gainer. Drew, along
with Steve Dimeff and Hal Norris,
three-year lettermen at guard, sup
plies the power. The speed element
is handled nicely by Drew again,
Ted Granger, and John Wilson.
On defense, you can never tell
about the Bears. Their pass de
fense wae woefully week * against
George Shaw and his Oregon mates,
but the defenders came to life
against Washington and OSC and
currently rest second in the aerial
defense.
