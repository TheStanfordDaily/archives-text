## 
### BOB DURAND 
A California football player
by the name of Paul Larson has
influenced the experts this sea
son, it seems. The general opin
ion among those in the know is
that the Bears will upend the In
dians this Saturday mainly be
cause of Larson.
However, not many are completely
counting out the Indians, because of
the established tradition that "any
thing can happen" in the Big Game.
The consensus of the experts is

that California will win by seven
points. Here's what they say about
it:
JIM SCOTT, Sports Editor, Ber
keley Gazette: "Larson will pass
the Indians dizzy. California, 27-13."
JACK McDONALD, Sports Edi
tor, San Francisco Call - Bulletin:
"The should control Larson
more than expected. If the game
runs true to form, Stanford should
win; however, Big Games never run
true to form. California, 20-13."
ART ROSENBAUM, Sportswriter.
San Francisco Chronicle: "Sugges
tion to Stanford—throw your passes
where they ain't. California, 21-20."

CURLY GRIEVE. Sports Editor.
San Francisco Examiner: "The
Bears and Larson should wallop the
Indians, however anything can hap
pen in a Big Game. California, 21-
14.
WALT GAMAGE, Sports Editor,
Palo Alto Times: "Stanford by cool
calculation has no right to win, but
I somehow feel that this might be
the year that the Axe gets back to
its rightful place on the Farm. Stan
.oid, 21-17.
DINK TEMPLETON, radio and
newspaper columnist: "All Stanford
has to do is stop Larson. If he isn't
stopped—California 33, Stanford 19."
AL MASTERS, Director of Ath
letics, Stanford: "I think Larson
will make the difference. If we can
top him, we'll have a chance."
BRUTUS HAMILTON, Director of
Athletics, University of California:
'I'm not going to predict a score.
The game should be very close, es
pecially since Stanford lost to San
Jose State last week."
DON LIEBENDORFER, Athletic
Publicity Director, Stanford; "In
terms of personnel, California should
be heavily favored over Stanford,
but never count out a Stanford team.
California, 21-13."
