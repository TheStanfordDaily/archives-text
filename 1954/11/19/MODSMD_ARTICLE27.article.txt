# REMEMBER SMITH
## 
### 
The 1902 game is known as the
"Remember Smith" game. It is so
called because California's star
player, Warren "Locomotive" Smith
was declared out of the game by a
technicality. His substitute, Bobby
Sherman, returned a punt 105 yards
to score for California. It still stands
as the longest Big Game run. The
Bears won 16 to 0.
