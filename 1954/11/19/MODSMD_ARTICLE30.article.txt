# Big Game Team Records
## 
### 
Way back in 1892 the first Bis* Game statistics were ground out on a
vacant lot in Berkeley.
Since that time statistics of many Card-Bear duels have grown into
records which can only barely outline Ihe tremendous effort and emotion
that once lived to create them.
The team records are as follows:
