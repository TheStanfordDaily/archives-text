# Daily to Battle in Pub Bowl
## 
### 
With the cry of "bring back the
pica rule," the undefeated Stanford
Daily football team will face the
Daily Californian squad tomorrow
morning at 9 for the Publications
Bowl championship.
The Daily team, still nursing their

sores from last week's tussle, will
enplane for Berkeley tonight. The
game will be played on a vacant lot
near the Women's Gym. The visit
in Card seven will be supplying
the referee, which makes them a
solid favorite.
