# On Campus with Max Shulman
## DECEMBER AND MAY: ACT I 
### Author of "Barefoot Boy With Cheek," etc 
Of all the creatures that inhabit the earth, none is so fair, so warm,
so toothsome, as a coed.
This is a simple fact, well-known to every campus male, and, to
most campus males, a source of rejoicing. But not to all. To some,
the creamy brows and twinkling limbs of coeds are a bane and a
burden. To whom? To professors, that's whom.
Professors, according to latest scientific advice, are human. Stick
them and they bleed, pinch them and they hurt, ring a dinner bell
and they salivate, comfrontr them with a round young coed and
their ears go back, even as yours and mine.
But, by and large, they contain themselves. After all, they are
men of high principle and decorum, and besides, the board of regents
has got stoolies all over. So, by and large, they contain themselves.
But not always. Every now and then a coed will come along who
is just too gorgeous to resist, and a professor — his clutch worn out
from years of struggle — will slip and fall. White though his hair,
multitudinous though his degrees, Phi Beta Kappa though his key,
he is as lovesick, moonstruck, and impaled as any freshman.
But he's far worse off than any freshman. After all, £ freshman
can thump his leg, put on his linen duster, and take out after the
coed with mad abandon. But what can the poor smitten prof do?
llow, in his position, can he go courting a young girl undergraduate?
In this column and the next one, I am going to deal with this
difficult question. I will relate to you, in the form of a two act play,
an account of a professor's attempt to woo a coed.
The scene is a typical office in a typical liberal arts building on
a typical campus. In this shabby setting, we find two men, Professors
Twonkey and Phipps. They are lumpy and bent, in the manner of
English lit professors.
Phipps: Twonkey, a terrible thing has happened to me. A terrible,
ghastly thing! I've fallen in love with a coed.
Twonkey: Now, now, that's not so terrible.
Phipps: Oh, but it is. Miss McFetridge — for that is her name —is
a student, a girl of nineteen. How would her parents feel if they
knew I was gawking at her and refusing my food and writing her
name on frosty windowpanes with my fingernail?
Twonkey: Come now, Phipps, no need to carry on so. You're not
the first teacher to cast warm eyes at a coed, you know.
Phipps: You mean it's happened to you too?
Twonkey: But of course. Many times.
Phipps: What did you do about it?
Twonkey : Looked at their knees. It never fails, Phipps. No matter
how pretty a girl is, her knees are bound to be knobby and bony and
the least romantic of objects.
Phipps: Not Miss McFetridge's —for that is her name. They are
soft and round and dimpled. Also pink.
Twonkey: Really? Well, I'll tell you something, Phipps. If I
ever found a girl with pink knees, I'd marry her.
Phipps: It is my fondest wish, but how can I, a professor of fifty,
start a courtship with a girl of 19?
Twonkey: Very simple. Ask her to come to your office for a
conference late tomorrow afternoon. When she arrives, be urbane, be
charming. Ask her to sit down. Give her a cigarette.
Piiipps: A Philip Morris.
Twonkey: But of course.
Phipps: I just wanted to be sure you mentioned the name. They're
paying for this column.
Twonkey: Give her a Philip Morris.
Phipps: That's right.
Twonkey: Then light her Philip Morris and light one yourself.
Say some frightfully witty things about English lit. Ho gay. Be
insouciant. Keep her laughing for an hour or so. Then look at your
watch. Cry out in surprise that you had no idea it was this late.
Insist on driving her home.
Phipps: Yes, yes?
Twonkey: On the way home, drive past that movie house that
shows French films. Stop your car, as though on a sudden impulse.
Tell her that you've heard the movie was delightfully Gallic and
naughty. Ask her if she'd like to see it
Piiipps: Yes, yes?
Twonkey: After the movie, say to her in a jocular, offhand way
that after such a fine French movie, the only logical thing would be
a fine French dinner. Take her to a funny little place you know,
with candles and checked tablecloths. Ply her with burgundy and
Philip Morris. Be witty. Be gay. Be Gallic . . . How can a nineteen
year old girl resist such blandishments?
Piiipps: Twonkey, you're a genius! This will be like shooting fish
in a barrel... But I wonder if it isn't taking unfair advantage of
the poor little innocent.
Twonkey: Nonsense, Phipps. All's fair in love and war.
Phipps: You're right, by George. I'll do it!
