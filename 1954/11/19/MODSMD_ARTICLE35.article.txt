JOHN STEWART LER JIM CARMICHAEL
6-3, IK!) lbs. Junior 6-2, 200 lbs. Junior
Palo Alto Inglcwoori
Stewart, who is a great all-around athlete, has really come into his own
this year as a pass catcher. So far this season he has 36 receptions for
577 yards, a figu»e topped only by Cal's Hanifan. Stewart has especially
pood hands and good movements to get into the open, but does not have too
much breakaway speed. Although hampered by the flu bug the last half
ol the season, he has continued to improve his defensive and offensive play,
und is considered to b? an adequate b'ocker. A great high jumper in track.
Carmichael, younger brother of USC's Al, one of the PCC's top backs
a few seasons ago, has improved tremendously this season to where he
i:- the conference's third best receiver with 28 receptions for 366 yards. He
is extremely fast and probably rates over Hanifan as an all-around player,
although the latter is probably a better receiver. Carmichael was a regular
most of last year as a sophomore, but caught only 14 passes. Is very tough
defensively and makes his share of the tackles. EDGE TO STANFORD.
WIN WEDGE LTIt MARRY GIIILARDUCCI
5-10. 205 lbs. Senior 6-4, 240 lbs. Sophomnrc
Modesto Roseville
Wedge, the Indian's .sea on captain, has had a lot of trouble holding his
job this year because of the hustling play of junior Marshall. A
steady, though unspectacular lineman, he plays a well-balanced game and
is one of the hardest working players on the squad in practice. Extremely
tough to move or fool on defense, he has improved considerably on offense
and is very adept at one-on-one blocking.
Ghilarducci, the heaviest man on either team, has improved tremend
ously this fall, is now one of the Bear's bright stars for the future. Has
the size and speed to i ecome a really gi*eat lineman, and showed some
of his potential two weeks ago when he spent most of the afternoon in the
Washington backfield and completely bottled up the Huskies quarterback,
Bob Cox. Was on regular on the Cal frosh last season and lacks only
experience in big-time competition. Could give the Indian backs a lot of
trouble tomorrow. EDGE TO STANFORD.
JOE SAPPENFIELD LGR NICK POPPIN
6-1, 204 lbs. Junior 6-0, 202 lbs. Sophomore
Portland, Ore. San Francisco
Sappenfield, a converted tackle, will be playing only his second game
at guard, having started against San Jose State last week. He is replacing
sophomore Donn Carswell, who will be out of tomorrow's game with a nose
injury. The position has really been a hoodoo for Taylor this season as
Matt Armitage, the season's starter suffered a broken leg, and then Roy
Krickeberg suffered a severe knee injury. Both are out for the year.
Poppin, a sophomore, earned a starting role for the Bears for the first
time last Saturday. He is replacing Don Gilkey, who is out for the season
with a broken bone in his foot. Poppin hasn't played much this year, al
though he was a first-stringer on the Gold and Blue freshman team last
season, and so suffers from lack of experience. Faster and quicker than
most of the other Bear linemen, he is improving all the time. EDGE TO
CALIFORNIA.
JERRY GOLDBERG C MATT lIAZELTINE
5-11. 105 lbs. Senior 6-2, 201 lbs. Senior
Hollywood Kcntficld
One of the top individual battles in tomorrow's game. A regular for the
past three seasons. Goldberg has been one of the real unsung heroes of
this year's Stanford team. Has played consistently outstanding ball all
season for the Indians. Was a brilliant player in Stanford's 12 to 2 victory
over Illinois earlier this year and was named Associated Press Lineman
of the Week. A great offensive blocker and top defensive man, he has
been plagued by a knee injury the past two games and has seen little
action. It's still a question mark if he will be able to start tomorrow. If
not, then Don Geddes will probably get the call.
Hazeltine was named Ail-American center on three teams in 1953 and
was picked on most of the pre-season All-Americans this fall, but got off
to a slow start. He seems to have regained his form in the UCLA game,
however, and will give the Stanford backs plenty of trouble from the line
backer position. Playing his fourth season on the Bear varsity, Hazeltine
is as good offensively as he is defensively. He is considered to be the finest
California center since Waldorf has been coach. EDGE TO CALIFORNIA.
TONY MOSICII RGL CHARLES MARTUCCI
5-11, 202 lbs. Junior 5-11, 200 lbs. Senior
San Pedro San Francisco
Mosich has been Stanford's kickoff man most of the season and has ex
celled in this department. Has been a regular most of the season, until
forced out with a shoulder injury, but should be ready to go tomorrow.
Mosich saw very little action last season because of injuries and missed
spring practice for the same reason. He is an aggressive, hustling player
on both offense and defense, and is an especially good tackier.
Martucci was ineligible last season, but is a two-year letterman for
California. When the two-platoon was still used two seasons ago, he
played defense, but has improved enough to be an able all-around per
former. Martucci is an especially quick mover and has provided much
needed experience to the left side of the Bears line. This will be a rugged
battle between these two individuals. EDGE TO CALIFORNIA.
JOHN LUDEKE RTL 808 OLIVER
(i-2, 210 lbs. Senior 0-2, 230 lbs. Junior
Ludeke came up from the depths of the reserves this fall to earn a
starting position over Paul Wiggin in the past three Stanford games. Al
though a senior, he has seen very little action the past two seasons, play
ing in only six games. A real hustler, Ludeke is one of the fastest tackles
on the Indian eleven on the basis of straightaway speed. A good onc-on
one blocker, he is very good rusher on passes and has improved in his all
around defensive play. Ludeke has thus far lacked only aggressiveness and
experience.
Oliver, second heaviest man in the California starting lineup, is con
sidered to be one of the finest tackle prospects to ever enter the Berkeley
school. Out with injuries for part of this season, he has shared the left
tackle job with Ken Schwocho, an ex-Stanfordite. Was a starter in last
year's Big Game although only a sophomore. Has good speed for a man
of his size and is especially quick at sizing up defensive situations. Missed
spring practice this year. EDGE TO CALIFORNIA.
808 GERGEN REL JIM HANIFAN
6-0. 183 lbs. Sophomore 6-3, 100 lbs. Senior
San Gabriel Covina
Gergen, the third sophomore in the Indian's starting lineup, started his
first game of the season against San Jose State last week and turned in
a good job on both offense and defense. He caught two passes and made
several important tackles. Gergen also played very* well in the USC con
test the previous week, although mostly on defense. An aggressive and
hustler worker, he is steady, alert, and quick-reacting on defense, and is a
good blocker on offense. Gergen is replacing the injured Steve Doctcr,
who is out for the year. He lacks only experience.
Hanifan, the nation's leading pass receiver with 39 catches good for 510
yards, is a leading candidate for All-American honors. The Bear's lead
ing receiver last season with 19 receptions, he has improved in his all
around play this year but doesn't rate as high as Carmichael as a defensive
player. Hanifan also is not a strong blocker. EDGE TO CALIFORNIA.

JERRY GUSTAFSON • 4JB PAUL LARSON
6-2, 105 lbs. Junior 5-11, 180 lbs. Senior
Astoria, Oregon Turlock
Gustafson will be the starter tomorrow mainly because Chuck Taylor
will try to maintain ball control. Gus is the Split-T quarterback for the
Indians and has shown to he a fine runner on the "keep-it" option. He
is a rather .inconsistent passer however, hitting on only of 18 of 50 at
tempts this season. Gus is best defensive man among the quarterbacks
and is a sure tackier. Will also do the punting when he's in there. If Gus
can't make the Big Red Machine go then soph John Brodie, a better passer,
but poorer runner will direct the team from the regular T.
Larson, the nation's number one passer most of the season is on his w
to setting a new PC.C and national percentage record for completions. With
a good day tomorrow, he may also retain his total offense crown. Only in
his second season as a T quarterback (he played defensive halfback as a
soph and junior) he is especially famous for his "roll-out" play which
features a run or pass option. One of the fastest, if not the fastest men on
the whole Bear squad, lie is a fine defensive player against passes and is
threat to runback kicks all the way. EDGE TO CALIFORNIA
JOHN NEFF LH SAMMY WILLIAMS
6-0, 180 lbs. Junior 6-1, 190 lbs. Senior
Fremont, Nebraska Los Angeles
Neff has been a starter only in the past two games for the Indians and
had seen little if any action previously. A fast man and excellent pass re
ceiver as well as a good defensive man, especially against passes. Showed
some running potential against San Jose State last week when he picked
up 25 yards on six carries. Hampered by injuries his freshman and sopho
more years, he shows a fine potential and lacks only experience.
Gordy Young, a sophomore who has been a regular most of the season,
will probably see considerable action at this position. Young is a heady
runner and fine pass catcher, but lacks defensive polish.
Williams, was slated to be the Bear's first string quarterback last season,
and then suffered a shoulder separation which sidelined him for the season.
Shifted to halfback this year "he has proved to be a dangerous runner and
fine pass receiver. An outstanding defensive man, he played defensive half
when the two-platoon system was still in vogue. EDGE TO CALIFORNIA.
ERNIE DORN RII HAL NORRIS
5-0, 178 lbs. Junior 5-10, 195 lbs. Senior
Minneapolis, Minn. San Diego
Dorn, a regular at this position the past two seasons, has been hampered
by injuries most of the year and still is the Carols number two rusher be
hind Tarr. Last season he was the Indian's second best ball carrier with
292 yards, has gained 218 yards this season. Probably the team's best block
ing back, he is also very good pn protecting the passer, and a good de
fensive back and a sure tackier. He is a hustler all the way and pound
for pound the best competitor on the Stanford team.
Norris, a first-string guard for the Blue and Gold the past two seasons,
he was moved to halfback this year to provide better backfield blocking.
Was out the early part of this season recovering from a knee injury he
suffered in spring practice. Seldom carries the ball as he lacks the speed
found in most backs, but has the potential to become a fine line-plunger.
Considered by Bear coaches to be one of the finest all-around athletes
on the squad, Norris was state high school champion in the shot put. EDGE
TO STANFORD.
BILL TARR I B JERRY DREW
5-11, 190 lbs. Junior 5? 10, 195 lbs. Junior
Bcllingham, Washington Los Angeles
Tarr is Stanford's bread and butter ball carrier. Leads the PCC in in
dividual rushing yardage with a net of 6G9 yards this season. A real work
horse, he has carried the ball 135 times thus far this fall. Considered by
Stanford coaches as one of the finest broken field runners in farm history,
he lacks only great breakaway speed. An excellent offensive blocker, he is
a fine linebacker and tackier, but is a little weak on pass defense.
Drew, will be starting his first game of the season tomorrow and its
mainly because of the sensational one-man show he put on in the Oregon
State game last week. Drew rambled lor 283 yards and three touchdowns
and is now the conference's number two ball carrier behind Tarr. Origin
ally a halfback, he is a powerful runner with good speed and elusiveness
in the open field. Is a threat to breakaway at any time. An improved
offensive blocker, his lack of defensive ability has kept him on the bench
a good deal this season. EDGE TO STANFORD.
CALIFORNIA RATES THE OVERALL EDGE 7-1
