# Cal-Farm Booters Clash At Berkeley Tomorrow
## 
### 
Tomorrow morning's California-Stanford soccer game, to be
played at 10 on the Golden Bears' Edwards Field, may be literally
classified a Big Game.
To the winner of the game goes the third and last gualifying spot
(or the playoffs for the Northern California Soccer Association.

i The winner of this game will play
the second-place team, probably
USF, for the right to play the first
place team, probably CCSF, for the
championship.
That's the setting for the game,
and Coach Fred Priddle's Indians
will try to make the most of it.
! However, the Card betters, in spite
of last week's impressive 5-2 drub
bing of Santa Clara, must be rated
as underdogs to Cal. The Bears have
a slight manpower superiority and
will be playing on their home
grounds.
Coach Priddle puts it this way, "If
the boys want to prolong their sea
son badly enough, I'm sure we will
win."
The Indians are in top physical
I shape for the big push. They held
i their last rugged scrimmage Wed
! nesdey and have tapered off to avoid
j injuries.
The Stanford backfield, which
played its best game of the season
last week, appears capable of con
j taining the Cal forward wall which
is sparked by the roaming left in
i side Dennis Trayson. Goalie Ken
Woods and left halfback Sam Reg-
I ister had good days last week.
