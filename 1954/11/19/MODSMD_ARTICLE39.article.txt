an Inlands by 30 key radio stations
which have contracted with the Pa
cific Coast Conference for permis
sion to broadcast the game.
The Tidewater Associated Oil Co.
will sponsor the game for the 29th
consecutive year. The company has
x year - to - year radio agreement
with the PCC for broadcasting priv
ileges for all football and basketball
games in the conference.
Special arrangements have been

Jack Shaw, Tidewater sportscaster
for the Bay Area, will assume com
mand once again in the radio booth.

( Jack has broadcast Big Games ei
i ther on radio or television for the
lat.t five years. He'has handled the
latter for the last three years, the
only years that the game has been
' televised.
Big Game today, however, will be
completely blacked out, because of
NCAA rules. The new rules do not
permit any team to appear on tele
vision more than once during the
same year. The Stanford - Illinois
and the California-Oklahoma games
were both aired nationally earlier in
the year.
