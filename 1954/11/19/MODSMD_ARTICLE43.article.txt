# Traditional Conflict Marks Axe History
## Trophy Originated in '96 To Supplement Axe Yell 
### DAVE SCOTT 
Though the Stanford Axe is a Big Game trophy now, through
most of its history it was an item that caused much conflict and
created much tradition.
The history of the Axe started way back in 1896 when Stanford
ites Willie Irwin and Will Bradley originated the now famous Axe

Yell for campus rullies. Then earned
the inevitable bright thought, "Why
not have an axe to go with the
yell?" So a lumberman's broad axe,
shaped like a tomahawk, was lo
cated and removed to the Farm. To
this 15-inch blade a long wooden
handle was attached. A big red
Stanford "S" was painted on the
blade.
The Axe made its first official ap
pearance on April 14, 1899. The oc
casion was a rally held for the base
ball team. At the time a three-game
baseball series was held in San
Francisco between Stanford and
California. At the time of the rally
the Bears had already won the first
game and needed but one more to

The Stanford students roared as J
j ihe Axe was sharpened on a grind- j
, stone. Great ceremony was made of
j using the Axe to cut off the head j
j of a dummy Cal bear.

day. Head yell leader Bill Erb '
waved the Axe in the air all through
ihe game, and s r pent half of his time
waving it dangerously close to the j
i faces of the Cal rooters. It was to
' no avail as the Indians dropped the
1 contest by a 9-7 score.

The three guardians of the Axe
were last to leave the ball park. As
soon as they stepped out onto Fol
som Street they were attacked by
four Cal men who demanded the
Axe. A fight ensued, which soon in
volved about 30 or 40 from each
school. A passing policeman offered
no help to quell the struggle over
the Axe. "They're jist college byes,"
he observed in his rich Irish brogue,
"let 'em l'oight."
Finally the Axe was handed to the
star member of the Cal track team,
who started to put distance between
himself and Stanford pursuers. Two
Stanfordites did attack him from a
side street, but with the help of a
few Cal cohorts he and the Axe
made a get - away in a delivery
wagon.
Upon reaching the ferry to Berke
ley, however, the Californians found
the place swarming with cops and
red-shorted Stanford men. A search
was being made of all those board
ing the ferry. Fortunately for Cal,
one of the culprits saw a girl friend

getting on the Oakland ferry.
Quickly he bought a ticket to Oak
land, stuck the Axe under his coat,
and boarded the boat with her. Upon
reaching Oakland, he headed
straight for Berkeley with his prize.
lIIDDEN AT CHI PSI
The next night a rally was held in
honor of the theft of Stanford's prize
possession. Care of the Axe was
then entrusted to the members of
the Chi Psi fraternity, home of the
baseball team captain. But at 2 a.m.
the members of th<e fraternity were
awakened by a pounding. They
looked out the window in time to
see 50 Stanford men breaking down
the front door. But the Axe was
well hidden in the house, and the
Stanfordites could not find it.
A few attempts were made by
Stanford men to steal it in the en
suing years, but they were not suc
cessful, and for 31 long years the
blade remained in the possession of
the Berkeleyites. During that time
Stanford had many athletic tri
umphs over Cal, but the Bear'root
ers could always retort with that
hated taunt, "We've got the Axe."
Then in 1930 the famous "Immor
tal 21" brought glory to themselves
and Stanford. For three years they
had laid their plan to steal the Axe.
On April 3, 1930, they were suc
cessful.
The raid was a violent one and
though the "21" became heroes,
there was fear of future violence.
To prevent this, a plan was con
sidered whereby the Axe would be
awarded to the winning school in
the Big Game each year.
At the time most Stanford stu
dents were opposed to the idea. The
"21" took a unanimous vote oppos
ing any such measure. The Stan
ford Daily wrote an editorial against
the plan. Many Stanfordites thought
that it was only just that if we put
up our Axe for the game winner,
Berkeley should put up their golden
bear—winner take all.
AXE BECOMES TROPHY
In 1933, after the Axe had disap
peared again, a pact was signed that
the Axe be a trophy awarded to the
winner of the Big Game, and so it
has been ever since. Suspension
from school for anyone caught try
ing to steal the Axe was part of
the agreement.
Nothing eventful happened until
1946 when four Berkeley students
stole the blade .from the Cellar.
Stanford students threatened to steal
the California cyclotron in retalia
tion. However, the Axe was dis
covered outside the Palo Alto po
lice station in a prowl car in time
for the game.
In an attempt to prevent another
theft. Stanford constructed a $700,
9QO-pound case, with unbreakable
glass. In 1948 the Axe disappeared
from the Berkeley campus and was
found abandoned under a tree on
the Stanford golf course.
STOLEN IN 1953
During spring finals week of 1953
it again disappeared from Berkeley,
the glass in the case being broken
and the Axe removed. A five-dollar
bill was left to pay for the broken
glass. The Axe reappeared just be
fore Big Game last year in team
captain Norm Manoogian's car.
As the game was a tie last year,
21-21, Cal retained legal possession
of the Axe. It is now resting on
their campus, but will be at stake
as usual in tomorrow's Big Game.

fore Big Game last year in team
captain Norm Manoogian's car.
As the game was a tie last year,
21-21, Cal retained legal possession
of the Axe. It is now resting on
their campus, but will be at stake
as usual in tomorrow's Big Game.


JUST A GLIMPSE —Cal rooters hold up the Stanford Axe in front
of the Indian rooting section, giving the crowd a glimpse of the
Big Game trophy which has been held in Berkeley for the past
eight years. The Axe has been the official Big Game trophy
since 1933.
Though the Stanford Axe is a Big Game trophy now, through
most of its history it was an item that caused much conflict and
created much tradition.
The history of the Axe started way back in 1896 when Stanford
ites Willie Irwin and Will Bradley originated the now famous Axe

Yell for campus rullies. Then earned
the inevitable bright thought, "Why
not have an axe to go with the
yell?" So a lumberman's broad axe,
shaped like a tomahawk, was lo
cated and removed to the Farm. To
this 15-inch blade a long wooden
handle was attached. A big red
Stanford "S" was painted on the
blade.
The Axe made its first official ap
pearance on April 14, 1899. The oc
casion was a rally held for the base
ball team. At the time a three-game
baseball series was held in San
Francisco between Stanford and
California. At the time of the rally
the Bears had already won the first
game and needed but one more to

The Stanford students roared as J

day. Head yell leader Bill Erb '
waved the Axe in the air all through
ihe game, and s r pent half of his time
waving it dangerously close to the j
i faces of the Cal rooters. It was to
' no avail as the Indians dropped the
1 contest by a 9-7 score.

The three guardians of the Axe
were last to leave the ball park. As
soon as they stepped out onto Fol
som Street they were attacked by
four Cal men who demanded the
Axe. A fight ensued, which soon in
volved about 30 or 40 from each
school. A passing policeman offered
no help to quell the struggle over
the Axe. "They're jist college byes,"
he observed in his rich Irish brogue,
"let 'em l'oight."
Finally the Axe was handed to the
star member of the Cal track team,
who started to put distance between
himself and Stanford pursuers. Two
Stanfordites did attack him from a
side street, but with the help of a
few Cal cohorts he and the Axe
made a get - away in a delivery
wagon.
Upon reaching the ferry to Berke
ley, however, the Californians found
the place swarming with cops and
red-shorted Stanford men. A search
was being made of all those board
ing the ferry. Fortunately for Cal,
one of the culprits saw a girl friend

getting on the Oakland ferry.
Quickly he bought a ticket to Oak
land, stuck the Axe under his coat,
and boarded the boat with her. Upon
reaching Oakland, he headed
straight for Berkeley with his prize.
lIIDDEN AT CHI PSI
The next night a rally was held in
honor of the theft of Stanford's prize
possession. Care of the Axe was
then entrusted to the members of
the Chi Psi fraternity, home of the
baseball team captain. But at 2 a.m.
the members of th<e fraternity were
awakened by a pounding. They
looked out the window in time to
see 50 Stanford men breaking down
the front door. But the Axe was
well hidden in the house, and the
Stanfordites could not find it.
A few attempts were made by
Stanford men to steal it in the en
suing years, but they were not suc
cessful, and for 31 long years the
blade remained in the possession of
the Berkeleyites. During that time
Stanford had many athletic tri
umphs over Cal, but the Bear'root
ers could always retort with that
hated taunt, "We've got the Axe."
Then in 1930 the famous "Immor
tal 21" brought glory to themselves
and Stanford. For three years they
had laid their plan to steal the Axe.
On April 3, 1930, they were suc
cessful.
The raid was a violent one and
though the "21" became heroes,
there was fear of future violence.
To prevent this, a plan was con
sidered whereby the Axe would be
awarded to the winning school in
the Big Game each year.
At the time most Stanford stu
dents were opposed to the idea. The
"21" took a unanimous vote oppos
ing any such measure. The Stan
ford Daily wrote an editorial against
the plan. Many Stanfordites thought
that it was only just that if we put
up our Axe for the game winner,
Berkeley should put up their golden
bear—winner take all.
AXE BECOMES TROPHY
In 1933, after the Axe had disap
peared again, a pact was signed that
the Axe be a trophy awarded to the
winner of the Big Game, and so it
has been ever since. Suspension
from school for anyone caught try
ing to steal the Axe was part of
the agreement.
Nothing eventful happened until
1946 when four Berkeley students
stole the blade .from the Cellar.
Stanford students threatened to steal
the California cyclotron in retalia
tion. However, the Axe was dis
covered outside the Palo Alto po
lice station in a prowl car in time
for the game.
In an attempt to prevent another
theft. Stanford constructed a $700,
9QO-pound case, with unbreakable
glass. In 1948 the Axe disappeared
from the Berkeley campus and was
found abandoned under a tree on
the Stanford golf course.
STOLEN IN 1953
During spring finals week of 1953
it again disappeared from Berkeley,
the glass in the case being broken
and the Axe removed. A five-dollar
bill was left to pay for the broken
glass. The Axe reappeared just be
fore Big Game last year in team
captain Norm Manoogian's car.

theft. Stanford constructed a $700,
9QO-pound case, with unbreakable
glass. In 1948 the Axe disappeared
from the Berkeley campus and was
found abandoned under a tree on
the Stanford golf course.
STOLEN IN 1953
During spring finals week of 1953
it again disappeared from Berkeley,
the glass in the case being broken
and the Axe removed. A five-dollar
bill was left to pay for the broken
glass. The Axe reappeared just be
fore Big Game last year in team
captain Norm Manoogian's car.
As the game was a tie last year,
21-21, Cal retained legal possession
of the Axe. It is now resting on
their campus, but will be at stake
as usual in tomorrow's Big Game.


JUST A GLIMPSE —Cal rooters hold up the Stanford Axe in front
of the Indian rooting section, giving the crowd a glimpse of the
Big Game trophy which has been held in Berkeley for the past
eight years. The Axe has been the official Big Game trophy
since 1933.
Though the Stanford Axe is a Big Game trophy now, through
most of its history it was an item that caused much conflict and
created much tradition.
The history of the Axe started way back in 1896 when Stanford
ites Willie Irwin and Will Bradley originated the now famous Axe

Yell for campus rullies. Then earned
the inevitable bright thought, "Why
not have an axe to go with the
yell?" So a lumberman's broad axe,
shaped like a tomahawk, was lo
cated and removed to the Farm. To
this 15-inch blade a long wooden
handle was attached. A big red
Stanford "S" was painted on the
blade.
The Axe made its first official ap
pearance on April 14, 1899. The oc
casion was a rally held for the base
ball team. At the time a three-game
baseball series was held in San
Francisco between Stanford and
California. At the time of the rally
the Bears had already won the first
game and needed but one more to

The Stanford students roared as J

day. Head yell leader Bill Erb '
waved the Axe in the air all through
ihe game, and s r pent half of his time
waving it dangerously close to the j
i faces of the Cal rooters. It was to
' no avail as the Indians dropped the
1 contest by a 9-7 score.

The three guardians of the Axe
were last to leave the ball park. As
soon as they stepped out onto Fol
som Street they were attacked by
four Cal men who demanded the
Axe. A fight ensued, which soon in
volved about 30 or 40 from each
school. A passing policeman offered
no help to quell the struggle over
the Axe. "They're jist college byes,"
he observed in his rich Irish brogue,
"let 'em l'oight."
Finally the Axe was handed to the
star member of the Cal track team,
who started to put distance between
himself and Stanford pursuers. Two
Stanfordites did attack him from a
side street, but with the help of a
few Cal cohorts he and the Axe
made a get - away in a delivery
wagon.
Upon reaching the ferry to Berke
ley, however, the Californians found
the place swarming with cops and
red-shorted Stanford men. A search
was being made of all those board
ing the ferry. Fortunately for Cal,
one of the culprits saw a girl friend

getting on the Oakland ferry.
Quickly he bought a ticket to Oak
land, stuck the Axe under his coat,
and boarded the boat with her. Upon
reaching Oakland, he headed
straight for Berkeley with his prize.
lIIDDEN AT CHI PSI
The next night a rally was held in
honor of the theft of Stanford's prize
possession. Care of the Axe was
then entrusted to the members of
the Chi Psi fraternity, home of the
baseball team captain. But at 2 a.m.
the members of th<e fraternity were
awakened by a pounding. They
looked out the window in time to
see 50 Stanford men breaking down
the front door. But the Axe was
well hidden in the house, and the
Stanfordites could not find it.
A few attempts were made by
Stanford men to steal it in the en
suing years, but they were not suc
cessful, and for 31 long years the
blade remained in the possession of
the Berkeleyites. During that time
Stanford had many athletic tri
umphs over Cal, but the Bear'root
ers could always retort with that
hated taunt, "We've got the Axe."
Then in 1930 the famous "Immor
tal 21" brought glory to themselves
and Stanford. For three years they
had laid their plan to steal the Axe.
On April 3, 1930, they were suc
cessful.
The raid was a violent one and
though the "21" became heroes,
there was fear of future violence.
To prevent this, a plan was con
sidered whereby the Axe would be
awarded to the winning school in
the Big Game each year.
At the time most Stanford stu
dents were opposed to the idea. The
"21" took a unanimous vote oppos
ing any such measure. The Stan
ford Daily wrote an editorial against
the plan. Many Stanfordites thought
that it was only just that if we put
up our Axe for the game winner,
Berkeley should put up their golden
bear—winner take all.
AXE BECOMES TROPHY
In 1933, after the Axe had disap
peared again, a pact was signed that
the Axe be a trophy awarded to the
winner of the Big Game, and so it
has been ever since. Suspension
from school for anyone caught try
ing to steal the Axe was part of
the agreement.
Nothing eventful happened until
1946 when four Berkeley students
stole the blade .from the Cellar.
Stanford students threatened to steal
the California cyclotron in retalia
tion. However, the Axe was dis
covered outside the Palo Alto po
lice station in a prowl car in time
for the game.
In an attempt to prevent another
theft. Stanford constructed a $700,
9QO-pound case, with unbreakable
