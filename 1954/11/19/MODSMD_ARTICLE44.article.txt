# 'Immortal 21' Return Axe To Stanford
## 
### DAVE SCOTT 
"Inscribe their name in sand
stone; let them have the whole
campus if they wish it. They've
won the gratitude of every Stan
ford alumnus from the White
House to San Quentin."
Thus the comments ran when aft
er 3J lone? years, the Stanford Axe
was returned to its rightful place by
one of the most famous teams ever
to fight for Stanford, the "Immortal
21."
The group banded together for
the sole purpose of recovering the
axe. Donald Kropp ('29) in secrecy
took three years to collect a select
i/roup of men dedicated to this one !
task.
Finally the c'ay came — April 3,
1930. The Berkeley campus had been
thoroughly scouted for almost a year,
the 21 had been thoroughly organ
ized, and the plan of attack had been
minutely rechecked for 3 years. Late
in ,the afternoon three car loads of
Stanford men quietly slipped out of
campus. All were loose and confi
dent; there was no thought of failure.
A special point was made of razzing
all the policemen they passed on the
way to Berkeley.
When they arrived at the Cal
campus each man took his assigned
place. Certain ones mingled with the
numbers of Cal, Frosh guarding the |
Axe on its journey from the bank
vault to the rally in the Greek The
ater. At the theater Howard Avery
almost gave the deception away
when he ignited an old broom handle
and merrily kept time with it while |
the Californians were religiously
singing their hymn.
AXE IN ARMORED CAR s
At 9:30 p.m. the Axe returned from
the Greek theater in an armored car.
Don Kropp and James Triming
ham had parked a fast Buick sedan,
engine running, next to the curb di
rectly in front of the entrance to the
bank. Set up on the rumble seat of
the car was a camouflaged device
which resembled a camera mounted
on a tripod. Raymond Walsh and
Warren Gage, standing next to the
camera, completed the illusion of
newspaper photographers aboard a
press car. Arthur Miller stood near
the outer door of the bank, with a
tear gas bomb, made in chem lab,
hidden under his coat. Four sup
posed Cal frosh, namely Howard
Avery, Eric Hill, Gerald Betteman.
and Robert Loofbourow gained foot
hold on the armored car.
Walsh and Gage shouted to the
UC custodian, Norman Horner, star
baseball pitcher, for a picture of
the Axe for the newspapers. The
frosh, eager to have their pictures
taken, drew back. Custodian Horner
delayed, then complied. Then the
"camera" went off. A full load of
flashlight powder in his face temp
orarily blinded him. Avery jumped
from the top of the armored car on
top of Horner, grabbed the Axe,
which was relayed to Loofbourow.
Some furiously aroused Cal men
revengefully forced Avery against
the bank wall, thinking he had the
Axe. In the meantime Loofbourow,
with the Axe hidden under his brown
sweater, walked calmly through the
milling crowd to the Buick sedan.
Joined by Walsh and Gage with
Trimingham at the wheel, he started
off at full speed headed for the Farm.
Simultaneously Miller hurled his
tear-gas bomb into the crowd, cov
ering the car get away and allowing
Avery to escape the clutches of the
irate Californians.
Others of the 21 delayed any
organized Cal pursuit by various de
coys and false alarms.
"WE'VE GOT THE AXE"
In 50 minutes the Axe bearers had
arrived at Stanford. With joyous
shouts they awoke the sleeping
Stanford students with the cry
"We've got the Axe!" The word
spread like wildfire. Led by head
yell leader Paul Speegle, the whole
student body paraded throughout
campus yelling and cheering the
"21."
The next morning San Francisco

newspapers heralded the event with
their biggest headlines. After stor
ing the Axe in a bank vault, the
enthusiastic students held a huge
rally for the "21" Friday night.
The shock to Cal of losing the
Axe was a little bit too great, as is
shown by this excerpt from the Fri
day morning editorial in the Daily
Californian: "We have always had
a notion as to the sort of people
that inhabit the God-forsaken cam
pus 40 miles south, and our notion is
now confirmed. Stanford, despairing
of honest burglary, imported Chi
cago racketeer methods.
"Hate Stanford! Catch the eu
phony of that sentence, notice its es
sential accuracy! Hate Stanford!
Repeat it over and over in your
mind; formulate it with your lips!
Hate Stanford!"
On the Farm the "21" were treated ]
as heroes had never been treated j
before. They were wined and dined i
by every organization. They re- j
ceived varsity letters. The Quad
dedicated a 32-page section to them
entitled "The Year."
It was a long time before the "21" I
were treated as much less than gods, j
and this quatrain did not die
quickly:
For there's joy in dear old Stanford,
And there's patting on the backs
Of the one-and-twenty huskies
That returned the Stanford axe.

Thus the comments ran when aft

was returned to its rightful place by
one of the most famous teams ever
to fight for Stanford, the "Immortal
21."

i/roup of men dedicated to this one !
task.
Finally the c'ay came — April 3,
1930. The Berkeley campus had been
thoroughly scouted for almost a year,
the 21 had been thoroughly organ
ized, and the plan of attack had been
minutely rechecked for 3 years. Late
in ,the afternoon three car loads of
Stanford men quietly slipped out of
campus. All were loose and confi
dent; there was no thought of failure.
A special point was made of razzing
all the policemen they passed on the
way to Berkeley.
When they arrived at the Cal
campus each man took his assigned
place. Certain ones mingled with the
numbers of Cal, Frosh guarding the |
Axe on its journey from the bank
vault to the rally in the Greek The
ater. At the theater Howard Avery
almost gave the deception away
when he ignited an old broom handle
and merrily kept time with it while |
the Californians were religiously
singing their hymn.
AXE IN ARMORED CAR s
At 9:30 p.m. the Axe returned from
the Greek theater in an armored car.
Don Kropp and James Triming
ham had parked a fast Buick sedan,
engine running, next to the curb di
rectly in front of the entrance to the
bank. Set up on the rumble seat of
the car was a camouflaged device
which resembled a camera mounted
on a tripod. Raymond Walsh and
Warren Gage, standing next to the
camera, completed the illusion of
newspaper photographers aboard a
press car. Arthur Miller stood near
the outer door of the bank, with a
tear gas bomb, made in chem lab,
hidden under his coat. Four sup
posed Cal frosh, namely Howard
Avery, Eric Hill, Gerald Betteman.
and Robert Loofbourow gained foot
hold on the armored car.
Walsh and Gage shouted to the
UC custodian, Norman Horner, star
baseball pitcher, for a picture of
the Axe for the newspapers. The
frosh, eager to have their pictures
taken, drew back. Custodian Horner
delayed, then complied. Then the
"camera" went off. A full load of
flashlight powder in his face temp
orarily blinded him. Avery jumped
from the top of the armored car on
top of Horner, grabbed the Axe,
which was relayed to Loofbourow.
Some furiously aroused Cal men
revengefully forced Avery against
the bank wall, thinking he had the
Axe. In the meantime Loofbourow,
with the Axe hidden under his brown
sweater, walked calmly through the
milling crowd to the Buick sedan.
Joined by Walsh and Gage with
Trimingham at the wheel, he started
off at full speed headed for the Farm.
Simultaneously Miller hurled his
tear-gas bomb into the crowd, cov
ering the car get away and allowing
Avery to escape the clutches of the
irate Californians.
Others of the 21 delayed any
organized Cal pursuit by various de
coys and false alarms.
"WE'VE GOT THE AXE"
In 50 minutes the Axe bearers had
arrived at Stanford. With joyous
shouts they awoke the sleeping
Stanford students with the cry
"We've got the Axe!" The word
spread like wildfire. Led by head
yell leader Paul Speegle, the whole
student body paraded throughout
campus yelling and cheering the
"21."
The next morning San Francisco

newspapers heralded the event with

frosh, eager to have their pictures
taken, drew back. Custodian Horner
delayed, then complied. Then the
"camera" went off. A full load of
flashlight powder in his face temp
orarily blinded him. Avery jumped
from the top of the armored car on
top of Horner, grabbed the Axe,
which was relayed to Loofbourow.
Some furiously aroused Cal men
revengefully forced Avery against
the bank wall, thinking he had the
Axe. In the meantime Loofbourow,
with the Axe hidden under his brown
sweater, walked calmly through the
milling crowd to the Buick sedan.
Joined by Walsh and Gage with
Trimingham at the wheel, he started
off at full speed headed for the Farm.
Simultaneously Miller hurled his
tear-gas bomb into the crowd, cov
ering the car get away and allowing
Avery to escape the clutches of the
irate Californians.
Others of the 21 delayed any
organized Cal pursuit by various de
coys and false alarms.
"WE'VE GOT THE AXE"
In 50 minutes the Axe bearers had
arrived at Stanford. With joyous
shouts they awoke the sleeping
Stanford students with the cry
"We've got the Axe!" The word
spread like wildfire. Led by head
yell leader Paul Speegle, the whole
student body paraded throughout
campus yelling and cheering the
"21."
The next morning San Francisco

newspapers heralded the event with
their biggest headlines. After stor
ing the Axe in a bank vault, the
enthusiastic students held a huge
rally for the "21" Friday night.
The shock to Cal of losing the
Axe was a little bit too great, as is
shown by this excerpt from the Fri
day morning editorial in the Daily
Californian: "We have always had
a notion as to the sort of people
that inhabit the God-forsaken cam
pus 40 miles south, and our notion is
now confirmed. Stanford, despairing
of honest burglary, imported Chi
cago racketeer methods.
"Hate Stanford! Catch the eu
phony of that sentence, notice its es
sential accuracy! Hate Stanford!
Repeat it over and over in your
mind; formulate it with your lips!
Hate Stanford!"
On the Farm the "21" were treated ]
as heroes had never been treated j
before. They were wined and dined i
by every organization. They re- j
ceived varsity letters. The Quad
dedicated a 32-page section to them
entitled "The Year."
It was a long time before the "21" I
were treated as much less than gods, j
and this quatrain did not die
quickly:
For there's joy in dear old Stanford,
And there's patting on the backs
Of the one-and-twenty huskies

campus if they wish it. They've
won the gratitude of every Stan
ford alumnus from the White
House to San Quentin."

was returned to its rightful place by
one of the most famous teams ever
to fight for Stanford, the "Immortal
21."

task.
Finally the c'ay came — April 3,
1930. The Berkeley campus had been
thoroughly scouted for almost a year,
the 21 had been thoroughly organ
ized, and the plan of attack had been
minutely rechecked for 3 years. Late
in ,the afternoon three car loads of
Stanford men quietly slipped out of
campus. All were loose and confi
dent; there was no thought of failure.
A special point was made of razzing
all the policemen they passed on the
way to Berkeley.
When they arrived at the Cal
campus each man took his assigned
place. Certain ones mingled with the
numbers of Cal, Frosh guarding the |
Axe on its journey from the bank
vault to the rally in the Greek The
ater. At the theater Howard Avery
almost gave the deception away
when he ignited an old broom handle
and merrily kept time with it while |
the Californians were religiously
singing their hymn.
AXE IN ARMORED CAR s
At 9:30 p.m. the Axe returned from
the Greek theater in an armored car.
Don Kropp and James Triming
ham had parked a fast Buick sedan,
engine running, next to the curb di
rectly in front of the entrance to the
bank. Set up on the rumble seat of
the car was a camouflaged device
which resembled a camera mounted
on a tripod. Raymond Walsh and
Warren Gage, standing next to the
camera, completed the illusion of
newspaper photographers aboard a
press car. Arthur Miller stood near
the outer door of the bank, with a
tear gas bomb, made in chem lab,
hidden under his coat. Four sup
posed Cal frosh, namely Howard
Avery, Eric Hill, Gerald Betteman.

hold on the armored car.
Walsh and Gage shouted to the
UC custodian, Norman Horner, star
baseball pitcher, for a picture of
the Axe for the newspapers. The
