BAND MANAGERS
Don Wells is senior band manager
this year. There is much paper work
connected with band activities, and
most of this is done by the junior
managers, Bill Hudson. Larry Kelly,
and Bob Burkhardt. The manager?
are chosen by the band director and
the senior manager. George Sheldon
is the student drum major.
There arc neither drum major
ettes nor baton twirlers in the Stan
ford Band, as is the custom in all
the major Pacific Coast Conference
bands. According to band officials,
the reason for this practice is that
any majorettes or twirlers would
possibly distract attention from the
performance of the hand itself.


SHARP, ISN'T IT?—The Stanford Band forms an axe on the
field. The precise stunt is the result of careful planning and num
erous rehearsals. The group has practised various formations
on a travel theme to brighten half-time at tomorrow's Big Game,

There arc neither drum major
ettes nor baton twirlers in the Stan

the reason for this practice is that
any majorettes or twirlers would
possibly distract attention from the
performance of the hand itself.
