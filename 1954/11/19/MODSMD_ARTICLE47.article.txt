# One-Night Stand to Major Show; Gaieties Grows With Stanford
## 
### JAE HUNLEY 
From one piano to a thirty
:iece orchestra. A one-night
land to a production running for
four days. Big Game Gaieties—
an idea that became a tradition.
For over MO years, Gaieties ha?
ollowed the growth of Stanford and
die Bit; Game.
In the "Po; ring Twenties" it was
billed as the footed show and fea
tured a fU-ppcr chorus line, bowler
hats, ,<oft-:shoe routines, and jazzy
num hers.
Swing and blues followed the de
pression into the 1930'5. Guy Lom
bardo and the first of the Hawaiian
melody-tj'pe music keynoted several
Gaieties performances with numbers
rvlled "Blue Moonlight" and "Cheer
in Swingtime."
Then came the war and with it,
the patriotic, military themes. These
set the style- for nearly all the Gai
eties productions between the years
of iS4I and 1945.
ALMOST ALL-GIRL' GAIETIES
An interesting note is that Gaie
ties became almost an "all - girl"
show, with a few soldiers scattered
here and there. The 1945 production
was called "A Girl in Every Port."
Gaieties has almost alw'ays fol
lowed the tempo of the times. More
recent shows have parodied the
"Bolshevikies," television, and Mick
ey Spillane.
Set construction and costumes
have become much more elaborate
through the years of production. In
the beginning, there was little em
phasis on the stage netting or cast
costumes.
Last year, however, featured
'ancers with skirts that lighted up
and a fountain with, a 10-foot col
umn of water.
ANIMALS APPEAR OFTEN
Animals have played quite an im
portant part in the shows. Every
thing from parrots, chihuahuas, and
horses has performed for the Gaie
ties audience.
Gaieties, as evidenced in the 1054
?how, has become a high - caliber
production as well as a part of the
Big Game festivities program.


MERRY-GO-ROUND —Dancers and members of the chorus spin
around in the curtain raising Merry-Go-Round skit of the 1952
Gaieties, centered around the theme "It's In the Cards"-—to
"Beat Cal." Gaieties have been traditional part of Big Game
Week for 30 years.
