The Big Came!
Though there are many traditional foolball rivalries in the na
tion, mention Big Game anywhere and people know immediately
you refer to the annual clash between California and Stanford.
Th'S feme is well deserved, for through the years these two

tennis have played some of football'.-;'
most exciting parries. The Big Game
has the reputation of being unpre
d:ctable as to outcomc, and the rec
ord 1 hows this is well de erved.
The lirst Pir* Game was an upset,
the stage for thines to romp.
CÂ»l had been playing football for
ei'.'ht years, and Stanford was in its
first season. Stanford was a thrce
to-one underdog, but the final
was Stanford 14, California 10.
In 1002, spirit lose to a new high
as Stanford declared she would not
plnv the name if Cal's star, Loco
motive Smith, played. It had been
discovered that Smith received
money for coaching a hieh school
team, so at the last moment the
Bears had to substitute Bobby
Sherman. All Sherman did was set
a West Coast record when he re
turned a Card punt 105 yards to a
touchdown. This and two field goals
by Orvai Overall, who went on to
become a leading pitcher for Frank
Chance's Miracle Cubs, spelled de
feat for Stanford.
UUCIBY RIVALS
Both schools abandoned football
in 1906, I ut continued the rivalry
on the rugby field. Stanford won
five, lost three and tied one against
Cal while playing the English game.
In 1915. the series was intcrupted
for the first time. The schools quar
relled over the freshman eligibity
rule and they did not play again un
til 1919 when a strongly favored Cal
team, after trailing 3-0, moved into
a 14-10 lead, and staved off a last
Indian threat.
The next years were those of Cal
ifornia's Wonder Teams. In 1920 Cal
hung up its biggest margin of vic
tory, 33-0. The fo'lowing season,
when Stanford opened her stadium,
the toll was 42-7., Two years later
California dedicated Memorial Stad
ium at the expense of the Indians
by 9-0.
The Cal winning streak finally
came to an end in what has been
called the greatest Big Game ever.
Walter Camp called it the greatest
game of all time.
SCORELESS FIRST QUARTER
The first quarter was scoreless, but
Murray Cuddleback put Stanford
ahead with a field goal early in the
second quarter. Later, from 43 yards j
out, he kicked another to give Stan
ford a 6-0 lead at the half. Cal
scored in the third to make it 7-6
going into the final period. Twoj
more Bear TD's made it 20-6 with j
only six minutes remaining, but the j
Indians were not to be denied.
Walker faded back and passed twice.
The second was a Herculean effort
o. r about 50 yards and was caught
by Ted Shipkey for a score.
With three minutes left Stanford
started again from their own 19. A
Cuddleback to Shipkey pass put the
ball on the Cal 38. Two line bucks
failed but Walker was equal to the
task with a scoring pass to Cuddle
back with only 50 seconds remain
ing. A hush settled over the stadium
as Walker held and Cuddleback tied
up the game at 20-20.
This game ushered in an era of
Stanford dominance. It was 1931 be
fore the Cards again tasted defeat.
Coach Pop Warner guided them to
winning margins of 41-0 and 41-6,
as Stanford piled up its highest point
totals.
THE VOW BOYS
Stanford's Vow Boys won three
games against California in 1933 to
1935. Bobby Grayson and Co. con
tinued the indignity heaped on Cal
ifornia in every year since 1923 ex
cept for 1931 when the Bears hung
up a 6-0 win.
By 1936 the tide turned, though,
and Cal won four straight over weak
Stanford teams. Frankie Albert and
Pete Kmetovic teamed to lead Stan
ford to an easy 13-7 win in the 1940
Big Game. The following year saw
the Cards take the field as three to
one favorites. It took Cal just two
minutes to disprove the odds. On
Cal's first play Al Derian cut back j
over tackle and ran 54 yards to put
the Golden Bears ahead. Bob Rein
hard and the two Herrcro brothers
completely stopped Albert, and Cal
ehalked up its greatest upset by a j
16-0 score.
' Stanford got olf to a good start
after the war as they whipped a list- |
less Cal team, 25-6. Bear rooters j
- pent, most of the game ripping up j
the seats and calling for a new j
roach. They got one, in the person t
of I'appy Waldorf.
CAL FAVORITE
He went into the 1947 contest with
Cal installed as a 10-1 favorite, hav
ing lost only one game to powerful
USC, while Stanford's closest touch j
with victory was a 16-19 loss to
Idaho. Cal took the kickofT and
marched straight down the field to
the 29, where Ted Kenfield sped to a
score. Jim Cullom converted and
Cal supporters settled back to watch
the score mount. But Stanford came
back with a 65-yard drive, ending
With Ainslee Beli passing to Wayne
Erickson for a score.
Stanford held the vaunted Cal at- I
tack until the last 10 seconds of the
half when George Fong drove 1

through an almost non-existant hole
at guard to give Cal a 14-6 lead.
INSPIRED INDIANS
The inspired Stanford team, usinc
a seven diamond defense with
George Quist, the lone linebacker,
doing a terrific job, completely bot
tled up the Bears and moved into an
18-14 lead with only five minutes
to play. Cal rooters, many of whom
had given 40 points on underdog
Stanford couldn't believe it. The
drove again and reached the
Cal 20 before relinquishing posses
sion with only three minutes to play.
At this point Waldorf sent injured
Paul Keckley into the game. On the
first play Jackie "Golden Boy" Jen
sen ran to the right on a pass-run
option. He spotted Kecklev en the
Bear 35, and threw. Keckley had to
run up to catch the low wobb'y pass,
turned, and then started for the Card
goal. Three Stanford men surround
ed him at the 50 but somehow he
got loose and made it to the end
zone. It was a bitter 21-18 defeat for
Stanford, but the loss was only on
the scoreboard.
CLOSE GAME
Stanford again came close the fol
lowing year, as they held the Rose
Bowl bound Bears to a 7-6 margin.
In the next season, 1949, with a trip
to Pasadena for the victor, Stanford
moved into a 14-12 lead. In the
third quarter they drove to the Cal
three before Harry Hugasian fumbled
to give the Bears the ball. Jim
Monachino set sail over tackle and
ended up 84 yards away on the Stan
ford four. That was the ball game,
for the Indians' spirit was broken,
and Cal went on to a 33- 14 victory.
In 1950, Stanford tied Cal 7-7,
had one score called back, and nar
rowly missed another when a Bill
McColl pass to Bob Bryan 60 yards
away was just inches too long. Gary
Kcrkorian and McColl managed to
break Cal's hold on the Rose Bowl
in 1951 but the Axe stayed at Berke
ley. Les Richter smashed the In
dian offensive hopes, while Johnny
Pappa and Don Robison ran wild in
a 20-7 win for the Bears.
California chalked up a methodical
26-0 win two years ago in a dull
game, as they tied up the series at
23 victories apiece. It marked the
climax of Bob Mathias' grid career,
but he was overshadowed by John
Olzewski who was also playing his
final Big Game.
DISAPPOINTMENT
Last year's contest was also a
disappointment to Cardinal sup
porters. Sensing the first Stanford
victory since 1946 and the first at
Palo Alto since 1935, fans filled
the Stadium to see what Bob Gar
rett could do against the Bears. UC
scored first, but a Garrett to Morley
pass tied it at halftime. Sfanford
moved out to a 21-7 lead as Jarvis
Watson powered over center for
three yards, fumbled into the end
zone, and Barry Smith fell on the
ball. Bob Garrett later intercepted
a Paul Larson pass and raced 56
yards for what looked like a com
manding lead.
But. Larson was equal to the task
as he scored from 18 yards out. He
later sent Al Talicy over the goal
with four minutes remaining. In the
final seconds of the game Larson
tried a field goal from the seven
but his kick was short and the game
ended in a tie.
