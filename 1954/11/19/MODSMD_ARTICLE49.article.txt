# Cards, Bears Have Long Win Streaks
## 
### 
Both Stanford and California have
had long streaks of undefeated
games. The Golden Bears' streak of
50 games without a loss, made in
11)20-1925 by the Wonder Teams, is
the third longest skein in the coun
try, while in 1913-191(5 Stanford ran
up 34 tilts playing rugby without a
loss.
The Cardinals started their win
ning ways during the period when
rugby was the big sport. They lost
two games in a row, 54-0 and 56-0
to the touring New Zealand All-
Blacks, but then the Indians really
rolled. It was not until the final
game of the 1916 season that they
came out on the short end of the
scoreboard. In that last game Santa
Clara ran up a 38-5 win.
'I lie only team that came close to
victory against Stanford during this
period was the Olympic Club, which
held the Cards to 0-0 in the first
game of the 1915 season. The In
dians gained revenge later that year,
though, by a 49-8 count.
California's streak is topped only
by Michigan with 55 and Washing
ton with 60. Washington's was
largely against high school teams,
however. The Bears lost the final
game of the 1919 season, but then
went until Oct. 10, 1925, without a
loss. Finally Washington won 7-0
and the skein was at an end.
Cal did have several ties during
the five-year period, the most no
table being 0-0 with Washington and
Jefferson in the 1922 P?ose Bowl and
the famous 20-20 tie with Stanford
in 1924.
