# Capacity Crowds for 24 Of Last 30 Big Games
## 
### LARRY JENSEN 
Of the 30 Big Games played since 1921, the year the present
Stanford Stadium was built, only eight have not been sellouts.
The depression years of 1932-35 saw the game played before un
filled seats, 1939-42 crowds were held down due to the
war threat and the mediocrity of one or both of the teams.
Sixty thousand persons filled the new Stanford Stadium in 1921

to watch the dedication ceremonies *
Andy Smith's Wonder Team de
feated Stanford that season, 42-7.
The 1022 game was played at Stan
ford again before 60,000 fans.
California completed its new Me- j
morial Stadium just in time for the
1923 Big Game. They dedicated ii
with a 9-0 victory over the Indians j
before a capacity crowd of 73,000.
Seventy - seven thousand persons j
packed Memorial Stadium in 1924.
The games oi 1925 and 1926 both
sold out, and in 1927 the biggest;
throng yet to witness the great ri
valry, saw Big Red score a
13-6 win in Stanford's newly en- !
largcd stadium. By the 1928 game,
Memorial Stadium had al.o been
enlarged (to hold 82,000 people), and j
every seat was filled as Stanford
and California battled to a 13-13 tic. i
The next three Big Games were j
played before capacity crowds, buf ,
only 69,000 fans showed in Berkeley 1
for the 1932 game that ended in a j
0-0 tie. Stanford won the next three j
Big Games while playing to under
sizc crowds of 77,000, 65,000, and
85,000.
The games of 1936. 1937, and 1938
were all sellouts and all California I
victories.
The 1939 game at Stanford at- j
tracted only 58,000 fans, the smallest
Big Game crowd since 1920. Both |
teams entered the contest with poor j
records, Stanford having gained only J
a tie with UCLA and Cal having
won only two games. The year 1940
saw Stanford win before 75,000.
Only 70.000 looked on as Cal upset
the Indians at Stanford in 1941, and !
a comparatively small gathering of

55,000 saw Stanford win 26-7 in 1942.
The seven games piayed since
1946 have all been before packed
houses.
