# Big Game Slaughter Not in Record Books
## 
### 
On November 30, 1918, Stanford lost a Big Game to California,
67-0. Luckily, however, this game is not counted in the official
records of either .school, and therein lies a story.
In 1915, a five-year agreement oetween the two schools expired,
and California insisted on the freshman ineligibility rule being

included in any new contract, for
games between Stanford and UC.
Stanford was dead set against the
inclusion of this rule, so for the next
two years the opponents did not
meet. %
California and Stanford had been
playing rugby, but now the Bears

T
J had to shift to American football
! since her only opponents were north
| ern schools that did not. play rugby,
j. Stanford stuck with rugby, win
! ning nine and losing "one in 1916 and
j beating Santa Clara in its only 1917
j game. In 1918 the Cards abandoned
| sports for the duration of the war.
On November 11, 1918, the war
ended and Cal's student body presi
dent sent a message challenging
Stanford to a game of American
football to raise money for the Unit
led War Fund. Since most of the
i male students of the two schools
| were in S.A.T.C. units (forerunner
| of ROTC) at the time, eligibility was
i limited to military students only, and
| the challenge was worded from one
I S.A.T.C. unit to the other.
Stanford had not played American
; football for a number of years, but.
that did not bother Captain Sam
Parker, commanding officer of the
Stanford unit. He was a University
of California graduate, and he sim
ply ordered Stanford to field a team.
Only 19,000 tickets were sold to
the game but spirit was high. Both
campuses received liberal daubings
of paint, and San Francisco was the
I scene of a wild "Big-Game Eve"
| celebration.
The game- itself was no contest.
Cal had the makings of its Wonder
Team that went 50 straight games
without a defeat, and Stanford was
playing its first game of American
football in 13 years.
Because, however, the game was
technically between S.A.T.C. units of
the two schools and freshmen were
eligible, the game is not counted in
the official records of either school.
