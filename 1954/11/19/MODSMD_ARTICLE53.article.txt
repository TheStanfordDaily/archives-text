THE BIG THREEâ€”These three quarterbacks will see most of
the action as signal callers in tomorrow's Big Game. They are:
(left to right) Card Jerry Gustafson, Bear Paul Larson, and Card
John Brodie. Larson, an All-American candidate and the North
ern California 'Back of the Year" this season, :s a senior.
Gustafson is a junior and Rrodie a sophomore. Larson is the na-

tion's. leader in total offense, and is dangerous on his "roll out
plays to either pass or run. Gustafson i3 the running quarter
back of Chuck Taylor's team, and is most effective when oper
ating from the split T. Brodie is the passing quarterback fpr the
Cards. His favorite target is end John Stewart, and many a pass
should be thrown that way tomorrow.
