# Cal Invite Led to First Game in '91
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
As students gathered in Palo Alto
in September, 1891, for the opening
of Leiand Stanford's new University,
one of the first things that confronted
them was a challenge for a foot
ball game from the University of
California.
Stanford didn't have a team but
they did have J. R. Whittemore, an
A.A.U. swimming champ and a foot
ball zealot. He was chosen captain,
and entered into negotiations for a
content with UC. California wanted
to play on Thanksgiving, but Whitte
more realized that he could never
draw up a team in such a short time
o the game was temporarily post
poned.
Whittemore did have some good
material to work with. Five mem
bers of Lowell High School's champ
ionship team had enrolled at the new
school. Not only did these five bring
their football skill, hut they also
supplied their old school colors,
Cardinal and White. ,
MARCH DATE
By January, Whittemore realized
he had a good team and he told full
back-manager Carl Clemans to re
open negotiations with Cal. Clem
ans and his Bear counterpart se
lected March 19, 1892. This latter
agreement is the basis for the myth
that upstart Stanford challenged
mighty California.
Stanford played three practice
games before the March date. They
beat Hopkins Academy, 10-6, Berke
ley Gymnasium, 22-0, and lost to the
Olympic Club, 12-6. The game with
the Berkeley Gym boys is of inter
est since several Cal Varsity players
were ringers in the Berkeley lineup.
Cal's record was much the same as
Stanford; their only loss was also at
the hands of the Olympic Club by a
6-0 score.
The day of the game saw San
Francisco a madhouse. The two
rivals had all night parades and
bonfires in the streets, and by noon
people were heading for the Haight
Street field by every means con
ceivable.
Herbert Hoover and his California
counterpart, acting as business man
agers, had printed 5,000 tickets. These
soon ran out as 9,500 people came to
see the first contest in the greatest
football rivalry in America.
NO BALL
The two teams arrived on the field.
Referee Jack Sherrard blew his
whistle, the two captains came to
gether at mid-field, and it was then
discovered that there was no foot
ball. But luckily, one David Gouch
er, a sporting goods stoic proprietor,
was in the stands, and he hopped
into a carriage, drove to his store,
and returned with a partial football.
The outside was a regulation foot
ball but the inner bladder was from
a punching bag.
In the first half Stanford got to the
Cal 45, where they pulled out a play
that wasn't to come into use for an
other 25 years. Carl Clemans headed
into the line, but reversed the ball
to Paul Downing just before he
reached the line of scrimmage. There
was a huge pileup as the two lines
met, but Downing sped untouched
over the Blue and Gold goal line.
Whittemore then kicked the con
version to put the Cards ahead 6-0
(touchdowns in 1892 counted four
points, conversions two.)
Stanford added two, more scores in
the first half on a 45 yard run by
Clemans and a 30 yard dash by
Whittemore, to run their margin to
14 points. California's heavier weight
began to tell in the second half as
Ray Sherman plunged over for two
scores and the Bears also picked up
a safety, but it was too little, too
late, and Stanford had won the first
Big Game, 14-10.

the hands of the Olympic Club by a
6-0 score.
The day of the game saw San
Francisco a madhouse. The two
rivals had all night parades and
bonfires in the streets, and by noon
people were heading for the Haight
Street field by every means con
ceivable.
Herbert Hoover and his California
counterpart, acting as business man
agers, had printed 5,000 tickets. These
soon ran out as 9,500 people came to
see the first contest in the greatest
football rivalry in America.
NO BALL
The two teams arrived on the field.
Referee Jack Sherrard blew his
whistle, the two captains came to
gether at mid-field, and it was then
discovered that there was no foot
ball. But luckily, one David Gouch
er, a sporting goods stoic proprietor,
was in the stands, and he hopped
into a carriage, drove to his store,
and returned with a partial football.
The outside was a regulation foot
ball but the inner bladder was from
a punching bag.
In the first half Stanford got to the
Cal 45, where they pulled out a play
that wasn't to come into use for an
other 25 years. Carl Clemans headed
into the line, but reversed the ball
to Paul Downing just before he
reached the line of scrimmage. There
was a huge pileup as the two lines
met, but Downing sped untouched
over the Blue and Gold goal line.
Whittemore then kicked the con
version to put the Cards ahead 6-0
(touchdowns in 1892 counted four
points, conversions two.)
Stanford added two, more scores in
the first half on a 45 yard run by
Clemans and a 30 yard dash by
Whittemore, to run their margin to
14 points. California's heavier weight
began to tell in the second half as
Ray Sherman plunged over for two
scores and the Bears also picked up
a safety, but it was too little, too
late, and Stanford had won the first
Big Game, 14-10.
As students gathered in Palo Alto
in September, 1891, for the opening
of Leiand Stanford's new University,
one of the first things that confronted
them was a challenge for a foot
ball game from the University of
California.
Stanford didn't have a team but
they did have J. R. Whittemore, an
A.A.U. swimming champ and a foot
ball zealot. He was chosen captain,
and entered into negotiations for a
content with UC. California wanted
to play on Thanksgiving, but Whitte
more realized that he could never
draw up a team in such a short time
o the game was temporarily post
poned.
Whittemore did have some good
material to work with. Five mem
bers of Lowell High School's champ
ionship team had enrolled at the new
school. Not only did these five bring
their football skill, hut they also
supplied their old school colors,
Cardinal and White. ,
MARCH DATE
By January, Whittemore realized
he had a good team and he told full
back-manager Carl Clemans to re
open negotiations with Cal. Clem
ans and his Bear counterpart se
lected March 19, 1892. This latter
agreement is the basis for the myth
that upstart Stanford challenged
mighty California.
Stanford played three practice
games before the March date. They
beat Hopkins Academy, 10-6, Berke
ley Gymnasium, 22-0, and lost to the
Olympic Club, 12-6. The game with
the Berkeley Gym boys is of inter
est since several Cal Varsity players
were ringers in the Berkeley lineup.
Cal's record was much the same as
Stanford; their only loss was also at
the hands of the Olympic Club by a
6-0 score.
