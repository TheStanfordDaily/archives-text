# Coach Taylor Can Look For Top Notch '55 Team
## 
### BOB DURAND 
The cry of "Wait 'till next year!" has been heard quite a bit in
the vicinity of Stanford Stadium this year during football games
But what about next year? Will Chuck Taylor have a team that
will back up the cries?
On paper, the Stanford squad will be a club potentially capable

of doing groat things. The first eight,
men in this year's backfield will be
returning, and only five out of the
first 15 linemen will be graduating.
On top of this, a freshman squad
loaded with "best-ever" players will
contribute heavily to the cause.
Therefore, the Indian gridders
should have a strong bench in 1955.
The quarterback slot will be the
strongest position. Jerry Gustafson
and John Brodie, who have been
fighting for the starting berth tin .
year, will have a chance to continue
their battle next year.
Backing them up are Don Kafka,
who has gained experience in fill inf.;
in for Gustafson and Brodie this sea
son, and Jack Lewis, who has
sparked the Braves to an undefeated
record thus far this fall.
Up from the Papooses will be Jack
Douglas, who has been little short
of sensational in passing and quar
terbacking his team in their three
games.
HORN. YOUNG RETURN
The battle for the starting half
back posts should also be interest
ing. Returning next fall are Ernie
Dorn, starter for two years, and
Gordy Young, who has looked good
as a sophomore this season.
Also back on the scene will be
John NefT, whose fine performance
in this year's USC tilt proved his
worth, and Dorscy Atkinson, who
can be counted on for a consistent
job of running the ball besides do
ing some extra point kicking.
Frosh Coach Bob Ghilotti has pro
duced three halfback speedsters.
They are Doug Dick, Lou Valli, and
Jeri McMillan, all of whom have
contributed to the yearlings' sue
cess this year.
Bill Tarr will head the list of re
turnees for fullback. Tarr is perhaps
the only backfield man who stands
an above - average chance to retain
his starting spot.
Backing up Tarr will be Paul Ca
incra, who has gained some valuable
experience this fall as a sophomore
Two freshmen, Bob Schmidt and
Bill Pitkin, will also be on the '5. r >
varsity.
Leading the list of end candidates
for next year's squad is John Stew
art. He has been on the receiving
end of a majority of Brodie's and
Gustafson's aerials this year.
Steve Doctor, who turned in some
sparkling defensive work before an
injury sidelined him, and sopho
mores Bob Gergen and Carl Isaacs
will be supporting Stewart.
Also looking for first-string end
berths will be freshmen Joel Frcis
and Ed Kroeter. Freis has been the
leading receiver for the Papooses,
while Kroeter has done a capable job
on both defense and offense.
EXPERIENCE AT TACKLE
In the tackle position will be three
capable, experienced, and aggres
sive men. Chris Marshall, Paul Wig
gin, and Joel Sappenfield will he
fighting it out for the starting nod,
although they will be pressed by
Bob Birkie, who has shown great
improvement this fall.
Not to be regarded lightly at the
tackle slot is Chris Plain, who has
proved himself an outstanding frosh
lineman this year despite an ankle
injury.
Tony Mosich, 210 - pound guard,
will lead the way for the returning
guards. Also putting up a battle for
first string will be last year's fresh
man sensations. Donn Carswell and
Don Manoukian, who have im
pressed Coach Chuck Taylor tin,
year and should be capable of hold -
ing down a starting post.
Up from this year's Papoose squad
for this position will be Noel Rob
inson, 195-pounder from St. Igna
tius. Robinson has been the big Ii?"â€¢
stalwart for Coach Bob Ghilototi's
team this fall.
Chuck Taylor will miss Jerry
Goldberg at the center post, but re
turning from this season's football
ers will be Bob Long, Tom McKen
na, and Don Geddes. Russ Steele
will be moving up from the frosh
and also figures to get in the battle
for the anchor position.
On paper, the Indians have the
depth where they don't have the
strength, and have strength wl re
they don't have depth. However, a
rugged schedule might tend to bal
ancc this fact. On tap for next sea
son are the usual PCC teams phi
intersectionals with Michigan Stale
and Ohio State.
It should he a worthwhile season
to watch.
