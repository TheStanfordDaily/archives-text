## 
### PHIL HERMAN 
Looking forward to his 30th con
secutive Big Game tomorrow is Don
E. Liebendorfer, Stanford's Athletic
News Director.
Although his official title is News
Service Director for the Department
of Athletics, that heading combines
over half a dozen tasks, nearly all
j of them full - time jobs in them
selves. .
Don handles the printing of all
tickets, programs, information bul
letins to high schools, the Buck-of
the-Month Club bulletin, and press
i books; operates the athletic film ex
i changes; arranges speaking engage
ments for coaches; and travels a
week in advance of most Stanford
teams to make the necessary ar
rangements.
Also, until a few years ago he
i served as public address announcer
in the Stadium for football games,
I although he gave up the job in order
I to be available in the press box. He
[ still continues as announcer for
| track meets and baseball games,
however.
The genial host of the Stadium

I press box took over his job even be
fore he graduated from Stanford in
1925. While a student on the Farm,
Don was a member of Breakers eat
ing club and one of the original
freshman sponsors in Encina. He
was also editor of The Daily in 1924
and sports editor of the Quad the
same year. A member of Sigma
Delta Chi, national journalism fra
ternity, he also wrote for "Specta
tor" and the "Illustrated Review."
' During the war Don was con
nected with athletic publicity for the
: Navy for a time. He entered as a
full lieutenant and went into re
j serve status as a commander. In his
j 45 months' duty he spent time at
San Diego, St. Mary's Pre-Flight.
I and with the staff headquarters of
the 12th Naval District in San Fran
j cisco.
As far as past Big Games are con
| cerned, Liebendorfer considers the
1924 contest and last year's Stan
| ford-Cal clash the most exciting.
In 1924, Stanford was trailing 20
j to 6 with five minutes to play in
the game, when the Indians came
back to score two quick touchdowns
to make the final tally '20-all.
Last year's game, which ended in
a 21-21 tie, saw just the reverse, as
| Stanford was on top 21 to 7 going
1 into the final period, when the Bears
j surged back to knot the count and
| then almost win it with a field goal
! attempt that went awry late in the
! contest.
* He 'remembers the best - played
I game as the 1947 tilt, in which the
Indians winless for the season and
| 40-point underdogs to Cal bowed in
the final minutes 21 to 18.


TOUGH GRIDDER — One of the top players this season on
Chuck Taylor's squad is halfback Ernie Dorn. The junior from
Minneapolis, Minn., is completing his second season as a first
stringer. Last year he netted close to 300 yards from scrim
mage. Despite his football ability, he may have to fight for his
first string berth next season, with a number of good freshmen
back coming to the Varsity, as well as most present runners
returning.

TOUGH GRIDDER — One of the top players this season on
Chuck Taylor's squad is halfback Ernie Dorn. The junior from
Minneapolis, Minn., is completing his second season as a first
stringer. Last year he netted close to 300 yards from scrim
mage. Despite his football ability, he may have to fight for his
first string berth next season, with a number of good freshmen
back coming to the Varsity, as well as most present runners
returning.
Looking forward to his 30th con
secutive Big Game tomorrow is Don
E. Liebendorfer, Stanford's Athletic
News Director.
Although his official title is News
Service Director for the Department
of Athletics, that heading combines
over half a dozen tasks, nearly all
j of them full - time jobs in them
selves. .
Don handles the printing of all
tickets, programs, information bul
letins to high schools, the Buck-of
the-Month Club bulletin, and press
i books; operates the athletic film ex
i changes; arranges speaking engage
ments for coaches; and travels a
week in advance of most Stanford
teams to make the necessary ar
rangements.
Also, until a few years ago he
i served as public address announcer
in the Stadium for football games,
I although he gave up the job in order
I to be available in the press box. He
[ still continues as announcer for
| track meets and baseball games,
however.
The genial host of the Stadium

I press box took over his job even be
fore he graduated from Stanford in
1925. While a student on the Farm,
Don was a member of Breakers eat
ing club and one of the original
freshman sponsors in Encina. He
was also editor of The Daily in 1924
and sports editor of the Quad the
same year. A member of Sigma
Delta Chi, national journalism fra
ternity, he also wrote for "Specta
tor" and the "Illustrated Review."
' During the war Don was con
nected with athletic publicity for the
: Navy for a time. He entered as a
full lieutenant and went into re
j serve status as a commander. In his
j 45 months' duty he spent time at
San Diego, St. Mary's Pre-Flight.
I and with the staff headquarters of
the 12th Naval District in San Fran
j cisco.
As far as past Big Games are con
| cerned, Liebendorfer considers the
1924 contest and last year's Stan
| ford-Cal clash the most exciting.
