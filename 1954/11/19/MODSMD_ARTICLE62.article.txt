# Al Masters Oversees All Farm Sports
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
Ai Masters, Stanioid's Director of
Athletics, is a busy man. He is in
.•harge oi Stanford's complete athletic
program, and his duties include ev
erything from placating golf club
members over bills to scheduling
iootball games lor Chuck Taylor's
joys.
Al Masters must be considered an
authority on Big Games. He's seen
ill but two of them since the revival
jf the series after World War I. He
shook his head as he commented on
.he two he had missed, "112 was work
ng in Portland in 1924 and missed
that 20-20 game, and then in 1935,
when the Vow Boys bowed out, I
was in New York for an Olympic
Games Committee Meeting," the
silver-haired Masters stated.
Masters picked the 1934 Big Game
as the most exciting tilt he ever
saw. "It was back when the team
that went to the Rose Bowl got all
the profits, and the winner of the
Big Game was going to get the Pasa
dena trip," he said. "It was a very

close game, but a third-string end,
Carl Schott, kicked a field goal to
give us a 9-7 win and all that
money."
ENJOYABLE GAME
As his most enjoyable Big Game,
Masters lists Stanford's 42-ti win in
1926 when Dick Hyland had a field
day. The Athletic Director picks
1947's 21-18 loss as his most disap
pointing game.
Big Game is a headache to Mast
ers in some respects, though. Alum
ni always call at the last minute
asking for non-existant tickets, and
he must explain that the precious
pieces* of cardboard are allotted
weeks before the game.
28,000 TICKETS
For this year's Big Game, Stan
ford gets about 28,000 tickets. These
must be spread between students,
faculty, stadium subscribers, alumni,
and Buck Club members. But the
$135,000 that Stanford receives from
the proceeds goes a long way toward
easing the headaches.
Masters is a Stanford man through
and through. He was a member of
the Class of '21, and was ASSU pres
ident. as well as captaining the Stan
ford soccer team his senior year.

that 20-20 game, and then in 1935,
when the Vow Boys bowed out, I
was in New York for an Olympic
Games Committee Meeting," the
silver-haired Masters stated.
Masters picked the 1934 Big Game
as the most exciting tilt he ever
saw. "It was back when the team
that went to the Rose Bowl got all
the profits, and the winner of the
Big Game was going to get the Pasa
dena trip," he said. "It was a very

close game, but a third-string end,
Carl Schott, kicked a field goal to
give us a 9-7 win and all that
money."
ENJOYABLE GAME
As his most enjoyable Big Game,
Masters lists Stanford's 42-ti win in
1926 when Dick Hyland had a field
day. The Athletic Director picks
1947's 21-18 loss as his most disap
pointing game.
Big Game is a headache to Mast
ers in some respects, though. Alum
ni always call at the last minute
asking for non-existant tickets, and
he must explain that the precious
pieces* of cardboard are allotted
weeks before the game.
28,000 TICKETS
For this year's Big Game, Stan
ford gets about 28,000 tickets. These
must be spread between students,
faculty, stadium subscribers, alumni,
and Buck Club members. But the
$135,000 that Stanford receives from
the proceeds goes a long way toward
easing the headaches.
Masters is a Stanford man through
and through. He was a member of
the Class of '21, and was ASSU pres
ident. as well as captaining the Stan
ford soccer team his senior year.
