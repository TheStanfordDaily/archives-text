# Manager Easter Vital Cog in Red Machine
## 
### MIKE McGINNIS 
When the Stanford varsity trots on the field to mest Cal fornia,
you may fail to notice a person who walks to the player's bench
behind the herd. He will be buried under a pile of equipment.
This man is often refered to as the "water boy." But when we
study the many duties of John Reed "Hap" Easter closer up, his
water hustling trade becomes minor.♦

Monday is the head football man- ;
uger's busiest day. He toils through
piles of paper work, preparing next
Saturday's complimentary ticket list
for the team and compiling the
'ribbon list" of field officials. He
spends the afternoon at the practice
field, and that night supervises the
l showing of movies of last Saturday's 1
: game to the team.
The head manager is a .senior and
is elected during his junior year on i
votes cast by (1) Director of Ath-'
letics Al Masters; (2) Miss Eunice
DuPrau, BAC office manager; CI)
Coach Chuck Taylor; (4) Jake Ir
win, manager of the Encina Gym ;
Store; and (5) the outgoing head |

the "Big Kea" equipment trunks to
the Stadium.

meals and checks in at hotels. He
takes all extra worries off the
coach'*! hack.

need to be a manager," Hap sairl as
he stood on the cold practice field
one afternoon. "If I wasn't interested
in football and didn't enjoy it, I
wouldn't be out here."
