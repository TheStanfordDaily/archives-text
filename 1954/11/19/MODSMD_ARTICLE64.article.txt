# Grid Careers to End For 29 Cal, Card Seniors
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
This Big Game is the last one for more than two dozen Stanford
and California gridders.
Fourteen seniors from the Indian squad and fifteen from the
Bears are getting their last chance to perform in the traditional
rivalry tomorrow.

The Berkeley grid machine wi
than Stanford, however. Pappy Wal-'"
dorf will most likely weep over the
even first-stringers that won't ap
pear in the Strawberry Canyon sta
lium next year.
Heading the list is quar ack
Paul Larson. The Turlock Terror is
radically a cinch All-America this
year. Larson was the nation's top
jffensive player last season with a
Lotul of 1572 yards net running and
jassing. His optional run-pass play
was one of the main factors in Cal's
21-21 tie with Stanford in the Big
Game.
This year Larson is more danger
ous than ever. He has been leading
the nation in passing for half the
season, is running a strong second
to Oregon's George Shaw in total
offense nationally, and seems certain
to smash Don Heinrich's pass com
pletion percentage record of .(>O7 set
in 1950.
The Bears also lose center Matt
Hazeltine, who, after an outstanding
junior year, was billed as All-Am
erican pick of this year. One of Haz
eltine's best games in 1953 was the
Big Game, in which he gave an out
standing linebacking performance,

11 be hit much harder by losses
y-
intercepting three Bobby Garrett
passes. /
lIANIFAN TO GO
End Jim Hanifan- too, hits the
sheepskin trail this year. Hanifan,
the main receiving end of Larson's
aerials, has been top pass-catcher in
the PCC most of the season. Stan
ford's own John Stewart has been
giving Hanifan a close fight all the
way. The Big Game should deckle
the issue once and for all.
Starting left half Hal Norris, left
tackle Ken Schwocho, right guard
Mike Giddings, and left guard
Charlie Martucci will leave big holes
in the starting lineup.
Larson's understudy, Sammy Wil
liams will be missed nextyyear. Wil
liams is an excellent passer and an
exceptional defensive player. A two
year letterman, Williams' only fault
is playing on the same team with
Larson.
Waldorf will also mourn the pass
ing of center Lloyd Torchio, and
reserve tackle George Najarian.
Both are '53 letterwinners. End Jim
Kidder, half Sebastian Bordonaro,
center Ray Donnelly, tackle Jere
Brooks, and tackle John Garzoli
completes the list of seniors.
Stanford's most serious problem
next year will be in filling the
vacancy left by center Jerry Gold
berg. Goldberg, a two-year letter
man and candidate for All-Coast
honors, has been coach Chuck
Taylor's best lineman all season. It
has been estimated he makes more
than half of Stanford's tackles. Gold
berg was an Associated Press "Line
man of the Week" for his perform
ance in the Illinois game.
Taylor already;has had to fill Matt
Armitage's left guard position. Arm
itage, a two year letterwinner and
recipient of the Bob Mathias Sports
manship trophy, broke his leg in
practice following the UCLA game
and was sidelined for the season.
Roy Krickeberg, another two-year
veteran, took over for Armitage, but
suffered a hip pointer in the Wash
ington game. He was reinsured
against Washington State.
Right tackle John Ludeke has im
proved considerably this year. He
has been alternating with junior
Paul Wiggin in the number one po
sition.
Left tackle and Captain Win
Wedge was moved out of the starting
spot by junior Chris Marshall. Since
then they have been alternating in
this slot.
Jack Gebert is another senior
hampered by injuries. Top quarter
back in spring practice, Gebert
racked his knee in preseason prac
tice and still has not returned to
full efficiency. As a sophomore in
1952, Gebert completed 21 out of 39
passes for 321 yards and a new PCC
record (later broken by Bob Gar
rett) against Oregon.
Ends Ron Bush, Dick Jones, and
Jim McCamant, who have all been
seeing considerable action this year,
will be missing from the roster next
fall. Veteran guards Wes Wedge and
Paul Revak will be among the miss
ing too.
Backs Jarvis Watson, Dick Cre
peau, and Joe Moreau also bow out
tomorrow. Watson, regular fullback
in '53, was beaten out by junior Bill
Tarr this fall. Watson has been al
ternating at hall back and fullback
this season. Moreau is currently
number three fullback behind Tarr
and soph Paul Camera. Crepeau,
another fullback, was injured early
in the season.
