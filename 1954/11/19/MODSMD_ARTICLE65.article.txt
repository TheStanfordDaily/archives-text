# Press Box Is Busy Place Informing Stay-at-homes
## 
### BOB DURAND 
Eighty-two thousand people with
but one purpose in mind —to see
their favorite team win — will file
into Memorial Stadium in Berkeley
tomorrow.
Probably three times that many
will with they could be doing the
same thing. However, they will have
to be satisfied with Listening to the
radio or reading Sunday morning's
paper.
High atop the west side of the
Stadium, in a building commonly
referred to as the press box, will be
the people whose job it will be to
see that those who, can't see the
game will hear or read about it.
The California press box seats ap
proximately 117 persons, 80 oi whom
attend on a seasonal basis. The seats
are given to the members of the
working press from local newspa
pers, the wire services, radio broad
casters, and to statisticians, an
nouncers, and photographers.
Included in the large enclosure
are writing desks for reporters, two
broadcasting booths, a technicians'
booth, a producers' booth, and a
public address booth. Directly
above this section is a loft which
will accommodate local photogra
phers, and television and newsreel
cameras.
In charge of this hubbub of ac
tivity% is Bob Rubin, athletic pub
licity director for the University ol

California. Rubin has the job of
keeping the press box running
smoothly and efficiently besides act
ing as official host.
Services to all the working press
during the game will include ab
breviated half-time statistics, com
plete post-game statistics, play by
play, substitutions, scoring sum
mary, and post - game interviews
with the two opposing coaches, Wal
dorf and Taylor.
Anyone visiting the press box for
the first time tomorrow will be
awed at the amount of activity go
ing on and -will wonder how order
can be brought out of the confusion.
The constant hum of the typewrit
ers, the bells of the teletypes, and
the buzz of the Western Union ma
chines present a combination of
noises that can be heard in no other
place but a press box.
During the half - time activities,
the working reporters usually like
to take time off to rest their minds
and their fingers. Here, they are
treated to sandwiches, cokes, and
coffee by Rubin.
This cannot take long, however,
for there is work to be done. The
typewriters and teletypes must be
kept moving to keep up with the
stories that are on their way to the
people who will be waiting to read
about the game in the newspapers,
come morning.
