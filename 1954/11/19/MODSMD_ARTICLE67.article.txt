# Lots of Company For Footballers On the Gridiron
## 
### DON JACKSON 
Twenty-two uniformed athletes
will be pushing each other on the
floor of Memorial Stadium Saturday,
but they'll have plenty of company
on the turf in Strawberry Canyon's
depths.
Somewhere between i5O and 175
people, in capacities ranging from
coach to caption writer will be
swarming over the sidelines and en
joying little of the game in their of
ficial positions.
From 50 to 75 cameramen and their
assistants will turn up, Brownies in
hand, for the Red and Blue struggle.
They will represent aIL the major
news services — International News
Service, United Press, and Associated
Press —as well as local newspapers
and other interested dailies on the
Coast.
No reporters are allowed on the
field, so if you see someone taking
notes, he's probably a caption writer.
Unless, of course, he's an inspired
novelist solving the world's problems.
Reporters like to see the game, a
feat difficult to accomplish from the
sidelines.
LOTS OF POLICE
A generous supply of student po
lice, as well as a corps of uniformed
lawmen that increases numerically
as the game continues, swells the
sidelines total to more than 100.
Photographers come under the
jurisdiction of California Athletic
Publicity Director Bob Rubin, who
explains that rules permit the cam
eramen to roam the sidelines at ran
dom during the first quarter, but
only between the 35-yard lines and
the goals the remainder of the game.
In addition to cameramen and po
licemen, more than fifty other per
sons, including coaches, trainers,
managers, equipment men, officials,
and telephone crews connecting the
field, with the press box, public ad
dress system and scoreboard will be
dodging flashbulbs on the field's
border.
It's hardly practical to try to get
a pass for your Uncle Horace or
high school coach, however, since the
Athletic Department invariably gives
an emphatic thumbs down to such
propositions.
