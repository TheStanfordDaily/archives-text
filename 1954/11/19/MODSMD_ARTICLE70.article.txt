# How to Watch a Football Game: Follow Line, Guards, Backs, Ball
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
How do you watch a football
game'. ; It's c ,sy: simply follow the
line (particularly the guards), the
backs, and the football all at the
same time.
For people who don t have the
ability to look in four different
places at once, the chore is some
what more difficult. But there are
certainly proper and improper ways
to watch a game.
Some fans gp to football games for
years and ye rs and never improve
their viev>infe habits. That is to say,

they know no more about the last
game than the first.
A fan who tried to watch only the
line play of a game would miss the
major part of the action. However,
the axiom that games are won or
lost in the line is generally true, so
the line can't be ignored by any
means.
The backfiejd athletes are the
"money" players. But if they don't
have a hole opened up for them,
you can't tell the difference between
the bush leaguer and the All-Amer
ican.
Following the football isn't an
easy chore, particularly under the
T-formation, which both teams will
use tomorrow. A good quarterback
can confuse most bf the other play
ers on the field and all the fans in
the stand.
It probably isn't best to watch any
one thing exclusively. Instead, a
combination of the elements is best.
Coach Bud Wilkinson of Okla
homa (the Oakies play a pretty good
brand of ball for Coach Bud) recom
mends that you cast your eyes over
the line charge for the first couple
of seconds after the ball is snapped.
In that instant you can usually
tell what type of play the offensive
team is running and what type of
defense the defenders are employ
ing.
If the offensive linemen on the left
side of the line charge across the
scrimmage into the secondary, look
for a run to the right. If the linemen
on the right side break across, the
chances are that the running play
is going to the left. The men who
break across the line of scrimmage
are headed out to block a man in
the defensive secondary.
If none of the linemen cross the
scrimmage, the odds are good that
a pass is coming. Linemen may not
go down field on a pass.
If Cal or UCLA linemen hold their
ground, it is a little more difficult to
anticipate the play. Paul Larson and
the Bruin tailback often run a pass
run option play, and under those
circumstances the linemen sort of
drift along in front of the ball car
rier, b.ut behind the scrimmage line.
At the start of pass plays, you can
also tell what type of general defen
sive maneuver is being employed.
Wilkinson says the defensive line
either charges or "plays it cozy."

Utually some linemen charge and
ome play it cozy. But a majority
vill be doing one maneuver and will
do it on a majority of plays.
LINEMEN SHOW TREND 1
Those are a couple ot trends
which you can discern by watching
the linemen as the ball is snapped.
In doing this you won't lose track
>112 the ball. In fact, knowing which
way the play is going may help you
pin down the ball carrier more eas
ily-
Another method of getting a quick
insight on the direction of the offen
sive attack is- to follow the guard.
Many systems use the guard as the
lead blocker for the ball carrier. Il
linois ran both guards ahead of the
play until Stanford made them quit.
ENDS SHAKE BACKC
One of the most impressive rou
tines to watch at a football game
(aside from those of song leaders
ind pompon girls) is the fakipg pat
tern of a potential pass receiver.
John Stewart and Jim Haiiifan par
ticularly will demonstrate how to
hake a defensive back tomorrow
afternoon.
Watching the defensive secondary
wil4 give you an insight on one of
the most difficult phases of wide
open football—pass defense. If you
study safety men and linebackers
particularly, they will demonstrate
what the problems are. The average
fan is aware of the pass defender
only when he has allowed a receiver
to catch a pass. Therefore he looks
lousy.
REMEMBER PREVIOUS PLAYS
As the game progresses, remember
what "*the previous plays have
brought. Notice any trends—where
the offense gains consistently, what
type of plays result in big gainers,
who is making the bulk of the
tackles. With this knowledge, you
can begin to understand the tactical
aspects of carrying on a football
war.

In summary, a spectator should
try to comprehend the over - all
trends of the action and not rivet his
attention exclusively on the ball.
You should receive much more sat
isfaction from an afternoon in the
stands if you are aware of the gen
eral patterns basic to football.
But you are to notice all these
things at the same time you are
watching the ball. The football is
the thing. And I don't want any
body blaming me if .he misses a
touchdown pass to the right end
while he watches the left end elude
a halfback. Watch the ball.

use tomorrow. A good quarterback
can confuse most bf the other play
ers on the field and all the fans in
the stand.
It probably isn't best to watch any
one thing exclusively. Instead, a
combination of the elements is best.
Coach Bud Wilkinson of Okla
homa (the Oakies play a pretty good
brand of ball for Coach Bud) recom
mends that you cast your eyes over
the line charge for the first couple
of seconds after the ball is snapped.
In that instant you can usually
tell what type of play the offensive
team is running and what type of
defense the defenders are employ
ing.
If the offensive linemen on the left
side of the line charge across the
scrimmage into the secondary, look
for a run to the right. If the linemen
on the right side break across, the
chances are that the running play
is going to the left. The men who
break across the line of scrimmage
are headed out to block a man in
the defensive secondary.
If none of the linemen cross the
scrimmage, the odds are good that
a pass is coming. Linemen may not
go down field on a pass.
If Cal or UCLA linemen hold their
ground, it is a little more difficult to
anticipate the play. Paul Larson and
the Bruin tailback often run a pass
run option play, and under those
circumstances the linemen sort of
drift along in front of the ball car
rier, b.ut behind the scrimmage line.
At the start of pass plays, you can
also tell what type of general defen
sive maneuver is being employed.
Wilkinson says the defensive line
either charges or "plays it cozy."

Utually some linemen charge and
ome play it cozy. But a majority
vill be doing one maneuver and will
do it on a majority of plays.
LINEMEN SHOW TREND 1
Those are a couple ot trends
which you can discern by watching
the linemen as the ball is snapped.
In doing this you won't lose track
>112 the ball. In fact, knowing which
way the play is going may help you
pin down the ball carrier more eas
ily-
Another method of getting a quick
insight on the direction of the offen
sive attack is- to follow the guard.
Many systems use the guard as the
lead blocker for the ball carrier. Il
linois ran both guards ahead of the
play until Stanford made them quit.

One of the most impressive rou
tines to watch at a football game
(aside from those of song leaders
ind pompon girls) is the fakipg pat
tern of a potential pass receiver.
John Stewart and Jim Haiiifan par
ticularly will demonstrate how to
hake a defensive back tomorrow

Watching the defensive secondary
wil4 give you an insight on one of
the most difficult phases of wide
open football—pass defense. If you
study safety men and linebackers
particularly, they will demonstrate
what the problems are. The average
fan is aware of the pass defender
only when he has allowed a receiver
to catch a pass. Therefore he looks
lousy.
REMEMBER PREVIOUS PLAYS
As the game progresses, remember
what "*the previous plays have
brought. Notice any trends—where
the offense gains consistently, what
type of plays result in big gainers,
who is making the bulk of the
tackles. With this knowledge, you
can begin to understand the tactical
aspects of carrying on a football
war.

In summary, a spectator should
try to comprehend the over - all
trends of the action and not rivet his
attention exclusively on the ball.
You should receive much more sat
isfaction from an afternoon in the
stands if you are aware of the gen
eral patterns basic to football.
But you are to notice all these
things at the same time you are
watching the ball. The football is
the thing. And I don't want any
body blaming me if .he misses a
touchdown pass to the right end
while he watches the left end elude
a halfback. Watch the ball.
How do you watch a football

line (particularly the guards), the
backs, and the football all at the

For people who don t have the
ability to look in four different
places at once, the chore is some
what more difficult. But there are
certainly proper and improper ways
to watch a game.

years and ye rs and never improve

A fan who tried to watch only the

ground, it is a little more difficult to
anticipate the play. Paul Larson and
the Bruin tailback often run a pass
run option play, and under those
circumstances the linemen sort of
drift along in front of the ball car
rier, b.ut behind the scrimmage line.
At the start of pass plays, you can
also tell what type of general defen
sive maneuver is being employed.
Wilkinson says the defensive line
either charges or "plays it cozy."

Utually some linemen charge and
ome play it cozy. But a majority
vill be doing one maneuver and will
do it on a majority of plays.
LINEMEN SHOW TREND 1
Those are a couple ot trends
which you can discern by watching
the linemen as the ball is snapped.
In doing this you won't lose track
>112 the ball. In fact, knowing which
way the play is going may help you
pin down the ball carrier more eas
ily-
Another method of getting a quick
insight on the direction of the offen
sive attack is- to follow the guard.
Many systems use the guard as the
lead blocker for the ball carrier. Il
linois ran both guards ahead of the
play until Stanford made them quit.
ENDS SHAKE BACKC
One of the most impressive rou
tines to watch at a football game
(aside from those of song leaders
ind pompon girls) is the fakipg pat
tern of a potential pass receiver.
John Stewart and Jim Haiiifan par
ticularly will demonstrate how to
hake a defensive back tomorrow
afternoon.
Watching the defensive secondary
wil4 give you an insight on one of
the most difficult phases of wide
open football—pass defense. If you
study safety men and linebackers
particularly, they will demonstrate
what the problems are. The average
fan is aware of the pass defender
only when he has allowed a receiver
to catch a pass. Therefore he looks
lousy.
REMEMBER PREVIOUS PLAYS
As the game progresses, remember
what "*the previous plays have
brought. Notice any trends—where
the offense gains consistently, what
type of plays result in big gainers,
who is making the bulk of the
tackles. With this knowledge, you
can begin to understand the tactical
aspects of carrying on a football
war.

In summary, a spectator should
try to comprehend the over - all
trends of the action and not rivet his
attention exclusively on the ball.
You should receive much more sat
isfaction from an afternoon in the
stands if you are aware of the gen
eral patterns basic to football.
But you are to notice all these
things at the same time you are
watching the ball. The football is
the thing. And I don't want any
body blaming me if .he misses a
touchdown pass to the right end
while he watches the left end elude
a halfback. Watch the ball.
How do you watch a football
game'. ; It's c ,sy: simply follow the
line (particularly the guards), the
backs, and the football all at the
same time.
For people who don t have the
ability to look in four different
places at once, the chore is some
what more difficult. But there are
certainly proper and improper ways
to watch a game.
Some fans gp to football games for
years and ye rs and never improve
their viev>infe habits. That is to say,

they know no more about the last
game than the first.
A fan who tried to watch only the
line play of a game would miss the
major part of the action. However,
the axiom that games are won or
lost in the line is generally true, so
the line can't be ignored by any
means.
The backfiejd athletes are the
"money" players. But if they don't
have a hole opened up for them,
you can't tell the difference between
the bush leaguer and the All-Amer
ican.
Following the football isn't an
easy chore, particularly under the
T-formation, which both teams will
use tomorrow. A good quarterback
can confuse most bf the other play
ers on the field and all the fans in
the stand.
It probably isn't best to watch any
one thing exclusively. Instead, a
combination of the elements is best.
Coach Bud Wilkinson of Okla
homa (the Oakies play a pretty good
brand of ball for Coach Bud) recom
mends that you cast your eyes over
the line charge for the first couple
of seconds after the ball is snapped.
In that instant you can usually
tell what type of play the offensive
team is running and what type of
defense the defenders are employ
ing.
If the offensive linemen on the left
side of the line charge across the
scrimmage into the secondary, look
for a run to the right. If the linemen
on the right side break across, the
chances are that the running play
is going to the left. The men who
break across the line of scrimmage
are headed out to block a man in
the defensive secondary.
If none of the linemen cross the
scrimmage, the odds are good that
a pass is coming. Linemen may not
go down field on a pass.
