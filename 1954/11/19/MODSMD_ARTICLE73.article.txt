# Select Few Football Stars Will Become Professional
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
The Big Game rolls around tomorrow, and for many of the play
ers it marks their final game of organized football. And for others,
a select handful —from either Cal or Stanford, it is only the be
ginning. For one, two, or maybe more of the boys, the Big Game
marks a graduation: a graduation into the ranks of the National

Football League. +
There are several men from both
schools for whom the Big Game
proved to be the final preparatory
step on the way to making a liveli- i
hood in the "play foi pay" echelons j
of the game. California and Stan
ford arc about equally represented j
in the NFL.
The eldest player ;;ti 11 actively
playing the game from either school !
is Stanford's Bruno Banducci, cap
tain and often ive guard for the San
Francisco 49ers. Banducci played his ;
last Big Game in 1C49, became a
charter member of the SF club or
ganized in 1945. and is now one of
the very few 10-year veterans oper
ating in the barrue.
Other younger Indian grads, three j
of them to be exact, are also trying j
to make a go of the rough and i
tumble pro grame. Two of these, '
Bill ?»IcColl and Gary Kerkoriafi, |
played their la. 1 Big Game (in the j
team that losi to Cal in 1951, the
same team that went on to be j
trounced by Illinois in the 1952 Rose |
Bowl game.
McCOLL WITH BEARS
The case of All-American end Bill i
McColl is a particularly interest- 1
ing one. He chose to play pro ball |
with the Chicago Bears only because
the Bears allow him to continue his I
Medical Sehooi studies at the U of
Chicago, at the same time which he j
plays the "third end" in George j
Halas' special passing "slot forma
tion."
Kerkorian, after trying and miss
ing with Pittsburgh Steelers, now
seems assured of a regular quarter
back slot with the Baltimore Colts.
Gary has become quite a kicking
specialist, having booted several long
field goals already this season.
Bobby Garrett, Stanford's passing
sensation of last year, was the Cleve
land Browns' bonus choice in last
year's NFL draft. Paul Brown trad
ed him to Green Bay early this
year, and now Bobby sees occasional
action behind the Packers' quarter
back. Tobin Rote.
FIVE IMiOS FROM CAL
California has just the same num
ber of players as Stanford in pro
ball—four. The oldest of these is
Pete Schabe.rum, .star of the 1949
California powerhouse which tanked
Stafford 33 to 14.
Schabarum is currently a top
fiicht defensive back for the San

Frtmci.co 49ers.
The Golden Bears from the class
of 1952 are now established with
their current professional aggrega
tion. All three, backs John Ols
zewski and Don Johnson and guard
Les Richter, played prominent part;
in shattering an undefeated Stan
ford season in the 1951 Big Garno.
All-America linebacker Richter
was so highly thought of by his
current employers, the Los Angeles
Rams, that they traded 11 players to
obtain him from the Dallas Texans.
He plays both ways for the Rams.
Olszewski, the Long Beach terror,
is now running for the Chicago
Cardinals. Johnson wears the colors
of the Philadelphia Eagles, for
whom he specializes mostly as a
punt returner.


STILL A GREAT RECEIVER—Former Stanford end Bill McColl
catches a pass lor his present team, the professional Chicago
Bears. The catch was made in ihe recent game in San Francisco
against the 49ers. Joe 4 re nas (22) grams in vain for the pig
skin. McColl is but one of a number of Stanford and California
players who have become stars in the play-for-pay circuit. Mc-
Coll is finishing medical school while playing for George Halas.
