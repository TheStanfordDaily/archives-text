# '54 Season Disappointing To Both Wedge, Hazeltine
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
This season has been a disappointing one for most of the fol
owers of Stanford and California, and that the gridiron campaign
las not exactly been a very successful one can also be said about
he rival captains for tomorrow's Big Game, Win Wedge of the
ndians and Matt Hazeltine of the Bears.
Wedge, a 5-10, 205-pounder from Modesto, was slated to hold

lown the left tackle spot on
3ard level this fall, and was gen
erally rated to have a good chancc
or all-coast honors.
Wedge, however, has had difficulty
2ven making the starting team as
hustling Chris Marshall, a junior
rom Palo Alto impnjvod tremend
)usly in his play over last season
ind has gotten the starting call from
Coach Chuck Taylor in most of this
year's games.
Despite this somewhat limited ac
tion, Wedge has seen considerable
action as a sub for Marshall, and
when he has played he has per
formed well, particularly in the Il
linois and USC games.
This season marks Wedge's fourth
on the Cardinal varsity, as he broke
nto the lineup as a guard during
the 1951 season. Wedge was a guard
during the following year, but in
spring practice of 1953 was shifted
to tackle and has done very well
at that position, especially last sea
son when he played a total of 285
minutes, including 49 minutes in the
Big Game and 51 minutes in the
Washington tilt.
Not considered a flashy player by
Indian coaches, Wedge is an ex
tremely hard worker during prac
tice and plays a good well-balanced
game. He is extremely tough to
move or fool on defense and on of

fense excels in so-calied "onc-on
one" blocking.
Off the gridiron, Wedge is a So
cial Science major and a member of
Delta Tau Delta. His twin brother
Wes is captain of this year's Braves
and has seen some action on the
varsity.
Matt Hazeltine of the Bears- was
generally regarded as everybody's
All-Amcrican at center in the pre
season forecasts.
Hazeltine, a 6-2, 210-pound senior
who hails from Kentfield. was se
lected on the first All-American
teams of Look Magazine, Interna
tional News Service, and the Na
tional Broadcasting Company last
season and was generally consid
ered one of the college football's
finest linemen in 1953.
Hazeltine, however, got off to an
unbelievably slow start this fall, and
really didn't hit his stride until the
UCLA game. By then he was vir
tually out of the running for All-
America honors as most of the myth
ical elevens are picked on play in
the early season games. Hazeltine
was selected, however, as Lineman
of the Year by the Northern Cali
fornia football writers.
Despite his "comedown" this sea
son, Hazeltine is still considered to
be the finest center California has
had since Pappy Waldorf has been
coach at Berkeley.
Hazeltine, like Wedge, is a three- 1
year letterman, having played on
the varsity as a frosh v and last
season played 371 minutes. He is
regarded as an excellent offensive
center, but excels even more on de
fense playing in the left linebacker
position.
Hazeltine is the son of Dr.
Matthew Hazeltine, who was a Cali
fornia gridiron star before World
War I and played in the 1912 and
1913 Big Games. He is a history
major and on the Cal campus resides
at Sigma Phi.
