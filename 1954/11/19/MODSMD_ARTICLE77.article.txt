# Trainer Jarvis Says '54 Not Bad Year Injury-wise

### BOB MIEROW 
When the referee signals for time out in tomorrow's Big Game
the man who rushes out onto the field and into the midst of the
Stanford huddle will be Connie Jarvis, head Indian trainer. larvis,
who hasn't missed a Card gridiron tussle since the war, took over
as trainer for all Indian teams in 1946.
"This has not been an unusually bad year for injuries," declares

the Big Red's medicine man. "The 4
major problem this season is that
most of the ailments to key players
have been centralized at the guard
position."
The Card trainer points out that
injuries on Stanford pigskin squads
are amplified because the material
is so much thinner than at other PCC
clubs.
Jarvis recalls several instances
when the Cards have gone into Big
Games without the services of several
key players. In the 1951 classic,
eight of the first eleven offensive
players started despite injuries. Al
most none of the injured eight in
cluding Bob Mathias, Ron Cook, and
Harry Hugasianâ€”lasted the first
period.
Cal won that game. 20-7, but the
Cards had already earned the invi
tation to the Rose Bowl.
"Stanford has at least a fifty-fifty
chance to win this year's Big Game,"
declares Jarvis. The trainer bases his
belief on the desire of the boys, the
supremacy of Stanford's line, and
the ability of the Card coaching staff.
Jarvis' assistant trainer is Dave
Eldredge, a graduate student from
the Hawaiian Islands. Eldredge came
to the Farm several years ago as an
outstanding gridiron prospect.
"This may surprise a lot of peoplp,
but hand injuries are the most com
mon ailments to football players,"
states Jarvis. Although they usually
do not keep gridders out of action,

70 per cent of all varsity players
come up with injured hands or
fingers.
Any time a Stanford athlete sus
tains a serious injury, he is turned
over to Dr. Fritz Roth, team physi
cian. Dr. Roth must pass on whether
or not a player can re-enter a game
after being injured.
Jarvis, who has been trainer for
the annual East-West Shrine foot
ball classic several times, was re
cently the subject of an article in
Sports Illustrated.
