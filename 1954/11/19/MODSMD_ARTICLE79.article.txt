# THE 						BIG MUDDY
## 
### 
The 1912 Big Game is known as
the Mud Game, A steady downpour
for two days prior to the game made
.he playing field a virtual sea of
mud. and players on both sides
could not be distinguished from
each other. No long runs were made
that day, as staying on one's feet
was practically impossible, and the
game ended in a 3-3 tie.
