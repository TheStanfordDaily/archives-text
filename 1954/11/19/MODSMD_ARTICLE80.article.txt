# Chuck Taylor Combines Optimism With Top Notch Assistant Coaches
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
There are many days when the
lverage college football mentor de
clares during the fall season, "We'll
be lucky to score a touchdown to
day." In this aura of pessimism,
.here is still one football coach —
Chuck Taylor — who audaciously
predicts "Stanford will win today."
More often than not he is right.
Since his return to the farm in
1951, Coach Taylor has installed
three important things into Stanford
football: winning teams, a-winning
spirit, and a staff of capable coach
ing assistants. They are, in a large
part, responsible for the first two
attributes.
Taylor organizes and delegates re
sponsibility. The assistants — back
field coaches Pete Kmetovic and
George Lynn, line coaches Dutch
Fehring and Joe Ruetz, freshman
coach, Bob Ghilotti, and Brave coach
Mai Elward—carry out their indi
vidual assignments.
They teach Stanford players the
fundamentals and the intricacies of
the game. They show the strong and
weak points of the opposition, so
that on Saturday the Indians may
make the most of these.
CHUCK TAYLOR
Head Coach Taylor, in his first
season as head coach, made a Rose
Bowl team of the same players who
in two preceding years had finished
second and fifth in the PCC race.
He was named "Coach of the Year"
for this achievement.
This is his third appearance on
the Farm. In his first, as a student,
Taylor was an All-Coast guard, play
ing and lettering three years.

He spent World War II as a Lieu
tenant in the Navy, and joined the
professional Miami Seahawks of the
now-defunct All-America Confer
ence.
He returned to Stanford as frosh
coach in #1948, and ran up an un
beaten string of 15 games with the
Papooses. In 1950, he joined Buck
Shaw and the San Francisco 49ers
as an assistant coach, returning to
the Farm the following year to re
place Marchie Schwartz at the
helm.
DUTCH FEHRING
Line Coach Dutch Fehring has an
uncanny ability to diagnose oppon
ents' weaknesses, and as head scout
makes the most of it. He came to
Stanford in 1948.
As an undergrad at Purdue, he
won nine letters in basketball, base
ball, and football. He was All-
America in the latter sport. His
senior year he was named the out
standing scholar-athlete at Midwest
ern University.
After his graduation, Fehring
stayed with the Boilermakers for ten
years as an assistant coach, going
to lowa Pre-flight in 1946, and then
for two years to Oklahoma.
.JOE RUETZ
The other line coach, Joe Ruetz,
has had an equally successful career.
He was an Ail-American at Notre
Dame, as well as being named to the
All-Service team when he played at
St. Mary's Pre-flight during part of
the war.
Ruetz served the rest of the war
as a carrier pilot in the South Pa
cific. He returned to the football
wars with the Chicago Rockets of
the All-America league. During this
time he attended the University of
Chicago, where he attained Masters
decree in anthropology.
Prior to his appointment at Stan
ford, Ruutz served as head coach at
St. Mary's. The Gaels were forced
to drop the game in 1950.
GEORGE LYNN
George Lynn, the handsome back
field coach, has had his share of suc
cess. He captained and quarter
backed Ohio State to the National
Championship in 1942. Before com
ing to the Farm, he coached at Ohio
State, Kent State, and Oklahoma. He
and Fehring do most of Stanford's
scouting.
PETE KMETOVIC
Pete Kmetovic, the other backfield
coach, has also had winning way#.
He led the 1940 Indian team to vic
tory over Nebraska in the 1940 Rose
Bowl game.

In addition to his football duties
fall quarter, Kmetovic coaches rug
by. Under his direction, the British
sport has attained a high degree of
popularity at Stanford.
Bob Ghilotti is freshman coach.
He played end at Stanford .during
the 1947 and 1948 season, after trans
ferring from Modesto J.C., where he
was one of their greatest all-around
athletes.
Brave Coach Mai Elward has an
undefeated team this year. He played
end at Notre Dame in the days o' |
Knut: 1 Rockne. Later, he became j
head football coach and athletic di- ,
rector at Purdue, retaining this po- j
sition until World War 11.
