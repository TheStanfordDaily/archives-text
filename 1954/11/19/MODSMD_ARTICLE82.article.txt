# Pappy Waldorf and Staff Made Bears Into PCC Powerhouse
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
From conference goat to gridiron
great in one short year. That was
the story of the Golden Bear in 1947.
And that was the Far West's intro
duction to Lynn Waldorf.
Pappy Waldorf began coaching in
192G. Until 1935 he was in the Mid
west, guiding Oklahoma to four
Missouri Valley Conference titles,
and Kansas State to a Big Six crown.
He became head coach at North
western, where he stayed until 1947.
In his tenure at Northwestern, he
directed the Wildcats to a 49-45-7
record in the tough Big Ten Con
ference. This was Waldorf in 1947.
And in 1947 Cal was a team with a
humiliating 2-7 record fi om the year
before.
Waldorf set about simplifying the
complex Bear offense. He worked it
down to a pure power offense with
hard-running backs behind a hard
hitting line.
WALDORF ORGANIZER
To this, Waldorf added his gift
for organization. He took a team
which had not had a winning season
since 1938 and remofeled it. He im
ported a coaching staff, to as

| sist him. |
And he got results. With practi
cally *the same team as the year be- |
lore he wound up with a 9-1 record
in his first season. In the next three
years the Golden Bears, no longer
the tarnished Bears of old, won
three PCC titles while winning 29
games, losing three (all Kose Bowl
tilts), and tying one.
From 1947 to 1953, Waldorf posted
a 57-13-3 record at Berkeley. He
turned out such stars as Jackie Jen
sen, Jack Swaner, Jim Monachino,
Pistol Pete Schabarum, Don John
son, Lee Richter, and Paul Larson.
Much of the credit for Waldorf's
success must go to his coaching staff.
Pappy brought backfield coach Wes
Fry with him from Northwes<ern.
Fry deserves a large share of credit
j for developing the blasting, backs i
Cal has become famous for. An ad
vocate of rugged backfield blocking |
: and machine-like precision, Fry is J
j justly prOud of his most famousj
pupil. Otto Graham of the Cleveland
; Browns.
LINE COACH
Herm Meister, the line coach, is in
his fourth year at Cal. A local boy,
Meister was All-Coast tackle for the
St. Mary's team he captained in
j 1935. With Len Casanova, Meister is
responsible for turning out the'

great Santa Clara lines in 15)48-49.
Zeb Chaney, former three-sjiort
star at Southwestern Louisiana* Co
llege, has been on the Waldorf staff
since 194(5. He serves as general jus
sistant coach.
The newest addition to the Cal
staff is Rambler coach Jim Suther
land. Sutherland iilled the vacancy
left by "Eggs" Manske's break
the Waldorf regime. Manske, by .the
way, has become Waldorf's severest
critic in the past two disappointing
Bear seasons.
Harold Grant and Clarence (Nibs)
Price complete the Cal staff.
former Redondo High School co£ch,
has been Cal frosh coach since 1N47,
while Price is chief scout.

Much of the credit for Waldorf's
success must go to his coaching staff.

From conference goat to gridiron
great in one short year. That was
the story of the Golden Bear in 1947.
And that was the Far West's intro
duction to Lynn Waldorf.
Pappy Waldorf began coaching in
192G. Until 1935 he was in the Mid
west, guiding Oklahoma to four
Missouri Valley Conference titles,
and Kansas State to a Big Six crown.
He became head coach at North
western, where he stayed until 1947.
In his tenure at Northwestern, he
directed the Wildcats to a 49-45-7
record in the tough Big Ten Con
ference. This was Waldorf in 1947.
And in 1947 Cal was a team with a
humiliating 2-7 record fi om the year
before.
Waldorf set about simplifying the
complex Bear offense. He worked it
down to a pure power offense with
hard-running backs behind a hard
hitting line.
WALDORF ORGANIZER
To this, Waldorf added his gift
for organization. He took a team
which had not had a winning season
since 1938 and remofeled it. He im
ported a coaching staff, to as

| sist him. |
And he got results. With practi
cally *the same team as the year be- |
lore he wound up with a 9-1 record
in his first season. In the next three
years the Golden Bears, no longer
the tarnished Bears of old, won
three PCC titles while winning 29
games, losing three (all Kose Bowl
tilts), and tying one.
