| fficial mascot, during the rally of
Big Game in 11)51. Impressed with
the school spirit and good sports
manship expressed hy the student
body, Lightfoot offered to be at the
school's disposal in the future.
Lightfoot did not hear from Stan
ford again until 1952 when Rally
Com asked him to participate in
the rally prec. din", the opening, foot
ball game of the season. Alter the
rally, the students wanted more of
Prince Lightfoot and in the years
that followed he attended all tin#
games, even traveling with the team.
During the game, in his authentic
sell-made costume, Lightfoot per
forms tribal dances symbolizing
swiftness and power. While the alma
mater is played he performs his final
dance, a prayer for endurance. In
order to improve his dancing Light
foot still attends Indian ceremonials
during the year.
LIGHTFOOT PURE INDIAN
A pure Indian, Prince Lightfoot
is a member of the Yurok tribe of
the Klamath area in northern Cali
fornia. Living with his tribe until
he was 20, he then left to attend the
University of San Francisco. Prince
Lightfoot, alias Timm Williams,
now lives in Kentfield and works as j
a receiving clerk for the Mission
Terminals company.
Thirty years old, the prince was
born in Klamath, California.
Prince Lightfoot enjoys hunting,
and even trapped the mink and er
mine whose tails ring the leather
costume. Each design on the cos- (
tume has a symbolic meaning. |
Double arrows mean good luck, and !
broken arrows peace, for example.
The story of the prince's family is
like a chapter of Califor/iia history. I
When while soldiers first came to
Ihe Yurok country, his great-grand
father killed six of them with a bow
and arrow. The two jsides finally
made peace, however, and the
prince's ancestor become a guide for
the explorers.
TRIBES BAND TOGETHER
The tribal organization to which
the prince belongs includes several j
other peoples who have banded to- !
gether with the Yuroks.
Lightfoot admires the way. win or
lose, Stanford cheers the team and i
its coach. The Prince's only pay is
the enjoyment he leels from taking
part in Stanford games.
So now in 1954, as in 1951, Prince
Lightfoot would say of the approach
ing game "with God's blessings and
a little luck we'll win."


"HAIL, STANFORD"—Prince Lightfoot has served as the Stan
ford mascot since the Big Game rally in 1951. His only pay
ment is "the enjoyment I get from taking part in the Stanford
games. Lightfoot, whose real name is Timm Williams, says his
interest in Stanford came as a result of his admiration for the
spirit of sportsmanship and friendship of the students.


"COME AND GET IT"—Oski, the California mascot, shows off
his most prized possession, the Stanford Axe, which he has held
since 1947 when Stanford began a series of seven Big Game
losses. Oski is actually a committee of 10 men, each of whom
performs at different times. No one knows which of the 10 is
Oski at any particular moment.

Thirty years old, the prince was

Lightfoot would say of the approach
ing game "with God's blessings and
a little luck we'll win."
