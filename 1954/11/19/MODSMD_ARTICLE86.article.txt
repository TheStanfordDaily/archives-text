# Pudgy Bear Is Frisky Cal Mascot
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
See that pudgy little guy
lown there on the field? The
Dne in baggy blue pants and
he yellow block sweater ca
'orting all over the turf and up
\nd down the goal posts?
Well, for all those who have never
:een Cal's beloved little mascot,
'hat's Oski. He amuses Cal football
fans with his pre-game and half
time antics which range anywhere
from scampering up the nearest goal
post and waving his blue and gold
pompom at the crowd, to carting ofT
the other team's campus queen.
Tales of the little bear's capers are
spread far and wide. They tell of
the time he and some of his asso
ciates formed a "little people's band"
on the Los Angeles Coliseum field,
much to the consternation of the
Southern California band which was
attempting the execution of a very
serious number. All the photog
raphers rushed over to the off-key
Lilliputian band, completely disre
garding USC's. In the words of one
of the Oski's, the SC band was
"quite shook up."
OSKI IS (JKOUP
Oski is not one person, but one of
a group of 10 men, comprising the
so-called "Oski Committee." The
men are known on the campus; they
wear block sweater*; with a big
"Oski" on the pocket.
The mystery involved is that no
one knows which Oski is on the field
at any particular moment. There is
even a separate one during the pre
game activities and at half-time.
The Oski's, chosen by interview,
must be under five feet, five inches
tall and must possess some athletic
ability, mainly in the fields of
tumbling, pole-climbing, and gen
eral gymnastic agility.
All the Oski's develop a standard
yell and similar manner of doing
their tricks so that no difference will
be noted from game to game. Tra
ditionally, Oski is passed down the
men's rooting section during.the first
game of the season—on a stretcher.
He used to be handed down on a
ladder, but the poor little guy got
too many cigarette burns through
the rungs of the ladder.
HEAVY COSTUME
This year's Oski chairman, Norm
Rubey, recalled that he has lost up
to eight pounds in 10 minutes
worth of antics in one game because
of the weight of his head and the
tremendous warmth of his bulky
clothes.
His head weighs over six pounds
and his figure is expanded by a huge
wire frame over which are draped
his blue pants and block sweater.
Rubey also recalled the time a
few years ago when it was an
nounced that Cal would go to the
Rose Bowl and a few Oski's and
several Cal band members formed a
parade and marched through a few
of Cal's lecture classes. Students
followed after them, Pied Piper
like, and paraded loudly up and
down the Berkeley streets.
Life as an Oski isn't all football
games. He is in constant demand
for alumni dinners and university
sponsored banquets.

the other team's campus queen.
Tales of the little bear's capers are
spread far and wide. They tell of
the time he and some of his asso
ciates formed a "little people's band"
on the Los Angeles Coliseum field,
much to the consternation of the
Southern California band which was
attempting the execution of a very
serious number. All the photog
raphers rushed over to the off-key
Lilliputian band, completely disre
garding USC's. In the words of one
of the Oski's, the SC band was
"quite shook up."
OSKI IS (JKOUP
Oski is not one person, but one of
a group of 10 men, comprising the
so-called "Oski Committee." The
men are known on the campus; they
wear block sweater*; with a big
"Oski" on the pocket.
The mystery involved is that no
one knows which Oski is on the field
at any particular moment. There is
even a separate one during the pre
game activities and at half-time.
The Oski's, chosen by interview,
must be under five feet, five inches
tall and must possess some athletic
ability, mainly in the fields of
tumbling, pole-climbing, and gen
eral gymnastic agility.
All the Oski's develop a standard
yell and similar manner of doing
their tricks so that no difference will
be noted from game to game. Tra
ditionally, Oski is passed down the
men's rooting section during.the first
game of the season—on a stretcher.
He used to be handed down on a
ladder, but the poor little guy got
too many cigarette burns through
the rungs of the ladder.
HEAVY COSTUME
This year's Oski chairman, Norm
Rubey, recalled that he has lost up
to eight pounds in 10 minutes
worth of antics in one game because
of the weight of his head and the
tremendous warmth of his bulky
clothes.
His head weighs over six pounds
and his figure is expanded by a huge
wire frame over which are draped
his blue pants and block sweater.
Rubey also recalled the time a
few years ago when it was an
nounced that Cal would go to the
Rose Bowl and a few Oski's and
several Cal band members formed a
parade and marched through a few
of Cal's lecture classes. Students
followed after them, Pied Piper
like, and paraded loudly up and
down the Berkeley streets.
Life as an Oski isn't all football
games. He is in constant demand
for alumni dinners and university
sponsored banquets.
See that pudgy little guy
lown there on the field? The
Dne in baggy blue pants and
he yellow block sweater ca
'orting all over the turf and up
\nd down the goal posts?
Well, for all those who have never
:een Cal's beloved little mascot,
'hat's Oski. He amuses Cal football
fans with his pre-game and half
time antics which range anywhere
from scampering up the nearest goal
post and waving his blue and gold
pompom at the crowd, to carting ofT
the other team's campus queen.
