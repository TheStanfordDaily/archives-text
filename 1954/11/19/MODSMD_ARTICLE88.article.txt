CAL CROSSROADS —Sather Gate is the crossroads of the Cai campus, and is renowned as a
gathering spot for student political rallies. According to the Daily Californian, however, the
spot's popularity is somewhat on the decline. I the background are several campus buildings.
Tho ASUC has extensive plans for a student union to be built in the lot across the street from
Sather Gate (not visible). The lot is now occupied by several bus'ness establishments, mainly
coffr.e shops at which the students gather between classes. Action is expected to be taken before
Janucry, since the ASUC option on the proposed site expires at ihat time. Since the union v/ouid
cost several million dollars, the problem is largely a financial one. Should the union be built,
however, Salher Gate should have its position as the campus crossroads assured.


CAMPUS LANDMARK—Campanile, towering 281 feet above
the California campus, is four feet shorter than Stanford's Hoover
Tower. Although when built the granite structure was expected
to remain intact for "several thousand years," there is now a
danger of the granite blocks falling from the sides of the tower.

CAL CROSSROADS —Sather Gate is the crossroads of the Cai campus, and is renowned as a
gathering spot for student political rallies. According to the Daily Californian, however, the
spot's popularity is somewhat on the decline. I the background are several campus buildings.
Tho ASUC has extensive plans for a student union to be built in the lot across the street from
Sather Gate (not visible). The lot is now occupied by several bus'ness establishments, mainly
coffr.e shops at which the students gather between classes. Action is expected to be taken before
Janucry, since the ASUC option on the proposed site expires at ihat time. Since the union v/ouid
cost several million dollars, the problem is largely a financial one. Should the union be built,
however, Salher Gate should have its position as the campus crossroads assured.


CAMPUS LANDMARK—Campanile, towering 281 feet above
the California campus, is four feet shorter than Stanford's Hoover
Tower. Although when built the granite structure was expected
to remain intact for "several thousand years," there is now a
danger of the granite blocks falling from the sides of the tower.

CAL CROSSROADS —Sather Gate is the crossroads of the Cai campus, and is renowned as a
gathering spot for student political rallies. According to the Daily Californian, however, the
spot's popularity is somewhat on the decline. I the background are several campus buildings.
Tho ASUC has extensive plans for a student union to be built in the lot across the street from
Sather Gate (not visible). The lot is now occupied by several bus'ness establishments, mainly
coffr.e shops at which the students gather between classes. Action is expected to be taken before
Janucry, since the ASUC option on the proposed site expires at ihat time. Since the union v/ouid
cost several million dollars, the problem is largely a financial one. Should the union be built,
however, Salher Gate should have its position as the campus crossroads assured.
