SMALL-SIZED PYREâ€”Cal also has a bonfire that blazes at the
Big Game Rally, but on a much smaller scale. The fire is built
in the middle of the Greek Amphitheater, a reproduction of an
Athenian amphitheater. The rally will be held tonight at 8, with
Ralph Edwards as emcee. Cal's new pompon girls will make
their first appearance; Cal finally decided to have pompon
girls after a year-long debate.
