# CENSURE DEBATE
## Joe Accused Of Injury 'Filibuster' 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21 (UP)
Senator J. William Fulbright
(D-Ark.) said today that he has
"grave suspicions" that Senator
McCarthy, by his elbow injury,
is engaging in a filibuster to
prevent a Senate censure vote.
"It is not the first time he has
gone to the hospital when he is in
an embarrassing position," Fulbright
said in a CBS "Face the Nation'" i
television interview. "I can't believe
the illness is quite as serious as we
have been led to believe,"
Fulbright was asked if he lacked
confidence "in the integrity" of Dr.
George Calver, Capitol physician
who advised the Senate on the na
ture and seriousness of McCarthy's
illness.
Fulbright replied that he does not. |
IJe* said Calver did not examine j
McCarthy, but merely talked to the I
Senator and to doctors at the Be- j
thesda Medical Center.
"It is an old custom at Bethcsda," j
he said, "that Senators and Con
gressmen make their own diagno- !
sis."
The Bethcsda, Md., Naval Hospital I
.said today McCarthy's condition was
"good" but there was no indication j
when he could be released. McCar- j
thy hurt the elbow during a hand- j
shaking incident in Milwaukee a j
week ago.
At the same time, Senator Francis
Case declared the first censure
count against Senator McCarthy '
",-hould stand" unless McCarthy j
justifies his alleged contempt of the
Senate or apologizes.
Case, a member of the six-man I
committee which recommended that
the Senate rebuke the Wisconsin
republican, said,, however, that
"many Senators" want further light
lied on the second count, involving
Brig. Gen. Ralph W. Zwickcr.
He said that in view of McCarthy's
"unfortunate illness' and hospitali
zation, "I just don't know" whether
the Senate can vote on the censure
issue before the Dec. 24 deadline.
Case already lias reversed himself
on the second censure count, which
accuses McCarthy of "internperatcly
abusing" Zwickcr while questioning !
him about the case of former Major j
Irviti Pcrcss, New York dentist la- I
belcd 'by McCarthy as a "Fifth j
Amendment Communist."
