LONDON, Nov. 21 (UP) — The
United States, Britain, and France

rejection of any European security
conference for the time being.

job was alm'or.t complete.
Responsible sources reported that
the West would leave open the pos
sibility of a Big Four meeting after
the ratification of the Paris treaties
on West German rearmament. But
they believed that even then the
conference would be at the U-vel of
foreign ministers, rather than chiefs
of state.

conference he originally wanted on
Nov. 20 if the West would put ofT

"In a way, Molotov's offer shows
that the Russians have been cor

led to agreement on the Paris ac
cords," a London spokesman said.
"Molotov is trying to punch his way
out."
