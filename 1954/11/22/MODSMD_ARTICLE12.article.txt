# Cards Look Good in Big Game Defeat; Bears 'Just Too Much' for Stanford
## Indians Bottle Up Larson But Cal Triumphs, 28-20 
### DON WEBSTER Sports Editor, The Daily 
"I thought wc did a good job of bottling up Paul Larson, l«ut
Drew, Hazeltine and the others were just too much for us."
The statistics and the crowd agreed with Stanford Coach Chuck
Taylor that his team looked good in their 28-20 defeat at the hands
of California. For a change, they did not lose because they weren't
trying hard; they lost because they were not the best team.
All last week the Cards had been making big plans for the
game. The coaching staff had introduced several innovations to
surprise the Bears.
One of these was what is called the "blow." It is a defensive
formation that has all the linemen and linebackers rushing, whirh
put a lot of pressure on guarterback Larson.
Pitchin' Paul had his poorest day of the season. His rushing
total was minus 40 yards. On seven occasions he was thrown
behind the line, and only a penalty and his fumble kept his aver
age from being even worse. Through the air, he completed 14 out

| of 22 for 150 yards—good, but
nevertheless below his average
Though the "blow" was ef
fective in stopping Larson, it hod
its disadvantages. Short passer,
worked consistently, and th<--
"stutter" handoff was also effective
without a heavy secondary.
One of several offensive innov;i
tions backfired for the Cards. "All
week we practiced that play where
Tarr takes the pitchout and passe
the ball. It worked well, and Tan
really ■ looked good on it," Taylot
said.
Stanford tried the play twice
Both times, Tarr threw a wobbly
pass, one for an interception, onr
for a near-interception.
POOREST MARK
The contest gave the Cards a 1 K
record for 1954, the poorest mark
for Taylor in his four years as heail
coach. "I'm looking forward to nex ■
season, though, for I believe we hav
the potential of a very fine team,"
he said.
"Our players, particularly the
quarterbacks, have gained a lot of
experience this year. We're lobing
only three players of major impot
tance — tackle Win Wedge, center
Jerry Goldberg, and tackle John I<u
deke. What's more, we will get m •
terial from an outstanding fro ,h
team."
The Bears dominated the first half
of the game. At one point they 1 1
by a 28-0 count. But in the second
half Stanford came roaring back to
score all their tallies. However, thn
touchdowns were too little and ton
late.
CARDS START FAST
If a first-quarter drive by Stan
! ford hadn't bogged down, the out
! come might have been diffei -en'
1 The Cards took over on their own 11
and drove in eight plays to the Be m
18. Then halfback John Ncff fuin
bled a handoff and Cal recovered
The teams were as close togetbei
statistically as they were on tlv
scoreboard. The 81,490 fans who at
tended got their money's worth,
what with the fast Card finish.
It was the eighth Big Game with
out a loss for Pappy Waldorf. Cali
fornia has now taken over the lead
in the series for the first time with
24 wins, 23 losses, and 10 ties.
DECIDING FACTORS
Generally, these were the thin?
that spelled defeat for the Indians:
1. Their ability to move on tlv
gridiron but inability, particularly
in the first half, to put on a sustain!
scoring drive.
2. The running of fullback Jen y
Drew. He did not start the game
because of weakness on defeti ■


BREAKING THROUGH —Stanford halfback Gordy Young breaks
free of Sammy Williams' grasp as he races 34 yards for a touch
down in the third quarter of the 57th annual Big Game Saturday.
Coming up in an attempt to catch sophomore Young are center
Matt Hazeltine (54) and halfback Hal Norris (38). The play gave
the Cards the first of their three second half scores. Stanford

spotted the Bears 28 points in the first part of the game, and then
made a desperate (though unsuccessful) attempt to catch them.
The 28 20 final score gave Cal their fifth win of the year against
an equal number of defeats. Stanford finished with a 4-6 mark,
the poorest record in the four years Chuck Taylor has been head
coach. —Photo courtesy of San Francisco Chronicle.

him, while Hal Norris (behind Gustafson) and Matt Hazeltine
ccmo in to make the tackle. This and similar gains netted 158
yards on the ground for the Cards, but they weren't enough to
save the game. —Daily photo by John Luetscher
