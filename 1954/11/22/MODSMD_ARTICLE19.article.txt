# Big Game, '54: Crowds, Color ... all Familiar
## 
### PAT KING Editor, The Daily 
It was all so familiar.
All morning streams of cars
turned every back road "short
cut" <nto a snail-paced freeway
! to Strawberry Canyon.
Bright - eyed alums jostled
their way up the hill past Sather
Gate, swapping tales of "I re
member when."
Rooters clutching pom-poms and
programs poured through the gates
and up the stairs, brushing past, men
hawking "two tickets on the 50-yard
line."
And then they pushed their way
out into the warm November sun
light, where they flooded the stands
with vivid crimson and blue and
gold.
It was all so familiar. Cal's taunts
of "We've got the Axe" and Stan
ford's hopeful reply, "This is the
year."
A spectator who unwittingly tried
to pass in front of the Golden Bear
rooting section was confronted with
shouts of "Take ofT that red dress,"
and on the Stanford side the ever
present pack of "little boys" yelled
into the microphonc and ran off with
red feathers.
POM-POM GIRLS
The pom-pom girls bobbed up and
down in front of the stands, while
out on the field the Cal .drum major
literally bent over backward to in
sure victory for the Blue and Gold.
The Star Spangled Banner, shhh
hoom for the kickoff, and the game
was on. And once again history
seemed determined to repeat itself.
The first wild Stanford roars
turned to groans of dismay as Lar
son and Company poured through
the Big Red Machine. By half-time
there was a bored resignation to the
inevitable, broken only by cheers
when Oski was thrown for almost
the full count by some disgruntled
Indian supporters.
SECOND HALF . . .
Then came the second half.
No longer did perspiring gremlin
ver.ders out-yell the Farm contin
gent, when the first Stanford touch
down precipitated a roar loud
enough to drown out the jets whiz
zing overhead.
But that was a mere whisper com
pared with the pandemonium which
engulfed half the stadium when four
attempts from the one - yard line
made it "Stanford 13" on the big
scoreboard.
Then came the third touchdown,
and deliriously jubilant Sons and
Daughters of (lie Stanford Red
boomed forth with the loudest Axe
Yell ever.
And there it stopped, with heart
breaking familiarity. Great, spirit. A
moral victory. But no Axe.
A subdued Stanford defiantly sang
"The Dirty Golden Bear." With the
well-known lines, "So down with
California, the Golden Bear has won
his last," they closed the Big Game
for 1054.

"The Dirty Golden Bear." With the
well-known lines, "So down with
California, the Golden Bear has won
his last," they closed the Big Game
for 1054.
It was all so familiar.
All morning streams of cars
turned every back road "short
cut" <nto a snail-paced freeway
! to Strawberry Canyon.
Bright - eyed alums jostled
their way up the hill past Sather
Gate, swapping tales of "I re
member when."
Rooters clutching pom-poms and
programs poured through the gates
and up the stairs, brushing past, men
hawking "two tickets on the 50-yard
line."
And then they pushed their way
out into the warm November sun
light, where they flooded the stands
with vivid crimson and blue and
gold.
It was all so familiar. Cal's taunts
of "We've got the Axe" and Stan
ford's hopeful reply, "This is the
year."
A spectator who unwittingly tried
to pass in front of the Golden Bear
rooting section was confronted with
shouts of "Take ofT that red dress,"
and on the Stanford side the ever
present pack of "little boys" yelled
into the microphonc and ran off with
red feathers.
POM-POM GIRLS
The pom-pom girls bobbed up and
down in front of the stands, while
out on the field the Cal .drum major
literally bent over backward to in
sure victory for the Blue and Gold.
The Star Spangled Banner, shhh
hoom for the kickoff, and the game
was on. And once again history
seemed determined to repeat itself.
The first wild Stanford roars
turned to groans of dismay as Lar
son and Company poured through
the Big Red Machine. By half-time
there was a bored resignation to the
inevitable, broken only by cheers
when Oski was thrown for almost
the full count by some disgruntled
Indian supporters.
SECOND HALF . . .
Then came the second half.
No longer did perspiring gremlin
ver.ders out-yell the Farm contin
gent, when the first Stanford touch
down precipitated a roar loud
enough to drown out the jets whiz
zing overhead.
But that was a mere whisper com
pared with the pandemonium which
engulfed half the stadium when four
attempts from the one - yard line
made it "Stanford 13" on the big
scoreboard.
Then came the third touchdown,
and deliriously jubilant Sons and
Daughters of (lie Stanford Red
boomed forth with the loudest Axe
Yell ever.
And there it stopped, with heart
breaking familiarity. Great, spirit. A
moral victory. But no Axe.
A subdued Stanford defiantly sang
"The Dirty Golden Bear." With the
well-known lines, "So down with
California, the Golden Bear has won
his last," they closed the Big Game
for 1054.
