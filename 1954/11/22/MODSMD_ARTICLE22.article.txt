# The 						Price Is Too High
## 
### 
An eye injury, a split nose, many severe
bumps and bruises—if that's the price to pay
lor having card stunts and card throwing at
football games, we think the price is too high.
This isn't the first year students have been
seriously injured. At Big Game two years ago
one Stanford woman was knocked uncon
scious by a flying card and suffered from a
brain concussion for several weeks. Other stu
dents received less serious head and face cuts
and bumps.
Little children aren't allowed to play with
dangerous objects until they're old enough to
avoid hurting themselves. Perhaps the analogy
is an insult to the Stanford Student, but when
we see supposedly mature and intelligent stu

dents throwing cards after every game and
causing serious injuries to themselves and to
their friends, we wonder.
We see two solutions. The first solution,
which we prefer, is difficult—convince the stu
dents who gleefully toss the colorful cards that
some day the cards may seriously injure them.
The card stunts are a beautiful addition to
the half-time activities at the games. We would
haie to see abolition of the card stunts. But
if the first solution fails, only this alternative
remains.
The threat of losing an eye or suffering from
a brain concussion is not an idle one—it has
happened, and it will happen again if the
students themselves do not prevent it.
