## How Much Intelligence? 
### 
To the Editor:
Stanford students are Supposed to be a select group
of high mentality, but I wonder how much intelligence
those students have who have insisted on throwing
the flash cards around after the half-time card stunts
of each football game.
This practice is only meant in fun, but it must cer
tainly occur to each rooter that one of these cards can
do considerable damage on striking someone else in
the face, and especially in the eye. Perhaps these
thoughtless rooters can learn only by experience.

O
If so, the incident which occurred at the Big Game
should serve this purpose. Someone was struck in the
eye. and whether or not this person loses her eye
sight ; n that eye, it is obvious she could very easily
have been blinded.
There will be 110 more card stunts this year, but
perhaps if rooters could be reminded, before the next
football season, of the hazard which card-throwing
presents, this danger can be curbed and someone's
eyesight can be Saved,
