# On American 'Culture'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In re Dr. Stegner's interesting piece in The l>aily
recently.
One sentence caught my eye with special force. The
one to the effect that "the Danes are aware, as are
most Europeans, that America has no real culture."
I don't have the .paper before me, but hope the quo
tation is accurate.
It depends, of course, on what the good doctor
means. If he means that America has no separate cul
ture in the sense that there is a Western European,
Asiatic, Russian, or Slavic culture, he is, to a large
extent, right.
If, however, he refers to the arts, etc., he couldn't bo
more wrong. The good doctor is undoubtedly vastly
my superior l in wisdom and knowledge, but on this. I

feel very strongly that he is mistaken.
Today the greatest symphony in the world is the
NBC Symphony. The Met is certainly in the same
class with La Scala and Vienna. American literature
is beginning to really flow. The American theater is
on a par with that of the rest of'the world.
Not only this, but there is a tremendous grass roots
movement. A small town like Grays Harbor, Wash
ington, has a semi-professional symphony. Vancouver,
Washington. (50,000) has a good civic theater. And
so on, until European artists that I have talked with
ate amazed.
Heaven knows (his country is far from perfect,
culturally 01 otherwise but it does stand high and!
we should recognize it.
