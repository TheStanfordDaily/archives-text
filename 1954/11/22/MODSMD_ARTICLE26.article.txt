# Greek Student Lauds U.S. Economic Scene
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
"I am indeed a very fortunate foreigner."
Evangelos (Aki) Calametsis, ASSU Foreign Student from
Greece, glad to have seen much of the United States before his
arrival at Stanford this fall, now believes that "this country is
blessed by all the forces of nature out of which are cieated the

great agricultural and industrial na
tion on which the whole world de
pends."
"I was very impressed," the 21-
year-old Greek added, "by the high
value placed on labor here in this
country. In Greece it is highly val
ued too, and laborers are well paid
in respect to the whole economy."
"Nevertheless," he a d m i 11 e d ,
"Greece is still one of the poorest
nations in Europe because of the
tremendous gap between foreign
| imports and investment, and Greek
I exports.
"Many American dollars have
! been poured into Greece, and, to a
I great extent, they were |jooi ly in
vested by past Greek governments."
He was quick to add, though, that
General Papagos, elected prime min
ister in 1952, has created a sort of
"economic renaissance" in Greece,
first reorganizing the electoral laws
which used to allow a new govern
ment every few months, and then
launching a move toward economic
stability.
As a part of the program, a na
: tional loan was collected recently
I from the people to substitute for
I foreign aid, and this venture proved
! highly successful, according to Ca
lametsis.
The young foreign student, though
from Greece?, has been living in
Egypt during the last few years and
graduated in economics from the
American University at Cairo, serv
| ing as president of the student £ouri
! cil in his senior year. He is seeking
a Master's degree in economics at
Stanford.
"The American University at Cai
ro," he said, "is composed of 400
j students of 2G nationalities. Each
I individual tuition is matched i;i
j double by the United States."
Turning again to Greece, Cala
j metsis recalled the civil war of 194G
' 49 which engulfed Greece with a
! destruction from which she has not
yet fully recovered.
"The Communist party of Greece,"
he said, "refused to put down their
arms after the war and tried to es
tablish a 'free Greece' by force. As
guerrillas, they swooped down into
towns and took thousands of chil-
I dren to their mountain hideouts,
j There were never, more than 40,000
j of them, but because of the moun
tainous terrain and the fact that
! they could escape to Bulgaria, Al-
S bania, and Yugoslavia on the bor
| ders, they remained undefeated for
I four bitter years.
"Helations with Yugoslavia were
not good until Tito broke with Sta
| lin and since then the official gov
ernments have been friendly and
many of the children taken off' to
! Yugoslavia have been returned."
To the question of Cyprus and the
| widely heard cry of "Enosis" with
j Greece, Calametsis answered that
"historically Cyprus has never been
Greek territory, but the population
is 80 per cent Greek. For a long
time it was hoped that the United

Kingdom would release Cyprus to
Greece since an election on the is
land showed the people wanted
unity. '
Britain claims it is an internal
affair, within the Commonwealth
and Greece maintains it should go
before the United Nations*
"The clash," he said, "is not be
tween Greece and Great Britain, but
Greece and the traditionally con
servative British Foreign Office.
Greece ha i constantly tried for
agreement, but has constantly been
refused."
"Greece's attitude toward the
United States is very favorable," he
remarked, "and the people are
grateful for all the economic aid
that they have received. It is indeed
unfortunate that it was not all used
to its best advantage."
"Greeks are endowed with a feel
ing of adventure," he said with a
patriotic twinkle in his eye. "tn
Egypt there are some areas in which
no foreigner would go, but you
would find a Greek community. It
is no doubt that they have contrib
uted economic welfare to many na
tions, and culture to all."

Turning again to Greece, Cala

' 49 which engulfed Greece with a
! destruction from which she has not
yet fully recovered.
"The Communist party of Greece,"
he said, "refused to put down their

"Helations with Yugoslavia were

To the question of Cyprus and the

j Greece, Calametsis answered that
"historically Cyprus has never been
Greek territory, but the population
is 80 per cent Greek. For a long
time it was hoped that the United

Kingdom would release Cyprus to
Greece since an election on the is
land showed the people wanted
unity. '
Britain claims it is an internal
affair, within the Commonwealth
and Greece maintains it should go
before the United Nations*
"The clash," he said, "is not be
tween Greece and Great Britain, but
Greece and the traditionally con
servative British Foreign Office.
Greece ha i constantly tried for
agreement, but has constantly been
refused."
"Greece's attitude toward the
United States is very favorable," he
remarked, "and the people are
grateful for all the economic aid
that they have received. It is indeed
unfortunate that it was not all used
to its best advantage."
"Greeks are endowed with a feel
ing of adventure," he said with a
patriotic twinkle in his eye. "tn
Egypt there are some areas in which
no foreigner would go, but you
would find a Greek community. It
is no doubt that they have contrib
uted economic welfare to many na
tions, and culture to all."
"I am indeed a very fortunate foreigner."
Evangelos (Aki) Calametsis, ASSU Foreign Student from
Greece, glad to have seen much of the United States before his
arrival at Stanford this fall, now believes that "this country is
blessed by all the forces of nature out of which are cieated the

great agricultural and industrial na
tion on which the whole world de
pends."
"I was very impressed," the 21-
year-old Greek added, "by the high
value placed on labor here in this
country. In Greece it is highly val
ued too, and laborers are well paid
in respect to the whole economy."
"Nevertheless," he a d m i 11 e d ,
"Greece is still one of the poorest
nations in Europe because of the
tremendous gap between foreign

I exports.
"Many American dollars have

He was quick to add, though, that
General Papagos, elected prime min

"economic renaissance" in Greece,
first reorganizing the electoral laws
which used to allow a new govern
ment every few months, and then
launching a move toward economic
