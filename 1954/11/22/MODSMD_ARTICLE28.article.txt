### JAE HUNLEY 
The final curtain came down last
Friday night on the Ham's Head
1954 Big Game Gaieties.
The show, which ran for four
days, was a successful combination
of good music, talent, hard work, and
minor frustrations.
Everything appeared to go
smoothly from the audience's point
of view, but backstage, amongst the
costumes and grease paint, little
troubles developed.
The dance director broke her nose
and developed a swollen ankle joint.
Another dancer fell off a top bunk
onto a chair and countless other
'not too serious" accidents occurred.
Along with all this, mechanical
'iiflicif lies developed. Hopes and
wires got jammed against other
ropes and wires, hampering the low
ering of Mies and giving stage crew
heads new worries.
Parts of costumes disappeared just
before curtain time. Seams ripped
and buttops fell off. Costume crew
workers spent their time searching,
sewing, and helping members of the
cast who had 35 seconds in which to
change into different costumes be
fore going on stage.
The show is over now. Everything
has been put away. Cast and crew
members are beginning to catch up
on sleep and studying . . . and start
ing to think of plans for next year's
.show.
