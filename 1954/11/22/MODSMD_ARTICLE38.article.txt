# Bears Scared By 'Typical' Big Game
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
"This was a typical Big Game;
they just don't come easy at all,"
said Lynn (Pappy) Waldorf with an
obvious sigh of relief in the Cali
! fornia dressing room.
"Stanford refused to give up, in
[ the tradition of the Big Game. I
I would say we played badly for about
j 20 minutes there in the second half,
but it's hard to say that it was all
! our fault, rather than give them the
\ credit," Waldorf added.
Asked to name any standouts for
Stanford, Waldorf said that he
thought that Bill Tarr, Ernie Dorn,
and Gordy Young "all did well."
"So did John Stewart and Win
Wedge," he added.
"In fact," Waldorf stated, "it was
good team effort on both sides. We
better celebrate while we can," he
I continued, "because Stanford has a
young team and will be bolstered by
j a fine crop of young freshmen. Don't
forget our freshman team was beat
-1 en by the Stanford l'rosh, G() to 0.
j I'm plenty worried already about
the 58th Big Game."
Elsewhere in the California dress
ing quarters Bear captain and cen
ter Matt Hazeltine was frankly dis
appointed with Cal's performance.
"It seemed to me we let down a
lot after it got to be 28-0," lie said,
j "We could have won the game a lot
easier." "Of course," he continued,
"I'm not unhappy at the score be
caqse we won. but I was a little
unhappy at that last half."
Far more ecstatic was Jerry Drew,
Cal fullback. Discussing the play
when he completely reversed his
field and rambled 27 yards for a
touchdown, Drew replied:
i "Man, when I got that ball on our
! 342 play all I could see was the
whole Stanford team in front of me
and I figured something must have
gone wrong. So I thought quick and
decided I'd better run the other
way—the thing I knew I was
in the end zone."
When questioned about what he
thought of the Indians, Drew an
swered by saying, "I expected them
to be tough, but when we got ahead
28-0, I thought it would be easy.
■ But at the end they really scared
me."

appointed with Cal's performance.
"It seemed to me we let down a
lot after it got to be 28-0," lie said,
j "We could have won the game a lot
easier." "Of course," he continued,
"I'm not unhappy at the score be
caqse we won. but I was a little
unhappy at that last half."
Far more ecstatic was Jerry Drew,
Cal fullback. Discussing the play
when he completely reversed his
field and rambled 27 yards for a
touchdown, Drew replied:
i "Man, when I got that ball on our
! 342 play all I could see was the
whole Stanford team in front of me
and I figured something must have
gone wrong. So I thought quick and
decided I'd better run the other
way—the thing I knew I was
in the end zone."
When questioned about what he
thought of the Indians, Drew an
swered by saying, "I expected them
to be tough, but when we got ahead
28-0, I thought it would be easy.
■ But at the end they really scared
me."
