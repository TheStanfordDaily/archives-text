## 
### 
The Stanford soccer team lost a
chance for a qualifying spot in the
playoffs for the Northern California
Soccer Association championship
when they dropped a 2 to 0 decision
to California at Berkeley Saturday.
Dennis Trayson, left inside for the
Bears, accounted for both his team's
goals, one on a penalty kick.
Meanwhile, the Indian hooters
were unable to get any of their shots
past Joel Hare, Cal's All-American
goalie.
