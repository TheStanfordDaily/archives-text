maining, the Braves had a 13-12
lead and were again driving toward
the Rambler goal, John Harlin fum
bled on the Cal 18, and Cal fullback
Erie Murray caught the errant pig

one-yard line early in the game, but

and rusty as they played their first
game in three weeks. The Ramblers
looked much the better team, espe
cially in the first half, although this
was not borne out on the .score
board.

of 13 passes for only 24 yards. Via
