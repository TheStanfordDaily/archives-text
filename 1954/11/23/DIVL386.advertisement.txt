DECEMBER AND MAY: ACT II
Synopsis of Act I: A middle-aged English Professor named Phipps
has fallen desperately in love with a rosy-kneed coed named Mc-
Fetridge. Phipps doesn't know how to go about courting Miss
McFetridge, for, after all, he is a professor in the autumn ol' his
life, and she is a coed with rosy knees. Professor Twonkey, who
shares an office with Phipps, proposes the following plan: Phipps
will ask Miss McFetridge to come to his office for a conference late
in the afternoon. He will be urbane and charming and make fright
fully witty remarks about English lit, and Miss McFetridge will
laugh and laugh. After an hour of this high-type hilarity, Phipps
will look at his watch, exclaim at the lateness of the hour, and insist
on driving Miss McFetridge home. On the way home, he will pass a
theatre that shows French movies. They'll see the lViovie, then have
an exquisite French dinner, and Miss McFetridge will be so enchanted
that she cannot but yield to his suit.
So at the beginning of Act 11, we find Phipps in his office awaiting
the arrival of the poor young innocent. His hair is brushed; his
nails are clean; h'e has new leather patches on his elbows. T here is
a knock on the door. He opens it and admits a gorgeous creature with
blue eyes and pink kneecaps.
Phipps: Ah, Miss McFetridge. Come in, my dear. Won't you sit
down? Cigarette?
Miss McF: Ooh, Philip Morris! I think they're marvy, don't you?
Phipps: I do indeed.
Miss McF: Hey, prof, would you mind opening a fresh pack?
Phipps: But I just opened this one a little while ago. It's perfectly
fresh.
Miss McF: I know, prof, but I like to hear the snap when the
pack opens.
ruipps: Very well, my dear.
(He opens a fresh snap-open pack of Philtp Morris. Miss
McFetridge claps he/' hands delightedly when she hears the
snap.)
Miss McF: Hey, that fractures me! Man, I flip when I hear that
crazy snap! Do another one.
Phipps: All right.
(He snaps open another pack of Philip Morris)
Miss McF: (Ecstatically) Isn't that the living, breathing end? Do
two at once.
Phipps: Well, if you insist... .
(He does two at once)
Miss McF: More! More!
Phipps: I'm afraid that's all I have.
Miss McF: Oh . . . Well, what's up, prof? What did you want to
see me about?
Phipps: Oh, nothing in particular. Just wanted to have a little
chat, find out how you're enjoying the Shakespeare lectures.
Miss McF: I don't know, prof. By me Shakespeare is strictly a
square.
Piiipps: Indeed? Well, I must say I find your attitude refreshing.
One is so inclined toward slavish admiration when it comes to the
Bard. People forget that in many quarters Shakespeare is regarded
quite critically. Take, for example, the opinion of Shaw.
Miss McF: Artie?
Phipps: George Bernard...You know, of course, his famous words.
Miss McF: I sure don't, dad.
Phipps: Shaw said he would like to dig up Shakespeare and throw
stones at him.
Miss McF: Did he dig him?
Phipps: No, I don't believe so.
Miss McF: I don't dig him either.
Phipps: (Looking at watch) Good heavens, I had no idea it was
so late. Come, my dear, I'll drive you home.
Miss McF: No, thanks. I always walk home. It's good for the
circulation in your legs. I got the best circulation in my legs of the
whole sophomore class. Ever notice how rosy my knees are?
Phipps: As a matter of fact, yes . . . Look, you sure you don't want
a ride home? There's an excellent French movie on the way.
Miss McP' 1 : Not me, dad. I hate French pictures. The sub-titles
always disappear before I can read 'em. But if you want to go to the
movies, there's a new Tony Curtis picture downtown — a real gut
buster. Tony plays this beggar, see. but he's really a prince only he
doesn't know it on account of his sneaky uncle who switched babies
when Tony got born. Then Tony finds this magic lamp, see, and he
gets into the palace where he meets this crazy girl, only she's
engaged to the fake prince, but then they have this mad sword fight,
and Tony licks about a million guys, and then he finds out he's the
prince and it's real crazy. Wanna go? I've only seen it three or
four times.
Phipps: As a matter of fact, I just remembered a previous en
gagement. Sorry.
Miss McF: That's all right. Thanks for the Philip Morris. 'Bye.
(Exit Miss McFctridge. For a, moment Phipps sits in st it nncd
silence, mopping his brow. Then a smile appears on his face.
He is a happy man again — out of love. Contentedly he lights
up a Philip Morris.)

theatre that shows French movies. They'll see the lViovie, then have
an exquisite French dinner, and Miss McFetridge will be so enchanted
that she cannot but yield to his suit.
So at the beginning of Act 11, we find Phipps in his office awaiting
the arrival of the poor young innocent. His hair is brushed; his
nails are clean; h'e has new leather patches on his elbows. T here is
a knock on the door. He opens it and admits a gorgeous creature with
blue eyes and pink kneecaps.
Phipps: Ah, Miss McFetridge. Come in, my dear. Won't you sit
down? Cigarette?
Miss McF: Ooh, Philip Morris! I think they're marvy, don't you?
Phipps: I do indeed.
Miss McF: Hey, prof, would you mind opening a fresh pack?
Phipps: But I just opened this one a little while ago. It's perfectly
fresh.
Miss McF: I know, prof, but I like to hear the snap when the
pack opens.
ruipps: Very well, my dear.
(He opens a fresh snap-open pack of Philtp Morris. Miss
McFetridge claps he/' hands delightedly when she hears the
snap.)
Miss McF: Hey, that fractures me! Man, I flip when I hear that
crazy snap! Do another one.
Phipps: All right.
(He snaps open another pack of Philip Morris)
Miss McF: (Ecstatically) Isn't that the living, breathing end? Do
two at once.
Phipps: Well, if you insist... .
(He does two at once)
Miss McF: More! More!
Phipps: I'm afraid that's all I have.
Miss McF: Oh . . . Well, what's up, prof? What did you want to
see me about?
Phipps: Oh, nothing in particular. Just wanted to have a little
chat, find out how you're enjoying the Shakespeare lectures.
Miss McF: I don't know, prof. By me Shakespeare is strictly a
square.
Piiipps: Indeed? Well, I must say I find your attitude refreshing.
One is so inclined toward slavish admiration when it comes to the
Bard. People forget that in many quarters Shakespeare is regarded
quite critically. Take, for example, the opinion of Shaw.
Miss McF: Artie?
Phipps: George Bernard...You know, of course, his famous words.
Miss McF: I sure don't, dad.
Phipps: Shaw said he would like to dig up Shakespeare and throw
stones at him.
Miss McF: Did he dig him?
Phipps: No, I don't believe so.
Miss McF: I don't dig him either.
Phipps: (Looking at watch) Good heavens, I had no idea it was
so late. Come, my dear, I'll drive you home.
Miss McF: No, thanks. I always walk home. It's good for the
circulation in your legs. I got the best circulation in my legs of the
whole sophomore class. Ever notice how rosy my knees are?
Phipps: As a matter of fact, yes . . . Look, you sure you don't want
a ride home? There's an excellent French movie on the way.
Miss McP' 1 : Not me, dad. I hate French pictures. The sub-titles
always disappear before I can read 'em. But if you want to go to the
movies, there's a new Tony Curtis picture downtown — a real gut
buster. Tony plays this beggar, see. but he's really a prince only he
doesn't know it on account of his sneaky uncle who switched babies
when Tony got born. Then Tony finds this magic lamp, see, and he
gets into the palace where he meets this crazy girl, only she's
engaged to the fake prince, but then they have this mad sword fight,
and Tony licks about a million guys, and then he finds out he's the
prince and it's real crazy. Wanna go? I've only seen it three or
four times.
Phipps: As a matter of fact, I just remembered a previous en
gagement. Sorry.
Miss McF: That's all right. Thanks for the Philip Morris. 'Bye.
(Exit Miss McFctridge. For a, moment Phipps sits in st it nncd
silence, mopping his brow. Then a smile appears on his face.
He is a happy man again — out of love. Contentedly he lights
up a Philip Morris.)

Synopsis of Act I: A middle-aged English Professor named Phipps

Fetridge. Phipps doesn't know how to go about courting Miss
McFetridge, for, after all, he is a professor in the autumn ol' his

shares an office with Phipps, proposes the following plan: Phipps
will ask Miss McFetridge to come to his office for a conference late
in the afternoon. He will be urbane and charming and make fright
fully witty remarks about English lit, and Miss McFetridge will
laugh and laugh. After an hour of this high-type hilarity, Phipps
will look at his watch, exclaim at the lateness of the hour, and insist

circulation in your legs. I got the best circulation in my legs of the
whole sophomore class. Ever notice how rosy my knees are?
Phipps: As a matter of fact, yes . . . Look, you sure you don't want
a ride home? There's an excellent French movie on the way.
Miss McP' 1 : Not me, dad. I hate French pictures. The sub-titles
always disappear before I can read 'em. But if you want to go to the
movies, there's a new Tony Curtis picture downtown — a real gut
buster. Tony plays this beggar, see. but he's really a prince only he
doesn't know it on account of his sneaky uncle who switched babies
when Tony got born. Then Tony finds this magic lamp, see, and he
gets into the palace where he meets this crazy girl, only she's
engaged to the fake prince, but then they have this mad sword fight,
and Tony licks about a million guys, and then he finds out he's the
prince and it's real crazy. Wanna go? I've only seen it three or
four times.
Phipps: As a matter of fact, I just remembered a previous en
gagement. Sorry.
Miss McF: That's all right. Thanks for the Philip Morris. 'Bye.
(Exit Miss McFctridge. For a, moment Phipps sits in st it nncd
silence, mopping his brow. Then a smile appears on his face.
He is a happy man again — out of love. Contentedly he lights
up a Philip Morris.)

DECEMBER AND MAY: ACT II
Synopsis of Act I: A middle-aged English Professor named Phipps
has fallen desperately in love with a rosy-kneed coed named Mc-
Fetridge. Phipps doesn't know how to go about courting Miss
McFetridge, for, after all, he is a professor in the autumn ol' his
life, and she is a coed with rosy knees. Professor Twonkey, who
shares an office with Phipps, proposes the following plan: Phipps
will ask Miss McFetridge to come to his office for a conference late
in the afternoon. He will be urbane and charming and make fright
fully witty remarks about English lit, and Miss McFetridge will
laugh and laugh. After an hour of this high-type hilarity, Phipps
will look at his watch, exclaim at the lateness of the hour, and insist
on driving Miss McFetridge home. On the way home, he will pass a
theatre that shows French movies. They'll see the lViovie, then have
an exquisite French dinner, and Miss McFetridge will be so enchanted
that she cannot but yield to his suit.
So at the beginning of Act 11, we find Phipps in his office awaiting
the arrival of the poor young innocent. His hair is brushed; his
nails are clean; h'e has new leather patches on his elbows. T here is
a knock on the door. He opens it and admits a gorgeous creature with
blue eyes and pink kneecaps.
Phipps: Ah, Miss McFetridge. Come in, my dear. Won't you sit
down? Cigarette?
Miss McF: Ooh, Philip Morris! I think they're marvy, don't you?
Phipps: I do indeed.
Miss McF: Hey, prof, would you mind opening a fresh pack?
Phipps: But I just opened this one a little while ago. It's perfectly
fresh.
Miss McF: I know, prof, but I like to hear the snap when the
pack opens.
ruipps: Very well, my dear.
(He opens a fresh snap-open pack of Philtp Morris. Miss
McFetridge claps he/' hands delightedly when she hears the
snap.)
Miss McF: Hey, that fractures me! Man, I flip when I hear that
crazy snap! Do another one.
Phipps: All right.
(He snaps open another pack of Philip Morris)
Miss McF: (Ecstatically) Isn't that the living, breathing end? Do
two at once.
Phipps: Well, if you insist... .
(He does two at once)
Miss McF: More! More!
Phipps: I'm afraid that's all I have.
Miss McF: Oh . . . Well, what's up, prof? What did you want to
see me about?
Phipps: Oh, nothing in particular. Just wanted to have a little
chat, find out how you're enjoying the Shakespeare lectures.
Miss McF: I don't know, prof. By me Shakespeare is strictly a
square.
Piiipps: Indeed? Well, I must say I find your attitude refreshing.
One is so inclined toward slavish admiration when it comes to the
Bard. People forget that in many quarters Shakespeare is regarded
quite critically. Take, for example, the opinion of Shaw.
Miss McF: Artie?
Phipps: George Bernard...You know, of course, his famous words.
Miss McF: I sure don't, dad.
Phipps: Shaw said he would like to dig up Shakespeare and throw
stones at him.
Miss McF: Did he dig him?
Phipps: No, I don't believe so.
Miss McF: I don't dig him either.
Phipps: (Looking at watch) Good heavens, I had no idea it was
so late. Come, my dear, I'll drive you home.

DECEMBER AND MAY: ACT II
Synopsis of Act I: A middle-aged English Professor named Phipps
has fallen desperately in love with a rosy-kneed coed named Mc-
Fetridge. Phipps doesn't know how to go about courting Miss
McFetridge, for, after all, he is a professor in the autumn ol' his
life, and she is a coed with rosy knees. Professor Twonkey, who
shares an office with Phipps, proposes the following plan: Phipps
will ask Miss McFetridge to come to his office for a conference late
in the afternoon. He will be urbane and charming and make fright
fully witty remarks about English lit, and Miss McFetridge will
laugh and laugh. After an hour of this high-type hilarity, Phipps
will look at his watch, exclaim at the lateness of the hour, and insist
on driving Miss McFetridge home. On the way home, he will pass a
theatre that shows French movies. They'll see the lViovie, then have
an exquisite French dinner, and Miss McFetridge will be so enchanted
that she cannot but yield to his suit.
So at the beginning of Act 11, we find Phipps in his office awaiting
the arrival of the poor young innocent. His hair is brushed; his
nails are clean; h'e has new leather patches on his elbows. T here is
a knock on the door. He opens it and admits a gorgeous creature with
blue eyes and pink kneecaps.
Phipps: Ah, Miss McFetridge. Come in, my dear. Won't you sit
down? Cigarette?
Miss McF: Ooh, Philip Morris! I think they're marvy, don't you?
Phipps: I do indeed.
Miss McF: Hey, prof, would you mind opening a fresh pack?
Phipps: But I just opened this one a little while ago. It's perfectly
fresh.
Miss McF: I know, prof, but I like to hear the snap when the
pack opens.
ruipps: Very well, my dear.
(He opens a fresh snap-open pack of Philtp Morris. Miss
McFetridge claps he/' hands delightedly when she hears the
snap.)
Miss McF: Hey, that fractures me! Man, I flip when I hear that
crazy snap! Do another one.
Phipps: All right.
(He snaps open another pack of Philip Morris)
Miss McF: (Ecstatically) Isn't that the living, breathing end? Do
two at once.
Phipps: Well, if you insist... .
(He does two at once)
Miss McF: More! More!
Phipps: I'm afraid that's all I have.
Miss McF: Oh . . . Well, what's up, prof? What did you want to
see me about?
Phipps: Oh, nothing in particular. Just wanted to have a little
chat, find out how you're enjoying the Shakespeare lectures.
Miss McF: I don't know, prof. By me Shakespeare is strictly a
square.
Piiipps: Indeed? Well, I must say I find your attitude refreshing.
One is so inclined toward slavish admiration when it comes to the
Bard. People forget that in many quarters Shakespeare is regarded
quite critically. Take, for example, the opinion of Shaw.
Miss McF: Artie?
Phipps: George Bernard...You know, of course, his famous words.
Miss McF: I sure don't, dad.
Phipps: Shaw said he would like to dig up Shakespeare and throw
stones at him.
Miss McF: Did he dig him?
Phipps: No, I don't believe so.
Miss McF: I don't dig him either.
Phipps: (Looking at watch) Good heavens, I had no idea it was
so late. Come, my dear, I'll drive you home.
Miss McF: No, thanks. I always walk home. It's good for the
circulation in your legs. I got the best circulation in my legs of the
whole sophomore class. Ever notice how rosy my knees are?
Phipps: As a matter of fact, yes . . . Look, you sure you don't want
a ride home? There's an excellent French movie on the way.
Miss McP' 1 : Not me, dad. I hate French pictures. The sub-titles
always disappear before I can read 'em. But if you want to go to the
movies, there's a new Tony Curtis picture downtown — a real gut
buster. Tony plays this beggar, see. but he's really a prince only he
doesn't know it on account of his sneaky uncle who switched babies
when Tony got born. Then Tony finds this magic lamp, see, and he
gets into the palace where he meets this crazy girl, only she's
engaged to the fake prince, but then they have this mad sword fight,
and Tony licks about a million guys, and then he finds out he's the
prince and it's real crazy. Wanna go? I've only seen it three or
four times.
Phipps: As a matter of fact, I just remembered a previous en
gagement. Sorry.
Miss McF: That's all right. Thanks for the Philip Morris. 'Bye.
(Exit Miss McFctridge. For a, moment Phipps sits in st it nncd
silence, mopping his brow. Then a smile appears on his face.
He is a happy man again — out of love. Contentedly he lights
up a Philip Morris.)
