WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 (UP)
â€” Diplomatic and Congressional
authorities said today that they
strongly doubt that East - West
relations jvill be affected by the
death of Soviet Deputy Foreign
Minister Andrei Vishinsky.
President Eisenhower declined
comment on the sudden death of
the veteran Russian diplomat at the
United Nations in New York. The
Soviet embassy also refused to make
a statement.
DULLES COMMENTS
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles extended condolences to Vi
shinsky's family.
He said his and Vishinsky's posi
tions almost always were "diametri
cally opposed," but he added that
Vishinsky was "an able and vigor
ous advocate of his country's poli
cies."
'Other officials said that while Vi
shinsky was an able spokesman for
Russian policy, he was not regarded
here as a top policy maker. For this
reason, they saw no prospect that
any important changes will result
from his death.
HARD TO REPLACE
Experts on Russian policy long
have credited Vishinsky with being
a gifted orator and having a re
markable ability to adapt himself to
shifting policy lines. They said it
would he difficult for the Russians
to replace his particular talents.
Representative Omar Burleson
(D., Tex ), member of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, said Vi
shinsky's death will not alter Rus-
I sian policy but m;iy be a "disad-
I vantage."
