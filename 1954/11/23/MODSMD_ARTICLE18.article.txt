ist, China reported today its Navy
sank two Chinese Communist war
ships off the Tachen Islands where

boats went down under the fire of
unidentified attackers.
The Nationalists said their de

sank two, and routed the others in
a blazing sea battle.
Officials declined comment on To

Tachen waters.
Two Japanese crewmen were
killed and three were wounded

Japanese fishing vessels were to be

vessels to get out of "danger zones"
at once.

dor Kenkichi Yoshizawa here to in
vestigate. The Japanese said a stiff
protest would be filed with the re
sponsible government when the
identity of the attacking ships was
determined.
Nationalist officials described the
naval encounter as thwarting an at
tempt by the Chinese Communist
fleet, to attack the Tachens, the
northern anchor of the Nationalist
outpost line along the mainland
caast.
