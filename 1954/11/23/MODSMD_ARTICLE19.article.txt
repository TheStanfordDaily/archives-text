# Murrow to Discuss New Controversy
## 
### 
Edward R. Murrow will present a
discussion of a "Controversy Over
a Controversyâ€”Shall Colleges De
bate Recognition of Red China" tor
night at 7:.'JO on liis CBS television
program.
Earlier this month the topic of
diplomatic recognition of Reck China
was discussed by the Stanford Fo
rensic Society at the Northern State
Debaters' Tournament.
This new controversy over wheth
er colleges should debate recogni
tion has arisen since West Point and
Annapolis debating 'groups have
been forbidden to debate the con
troversial issue of diplomatic rec
ognition.
This action was taken by the gov
ernment since in the debate, one
side would be compelled to lake the
side that recognition should be
sought, and this is contrary to
United States policy on this issue.
