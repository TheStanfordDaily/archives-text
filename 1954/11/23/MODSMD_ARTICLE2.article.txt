# Christmas Seal Drive Launched In 1954 TB Fund Campaign
## 
### 
The 48t.1i Christmas Son! campaign
began throughout the country yes
terday, with Stanford contributions
expected to equal or top the $1,-
718.81 donated by students last year.
Letters to all students were sent
out last week by the Santa Clara
County Tuberculosis Association,
each letter containing 100 seals and
asking the students to help finance
the all-year drive.
With Christmas seals accounting
for the lion's share of expenses, the
local TB unit will use the money to
provide free X-ray service for stu
dents; to train more nurses to treat
TB patients; to increase rehabili
tation programs; to build up re
search on the dread disease; and to
supply books, pamphlets, and movies
to educate the public about tuber
culosis.
The regional executive secretary
Ann Castellanos, emphasized that
the disease is contagious, and al
though the number of patients is
gradually decreasing, an estimated
1.200,000 people still need treatment

for TB.
According to national figures, one
person contracts TB every five min
utes, a rate that the Christmas seal
association is trying to cut down.
The state directors fear that the

reduced patient rate will breed apa
thy among donors, but point out
that patients can be cured only if
the disease is found enough,
and that it costs an average of
$15,000 a patient to cure anyone
stricken with TB.
