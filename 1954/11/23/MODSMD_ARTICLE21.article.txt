# A 						Warning from Einstein
## 
### 
A shock is supposed to be good medicine.
If so, thinking Americans everywhere re
ceived a healthy dose in a letter appearing in
the current Reporter magazine. The letter was
written in answer to a Reporter queiy. We
quote it in full.
To the Editor:
You have asked me what 1 thought about
your articles concerning the situation of the
scientists in America. Instead of trying to anal
yze the problem I may express my feelings in
a short remark. If I would be a young man
again and had to decide how to make my living,
1 would not try to become a scientist or scholar
or teacher. I would rather choose to be a
plumber or a peddler in the hope to find that
modest degree of independence still available
under present circumstances.
ALBERT EINSTEIN
Princelon, New Jersey
This letter might be taKen as Einstein's dis
approval of the fact that men in public life are
subject to more restriction of thought than is
the ordinary citizen.
Or it might be taken as a direct reference to
men like Robert Oppenheimer whose careers
were wrecked by public criticism.

But it means more than either of these two
rather specific criticisms. It is a sweeping in
dictment of current American society.
This indictment is justified and necessary,
and we are glad that it has come from as re
spected and honored a man as Einstein.
America today suffers from an over-emphasis
on conformity.
Because of fear, more and more liberty of
thought is being curtailed. Intellectualism has
fallen into disrepute, and "egghead" has been
added to the list of words with unfavorable
reputations.
We fear the results of such a trend.
We fear that ultimately it will turn upon and
destroy the men who will not conform—the I
men who might have been the leaders of to
morrow, for leaders do not arise in a situation
where freedom of thought leads to supression,
smears, and smashed careers.
Intellectual freedom is an integral part of any
healthy society. Any time it is threatened, the
society itself is endangered.
Einstein's timely note of warning is ad
dressed to America in general, and to intellec
tual institutions such as Stanford in particular.
We hope that his warning will be heeded.
