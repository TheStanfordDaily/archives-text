# Protect Yourself
## 
### 
You may have tuberculosis right now and not
know it. The chest X-ray you had when you
first registered at Stanford lessens the chances,
but the fact still remains that college students
and college life give TB excellent working con
ditions.
To begin with, men and women are most
susceptible between the ages of 15 and 34—
that should include most undergraduates and
graduates. Next, men and women catch TB
easiest when they are tired (studying all night
for midterms or finals), in poor health, under

nourished or malnourished (reducing diets not
prescribed by doctors or not eating balanced
meals). And crowded living condition speed
the rate of congestion.
That is why we think that you, as college stu
dents, Stanford students, should be vitally con
cerned about the Christmas Seals you are re- i
ceiving in the mail. For the pennies, nickles,
dimes, and dollars you send to the Santa Clara
County Tuberculosis Association are your in
vestment in a healthy, TB-free future for you,
your family, and your friends.
You are vulnerable—protect yourself.
