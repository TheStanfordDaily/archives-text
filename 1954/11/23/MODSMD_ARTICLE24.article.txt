# New Row Director Inaugurates 'Roman Banquet' for Hurlburt
## 
### JULIE HARRIS 
The Row's new director, Mrs.
i Carolyn Hale, started something
| new in campus living at Hurl
i burt House a lew Sundays ago.
i The tang of eucalyptus per
j meated the house—a Roman
Banquet was on the agenda for
the evening, and branches were
! being hung, pillows lined along
, the rugs, and bowls of fruit ar
; ranged.
Pausing to admire the decorations,
i Mrs. Hale explained that the idea
had come from her experiences in
her first job, as assistant to the Vice-
Director of the Metropolitan Mu
| seum of Art in New York City.
There, where she worked in the
| public Yelations field throughout the
i war,, she had planned many such
! events—from Roman and Medieval
I banquets to Chinese shows. Her
! work involved obtaining subscrip-
I lions for the museum and arrang
ing the private showings given for
subscribers.
One of these showings was the un
veiling of the paintings which had
been stored for safety during the
war. "A simply fabulous affair," she
relates, "with more than 12,000 pres
ent." Planning such events to ac
quire funds for worthy causes "has
always fascinated me."
Along these lines, Mrs. Hale has

been mulling over suggestions to
make the Row Carnivaf an even
greater success. She wonders, for
instance, whether the carnival might
be incorporated with a campus-wide
dance. "The time to evaluate such
events is while they are still fresh."
"But I am not about to make
sweeping innovations," she empha
sized. "Everything has been run
ning very smoothly, and my main
concern is in orienting myself in my
new post."

Mrs. Hale has come to Stanford,
I her first trip to California, from the
University of Colorado, where she
was director of a residence for 700
undergraduate women, as well as a
counselor at Grand Junction High
School. Colorado was home ground,
for there she received her Master's
degree in guidance and personnel
services. She has also done work at
the University of Illinois and Co
l'umbia University.
The new Row Director, a member
of many civic and service groups,
is most proud of her five-year serv
ice on the board of directors of the
Consultation Service, at Westches
ter, New York.
As a former faculty wife at the
j University of Illinois and Hamilton
College, Mrs. Hale treasures univer-
J sity atmosphere. She has found
; Stanford "extremely friendly and
hospitable."
Mrs. Hale, when asked about her
daughter, Mrs. Perrine Wiley, who
lives in Palo Alto and is associated
with Electronics Research, antici
pated the next question and volun
teered, with a broad grin, "Yes, I'm
a grandmother! And justly proud
of my extremely charming grand
daughter. 1 married at 18, you
know."
Mrs. Hale lound it impossible to
generalize about the myriad respon
sibilities she lias assumed. There is
much administrative detail. "I do
hope to formulate new approaches
as time goes on, though changes as
such don't seem in order," she con
cluded.
