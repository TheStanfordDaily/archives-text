# Stanford Ends First Losing Season Since 1948
## 
### 
With their Big Game loss to Cali- I
fornia last Saturday, the Cardinal
football team finished its season with !
a four won and six lost record and |
hereby gave Stanford its first losing
football year since 1948 when the j
Card gridders or that season also
had a 4-6 mark.
Chances that the Indians will have I
a losing season next fall are very
dim, however, for in their CO years
on the gridiron Farm football teams
have had only eight losing seasons,
and only twice before h&ve they
ever lost more than they won in two
consecutive seasons. This Occurred
in 1938-1939 and 1947-1948.
Stanford's poorest season ever |
came in 1947, when the Card grid- \
ders. then coached by Marchie j
Schwartz, lost all nine "games on j
their schedule. Among the defeats
that season was a 19 to 16 setback I

by Idaho, the only time the North
west school has ever topped the
Cards.
The Indians first fielded a football
team in 1891, but did not suffer their
first losing season until 1899, when
the Card eleven that year won only
two of nine games.
Other below .500 years other than
those mentioned before include 1922,

- when Stanford won four of nine
? games, and 1936, when the Indians
captured but two of the nine tilts
1 on their schedule.
l " With their four victories this year
1 Stanford increased its all-time foot
' ball record to 366 wins, 145 defeats,
and 40 ties. They also boosted their
l all-time total of points scored to
, 9,575 as compared to 4,423 scored

against them. However, this year's
eleven did set one dubious scoring
record, allowing UCLA to tally 72
points against them, the most against
any Indian team in history.

UP FOR GRABS—Three Cards and a Bear go into the air for a

Carmichael, but Jerry Gustafson (16) who intercepted it, Tony
Mosich (69), and Ernie Dorn had other ideas. The play occurred
in the second quarter with the score 7-0 for Cal, and gave Stan-
