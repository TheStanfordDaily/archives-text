# Mrs. Charles A. Taylor Is Football Widow in Autumn
## 
### LEE HANSEN 
The finish of the 1954 football season means an end for fans of
visits to Stanford Stadium to see Chuck Taylor's team peiform.
But for Mrs. Chuck Taylor, it means the end of being a "football
widow" and the beginning of some visits with her husband.
During the actual season, she sees about as much of her husband

in newspaper pictures as she does' 4
in person. And the few times he is
home, his mind is still on the loot
ball field or in the coaching room,
plotting new formations.
Coach Taylor leaves early in the
morning for his office. In the after
noon he is out on the practice field.
His evenings are divided between
radio - television commitments and
coaching conferences.
Mrs. Taylor, needless to say, was
disappointed at the outcome of the
Big Game. But she is not a Stanford
graduate. She comes from Califor
nia.
The attractive, brown-haired Mrs,
Taylor met her future husband when
they were both sophomores in col
lege- Cal and Stanford, respectively.
She was especially popular her sen

ior year as she sat in the middle of
the Cal rooting section cheering
loudly ior her fiance, who was cap
tain of the Stanlord team.
Married after graduation, time
went quickly for the Taylors as
Chuck completed his service, put in
three years as Stanford frosh coach,
served as 49er coach for one season,
and finally ended up as Stanford
head coach in 1951.
Mrs. Taylor was busy too, and
now has a family numbering three
—Susan, age s'/a; Douglas, age 4;
and Janet, age 2. When, asked about
football's effect on their lives, she
replied that Doug just asks. "Did
Daddy win?" Susan, however, saw
her first game recently when Stan
ford played San Jose State. She told
her mother to tell her when to wave

♦
her pom-pom and then ignored it
all in favor of hot dogs, ice cream,
and cokes.
Yes, Mrs. "Coach" Taylor does
miss her husband during football
season as hi.s home presence is lim
ited to Thursday and Saturday
nights.
"He's very quiet when he loses,
but he gets over it. It's hard to
mope with three children around,"
she says, referring to his behavior
during the season.
When the Stanford team wins, they
celebrate at home or with a few
friends. Many times these friends
are other coaches, as they are all
close.
Whenever a game is out of town,
the coaches' wives get together to
listen to the game and predict the
| score. Mrs. Taylor is quite an au
thority, having hit it on the nose
twice. However, as often as possible
she attends the game and roots for
her husband in person.
She is kept busy by her family
but still manages to find time to
serve in the Allied Art Cuild lunch
room. This is an organization that
helps support the Stanford Con
Home. She also attends as many
basketball games and track meets as
I possible.
So for a while she will once more
be talking to her husband. But not
for long. "He's already beginning
| to think about next season," she
I said.
