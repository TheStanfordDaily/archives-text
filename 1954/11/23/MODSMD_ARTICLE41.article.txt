# Quo Vadis, Pigeon?

THE HAPPY WANDERERâ€”Seen yesterday in the offices of
the Department of Asiatic and Slavic studies, this pigeon is
becoming a familiar sight at Stanford. He is believed to have
been released recently by the Psychology Department after
having been used in an experiment, and, apparently liking
the atmosphere of Stanford, has stayed around the area. He
has been spotted by several students in the past lew days
in the Western Civ Libe and the Main Libe. He has not yet
expressed any opinions on controversial issues.
