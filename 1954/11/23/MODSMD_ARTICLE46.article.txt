### 
In applying for shrinkage, girls
will have their choice of shrinkage
periods. The shrinkage periods are
until registration day of winter
quarter or until two weeks follow
ing registration. If two or more girls
draw together and go on shrinkage,
they fill out separate cards and are
placed according to the placement of
the names on the drawing card.
No name may be removed from
the shrinkage- list after a girl has
signed up for shrinkage.
