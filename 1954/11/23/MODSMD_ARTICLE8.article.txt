GLAD IT'S OVER—Though most football fans are sorry to see
the 1954 season at an end, there's at least one person who's
happy about it. That is Mrs. Chuck Taylor, wife of the Stanford
football coach. She is pictured above with the three Taylor chil
dren, Susan (s'/a), Douglas (4), and Janet (2). The end of the grid
season means she will be able to spend some time with her hus
band for a change. For more details, see the feature story on
Mrs. Taylor on page three. —Photo by Frank Huntress.
