# EXCOM:
## Reconsideration Denied On Grad Council Proposal 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS Associate Editor, The Daily 
A motion to reconsider the role of the Graduate Student Council
in the Judiciary section of the proposed ASSU Constitution was
voted down 7 to 3 by Excom in their meeting last night.

♦ Steve Voykovich, graduate stu
dent representative, opened discus
sion on the point by asserting that
the Graduate Student Council
should have the original and final
jurisdiction on all Honor Code cases
involving graduate students.
Under the proposed constitution,
the Graduate Student Council is
designated as one of the inferior
councils, and, as such, its decisions
may be appealed to the Judicial
■ Council, which will be made up of
i representatives of Men's and Wom
, en's Councils.
UNDERGRADUATES CAPABLE
"I believe that undergraduates
are capable of judging and retrying
cases involving graduate students'
violations of the Honor Code, if
such a case were appealed to the
Judicial Council," argued Bob Bow
den, freshman representative.
Gordon Lundeen, president of the
Graduate Students' Association, an
swered that this view was not held
by the graduate students them
selves.
"Many graduates are unwilling to
be tried by undergraduate policies,"
he stated. "They feel that, if a case
can be appealed to the Judicial
Council as a higher court, then this
higher court will lay down some of
the policies of the Graduate Stu
dents' Council."
Lundeen's point was disputed by
Bob Margolis, president of Men's
Council.
MANY GRAD CASES
Margolis first pointed out that
one-third of the Honor Code cases
handled by the Judicial Council
concerned graduate students, thus
refuting the assertion that graduates
hesitated to have their cases tried
by an undergraduate body.
"The Judicial Council doesn't in
fluence policy formation as much as
you think," he stated. "We feel that
you will be operating as an entirely
independent body. The only times
we would interfere would be to in
struct your own body.
"But, I do feel that the Judicial
Council should be the final author
ity on Honor Code cases. This would
help to make the Honor Code seem
a uniform concept."
DIFFERENT PROBLEMS
Lundeen also brought out that
undergraduates would be unable to
understand the graduate students'
cases, because they involve different
pressures and different types of
study problems.
Pat Kipg, Daily editor, disagreed
with this viewpoint. "Many undcr
! graduates have courses in which
■ they are required to handle group
| projects and make reports, such as
| are found in the graduate schools.
Undergraduates have pressures also,
which are important to them, jut»t
as the graduates' pressures are. Also,
an Honor Code violation shouldn't
be judged by the pressure on the
person involved."
Excom then tentatively approved
the judicial section of the proposed
| Constitution, and voted to put off
of the executive section
until the next meeting.
Earlier in the evening, Dr. Wat
kins of the Political Sciencc Depart
ment gave a report on last summer's
| Eur-Cal Stanford tour. He said that
the tour gave the best coverage of
Europe for the least money, and
suggested that Stanford sponsor the
tour officially for several reasons,
one of which was the good advertis
ing for Stanford.
