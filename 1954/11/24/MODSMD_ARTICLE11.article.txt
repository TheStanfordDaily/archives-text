# Problems Beset 'Alchemist'
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
Any show, especially a big
show like the Stanford Players'
production of "The Alchemist,"
which opens Dec. 2, is a mass of
big problems and little solutions.
The trick is to make the two
come out even. And with open
ing nigh I only a week off, the
Players are pretty busy match
ing.
Problem: to accommodate wild
Marx - brothers type comings and
goinus, fist fights, arguments, acro
batics. Solution: Hugo Melchione's
two-story timbered Elizabethan in
terior, with solid board walls and
stairway, nine (count 'em, nine)
doors, and an act drop that is an
exact reproduction of a famous 17th
century engraving, "Visschcr's View
of London."
Problem: a plot that has every
main character changing costume
and personality at least three times
during the evening, sometimes with
in full view of the audience. Solu
tion: Virginia Opsvig's costumes —
everything from an outfit for a fake
Spanish Don to the mythical "fairy
lobe."
Doll, for instance, is dressed like
a prostitute. Then, during one page
of dialogue, she must change to a
great lady. Before the show Is over
she has been further transformed to
the Queen of the Fairies.
Multiply this case by the number
of characters in the play. That's the
costume problem. Multiply that by
something like infinity and you have
some idea of what a big show is like
one week before opening night.


PURSUIT—Charles Lyons as Sir Epicure Mammon moves in on
Astrid Willsrud as Doll. Or is it ihe other way around? The
scene, at any rate, is from the forthcoming Stanford Players pro
duction of Ben Jonson's farce, "The Alchemist."
