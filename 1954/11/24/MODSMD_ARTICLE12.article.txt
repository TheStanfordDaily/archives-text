# Andres Segovia Featured In First Series Concert

### STEW TOY 
When Andres Segovia plays for the Stanford Concert series
next . nday it will be in a Memorial Auditorium sold out a month
before.
"So what?" you ask. "A Segovia concert partially filled would
be an oddity."
And you would be right.
through the years Segovia has built a reputation for being one

of the world's greatest musical at-'
tractions. His yearly tours of well
over 100 performances are consist
ently sold out months in advance.
This popularity is due to Segovia's
irrefutable position as the world's
greatest classical guitarist.
The fact that he is the world's
only concert guitarist does not lessen
his achievement, for the perfection
he has achieved on his eight-cen
tury - old instrument — revived by
him from a century of virtual
eclipse—could hardly be equaled.
The man who brought about the
renaissance of the concert guitar
was born in Linares, a village in
southern Spain, in 1893. He grew
up in Granada, where, at the age of
10, he first heard his country's na
tional instrument and feil in love
with it.
Segovia proceeded to leach him
self to play the guitar. And when,
at 14, he made his debut in Granada,
his performance was hailed as a
"revelation." His name was soon
known throughout Spain.
His new fame resulted in concert
tours in Europe and South America,
where his career became solidly es
tablished. His New York City debut
in 1928—the first guitar ocncert ever
Riven in that city—was a sensation,
skyrocketing his fame and leading
to a continental tour.

Sincc that time the name of Sego
via has been a legendary one, syn
onymous with perfection. The pub
lic lias acclaimed him as the sole
exponent of a "new" art.
Aside from building a huge, cult
like following, Segovia's influence
has been felt throughout the musi
cal world.
Villa-Lobos, Ibert, De Falla, Rous
sel, Tansman, Castelnuovo-Tedesco,
and other distinguished composers
have written mutic expressly for
him, co-operating with him on tech
nical details with which they were
unfamiliar. As Segovia says, "They
have had to compose through me."
Latest of the Segovia - inspired
compositions is Villa-Lobos' Con
certo for Guitar and Orchestra,
which was given its world premiere
by the artist and Sir John Barbi
rolli and the Halle Orchestra in
London last fall.
Segovia's Stanford concert will
include works by Albeniz, Granados,
Bach, Scarlatti, Sor, and others.
Such is the influence of Segovia
that thousands of students have
taken up the guitar at European
conservatories, which have been
forced to add the revived instru
ment to their curricula.
But for Segovia, who loves his
guitar, the pleasure he gives to mu
sic lovers is all the influence he de
sires.
To his audiences, who sit in rapt
silence during his performances
("In the silence," according to the
New York World - Telegram and
Sun, "a cough is an explosion!"), his
artistry is a form of hypnosis.
To the press and music critics, Se
| govia's music is "one of the wonders
of our time."
And to the vast majority of music
conscious laymen, Segovia is Sego
via and there is'no one quite like
him in the world.
