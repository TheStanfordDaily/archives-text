E-fiat major and Stravinsky's Suite
from"The Fire Bird."
Segovia, who received his first
musical training at an early age in
his native Andalusia, forsook the
piano and violin to study the guitar.
However, sincc the guitar had be
come an almost extinct concert in
strument, the difficult problem of
self-study was forced upon him. He
diligently searched the literature of
the lute and kindred instruments for
compositions which could be adapt
ed and transcribed for the guitar.
Moreover, during his years of
growing mastery of the instrument,
he persuaded such renowned com
posers as Villa-Lobos, De Falla,
Roussel, Turina, Castelnuovo - Te
desco, and Ponce to write works for
him. The l'esult has been the pro
duction of a wealth of material
which has helped to popularize once
again this near - vanishing instru
ment.
Next week, Grant Johannescn,
pianist, will be guest soloist with the
symphony. He will play Ravel's
Piaon Concerto for the Left Hand
and Milhaud's "Le Carnaval d'Aix."
