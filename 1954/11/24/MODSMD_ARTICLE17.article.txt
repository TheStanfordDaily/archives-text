# WEST, EAST AGREE
## U.N. Committee Approves 'Atoms for Peace' Agency 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Nov. 23 (UP) —The West and the East
took their first big step in the United Nations today toward bring
ing President Eisenhower's momentous "atoms for peace" plan
into reality.
A seven-nation resolution calling for the speedy setting up of

'an international atomic energy
agency to take charge of the plan
was adopted unanimously by the
60-nation Political Committee.
The resolution calls also for an in
ternational technical conference on
the plan, to be held by next August.
Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., chief
United States delegate to the U.N.,
called the committee's action "his
toric." U.N. Secretary General Dag
Hammarskjold said that the U.N.
had embarked on a course "that may
well prove to be epoch-making."
Soviet Russia and its satellites
voted for the resolution after the
overwhelming defeat of two Rus
sian amendments to it.
RUSSIAN AMENDMENTS
One of the Russian amendments
would have put the international
agency under the U.N. Security
Council in which Russia, along with
the other Big Five powers, has the
veto right.
The other would have opened the
proposed international conference to
all countries — meaning Communist
China, among others.
Today's action was taken just 15
days short of one year after Presi
dent Eisenhower dramatically an
nounced to the U.N. General Assem
bly last Dec. 8 his plan to divert nu
clear energy to peaceful purposes
through international co-operation.
U.S. CONTRIBUTION
During political debate, the United
States announced it would make an
initial contribution of 220 pounds
of fissionable material under the
Eisenhower plan, and Great Britain
promised 44 pounds.
India has promised "considerable
quantities" of uranium. In final dis
cussion today, Victor Andres Be
launde of Peru announced that his
country is undertaking the produc
tion of uranium and hopes to con
tribute to the international atomic
energy pool.
The next step toward actual ful
fillment of the President's plan is the
approval by the U.N. General As
sembly of the Political Committee's
action. But as all U.N. members'are
on the committee, General Assem
bly action will be merely a formal
ity. It is expected that the Assembly
will act next week.

Arkady A. Sobolev, who sat for
Russia today in place of the late
Andrei Y. Vishinsky, warned he
would continue to fight in negotia
tions on the Eisenhower plan for
the amendments which met defeat
in the Political Committee.
But Sobolev said that his vote for
the resolution itself means that Rus
sia supports the principle of inter
national co-operation in the field of
using nuclear energy for peaceful
purposes.
The United States, Canada, Great
Britain, France, Belgium, Australia,
and South Africa sponsored the

using nuclear energy for peaceful
purposes.
The United States, Canada, Great
Britain, France, Belgium, Australia,
and South Africa sponsored the
"atoms for peace" resolution.
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Nov. 23 (UP) —The West and the East
took their first big step in the United Nations today toward bring
ing President Eisenhower's momentous "atoms for peace" plan
into reality.
A seven-nation resolution calling for the speedy setting up of

'an international atomic energy
agency to take charge of the plan
was adopted unanimously by the
60-nation Political Committee.
The resolution calls also for an in
ternational technical conference on
the plan, to be held by next August.
Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., chief
United States delegate to the U.N.,
called the committee's action "his
toric." U.N. Secretary General Dag
Hammarskjold said that the U.N.
had embarked on a course "that may
well prove to be epoch-making."
Soviet Russia and its satellites
voted for the resolution after the
overwhelming defeat of two Rus
sian amendments to it.
RUSSIAN AMENDMENTS
One of the Russian amendments
would have put the international
agency under the U.N. Security
Council in which Russia, along with
the other Big Five powers, has the
veto right.
The other would have opened the
proposed international conference to
all countries — meaning Communist
China, among others.
Today's action was taken just 15
days short of one year after Presi
dent Eisenhower dramatically an
nounced to the U.N. General Assem
bly last Dec. 8 his plan to divert nu
clear energy to peaceful purposes
through international co-operation.
U.S. CONTRIBUTION
During political debate, the United
States announced it would make an
initial contribution of 220 pounds
of fissionable material under the
Eisenhower plan, and Great Britain
promised 44 pounds.
India has promised "considerable
quantities" of uranium. In final dis
cussion today, Victor Andres Be
launde of Peru announced that his
country is undertaking the produc
tion of uranium and hopes to con
tribute to the international atomic
energy pool.
The next step toward actual ful
fillment of the President's plan is the
approval by the U.N. General As
sembly of the Political Committee's
action. But as all U.N. members'are
on the committee, General Assem
bly action will be merely a formal
ity. It is expected that the Assembly
will act next week.
CONTINUE FIGHT
Arkady A. Sobolev, who sat for
Russia today in place of the late
Andrei Y. Vishinsky, warned he
would continue to fight in negotia
tions on the Eisenhower plan for
the amendments which met defeat
in the Political Committee.
But Sobolev said that his vote for
the resolution itself means that Rus
sia supports the principle of inter
national co-operation in the field of
using nuclear energy for peaceful
purposes.
