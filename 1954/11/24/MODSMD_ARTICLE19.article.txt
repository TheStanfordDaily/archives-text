Thanksgiving Day 1954.
Just another day at Stanford, except there
are no classes. The campus is quieter than
usual, since many have gone home for a turkey
dinner and a few hours rest before finals.
But for those left behind, there are the same
worries about-homework and clothes waiting to
be washed and next weekend's date. And there
are complaints about being "stuck" here for the
four-day vacation.
Over in Yugoslavia a student named Petar
Macanovic is wondering for the millionth time
what it would have been like to spend a year
in the United States, living and studying at a
free university such as Stanford. And perhaps
he silently complains about being "stuck" too
—stuck in his native country with little hope of
ever leaving.
Thanksgiving 1954.
In colleges across the country knots of stu

dpnts berate McCarthy and the decline of in
tellectual freedom. And then they go on to dis
cuss recognition of Red China and loyalty
oaths and segregation rulings, and they debate
and criticize to their heart's content.
In Czechoslovakia a newsman and his wife
have just been released after seven years in
communist prisons on charges which, accord
ing to their jailers, "could not be substanti
ated." And for them intellectual freedom—or
any freedom—has a new, precious meaning.
Thanksgiving 1954.
Throughout the land there are morning
church services and afternoon football games
and midnight raids on the leftover turkey.
There is an abundance of food, of warmth, of
happiness, of opportunity.
And in every other country in the world
people turn to us in amazement and ask, "Do
you have any idea at all how fortunate you
are?" •
