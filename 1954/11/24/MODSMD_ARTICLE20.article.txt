## Try an All-Day Sucker? 
### 
To the Editor:
The fiasco that was last Sunday's Flicks has left me
with such a foul taste in my mouth that I l'eel com
pelled to write something in the nature of an appeal.
Its success will depend upon whether I am in the
"unappreciative" minority or the disgusted majority.
Perhaps I am not justified in assuming that college
level intelligence implies corresponding good taste
necessary to appreciate a motion picture as fine as
"Limelight." Failing this, one might expect a level
of maturity to prevail which would produce conduct

compatible with common courtesy.
However, these seem to be dangerous assumptions,
and we are left with a problem to which there are
two possible solution:.; Fither (a) we must abandon
this admirable but "unrealistic" effort to bring col
lege level entertainment to a college audience, and
go back to the serials; or (b) we can start a "bring-a
sponge-to-the-Fliek â€” a ml-si uff- it-in-your-neighbor's
mouth" campaign. Maybe a large all-day sucker
would be more appropriate.
