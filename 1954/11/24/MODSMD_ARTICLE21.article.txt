# Praise for the Class of '58
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I am a sophomore, traditionally antagonistic to
ward the freshmen. Nevertheless, I must write a
few words of praise of the class of 1958 on the basis
of its actions during the past two months. We have
heard of its scholastic and athletic records, but I
have been most impressed by another quality of this
year's freshmen. Â«
They have set for themselves a standard of man
ners and morals such as is not generally seen among
the other undergraduates. I have keen to many ex
ehanges and parties where the only purpose was
drinking, other than in moderation. Rarely did one
ol these break up before every available ounce ol
alcohol had been consumed. Tigs was not, I dis
covered, an adolescent practice which disappears as

the months go on. It seem:.-; to be n permanent tradi
tion in college life.
But this year's freshrn n offer a challenge to that
tradition. They find it perfeciiy acceptable to have
soft drinks at exchanges, and when they do drink,
use judgment of moderation worthy of mature in
dividuals. Their manners too, leave some hope that
our society is not dec.;dont. With few exceptions,
they are making a reputation for which they them
selves and Stanford can be : pecially proud, one
which I hope will be firmly < tablished in the future.
Although possibly ; 1 ain:-.t uppcrclassmen's prin
ciples, it. would do the utmost good fo'r '55, '56, and
57 to taki a good io-.k in th"ir younger competitor.
Maybe they'd learn how to grow up.
