# Key Injuries Hurt Cards This Season
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
There seems little doubt Stanford lost the Big Game because they weren't the best team on the
field. But had a number of key players been on the field last Saturday, the outcome might have
been different.
Few collegiate teams have ever been hurt as hard at one position as the Cards this year at the
guard spot. The five top candidates for that spot were sidelined for at least one full game. In
addition, many other key players were also out of action.
Matt Armitage tops the list of sidelined players. He was a three-year letterman and the top

candidate for a first-string berth at
guard. After playing tackle last sea
son, he was shifted back to his old
spot.
The week after the UCLA game,
Armitage was presented with the
Bob Mathias Sportsmanship Trophy.
Later that afternoon, he suffered a
broken leg in practice. He was only
recently released from Palo Alto
Hospital.
The other starting guard was Roy
Krickeberg. The week after Armi
tage was injured, Krickeberg suf
fered a wrenched knee. It was later
reinjured, and he missed the re
mainder of the season's games.
Guard Tony Mosich picked up t a
shoulder separation, and missed two
games. He wasn't able to regain top
form after that. Don Manoukian
suffered a head concussion and
missed three of the last four games
this year. He returned to action for
only a brief .spell Saturday.
Donn Carswell, the fifth of the
injured guards, suffered a severe
nose injury which caused him to
miss quite a bit of action. It was
thought that he would miss the Big
Game, but he was given doctor's
permission to play only a few hours
before the opening gun. He rein
jured his nose on the third play of
the game.
Steve Doctor, 6-3 end, worked his
way to a first-string berth, and did
a good job for the Cards, particu

larly on defense. But a mid-season
knee injury sidelined him for the
rest of the year. He was operated
on two weeks ago.
Quarterback Jack Gebert was one
of the top three candidates for the
starting quarterback spot. But a
few weeks before the season opened,
he suffered an injury to a knee liga
ment, and did not see action for the
Cards in 1954.
The outstanding lineman on the
team was center Jerry Goldberg.
He suffered a knee injury in mid

season and was able to see only
limited action after that. At one
point in the Big Game, he was side
lined along with Don Ged
des and Bob Long. Chuck Taylor
was using his fourth-stringer, Tom
McKenna.


INJURED INDIAN ACESâ€”The loss of the two rugged lineman pictured above, Matt Armitage on
the left and Steve Docter on the right, certainly proved costly to the Stanford football team this
past season. Before being injured, Armitage was considered the backbone of the Card line, while
Docter was one of the team's starting ends.
