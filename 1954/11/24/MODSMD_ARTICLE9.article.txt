"Ignorance and inflexibility
caused the ruining of part of the
West. We had and we have too
much power, too little informa
tion, and too little responsibility
to take our power out upon the
environment."
Til is point was made by Professor
Wallace E. Stegner in a talk, "The
Second Opening of. the West," last
night at the Tuesday Evening Series.
Beginning with a description of
his boyhood upon the Saskatchewan
prairies, Stegner described the mis
takes made by the pioneers in their
development of the American West.
"We imposed ourselves upon the
prairies, wrecked the ecological
structure . . . and when a dry spell
came, we left, creating homemade
dust bowls."
MYTHOLOGY
Stegner explained that mythology,
folk beliefs, and folklore were used
by the pioneeis in cultivating the
West, instead of scientific knowledge.
He pointed out that if the pio
neers had had any knowledge of
agriculture and agricultural meth
ods, they v/ould not have done the
damage they did to the Western
prairies.
Stegner described the efforts of
John Wesley Powell to enlighten the
pioneers by his scientific observa
tions. According to Stegner, Powell
was the last actor in the exploration
of the West and the first in verifying
information about it.
"Powell believed that we must
modify ourselves before we modify
our environment," Stegner said. He
went on to explain that Powell's
recommendations regarding survey,
land, arid water laws in the West,
were not listened to.
"Powell tried to explain to Con
ress and the American pioneers that
our systems must become flexible in
order to cultivate the arid West. He
was prophetic about the dust bowls
and other land problems we now
face."
ECHO DAM
Stegner discussed the present
Echo Lake dam controversy. "Pub
lic power" projects must be justified
to the hilt in terms of the public
benefit they produce," he said, "be
fore the investment of funds in
them. We must decide what land
is worth, developed, and what price
is too high to pay."
He stated that these standards of
value are necessary because we
have the future to think of.
"There are only so many dam
sites on a river and after a certain
period of time, our descendants will
have to search elsewhere for the
benefits we derive from our present
dams," he explained.

were not listened to.
"Powell tried to explain to Con
ress and the American pioneers that
our systems must become flexible in
order to cultivate the arid West. He
was prophetic about the dust bowls
and other land problems we now
face."
ECHO DAM
Stegner discussed the present
Echo Lake dam controversy. "Pub
lic power" projects must be justified
to the hilt in terms of the public
benefit they produce," he said, "be
fore the investment of funds in
them. We must decide what land
is worth, developed, and what price
is too high to pay."
He stated that these standards of
value are necessary because we
have the future to think of.
"There are only so many dam
sites on a river and after a certain
period of time, our descendants will
have to search elsewhere for the
benefits we derive from our present
dams," he explained.
