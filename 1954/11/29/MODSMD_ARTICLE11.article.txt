## 
### 
An overflow crowd last night filled
Memorial Auditorium to hear a i
two-and-a-half-hour program by!
guitar master Andres Segovia.
The audience fell under a hyp- I
notic spell as Segovia began his pro- j
gram with Fernando Sons' "Study,'"
and throughout the performance the I
rapt silence was broken only by a
crash of applause at the conclusion j
of each selection.
As the audience roared its ap- I
proval at the end of the concert, I
Segovia returned to the stage to I
play two cncore numbers.
Among (he selections be.st re- j
ceived by the audience were Sors' j
"Allegro in D," Domenico Scarlat- !
ti's "Sonata," Enrique Granados' j
"Danza," and "Torre Bermeja" by j
Isaac Albcniz.
Segovia's performance left little I
doubt as to why the concert, spon- j
sored by the Stanford Concert Se
ries, was sold out more than a j
month ago.—W. W.
