WASHINGTON, Nov. 23 (UP)—Senator Wallace F. Bennett (R.,
Utah) plans to introduce a new censure charge against Senator
Joseph R. McCarthy, Wisconsin Republican, tomorrow for his
tieatment of the Senate and its special Watkins censure committee.
Bennett will introduce an amendment to the pending censure

resolution charging tlrat McCarthy
tended to bring the Senate into "dis
honor and disrepute" and to "ob
struct" its constitutional processes
with his attacks on the committee
and its chairman, Senator Arthur V.
Watkins (R.. Utah).
Bennett, had announced earlier
that he would file the new count
because of McCarthy's criticism of
the censure session as a "lynch
party," his denunciation of the cen
sure committee as "unwitting hand
maidens" of the Communists, and
his description of Watkins as cow
ardly.
McCarthy, who almost eluded re
porters by leaving the hospital today
through a "fire exit," said he will be
on hand when the censure debate
resumes at noon after a 10-day re
cess. He denied there would be any
attempt to "filibuster" the ccnsure
resolution to death.
McCarthy was asked as be left
the hospital, feeling "very well,"
about reports that his backers plan
a filibuster against the censure move
in an effort to ward off a vote. The
Senate must adjourn Christmas Eve
regardless of what happens.
In an appearance on the "Meet the
Press" NBC-TV program tonight,
Senator Watkins defended the com
mittee against McCarthy's charge
that it had "done the work of the
Communist party." He also disputed
McCarthy's assertion that the spe
cial Senate session is a "lynching
bee."
