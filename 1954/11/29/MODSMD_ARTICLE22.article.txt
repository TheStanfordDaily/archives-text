# Two Honor Codes?
## 
### 
One of the most controversial issues to come
out of the recent Executive Committee discus
sions on the draft constitution is the proposed
Graduate Student Council to handle Honor
Code cases involving graduate students.
Disagreement between the graduate and un
dergraduate members of the Executive Com
mittee hinges on this one basic point:
Should the Graduate Council have complete
and absolute jurisdiction on the graduate level
or should it be a subordinate body under the
Judicial Council (the present Council for Stu
dent Control)?
The graduate representatives argue that plac
ing the Graduate Council under the Judicial
Council would ruin its effectiveness, since
graduate students would hesitate to turn in
possible violators if they were to be tried under
policies established by an undergraduate Judi
cial Council.
They further insist that graduate study is so
entirely different from the undergraduate lec
ture-examination pattern that the Judicial Coun
cil would not fully understand the situation
faced by the graduate student.
Finally, they point out that the graduate stu
dent who comes to Stanford after having grad
uated from another college or having worked
for several years has an entirely different per
spective toward Stanford and the Honor Code
than does the undergraduate who attends Stan
ford for four years and knows no other system.
We don't question the validity of the argu
ments raised by the graduate representatives.
We agree - as do most of the Executive Com
mittee members that the graduate curricula

and general outlook are unique and warrant a
special Graduate Council to deal with Honor
Code violators.
But we can see no justification for not making
this council subordinate to the Judicial Council,
in the same manner as the IFC, ICC, and Vil
lage, Toyon, and Encina councils would be
subordinate.
This would enable graduate students to ap
peal decisions of the Graduate Council to the
Judicial Council, with final appeal still open
to the deans of the various schools.
A graduate who appealed his case would
not necessarily find himself facing a Judicial
Council composed entirely of undergraduates.
Graduate students are now eligible and will be
in the future to run for positions on Men's and
Women's Councils. It is mathematically pos
sible that the graduate class, controlling over
2,500 votes, could elect a full slate of Council
members.
Of primary importance, however, is the sim
ple fact that the Honor Code applies equally to
all students in all classes. Its interpretation
must be broad to meet varying situations. But
it must be standardized to insure fair applica
tion.
Unless all students—graduates and under
graduates—adhere to the basic principles and
policies of the Honor Code, there will be no
such thing as a Stanford Honor Code.
Either the Judicial Council should establish
that uniform policy, or we should openly admit
that we have a double standard and operate
under two Honor Codes, one for graduates and
one for undergraduates.

members.
Of primary importance, however, is the sim
ple fact that the Honor Code applies equally to
all students in all classes. Its interpretation
must be broad to meet varying situations. But
it must be standardized to insure fair applica
tion.
Unless all students—graduates and under
graduates—adhere to the basic principles and
policies of the Honor Code, there will be no
such thing as a Stanford Honor Code.
Either the Judicial Council should establish
that uniform policy, or we should openly admit
that we have a double standard and operate
under two Honor Codes, one for graduates and
one for undergraduates.
One of the most controversial issues to come
out of the recent Executive Committee discus
sions on the draft constitution is the proposed
Graduate Student Council to handle Honor
Code cases involving graduate students.
Disagreement between the graduate and un
dergraduate members of the Executive Com
mittee hinges on this one basic point:
Should the Graduate Council have complete
and absolute jurisdiction on the graduate level
or should it be a subordinate body under the
Judicial Council (the present Council for Stu
dent Control)?
The graduate representatives argue that plac
ing the Graduate Council under the Judicial
Council would ruin its effectiveness, since
graduate students would hesitate to turn in
possible violators if they were to be tried under
policies established by an undergraduate Judi
cial Council.
They further insist that graduate study is so
entirely different from the undergraduate lec
ture-examination pattern that the Judicial Coun
cil would not fully understand the situation
faced by the graduate student.
Finally, they point out that the graduate stu
dent who comes to Stanford after having grad
uated from another college or having worked
for several years has an entirely different per
spective toward Stanford and the Honor Code
than does the undergraduate who attends Stan
ford for four years and knows no other system.
We don't question the validity of the argu
ments raised by the graduate representatives.
We agree - as do most of the Executive Com
mittee members that the graduate curricula

and general outlook are unique and warrant a
special Graduate Council to deal with Honor
Code violators.
But we can see no justification for not making
this council subordinate to the Judicial Council,
in the same manner as the IFC, ICC, and Vil
lage, Toyon, and Encina councils would be
subordinate.
This would enable graduate students to ap
peal decisions of the Graduate Council to the
Judicial Council, with final appeal still open
to the deans of the various schools.
A graduate who appealed his case would
not necessarily find himself facing a Judicial
Council composed entirely of undergraduates.
Graduate students are now eligible and will be
in the future to run for positions on Men's and
Women's Councils. It is mathematically pos
sible that the graduate class, controlling over
2,500 votes, could elect a full slate of Council
members.
