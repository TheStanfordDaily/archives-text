## French Policiesâ€”An Answer to Erich Hochleitner 
### 
To the Editor:
It was very interesting to read Erich P. Hochleit
ner's article on "Mendes-France, a Nationalist" in
the Daily ol November 17th. At a time when a man's
national and international prestige is riding higher
every day, it is certainly wise to watch his actions
objectively and question what many people tend to
accept emotionally. Mr. Hochleitner's article, how
ever, whether he means it or not, tends to give such
an unilateral and distorted impression of today's
French Premier that one can hardly refrain from
reacting against it. even though it contains certain
elements of truth.
It does not. seem necessary to me to list here
Pierre Mendes-France's achievements since he be
came Premiere last June. 11 is record can be found
in any paper or news magazine. What I should like
to analyze is the contention that Mr. Mendes-France
is a nationalist. The connotations of the word "na
tionalism" are very bad nowadays: a "nationalist"
is a man who not only fails to see beyond his people's
immediate interests but who has enough chauvinism
to believe that hi: country can survive isolated and
prosperous.
In the ease of P.M.-F., the accusation goes as far
as to imply that he is trying to junk Europe. Time
and again it is being repeated in the press that he
killed EDC when actually there is aboslutely no
evidence that he could have pushed the plan through
the French Assembly.
The alternative plan to allow German rearmament
that culminated in the Paris agreements last month
does not seem to indicate any outburst of French
nationalism. On the contrary, by obtaining British

participation on the Continent, P.M.-F. has consider
ably widened the basis of the European Defense
Union and by accepting Germany's admission to
NATO, he has shown more good will and broad
mindedness than money.
It is also being implied that the French Premier
is trying to boycott the Schuman Plan. Disagree
ment might have occurred between him and Jean
Monnet. However, P.M.-F.'s proposals for pooling
French and German armament industries and his
plans for closer economic cooperation between the
two countries seems to disavow any such bad in
tentions.
II it is to come, the integration of Europe is to
come soon. But let us not delude ourselves: century
long rivalries and conflicts cannot be liquidated over
night. A painful process of reconciliation and read
justment of interests still lies ahead and the "ideal
istic youth," even if it provides the soul, will not
suffice. What is needed is an army of realistic doc
tors and skilled technicians.
Let us not forget that the health of a body depends
upon the health of each of its organs. For realizing
that France has to undergo a drastic reorganization
to contribute successfully to the prosperity of Eu
rope as a whole, Mendes-France cannot be called a
nationalist.
Whatever his political future is, Pierre Mendes-
France's appearance on tho political scene in .1954
will be one ol the events of lasting influence in the
after-war European history. And by showing the
road to recovery of the so-called "sick man of Eu
rope." he will have served the European family more
than many others.
