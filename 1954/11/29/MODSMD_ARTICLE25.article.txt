# Scholar Explains German Outlook

### HELEN DEWAR 
"You have to be an optimist if
you live in Berlin," ASSU and
Berlin Affiliation Committee
Foreign Scholar Eckart Rottka
remarked proudly in a recent
interview.
"We in Berlin don't fear Commu
nism; if the Soviets attacked Ber
lin, it would be impossible to defend
anyway," he pointed out. "What we
do fear is time, because this is the
one thing that works on the side ol
Lhe Communists. The generation
alive now knows what it was like
before Communism and can com
pare life then and now. but those
born later? They will only know the
Communist way of life."
Eckart, a 20-year-old law student
from the Free University of Berlin,
was one of the two and one-half
million refugees who poured out of
the Soviet Zone to take political
refuge in the Federal Republic and
the Western sector of Berlin in the
last few years.
His father had been given a life
sentence by the Soviet government
in 1950 for "political reasons" and
Eckart, following the example of his
brother, fled to West Berlin in Jan
uary of 1951.
"Escape," he said, "is fairly easy.
Trains are checked as they enter
East Berlin, but there are no bar
riers between the- East and West
sectors of the city."
"Berlin," he explained, "is not a
part of West Germany, but has its
own government, still under Four-
Power control." He went on to say
that sentiment in Berlin is much
different from that in the territory
occupied by the Western powers, a
traditional antagonism existing be
tween the two areas.
To the important question of Ger

man unity versus European alli
ance, Eckart replied that he consid
ers compromise necessary. "It would
have been much better," he argued,
"to rearm under EDC because this
plan provided for an internationally
controlled European army even at
the lowest levels. Now, under the
NATO arrangement, eventual reuni
fication will be harder and the situ
ation more dangerous because of
the rise of German militarism."
As to the feeling of animosity be
tween the French and German peo
ple, Eckart believes that the German
youth hold little of -the resentment
that their parents have held against
their French neighbors.
"Still," he said, "Germans have
the strongest feeling for European
unity of any country on the conti
nent and are very sorry and disap
pointed that the French killed the
EDC plan."
The economic situation in free
Germany he described as "stable,"
although Berlin's post-war indus
trial reconstruction has been ham
pered by its great distance from the
large industrial and commercial
centers of West Germany. "West
ern Germany," he ventured, "has a
higher industrial capacity than be
fore the war."
"All Germans, even the Social
Democrat opposition, know that
Chancellor Adenauer is the one
great leader in Germany," he said.
As to a question of a successor to the
79-year-old pro-American leader,
Eckart replied that little thought is
given because of the chancellor's
robust health and indefatigable en
ergy.
Despite Adenauer's overwhelming
popularity with the people of the
West German zone, Berliners are
bothered by his apparent disinterest
in the former German capital.
"The story goes," Eckart admit
ted. "that United States High Com

missioner James Conant has been
over 40 times in Berlin since the
war, but Adenauer has been there
only two or three times. We feel
forgotten by the Federal Govern
ment."
"German opinion of the United
States is high," he remarked. "There
is a wonderful relationship between
American troops and the German
people. Usually occupational forces
are very poor representatives of a
nation, but American troops in Ber
lin have been specially selected and
are not regarded as the typical oc
cupational type."
Turning to Stanford life, Eckart
remarked that he was very disap
pointed by the lack of interest in
student government 011 this campus
especially since he had heard that
Stanford government was "one of
the best in the country."
Eckart. who served as chairman
of the Stanford Affiliation Commit

tee at the Free University, observed
much more political curiosity and
awareness on the German campus,
possibly because Ge r mans are
"forced to live political affairs with
the Soviets sitting right at their |
back door."
"Americans arq too materialistic," J
he said, "especially the students who
seem to study only to get a job. We !
have this problem in Germany and I
we are fighting it."
"One thing I like about your ma
terialism, though," he added, "is that
much of the money that is earned is
put to good use, such as the found
ing of exchange programs and edu- i
cational foundations."

Democrat opposition, know that
Chancellor Adenauer is the one
great leader in Germany," he said.
As to a question of a successor to the
79-year-old pro-American leader,
Eckart replied that little thought is
given because of the chancellor's
robust health and indefatigable en
ergy.
Despite Adenauer's overwhelming
popularity with the people of the
West German zone, Berliners are
bothered by his apparent disinterest
in the former German capital.
"The story goes," Eckart admit
ted. "that United States High Com

missioner James Conant has been
over 40 times in Berlin since the
war, but Adenauer has been there
only two or three times. We feel
forgotten by the Federal Govern
ment."
"German opinion of the United
States is high," he remarked. "There
is a wonderful relationship between
American troops and the German
people. Usually occupational forces
are very poor representatives of a
nation, but American troops in Ber
lin have been specially selected and
are not regarded as the typical oc
cupational type."
Turning to Stanford life, Eckart
remarked that he was very disap
pointed by the lack of interest in
student government 011 this campus
especially since he had heard that
Stanford government was "one of
the best in the country."
Eckart. who served as chairman
of the Stanford Affiliation Commit

tee at the Free University, observed
much more political curiosity and
awareness on the German campus,
possibly because Ge r mans are
"forced to live political affairs with
the Soviets sitting right at their |
back door."
"Americans arq too materialistic," J
he said, "especially the students who
seem to study only to get a job. We !
have this problem in Germany and I
we are fighting it."
"One thing I like about your ma
terialism, though," he added, "is that
much of the money that is earned is
put to good use, such as the found
ing of exchange programs and edu- i
cational foundations."
"You have to be an optimist if
you live in Berlin," ASSU and
Berlin Affiliation Committee
Foreign Scholar Eckart Rottka
remarked proudly in a recent
interview.
"We in Berlin don't fear Commu
nism; if the Soviets attacked Ber
lin, it would be impossible to defend
anyway," he pointed out. "What we
do fear is time, because this is the
one thing that works on the side ol
Lhe Communists. The generation
alive now knows what it was like
before Communism and can com
pare life then and now. but those
born later? They will only know the
Communist way of life."
Eckart, a 20-year-old law student
from the Free University of Berlin,
was one of the two and one-half
million refugees who poured out of
the Soviet Zone to take political
refuge in the Federal Republic and
the Western sector of Berlin in the
last few years.
His father had been given a life
sentence by the Soviet government
in 1950 for "political reasons" and
Eckart, following the example of his
brother, fled to West Berlin in Jan
uary of 1951.
"Escape," he said, "is fairly easy.
Trains are checked as they enter
East Berlin, but there are no bar
riers between the- East and West
sectors of the city."
"Berlin," he explained, "is not a
part of West Germany, but has its
own government, still under Four-
Power control." He went on to say
that sentiment in Berlin is much
different from that in the territory
occupied by the Western powers, a
traditional antagonism existing be
tween the two areas.
To the important question of Ger

man unity versus European alli
ance, Eckart replied that he consid
ers compromise necessary. "It would
have been much better," he argued,
"to rearm under EDC because this
plan provided for an internationally
controlled European army even at
the lowest levels. Now, under the
NATO arrangement, eventual reuni
fication will be harder and the situ
ation more dangerous because of
the rise of German militarism."
As to the feeling of animosity be
tween the French and German peo
ple, Eckart believes that the German
youth hold little of -the resentment
that their parents have held against
their French neighbors.
"Still," he said, "Germans have
the strongest feeling for European
unity of any country on the conti
nent and are very sorry and disap
pointed that the French killed the
EDC plan."
The economic situation in free
Germany he described as "stable,"
although Berlin's post-war indus
trial reconstruction has been ham
pered by its great distance from the
large industrial and commercial
centers of West Germany. "West
ern Germany," he ventured, "has a
higher industrial capacity than be
fore the war."

the Western sector of Berlin in the
last few years.
His father had been given a life
sentence by the Soviet government
in 1950 for "political reasons" and
Eckart, following the example of his
brother, fled to West Berlin in Jan
uary of 1951.
"Escape," he said, "is fairly easy.
Trains are checked as they enter
East Berlin, but there are no bar
riers between the- East and West
sectors of the city."
"Berlin," he explained, "is not a
part of West Germany, but has its
own government, still under Four-
Power control." He went on to say
that sentiment in Berlin is much
different from that in the territory
occupied by the Western powers, a
traditional antagonism existing be
tween the two areas.
To the important question of Ger

man unity versus European alli
ance, Eckart replied that he consid
ers compromise necessary. "It would
have been much better," he argued,
"to rearm under EDC because this
plan provided for an internationally
controlled European army even at
the lowest levels. Now, under the
NATO arrangement, eventual reuni
fication will be harder and the situ
ation more dangerous because of
the rise of German militarism."
As to the feeling of animosity be
tween the French and German peo
ple, Eckart believes that the German
youth hold little of -the resentment
that their parents have held against
their French neighbors.
"Still," he said, "Germans have
the strongest feeling for European
unity of any country on the conti
nent and are very sorry and disap
pointed that the French killed the
EDC plan."
The economic situation in free
Germany he described as "stable,"
although Berlin's post-war indus
trial reconstruction has been ham
pered by its great distance from the
large industrial and commercial
centers of West Germany. "West
ern Germany," he ventured, "has a
higher industrial capacity than be
fore the war."
"All Germans, even the Social
Democrat opposition, know that
Chancellor Adenauer is the one
great leader in Germany," he said.
As to a question of a successor to the
79-year-old pro-American leader,
Eckart replied that little thought is
given because of the chancellor's
robust health and indefatigable en
ergy.
Despite Adenauer's overwhelming
popularity with the people of the
West German zone, Berliners are
bothered by his apparent disinterest
in the former German capital.
"The story goes," Eckart admit
ted. "that United States High Com

missioner James Conant has been
over 40 times in Berlin since the
war, but Adenauer has been there
only two or three times. We feel
forgotten by the Federal Govern
ment."
"German opinion of the United
States is high," he remarked. "There
is a wonderful relationship between
American troops and the German
people. Usually occupational forces
are very poor representatives of a
nation, but American troops in Ber
lin have been specially selected and
are not regarded as the typical oc
cupational type."
Turning to Stanford life, Eckart
remarked that he was very disap
pointed by the lack of interest in
student government 011 this campus
especially since he had heard that
Stanford government was "one of
the best in the country."
Eckart. who served as chairman
of the Stanford Affiliation Commit

tee at the Free University, observed
much more political curiosity and
awareness on the German campus,
possibly because Ge r mans are
"forced to live political affairs with
the Soviets sitting right at their |
back door."
"Americans arq too materialistic," J
he said, "especially the students who
seem to study only to get a job. We !
have this problem in Germany and I
we are fighting it."
"One thing I like about your ma
terialism, though," he added, "is that
much of the money that is earned is
put to good use, such as the found
ing of exchange programs and edu- i
cational foundations."
