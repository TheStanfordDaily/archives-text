## More on Mendes-France 
### 
(Editor's note: This explanation of French policies
and politics is the second in the International Forum
series. It is in answer to the viewpoint expressed
by Erich Hochleitner, and was written by Nicholc
Deney, Muriel King, Claire De. Leon, Brigitte
Maldidier, Francois Perrin, Pierre Servox-Gavin,
Itene Theirs, and Philippe Senat.)
Something, at least, is comforting in French poli
tics today: they are'not a laughing matter anymore.
Still, despite this universal unci flattering interest
displayed in them, one cannot help being afflicted
when one witnesses the great amount of misunder
standing about what Mr. Mendes-France is trying to
do. Perhaps the explanation lies in the fact that one
has to be French to really understand what is going on
in France.
At any rate, if we cannot expect outsiders lo be
fully aware of the latest trends appearing from
sources which are not always available to them, we
feel it our duty to try to bring some light on the
matter.
We read here, as we understand it, a criticism of
what has been termed an out-of-date policy of na
tionalism built on supposed pride and humiliation
after the Brussel's conference, when now ail lucid
economists see no other solution than integration in
a greater unit.
Such an accusation, for someone who heard of Mr.
Mendes-France long before his name attained world
fame, looks somewhat strange.
In ISM 4, when a debate took place within the gov
ernment on what should be the policy with respect
to the immense problems that France faced, two very
different alternatives were proposed.
Some thought that France owed it to her glorious
past to assume at once a position of world power. In
short, they recommended investments at home to re
build an economy destroyed by way of occupation
by both East and West and four years of German
looting, investments in the colonies; a military effort
to fly the French flag high; and, finally, the resorting
to a ''strong" policy in Indochina, which soon turned
out to be a war effort.
Some, who from their economic training were used
to thinking in terms of what can be done ratherathan
what should be done, recommended giving priority to
the rebuilding of economic power as quickly as
possible, and then proceeding to the solution of the
other problems on a safer basis. France, they said,
has limited resources and must keep that fact in
mind.
This alternative became known as the policy of
the choices, and Pierre Mendes-France, the then
Minister of Economy, its strongest proponent. Un
fortunately General Charles de Gaulle, who presided
over the French government, with no understanding
of economic problems and an inclination for a policy

of prestige due to his exclusively military training,
voted for the solution of grandeur. This solution re
sulted in ten years in Dien Bien Phu, unrest in North
Africa, a weak metropolitan force, and a crippled
economy.
Upon the man who could have avoided those fail
ures falls the task of bringing about the reforms
which were necessary ten years ago. But the very
events of his coming into power set up the agenda in
such a way that he has been obliged to devote the
greatest part of his time to diplomatic questions, when
his first purpose is the economic reform of France.
Today this liquidation of his predecessor's diplomatic
errors is almost over.
His attack on the wine and sugar beet interests is
the first of a series of policies with the purpose of
bringing order and prosperity into the house. It
may seem strange that one should be obliged to resort
to a revolutionary attitude to carry out a liberal re
form, but it is no secret that the French premier wants
freedom to do what only freedom can do: give a new
impetus to the over-protected French industries by
opening the gates to world competition. Such policies
as lowering tariffs creates European unity as well
as benefiting both France and her neighbors.
But perhaps this subtle manner is not understood
by those Europeans who have a fondness for impres
sive organizations. There is no doubt that after such
a reform France will soon become prosperous. She
will be able to run her own affairs without resorting
to American funds or Russian ideology, the foreign
characters of both of which are of poor credit for
sound international intercourse.
In European unification, France will never agree to
the unification of. Europe under conditions which will
lead to the leadership of Germany.
France must be able to match her dynamic neighbor.
The prosperity of France is a prerequisite to the idea
of a united Europe. It is perhaps the proper place
to remind Germany that she must pay for the ruin
that she brought over Europe twice in thirty years.
The Saar economically bound to France is a repar
ation for economic losses and a guarantee against a
potential threat from a country whose territorial ar
rangement is not decided upon and about whom
France still has some reason to be watchful.
Those who wait for a go-ahead signal towards a
more complete European integration have some
reason to be impatient with France. But the blame
must be laid upon those who, by uttering flowery
phrases and promises which they knew could not be
carried out, made this postponement necessary at the
very end of their bombastic reign.
By a real understanding of the men who carry at
this time the unanimous consent of the nation, the
people who share the responsibilities both within and
without the government circles will, indeed, con
tribute to the shortening of this delay.

In ISM 4, when a debate took place within the gov
ernment on what should be the policy with respect
to the immense problems that France faced, two very
different alternatives were proposed.
Some thought that France owed it to her glorious
past to assume at once a position of world power. In
short, they recommended investments at home to re
build an economy destroyed by way of occupation
by both East and West and four years of German
looting, investments in the colonies; a military effort
to fly the French flag high; and, finally, the resorting
to a ''strong" policy in Indochina, which soon turned
out to be a war effort.
Some, who from their economic training were used
to thinking in terms of what can be done ratherathan
what should be done, recommended giving priority to
the rebuilding of economic power as quickly as
possible, and then proceeding to the solution of the
other problems on a safer basis. France, they said,
has limited resources and must keep that fact in
mind.
This alternative became known as the policy of
the choices, and Pierre Mendes-France, the then
Minister of Economy, its strongest proponent. Un
fortunately General Charles de Gaulle, who presided
over the French government, with no understanding
of economic problems and an inclination for a policy

of prestige due to his exclusively military training,
voted for the solution of grandeur. This solution re
sulted in ten years in Dien Bien Phu, unrest in North
Africa, a weak metropolitan force, and a crippled
economy.
Upon the man who could have avoided those fail
ures falls the task of bringing about the reforms
which were necessary ten years ago. But the very
events of his coming into power set up the agenda in
such a way that he has been obliged to devote the
greatest part of his time to diplomatic questions, when
his first purpose is the economic reform of France.
Today this liquidation of his predecessor's diplomatic
errors is almost over.
His attack on the wine and sugar beet interests is
the first of a series of policies with the purpose of
bringing order and prosperity into the house. It
may seem strange that one should be obliged to resort
to a revolutionary attitude to carry out a liberal re
form, but it is no secret that the French premier wants
freedom to do what only freedom can do: give a new
impetus to the over-protected French industries by
opening the gates to world competition. Such policies
as lowering tariffs creates European unity as well
as benefiting both France and her neighbors.
But perhaps this subtle manner is not understood
by those Europeans who have a fondness for impres
sive organizations. There is no doubt that after such
a reform France will soon become prosperous. She
will be able to run her own affairs without resorting
to American funds or Russian ideology, the foreign
characters of both of which are of poor credit for
sound international intercourse.
In European unification, France will never agree to
the unification of. Europe under conditions which will
lead to the leadership of Germany.
France must be able to match her dynamic neighbor.
The prosperity of France is a prerequisite to the idea
of a united Europe. It is perhaps the proper place
to remind Germany that she must pay for the ruin
that she brought over Europe twice in thirty years.
The Saar economically bound to France is a repar
ation for economic losses and a guarantee against a
potential threat from a country whose territorial ar
rangement is not decided upon and about whom
France still has some reason to be watchful.
Those who wait for a go-ahead signal towards a
more complete European integration have some
reason to be impatient with France. But the blame
must be laid upon those who, by uttering flowery
phrases and promises which they knew could not be
carried out, made this postponement necessary at the
very end of their bombastic reign.
By a real understanding of the men who carry at
this time the unanimous consent of the nation, the
people who share the responsibilities both within and
without the government circles will, indeed, con
tribute to the shortening of this delay.
(Editor's note: This explanation of French policies
and politics is the second in the International Forum
series. It is in answer to the viewpoint expressed
by Erich Hochleitner, and was written by Nicholc
Deney, Muriel King, Claire De. Leon, Brigitte
Maldidier, Francois Perrin, Pierre Servox-Gavin,
Itene Theirs, and Philippe Senat.)
Something, at least, is comforting in French poli
tics today: they are'not a laughing matter anymore.
Still, despite this universal unci flattering interest
displayed in them, one cannot help being afflicted
when one witnesses the great amount of misunder
standing about what Mr. Mendes-France is trying to
do. Perhaps the explanation lies in the fact that one
has to be French to really understand what is going on
in France.
At any rate, if we cannot expect outsiders lo be
fully aware of the latest trends appearing from
sources which are not always available to them, we
feel it our duty to try to bring some light on the
matter.
We read here, as we understand it, a criticism of
what has been termed an out-of-date policy of na
tionalism built on supposed pride and humiliation
after the Brussel's conference, when now ail lucid
economists see no other solution than integration in
a greater unit.

economy.
Upon the man who could have avoided those fail
ures falls the task of bringing about the reforms
which were necessary ten years ago. But the very
events of his coming into power set up the agenda in
such a way that he has been obliged to devote the
greatest part of his time to diplomatic questions, when
his first purpose is the economic reform of France.
Today this liquidation of his predecessor's diplomatic
errors is almost over.
His attack on the wine and sugar beet interests is
the first of a series of policies with the purpose of
bringing order and prosperity into the house. It
may seem strange that one should be obliged to resort
to a revolutionary attitude to carry out a liberal re
form, but it is no secret that the French premier wants
freedom to do what only freedom can do: give a new
impetus to the over-protected French industries by
opening the gates to world competition. Such policies
as lowering tariffs creates European unity as well
as benefiting both France and her neighbors.
But perhaps this subtle manner is not understood
by those Europeans who have a fondness for impres
sive organizations. There is no doubt that after such
a reform France will soon become prosperous. She
will be able to run her own affairs without resorting
to American funds or Russian ideology, the foreign
characters of both of which are of poor credit for
sound international intercourse.
In European unification, France will never agree to
the unification of. Europe under conditions which will
lead to the leadership of Germany.
France must be able to match her dynamic neighbor.
The prosperity of France is a prerequisite to the idea
of a united Europe. It is perhaps the proper place
to remind Germany that she must pay for the ruin
that she brought over Europe twice in thirty years.
The Saar economically bound to France is a repar
ation for economic losses and a guarantee against a
potential threat from a country whose territorial ar
rangement is not decided upon and about whom
France still has some reason to be watchful.
Those who wait for a go-ahead signal towards a
more complete European integration have some
reason to be impatient with France. But the blame
must be laid upon those who, by uttering flowery
phrases and promises which they knew could not be
carried out, made this postponement necessary at the
very end of their bombastic reign.
By a real understanding of the men who carry at
this time the unanimous consent of the nation, the
people who share the responsibilities both within and
without the government circles will, indeed, con
tribute to the shortening of this delay.

and politics is the second in the International Forum

Something, at least, is comforting in French poli
tics today: they are'not a laughing matter anymore.
Still, despite this universal unci flattering interest
displayed in them, one cannot help being afflicted
when one witnesses the great amount of misunder
standing about what Mr. Mendes-France is trying to
do. Perhaps the explanation lies in the fact that one
has to be French to really understand what is going on
in France.
At any rate, if we cannot expect outsiders lo be
fully aware of the latest trends appearing from
sources which are not always available to them, we
feel it our duty to try to bring some light on the
matter.
We read here, as we understand it, a criticism of
what has been termed an out-of-date policy of na
tionalism built on supposed pride and humiliation
after the Brussel's conference, when now ail lucid
economists see no other solution than integration in
a greater unit.
Such an accusation, for someone who heard of Mr.
Mendes-France long before his name attained world
fame, looks somewhat strange.
In ISM 4, when a debate took place within the gov
ernment on what should be the policy with respect
to the immense problems that France faced, two very
different alternatives were proposed.
Some thought that France owed it to her glorious
past to assume at once a position of world power. In
short, they recommended investments at home to re
build an economy destroyed by way of occupation
by both East and West and four years of German
looting, investments in the colonies; a military effort
to fly the French flag high; and, finally, the resorting
to a ''strong" policy in Indochina, which soon turned
out to be a war effort.
Some, who from their economic training were used
to thinking in terms of what can be done ratherathan
what should be done, recommended giving priority to
the rebuilding of economic power as quickly as
possible, and then proceeding to the solution of the
other problems on a safer basis. France, they said,
has limited resources and must keep that fact in
mind.
This alternative became known as the policy of
the choices, and Pierre Mendes-France, the then
Minister of Economy, its strongest proponent. Un
fortunately General Charles de Gaulle, who presided
over the French government, with no understanding
of economic problems and an inclination for a policy

of prestige due to his exclusively military training,
voted for the solution of grandeur. This solution re
sulted in ten years in Dien Bien Phu, unrest in North
Africa, a weak metropolitan force, and a crippled
economy.
Upon the man who could have avoided those fail
ures falls the task of bringing about the reforms
which were necessary ten years ago. But the very

such a way that he has been obliged to devote the
