# Blanks Are Due For '58 Excom
## 
### 
Applications for FVeshman Class
Excom will be accepted until noon
today and interviews will start at
1 p.m.
Applications should be chopped in
the box provided for them in the
ASSU lobby. The applicant, should
then sign the interview appointment
list located directly above the box.
Interviews will probably be contin
ued through Saturday because of
the unexpectedly large number of
applicants, according to Paul Wil
liams, class president. Over 180
freshmen have already returned ap
plication blanks.
If an applicant, finds that lie can
not keep his appointment he should
leave a message for Williams or class
secretary Wendy Hawley in the AS
SU office.
