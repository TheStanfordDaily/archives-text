CLAIMS COMPLETE INNOCENCE—AIger Hiss smiles at the
end of nearly four years of a five-year prison term at Lewisberg,
Pennsylvania. The 50-year-old former State Department aide
avowed that he meant to "vindicate his name" of the stigma of
a conviction for perjury when he denied before a federal grand
jury that he gave state secrets to red spies. Hiss will have to re
port monthly to a federal officer for the next 18 months. In this
time he plans to reassert his complete innocence from the
charges brought against him by Whittaker Chambers.
