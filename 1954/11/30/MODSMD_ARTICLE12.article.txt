# VOWS 'VIGOROUS REACTION'
## Dulles Turns Down Red China Blockade 
### 
CHICAGO, Nov. 29. (UP) —Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
tonight flatly rejected a naval or air blockade of Red China in
retaliation for the imprisonment of 13 Americans and said the na
tion will rely instead on "peaceful means."
Dulles expressed fear that strong-arm measures against Com-

| munist China might upset the delicate
! balance of world peace as well as im
pair the alliance of the free world.
He said the "aggressive" action
of the Chinese Reds actually may be
[ a new device for an attempt to split
! the free nations.
Dulles promised the nation that
the government "will react and re
act vigorously" to the imprisonment
of the Americans as spies but will not
resort to "war action" such as naval
or air blockade.
Sen. William Knowland (R-Calif.).
Senate majority leader, has called
for stronger measures than notes,
including blockade, to deal with the
Reds.
But Dulles said this country can
: not allow "ourselves to be provoked
into action which would be a viola-
I tion of our international obligations
and which would impair the alliance
of,free nations."
The State Secretary said his speech
was a report on the foreign policy
briefing he gave to Congressional
leaders of both parties at the White
House 10 days ago.
Dulles lashed out at Red China for
employing "force, intimidation and
fraud" in a major foreign policy ad
dress prepared for delivery to a
nationwide radio and television
audience.
Dulles made it plain that the Unit- .
cd States is angered over the im- j
! prisonment of the Americans and
i Red China's refusal to release them j
| after a strong U.S. note of protest, j
But he said that "We have agreed !
; by the United Nations Charter to try |
to settle international disputes by ;
| peaceful means in such a manner j
that international peace is not en- \
dangered."
"Therefore," he said, "Our first!
| duty is to exhaust peaceful means
| of sustaining our international rights
and those of our citizens rather than
resorting to war action such as a
naval blockade and air blockade of
Red China."
