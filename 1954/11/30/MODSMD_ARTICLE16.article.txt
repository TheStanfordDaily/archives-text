NEW YORK, Nov. 29 (UP)—A
founder of the "Ten Million Ameri
cans" group opposing censure of
Senator Joseph R. McCarthy
charged tonight a "hidden force" is
entrenched in the White House and
threatens to end all Congressional
investigations of Communist infil
tration of the government.
Rear Adm. John G. Crommelin,
who retired from the Navy in 1950
in a dispute over unification of the
armed forces, made the charge in

Emil Sardonelli, manager of the
Garden, estimated the crowd in the
hall at 13,000 persons, more than an
hour after the program started. The
Garden seats about 20,000.
Crommelin, chief of staff of the
"Ten Million Americans Mobilizing
for Justice," told McCarthy support
ers that well over the goal of 10,-
000,000 signatures had been obtained
on petitions opposing the Senate
censure move.
In the petitions, written by Crom
melin, Stratemeyer, and other offi
cials of the organization, the Senate
was asked to reject "Red-inspired"
censure charges against McCarthy.
They said that "subversive elements"
were out to destroy McCarthy and
a "mistaken and unjust decision"
could endanger United States secu
rity.
The crowd lustily booed mentions
of Senator J. William Fulbright CD.,
Ark.) and Ralph Flanders (R.. Vt.)
and some persons called at intervals,
"Who promoted Peress?" One man
carried a sign reading, "Sen. Joe
McCarthy for President in 1956."
