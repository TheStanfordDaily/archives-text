WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 (UP) —
The Western powers refused today
to attend Russia's "European secu
rity conference" but expressed will
ingness to join in East-West '"peace"
talks once Russia accepts a five
point plan to ease world tensions.
The United States, Britain, and
France spelled out their stand in
identical notes formally rejecting
the Kremlin's invitations to sit in on
the security talks which opened in
Moscow today with, only the Red
satellites attending.
The notes accused Russia of call
ing the conference purely as a stall
ing device "openly and explicitly
aimed at delaying or preventing"
ratification of the Paris agreement
for re-arming West Germany.
Moscow first proposed a Big Four
meeting of foreign ministers. Later,
on Nov. 13, it suggested that the for
eign ministers of 25 nations meet
in Moscow to discuss the possibility
of "creating a system of collective
security in Europe."
