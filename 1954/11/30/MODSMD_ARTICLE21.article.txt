# Senators Agree to Cast Ballot On Censure Issue Tomorrow
## Senator McCarthy Offers Plan for Showdown Vote 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 (UP)—The Senate unanimously agreed
tonight to a plan by Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy to curtail debate on
the McCarthy censure move and start talcing a showdown vote at
noon, PST, Wednesday.
McCarthy offered his surprise plan for a quick vote in a Senate

speech in which he conceded he had
used "extremely blunt" language at
times, but declared that his opinions
of certain Senate committees and
their members stand "unchanged."
The agreement for a Wednesday
vote, which came on the first day
after McCarthy's release from the
hospital, was reached by unanimous
consent tonight after once being
blocked by an objection from Sena
tor William Langer (R., N.D.).
McCarthy originally coupled with
his quick-vote plan a provision un
der which censure resolutions could
have been introduced against other
Senators, including his chief accus
ers—Senators Ralph E. Flanders (R,
Vt.), J. William Fulbright (D., Ark.),
and Wayne Morse (Ind., Ore.).
But after a spirited floor argument,
with Senator John L. McClellan (D.,
Ark.), McCarthy agreed to drop his
proviso. He said he offered it only
to see if other Senators would be
subjected to the same rules as he
had been. He said he did not. want
to take the Senate's time with fur
ther debate,
McCarthy said he still believes the
Senate will vote to censure him
when the showdown vote comes. It
could be taken on the original reso
lution recommended by the Watkins
censure committee, or on any com
promise that might be introduced.
The limit on debate will start
when the Senate meets at 7 a.in.,
PST, tomorrow.
Senate Republican Leader William
F. Knowland and Senate Democratic
Leader Lyndon B. Johnson—both of
whom worked hard in behalf of the
quick-vote plan—will divide debate
time equally between both sides in
the angry fight.
After the 12 noon, PST, Wednes
day deadline, debate on any amend
ment or motion will be limited to 30
minutes for each side and on any
substitute to two hours per side.
Thus, the timing of the final vote
will depend on how many amend
ments are offered.
During the day's hectic develop
ments, McCarthy leveled a new at
tack at the Watkins committee. He
charged it did not give him a fail
hearing and held in its possession
"12 items allegedly signed" by Sena
tor Guy M. Gillette (D., la.). He
said he has "every reason to believe"
they were signed by someone else.
McClellan, who tangled with Mc-
Carthy during the stormy Army-Mc-
Carthy hearings, said that McCar
thy's plan for new censure resolu
tions would have allowed any Sena
tor to be confronted with a long list
of charges and with only 30 minutes
to answer them.
Senator Everett M. Dirksen (R.,
111.), a McCarthy backer, said he
believed McClellan was on "solid
ground." McCarthy subsequently
dropped this plan and the final
quick-vote proposal was worked out
by Senate leaders.

censure committee, or on any com
promise that might be introduced.
The limit on debate will start
when the Senate meets at 7 a.in.,
PST, tomorrow.
Senate Republican Leader William
F. Knowland and Senate Democratic
Leader Lyndon B. Johnson—both of
whom worked hard in behalf of the
quick-vote plan—will divide debate
time equally between both sides in
the angry fight.
After the 12 noon, PST, Wednes
day deadline, debate on any amend
ment or motion will be limited to 30
minutes for each side and on any
substitute to two hours per side.
Thus, the timing of the final vote
will depend on how many amend
ments are offered.
During the day's hectic develop
ments, McCarthy leveled a new at
tack at the Watkins committee. He
charged it did not give him a fail
hearing and held in its possession
"12 items allegedly signed" by Sena
tor Guy M. Gillette (D., la.). He
said he has "every reason to believe"
they were signed by someone else.
McClellan, who tangled with Mc-
Carthy during the stormy Army-Mc-
Carthy hearings, said that McCar
thy's plan for new censure resolu
tions would have allowed any Sena
tor to be confronted with a long list
of charges and with only 30 minutes
to answer them.
Senator Everett M. Dirksen (R.,
111.), a McCarthy backer, said he
believed McClellan was on "solid
ground." McCarthy subsequently
dropped this plan and the final
quick-vote proposal was worked out
by Senate leaders.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 (UP)—The Senate unanimously agreed
tonight to a plan by Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy to curtail debate on
the McCarthy censure move and start talcing a showdown vote at
noon, PST, Wednesday.
McCarthy offered his surprise plan for a quick vote in a Senate

speech in which he conceded he had
used "extremely blunt" language at
times, but declared that his opinions
of certain Senate committees and
their members stand "unchanged."
The agreement for a Wednesday
vote, which came on the first day
after McCarthy's release from the
hospital, was reached by unanimous
consent tonight after once being
blocked by an objection from Sena
tor William Langer (R., N.D.).
McCarthy originally coupled with
his quick-vote plan a provision un
der which censure resolutions could
have been introduced against other
Senators, including his chief accus
ers—Senators Ralph E. Flanders (R,
Vt.), J. William Fulbright (D., Ark.),
and Wayne Morse (Ind., Ore.).
But after a spirited floor argument,
with Senator John L. McClellan (D.,
Ark.), McCarthy agreed to drop his
proviso. He said he offered it only
to see if other Senators would be
subjected to the same rules as he
had been. He said he did not. want
to take the Senate's time with fur
ther debate,
McCarthy said he still believes the
Senate will vote to censure him
when the showdown vote comes. It
could be taken on the original reso
lution recommended by the Watkins
censure committee, or on any com
promise that might be introduced.
