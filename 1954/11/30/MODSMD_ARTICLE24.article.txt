"Resolved: That the United States should ex
tend diplomatic recognition to the Communist
government of China."
This is the topic for the annual intercollegiate
debate suggested recently by the Speech Asso
ciation of America. And a more controversial,
debatable issue is difficult to uncover.
At this moment it appears that the original
debate topic is doomed to be overshadowed
by a second debate —should a debate on recog
nition of Communist China be held?
Examplo: "Students should not be allowed
to spend half their time arguing the Communist
side."— Herbert Cushing, President of Kearney,
Nebraska College.
Example: "I s£e little merit in ignorance."
—Senator J. William Fulbright, Arkansas.
Example: To argue the affirmative would
make young men "liable to misrepresentation
as well as providing the Reds a tremendous

propaganda device." — Annapolis Academy
spokesman.
Example: "You cannot waterproof the minds
of the young against ideas which world politics
rains down on them every day." — Harry
Gideonse, President of Brooklyn College.
And so the debate on the debate rages on,
with the original purpose—education and il
lumination on one aspect of American foreign
policy—completely obscured.
It is bitterly ironic that such vehement con
troversy should arise in the United States, the
nation vigorously fighting the Communist doc
trines of suppression of free speech and
-thought.
It is all the more tragic that the arguments
for and against the debate are raging within
the very communities which prize above all
else their heritage of intellectual freedom—the
American university.
