## Mr. Heavey vs. Mr. Nixon 
### 
To the Editor: .
Mr. James Heavey, 29. of San Francisco, has filed
.suit for $150,000 damages against Mr. Richard Nixon.
4]. of Whittier. Mr. Ileavey claims that Mr. Nixon
caused him to be assaulted and falsely imprisoned at
a meeting in San Mateo last October.
Unfortunately, it does not seem like Mr. Heavey's
entire case will stand up in court. At best, he will
probably receive no more than token damages, if any.
It is not that Mr. Heavey is morally unjustified in
this altercation. It is not that he is battling the Vice-
President of the United States, either. It is just that
legal technicalities v/ill probably keep him from win
ning his case.
Here is the story: On October 20, Mr. Heavey, a
shipyard worker, wn.-: listening to a speech by Mr.
Nixon when it occurred to him that the man on the
platform was boring the audience.
"Tell us a dog story, Dick!" suggested Mr. Heavey.
Mr. Nixon, either suspecting an unfriendly motive,
or miffed at the familiarity, ignored him. But local
police and ushers did not. They seized Mr. Heavey,
and with precious little finesse started to lead him
out of tlie room. By coincidence, Mr. Nixon had just
finished his speech, and, bidding the ushers pause in
their bum's-rushing, he started to ad lib.
In what was by far the most enlightening speechi
fying of the evening, Mr. Nixon gave Mr. Ileavey an
earnest lecture He mentioned "goon squads." Bright
eyed he referred to Thomas Jefferson's principles on
free speech, and Emily Post's on courtesy. Then he

ordered crisply, "Throw him out."
Mr. Heavey now has decided, rightly, that it was not
he, but Mr. Nixon who had been discourteous that
night. I sincerely hope that Mr. Heavey collects
something. But win or lose, the young shipyard work
er is doing his country a service just by bringing the
matter to court.
For he will force the Vice-President of the United
States publicly to show cause for an inexcusable lack
of a sense of humor.
It is said that Mr. Nixon is an ambitious man. What
we know for sure about him is that he is an arrogant
man.
If Mr. Heavey had said to Mr. Truman, "Tell us a
dog story, Harry," Mr. Truman would have dropped
everything and told a dog .story. Mr. Truman is a spicy
storyteller, as well as a fine politician.
The articulate Mr. Stevenson would have drummed
up a dog story. Or. if his writers were nowhere in
sight, he certainly would have ducked out of th>?
situation without the help of the police.
Even Mr. Eisenhower, whose sense of humor is by
definition morbid since he is a Republican, would
surely have grinned and made up some sort of a |
story for poor Mr. Heavey.
So 1 will be overjoyed to see Mr. Nixon sweat this !
one out in court. He will learn that one really shouldn't j
take oneself too seriously if he wants to get ahead ;
in politics. The way he is going, lie is not making the
best of the accidental glory of the vice-presidency.
