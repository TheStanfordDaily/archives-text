# TUESDAY SERIES
## Microwaves Are Profs' Subject 
### 
"Linear Accelerators and Nuclear
Research" will be the topic of this
quarter's last Tuesday Evening
Series program at 7:30 tonight in
Memorial Auditorium.
The illustrated lecture will be pre
sented jointly by Edward L. Ginzton.
professor of applied physics and
electrical engineering, and Wolfgang
K. PI. Panofsky, professor of physics.
The scientists head the two di
visions of the W. W. Hansen Lab
oratories. Professor Ginzton directs
the Microwave Laboratory and Pro
fessor Panofsky, the High Energy
Physics Laboratory.
Professor Ginzton directed in large
part, the building of Stanford's elec
tron linear accelerator, located across
from Quad near Ventura Hall, which
earlier this year generated the high
est energy yet achieved by man for
electrons. He is now engaged in ac
celerator design research, including
construction of a relatively small
model for treatment of cancer.
Professor Panofsky is in charge of
high energy nuclear experimenta
tion with the accelerator.
The speakers will be introduced by
Harold M. Bacon, professor of mathe
matics.
The Tuesday Scries will be re
sumed on Jan. 11.
