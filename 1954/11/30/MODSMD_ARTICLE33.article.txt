# UCLA, Navy Dominate Card All-Opponent Team
## 
### 
As might be expected, UCLA and Navy, the teams that gave
Stanford their worst two football defeats this season—dominated
the Indian 1954 All-Opponent team, which was named yesterday
by the first stringers.
Unlike most All-Opponent clubs, where the entire squad is

polled, this poll was made of only*
the 11 regulars by The Daily. Each
was asked to name the best player
he faced at only his particular posi
ion.
Named to the All-Opponent team
were:
End—Jim Ilanifan, California
Tackle—Keith Tucker, Oregon
Guard—Jim Salsbury, UCLA
Center—John Peterson, UCLA
Guard—Len Benzi, Navy
Tackle—Jack Ellena, UCLA
• End—Hon Beagle, Navy
Quarterback —Paul Larson, Cal
Halfback—Aramis Dandoy, USC
Halfback—Bob Craig, Navy
Fullback—Bob Davenport, UCLA
The Bruins and the Middies to
taled seven of the 11 positions—four
from UCLA and three from Navy.
California had two players on the
team, and Oregon and USC one
each,.
In the selections, for instance, cen
ter Jerry Goldberg was asked who
the best center was he faced all
season. None of the other players
was asked—not the first-string end
who may not have come in contact
with the center, and not the fourth
string guard who may not have
made the Oregon and UCLA trips,
and would be voting solely on the
basis of reputation and newspaper
accounts. This is the only All-Op
ponent poll of this kind taken at a
major school.
Goldberg's choice was one of the
surprises. He chose Peterson, mid
dle roan on the powerful Bruin line,
over such highly touted footballers
as Matt Hazeltine (Cal). Ron Pheis
ter (Oregon), and Marv Goux
(USC).
Hanifan and Beagle played out
standing games against the Cards.
Beagle, named to many All-Ameri
can teams, recovered a fumble in the
end zone for a touchdown. He was
also a standout as a pass receiver,
particularly on several screen
passes. Hanifan and Beagle were
picked over a number of other top
ends, including Jim Carmichael
(Cal), Hal Reeve (Oregon), Rom
mie Loudd (UCLA). Bob Quacken
bush and Arnie Pelluer (WSC).
Ellena is practically a unanimous
All-American selection this season.
He and Tucker were named over
such players as Ed Fouch (USC),
Hardiman Curethn (UCLA), and
Harry Ghilarducci (Cal).
Salisbury has also received several
All - American mentions. He and
Benzi were picked over players in
cluding Earl Monlux (Wash.), Jan
Smid (111.), and Tom Louderback
(San Jose).
Larson was given the nod over
George Shaw (Oregon) and Tom
Cox (Wash.). Dandoy and Craig
were favored over J. C. Caroline (Il
linois), Primo Villanueva (UCLA),
Jim Decker (UCLA), Bob Dunn
(Wash.), and Roy Hiram (San Jose).
Davenport was picked over Joe Gat
tuso (Navy) and Jerry Drew (Cal).

Quarterback —Paul Larson, Cal
Halfback—Aramis Dandoy, USC
Halfback—Bob Craig, Navy
Fullback—Bob Davenport, UCLA
The Bruins and the Middies to
taled seven of the 11 positions—four
from UCLA and three from Navy.
California had two players on the
team, and Oregon and USC one
each,.
In the selections, for instance, cen
ter Jerry Goldberg was asked who
the best center was he faced all
season. None of the other players
was asked—not the first-string end
who may not have come in contact
with the center, and not the fourth
string guard who may not have
made the Oregon and UCLA trips,
and would be voting solely on the
basis of reputation and newspaper
accounts. This is the only All-Op
ponent poll of this kind taken at a
major school.
Goldberg's choice was one of the
surprises. He chose Peterson, mid
dle roan on the powerful Bruin line,
over such highly touted footballers
as Matt Hazeltine (Cal). Ron Pheis
ter (Oregon), and Marv Goux
(USC).
Hanifan and Beagle played out
standing games against the Cards.
Beagle, named to many All-Ameri
can teams, recovered a fumble in the
end zone for a touchdown. He was
also a standout as a pass receiver,
particularly on several screen
passes. Hanifan and Beagle were
picked over a number of other top
ends, including Jim Carmichael
(Cal), Hal Reeve (Oregon), Rom
mie Loudd (UCLA). Bob Quacken
bush and Arnie Pelluer (WSC).
Ellena is practically a unanimous
All-American selection this season.
He and Tucker were named over
such players as Ed Fouch (USC),
Hardiman Curethn (UCLA), and
Harry Ghilarducci (Cal).
Salisbury has also received several
All - American mentions. He and
Benzi were picked over players in
cluding Earl Monlux (Wash.), Jan
Smid (111.), and Tom Louderback
(San Jose).
Larson was given the nod over
George Shaw (Oregon) and Tom
Cox (Wash.). Dandoy and Craig
were favored over J. C. Caroline (Il
linois), Primo Villanueva (UCLA),
Jim Decker (UCLA), Bob Dunn
(Wash.), and Roy Hiram (San Jose).
Davenport was picked over Joe Gat
tuso (Navy) and Jerry Drew (Cal).
As might be expected, UCLA and Navy, the teams that gave
Stanford their worst two football defeats this season—dominated
the Indian 1954 All-Opponent team, which was named yesterday
by the first stringers.
Unlike most All-Opponent clubs, where the entire squad is

polled, this poll was made of only*
the 11 regulars by The Daily. Each
was asked to name the best player
he faced at only his particular posi
ion.
Named to the All-Opponent team
were:
End—Jim Ilanifan, California
Tackle—Keith Tucker, Oregon
Guard—Jim Salsbury, UCLA
Center—John Peterson, UCLA
Guard—Len Benzi, Navy
Tackle—Jack Ellena, UCLA
• End—Hon Beagle, Navy
Quarterback —Paul Larson, Cal
Halfback—Aramis Dandoy, USC
