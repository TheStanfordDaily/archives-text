# Polo Team Blasts Arizona U. 15-3
## 
### 
Stanford's polo team celebrated
the Thanksgiving holiday by travel
ing to Tucson, where they smoth
ered the University of Arizona polo
team 15-3 Saturday morning.
Argentine ace Juan Reynal
sparked the Card team to victory.
In a terrific scoring exhibition Rey
nal personally contributed nine
goals to the Stanford cause. Tony
Mills and Dave Duff each scored
three goals for the Indian mallet
men.
In a practice game on Friday
Stanford tied the Pima County
Sheriff's Posse 8-8. The Sheriff's
Posse, Tucson's top polo team, came
from behind to overcome a three
goal deficit in the final period.
Mills led Stanford scoring with
four goals. Duff and Reynal each
tallied two, including an extremely
long goal by Reynal. The hit—from
far behind midfield—was called one
of the longest ever made on that
field .
Both games were played on an en
closed "indoor" field utilizing three
man teams and an inflated ball.
Stanford will again compete on
the same field over Christmas vaca
tion when they will compete in a
six-way intercollegiate tournament.
