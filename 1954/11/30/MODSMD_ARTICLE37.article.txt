Want a new basketball pavilion?
Like to see Stanford field a lacrosse
team? If so, see the Stanford Ath
letic Board.
The athletic board, composed of
nine members, decides all of the
University's athletic policies. It is
the athletic board that hires new
coaches, buys new football uniforms,
builds new athletic facilities, and
performs all the other duties neces
sary to maintaining and furthering
Stanford's athletic program.
The board is made up of three
faculty members, three alumni, and
three students. All positions are ap
pointive, with the exception of the
permanent post held by the student
body president.
At the present time, the three fac
ulty members are Rixford K. Sny
der, Director of Admissions; Eugene
L. Balch, Chief Counselor for Men;
and Professor John B. Hurlbut.
The three alumni representatives
to the board are Reginald Caughey,
present chairman of the board; Wil
liam Corbus, Stanford Ail-American
guard in 1933; and Frank Rehm.
The present student body repre
sentatives are Pete Bing, student
body president; Jerry Goldberg,
center on the football squad; and
John Easter, football student man
ager.
Although the board makes the
athletic policy decisions, it does not
have the final word. Approval of all
policies must be made by University
President J. Wallace Sterling and
the Board of Trustees. It is often
due to this shuffling of decisions up
and down the chain of command
that news of a major decision (such
as a coaching change) will leak out
prematurely.
