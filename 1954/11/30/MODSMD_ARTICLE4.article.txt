# Director Comments On The Alchemist'
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
"Jonson has too long been saddled with the albatross of his
own critical theories. He has been buried alive in 'literature'
courses." So commented director Robert Loper on the eve of the
Stanford Players' production of "The Alchemist," which opens
Thursday in Memorial Auditorium.
Jonson's theory of "humor" held that comedy must have a

purpose: to display vice and folly
and thus teach good behavior.
'"But, says Loper, "if his practice
followed his preaching we would
never produce Jonson. There are
all too many didactic playwrights
today."
The real appeal of such plays as
"The Alchemist," according to Lo
per, lies in "their tremendous en
ergy and their chaotic view of nature
and of life. It is for this we enjoy
them, not any moral edification.
"In 'The Alchemist,' for instance,
the chief villain is never punished.
And the play's one honest character,
Surly, only gets fleeced for his
troubles."
Jonson's own life corresponded
rather more to that of his characters
than the rational, temperate ideal he
preached.
Early in his career he killed a
fellow actor in a duel. And in IGOS
he was jailed for writing a play that
ridiculed the king. "'A most un
rational act," Loper comments.
Starred in the Stanford Players'
production arc Thomas Luce as
Subtle, the phony alchemist; David
O'Brien as Face, the dishonest but
ler who is a party to his devious
undertakings; and Astrid Willsrud
as Doll, the prostitute who lures the
unwitting in.
Tickets arc still available at. the
Memorial Hall box office from 12:.".0
to p.m. All seats are $1. The
show runs through Saturday.
