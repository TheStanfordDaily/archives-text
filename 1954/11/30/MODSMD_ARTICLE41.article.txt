### EDA MENDELS 
To spark the clothing and book
drive which will be conducted in
campus residences dui'ing dead
week and finals week. Miss Amtesli
war Singh from India explained the
work of World University Service to
living group representatives yester
day.
She pointed out that the differ
ence in material standards causes a
difference in levels of thinking be
tween American and Asian students.
While students here can think al
most exclusively of social events and
school, students in Asia have to
worry about where their next meal
will come from, Miss Singh sug
gested.
"In spite of their impoverished
conditions, Indian students do not
want to accept charity. They will
appreciate the American gifts of
books and clothing greatly if they
know that the American students
have the recipients' welfare at heart
and know why they give," Miss
Singh said.
World University Service, as in
termediary between donor and re
cipient, distributes the collected ar
ticles.
To Geneva, WUS headquarters,
come the gifts of money and goods
donated in 36 countries. "WUS can
see from within the country and
send the contributions where they
can do the most good," she ex
plained.
