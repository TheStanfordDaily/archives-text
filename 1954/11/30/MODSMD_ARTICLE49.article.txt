# Student Firemen Perform Varied Duties on Campus
## 
### JIM PALMER 
Their lives geared to the sound of a horn, Stanford's student
firemen stand ready 24-hours a day to serve the campus in various
roles as guardians of the common welfare.
The penetrating blast of the horn atop the Firehouse sends the
crew into action. It may be a call to a fire, or it may be an appeal

to rescue a cat from a tree, a person
from under a building, or a victim
of asphyxia.
If the call comes in the night, the
firemen hustle out of bed, pull on
their pants, and slide down the slip
pery pole. Grabbing their hats and
coats, they are off with a siren blast
and a flash of red light to what may
be a serious fire or just another
false alarm.
If the horn sounds during the day,
the firemen report from their classes
either to the firehouse or to the
scene of the fire, whichever is closer.
FIRE CHIEF MARSTON
In charge of all the excitement is
amiable Fire Chief John Marston,
whose philosophy is. "Every time we
go out the door it means trouble for
someone else; when business is good
for us it is bad for everyone else."
The Stanford Fire Department
was one of America's first college
owned fire protection organizations
manned by students. That was back
in 1932 when University officials de
cided to employ a number of stu
dents to enable them to help pay
their way through college during the
depression.
Today's crew consists of 14 stu
dents, five full - time professional
firemen, and the chief. The students
live on the second floor of the wood
frame Firehouse building, and re
ceive $20 a month and free laundry,
in addition to their rooms.
Divided into two shifts, the fire
men spend every other night on
duty, including the weekends. On
Saturdays and Sundays the students
man the Firehouse on a 24 - hour
basis while the regulars are off.
PREPARATORY DRILLS
Drills are held once a week when
students are taught fire - fighting
techniques and how to operate cer
tain pieces of equipment, including
the department's four fire trucks.
The success of the program can be
found in the low total of the Uni
versity's fire losses and the fact that
not a single person has been seri
ously injured in campus fires over
the years. "And there has never
been a serious fire at Encina Hall,"
Chief Marston adds modestly.
Fire department functions include
fire prevention, rescue work, first
aid, fire fighting, fire alarm super

vision, protection of buildings and
occupants, training, investigation of
fires, salvage work, repairs, and
maintenance of equipment. In addi
tion there is the battling of grass,
brush, and premature bonfire blazes.
A BUSY YEAR
All of this adds up to a busy year
for the Firehouse men, who in addi
tion maintain a high scholastic aver
age, field an intramural team, and
put together prize-winning floats.
Financial need plays a large part
in the selection of student firemen.
Prospects file applications with the
chief, who says "there arc always 25
or 30 on the waiting list."
Chief Marston is a veteran fire
man and former chief of the Bel
mont Fire Department, comihg to
Stanford in 1942. Since then the
department has made notable ad- j
vances by obtaining three modern
trucks and a two-way radio hookup
between all the department's ve
hicles and other county fire and po
lice units.
FIRST ENGINE IN 1883
The fire department dates back to
1883 when Leland Stanford bought a
hand-pumping engine from Boston
for protection of his stock farms.
The ancient engine now stands in
the Museum .
In 1890, a full year before Stan
ford opened, water mains were be
ing installed and a number of two
wheeled, hand - drawn carts popu
lated the campus.
The department was motorized in
1913 with the acquisition of a Cadil
lac hose wagon and a "Model T"
Ford chemical truck. Then in 1932,
the student program was developed.
The present equipment includes a
pumper with a capacity of 750 gal- j
lons per minute, a 1,000-gallon tank j
truck, a tank and rescue truck with ;
pumping at 750 gallons per minute, j
a ladder truck, and the chief's car.
WATER SUPPLY
On campus there are 31 fire alarm
boxes and 152 hydrants. Water is
supplied from two reservoirs owned j
by the University through 12-inch
mains from Searsville Lake and Felt
Lake, in addition to an emergency
supply system.

ford opened, water mains were be
ing installed and a number of two
wheeled, hand - drawn carts popu
lated the campus.
The department was motorized in
1913 with the acquisition of a Cadil
lac hose wagon and a "Model T"
Ford chemical truck. Then in 1932,
the student program was developed.
The present equipment includes a
pumper with a capacity of 750 gal- j
lons per minute, a 1,000-gallon tank j
truck, a tank and rescue truck with ;
pumping at 750 gallons per minute, j
a ladder truck, and the chief's car.
WATER SUPPLY
On campus there are 31 fire alarm
boxes and 152 hydrants. Water is
supplied from two reservoirs owned j
by the University through 12-inch
mains from Searsville Lake and Felt
Lake, in addition to an emergency
supply system.
Their lives geared to the sound of a horn, Stanford's student
firemen stand ready 24-hours a day to serve the campus in various
roles as guardians of the common welfare.
The penetrating blast of the horn atop the Firehouse sends the
crew into action. It may be a call to a fire, or it may be an appeal

to rescue a cat from a tree, a person
from under a building, or a victim
of asphyxia.
If the call comes in the night, the
firemen hustle out of bed, pull on
their pants, and slide down the slip
pery pole. Grabbing their hats and
coats, they are off with a siren blast
and a flash of red light to what may
be a serious fire or just another
false alarm.
If the horn sounds during the day,
the firemen report from their classes
either to the firehouse or to the
scene of the fire, whichever is closer.
FIRE CHIEF MARSTON
In charge of all the excitement is
amiable Fire Chief John Marston,
whose philosophy is. "Every time we
go out the door it means trouble for
someone else; when business is good
for us it is bad for everyone else."
The Stanford Fire Department
was one of America's first college
owned fire protection organizations
manned by students. That was back
in 1932 when University officials de
cided to employ a number of stu
dents to enable them to help pay
their way through college during the
depression.
Today's crew consists of 14 stu
dents, five full - time professional
firemen, and the chief. The students
live on the second floor of the wood
frame Firehouse building, and re
ceive $20 a month and free laundry,
in addition to their rooms.
Divided into two shifts, the fire
men spend every other night on
duty, including the weekends. On
Saturdays and Sundays the students
man the Firehouse on a 24 - hour
basis while the regulars are off.
PREPARATORY DRILLS
Drills are held once a week when
students are taught fire - fighting
techniques and how to operate cer
tain pieces of equipment, including
the department's four fire trucks.
The success of the program can be
found in the low total of the Uni
versity's fire losses and the fact that
not a single person has been seri
ously injured in campus fires over
the years. "And there has never
been a serious fire at Encina Hall,"
Chief Marston adds modestly.
Fire department functions include
fire prevention, rescue work, first
aid, fire fighting, fire alarm super

vision, protection of buildings and
occupants, training, investigation of
fires, salvage work, repairs, and
maintenance of equipment. In addi
tion there is the battling of grass,
brush, and premature bonfire blazes.
A BUSY YEAR
All of this adds up to a busy year
for the Firehouse men, who in addi
tion maintain a high scholastic aver
age, field an intramural team, and
put together prize-winning floats.
Financial need plays a large part
in the selection of student firemen.
Prospects file applications with the
chief, who says "there arc always 25
or 30 on the waiting list."
Chief Marston is a veteran fire
man and former chief of the Bel
mont Fire Department, comihg to
Stanford in 1942. Since then the
department has made notable ad- j
vances by obtaining three modern
trucks and a two-way radio hookup
between all the department's ve
hicles and other county fire and po
lice units.

age, field an intramural team, and

Financial need plays a large part
in the selection of student firemen.
Prospects file applications with the
chief, who says "there arc always 25
or 30 on the waiting list."
Chief Marston is a veteran fire
man and former chief of the Bel
mont Fire Department, comihg to
Stanford in 1942. Since then the
department has made notable ad- j
vances by obtaining three modern
trucks and a two-way radio hookup
between all the department's ve
hicles and other county fire and po
lice units.
FIRST ENGINE IN 1883
The fire department dates back to
1883 when Leland Stanford bought a
hand-pumping engine from Boston
for protection of his stock farms.
The ancient engine now stands in
the Museum .
In 1890, a full year before Stan
ford opened, water mains were be
ing installed and a number of two
wheeled, hand - drawn carts popu
lated the campus.
The department was motorized in
1913 with the acquisition of a Cadil
lac hose wagon and a "Model T"
Ford chemical truck. Then in 1932,
the student program was developed.
The present equipment includes a
pumper with a capacity of 750 gal- j
lons per minute, a 1,000-gallon tank j
truck, a tank and rescue truck with ;
pumping at 750 gallons per minute, j
a ladder truck, and the chief's car.
WATER SUPPLY
On campus there are 31 fire alarm
boxes and 152 hydrants. Water is
supplied from two reservoirs owned j
by the University through 12-inch
mains from Searsville Lake and Felt
Lake, in addition to an emergency
supply system.
