# New Liquor Board Control Is Topic at Political Union
## 
### MARY ELLEN ROMNEY 
Why a new liquor administration?
"Gross administration breakdown in the Board of Equalization," j
said Assemblyman Caspar W. Weinberger, speaking last night
at a Stanford Political Union meeting.
"We didn't recommend a change for the sake of a clean, new

administration, but because an irre- +
sponsible system was working spec
tacularly badly."
Weinberger headed the Joint Sub-,
committee on Alcoholic Control,
whose report led Governor Knight
to call last winter's special legisla
tive session. The result of their ac
tion was the constitutional amend
ment approved by California voters
last fall as Proposition 3.
Following' Weinberger's address,
Rex Kramer was introduced as the
new president of the Union, replac
ing Bill Fundenberg who is leaving
for the service. Kramer is presently
vice-president.
Dianne Goldman, ASSU vice
president, listed independence, so
cial pressure, and companionship as
three complicating factors in campus
drinking in her student presentation
of the liquor control topic. "It is up
to the students to find a constructive
approach to this highly controver
sial problem," she stated.
BACKGROUND OF TOPIC
Weinberger began his address
with the background of the liquor
administration. California's liquor
administration was found to be
unique in several respects: not only
was it one of the few states with
elective liquor heads, but it is the
only legitimate industry in Califor
nia regulated by an elected board.
The system suffered from the evils
inherent in an elective system, and
an outmoded one at that, Weinber
ger continued. "It would be hard to
imagine a system further removed
from public opinion and public reg
ulation. Public opinion, the Gov
ernor, and the Legislature were
powerless against the Board of
Equalization." And since the BOE
was often elected by as few as 17
per cent of the voting public, the

liquor industry was given a chance
to control the board which was sup
posed to control it.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Wh;tl did Weinberger's committee I
recommend? Nothing radical—just
a simple administrative plan, pat
terned after many existing state de
partments. "Nothing new or untried
is in this amendment," h? stated. "A ;
Department of Alcoholic Beverage 1
Control is to be established, headed
by an appointive director and four
deputies, all appointed by and re
sponsible to the Governor."
An appeals board is provided for, '
to prevent establishment of a "liquor j
czar," and modified impeachment by j
the Legislature is possible as a fur- |
ther safeguard.
Weinberger concluded his talk |
with examples of lax enforcement j
uncovered by his committee during
their investigations.
In the Los Angeles area, he il
lustrated, wide-open taverns were
repeatedly licensed despite vice,
narcotics, B-girl, and other moral I
crimes.

tive session. The result of their ac
tion was the constitutional amend
ment approved by California voters
last fall as Proposition 3.
Following' Weinberger's address,
Rex Kramer was introduced as the
new president of the Union, replac
ing Bill Fundenberg who is leaving
for the service. Kramer is presently
vice-president.
Dianne Goldman, ASSU vice
president, listed independence, so
cial pressure, and companionship as
three complicating factors in campus
drinking in her student presentation
of the liquor control topic. "It is up
to the students to find a constructive
approach to this highly controver
sial problem," she stated.
BACKGROUND OF TOPIC
Weinberger began his address
with the background of the liquor
administration. California's liquor
administration was found to be
unique in several respects: not only
was it one of the few states with
elective liquor heads, but it is the
only legitimate industry in Califor
nia regulated by an elected board.
The system suffered from the evils
inherent in an elective system, and
an outmoded one at that, Weinber
ger continued. "It would be hard to
imagine a system further removed
from public opinion and public reg
ulation. Public opinion, the Gov
ernor, and the Legislature were
powerless against the Board of
Equalization." And since the BOE
was often elected by as few as 17
per cent of the voting public, the

liquor industry was given a chance
to control the board which was sup
posed to control it.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Wh;tl did Weinberger's committee I
recommend? Nothing radical—just
a simple administrative plan, pat
terned after many existing state de
partments. "Nothing new or untried
is in this amendment," h? stated. "A ;
Department of Alcoholic Beverage 1
Control is to be established, headed
by an appointive director and four
deputies, all appointed by and re
sponsible to the Governor."
An appeals board is provided for, '
to prevent establishment of a "liquor j
czar," and modified impeachment by j
the Legislature is possible as a fur- |
ther safeguard.
Weinberger concluded his talk |
with examples of lax enforcement j
uncovered by his committee during
their investigations.
In the Los Angeles area, he il
lustrated, wide-open taverns were
repeatedly licensed despite vice,
narcotics, B-girl, and other moral I
crimes.

Why a new liquor administration?
"Gross administration breakdown in the Board of Equalization," j
said Assemblyman Caspar W. Weinberger, speaking last night
at a Stanford Political Union meeting.
"We didn't recommend a change for the sake of a clean, new

administration, but because an irre- +
sponsible system was working spec
tacularly badly."
Weinberger headed the Joint Sub-,
committee on Alcoholic Control,
whose report led Governor Knight
to call last winter's special legisla
tive session. The result of their ac
tion was the constitutional amend
ment approved by California voters
last fall as Proposition 3.
