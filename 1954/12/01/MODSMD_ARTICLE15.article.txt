# Excom to Study Executive Part Of Constitution
## 
### 
The Executive Committee will
begin 'discussion tonight on the
executive branch on the pro
posed ASSU Constitution.
Scheduled for last week, con
sideration of the executive
branch was put off for a week
when Excom became involved
in debating the judiciary section.
Sections to be brought up tonight
are those dealing with ASSU elected
officers (president, vice-president,
and head cheer leader). Cabinet, ad
ministrative boards, and commis
sions.
The main additions to the presi
dential duties will deal with his re
lations with the Legislature. The
Legislature, to be considered next,
quarter, will be a 28- to 32-man
group composed of representatives
from several areas of student life.
Thr president will be chairman of
the Legislature, and will present to
it his annua] budget and program.
The duties of the vice-president
and head cheer leader will remain
unchanged under the proposed con
stitution.
The most striking change in the
executive branch is the formation of
a Cabinet. r lhe Cabinet is designed
to advise the president on student
government and its programs and to
assist him on other executive mat
ters.
The Cabinet will be made up of
the president and vice-president of
ASSU, the presidents of the admin
istrative boards, the five class presi
dents, Men's and Women's Council
representatives, and other officers as
thr By-Laws may direct.
Administrative boards and coin
missions which may be established
by the Legislature will also be con
sidered.
