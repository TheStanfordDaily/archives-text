BOWMAN ADDITION—Work is well under way lor the 551.000 addition to Bowman Alumni
House. The 25x90-foot wing will house a committee room, alumni magazine office, women's
lounge, and a storage-workroom. The new addition will be joined to Bowman House by a
glassed-in passageway. Present plans call for the completion of the project within four months.
