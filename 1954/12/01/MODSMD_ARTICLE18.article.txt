# Health Report Gives Records Of Farm Ills
## 
### 
Bad water at a Dormer Sum
mit skiing party accounted for
more than one fifth of all cases
!of communicable disease re-
I ported in the Stanford com
, munity last year, according to
the Stanford Public Health Serv
ice's annual report for 1953-54,
released yesterday.
Altogether, the Public Health
Service received reports of 392 cases
of communicable disease among
Stanford students, employees, and
others for the four quarters ending
in August. Eighty-two persons suf
fered gastrointestinal upsets on the
Donner trip.
But the Donner total amounted to
less than half of the total of 187 in
cidents of gastrointestinal upsets re
corded; varieties of stomach ache
claimed more victims than did
chickenpox (s(i), influenza (55),
measles (42), and German measles
(25) combined.
Comparative figures seem to indi
cate that the Stanford community
was slightly healthier in 1953-54 than
in 1952-53; discounting gastrointes
tinal upsets, which were not re
corded in 1952-53, the total incidence
of communicable disease showed a
decline of nine from 1952-53 to 1953-
54.
MORE MEASLES
Biggest changes were marked in
creases in incidence of chickenpox,
influenza, and measles, a decline in
cases of m,umps, and an enormous
drop—from 115 cases in 1952-53 to
25 in 1953-54—in incidence of Ger
man measles.
Highest incidence of disease was
in winter quarter; 200 cases were re
ported in January, February, and
March, 1954.
One male student was stricken
with poliomyelitis but recovered
without paralysis; there was no sec
ondary case among the contacts.
Routine X-raying of food-handlers
disclosed one active case of tuber
cuolsis. Three man students also
suffered attacks of TB; all four eases
were hospitalized promptly, accord
ing to the report.
ONE SQUIRREL DIED
The incidence of animal bites at.
Stanford in 1953-54 totaled two. Hu
man beings emerged from these en
counters in good health, but. the ani
mals involved suffered a 50 per cent
mortality rate. Commented the Pub
lic Health Service in its report:
"One squirrel at Stanford Village
. . . had been handled by a number
of children, and had bitten a mother
who picked it. up.. Hie squirrel died
while being held for observation."
Further, "a pel monkey at one of
j the fraternity houses bit a visitor.
i The animal was held for observation
for two weeks, and released in good
health."

corded in 1952-53, the total incidence
of communicable disease showed a
decline of nine from 1952-53 to 1953-
54.
MORE MEASLES
Biggest changes were marked in
creases in incidence of chickenpox,
influenza, and measles, a decline in
cases of m,umps, and an enormous
drop—from 115 cases in 1952-53 to
25 in 1953-54—in incidence of Ger
man measles.
Highest incidence of disease was
in winter quarter; 200 cases were re
ported in January, February, and
March, 1954.
One male student was stricken
with poliomyelitis but recovered
without paralysis; there was no sec
ondary case among the contacts.
Routine X-raying of food-handlers
disclosed one active case of tuber
cuolsis. Three man students also
suffered attacks of TB; all four eases
were hospitalized promptly, accord
ing to the report.
ONE SQUIRREL DIED
The incidence of animal bites at.
Stanford in 1953-54 totaled two. Hu
man beings emerged from these en
counters in good health, but. the ani
mals involved suffered a 50 per cent
mortality rate. Commented the Pub
lic Health Service in its report:
"One squirrel at Stanford Village
. . . had been handled by a number
of children, and had bitten a mother
who picked it. up.. Hie squirrel died
while being held for observation."
Further, "a pel monkey at one of
j the fraternity houses bit a visitor.
i The animal was held for observation
for two weeks, and released in good
health."
Bad water at a Dormer Sum
mit skiing party accounted for
more than one fifth of all cases
!of communicable disease re-
I ported in the Stanford com
, munity last year, according to
the Stanford Public Health Serv
ice's annual report for 1953-54,
released yesterday.
Altogether, the Public Health
Service received reports of 392 cases
of communicable disease among
Stanford students, employees, and
others for the four quarters ending
in August. Eighty-two persons suf
fered gastrointestinal upsets on the
Donner trip.
But the Donner total amounted to
less than half of the total of 187 in
cidents of gastrointestinal upsets re
corded; varieties of stomach ache
claimed more victims than did
chickenpox (s(i), influenza (55),
measles (42), and German measles
(25) combined.
Comparative figures seem to indi
cate that the Stanford community
was slightly healthier in 1953-54 than
in 1952-53; discounting gastrointes
tinal upsets, which were not re
corded in 1952-53, the total incidence
of communicable disease showed a
decline of nine from 1952-53 to 1953-
54.
