# ATO Wins Trophy For Scholarship; Rush Budget Set
## 
### 
Alpha Tau Omega was awarded
the Jud Crary trophy for the great
est scholarship improvement during
the 1953-54 academic year at last
night's Interfratemity Council meet
ing.
The ATO's rose from 22nd to third
place in the fraternity grade rank
ings last year. House president
Rich Scramaglia accepted the trophy
for ATO.
At the meeting the IFC estab
lished a $700 limit per house for
rushing expenditures from the be
ginning of open houses Jan. 5 until
pledge signing Jan. 15. This budget
limit is over and above any addi
tional kitchen expenses caused by
rushing.
The Council imposed the limit in
order to equalize to some extent the
rushing activities of Stanford frater
nities. The IFC felt that for most
houses to try to compete with the
few houses which could afford to
spend in the thousands would mean
financial ruin.
In other business, the IFC author
ized Bob Smith, chairman of the
.social committee, to do his best to
schedule an all - fraternity formal
dance for Feb. 4. The dance would
be a large-scale, "big-name band"
production like the Military Ball.
