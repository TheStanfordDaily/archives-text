# Sir Winston Is Honored at 80
## 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 30 (UP) - Britain gave Winston Churchill an
80th birthday of roaring acclaim and unprecedented honors to
day. The doughty old warrior told a resplendent crowd in historic
Westminster Hall, "There has never been anything like it in
British history." He said it was "the most memorable occasion
of my life."
The pomp and pageantry of a nation which has practiced it

for centuries were brought to bear
on the mass tribute to a man who
admitted he was "now nearing the
end of my journey" but hoped "I
still have some services'to render."
Around the world distinguished
men and other people joined Brit
ons in honoring Churchill. Gifts and
greetings Hooded in by the thou
[ sands—cables, telegrams, postcards,
letters, from President Eisenhower,
former President Truman, Marshal
Tito, royalty and prime ministers, a
factory hand, and an Australian
sheepherder.
Tonight it was disclosed that a
check presented to Churchill was for
1! 150,000 ($420,000) —the sum of the
separate gifts of money.
BIRTHDAY TRUST
Churchill let it be known that hp
planned to use it to form a "Winston
Churchill Birthday Trust," a chari
table trust which will endow his
home, Chartwell, as a museum con
! taining relics and mementos of his
life.
"In the evening of my life,"
Churchill wrote Lord Moynihan,
president of the fund set up, "the
good will shown to me by so many
friends, tjie vast majority of whom
I have met, stirs my heart."
By coincidence it also was the day
of the state opening of Parliament.
Queen Elizabeth, grave and stately
in white and silver lace gown, long
ermine and velvmet train, and the
2i/ 2 - pound imperial state crown,
presided in the House of Lords.
QUEEN SPEAKS
Peers in scarlet robes, pages and
heralds smothered in gold, judges in
wigs, bishops in black blended in the
traditional turnout.
The Queen's speech, written for
. ,her hy Churchill and the cabinet,
sketched the government's program
for the coming year. She said the
strengthening of relations with the
United States was of "the highest
importance." On foreign affairs, shr
said Britain would develop a stra
tegic reserve of atomic-age troops,
and pledge full support for the ac
cord on German rearmament.
But it was Churchill's day. After
the {state opening of Parliament,
both Houses went to the nearby
Westminster Hall for the climactic
formality of the birthday celebra
tion.

WINSTON CHURCHILL
—Celebrates 80th birthday
LONDON, Nov. 30 (UP) - Britain gave Winston Churchill an
80th birthday of roaring acclaim and unprecedented honors to
day. The doughty old warrior told a resplendent crowd in historic
Westminster Hall, "There has never been anything like it in
British history." He said it was "the most memorable occasion
of my life."
The pomp and pageantry of a nation which has practiced it

for centuries were brought to bear
on the mass tribute to a man who
admitted he was "now nearing the
end of my journey" but hoped "I
still have some services'to render."
Around the world distinguished
men and other people joined Brit
ons in honoring Churchill. Gifts and
greetings Hooded in by the thou
[ sands—cables, telegrams, postcards,
letters, from President Eisenhower,
former President Truman, Marshal
Tito, royalty and prime ministers, a
factory hand, and an Australian
sheepherder.
Tonight it was disclosed that a
check presented to Churchill was for
1! 150,000 ($420,000) —the sum of the
separate gifts of money.
BIRTHDAY TRUST
Churchill let it be known that hp
planned to use it to form a "Winston
Churchill Birthday Trust," a chari
table trust which will endow his
home, Chartwell, as a museum con
! taining relics and mementos of his
life.
"In the evening of my life,"
Churchill wrote Lord Moynihan,
president of the fund set up, "the
good will shown to me by so many
friends, tjie vast majority of whom
I have met, stirs my heart."
By coincidence it also was the day
of the state opening of Parliament.
Queen Elizabeth, grave and stately
in white and silver lace gown, long
ermine and velvmet train, and the
2i/ 2 - pound imperial state crown,
presided in the House of Lords.
QUEEN SPEAKS
Peers in scarlet robes, pages and
heralds smothered in gold, judges in
wigs, bishops in black blended in the
traditional turnout.
The Queen's speech, written for
. ,her hy Churchill and the cabinet,
sketched the government's program
for the coming year. She said the
strengthening of relations with the
United States was of "the highest
importance." On foreign affairs, shr
said Britain would develop a stra
tegic reserve of atomic-age troops,
and pledge full support for the ac
cord on German rearmament.
