# How About the Men?
## 
### 
To be or not to be informal at the Post Office,
Cellar, and Bookstore— was the question
asked of Stanford women in their Monday night
house meetings.
The results will not be announced until to
morrow, so that the opinions of the off-campus
women may be included.
However this issue of women's dress stand
ards on campus comes out, we commend the
process, and the system that makes it possible,
for the wisdom of finding out exactly what the
majority of the women themselves consider
proper. There is no better way of producing
rebellion than by saying "You must," and no
better way of getting obedience and respect for
a rule than by having those whom it will gov
ern write it and ratify it.
Only one thought, and one recurring sight,
interrupt our admiration of the job the Asso
ciated Women Students is doing in this field.
The men. Most of them are adequately, if not
well, dressed.
But how about the whacked-off blues and
khakis they dignify with the name of Bermuda
shorts which frequent the Post Office and Cel
lar in warmer weather? And the shirtless gents

who arrive with spring quarter, followed by
men clad in swim trunks and shoes (of sorts,
sometimes) who look so comfortably cool, but
so bare?
We suggest that parents, friends, and tour
ists who wander around the campus notice the
attire of two-thirds of the student body—the
men—as well as the women. Is it possible,
then, that there should be a corresponding set
of dress standards for the men? We think such
standards should at least be considered.
While we have our necks out, may we sug
gest one thing more? Troublesome matters
such as dress standards, general policies, and
anything else that concerns all the women oi
Stanford are handled by AWS.
But what happens to issues and problems that
concern the men as a whole? The Executive
Committee must take time out from their con
sideration of student body affairs to discuss
matters important only to the men.
And so, gentlemen of Stanford, may we sug
gest an Associated Men Student organiza
tion? To be run by you, for you, and with only
your best interests at heart? It's not radical,
and might even be sensible.
