# Salute to a Statesman
## 
### 
The number one statesman of the world cele
brated his 80th birthday yesterday.
Surrounded by government officials and per
sonal friends, deluged by letters and telegrams
from thousands of persons around the globe,
he spent the day at the address he has made
famousâ€”No. 10 Downing Street.
Perhaps no man of our time has so captured
the affection and esteem of the world's peoples
as has this indomitable leader of the British na
tion. He is not himself an ordinary man. But he

is the unchallenged spokesman for all "ordi
nary" men, for their freedom, their courage,
their dignity.
In time of war, his was the voice which
sounded the democratic call to victory.
In the uncertainty of peace, his is the wise
counsel which directs the free world toward a
more stable future.
We join with human beings everywhere to
salute the eloquent, matchless Man of the Half-
Century Winston Churchill.
