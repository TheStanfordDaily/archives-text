# A 						Challenge
## 
### 
Indignant, angry words are being heaped
upon Communist China by numerous persons
in several countries at the recent imprisoning
of 13 Americans as spies.
In the United States, Britain, and Europe men
are condemning this action as another example
of the Communist disregard for justice and
contempt for freedom. Cries of "retaliation"
and "blockade" rise from some government
officials, and once again the Asian cold war
grows hotter.
Although we bitterly denounce the fraudu
lent sentencing of fellow American citizens,
. we are pleased that the United States is com
mitted to "exhaust all peaceful means" for
dealing with China rather than resorting im

mediately to a coastal blockade or war.
Nothing is more trying to the American con
science than to watch innocent persons perse
cuted and imprisoned. Yet nothing would be
more senseless than for the United States to
react emotionally and plunge the world into
another all-out war.
Secretary of State Dulles has stated that the
United States will lay its case before the United
Nations and seek the release of the 13 men with
out endangering international peace. Should
all such efforts "short of war" fail, the United
States will then turn to sterner methods.
This is a great challenge for the United Na
tions. We ardently hope that the challenge will
be met.
