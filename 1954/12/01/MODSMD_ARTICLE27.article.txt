# Museum Features Chinese Art Exhibition of Manchu Dynasty
## 
### 
How ancient China was led to
new heights of art and culture
by its barbaric Tartar conquer
ors, "The Magnificent Man
chus," is the theme of a new ex
hibition which opened Sunday
at the Museum.
Many spectacular examples of
what an expert describes as "the un
imaginable splendor of the last glo
rious flowering of the art of China"
have been assembled for the exhibi
tion. Valued at half a million dol
lars, they comprise the most impor
tant showing of Manchu art ever
seen in the West.
"The Magnificent Manchus" is the
first major show presented this sea
son by the Committee for Art, ac
cording to Mrs. Louis Sloss of San
Francisco, committee vice-chairman.
Director of the exhibition is John La
Plante, the Museum's curator of
Oriental art.
A special exhibition catalog has
been prepared, and regular guided
tours will be conducted by commit
tee members and volunteers over a
two-mOnth period. The show will
remain open to the public from 1 to
5 p.m., daily except Tuesdays, until
Feb. 5.
Loans have been obtained for the
exhibition from many of the nation's
finest private collections and mu
seums, said La Plante. Among them
are a porcelain altar set and a pair
of jars from the Hyn. Herbert Hoo
ver.
Probably the rarest and most in
teresting exhibit, though not the
work of a Chinese, will be 12 paint
ings by Giuseppe Castiglione. Only
30 of his paintings still exist.
Castiglione was an Italian Jesuit
priest who became the favorite court
painter of Ch'ien Lung, fourth em
peror of the Ch'ing dynasty.
Perhaps the show's most bizarre
work of art is the 18th century, "air
conditioner" from the collection of
the late Mrs. Eleanor Carlisle, lent
by Alma Carlisle of San Francisco.
It consists of a large box made of
laminated strips of bamboo, sandal
wood, and birch. The box rests on
a teakwood base, and the whole is
profusely decorated with cloisonne
enamel. When ice was placed inside,
grillwork in the cover permitted air
to circulate and cool the room.
Rare porcelains and ceramics,
royal court robes woven of silk and
gold in unbelievably fine detail,
gold - embroidered wall hangings,
jewelry, and delicate court head
dresses studded with gems are
among the many other art objects
on display.
