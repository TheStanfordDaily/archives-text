## Frosh Cagers 'Best Ever' 
### BOB MIEROW 
"We have a very promising fresh
man basketball team this year," dis
closed frosh hoop coach Dick Clegg.
The freshman mentrtr is especially
pleased with the rebounding ability
and scoring potential of his cagers.
The Papooses open their season
Friday night against the USF Frosh.
Coach Clegg rates the Dons as one
of the two toughest opponents that
his charges will face this yea>\ Cal's
freshman club is picked by the frosh
mentor as the other most difficult
opposition for the Papooses.
PROBABLE STARTING LINEUP
Coach Clegg has named a prob
able starting lineup for Friday
night's encounter with the Dons. Jay
Jackson and Mike Gray will open at
the forward spots, Dean Thomas and
Tony Vigna will start at guard, with
Clint Waring at center. This crew
averages 6-2 in height and also shows
a great deal of speed.
Jay Jackson, the tallest member of
the starting squad at 6-5, played his
high school ball in Fortuna. Jack
son is an excellent offensive player,
and is one of the Papooses' out
standing rebounders.
His running mate at forward, Mike
Gray, hails from Claremont where
he was CIF small-school player of
the year. Gray, twice high scorer
in his league, stands 6-3.
Center Clint Waring, who is 6-4
and weighs 205, is one of the top re
bounders on the club. Waring played
his prep ball at Stockton High where
he was All-San Joaquin Valley for
two years. Waring was voted most
valuable player of that circuit last
season.
Speedy little Dean Thomas, 5-10,
hails from Hollywood High. Tony
Vigna, 6-1 eager from Gilroy, is an
aggressive ball-hawk and a fine shot.
OTHER HOOPSTERS LISTED
Other frosh hoopsters who are ex
pected to see action Friday night are
Pete LaChapelle, an All-Stater from
Denver. Colorado; Eric Anderson,
All-PAL at Willow Glen last year;
Lee Leonard, 6-7 center from Red
ding; and Dwight Doerr, a team
mate of Waring last season at Stock
ton.
Rounding out the team are Bob
Johnson, all-Valley at Madera, Tom
Dyer, Buzz Hoever, Wally Honey
well, Pete Mansfield, Roland Rein
holdt, Harding Roe, Jerry Rose, and
Gary VanGalder.
"The strong points of this year's
frosh are the depth of the squad, our
height and rebounding ability, and
the scoring potential," states Clegg.
"Our present weakness is that we
have not played together long
enough to work well as a team."
