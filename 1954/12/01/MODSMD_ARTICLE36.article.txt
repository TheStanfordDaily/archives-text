# Jack Frost Will Head Promising Tennis Team
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Although at this time of the year not many people would con
sider tennis very seriously, there is a group of men on campus
who take it with deadly seriousness.
Coach Bob Renker is busy laying the groundwork for what
promises to be the best Stanford tennis squad in recent years. The

team could be very good this spring,
and will be even better in a year's
time.
Looming largest in Renker's plans
is Jack Frost. A stocky, power
hitting, right-hander from Monte
rey, Frost was ranked 21st in the
nation last year and should be placed
among the top ten players this year
on the basis of his fine performance
this summer.
While playing the circuit during
the summer Frost scored quite a few
impressive victories over top-flight
opposition. He surprised the tennis
world with his 2-6, (5-3. 6-4 upset
over Vic Sexias, who is second na
tionally. However, he turned in oth
er very fine games, too. These in
clude wins over Straight Clark and
Luis Ayala and narrow losses to
Lewis Hoad and Owen Williams.
Renker calls Frost the best player
he has coached, and says that he has
the potential to become a very ex
cellent player.
Working with Frost to form a
very potent one-two punch will be
Ernie Dußray, a former Card tennis
player back from tho army with
two year's eligibility. The experi
enced Dußray will be a steadying
influence on the young team.
The team will have good depth
for once with Frost and Dußray
backed up by Dave Duff, Henry Sut
cliffe, Bob Norton, Roger Keesing,
Bob Prince, and Mackey Wirth.
Renker currently rates these six on
about an equal basis, with Phil
Hogue and Dennis Wetterholm not
far behind.


JACK FROST
—A future great
