# Physics Profs Tell of Linear Accelerator

### JOANNE OLSON 
Stanford's elecuon linear ac
celerator—its structure and its
use in nuclear research—was ex
plained by Professors Edward L.
Ginzton and Wolfgang K. H.
Panofsky in a Tuesday Evening
Series lecture last night in Me
morial Auditorium.
Ginzton explained the principle on
which the linear acelerator operates
by analogy with a surfboard. A hoy
on a surfboard will simply bob up
and down if his board is on the
crest of a wave, he pointed out, "but
if he is clever enough to adjust his
position so that he is on the down
ward slope of the wave, he will be
accelerated toward the shore by the
motion of the wave."
The wave on which the electron
rides is a high-energy radio wave
traveling down the inside of a long
pipe-
Electrons, the negatively charged
components of atoms, arc actually
accelerated in radio or television
tubes. Ginzton said, but these tubes
can impart only small accelerations.
For purposes of research the elec
trons must be speeded up to ve
locities approaching that of light.
lIIGII ENERGY SUPPLY
No ordinary radio transmitter can
provide waves of high enough en
ergy to give such an acceleration.
A power supply, called the klystron,
which will produce these waves was
developed by the late Professor Wil
liam W. Hansen and the Varian
brothers, and Ls now used in the
linear acelerator.
The pipe down which the electron
travels is 220 feet long. In the first
few feet of the pipe, Ginzton said,
the electron is accelcratcd to al
most 186,000 miles per second—the
speed of light. According to Ein
stein's theory of relativity, however,
it cannot exceed this .speed and will
.gain mass as it goes down the rest,
of the tube.
ELECTRON'S TRIP
The electron's trip down the pipe
takes only about a millionth of a
second, and at. the end of this time
it is one thousand times as heavy as
when it started.
Professor Panofsky discussed the
uses of the accelerator in nuclear
research. Me stated that the experi
ments now being performed fall into
three general classes: study of the
behavior of elcctrical forces at Inch
energies; study of short-lived par
ticles created in collisions between
high-energy particles and nuclei of
atoms; and study of the size of the
nucleus.
