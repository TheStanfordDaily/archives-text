# Frosh Hear About Clubs, Fraternities, Independents
## 
### BOB DURAND BILL WRIGHT 
The problem of whether to
join an eating club or a fraternity
or to remain independent is
purely a personal one which
must reflect a person's primary
objectives for his years at Stan
ford.
This whs the general opinion ex
pressed by Independent A 1 Brouse,
president of the Institute of Inter
national Relations; Marty Armbrust,
president of the Interclub Council;
and Otis Winters, president of the
Interfraternity Council, in talks to
freshman men in Encina and the
Village last night.
The three men discussed the ad
vantages and disadvantages of club,
fraternity, and independent status to
prepare freshmen for the rushing
season winter quarter.
Richard Balch, chief counselor for
men, also made a short introductory
talk in which he discussed campus
housing facilities for next year.
Balch emphasized .the fact that
Stanford was the only University he
knew of where one had a "freedom
of choice" and was not compelled by
social pressure to join any organiza
tion.
INDEPENDENT VIEWPOINT
Brouse, in his presentation of the
independent viewpoint, pointed out
that the decision involves an in
dividual's outlook toward studies,
extra-curricular activities, social life,
group living, and finances.
"Consider yourself objectively,
consider what you want to do, con
sider how those objectives can best
be reached," Brouse said.
Brouse pledged a fraternity "to
try out the fraternity system to see
if I really liked it"—a policy which
he did not recommend—and then
de-pledged when he decided it was
not what he wanted.
"It was a matter of competitive de
mands," he said. "I felt I could not
devote the time because I was in
terested in campus extra-curricular
activities and a fraternity is its own
extra-curricular activity.
"There is the outlook toward
studies. Here again it is a conflict
of time. The demands of a house
were such that I could not pursue
my studies as I would have liked."
EATING CLUBS
Speaking for the clubs, Armbrust
Kaid, "An Eating Club member can
gain a well-rounded and full Stan
ford education through the program
of his club."
Armbrust began his talk by asking
a question and then answering it
himself. "He asked, "What do men
who come to Stanford expect to get
from their education?"
He said that it was to develop
their personalities and their interest

in school activities, to maintain their
high level of scholastic achievement,
to continue their sports ability, and
to get a diploma.
The ICC president then explained
how the Eating Clubs will help the
individual to achieve these five goals
He stated that the clubs are not
something new and that several col
leges in the East have them exclus
ively. He went on to say that they
were "dining and meeting groups in
which the individual can actively en
gage."
Continuing, he said that club men
have a responsibility like everyone
else. "They must support their org
anization and must be willing to
work for it."
Armbrust emphasized the point
that eating club members arc very
active in all extra-curricular activi
ties.
He concluded his talk by explain
ing the facilities of the clubs, in
cluding the living situation, and by
explaining that each club has a full
schedule of social and athletic ac
tivities.
FRATERNITIES
Winters, before he discussed the
advantages of fraternities, stressed
that joining a fraternity does not
give a Stanford student added pres
tige. "At Stanford we do not wear
fraternity pins. We're proud of that.
The University comes first and the
living croup second."
Winters said, "A very tangible
aspect is the social potential which

a fraternity offers. In addition, there
is a great diversity of talents in a
house from which all the men can
benefit."
Pointing out the positions of re
sponsibility within a house which
are open to the members, Winters
said, "A fraternity is a great proving
ground for leadership."
Among the disadvantages of fra
ternities which Winters named were
the slightly higher costs than in a
University residence, the tendency
for grades to drop, and occasional
need for conformity.
Winters said the fraternities were
striving hard to correct many of the
defects in the system, particularly
the scholastic, financial, and dis
ciplinary aspects.
Winters said that a "yearly re
birth of the fraternity system takes
place right here with the freshman
class" and concluded by saying that
whether fraternity or club member
or independent "it is not where you
live, but how you live" that is im
portant.
