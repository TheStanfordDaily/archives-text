# DISCUSSION...
## Details Bog Excom Meet 
### RUSS WILKS Associate Editor, The Daily 
The Executive Committee of
ASSU after a false start began
discussion on the executive sec
tion of the proposed Constitu
tion as it staggered through its
weekly meeting last evening.
For the third consecutive week
Excom spent most of its time at
tempting to decide which procedure
to follow in deliberating on the Con
stitution.
It reached its peak for time-con
sumption last night as it eventually
set up a pattern of work, started to
follow it, and then threw it out when
it became bogged down with the con
sideration of minute and insignifi
cant details.
Members were in general agree
ment that the Cabinet and all it on
tailed was the main problem in the
executive section. But, as far as
discussion was concerned they
couldn't see where they were going
or how they could get there.
Discussion went on for an hour
with "points of information," "point
of order," "and "out of order" con
tinuously breaking into the wayward
trend of conversation.
Bob Gable, realizing the predica
ment, attempted to get on the right
track as he said, "We have to dis
cuss this thing. (Constitution.) Why
can't we get going? We can go on
all night at this rate."
Jim Flanagan offered, "We're
wasting more time with little de
tails, let's establish what we mean."
Dianne Goldman, vice-president
asked for permission to subscribe the
aid of Tom Bartlett, of the Political
Science Department, who helped
draft the Constitution last year, to
clarify points of the Cabinet that
bother Excom members.
After a total of an hour and half's
discussion Excom finally tabled
further discussion on the Constitu
tion until next quarter when Bart
lett will be able to outline the clear
cut reasons for a Cabinet and its re
lationship with the Legislature.
On the credit side of the evening
Excom strongly voted against at
taching Stanford's name to any sum
mer tour and approved the Consti
tutions of the Camerri Club and
American Society of Chemical En
gineers. Excom will hold a brief
procedural meeting next week to end
the quarter's activity.
