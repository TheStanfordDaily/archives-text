WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 (UP) —
Secretary of State John Foster Dul
les said today the United States
might consider a blockade of Red
China if peaceful means fail to free
Americans imprisoned on "trumped
up" spy charges.
Dulles expressed confidence, how
ever, that peaceful methods would
not fail.
He made the statements at a news
conference after Senators Joseph R.
McCarthy (R„ Wis.) and William E.
Jenner (R., Ind.) had joined Sen
ate Republican Leader William F.
Knowland in demanding a blockade
of the China coast.
Asked whether the U.S. Navy
might be used later to protect the
rights of the 13 Americans impris
oned by the Reds, Dulles said that
certainly is a possibility.
But he reminded reporters of his
speech in Chicago Monday night in
which he said this nation's first duty
is to "exhaust peaceful means"
rather than resorting to war action
such as a naval or air blockade.
If these means fail, Dulles said,
then the United States would have
to reconsider the situation. He added
that he personally has a great deal
of confidence that peaceful methods
will not fail.
Knowland has proposed a naval
blockade of China to cut off all trade
with the Communists until they re
lease all Americans now held behind
the bamboo curtain.
