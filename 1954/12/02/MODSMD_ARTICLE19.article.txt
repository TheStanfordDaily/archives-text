MOSCOW, Dcc. 1 (UP) â€” Red
China joined the Communist drive
against German rearmament today
with an indorsement of Soviet hints
of reprisal.
The Communist Chinese observer
at the Soviet - sponsored European
security conference further told del
egates from eight Red - dominated
European nations that his country
considers the Paris agreements "a
provocational act."
The observer, Chang Wen Tien,
noted that "these peaceful countries
will have to adopt the necessary
measures to protect peace, security,
and their borders."
That was an obvious indorsement
of earlier indications by other dele
gates that the Communist countries
of Eastern Europe will be forced to
set up either a unified command or a
joint military staff if West Germany
is rearmed.
