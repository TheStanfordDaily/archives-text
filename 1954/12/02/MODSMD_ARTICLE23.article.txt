# McCarthy's Censure Is Tentatively Approved
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 (UP)—The Senate voted tentatively to
night to censure Senator Joseph R. McCarthy for abuse of a 1951-
52 Seriate elections subcommittee, and McCarthy conceded he
would be formally rebuked by his colleagues tomorrow.
The Senate approved by a top-heavy 67 to 20 vote the first of

►two censure counts lodged against
the Wisconsin Republican by the
special six-man censure committee,
headed by Senator Arthur V. Wat
kins (R., Utah).
The count, which had prompted
the most Senate opposition to Mc-
Carthy, charged that he "failed to
co-operate" with the elections sub
committee during its investigation
of his finances and other activities
and that he "abused" its members.
It was approved by 23 Republi
cans, 43 Democrats, and independent
Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon. All
20 dissenting votes were cast by Re
publicans. McCarthy was not pres
ent for the vote but he made clear
in a statement for TV cameras that
he considered it the "final" test.
However, the Senate still must
consider the second count in the
two-count Watkins committee reso
lution. It charges that McCarthy
abused Brig. Gen. Ralph W. Zwiek
er while questioning him in connec
tion with the Peress loyalty case.
CALIFORNIA VOTE
Both Republican Senators Kuchcl
and Knowland from California voted
against the censure.
The final showdown will come to
morrow. Due to the parliamentary
situation, the vote on the first count,
was only tentative since the Senate
actually was voting on an amend
ment. The Watkins committee of
fered its censure resolution as an
amendment to the original resolu
tion introduced by Senator Ralph E.
Flanders (R., Vt.).
The Senate will consider any
amendments that might be offered
from the floor and then vote on the
over-all package. Senator H. Alex
ander Smith (R., N.J.) indicated ho
plans to introduce another compro
mise.
AMENDMENT INTRODUCED
Senator Wallace F. Bennett (R.,
Utah) has introduced an amendment
to censure McCarthy on a third
count for abuse of the Watkins com
mittee during the angry debate that
started 21 days ago.
Senator Watkins, who argued
heatedly for support of the censure
recommendation, said the results of
the voting were "better than I ex
pected."
McCarthy announced, meanwhile,
he would resume his investigation of
Communism Monday "roughly the
same as I have in the past."
The Senate voted tonight for an
immediate overnight investigation of
Senator McCarthy's charges that,
"forgeries" were involved in a "mail
check" made on his correspondence
during the 1951-52 investigation of
his finances.
Senate Republican Leader Wil
liam F. Knowland (Calif.) called for
the inquiry after McCarthy charged
that Senator Guy M. Gillette's name
was forged to letters requesting the
so-called mail cover.
