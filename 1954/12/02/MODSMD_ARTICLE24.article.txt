# First Week Totals Told for TB Drive
## 
### 
The Stanford Tuberculosis Christ
mas Seal drive has netted $539.90 in
its first week, according to Mrs. Ann
Castellanos, the local executive sec
retary.
Only 546 students, out of the 6,800
who received seals, have replied as
yet, so the directors feel that many
donations may still be received. They
expressed their appreciation, how
ever, to all the students who have
contributed and written notes so far.
Directors have placed their goal
at $70,000 throughout the local aio;i
this year, an increase of $3,000 over
last year's total collections.
