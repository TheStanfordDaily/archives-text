# MOTOR-VEHICLE ACCIDENTS
## 38,000 Killed In '53 Mishaps 
### 
Deaths totaled 38,300 in motor-vehicle accidents in the United States
during 1953. Nearly one and a half million persons were injured. The total
number of accidents approached ten million.
Statistics published by the National Safety Council show that nearly
three-fourths of the deaths occurred in rural areas, and that approximately
two-thirds of the deaths were in night accidents. Major circumstances
cited by the Council as contributing to the accidents were jaywalking, ex
ces :ive speed, failure to yield the right of v/ay, failure to keep right of the
center line, and driving under the influence of alcohol.
Nearly 3 out of 10 drivers were violating a speed law, according to re
ports from 22 states; that is, either exceeding the stated speed or driving
too last, for conditions.
In 24 out of 100 fatal accidents, a driver or a pedestrian had been drinking,
according to reports from 21 states. Drivers classed as "under the influence
of alcohol" were involved in G percent of the iatalitites.
Seventeen per cent of all urban fatalities occurred when the driver failed
to yield the right of way, and 13 percent of all rural fatalities when the
di iver failed to keep right of the center line. In 36 percent of the fatal urban
pedestrian accidents and in 46 percent of the rural pedestrian fatalities
the pedestrian was crossing between intersections.
Of other circumstances studied by the National Safety Council, poor
vehicle condition was observed in 6 percent of the fatal accidents, the
driver's vision was obscured in ten percent, and weather conditions were
i amy, snowy, or foggy in 20 percent of all accidents.
Drivers between 18 and 24 were involved in 22 percent of all fatal acci
<J< nts, while the average for any seven year span between the ages of 25
and 4-1 was 17 percent. On the basis of the number of drivers in each age
*'roup, according to a study in lowa, the percentage of involvement in fatal
accidents was sharply higher for the 19 to 29 year group than for either
younger or older drivers.
1 • lu' proportion of men to women involved in accidents was about 7
men to each woman. In fatal accidents the proportion was close to 10 to 1.
A considerable part of these differences in rates undoubtedly is due to
the fact that men drivers average more miles than women drivers," ex
plains the National Safety Council. "Their (women's) fatal accident in
volvement rate based on mileage would be somewhat lower than the rate
lor men drivers, but their all-accident involvement rate would be higher."
California's death rate per hundred million miles of travel was 6.6,
.5 below the national average of 7.1. In comparison with other countries,
Ihe United States was the second safest country in the world with 7.2
deaths per 10,000 motor vehicles in 1950. New Zealand had the best record
with 6.7 per 10,000. Although Egypt had only 1500 deaths, that country was
the most unsafe percentagewise, with 158.6 deaths per 10,000 vehicles.

Drivers between 18 and 24 were involved in 22 percent of all fatal acci
<J< nts, while the average for any seven year span between the ages of 25
and 4-1 was 17 percent. On the basis of the number of drivers in each age
*'roup, according to a study in lowa, the percentage of involvement in fatal
accidents was sharply higher for the 19 to 29 year group than for either
younger or older drivers.
1 • lu' proportion of men to women involved in accidents was about 7
men to each woman. In fatal accidents the proportion was close to 10 to 1.
A considerable part of these differences in rates undoubtedly is due to
the fact that men drivers average more miles than women drivers," ex
plains the National Safety Council. "Their (women's) fatal accident in
volvement rate based on mileage would be somewhat lower than the rate
lor men drivers, but their all-accident involvement rate would be higher."
California's death rate per hundred million miles of travel was 6.6,
.5 below the national average of 7.1. In comparison with other countries,
Ihe United States was the second safest country in the world with 7.2
deaths per 10,000 motor vehicles in 1950. New Zealand had the best record
with 6.7 per 10,000. Although Egypt had only 1500 deaths, that country was
the most unsafe percentagewise, with 158.6 deaths per 10,000 vehicles.

Deaths totaled 38,300 in motor-vehicle accidents in the United States
during 1953. Nearly one and a half million persons were injured. The total
number of accidents approached ten million.
Statistics published by the National Safety Council show that nearly
three-fourths of the deaths occurred in rural areas, and that approximately
two-thirds of the deaths were in night accidents. Major circumstances
cited by the Council as contributing to the accidents were jaywalking, ex
ces :ive speed, failure to yield the right of v/ay, failure to keep right of the
center line, and driving under the influence of alcohol.
Nearly 3 out of 10 drivers were violating a speed law, according to re
ports from 22 states; that is, either exceeding the stated speed or driving
too last, for conditions.
In 24 out of 100 fatal accidents, a driver or a pedestrian had been drinking,
according to reports from 21 states. Drivers classed as "under the influence
of alcohol" were involved in G percent of the iatalitites.
Seventeen per cent of all urban fatalities occurred when the driver failed
to yield the right of way, and 13 percent of all rural fatalities when the
di iver failed to keep right of the center line. In 36 percent of the fatal urban
pedestrian accidents and in 46 percent of the rural pedestrian fatalities
the pedestrian was crossing between intersections.
Of other circumstances studied by the National Safety Council, poor
vehicle condition was observed in 6 percent of the fatal accidents, the
driver's vision was obscured in ten percent, and weather conditions were
i amy, snowy, or foggy in 20 percent of all accidents.
