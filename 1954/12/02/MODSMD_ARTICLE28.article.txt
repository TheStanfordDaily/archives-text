# More Accidents By Young Drivers
## 
### 
Drivers in the age group 16-25
have the greatest proportion of au
tomobile acidents in relation to the
number of driver's licenses issued
every year, acording to the National
Safety Council.
Drivers in this age group also have
the least regard for speed laws, sur
veys have shown. Drivers 25 years
old and younger hold 17.5 per cent
of the licenses among motorists
studied, but they were responsible
for 36 per cent of speed law viola
tions. The Council survey also shows
that 50 per cent of the total viola
tors were under 30 years of age.
A recent survey shows that the
16-25 age group was responsible for
23.7 per cent of all fatal auto mis
haps. Speed law violations were in
volved in 35 per cent of all fatal
accidents.
