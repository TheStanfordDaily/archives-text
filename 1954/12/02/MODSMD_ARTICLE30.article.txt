# Thoughts on a Christmas Holiday
## 
### 
The rain beats down on the tile roof over
your classroom while the professor talks on
steadily in front of you. And somehow your
thoughts wander from the lecture and focus
ahead two weeks.
Just two weeks, and finals will be over,
lust two weeks and it will be time to get
into your car and take off. Ah—so glad the
quarter is over, so tired, so anxious to get
home in a hurry.
So tired. So anxious to get home in a hurry.
Last year one out of 17 drivers involved in
fatal accidents were asleep or fatigued. Speed
—just "being in a hurry"—accounted for 35
per cent of all fatal accidents.
Your thoughts travel on. How great it will
be to get out of the fog and rain and into some
real winter weather.'lrving Berlin knew what
he was talking about when he wrote "White
Christmas." Christmas isn't really Christmas
—or winter really winter—without ice and
snow.
Out of the fog and rain. Into the ice and
snow. Rain, fog, and snow contributed to one
out of every five accidents last year. They
were factors involved in one out of six fatal
accidents.

Class is almost over, but your mind strays
on. Vacation. Christmas. You'll have to move
fast to get all your Christmas shopping done.
Trips to stores for presents. Trips around
town to visit old friends. Looks as though
you'll be doing a lot of driving around Christ
mas.
A lot of driving around Christmas. Every
one is on the road. Last year 519 persons,
died in Christmas weekend traffic accidents.
And according to the National Safety Council,
December 24, Christmas Eve, is the most
dangerous day of the year for traffic.
The bell rings. Class is over. You close
your notebook and walk out into the rain. Just
two weeks. Then you can celebrate. Cele
brate the end of finals, celebrate Christmas,
celebrate the New Year. You'll be glowing
with holiday spirit.
Celebrations. Holiday spirit. Over 18 per
cent of the drivers involved in fatal accidents
last year had been drinking. Twenty-seven
per cent of the pedestrians killed had been
"celebrating" just a Utile too much.
You are almost on your way. You are going
home for your best Christmas ever. Don't
make it your last.
