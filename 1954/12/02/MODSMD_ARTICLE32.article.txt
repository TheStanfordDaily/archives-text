# Campus Accidents Are Up 50 Per Cent
## 
### JIM PALMER 
A constantly heavy flow of
traffic is sending Stanford's ac
cident rate this year soaring 50
percent over last year's figures,
according to Police Chief Gord
on Davis,
With over 4,000 cars being driven !
on the campus every clay, Stanford j
j faces a traffic problem not different i
{ from other communities—simply an j
overabundance of automobiles.
"During an average afternoon re- ,
| cently, - we counted 300 cars on Palm
j Drive within 15 minutes," Davis re- !
j ports. The tremendous increase in I
} Palm Drive traffic this year has been
, a contributing factor to the rise in
| accidents, he adds.
The Palm Drive traffic is routed j
in three lanes at peak hours. In the
morning, two lanes are routed in
bound to the campus and one out
' bound. The How is reversed at noon, i
"This is why there is no center
white line on the drive," Davis
points out. "Such a line would only
add to the confusion when three '
lanes of traffic are using the 'road.•
"And besides, the majority of ac
; cidents on the drive have been the
j result of rear-end crashes, not head
on collisions."
CONSTRUCTION DANGERS
The danger of rear-end accidents
has increased this year due to con
struction alongside the road. "Driv
ers are following the cars ahead of
j them too close for safety in the
rough section of the drive."
Stanford's safety record during
j the 1952-1953 academic year shows
! G9 accidents inside the campus lim
| its, none of which were fatal. How
ever, two resulted in serious injury.
The only fatal accident in the past
12 years occurred during 1951-1952,
when there were 70 accidents on
campus.
ALPINE ROAD MISHAPS
Commenting on the accidents in
| the Alpine Road area, which is out
side the Stanford Police Depart
ment's jurisdiction, Davis warns
that these mishaps "are caused by
people who drive their cars at an
excessive speed beyond their con
trol."
Another area of traffic danger is
the corner of Santa Ynez and May
field, where the elementary school i
is located. "It is the duty of the
driver to be constantly alert in the i
school area, to drive slowly, and to
observe the junior patrol signals."
CITATIONS
An unusual number of citations
have been issued thus far this year
for speeding and stopping violations
at various points on the campus,
Davis declares. "At crosswalks, the
drivers in their urgency to get
where they are going often do not
give pedestrians the right of way.
"The driver's actions are both ex
pensive and very hazardous. Tjie
driver must realize that a car can- j
not be stopped in an instant."
ASK CO-OPERATION
The traffic problem is complicated
by the great deal of needless driv
ing done by many students, Davis
says. Congestion occurs during "riv>h

hours" at major points on the cam
pus, especially on the Row.
"We don't have an army of per
sonnel to direct traffic. We ask stu
dents to co-operate in reducing the
traffic flow on the streets and there
by eliminate a lot of the opportu
nities for accidents.
"Those who must drive their cars
to class should park their cars in a
proper space until the acadepiic day
is over."
About 3,400 parking spaces are
available, Davis states. "But not ev
eryone can park close to the Quad;
there just aren't that many parking
spaces."
In a final word to the motorist,
Davis advises "more courtesy and
consideration for other drivers and
a reduction of speeding habits" in
order to cut down the rising Stan
ford accident rate for the safety of
both the driver and the pedestrian.


THE REMAINS—Shown above are the results of the most serious
traffic accident on campus this guarter. The mishap occurred
on a recent Sunday afternoon when a Stanford student driving
along Palm Drive lost control of his car and crashed into a palm
tree. Miraculously, no one was killed, but the driver was con
fined to Palo Alto Hospital for several days with serious injuries.
