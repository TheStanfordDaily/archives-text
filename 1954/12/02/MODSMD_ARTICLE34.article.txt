# Safety Group Gives Holiday Driving Tips
## 
### 
For a merrier Christmas, drive
with reason during the holiday sea
son.
This appeal was made to motorists
yesterday by the National Safety
Council as it opened its annual
Christmas safety campaign.
The Christmas-N/nv Year holiday
season is the most hazardous single
period of the year, according to the
Council. Twice as many persons are
killed in traffic accidents at this time
of year as on the same days of the
preceding two weeks. Causes of the
extra dangers and higher tolls are
heavier travel and the festive spirit
of the season, plus the usual winter
hazards of bad weather, slippery
roads, and more hours of darkness.
The Council offers the following
tips for holiday driving:
1. Respect the weather. Adjust
your speed to road and weather con
ditions.
2. Keep windshield clear, and use
tire chains for severe snow and ice
conditions.
3. Brake intermittently â€” don't
lock the wheels when the road is
slippery.
4. Follow other vehicles at a safe
distance.
5. Allow plenty of time to make
your trip without hurrying.
G. Never drive after drinking.
