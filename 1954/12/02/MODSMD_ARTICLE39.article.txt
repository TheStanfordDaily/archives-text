# Geology Open House Is Tomorrow
## 
### 
I The inside story of the earth be
neath us will be told*graphically in
displays and demonstrations at the
School of Mineral Sciences open
house from 1 to 10 p.m. tomorrow.
An 11-foot model of a portable oil
drilling rig, which will be kept In
continuous operation, will be shown
at Geology Corner on Outer Quad
as one of several exhibits furnished
by commercial firms and the U.S.
Bureau of Mines.
The open house panorama will
range from fossils and rocks of pre
historic ages to recent devices for
scientific analysis. Shells and ma
rine forms from the Stanford Con
chology Museum, stones cut and
polished for jewelry, and gold speci
men collections are included in the
displays.
Dean Charles F. Park, Jr., will
demonstrate the microchemical and
optical study of minerals. Other
demonstrations include X-ray anal
ysis and separation of minerals, ul
traviolet rays and their fluorescent
effect on minerals, aerial photo
graphs, and other apparatus and
methods used for mining and oil
production refining.
Motion pictures on geology, min
ing, metallurgy, and petroleum en
gineering will be shown to those at
tending the open house. An illus
trated lecture on uranium and ex
planations of apparatus and meth
ods used in various branches of min
eral sciences will be given by fac
ulty members.


SPECTROGRAPH DEMONSTRATION — This spectrograph,
charting chemical makeup of rock or metal, will be on display
from 1 to 10 p.m. tomorrow at the School of Mineral Sciences
open house. Here the machine is demonstrated by Stanley Vol
brecht, mining geology graduate student, for Joanne Bruner,
Stanford sophomore.
