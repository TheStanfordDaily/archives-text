# Grid Awards Given Tonight
## 
### 
The first annual Stanford Foot
ball Awards Banquet will be held
tonight in the Gold Room of San
Francisco's Fairmont Hotel. Mem
bers of the varsity football team will
receive their block letters at the
affair.
The event is already a near-sell
out. Over 400 tickets, at $5.50 each,
have been sold. Alumni purchasing
tickets were told that if they would
like to have a freshman footballer
attend and sit at their table, they
should pay an extra $5,50. As a re
sult, some 40 frosh gridders will also
be in attendance.
The outstanding player award will
be presented at the affair. In addi
tion, each varsity block winner will
receive a gift from the alumni worth

about $15.
This is the first year such an event
has been tried at Stanford. At many
other schools, it is very successful.
Pennsylvania, for instance, charges
$10 per ticket and over 500 people
attend each year.
According to alumni officials, the
response at Stanford, in view of the
comparatively poor season, has been
overwhelming. It is believed the
will become another Stan
ford tradition.
Music and other entertainment
will also be featured. Information
about obtaining any of the remain
ing tickets may be obtained at the
BAC.
