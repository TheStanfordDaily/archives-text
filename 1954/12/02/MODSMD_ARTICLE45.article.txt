# Farm Wrestling Is No Longer Slighted
## 
### BOB DURAND 
After 38 years and 23 competitive seasons, wrestling at Stan
ford is finally coming into its own. Since 1916, when the first
semblance of the mat sport appeared on the Farm, it has been re
garded lightly until just recently.
In 1952-53 the grapplers experienced their first winnig season

and last year, despite many bad
breaks,, they even bettered that rec
ord. Indications show that this
year's squad should continue to im
prove the situation even more.
Coach Bob Harmon's wrestlers
this fall boast a team led by three
returnees from last season's team:
Bob Beatty, Bob Fisher, and Bill
Tolley.
Also competing for the Cards this
year will be sophomores Don Ma
noukiah, Pete Likins, and Ray Mil
ler. The latter two were unbeaten
on last year's freshman squad.
Other candidates include Jerry
Lowell, Wally Franz, Dick Seibert,
Wick Curtis, Chris Kirchoff, Stan
Hartman, Kurt Nieland, and A 1
Laubscher.
SERIOUS LOSSES
The good number of potential var
sity wrestlers turning out this year
should supplement the two serious
losses suffered by Coach Harmon
from last year's team. George Rus
sell, who was undefeated through
out his college career, and Ken
James both graduated last spring.
With this lineup of material and a
nine-match schedule including UC
LA. Oregon, and California, plus
two tournaments, the grappling In
dians are looking forward to a more
interesting season than ever before.
NO TEAM FIELDED
No record of any matches was
kept in the first year of Stanford
wrestling. However, from 1917
through 1923, the schedule consisted
of one match a year with C a h The
Bears won every one handily.
No team was fielded between 1924
and 1936, when it was resumed for
two years, but again was abandoned
because of the war.
In 1947, with Chuck Taylor, pres
ent Indian grid mentor, as coach,

wrestling was included again in
Stanford's athletic program. Taylor
coached until 1950 and during his
final two years, one of his star pupils
was present Coach Harmon.
After the team had suffered a 1-5
season in 1951, Don Williarhs took
over the coaching reins, and in the
next two years his team won 11 and
lost 10.
LAST YEAR
Last year, under the leadership of
Harmon, the grapplers won their
first five matches, and then were
hit by injuries. Their final record of
seven wins and six losses still gives
them the distinction of having won
more in one season than any other
Stanford team.
Among other things that future
Indian wrestlers will be striving to
improve is their record of meets
with the California matmen. Over
the years, the Bears have won 22,
while Stanford has only managed to
record three triumphs. Two meets
have ended in ties.

through 1923, the schedule consisted
of one match a year with C a h The
Bears won every one handily.
No team was fielded between 1924
and 1936, when it was resumed for
two years, but again was abandoned
because of the war.
In 1947, with Chuck Taylor, pres
ent Indian grid mentor, as coach,

wrestling was included again in
Stanford's athletic program. Taylor
coached until 1950 and during his
final two years, one of his star pupils
was present Coach Harmon.
After the team had suffered a 1-5
season in 1951, Don Williarhs took
over the coaching reins, and in the
next two years his team won 11 and
lost 10.
LAST YEAR
Last year, under the leadership of
Harmon, the grapplers won their
first five matches, and then were
hit by injuries. Their final record of
seven wins and six losses still gives
them the distinction of having won
more in one season than any other
Stanford team.
Among other things that future
Indian wrestlers will be striving to
improve is their record of meets
with the California matmen. Over
the years, the Bears have won 22,
while Stanford has only managed to
record three triumphs. Two meets
have ended in ties.
After 38 years and 23 competitive seasons, wrestling at Stan
ford is finally coming into its own. Since 1916, when the first
semblance of the mat sport appeared on the Farm, it has been re
garded lightly until just recently.
In 1952-53 the grapplers experienced their first winnig season

and last year, despite many bad
breaks,, they even bettered that rec
ord. Indications show that this
year's squad should continue to im
prove the situation even more.
Coach Bob Harmon's wrestlers
this fall boast a team led by three
returnees from last season's team:
Bob Beatty, Bob Fisher, and Bill
Tolley.
Also competing for the Cards this
year will be sophomores Don Ma
noukiah, Pete Likins, and Ray Mil
ler. The latter two were unbeaten
on last year's freshman squad.
Other candidates include Jerry
Lowell, Wally Franz, Dick Seibert,
Wick Curtis, Chris Kirchoff, Stan
Hartman, Kurt Nieland, and A 1
Laubscher.
SERIOUS LOSSES
The good number of potential var
sity wrestlers turning out this year
should supplement the two serious
losses suffered by Coach Harmon
from last year's team. George Rus
sell, who was undefeated through
out his college career, and Ken
James both graduated last spring.
With this lineup of material and a
nine-match schedule including UC
LA. Oregon, and California, plus
two tournaments, the grappling In
dians are looking forward to a more
interesting season than ever before.
NO TEAM FIELDED

kept in the first year of Stanford
wrestling. However, from 1917
