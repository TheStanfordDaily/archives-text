# Card Cagers Hopeful Despite Schedule
## 
### 
Stanford's basketball squad, opening their 1954-55 season tomorrow night against San Jose
State, hope to have a good year. But both the schedule and the opposition seem to be stacked
against them.
The Card cagers, under the leadership of new head coach Howie Dallmar, have three of last
year's regulars returning. Guards George Selle :k and Ron Tomsic and center Russ Lawler will

team with forwards Leo Schwaiger"
and Bill Bond to form the starting
lineup.
The Stanford schedule isn't ex
actly conducive to winning basket
ball. Of the 25 games on the sched
ule, only nine of them are at the
Pavilion. There seems to be little
question among experts but that
playing on your home court is a bi;{
advantage in any basketball game.
The Cards follow San Jose with
St. Mary's Saturday night, and then
don't play again until Dec. 18, the
Saturday after finals, when they host

►
! the University of Hawaii.
Then the Indians .'tart a rough
j Eastern trip, playing Arizona, Tu
lane, Seton Hall, Vanderbilt, and
lowa. "We don't expect- 10 win any
more than two of those games,"
Dallmar stated.
In January, the quintet plays two
weeks of league competition (UCLA
and California) and then travels to
Hawaii for the Invitational Tourna
ment there. In the past, Dallmar
says, pleasure-minded teams visit
ing Hawaii have had trouble with.

On returning from the islands, the
Stanfordites have another weekend
of "practice" games. The::e are
against two top - notch Bay Area
teams, USF and Santa Clara at the
Cow Palace.
LEAGUE GAMES
Finally, the season continues with
the second round of league compe
tition. The total number of contests,
as the revised rules permit, is only
25 games. Stanford might have a
top-notch team and still do no bet
ter than break even.
Dallmar has high hopes for his
first season. "In Selleck and Tomsic
i we have the best two little men on
any college team. And Lawler shows
great ability at the center post. We
seem to h*ave plenty of scoring abil
ity. The only problem will he in
| stopping the other team from scor
ing more."
Selleck is a junior this year. Last
season he was runner-up to Lawler
in PCC scoring. "He really amazes
me," said Dallmar. "On a straight
[ away run, he's far from the fastest
man in the world. But his reactions
; are so quick he is able to reach
! loose balls, and he often will steal
| the ball from an unwary opponent."
TOMSIC BACK
! Tomsic, a senior, was injured after
seven games last season. He's back,
wearing a knee brace. In 1952 he
was a great offensive threat, and was
the top Card scorer that season as
a sophomore.
■"I think Ron's knee is going to
hold up all right," the coach com
mented. "He is a fine all-around
player, and on offense has excellent
faking ability. He should pick up
right where he left off two years
ago."
Dallmar said that Lawler has great
potential "if only he doesn't have to
work so hard. The past few years he
was the tall man on a very short
team. Consequently, he was always
up on the board for rebounds. And
j a player doesn't get tired from run
ning up and down the court—he gets
tired from all the jumping.
HOOK SHOT
"Russ has one of the softest hook
shots I've ever seen. He's accurate
with it either left- or right-handed.
If we can only get another tall man
in the lineup to take some of the re
bounding pressure off him, he
should have a great season."
Lawler started last year unher
alded, says the coach, but ended up
the league's leading scorer. "They'll
be looking for him this season,"
Dallmar said.
Schwaiger is in the lineup, Dall
mar frankly admits, not to score a
lot of points, but to aid Lawler with
the floor play. "We've got lots of
scorers, and I think Leo will be
very valuable helping take pressure
off the only other tall man, Lawler."
Bond, a 6-1 sophomore, has great

ly impressed Dallinar in pre-season
practice, and has earned a starting
berth. "Bill 'is an excellent all
around player, and should be a big
help to us both offensively and de
fensively. From what I am told, he
had an excellent year as a freshman,
and I can testify that he is rapidly
improving still more."
These will be the starting five to
morrow night. The closest candi
date for a first-string berth is Barry
Brown, who is pressing Schwaiger
for the forward spot. Both are tall
men, and Dallmar believes either
can do the required job.
As for the upcoming season, Dall
mar believes it will be a lour-way
fight between all the Southern Divi
sion teams. "It looks like a really
tough league this year."
TROJANS FAVORED
"Defending champion USC has
hardly lo't anything," the coach
commented. So they naturally have
to be favored to win again. Inciden
tally, the Trojans are the only PCC
team I've actually seen in action the
past few years," he said. "1 saw
them at the NCAA playoffs back
East.
"UCLA has an outstanding team
under Johnny Wooden. They have
loti of depth, and should only be a
hair's breadth behind USC."
California, the coach said, suffered
hardest by graduation losses. "But
they still have Bob McKeen. Like
Lawler, he will need some help this
season, but if he gets it the Bears
will be dangerous as ever. I under
stand they have several top-notch
transfers," Dallmar commented.
