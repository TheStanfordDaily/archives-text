### BOB DURAND 
Stanford basketball of the 1954-55 version with a new coach
and a new look will make its debut at 8:30 tonight in the Pa
vilion when the Card cageis meet the San Jose State Spartans.
The Indian five will play again tomorrow night at the same
tune in the Pavilion when they entertain the Galloping Gaels of

♦St. Mary's. Then after a home tilt
with I lie University of Hawaii when
exams arc over, the Farm hoopsters
leave on an extended eastern road
trip.
With newcomer Howie Dallmar at
the coaching reigns, the Cards will
bring forth a new-type double pivot
)ffensc that will be unfamiliar to the
Stanford scene. On the other hand,
Dallmar claims, "our defense has a
lot to be desired."
12,000 iVILES
The Indian cagers will travel an
estimated 12.000 miles to play their
games this year, beginning with the
Christmas trip. On Dec. 21, they
face an always tough University of
Arizona five at Tucson. From there,
they enplane for New Orleans where
they meet Tulanc.
Two days after Christmas, a pow
erful Seton Hall will host the Cards
at South Orange, New Jersey, and
on the 29th Vanderbilt will provide
the opposition. Iowa concludes the
schedule on the next day when their
hoopsters, who are favorites for the
Big Ten title, take on Co'ich Dall
mar's squad.
"I'll be disappointed if we don't j
have a good road trip," said Dallmar,
" —not in terms of wins or losses
but in getting experience and learn- [
ing a lot." He added a minute later, i
"As far as I'm concerned, our first |
real game is our first conference ,
game."
Also included in the team's trips
are a trip across the Pacific for the
Hawaii Invitational Jan. 19-21 and ]
two trips to Los Angeles for league
I contests with UCLA and USC.
