## 
### 
VATICAN CITY, Friday, Doc.
.'5 (UP) -Pope Pius XII fought
stubbornly for his life early to
day after surviving a heart attack
and rallying from a state of col
lap e.
The 78 - year - old spiritual
leader of the world's 425,000,000
Roman Catholics was in grave
condition. For more than four
hours after he suffered the heart
attack yesterday there were fears
at the highest Vatican level that
he would not last through the
night.
Crowds of the faithful gathered
in St. Peter's Square to kneel in
prayer for the pontiff's recovery
and Clemente Cardinal Micara,
the Vicar of Rome, issued a call
to prayer for Catholics through
out the world.
DespUe his age and the weak
ening effects of a stomach ailment
which has plagued him for more
than 10 months, the Pope staged
an amazing rally from a state of
collapse, recovering all the fac
ulties lost during four desperate
hours.
Authoritative Vatican sources
said the pontiff never lost, con
sciousness, but high church offi
cials and the Pope's relatives
were summoned to the Vatican.
Rome newspapers reported with
out confirmation that he had been
given the last rites of the church.
'I lie gastritis which has drained
the Popes' strength for months

was reported early today to be
acute. Physicians attributed the
condition in part to worry and fa
tigue resulting from the pontiff's
long hours of work in the
church's fight against Commu
nism and for world peace. He
had refused to adopt an easier
schedule as recommended by his
doctors.
Vatican sources .said the doc
tors suspect that a gastric ulcer
may be causing the hiccuping
and inability to retain food which
has plagued the Pope sporadi
cally since January.
