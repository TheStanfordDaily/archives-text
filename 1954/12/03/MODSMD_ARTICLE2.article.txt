# Stanford Site Still Sought For Hospital
## 
### 
The Veterans Administration
strongly asserted this week that
Ihey still want to establish a
$21,000,000 hospital on Stanford
land.
The VA has been seeking to es
tablish the 1,000-bed hospital in the
vicinity oi Pane Mill Road and Juni
pcro Sena Boulevard for the past
.six months.
Stanford ofiicials have been weigh
ing the arguments on both sides in
an attempt to determine whether
or not they should allow VA to es
tablish the building on University
land and in the site they are seeking.
An undisclosed source said the
University might forward a decision
within the next few weeks.
Stanford has had to consider pe
tition: from home owners living near
the site who maintain that the hos
pital wouid lower property values
and be a threat to their safety.
AKGUMKNTS
On the other side, they have had
to reconcile arguments that, the VA
hospital in Menlo Park provides the
same "â–  mall ' threat to safety and
that Stanford should be glad to let
its land be used for a good cause.
A VA spokesman stated Tuesday
night that construction plans are be
ing held up while the government
agency continues to dicker with the
University over ite acquisition. Ne
rotation-, he added, are definitely
sliii in progress.
The VA spokesmen, in reply to
rumors that Stanford wanted to move
Ihe site farther west, into hill coun
try owned by the University said,
"The status is still quo. As far as
anyone knows we are still interested
in obtaining the original site."
rt(Tif.!>f\<; PLANS
'J he o(Vice of Sen. Thomas Kuchel
(R.,-Calif.) reported that it had been
informed of substantially the same
thing. The VA told Kuchel that it
planned to build on the original site,
but didn't offer any details on how
the project was progressing.
When VA announced its plans for
the building last spring, it, estimated
that construction might be under way
by the fall of 1955. But first a
"friendly suit against, Stanford to
obtain the land would have to be
filed.
A provision in Ihe University's
charter prevents Stanford from sell
ing any of its land. The government
cannot legally accept a 09-year lease
which Stanford could offer.
A "friendly" suit is a technical
way of getting around this predica
ment. The government would file
suit to have the land in question
condemned and Stanford wouldn't
contest it. A financial settlement is
usually decided upon before the suit
is filed.
