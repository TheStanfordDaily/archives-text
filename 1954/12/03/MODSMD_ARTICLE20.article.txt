# Senate Votes to Condemn McCarthy on Two Counts
## 67-22 Decision Culminates Weeks of ‘Bitter' Arguing 
### 
furiously debating whether McCar
thy actually had been censured, the
Senate dropped another charge that
McCarthy abused Brig. Gen. Ralph
VV. Zwicker in conncction with the
Peress loyalty case.
The Wisconsin Republican, who
| said he was "happy to have this
circus ended," squelched reports he
would lead a bolt from the GOP.
| He told reporters, "I intend to do my
work against the enemies of my
[ country from within the Republican
party."
After the vote the Senate joined
the House in adjournment at 4:10
p.m. PST.
TWO COUNTS
The Senate, ending the bitterest
fight in modern Congressional his
tory, approved a two-count resolu
tion against the Wisconsin Republi
can which:
I—Rebuked him for "failing to
l co-operate" with a 1951-52 Senate
j elections subcommittee that investi
gated his finances and other activi
ties. This resolution also said that
McCarthy "repeatedly abused" the
| subcommittee members.
2—Reprimanded him for his at
tacks on the special Watkins censure
committee and on the Senate itself.
McCarthy had called Watkins com
mittee members "unwitting hand
maidens" of the Communist party
and had referred to the Senate ses-
I sion as a "lynch bee."
DEBATE
McCarthy's forces took the posi
tion that the Wisconsin Republican
had not actually been "censured''
because the final resolution used the
word "condemn" instead of "cen
sure." They held that condemnation
was the weaker action.
Chairman Arthur V. Watkins (R.,
Utah) of the special censure com
mittee told the Senate "condemn" is
the "historical word used in censure
resolutions" and said he did not
know the difference. McCarthy,
asked whether he felt he had been
censured, said, "It wasn't exactly a
vote of confidence."
Watkins, asked whether he was
satisfied with the vote, said the ac
tion of the Senate "speaks for itself."
Senator Ralph E. Flanders (R., Vt.),
who started the censure move
against McCarthy, said he was "sat
isfied" even though the final resolu
tion did not include "everything I
had in mind."
The Wisconsin Republican was the
fourth Senator in U.S. history to be
formally reprimanded. In the last
previous case, involving Senator Hi
ram W. Bingham (R., Conn.) in 1928,
the word "censure" was dropped
from the resolution and the word
"condemn" used instead. In two
earlier cases, "censured" was used.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 (UP) —The Senate voted 67 to 22 today
to formally "condemn" Senator Joseph R. McCarthy on two
counts of obstructing the work of Congress by heaping abuse
on Senate committees and their members.

The Wisconsin Republican was the
fourth Senator in U.S. history to be
formally reprimanded. In the last
previous case, involving Senator Hi
ram W. Bingham (R., Conn.) in 1928,
the word "censure" was dropped
from the resolution and the word
"condemn" used instead. In two
earlier cases, "censured" was used.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 (UP) —The Senate voted 67 to 22 today
to formally "condemn" Senator Joseph R. McCarthy on two
counts of obstructing the work of Congress by heaping abuse
on Senate committees and their members.
In a final hectic round of voting, which left opposing factions


joe McCarthy
—Condemned
furiously debating whether McCar
thy actually had been censured, the
Senate dropped another charge that
McCarthy abused Brig. Gen. Ralph
VV. Zwicker in conncction with the
Peress loyalty case.
The Wisconsin Republican, who
| said he was "happy to have this
circus ended," squelched reports he
would lead a bolt from the GOP.
| He told reporters, "I intend to do my
work against the enemies of my
[ country from within the Republican
party."
After the vote the Senate joined
the House in adjournment at 4:10
p.m. PST.
TWO COUNTS
The Senate, ending the bitterest
fight in modern Congressional his
tory, approved a two-count resolu
tion against the Wisconsin Republi
can which:
I—Rebuked him for "failing to
l co-operate" with a 1951-52 Senate
j elections subcommittee that investi
gated his finances and other activi
ties. This resolution also said that
McCarthy "repeatedly abused" the
| subcommittee members.
2—Reprimanded him for his at
tacks on the special Watkins censure
committee and on the Senate itself.
McCarthy had called Watkins com
mittee members "unwitting hand
maidens" of the Communist party
and had referred to the Senate ses-
I sion as a "lynch bee."
DEBATE
McCarthy's forces took the posi
tion that the Wisconsin Republican
had not actually been "censured''
because the final resolution used the
word "condemn" instead of "cen
sure." They held that condemnation
was the weaker action.
Chairman Arthur V. Watkins (R.,
Utah) of the special censure com
mittee told the Senate "condemn" is
the "historical word used in censure
resolutions" and said he did not
know the difference. McCarthy,
asked whether he felt he had been
censured, said, "It wasn't exactly a
vote of confidence."
Watkins, asked whether he was
satisfied with the vote, said the ac
tion of the Senate "speaks for itself."
Senator Ralph E. Flanders (R., Vt.),
who started the censure move
against McCarthy, said he was "sat
isfied" even though the final resolu
tion did not include "everything I
had in mind."
