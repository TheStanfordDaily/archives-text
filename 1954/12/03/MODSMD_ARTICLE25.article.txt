# Time to ‘Hit the Curve’
## 
### 
Our history professor mentioned the other
day that we would do well to glance over the
textbook ... at least the chapter headings . . .
sometime between now and the final. Which
brings suddenly to mind that it's almost too late
to glance over thelextbook (750 pages) or any
thing else before the final. Ten days until finals,
now, and although they've called off all the
activities diaing dead week, they forget to call
off the lectures. So we'll have to read that
history between sociology lectures.
But we'll get the history read and all that
other stuff too. Somebody says there's a book
report due during dead week. Have to find out
the name of the book. We'll get it done. Have

to fight those mobs in the reserved book room,
and try to get typewriter space out behind the
stairs. But we'll be there at 8 a.m. for the final
. . . the professor will probably stay home and
send his grader to pass out the blue books . . .
and we'll probably hit that curve pretty well,
because everybody else is doing the same
thing and their study habits are nothing com
pared to ours.
That's right: you've got to have good study
habits to get by in college. And here we are,
ten days from finals, so it's time for the study
habits.
"I'm tired of sitting around home and going
to parties," somebody said the other day.
"Guess I'll study some."
