# Good Luck, Howie!

### 
Howie Dallmar makes his return to the Stan
ford sporting scene official tonight, making his
coaching debut as the Indian cagers entertain
San Jose State in the Pavilion.
Howie etched his name into Stanford sport
ing history when, as a sophomore in 1942, he
led the basketball team to the national champ
ionship. His stellar play earned him the most
valuable player award in the NCAA champ
ionship tourney.
Howie went on to capture new laurels as he
made the mythical All-American team while
at Pennsylvania and recently completed six
years of coaching Red and Blue basketball and
baseball teams.

The prospect of contributing to Stanford
athletics once more proved too much of a lure
for Howie, who was quick to take on the new
coaching assignment.
Howie calls this year's five the "most excit
ing" team he's ever coached. The team itself
has been favorably impressed by his coaching
techniques and personality.
With the nucleus of a good team, a good
schedule, and an excellent coach, Stanford fans
are assured of seeing exciting, if not always
winning, basketball.
We order up a round of huzzahs for Howie
and wish him the best of luck in the first of what
we hope will be many successful seasons.
