# A 						Matter of Procedure
## 
### 
The Executive Committee had two important
items to discuss on its agenda Wednesday
night.
The first was the danger of Stanford en
croaching upon or entering into free enterprise.
At least that was the central theme for most of
the discussion on the question: Should Stan
ford officially sponsor a tour to Europe next
summer?
In favor of the tour were all those who had
gone on such a tour this past summer. They
arqmed that such a Stanford group would re
ceive special attention from foreign university
people, would be able to travel at a less-regu
lated pace, and would form a "good-will" team
of Stanford students in Europe.
Those against the tour said all these advant
ages could come just as easily from any tour
on which a number of Stanford students went.
But free enterprise caused the gravest con
cern. Should Stanford slight other tours by
choosing one in particular? Should Stanford
venture forth into the tour business at all?
And, dare the Executive Committee establish
precedent by regularly sponsoring tours, or,
worse still, by putting the name of Stanford to
a profit-making business?
It didn't dare. With discussion running "ov

ertime" according to the agenda, the Executive
Committee finally managed to polish off the
answer—a round, firm, "no."
The second item on the agenda was a de
bate on procedure. At least that is what the
discussion of the draft constitution dissolved
into.
This was the third week that the Executive
Committee had scheduled discussion of the
constitution. The first half hour was spent de
ciding how to talk about the executive section.'
The second half hour was spent arguing over
what had been decided, interspersed with oc
casional comments on the constitution itself.
The third half hour saw more discussion on the
possibility of rescinding the original motion
setting up the procedure for discussion.
The evening was saved when all discussion
was tabled until winter guarter.
We are not trying to poke fun at student
government in general or at the Executive Com
mittee in particular. Wednesday night's absurd
meeting was not funny.
Rather we suggest that each Executive Com
mittee member take to heart the comment made
by Student Manager Bob Gable at the end of
the meeting—"Over Christmas vacation, let us
think about what we are doing."
To this we add a weary "Amen."
