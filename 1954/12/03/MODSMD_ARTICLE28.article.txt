# ANTI-AMERICAN FEELING
## Hilton Discusses Foreign Opinions 
### 
(In view of the growing anti-Amcrican feeling in many Latin American
end European countries, The Daily has interviewed Professor Ronald
Ililton, Director of Hispanic American Studies, in an effort to trace down
and describe the source of this resentment.
(Hilton, who has studied in France, Spain, and Italy, and has traveled
frequently in all the Latin American republics, has made several tours of
these areas recently. This year he attended the Inter-American Confer
ence at Caracas and represented the United State's at the Fourth Cen
tennial celebration at Sao Paulo.
(He recently returned from the bicentennial celebration of Columbia
University, where he was a guest speaker on Latin American problems
and was in close contact with leaders from the Latin countries of Europe
and America).
Discussing anti-American feeling in France, Hilton commented on France's
resentment of our criticism on iheir reluctance to rearm Germany.
"France is slowly coming out of a kind of trauma, with a guilt complex
derived from World War 11. We must understand sympathetically the feel
ings of a people whom an unkind Fate has put next to, one might say under,
a Prussianized Germany.
"The French feel that the Prussians have repeatedly tramped ruthlessly
and efficiently over a more civilized people, displaying toward them the
arrogance with which they treat their inferiors, while they now show
their other face, the mein of subservience, toward the United States, as
they always do toward those more powerful than they.
"We loudly damn the French for not making clear commitments and
for displaying political confusion, while the U.S. is equally unwilling to
make legally-binding commitments and seems to rejoice in its own partisan
melees.
LATIN AMERICAN RESENTMENT
Turning to Latin America, Hilton explained some ol the reasons for
the widespread resentment of United States business among Latin American
intellectuals.
"Like the French, Latin American men of culture feel that American
business is interested only in mass propaganda, and is thereby undermin
ing the reasonable and individualistic culture which is the basis of our
Western freedom
"Representatives from all over the world at the Columbia University
bicentennial conference expressed the fear that .so-called mass-communi
cation experts, in the pay of American big business, would destroy Western
civilization with their super-salesmanship.
"I am compelled to recall one prosperous American businessman win.
complimented me on my cultural labors saying they wotdd improve re
lations between the U.S. and Latin American. 'These countries,' he told
me flatteringly, 'are very much interested in culture. That's all they've
got'. »
ROLE OF UNIVERSITIES
"Instead of relying on high-pressure salesmanship in Latin America.
American businessmen should make it clear that our corporations are in
terested in culture and education, and that they can make a contribution
to the welfare of Latin America, for which there is no substitute."
j "Our universities, which do so well in giving women a liberal education,
I should revive the medieval motto 'Manners makyth men'; this is not an
I expression ol snobbery, but a profound insight into the* nature of the
t world."
Hilton was asked whether American universities provide the right kind
j of programs for work in Latin America and other foreign areas.
"Our universities have failed in large degrees because of the division
i into business-like departments, and, worse still, the dichotomy between
j the humanities and the social or behavioral sciences. Our system paralyze.'
! conversation as an expression of intellectual concerns.
"At the Columbia bicentennial. I was struck by the brilliant conver
sation between some distinguished Europeans and Latin Americans con
cerning major problems, while a group of American professors sat nearby
j discussing, as the highest common denominators, the sweetness of theii
| pipes. They were simply frightened to engage in intellectual conversation
| with people from other departments."
UNITED STATES RESPONSIBILITY
Finally, Hilton discussed the responsibility of the United States in the
| anti-American feeling,
"Ol course the United States is not primarily to blame. There are wrongs
on both sides. I could expiate about the shortcomings of our Latin Ameri
can neighbors—vis-a-vis the United States. Briefly, it should be said
that they are inclined to show hostility toward this country simply
because they are weak and the U.S. is strong.
American business, in particular, is made a whipping hoy for all kinds
of evils which cannot be attributed to it. There are literally no good
specialists in Anglo-American culture in Latin America, and this results
in a display of irresponsibility in judging this country.
"Above all, the Latin Americans wish for power without responsibility,
and this can never be. Representatives of Latin American countries at
the Columbia University bicentennial repeatedly demanded the abolition
1,1 ihe veto in the United Nations and the complete legal equality of na
tions, while at the same time declaring that intercontinental wars were
no concern of theirs.
"As long as it is beiieved that dying for freedom is a privilege reserved
for U.S. c:tizens and Britishers, some nations will have to remain more
equal than others."
