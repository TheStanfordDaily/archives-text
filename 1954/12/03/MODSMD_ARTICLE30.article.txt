## An ‘Indignant Protest’ 
### 
To the Editor:
Compelled by the outraged cries of several friends,
I am writing this indignant protest against the edi
torial in Wednesday's paper. The writer of this il
logical masteipiece seems to be against the freedom
of the Stanford male by slyly suggesting that our
bermuda shorts, "el al" should be stricken from the
Farm.
This is absurd. First, the "whacked-oil blues and
khakis" are an expression of the wholesome in
dividuality of Stanford men as compared to the con
formity of the Stanford female. They are an expres
sion of comfort, and alter all- -isn't this state noted
for its comfortable living?
Moreover, if the men aie forced to conform to the
regulations of a "dress com" just because the women
do, then logically, the next regulation will be 10:30
sign-outs, lock-outs, etc. Before too long, Joe Stanford
would be reduced to a state comparable lo the efficient,
regulated, and tenor-stricken Stanford female.

This "comfortably cool, but so bare" clothing serves
even another purpose. This is the purpose of art. Who
but a Stanford man could dream up such rare combi
nations with a new look of lagged edges? Arid yet wo
seem to be condemn d for this daring Innovation!
Even materialism creeps into the argument.
Withuut our shorts and other "bare" clothing, the
poor lad of Stanford would be forced to wear pants,
which need to be dry-cleaned or washed —a consider
able expense. Hie money saved by defraying this
expense could be spent in buying those bigger and
better books at the Bookstore, etc.
In summation, 1 can find no apparent reason for the
editorial unless:
a) the writer is somewhat of a prude ami loathes
the sight of bare legs on men
b) the writer doesn't want the Stanford man to
continue on his history-making journey in the realm
of men's apparel.
