### JACK BYRNE 
BYRNE'S IIANDY GUIDE TO CHRISTMAS
GIVING
Once, as a lad I crawled on lo Grandpa's lap, fixed
him with a beady stare, and cooed:
"Tell me about Christmas, Grandpop."
"Wellsirbygum," he reposted, "it's no by darn good.
No one ever gets what he needs."
Well, I'm still making a list of what 1 want for
Christinas this year. But instead of asking for myself,
I'm asking for the whole University. And this is what
I'm asking for:

FOR THE BAWLOUT: A pox.
FOR THE UNIVERSITY:
Roads. Detroit auto builders
spend millions to devise torture
tests for their cars. Stanford has
tried to spare them the expense
by demolishing every solid piece
of macadam on the campus. Test
new cars, fine; but does the Uni
versity feel an obligation to batter
our cars to bits too?
FOR THE BOOKSTORE: Books,
the ones you want. Also ink in

the shades yon want, no red, blown, turquoise, or
heliotrope.
FOR PALO AI.TO GIFT SHOP MERCHANTS:
The present Bookstore.
FOR LONG-LECTURING PROFS: Wrist watches

with built-in alarms that can't be turned oil" under
any circumstance.
FOR THE LIBRARY: A large enough staff that
they can look for "misplaced" bocks instead of spend
ing all their time checking stack permits.
FOR TIIE STANFORD QUAD: Proofreaders.
FOR SANTA CLARA COUNTY: An ordinance pro
hibiting the erection of a four-way stop every time
there's nothing else to do.
FOR ROBLE, LAGUNITA, ET AL: About leu extra
telephone lines.
FOR. DA 3-3121: Operators who realize you'd tell
the room number you want if you knew it.
FOR KZSU: An engineer who can get a program
on and off' the air without goofs.
FOR STANFORD SADIE: Laryngitis.
FOR LAV/ STUDENTS: 27 hours a day, in the hope
that this will relieve the pressure a bit.
FOR LAKE LAGUNITA: Clear and shining waters,
unsullied by weeds, scum, and frogs.
FOR HARLAN STROUD: Immortality.
FOR NEXT YEAR'S STUDENT BODY: One Axe,
mounted, which belongs to them, anyway.
FOR DEAD WEEK: Five extra days.
There it. is. If every one on this list gets the gift
indicated, I'll write this off as a more than successful
Christmas. I'd even settle for one or two of the
items.
But I expect to be disappointed.

BYRNE'S IIANDY GUIDE TO CHRISTMAS
GIVING
Once, as a lad I crawled on lo Grandpa's lap, fixed
him with a beady stare, and cooed:
"Tell me about Christmas, Grandpop."
"Wellsirbygum," he reposted, "it's no by darn good.
No one ever gets what he needs."
Well, I'm still making a list of what 1 want for
Christinas this year. But instead of asking for myself,
I'm asking for the whole University. And this is what
I'm asking for:

FOR THE BAWLOUT: A pox.
FOR THE UNIVERSITY:
Roads. Detroit auto builders
spend millions to devise torture
tests for their cars. Stanford has
tried to spare them the expense
by demolishing every solid piece
of macadam on the campus. Test
new cars, fine; but does the Uni
versity feel an obligation to batter
our cars to bits too?
FOR THE BOOKSTORE: Books,
the ones you want. Also ink in

the shades yon want, no red, blown, turquoise, or
heliotrope.
