# Postmen View Stanford; 'Pretty Freshman Girls'
## 10,000 Letters Handled Daily 
### EDA MENDELS 
"I suppose it takes three let
ers home before the folks come
hrough with the check."
That is the way Jim Powers ex
plains the fact that the Stanford
Post Office handles 10,000
pieces of first-class out-going
mail per day, but has much less
coming in.
Powers is one of the 18 men em
ployed at the Stanford Post Office,
and from his spot behind the bars
and little windows he and his co
workers have a good view of the
Stanford student body.
"Everyone is pretty darn nice, i
And patient," put in Kent Davick. j
Davick serves at the General De
livery window much of the time.
After hearing him greet customer
after customer by name, we asked
Davick what system he used to re
member the 700 students who get
their mail from General Delivery.
But he credits no special system.
DIFFERENT PEOPLE
"Each person has something dif
ferent about him, how he talks or
smiles. We see these people every
day, just like you see your friends.
We think of them as our friends,
and we get to know them."
When asked whether the men had
observed any campus trends through
the years, Pete Cava piped up, "The
girls are getting more beautiful ev
ery year. The freshmen, you know."
He complained that some people
mistook the Post Office for a jail.
The others chimed in with wistful
talk about the projected new build
ing. Davick said, in the best of of
ficial tones, that it was to be built
"in the near future." But David
Latimer remarked with a dry grin
that this plan had been under dis
cussion since Hoover's term in the
White House.
BUILDING PLANS
Jack Callahan, superintendent of
the Post Office, elaborated on build
ing plans. He said that a new build
ing may possibly be started next
year. Improved facilities would in
clude more windows and more indi
vidual boxes. The current Post Of
fice is the one built in 1900, plus two
additions.
Eight* mail deliveries are made to
the Stanford Post Office every day.
Mail is put in the individual boxes
three times daily, at 9 a.m., and 2
and 5 p.m. "Some people check ev
ery half-hour," the men observed.
The campus Post Office has not

only the Christmas rush, but simi
larly busy seasons in June after
school is out and in September when
the students return. Especialy in fall
Post Office employees are kept busy
supplying the exact addresses for
the many letters that are' received
addressed to a student simply '"Stan
ford Universiy." The work is com
plicated by many students' failure
to file the proper change of address
cards.
DEAD LETTERS
Attention switched to dead letters,
of which the Post Office receives an
average of 10 per month. Powers
pulled out a post card and read:
" 'Dear Folks, I will arrive at Bur
bank Airport , , . Thanksgiving day.
. . . Love, Pete.' Neither address nor
return address. So the folks didn't
know when Pete was coming in."
Cava mentioned the problem of
poorly wrapped packages which stu
dents try to mail. He deplored, in
particular, the sending of tin laun
dry cases with sharp, rough edges
and screws, Post Office personnel
are likely to hurt their hands on
such boxes.
The Post Office also maintains a
unit in Stanford Village. Service
there is exclusively by carrier, for
there is no General Delivery.
