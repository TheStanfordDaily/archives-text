# Junior Violates Honor Code
## 
### 
The Council for Student Control
rccontly found a junior in the De
partment of Mineralogy guilty of an
I Honor Code violation and sentenced
I him to an F in the course and a
I suspended suspension from the Uni
versity.
A suspended suspension provides
for probation until graduation, so
| that if the student incurs an Honor
! Code violation again, the Council
j will invoke the suspension.
The student pleaded guilty to the
charge of copying answers into his
lab notebook kept for a mineralogy
course. It was established that his
calculations, for the most part., were
done independently, and only the
answers were copied from another
student.
The professor, who appeared brief
ly before the Council, stated that
he had made no formal announce
ment of the extent to which col
laboration was to be permitted, and
that community effort was permits
able, although not to the extent of
this case.
The student argued that lie did not
realize that an Honor Code viola
tion was involved at the time he
copied the answers, but said that
when questioned by the lab instruc
tor, lie admitted all the details at
oncc.
