# Del De Young wants to know:
## What sort of work is involved in technical sales at Du Pont? Clarence ”Ding” Bell answers: 
### 
Well, if I said "All sorts," it might sound a hit vague to
you, Del, but it would he very close to the truth. That's
because technical sales work at Du Pont—bearing in
mind the great diversit yof products we have—is broader
in scope than a lot of other technical assignments, and
requires additional talents.
Let's suppose that one of Du Pout's customers is
having technical difficulties—needs help in adapting
"Teflon" to a specific gasketing application, for exam
ple. When our sales representative calls, he naturally
must carry with him the engineering knowledge that 's
the basis for sound technical advice —data on flexural
fatigue, chemical passivity, and deformation under load.
The customer is receptive. He wants to make a better
product, increase his sales, reduce costs —or do all three.
Naturally, he's looking for reliable technical advice and
intelligent actions that apply to his specific conditions.
With the cooperation of the customer and help from
our own research people, when necessary, the problem
will sooner or later be "licked."
We have found, though, that if a technical service

man is going to be truly effective in such a situation, he
must possess certain human qualities in addition to his
technical ability. That is, he must really like people and
he sincerely interested in helping them solve their prob
lems. He must —in every sense of the word —be an
"ambassador" who can handle human relationships
smoothly and effectively.
Take the depth suggested by this simple example,
Del. and multiply it by a breadth representing all the
challenging problems you'll run into with Du Font's
diversity of products. If your slide rule isn't too far out
of alignment, the resulting area should give you some
idea of what 1 meant by "all sorts" of work.
Let me emphasize one more point. The importance of
effective sales work is fully understood and appreciated
.il l)u Pont! In the past, sales work has been one of the
active roads to top management jobs. There is every
reason to believe that this will continue in the future.

Take the depth suggested by this simple example,

challenging problems you'll run into with Du Font's
diversity of products. If your slide rule isn't too far out

effective sales work is fully understood and appreciated

Delbert N. De Young received a R.S. in Chera. ling. from I he Universil y
of Wisconsin Jast June. Now he is working for an M.S. degree. By asking
questions, he's learned that many excellent industrial opportunities aro
passed over because they're not understood by the average undergraduate.


Clarence D. Bell, R.S., Chem. Kng., Univ. of
I'ills. (19.17), joined Du Pont as a chemical engineer
immediately after graduation. He began in there-
Kcareh group ol' the Ammonia Department, pro
gressed steadily through assignments on nylon and a
number of other products. Today he is an Assistant
Director of Sales in the Polychemicals Department.
Well, if I said "All sorts," it might sound a hit vague to
you, Del, but it would he very close to the truth. That's
because technical sales work at Du Pont—bearing in
mind the great diversit yof products we have—is broader
in scope than a lot of other technical assignments, and
requires additional talents.
Let's suppose that one of Du Pout's customers is
having technical difficulties—needs help in adapting
"Teflon" to a specific gasketing application, for exam
ple. When our sales representative calls, he naturally
must carry with him the engineering knowledge that 's
the basis for sound technical advice —data on flexural
fatigue, chemical passivity, and deformation under load.
