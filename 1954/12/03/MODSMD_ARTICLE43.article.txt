# FOREIGN STUDENT INTERVIEW
## Pakistan Scholar Explains Her Country's Problems 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Musharraf (Muni) Soofi, joint ASSU and Cap and Gown Foreign
Scholar from Pakistan, felt terribly confused and frightened on
her arrival in the United States two months ago, but now joyfully
admits that she feels an integral part of the Stanford community
because of the friendliness and helpfulness of her new American
friends.
"This spontaneous, friendly behavior," the tiny Pakistani girl

remarked in a recent interview, "is
a marked characteristic of the
American people."
Considering the educational dif
ferences between the United States
and India, where she received her
formal education, Muni believes that
she has seen "education in the true
liberal spirit here at Sanford."
"It is a pity that we put so much
emphasis on grades in my country,"
she remarked. "Also emphasis is all
on the dignified, academic side;
there is no opportunity for sponta
neous expression as there is here."
Muni, who is working for the
Master's degree in education,
laughed when she told how she liked
the "patriotic spirit here at Stan

ford." "When 1 mentioned that I
liked the university at Berkeley, all
my friends flared up and asked me
how I could possibly say that."
Turning the focus onto conditions
in her native country, Muni said
that before she left late in the sum
mer, affairs were quite stable and the
people had great faith in Mohammed
Ali.
"Since then," she said, "there has
been unrest in the Constitutional
Assembly resulting in a changeover
in the cabinet." She added that be
fore she left, this provisional assem
bly was planning to submit a con
stitution providing for a republican
form of government by Jan. 1.
KASHMIR DISPUTE
In regard to the clash between
India and Pakistan over the area of
Kashmir, Muni asserted that the
Pakistani people think that "politi
cally, economically, socially, and re
ligiously, Kashmir is ours and ours
alone.
"The tenseness between us and
our neighbors results from a differ
ence in ideologies, one being that
we arc tied up with the Western
powers, whereas India is attempting
to remain neutral."
"Also," she remarked, "India is
indirectly asking Moslems residing
in India to change their faith and
this is a thing we Moslems cannot
take." She cited the refugee prob
lem in Pakistan arising from the
hordes of Moslems pouring in from
all over India, causing Pakistan se
rious housing, food, and educational
problems.
"We arc the youngest nation in

Asia," Muni pointed out, "and are
now passing through a transitional
stage in which we need much help
to put us on our feet. Our main
problem lies in the securing of capi
tal goods, mainly machinery.
UNITED STATES AID
"The United States is giving us
much economic and military aid to
help get us started. We like the
United States and are sure that the
Americ&ns are acting purely out of
humanitarian interests."
"We hope that the American atti
tude toward our educational and de
velopmental problems will remain
the same," she added. "The British
attitude toward our problem is still
colonial, tending to override us."
Muni cited a few of the new prob
lems facing the young Asian nation.
One is a new development in the old
India-Pakistan feud—that of dam
ming a tributary of the Indus River
by the Indians, thereby cutting off
much of the water which flows down
the Indus to irrigate West Pakistan.
"The monsoons do not affect Paki
stan," Muni said, "and we depend
wholely on water from our Indus
River."
"We are hoping," she said, "that
the United Nations will do some
, thing about this and the Kashmir
problem."

Kashmir, Muni asserted that the
Pakistani people think that "politi
cally, economically, socially, and re
ligiously, Kashmir is ours and ours
alone.
"The tenseness between us and
our neighbors results from a differ
ence in ideologies, one being that
we arc tied up with the Western
powers, whereas India is attempting
to remain neutral."
"Also," she remarked, "India is
indirectly asking Moslems residing
in India to change their faith and
this is a thing we Moslems cannot
take." She cited the refugee prob
lem in Pakistan arising from the
hordes of Moslems pouring in from
all over India, causing Pakistan se
rious housing, food, and educational
problems.
"We arc the youngest nation in

Asia," Muni pointed out, "and are
now passing through a transitional
stage in which we need much help
to put us on our feet. Our main
problem lies in the securing of capi
tal goods, mainly machinery.
UNITED STATES AID
"The United States is giving us
much economic and military aid to
help get us started. We like the
United States and are sure that the
Americ&ns are acting purely out of
humanitarian interests."
"We hope that the American atti
tude toward our educational and de
velopmental problems will remain
the same," she added. "The British
attitude toward our problem is still
colonial, tending to override us."
Muni cited a few of the new prob
lems facing the young Asian nation.
One is a new development in the old
India-Pakistan feud—that of dam
ming a tributary of the Indus River
by the Indians, thereby cutting off
much of the water which flows down
the Indus to irrigate West Pakistan.
"The monsoons do not affect Paki
stan," Muni said, "and we depend
wholely on water from our Indus
River."
"We are hoping," she said, "that
the United Nations will do some
, thing about this and the Kashmir
problem."


MUSIIARRAF (MUNI) SOOFI
—"Americans are friendly"
Musharraf (Muni) Soofi, joint ASSU and Cap and Gown Foreign
Scholar from Pakistan, felt terribly confused and frightened on
her arrival in the United States two months ago, but now joyfully
admits that she feels an integral part of the Stanford community
because of the friendliness and helpfulness of her new American
friends.
"This spontaneous, friendly behavior," the tiny Pakistani girl

remarked in a recent interview, "is
a marked characteristic of the
American people."
Considering the educational dif
ferences between the United States
and India, where she received her
formal education, Muni believes that
she has seen "education in the true
liberal spirit here at Sanford."
"It is a pity that we put so much
emphasis on grades in my country,"
she remarked. "Also emphasis is all
on the dignified, academic side;
there is no opportunity for sponta
neous expression as there is here."
Muni, who is working for the
Master's degree in education,
laughed when she told how she liked
the "patriotic spirit here at Stan

ford." "When 1 mentioned that I
liked the university at Berkeley, all
my friends flared up and asked me
how I could possibly say that."
Turning the focus onto conditions
in her native country, Muni said
that before she left late in the sum
mer, affairs were quite stable and the
people had great faith in Mohammed
Ali.
"Since then," she said, "there has
been unrest in the Constitutional
Assembly resulting in a changeover
in the cabinet." She added that be
fore she left, this provisional assem
bly was planning to submit a con
stitution providing for a republican
form of government by Jan. 1.
