# Pre-med Group Discussion Held
## 
### JOHN McFEE 
The pre-medical advising system [
and curriculum were thoroughly
aired Tuesday night by a group of
students, teachers, administrators,
and others interested in pre-medical
education.
The meeting resulted from the I
publication of a critique last spring
by Sigma Phi Sigma, Stanford pre
medical society, in which it was felt j
that pre-medical advising and cur- |
riculum could be improved.
Most of the discussion, under j
moderator John Paciulli, centered
around the question of "What is the
role of the pre-medical adviser?"
The adviser problem throughout the
University, it was pointed out, boils
down to a discrepancy of what the
adviser expects of the student and
vice-versa.
Advisers assume that each student j
has an interest in some subject, and
that he can and must "decide for
himself what major and occupation
he should enter.
Many students, on the other hand,
feel that the adviser, in addition to
answering specific questions on
courses, majors, and occupations. I
should give them some motivation
to go into a field and decide for them
which fields would be suitable. This j
of course is impossible for an ad- !
viser to do, the group agreed.
