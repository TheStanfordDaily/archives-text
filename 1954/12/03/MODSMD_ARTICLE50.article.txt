THE OPERATOR
On every American campus there are four standard fixtures:
No. 1 — ivy; No. 2 — a statue of the founder; No. IJ — Philip Morris
Cigarettes; No. 4 — The Operator.
The ivy is to prevent strangers from mistaking the college for
a warehouse. The statue of the founder provides shade for necking
when the weather is fine. The Philip Morris Cigarettes are an aid
to concentration when you are studious, an aid to sociability when
you are sportive, and a source of smoke rings to impress new girls
... And The Operator is the man you can't do without.
Well do I remember The Operator on my campus. He was a young
man with a ready smile, a quick mind, fifteen complete changes of
wardrobe, a six room apartment, a red convertible, and assorted
stocks, bonds, securities, and second mortgages.
i The Operator's origins were a source of lively speculation. Some
said he was left over from the old Capone gang. Some said he was
Judge Crater. Some said he sprang from the brow of Zeus.
But, in fact, he was just an ordinary student —to begin with. In
his first year he studied hard, took copious lecture notes, got good
, grades, and made a big reputation as a friend in need. He'd lend
. you money; he'd let you copy his lecture notes; he'd write themes
for you; he'd sit up all night to help you cram for an exam. All of
, this was done with infinite good nature on his part, and no obligation
on yours . . . The first year, that is.
In the second year The Operator started to operate. He'd still let
you copy his lecture notes — but it cost you a quarter. Sitting up to
help you cram cost 50 cents an hour till midnight, 75 cents an hour
. afterwards. His prices for writing themes were based on a sliding
scale — a dollar for a "C", two for a "B", three for an "A". A "D"
co.it you nothing, and if you flunked, you got a dollar credit on the
next theme he wrote for you. , ,
• His services expanded steadily. He added a line of cribs for
. examinations..He booked bets on football games. He did a bit of
bootlegging. He ran a date bureau. He rented cars, tuxedos, non-wilt
ing boutonnieres. ,
But all of these were really sidelines. His main line was lending
? money. At any hour of the day or night, for any amount from a dollar
' to a hundred, The Operator was always ready with a sympathetic
ear and cash on the barrelhead. And he rarely charged more than
150 percent interest.
Usury and sharp trading are practices not calculated to win
affection. Nobody loved The Operator. But nobody did anything
about it either . . . Because undergraduates live in a perpetual state
• of need — need of money, need of lecture notes, need of romance,
need of beer, need of something —and The Operator was the goose
that laid the golden eggs and, therefore, safe.
Nor did The Operator seek alfection. He just went his well
• heeled way, serene and carefree . . . No, not carefree. One
thing troubled him: a fear that some day he might graduate. Gradu
ation, leaving school, would mean the end of his empire. You can't
run a business like that from the outside; you must be right in the
midst of things, spotting opportunities, anticipating needs, keeping
your finger on the public pulse.
So he took great pains to stay in school, but never to graduate.
This he accomplished, by constantly shifting majors. He would come
within a semester of getting a B.A. in sociology and then transfer
to law. When he had nearly enough law credits, he'd switch to
business administration. Then from business administration to
psychology, from psychology to French, from French to history,
and so on, meanwhile getting cultured as all get-out, rich as Croesus,
and never accumulating quite enough credits for a degree.
Finally, of course, it caught up with him. There came a semester
when no matter what he took, he had to wind up with some kind of
a degree. He looked frantically through the class schedule trying to
find some major he hadn't tried yet. And he found one — physical
education. So, sleek and pudgy though he was from high living, The
Operator entered the department of physical ed.
It was a mistake. Among the people he had to wrestle and box
with were some great hulking fellows who, like everybody else on
campus, owed him money.
Their tiny foreheads creased with glee as they regarded The
Operator's trembling little body; their massive biceps swelled joy
ously; their flexors rippled with delight. Rumbling happily, they
fell upon him and covered him with lumps, the smallest of which
would have taken first prize in any lump contest you might name.
Confused and sick at heart, The Operator dragged his battered
members home. He knew he had to get out of physical ed; his life
was forfeit if he did not. So, unhappily, he transferred to some other
course, and the following June, a beaten man in his cap and gown,
received with lifeless hands a diploma and a bachelor of arts degree
and shambled out into the great world.
I don't know what happened to The Operator after graduation.
It's not a bad guess that he's serving time in some pokey somewhere.
Or maybe he was lucky and went into the advertising business. If so,
he is surely a big man on Madison Avenue today.
But, as I say, I don't know what happened to him. But this I do
know: another Operator appeared on campus as soon as this one
left, and he in turn was replaced by another, and the process goes
on endlessly.
For as long as boy students like girl students batter than going
to class, as long as parents cling to the delusion that the allowance
they had at college is sufficient for their children, as long as blood
runs warm and cash runs short, there will be an Operator operating*
on every campus everywhere. ,

ear and cash on the barrelhead. And he rarely charged more than
150 percent interest.

affection. Nobody loved The Operator. But nobody did anything
about it either . . . Because undergraduates live in a perpetual state

within a semester of getting a B.A. in sociology and then transfer
to law. When he had nearly enough law credits, he'd switch to
business administration. Then from business administration to
psychology, from psychology to French, from French to history,

when no matter what he took, he had to wind up with some kind of

education. So, sleek and pudgy though he was from high living, The

campus, owed him money.

Operator's trembling little body; their massive biceps swelled joy

fell upon him and covered him with lumps, the smallest of which

Confused and sick at heart, The Operator dragged his battered
members home. He knew he had to get out of physical ed; his life
was forfeit if he did not. So, unhappily, he transferred to some other
course, and the following June, a beaten man in his cap and gown,
received with lifeless hands a diploma and a bachelor of arts degree
and shambled out into the great world.
I don't know what happened to The Operator after graduation.
It's not a bad guess that he's serving time in some pokey somewhere.
Or maybe he was lucky and went into the advertising business. If so,
he is surely a big man on Madison Avenue today.
But, as I say, I don't know what happened to him. But this I do
know: another Operator appeared on campus as soon as this one
left, and he in turn was replaced by another, and the process goes
on endlessly.

THE OPERATOR
On every American campus there are four standard fixtures:
No. 1 — ivy; No. 2 — a statue of the founder; No. IJ — Philip Morris
Cigarettes; No. 4 — The Operator.
The ivy is to prevent strangers from mistaking the college for
a warehouse. The statue of the founder provides shade for necking
when the weather is fine. The Philip Morris Cigarettes are an aid
to concentration when you are studious, an aid to sociability when
you are sportive, and a source of smoke rings to impress new girls
... And The Operator is the man you can't do without.
Well do I remember The Operator on my campus. He was a young
man with a ready smile, a quick mind, fifteen complete changes of
wardrobe, a six room apartment, a red convertible, and assorted
stocks, bonds, securities, and second mortgages.
i The Operator's origins were a source of lively speculation. Some
said he was left over from the old Capone gang. Some said he was
Judge Crater. Some said he sprang from the brow of Zeus.
But, in fact, he was just an ordinary student —to begin with. In
his first year he studied hard, took copious lecture notes, got good
, grades, and made a big reputation as a friend in need. He'd lend
. you money; he'd let you copy his lecture notes; he'd write themes
for you; he'd sit up all night to help you cram for an exam. All of
, this was done with infinite good nature on his part, and no obligation
on yours . . . The first year, that is.
In the second year The Operator started to operate. He'd still let
you copy his lecture notes — but it cost you a quarter. Sitting up to
help you cram cost 50 cents an hour till midnight, 75 cents an hour
. afterwards. His prices for writing themes were based on a sliding
scale — a dollar for a "C", two for a "B", three for an "A". A "D"
co.it you nothing, and if you flunked, you got a dollar credit on the
next theme he wrote for you. , ,

when no matter what he took, he had to wind up with some kind of

education. So, sleek and pudgy though he was from high living, The

Confused and sick at heart, The Operator dragged his battered
members home. He knew he had to get out of physical ed; his life
was forfeit if he did not. So, unhappily, he transferred to some other
course, and the following June, a beaten man in his cap and gown,
received with lifeless hands a diploma and a bachelor of arts degree
and shambled out into the great world.
I don't know what happened to The Operator after graduation.
It's not a bad guess that he's serving time in some pokey somewhere.
Or maybe he was lucky and went into the advertising business. If so,
he is surely a big man on Madison Avenue today.
But, as I say, I don't know what happened to him. But this I do
know: another Operator appeared on campus as soon as this one
left, and he in turn was replaced by another, and the process goes
on endlessly.
For as long as boy students like girl students batter than going
to class, as long as parents cling to the delusion that the allowance
they had at college is sufficient for their children, as long as blood
runs warm and cash runs short, there will be an Operator operating*
on every campus everywhere. ,

THE OPERATOR
On every American campus there are four standard fixtures:
No. 1 — ivy; No. 2 — a statue of the founder; No. IJ — Philip Morris
Cigarettes; No. 4 — The Operator.
The ivy is to prevent strangers from mistaking the college for
a warehouse. The statue of the founder provides shade for necking
when the weather is fine. The Philip Morris Cigarettes are an aid
to concentration when you are studious, an aid to sociability when
you are sportive, and a source of smoke rings to impress new girls
... And The Operator is the man you can't do without.
Well do I remember The Operator on my campus. He was a young
man with a ready smile, a quick mind, fifteen complete changes of
wardrobe, a six room apartment, a red convertible, and assorted
stocks, bonds, securities, and second mortgages.
i The Operator's origins were a source of lively speculation. Some
said he was left over from the old Capone gang. Some said he was
Judge Crater. Some said he sprang from the brow of Zeus.
But, in fact, he was just an ordinary student —to begin with. In
his first year he studied hard, took copious lecture notes, got good
, grades, and made a big reputation as a friend in need. He'd lend
. you money; he'd let you copy his lecture notes; he'd write themes
for you; he'd sit up all night to help you cram for an exam. All of
, this was done with infinite good nature on his part, and no obligation
on yours . . . The first year, that is.
In the second year The Operator started to operate. He'd still let
you copy his lecture notes — but it cost you a quarter. Sitting up to
help you cram cost 50 cents an hour till midnight, 75 cents an hour
. afterwards. His prices for writing themes were based on a sliding
scale — a dollar for a "C", two for a "B", three for an "A". A "D"
co.it you nothing, and if you flunked, you got a dollar credit on the
next theme he wrote for you. , ,
• His services expanded steadily. He added a line of cribs for
. examinations..He booked bets on football games. He did a bit of
bootlegging. He ran a date bureau. He rented cars, tuxedos, non-wilt
ing boutonnieres. ,
But all of these were really sidelines. His main line was lending
? money. At any hour of the day or night, for any amount from a dollar
' to a hundred, The Operator was always ready with a sympathetic
ear and cash on the barrelhead. And he rarely charged more than
150 percent interest.
Usury and sharp trading are practices not calculated to win
affection. Nobody loved The Operator. But nobody did anything
about it either . . . Because undergraduates live in a perpetual state
• of need — need of money, need of lecture notes, need of romance,
need of beer, need of something —and The Operator was the goose
that laid the golden eggs and, therefore, safe.
Nor did The Operator seek alfection. He just went his well
• heeled way, serene and carefree . . . No, not carefree. One
thing troubled him: a fear that some day he might graduate. Gradu
ation, leaving school, would mean the end of his empire. You can't
run a business like that from the outside; you must be right in the
midst of things, spotting opportunities, anticipating needs, keeping
your finger on the public pulse.
So he took great pains to stay in school, but never to graduate.
This he accomplished, by constantly shifting majors. He would come
within a semester of getting a B.A. in sociology and then transfer
to law. When he had nearly enough law credits, he'd switch to
business administration. Then from business administration to
psychology, from psychology to French, from French to history,
and so on, meanwhile getting cultured as all get-out, rich as Croesus,
and never accumulating quite enough credits for a degree.
Finally, of course, it caught up with him. There came a semester
when no matter what he took, he had to wind up with some kind of
