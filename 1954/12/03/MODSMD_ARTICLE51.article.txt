# WUS Drive Planned
## 
### 

GOOD FlTâ€”Students in Berlin are shown trying on clothes sent
to them by World University Service. A clothing and book drive
will be conducted here during dead week and finals weeks so
that WUS can continue to supply needy students abroad with
the textbooks and clothes which are scarce and expensive in
their native lands. The Stanford International Relief Organiza
tion, working through representatives in each of the living
groups, will place cardboard boxes in each of the residences
in which students may place their contributions of books, maga
zines, and clothing of any and all types.
