## Consul General Discusses Japanese Trade Problems 
### WALLY SIMPSON 
"If Japan is to survive, she must have markets for her exports."
So stated Tomihiko Kambara, San Francisco Consul General of
Japan, to the members of the Conference Department of the In
stitute of International Relations and visitors at the Bowman Alumni
House yesterday afternoon.
In a resume of Japan's trade situation, Kambara explained some

of the reasons for Japan's present
trade enigma. Before World War II
Japan was able to keep a> balanced
economy by trading with her natural
market which was Eastern and
Southeastern Asia. But now, ac
cording to Consul Kambara, since
the cessation of hostilities, that,
market which she needs has been
lost to her.
Up to the present lime, he ex
plained, the large amount of pur
chases made by the United States
Armed Forces in Japan has kept the
economic situation in Japan o.m a
reasonably even keel. But with the
imminent withdrawal of American
troops, Japan's largest market is
about to disappear.
Kambara stated that there are

â™¦
I factions within the Japanese Govcrn
| ment who do favor a commencement
of trade with Communist bloc na
tions. But, by and large, the major
ity of the Japanese people prefer not
to have any trade relations what
soever with them.
Kambara warned, however, that
unless Japan does find foreign mar
kets among the nations of the free
world, she may be forced to accept
1 the lucrative trade prospects thjit are
being proposed by the Communists.
"Japan has come to serve as the
bulwark of the free world in the
far East. It would be to the mutual
benefit of both Japan and the United
States to keep Japan's economy from
I collapsing," said Kambara.
