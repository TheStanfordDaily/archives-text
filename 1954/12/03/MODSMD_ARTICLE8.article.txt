# Reviewer Calls 'Alchemist' An Opening Wight Success
## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
The combination of an entertaining plot and excellent produc
tion won laughter and applause from the first-nighters of the Stan
ford Players' production of Ben Jonson's "The Alchemist." The
opening night was a definite success.
Triumphantly surmounting the hurdles of time, the 17th century

farce retained all of its biting
and satire in a well-knit presenta- I
tion under the direction of Robert
Loper.
The human situation of honest
men, fools, and rogues came through
to the audience with all its original j
force and vigor. Except for the
technical jargon of the day regard- j
ing science and alchemy, the action j
and speech of the play was most
understandable and very hilarious !
ACTING PJ AUDITS
Improving on a rather slow-mov
ing first few moments, the play grew
in momentum until the last part of
the second act resembled, in its fast '
and furious action, the Marx broth- J
ers at their most hilarious.
Characterizations throughout were
well done, with special acting plau
dits going to David O'Brien for a |
facile portrayal of Face, the butler
and the "brains" of the outfit, j
O'Brien did a masterful job of por- !
tray ing the rogue, delighting in his j
villainy and adroitly cozening his j
victims with skill and finesse.
Happily possessed of a mobile and
adaptable face, O'Brien's characteri
zation ran the gamut of emotions, |
from delighted amusement at a sue- j

: 1 stratagem to super-cunning
j when handling a difficult client.
Complementing his performance
were AstriH Wilhrud as Dol! Com
mon, the prostitute; and Thomas
Luce as Subtle, a rogue posing as
an alchemist. Miss Willsrud in her
walk, manner or speech, and affected
mannerisms, as woll as occasional
earthy touches, gave a convincing
portrayal of the woman of the
streets.
THE ALCHEMIST
As the supposed alchemist, Luce
j imparted the necessary dignity to
| the role, as well as the unctuous
| voieo and dramatic actions. His
I abrupt reversals to his natural role
of the scheming rascal were delight
fid to the audience, as well as con
| tributing to the humor of the play.
Standouts in the minor roles were
| Charles Lyons as Sir Epicure Mam-
I mon, a gullible and greedy lecher;
i and Hugo Melehione as Ananias, the
j self-righteous par-tor of a congrega
i tion of fanatical Puritans, possessed
of much zeal and not the slightest,
bit of humor.
Other good characterizations were
given hy Mark Franklin in the role
of Surly; David Penhallow as an
impressionable lawyer's clerk; Hart
Sprager as Kastril, a boastful coun
try boy; and John Benedict, as Abel
Drugger, a bustling tobacconist.
MINOR ROLES
Others in the ca.' t wfcre Reid Low
den as Tribulation Wholesome, an
other of the Puritans; Carolyn Cow
an as Kastril's rich widowed sister;
Douglas Cook, who made a good im
pression in his brief appearance as
Lovewit, the master of the house;
and Daniel Cohen, Nancy McDonald,
Walter Brown, Gloria Reval. Flora
Kirschner, and G< orge Ralph as
neighbors and officers.
Special credit uoes to Virginia
Opsvig for her colorful and imagina
-1 live costuming and to Hugo Mcl
chione for a realistic stage setting.
