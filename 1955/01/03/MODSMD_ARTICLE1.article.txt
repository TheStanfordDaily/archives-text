# VA, Farm Agree to Build Hospital on Stanford Site
## Work Will Take 5 Yrs. 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS Associate Editor, The Daily 
The final agreement to build
a $20 million neuropsychiatric
hospital on Stanford land was
reached recently by the Veter- j
ans Administration and Stanford.
The VA announced that it will start
condemnation proceedings immedi
ately in order to acquire a triangular
.site of 110 acres at the southeast
corner of Stanford's land holdings.
The proposed hospital will contain
1000 beds, and will give employment
to 1000 employees, three-fourths of
whom will be professional, skilled, or
semi-skilled, according to VA offi
cials. It will be divided into two
major divisions, one with 750 beds for
neuropsychiatric patients, and the
other with 250 beds for general med
ical and surgical use.
VA spokesmen have stated that the
hospital will take five years to com
plete.
STERLING COMMENT
President Sterling, commenting on
the transaction, said, "We have been
informed by oar attorneys of the
sweeping powers of condemnation
conferred on the Veterans Adminis
tration by federal law. In the light
of these powers, the course open to
us was to take appropriate steps to
assure that the University is prop
erly compensated."
Although no official announcement |
has been made, the cost of the land i
purchase has been estimated at
$f>60,000, about $6,000 per acre.
President Sterling brought out the
fact that the final location chosen is
different from the first location sug
gested. The original site was facing
Page Mill Road.
The site finally agreed upon is
bounded by Junipero Scrra Boule
vard, Arastradcro Road, the right
of-way of the Southern Pacific's Los
Gates branch line, a short section of
the Stanford land boundary, and
Matadero Creek.
ADVANTAGES CITED
Pointing out the advantages of the
hospital to Stanford, Sterling com
mented, "Both units of the hospital
will be made available to the Stan
ford Medical School for teaching
purposes. Such an arrangement will
be mutually advantageous. The VA
associates its hospitals with an im
portant medical school wherever
possible in order to obtain a high
standard of care for its patients. For
Stanford's part, the hospital will ad
vance materially the University's

plan to transfer its Medical School
from San Francisco to the Palo Alto
campus."
The agreement climaxed months
of negotiation, and overrode protests
from spokesmen from Los Altos, the
campus residential areas and Barron
Park.
However, a Stanford spokesman
said that the Board of Trustees was
under comparatively little pressure
from opponents of the hospital, be
cause far more letters favoring the
VA hospital were received than op
posing it. All the local veterans
organizations were on record in
favor of the hospital- plan.
Professor Vergil Anderson from the
Speech and Drama Department, who
was one of the leaders of the pro
tests from the campus residential
areas, said that the fmal site is far
enough away from campus to lessen
any danger to residents and students.
"Our feelings here were originally
aroused partly by the fact that the
site chosen was much closer to camp
us than the site finally agreed up
on," explained Anderson. "The
Board of Trustees knew our feelings
and considered them fully. In the
light of this they made the decision

that, they considered best. We had
our say and that was all wc wanted."
ANNEXATION PROBABLE
A Stanford spokesman has said
that the hospital site would prob
ably be annexed to the city of Palo
Alto in order to have access to sew
age, water, fire protection, and other
municipal services. Also, he con
tinued, it has been Stanford's policy
to have its land, when leased for
private development, annexed to Palo
Alto.
The hospital transaction was com
pleted by condemnation rather than
by simple negotiation because Stan
ford's founder's grant prohibited the
sale of university property, explained
Alf Brandin, Business Manager and
Executive Officer for Land Develop
ment.
ARCHITECTURAL PLANS
Brandin commented on the archi

tectural plans for the hospital, saying
that the Government planners will
cooperate with Stanford to make the
building harmonize with the sur
roundings as much as possible.
Harvey Higley, VA administrator,
has assured Stanford officials that in
planning the hospital, there will be
full recognition of the "rural set
ting." He said that the VA wants to
develop buildings that will fit into
the community.
Palo Alto Mayor Clifford Simpson
expressed his approval of the tran
saction: "I think it is a 4 wonderful
thing for the area. It will contribute
very materially toward establish
ment of Palo Alto as one of the finer
and better medical centers in the
country. I'm very pleased they've
decided to locate here."

NEW VETS HOSPITAL—A new S2O million neuropsychiatric hospital will be built on this site
south of the Stanford campus area. The site is bounded by Arastradero Road, the Southern Pa
cific's Los Gatos track, a short section of the Stanford land boundary joining the track to Matadero
Creek, the creek itself, and lunipero Serra Boulevard. On gently-rolling land, the site encom

semi-skilled, according to VA offi
cials. It will be divided into two
major divisions, one with 750 beds for
neuropsychiatric patients, and the
other with 250 beds for general med
ical and surgical use.
VA spokesmen have stated that the
hospital will take five years to com
plete.
STERLING COMMENT
President Sterling, commenting on
the transaction, said, "We have been
informed by oar attorneys of the
sweeping powers of condemnation
conferred on the Veterans Adminis
tration by federal law. In the light
of these powers, the course open to
us was to take appropriate steps to
assure that the University is prop
erly compensated."
Although no official announcement |
has been made, the cost of the land i
purchase has been estimated at
$f>60,000, about $6,000 per acre.
President Sterling brought out the
fact that the final location chosen is
different from the first location sug
gested. The original site was facing
Page Mill Road.
The site finally agreed upon is
bounded by Junipero Scrra Boule
vard, Arastradcro Road, the right
of-way of the Southern Pacific's Los
Gates branch line, a short section of
the Stanford land boundary, and
Matadero Creek.
ADVANTAGES CITED
Pointing out the advantages of the
hospital to Stanford, Sterling com
mented, "Both units of the hospital
will be made available to the Stan
ford Medical School for teaching
purposes. Such an arrangement will
be mutually advantageous. The VA
associates its hospitals with an im
portant medical school wherever
possible in order to obtain a high
standard of care for its patients. For
Stanford's part, the hospital will ad
vance materially the University's

plan to transfer its Medical School
from San Francisco to the Palo Alto
campus."
The agreement climaxed months
of negotiation, and overrode protests
from spokesmen from Los Altos, the
campus residential areas and Barron
Park.
However, a Stanford spokesman
said that the Board of Trustees was
under comparatively little pressure
from opponents of the hospital, be
cause far more letters favoring the
VA hospital were received than op
posing it. All the local veterans
organizations were on record in
favor of the hospital- plan.
Professor Vergil Anderson from the
Speech and Drama Department, who
was one of the leaders of the pro
tests from the campus residential
areas, said that the fmal site is far
enough away from campus to lessen
any danger to residents and students.
"Our feelings here were originally
aroused partly by the fact that the
site chosen was much closer to camp
us than the site finally agreed up
on," explained Anderson. "The
Board of Trustees knew our feelings
and considered them fully. In the
light of this they made the decision

that, they considered best. We had
our say and that was all wc wanted."
ANNEXATION PROBABLE
A Stanford spokesman has said
that the hospital site would prob
ably be annexed to the city of Palo
Alto in order to have access to sew
age, water, fire protection, and other
municipal services. Also, he con
tinued, it has been Stanford's policy
to have its land, when leased for
private development, annexed to Palo
Alto.
The hospital transaction was com
pleted by condemnation rather than
by simple negotiation because Stan
ford's founder's grant prohibited the
sale of university property, explained
Alf Brandin, Business Manager and
Executive Officer for Land Develop
ment.
ARCHITECTURAL PLANS
Brandin commented on the archi

tectural plans for the hospital, saying
that the Government planners will
cooperate with Stanford to make the
building harmonize with the sur
roundings as much as possible.
Harvey Higley, VA administrator,
has assured Stanford officials that in
planning the hospital, there will be
full recognition of the "rural set
ting." He said that the VA wants to
develop buildings that will fit into
the community.
Palo Alto Mayor Clifford Simpson
expressed his approval of the tran
saction: "I think it is a 4 wonderful
thing for the area. It will contribute
very materially toward establish
ment of Palo Alto as one of the finer
and better medical centers in the
country. I'm very pleased they've
decided to locate here."

NEW VETS HOSPITAL—A new S2O million neuropsychiatric hospital will be built on this site
south of the Stanford campus area. The site is bounded by Arastradero Road, the Southern Pa
cific's Los Gatos track, a short section of the Stanford land boundary joining the track to Matadero
Creek, the creek itself, and lunipero Serra Boulevard. On gently-rolling land, the site encom
passes about 110 to 115 acres.
The final agreement to build
a $20 million neuropsychiatric
hospital on Stanford land was
reached recently by the Veter- j
ans Administration and Stanford.
The VA announced that it will start
condemnation proceedings immedi
ately in order to acquire a triangular
.site of 110 acres at the southeast
corner of Stanford's land holdings.
The proposed hospital will contain
1000 beds, and will give employment
to 1000 employees, three-fourths of

us was to take appropriate steps to
assure that the University is prop
erly compensated."
Although no official announcement |
has been made, the cost of the land i
purchase has been estimated at
$f>60,000, about $6,000 per acre.
President Sterling brought out the
fact that the final location chosen is
different from the first location sug
gested. The original site was facing
Page Mill Road.
The site finally agreed upon is
bounded by Junipero Scrra Boule
vard, Arastradcro Road, the right
of-way of the Southern Pacific's Los
Gates branch line, a short section of
the Stanford land boundary, and
Matadero Creek.
ADVANTAGES CITED
Pointing out the advantages of the
hospital to Stanford, Sterling com
mented, "Both units of the hospital
will be made available to the Stan
ford Medical School for teaching
purposes. Such an arrangement will
be mutually advantageous. The VA
associates its hospitals with an im
portant medical school wherever
possible in order to obtain a high
standard of care for its patients. For
Stanford's part, the hospital will ad
vance materially the University's

plan to transfer its Medical School
from San Francisco to the Palo Alto
campus."
The agreement climaxed months
of negotiation, and overrode protests
from spokesmen from Los Altos, the
campus residential areas and Barron
Park.
However, a Stanford spokesman
said that the Board of Trustees was
under comparatively little pressure
from opponents of the hospital, be
cause far more letters favoring the
VA hospital were received than op
posing it. All the local veterans
organizations were on record in
favor of the hospital- plan.
Professor Vergil Anderson from the
Speech and Drama Department, who
was one of the leaders of the pro
tests from the campus residential
areas, said that the fmal site is far
enough away from campus to lessen
any danger to residents and students.
"Our feelings here were originally
aroused partly by the fact that the
site chosen was much closer to camp
us than the site finally agreed up
on," explained Anderson. "The
Board of Trustees knew our feelings
and considered them fully. In the
light of this they made the decision

that, they considered best. We had
our say and that was all wc wanted."
ANNEXATION PROBABLE
A Stanford spokesman has said
that the hospital site would prob
ably be annexed to the city of Palo
Alto in order to have access to sew
age, water, fire protection, and other
municipal services. Also, he con
tinued, it has been Stanford's policy
to have its land, when leased for
private development, annexed to Palo
Alto.
The hospital transaction was com
pleted by condemnation rather than
by simple negotiation because Stan
ford's founder's grant prohibited the
sale of university property, explained
Alf Brandin, Business Manager and
Executive Officer for Land Develop
ment.
ARCHITECTURAL PLANS
Brandin commented on the archi

tectural plans for the hospital, saying
that the Government planners will
cooperate with Stanford to make the
building harmonize with the sur
roundings as much as possible.
Harvey Higley, VA administrator,
has assured Stanford officials that in
planning the hospital, there will be
full recognition of the "rural set
ting." He said that the VA wants to
develop buildings that will fit into
the community.
Palo Alto Mayor Clifford Simpson
expressed his approval of the tran
saction: "I think it is a 4 wonderful
thing for the area. It will contribute
very materially toward establish
ment of Palo Alto as one of the finer
and better medical centers in the
country. I'm very pleased they've
decided to locate here."

NEW VETS HOSPITAL—A new S2O million neuropsychiatric hospital will be built on this site
south of the Stanford campus area. The site is bounded by Arastradero Road, the Southern Pa
cific's Los Gatos track, a short section of the Stanford land boundary joining the track to Matadero
Creek, the creek itself, and lunipero Serra Boulevard. On gently-rolling land, the site encom
passes about 110 to 115 acres.
The final agreement to build
a $20 million neuropsychiatric
hospital on Stanford land was
reached recently by the Veter- j
ans Administration and Stanford.
The VA announced that it will start
condemnation proceedings immedi
ately in order to acquire a triangular
.site of 110 acres at the southeast
corner of Stanford's land holdings.
The proposed hospital will contain
1000 beds, and will give employment
to 1000 employees, three-fourths of
whom will be professional, skilled, or
semi-skilled, according to VA offi
cials. It will be divided into two
major divisions, one with 750 beds for
neuropsychiatric patients, and the
other with 250 beds for general med
ical and surgical use.
VA spokesmen have stated that the
hospital will take five years to com
plete.
STERLING COMMENT
President Sterling, commenting on
the transaction, said, "We have been
informed by oar attorneys of the
sweeping powers of condemnation
conferred on the Veterans Adminis
tration by federal law. In the light
of these powers, the course open to
us was to take appropriate steps to
assure that the University is prop
erly compensated."
