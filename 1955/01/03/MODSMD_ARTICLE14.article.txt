Stanford's 1955 rushing season gets
rolling tomorrow night when a pro
gram of open houses at the eating
clubs will open a week-long sched
ule of rushing for both the clubs and
fraternities.
The clubs will open their doors to
rushees tomorrow, Friday, and Sat
urday nights, while the Row houses
will hold open houses on Wednes
day, Thursday, Friday, and Satur
day nights and Saturday afternoon.
Informal rushing actually began
for the seven clubs at the start of
Christmas vacation, and club mem
bers played host to several hun
dred freshman men at cocktail par
ties and other social affairs during
the holiday period.
Next week both the clubs and the
fraternities will participate in closed
(invitational) rushing.
According to Interclub Council
President Marty Arm burst and In
terfraternity Council President Otis
Winters, dress for the ope# houses
should be casual â€” slacks with a
sweater or sport shirt.
