# Something New Is Added

SURPRISE—Many Stanfordites no doubt took a double take this
morning when they got back to campus and turned onto mile
long Palm Drive, only to be confronted with the newest addition
to the Stanford landscape—a flashing red, yellow, and green
stoplight. The stoplights were installed during Christmas va
cation at the intersection of Palm Drive and what will tentatively
be called the "Embarcadero Cutoff." The cross road was con
structed last quarter to handle traffic to the site of the future
Stanford Shopping Center, and to divert traffic from Menlo Park,
Woodside, and other nearby areas away from campus and onto
El Camino Real. The cutoff is still considered a temporary road,
according to Alf Brandin, University Business Manager. If it be
comes permanent, Brandin added, an underpass at the Palm
Drive intersection will be considered.
