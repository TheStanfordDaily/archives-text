# Outstanding for 1954
## 
### 
The new year has come, bringing with it
the customary good resolutions, optimistic
forecasts, and fresh opportunities. Among men
everywhere there is general agreement to for
get the mistakes of the past, general eagerness
to move ahead in 1955.
For a moment, however, we will focus our
attention to the year just finished. In particular
we would like io commend a handful of stu
dents who went "above and beyond" the pro
verbial "call of duty" to serve Stanford in
1954.
Graduate and undergraduate, active in di
verse fields, they held one interest in common.
Their contributions were designed to benefit the
entire student body.
To these persons go our sincere "thank you"
for helping to make 1954 an enjoyable and con
structive year at Stanford.
To Sieve Horn, Carl Stover and Robb Crist,
the three moderators of the Y Public Affairs
Luncheon group. Due to their continuous in
terest and challenging opinions, the Tuesday
lunch meeting has developed into one of the
most fascinating, provocative hours in the week.
To Liz Livadary for tackling the problem of
student-faculty relations and following through
with it until a special Student-Faculty Com
mittee was established. Hers was the first uni
fied, constructive program for increasing the
contact between students and professors to be
presented at Stanford in many years.
To Grant Spaeth I or an outstanding job as co
chairman of the Foreign Scholarship Commit
tee until graduation last June. He spent the

summer trying to unsnarl the legal and diplo
matic red tape which prevented two of the for
eign scholars nominated from entering this
country. He is still working to bring Yugoslav
student Petar Macanovic to Stanford next fall, j
To Margaret Stanley, who headed a small j
group or students who originated and planned
a new type of all-campus dance—the Beaux
Arts Ball. Taking the idea from "An American:
in Paris," they won the support of the Art De-.
partment and the official sanction of the ASSU,
designed a rcom-full of modernistic black and
white decorations, and stuck by their idea until
it turned into an overwhelming success.
To Harrison Schmidt, Bob van Pagenhardt,
Erland Higenboiham, and Tom Bartlett, four
overworked students of political science who
wrote a draft ASSU constitution now being con
sidered by Executive Committee. They inter
viewed scores of students, spent several weeks
drawing up the constitution, and then many j
more hours facing the queries and criticisms
of the Students studying it.
To Anne Powell, Election Board Chairman,
who proved that Stanford can have a smooth.. |
efficient election. Despite poor weather, two
day voting, and balloting during one evening,
Election Board and Axe Society sailed through I
without a hitch.
To Mike Zeiier and Gil Clapper, who have!
provided Stanford with the best run of Sunday
flicks within memory. They have succeeded in
gaining top films for Stanford without arous
ing the anger of local movie managers.
These are the students v/e name as truly out
standing for 1954.

it turned into an overwhelming success.
To Harrison Schmidt, Bob van Pagenhardt,
Erland Higenboiham, and Tom Bartlett, four
overworked students of political science who
wrote a draft ASSU constitution now being con
sidered by Executive Committee. They inter
viewed scores of students, spent several weeks
drawing up the constitution, and then many j
more hours facing the queries and criticisms
of the Students studying it.
To Anne Powell, Election Board Chairman,
who proved that Stanford can have a smooth.. |
efficient election. Despite poor weather, two
day voting, and balloting during one evening,
Election Board and Axe Society sailed through I
without a hitch.
To Mike Zeiier and Gil Clapper, who have!
provided Stanford with the best run of Sunday
flicks within memory. They have succeeded in
gaining top films for Stanford without arous
ing the anger of local movie managers.
These are the students v/e name as truly out
standing for 1954.

The new year has come, bringing with it
the customary good resolutions, optimistic
forecasts, and fresh opportunities. Among men
everywhere there is general agreement to for
get the mistakes of the past, general eagerness
to move ahead in 1955.
For a moment, however, we will focus our
attention to the year just finished. In particular
we would like io commend a handful of stu
dents who went "above and beyond" the pro
verbial "call of duty" to serve Stanford in
1954.
Graduate and undergraduate, active in di
verse fields, they held one interest in common.
Their contributions were designed to benefit the
entire student body.
To these persons go our sincere "thank you"
for helping to make 1954 an enjoyable and con
structive year at Stanford.
To Sieve Horn, Carl Stover and Robb Crist,
the three moderators of the Y Public Affairs
Luncheon group. Due to their continuous in
terest and challenging opinions, the Tuesday
lunch meeting has developed into one of the
most fascinating, provocative hours in the week.
To Liz Livadary for tackling the problem of
student-faculty relations and following through
with it until a special Student-Faculty Com
mittee was established. Hers was the first uni
fied, constructive program for increasing the
contact between students and professors to be
presented at Stanford in many years.
To Grant Spaeth I or an outstanding job as co
chairman of the Foreign Scholarship Commit
tee until graduation last June. He spent the

summer trying to unsnarl the legal and diplo
matic red tape which prevented two of the for
eign scholars nominated from entering this
country. He is still working to bring Yugoslav
student Petar Macanovic to Stanford next fall, j
To Margaret Stanley, who headed a small j
group or students who originated and planned
a new type of all-campus dance—the Beaux
Arts Ball. Taking the idea from "An American:
in Paris," they won the support of the Art De-.
partment and the official sanction of the ASSU,
designed a rcom-full of modernistic black and
white decorations, and stuck by their idea until
it turned into an overwhelming success.
