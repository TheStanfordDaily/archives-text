# Of Mutual Benefit
## 
### 
Negotiations which began in April of last
year were climaxed during Christmas vacation
with the announcement by the Veterans' Ad
ministration of their decision to build a S2O
million neuropsychiatry hospital on Stanford
property.
Nine months of discussion and presentation
of many pros and cons by all parties involved
in the building program have ended with the
announcement that construction of the huge in
stitution will get under way as soon as
''friendly" condemnation proceedings against
the University are carried out.
When VA officials first began considering
Stanford as a possible site for the hospital, the
Daily pointed out several advantages which
would result from locating here.
First, we outlined the economic advantages
which the hospital will, present. The five-year
building period for the institution alone will
create from 2,500 to 3,000 jobs for workers in the
various construction trades. In addition, the
hospital will have an estimated annual payroll
of more than S3 million, much of which will find

its way back into the local economy. Hundreds
of thousands of dollars will also be spent in this j
area for supplies for the hospital.
Even more important, the hospital will bring j
many medical and psychiatric experts to the
University, and will provide an unexcelled
source of study cases for the Stanford Medical
School when the Med School completes its
planned move to the campus.
The loudest objection to locating the hospital
here was presented by residents of the Page
Mill Road area, originally mentioned as the con-:
structibn site, and was primarily a fear of pos
sible escaped mental patients. That appre
hension, however, seems to have been solved
by a compromise which chanfted the building
location to the southeast corner of University
property â€”a site distant enough from campus
and residential areas to reduce any such danger.
We are glad that the Veterans' Administra
tion and University officials were able to climax
their negotiations with such a progressive de
cision. Great mutual benefits can be the only 1
result.
