## McCarthy Censure Criticized 
### 
(Editor's note: This letter was
received 011 the last day of pub
lication for fall quarter, too late
to lie published. Although the
McCarthy censure is now past his
tory, we are running the letter
since it presents a view not held
by any member of the Daily edi
torial board. With this, we hope,
the McCarthy censure case will
rest.)
To the Editor:
Since the final vote on the McCar
thy "censure" question has been
taken (and, perhaps, to anticipate
your editorials on the subject), I
feel that the pro-McCarthy position
should be stated.
Senator McCarthy was condemned
on two counts —that he refused to
co-operate with, and abused the
members of, the Gillette-Hennings
subcommittee; that he used intem
perate language in reference to the
Watkins committee and the Senate
as a whole, and that both such ac
tions were contrary to the dignity
and repute of the Senate.
With regard to part one of the
first count, it involves long argu
ments a.s to the legality of the Gil
lette-Hennings hearings (as counsel
and one member had already re
signed in protest over its "unfair"
practices) and as to just where and
when McCarthy was, when he was
"invited" to testify.
In part two of the first count and
in all of the second count, the of
fense charged to McCarthy is his
"intemperate" language. Now, Mc-
Carthy agreed that possibly his lan
guage may have been "extreme" and
apologized to those whose feelings
he hurt. Since he was "condemned"
anyway this leaves us with three
alternatives:
1. That his apology was not felt to
be made in good faith.
2. That since the apology was lim
ited to the words hie used, and not
the principles he held, he was con
demned for those principles.
3. That the anti - McCarthyites
were not in a position to be swayed
by the logic or reason in an apology.
Now let us consider these alterna
tives. If the first were true, the ma
jority were voting condemnation on,

I or passing judgment for, the good
j faith of a fellow Senator in apolo
! gizing to them. In other words, they
i were denying him the right to have
j his words (of apology to them) ac-
J cepted as sincere until proven other
wise.
II the second alternative were
' true, then a U.S. Senator has been
"condemned" for the principles he
j holds. It is an appalling thought, to
think of a body passing value judg
ments on not just the merits of one's
principles but "condemning" for
holding them — this seems true if
such principles are in the minority.
Both these alternatives are with
i out precedent in the history of the
I Senate—byjtradition of the Senate,
j Senators are assumed to be acting in
1 good faith—however extremist their
j views or remarks may be; by tradi
! tion of our democracy we are not
| "condemned" for merely holding
1 principles.
; Now let us consider the third al
! ternative. If this one be true, then
! the charges are not valid because the
I Senate would have no dignity. 11
logic or reason could not sway, then
the group had degenerated into a
mob—a mob is not considered wor
thy of dignity. Therefore, it would
j not follow that one could "abuse" a
| mob or be "condemned" for such ac
| tion.
These alternatives present a spec
! tacle too revolting to be true. Yet,
| I submit that, in view of McCarthy's
1 apology and his subsequent "con-
I demrwtion," one of these must be
j valid as an explanation for such

action. To the ''liberals" who cry
"smear," "thought control," and
"mob hysteria" at present-day secu
rity programs, 1 would ask them to
reflect carefully as to the "smear" of
one's remarks being taken in bad
faith until proven otherwise; the
"thought control" in being found
"guilty" for your principles (provid
ing again that such opinions are not
criminal or subversive); the "mob
hysteria" in a jury's refusal to ac
cept logic and reason.
