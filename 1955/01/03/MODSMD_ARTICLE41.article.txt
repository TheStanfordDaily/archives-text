# Vet Enrollment Here Increased

### 
Four hundred thirty-eight veter
ans of the Korean war were enrolled
last quarter at Stanford, an increase
of 127 over last year's total enroll
ment of veterans.
Walter J. Findeisen, National
Service Adviser at Stanford, ex
pressed surprise at the number.
Findeisen, who Is making a sta
tistical survey of enrollment figures
to plot trends in college attendance,
stated that he had expected "no
more than 300 due to the fact that
the Korean GI Bill provides a flat
allowance with no provision for tui
tion at private institutions."
"When tuition must come from the
veteran's pocket," he said, "he is
more likely to turn to a state uni
versity."
Findeisen said that his survey
shows that 337 veterans are in the
Graduate Division. Many of these
Korean veterans are former Stan
ford undergraduates who took RO
TC training and received armed i
forces commissions before going to
Korea and have now come back to
complete their education.
"Perhaps these veterans were able
to save funds to use in graduate
study," Findeisen concluded.
