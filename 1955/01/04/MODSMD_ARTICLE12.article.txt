## McCarthy Bows Out As Chairman 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3. (UP)—
3en. Joseph R. McCarthy ended
wo tumultuous years of investi
gations today with a "swar.
song" hearing that produced
contempt citations against three
alleged Communists.
Bowing out as chairman of the
<3enate Investigating Subcommittee,
;he Wisconsin Republican ques
ioned a catch-all mixture of alleged
Communists and ex-Communists in
defense plants.
/OTE CITATIONS
He closed what he said would be
the laFt public hearing under his
chairmanship a moment after the
übcommittee voted to iccommend
contempt citations against three wit
nesses who failed to show up for the
hearing.
Many of those who did appear re
fused to answer questions about
Communism. Some swore they were
not Communists at the moment byt
declined to say if they were party
members at 1 p.m., EST, shortly be
fore they were called to testify.
McCarthy's controversial tenure
as head of the investigating group
will close officially when the Demo
crats take control of Congress later
this week. Senator John L. McClel
lan (D., Ark.) is slated to succeed
him.
McCarthy told reporters that "I
step down with both relief and re
gret." He expressed hope that the
subcommittee under McClellan "will
proceed to dig out Communists as
vigorously as we have in the past."
"From his statements, he (Mc-
Clellan) apparently has that in
mind," #
STILL ACTIVE
The outgoing chairman said he
will continue to serve on the sub
committee "as actively as I can."
One in today's parade of witnesses,
Peter Lydon of Rankin, Pa., caught
McCarthy by surprise by admitting
he had been a Communist for two
or three years, until 1946. Lydoti
was jjismissed after he promised to
give all his information to the FBI.
"We weren't prepared for your
testimony," McCarthy said.
