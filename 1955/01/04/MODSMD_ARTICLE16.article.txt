This year marks the 54th since the
first eating club appeared on the
Stanford campus. In 1901, when the
University provided no dining halb:
for men, a group of male students
g&t together for the purpose of < n
panionship at meals and
themselves Los Arcos Eating Club.
Since then, the clubs have expand
ed until there are now seven of
them besides Los Arcos. The other
six include Breakers, El Campo, El
Capilan, El Cuadro, Ei Tigre, and
El Toro.
The colorful history of the clubs
is seen in such events as the forma
tion of the "Little Quad." Before
World War I, El Toro, Breakers, and
El Campo built little shacks housing
dining halls, lounges, and kitchen
facilities, and grouped them together
in what is now the Encina parking
lot.
However, the biggest moment in
the history of Stanford's eating
clubs came in 1951 with the dedica
tion of the present eating club
building. It was the completion of
a drama .which had started soon
after the Second World War.
The club building today include
complete dining and kitchen facili
ties for each of the seven clubs plus
a big lounge which is shared by all
the clubs.
The building, which is located on
Arguello Street next to Toyon Hall,
has a large, landscaped patio in front
and spacious athletic and service
space in the rear.
The 1955 clubman has his choice
of residence. He may either live in
a private apartment, at home, or he
may choose to live in adjacent Toy
on Hall.
