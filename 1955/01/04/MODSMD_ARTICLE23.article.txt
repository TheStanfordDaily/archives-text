# An Important Decision
## 
### 
When the eating clubs play host to the fresh
man men at the club building tonight to open
formal rushing for 1955, every man in the
freshman class will face an important decision.
Affiliation with a fraternity, or a club or a de
cision to remain independent may have a great
influence on his years in college and later in
life as well. To the freshman men, we suggest:
Take your time in making a choice. Among
the several fraternities and clubs at Stanford,
you will find many different attitudes and a
variety of personalities. Some groups will be
more suited to you than others, and you won't
be able to establish a really good comparison
until you have talked to men in several differ
ent groups and spent some time thinking about
what you have learned. v
after all, is an all-year activity, and
if you're offered a pledge pin, the offer usually
remains good for a matter of months and you
can take plenty of time deciding to accept or
reject the bid.

Decide what it is you really want in the way
of group affiliation. Is it the close group spirit,
organization, and activity of a fraternity? Is it
the more informal, yet still organized and
friendly, atmosphere of an eating club? Or is
it the complete personal freedom of decision of
the independent man? .
Consider items of expense; they'll vary from
club to club, from house to house, and between
the two. But don't be fooled by the seemingly
high fees at the fraternities, for instance. A lot
of advantages adhere to those fees, and they
cover a lot of things you might pay more for
as an independent.
And don't join "because Dad joined" or "be
cause my brother belongs." Choosing—or re
jecting —a house or club affiliation at Stanford
©r anywhere else is and must be entirely a
personal matter. It's your choice —you'll have
to live with it!—so make it slowly and make
it wisely.
