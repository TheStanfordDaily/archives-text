# It's Not So Bad

A note of reassurance to Stanford drivers:
that stoplight on Palm Drive isn't as threatening
to easy driving as it might look.
As a matter of fact, the light isn't operating
now, and, in all probability, won't start its tri
color flashing until the middle of July.
The side road, unofficially called the "Em
barcadero Cutoff," won't be used as a thorough
fare until the bridge over the San Franciscquito
Creek has been completed.
Construction on the bridge, which will bo
located at the intersection of Willow Road and
Sandhill Road, will probably begin in the mid
dle of March, after the rainy season is over.
When the light goes into effect, student ,
drivers' problems will be considered carefully,
and special provisions will be made for the
campus rush hoursof 8 a.m., 12 noon, and 5 p.m.
A traffic study is now underway to determine
just how heavy the traffic is at those times, and

the stoplight will be set for the maximum con
venience of campus drivers.
Many students have inquired why a stop
light was installed instead of a less annoying
underpass.
The answer is $395,000.
Installation of an underpass would cost the
University $400,000. The stoplight cost $5,000.
Also Stanford is as yet not certain about the
permanence of the side road. It is possible that
it may be just a temporary arrangement, in
which case the underpass would be an unjusti
fied expense.
So Stanford has a stoplight. At the moment,
it is completely inoffensive to the motorist.
But even when it goes into operation, it
shouldn't take long before it is digested and ac
cepted by the student body.
After all, not so long ago, everyone didn't see
how University traffic could circulate with En
gineering Corner roped off.
