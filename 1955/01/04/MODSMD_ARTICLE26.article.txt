# Sponsor System, Attitude of Coeds Impress Roble Hall's New Director
## 
### LINDA ALLEN 
Student responsibility in
school activities has greatly im
pressed Miss Margaret Trainor,
new Director of Roble. "I just
can't say too much for the out
standing sponsor system here at
Roble," she added. "Nowhere
before have I seen such an ex
cellent system."
One ol Miss Trainor's most impor
tant duties as Director of Roble is
working with the senior and junior
sponsors and helping them plan cor
ridor and hall activities. She is also
a member of the staff of the Dean
of Students.
Miss Trainor came to Stanford
from Arkansas State College in
Jonesboro where she had served as
Dean of Women for the last live
years. She said that the social regu
lations at Arkansas State College
were generally stricter than those at
Stanford lor two reasons: first, tftat
school is located in a largely rural
area, and second, culture in the
Southern states is generally more
.strict.
One of the most outstanding dif
ferences in the attitudes of the
women students in the two schools,
according to Miss Trainor, is the
number of those who drop out in
their freshman and sophomore years
for marriage. At Arkansas State
College, as i.s true of most Southern
colleges, considerably over half of
the women students drop out during
theii fust two years to get married.
'The thing that impressed me
most about the Stanford women,"
she commented, "is that most come
with definite plans to finish the four
year program." Another reason for
tlie large number of girls who leave
college after their sophomore year in
Arkansas is that in the state of Ar
kansas one needs only two years of
college to teach.
While serving as Dean at Arkansas
State College, she organized an AWS
and last spring it was admitted to
the Intercollegiate Association of

Women Students. In order for a
group to he admitted, it must have
aimed toward becoming a mem her
for at least a year.
Arkansas State College has a stu
dent hotly of about 1,000 !'OU wom
en and 700 men — most of whom
come from northern Arkansas and
southern Missouri.
Miss Trainor received her B.S.
degree and Master's degree in per
sonnel at the University of Colorado.

j While an undergraduate of (he Uni-
I versity of Colorado, she worked in
i the office of the Dean of Students.
Last year, Miss Trainor served as
president of the Arkansas Associa
tion of Women Deans and Counsel
ors, a group which includes the
deans of all the Arkansas colleges
and high school counselors.
"I art) very enthusiastic about ev
erything here at Stanford, especially
Roble Hall," she commented.

MISS MARGARET TRAINOR
—New Roble director
Student responsibility in
school activities has greatly im
pressed Miss Margaret Trainor,
new Director of Roble. "I just
can't say too much for the out
standing sponsor system here at
Roble," she added. "Nowhere
before have I seen such an ex
cellent system."
One ol Miss Trainor's most impor
tant duties as Director of Roble is
working with the senior and junior
sponsors and helping them plan cor
ridor and hall activities. She is also
a member of the staff of the Dean
of Students.
Miss Trainor came to Stanford
from Arkansas State College in
Jonesboro where she had served as
Dean of Women for the last live
years. She said that the social regu
lations at Arkansas State College
were generally stricter than those at
Stanford lor two reasons: first, tftat
school is located in a largely rural
area, and second, culture in the
Southern states is generally more
.strict.
One of the most outstanding dif
ferences in the attitudes of the
women students in the two schools,
according to Miss Trainor, is the
number of those who drop out in
their freshman and sophomore years
for marriage. At Arkansas State
College, as i.s true of most Southern
colleges, considerably over half of
the women students drop out during
theii fust two years to get married.
'The thing that impressed me
most about the Stanford women,"
she commented, "is that most come
with definite plans to finish the four
year program." Another reason for
tlie large number of girls who leave
college after their sophomore year in
Arkansas is that in the state of Ar
kansas one needs only two years of
college to teach.
While serving as Dean at Arkansas
State College, she organized an AWS
and last spring it was admitted to
the Intercollegiate Association of

Women Students. In order for a
group to he admitted, it must have
aimed toward becoming a mem her
for at least a year.
