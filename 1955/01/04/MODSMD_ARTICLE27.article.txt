# BASIC PERSONALITY:
## Study Data Discussed By Terman 
### 
Basic personality differences
may be responsible for much of
the trouble between scientists
and government officials, in the
opinion of Stanford Professor
emeritus Lewis M. Terman,
famed for his life-long studies of
gifted children.
Dr. Terman has explored the
problem scientifically in new investi
gations financed by the Office of Nav
al Research. He discusses his find
ings in an article, "Are Scientists
Different?" published in the Janu
ary issue of Scientific American
magazine.
The work consisted of re-evaluat
ing, in terms of differences between
scientists and non-scientists, the 800
gifted men whose careers he has
carefully traced for more than 30
years. Together with 600 women,
they were selected in 1921 from the
top one percent of school children
as measured by general intelligence
tests.
"In our gifted group the physical
scientists and engineers are at the
opposite pole from the businessmen
and lawyers in abilities, in occupa
tional interests, and in social behav
ior," says the Stanford psychologist.
"These basic personality differ
ences may well account for much of
the current friction between scien
tists and the government officials
who are responsible for their se
curity clearances and for the restric
tions imposed upon them.
"For it is the physical scientists,
engineers, and biologists who do most
of the Federal Governments secret
research, and do it under rules that
are laid down by a Congress com
posed mainly of lawyers and busi
nessmen."
"The analysis leaves no doubt,"
says Dr. Terman, "that non-scien
tists tend to score higher than scien
tists in social relations.
"The lawyers and social science
majors (mostly businessmen) usually
rated highest; the physical science
researchers, engineers, and science
majors generally rated lowest; and
the medical-biological group and
humanities majors (mainly teachers
and businessmen) were in between.
The groups showed a consistency of
scores which is remarkable when one
considers the wide range of attri
butes."
There were two purposes for un
dertaking his latest study, Dr. Ter
man explained. One was to try to
learn how to detect specific scien
tific talents, a technique that would
be highly useful in view of the pres
ent shortage of scientists, especially
in the physical sciences and engin
eering.
The other purpose was to reach a
better understanding of the differ
ences between scientists and non
scientists. This knowledge might
help to allay the tension building up
between scientists and important
ol thp general public.
