# That Wasn't Scrap Metal, Mr. Junkman
## 
### 
A Los Altos junkman is cur
rently being held in the San
Francisco County, Jail on the
charge of stealing 100 tons of
I lead from a storage yard on the
! Stanford Campus.
The amazing story of the theft was
revealed the middle of December
when the FBI arrested Walter How
ard Thomas, 45, who has a junk yard
at 520 San Antonio Road in Los
Altos.
Thomas was arrested -by the FBI
rather than the local authorities,
since the missing 200,000 pounds of
lead, valued in excess of $40,000, w;us
the property of the United States
Navy. The metal was loaned to Stan
ford for use in the University's high
energy physics laboratory. It is em
ployed .is shielding against dangerous !
radiation set up by experiments in !
the laboratory.
All told, the Navy loaned Stanford
200 tons of the metal. It was stored
behind the microwave laboratories in j
a tightly fenced yard.
Scientists at the lab first noticed j
1 the metal missing last October when
the amount of lead in the yard did
not tally with their inventory sheets,
j but they were perplexed as to how
it could have disappeared;
Later investigation showed that it
was done by someone who dug a
tunnel under the fence at night, and
carried the lead out a few blocks at
a time. The intruder would care
fully fill the hole under the fence
each time after he used it and then
filled up the tunnel with large rocks
each time he departed.
The FBI became suspicious of
Thomas soon after the metal began
; to disappear, and a month before his
| arrest raided his junk yard, but
! found no lead. They did however
j discover a device for melting the j
| metal and casting it into five pound |
j blocks.
At the time of his arrest Dec. 15,
j the FBI found 400 pounds of lead
| buried on Thomas's property.
I Thomas has denied any knowledge
j of taking the metal from the campus
| and produced $5,000 in cash for bail
| when he was first arrested. ,
He was arrested a second time
Dec. 22 and his bail was set at $15,000 j
i which he failed to meet. The gov- j
I eminent also filed a civil suit against
j Thomas asking $33,000 and costs for 1
the bulky haul he is alleged to have •
made. His hearing before United j
States Commissioner Joseph Karesh j
is being continued in San Francisco.

carried the lead out a few blocks at
a time. The intruder would care
fully fill the hole under the fence
each time after he used it and then
filled up the tunnel with large rocks
each time he departed.
The FBI became suspicious of
Thomas soon after the metal began
; to disappear, and a month before his
| arrest raided his junk yard, but
! found no lead. They did however
j discover a device for melting the j
| metal and casting it into five pound |
j blocks.
At the time of his arrest Dec. 15,
j the FBI found 400 pounds of lead
| buried on Thomas's property.
I Thomas has denied any knowledge
j of taking the metal from the campus
| and produced $5,000 in cash for bail
| when he was first arrested. ,
He was arrested a second time
Dec. 22 and his bail was set at $15,000 j
i which he failed to meet. The gov- j
I eminent also filed a civil suit against
j Thomas asking $33,000 and costs for 1
the bulky haul he is alleged to have •
made. His hearing before United j
States Commissioner Joseph Karesh j
is being continued in San Francisco.
A Los Altos junkman is cur
rently being held in the San
Francisco County, Jail on the
charge of stealing 100 tons of
I lead from a storage yard on the
! Stanford Campus.
The amazing story of the theft was
revealed the middle of December
when the FBI arrested Walter How
ard Thomas, 45, who has a junk yard
at 520 San Antonio Road in Los
Altos.
Thomas was arrested -by the FBI
rather than the local authorities,
since the missing 200,000 pounds of
lead, valued in excess of $40,000, w;us
the property of the United States
Navy. The metal was loaned to Stan
ford for use in the University's high
energy physics laboratory. It is em
ployed .is shielding against dangerous !
radiation set up by experiments in !
the laboratory.
All told, the Navy loaned Stanford
200 tons of the metal. It was stored
behind the microwave laboratories in j
a tightly fenced yard.
Scientists at the lab first noticed j
1 the metal missing last October when
the amount of lead in the yard did
not tally with their inventory sheets,
j but they were perplexed as to how
it could have disappeared;
Later investigation showed that it
was done by someone who dug a
tunnel under the fence at night, and
carried the lead out a few blocks at
a time. The intruder would care
fully fill the hole under the fence
each time after he used it and then
filled up the tunnel with large rocks
each time he departed.
