# Coach Dallmar Has High Hopes This Season for His 'Big Three'
## 
### 


TOUGH TRlOâ€”Stanford Coach Howie Dallmar is counting on outstanding performances this
season from his top three players, big Russ Lawler (14) and little men Ron Tomsic (4) and George
Selleck (34). On the recent trip the team made, Dallmar was pleased with the efforts of all three.
He said no center outplayed Lawler, and he didn't see a pair of guards anywhere that could come
close to matching Tomsic and Selleck. Tomsic sat out last season with a knee injury, and is wear
ing a special brace this season. He and Lawler are seniors. Centerman Russ stands 6-6 Vi, and can
reach high enough to put the ball easily through the hoop. The Cards open their league play
this weekend against UCLA.
