# Indian Mentor Optimistic Following Big Road Trip
## 
### 
Coach Howie Dallmar was quite
pleased with his Stanford basket
ballers on their vacation Eastern
trip. The Indians won three of their
five games, which, was about what
the mentor had hoped for.
"I was particularly happy with the
showing of two players — Barry
Brown and Hap Wagner. Brown just
barely made the starting team at the
beginning of the year, but now
there's no doubt he's our fifth start
er. He's aggiessive on the boards,
and did an excellent job helping
Russ Lawler there."
Wagner, although a reserve, also
drew praise from the coach. "Hap
did a good job playing with our sec
ond-stringers, and will see an in
ereased amount of action in the
games to come."
Forward Bill Bond disappointed
Dallmar slightly on the trip. "Bill is
ju.st a sophomore, and this was his
first road trip. He was etxremely
nerv&us, but I think the trip did
him a lot of good. He'll be a far
better player from here on in."
As was to be expected, the "Big
Three" of the Cards—center Lawler

and guards Ron Tomsic and George
Selleck—lived up to expectations.
BIG THREE
"Lawler did a# excellent job for
us," the coach commented. "He was
the team's leading scorer on the
trip—9o points in five games. And
he was a great asset to us on the
boards. In none of the contests we
played was he outplayed by the op
posing center."
Tomsic and Selleck scored 87 and
43 points respectively. "'They were
constantly facing men far bigger
than they, but I didn't see any pair
of guards that could even approach
their caliber."
If these players Pooked so good,
why didn't the Cards fare better on
the trip? There were a number of
reasons, Dallmar said.
"We won our first game at Tucson
over Arizona. Tomsic scored 22
points to lead us to a 66-56 win.
But our next contest, in New Or
leans against Tulane, saw us lose dur
first game of the season, 67-62.
"We had a 34-30 half-time lead,
but their shooting — particularly on
free throws—was sensational. They
hit 23 for 27 on charity tosses. The
new shooting rule greatly helped
them there, and we just couldn't
keep up with them. But the team
afterward felt they might have won
the game, and we don't consider
ourselves the inferior team neces
sarily."
THIRD GAME BEST
The third game of the Cards was
their best. They toppled Seton Hall
from the unbeaten ranks, 65-63, at
South Orange, New Jersey. "That
was our best-played game of the
season. They are going to be a real
ly good team when they get organ
ized, and they might well have de
feated us.
"At one time, we had a 13-point
lead, but in the second half they
cut it to five. We tried to stall with
two minutes to play and leading,
60-55. They played a fine floor
game, and we couldn't hold them.

With 13 seconds to play, it was all
tied up, 63-63.
"This is when Lawler really came
through. Just before the buzzer
sounded, he sank a long shot to give
us the win. It was a sweet victory
for us."
The Indians continued their win
ning ways by toppling also unde
feated Vanderbilt, 72-64. But then
came trouble. "We never should
have left Nashville," Dallmar ex
claimed.
TIRED CAGERS
"We were really tired to start
with. Then we had to sit for four
hours at the airport waiting for the
plane to leave. We arrived at 6:30
the evening of the game. They de
layed the starting time to give us
an opportunity to warm up a few
minutes. But it didn't do any good—
we were thoroughly trounced, 73-
46.
"We'd like very much to play lowa
again, when we aren't so tired," the
coach said. "'We scored 20 points
in the first half, and trailed, 30-20.
But in the second half we were so
exhausted they had complete game
control." ,
The coach then turned to this
week's series—the season's openers
against mighty UCLA at the Pavil
ion. "I've seen the Bruins twice—
once at the Cow Palace and once at
Madison Square Garden. They did
n't have a good night in San Fran
cisco, hut in New York they really
looked impressive in knocking ofl
Niagara.
"They have height, speed, and
depth on us. We can't expect to out
run or outjump them. We'll have to
play a ball-control game, and make
every shot count."
Dallmar announced that the same
lineup will start for him this week
end as before—Bond, Brown, Law
-1 Selleck. and Tomsic.
