WRITERS' CRAMP—The students pictured pictured here, seated on the steps and leaning against
the walls outside Memorial Auditorium, are but a few of the 6,333 who turned in their reg books

registration committee predicted. With successful utilization of IBM machines, the number of
cards in the reg books may be reduced to seven. —Daily photo by Ken Green
