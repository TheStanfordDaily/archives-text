# U.S. Tightens Travel Rules For Russians
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (UP)â€”
The United States today imposed
tight new travel restrictions on
Soviet diplomats and other Rus
sian citizens for reasons of "reci
procity and security."
The move makes Russians in this
country subject to virtuaJly the
i same rules that apply to Americans
; working or visiting in the Soviet
j Union.
The order closes to Russian trav
elers most U.S. border areas and
other key points, including 895
counties in 39 states and 16 cities
| in otherwise open areas.
AN EXTENSION
The restrictions are an extension
of regulations issued in 1952 which
limited official Soviet representa
tives to 25-mile trips from the cen
ters of Washington and New York
j City except with previous notifica
! tion. The Russians were permitted
' under the original rules to travel
: beyond those points on 48 hours'
| written notification.
This is the first time that the U.S.
government has set up out-of
bounds areas and closed cities for
: Russians.
The State Department said it had
i hoped relatively free movement by
I Russians here would encourage the
I Kremlin to relax its travel rcstric-
I tions.
