WASHINGTON. Jan. 4 (UP)—Democratic Congressional leaders urged party members today—
on the eve of the 84th Congress—to remember recent GOP "traitor" charges but not to oppose
President Eisenhower "just for the sake of opposition."
With the new House and Senate set to open at noon tomorrow, there were signs Democratic lead
ers may give top priority to an investigation of the Administration's security program. They claim

it is being used for political propa
ganda.
House Democratic sources said
Representatives Sam Ray burn (D.,
Tex.) and John W. McCormack (D.,
Mass.) told their colleagues at a
party caucus that they must never
"forgive or forget" Vice-President
Richard M. Nixon for allegedly im
pugning tlx.' loyalty of Democrats
during the election campaign.
The two leaders, it was said, also
told fellow Democrats they must
neither "forgive or forget" Mr. Ei
senhower fqr commending Nixon for
having played a valuable role in the
OOP's losing campaign efforts,
NO REPRISALS'
Informants said no mention was
made of possible "reprisals." But
they said the Democrats were ex
pected to launch an investigation
aimed at proving that the adminis
tration's claim of having fired more
than 8,000 security risks was noth
ing but a "numbers gam 6." Nixon
made the security figures a cam
paign issue.
Meanwhile, Senate Democratic
Leader Lyndon B. Johnson said after
a caucus of Senate Democrats that
the party is "not going to oppose
(the administration) just for the
sake of opposition." He said Demo
dents to purchase rooters' tickets
when they think he is right.
Back in control after a two-year
lapse, Democrats nominated Ray
burn as House speaker and named
McCormack as House floor leader.
Senate Democrats named Johnson
party leader and chose Senator Wal
ter F. George (D., Ga.), dean of the
Senate, as Senate president pro tern.
KNOWLAND LEADS GOP
On the Republican side, Senator
William F. Knowland (Calif.) was
named party leader in the Senate.
Representative Joseph W. Martin,
Jr., (Mass.) was selected to direct
GOP strategy in the House.
The various party leaders will take
over formally at a brief mid-day
session tomorrow.
Congress then will adjourn until
Thursday noon when the House and
Senate will meet in joint session to
hear Mr. Eisenhower outline his leg
islative goals in his State of the
Union message. Indications were
the President might get a goodly
share of his goals.
But all was not sweetness and
light. In GOP ranks, Senator Clif
ford P. Case (R., N.J.) was threat
ening to try to block committee
posts for Senator Joseph R. McCar
thy (R., Wis.), condemned by his
colleagues in the last session.
