WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (UP)-The
U.S. Foreign Aid Agency has de
cided to hire Wolf Ladejinsky, Rus
sian-born land reform expert who
was ousted as U.S. agricultural at
tache in Tokyo as a security risk, it
was learned today.
Informed sources said Harold E.
Stassens Foreign Operations Admin
istration is satisfied with Ladejin
sky's security status. He is expected
to go to work for the agency almost
immediately at the critical task of
supervising land reform in Indo
china.
The FOA is expected to make an
announcement of the appointment
tomorrow.
Word of the appointment came
shortly after it was disclosed that
the row over Ladejinsky's security
status had reached the White House.
Simultaneously Agriculture Sec
retary Ezra T. Benson was quoted as
telling Jewish leaders that anti-Se
mitism was "abhorrent" to him and
played no part in Ladejinsky's re
moval from his Tokyo post.
Informed sources said Ladejinsky
will stSrt work in the FOA Far
Eastern Division here, familiarizing
himself with its operations and the
land problem in southern Viet Nam
â€”the part of the Indochina state left
under French control by the Indo
china armistice.
This government is reported an
xious to put across land reform
measures in the area to combat
Communist influence before the 1956
elections scheduled for all Viet Nam.
Those elections may determine
whether the entire Indochinc.se state
goes Communist.
The chief land reform job is said
to be splitting lip large landholdings
among the peasants. Ladejinsky won
acclaim for his postwar land reform
work in Japan under General Doug
las Mac Arthur.
It is customary to clear a U.S. em
ployee working abroad with the gov
ernment, involved. This presumably
will be he handled while Ladejinsky
is working in FOA headquarters
here.
