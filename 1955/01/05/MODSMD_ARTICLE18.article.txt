# The 						84th Congress
## 
### 
The 84th Congress of the United States will
embark upon two years of lawmaking and fili
bustering, flamboyant oratory and cloak-room
bargaining when the Senate and House con
vene at noon (EST) today.
Masked behind the opening session smiles
and friendly greetings is a split in the Republi
can party and potential fireworks from the Dem
ocratic ranks thaf could spell disaster for na
tional stability and international security.
Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson has
promised Democratic support of the Eisen
hower program—up to a point. They will back
the President on his request for a three-year ex
tension of the Reciprocal Trade Agreement
Act, which was chopped down to one year by
the Republican 83rd Congress.
Plans to increase economic aid abroad and to
strengthen existing military and political al
liances will also receive approval from the
Democrats.
But on domestic policies the President may
buck strong opposition. The Democrats have
demanded a full explanation and breakdown in
the figures of "security risks" who have left gov
ernment payrolls during the Eisenhower ad
ministration.

Democrats are sure to scrutinize the recent |
proposal to reduce the armed forces except the !
Air Force and may possibly fight lowered draft
calls and expenditures. Two other programs to j
which the Democrats are committed rigid farm
supports and increased personal income tax ex
emption may be deferred until next year.
On the other side of the aisle, President Eisen
hower can hope for only half-hearted support.
His chief lieutenant in the Senate, William
Knowland, has disagreed publicly and loudly
with the administration's stand on Indochina,
Red China, and the role of the United States in
the United Nations. Republican ranks have
been further split over the censure of Senator i
McCarthy. %
This, then, is the somewhat shaky composi- j
tion of the 84th Congress. In its hands the 1
American people have entrusted their hopes
and aspirations for the next two crucial years.
On its record the presidential campaign in 1956
may be decided.
Perhaps, if the 84th Congress includes more j
statesmen than politicians, it may go down in
history as the Congress which guided men to
the most elusive goal of all world peace.
