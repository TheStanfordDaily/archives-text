### RIC TEAGUE 
On 7 December 1954 I received a missive from
Headquarters, Army, thai, stated in effect that
! was reld fr asg my then present dy sta and WP O/A
that date to my new dy .sta at PSF Calif with no
I >DALV, TP A auth, no cli EDCSA.
This may seem confusing to some. Me too. How
ever, whipping cmt my evei' ready copy of a manual
ol authorized abbreviations, I .soon perceived that I
was to report, to the Presidio of San Francisco and was
relieved from my duty station. 1 was not to have any
de lay en route but was to he allowed to transport my
:> If by private automobile.
My arrival at the Presidio was met with mixed
(motions. My brass was polished, my stripes were
sewed on neatly (for me), and shoes fairly glistened.
However, on entering the orderly room of my new
organization, I neglected to remove my cap. This at
tracted the notice of the exec who, in his displeasure,
had me prilling charge of quarters during the lunch
hour.
Well, I weathered the storm. And on 16 December
1954, Special Orders 249, Headquarters Sixth Army,
I was mentioned as being released from Active Duty
with the Army. Now it is not too easy to get out of
the Army these days. First, you have to turn in your
held jacket. Mine was brand new. I wanted it and
o I was forced to scrounge an older model to turn in.
Since it was winter, they let me keep my overcoat.
A very benevolent officer gave me quite a bit of money

and another nice gentleman gave me a DD Form 214,
known in tlie trade as a Report of Separation, ft
wasn't until I wa ; on the train that I noticed that my
last name was misspelled. But I was out. No more
slaving for five dollars a day. No more standing in
lines. No more regimentation.
Monday was reg day. I stood in lines, 112 reported to
the Old Returning Students window at 0800. People
kept telling me that before 1 do this I had to do that.
1 stood in more lines. I have never stood in chow
lines as Ion" as die line I hid to stand iri just to give
the cashier some money. At 1725 1 was through. And
1 mean finished.
But one .step remains. Public Law 550 will give me
$110 every month I am in school. II I can get it.
That's where the DD Form 214 comes in. To get. the
or Bill, that form ha:: to be correct. Mine isn't* To
correct it you have to get a copy of DD Form 215 from
the Adjutant Oeneral in Washington. There are other
papers to be accomplished. Expeditiously, as it says
in the regulation::. A gentleman of my acquaintance
tells me it only took him three months to straighten
out such an error. By then I'll starve.
The other flay I noted a poster. "Stop! Think! Re
cti list' Another wait in a line and I might weaken.
