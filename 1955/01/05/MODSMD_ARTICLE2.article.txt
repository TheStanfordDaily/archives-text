# Approval Near On Gas Tax
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 1 (UP)â€” Re
tention of California's six-cents-a
gallon gasoline tax for at least an
other year was virtually assured to
night.
Bills to continue the six-cent rate
were introduced in both the Senate
and Assembly. The Senate bill by
Sen. Randolph Collier (R., Yreka)
had ."38 other signers, 12 more than
needed to pass the legislation.
The Assembly bill by Assembly
man Donald Doyle (R., Lafayette)
bore 48 other signatures, only five
less than needed for passage. Doyle
said he was "positive" he had
enough votes to pass the bill.
The bills were a speedy answer to
Governor Goodwin J. Knight's plea
to continue the current rate rather
than allow it to drop back to five
and one-half cents June 30 as it
would under present law. Knight
had warned that unless 'the higher
lavy was continued it would be
necessary to lop $25,000,000 worth of
highway projects off the 1955-56
highway program.
The first regular day of the 1955
.session produced 71 Senate meas
ures and 106 Assembly bills, slightly
under the total at the same stage of
the 1953 general session. About 6,000
bills arc expected to be introduced
before the legislators adjourn for
the recess period late this month.
