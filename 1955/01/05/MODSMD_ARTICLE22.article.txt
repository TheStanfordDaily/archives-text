CLOTHES MAKE THE BMOC
A few weeks ago I discussed fashions for coeds. J pointed out then
that any girl who really wanted to go places on campus had to be
bold and ingenious when it came to clothes. This is no less true
for the male student.
Believe me, men, you'll never get anywhere if you keep skulking
around in those old plus-fours. What you need is some dash, some
verve, some inventiveness in your apparel. Don't be imprisoned by
the traditional conservatism of men's clothing. Brighten up your
appearance with a single earring, or a cavalry sabre, or a gold derby.
However, guard against gaudiness. If, for instance, you are wear
ing a gold derby, do riot also wear a cavalry sabre. This is too much.
Wear a dagger instead, or, for informal occasions, a Bowie knife.
(Speaking of Bowie knives, I wonder how many of you know
what a great debt this country — indeed, the whole world —owes
to the West Point class of 183G? You all know, of course, that, Colonel
.lames Bowie of the Class of 1836 invented the Bowie knife, but do
you know of the many other important contributions to cutlery
that were made by classmates of Colonel Bowie's? Are you aware,
for example, that Colonel Harry Clasp invented the Clasp knife?
Or that Colonel Harry Jack invented the Jack knife? Or that Colonel
Harry Putty invented the Putty knife? Or that Colonel Harry
Cannon invented the towel?
By a curious coincidence, every member of the graduating class
at the IJ. S. Military Academy in 18.'5 ft was named Harry, save for
Colonel James Bowie. This coincidence is believed unique in the
history of American education, though, of course, quite common
in Europe.)
But I digress. We were talking about men's campus fashions. Let
us turn now to a persistent rumor that a garment called I lie "suit"
is on the verge of making a comeback. Some of you older students
may remember the "suit." It was an ensemble consisting of a jacket
ami trousers, both of which — this'll kill you — both of which were
made out of the same, material!
The last "suit" ever seen on an American campus was in 1941 —
and 1 ought to know, because J was wearing it. Ah, 1941 ! Well do I
remember that melancholy year. I was an undergraduate then and
in love—hopelessly in love, caught in the riptide of a reckless romance
with a beauteous statistics major named Harry Sigafoos. (She is one
of the two girls 1 have ever known named Harry. The other one
is her sister.)
1 loved Harry though she was far too expensive a girl for me.
She liked to eat at fancy restaurants and dance at costly ballrooms
and ride in high priced cars. But worst of all, she was mad for
wishing wells. It was not unusual for her to drop coins into a
wishing well for two or three hours on end. My coins.
Bit by bit I sold off my belongings to pursue this insane courtship —
first my books, then my clothes, until finally J was left with nothing
to wear but a "suit." One night 1 came calling for her in this garment.
"What is that?" she gasped, her lip curling in horror.
"That is a 'suit' " I mumbled, averting my eyes.
"Well, I can't be seen around campus with you in that," said she.
"Please, Harry," 1 begged, "it's all I've got."
"I'm sorry," she said firmly and slammed the door.
1 slunk home and lit a Philip Morris and sat flown to think. I always
light a Philip Morris when I sit down to think, for their mild
vintage tobacco is a great aid to cerebration. 1 always light
Philip Morrises when I dov't sit down to think too, because
Philip Morris is my favorite cigarette, and I know it will he yours
too once you try that crazy vintage tobacco.
Well sir, smoking and thinking thus, my eye happened to fall on
an ad in the campus newspaper. "WIN A COMPLETE WARD
ROBE" said the ad. "Touhy's Toggery, the campus's leading men's
store, announces a contest to pick the best dressed man on campus.
The winner of the contest will receive, absolutely free, a blue hound's
tooth jacket, a yellow button-down shirt, a black knit tie, a tattersall
vest, gray flannel trousers, argyle socks, and white buck shoos with
two inch crepe soles."
My mouth watered at the thought of such a splendid wardrobe,
but how could anybody possibly pick me as the best dressed man on
campus —me in my "suit"? Suddenly an inspiration struck me. I
seized pen in hand and wrote a letter to the editor of the campus
newspaper:
"Dear Sir, I see by the paper that Touhy's Toggery is going to
give a complete wardrobe to the student picked as the best dressed
man on campus. What a ridiculous idea!
"Obviously, to be the best dressed man on campus, you must first
have a lot of clothes. And if you have a lot. of clothes, what do you
need with another wardrobe?
"Touhy's Toggery should give a new wardrobe to the worn! dressed
man on campus. Me, for instance. I am an eyesore. There isn't a crow
in town that will come near me. Three times this month the Salvation
Army salvage truck has picked me up. Esquire lias cancelled my
subscription.
"1 svmmit that a vote for me is a vote for reason, a vote for equity,
in short, a vote for the American way."
With a flourish, 1 signed the letter and sent it off. somehow feeling
certain that very soon I would be wearing a complete new wardrobe.
And I was right - because two weeks later I was drafted.

first my books, then my clothes, until finally J was left with nothing
to wear but a "suit." One night 1 came calling for her in this garment.
"What is that?" she gasped, her lip curling in horror.
"That is a 'suit' " I mumbled, averting my eyes.
"Well, I can't be seen around campus with you in that," said she.
"Please, Harry," 1 begged, "it's all I've got."
"I'm sorry," she said firmly and slammed the door.
1 slunk home and lit a Philip Morris and sat flown to think. I always
light a Philip Morris when I sit down to think, for their mild
vintage tobacco is a great aid to cerebration. 1 always light
Philip Morrises when I dov't sit down to think too, because
Philip Morris is my favorite cigarette, and I know it will he yours
too once you try that crazy vintage tobacco.
Well sir, smoking and thinking thus, my eye happened to fall on
an ad in the campus newspaper. "WIN A COMPLETE WARD
ROBE" said the ad. "Touhy's Toggery, the campus's leading men's
store, announces a contest to pick the best dressed man on campus.
The winner of the contest will receive, absolutely free, a blue hound's
tooth jacket, a yellow button-down shirt, a black knit tie, a tattersall
vest, gray flannel trousers, argyle socks, and white buck shoos with
two inch crepe soles."
My mouth watered at the thought of such a splendid wardrobe,
but how could anybody possibly pick me as the best dressed man on
campus —me in my "suit"? Suddenly an inspiration struck me. I
seized pen in hand and wrote a letter to the editor of the campus
newspaper:
"Dear Sir, I see by the paper that Touhy's Toggery is going to
give a complete wardrobe to the student picked as the best dressed
man on campus. What a ridiculous idea!
"Obviously, to be the best dressed man on campus, you must first
have a lot of clothes. And if you have a lot. of clothes, what do you
need with another wardrobe?
"Touhy's Toggery should give a new wardrobe to the worn! dressed
man on campus. Me, for instance. I am an eyesore. There isn't a crow
in town that will come near me. Three times this month the Salvation
Army salvage truck has picked me up. Esquire lias cancelled my
subscription.
"1 svmmit that a vote for me is a vote for reason, a vote for equity,
in short, a vote for the American way."
With a flourish, 1 signed the letter and sent it off. somehow feeling
certain that very soon I would be wearing a complete new wardrobe.
And I was right - because two weeks later I was drafted.

CLOTHES MAKE THE BMOC
A few weeks ago I discussed fashions for coeds. J pointed out then
that any girl who really wanted to go places on campus had to be
bold and ingenious when it came to clothes. This is no less true
for the male student.
Believe me, men, you'll never get anywhere if you keep skulking
around in those old plus-fours. What you need is some dash, some
verve, some inventiveness in your apparel. Don't be imprisoned by
the traditional conservatism of men's clothing. Brighten up your
appearance with a single earring, or a cavalry sabre, or a gold derby.
However, guard against gaudiness. If, for instance, you are wear
ing a gold derby, do riot also wear a cavalry sabre. This is too much.
Wear a dagger instead, or, for informal occasions, a Bowie knife.
(Speaking of Bowie knives, I wonder how many of you know
what a great debt this country — indeed, the whole world —owes
to the West Point class of 183G? You all know, of course, that, Colonel
.lames Bowie of the Class of 1836 invented the Bowie knife, but do
you know of the many other important contributions to cutlery
that were made by classmates of Colonel Bowie's? Are you aware,
for example, that Colonel Harry Clasp invented the Clasp knife?
Or that Colonel Harry Jack invented the Jack knife? Or that Colonel
Harry Putty invented the Putty knife? Or that Colonel Harry
Cannon invented the towel?
By a curious coincidence, every member of the graduating class
at the IJ. S. Military Academy in 18.'5 ft was named Harry, save for
Colonel James Bowie. This coincidence is believed unique in the
history of American education, though, of course, quite common
in Europe.)
But I digress. We were talking about men's campus fashions. Let
us turn now to a persistent rumor that a garment called I lie "suit"
is on the verge of making a comeback. Some of you older students
may remember the "suit." It was an ensemble consisting of a jacket
ami trousers, both of which — this'll kill you — both of which were
made out of the same, material!
The last "suit" ever seen on an American campus was in 1941 —
and 1 ought to know, because J was wearing it. Ah, 1941 ! Well do I
remember that melancholy year. I was an undergraduate then and
in love—hopelessly in love, caught in the riptide of a reckless romance
with a beauteous statistics major named Harry Sigafoos. (She is one
of the two girls 1 have ever known named Harry. The other one
is her sister.)
1 loved Harry though she was far too expensive a girl for me.
She liked to eat at fancy restaurants and dance at costly ballrooms
and ride in high priced cars. But worst of all, she was mad for
wishing wells. It was not unusual for her to drop coins into a
wishing well for two or three hours on end. My coins.

that any girl who really wanted to go places on campus had to be
bold and ingenious when it came to clothes. This is no less true
for the male student.
Believe me, men, you'll never get anywhere if you keep skulking
around in those old plus-fours. What you need is some dash, some
verve, some inventiveness in your apparel. Don't be imprisoned by
the traditional conservatism of men's clothing. Brighten up your
appearance with a single earring, or a cavalry sabre, or a gold derby.
However, guard against gaudiness. If, for instance, you are wear
ing a gold derby, do riot also wear a cavalry sabre. This is too much.
Wear a dagger instead, or, for informal occasions, a Bowie knife.
(Speaking of Bowie knives, I wonder how many of you know
what a great debt this country — indeed, the whole world —owes
to the West Point class of 183G? You all know, of course, that, Colonel
.lames Bowie of the Class of 1836 invented the Bowie knife, but do
you know of the many other important contributions to cutlery
that were made by classmates of Colonel Bowie's? Are you aware,
for example, that Colonel Harry Clasp invented the Clasp knife?
Or that Colonel Harry Jack invented the Jack knife? Or that Colonel
Harry Putty invented the Putty knife? Or that Colonel Harry
Cannon invented the towel?
By a curious coincidence, every member of the graduating class
at the IJ. S. Military Academy in 18.'5 ft was named Harry, save for
Colonel James Bowie. This coincidence is believed unique in the
history of American education, though, of course, quite common
in Europe.)
But I digress. We were talking about men's campus fashions. Let
us turn now to a persistent rumor that a garment called I lie "suit"
is on the verge of making a comeback. Some of you older students
may remember the "suit." It was an ensemble consisting of a jacket
ami trousers, both of which — this'll kill you — both of which were
made out of the same, material!
The last "suit" ever seen on an American campus was in 1941 —
and 1 ought to know, because J was wearing it. Ah, 1941 ! Well do I
remember that melancholy year. I was an undergraduate then and
in love—hopelessly in love, caught in the riptide of a reckless romance
with a beauteous statistics major named Harry Sigafoos. (She is one
of the two girls 1 have ever known named Harry. The other one
is her sister.)
1 loved Harry though she was far too expensive a girl for me.
She liked to eat at fancy restaurants and dance at costly ballrooms
and ride in high priced cars. But worst of all, she was mad for
wishing wells. It was not unusual for her to drop coins into a
wishing well for two or three hours on end. My coins.
Bit by bit I sold off my belongings to pursue this insane courtship —
first my books, then my clothes, until finally J was left with nothing
to wear but a "suit." One night 1 came calling for her in this garment.
"What is that?" she gasped, her lip curling in horror.
"That is a 'suit' " I mumbled, averting my eyes.
"Well, I can't be seen around campus with you in that," said she.
"Please, Harry," 1 begged, "it's all I've got."
"I'm sorry," she said firmly and slammed the door.
1 slunk home and lit a Philip Morris and sat flown to think. I always
light a Philip Morris when I sit down to think, for their mild
vintage tobacco is a great aid to cerebration. 1 always light
Philip Morrises when I dov't sit down to think too, because
Philip Morris is my favorite cigarette, and I know it will he yours
too once you try that crazy vintage tobacco.
Well sir, smoking and thinking thus, my eye happened to fall on
an ad in the campus newspaper. "WIN A COMPLETE WARD
ROBE" said the ad. "Touhy's Toggery, the campus's leading men's
store, announces a contest to pick the best dressed man on campus.
The winner of the contest will receive, absolutely free, a blue hound's
tooth jacket, a yellow button-down shirt, a black knit tie, a tattersall
vest, gray flannel trousers, argyle socks, and white buck shoos with
two inch crepe soles."
My mouth watered at the thought of such a splendid wardrobe,
but how could anybody possibly pick me as the best dressed man on
campus —me in my "suit"? Suddenly an inspiration struck me. I
seized pen in hand and wrote a letter to the editor of the campus
newspaper:
"Dear Sir, I see by the paper that Touhy's Toggery is going to
give a complete wardrobe to the student picked as the best dressed
man on campus. What a ridiculous idea!
"Obviously, to be the best dressed man on campus, you must first
have a lot of clothes. And if you have a lot. of clothes, what do you
need with another wardrobe?
"Touhy's Toggery should give a new wardrobe to the worn! dressed
man on campus. Me, for instance. I am an eyesore. There isn't a crow
in town that will come near me. Three times this month the Salvation
Army salvage truck has picked me up. Esquire lias cancelled my
subscription.
"1 svmmit that a vote for me is a vote for reason, a vote for equity,
in short, a vote for the American way."
With a flourish, 1 signed the letter and sent it off. somehow feeling
certain that very soon I would be wearing a complete new wardrobe.
And I was right - because two weeks later I was drafted.
