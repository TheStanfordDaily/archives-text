# Braves Score Second Hoop Victory Over Vallejo, 62-49
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Stanford's Braves fought off a
late second-half drive by an out
classed Vallejo JC quintet to
garner their second win of the
season by a 62-49 margin in the
. vivilion last night.
Neither team was impressive as
they showed the effects of the two
weeks' holiday layoff. Coach George
Lynn's Braves have been able to'get
in only one day's practice since finals
w<*ek.
Vallejo's Redskins displayed little
.n the way of talent; however, the
rusty Braves were enough off form
to prevent the game from turning
into a rout.

Stanford led, .'5O-18. at the half and
appeared to have the game com
pletely under control. However,
with 10 minutes remaining in the
game and behind 57-32, the Red
skins assembled a drive of sorts and
managed to hold the Braves to five
points while they crept up to a 13-
point deficit. Time ran out on the
visitors at that point.
The small handful of spectators
saw the entire Braves squad in ac
tion as Lynn cleared his bench in
the second half.
Center Bob McGrath topped the
Braves in scoring with 13 points on
four field goals and five free throws.
McGrath was pushed for the top
spot by guard Bob Milton. Milton

contributed 10 points to the total.
Besides his scoring. Milton was
probably the best of the Braves with
his usual aggressive Moor play.
Floyd Gurnoe, Vallejo center, led
his team in the scoring column with
10. Gene Maki and J. C. Ledoux
followed with nine and eight.
The Braves now have a 2-0 rec
ord with a 66-60 victory over the
Athens Athletic Club in their opener
on Dec. 17.
The rest of the Braves scoring
against Vallejo is as follows: Ben
Heirs 9, Gunnar Christiansen 7, Bill
Flanders 6, Dave Dunn 6, John Hen
dricks 3, Bill Turner 2, Nick Vojvo
dich 2, Denis Mahoney 2, and Dick
Farm an 2.
