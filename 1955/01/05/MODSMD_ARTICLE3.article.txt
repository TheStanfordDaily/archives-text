# Panama Government Asks Aid in Search for Assassins
## 
### 
PANAMA, Jan. 4. (UP) —The Government called for outside aid
today in the search for the tommygun killers of President Jose A.
Remon, who had been warned several days before his assassina
tion that an attempt might be made on his life.
Authorities were concentrating on the theory that the assassins

had been imported from abroad, but
they continued to round up all Pan
amanians suspected of implication in
the plot. At least 20 additional sus
pects in the Sunday night race track
shooting had been arrested in the
past 24 hours, bringing the total un
der arrest to 50.
Cuba's top criminal investigator,
Dr. Israel Castellanos, head of the
Cuban Bureau of Investigation's
criminal laboratory, was expected
to arrive shortly at the request of
the Panamanian government. He
was bringing a group of picked aides
to help track down Remon's killers.
TURN DOWN REQUEST
The government also directed its
Washington embassy to secure the
services of two top FBI crime ex
perts, but the U.S. State Depart
ment turned down the request. A
State Department spokesman said
the United States wants to be help
ful but that U.S. law "prohibits it
from extending the type of service
requested."
Authoritative sources disclosed
meanwhile that Remon had been
warned a few days before he was
killed that he was a marked man.
The source of the warning was not
disclosed.
A group of prominent Panamanian
citizens opened a drive today to
build a reward fund for information
leading to the capture of the assas
sins. More than $5,000 was sub
scribed even before the fund was
publicized.
POLICE CHIEF HELD
In the roundup of Remon's politi
cal opponents, authorities today ar
rested Juan de Dios Pov'eda, chief
of the secret police under former
President Arnulfo Arias. Arias, a
bitter foe of Remon, remained in
custody.
Secret police still were question
ing two mystery women, Thelrna
King and Olga Yanis, reported to
have been present at the Juan Fran
co race track shooting Sunday night.
Both were reported carrying guns in
their bags. They were being held
incomunicado.
Disclosure that Remon was cut
down by slugs from a German-made
"Schmcisser" machinegun contrib
uted to the growing feeling that the
fatal ambush was the work of im
ported professionals. It was also felt
that the assassination was too well
planned to have been the work of
local political opponents or fanatics.

ARREST FORMER PRESIDENT—Panama's military police have
arrested former President Arnulfo Arias and many of his fol
lowers in a hunt for the tommy-gun assassins of President Jose
A. Remon. Among the scores of suspects picked up in the lightn
ing-like raids was a woman believed to be the mysterious "gun
moll" who may have given the assassins the signal to fire. Arias

PANAMA, Jan. 4. (UP) —The Government called for outside aid
today in the search for the tommygun killers of President Jose A.
Remon, who had been warned several days before his assassina
tion that an attempt might be made on his life.
Authorities were concentrating on the theory that the assassins

had been imported from abroad, but
they continued to round up all Pan
amanians suspected of implication in
the plot. At least 20 additional sus
pects in the Sunday night race track
shooting had been arrested in the
past 24 hours, bringing the total un
der arrest to 50.
Cuba's top criminal investigator,
Dr. Israel Castellanos, head of the
Cuban Bureau of Investigation's
criminal laboratory, was expected
to arrive shortly at the request of
the Panamanian government. He
was bringing a group of picked aides
to help track down Remon's killers.
TURN DOWN REQUEST
The government also directed its
Washington embassy to secure the
services of two top FBI crime ex
perts, but the U.S. State Depart
ment turned down the request. A
State Department spokesman said
the United States wants to be help
ful but that U.S. law "prohibits it
from extending the type of service
requested."
Authoritative sources disclosed
meanwhile that Remon had been
warned a few days before he was
killed that he was a marked man.
The source of the warning was not
disclosed.
A group of prominent Panamanian
citizens opened a drive today to
build a reward fund for information
leading to the capture of the assas
sins. More than $5,000 was sub
scribed even before the fund was
publicized.
POLICE CHIEF HELD
In the roundup of Remon's politi
cal opponents, authorities today ar
rested Juan de Dios Pov'eda, chief
of the secret police under former
President Arnulfo Arias. Arias, a
bitter foe of Remon, remained in
custody.
