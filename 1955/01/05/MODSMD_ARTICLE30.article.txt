# It's Just Winter Quarter But Angell Field Is Busy
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Track season may be in the spring, but trackmen work out in the
fall and winter as well. Coach Jack Weiershauser, an ironman
during his days on the cinders, sees to that.
And right now Weiershauser has a potentially topflight Stanford
track crew in training. Practically the entire team from last season

is returning. But two graduates will
be almost impossible to replace—Leo
Long, leading collegiate javelin man
last year, and Gerry Wood, one of
the top high hurdlers.
However, Weiershauser says, "We
ought to be a little better than last
year. We don't have outstanding
prospects in several events, but
there seems to be a little more depth
than last year."
On hand to replace Long, who
won the PCC and NCAA meets, are
bob Kimball and John Bugge. Both
Kimball and Bugge have tossed the
spear over 200 feet.
Jim Luttrell, a junior timber top
per, figures to assume Wood's posi
tion as number one Indian hurdler.
Sophomore Bernie Nelson, who won
the state meet in the high jump, will
back up Luttrell.
An important Stanford point-win

ner will probably be sprint star
Keith Brownsberger. Brownsberger
should be one of the top men in the
conference in the 100 and 220 again
this season. Other sprinters in train
ing are Jim Saras and Jack Groat.
In the 440 Weiershauser expects
great things from Walt Garrett. Also
possible quarter-mile entrants in the
Card fold include Bill Rupp, Larry
Spicer, Myron Hollister, Jim Easter,
Bob Hyde, and Chuck Ince.
However, while Spicer is a capable
440 man, he is probably the squad's
best half-miler and he'll undoubt
edly spend most of his effort on the
two - lap event. Bill Carls, Ford
Sims, and Joe Woollett from last
year's frosh will back up Spicer.
In the mile field Weiershauser has
available transfer Will King, veteran
Bob Reed, and junior Ralph Love.
King, Reed, and Love are also two
mile possibilities along with Chuck
Strong and Russ Ferguson.
One of the Tribe's strongest events
will be the high jump, for which
footballer John Stewart, Norm Jiles,
and sophomores Frank Herrmann,
Phil Fehlen, and Nelson are getting
into condition. All have cleared six
feet.
A 1 Cheney tops the list of Card
shot putters now propelling the 16-
pound sphere on Angell Field. Other
shot men are Phil Brabyn, Paul
Wiggin. and Bill Hammond.
Bob Kimball will be good for
points in the discus as well as the
javelin. And depth is provided by
Cheney, Kevin Cassedy, and Jim
Truher.
In the pole vault are Bill Flint, a
13-foot man, Jerry Angove, John
Whalen, Carlos Gonzales, and Duke
Johnson.
Frosh Coach Ray Dean expects to
have another good yearling crew in
1955. One of the top men will be
Maury Graves, a miler from Oak
land who has been clocked at 4:29.
He was one of Weiershauser's top
cross-country men this fall.

Truher.
In the pole vault are Bill Flint, a
13-foot man, Jerry Angove, John
Whalen, Carlos Gonzales, and Duke
Johnson.
Frosh Coach Ray Dean expects to
have another good yearling crew in
1955. One of the top men will be
Maury Graves, a miler from Oak
land who has been clocked at 4:29.
He was one of Weiershauser's top
cross-country men this fall.
Track season may be in the spring, but trackmen work out in the
fall and winter as well. Coach Jack Weiershauser, an ironman
during his days on the cinders, sees to that.
And right now Weiershauser has a potentially topflight Stanford
track crew in training. Practically the entire team from last season

is returning. But two graduates will
be almost impossible to replace—Leo
Long, leading collegiate javelin man
last year, and Gerry Wood, one of
the top high hurdlers.
However, Weiershauser says, "We
ought to be a little better than last
year. We don't have outstanding
prospects in several events, but
there seems to be a little more depth
than last year."
On hand to replace Long, who
won the PCC and NCAA meets, are
bob Kimball and John Bugge. Both
Kimball and Bugge have tossed the
spear over 200 feet.
Jim Luttrell, a junior timber top
per, figures to assume Wood's posi
tion as number one Indian hurdler.
Sophomore Bernie Nelson, who won
the state meet in the high jump, will
back up Luttrell.
An important Stanford point-win

ner will probably be sprint star
Keith Brownsberger. Brownsberger
should be one of the top men in the
conference in the 100 and 220 again
this season. Other sprinters in train
ing are Jim Saras and Jack Groat.
In the 440 Weiershauser expects
great things from Walt Garrett. Also
possible quarter-mile entrants in the
Card fold include Bill Rupp, Larry
Spicer, Myron Hollister, Jim Easter,
Bob Hyde, and Chuck Ince.
However, while Spicer is a capable
440 man, he is probably the squad's
best half-miler and he'll undoubt
edly spend most of his effort on the
two - lap event. Bill Carls, Ford
Sims, and Joe Woollett from last
year's frosh will back up Spicer.
In the mile field Weiershauser has
available transfer Will King, veteran
Bob Reed, and junior Ralph Love.
King, Reed, and Love are also two
mile possibilities along with Chuck
Strong and Russ Ferguson.
One of the Tribe's strongest events
will be the high jump, for which
footballer John Stewart, Norm Jiles,
and sophomores Frank Herrmann,
Phil Fehlen, and Nelson are getting
into condition. All have cleared six
feet.
A 1 Cheney tops the list of Card
shot putters now propelling the 16-
pound sphere on Angell Field. Other
shot men are Phil Brabyn, Paul
Wiggin. and Bill Hammond.
Bob Kimball will be good for
points in the discus as well as the
javelin. And depth is provided by
Cheney, Kevin Cassedy, and Jim
Truher.
