# Sharpshooting Ron Tomsic Leads Card Hoop Scoring
## 
### 
Amazing Ron Tomsic, back in the basketball business after a year of
forced rest, has demonstrated that he has lost none of his shooting prowess
—if anything he has improved—and now leads the Stanfdrd in
scoring and shooting accuracy after eight games.
Tomsic has pumped through 162 points in the cage campaign for a 20.2
average per game. Long-legged Russ Lawler. the 6-6V2 center, follows with
a total of 139 points, a 18.6 average. Playmaker George Sclleck and Barry
Brown are next with 78 and 70, respectively.
As a team the Cards have averaged 71 points a game during the young
season to 64.7 for their foes. Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers nabbed six of
their eight starts.
Tomsic leads the regulars in shooting accuracy from both the floor and the
free-throw line. He has pinpointed 48 percent of his field goal tries and 72
per cent of charity tosses. In the last nation-wide collegiate tabulation,
Tomsic was leading the country with a 67.4 average.
In the rebound department the Indians are paced by Lawler with 110,
a 13.7 average, and Brown with 86, a 10.7 average. Bill Bond is next with
40 rebounds.

Amazing Ron Tomsic, back in the basketball business after a year of
forced rest, has demonstrated that he has lost none of his shooting prowess
—if anything he has improved—and now leads the Stanfdrd in
scoring and shooting accuracy after eight games.
Tomsic has pumped through 162 points in the cage campaign for a 20.2
average per game. Long-legged Russ Lawler. the 6-6V2 center, follows with
a total of 139 points, a 18.6 average. Playmaker George Sclleck and Barry
Brown are next with 78 and 70, respectively.
As a team the Cards have averaged 71 points a game during the young
season to 64.7 for their foes. Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers nabbed six of
their eight starts.
Tomsic leads the regulars in shooting accuracy from both the floor and the
free-throw line. He has pinpointed 48 percent of his field goal tries and 72
per cent of charity tosses. In the last nation-wide collegiate tabulation,
Tomsic was leading the country with a 67.4 average.
In the rebound department the Indians are paced by Lawler with 110,
a 13.7 average, and Brown with 86, a 10.7 average. Bill Bond is next with
40 rebounds.
