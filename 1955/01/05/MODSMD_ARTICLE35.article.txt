# Birkie, Hansen Head Farm Boxing Squad
## 
### 
With heavyweight batterer Bob
Birkie'and middleweight Eric Han
sen as its feature attractions. Coach
Ray Lunny's Stanford varsity box
ing team will open its winter quar
ter schedule against California in
Berkeley on Jan. 15.
Birkie is the 6-2V2, 225-pound
junior battler who captured wide
spread local attention by bulling
five straight foes into submission.
This year Lunny expects Birkie to
combine finesse and grace with the
swarming style which overpowered
all comers last year.
Birkie, the son* of a former heavy
weight title contender, didn't enter
the Pacific Coast Conference tourna
ment last year because it comes dur
ing finals week. The same conflict
will occur this year, but Lunny
hopes a special arrangement will

permit him to compete.
Hansen was a welterweight last
year, but lie has moved up to the
165-pound class since. Hansen, a
three-year varsity letterman, has a
potent punch, good defensive skill,
and can hit effectively with either
hand.
Another veteran boxer is feather
weight Fred Dittmer, a 139-pound
pre-med student with two years' ex
perience, Bill Tolley, a 125-pound
contender, is another strong point
winning possibility for the Indians.
The rest of the squad includes Bill
Clark and Ken Doyle, 125 pounds;
Charles McLean, 132 pounds; Kay
Mosebar, 147 pounds; and Ed Ren
wick, 178 pounds.
The Stanford schedule includes
matches in the Pavilion against Cal
Poly (Jan. 19) and Cal (Feb. 11),

and away against Cal (Jan .15),
Chieo State (Feb. 18), and Santa
Clara (Feb. 24).
