# Fraternities and Sororities Have Both Contributed to Stanford Life
## 
### HARRY ROBERTS 
Since Stanford University first
opened its doors, Greek-letter
fraternities have played an in- '
tegral role in campus life. Dur
ing the first year of the Univer
sity's existence, chapters of
eight fraternities and two soro
rities, with a total membership
of 140 persons, were estab- ,
lished.
David Starr Jordan, University
president at that time, approved of
them and later stated that 'the |
chapter houses added much to the
appearance of the campus and have
constituted an important factor in
Stanford's social life."
The first fraternity to be chartered j
on campus was Zeta Psi, closely fol- :
lowed by Phi Delta Theta, Phi Kap- j
pa Psi, Phi Gamma Delta, Sigma Nu,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Alpha j
Tau Omega.
At first the Greeks had no chap
ter houses and continued to live in
Encina, although they did arrange
for separate tables in the dining
room. Then, in 1892, Phi Delta Theta
took over Lauro Hall, originally in
tended as a residence for unmarried
professors, and became the first
Stanford fraternity to have a house
of its own.
FRATERNITY ROW
The sorority members also resided
in University dormitories until ear
ly in 1900 when the Kappa Kappa
Sigmas moved into their new house.
By the summer of 1900. Beta Theta
Pi and Zeta Psi fraternities had
moved into their own houses while
the Chi Psi's, and Alpha Phi. Delta
Gamma, and Kappa Alpha Theta so
rorities were completing construc
tion of their new residences.
The University greeted this "new
era of fraternity life" with enthusi
asm. An article in the Sept. 13. 1900,
issue of the Daily Palo Alto, The
Daily's forerunner on campus, stated !
that the row of fraternity houses on i

Lasuen Street "which has become
known as 'Fraternity Row' is now
one of the chief objects of interest to
visitors at the University because of
the different styles of architecture
and the picturesque effect that the
new homes make."
Till; WAR YEARS
After they had become settled in
their own houses, the Stanford fra
ternities and sororities continued to
function and grow with the Univer-

I sity. At times, however, the future
of Greeks at Stanford seemed
perilously insecure. From the be
j ginning, these groups were periodi
cally accused of being undemocratic
or snobbish by students, parents, or
faculty members. As early as 1920
there was talk of abolishing the fra
; terntiy system at Stanford.
The war years of 1942 to 1946 saw
a tremendous'change in fraternity
life. The fraternity houses were
| taken over by the University and

renamed for past Presidents of the
United States. The houses of "Pres
idents' Row" became residences for
students, faculty, and military per
sonnel attending the University un
der government programs.
SORORICIDE
The sororities were allowed to re
tain their chapter houses during the
war, but they, found themselves
laced with problems of a different
kind. The sorority houses were
large enough to accommodate only
a limited number of pledges each
year. As a result only a small per
centage of Stanford women could
enter sororities. Public feeling and
resentment against this state of af
fairs grew until in 1044, as Time
magazine put it, sororicide was com
mitted on the Stanford campus.
When it was found that the sorori
ties themselves were in favor of
abolition, steps Were taken, and dis
bandment was ordered. According
to a statement issued by the then
University president, Dr. Donald B.
Tresidder, the sororities were not
only undemocratic, but it w'as unde
sirable to have sororities and frater
nities side by side.
Today the sororities are gong, but
the fraternities continue to play an
important role in the Stanford way
of life. Their self-governing body,
the Interfraternity Council, is now
in the process of reorganization in
order to achieve greater efficiency in
its duties. The position of the fra
ternity system today was summed
up by University President Dr. J. E.
Wallace Sterling in a recent address
to all fraternity members. Dr. Ster
ling said that the future of Stanford
fraternities was secure as long as
they continue to justify their exist
ence. "The burden of proof is on
you." he said, "but I think your
shoulders arc broad enough to carry
it lightly."
