# Frosh Flood Eating Clubs
## 
### BOB DURAND 
The 1955 rushing reason at Stan
ford opened with a bang last night
as the eating clubs held open house
to one of the biggest turnouts ever
seen at the clubs.
The response was the "greatest"
acording to Inter-Club Council Pres
ident Marty Armbrust, who was
worried that the rainy weather
might hold down the numbers of
rushees.
A continual heavy flow of visiting
freshmen and independent upper
classmen streamed through the clubs
between 7 and 9:30. By the time
the confusion had died down, the
rushees were full of punch and co
coa, and the clubmen were tired
of shaking hands.
The atmosphere in several clubs
was enhanced by the presence of
hostesses who were kept busy sup
plying everyone with food, which in
many cases ran out early due to
underestimation of the number of
men who would show up.
The impressions of th(j rushees
were varied. The usual signing of
the guest book was referred to as
the "line-up to sign up." Many were
heard groaning and mumbling some
thing about "eating too much."
All in all, it was a most successful
evening from the standpoint of
numbers. Whether or not it will be
successful in other ways is a ques
tion which should be answered in
the next couple of weeks.
