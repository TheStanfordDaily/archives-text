# 84th Congress Opens With Ike's Tariff Bill
## Control Goes To Democrats 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (UP)—
The Democrats reclaimed control
of Congress today in colorful
ceremonies and promptly
pledged to cooperate with the
Republican administration to
serve "the best interests of the
people."
With hearts warmed by prayer
and at least a temporary spirit of
friendship, the nation's lawmakers
convened the 84th Congress at noon
for two fateful years under new po
litical leadership.
Rep. Sam Rayburn of Texas, re
turning to the Speeaker's chair he
has occupied longer than any other
man, sounded the keynote that Dem
ocrats are expected to follow in
their dealings with President Eisen
hower.
Rayburn said the Democrats will
not look on the President's legisla
tive proposals "from a partisan
standpoint" but from the standpoint
of what they believe to be "the best
interests of the people."
DEMOCRATS "SMARTING"
But Rayburn also showed that hp
and other Democrats are still smart
ing from what they regarded as un
fair GOP campaign charges reflect
ing on the loyalty of the Democratic
party.
He said the Democrats "are not
going to indict people en masse" be
cause "we are not the accusing kind
of people." Any Democrat who ac
cuses someone of being "soft on
Communism," he said, will be
"frowned upon and repudiated by
me."
No legislative business was con
ducted at the opening meeting, but
a flood of bills began pouring into
the House hopper before the session
was an hour old. One of Mr. Eisen
hower's top proposals — liberaliza
tion of foreign trade—wys given top
billing.
MESSAGE TOMORROW
The Senate traditionally with
holds introduction of legislation un
til after the President's State of the
Union message, which Mr. Eisen
hower will deliver personally be
fore a televised joint session at noon
tomorrow.
When he steps to the House ros
trum tomorrow, Mr. Eisenhower is
expected to renew a request for
most of the legislation which failed
to pass last year. This includes
more liberal tariff-cutting powers, j
amendments to the Taft-Hartley
law. postal rate increases, statehood
for Hawaii and government pay .in
creases.
New features will include a mili
tary reserve training plan, an in
crease in the minimum wage from 75 j
to 90 cents, another postponement of ;
corporation and excise tax cuts, and ,
a 52G.000,000,000 Federal highway |
building program.
Today, packed public galleries
witnessed the swearing-in of both
old and new Senators and Congress- '
men and cheered lustily for one'
"old new face"—that of Sen. Alben
W. Barkley (D.-Ky.).
