# Fraternities Will Continue Open Houses and Rushing
## 500 Rushees Inspect Row 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Stanford's 24 fraternities,
sporting their welcome mats and
Sunday - best appearance, were
invaded by over SCO freshmen,
transfers, and other rushees as
the 1955 rushing season came to
the Row.
Last night's invasion of rushees
was a little slower than the average
first night all up and down the Row,
giving the freshmen a better chance
to see the houses and meet fraternity
members.
The routine was the same in most
houses: a hearty handshake at the
door for each rushee, an escorted
trip to the guest book, an invitation
to partake of punch and cookies, a
tour of the establishment, and a
little conversation before leaving.
After pumping as many hands as
possible and appraising the house
and its members as well as possible
in about 30 minutes, the rushees
hustle off for a similar routine at
the house next door.
For the fraternity man it is also
a series of strange faces and innu
merable handshakes. He has to
make a judgment of each man that
he guides around the house and then
start all over again with another
rushee.
KUSIIING CONTINUES
Tonight the open houses continue,
but during this 7:30 to 9:45 p.m. ses

Stanford's 24 fraternities,
sporting their welcome mats and
Sunday - best appearance, were
invaded by over SCO freshmen,
transfers, and other rushees as
the 1955 rushing season came to
the Row.
Last night's invasion of rushees
was a little slower than the average
first night all up and down the Row,
giving the freshmen a better chance
to see the houses and meet fraternity
members.
The routine was the same in most
houses: a hearty handshake at the
door for each rushee, an escorted
trip to the guest book, an invitation
to partake of punch and cookies, a
tour of the establishment, and a
little conversation before leaving.
After pumping as many hands as
possible and appraising the house
and its members as well as possible
in about 30 minutes, the rushees
hustle off for a similar routine at
the house next door.
For the fraternity man it is also
a series of strange faces and innu
merable handshakes. He has to
make a judgment of each man that
he guides around the house and then
start all over again with another
rushee.
KUSIIING CONTINUES
