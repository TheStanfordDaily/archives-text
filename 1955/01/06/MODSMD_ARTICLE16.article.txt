# Muzzle on Education
## 
### 
The San Francisco Board of Education was
unhappy last fall when the reappointment of
one of its members was openly opposed by
many teachers. So last month it passed a rule,
by a vote of 5-1, prohibiting participation of
teachers in the San Francisco Public School
System in campaigns of candidates running
for city, county, or school district offices.
Teachers may still campaign on issues, be
long to political organizations, attend political
meetings, and vote, according to the Board's
clarification of the ruling.
Monday six San Francisco teachers wrote
letters to Mayor Elmer Robinson, the Ameri
can Federation of Teachers, and the Classroom
Teachers Association of San Francisco urging
the reappointment of Charles Fcehn, president
of the Board of Education. (Mayor Robinson
has officially informed Foehn and the press
that he will be reappointed).
The letters were in deliberate defiance of the
Board's rule on political activity. The teachers
have stated that they will carry their test case
on the constitutionality of the rule to the Su
preme Court if necessary.
Reconsideration of the rule was voted down
Tuesday, 4-3. Board President Foehn opposed
the rule in both votes.
The political rule is opposed by political,
professional, and labor groups. They argue.

and we agree, that such a rule is an attempt
to stifle political consciousness of teachers and
control their political activity. Teachers would
be forced into a kind of second-class citizenship
in order to keep their jobs. And no distinction
was made between political activity during
school hours and after school.
We think the rule might be defensible if it
tried only to control political activity during
school hours, but when it attempts to control
political activity throughout the teacher's life,
we think it has gone far beyond its jurisdiction
and power.
People across the nation are increasingly
disturbed by the "inadeguacy" and "lack of
intelligent planning" in the present school sys
tems. Bui can we honestly expect teachers to
continue improving their methods of educat
ing children when five people succeed in re
stricting their political rights and extend un
reasonable control over them?
The rule is supported by the five Board mem
bers who originally formulated it and passed it.
It is opposed by the president of the Board, the
various teachers' associations, political organi
zations, the labor unions, and the people.
the constitutionality of this rule is test
ed in court, a vital part of democracy will also
be testedâ€”the political and intellectual free
dom of the teachers of America.
