# Who's Kidding?

### 
Twenty seven.per cent of the United States
land area was declared out of bounds for Rus
sian citizens by the State Department on Mon
day. The order came as a retaliatory measure
for Soviet restriction placed on travel by Amer
icans in the USSR
So far there has been no comment from
Moscow.
But Podunk, U.S.A., and hundreds of its coun
terparts across the country have sent outraged
protests to Washington. They are miffed be
cause they aren't considered vital enough to
national security to be included in a restricted
area.
Areas roped off to Russian travel aren't much
happier. Take San Francisco as an example.

San Francisco County is a restricted area—
no Russians allowed. The city of San Francisco
(same exact area) is open to Russian travel ex
cept in the port area.
New Orleans is also confused. The city is
listed as open, the parish as closed. Brooklyn
is the only part of New York City closed to the
Russians. *
And a non-existent county, St. Louis county,
has been included in the restricted grouping.
The city of St. Louis has been labeled open.
All this leads us to wonder who is kidding
whom on the matter of national security.
So far the State Department has declined to
answer.
