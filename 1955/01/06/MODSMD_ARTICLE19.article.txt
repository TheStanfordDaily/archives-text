# FOR BETTER GRADES
## Psychologist Gives 'Colorful' Singly Hints 
### 
Memory tricks, a time budget,
; and use of color in note-taking
| can make the difference be
tween failure and passing, aver
age or hpnor grades, according
to Dr. Daniel Brower, noted psy
chologist and director of psy
chological services for the New
York Personnel Laboratory.
Based on the latest psychological
research in efficient study tech
niques, the plan, given below, also
shows the student how to avoid the
dangers of an "over-learning black
out."
1. Study one subject an evening,
or, if necessary, two diverse subjects.
Studying two similar subjects may
cancel each other out.
2. Tailor your study to these three
psychological phases: Fresh reading
the first hour, complicated hard
study or problem solving the second
hour, review of familiar material
the third hour.
ENFORCED BREAKS
3. A high plateau of maximum
study efficiency can be prolonged by
taking an enforced break of five to
ten minutes at the end of the first
study hour. Do setting up exercises,
play u record, or chat with your
roommate (but not about school
work).
4. Save hours of time on lengthy
collateral reading by mustering your
textbook assignments first.
5. The first week of a new course,
learn the peculiarities of your lec
turer . . . how he organizes his ma
terial. Adjust your note-taking to
the individual style of each lecturer.
6. At lectures, if you retain from
hearing, listen attentively and take
few notes. The majority, with strong
visual memory, will rely more heav
ily on note-taking.
7. Leave very wide margins for
your review notes . . . even double
space.
COLOR IN NOTE-TAKING
8. Rely heavily on use of color in
note-taking, both at lectures and
during reading. Use red to indicate
you have missed something or don't
understand a point. Later, when you
review your notes, correct these red
danger points in green. Remember,
the points now marked in green rep
resent your psychological stumbling
blocks.
'9. When reading an assignment, go
quickly through a chapter without
any attempt to remember. Then re
read carefully. In making notes in
books you own, don't underline. This
takes time, leads to eye strain, and
is a poor memory device. Use col
ored checks in the margin or circle
an entire paragraph.
10. If you own your lab books,
don't waste time copying out of
them into your notebook. Mark in
red those sections you don't easily
and immediately understand.
QUIZ PREPARATION
11. You can cram the night before
for a short quiz. Read all your notes
once with no attempt to remember.
Then review thoroughly all items
that are now checked in red or
green. This way you concentrate
only on what has given you trouble
in the past.
12. Start reviewing at least a week
before midterms and finals. The day
before, read over all your notes
checked in red or green. The night
before, have a good time but get to
bed early. One hint . . . don't take a
30-second peek into your notebook
the day of the exam. You're sure
to" find something you think you
don't know. This will .lead to an
xiety or panic during the exam.
