# 'Contessa'—Good Show —But Not as Planned
## 
### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
It WASN'T what it was supposed to be.
That's about the easiest thing to say about the latest film done
by director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, "The Barefoot Contessa."
According to the Hollywood word-grinders' guild the lineup
i features sexy, seductive Ava Gardner, fresh from South America,
slinking across the screen to th< ♦

| strains of a gypsy mam bo, followed j
by Bogart's snaggle-toothed leer, in
I Spanish and Technicolor, with Miss i
j Gardner's lines running to something
like a husky-voiced "1 want you \
..." twice a scene. But it wasn't j
j that way.
The story Mankiewicz manages to
' pull out by workmanlike writing and ;
j directing comes through in spite of
j a tendency toward the usual movie
isms and a little too muen good old
! Southern California ham, with sur
[ prising freshness.
SERIES OF POSES
It isn't hard to decide what is j
wrong with the picture. Some of J
the scenes look as though they were J
a series of poses taken from an 1870 '
j Actor's Handbook of Artistic Poses, j
The dialogue often runs to solid j
' cliches. The Spanish accent Miss
Gardner is trying not to have makes j
her lines come out at times like a I
third-grader playing Theda Bara.
The picture is plotted as a series
<jf flashbacks covering the life of a
gypsy dancer discovered by Holly- j
wood. Each scene is narrated by
her director, Harry Dawes,, played
by Humphrey Bogart, or by a pub
lic relations council done by Ed
mund O'Brien under the name of
Oscar Muldoon.
I The camera runs its well-guided
lens technicolorically over pictur
eque scenery all the way from
Spain to Hollywood to Cannes to
Italy to Miss Gardner, and the
cameraman's eye proves to be one;
of the saving factors of the film. j
GARDNER SUCCESSFUL
Ava Gardner is more successful j
! in her part because she plays what j
she is—an actress, but she also at '
times forgets to forget what she is!
and clogs up the running of the 1
story every so often. Part of the j
fault can be traced back to the writ- i

! ing, which is pointed toward the
| subtle rather than the obvious and
I sometimes demands an interpreta
tion which simply can't be given to
; the lines.
Evidently the director eoncentrat-
J ed on the two stars of the picture,
j and let the supporting actors have
I fiee rein, lor several of them man
] age interpretations of their parts
; which are both efficient and spark -
! ling with realism. The press agent
j comes through as a real slob, but
j one who tries to be nice even if you
j don't have money.
j A South American playboy, acted
i by Mai ius Goring, comes through
| as a slob because he has got money,
1 anil provides some of the funniest
j scenes in the picture.
COUNT IS MASTERFUL
The Italian Count, with the ap
j propriate name—Vine en zo di Tor
j latto-Favrini—is played masterfully
as the Prince Charming of the pic-
I ture, although his constant repe
! tition of his family motto, evidently
j supposed to show us • that he is a
Stoic of the first order, gets to be
almost as ludicrous as the playboy's,
and his Italian accent often makes
the full meaning of his speeches hard
to grasp,
Despite Mankiewicz's preoccupa
tion with getting his moral across he
directs his characters through the
scenes like a cab driver through
traffic, delivering them and the pic
ture safely at the end.
Though not one of the great pic
: tures of the year, the Barefoot Con
; tessa is a not-highly-polished but
j translucent Hollywood gem and a
("good two hours' entertainment.
