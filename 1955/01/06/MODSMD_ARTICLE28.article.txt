team in scoring last year with a total of 315 points. He finished

fourth in conference scoring with 167. This year Moore is run
ning second to Willie Naulls in scoring with 122 points. Other
Bruins likely to see heavy action are three-year letterman guard
Ron Bane and Allen Herring, promising transfer from El Camino

but 'they will have their work cut out for them when playing at
the Pavilion. Starting time for both games is 8:30 p.m. Both
