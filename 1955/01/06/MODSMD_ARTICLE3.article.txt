# ENLISTEES WARNED:
## No More G.I. School Aid 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (UP)â€”
Military enlistments were boom
ing today, but a key House mem
ber warned that many volun
teers may be signing up in an
erroneous belief that they still
can qualify for a free education.
Representative Glin E. Teague
(D, Tex.), new chairman of the
House Veterans Committee, today
introduced a bill to make eligible
full wartime benefits not only to the
current crop of volunteers, but also
to those who have signed up in the
last year or so on the representation
of recruiters that they would get full
benefits.
Teague commented that the cur
rent upswing in recruiting undoubt
edly reflects the desire of young men
to get into the service before eligi
bility for the wartime benefits ex
pires on Jan. 31, as ordered by Pres
ident Eisenhower.
NO SUBSTANTIAL Ail)
. What many of the youngsters ap
parently do not know, Teague
warned, is that under the present
law they cannot get any substantial
entitlement for the school benefits,
even though they will be eligible for
other of the wartime benefits.
Representative Edith Nourse Rog
ers (Mass.), top Republican of the
veterans group, introduced a resolu
tion that would provide that educa
tional and other present GI benefits
would continue as long as the draft
is in force. President Eisenhower an
nounced Saturday that eligibility for
wartime benefits would be ended at
the end of the month. Since the an
nouncement, there has been a rush
to enlist in many areas.
GI BILL LIMITED
Teague pointed out that the Korean
GI bill alows a month and a half of
free schooling for every month in
service during the wartime period.
So a recruit signing up today would
be entitled to only something like
40 days of free education, not the
four years he might expect.
Teague said his bill would allow
any one in uniform on the cutoff date
to continue accumulation of eligi
bility for school benefits up to the
maximum. The payments under the
program are $110, $130 or $160 a
month, up to a maximum of $5,760.
Meantime, Teague said, recruiting
officers should tell volunteers plainly
that under present law they cannot
count on being educated at govcrn
mnet expenses. <
