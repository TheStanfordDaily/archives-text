# Professor Writes Book on Teacher, Pupil Relationship
## 
### 
The heart of the educational proc
ess, the relationship between the
teacher and the pupil, is the subject
of a new book by Stanford Education
Professor Robert N. Bush.
Dr. Bush applies to education the
"case method" of study, long used in
the professions of medicine, law, and
business, in his book, "The Teacher-
Pupil Relationship," published by
Prentice-Hall, Inc.
The book includes a case study of
a teacher and her class in a public
school. The teacher's relationship
with each pupil and with the class
as a whole is described in detail
and graphically illustrated.
One of the intereding proposals
by Dr. Bush is the "matching" of
teachers and pupils, according to
their respective abilities and needs
to create an atmosphere favorable to
learning. By this means personality
clashes in the classroom could be re
duced, he points out.
