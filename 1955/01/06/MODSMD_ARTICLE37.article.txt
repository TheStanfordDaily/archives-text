# Survey Indicates Farm Graduates Leave State
## 
### 
If a survey of Stanford University's Class of '47 can be used as
a yardstick, the State of California may be gradually losing its
home-grown collegians.
Five years after graduation, a fifth (111) of those who had en
tered Stanford as Californians were living elsewhere. Though the

Golden State picked up 90 new resi
dents who had come to Stanford
from other states, it sustained a net
loss of 21 graduates.
The other seven states of the Far
West (Washington, Oregon, Mon
tana, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, and Ari
zona) fared worse. sent 110
of their residents to Stanford. Only
78 Class of '47 graduates were resi
dents of these states five years later,
however.
On the other hand, the Eastern
states showed a jump from 20 to 51
in the five years and Southern states
from 9 to 25. In the Midwest there
was a drop from 30 to 27.
Director Eugene W. Dils of the
Stanford Placement Service headed
the survey. Of the 1,242 Class of '47
members, 759 (62 per cent) respond
ed to his questionnaire.
POSTWAR CLASS
As might be expected, 82 per cent
of the men and 75 per cent of the
women were married after five
years. Only 22 per cent of those
married had no children. A third
had one child, another third had
two; 69 others had three children,
eight had four, and four had five.
JOB CHANGES
Men averaged 2.6 positions in the
five years, women 2.2. Good em
ployment opportunities of the imme
diate postwar years and of the en
suing >'guns and butter" economy.
Dr. Dils suggested, may account for
the job changes.
Reports on salaries were inconclu
sive, he said. Roughly, the men
earned about $222 a month in their
first jobs, while women averaged
$143. After five years, their respec
tive earnings were approximately
$417 and $234.
In general, Dr. Dils observed, it
was interesting that most graduates
were doing the work they had been
trained for in college. Most engi
neering graduates were in engineer
ing jobs, education nlajors were
teaching, journalism majors were
writing, and so on.

On the other hand, the Eastern
states showed a jump from 20 to 51
in the five years and Southern states
from 9 to 25. In the Midwest there
was a drop from 30 to 27.
Director Eugene W. Dils of the
Stanford Placement Service headed
the survey. Of the 1,242 Class of '47
members, 759 (62 per cent) respond
ed to his questionnaire.
POSTWAR CLASS
As might be expected, 82 per cent
of the men and 75 per cent of the
women were married after five
years. Only 22 per cent of those
married had no children. A third
had one child, another third had
two; 69 others had three children,
eight had four, and four had five.
JOB CHANGES
Men averaged 2.6 positions in the
five years, women 2.2. Good em
ployment opportunities of the imme
diate postwar years and of the en
suing >'guns and butter" economy.
Dr. Dils suggested, may account for
the job changes.
Reports on salaries were inconclu
sive, he said. Roughly, the men
earned about $222 a month in their
first jobs, while women averaged
$143. After five years, their respec
tive earnings were approximately
$417 and $234.
In general, Dr. Dils observed, it
was interesting that most graduates
were doing the work they had been
trained for in college. Most engi
neering graduates were in engineer
ing jobs, education nlajors were
teaching, journalism majors were
writing, and so on.
If a survey of Stanford University's Class of '47 can be used as
a yardstick, the State of California may be gradually losing its
home-grown collegians.
Five years after graduation, a fifth (111) of those who had en
tered Stanford as Californians were living elsewhere. Though the

Golden State picked up 90 new resi
dents who had come to Stanford
from other states, it sustained a net
loss of 21 graduates.
The other seven states of the Far
West (Washington, Oregon, Mon
tana, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, and Ari
zona) fared worse. sent 110
of their residents to Stanford. Only
78 Class of '47 graduates were resi
dents of these states five years later,
however.
