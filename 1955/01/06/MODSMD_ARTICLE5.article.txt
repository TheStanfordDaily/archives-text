### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 5 (UP) â€”
President Eisenhower's proposal for
a three-year extension of the tarifT
cutting reciprocal trade law today
won the coveted number one spot on
the House legislative schedule.
A bill to carry out the program
was introduced on the opening day
of the new Democratic-steered 84th
Congress by Representative 4ere
Cooper (D., Tenn.). Cooper will
head the House Ways and Means
Committee which handles the txade
legislation.
The measure was designated as
House Resolution 1 and the new
Speaker, Democrat Sam Rayburn of
Texas, told reporters it probably will
be the first major legislation to come
before the House in the new ses
sion.
Mr. Eisenhower, who settled last
ye " - for a one-year extension of the
present law in the face of strong
GOP opposition, will spell out de
tails of his proposed program in his
State of the Union message to Con
gress tomorrow.
Representative Robert W. Kean
(R., N.J.), a member of the Ways
and Means group, also introduced
a bill to carry out the President's
objectives. But since Cooper is
chairman of the committee, his bill
is the one that will be acted on.
Like the program laid before the
Republican - controlled 83rd Con
gress by Mr. Eisenhower, Cooper's
bill followed the recommendations
of a special commission headed by
steel executive Clarence B. Randall,
which made an overall study of for
eign trade.
It would provide for a three-year
extension of the trade program and
arm the chief executive with au
thority to cut tariffs another 15 per
cent at a rate of not more than 5
per cent a year.
