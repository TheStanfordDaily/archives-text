WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (UP) -r
President Elsenhower today threw
his personal support behind Defense
Secretary Charles E. Wilson's drive
to cut military manpower by some
400.000 men by the middle of next
year.
The tentative manpower goals set
by Mr. Eisenhower in a letter to
Wilson were slightly higher than
those announced by the Defense De
partment last month. But the White
House said the President was using
"round figures" and was referring
to tentative goals.
Mr. Eisenhower said he favored
cutting the armed forces to "'about
3,000.000" men by next June 30 and
to 2,850.000 men in the following
fiscal year. Wilson had set the goals
at 2,940,000 by June 30 and 2,815,000
at the end of fiscal 1956.
Mr. Eisenhower said that "expe
rience will determine" how much
the armed forces can be cut after
next July 1. He said it "would not
be wise" to fix rigid targets now
for 1956 but "'as a goal I suggest a
strength of 2,859,000" by that time.
