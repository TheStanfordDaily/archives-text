# EXCOM:
## Red Editor Visits to US Endorsed 
### DICK MANSFIELD Associate Editor, The Daily 
The Executive Committee vot
ed to endorse a movement to
bring Soviet student newspaper
editors to this country for what
would amount to "guided tours,"
at a short, lightly-atttended meet
ng in the Excom Room last night.
The Excom vote apparently adds
Stanford's name to a list of colleges
whose student bodies are currently
petitioning the United States State
Department to admit the Russian
student editors.
The movement, organized by the
Student Council of Swarthmore Col
lege (of Pennsylvania) with the co
operation of the student council of
six other small colleges, followed re
fusal by the State Department to
issue visas to the Russians.
American students have been giv
en travel privileges in Communist
countries regularly in the past, but
these privileges have not been re
ciprocated, a Swarthmore Student
Council press release points out. The
seven colleges have sent letters to
Secretary of State Dulles and At
torney General Brownell urging that
visas be granted to the student edi
tors.
BRISK DISCUSSION
Excom members engaged in a
brisk discussion of the issue, after
having established an Excom policy
of considering political matters of
this sort only as they directly affect
students at Stanford. The immediate
question was how pertinent this mat
ter is to the Stanford student body.
A key point brought in favor of
endorsement was the fact that Amer
ican student newpaper editors are
regularly invited to tour Russia (at
their own expense). Brought, against
the motion for endorsement were
arguments that such action might
work against "Stanford's good name."
In passing the motion for endorse
ment, Excom brushed aside a mo
tion for delay to get more informa
tion on the matter. Hie final vote
for endorsement was passed by a
count of six to three, with three Ex
com members abstaining.
Other Excom action last night cen
tered around matters of procedure
and policy. With member attendance
cut by the first night of fraternity
rushing open houses, the body tabled
several matters for next week's
meeting.
CONSTITUTIONAL TALKS
Excom will meet this Sunday at
4 p.m. in an informal non-compuls
ory session to decide on issues and
procedure for next week's constitu
tion discussion.
ASSU President Peter Bing will
in the future report from time to
time on the more important matters
brought up in committees of which
he is a member ex officio.
Bing asked Excom members to be
prepared to hear and discuss NSA
coordinator A 1 Loomis' report at
next week's meeting. Selection of a
new chairman for Election Board,
to succeed Ann Powell, was post- )
poned at the request of Row repre- j
sentativc Sam Palmer.

Bing asked Excom members to be
prepared to hear and discuss NSA
coordinator A 1 Loomis' report at
next week's meeting. Selection of a
new chairman for Election Board,
to succeed Ann Powell, was post- )
poned at the request of Row repre- j

The Executive Committee vot
ed to endorse a movement to
bring Soviet student newspaper
editors to this country for what
would amount to "guided tours,"
at a short, lightly-atttended meet
ng in the Excom Room last night.
The Excom vote apparently adds
Stanford's name to a list of colleges
whose student bodies are currently
petitioning the United States State
Department to admit the Russian
student editors.
The movement, organized by the
Student Council of Swarthmore Col
lege (of Pennsylvania) with the co
operation of the student council of
six other small colleges, followed re
fusal by the State Department to
issue visas to the Russians.
American students have been giv
en travel privileges in Communist
countries regularly in the past, but
these privileges have not been re
ciprocated, a Swarthmore Student
Council press release points out. The
seven colleges have sent letters to
Secretary of State Dulles and At
torney General Brownell urging that
visas be granted to the student edi
tors.
BRISK DISCUSSION
Excom members engaged in a
brisk discussion of the issue, after
having established an Excom policy
of considering political matters of
this sort only as they directly affect
students at Stanford. The immediate
question was how pertinent this mat
ter is to the Stanford student body.
A key point brought in favor of
endorsement was the fact that Amer
ican student newpaper editors are
regularly invited to tour Russia (at
their own expense). Brought, against
the motion for endorsement were
arguments that such action might
work against "Stanford's good name."
In passing the motion for endorse
ment, Excom brushed aside a mo
tion for delay to get more informa
tion on the matter. Hie final vote
for endorsement was passed by a
count of six to three, with three Ex
com members abstaining.
Other Excom action last night cen
tered around matters of procedure
and policy. With member attendance
cut by the first night of fraternity
rushing open houses, the body tabled
several matters for next week's
meeting.
CONSTITUTIONAL TALKS
Excom will meet this Sunday at
4 p.m. in an informal non-compuls
ory session to decide on issues and
procedure for next week's constitu
tion discussion.
ASSU President Peter Bing will
in the future report from time to

brought up in committees of which
he is a member ex officio.
