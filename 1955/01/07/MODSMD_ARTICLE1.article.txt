# Hectic Rushing Weekend Nears
## Row Will Begin Formal Rushing 
### 
Rushing open houses again
monopolized Row activity last
night as the alphabetically-di
vided rushees visited the fratern
ities they missed during Wed
nesday's initial tour.
Tonight and tomorrow fraternity
rustling continues with three more
open houses followed by the free
for-all of formal rushing beginning
tomorrow night, at 9.
Tonight from 7:30 to 9:45 the A-K
group of rushees are scheduled to
visit the Upper Row, with the L-Z
group investigating the 12 Lower
Row houses. Tomorrow afternoon
from 2:30 to 4:30 the procedure will
be reversed with A-K going to
Lower Row and L-Z to Upper Row.
Tomorrow night, the Row will be
open to all rushees from 7:30 to 9
before formal rushing begins and
the open houses end in favor of stag
parties off campus.
The week of formal or unlimited
rushing is featured by a series of
invitational parties, dinners, and
lunches. But the usual fraternity
invasion of the frosh dorms will be
severely curtailed under a new rule
established by the frosh sponsors.
Fraternity and club men will be
allowed in freshman living group
wings only between the hours of
11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., and from
5:30 to 7:30 p.m. At other times in
Encina fraternity and club men will
bo restricted to the lobby and the
house phone.
According to Village sponsors,
since the Village frosh wings have
no equivalent to the Encina lobby,
the fraternities and clubs should
contact a rushee by phone and ar
range a meeting place outside ti e
dorm.
As in the past, all fraternity and
club members must leave Encina
lobby by 11 p.m.
The new rule is designed to give
the f-eshmen a little peace and quiet
in their rooms during the day.
Lower Row houses are Alpha

monopolized Row activity last
night as the alphabetically-di
vided rushees visited the fratern
ities they missed during Wed
nesday's initial tour.
Tonight and tomorrow fraternity
rustling continues with three more
open houses followed by the free
for-all of formal rushing beginning
tomorrow night, at 9.
Tonight from 7:30 to 9:45 the A-K
group of rushees are scheduled to
visit the Upper Row, with the L-Z
group investigating the 12 Lower
Row houses. Tomorrow afternoon
from 2:30 to 4:30 the procedure will
be reversed with A-K going to
Lower Row and L-Z to Upper Row.
Tomorrow night, the Row will be
open to all rushees from 7:30 to 9
before formal rushing begins and
the open houses end in favor of stag
parties off campus.
The week of formal or unlimited
rushing is featured by a series of
invitational parties, dinners, and
lunches. But the usual fraternity
invasion of the frosh dorms will be
severely curtailed under a new rule
established by the frosh sponsors.
Fraternity and club men will be
allowed in freshman living group
wings only between the hours of
11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., and from
5:30 to 7:30 p.m. At other times in
Encina fraternity and club men will
bo restricted to the lobby and the
house phone.
According to Village sponsors,
since the Village frosh wings have
no equivalent to the Encina lobby,
the fraternities and clubs should
contact a rushee by phone and ar
range a meeting place outside ti e
dorm.
As in the past, all fraternity and
club members must leave Encina
lobby by 11 p.m.
The new rule is designed to give
the f-eshmen a little peace and quiet
in their rooms during the day.
