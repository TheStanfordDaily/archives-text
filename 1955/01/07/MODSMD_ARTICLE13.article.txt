# BASKETBALL TWIN BILL
## Cards Open PCC Play Against Tough Bruins 
### BILL WRIGHT 
It'll be the high-speed, high
scoring, highly ranked UCLA
Bruins from West wood challeng
ing Stanford's sharpshooting
cagers tonight as the Pacific
Coast Conference basketball
scramble gets under way.
The Indians, rested and fresh af
ter a successful Eastern swing, wil]
host the tall, fast-breaking Bruin?
tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 in the
Pavilion in contests which should
accurately indicate the champion
ship calibcr of both squads.
The Uclans of recently rehired
(for five years) Johnny Wooden are
the choicc of most basketball ex
perts and writers to take the South
ern Division flag away from the SC
Trojans, last year's champs.
But the Indians, with Ron Tomsic,
Russ Lawler, and George Selleck
at the throttle, will provide stiff
competition for the Bruins in what
should be a wide-open race.
In fact, the St. Louis Sporting
News, the baseball bible which
prints an all-sports supplement, has
the Cards tabbed to take both
games. Whether the Tribe can man
this feat depends primarily on
the ability of the Indians to halt
UCLA's race-horse attack.
New Stanford Coach Howie Dall
mar, who will get his PCC initia
tion tonight, scouted UCLA in two
games last month—against Niagara

at Madison Square Garden and
against Santa Clara at the San Fran
cisco Cow Palace. Thus he is vividly
familiar -with the brand of ball
played by the Bruins.
The Cards will be facing a squad
with superior depth and height and
at least equal speed. And the Dall
mar crew will have to rely on the
factors which have led them to six
triumphs against two losses.
The Tribe will have to work for
good shots, make as great a per
centage of them as it has thus far
(42 per cent), and keep the Bruins
from operating their exhausting fast
break. If the fast break wears out
Bruins, there are more Bruins; if
the fast break wears out Cards,
their bench strength won't match
UCLA's.
Wooden particularly fears Tomsic,
Lawler, and Selleck among the In
dians — as well he might. Tomsic,
seemingly better after a year's rest,
has bucketed 48 per cent from the
floor for a 20.2 average in eight
games. He put on a phenomenal
performance in the two games in the
Pavilion before dead week with his
unerring shooting.
has been almost as effec
tive; he has tossed in an average of
18.6 tallies per game with his grace
ful, soft hook shots. According to
Dallmar, Lawler should surprise ob
servers —good as he was last year —
with his all-around improvement.
Selleck is the floor general for the
