# BASKETBALL TWIN BILL
## Cards Open PCC Play Against Tough Bruins 
### BILL WRIGHT 
It'll be the high-speed, high
scoring, highly ranked UCLA
Bruins from West wood challeng
ing Stanford's sharpshooting
cagers tonight as the Pacific
Coast Conference basketball
scramble gets under way.
The Indians, rested and fresh af
ter a successful Eastern swing, wil]
host the tall, fast-breaking Bruin?
tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 in the
Pavilion in contests which should
accurately indicate the champion
ship calibcr of both squads.
The Uclans of recently rehired
(for five years) Johnny Wooden are
the choicc of most basketball ex
perts and writers to take the South
ern Division flag away from the SC
Trojans, last year's champs.
But the Indians, with Ron Tomsic,
Russ Lawler, and George Selleck
at the throttle, will provide stiff
competition for the Bruins in what
should be a wide-open race.
In fact, the St. Louis Sporting
News, the baseball bible which
prints an all-sports supplement, has
the Cards tabbed to take both
games. Whether the Tribe can man
this feat depends primarily on
the ability of the Indians to halt
UCLA's race-horse attack.
New Stanford Coach Howie Dall
mar, who will get his PCC initia
tion tonight, scouted UCLA in two
games last month—against Niagara

at Madison Square Garden and
against Santa Clara at the San Fran
cisco Cow Palace. Thus he is vividly
familiar -with the brand of ball
played by the Bruins.
The Cards will be facing a squad
with superior depth and height and
at least equal speed. And the Dall
mar crew will have to rely on the
factors which have led them to six
triumphs against two losses.
The Tribe will have to work for
good shots, make as great a per
centage of them as it has thus far
(42 per cent), and keep the Bruins
from operating their exhausting fast
break. If the fast break wears out
Bruins, there are more Bruins; if
the fast break wears out Cards,
their bench strength won't match
UCLA's.
Wooden particularly fears Tomsic,
Lawler, and Selleck among the In
dians — as well he might. Tomsic,
seemingly better after a year's rest,
has bucketed 48 per cent from the
floor for a 20.2 average in eight
games. He put on a phenomenal
performance in the two games in the
Pavilion before dead week with his
unerring shooting.
has been almost as effec
tive; he has tossed in an average of
18.6 tallies per game with his grace
ful, soft hook shots. According to
Dallmar, Lawler should surprise ob
servers —good as he was last year —
with his all-around improvement.
Selleck is the floor general for the

Indians. He shooting as much
as last year, but he's again astound
ing opposition with lii.s cleft pass
ing and playmaking.
After "watching many teams dur
ing his swing across the country,
Dallmar said he wouldn't trade
Tomsic and Selleck for any other
pair of guards he saw, or Lawler for
any other center.
The rest of the Curd starting five
will be Bill Bond, the promising
sophomore from Long Beach, and
Barry Brown, who has greatly
increased the Tribe's rebound
strength.
Against the Stanford starters will
he a team full of talented Uclans.
Taft, a G-3 junior, has become the
latest sensation of the star-studded
Bruin crew. Taft can be deadly
accurate with a driving jump shot,

and he is Coach Wooden's best play
maker, replacing the graduated Ron
Livingston. Little 5-8 Selleck will
probably be assigned to guard Tai't.
Loose-jointed, long-armed Johnny
Moore is a dangerous threat at one
forward slot. If he starts connect
ing with the nets, he's practically
impossible to stop.
At the other forward will be un
predictable. extremely talented Don
Bragg. Bragg at (5-4 is an excellent
rebound man and a threat from
anywhere on the court. He's the
type of player who gets the points
when they count the most.
Wee Willie (The Whale) Naulls.
the Bruins' leading scorer with 142
points in 10 games, will be at center.
The 6-5 junior is awfully active for
a man of £25 pounds, and lie has an
excellent eye. He can be the Uclans"
strongest or weakest link, depending
on what night it is.
The other starter is Eddie White;
he's not as flashy or experienced as
the other four, but he can hurt you,
too. In reserve the Bruins have Ron
Bane, about the best man on the
coast when he's right, and A 1 Her
ring and Dave Hall, both JC trans
fers.
