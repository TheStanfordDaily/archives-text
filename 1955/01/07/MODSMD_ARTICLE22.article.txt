During the past two years college editors
from Reed, Oberlin, Northwestern, Knox, and
the Universities of Michigan, Colorado, Chi
cago, and Minnesota have toured the Soviet
Union.
They visited Moscow and Kiev, Odessa and
Leningrad. They interviewed students and
bureaucrats, farmers and clerks. They snapped
j ictures,' watched factories in operation, sam
pled new food.
When they returned to the United States they
v ere unanimous in their praise of the trip. They
d : not choose to Live in the USSR, but they had
gained a knowledge of its people and country
/Inch would make it easier for them to live
with the Soviet Union in one world. They did
jio! accept the communist faith, but they had
a clearer understanding of its meaning and
operation.
Russian, college editors have not been so
fortunate. No Russian students have been al
lowed in the United States for several years,
pparently tor the rather obvious reason that
they are members of the communist party and
.ire citizens of a nation unfriendly to the United
States.

Their only chance to view life outside a com
munist totalitarian state has been refused by
the government which condemns them for sup-;
pressing free thought and free expression of
opinion.
Wednesday night the Executive Committee
took a strong, forv/ard step aimed at reversing
this one-sided exchange between Soviet and :
American students.
In reply to a letter from Swarthmore College
in Pennsylvania, they voted to endorse a state-!
ment iequecting the State Department to grant 1
entrance to 15 Russian student editors who have
applied for visas to vi3it the United States.
By this action the Executive Committee has;
placed Stanford right where it belong®, in a r
position of leadership an a free university pro-;
tecting the principle on which it was founded
- the free exchange of knowledge and ideas.
If the State Department approves these Soviet i
visas, it will prove to the world what Stanford 1
students have known for a long time. That!
we Americans don't fear the impact of foreign!
ideologies—even communism—as long as we
believe in the democratic ideals we claim to !
support.
