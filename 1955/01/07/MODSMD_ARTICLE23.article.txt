# CAMPUS OPINION
## Bridge of Understanding 
### 
Dejir Stanford Students:
I am not your guest any longer. I am back in my
home country, ami my beautiful year at Stanford be
longs to the past. But it will remain an unforgettable
n rnory; unforgettable because of your hospitality
nd your willingness to exchange ideas. It was a mOst
exciting and interesting experience to live with you,
to accept your way of living, and to become a real
fi •end.'' of yours.
I sincerely hope that the distance between California
and Switzerland will not destroy the bridge of under
standing, built during my year as a 1953-1954 ASSU
foreign scholar. I want to bring this understanding
to my fellow-students—students who are very eager
to hear about the United States. The student exchange
program is not finished when the student leaves his
host country. In fact, the program reaches its full
significance only when the exchange student gets

back home and discusser with his countrymen his
experiences abroad. To accomplish that, he has to keep
in touch with his hosts. You all were my hosts, and 1
would like to keep in touch with you, in order to
fight better against the many European prejudices (as
far as the U.S. is concerned).
I want to thank you all very sincerely. My special
thanks go to the three fraternities in which I lived:
Phi Delt, AKL, and Alpha Delt: I had such n great
time with you!
My best wishes for Christmas and New Year to you
all; and don't lorgct: there's a standing invitation for
everyone of you who intends to visit my countiy, at
