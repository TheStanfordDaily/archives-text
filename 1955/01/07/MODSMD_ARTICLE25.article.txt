# Ram's Head Show Tryouts to Be Held
## 
### 
Tryouts and first rehearsal for an
hour-long Ram's Head show will be
held Monday at 7:M() p.m. in the
Ram's Head room.
The show, called The Pomp Re
view, will be presented to Palo Alto
service clubs and other Bay Area
organizations. It requires talent that
cannot be used in Gaieties, Spring
Show, and other Ram's Head pro
ductions.
Writers, assistant directors, mu
sicians, and dancers are needed for
the production, either as single acts
or groups. Richie? Meyer is the pro
ducer and director.
Rams' Head points will be given
for work on the show.
