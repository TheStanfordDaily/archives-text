# 'Men—Let’s Beat Those Bruins'

STRATEGY TALK—Coach Howie Dallmar gives the
Card cagers their final instructions before tonight's
Pacific Coast Conference cage opener with UCLA's
Bruins at the Pavilion. Grouped around the Indian
mentor (left to right) are Barry Brown, Leo Schwai
ger, George Selleck, Russ Lawler, Ron Tomsic, Bill
Bond, and Bill Turner. Both Stanford and the Bruins

have recently returned from successful road trips in
the East. The Indians have triumphed over two pre
viously unbeaten quintets, Seton Hall and Vander
bilt. Coach John Wooden's hoopsters from the
Southland scored impressive victories over Niagara
and Dayton in the New York Holiday Festival. The
fast-breaking Bruins finished second in the 1954

Southern Division title chase, losing the champion
ship to USC on the final night of the season. Re
turning from last year's title contenders are Willie
Naulls, Johnnie Moore, Don Bragg, Eddie White, Ron
Bane, and Morris Taft. Probable starters for the
Cards tonight are Brown, Bond, Lawler, Selleck, and
Tomsic.
