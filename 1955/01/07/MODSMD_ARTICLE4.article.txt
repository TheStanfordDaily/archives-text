# Clubs to Host Rushees Tonight
## 
### 
Rushees will get their final
look at the seven eating clubs
tonight and tomorrow night
when the clubs hold open house
from 7:30 to 9:30.
These will be the last activi
ties of open rushing. Closed
rushing will continue for a week.
Rushees may be invited to join a
club at any time. Freshmen are al
lowed to take part in the social ac
tivities of their club as soon as
they accept membership.
Rules governing pledging and
initiation are regulated by each in
dividual club instead of being gov
erned by the Interclub Council.
The seven clubs band together
several times a year for such events
as the Interclub beach party or the
all-campus homecoming dance. In
athletics, the clubs compete with
each other for championship troph
ies in the major sports, besides tak
ing part in the school intramural
program.
Interclub council president Marty
Armbrust, along with representa
tives from all the clubs, has been
most enthusiastic about the response
of the rushees this year. Tuesday
night's open house saw the clubs
flooded with interested freshmen.
Club members who have been
around for several years are almost
unanimous in their opinion that
prospects for this years rushing are
brighter than ever before.
Again, rushees should be remind
ed that dress for the open houses
should be casual and informal. Slacks
and sportshirts or sweaters should
be worn according to Armbrust.
The seven eating clubs are Los
Arcos, El Campo, El Capitan, El
Cuadro, Breakers, El Tigre, and El
Toro.
