# French Decisions on Indochina, Europe Discussed Here by French Deputy Consul
## 
### DAVE SCOTT 
The reasons behind France's
decision in the Indochina and
European unification problems
were the main topics in the talk
"French International Policy in
1954" given by Yves Roubaud,
French deputy consul, in the
Bowman Alumni House yester
day afternoon.
Speaking before a gathering of
approximately 100 students, Rou
baud opened his talk with remarks
on the Indochina agreement. 'Re
unification of Korea was one big
headache of the Indochina Geneva
| conference, but the main reason for
| the conference was to reach agree
! ment on Indochina," he stated.
He declared that the Reds wanted
to tic up the political situation with
J the military in the Indochina agree
ment. The French agreed to this
when Mendes-France replaced Bi
j dault as prime minister. The divi
j sion of Indochina was agreed upon,
with elections for both sections set
for 1956, he declared.
Roubaud stressed the fact that
"the Korean agreement was purely
a military one, a very carefully
drawn line from coast to coast of
the country. Nothing was done
about the future of the country.
"In Dien Bien Phu \he guns of
the Soviets, who fought beside us
in World War 11, were turned
against us. Thus this was the first
big fight against world Communism.
To be won it had to be fought under
the blue flag of the U.N. But the
free nations in the U.N. refused
chiefly because of Great Britain.
"If we had had 200 planes in
cluding 100 strategic bombers sup
plied by the free world, in our final
defense of Dien Bien Phu, the out
come might have been different."
Moving to EDC. the deputy con
j sul from San Francisco stated, "Be

cause of the Channel separating
them from the mainland, the British
think they are protected, which is
ridiculous. EDC was not rejected by
France, but by Great Britain." He
explained that when France saw
that England was not interested in
EDC, the French turned it down be
cause they refused to fight without
England joining them.
He said that the present agree
ment on joint armament is superior
to EDC because of British participa
tion, the continuance of U.S. armed
divisions in Europe, and all the
countries are on equal footing in
stead of subjecting themselves to a
controlling organization,
Mentioning the squabble over the
Saar valley, over which France now
has economic control, Roubaud de
clared, "If the Saar is given to Ger
many economic balance in Germany
is upset because of competition

with the Ruhr valley; if given to ]
France economic balance in both j
countries is restored."
