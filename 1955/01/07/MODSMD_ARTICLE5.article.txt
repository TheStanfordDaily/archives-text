## Confusion In Excom 
### DICK MANSFIELD Associate Editor, The Daily 
Confusion prevailed yester
day over the exact meaning ol
the Executive Committee's vote
Wednesday night on proposed
endorsement of a movement to
let Russian student editors visit
this country.
Source of the confusion was a
split vote on the Issue at the regular
Excom meeting Wednesday. Six
members voted for endorsement,
three against it, and three members
abstained from voting.
ASSU President Pete Bing indi
cated that the motion was passed,
but Student Manager Bob Gable
Hold yesterday morning that the ab
stentions had killed the motion, and
the minutes of the meeting said that,
the motion had not passed.
Examination of Roberts' Rules of
Order, the standard reference work
on parliamentary procedure, con
firmed that the vote was sufficient
to pass the motion, as originally
understood.
Members of any lx>dy who abstain
from voting do not have any control
of the final outcome of the vote, but,
according to Roberts' Rules, must
abide by the decision of the major
ity of those who do vote. This rul
ing probably excepts the ease of a
quorum requirement.
As a result of the ruling, the Wed
nesday night meeting's minutes
stand in error.
Five new appointees and three
new officers for the Fundamental
Standard Committee were approved
at the Wednesday night meeting.
New members are Denny An
spach, a junior, Harry Miller, a
graduate student; and sophomores
Judy Lehman and Grctchcn Scholtz.
Sally Parker, a junior, was named
as alternate.
New officers are Bob Norman,
chairman; Ellie Kronfeld, secretary;
and Ed Schneidcrs, treasurer.
ASSU Vice - President Diannc
Goldman announced interviews for
1 he curriculum evaluation commit
tee, which will work with President
Wallace Sterling and the faculty and
administration. Interviews for the'
13-member committee will be held
Monday from 2 to 3 p.m. and Tues
day from 4 to 5 p.m.
Excom also moved to invite the
i NSA co-ordinator to attend Excom
; meetings each week to establish
j contact between Excom and NSA.
1 Discussion indicated that in its
study of the proposed new constitu
tion, Excom will consider making
the NSA co-ordinator an ex-ofiicio
member of Excom. Al Loomis is
currently NSA co-ordinator at Stan
ford.
