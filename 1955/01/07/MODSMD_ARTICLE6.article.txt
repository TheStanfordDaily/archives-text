# Ike Asks for Co-operation In Congressional Address
## 
### 
| WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (UP) •-
i President Eisenhower appealed to
the Democratic Congress today for
"unhesitating co-operation" lest the
government be plunged into "para
lyzing indecision" in the critical cold
war "stalemate."
Democratic leaders promptly re
| sponded with a pledge that the
• President's 1955 legit lative program
| will "receive reasonable considera
tion by reasonable men." They
hailed his pica for "good will and
harmony" but raised some storm
warnings over his military man
power and farm programs.
The President declared in his
State of the Union message to a fre
quently cheering joint session of the
House and Senate that the present
political split, between the Demo
cratic Congress and the GOP ad
ministration puts both parties "on
trial before the American people."
He pledged himself to do every
thing possible to assure friendly re
lations with Congress and asked the
lawmakers to let the "general good"
be their yardstick on all great is
sues. He reported the U.S. economy
in good shape and getting better.
One of the few surprises was Mr.
Eisenhower's request for prompt
federal action to relieve an "un
precedented classroom shortage" in
the nation's schools. He promised
to submit detailed recommendations

! to Congress next, month,
i He asked again for the 13-year
old vote, authority to start 70,000
| public housing units over tlu? next
I two years, his controversial health
I reinsurance plan and statehood for
normally Republican Hawaii — but
j not traditionally Democratic Alaska
j —at this time.
I He also proposed legislation to
| help the states deal with juvenile
j delinquency and the narcotics traf
| fic and recommended creation of a
j special commission in the Depart
j ment of Health, Education and Wei-.
I fare to "encourage artistic endeav
i or."
In the field of foreign affairs, Mr.
i Eisenhower said he is "hopeful of
I continuing progress" toward lasting
i peace, but conceded that the current
international situation is "merely
world stalemate." However, he add
ed that the stalemate gives the free
world a chance to work for "dur
able" peacc if all parties work to
gether.

Mr. Eisenhower said the new mil
itary budget, will stress airpower
and atomic-hydrogen weapons. He
promised a flexible defense program
geared to new weapons and tech
niques "to give our nation a defense
accurately adjusted to the national
need."
