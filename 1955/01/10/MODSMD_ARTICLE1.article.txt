# Card Basketballers Split Series With Tough Visiting UCLA Five
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
(t was a glorious victory for Stanford's basketball five literally
five -Friday night as the Card first string bottled up the awesome
scoring punch of the UCLA Bruins, 61-55.
But Saturday, Coach Howie Dallmar's gutty guintet couldn't halt
the relentless avalanche oI Uclan baskets, and guiet, unobtrusive

Bruin guard Eddie White—you did
n't see him until he shot—swished j
through 28 points to rocket the visi- !
tors to a 91-75 triumph.
The series .split left UCLA and !
Stanford deadlocked for second i
place in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence Southern Division race behind
defending titlists from USC after the '
first weekend of play. SC dropped
California twice in Los Angeles.
The victory Friday night was hard
earned and well deserved, but the
win was only half the story. Of
equal long-run importance was the
emergence of sophomore Bill Bond
as a dangerous scoring threat.
The 6-1 blond from Long Beach
roared under the bucket early in the
first half Friday and whipped in a
back - handed lay - up hook shot
amidst a flurry of frantically wav
ing Bruin arms.

That successful shot seemed to
give Bond the confidencc he needed
and had previously lacked; mo
ments later he wafted a long push
shot toward the nets and his every
movement told you it was going in. 1
It did. Bond pumped home 19
points Friday and 12 points Satur
day, primarily with his jump shots
around the key. •
The deadly jump shots by Bon
Tomsic and Bond, Barry Brown's
rebounding and clutch shooting, and
the unbelievably alert play of little
George Sellcck were the main in
gredients of the triumph Friday.
Tomsic was practically unstop
pable as lie left his feet to fire two
pointers over and around excellent
screens. "Zeke," as his teammates
call him, had Don Bragg, usually
UCLA's soundest court man, falling
all over himself.
Brown, who has just recently
found his scoring eye, provided 11
points for the Card cause and the

majority came when they were
needed the most. He also gave the
Indians much-needed help on the
boards against the tall, rugged Bru- j
ins.

But Georgie Sellcck made the dif
ference. He more than compensated
for Russ Lawler's lackadaisical play
and ineffective shooting with excel
lent leadership and sensational pass
ing. And wherever there was a
loose ball, George was on top of it
for Stanford.
If it had not been for some ex
ceptional long-range shooting in the
first half by Morris Taft, UCLA's
latest phenom, and in the second
half by round Hon Bane, old sure
shot himself, the Westwood crew
would have been left far behind.
The zone defense employed by the
Indians after the intermission finally
stalled the Bruin scoring punch, but
Bane almost forced Stanford to
change tactics as he matched the
Indians basket for basket-
In the last, five minutes, the quick
reactioned Cards went into a delib
erate stall which forced the usually
cool Uclans into frantic, last-hope
measures which fell flat.
But Tomsic, Bond, Sellcck, Brown,
and Lawler had gone all the way
as Dallmar pulled all the stops to :
get that first, all-important win Fri
day night. Saturday the trail was
just too long.
The real clue to the loss came
near the end of the first half, when I
the Card first-stringers, despite a
three-minute rest, failed lo main
tain any type of backboard strength
and faded quickly. Two foul shots
by Tomsic cut the UCLA lead to 40-
39, but in the moments-before half
time the Bruins .suddenly widened

day night's UCLA game. Defending unsuccessfully against the shot is the Bruin's Morris Taft

behind him. These points helped the Indian cause Saturday, but weren't enough to win, as
UCLA triumphed by a 91-75 count. The Card five defeated the Bruins the previous night, though,
