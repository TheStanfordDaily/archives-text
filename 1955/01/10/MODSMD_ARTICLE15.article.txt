# Whitaker, Hilgard Will Give First ST&T Talks
## Roble Hosts Discussions 
### DICK MEISTER 
University Provost Douglas M.
Whitaker and Graduate Dean
Ernest R. Hilgard will initiate the
first meetings of the "Stanford—
Today and Tomorrow" series
with talks tonight at Roble Hall,
beginning at 6:45 in the lobby
and downstairs in the recreation
room.
Tlve student information program,
to continue through < March 2, will
feature University administration
and faculty men speaking on Stan
ford's academic problems and on
many phases of the University's
general development, according to
Dan Linhart, student director of the
series.
Acting as moderators for tonight's
meetings will be students Jim Boyle
and Otis Winters. The speakers will
talk on Stanford's academic pro
gram; in particular, how it affects
the lower division student. Director
Linhart said the speakers will hold
forth for approximately 30 minutes
when the meeting will become a
group discussion continuing for an
other .30 minutes or for as long as
students have questions to pose.
All other meetings will follow the
same plan, according to the director,
and will be held at. living groups
throughout the campus with speak
ers from all sections of administra
tive interests.
OPPORTUNITY OFFERED
"These meetings offer the student
the opportunity to meet with the
men who run the University —
President Sterling, Provost Whit
aker. Business Manager Brandin,
Dean Winbigler, and others—in an
informal living group session and
ask them questions about the plans
and policies of Stanford University
for both the present and the fu
ture " Linhart said concerning just
what "Stanford—Today and. Tomor
row" offers the student.
Although the meetings are to be
held in specified on-campus living
groups, they arc open to off-campus
students and any other interested
students. All living groups
will have the opportunity to hold
"Stanford — Today and Tomorrow"
meeetings. This gives the scries a
social, as well as informational val
ue, according to the group spokes
man.
SPECIFIC TOPICS
Some of the specific topics to be
covered under the general heading
of academics and university develop
ment arc the Stanford Research In
stitute, Ford Foundation, and the
like. Linhart emphasized that speak
ers were ehosen with an eye to get
ting men'who are familiar with all
of Stanford's problems, plans, and
achievements.
"The purpose of 'Stanford—Today
and Tomorrow'," Linhart said, "is
to enable students to learn about
Stanford, and for the speakers, in
turn, to learn what problems are
foremost in the student's minds."
Linhart believes the results will
show a general improvement in the
student's life while he is here and
make him a better alumnus when
he leaves the University.
"An alumnus can be of great value
to Stanford, when he knows and ap
preciates his University better,
something which 'Stanford—Today
and Tomorrow' provides him," the
director stressed.

The group is interested in the re
action of students to the series, and
in an effort to secure these reactions,
will have the moderator (who is
master of ceremonies) at each meet
ing ask both students and speaker
such questions as, "Did the students
hear what they wanted to?" and
"were the groups satisfied with the
general approach of 'Stanford—To
day and Tomorrow' to them this
year?"
This year is the third during
which "Stanford—Today and To
morrow" has been presented. It
came from an idea developed by
ASSU Student Manager Steve Horn
in 1953, who said then, "Since mem
bers of the faculty and administra
tion travel to alumni groups to ex
plain Stanford's programs, then they
might do the same at the University
for the students."
UNIQUE PROGRAM
In the first talk in the series, given
in April 1953, by President Wallace
Sterling, Stanford was cited as one
of the top four to ten undergradu
ate schools in the,nation. But Presi
dent Sterling warned that, "we must
hold to our laurels."
Since that first meeting, "Stan
ford—Today and Tomorrow" has be

come a regular feature of the winter
quarter here and is, according to
group spokesmen, the only such pro
gram of its kind in United States
colleges and universities.
Directors of the group, headed by
a steering committee say that "Stan
ford—Today and Tomorrow" can
only be as successful as Stanford's
students make it, through their en
thusiastic participation and con
structive criticism.
They further say that the series
is designed to give students only n
broad picture of the University
scene, and that if particular topics
are covered in only a cursory fash
ion by the speaker, the student aud
ience can invite a specialist in that
subject for a meeting later in the
quarter.
Committee spokesmen say that
they are anxious to aid any group
in arranging future meetings which
are not in the regular program. They
may be contacted at any of the
scheduled "Stanford—Today and To
morrow" meetings. More details on
the quarter's complete program will
appear later in The Daily.
STEERING COMMITTEE
Members of the group's steering
committee who arranged this year's
series are as follows:
Linhart, student director; Peter C.
Allen and James S. Triolo, adminis
tration members; D. L. Bassett and
Alfred H. Grommon, faculty mem
bers; Jim Boyle, Margaret Dalgleish,
Sally Havner, Will Oxtoby, Anne
Powell, Robert Swain. John Wiester,
student members; Pete Bing Carol
Folsom, Mary Margaret Fraser, Bob
Gable, and Otis Winters, associate
members.
Administration and faculty mem
bers will act as advisers, student
members as "workhorses" and mod
erators, and associate members as
advisers, consultants, and modera
tors.
"These members represent a good
cross-section of the Stanford campus
and will be able to assure a well
rounded program for this year's
'Stanford—Today and Tomorrow' se
ries," say group spokesmen.
