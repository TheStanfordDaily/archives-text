## U.N. to Finish Mission Today 
### 
UNITED NATIONS. N.Y., Jan.
9 (UP)—Secretary General Dag
Hammarskjold will wind up his
mission to Peiping today and
leave for the United States to
morrow to report to the United
Nations on his efforts to win
freedom for 11 American airmen
imprisoned in Red China as
"spies."
Hammarskjold was scheduled to
meet with Red Chinese Premier
Chou En-lai in a final conference in
Peiping today at 3 p.m. (midnight
WST). The session is expected to be
brief, and it was believed that the
two men would spend most of it
seeking agreement on a communique
on their talks.
D. JR.. Mannekar, Times of India
editor in Peiping on special assign
ment for the United Press, reported
that Hammarskjold spent yesterday
on a sightseeing trip through the
ancient city. He and other members
of his six-man party were taken on
a tour in Russian-built autos pro
vided by the Peiping government
and visited the imperial summer
palace on a lake west of the Red
capital. They also loured the elabo
rate tombs of the Ming Dynasty em
perors outside the walls of the old
city.
Hammarskjold and Chou had
spent a total of almost. 12V Z hours
together in their three previous con
ferences on the issue of freedom for
the air-men, who were taken prisoner
nearly two years ago after their B-29
was shot down over North Korea.
Peiping Radio said yesterday
American threats to \isc direct ac
tion to free the imprisoned airmen
were "empty blackmail."
Quoting an article in the govern
ment organ, People's Daily, the

broadcast said there was historic
precedent for direct action by the
United States against China.
"However, this overlooks the fact
that the Chiang Kai-shek group
which permitted the Americans to
rule the roost in China has been
thrown out," it said.
"The sad state of U.S. troops in the
stampede south from the Yalu River
has certainly berm forgotten also."
U.N. sources here were noncom
mittal about the chances of a suc
cessful outcome but dispatches from
Hammarskjold's native Sweden — j
and the U.N. chief executive made
the Swedish embassy his Peiping
headquarters—reported an optimis- j
tic attitude among diplomats there. I
