# Question, Please?
## 
### 
"Why do we have so many lower division re
quirements? Who decides what courses v/ill
be taught? How does a new building get plan
ned and constructed? What are the possibilities
of improving campus roads?"
Surely every Stanford student has pondered
at least one of these questions in his months and
years on the Farm.
To answer this perennial need for information
and exchange of opinion between student body
and faculty administration, the third annual
Stanford-Today and Tomorrow program will be
gin tonight at Roble with talks and discussions
in living groups. The discussions wili be ex
panded to all campus groups in the coming
weeks.
In the fall of 1952, ST&T was a dream; winter
1953 it was a plan; and spring 1953 it became an

entity, a program which has proven itself worth
while and appreciated.
Stanford—Today and Tomorrow has profited
not only the students, but faculty and adminis
tration too. Both groups have gleaned new,
valuable information, learned unsuspected
truths about each others' problems, and become
friends v/ith people who had been merely
names on class lists or impressive names with
titles.
The opportunity to meet these men and talk
with them about Stanford, from A to Z, knocks
tonight.
The Daily will publish infoimation on who
speaks when and where for each round of dis
cussions.
(See page 1 for today's story on Stanford —
