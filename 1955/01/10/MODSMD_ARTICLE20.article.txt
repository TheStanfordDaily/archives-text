# They've Never Been So Good!
## 
### 
Stanford rooters had two things to be pretty
happy about at the Pavilion Friday and Satur
day nights.
One, of course, was the hustling performance
of this year's basketballing Indians, who ran
the Bruins off their feet Friday night and almost
did it again on Saturday.
The other was the 1955 edition Stanford pep
band, down at the east end of the Pavilion.
Brand new Stanford vests, a jumping tempo that
was "pep" from the first downbeat, and real

polish in performance made this year's band a
trecit to see and hear.
"They've never been so good!" That was the
tenor of comment as the band went from "Come
Join the Band" to "Hold That Tiger" and even
made "Our Director March," everybody's high
school song, sound good.
Here's a suggestion for the cheer leaders:
Next Saturday night, after six for the varsity
and a yell for Coach Howie, let's have some
noise for that rejuvenated pep band! There'll
be a hot time in the old town tonight!
