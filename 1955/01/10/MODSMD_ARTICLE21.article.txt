# Disagreement—Leading to Truth
## 
### 
o
Living as we do in times almost paralyzed by
fear of controversy and abhorance of anything
tinged with a "pinkish" hue, the meeting held
at the Palo Alto High School auditorium Friday
night deserves more than passing notice.
There 600 persons of all shades of political
temperment gathered to hear a two-hour de
bate on the recognition of Red China. The pub
lic forum, sponsored by the Unitarian Laymen's
League, was notable for three reasons.
First, the simple fact that the debate was held.
Just a few weeks ago several universities be
came embroiled in controversy over whether
or not to allow their students to present the
"pro" side in a debate on recognition of Com
munist China. The answer given by most, in
cluding Anjiapolis and West Point, was a flat
"no"—there was too much danger of being
"misinterpreted."
Second, the fact that the forum presented an

avov/ed Red apologisi, John W. Powell, to pre
sent the case for Mao Tse-tung's government.
It is seldom that the public has a chance to
evaluate the opinions of one frankly supporting
the communist regime.
Of greatest importance, however, was the
fact that the meeting was executed in an orderly
fashion. Three widely different viewpoints
were strongly expressed, yet there were no
demonstrations, no catcalls, no boos of protest.
The 600 persons who attended left with new
ideas to explore, rather than new philosophies
to expound.
Moderator Clyde Cook closed the meeting
with the comment, "We've had disagreement
of views as we expected. And I don't think the
truth has been damaged as a result."
We might add that only through such public
forums on such controversial issues can the
real nature of "the truth" be determined.
