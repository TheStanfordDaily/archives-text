# Newsweek Runs Biz School Story
## 
### 
The Graduate School of Business
will have a feature spot in the busi
ness section of the next issue of
Newsweek.
The school, founded in 1925
through the action of Herbert Hoo
ver, will be the second in a series
Newsweek is doing on outstanding
business schools of the nation.
The author of the article cites
Dean J. Hugh Jackson's policy of
teaching '"the unity of management"
to the approximately 350 students
in the school, as opposed to overly
specialized studies.
The attention the school gives to
small business enterprises, result
ing in a high percentage of gradu
ates going into business for them
selves, is also singled out.
Among the other activities de
scribed are two summer programs â€”
the annual Stanford Business Con
ference and the Executive Develop
ment Program.
