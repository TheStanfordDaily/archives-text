# Friday: 'Iron Men' Win is Satisfying
## 
### BOB DURAND 
Sophomore Bili Bond came of age
Friday night as he and the other
four members of Stanford's "iron
men" upset the highly touted cagers
from UCLA. 61-56, in the Pavilion.
Not since 1952 had an Indian bas
ketball team been victorious over a
Bruin quintet. It was a satisfying
win for the players, for Coach How
ie Dallmar in his first Pacific Coast
Conference game, and for the fans
who packed every inch of the build
ing.
CLOSE CONTEST
It was a nip-and-tuck contest all
the way—the lead changed hands 24
times—until the final minutes when
the Cards went into a racing finish
and sewed' the game up.
Each member of the "iron five"
had his part to play, and each
played it well. Although the Bruins
couldn't contain the set shots of Ron
Tomsic, they did succeed in bottling
up the usually high-scoring Russ
Lawler and George Selleck.
However, Lawler and Selleck
turned in excellent defensive and
ball-handling jobs, while Bond and
Barry Brown took up the scoring
slack with 19 and 11 points respec
tively. Tomsic was. high man for
the contest with 21 markers.
BOND'S GOOD JOB
Besides registering his highest
varsity point total, Bond proved his
right to be on the starting five by
breaking up numerous UCLA plays
and generally doing a top-notch job
on defense.
Lanky Bruin guard Morris Taft
scored 12 points in the first half with
a masterful one-handed jump shot
against a man-to-man defense. In
the second half he met a zone set-up
and didn't hit the nets once. Willie
Naulls, who would look more at
home playing tackle for the UCLA
gridders, was top man in the scoring
column for the visitors with 13
points.
The Bruins held a slight half-time
lead, 32-30, after trimming away an
early five-pomt Card advantage. But
in the second half the. Indians' two
three zone, which forced the Bruins
to shoot from outside, smothered
Taft (who hit 6 for 8 in the first
stanza and 0 for 7 in the second) and
finally cooled off Ron Bane.
