# Saturday: Indians Tired, UCLA Hot
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
Bogged down by fatigue after
their "iron-man" stunt of the pre
vious evening, Stanford's basket
bailers fell before the fast-moving
Bruins, 91 to 75, Saturday night.
Aided by a two-m;nute breather
they received midway during the
first half, the Indian starting unit
managed to keep up with the swift
pace until the final six minutes. At
that point they were still within
hailing distance of the Bruins at 71
to 07. But then the Bruins, with
forward Johnny Moore doing most
of the damage, outscored the weary
Cards 12 to 2 over the next two
minutes, and that gave UCLA an
insurmountable 83 to 69 margin and
both coaches began to clear their
benches.
CARDS. BRL'INS HOT
Despite hot shooting by the Card
cagers, the Bruins were even hotter
Stanford bagged 25 for 45 in the
contest. But the Uclans hit almost
as well and considerably oftener as
they potted 31 for 55, for an incred
ible 53 per cent.
With George Selleck and Hon
Tomsic hitting from outside, Stan
ford grabbed a quick 12 to 6 lead in
the first five minutes before UCLA
could gain its composure.
The Bruins fought back to even
the score at 14-all and then the
teams traded baskets over the next
10 exciting minutes, a sequence that
saw the score tied seven times and
the lead change hands on five oc
casions.
UCLA took the lead for good with
five minutes to play in the half, af
ter the score was tied at 35-35, when
Eddie White, the high scorer for
both sides during the evening with
28 points, started to connect with a
deadly jump shot. White scored 10
of the next 13 UCLA markers, and
that was enough to give the Bruins
a 48 to 41 advantage at the inter
mission.
Although they never got closer
than four points during the second
20 minutes, the Cards, despite being
dead tired from Friday's victory, al
ways remained a threat.
Alter UCLA had opened up a 59-
48 margin within the first eight min
utes of the second half, the Cards
made their final bid.
They outscored the Bruins 13 to 6
over the next three minutes, and
that cut the UCLA margin to 65-61.
But after three exchanges of bas
kets left it at still four points dif
ference (71-67), the weariness final
ly took its toll and the Indians just
plain ran out of gas.
SELLECK TOPS CARDS
Selleck was the high poiitt man
for the Cards with 17 markers, while
Russ Lawler was runner-up with 16.
Following White in the Bruin
scoring column were Willie Naulls
with 15 and Don Bragg with 14.
Much of the difference between
the teams Saturday was told in the
rebounding. The tall visitors took
36 shots off the board against only
23 for the Cards. The Indians' big
man, Russ Lawler, was able to get
only three rebounds, while his op
ponent, Willie Naulls, had 12 to his
credit.

Alter UCLA had opened up a 59-
48 margin within the first eight min
utes of the second half, the Cards
made their final bid.
They outscored the Bruins 13 to 6
over the next three minutes, and
that cut the UCLA margin to 65-61.
But after three exchanges of bas
kets left it at still four points dif
ference (71-67), the weariness final
ly took its toll and the Indians just
plain ran out of gas.
SELLECK TOPS CARDS
Selleck was the high poiitt man
for the Cards with 17 markers, while
Russ Lawler was runner-up with 16.
Following White in the Bruin
scoring column were Willie Naulls
with 15 and Don Bragg with 14.
Much of the difference between
the teams Saturday was told in the
rebounding. The tall visitors took
36 shots off the board against only
23 for the Cards. The Indians' big
man, Russ Lawler, was able to get
only three rebounds, while his op
ponent, Willie Naulls, had 12 to his
credit.
Bogged down by fatigue after
their "iron-man" stunt of the pre
vious evening, Stanford's basket
bailers fell before the fast-moving
Bruins, 91 to 75, Saturday night.
Aided by a two-m;nute breather
they received midway during the
first half, the Indian starting unit
managed to keep up with the swift
pace until the final six minutes. At
that point they were still within
hailing distance of the Bruins at 71
to 07. But then the Bruins, with
forward Johnny Moore doing most
of the damage, outscored the weary
Cards 12 to 2 over the next two
minutes, and that gave UCLA an
insurmountable 83 to 69 margin and
both coaches began to clear their
benches.
CARDS. BRL'INS HOT
Despite hot shooting by the Card
cagers, the Bruins were even hotter
Stanford bagged 25 for 45 in the
contest. But the Uclans hit almost
as well and considerably oftener as
they potted 31 for 55, for an incred
ible 53 per cent.
With George Selleck and Hon
Tomsic hitting from outside, Stan
ford grabbed a quick 12 to 6 lead in
the first five minutes before UCLA
could gain its composure.
The Bruins fought back to even
the score at 14-all and then the
teams traded baskets over the next
10 exciting minutes, a sequence that
saw the score tied seven times and
the lead change hands on five oc
casions.
UCLA took the lead for good with
five minutes to play in the half, af
ter the score was tied at 35-35, when
Eddie White, the high scorer for
both sides during the evening with
28 points, started to connect with a
deadly jump shot. White scored 10
of the next 13 UCLA markers, and
that was enough to give the Bruins
a 48 to 41 advantage at the inter
mission.
Although they never got closer
than four points during the second
20 minutes, the Cards, despite being
dead tired from Friday's victory, al
ways remained a threat.
