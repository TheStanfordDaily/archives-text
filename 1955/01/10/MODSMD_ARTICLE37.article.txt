# Mural Basketball to Begin
## 8 Games Tonight In Pavilion, Gym 
### 
Stanford's intramural program
resumes this evening when 16
basketball teams begin compe
competition in the cage sport.
Mural basketball games are held
in the Pavilion and in Encina
Gym.
This year games will be held at
: four hour intervalsâ€”6:3o, 7:30. 8:30,
j and 9:30. This is more than in some
: other years. The increase was made
necessary by the scheduling of
j Stanford junior varsity games in the
| Pavilion on Monday nights. (This
j week, however, the JV's travel to
j Berkeley to face Cal.)
Mural rules call for two 20-min
i ute halves, with a five-minute half-
I time. Two time-outs are allowed
| per team per half. The clock does
j not stop on charged time-outs, how-
I ever, and no time-outs are allowed

in the last five minutes of play.
Substitution is unlimited. Over
time periods are five minutes long,
with no time-outs allowed.
The Zeta Psi's are the defending
champions in basketball. The Sig
ma Chi's were runners-up in 1954.
Basketball is the most popular of
the intramural sports. Last year 816
contestants participated on 102
teams in 17 leagues.
