A heavy grading machine was re
moved from the construction area
of the new Enema Hall late Satur
day night and maneuvered to the
front lawn of Russell House by
pranksters, according to Stanford
police.
In the process, electric poles at
the construction site were broken
off at the ground, disturbing high
power wires. The apparatus was not
seriously damaged, police reported.
