ship in America's world affairs.
The grant was announced yester

"Our primary goal in this program
is to provide additional opportuni
ties for the legal profession to serve

NEW INSTITUTIONS
"The dramatic development of
new international institutions in the
fields of political, economic, and
cultural affairs and the emergence
of new types of problems in inter

growth in new methods of destruc
tion that threaten all of society,"

even though a lawyer may never
undertake any direct business or
governmental responsibility in in
ternational affairs, he will fre
quently find himself in a strategic
position to interpret foreign affairs
in his community.

accent both political and economio
aspects of international legal trans
actions. They will deal with such
subjects as the joint use and con
trol of atomic energy, relationships
in a period of hostility short of war,
judicial co-operation among na
tions. U.S. economic and technical
assistance programs, and private
American investment in foreign
countries.

new international institutions in the
fields of political, economic, and
cultural affairs and the emergence
of new types of problems in inter
national trade, finance, and invest
ment have been paralleled by
growth in new methods of destruc
tion that threaten all of society,"
Dean Spaeth commented.
Dean Spaeth also pointed out that
even though a lawyer may never
undertake any direct business or
governmental responsibility in in
ternational affairs, he will fre
quently find himself in a strategic
position to interpret foreign affairs
in his community.
The studies now projected will
accent both political and economio
aspects of international legal trans
actions. They will deal with such
subjects as the joint use and con
trol of atomic energy, relationships
in a period of hostility short of war,
judicial co-operation among na
tions. U.S. economic and technical
assistance programs, and private
American investment in foreign
countries.
