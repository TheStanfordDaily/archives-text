# Ike to Propose Lower Tariffs

### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (UP) â€”
President Eisenhower is expected to
touch off the first big legislative fight
of the new Congress tomorrow when
he asks the lawmakers to approve a
foreign trade program with broad
tariff-cutting powers.
The President will send Congress
a special message requesting a
three-year renewal of the reciprocal
trade program, along with authority
to cut tariffs as much as 15 per cent
over the three years. It is sched
uled to be the first major legislation
before the House.
Incoming chairman Jere Cooper
(D., Tenn.) said his House Ways
and Means Committee will start
hearings as soon as Ihc croup is or
ganized. Since the trade program is
a revenue measure, the Senate will
not. take it up until* after the House
has acted.
Mr. Eisenhower said in his State
of the Union message last week that
"we must gradually reduce certain
tariff obstacles to trade" to help free
nations strengthen their economies.
Likewise, he said, other nations
hould lower their tariffs in the in
terests of the overall good.
The President meets with Repub
lican Congressional leaders at the
White House tomorrow morning and
undoubtedly will discuss the trade
program which will be sent to Con
gress at noon.
Most. Democrats support the Pres
ident's request since their party was
the founder of reciprocal trade. But
Republicans arc badly split over the
issue.
