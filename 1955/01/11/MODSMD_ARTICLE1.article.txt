# Voters' Group Fights VA Site
## 
### RUSS WILKS Associate Editor, The Daily 
A Santa Cruz County Voters' Committee has publicly come out
against the choice of Stanford as the'site for the new Veterans'
Administration hospital.
Stanford and the VA agreed on the site for the 1,000-bed hos
pial in December.
The committee is interested in securing a Congressional inves-

titration of the VA.
The call for the investigation is
based on two factors. One is that
the committee maintains that there
is an urgent need for putting the
neuropsychiatric hospital in a more
desirable location than teh Stan
ford location. They maintain that
Stanford is in a major bomb area.
The second point is the advisabil
ity of considering other sites. The
committee cites for example the
ofTer of 100 acres of land (valued at
$100,000) which was offered as a gift
to the VA. This site is located near
Felton, within a short distance from
where the Disabled American Vet
erans has been rehabilitating vet
eran mental patients.
In opposing the Stanford site, Ed
Muegge Jr., of the committee, asks:
1. Who will shoulder the respon
sibility for placing the VA hospital
at the Stanford site which is within
the bomb area?
2. Who will shoulder the respon
sibility for the reckless squandering
of the tax dollar in the refusal of the
VA to even coxitact the one who do
nated the 100-acre Felton gift site?
A University spokesman said he
didn't believe the committee "would
get to first base" with their appeal.
He pointed out that when the VA
was searching for a spot, one of the
big considerations wag in having it
near a teaching hospital. When the
VA found out that Stanford would
eventually move its entire medical
program from San Francisco to the
campus, it was eager to establish its
hospital on Stanford land.
The action is the result of a con
ference with the giver of the 100-
acre Felton gift site, the Santa Cruz
Chamber of Commerce, the Santa
Cruz County Board of Supervisors,
and Muegge, commander of Chap
ter 52, Disabled American Veterans.
Muegge has been organizing a
pressure campaign. Advertisements
have been running in local papers
which requqest the voters to write
to Washington, D.C., of their dis
approval of the Stanford site.
