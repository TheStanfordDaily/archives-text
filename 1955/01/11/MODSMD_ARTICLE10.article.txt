# SEEKS HIGH TRADE LEVEL
## President Asks Congress To Reduce Tariffs, Taxes 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 (UP) â€”President Eisenhower issued his
first major challenge to the Democratic-controlled 84th Congress
today by asking it to reduce U.S. tariffs and cut taxes on business
profits abroad.
Declaring that America's "enlightened self-interest" demands a

"high leVel" of trade to strengthen
the free world against Communism,
the President also urged continued
technical aid to underdeveloped na
tions, more U.S. tourist travel, and
simpler customs rules.
Democratic and Republican lead
ers generally hailed the program
and Democrats put it at the top of
their schedule for early House ac
tion. But some of the proposals will
run into powerful opposition, chiefly
from the "protectionist" ,wing of the
GOP.
RENEWED APPEAL
The President renewed his appeal
for a three-year extension of the
reciprocal trade law with authority
to cut tariffs up to 15 per cent dur
ing the period.
Chief new feature in the program
was a request for Congress to cut
incomc on foreign profits of
American corporations from 52 to 38
per cent. Collection of the tax would
be deferred until the profits could
be taken out of the foreign country.
House Speaker Sam Rayburn of
Texas said he would like to see a
"permanent" reciprocal trade law
rather than the three-year extension
the President recommended. The
present law, originally fostered by
Democrats, expires June 12.
THREE-YEAR EXTENSION
The President sought a three-year
extension with new tariff - cutting
powers last year but settled for a
simple one-year extension in the
face of stiff GOP opposition. Demo
crats chided Mr. Eisenhower during
the recent election campaign for not
insisting on his own program.
Rayburn said the House Ways and
Means Committee will put the new
trade program at the top of its work
list. Committee chairman Jere Coo
per (D., Tenn.) already has intro
duced legislation to carry out some
of the chief executive's major rec
ommendations.
Representative Charles A. Hal
leck (Ind.), Assistant House GOP
Leader, predicted a "good majority"
of Republicans will back the pro
gram. "There will, of course, be dif
ferences of opinion but I think it
will be enacted substantially as rec
ommended," he said.
The President, who apparently had
his "protectionist" opposition in
mind, called his program "moderate,
gradual, and reciprocal." He said
"radical or sudden" tariff cuts would
not help the United States.
