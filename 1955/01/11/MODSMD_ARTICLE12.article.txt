UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., lan.
10 (UP) —Secretary-General Dag
Hammarskjold concluded his
mission to Peiping today, care
fully keeping secret the results
of his efforts to gain freedom for
11 American airmen jailed by
Red China as "spies."
D. R. Mankckar, Times of India
editor in Peiping on special assign
ment from the United Press, report
ed the final communique on the
conferences "clearly indicated" the
Chinese had set forth certain con
ditions for release of the Americans.
Mankckar quoted the communi
que in saying Hamamrskjold was
leaving with "just the hope" to
"continue the contact established in
these meetings."
If Hammarskjold had hoped to
win immediate release of the 11,
then in that sense his mission had
failed, Mankekar said.
FINAL MEETING
The United Nations chief execu
tive held his fourth and final meet
ing — an 80-minutc session — with
Communist Chinese Premier Chou
En-lai at 4 p.m. (midnight PST) to
day.
He was scheduled to leave Pei
ping's ancient walled city at 7 a.m.
(3 p.m. PST) in a Chinese govern
ment plane, starting the 12,500-mile
journey home by way of Canton,
Hong Kong, Tokyo, and San Fran
cisco. He is due in Tokyo Wednes
day.
A joint communique, guardedly
worded, was issued by Hammar
skjold and Chou at the end of to
day's meeting. It noted that the
conversations had made reference
"to questions pertinent to the relax
ation of world tension." It expressed
the feeling of the two leaders that
their talks had been "useful" and a
hope for continuance of "the contact
established in these meetings."
COUNTER-PROPOSAL
But the communique said nothing
of Hammarskjold's mission to seek
freedom for the 11 American fliers
and an estimated 2,850 other U.N.
command personnel still illegally
detained by Red China as Korean
war prisoners.
U.N. observers here, noting the
communique's reference to discus
sion of questions pertinent to relax
ation of world tension and to the
hope of continuing the contact be
tween the world organization and
the Peiping government, speculated
that Hammarskjold was en route
home with a counter-proposal from
the Red Chinese.
