### DICK MEISTER 
Stressing that Stanford gives its students more opportunity for
individual study than most of the nation's major universities,
Douglas M. Whitaker, University Provost, last night gave the
opening talk in this year's "Stanford—Today and Tomorrow"
series.
Speaking in the lobby at Roble Hall, before a large group of

freshman women, Whitaker said - *
that for every faculty member at I
Stanford there are approximately 11 j
students. This, said the Provost,
compares favorably with other
American universities, where the
faculty-student ratio may reach as
high a figure as one to 18.
Whitaker also said that Stanford
is in better financial condition than
most private educational institutions
and that the University's assets now
total over $50 million. Stanford's
physical plant comprises the largest
campus in the United States, cover
ing over 16 square miles.
DEVELOPMENT NECESSAKY
A large part of this area is being
developed for income, which is a
necessity for running any private
university, the speaker pointed out,
adding that six square miles are
being held out for educational train
ing facilities. This area still makes
Stanford the largest campus in the
nation.
In regard to the question of in
creased enrollments, Whitaker said
j that despite the great increase in
the number of American youths at
tending college (the present figure
should double by 1963), Stanford
has no plans to expand enrollment.
"We (the Stanford administra
tion) feel that we are now large
enough for a good academic life and
plan no increase in numbers," the
Provost stated.
Although no plans are being
formed for a larger total number
of students, Whitaker said that as
soon as new women's residences
can be built then, more women will
|be accommodated at, Stanford. He
! also pointed out that Stanford's
j general plan of being an entirely
! residential University will be even
! more completely real i7. e d when
; Stanford Village is vacated two
| years from now.
STUDENT DIVISION'S
The speaker emphasized the bal
ance in Stanford's student divisions,
with one-third of the students in
the lower division, and one-third
each in the upper and graduate di
visions. This gives the University a
more "collegiate" program than most
leading United States colleges. For
instance, Whitaker compared Stan- j
ford's 33 per cent graduate students |
; with Columbia Univer: ity's 75 to 80 J
! per cent, the University of Chicago's I
! 70 per ccnt, and Harvard's 60 or so i
per cent.

As to Stanford's ranking among
the nation's universities in the gen
eral education field, the talk empha
sized that the University ranks with
the top schools in the nation, such
as Princeton.
In the graduate research field,
some of Stanford's departments am
considered among the country's top
two or three, with electrical engi
neering, biology, statistics, physics,
psychology, economics, geology, law,
and medicine ranked highest.
MEDICAL SCHOOL
Whitaker calls the medical school
the leading one west of the Missis
sippi and points out that in the near
future, when the school is moved
onto campus from its present site in
San Francisco, an even greater op
portunity will exist for Stanford's
medical students. Here they will bn
able to enjoy the advantage of the
University's campus atmosphere and
general training in addition to their
specialized training in the medical
field, he said.
With the population growth to the
south of the University, an increas
ing-opportunity will be open for
medical training as well as for study
in other fields, the speaker said.
Although Stanford is acknowl
edged as one of the nation's top uni
versities, it is not content to "rest
on its laurels" and is presently en
gaged in a study on undergraduate
curriculum in order to see in what
ways the program can be improved.
Plans call for students themselvc . to
help in the study, since, it is di
rectly concerned with them and
their opportunities at Stanford.
