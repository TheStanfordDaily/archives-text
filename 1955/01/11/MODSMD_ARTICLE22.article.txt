# A 						Long-standing Need

### 
Like many other college students across the
country, we were puzzled to read yesterday
of the intention of a nation-wide group of
church women to oppose both the military
manpower revisions proposed by President
Eisenhower in his recent State of the Union
message, and the alternative measures offered
by Democratic Senator Richard B. Russell,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Com
mittee.
In essence, both of the proposals provide
for a few months of training while on active
duty for all physically-fit men af draft age,
followed by several years of reserve duty.
Although the exact contents of the Eisen
hower proposal will not be revealed until the
President sends details of his revised program
to Congress tomorrow, it is expected to differ
but slightly from the Russell-authored bill. En
dorsed by the American Legion and other vet
erans' organizations, the Russell proposal of
military manpower revisions provides for ap
proximately four months of compulsory mili
tary training, followed by a minimum five
year reserve obligation, which would be in
creased to eight years, "if the individual failed
to participate actively in reserve training."

There is little doubt—especially in the minds
of college men of draft age—that the present
Selective Service set-up is filled with glaring
shortcomings, and that the adoption of a new
program, making better use of our military
manpower, would be an outstanding achieve
ment of the newly-seated 84th Congress.
It is difficult to see how any group could
actually prefer the present Selective Service
system which each year tears thousands of
draft-age men from their families, their jobs,
and their education for at least two years of
military training. At the same time, however,
we realize that, as President Eisenhower point
ed out in announcing his program, we have no
present alternative but to maintain powerful
military forces—"forces designed to strike
back with destructive power in response to
any attack."
Much thought and study has obviously gone
into the preparation of both the Eisenhower
and the Russell proposals. We hope that the
members of the new Congress will recognize
the long-standing need for some type of re
vision in the present military manpower pro
gram, and will give sincere consideration to
the basic changes which have been suggested.
