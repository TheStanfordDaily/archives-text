# BULL SESSION
## 
### DICK MEISTER 
Governor Goodwin J. Ki#ght has asked the state
legislature to raise the already sky-high tax on that
student staple, cigarettes. Knight proposes such a
thing and still has the audacity to go on record as
favoring higher education. Does the good governor
realize the vast horde of students who could never,
never get through the rigors of the average day's
studies without their daily nicotine boost?
Why here at Stanford alone the dirty habit claims
uncountable victims; multiply these local fiends by
the number of colleges and universities in the nation
and you come up with billions, no, trillions of hard
smoking, over-taxed students.
Surely Goodie realizes this and so he must have
vile and evil ulterior motives behind his unnatural
desire to tax cigarettes right out ot the fingers of
those poor, starving intellectuals, the college stu
dents, the hopes of the future, you and me.
The Daily has done extensive research and has
reached some conclusions concerning the reasons be
hind the dastardly move. (This is real classified type
stuff, so those of you who just can't keep a secret
l/etter wander over to the sport page.)
Light up a smoke, read the shocking truth, and re
member you read it in The Daily. Our exclusive con
clusions (why not exclusive, who else could reach
them?) are as follows:
1. The state is starting a "Give the colleges back
to the money boys—who else could afford those high
pricqd coffin nails" crusade. If this is the case then
the time is now at hand; arise you downtrodden mass
of poor, but cigarette-needy students and beat down
the dirty capitalist dogs who are influencing the gov
ernor; (Speech courtesy of K. Marx, soap box by
Proctor & Gable).
2. (Attention Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (R-

Wis.).) This might be a commie plot to unite students
against their government. My old psych prof once
said that the primary human needs are common to all
and so if many were deprived of one of these needs
they would certainly unite as a group to stamp out
whatever is depriving them of this need. And what
is a greater human need than that crawling, over
powering craving for a smoke?
.'3. The armed services may be behind it all, making
it a federal case (a Facist plot, no doubt). The
services need more recruits, cigarettes are tax-free
in service, therefore, mass enlistments of the cream
of America's youth, California's students. Just pic
ture an army manned by Stanford's smoke-hungry
intellectuals . . . absolutely unbeatable. Don't think
the federal government has overlooked this possi
bility.
4. It can also be supposed that Goodie is in cahoots
with those in the medical profession who have be
come jealous of doctors endorsing smokes and, seeing
the futility of their campaign hoping to show that
cigarettes are a cause of cancer, have enlisted the
aid of the politicos in a new method of trying to stop
endorsements.
There you have the horrible truth. No plan of ac
tion is offered, that's up to the schemers among our
readers.
Note: Commencing tomorrow The Daily will be
selling cigarettes at a cost a wee bit higher than
present, pre-tax rates, but much lower than Knight's
proposed fee. Well! Of course we're doing this as a
public service. .
If you can't beat 'em, hoard 'em.
And could we use the dough.

1. The state is starting a "Give the colleges back
to the money boys—who else could afford those high
pricqd coffin nails" crusade. If this is the case then
the time is now at hand; arise you downtrodden mass
of poor, but cigarette-needy students and beat down
the dirty capitalist dogs who are influencing the gov
ernor; (Speech courtesy of K. Marx, soap box by
Proctor & Gable).
2. (Attention Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (R-

Wis.).) This might be a commie plot to unite students
against their government. My old psych prof once
said that the primary human needs are common to all
and so if many were deprived of one of these needs
they would certainly unite as a group to stamp out
whatever is depriving them of this need. And what
is a greater human need than that crawling, over
powering craving for a smoke?
.'3. The armed services may be behind it all, making
it a federal case (a Facist plot, no doubt). The
services need more recruits, cigarettes are tax-free
in service, therefore, mass enlistments of the cream
of America's youth, California's students. Just pic
ture an army manned by Stanford's smoke-hungry
intellectuals . . . absolutely unbeatable. Don't think
the federal government has overlooked this possi
bility.
4. It can also be supposed that Goodie is in cahoots
with those in the medical profession who have be
come jealous of doctors endorsing smokes and, seeing
the futility of their campaign hoping to show that
cigarettes are a cause of cancer, have enlisted the
aid of the politicos in a new method of trying to stop
endorsements.
There you have the horrible truth. No plan of ac
tion is offered, that's up to the schemers among our
readers.
Note: Commencing tomorrow The Daily will be
selling cigarettes at a cost a wee bit higher than
present, pre-tax rates, but much lower than Knight's
proposed fee. Well! Of course we're doing this as a
public service. .
If you can't beat 'em, hoard 'em.
And could we use the dough.
(What we think of the proposed beer tax is 1 un
printable).
Governor Goodwin J. Ki#ght has asked the state
legislature to raise the already sky-high tax on that
student staple, cigarettes. Knight proposes such a
thing and still has the audacity to go on record as
favoring higher education. Does the good governor
realize the vast horde of students who could never,
never get through the rigors of the average day's
studies without their daily nicotine boost?
Why here at Stanford alone the dirty habit claims
uncountable victims; multiply these local fiends by
the number of colleges and universities in the nation
and you come up with billions, no, trillions of hard
smoking, over-taxed students.
Surely Goodie realizes this and so he must have
vile and evil ulterior motives behind his unnatural
desire to tax cigarettes right out ot the fingers of
those poor, starving intellectuals, the college stu
dents, the hopes of the future, you and me.
The Daily has done extensive research and has
reached some conclusions concerning the reasons be
hind the dastardly move. (This is real classified type
stuff, so those of you who just can't keep a secret
l/etter wander over to the sport page.)
