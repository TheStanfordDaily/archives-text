# Stanford's First Yearbook Put Out by Staff of Nine
## Title Was Chosen For 'Vigor. Snap' 
### JULIE ANNE HARRIS 
Why is the Stanford year
book called the Quad?
When the first staff in 1894
labored to name the yearbook,
they hit upon "The Quad" be
cause of the "vigor and snap"
of the title.
*
They further explained that it was
u name peculiar to this institution,
named for the quadrangle, nucleus
of student life and sentiment.
Students had enviously scanned
other colleges' yearbooks and done
much talking - about one of their
own, during the first years of Stan
ford history. Not until the third
year, 1894, however, was a large
enough staff assembled to put out
the first slim white 250-page vol
ume.
In those early days the yearbook
was put out entirely by juniors, the
first staff numbering a scant nine.
Hence the early yearbooks were
dated by the class of the staff. For
instance, the yearbook published in
1898 was dated 1899, the class year
of the staff of juniors.
But in 1926 the staff was expanded
to include other classes. So the an
nual of that year was date 1926, just
as had been the one published in
1925, dated by the old system. This
accounts for the fact that most col
lections of Quads have two 1926
annuals.
JOSH" SECTIONS
For the first decade Quads were
heavily spiced with "josh" sections,
poetry, short stories, and art. By the
lUth volume the staff decided that it
need no longer strive for such
''originality" but yield literary func
tions to the other publications,
which were steadily growing
stronger. The Quad then began to
restrict itself gradually to a record
ing function.
For a brief period, early in this
century, a batch of green Quads-ap
peared which later editors were un
able to explain. Later editors set
tled upon red—a tradition that was
broken in 1919 when a slender vol
ume appeared in black, commemo
rating Stanford's honored war dead.
At the time it was hoped that such
a color need never again appear.
And indeed it remains the only
black Quad, though colors and
styles have continued to change.
RECORD UNBROKEN
War, however, has had other ef
fects on the yearbook. The under
manned 1945 staff couldn't manage
to distribute the book until well into
October. Proud they were, though,
that they finally got it out for they
sustained the Quad record of un
broken publication.
From its early loose organization,
the Quad switched in 1921 to thor
ough-going departmentalization. At
that time it boasted 20 journalists,
most of whom were also associated

with the "Daily Palo Alto," prede
cessor to The Daily.
Nowadays staffs number close to
200. Rivalry having sprung up
among the publications, there is lit
tle of staffs.
While the staffs have been in
creasing, the books themselves have
over the years taken on a middle
aged spread, now fatter by 200 pages
than the first edition, with much
larger pages as well.
"A JUST DEBT"
Then, as now, editors had trouble
with recalcitrant non-buyers of the
Quad, but then they were less hesi
tant to express dissatisfaction.
Floyd McElroy, editor '21, charac
terized them as "those s pathological
persons who, through abysmal igno
rance or extreme parsimony, are
trying to avoid a just debt."
Present sales promotions have
adopted more sophisticated meth
ods. This year, for the first time,
order blanks were distributed at
registration. Stamped envelopes
were sent to students and a staff
member humorously remarked that
"We did everything for them but
sign their names to the checks!"
Such all-out promotion has been
adopted because of the lament often
expressed to the staff that "I sure
wish I had bought a Quad!" The
yearbook remains essentially a serv
ice, father than a profit-making, or
ganization.
Staffers of the 61st volume, now
in progress, are working with the
technical developments of later
years, such as cut-out pages and
color. But they seem to have adopt
ed unconsciously the unofficial mot
to of the Quad and every other
such publication expressed since the
earliest issues: '"Each year better
than the last!"

Such all-out promotion has been

color. But they seem to have adopt

such publication expressed since the
earliest issues: '"Each year better

Why is the Stanford year
book called the Quad?
When the first staff in 1894
labored to name the yearbook,
they hit upon "The Quad" be
cause of the "vigor and snap"
of the title.
*
They further explained that it was
u name peculiar to this institution,
named for the quadrangle, nucleus
of student life and sentiment.
Students had enviously scanned
other colleges' yearbooks and done
much talking - about one of their
own, during the first years of Stan
ford history. Not until the third
year, 1894, however, was a large
enough staff assembled to put out
the first slim white 250-page vol
ume.
In those early days the yearbook
was put out entirely by juniors, the
first staff numbering a scant nine.
Hence the early yearbooks were
dated by the class of the staff. For
instance, the yearbook published in
1898 was dated 1899, the class year
of the staff of juniors.
But in 1926 the staff was expanded
to include other classes. So the an
nual of that year was date 1926, just
as had been the one published in
1925, dated by the old system. This
accounts for the fact that most col
lections of Quads have two 1926
annuals.
JOSH" SECTIONS
For the first decade Quads were
heavily spiced with "josh" sections,
poetry, short stories, and art. By the
lUth volume the staff decided that it
need no longer strive for such
''originality" but yield literary func
tions to the other publications,
which were steadily growing
stronger. The Quad then began to
restrict itself gradually to a record
ing function.
For a brief period, early in this
century, a batch of green Quads-ap
peared which later editors were un
able to explain. Later editors set
tled upon red—a tradition that was
broken in 1919 when a slender vol
ume appeared in black, commemo
rating Stanford's honored war dead.
At the time it was hoped that such
a color need never again appear.
And indeed it remains the only
black Quad, though colors and
styles have continued to change.
RECORD UNBROKEN
War, however, has had other ef
fects on the yearbook. The under
manned 1945 staff couldn't manage
to distribute the book until well into
October. Proud they were, though,
that they finally got it out for they
sustained the Quad record of un
broken publication.
From its early loose organization,
the Quad switched in 1921 to thor
ough-going departmentalization. At
that time it boasted 20 journalists,
most of whom were also associated

with the "Daily Palo Alto," prede
cessor to The Daily.
Nowadays staffs number close to
200. Rivalry having sprung up
among the publications, there is lit
tle of staffs.
While the staffs have been in
creasing, the books themselves have
over the years taken on a middle
aged spread, now fatter by 200 pages
than the first edition, with much
larger pages as well.
"A JUST DEBT"
Then, as now, editors had trouble
with recalcitrant non-buyers of the
Quad, but then they were less hesi
tant to express dissatisfaction.

Why is the Stanford year
book called the Quad?
When the first staff in 1894
labored to name the yearbook,
they hit upon "The Quad" be
cause of the "vigor and snap"
of the title.
*
They further explained that it was
u name peculiar to this institution,
named for the quadrangle, nucleus
of student life and sentiment.
Students had enviously scanned
other colleges' yearbooks and done
much talking - about one of their
own, during the first years of Stan
ford history. Not until the third
year, 1894, however, was a large
enough staff assembled to put out
the first slim white 250-page vol
ume.
In those early days the yearbook
was put out entirely by juniors, the
first staff numbering a scant nine.
Hence the early yearbooks were
dated by the class of the staff. For
instance, the yearbook published in
1898 was dated 1899, the class year
of the staff of juniors.
But in 1926 the staff was expanded
to include other classes. So the an
nual of that year was date 1926, just
as had been the one published in
1925, dated by the old system. This
accounts for the fact that most col
lections of Quads have two 1926
annuals.
JOSH" SECTIONS
For the first decade Quads were
heavily spiced with "josh" sections,
poetry, short stories, and art. By the
lUth volume the staff decided that it
need no longer strive for such
''originality" but yield literary func
tions to the other publications,
which were steadily growing
stronger. The Quad then began to
restrict itself gradually to a record
ing function.
For a brief period, early in this
century, a batch of green Quads-ap
peared which later editors were un
able to explain. Later editors set
tled upon red—a tradition that was
broken in 1919 when a slender vol
ume appeared in black, commemo
rating Stanford's honored war dead.
At the time it was hoped that such
a color need never again appear.
And indeed it remains the only
black Quad, though colors and
styles have continued to change.
