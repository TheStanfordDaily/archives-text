ON THE DECK—Stanford and UCLA basketball players dive to
the Pavilion floor in a sprawling maze of arms and legs in an
attempt to gain possession of a free ball in the second half of
Friday's game. Bruin Don Bragg (52) is crashing down on Card
Ron Tomsic as Uclan Morris Taft and Indian George Selleck

join the struggle, Stanford's Russ Lawler is in the background.
"The Indians won the Friday tilt, 61-55, but bowed to the Bruins
Saturday, 91-75. This weekend the Tribe meet's last-place Cal
at Berkeley Friday night and then hosts the Bears Saturday in
the Pavilion. —Daily photo by Frank Huntress
