## 
### 
A powerful UCLA ski team
walked off with top honors in the
Northern California Intercollegiate
Invitational ski meet last weekend,
handily waxing the Stanford slat
men in the process.
Racing at Sugar Bowl against six
other collegiate teams, the Farm
skiers could do no better than a
sixth place, right behind the Uni
versity of Nevada. Nevada and
Stanford have finished in the top
two places in most of the races dur
ing the past two seasons.
Stanford team captain Fritz Hoe
demaker blamed the defeat on in
juries and lack of training. Co-cap
tain Mackey Wirth, one of the
team's top-point men, injured him
self in the downhill the first day
and was unable to compete in the
jumping and cross-country, his two
best events.
"We'll have everyone in better
shape for the next meet," Hoede
maker said, and added that he ex
pects the team to do much better in
the Tresidder Memorial meet. Stan
ford's traditional big ski event.
Of the Stanford team, sophomore
Bart Hooley turned in the best per
formance in the two-day series of
races, placing fifth in the slalom,
with a combined time of 74.7 sec
onds, 12th in the cross-country, and
21st in the jumping.
The team will not compete in the
Edelweiss intercollegiate meet next
weekend, but will go into intensive
training at Squaw Valley.
