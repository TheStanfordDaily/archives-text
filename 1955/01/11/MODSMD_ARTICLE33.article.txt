## 
### BILL RHOADES 
Two lopsided games were the
highlights last night as the 1955
intramural basketball schedule
opened. Last year's champions. El
Tigre I, slaughtered El Cuadro. 48-
5, in the Pavilion. At the same time,
Los Arcos was manhandling El Ti
gre 11, 53-10, in the Encina gym.
El Tigre I wasted no time in scor
ing seven points before Virgil
Craine finally scored on a set shot
for Cuadro. Craine added one more
point to Cuadro's total a little later,
but Tigre was scoring 15 points to
lead at the half, 22-3.
The second half was just more of
the same with Dan Simundson tak
ing the tipoff and going right in for a
setup. Tigre made five of its first six
shots in the second half while limit
ing Cuadro to only two shots in five
minutes. Tigre scored 26 points in
the second half against Cuadro's
two.
El Tigre hit a red hot 51 per cent
of their field goal attempts, con
necting on 23 of 45 shots. Cuadro on
the other hand was cold, hitting
only two of 25 for an 8 per cent rec
ord.
Basye and Simundson each had 11
to pace the Tigre attack. They were
followed closely by Wondelich with
10. Smid with two and Crane with
three accounted for all of El Cua
dro's scoring.
The Los Arcos contest was the
same story with only slight differ
ences. The Arcosians left no doubt
that they were going to win as they
took the lead at the start and never
relinquished it.
They led at the half, 24-9, and
held Tigre II to only one point in
the second half to win going away.
Fred Conover was high for Los Ar
cos with 17, followed by Dud
Herschbach and Bob Rhodes with
10.
