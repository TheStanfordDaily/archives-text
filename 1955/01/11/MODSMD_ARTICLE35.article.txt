# HIGH SCHOOLS BEATEN
## Papoose Hoopsters Score Two Weekend Victories 
### LARRY JENSEN 
The Stanford frosh handily whipped their weekend high school
competition, crushing the Salinas Cowboys Friday night, 80-42,
and easily defeating a tall Lowell High squad Saturday night,
59-55
With Jay Jackson and Clint Waring leading the way, the

Papooses built up a 20-10 first
quarter lead over Salinas and estab
lished such complete game control
that frosh coach Dick Clegg began
pouring in the reserves early in the
second quarter.
Second-stringers Harding Roe and
Lee Leonard boosted the irosh to a
35-20 half-time bulge.
The Papooses really turned on the
heat in the third quarter, rolling to
a 61-30 lead and then coasting as
Clegg cleared the bench.
Salinas could not get inside the
tight frosh man - for - man defense
and had little success in firing away
from the outside. The Cowboys were
seldom able to snatch a rebound
away from the taller and more rug
ged Papooses.
Jim Langley of Salinas took scor
ing honors for the game with 12
points. Teammates Bob Howard and
Norm Steinbach each chipped in
with 10. Gary Van Galder and Jay
Jackson led the frosh with 10 points
each.
Lowell, showing exceptional size
and polish for a high school team,
also had trouble getting clear shots
against the leech - like frosh de
fense. Deadly shooting in the early
going by Tom Meschery, Clarence
Glider, and A 1 Mock kept Lowell
in the game, but these three could
not match the well-balanced scor
ing of the frosh who walked off the
floor at half-time holding a 32-25
lead.
The Papooses broke the game
wide open in the third period with
a blistering fast break spearheaded

by Dean Thomas, Jackson, and Van
Galder. At quarter's end the frosh
moved out to an overwhelming 50-
33 lead.
Lowell came on with a rush in
the last quarter to close up the
final score. Substitute guard Larry
Dashiell hit five jump shots to spark
the Lowell rally.
