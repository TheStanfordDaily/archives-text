# Cal Blues Whack Brave Five, 86-61
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
The California Blues, bolstered by several second-siring var
sity players, swept to a convincing 86-61 court victory over an
undermanned Brave live at Berkeley yesterday.
The story of the game can be told by a look at the figures.
While the tall, fast-breaking home team was hitting a phenome-

nal 61 per cent of their field goals'
during the second half, Stanford
could connect for only 31 per cent.
At the free throw line the visitors
could find the range only 57 per cent
of the time while Cal hit 74 per cent
of their gift tosses.
Stanford managed to make a game
out of it during the first half and
was only trailing by a respectable
32 to 27 margin at half-time. Bill
Flanders kept the game close with
his consistent close-range shots and
ball hawking on defense. Ben Heirs
with nine points was the only other
notable scorer for Stanford during
the opening stanza.
After the two squads returned
following the intermission, it was
evident that the men were being
separated from the boys. Before
Stanford could hit the nets once,
Tamm, Raugest, Griffen, and Ster
ling all added two-pointers for the
Blues and mounted the score to 42-
27.
Soon Mayne and Bertelsman got
into the act for the winners, and
Cal was leading. 58 to 38. From here
on in it was just a matter of whether
Stanford could hold its more expe
rienced foes to a decent score.

♦
One of the big reasons for Cal's
! success was the Bears' dominance ol
both backboards. With Raugest (0-
| 3), Hagler (6-8), Brown (6-5), and
| Sterling (6-4) taking turns at grab
j bing rebounds, it was only with
j difficulty that the Braves could get
! their hands on the ball.
Hagler, who has played many var
| sity games for the Bears, was deadly
1 with his hooks and tip-ins. Sterling
J contributed 18 points to the cause,
high for both squads. Other high
| scorers for the Blues were Raugest
1 with 12 and Tamm with 15 points,
j Bill Flanders led the Brave team
with 14 points, followed by Bob
Milton, who tallied five field goals
for his 10 points in the second half.
The Braves, in playing only their
third game of the season, were at a
definite disadvantage experience
wise against the smooth - working
Blues. California had been victors
in six of their eight games.

of their gift tosses.
Stanford managed to make a game
out of it during the first half and
was only trailing by a respectable
32 to 27 margin at half-time. Bill
Flanders kept the game close with
his consistent close-range shots and
ball hawking on defense. Ben Heirs
with nine points was the only other
notable scorer for Stanford during
the opening stanza.
After the two squads returned
following the intermission, it was
evident that the men were being
separated from the boys. Before
Stanford could hit the nets once,
Tamm, Raugest, Griffen, and Ster
ling all added two-pointers for the
Blues and mounted the score to 42-
27.
Soon Mayne and Bertelsman got
into the act for the winners, and
Cal was leading. 58 to 38. From here
on in it was just a matter of whether
Stanford could hold its more expe
rienced foes to a decent score.

One of the big reasons for Cal's
! success was the Bears' dominance ol
both backboards. With Raugest (0-
| 3), Hagler (6-8), Brown (6-5), and
| Sterling (6-4) taking turns at grab
j bing rebounds, it was only with
j difficulty that the Braves could get
! their hands on the ball.
Hagler, who has played many var
| sity games for the Bears, was deadly
1 with his hooks and tip-ins. Sterling
J contributed 18 points to the cause,
high for both squads. Other high
| scorers for the Blues were Raugest
1 with 12 and Tamm with 15 points,
j Bill Flanders led the Brave team
with 14 points, followed by Bob
Milton, who tallied five field goals
for his 10 points in the second half.
The Braves, in playing only their
third game of the season, were at a
definite disadvantage experience
wise against the smooth - working
Blues. California had been victors
in six of their eight games.
The California Blues, bolstered by several second-siring var
sity players, swept to a convincing 86-61 court victory over an
undermanned Brave live at Berkeley yesterday.
The story of the game can be told by a look at the figures.
While the tall, fast-breaking home team was hitting a phenome-

nal 61 per cent of their field goals'
during the second half, Stanford
could connect for only 31 per cent.
At the free throw line the visitors
could find the range only 57 per cent
of the time while Cal hit 74 per cent
of their gift tosses.
