# Is career stability important to you?

### 
I lien flic chart below will be of interest.
It shows that 46% ol Boeing's engineers
have been with this company lor live
or more years; 25% have been here 10
or more years, and 6% for 1 5 years.

One reason for this stability is that
Hoeing has grown steadily for 38 years,
providing plenty of room lor advance
ment. Another reason is the highly in
teresting type of work at Hoeing, such
as designing and building America's first
jet transport and the revolutionary H 17

and IV52 jet bombers, as well as,work
on pi lot less aircraft, supersonic flight
and research in nuclear-powered aircraft.
Still another reason is this: Boeing
always has put dominant emphasis on
engineering development. Pioneering in
this field has meant that Boeing con
stantly has increased its engineering stall
in relation to total employees, fifteen
years ago, one out of 16 employees was
in engineering. Five years ago the pro
portion of engineers had been raised
to one in ten and today it has climbed
to one in seven.
Boeing has rewarding openings for
engineers of EVERY category—electri
cal, civil, mechanical, aeronautical and
related fields, as well ;is lor applied

physicists and mathematicians with ad
\ a need degrees.
Careers at Boeing afford a wide vari
ety of experience in research, design and
production, as well as work with new
materials and techniques, and contacts
with a cross section of industry through
Boeing's vast subcontracting program.
Boeing promotes from within and
holds regular reviews to .issure in
dividual recognition. Engineers ;ire en
couraged to take graduate studies while
working and are reimbursed for all tui
tion expense.
