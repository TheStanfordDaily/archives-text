# Student Found Not Guilty of Code Violation
## 
### 
The Council for Student Control
recently declared a senior charged
with copying material during a test
from another's exam not guilty of
an Honor Code violation on grounds
of lack of conclusive evidence.
The case involved possible cheat
ing in two sections of a geology final
exam.
Testimony was brought before the
Council by three witnesses, the first
of whom stated that he saw the de
fendant let his eyes fall on another
student's paper during the exam.
The other two witnesses said that
they suspected cheating, but stressed
the point that they were uncertain.
They went on to say that they felt
that the Honor Code did not demand
"third person responsibility" to
maintain its effectiveness.
The Council, before delivering the
verdict, explained to the two wit
nesses that the Honor Code cannot
exist without this additional re
sponsibility. Even if a witness to a
suspicious act does not wish to turn
in the person, it is his duty to warn
the person to avoid further ques
tionable actions.
One member of Council pointed
out. that in a school under the proc
tor system, a test would be taken
away at the slightest suspicion of
cheating, and under the Honor Code
we have a duty to perform in return
for the privileges given.
