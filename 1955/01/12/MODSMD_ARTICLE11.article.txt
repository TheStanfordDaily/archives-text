# Eisenhower Asks Postal Rate Raise
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (UP)
—President Eisenhower asked
Congress today to raise postal
rates and grant some 1,500,000
civil service and postal em
ployees an average five percent
pay increase costing the govern
ment about $394 million a year.
While Mr. Eisenhower did not
spell out the proposed rate increase,
the administration wants to raise
the 3-cent postage on out-of-town
letters to 4 cents and increase the
charge for air mail from 6 to 7
cents. This would cost the public
about $233 million annually.
Democratic Congressional leaders
immediately opposed the mail rate
hikes, especially on first class mail,
and raised "grave doubt" they would
be approved. Both Republicans and
Democrats predicted some kind of
federal pay raise, perhaps higher
than Mr. Eisenhower suggested.
TWIN MESSAGES
In twin messages to Congress, the
President recommended a basic 5
per cent pay boost for 500,000 postal
workers, plus a new graduated sal
ary schedule that would give some
supervisory employees larger in
creases.
For one million classified Civil
Service employees, he proposed in
creases averaging about 5 per cent
and ranging from a low of $125 a
year for the lowest grade up to $800
a year for top carecr men. He said
the pay raise is needed to improve
the federal carecr service.
The proposed pay raises promptly
were denounced as insufficient by
chairman Olin D. Johnston (D.,
S.C.) of the Senate Post Office and
Civil Service Committee and the
National Federation of Post Office
Clerks (AFL). The 115,000-membcr
union is the biggest representing
government workers.
PAY INCREASE
Johnston has introduced, with
support of many Senators, a bill
providing for a 10 per cent pay in
crease for workers earning up to
$8,000 a year. He said the bulk of
any increase voted by Congress
should go to lower-bracket employ
ees.
Johnston also voiccd opposition to
higher mail rates, which Mr. Ei
senhower said are needed to cover
the proposed postal wage boosts and
help trim the Post Office Depart
ment's annual deficit of about $400
million.
The administration hopes to hold
the deficit to $325 million this fiscal
year. But, as in the past, the loss in
handling of second class mail is ex
pected to run about $240 million.

help trim the Post Office Depart
ment's annual deficit of about $400
million.
The administration hopes to hold
the deficit to $325 million this fiscal
year. But, as in the past, the loss in
handling of second class mail is ex
pected to run about $240 million.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (UP)
—President Eisenhower asked
Congress today to raise postal
rates and grant some 1,500,000
civil service and postal em
ployees an average five percent
pay increase costing the govern
ment about $394 million a year.
While Mr. Eisenhower did not
spell out the proposed rate increase,
the administration wants to raise
the 3-cent postage on out-of-town
letters to 4 cents and increase the
charge for air mail from 6 to 7
cents. This would cost the public
about $233 million annually.
Democratic Congressional leaders
immediately opposed the mail rate
hikes, especially on first class mail,
and raised "grave doubt" they would
be approved. Both Republicans and
Democrats predicted some kind of
federal pay raise, perhaps higher
than Mr. Eisenhower suggested.
TWIN MESSAGES
In twin messages to Congress, the
President recommended a basic 5
per cent pay boost for 500,000 postal
workers, plus a new graduated sal
ary schedule that would give some
supervisory employees larger in
creases.
For one million classified Civil
Service employees, he proposed in
creases averaging about 5 per cent
and ranging from a low of $125 a
year for the lowest grade up to $800
a year for top carecr men. He said
the pay raise is needed to improve
the federal carecr service.
The proposed pay raises promptly
were denounced as insufficient by
chairman Olin D. Johnston (D.,
S.C.) of the Senate Post Office and
Civil Service Committee and the
National Federation of Post Office
Clerks (AFL). The 115,000-membcr
union is the biggest representing
government workers.
PAY INCREASE
Johnston has introduced, with
support of many Senators, a bill
providing for a 10 per cent pay in
crease for workers earning up to
$8,000 a year. He said the bulk of
any increase voted by Congress
should go to lower-bracket employ
ees.
Johnston also voiccd opposition to
higher mail rates, which Mr. Ei
senhower said are needed to cover
the proposed postal wage boosts and
help trim the Post Office Depart
ment's annual deficit of about $400
million.
