BERLIN, Jan. 11 (UP) â€”An
American released from Russian
captivity said today that "only a
spark is needed to set off a revolt"
by 500,000 prisoners in the noto
rious Vorkuta forced labor camp in
side the Arctic Circle.
Special MVD troops killed 170 in
mates, wounded 4,500, and punished
many more in the ruthless crushing
of an uprising in July, 1953, when
news of the executed Lavrenti P.
Bcria's arrest reached the camp, he
said.
The American was John H. Noble,
31, of Detroit. After nine and one
half years as a prisoner of the So
viets he looked jaunty and healthy
when he appeared at a press con
ference three days after his release
here.
Noble said lie "heard" that Amer
ican airmen shot down over the
Baltic and U.S. soldiers captured in
Korea were in Vorkuta, but he did
not sec them.
He said fellow captives at Vorkuta
told him Vassily Stalin, son of the
late premier, was in the infamous
Lubianka prison at Moscow. Young
Stalin's sister, Svetlana, was ban
ished from Moscow after their fa
ther's death, according to the re
ports.
From what he heard Noble
sketched a ruthless struggle for
power inside Russia, with Premier
Georgi Malenkov's regime purging
Stalin backers and fighting to keep
cotnrol of the teeming labor camps.
He said all the captives at Vor
kuta, a complex of 150 separate
camps sprawling over hundreds of
square miles in the Siberian far
north, hoped for war which might
free them.
