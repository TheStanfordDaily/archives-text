UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Jan. 11
(UP) — Authoritative diplomatic
sources said today Red China has
rejected U.N. Secretary - General
Dag Hammar.skjold's demand for the
immediate release of 11 American
fliers. But an official spokesman
here said the United Nations chief
"has not failed" in his mission to
Peiping.
Highly placed diplomatic sources
in London, where the Foreign Office
received a "full report" from Hum
phrey Trevelyan, British charge
d'affaires in Peiping, said Hammar
skjold evidently had failed to win
freedom for the fliers jailed on "spy"
charges but apparently had kept the
door open for further negotiations
with Red Chinese Premier CHou
En-lai.
.An official spokesman here, who
said he had information "that I am
not at liberty to disclose," told re
porters:
'"The Secretary - General has not
failed. He has made progress to
ward the goal set for him by the
General Assembly. The talks in Pei
ping established a basis upon which
further progress can be made."
Hammarskjold himself was silent.
Arriving at Hong Kong en i»oute to
the United States via Tokyo, he told
newsmen he could not "comment in
substance" on his mission.
"You certainly appreciate that this
is neither the time nor the place
for me to make any comments on
my talks in Peiping," he said. "You
will know that I am requested to
report to the General Assembly on
my efforts."
During his trip Hammarskjold
also stopped off in India to confer
with Nehru, and in Hankow. All of
the Secretary-General's conferences
have been kept secret.
