# Palo Alto Expects Farm to Act on New Hospital Site
## 
### 
Stanford is expected to act next
week on Palo Alto's request for a
25-acre site in order to establish a
new Palo Alto Hospital.
City Manager Jerry Keithlcy told
the City Council Monday night that
he expected the Stanford Board of
Trustees to act on the matter in
their meeting Jan. 20.
The city is seeking a 25-acre site
on Quarry Road behind the Stan
ford Shopping Center and adjoin
ing the future Stanford Medical
School. Ten acres would be for
buildings, 10 for parking, and five
for future expansion.
Keithlcy reported that President
Wallace Sterling had written him
asking the city to consider the pos
sibility of hiring one architect, with
separate contracts, to design both
the Stanford and Palo Alto hospi
tals. Stanford plans to eventually
move its entire medical program
from San Francisco to the campus.
The choice of architects is wide
open, said Keithlcy. Palo Alto is
expected to invest $4 million, while
Stanford has estimated spending $15
million.
Stanford cannot sell any of its
land and will probably grant Palo
Alto a long-term lease if the Board
of Trustees approves the transac
tion.
The city's original plan was to ex
pand its present hospital. This has
been temporarily abandoned.
