# Council Gives Split Verdict In Code Case
## 
### 
The Council for Student Control
recently declared a junior history
student not guilty of an Honor Code
violation on grounds of lack of con
clusive evidence, but pronounced
him guilty of violating the privi
leges of the Code.
The Council found him not guilty
of a Code violation because evi
dence that he used material from
consulted matter during a final ex
amination proved inconclusive.
Evidence had been brought before
the Council that the student con
sulted a textbook during the test
and looked at a notebook just be
fore adding a conclusion to hia last
answer and handing in the exam.
The student testified that he only
looked at his books and notes to
check answers that he had already
completed and transferred none of
the material to his test paper.
Although the Council did not find
him guilty of a violation as such,
they did believe that the student
took "extreme liberties" with the
Honor Code and went far beyond
the permitted privileges expressed
or implied in the Code.
There are many privileges al
lowed students under the Honor
Code, the Council said, such as tak
ing a test anywhere one wishes
without a proctor, but the Code will
lose its force if the privileges arc
given unlimited interpretation.
As an educational and punitive
measure, the Council asked the stu
dent to write a paper on the Honor
Code, containing a complete discus
sion of the privileges and responsi
bilities of the Code.
