# Costa Rica Retaliates Against 'Airborne Nicaraguan Invasion'
## Nicaraguan Officials Claim 'Civil Revolution,' Deny Part in Conflict 
### 
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica, Jan. 11 (UP) —An airborne invasion force
crossed the Nicaraguan border today and clashed with Costa
Rican troops after seizing the communications center of Villa
Quesada, 30 miles from this capital city,
Costa Rican National Guardsmen engaged the invaders at Villa

Quesada while regular commercial
planes outfitted with machineguns
strafed the attacking force from the
air. Some casualties were reported,
but there were no definite figures.
Costa Rica blamed Nicaragua for
the attack, but Nicaraguan officials
described the fighting as a revolu
tion within Costa Rica and denied
that any invasion force had jumped
off from Nicaraguan territory.
President Figueres called it an in
vasion and said it was the beginning
of an "aggression which has been in
preparation for several years."
The Costa Rican ambassador to
El Salvador said Costa Rica had
severed diplomatic relations with
Nicaragua.
. Figueres sent a detachment of na
tional guardsmen, Costa Rica's only

armed force, to Villa Quesada as
soon as he learned of the attack.
The Costa Ricans clashed with thr
invaders, reporting some injuries
among the enemy force.
Figueres then dispatched moro
than 300 national guardsmen to the
occupied city. It was not known
whether the larger force had made
contact with the invaders, who werf>
reported preparing a landing strip
for a possible aid attack on San Jose.
Costa Rican officials said the in
vaders crossed the border from Ni
caragua in military transport planes
for the attack on Villa Quesada.
Two government planes flew over
Villa Quesada in the late afternoon,
strafing members of the invading
force who were leveling the ground
in an apparent effort to build a
landing strip.
The invaders replied with rifle
fire.
Costa Rican authorities said some
of the invaders were believed to
have been wounded in the strafing.
The invading force was not be
lieved to exceed 300. Reports from
Mexico City said the force included
mercenaries and soldiers of fortune
as well as political opponents of
Costa Rica's liberal regime.
In Managua, capital of Nicaragua,
President Anastasio Somoza, the na
tion's "strong man" for 18 years,
declared that it is "nonsensical" for
Figueres to contend that "Nicara
guans or men who had crossed the
border" had captured Villa Quesada.
Somoza, an old political enemy of
Figueres and his left-of-center gov
ernment, said "the so-called* inva
sion" was a "revolutionary spurt in
which only Costa Ricans are taking
part."
Nicaragua and Costa Rico have
been feuding for the past sever, I
years over sharp political differ
ences.
