# The 						Question of Education
## 
### 
What is a student? What is Stanford? What
is a Stanford education?
Should the Stanford graduate have a broad
liberal arts background or specialized, tech
nical training? Should graduate study and
faculty research or undergraduate instruction
be emphasized? Should there be a combination
of all these?,
What does an entering freshman expect of
Stanford? What does he find? How is he en
couraged —and is he encouraged—to become a
leader? What attitudes does he carry with him
upon graduation?
These are penetrating questions which seek
to determine what Stanford is now, what it could
be or ought to be.
These are the questions which the thirteen
students who are chosen to work on the Study
of Undergraduate Education will try to answer.
The Study of Undergraduate Education was

begun last October under the direction of Presi
dent Wallace Sterling. Financed by a $20,000
grant from the Ford Fund for the Advancement
of Education, the project will continue until
June, or until solutions to problems of under
graduate education are found. A special fac
ulty committee is already at work on the study.
The Study is an all-encompassing task, which
reguires students who have time to take sur
veys and attend discussion meetings, make
studies and write reports.
The Study is complex, involving intangibles
such as "atmosphere" and tangibles such as
unit requirements. It demands thoughtful stu
dents who will turn their interest in the general
and specific problems at Stanford today into a
blueprint for the Stanford of tomorrow.
These are the students for whom interviews
are now being held in the office of ASSU presi
dent Pete Bing. We urge all who have the time
and interest to apply.
