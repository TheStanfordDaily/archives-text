To the Editor:
We read with great interest and general approval
your editorial of January 10 on the Palo Alto debate
in the recognition of Red China. However, as mem
bers of Stanford's debating squad, we would like to
correct one drastic error. In this editorial you stated
that "most" colleges gave a "flat 'no' " when asked
whether or not their students should be allowed to
defend the 'pro' side in a debate on this question. Ac
tually, although Annapolis and West Point due to their
pecluliar situation as military schools decided not (o
debate this question, all but a scattered handful of the
nation's universities continued to support this topic
as our year-long debate question. It is still being de
bated by college students.
On November 22 to 24, 1954, in Tucson, Arizona, we
attended the Western State's Speech Association's an

nual tournament where participants representing 38
colleges from 11 western states debated the recogni
tion question. On November 24, the Vice-President
of the Association reported on Edward R. Murrow's
television defense of our right to discuss this question.
This report was enthusiastically applauded by all
the participants, and the sending of a resolution of
approval from the Association to Mr. Murrow was
agreed to by acclamation.
We as individuals are glad that we have been given
the right to examine this controversial area, and we
are thoroughly enjoying our debates on this topfr. In
defense of debaters here, and in "most" of the na
tion's universities we hope that you will explain this
error to the Stanford students who read the Daily.
