# Foreign Students Were 'Guests Of Jails' on HR Christmas Tour

### HELEN DEWAR 
It was something new for the
town of Lone Pine, Calif., when
a group of 23 weary Stanford
students trudged into the local
jail to spend the night.
It was something a little differ
ent also for the town of Kingman,
Ariz., when the same group took up
lodgings for the night in the town
court room. The inmates of the
nearby jail even furnished the stu
dents with mattresses.
These are two of the lively in
stances from the 1954 Christmas
Tour sponsored by the Institute of
International Relations and Foreign
Student Office and participated in
by 20 Stanford foreign students and
three Americans.
The group embarked on a Grey
hound bus the day after Christmas
to tour several of the "wonders'of
the West," including Lake Tahoe

and the Grand Canyon. The group
ushered in the New Year at Las
Vegas.
By using such methods as sleeping
in a jail, a court room, and on tum
bling mats in a high school gym, the
students managed to hold the cost
of transportation and lodging to less
than $50 a person for the eight-day,
2,000-mile journey.
The group was aided generously
in its efforts to keep costs at a min
imum by a restaurant in Selma,
Calif., which offered the group a
meal free of charge.
According to Rob Kline, lour
leader, the group was given several
opportunities to see United States
sight-seeing spots which the aver
age tourists are denied. A special
lecture was given by a Forest Serv
ice ranger at the Grand Canyon
where the travelers spent two days,
and a free tour, much more com
plete than the average, was given
them at Hoover Dam.
The gVoup was "congenial, but

diversified to say the least," Kline
remarked. The participants repre
sented 14 different countries, includ
ing Turkey, Spain, India, Finland,
China, Costa Rica, and Scotland.
One of the students got his first
opportunity to try skiing when the
group stopped over at Squaw Val
ley near Lake Tahoe. A few of the
more adventurous, athletic students
descended the wall of the Grand
Canyon .to the river bottom and
made the not-so-pleasurable ascent
back up to the top. Now that the
trip, is far in the past, one of the
climbers laughed and admitted that
"the last mile seemed really impos
sible."
The students were called on to
return some hospitality and good
will when they stopped their bus to
aid victims of a head-on collision
on Highway 99. The students
brought blankets and pillows from
the bus, helped the passengers from
the smashed cars, and called ambu
lances.
