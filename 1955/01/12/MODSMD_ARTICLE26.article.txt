REJECTION — Vice - Chancellor
Raymond B. Allen two weeks ago
turned down a petition signed by
3,004 students asking that the ad
ministration directive changing the
Daily Bruin constitution be re
scinded. The petition circulated the
week before the directive became
effective on Dec. 1(5. Allen refused
any change in the directive "until
and unless changes are proposed by
the Student Leigslative Council
which are acceptable to the Univer
sity."

REMEDY—According to Dr. Hen
ry Brainerd, associate professor of
clinical medicine at the University
of California Medical School, the
patients to whom many tons of pen
icillin have been given for colds
would have done better to have
taken aspirin or lemonade.

RELIC — At the University of
Michigan a blue wool sport jacket
has been hanging on a coat rack in
the Student Publications Building
for at least three years. The name
plate inside the collar proclaims the
owner to be the Daily's ex-chief
photographer, who graduated lrom
the university in February 1952. The
coat is now slightly out of shape
from its long inactivity on the coat
rack.
* * *
RISING RATES—New York Uni
versity will increase student tuition
and faculty salaries for the 1955-56
academic year. A schedule of maxi
mum and minimum salaries, the
first of its kind at NYU, will be set
up with the tuition boosts. Tuition
fees will be raised from $20 to $25
per unit, making the average cost
for one year of undergraduate study
$800.

REVISION — Duke University
president recently announced that
the Undergraduate Faculty Council
had approved wide revisions in the
existing quality point (grade point)
and attendance systems. The plan
will provide for unregulated attend
ance for juniors and seniors along
with a graduated scale of "require
ment hurdles" making it necessary
to maintain a 1.9 average (out of a
posisble 4.0) in order to graduate.
In order to stay in college freshmen
must maintain an average of 1.2;
sophomores, 1.4; and juniors, 1.6.

REMNANT—At USC the Student
Grill was aired out for several days
last week after a homemade stink
bomb was planted there. The bomb
was discovered by a porter cleaning
up in the evening. The smell had

been there all day but had not been
identified until a campus engineer
was called in to identify it. Things
are back to normal now; the smell
has gradually left the. room.

WOMAN SUFFERAGE — A soci
ety of co-eds was recently estab
lished at Nagoya University in Ja
pan. The principle of this society,
said one co-ed, "is neither to asso
ciate with boy-students nor to iso
late ourselves, but to join with boy
students and find help in solving our
problems." The society has already
begun some concrete activities such
as discussion on problems of secur
ing employment.

RESULTS OVERWHELMING —
The March of Toys drive before
Christmas vacation at Kansas Uni
versity netted almost 5,000 toys. The
toys, all but about 50 of which were
new, were distributed to thousands
of Kansas children who otherwise
would have been without Chirstmas

JECTED—Proposals for adding to
the number of prescribed language
courses in the Columbia University
curriculum met with opposition
from the teaching staff. The chief
reason for the staff's opposition to
the new requirements was the fear
that the students already had too
large a prescribed program of stud
ies. At present half of the units
needed for graduation consist of re
