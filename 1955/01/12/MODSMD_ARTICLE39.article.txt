NOT QUITE ENOUGH—Stanford's Russ Lawler aims a left handed jump shot that scores two
points for the Indians late in Saturday night's contest against UCLA. Guarding.him is John Moore
of the Bruins, who took over the center spot when Willie Naulls had fouled out. Lawler's field
goal aided the Stanford cause, but the effort fell far short of overtaking the red-hot shooting visi
tors. Stanford lost, 91-75. However, they had triumphed in the previous night's contest, so the
series was split. —Photo by Frank Jiuntress
