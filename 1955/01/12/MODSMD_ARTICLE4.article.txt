# Group Will Discuss Publicity Problems
## 
### 
At 5 o'clock this afternoon the
Publicity Co-ordinating Board will
meet in the ASSU Excom Room
with previously invited publicity
chairmen of the large campus org
anizations that are sponsoring wint
er quarter activities which require
a large amount of publicity.
The purpose of the meeting is to
decide the amount of publicity that
will be given for each of these ac
tivities. The basis for the decision
will be the importance of the ac
tivity to the students which will be
judged on the number of people who
will take part in it. For this reason
each representative is requested to
bring a list of the dates of the ac
tivities and types of publicity
desired. Representatives should be
sure to come because priority will
also be based on attendance.
The Pub Rel Com will decide the
division of the publicity, and the re
sults will be announced four or five
days later.
At the meeting there will be an
explanation of the solicitation policy
which has been made with the Palo
Alto merchants and Chamber of
Commerce. Also appointments will
be made for lessons in silk screening.
