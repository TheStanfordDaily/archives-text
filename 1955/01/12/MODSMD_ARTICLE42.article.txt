If comparative basketball results ;
mean anything, Stanford should be |
the top team in the country this j
week.
The Indian cagers topped Vander- j
bilt, 72-64, on the losers' floor dur- j
ing vacation. Monday night, the
Commodores from Tennessee edged
out Georgia Tech, 71-69.
What does this prove? Well, on
Saturday, Tech accomplished the
impossible by handing Kentucky,
the number one team in the country
for the past few weeks and all last
year, their first loss in 32 games and
129 home contests, 59-58.
Despite the loss, Kentucky again

country yesterday. Therefore, Coach
Howie Dallmar's men beat the team
which beat the team which beat the
number one team in the country.
