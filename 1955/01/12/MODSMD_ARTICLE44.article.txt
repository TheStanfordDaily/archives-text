# Card Tennis Coach Looks For Improved Team in '55
## 
### BILL RHOADES 
Boasting perhaps the top college player in the country in Jack
Frost, the Stanford tennis team should have an improved season
in 1955, according to tennis coach Bob Renker.
Frost, a junior, ranked thirteenth nationally, is backed by letter
men Dave Duff, Henry Sutcliffe, and Bob Norton. Also counted on

lor help will be Ernie Dubray, star*
of a few years ago who just got out
of the Army, and Phil Hogue, Den
nis Wetterholm, and Bob Prince—up
from last year's frosh team.
Although the club had a fairly
successful over-all record last year,
they did rather poorly in the con- j
ferencs, a situation which they hope
to rectify. On paper, Cal appears to
have the best team with Stanford.
UCLA, and USC about even behind
them. Any one of the three could
challenge the Bears for the title.
PCC IS TOPS
Nationally, the team should stack j
up as one of the top five in the j
country. As usual, most of the good !
college teams in the nation are on
the Coast. Whoever emerges as the
PCC champion should also be the
best nationally. Ham R:y':»ardson's
graduation from Tulane leaves Frost
as the best college player around.
The racket men open the '55 sea
son when they travel to meet the i
California Tennis Club on Feb. 13.
Their first home match is Feb. 26
when they host the powerful Olym
pic Club. During the course of the
season, they will meet the Olympic
Club twice, the California Tennis
Club twice, San Jose State twice,
COP once, and each conference
team twice. They will also enter
four tournaments.
FROSH ALSO STRONG
The freshmen should also have a
strong team headed by Jackie
Douglas, Gilbert White, and Bob
Bowden. Douglas, ranked thirtieth

nationally, is no doubt the best
freshman racket wielder on the
Coast. The frosh have an excellent
chance of going undefeated this
year. Stanford and UCLA seem to
have the only outstanding fresh
man teams.
Next year, the picture should be
even brighter. The only senior with
a good chance of even making the
team this year is Mackey Wirth.
The rest of the squad is composed
of sophomores and juniors. With
Frost, Dubray, and Douglas leading
the way, Stanford could Jiave the
top team in the nation next year.
