SCIENCE MADE SIMPLE: No. I
I:i this day and age. as I 'ike to call it, everybody should know
something about science. Unfortunately, however, the great majority
of us are majoring in elocution, and we do not get a chance to take
any science. But we can at least learn the fundamentals.
Though this column is intended to be a source of innocent merri
ment for all sexes and not to concern itself with weighty matters,
1 have asked the makers of Philip Morris whether I might not from
time to time use this space for a short lesson in science. "Makers,"
1 said to them, "might I not from time to time use this space for a
short lesson in science?"
"Bless you, lad!" cried the makers, chuckling. "You may cer
tainly use this space from time to time for a short lesson in science."
They are very benign men, the makers, fond of children, small
animals, community singing, and simple country food. Their benevo
lence is due in no small measure to the cigarettes they smoke, for
Philip Morris is a cigarette to soothe the most savage of breasts. I
refer not only to the quality of the tobacco — which, as everyone
knows, is amiable, humane, and gracious — but also to the quality
of the package. Here is no fiendishly contrived container to fray the
fingernails and rasp the nerves. Here, instead, is the most simple
of devices: you pull a tab, a snap is heard, and there, ready at hand,
are your Philip Morris Cigarettes. Strike a match, take a pulF, and
heave a delicious little rippling sigh of pure content.
So, with the cordial concurrence of the makers, I will from time to
time devote this column to a brief lesson in science.
Let us start today with chemistry. It is fitting that chemistry
should be the first of our series, for chemistry is the oldest of sciences,
having been discovered by Ben Franklin in 123 B.C. when an apple
fell on his head while he was shooting the breeze with Pythagoras
one day outside the Acropolis. (The reason they were outside the
Acropolis and not inside was that Pythagoras had been thrown out
for drawing right triangles all over the walls. They had several
meetings outside the Acropolis, but finally Franklin said, "Look,
Pythagoras, this is nothing against you, see, but I'm no kid any more
and if I keep laying around on this wet grass with you, I'm liable
to get the break-bone fever. I'm going inside." Pythagoras, friendless
now, moped around Athens for a while, then drifted off to Brussels
where he married a girl named Harriet Sigafoos and went into the
linseed oil game. He would also certainly be forgotten today had
not Shakespeare written "Othello.")
But 1 digress. We were beginning a discussion of chemistry, and
the best way to begin is, of course, with fundamentals. Chemicals
arc divided into elements. There are four: air, earth, fire, and water.
Any number of delightful combinations can be made from these
elements, such as firewater, dacron, and chef's salad.
Chemicals can be further divided into the classes of explosive
and non-explosive. A wise chemist always touches a match to his
chemicals before he begins an experiment.
A great variety of containers of different sizes and shapes are used
in a chemistry lab. There are tubes, vials, beakers, flasks, pipettes,
and retorts. (A retort is also a snappy comeback, such as "Oh, yeah?"
or "So's your old man!"
(Perhaps the most famous retort ever made was delivered by none
other than Noah Webster himself. It seems that one day Mr. Web
ster's wife walked unexpectedly into Mr. Webster's office and found
Mr. Webster's secretary sitting on Mr. Webster's knee. "Why Mr.
Webster!" cried Mr. Webster's wife. "I am surprised!"
("No, my dear," he replied. "I am surprised. You arc astonished."
(Well, sir, it must be admitted that old Mr. Webster got off a
good one, but still one can not help wishing he had spent less time
trifling with his secretary, and more time working on his diction
ary. Many of his definitions show an appalling want of scholarship.
Take, for instance, what happened to me not long ago. 1 went to the
dictionary to look up "houghband" which is a band that you pass
around the leg and neck of an animal. At the time I was planning
to pass bands around the legs and necks of some animals, and I
wanted to be sure I ordered the right thing.
(Well sir, thumbing through the Il's in the dictionary, T hap
pened to come across "horse." And this is how Mr. Webster defines
"horse"—"a large, solid hoofed herbivorous mammal, used as a
draft animal."
(Now this, I submit, is just plain sloppiness. The most cursory
investigation would have shown Mr. Webster that horses are not
mammals. Mammals give milk. Horses do not give milk. It has to be
taken from them under the most severe duress.
(Nor is the horse a draft animal, as Mr. Webster says. Man is a
draft animal. Mr. Webster obviously had the cavalry in mind, but
even in the cavalry it is men who are drafted. Horses volunteer.)
But. I digress. We were discussing chemistry. I have told you the
most important aspects, but there are many more — far too many
to cover in the space remaining here. However, I am sure that there
is a fine chemistry lab at your very own college. Why don't you go up
some afternoon and poke around? Make a kind of fun day out of it.
Bring ukeleles. Wear funny hats. Toast frankfurters on the Bunsen
burners. Be gay, be merry, be loose, for chemistry is your friend!
