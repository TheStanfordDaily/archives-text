# New Farm TV Program To Go on Air
## 
### 
Stanford's active radio and
television department will be
gin a new 13-week television
series, titled "Our Rugged Con
stitution," Jan. 21.
7he educational series, filmed and
nationally distributed by Station
KQED in San Francisco, is a long
standing project, of Professors Stan
ley Donner and Stewart Hyde of
the radio-TV department, and will
put. Stanford back on TV after a
two-year absence.
The last .sliow sponsored and pro
duced by the University was a doc
umentary called "People, Places,
and Politics" whioh netted the de
partment a TV award.
Dr. Donner credits the idea for the
program to a book entitled "Your
Pugged Constitution" published by
the Stanford Press two years ago.
For fear that "'Your Rugged Con
stitution" would appeal "only to
body beautiful adherents, the "Y" in
the title was dropped.
The purpose of the series, as de
scribed by Dr. Donner, is to picture
the constitution as a "living, vital,
rugged document" in the light of
current events. It will draw from
timely news items and springboard
from there to vital constitutional
principles.
GRANTS FINANCE PROGRAM
A grant, from the National Asso
ciation of Educational Broadcasters
and another donation from the Edu
cational Radio and Television Cen
ter in Ann Arbor, Michigan, put the
idea on its financial feet. It will be
shown live throughout the local
area over Channel 9 and filmed at
the same time for later distribution
to educational stations around the
nation.
Students either majoring or ac
tively Interested in television work
will participate in the script-writ
ing and production end of the pro
gram, with one student each week
serving as assistant producer. Jan
et. Mason, a graduate radio-TV ma
jor from Montclair, New Jersey,
holdr. down the assistant producer's
role for the first show.
OPEN TO ALL
Dr. Donner emphasized that, not
just graduates and undergraduate
radio-TV majors arc participating
in the series; anyone who is inter
ested in TV work may drop by and
talk to him.
KQED will furnish the facilities
and the studio where the program
will be filmed, emanating at 7:30
each Friday night between Jan. 21
and April 15.
The program will present Dr.
Donner as host and moderator each
week, and will include three guest
faculty members who will discuss,
in conversational rather than dis
cussion form, the current issue. The
first showing will feature Dr. Har
old Fisher, chairman of the Hoover
Institute; Dr. John Goheen, head of
the Philosophy Department; and
Professor Stanley Morrison, who is
in charge of the Constitutional Law
division of the Law School. These
three will apply historical, philo
sophical, and legal scrutiny to the
problem at hand.
INAUGURAL PROGRAM
The inaugural program deals with
the resistance encountered by a
Madison, Wisconsin, reporter who
tried to get signatures of citizens on
a petition supporting the Constitu
tion and Declaration of Independ
ence. The citizen reactions, includ
ing accusation of "Red leaning" and
"I don't want to lose my job," will
keynote the discussion on the basic
facts underlying the Preamble and
the Constitution.
Among the students who have
been working on the scries are Jim
Eaves, Dick Elliott, Allen Dunn,
John Weiscr, and Bill Boyd. Mark
Fanner is the art director, while
Professor Joseph Williams is sup
plying the maps and charts.
