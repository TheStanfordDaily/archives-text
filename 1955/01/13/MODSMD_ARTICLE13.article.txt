their former decision.
In favor of the motion to rescind were Jack Tracy, Sally Beel,

Carol Gevurtz, Roberta Clark, and 4
Jim Flanagan.

Palmer, .Jon Cosovich, Don Peck,
Dave Brownwood, Dianne Goldman,
Betty Bigelow, Bob Bowden, ancf
Steve Voykovieh.
In his re-introduction of the sub
ject, Pete Bing pointed out that, at
the National Students Association
summer conference, a subcommittee
voted down a resolution which fa
vored bringing the Russian student,
editors to the United States.
RESOLUTION DEFEATED
This resolution had been brought
to the plenary floor of the convention
as a minority resolution, and defeat
ed by a vote of 235 to (50.
Both Bing and Bob Gable sug
gested that Stanford write to the
State Department and ask for their
reasons for delaying entrance per
mits.
Speaking in favor of endorsing the
movement, Sam Palmer asserted
that "nothing can be lost in allow
ing them to tome over."
lie was supported by both Dianne
j Goldman and Don Peck, who
claimed that it was important to
show' Russia that the United States
is not an Iron Curtain country- that
we arc willing to let Communists
enter.
I,EARN, SEE, AND TALK
"The visitors can't help but leant,
see, and talk," stated Pat King.
"They will get impressions and
memories of the United States that
nothing will be able to erase, even
| though they might be unable to
write about these facts once they re
turn to Russia."
A1 Loomis stressed the point that
the visitors would not be free
agents, but more in the line of
trained propagandists, and ques
tioned the use of bringing such visi
tors to the 1 United States instead of
students from non - Communist
countries.
Steve Voykovieh asserted that
such a visit would bo harmless to
the United States, and underlined
the need for co-existence in the
world of today. He felt that bring
ing in the Russian visitors would
be a step in the right direction.
A later motion by Dianne Gold
man requesting Bing to write ,the
State Department for further infor
mation on the matter was defeated.
