MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Jan. 12
(UP) â€”President Anastasio Somoza
tonight, challenged President Jose Fi
gueres of Costa Pica to a duel with
pistols to settle the dispute between
their two countries.
Somoza offered to meet Figueres
at the Costa Rican-Nicaraguan fron
tier with revolvers for a settlement,
of the dispute on a "man to man"
basis, but indicated he thought Fi
gueres would not accept the chal
lenge.
Somoza, who once trained with
the United States Marine Corps, is
the champion pistol and rifle shot
of the Nicaraguan army.
Somoza called Figueres a "damn
liar" for charging that Nicaragua
was behind the '"uprising" against
the Costa Rican government.
"If he has .so much personal hate
for trie . . . let's put it on a man to
man basis," Somoza said. "There is
no reason for bloodshed between
our two countries. If he bates me,
as was evident when he tried to as
sassinate me, then why not settle it
this way?"
The Nicaraguan president said lie
was so anxious to demonstrate that
Nicaragua has nothing to do with
the Costa Rican "invasion" that he
has ordered a roundup of all Costa
Ricans in Nicaragua to block any
charges that Costa Ricans are using
Nicaragua as a springboard to at
tack the Figueres regime.
