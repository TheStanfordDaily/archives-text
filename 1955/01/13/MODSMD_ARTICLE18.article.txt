# Injustice Under the Law

In his State of the Union message to Con
gress, President Eisenhower called for revi
sion of the McCarran-Walter Act on immigra
tion.
This revision is as necessary as it is long
overdue. The McCarran Act has done untold
harm to the international reputation of the
United States. Again and again one reads sto
ries about its evil effects.
Such a story was recently released from San
Francisco.
It concerned a young violinist from the Phil
ippines, Redentor Ligot Romero, who had
dreamed of coming to America to study West
ern music since he was a young boy.
He arrived in the United States in December
1952.
Romero was admitted to the United States on
a visitor's visa, and told that he could apply
later for a student's visa.
But he made one mistake. He didn't read sec
tion 248 of the McCarran Act.
Because he didn't read the fine print on page
301, Romero engaged in many activities for
bidden to visitors. He studied music at San

Francisco State, sold kitchen utensils for sub
sistence money, and gave a recital at Marines
Memorial Theater.
His application for a student's visa was de
nied.
Now Romero has two alternatives. He can go
back to the Philippines, pick up a student's
visa, and return. He cannot afford this.
Or he can stay in the United States until he
is deported. In this case he may never return
to America.
There are many Romeros. Most of them
never get their cases into the newspaper and
before the public, but, like the more publicized
figures, they too have their problems and their
discouragements.
Ultimately, the combined mass of these
problems and disillusionments will destroy
America's international reputation.
The seed of much of this discouragement,
the cause of many of these problems, can be
traced to the McCarran-Walter Act.
Since its inception, it has been instrumental
in blocking America's traditionally open door.
That door must be re-opened.
