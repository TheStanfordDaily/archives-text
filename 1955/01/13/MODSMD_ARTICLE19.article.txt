# BULL SESSION
## 
### DICK MEISTER 
We arc gathered here today to pay trib,ute to the
unsung heroes of our fair university, those little men
and fomen on campus, those overworked and under
appreciated students. Grasp your rah rah red and
white megaphone fiimly in h;md, clear your throats,
and give a great big peachy cheer for Stanford's
answer to the Boy Scouts, the Camp Fire Girls, the
McCarthy Committee; the World's number one do
gooders. Why these veritable saints have even re
placed the pooch as man's best friend. (We prefer
goils, but to coin an old phrase, "That's the way it
goes").
Getting back to our heroes, who are ihey? All you
die-hards who have hung on this long will now g*t
your prize. We give you . . . the Hasher, that's who.
Ore of our associates, Nap Bonaparte, director of
dining halls at Kansackit Normal, says that, "A student
studies on his stomach." So, if you went plus last
quarter you may give thanks for your phenomenal
success to that satisfied stomach feeling. But, did you
ever ask yourself who's responsible for that happy
feeling? The Hasher, that's v/ho.
Who bicaks his back carrying them overloaded
trays of goodies? The Hasher, that's who. You can
spot a Hasher a mile away, that sway back ain't from
carrying books.
Who gets up at the crack of dawn (or leaves the
party at day's first light, just when it's really start
ing to roll) to hustle you your morning meal? The
Hasher, that's who. Dark circled eyes are also a
hasher distinguished characteristic.
And who holds all the world's records for speed
eating? Yes, you're right, the Hasher. We knew one
Hasher, bless his soul, who managed to have 11 o'clock
and 12 o'clock classes daily, hash each day, and never

miss a class. He ate his lunch in two minutes flat. Used
to say it took him so long 'cause he couldn't stand hot
soup. He worked and worked, and damned if he didn't
finally get to like boiling soup; never talked much
anyway. Of course then it was too late, ulcer, you
know. Nice fella, we miss him.
You see, then, that our heroes are also athletes of
no mean consequence, holding world's records and
such
You might even compare them to a football squad.
At quarterback are those Hasher's Hashers, the real
team men; collectively as "Head Hashers." But we
know a few who are individually referred to as
"Hasher-Heads." Jokingly, of course, sort of like
football players refer to each other. For instance,
what Stanford's pigskinners now call their buddies
at UCLA.
Carrying on our analogy (now there's a real word),
have you c?Ver seen a Hasher skirt around that table
on the right end of the room to get your chow?
Chuck Taylor is looking for a scat-back. Take your
pick, coach.
Firmly believing that the Hasher is a true unsung
hero we offer our ideas of elevating him (and her)
to the deserved position of sung hero.
First, no more referral to shaggy haired mutts as
your best friends, your real buddy boy is the Hasher,
he can't bark, but he comes on with that ever-lovin',
grade raisin' (remember Bonaparte of old K. Normal),
FOOD.
Secondly, when you're carrying on that seminar at
the lunch table as your hasher is missing his third
one o'clock for the week (that's okay, part of the
hero role), channel the discussion around to design
of medals, the kind real live heros get.
Need we say more?

You might even compare them to a football squad.
At quarterback are those Hasher's Hashers, the real
team men; collectively as "Head Hashers." But we
know a few who are individually referred to as
"Hasher-Heads." Jokingly, of course, sort of like
football players refer to each other. For instance,
what Stanford's pigskinners now call their buddies
at UCLA.
Carrying on our analogy (now there's a real word),
have you c?Ver seen a Hasher skirt around that table
on the right end of the room to get your chow?
Chuck Taylor is looking for a scat-back. Take your
pick, coach.
Firmly believing that the Hasher is a true unsung
hero we offer our ideas of elevating him (and her)
to the deserved position of sung hero.
First, no more referral to shaggy haired mutts as
your best friends, your real buddy boy is the Hasher,
he can't bark, but he comes on with that ever-lovin',
grade raisin' (remember Bonaparte of old K. Normal),
FOOD.
Secondly, when you're carrying on that seminar at
the lunch table as your hasher is missing his third
one o'clock for the week (that's okay, part of the
hero role), channel the discussion around to design
of medals, the kind real live heros get.
Need we say more?
We arc gathered here today to pay trib,ute to the
unsung heroes of our fair university, those little men
and fomen on campus, those overworked and under
appreciated students. Grasp your rah rah red and
white megaphone fiimly in h;md, clear your throats,
and give a great big peachy cheer for Stanford's
answer to the Boy Scouts, the Camp Fire Girls, the
McCarthy Committee; the World's number one do
gooders. Why these veritable saints have even re
placed the pooch as man's best friend. (We prefer
goils, but to coin an old phrase, "That's the way it
goes").
Getting back to our heroes, who are ihey? All you
die-hards who have hung on this long will now g*t
your prize. We give you . . . the Hasher, that's who.
Ore of our associates, Nap Bonaparte, director of
dining halls at Kansackit Normal, says that, "A student
studies on his stomach." So, if you went plus last
quarter you may give thanks for your phenomenal
success to that satisfied stomach feeling. But, did you
ever ask yourself who's responsible for that happy
feeling? The Hasher, that's v/ho.
Who bicaks his back carrying them overloaded
trays of goodies? The Hasher, that's who. You can
spot a Hasher a mile away, that sway back ain't from
carrying books.
Who gets up at the crack of dawn (or leaves the
party at day's first light, just when it's really start
ing to roll) to hustle you your morning meal? The
Hasher, that's who. Dark circled eyes are also a
hasher distinguished characteristic.
And who holds all the world's records for speed
eating? Yes, you're right, the Hasher. We knew one
Hasher, bless his soul, who managed to have 11 o'clock
and 12 o'clock classes daily, hash each day, and never

miss a class. He ate his lunch in two minutes flat. Used
to say it took him so long 'cause he couldn't stand hot
soup. He worked and worked, and damned if he didn't
finally get to like boiling soup; never talked much
anyway. Of course then it was too late, ulcer, you
know. Nice fella, we miss him.
You see, then, that our heroes are also athletes of
no mean consequence, holding world's records and
