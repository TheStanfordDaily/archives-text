# Farm Land Program 'Right on Schedule'
## 
### RUSS WILKS Associate Editor, The Daily 
Stanford Business Manager Alf Brandin said the land develop
ment program looked bright yesterday as he announced that the
major construction projects were "right on schedule."
He directed his comments to the new frosh dormitory, the ex
pansion of Crothers Hall, and the regional shopping center.
The 704-man freshman dorm which will replace Encina Hall has

already risen two stories in frame-*
work, while Crothers Memorial Hull
is nearing the same proportions.
Brandin expressed confidence that
both dorms would bo ready For oc
cupancy by the beginning of the fall
quarter of this year.
The frosh dorm, as yet unnamed,
is located opposite Stern Hall, occu
pying a 21-acre site at the southeast
corner of Escondido Road and Ar
guello Street.
The Crothers addition will com
plete a quadrangle effect.
Progress is rapid at the $15 million
regional shopping center which is
situated on a 55-acre lot and fronts
on 1,500 feet, of El Camino Real, just
north of Palo Alto Hospital.
Surface work has begun on the
Emporium, which is going according
to schedule in order to finish the
department store by March 1956.
A second building, which will
house Roos Bros, and I. Magnin, is
also under construction and should
be completed this August. Brandin
announced that appropriations will
be requested for the start of con
struction on a third building at the
Jan. 20 meeting of the Board of
Trustees. This building will house
o2 tenants.
The four other buildings in the
50-store area are all expected to be
under construction by May 1.
Work thus far has consisted of
building roads, storm drains, sewer
age, and basement and footings for
the Emporium. Surface work will be
noticeable within the next 30 days.
The Embarcadero Road extension
running from El Camino behind the
hospital to San Francisquito Creek
has been completed. The new sec
tion of Willow Road which runs
from the rear of the shopping cen
ter to the junction with Sartd Hill
and Alpine has also been finished.
Workers are putting the final
touches on Quarry Road.
The last phase of the road work
will be the construction of a bridge
over San Francisquito Creek. The
two-lane bridge will connect the
extended Willow Road with Alpine j

and Sand Hill near the third hole
of the Stanford golf course. Santa
Clara and San Mateo Counties have
both donated $25,000 to the project,
with the University picking up the
rest of the tab. Start of construction
is set for March 1.

NEW FROSH DORM—Growing fast on the Stanford campus
is the new hall for freshman men students. The hall, when com
pleted, will accommodate 704 students. JThe building is being
built near Branner and Stern Halls on a lot bounded by Arguello
and Escondido Road. Other campus buildings are also progress
ing according to schedule. —Daily photo by Ken Green
Stanford Business Manager Alf Brandin said the land develop
ment program looked bright yesterday as he announced that the
major construction projects were "right on schedule."
He directed his comments to the new frosh dormitory, the ex
pansion of Crothers Hall, and the regional shopping center.
The 704-man freshman dorm which will replace Encina Hall has

already risen two stories in frame-*
work, while Crothers Memorial Hull
is nearing the same proportions.
Brandin expressed confidence that
both dorms would bo ready For oc
cupancy by the beginning of the fall
quarter of this year.
The frosh dorm, as yet unnamed,
is located opposite Stern Hall, occu
pying a 21-acre site at the southeast
corner of Escondido Road and Ar
guello Street.
The Crothers addition will com
plete a quadrangle effect.
Progress is rapid at the $15 million
regional shopping center which is
situated on a 55-acre lot and fronts
on 1,500 feet, of El Camino Real, just
north of Palo Alto Hospital.
Surface work has begun on the
Emporium, which is going according
to schedule in order to finish the
department store by March 1956.
A second building, which will
house Roos Bros, and I. Magnin, is
also under construction and should
be completed this August. Brandin
announced that appropriations will
be requested for the start of con
struction on a third building at the
Jan. 20 meeting of the Board of
Trustees. This building will house
o2 tenants.
The four other buildings in the
50-store area are all expected to be
under construction by May 1.
Work thus far has consisted of
building roads, storm drains, sewer
age, and basement and footings for
the Emporium. Surface work will be
noticeable within the next 30 days.
The Embarcadero Road extension
running from El Camino behind the
hospital to San Francisquito Creek
has been completed. The new sec
tion of Willow Road which runs
from the rear of the shopping cen
ter to the junction with Sartd Hill
and Alpine has also been finished.
Workers are putting the final
touches on Quarry Road.
The last phase of the road work
will be the construction of a bridge
over San Francisquito Creek. The
two-lane bridge will connect the
extended Willow Road with Alpine j

and Sand Hill near the third hole
of the Stanford golf course. Santa
Clara and San Mateo Counties have
both donated $25,000 to the project,
with the University picking up the
rest of the tab. Start of construction
is set for March 1.
