# Wartime Polish Diplomat To Moscow Visits Stanford
## Combs Archives For Own Papers 
### RIC TEAGUE 
The vagaries of an unsettled
world have brought Dr. Stanis
law Kot to Stanford. Dr. Kot,
wartime Polish ambassador in
Moscow in 1941 and 1942, has
come to the Hoover Institute and
Library to search the archives
for his own correspondence of
his Moscow period, which was
brought to this country follow
ing World War 11.
The fact that his search for his
papers has led him to the Hoover
Library is proof, in Professor Kot's
opinion, of the importance in the
world of this library.
The campus tower houses the
most unique collection of its kind.
Dr. Kot's only disappointment with
the library is the lack of organiza
tion within its archives. He feels
that a collection of this importance
warrants any appropriation neces
sary to maintain adequate catalog
ing and organization.
Dr. Kot js Lmp,i;essl?d with the
American sttideiit. He said that the
young people he has seen on the
Stanford campus "are very fortu
nate, that they appear healthy and
well fed, are well dressed and neat
in appearance." This is not the case
with the European student.
"Generally," said Dr. Kot, "the
European student looks poor and
underfed. His clothes are poor—his
complexion is not good."
MORE CONCENTRATION
He was equally impressed by the
Stanford campus. "It is a very fine
campus, far from the city life." This
rural atmosphere, he feels, "allows
for the concentration of efforts" to
a greater degree than do most Eu
ropean campuses which are, for the
most part, located in cities.
Again, the Stanford student is for
tunate in that the buildings on his
campus are modern, well planned,
and more than adequate. The mod
ern living units on the campus im
pressed Dr. Kot. He feels that even
the students' newspaper is well ed
ited and alive and is conducive to
college life.
The large number of Stanford stu
dents who assist themselves finan
cially in school by taking part-time
employment surprised Professor
Kot. The student here can, with a
part-time job, earn $20 a week, but
a Parisian with full-time employ
ment in a position comparable to a
student's part-time job earns ap
proximately $80 a month. A part
time job in Paris would be of neg
ligible benefit to a student.
NO UPRISING
Dr. Kot feels that anything that
can be said, in a short interview,
about the problems of peoples un
der the domination of Soviet Rus
sia would be superficial. But "forget
about a Polish uprising," he advises.
"It would be impossible under the
Soviet system. The police state does

not allow people to form a group
capable of a revolution."
Professor Kot pointed out the his
torical basis for this opinion. "Rev
olutions are not conducted by peo
ple dying from hunger.
"None of the revolutions in the
past were directed by people who
were hungry and who lived on the
lowest material level. All of the
revolutions of the past were organ
ized and led by people who had
a certain standard of life which gave
them the strength and vigor neces
sary to undertake a mass uprising.
"In the Soviet system it is only
the bureaucracy which has strength
and vigor, but being the privileged
class, it has no interest in producing
a revolution."
In speaking of Soviet bureaucracy
being a privileged class, Dr. Kot
commented that "the classless so
ciety is a lie. The chasm between
the working classes and the ruling
class is real and great."
"All nations presently dominated
by the Russian Soviet system," ac
cording to Dr. Kot, "are dissatisfied
and are opposed to this rule not
only as a social and economic in
justice to them, but also because it
imposes Russian domination upon
them, to which they are basically
antagonistic."
Dr. Kot was professor of history
at the University of Krakow be
tween the two world wars—l9lB to
1939. He was one of the leaders of
the Polish Peasant party. He is now
living in Paris where he is a repre
sentative of the International Peas
ant party.
In addition to searching for his
personal correspondence, he is in
the United States looking for some
of his sources pertaining' to social
and cultural ideas of the lGth and
17th centuries. These sources were,
in recent years, transferred from
Europe to the United States and are
now in the collections of American
libraries. He located some of this
material in the Starr King School
Library in' Berkeley.
His visit to the United Sattes was

made possible by the Rockefeiler
Foundation and he has stated that
that he is "very grateful to them"
for their sponsorship.

class, it has no interest in producing
a revolution."
In speaking of Soviet bureaucracy
being a privileged class, Dr. Kot
commented that "the classless so
ciety is a lie. The chasm between
the working classes and the ruling
class is real and great."
"All nations presently dominated
by the Russian Soviet system," ac
cording to Dr. Kot, "are dissatisfied
and are opposed to this rule not
only as a social and economic in
justice to them, but also because it
imposes Russian domination upon
them, to which they are basically
antagonistic."
Dr. Kot was professor of history
at the University of Krakow be
tween the two world wars—l9lB to
1939. He was one of the leaders of
the Polish Peasant party. He is now
living in Paris where he is a repre
sentative of the International Peas
ant party.
In addition to searching for his
personal correspondence, he is in
the United States looking for some
of his sources pertaining' to social
and cultural ideas of the lGth and
17th centuries. These sources were,
in recent years, transferred from
Europe to the United States and are
now in the collections of American
libraries. He located some of this
material in the Starr King School
Library in' Berkeley.
His visit to the United Sattes was

made possible by the Rockefeiler
Foundation and he has stated that
that he is "very grateful to them"
for their sponsorship.
The vagaries of an unsettled
world have brought Dr. Stanis
law Kot to Stanford. Dr. Kot,
wartime Polish ambassador in
Moscow in 1941 and 1942, has
come to the Hoover Institute and
Library to search the archives
for his own correspondence of
his Moscow period, which was
brought to this country follow
ing World War 11.
The fact that his search for his
papers has led him to the Hoover
Library is proof, in Professor Kot's
opinion, of the importance in the
world of this library.
The campus tower houses the
most unique collection of its kind.
Dr. Kot's only disappointment with
the library is the lack of organiza
tion within its archives. He feels
that a collection of this importance
warrants any appropriation neces
sary to maintain adequate catalog
ing and organization.
Dr. Kot js Lmp,i;essl?d with the
American sttideiit. He said that the
young people he has seen on the
Stanford campus "are very fortu
nate, that they appear healthy and
well fed, are well dressed and neat
in appearance." This is not the case
with the European student.
"Generally," said Dr. Kot, "the
European student looks poor and
underfed. His clothes are poor—his
complexion is not good."
MORE CONCENTRATION
He was equally impressed by the
Stanford campus. "It is a very fine
campus, far from the city life." This
rural atmosphere, he feels, "allows
for the concentration of efforts" to
a greater degree than do most Eu
ropean campuses which are, for the
most part, located in cities.
Again, the Stanford student is for
tunate in that the buildings on his
campus are modern, well planned,
and more than adequate. The mod
ern living units on the campus im
pressed Dr. Kot. He feels that even
the students' newspaper is well ed
ited and alive and is conducive to
college life.
The large number of Stanford stu
dents who assist themselves finan
cially in school by taking part-time
employment surprised Professor
Kot. The student here can, with a
part-time job, earn $20 a week, but
a Parisian with full-time employ
ment in a position comparable to a
student's part-time job earns ap
proximately $80 a month. A part
time job in Paris would be of neg
ligible benefit to a student.
NO UPRISING
Dr. Kot feels that anything that
can be said, in a short interview,
about the problems of peoples un
der the domination of Soviet Rus
sia would be superficial. But "forget
about a Polish uprising," he advises.
"It would be impossible under the
Soviet system. The police state does

not allow people to form a group
capable of a revolution."
Professor Kot pointed out the his
torical basis for this opinion. "Rev
olutions are not conducted by peo
ple dying from hunger.
"None of the revolutions in the
past were directed by people who
were hungry and who lived on the
lowest material level. All of the
revolutions of the past were organ
ized and led by people who had
a certain standard of life which gave
them the strength and vigor neces
sary to undertake a mass uprising.

The large number of Stanford stu
dents who assist themselves finan
cially in school by taking part-time
employment surprised Professor
Kot. The student here can, with a
part-time job, earn $20 a week, but
a Parisian with full-time employ
ment in a position comparable to a
student's part-time job earns ap
proximately $80 a month. A part
time job in Paris would be of neg
ligible benefit to a student.
NO UPRISING
Dr. Kot feels that anything that
can be said, in a short interview,
about the problems of peoples un
der the domination of Soviet Rus
sia would be superficial. But "forget
about a Polish uprising," he advises.
"It would be impossible under the
Soviet system. The police state does

not allow people to form a group
capable of a revolution."
Professor Kot pointed out the his
torical basis for this opinion. "Rev
olutions are not conducted by peo
ple dying from hunger.
"None of the revolutions in the
past were directed by people who
were hungry and who lived on the
lowest material level. All of the
revolutions of the past were organ
ized and led by people who had
a certain standard of life which gave
them the strength and vigor neces
sary to undertake a mass uprising.
"In the Soviet system it is only
the bureaucracy which has strength
and vigor, but being the privileged
class, it has no interest in producing
a revolution."
In speaking of Soviet bureaucracy
being a privileged class, Dr. Kot
commented that "the classless so
ciety is a lie. The chasm between
the working classes and the ruling
class is real and great."
"All nations presently dominated
by the Russian Soviet system," ac
cording to Dr. Kot, "are dissatisfied
and are opposed to this rule not
only as a social and economic in
justice to them, but also because it
imposes Russian domination upon
them, to which they are basically
antagonistic."
Dr. Kot was professor of history
at the University of Krakow be
tween the two world wars—l9lB to
1939. He was one of the leaders of
the Polish Peasant party. He is now
living in Paris where he is a repre
sentative of the International Peas
ant party.
In addition to searching for his
personal correspondence, he is in
the United States looking for some
of his sources pertaining' to social
and cultural ideas of the lGth and
17th centuries. These sources were,
in recent years, transferred from
Europe to the United States and are
now in the collections of American
libraries. He located some of this
material in the Starr King School
Library in' Berkeley.
His visit to the United Sattes was

made possible by the Rockefeiler
Foundation and he has stated that
that he is "very grateful to them"
for their sponsorship.
The vagaries of an unsettled
world have brought Dr. Stanis
law Kot to Stanford. Dr. Kot,
wartime Polish ambassador in
Moscow in 1941 and 1942, has
come to the Hoover Institute and
Library to search the archives
for his own correspondence of
his Moscow period, which was
brought to this country follow
ing World War 11.
The fact that his search for his
papers has led him to the Hoover
Library is proof, in Professor Kot's
opinion, of the importance in the
world of this library.
The campus tower houses the
most unique collection of its kind.
Dr. Kot's only disappointment with
the library is the lack of organiza
tion within its archives. He feels
that a collection of this importance
warrants any appropriation neces
sary to maintain adequate catalog
ing and organization.
Dr. Kot js Lmp,i;essl?d with the
American sttideiit. He said that the
young people he has seen on the
Stanford campus "are very fortu
nate, that they appear healthy and
well fed, are well dressed and neat
in appearance." This is not the case
with the European student.
"Generally," said Dr. Kot, "the
European student looks poor and
underfed. His clothes are poor—his
complexion is not good."
MORE CONCENTRATION
He was equally impressed by the
Stanford campus. "It is a very fine
campus, far from the city life." This
rural atmosphere, he feels, "allows
for the concentration of efforts" to
a greater degree than do most Eu
ropean campuses which are, for the
most part, located in cities.
Again, the Stanford student is for
tunate in that the buildings on his
campus are modern, well planned,
and more than adequate. The mod
ern living units on the campus im
pressed Dr. Kot. He feels that even
the students' newspaper is well ed
ited and alive and is conducive to
college life.
