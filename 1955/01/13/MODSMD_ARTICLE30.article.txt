# NCAA Eases Grid Sub Rule
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 12 (UP)â€”Col
lege football rulesmakers softened
up the substitution rule today and
passed five other changes designed
to make the game as efficient as pos
sible without going back to the two
platoon system.
After three days of debate, an
NCAA committee headed by Her
bert O. (Fritz) Crisler of Micihgan
accepted a proposal by the nation's
coaches to permit players who start
each period to leave the game and
return once in each period, thus do
ing away with the so-called "four
minute" segment in effect in the
second and fourth periods under the
old rule.
In other actions, they changed the
signal for a fair catch, allowed the
ball-holder on field goal or conver
sion attempts to run, kick, or pass
the ball if he wants to, revised the
"tackle eligible" forward pass rule,
outlawed the "hide-out" or "sleep
er" play, and allowed a change in
cleats to permit rounded instead of
fiat ends if desired.
By allowing the ball-holder on
kicks, other than kickoffs, to run,
kick, or pass the ball, the committee
opened the way for new strategy.
The old rule stipulated that the
ball-holder, if he crouched with one
kne touching the ground, had to
spot the ball for a kick or be de
clared down at teh spot his knee
touched.
The change in the "tackle eligible"
rule was a clarification of a confus
ing issue. In the future, any line
man will be eligible to receive a for
ward pass if he lines up on the end
of a line and none of his teammates
takes up a position closer to the
sidelines than he, regardless of how
far behifid the line of scrimmage the
other player may be.
