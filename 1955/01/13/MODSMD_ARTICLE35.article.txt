# MURAL CAGE
## V-306 Whips V-312,27-9 
### JIM PIGOTT 
In an all-Village intramural bas
ketball game in the Pavilion last
night, 306 showed too much polish
and height for their rivals from 312
and went on to score an easy 27 to 9
triumph.
The winners jumped out in front
early and went on to lead 13 to 4
at the half. Jim Sides, Stan Bow
man, and Tom Kelley all contrib
uted two-pointeds to the cause.
The same procedure followed in
the second stanza with Sides and
Mike Forman leading the way for
306.
Eel Barlow did all the early scor
ing for the losers but could get no
help until Gerry Eller sank a long
one-hander late in the game. It was
clearly a matter of too little and
too late for 312 as Bowman and
Sides cleared both backboards and
passed to fast-breaking teammates
for lay-ups.
