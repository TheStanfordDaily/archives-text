# LIQUOR, TOBACCO
## Knight Asks California Tax Raise 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 12 (UP)
—Gov. Goodwin J. Knight asked
today for a three-cent a pack tax
on cigarettes and higher beer,
liquor and racing levies to bal
ance a record $1,529,768,000
state budget.
"We cannot postpone any longer
the unpleasant responsibility of in
creasing revenues without jeopar
dizing the state's solvency," Knight
warned lawmakers as he asked a
total of $80,200,000 in new and high
er "luxury" taxes.
But comments of key legislators
showed the Governor's tax program
had a rocky road ahead, particularly
in the Senate. They said the budget
could be balanced without new
taxes by exercise of economy and
use of current reserves.
OTHER TOBACCO TAX
In addition to the three-cent, ciga
rette tax, Knight asked a 20 per cent
tax on other tobacco products. The
two measures together would net
the state about $57,000,000 a year.
The Governor proposed to almost
double liquor taxes, asking they be
boosted from 80 cents a gallon to
$1.50 to produce $140,00,000 in new
revenue. He asked the present two
cent-a-gallon beer tax be doubled
to bring in $3,600,000 a year in addi
tional revenue.
BUDGET INCREASE
The Governor's record • budget
was up 3.8 per cent from the cur
rent year, an increase of $56,476,000.
But he called it a "realistic budget
calling for strict economy."
The Governor told the Legislature
in his budget message that unless he
ot. the new taxes the budget would
be running about $100,000,000 in the
red.
Knight admitted that by using
up the $130,000,000 remaining in re
serve funds the budget, could be bal
anced without new taxes.
•UNSOUND MANAGEMENT'
"This' would be unsound fiscal
management," Knight said. "It would
leave the state without any cush
ion whatsoever to meet even a small
business slump or slight failure to
forecast revenues accurately."
Governor Knight's budget called
for the smallest increase in 10 years
for operation of eight campuscs of
the University of California.
The university's operations budget
totaled $Bfi,. r >B2,fio7. Of this amount,
$62,539,152 was asked from state
funds, $24,04-7,455 from university
revenues, and $2,077,880 from uni
versity reserves.
