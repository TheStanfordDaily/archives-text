IT'LL LOOK LIKE NEW—Cam Strong, and Eckart Rottka, a stu
dent from the Free University of Berlin, apply a coat of pome
granate paint to the back wall of the Institute of International
Relations. Members of the lIR have worked in concerted effort
to renovate their offices, formerly known as "the Shack." Other
walls have been painted grey, and desk tops and chairs are
now a shiny ebony black. Curtains are also planned.
