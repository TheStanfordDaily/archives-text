# President Asks Congress For Draft Law Extension, New 'Voluntary' Reserve
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13. (UP)—President Eisenhower asked
Congress today to extend the draft four years, set up a "voluntary"
reserve training program for youths 17 and 18 years old, and raise
military pay an average of G.7 percent.
The President sent the House and Senate a massive military

program designed to help "dispel the
shadow of Communist threat." He
said he saw nothing either in "the
International situation or techno
logical advances" that would permit
an earlier end to the draft.
Members of Congress generally
approved the draft extension and the
proposed military pay boost. But, as
in the past, many voiced reserva
tions about the reserve plan, which
they regarded as at least a start to
ward universal military training.
Mr. Eisenhower's "national reserve
plan," which the administration
carefully refrained from calling
U"MT, calls for youths 17 and 18 to
Volunteer for six months basic train
ing followed by o'/•> years compuls
ory service in the reserves.
ADEQUATE' NUMBER
If an "adequate" number of young
men do not volunteer, he said the
armed services should be given au
thority to draft youths between 18Vz
ancf* 19 to fill out the program. The
pefense Department wants 100,000
men a year to get the plan underway.
Not all servicemen would share
in Mr. Eisenhower's military pay
raise program which, together with
the reserve plan, was spelled out in
two special messages to the House
and Senate.
Senate Democratic Leader Lyndon
B. Johnson (Tex.) said the Presi
dent's double - barreled program
means that Congress must "face up
to the military manpower issue." He
said Mr. Eisenhower's proposals
should receive "early consideration."
Johnson, a member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, led the
unsuccessful fight in .1951 for Con
gressional adoption of a UMT plan.
The plan was approved by the Sen
ate but rejected by the House — a
likely fate for Mr. Eisenhower's new
proposal.
Chairman Carl Vinson (D. Ga.) of
the House Armed Services Commit
tee voiced immediate reservations
about the reserve program. He
promised only that it would be giv
en "most careful study." Vinson
favored the draft extension and
"strongly endorsed" a military pay
raise.
Senator Leverctt Saltonstall (R,
Mass.), top Republican on the Sen
ate group said the reserve plan
"forms a strong basis" for building
up trained reserves. He termed it
"one of the most vital things we
must accomplish this year."
PAY RAISE COST
The President's pay raise plan
would cost an estimated $750,000,-
000 on the basis of men and women
now in service. Defense officials said
improved fringe benefits also recom
mended by Mr. Eisenhower for serv
icemen would add another $1,000,-
000,000 a year.
However, the latter cost would be
ju';t about offset by savings from
the Administration's planned reduc
tion in military manpower strength.
About 300.000 men are to be trimmed
from the active armed forces by the
middle of next year.
Mr. Eisenhower emphasized that
the two-year draft term must be
continued. Some Senators have
talked of cutting it to 18 months.
But Mr. Eisenhower said shorten
ing the term would "seriously dam
age the combat readiness of our ac
tive forces."
