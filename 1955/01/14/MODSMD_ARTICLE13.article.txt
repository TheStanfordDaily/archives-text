# Row Pledge Card Signing Is Tomorrow
## 
### 
The formal fraternity rushing
season winds up tomorrow after
noon with official pledge card
signing and dinners at each of
the 24 Row houses.
The end of the officially desig
nated rushing period under the reg
ulations of the Interfraternity Coun
cil does not mean that all, rushing
will come to a stop. Many houses
will still be rushing and pledging
the rest of the year, but on a smaller
scale.
The eating clubs will not have
formal pledge card signing this week
but their rushing program will con
tinue just as it has this week with
invitational meals and parties.
Both fraternity and eating club
men will be allowed in the halls of
freshmen dorms today only during
the hours of 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
and 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. This is
the last day the rule will be in ef
fect.
However, the no-contact rule will
be in effect again tomorrow until
5:30 p.m. This restriction on fratern
ity-freshmen contact is to allow the
frosh a day to decide about pledging
without fraternity men around. This
regulation was passed by the IFC
last quarter.
Tomorrow most houses will treat
the new pledge classes to a banquet
style dinner and then have formal
pledge card signing with a member
of the faculty present to supervise
the official act.
Monday The Daily will publish its
annual rushing edition which will
ILst all the pledges of the 24 fratern
ities and the seven eating clubs.
