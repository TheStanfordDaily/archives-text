## Rebel Forces Are Reported To Be Fleeing 
### 
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica, Jan. 13
(UP â€” President Jose Figueres
said today that Rebel forces who
attacked his government three
days ago are fleeing toward
Nicaragua and now hold only
Iwo towns, both near the Nica
raguan border.
He promised the country would
be cleared of the insurgents shortly.
The towns still in rebel hands
were Puerto Soley and Penas Blan
cas, both near the frontier on the
Pacific Coast.
Fighting between government and
rebel forces virtually ceased as a
five-nation five-nation inter-Ameri
can Commission began an investi
gation into Costa Rican charges that
Nicaragua and Venezuela had engi
neered and backed the attack.
10,000 VOLUNTEERS
Figueres was reported to have
10,000 volunters ready to resist his
foes. But the rebels, driven out of
their main base at Villa Quesada,
some 50 miles from this capital city,
were reported in full retreat to
ward the Nicaraguan border.
Commercial air services were re
sumed. Business and other activi
ties in San Jose were back to nor
mal.
Government sources said loyal
forces were ready to launch mop
ping-up operations against the last
rebel pockets in the Puerto Soley-
Penas Blancas areas, a few miles
from the Nicaraguan border.
PRECAUTIONS TAKEN
Although the possibility of re
newed enemy air attacks was be
lieved remote while the 15-man Or
ganization of American States
(OAS) commission was sitting here,
the government took no chances.
A "brown - out" was ordered in
San Jose as a precaution. Outside
lights and electric signs were or
dered turned off. Newspapers pub
lished air raid instructions for ci
vilians throughout the country.
PRAISES U.S. ACTION
The government sources said the
sudden end of bombing of open
cities from abroad has undoubtedly
resulted from the dispatch here of
observation planes from the United
States and other countries.
Officials expressed appreciation to
the United States for prompt action
in making military planes from Pan
ama available to the OAS.
Costa Rican President Jose Figue
res today rejected Nicaraguan Pres
ident Anastasio Somoza's suggestion
that they settle their differences
with a pistol duel on the border.
Somoza, the Nicaraguan army's
rifle and pistol champion, issued the
challenge last night, after charging
that Figueres had "lied" in accusing
Nicaragua of backing the attack on
Costa Rica.
