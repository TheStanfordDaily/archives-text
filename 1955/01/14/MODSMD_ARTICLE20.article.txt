# Cards' 'Iron Man' Five To Battle Bears in Pair
## McKeen Aiming for Luisetti's Mark; Friend Doubtful Starter for Cal 
### DON WEBSTER Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford's basketball team—the "Iron Men"—travel to Berke
ley tonight to meet the University of California cagers—"Snow
White" and the Four Dwarfs"—in the opening contest of a home
and-home series with the Bears.
Starting time both tonight and tomorrow night at the Stanford

►Pavilion is 8:30.
The game will mark the first
meeting, coaching-wise, of the PCC's
two new mentors—Stanford's Howie
Dallmar and Cal's Pete Newell.
Though neither has a team favored
to win the Southern Division, both
have top - notch clubs and either
could be the dark horse victor.
Though the Bears dropped a pair
of games last weekend to USC, they
are nevertheless a strong club. Ac
cording to Newell, the only poor
basketball his team played was in
the first half of the first game. Sat
urday evening, the Bears were sim
ply overpowered by blistering Tro
jan shooting. The victors hit 18 field
goals in 23 attempts for a 78.3 per
centage.
'SNOW WHITE 1
"Snow White," of course, refers to
All-American candidate Bob Mc-
Keen. The 6-7 center was a second-

string All-American as a sophomore,
and has been All-League two years
running. He dominated Bear scor
ing last season with 431 points.
He tallied 30 points against the
Trojans Friday night, and is now
only 24 points away from Hank Lui
setti's all-time PCC scoring record
of 613 points. He seems certain to
break it either tonight or tomorrow.
McKeen holds the Bears together
as a team. From the post position ho
has a good shot with either hand, is
an excellent feeder to other players,
and is the club's top rebounder. If
McKeen can be stopped, Cal can be
stopped.
FRIEND INJURED
The quality of material drops con
siderably after McKeen. The only
other outstanding player, sophomore
forward Larry Friend, is injured
and is supposed to see only limited
action.
Friend is a transfer from Los An
geles City College. He injured his
right ankle , against USC Saturday,
and according to reports from Ber
keley f'Avorj't be operating at full
tilt. 1 ' J..'.*
