# Cards' 'Iron Man' Five To Battle Bears in Pair
## McKeen Aiming for Luisetti's Mark; Friend Doubtful Starter for Cal 
### DON WEBSTER Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford's basketball team—the "Iron Men"—travel to Berke
ley tonight to meet the University of California cagers—"Snow
White" and the Four Dwarfs"—in the opening contest of a home
and-home series with the Bears.
Starting time both tonight and tomorrow night at the Stanford

►Pavilion is 8:30.
The game will mark the first
meeting, coaching-wise, of the PCC's
two new mentors—Stanford's Howie
Dallmar and Cal's Pete Newell.
Though neither has a team favored
to win the Southern Division, both
have top - notch clubs and either
could be the dark horse victor.
Though the Bears dropped a pair
of games last weekend to USC, they
are nevertheless a strong club. Ac
cording to Newell, the only poor
basketball his team played was in
the first half of the first game. Sat
urday evening, the Bears were sim
ply overpowered by blistering Tro
jan shooting. The victors hit 18 field
goals in 23 attempts for a 78.3 per
centage.
'SNOW WHITE 1
"Snow White," of course, refers to
All-American candidate Bob Mc-
Keen. The 6-7 center was a second-

string All-American as a sophomore,
and has been All-League two years
running. He dominated Bear scor
ing last season with 431 points.
He tallied 30 points against the
Trojans Friday night, and is now
only 24 points away from Hank Lui
setti's all-time PCC scoring record
of 613 points. He seems certain to
break it either tonight or tomorrow.
McKeen holds the Bears together
as a team. From the post position ho
has a good shot with either hand, is
an excellent feeder to other players,
and is the club's top rebounder. If
McKeen can be stopped, Cal can be
stopped.
FRIEND INJURED
The quality of material drops con
siderably after McKeen. The only
other outstanding player, sophomore
forward Larry Friend, is injured
and is supposed to see only limited
action.
Friend is a transfer from Los An
geles City College. He injured his
right ankle , against USC Saturday,
and according to reports from Ber
keley f'Avorj't be operating at full
tilt. 1 ' J..'.*
Stanford's Coach Dailmar is skop-
tieul of such reports, however. The
lust such injury notice from CuJ
was last week, when McKeen was
supposed to be suffering from both
wrist and leg injuries received in
the East. That night he scored 30
points against Troy.
If Friend is really injured seri
ously, his place will be taken by one
of two players: Bob Brown or Ev
McKeen (Bob McKeen's little broth
er, in more ways than one).
Junior Bob Blake is the other

starling forward i'oi Cal. He was a
second-stringer last year, and is a
good rebounder for his compara
tively short size—6-2.
The Bear guards are Frank Hess,
r>-11, and Mike Diaz, a soph, also
5-11. Hess and McKeen are the only
returning regulars from last sea
son's Bear varsity.
The Indian quintet was impressive
last weekend in splitting a pair of
tilts with powerful UCLA. The first
night., Stanford's starting five played
the entire game to down the sur
prised visitors. But on Saturday,
the Card cagers were weary from
the previous evening's effort, and
wilted in the stretch.
Bruin Coach Johnny Wooden
went home impressed with the team
he had split with. "Stanford has a
fine club,"he said, "and they could
well win the title. Guard Ron Tom
sic is a much better player than he
was two years ago. He doesn't shoot
as much, but he's more of a team
man. They can beat anybody."
Tomsic has now scored 195 points
in 10 games, for an average of close
to 20 points per contest. He is joined
at the guard spots with little George
Selleck. Though Selleck isn't scor
ing as much this year as last, he's
still a great leader.
"He changes our players from five
individuals to one team." Coach
Dallmar commented. "He'.; worth
much more to us than the score
board indicates."
Another Indian who drew praise
from Wooden was center Russ Law
ler. He will be given the assign
ment of guarding McKeen tonight.
Last season, Lawler was the league's
top scorer with 210 points (followed
by Selleck with 1911).

Russ was able to bucket only 21
points in two games last weekend.
These were ofl-night? for him,
thanks to a tight job of guarding—
legal and otherwise—by Bruin cen
ter Willie Naulls. Movies of the
tilts reveal Lawler was fouled more
than once on plays that were not
called.
Bill Bond is one of the Card for
wards. After u somewhat disap
pointing performance on the Eastern
trip over the Christmas holidays.
Bond really came into his own last
weekend by netting 13 field goals,
and now poses a definite scoring
threat for any opponent.
Barry Brown rounds out the
starting five. He is doing a good job
on the floor and on the boards, and
is also a definite asset to the In
dians.
The Cards want to win both games
this weekend. It's a shame the
game tonight isn't at Stanford,
where the Indians would have the
home court advantage. The Bears
will be conisderably easier to beat
tomorrow night if they have lost
three straight.
Five things, generally, spelled de
feat for Stanford last Saturday:
weariness, hot Bruin shooting, and
superior height, speed, and depth.
The Bears aren't as good shooters
as UCLA. They'll have some height
over the Cards, but not as much as
the Bruins. The Cal five lacks the
speed the Bruins had, and won't
fast-break Stanford to death.
And as for depth? Stanford, man
for man, seems to have a superior
first string to the Bears, and Cal
doesn't have any men on the bench
as good as their starters.
USC, the league leaders, travel to
UCLA to meet the Bruins, who are
deadly on their home court. About
all the Trojans can hope for is a
split. So if the Cards can take a
pair this v/eekend, who knows but
that they might be in first place
come Sunday?


SEEKING FIRST WlN—Pete Newell, Gal's' new hoop mentor,
will be after his first PCC triumph tonight when his Bears tangle
with the Cards. Newell's charges were dumped twice last week
by the defending champion USC Trojans. Newell formerly
coached at USF and Michigan State. His Don quintet of 1919
captured the championship of the National Invitational Tourna
ment in New York.
