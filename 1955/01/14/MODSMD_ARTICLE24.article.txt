# What Is Happening?

We had understood that the Special ASSU
Honor Code Study Committee—set up under
both Excom and Fundamental Standard Com
mittee and taking members from each—was
going to conduct student-participation discus
sions on Honor Code issues, beginning this
quarter. Most student interest has centered
around the question of taking examinations
from classrooms. We had expected the Spe
cial Committee to hold discussions on this is
sue at least, to inform the students, get their
ideas, and clarify their own thinking on the
matter.
The Special Committee has reached a tenta
tive conclusion on the examinations question
. . . and has said that it will take this tentative
choice directly to the faculty, for its approval,
before submitting it to student discussion.
Why? They have a good reason: The Hon
or Code was actually given to the students by
the faculty in an Academic Council motion in
1921, and the faculty has the power to take back
this privilege, virtually unique in its scope in
American universities.
But the faculty has told The Daily, and others
who have asked, that it will happily go along
with any good plan the students may bring up.

The problem has been that the original Honor
Code grant, built on the important notion of
third-person responsibility, did not anticipate
the taking of tests from the classroom. Crowded
conditions as the University has grown has
made it harder and harder to keep students in
small rooms for tests, so some sort of program
must be worked out . . . and the faculty has
put.it up to the students to decide.
Surely, with this vote of confidence in stu
dent judgement from the faculty, the Special
Committee could feel a little freer to make
known the nature of its proposals. The faculty
gave the student body the Honor Code, per
haps, but it has been the student body that has
made it work, and work well, for nearly thirty
four years. The students deserve to know what
is happening to their Honor Code. Faculty
approbation for whatever plan is adopted is
of course essential, but faculty approbation
must be supplemented and may even require
student approbation.
Here, as in other matters which have arisen
from time to time, we feel that there is no
reason why the students shouldn't know what is
going on, and we feel that the students have
every right to know . . . now.
