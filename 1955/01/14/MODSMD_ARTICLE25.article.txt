# Ideals in Action
## 
### 
When Stanford went through a long and
stormy battle on the pros and cons of joining
NSA, one of the charges most frequently
thrown against it was that of "idealism."
It was apparently felt that "idealistic" was
the exact opposite of "practical," and that the
one precluded any possibility of the other.
There were many mournful shakings of heads
and dire predictions that Stanford would gain
nothing from joining NSA.
The refutation of these prophecies came in
the last Executive Committee session, when
A 1 Loomis, NSA coordinator, outlined a list of
achievements and plans that shows that NSA's
goals have been translated into concrete action.
Stanford has been aided by discussions of
district universities on subjects such as elec
tion proceedures, foreign scholarship programs,
student-faculty committees, and leadership
training programs.
In the near future, Stanford will host the bi
annual NSA regional assembly, and there is the
possibility of Stanford being picked as the site
of the proposed Sub-Commission on Asian
Affairs.
Still in the planning stage are an officers'

training program to orient student leaders in the !
intracacies of ASSU government and a book-j
let listing aU scholarships available in Cali !
lornia. This pamphlet would be given to high
school to enter college.
For the 'travel minded', NSA has prepared a
wide range of low cost student tours, ranging
from special study groups to broad, all-inclusive I
trips.
A 1 Loomis has presented a list of accomplish
ments and plans that we can well point to with
pride. But presentation is not enough.
Now the ball has been thrown to Stanford
students.
To accomplish these plans needs more than 1
the work of one man. It needs the backing of
every Stanford student â€”and it needs the as
sistance of many students who will do more !
than just support.
Workers will be needed for the May regional i
assembly. Helpers will be required to utilize
to the fullest the NSA travel information.
With Stanford actively behind NSA, we pre
dict that this students' organization will illus
trate our belief that ideals can be effectively
channeled into action.
