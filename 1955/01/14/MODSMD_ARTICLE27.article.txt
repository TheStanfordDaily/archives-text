Stanford's accomplishments
and plans as a member of the
National Students Association
were discussed by A 1 Loomis.
NSA coordinator, at Wednesday
night's Executive Committee
; session.

mentioned were the regional NSA
i assembly, scheduled to be held at

I schools of the region will be invited,
' and a regional president for the
coming year will be elected.
'112 he possibility that Stanford

posed Sub - Commission on Asian
| Affairs was also brought up by Loo
! mis.

Two'projects which Loomis sug-
I gested might be handled by NSA
| are the establishment of an officers'
i training program for campus lead
! ers and the compilation of a list of,
[ available scholarships in the area,
j This list would be drawn up for the
! benefit of high school students
thinking ol going to college.
The informational value of the
I NSA to district members wak
j stressed by Loomis. who told Excom
I members about recent discussions
held at Ca!, Stanford, and Mills,
j Subjects under discussion have been
i election procedures, foreign schol-
J arship programs, leadership train-
I ing programs, and student - faculty
: committees.
NSA TOURS
Jim Sammiet, NSA regional travel
| director, explained to Excom some
j ol the advantages of the NSA tours,
i He said that they cost less than oth
! er tours, and gave more complete
j coverage of smaller areas, special
-1 izing in the tri-nation tour. More
free lime was allowed to the lour
i ist, and the guides were not older
j people, but students from the coun
try being visited.
Discussion followed on the rela
tion of NSA to Excom. Steve Voy
kovich was appointed to find out
from the law school whether the
appointment of the NSA eo-ordina
tor as an ex-officio member of Ex
com would entail simply a by-ktw
revision or an alteration of the AS
SU Constitution.
APPOINTMENT
After an executive session, Excom
approved the appointment of Eric
Fricker as Election Board chairman.
Pete Bing pointed out to Excom
members that his decision to re
turn elections to the control of Elec
tion Board was based on a letter
from Anne Powell, retiring chair
man of Election Board, which slated
that Axe Society was not large
enough or strong enough to handle
elections alone.
This statement was disputed by
Sammet, Axe Society member, who
claimed that Axe Society had done
a good job on the last election and
had gathered momentum for the
next. With Election -Board handling
elections, he held, the whole pro
cedure would have to be begun
over again.
After the appointment was ap
! proved, Sam Palmer said that Axe
Society would be at the disposal of
I Election Board for any help in the
I next election.
Bob Gable brought to the atten
tion of Excom the matter of a Cin
emascope screen for the Sunday
Flicks, whose present screen is now
j 17 vears old and has a yellowed
surface. A new 33 x 22-foot wide
[ flat screen would cost between $1,800
J and $2,069, according to Gable's es
timation.

APPOINTMENT
After an executive session, Excom
approved the appointment of Eric
Fricker as Election Board chairman.
Pete Bing pointed out to Excom
members that his decision to re
turn elections to the control of Elec
tion Board was based on a letter
from Anne Powell, retiring chair
man of Election Board, which slated
that Axe Society was not large
enough or strong enough to handle
elections alone.
This statement was disputed by
Sammet, Axe Society member, who
claimed that Axe Society had done
a good job on the last election and
had gathered momentum for the
next. With Election -Board handling
elections, he held, the whole pro
cedure would have to be begun
over again.
After the appointment was ap
! proved, Sam Palmer said that Axe
Society would be at the disposal of
I Election Board for any help in the
I next election.
Bob Gable brought to the atten
tion of Excom the matter of a Cin
emascope screen for the Sunday
Flicks, whose present screen is now
j 17 vears old and has a yellowed
surface. A new 33 x 22-foot wide
[ flat screen would cost between $1,800
J and $2,069, according to Gable's es
timation.

I gested might be handled by NSA

i training program for campus lead
! ers and the compilation of a list of,
[ available scholarships in the area,
j This list would be drawn up for the
! benefit of high school students
thinking ol going to college.
The informational value of the
I NSA to district members wak

Jim Sammiet, NSA regional travel

j ol the advantages of the NSA tours,

-1 izing in the tri-nation tour. More
free lime was allowed to the lour
i ist, and the guides were not older
j people, but students from the coun
try being visited.
Discussion followed on the rela
tion of NSA to Excom. Steve Voy
kovich was appointed to find out

tor as an ex-officio member of Ex
com would entail simply a by-ktw
revision or an alteration of the AS
SU Constitution.
