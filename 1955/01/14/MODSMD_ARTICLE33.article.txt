A new design becomes
a production ..reality

So great was 1 he departure in design of the
new Hell System wire spring relay as com
pared with conventional relays that it posed
a major undertaking for development en
gineers at Western Electric, the manufac
turing and supply unit of the Bell System.
Indeed, it was an undertaking that called
tor new machines and new methods be
cause none was available to do the job.
Longer life, higher operating speed,
lower power consumption, and lower man
ufacturing cost were some of the advan
tages promised by the new relay design.
Engineers reasoned that a lower manufac
turing cost could be achieved through
greater precision in manufacture (which
would cut adjustments) and through ex
tensive use ol automatic processes.
One of the products of this reasoning is
pictured at the top of this page. This bat
tery of equipment, developed by Western
Electric product engineers, constitutes one
phase of wire sorinti relav manufacture.

which automatically performs several separate op
erations. lis function begins after one of the funda
mental elements ol the new relay has been fabri
cated. I his element, known as a "comb," consists of
a multiplicity of small diameter wires in parallel ar
ray imbedded lor part of their length in molded
phenol plastic.
These molded elements, of which there arc two
types used in the new relay, are delivered to this
line of machine units in magazines. By fully auto
matic means they are removed from the magazine,
carried by a reciprocating conveyor through each
»>l the several processes and, when completed,
placed into another magazine to await further as
sembly.
Between the first and final magazine the auto
matic battery ol equipment does the following

operations: clips wire ends, attaches palladium con
tacts to wire ends by means of percussion welding,
sizes contacts, forms terminal, tension bends wires,
fluxes and tins terminals.
Most remarkable of all is the fact that this is a
precision operation throughout. I or example, the
.small block contacts, which are percussion welded
to the tips of wires of one type of "comb," must be
located on the same plane across the twelve con
tact positions to within a tolerance of .002".
