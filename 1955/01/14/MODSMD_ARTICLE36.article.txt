## Weight Lifting Bolsters Students' Idle Muscles 
### MICHAEL McGINNIS 
Some Stanford students are born athletes—ready for football or
a spot of tennis at any time. Some students ara 97-pound booklings
and are content to stay hidden in the stacks. Mo3t students are
merely discontented!
One of the biggest complaints Stanford students have is t,hat

they don't have time to take Physi-
cal Education classes or keep them
.
selves in shape. Weight lifting has !
become the answer for many stu- [
dents.
Now don't, laugh. You are prob
ably thinking that this .sport is Strict
ly for the Muscle Beach boys, but
you couldn't be further from the
truth. Ernest P. "Husky" Hunt, as
sociate professor of physical educa
tion who instructs the department's
weight lifting classes, calls overde
veloped muscles "silly, ridiculous,
and just a big show-off."
Weight fitting has a lot of advant
ages for college students. It is a
quiet, slow sport which can be per
formed at the time and place that
the lifter desires, usually for one
hour, three times a week. II the
equipment is owned jointly by a
group of students, a convenient
work-out is usually arranged. |
''Husky" Hunt, when interviewed, j
estimated that there are twenty'
sets of weights on campus, at least. J
Another advantage i.- that so much
physical benefit is received for so j
little effort. Coach Hunt says, "If
you do the lift you just can't miss
building yourself up." "It is me- !
chanical," he adds, "like crew, but
has a little more variety than the
water sport. 1 have had fellas put
on as much as fifteen pounds in a
school year "
APPEALS TO WOMEN ALSO
Weight work-outs are an all-over
body conditioner —for both men and
women. The circulation is quick
ened, fat is removed, and the ap
petite is sparked. The sport is pop
ular with those women who have
found that lifting takes it off and
puts it on in just the right places.
A popular but untrue belief is
that weight work does no more than
build up a few showy biceps. How
ever, little muscles that help keep
the body in good posture position
are built up also. And hidden mus- j
cles that hold the internal organs in [
place and make them function right i
are strengthened.
Another advantage is the quick
energy recovery that the lifter ex
periences after exercising, which
leaves the person fresh for ifce rest
of the day. Hardly any rfervous
energy is expended doing the lifts,
as happens in vigorous sports such
as basketball.
A set of weights is all that is
needed to start, your conditioning.
Equipment is sold by the pound, and j
the current price in the Bay Area I

is 25 cents. For about $27 a lull out
lil can bo purchased, which includes
..wo dumbbells, a bar, clamps, and'
.he weiahts. At this price the over- ;
ill weight is 110 pounds, which is
plenty for a beginner to start with. I
As the lifter gets stronger, more '
weights can be purchased in l'/j, 2Vi, ,
5, 10, and 25 pound sizes.
Learning to lift is easy. There are '
two things you must know: (1) how
to breathe correctly, and (2) the cor
rect form for each exercise.
Exercises are chosen, so that each
will develop different sets of muscles. |
"Curls" build' up the biceps and
forearms. "Militarys" build up the I
back of the arms (triceps), shoul- 1
ders, and back. The "bench press" j
develops the chest and back. Dumb
bells can be used to exercise almost
any muscle.
WORKOUTS EXPLAINED
A workout is done in sets. A set
is a pair of ten consecutive lifts with
about five minutes rest in between.,
Some lifters prefer three repetitions
of eight, while others work harder j
with three repetitions of ten. An
average workout consists of an hour's
time spent doing one set each of
four or five different exercises.
Those individuals with bay win
dows should do all the sit-ups they
can handle, along with their lifting.
The sport of lifting is for men and
women with little time. After you
are in shape regular lifting is not
necessary, but the beginner should
work every 48 hours. Some great
lifters lay off for a month or two
and then start in again to find they
can break their previous records.
FAT REPLACED BY MUSCLE
What lifting does to the body is
tear down old fat and muscle tissue
and rebuild it with new muscle. This
is why there must be one day of rest
between exercises, in order that the
body may rebuild.
Weight lifting is anybody's sport.
It can be worked at your house or
dormitory at your convenience. But
must important of all, it is a good
way to safeguard your health when
it seems like there just isn't enough
time to spend on it.

Weight work-outs are an all-over
body conditioner —for both men and
women. The circulation is quick
ened, fat is removed, and the ap
petite is sparked. The sport is pop
ular with those women who have
found that lifting takes it off and
puts it on in just the right places.
A popular but untrue belief is
that weight work does no more than
build up a few showy biceps. How
ever, little muscles that help keep
the body in good posture position
are built up also. And hidden mus- j
cles that hold the internal organs in [
place and make them function right i
are strengthened.
Another advantage is the quick
energy recovery that the lifter ex
periences after exercising, which
leaves the person fresh for ifce rest
of the day. Hardly any rfervous
energy is expended doing the lifts,
as happens in vigorous sports such
as basketball.
A set of weights is all that is
needed to start, your conditioning.
Equipment is sold by the pound, and j
the current price in the Bay Area I

is 25 cents. For about $27 a lull out
lil can bo purchased, which includes
..wo dumbbells, a bar, clamps, and'
.he weiahts. At this price the over- ;
ill weight is 110 pounds, which is
plenty for a beginner to start with. I
As the lifter gets stronger, more '
weights can be purchased in l'/j, 2Vi, ,
5, 10, and 25 pound sizes.
Learning to lift is easy. There are '
two things you must know: (1) how
to breathe correctly, and (2) the cor
rect form for each exercise.
Exercises are chosen, so that each
will develop different sets of muscles. |
"Curls" build' up the biceps and
forearms. "Militarys" build up the I
back of the arms (triceps), shoul- 1
ders, and back. The "bench press" j
develops the chest and back. Dumb
bells can be used to exercise almost
any muscle.
WORKOUTS EXPLAINED
A workout is done in sets. A set
is a pair of ten consecutive lifts with
about five minutes rest in between.,
Some lifters prefer three repetitions
of eight, while others work harder j
with three repetitions of ten. An
average workout consists of an hour's
time spent doing one set each of
four or five different exercises.
Those individuals with bay win
dows should do all the sit-ups they
can handle, along with their lifting.
The sport of lifting is for men and
women with little time. After you
are in shape regular lifting is not
necessary, but the beginner should
work every 48 hours. Some great
lifters lay off for a month or two
and then start in again to find they
can break their previous records.
FAT REPLACED BY MUSCLE
What lifting does to the body is
tear down old fat and muscle tissue
and rebuild it with new muscle. This
is why there must be one day of rest
between exercises, in order that the
body may rebuild.
Weight lifting is anybody's sport.
It can be worked at your house or
dormitory at your convenience. But
must important of all, it is a good
way to safeguard your health when
it seems like there just isn't enough
time to spend on it.
Some Stanford students are born athletes—ready for football or
a spot of tennis at any time. Some students ara 97-pound booklings
and are content to stay hidden in the stacks. Mo3t students are
merely discontented!
One of the biggest complaints Stanford students have is t,hat

they don't have time to take Physi-
cal Education classes or keep them
.
selves in shape. Weight lifting has !
become the answer for many stu- [
dents.
Now don't, laugh. You are prob
ably thinking that this .sport is Strict
ly for the Muscle Beach boys, but
you couldn't be further from the
truth. Ernest P. "Husky" Hunt, as
sociate professor of physical educa
tion who instructs the department's
weight lifting classes, calls overde
veloped muscles "silly, ridiculous,
and just a big show-off."
Weight fitting has a lot of advant
ages for college students. It is a
quiet, slow sport which can be per
formed at the time and place that
the lifter desires, usually for one
hour, three times a week. II the
equipment is owned jointly by a
group of students, a convenient
work-out is usually arranged. |
''Husky" Hunt, when interviewed, j
estimated that there are twenty'
sets of weights on campus, at least. J
Another advantage i.- that so much
physical benefit is received for so j
little effort. Coach Hunt says, "If
you do the lift you just can't miss
building yourself up." "It is me- !
chanical," he adds, "like crew, but

5, 10, and 25 pound sizes.
Learning to lift is easy. There are '
two things you must know: (1) how
to breathe correctly, and (2) the cor
rect form for each exercise.
Exercises are chosen, so that each
will develop different sets of muscles. |
"Curls" build' up the biceps and
forearms. "Militarys" build up the I
back of the arms (triceps), shoul- 1
ders, and back. The "bench press" j
develops the chest and back. Dumb
bells can be used to exercise almost
any muscle.
WORKOUTS EXPLAINED
A workout is done in sets. A set
is a pair of ten consecutive lifts with
about five minutes rest in between.,
Some lifters prefer three repetitions
of eight, while others work harder j
with three repetitions of ten. An
average workout consists of an hour's
time spent doing one set each of
four or five different exercises.
Those individuals with bay win
dows should do all the sit-ups they
can handle, along with their lifting.
The sport of lifting is for men and
women with little time. After you
are in shape regular lifting is not
necessary, but the beginner should
work every 48 hours. Some great
lifters lay off for a month or two
and then start in again to find they
can break their previous records.
FAT REPLACED BY MUSCLE
What lifting does to the body is
tear down old fat and muscle tissue
and rebuild it with new muscle. This
is why there must be one day of rest
between exercises, in order that the
body may rebuild.
Weight lifting is anybody's sport.
It can be worked at your house or
dormitory at your convenience. But
must important of all, it is a good
way to safeguard your health when
it seems like there just isn't enough
time to spend on it.
Some Stanford students are born athletes—ready for football or
a spot of tennis at any time. Some students ara 97-pound booklings
and are content to stay hidden in the stacks. Mo3t students are
merely discontented!
One of the biggest complaints Stanford students have is t,hat

they don't have time to take Physi-
cal Education classes or keep them
.
selves in shape. Weight lifting has !
become the answer for many stu- [
dents.
Now don't, laugh. You are prob
ably thinking that this .sport is Strict
ly for the Muscle Beach boys, but
you couldn't be further from the
truth. Ernest P. "Husky" Hunt, as
sociate professor of physical educa
tion who instructs the department's
weight lifting classes, calls overde
veloped muscles "silly, ridiculous,
and just a big show-off."
Weight fitting has a lot of advant
ages for college students. It is a
quiet, slow sport which can be per
formed at the time and place that
the lifter desires, usually for one
hour, three times a week. II the
equipment is owned jointly by a
group of students, a convenient
work-out is usually arranged. |
''Husky" Hunt, when interviewed, j
estimated that there are twenty'
sets of weights on campus, at least. J
Another advantage i.- that so much
physical benefit is received for so j
little effort. Coach Hunt says, "If
you do the lift you just can't miss
building yourself up." "It is me- !
chanical," he adds, "like crew, but
has a little more variety than the
water sport. 1 have had fellas put
on as much as fifteen pounds in a
school year "
APPEALS TO WOMEN ALSO
Weight work-outs are an all-over
body conditioner —for both men and
women. The circulation is quick
ened, fat is removed, and the ap
petite is sparked. The sport is pop
ular with those women who have
found that lifting takes it off and
puts it on in just the right places.
A popular but untrue belief is
that weight work does no more than
build up a few showy biceps. How
ever, little muscles that help keep
the body in good posture position
are built up also. And hidden mus- j
cles that hold the internal organs in [
place and make them function right i
are strengthened.
Another advantage is the quick
energy recovery that the lifter ex
periences after exercising, which
leaves the person fresh for ifce rest
of the day. Hardly any rfervous
energy is expended doing the lifts,
as happens in vigorous sports such
as basketball.
A set of weights is all that is
needed to start, your conditioning.
