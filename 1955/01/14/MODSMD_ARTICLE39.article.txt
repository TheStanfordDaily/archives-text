# Boxing, Wrestling Teams Travel to Meet California
## Top Heavyweight Won't Participate 
### 
"The only trouble we have," la
ments Stanford Boxing Coach Ray
Lunny, "is that we can't schedule
enough matches for the team." Be
this as it may, Stanford boxers open
their season against Cal tomorrow
at 2:00 in the Men's Gym.
Heavyweight Bob Birkie, top box
er on the team, will not box be
cause Cal doesn't field a slugger
good enough to meet him. However,
Coach Lunny expects the boys who
will box to give a good account of
themselves.
Starting will be Bill Clark. 119
pounds; Bill Tolley, 125 pounds; Ken
Doyle, 125 pounds; Charles McLane,
132 pounds; and Dick Crockett, 1(55
pounds.
Lunny thinks that the team has a
good chance to win the PCC crown.
Birkie, (5-2'2, 225 pound junior, who
won five straight matches last year,
will be a major attraction in the
PCC tournament. Another top box
er is middleweight Eric Hansen. A
three-year letterman, Hanson has a
potent punch, good defensive skill,
and can hit effectively with either
hand.
Next week the team meets Cal
Poly at 8:00 in the Pavilion. During
these matches, Chan Griswold, 156
pound freshman, will meet a Cal
Poly varsity boxer in a no-decision,
exhibition bout. Lunny says that
Griswold is an excellent prospect.
After Cal Poly, the Stanford sched
ule includes Cal (Feb. 11), Cal (Feb.
15), Chico State (Feb. 18), and Santa
Clara (Feb. 24).
