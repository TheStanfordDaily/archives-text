# Village Sale Negotiations To Begin Soon
## 
### 
Negotiations to determine the
fate of the 85-acre Stanford Vil
lage area may begin Feb. 15, ac
cording to the federal govern
ment.
The question of who would get the
Village — Stanford, Menlo Park, or
other interested parties — has been
lip in the air since May, although
Menlo Park has bern trying to get
possession since 1949.
The government, which owns the
land, decided to dispose of it quite
a while ago. Disposal to whom,
however has been the big problem.
Stanford has priority to purchase the
lands it still needs for student hous
ing. Once this land is no longer
needed Stanford has promised to sell
the land for private development.
Thr Stanford Research Institute
is eager to purchase a permanent
site in the Village. It Is located
there now. If such a site is unavail
able, the SKI may move to the Stan
ford campus leaving Menlo Park
without a large industry.
The Public Housing Authority is
handling the disposal of the prop
erty. Just a while ago they prom
ised that negotiations would start
after an appraisal of the land was
made. The appraisal was completed,
but there was no action.
A second appraisal is being con
ducted now and is scheduled to be
finished by Feb. 1. John P. Currie,
deputy administrator of the PHA,
asserted that the government would
meet the Feb. 15 date and start ne
gotiations.
As far as Stanford is concerned
it still needs the Village for student
housing. The incoming freshmen
this fall will reside in the new frosh
dorm now under construction. The
Crothers extension will house en
gineering grads this fall. That will
take up a small part of the slack,
but there are still many single and
married students living in the area.
There has been some talk of using
Fncina for temporary grad student
housing, but thus far it has only
been talk.
