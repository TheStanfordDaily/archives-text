## 
### 
Under the direction of Bob Har
mon, the Stanford wrestling team
opens its season tomorrow afternoon
at Berkeley. The match will start at
2 o'clock.
Although they suffered the loss of
two of the top men from last year's
squad which won seven of 13
matches, Coach Harmon is still
hopeful for a successful, season.
The Indians will probably go into
this match with a disadvantage in
experience, since Harmon plans to
use five sophomores in the nine in
dividual matches tomorrow.
Only lettermen who will wrestle
tomorrow are Bob Fisher in the 123-
pound class and Bob Beatie in the
167-pound division.
The sophomores on whom Har
mon is counting so heavily are Pete
Likins, who was undefeated. as a
freshman last year, in the 137-
pound class; Hay Miller, who was
also unbeaten as a frosh a year ago,
in the 147-pound division; A 1 Laub
scher in the 157-pound class; Jerry
Beatie, who will wrestle in the 177-
pound division; and Don Manou
kian, the footballer, heavyweight.
Making up the rest of the Stan
ford lineup will be Jerry Lowell in
the 130 - pound class, while Stan
Hartmann may wrestle in place of
Laubscher.
Top Bear grunt and groaner is
captain Wayne Loucks. who wrestles
at 137 pounds. California is also es
pecially strong in the 147-pound and
157-pound divisions.
Stanford will be seeking its fourth
victory in its all-time wrestling se
ries with Cal. The Indian grapplers
have won three matches, lost 22, and
there have been two ties since the
schools first met on the mat in 1917.
