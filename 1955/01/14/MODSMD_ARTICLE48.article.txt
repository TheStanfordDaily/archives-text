# V-308 Wins Tilt
## 
### DICK MEISTER 
In a slow-moving intramural bas
ketball league game last night at
Stanford Pavilion, Village .'lOB de
feated an inexperienced Village 314
team,-24 to 11.
Tan minutes of the game had gone
by before V-308 managed to find the
basket and by half-time they had
.-.cored only three points ta V-314\s
10. Bill Taylor oi 308 led the scor
ing for the first half with six points.
All of 314's first period scoring was
done by Steve Schmieden
Taylor outclassed every man on
the court with his ball-handling and
sure eye. Only the inexperience
and lack of practice of his team
mates kept him from scoring in
double figures. One of Taylor's
mates, Boyd Futrel, al-o showed a
bit more than the u .ual intramural
kill, but, as with Taylor, was held
back by his slower - reacting and
slower-moving teammates.
The game sped up in the second
half but 303 continued to dominate
play with Taylor and Futrel con
stantly in 314's hair, if not with their

•coring, with their bull-hawking.
Despite the low score and the
slowness of the game, both clubs
tood out in play by their hustle.
1 he : lowness was because of inex
perience and lack of team practice
rather than from lack of spirit.
Total scoring as follows:
V-338—Taylor 10, Futrel 3, Bob
1 Ilcndrick 4, John Ching 3, Peryl Li
| iuno 4, Dan Holiday 0. Total—24.
V-3U Schmieder 3, Burt Fulk 4,
j A.l Anderson 2, D. Horn 2, Grey
Williams 0, J. Wy.ve 0, Cal Gogerty
!0. Total—ll.
Referee was Nairne Ward.
Another game scheduled for the
| Pavilion la t night was forfeited to
! Encina 2W 1 by Enema Basement 11,
j which failed to put a team on the
floor.
