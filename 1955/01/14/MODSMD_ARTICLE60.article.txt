# Stanford Physics Professor Wins Award for Research
## 
### 
The coveted Research Corpo
ration Award for Contribution to
Science will be presented next
week to a Stanford University
physicist, Professor Willis E.
Lamb Jr., according to an an
nouncement by Joseph W. Bar
ker, president and chairman of
the foundation.
Presentation of the award, in rec
ognition of Professor Lamb's major '
research achievements in atomic |
structure and quantum electrody
namics, will be made at the Research
Corporation's annual dinner in New J
York City on Jan. 18.
Dr. Lamb is the nineteenth scien
tist. to receive the honor. Previous
winners include Vanncvar Bush, Er
nest. O. Lawrence, Bruno Rossi, Ed
win M. McMillan, and Edward C.
Kendall.
The Research Corporation Award
consists of an honorarium of $2,500,
a pl.-'.que, and a citation describing I
the achievement.
The corporation is a non-profit j
foundation established in 1912 to I
advance scientific and technical I
knowledge. The first award was j
made in 1925, and awardees are
chosen by a committee of nine !
chemists, physicists, and engineers j
who are not connected with the
foundation.
Professor Lamb was born in Los
Angeles and received the B.S. and
Ph.D. degrees from the University of
California. He has taught at Co
lumbia and Harvard Universities,
and joined the Stanford faculty in
1951. He lives in Palo Alto.
Twice previously Professor Limb
has been honored for his work. In
1953 he won the Rumford Premium
of the American Academy of Arts
and Science from the University of
Pennsylvania.
His work attracted wide attention
from the scientific world in 1947 with
bis discovery of the "Lamb shift."
It established a deviation from the
previously accepted Dirac formula
for the fine structure of the hydro
gen atom, and measured the devia
tion precisely.
This research paved the way for

fresh consideration of quantun
electrodynamics by providing an
other important clue in the scare!
for understanding of the ultimate
composition of matter.
