# CHI PSIS GET 23
## Farm Fraternities Pledge 356 at Saturday Dinners 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Two weeks of hectic rushing—including open houses, parties,
i mud football games, and dinners—concluded Saturday night for
i Stanford's 24 national fraternities, and despite reportedly slow ac
] tion at the open houses, 356 rushees signed pledge cards.
This is an increase of 19 over last year's total of 337 pledged

when only d.i houses were rushing.
J The record number of 384 were
j pledged during the formal rushing
{ season of 1953.
The Chi Psi house corralled the 1
j largest number of pledges with 23. ;
Phi Kappa Pai was next with 20 and
Sigma Chi was third with 19. At. the
other end of the scale, Beta Theta
Pi and Phi Gamma Delta pledged
the fewest, nine each.
The average pledge class this year
totals 14.8 men. The average last
year was 14.7.
The pledge card signing, which
ended the formal rushing period,
was preceded by special pledge din
ners at each house Saturday.
For the fraternities, rushing this
year was shorter than it had been in
recent, years. Last year there were
seven open houses in a six-day pe
riod; this year five open houses were
held in four days.
Other major changes In rushing
procedure were the restricted '"vis- j
iting hours" in the freshman dorms j
and the no-contact rule which was
in effect Saturday until 5:30 p.m.
Eating clubs will continue rush- j
int; this week with more dinners and j
parties for rushees. The Daily will j
publish the list of club pledges later |
in the week. Fraternity pledges are
listed on pages 2 and 3.
