# Ike to Ask Congress for Further Deficit Spending
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 (UP)â€”President Eisenhower will pre
sent Congress tomorrow with a fiscal 1356 budget that provid
for another year of deficit spending under the pressures of a
uncertain peace.
The chief outlay will again be for what the President has calk

I "sufficient military strength
| productive capacity to discourage
resort to wat and protect our na
tion's vital interests."
To support this financial burden,
Congress will he asked to forego
I any new tax cuts and to postpone
some reductions scheduled to take
effect this spring.
But. evi n with revenue sustained
at present high levels, the govern
ment still will not be able to pay
all its bills without additional bor
rowing during the fiscal year be
ginning next. July 1.
Treasury Secretary George M.
j Humphrey indicated at a news con
ference last month that the gov
ernment. was trying to limit its red
ink spending to less than $3,000,000,-
000. The deficit for the current fiscal
year is expected to be about. $3,700,-
000,000.
Later, informed sources reported
| that the spending budget tentatively
shaped up early this month at about
j $63,000,000,000.
All sources agreed that, while ]
progress was being made toward j
equalizing spending and income, a j
balanced budget for fiscal 1956 was i
out of the question.
If advance indications are borne
out., spending nort year will be
about a billion dollars less than the
$64,000,000,000 outlay for the current
fiscal period. Revenue would be
about the same as the $59,300,000,000
anticipated this year.
Besides ruling out, any new tax
reductions, the President will ask
that corporation tax rates scheduled
to drop from 52 to 47 per cent on
April I be continued at present
rates.
