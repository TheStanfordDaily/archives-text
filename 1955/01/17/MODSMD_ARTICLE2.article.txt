## 
### 
Beniamino Benvcnuto B u 112 a no ,
San Francisco's most famous and
controversial sculptor, has offered
more than'loo examples of his work
to Stanford.
Bufano's offer of statues and mo
saics has been accepted by the Uni
versity's committee on art acquisi
tion, headed by Frank James.
Bufano is giving away every fin
ished piece he owns, his entire out
put for the last 25 years with the
exception of those already owned
by the city of San Francisco or in
museums. The gift is valued at a
million and a half dollars.
The University is not sure it will
accept everything, but it is virtu
ally certain that some of Bufano's
collection of art will be accepted
and displayed on the campus.
Among the works of art is a 14-
foot stainless steel and stone figure
of Johann Sebastian Bach, which
will probably be placed in the Uni
versity's new music building, funds
for which were given to Stanford
by Lloyd Dinkelspiel, president of
the University's Board of Trustees.
Also included in the gift are a
great beaten copper head of St.
Francis and an incompleted Cruci
fixion group, made up of tree trunks,
conglomerate stone, copper, and
stainless steel.
The mosaics are made up of col
ored and fired quartz, cut with a
hammer and chisel into thousands of
tiny pieces. They are mounted on
j Philippine mahogany, framed with
I stainless steel, and backed with lay
! ers of felt to protect the stone im
ages.
