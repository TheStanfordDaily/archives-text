# Stanford Sweeps California Series
## Tomsic Sparks 59-57 Win Over Bears Friday 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
A long - shot gamble by Couch
Howie Dallmar, a wonderfully cool
stall by the poised Card quintet, and
a storybook shot by Stanford's
storybook basketball hero Ron Tom
sic. This was the combination that
gave Stanford a dramatic 59-57 vic
tory over Cal in the Bears' own lair
Friday night.
The game opened looking as if it
would be a Cakewalk for the In
dians. But an unobtrusive Jittle
sophomore guard, Mike Diaz, got hot
suddenly and put on an amazing
.-hooting exhibition. Diaz literally
kept Cal in the game, matching the
Stanford team basket for basket.
When he walked ofT the floor at
half-time, he had seven field goals
and one free throw for 15 points.
He never got another one.
McKEEN OVERRATED
Outside of Diaz in the first period,
Cal didn't show much in the way of
a threat. The Cal Athletic Publicity
Bureaus' candidate for All-America
honors, Bob McKeen, showed him
self an adequate center but nothing
more.
Neither team was hot in the first
half, as Cal hit for 41 per cent and
Stanford 39 per cent. Stanford, for
a while, almost looked as if they
were trying to throw the game away
at the free throw line. Their misses
totaled up to a possible 18 points
lost at the free throw line during
the first half.
Tomsic, the little guard with the
mechanical knee and the unerring
aim, was his usual self—which is,
of course, little less than tremen
dous. He connected on 10 out of 14
shots and three charity tosses for 23
points, better than 70 per cent from
the floor.
IRON MEN
Only 12 players—six for each side
—participated in the contest. The
victory for the Cards was the first in
five years at the Berkeley court. It
was also the first time in three sea
sons Stanford has been able to take
a pair of games in PCC play. Three
years ago the Bruins were defeated
twice in the Pavilion, and the year
before Cal was downed in a pair
played at the Cow Palace.
Many of the shots Diaz made were
by driving in past the man who was
guarding him, George Seileck. The
Boars said after the game this was
partly to try to make Seileck foul
him, and force the little play-maker
out of the game on personals.
