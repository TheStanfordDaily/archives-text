"Ihe Indians started slowly, as
both they and the Bears seemed to
carry over their cautious attitude
from the previous evening's game.
Alter four minutes of play the count
was knotted at 4-4.
California's Bob Blake then sank
a free throw to put the Bears ahead
for the last time, for just a moment,
later Indian Barry Brown tallied on
a 20-foot jump shot and the Cards
were in front for good.

ford had shot to a 17-12 lead with

less from the field for the remain
der of the half and sank 13 straight

32-18. The Bears' Bob McKeen
broke this run â€¢ with a free throw,
but the Indians kept firing away

gest margin of the game, 38-20.
Center Puss Lawler was the In
