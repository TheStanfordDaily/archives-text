# Stanford Quintet Thumps Bears Twice To Tie UCLA for Southern Division Lead
## Cellar-Dwelling Cal Falls To Indians, 59-57, 75-67 
### DON WEBSTER Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford's basketball team didn't play their best brand of ball
over the weekend, but they did play well enough to take a twin
bill from the cellar-dwelling California cage team.
The Cards won Friday night at Berkeley in a 59-57 thriller, and
triumphed easily Saturday at the Pavilion, 75-67. The wins put

Stanford in a tic with UCLA for first
place in the PCC Southern Division
with a 3-1 mark. USC has a 2-2
record, and the Bears arc far behind
with 0-4.
One Indian eager summarized the
first game by saying "We stunk out
the gym, but they were even worse."
The Indians couldn't seem to hit
their hats, particularly from the
free throw line. They garnered only
seven points in 20 tosses from the
charity lino. Of the 13 shots missed,
9 were on the first shot, of a one
and-onc situation, which meants the
loss of a possible 18 shots. With
any normal percentage of these shots
made, the game would have been a
walkaway.
BETTER CLUB APPARENT
It was apparent from the begin
ning of the series which was the
better club. The Bears seemed to
have potential, but weren't working
together as a team. One Cal player
would shoot, and there would be
three Stanford men under the bas
ket. The Cards constantly out-re
bounded, out-jumped, and out
hustled the Bears despite the height
advantage enjoyed by losers.
The Indian's lack of shooting skill
in Ihe first half Friday, both on
charity tosses and on seemingly
easy lay-ins from the floor, left them
a 25-32 deficit at halftimo. Stanford
hit only 11 for 28 from the floor and
three for 11 from the free throw
line during the first 20 minutes.
Good shooting after the intermis
sion made up the difference, and
going into the last, four minutes of
play the score was tied at 57 all,
Cards in possession. They stalled,
waiting for the three-minute rule to
go into cfTcct, and then with 2 min
utes and 58 seconds remaining, called
for a time out.
STALL TACTICS
Coach Dallmar gave them orders:
stall, and when there arc just 20
seconds or so remaining, Dallmar
would stand up. That would be the
signal to drive for the winning
basket.
The clock at Berkeley is a four
sided, over-hanging affair, easily
read by the fans but hard to see
from the floor itself. Stanford start
ed stalling; the team, unable to
easily figure out how much time was
left, waiting for Dallmar to stand.
"I got so excited about the stall
I forgot all about standing up," the
coach said afterwards.
With 16 seconds to play, the Cards
called a time out. This time in the
huddle the play was to "throw it,
into Lawler, who will do what he can
with it—hook shot, drive in, or hand
it off. The ball went in to Lawler,
and Bear players, eager to gain pos
session, swarmed toward him.
TOMSIC lIERO
That left Tomsic all alone, about
25 feet out. Lawler tossed back to
Tomsic, who bucketed a two-pointer
for the deciding tally with only a
scant second left, to play. Thus a
game went to the Cards that should
not have been that close.
Saturday night, the shooting was
more accurate, and the Indians
raced lo a large half lime lead, then
coasted the its), of Ihe way in. The
Bears never drew eloper in the sec
ond stanza than they did with the
final score.
Things aren't bright for the Bears.
After the two-week league break for
finals, they travel to play a pair of
tilts at Westwood. That means they
could well have an 0-6 record before
they pet on Ihe winning trail.
SCORING RECORD BROKEN
Bear center Bob McKecn broke
Hank LuLsctti's all time PCC scor
ing mark of 612, but that's all he
has to boast about this weekend.
Friday night he scored 17 points,
while opposing center Russ Lawler


THE END IS NEAR—Three seconds remain Friday night at Berkeley as Stanford's deadly-she
ing Ron Tomsic prepares to fire the sudden-death field goal which ruined California, 59-57. T
sic's shot from 25 feet out ends a three-and-a-half-minute stall. The Cal players who have 1
Tomsic in the clear are Larry Friend (24) and A 1 Winetrub. The Cards won Saturday night als
75-67. —Daily photo by Frank Huntre
tallied only eight. But the figures
are deceiving. Both had about the
isame shooting percentage, and Law
ler seemed to do a better job than
McKeen, on defense, rebounding,
jumping, and overall hustle.
Saturday night it was the same
story. McKeen tallied nine field
goals, but many of them were in the
second half when Lawler had left
the game. And he took 21 shots,
while Kuss made 6 for 16—about
the same percentage. Lawler simply
didn't have to shoot as much, be
cause, unlike the Bear center, he had
some teammates who could also
score. And McKeen was called on
four occasions for walking, and again
seemed to be out-hustled.
Dallmar wasn't too pessimistic
about the Cal situation. "They'll win
some games this season," he said.
"They have the potential to beat
UCLA in one game, though probably
not at West wood.
PLAYING SPOTTY
"I thought we played a spotty
game—good in some places and bad
in others. 1 thought we did well in

the second half Friday—coming up
from seven poinLs behind—and in
the first half Saturday—leading by
18. We lost our aggressiveness in

the second half, but we didn't need
to work too hard, what with the big
lead."
Dallmar said his only disappoint

mcnt of the weekend was that the
Bruins and Trojaas didn't split their
contests, "That would have helped
us," he said.
"All of Stanford's players looked
good in spots," Dallmar commented.
"Mike Diaz looked good Friday in
the first half. He's very deceptive
and kept Cal in the gall game."
While the rest of the schools arc
taking final semester exams, Stan
ford's team travels to Hawaii, where
they will alternate between playing
in the Hawaii Invitational Tourna
ment and lying on the beach at
Waikiki, studying.

going into the last, four minutes of
play the score was tied at 57 all,
Cards in possession. They stalled,
waiting for the three-minute rule to
go into cfTcct, and then with 2 min
utes and 58 seconds remaining, called
for a time out.
STALL TACTICS
Coach Dallmar gave them orders:
stall, and when there arc just 20
seconds or so remaining, Dallmar
would stand up. That would be the
signal to drive for the winning
basket.
The clock at Berkeley is a four
sided, over-hanging affair, easily
read by the fans but hard to see
from the floor itself. Stanford start
ed stalling; the team, unable to
easily figure out how much time was
left, waiting for Dallmar to stand.
"I got so excited about the stall
I forgot all about standing up," the
coach said afterwards.
With 16 seconds to play, the Cards
called a time out. This time in the
huddle the play was to "throw it,
into Lawler, who will do what he can
with it—hook shot, drive in, or hand
it off. The ball went in to Lawler,
and Bear players, eager to gain pos
session, swarmed toward him.
TOMSIC lIERO
That left Tomsic all alone, about
25 feet out. Lawler tossed back to
Tomsic, who bucketed a two-pointer
for the deciding tally with only a
scant second left, to play. Thus a
game went to the Cards that should
not have been that close.
Saturday night, the shooting was
more accurate, and the Indians
raced lo a large half lime lead, then
coasted the its), of Ihe way in. The
Bears never drew eloper in the sec
ond stanza than they did with the
final score.
Things aren't bright for the Bears.
After the two-week league break for
finals, they travel to play a pair of
tilts at Westwood. That means they
could well have an 0-6 record before
they pet on Ihe winning trail.
SCORING RECORD BROKEN
Bear center Bob McKecn broke
Hank LuLsctti's all time PCC scor
ing mark of 612, but that's all he
has to boast about this weekend.
Friday night he scored 17 points,
while opposing center Russ Lawler


THE END IS NEAR—Three seconds remain Friday night at Berkeley as Stanford's deadly-she
ing Ron Tomsic prepares to fire the sudden-death field goal which ruined California, 59-57. T
sic's shot from 25 feet out ends a three-and-a-half-minute stall. The Cal players who have 1
Tomsic in the clear are Larry Friend (24) and A 1 Winetrub. The Cards won Saturday night als
75-67. —Daily photo by Frank Huntre
tallied only eight. But the figures
are deceiving. Both had about the
isame shooting percentage, and Law
ler seemed to do a better job than
McKeen, on defense, rebounding,
jumping, and overall hustle.
Saturday night it was the same
story. McKeen tallied nine field
goals, but many of them were in the
second half when Lawler had left
the game. And he took 21 shots,
while Kuss made 6 for 16—about
the same percentage. Lawler simply
didn't have to shoot as much, be
cause, unlike the Bear center, he had
some teammates who could also
score. And McKeen was called on
four occasions for walking, and again
seemed to be out-hustled.
Dallmar wasn't too pessimistic
about the Cal situation. "They'll win
some games this season," he said.
"They have the potential to beat
UCLA in one game, though probably
not at West wood.
PLAYING SPOTTY
"I thought we played a spotty
game—good in some places and bad
in others. 1 thought we did well in

the second half Friday—coming up
from seven poinLs behind—and in
the first half Saturday—leading by
18. We lost our aggressiveness in

the second half, but we didn't need
to work too hard, what with the big
lead."
Dallmar said his only disappoint

mcnt of the weekend was that the
Bruins and Trojaas didn't split their
contests, "That would have helped
us," he said.
"All of Stanford's players looked
good in spots," Dallmar commented.
"Mike Diaz looked good Friday in
the first half. He's very deceptive
and kept Cal in the gall game."
While the rest of the schools arc
taking final semester exams, Stan
ford's team travels to Hawaii, where
they will alternate between playing
in the Hawaii Invitational Tourna
ment and lying on the beach at
Waikiki, studying.

Stanford's basketball team didn't play their best brand of ball
over the weekend, but they did play well enough to take a twin
bill from the cellar-dwelling California cage team.
The Cards won Friday night at Berkeley in a 59-57 thriller, and
triumphed easily Saturday at the Pavilion, 75-67. The wins put

Stanford in a tic with UCLA for first
place in the PCC Southern Division
with a 3-1 mark. USC has a 2-2
record, and the Bears arc far behind
with 0-4.
One Indian eager summarized the
first game by saying "We stunk out
the gym, but they were even worse."
The Indians couldn't seem to hit
their hats, particularly from the
free throw line. They garnered only
seven points in 20 tosses from the
charity lino. Of the 13 shots missed,
9 were on the first shot, of a one
and-onc situation, which meants the
loss of a possible 18 shots. With
any normal percentage of these shots
made, the game would have been a
walkaway.
BETTER CLUB APPARENT
It was apparent from the begin
ning of the series which was the
better club. The Bears seemed to
have potential, but weren't working
together as a team. One Cal player
would shoot, and there would be
three Stanford men under the bas
ket. The Cards constantly out-re
bounded, out-jumped, and out
hustled the Bears despite the height
advantage enjoyed by losers.
The Indian's lack of shooting skill
in Ihe first half Friday, both on
charity tosses and on seemingly
easy lay-ins from the floor, left them
a 25-32 deficit at halftimo. Stanford
hit only 11 for 28 from the floor and
three for 11 from the free throw
line during the first 20 minutes.

Bear center Bob McKecn broke
Hank LuLsctti's all time PCC scor
ing mark of 612, but that's all he
has to boast about this weekend.
Friday night he scored 17 points,
while opposing center Russ Lawler


THE END IS NEAR—Three seconds remain Friday night at Berkeley as Stanford's deadly-she
ing Ron Tomsic prepares to fire the sudden-death field goal which ruined California, 59-57. T
sic's shot from 25 feet out ends a three-and-a-half-minute stall. The Cal players who have 1
Tomsic in the clear are Larry Friend (24) and A 1 Winetrub. The Cards won Saturday night als
75-67. —Daily photo by Frank Huntre
tallied only eight. But the figures
are deceiving. Both had about the
isame shooting percentage, and Law
ler seemed to do a better job than
McKeen, on defense, rebounding,
jumping, and overall hustle.
Saturday night it was the same
story. McKeen tallied nine field
goals, but many of them were in the
second half when Lawler had left
the game. And he took 21 shots,
while Kuss made 6 for 16—about
the same percentage. Lawler simply
didn't have to shoot as much, be
cause, unlike the Bear center, he had
some teammates who could also
score. And McKeen was called on
four occasions for walking, and again
seemed to be out-hustled.
Dallmar wasn't too pessimistic
about the Cal situation. "They'll win
some games this season," he said.
"They have the potential to beat
UCLA in one game, though probably
not at West wood.
PLAYING SPOTTY
"I thought we played a spotty
game—good in some places and bad
in others. 1 thought we did well in

the second half Friday—coming up
from seven poinLs behind—and in
the first half Saturday—leading by
18. We lost our aggressiveness in

the second half, but we didn't need
to work too hard, what with the big
lead."
Dallmar said his only disappoint

mcnt of the weekend was that the
Bruins and Trojaas didn't split their
contests, "That would have helped
us," he said.
"All of Stanford's players looked
good in spots," Dallmar commented.
"Mike Diaz looked good Friday in
the first half. He's very deceptive
and kept Cal in the gall game."
While the rest of the schools arc
taking final semester exams, Stan
ford's team travels to Hawaii, where
they will alternate between playing
in the Hawaii Invitational Tourna
ment and lying on the beach at
Waikiki, studying.

Stanford's basketball team didn't play their best brand of ball
over the weekend, but they did play well enough to take a twin
bill from the cellar-dwelling California cage team.
The Cards won Friday night at Berkeley in a 59-57 thriller, and
triumphed easily Saturday at the Pavilion, 75-67. The wins put

Stanford in a tic with UCLA for first
place in the PCC Southern Division
with a 3-1 mark. USC has a 2-2
record, and the Bears arc far behind
with 0-4.
One Indian eager summarized the
first game by saying "We stunk out
the gym, but they were even worse."
The Indians couldn't seem to hit
their hats, particularly from the
free throw line. They garnered only
seven points in 20 tosses from the
charity lino. Of the 13 shots missed,
9 were on the first shot, of a one
and-onc situation, which meants the
loss of a possible 18 shots. With
any normal percentage of these shots
made, the game would have been a
walkaway.
BETTER CLUB APPARENT
It was apparent from the begin
ning of the series which was the
better club. The Bears seemed to
have potential, but weren't working
together as a team. One Cal player
would shoot, and there would be
three Stanford men under the bas
ket. The Cards constantly out-re
bounded, out-jumped, and out
hustled the Bears despite the height
advantage enjoyed by losers.
The Indian's lack of shooting skill
in Ihe first half Friday, both on
charity tosses and on seemingly
easy lay-ins from the floor, left them
a 25-32 deficit at halftimo. Stanford
hit only 11 for 28 from the floor and
three for 11 from the free throw
line during the first 20 minutes.
Good shooting after the intermis
sion made up the difference, and
going into the last, four minutes of
play the score was tied at 57 all,
Cards in possession. They stalled,
waiting for the three-minute rule to
go into cfTcct, and then with 2 min
utes and 58 seconds remaining, called
for a time out.
STALL TACTICS
Coach Dallmar gave them orders:
stall, and when there arc just 20
seconds or so remaining, Dallmar
would stand up. That would be the
signal to drive for the winning
basket.
The clock at Berkeley is a four
sided, over-hanging affair, easily
read by the fans but hard to see
from the floor itself. Stanford start
ed stalling; the team, unable to
easily figure out how much time was
left, waiting for Dallmar to stand.
"I got so excited about the stall
I forgot all about standing up," the
coach said afterwards.
With 16 seconds to play, the Cards
called a time out. This time in the
huddle the play was to "throw it,
into Lawler, who will do what he can
with it—hook shot, drive in, or hand
it off. The ball went in to Lawler,
and Bear players, eager to gain pos
session, swarmed toward him.
TOMSIC lIERO
That left Tomsic all alone, about
25 feet out. Lawler tossed back to
Tomsic, who bucketed a two-pointer
for the deciding tally with only a
scant second left, to play. Thus a
game went to the Cards that should
not have been that close.
Saturday night, the shooting was
more accurate, and the Indians
raced lo a large half lime lead, then
coasted the its), of Ihe way in. The
Bears never drew eloper in the sec
ond stanza than they did with the
final score.
Things aren't bright for the Bears.
After the two-week league break for
finals, they travel to play a pair of
tilts at Westwood. That means they
could well have an 0-6 record before
they pet on Ihe winning trail.

Stanford's basketball team didn't play their best brand of ball
over the weekend, but they did play well enough to take a twin
bill from the cellar-dwelling California cage team.
The Cards won Friday night at Berkeley in a 59-57 thriller, and
triumphed easily Saturday at the Pavilion, 75-67. The wins put

Stanford in a tic with UCLA for first
place in the PCC Southern Division
with a 3-1 mark. USC has a 2-2
record, and the Bears arc far behind
with 0-4.
One Indian eager summarized the
first game by saying "We stunk out
the gym, but they were even worse."
The Indians couldn't seem to hit
their hats, particularly from the
free throw line. They garnered only
seven points in 20 tosses from the
charity lino. Of the 13 shots missed,
9 were on the first shot, of a one
and-onc situation, which meants the
loss of a possible 18 shots. With
any normal percentage of these shots
made, the game would have been a
walkaway.
BETTER CLUB APPARENT
It was apparent from the begin
ning of the series which was the
better club. The Bears seemed to
have potential, but weren't working
together as a team. One Cal player
would shoot, and there would be
three Stanford men under the bas
ket. The Cards constantly out-re
bounded, out-jumped, and out
hustled the Bears despite the height
advantage enjoyed by losers.
The Indian's lack of shooting skill
in Ihe first half Friday, both on
charity tosses and on seemingly
easy lay-ins from the floor, left them
a 25-32 deficit at halftimo. Stanford
hit only 11 for 28 from the floor and
three for 11 from the free throw
line during the first 20 minutes.
Good shooting after the intermis
sion made up the difference, and
going into the last, four minutes of
play the score was tied at 57 all,
Cards in possession. They stalled,
waiting for the three-minute rule to
go into cfTcct, and then with 2 min
utes and 58 seconds remaining, called
for a time out.
STALL TACTICS
Coach Dallmar gave them orders:
stall, and when there arc just 20
seconds or so remaining, Dallmar
would stand up. That would be the
signal to drive for the winning
basket.
The clock at Berkeley is a four
sided, over-hanging affair, easily
read by the fans but hard to see
from the floor itself. Stanford start
ed stalling; the team, unable to
easily figure out how much time was
left, waiting for Dallmar to stand.
"I got so excited about the stall
I forgot all about standing up," the
coach said afterwards.
With 16 seconds to play, the Cards
called a time out. This time in the
huddle the play was to "throw it,
into Lawler, who will do what he can
with it—hook shot, drive in, or hand
it off. The ball went in to Lawler,
and Bear players, eager to gain pos
session, swarmed toward him.
TOMSIC lIERO
That left Tomsic all alone, about
25 feet out. Lawler tossed back to
Tomsic, who bucketed a two-pointer
for the deciding tally with only a
scant second left, to play. Thus a
game went to the Cards that should
not have been that close.
Saturday night, the shooting was
more accurate, and the Indians
raced lo a large half lime lead, then
coasted the its), of Ihe way in. The
Bears never drew eloper in the sec
ond stanza than they did with the
final score.
Things aren't bright for the Bears.
After the two-week league break for
finals, they travel to play a pair of
tilts at Westwood. That means they
could well have an 0-6 record before
they pet on Ihe winning trail.
SCORING RECORD BROKEN
Bear center Bob McKecn broke
Hank LuLsctti's all time PCC scor
ing mark of 612, but that's all he
has to boast about this weekend.
Friday night he scored 17 points,
while opposing center Russ Lawler


THE END IS NEAR—Three seconds remain Friday night at Berkeley as Stanford's deadly-she
ing Ron Tomsic prepares to fire the sudden-death field goal which ruined California, 59-57. T
sic's shot from 25 feet out ends a three-and-a-half-minute stall. The Cal players who have 1
Tomsic in the clear are Larry Friend (24) and A 1 Winetrub. The Cards won Saturday night als
75-67. —Daily photo by Frank Huntre
tallied only eight. But the figures
are deceiving. Both had about the
isame shooting percentage, and Law
ler seemed to do a better job than
McKeen, on defense, rebounding,
jumping, and overall hustle.
Saturday night it was the same
story. McKeen tallied nine field
goals, but many of them were in the
second half when Lawler had left
the game. And he took 21 shots,
while Kuss made 6 for 16—about
the same percentage. Lawler simply
didn't have to shoot as much, be
cause, unlike the Bear center, he had
some teammates who could also
score. And McKeen was called on
four occasions for walking, and again
seemed to be out-hustled.
Dallmar wasn't too pessimistic
about the Cal situation. "They'll win
some games this season," he said.
"They have the potential to beat
UCLA in one game, though probably
not at West wood.
PLAYING SPOTTY
"I thought we played a spotty
game—good in some places and bad
in others. 1 thought we did well in

the second half Friday—coming up
from seven poinLs behind—and in
the first half Saturday—leading by
18. We lost our aggressiveness in

the second half, but we didn't need
to work too hard, what with the big
lead."
