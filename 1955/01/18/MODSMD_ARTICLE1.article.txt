# Undergrad Study Discussed In ST&T Talk at Branner
## Speaker Asks Student Ideas 
### DICK MEISTER Student ideas on Stanford's 
current "Study of Undergradu- j
ate Education" were discussed
last night at Branner Hall by Pro
fessor Donald W. Taylor in the
second talk in this year's "Stan
ford— Today and Tomorrow"
series.
Speaking to the freshmen women's
living group Taylor said, "In con- \
ducting this study the members of j
the study group, including admin- j
istrators, faculty, and students, need i
information from you, the student, j
in order to assure its success."
Last night's meeting gave stu- !
dents an opportunity *o discuss with
Taylor, who is director of the under
graduate study, some of the things
which they believe should be in
cluded in the study. More specifical
ly, direct queries that might be put [
on a questionnaire which the study I
group intends to circulate 1o alumni,
as well as to those at the University
now.
OUTLINE PREPARED
Taylor said that heady a five
page outline of que lions on every
phase of undergraduate education
has been prepared by his study
group, but that more questions will
be added.
''What questions do you want
raised?" (on the questionnaire) is
the way Taylor phrased it to last
night's audience.
Responses to Taylor's question
were mainly concerned with the Uni
versity's lower division program. A
great deal of interest was shown in
the division's requirement (which
Taylor said were receiving pro
longed attention by the undergrad
uate study now). Students in the
audience asked such questions as,
"Why shouldn't there be a required
course concerning student adjust
ment, study habits and the like?"
REQUIRED COURSES
Taylor pointed out. that some col
leges do have such a required course
and said that the study wants to find
out if such a course is desired and
if it is instituted, should it be vol
untary or part of the general lower
division requirements.
Many in the group also expressed
an interest in vocational choice and
Taylor noted that the Student Coun
seling Center on Quad offers such
aid with its extensive library in that
field.
Speaking of this general field of
the University's role outside the
purely academic field Taylor com
mented on the many different views
of educators on the question, "Is one
of the purposes of a college or uni
versity to teach students to adjust."
Obviously, the reaction to such a
query at Branner seemed to be a
definite "yes."

of the purposes of a college or uni
versity to teach students to adjust."
Obviously, the reaction to such a
query at Branner seemed to be a
definite "yes."
current "Study of Undergradu- j
ate Education" were discussed
last night at Branner Hall by Pro
fessor Donald W. Taylor in the
second talk in this year's "Stan
ford— Today and Tomorrow"
series.
Speaking to the freshmen women's
living group Taylor said, "In con- \
ducting this study the members of j
the study group, including admin- j
istrators, faculty, and students, need i
information from you, the student, j
in order to assure its success."
Last night's meeting gave stu- !
dents an opportunity *o discuss with
Taylor, who is director of the under
graduate study, some of the things
which they believe should be in
cluded in the study. More specifical
ly, direct queries that might be put [
on a questionnaire which the study I
group intends to circulate 1o alumni,
as well as to those at the University
now.
OUTLINE PREPARED
Taylor said that heady a five
page outline of que lions on every
phase of undergraduate education
has been prepared by his study
group, but that more questions will
be added.
''What questions do you want
raised?" (on the questionnaire) is
the way Taylor phrased it to last
night's audience.
Responses to Taylor's question
were mainly concerned with the Uni
versity's lower division program. A
great deal of interest was shown in
the division's requirement (which
Taylor said were receiving pro
longed attention by the undergrad
uate study now). Students in the
audience asked such questions as,
"Why shouldn't there be a required
course concerning student adjust
ment, study habits and the like?"
REQUIRED COURSES
Taylor pointed out. that some col
leges do have such a required course
and said that the study wants to find
out if such a course is desired and
if it is instituted, should it be vol
untary or part of the general lower
division requirements.
Many in the group also expressed
an interest in vocational choice and
Taylor noted that the Student Coun
seling Center on Quad offers such
aid with its extensive library in that
field.
Speaking of this general field of
the University's role outside the
purely academic field Taylor com
mented on the many different views
of educators on the question, "Is one
of the purposes of a college or uni
versity to teach students to adjust."
