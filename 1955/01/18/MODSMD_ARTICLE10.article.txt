### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (UP)
— President Eisenhower today
sent Congress a $2,000,000,000
atomic budget providing for a
record output of nuclear weap
ons designed to "multiply many
fold" the striking power of the
armed forces.
While pledging to spend more
than ever before on peaceful use of
the atom, the President told Con
gress that "we have no alternative
but to strengthen further our most
effective deterrent to armed aggres
sion — the power of our nuclear
weapons stockpile."
He also told the lawmakers in his
budget message that the Dtfense
Department will speed research on
an atomic-powered airplane and an
atomic engine for major surface
warships. He said the Navy plans
three more atomic submarines,
bringing the total to seven.
The President also disclosed that
he will'ask Congress again to permit ;
residents of the atomic towns of j
Richland, Wash., and Oak Ridge.
Tenn., to buy their homes and es
tablish self-government, "thus tak
ing the federal government out of j
the business of owning and govern- J
ing these communities."
Mr. Eisenhower repeatedly restat- j
ed his goal of harnessing the atom
for "the well-being of all mankind."
But he said nuclear weapons have
created a "revolution in military
concepts" and must continue to have
first priority in this country's atomic j
planning.
