# Unbalanced Budget Stirs Congressional Criticism
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, lan. 17 (UP)—Congressional Democrats—and
some Republicans—expressed "disappointment" over President
Eisenhower's new budget today.
Democrats, who now have control of the Appropriations Com
mittees, generally took the line that Mr. Eisenhower had failed to

live up to GOP campaign promisesH
in sending up another unbalanced
budget.
Some Republicans also voiced
"regret" that another year of deficit
spending was forecast and they
promised to try to trim enough
funds to bring the budget into bal
ance.
They made clear their chief econ
omy efforts will be aimed at the
mutual defense program and other
types of foreign spending. Senator
Henry C. Dworshak (R., Ida.) said
"foreign spending can be materially
reduced."
INCREASE IX MILITARY
On the other hand there was some
sentiment for increasing the Presi
dent's military spending proposals.
Senate Democratic Leader Lyndon
B. Johnson (D., Tex.) said Congress
will have to study the budget care
fully to determine whether it pro
vides "adequate" defense money.
Comment on the budget ranged
from the sharply critical to claims
by GOP leaders that the $2,408,000.-
000 deficit, forecast for fiscal 1956
was a small one which reflected big
economies in non-military branches
of the government.
BUDGET "DECEPTION"
Chairmrn Clarence Cannon (D.,
Mo.) of the House Appropriations
Committee called the budget "de
ceptive and a great disappoint
ment." He said the President made
no reference to cutting the national
debt and "projects a continued un
baalnced budget indefinitely."
But rlou.sc GOP Leader Joseph W.
Mart'.n, Jr., said the budget was a
"realistic approach" even though it
"docs not cp 11 for the balance we
had hoped for." He said the deficit
"certainly is not inflationary," which
shows the administration has gotten
"our finances under control."
