# Ike Charts Tax Cut in 1956; Asks Crackdown on Evaders
## No Reduction Justified Now 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (UP)
— President Eisenhower today
charted a course toward a new
federal tax cut in the 1956 presi
dential election year that would
be "spread fairly among all tax
payers."
The Chief Executive also asked
Congress to pave the way toward
relieving some 35,000,000 low-brack
et wage earners of the annual chore
of figuring out their federal income
tax.
He likewise requested an addi
tional $12,000,000 to help crack down
on tax evaders and proposed that
employers be relieved of some of
the burden of making tax reports to
the government.
Mr. Eisenhower, whose budget
message noted that federal taxis
were slashed a whopping $7,000,000,-
000 last year, said the prospect of
another deficit in the new fiscal
year rules out further reductions
now.
He asked the lawmakers to pro
vent scheduled cuts April 1 under
which corporation levies would drop
from 52 to 47 per cent and excise
would be trimmed on automobiles,
liquor, tobacco, and gasoline.
REDUCE TAX SOON
The President quickly added,
however, that "the present tax take
of nearly one-fourth is a serious
obstacle" to the necessary "long
range dynamic growth" of the coun
try and must be reduced as soon as
possible.
"'Further tax reduction remains
a firm goal of this administration,
and our policy is directed to achiev
ing both the savings in expenditures
and the economic growth that will
make such reductions possible," he
said.
CUTS NEXT YEAR?
"I hope that tax reductions will be
so justified next year. If so, I shall
recommend a reduction in taxes to
spread relief fairly among all tax
payers in a way which will be the
most effective to relieve individual
tax burdens and to increase incen
tive for effort and inevstment."
While Mr. Eisenhower did not say
so, some observers took his state
ment to mean he might press for a
slash in personal income taxes next
year if the revenue picture permits.
Congressional Democrats were de
feated last year in an effort to sub
stitute a personal tax cut for the
President's dividend relief plan.
They are expected to hold compre
hensive hearings this session with
an eye toward a renewed effort to
trim personal levies in 1956.


DEFICIT AGAIN, 1956 —According to the prospective presi
dential budget, spending will exceed revenues by $2.4 billion
for fiscal 1956. This chart shows a breakdown of the expendi
tures, totaling $62.4 million, and the receipts, totaling $60 mil
lion. In his budget message, President Eisenhower said that
there was no alternative but to raise the permanent legal ceiling
on the public debt. —NEA Telephoto
