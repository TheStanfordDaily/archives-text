# TV Boosts Stanford Fame
## 
### 
Just as Stanford athletic teams have made the
University famous in an athletic light, there is
another team which is making Stanford famous
in an academic sense.
Quarterbacked by Professor Stanley Donner,
of the Speech and Drama Department and using
a strong line of faculty and students, Stanford
has produced and presented several series of
educational television programs over local sta
tions in recent years.
The latest effort will be a TV series over
KQED entitled "Our Rugged Constitution,"
which will kick toff a 13-week series beginning
Friday. The program will view today's head
lines in the light of basic American principles
as outlined in the Federal Constitution
For Stanford it will probably be another suc
cessful endeavor to add to the mounting score
of victories. Last year the University received
the Northern California Academy of Television
award for an outstanding program, "People,
Places, and Politics." This takes on an even
greater significance when one considers that
only two program awards were made.
The versatile Donner, who produced the
show and will moderate the new one, received
a special citation for his work.
The programs are strictly a community
project, however. The University looks upon
itself as a vast storehouse of all kinds of

knowledge and is eager to engage in the preser
vation, the development and the dissemination
of knowledge.
As in last year's show, members of the fac
ulty will play a major role. In "People, Places,
and Politics," many departments such as
geography, history, political science, Germanic
and Romanic languages, sociology and anthro
pology, Asiatic and Slavic Studies, and the
Hoover Institute and Library all made signifi
cant contributions.
Using last year as a criterion, "Our Rugged
Constitution" will probably reach 100,000
viewers. To accommodate this size audience
on the Stanford campus would mean that Me
morial Hall would be filled to capacity fifty
eight nights. To house the total audience for
the 13-week series, Memorial Hall would be
filled every night—Saturdays, Sundays, and
holidays, for more than two years.
Kinescopes will be made for the programs
for future use which means that an even greater
audience will be able to enjoy the benefits of
a serious educational discussion of basic Amer
ican principles.
We commend the Speech and Drama Depart
men and all those concerned in the pursuit
of and dissemination of educational informa
tion and wish them smooth sailing on the tele
vision channel.

vation, the development and the dissemination
of knowledge.
As in last year's show, members of the fac
ulty will play a major role. In "People, Places,
and Politics," many departments such as
geography, history, political science, Germanic
and Romanic languages, sociology and anthro
pology, Asiatic and Slavic Studies, and the
Hoover Institute and Library all made signifi
cant contributions.
Using last year as a criterion, "Our Rugged
Constitution" will probably reach 100,000
viewers. To accommodate this size audience
on the Stanford campus would mean that Me
morial Hall would be filled to capacity fifty
eight nights. To house the total audience for
the 13-week series, Memorial Hall would be
filled every night—Saturdays, Sundays, and
holidays, for more than two years.
Kinescopes will be made for the programs
for future use which means that an even greater
audience will be able to enjoy the benefits of
a serious educational discussion of basic Amer
ican principles.
We commend the Speech and Drama Depart
men and all those concerned in the pursuit
of and dissemination of educational informa
tion and wish them smooth sailing on the tele
vision channel.
Just as Stanford athletic teams have made the
University famous in an athletic light, there is
another team which is making Stanford famous
in an academic sense.
Quarterbacked by Professor Stanley Donner,
of the Speech and Drama Department and using
a strong line of faculty and students, Stanford
has produced and presented several series of
educational television programs over local sta
tions in recent years.
The latest effort will be a TV series over
KQED entitled "Our Rugged Constitution,"
which will kick toff a 13-week series beginning
Friday. The program will view today's head
lines in the light of basic American principles
as outlined in the Federal Constitution
For Stanford it will probably be another suc
cessful endeavor to add to the mounting score
of victories. Last year the University received
the Northern California Academy of Television
award for an outstanding program, "People,
Places, and Politics." This takes on an even
greater significance when one considers that
only two program awards were made.
The versatile Donner, who produced the
show and will moderate the new one, received
a special citation for his work.
The programs are strictly a community
project, however. The University looks upon
itself as a vast storehouse of all kinds of

knowledge and is eager to engage in the preser
vation, the development and the dissemination
of knowledge.
