## Minority Stand on Soviet Editors Clarified 
### 
To the Editor:
We refer to the Daily article of Thursday 13 Jan
uary on Excom's vote to endorse a movement to
petition the gtate Department to allow a group of
middle-aged Soviet student newspaper editors to
tour the United States. It may be inferred from read
ing this article that those who voted for rescinding
the previous week's motion of endorsement were
necessarily opposed to the endorsement.
This is not true. We were sympathetic toward
endorsefflfent, but we were opposed to immediate
endorsement, because we wanted to consider fur
ther possible facts from the Justice Department and
NSA as concerning their disposal of the case before
making our final decision. We felt that the matter
was such that it could wait for at least a couple of
weeks until an attempt was made to obtain this
evidence.

To make our position even clearer by using an
extreme example: even if we thought that an oppo
nent in a dispute could not raise a valid counter
argument to our reasoning, we would still listen to
his arguments before finally deciding in order to
fulfill the moral obligation to try to make a just
decision.
