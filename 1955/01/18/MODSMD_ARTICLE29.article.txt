"My hope is that American
students will participate more
actively in world student af
fairs."
These are the words of 22-year
old Abdul Mohammed Badjab, vice
president of the Indonesian National
Union of Students, and a member of
tiie International Student Confer
ences Co-ordination Secretariat.
Radjab has been visiting, student
! organisations in U.S. universities
j under the sponsorship of the Na
tional Students Association, and has
been at Stanford since Thursday.
Before coming here, he visited uni
versities in the East, and later this
week will go south to UCLA.
As a member of the International
Student Conferences "Co-Sec," Rad
jab has been contacting NSA groups
j in this country to promote further
international understanding among
students. He explained that the in
ternational body of student organi
zations is called the National Union
of Students NSA in the U.S. All of
the free world groups meet once a
year for the International Student
Conferences held last year at Istan
bul.
Radjab gave some background
material on the ISC and said that
immediately after World War II the
International Union of Students
(lUS) was created by the national
unions to promote their ideals for
student co-operation in the world.
| But the lUS gradually became an
organization of partisan political—
I Communist —leanings not satisfac
! Tory to a great part of the member

ship.
The fust International Student
Conference was held in Stockholm
iij 1949 to organize a student, not
a political group. The lUS was in
vited to this conference, but de-

elined, and has declined all invita
tions since.
"The students want a one world
idea, but it is hard to achieve,"
commented Radjab.
'I lie ISC, Radjab explained, was
not formed in opposition to lUS. It

was organized as a practical co
operation on student problems—how
to unite students, promote under
standing, and give technical aid to
students in underdeveloped coun
tries. The ISC also works closely
with World University Service in
student relief work.
The most needy areas of the
world, as far as student aid is con
cerned, .said Radjab, are in Africa,
south, west, east, and central; the
East, near, middle, and far; and
Latin America. These are the un
developed areas of the world, he
pointed out, and as a result, student
conditions are poor.
Radjab commented on American
students, saying that he thought
their education system is good. And
on Stanford, he was impressed by
the organization of the campus, and
by the friendly, interested attitude
of the students.
