# Students Hear Future Of Germany Discussed
## 
### EDA MENDELS 
The re-unification of Germany and her integration into the Eu
ropean community was the main topic of discussion yesterday
when five members of the German diplomatic corps met with
Stanford students at Bowman Alumni House.
The German officials, all of the consular staff at Bonn, are Miss
Hannelore Theodor, Norbert Josef *

Ling, Rudolf Ten Haaf, Ewstrati
Mahrdt, and Hans Dietrich Trevira
nus. They are on a 90-day tour of
the United States sponsored by the
U.S. Department of State, and have
been at Stanford since Friday.
'"The problem of reunification of
Germany is not a problem for Ger
many alone, but for all of Europe,"
Lang began. "The Iron Curtain is
the dividing line," Treviranus added,
"not a purely German division."
Lang expressed his opinion that
Li. "tern Germany should first rejoin
the l. 'ropean community, and then
reunite ,'ith Germany. He enlarged
that thougn most authorities recog
nize this two-step process, some put
unification of Germany before the
integration with the rest of Europe.
A DIVIDED GERMANY
Miss Theodor pointed out the eco
nomic and social implications of a
divided Germany. Nine million Ger
mans lived in the Eastern area. Now
Western Germany has to import the
agricultural products which she for
merly got from the east.
Mahrdt reported that a meeting
of representatives from East and
West to attempt reunification had
been suggested. But the West Ger
mans fear that the Eastern dole
gates would not express the true
opinion of the people of the East
ern half, unless tho: e representa
times would be chosen by free elec
tions. The United Nations had set
up a committee to arrange free elec
tions, but the East German govern
ment did not co-operate in this
venture.

The future of Europe lios in
peaceful integration, panel members
agreed. But when one drew the
comparison of the United States as
a most successful federation, others
demurred. Background and history
of the various European countries
arc far more different than those of
the colonics in the eighteenth cen
tury.
A member of the audience asked
to what degree the people in Europe
felt themselves to be citizens of Eu
rope, rather than of their native
countries. Panelists thought that
this idea had found a strong follow
ing, among students, but that the
older generation did not feel the
"strong bonds that unite Atlantic
youth." Treviranus added that until
Europeans have had a common ex
perience or have been exposed to
a new environment (as when they
come to the United States), they
are likely to continue feeling as
Frenchmen, Germans, or Holland
ers.
The visitors mentioned surprise at
"the high level of culture we found
in the East, in California, and even |
in the Midwest. Europeans like to !
think that the United States is the ;
master in technology, and barbarian
in other respects. But in towns ev- [
erywhere we found concerts, mu
seums, art in everyday life."
Religious life is stronger than they
had expected. "We saw churches
full, which is unusual in Europe." i
And the voluntary work which
Americans do for their community j
and church made a great imprcs- '
sion.
After the panel, the German visi- j
tors and members of the Institute of j
International Relations adjourned to
lh' home of lIE president A 1 Brouse
and his friends,
