# PAPOOSES BEAT LINCOLN
## Cal, Robinson Rip Frosh Five, 65-55 
### BOB MIEROW 
Unable to find a scorer to match deadly, jump-shooting Earl
Robinson, Stanford's freshman hoop squad suffered a 65-55 set
back at the hands of the California frosh Friday night in Berkeley.
Robinson, 6-1 guard from Berkeley High, singed the nets with
23 points to pace the Cubs in their eighth consecutive triumph of

tin- season.
Coach Dick Clegg's Papooses re
bounded Saturday night, coasting to
an easy 87-154 victory over Lincoln
High of San Francisco. The win was
the yearling squad's fifth of the year
against two defeats.
Cal's Cubs led most of the way
Friday night, holding a narrow 23-
19 edge at the half. Trailing Rob
inson in the scoring department was
Bob Washington, the All-Northern
California pivot man from Fresno.
The big center tallied 15 digits, and
held the two Papoose pivot men to
an aggregate total of four markers.
Lanky forward Bob Tealer and
guard Bernie Simpson also contrib
uted to the Cub scoring column,
tallying nine and eight points, re
spectively.
A pair of reserve forwards paced
the Card scorers. Eric Anderson
tallied 12, while Mike Gray was net
ting eight markers. Little Dean
Thomas, hustling Papoose guard,
also hit for eight points.
MANY FOULS
The Card quintet suffered from
excess fouling against the Cubs.
Thomas fouled out, while Jay Jack
son, Gary Van Galder, and Tony Vi
gna each committed four fouls.
The Papooses will have two

chances to gain revenge against the
Cal yearlings. The Indian frosh and
Cubs will battle on Feb. 25 and 2t!
in the closing series of the season.
The Card yearlings had little
trouble with the Mustangs Saturday
night, rolling to a 21-3 lead in the
first quarter. The prep quintet from
San Francisco closed the gap to 12
points late in the third quarter, but
a rally in which the Cards tallied 10
consecutive points left Lincoln far
behind.
PAPOOSE SCORING
Gary Van Galder and Jay Jackson
paced the Cards in scoring, tallying
12 and 11 points, respectively. Tony
Vigna with 10, Clint Waring who
garnered eight digits, and Pete La-
Chapelle with seven markers also
placed high in the Papoose scoring.
John Pflucger, Mustang center,
led the visiting prepsters with 23
points. Dave Osborne, who has av
eraged 15 markers per contest in
AAA competition, added 10 to the
Lynx total before fouling out.
This Saturday night, the frosh run
up against Menlo - Atherton High
School. Containing M-A ace Tom
Blackwood, who has tallied as much
as 42 in a single encounter this year,
will be the Papooses' big problem.

Unable to find a scorer to match deadly, jump-shooting Earl
Robinson, Stanford's freshman hoop squad suffered a 65-55 set
back at the hands of the California frosh Friday night in Berkeley.
Robinson, 6-1 guard from Berkeley High, singed the nets with
23 points to pace the Cubs in their eighth consecutive triumph of

tin- season.
Coach Dick Clegg's Papooses re
bounded Saturday night, coasting to
an easy 87-154 victory over Lincoln
High of San Francisco. The win was
the yearling squad's fifth of the year
against two defeats.
Cal's Cubs led most of the way
Friday night, holding a narrow 23-
19 edge at the half. Trailing Rob
inson in the scoring department was
Bob Washington, the All-Northern
California pivot man from Fresno.
The big center tallied 15 digits, and
held the two Papoose pivot men to
an aggregate total of four markers.
Lanky forward Bob Tealer and
guard Bernie Simpson also contrib
uted to the Cub scoring column,
tallying nine and eight points, re
spectively.
A pair of reserve forwards paced
the Card scorers. Eric Anderson
tallied 12, while Mike Gray was net
ting eight markers. Little Dean
Thomas, hustling Papoose guard,
also hit for eight points.
MANY FOULS
The Card quintet suffered from
excess fouling against the Cubs.
Thomas fouled out, while Jay Jack
son, Gary Van Galder, and Tony Vi
gna each committed four fouls.
The Papooses will have two

chances to gain revenge against the
Cal yearlings. The Indian frosh and
Cubs will battle on Feb. 25 and 2t!
in the closing series of the season.
The Card yearlings had little
trouble with the Mustangs Saturday
night, rolling to a 21-3 lead in the
first quarter. The prep quintet from
San Francisco closed the gap to 12
points late in the third quarter, but
a rally in which the Cards tallied 10
consecutive points left Lincoln far
behind.
PAPOOSE SCORING
Gary Van Galder and Jay Jackson
paced the Cards in scoring, tallying
12 and 11 points, respectively. Tony
Vigna with 10, Clint Waring who
garnered eight digits, and Pete La-
Chapelle with seven markers also
placed high in the Papoose scoring.
John Pflucger, Mustang center,
led the visiting prepsters with 23
points. Dave Osborne, who has av
eraged 15 markers per contest in
AAA competition, added 10 to the
Lynx total before fouling out.
This Saturday night, the frosh run
up against Menlo - Atherton High
School. Containing M-A ace Tom
Blackwood, who has tallied as much
as 42 in a single encounter this year,
will be the Papooses' big problem.
