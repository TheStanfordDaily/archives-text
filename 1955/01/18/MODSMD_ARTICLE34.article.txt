## 
### 
Stanford's boxing team was a vic
tim of injuries, eligibility problems,
and California Saturday afternoon
in Berkeley. The Indians could send
only four men against the Bears
and all lost.
San Francisco State rounded out
the card by winning one of four
other matches. Cal posted a 7-1
mark for the day.
Eric Hansen, 155-pound class, and
Charlie McLane, 132-pound class,
were declared ineligible for the year
last week: and Ed Renwick, 175-
pound class, was lost to the squad
for the season with a wrist injury.
Bill Tooley at 125 was the Cards'
lone experienced fighter and he lost
a close decision. Other defeated In
dians were Bill Clark (119), Ken
Doyle (125), and Dick Crockett
(IGS).
Cal didn't have a man to oppose
Bob Birkie, but the Tribe heavy
weight will box the feature match
against Cal Poly Wednesday in the
Pavilion.

Stanford's wrestling team opened
its season on an inglorious note Sat
urday at Berkeley, losing to the
1 University of California grunt-and
groaners, 26-6.
Only Pete Likins in the 137-pound
division and footballer Don Manou
kian in the heavyweight class could
win for the Card grapplers.
Likins' win was a bit on the sen
sational side, as the sophomore who
was undefeated as a freshman de
cisioned Wayne Loucks, Bear cap
tain and one of the top wrestlers on
the coast. Manoukian scored his
win over Cal's Phil Short.
Losers during the afternoon for
the Indians were Bob Fisher in the
123-pound class. Ray Miller in the
147-pound division, Stan Hartmann
at 157 pounds. Bob Beatie in the
167-pound division, and Bob Schaub
in the 177-pound class.
The Farm grapplers will attempt
to get their initial win of the season
Thursday night when they visit San
Jose State.
