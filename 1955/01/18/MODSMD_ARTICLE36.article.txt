### JIM BAKER 
With Bravo Dave Dunn sink
ing a free throw and a layup in
the last 27 seconds, the Stanford
Braves broke a 75-75 tie and de
feated a stubborn Moffet Field
five last night at the Pavilion,
78-75.
Dunn, fouled by Bob Ferguson of
Mofiett Field who bad tied the score
with his free .shot, flipped the first
shot through, but missed the sec
ond. Indian Ben Heirs grabbed the
rebound and Hipped to Dunn who
! drove for a lay-up to provide the
winning margin.
Dunn's three points climaxed a
comeback for the Indians, who only
made one of their first 15 shots and
at one time were bhind by 10. Mof
lett led at half-time, 36-35.
Cal Neish from San Mateo JC and
Bruce Iversen, former Stanford var
sity first-stringer, kept the visitors
in the game with good rebounding,
sharp passing, and 27 and 1G points,
respectively.
The game started slowly, with
Stanford hitting only one out of
their first 15 shots. Moflett jumped
off to a quick 10-point lead, but
Stanford used good ball handling to
whittle the lead to one point at
half-time.
The Braves tied the score with
two minutes gone in the second half,
and from there on the lead changed
several times. The Braves main
tained a six-point cushion for most
of the half, however? until the Fly
ers tied the count in the closing
minutes.
Bill Flanders and Bob McGrath
took second- and third-place honors
in scoring with 12 and 14 points
each. Denis Mahoney also looked
good with his timely jump shots
which kept the Braves in conten
tion.
