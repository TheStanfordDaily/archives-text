# Cagers to Leave for Hawaii
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
Stanford's basketball team
j leaves today on a trip that com
: pleasure with business.
; This morning at 10, Coach Howie
Dallmar, Trainer Connie Jarvis,
and 10 players leave from San
Francisco's International Airport
for three games in Hawaii.
The pleasure will consist of four
cloys in the sun - soaked islands,
while business consists of three
games, two against the same Uni
versity of Hawaii team that the In
dians beat here earlier in the year,
and one against a tough service all—
| star team.
The service team is composed of
ex-collegiate and pro stars, and it
handed Santa Clara a setback when
the Broncos toured the islands.
The trip gives Stanford a chance
! to get a head start when the confer
j ence race takes up again two and a

half weeks hence. Cal. SC, and the
Bruins all take this week and next
off for finals, while Stanford has the
advantage of three games to pre
vent staleness.
Stanford beat the Hawaii Rain
bows, 85-55, in mid-December, but
the Islanders were tired from almost
a week of daily play.
Santa Clara could manage only a
six - point margin in two games
against the Rainbows, and there is
a definite tendency to treat the trip
as a vacation. As such, however,

it is well deserved, for the Card I
cagers gave up their Christmas hoi- |
iday for a rugged Eastern swing j
and since then have faced UCLA
and Cal on successive weekends.
Dallmar will take the following 10
men on the trip: Bill Bond, Barry
Brown, Russ Lawler, George Sel
leck, Ron Tomsic, Hap Wagner. Ron
Wagner. Leo Schwaiger, Carlos Bea,
and Bill Flanders.
Head manager Bob Mishell, a pre
med student, chose to forego the
trip because of studies.


NO FAIR; WE WEREN'T READY—Three Cal basketballers and the outstretched hand of a fourth
are visible —and visibly unprepared—as Card guard George Selleck drives all alone for two
I points in the Pavilion Saturday night. The Cal player behind Selleck has been faked out of the
play, "The Hand" is not in position, Bob McKeen (6) seems planted where he is, and Mike Diaz
j (4) is running the wrong direction. —Daily photo by Frank Huntress
