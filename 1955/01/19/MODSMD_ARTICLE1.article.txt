# FULL DRESS INVASION
## Chiang Outpost Taken By Reds 
### 
TAIPEI, Wednesday, Jan. 19 (UP)â€”Red Chinese assault forces
captured the strategic Nationalist outpost of Yikiangshan Island
Tuesday in the first full dress invasion of the vest pocket war along
the China coast.
Massed land, sea, and air forces stormed the tiny stepping stone

to the Tachen Islands 200 miles
north of Formosa. By sheer weight
of numbers and explosives they
quickly overwhelmed the out
matched battalion of defenders.
Responsible quarters acknowl
edged early today that Yikiangshan
fell to the Reds at 6 p.m. (-2 a.m.
PST) after three and a half hours of
bloody fighting. The Peiping radio
blared a claim of "liberating" the
island in only two hours.
SEVENTH FLEET IN AREA
The U.S. Seventh Fleet was re
ported cruising in the Tachen area,
but took on part in the combat. Of
ficials here said no Americans were
on Yikiangshan, but a large Ameri
can detachment is on Tachen, 12
miles to the south.
Generalissimo Chiang Kai - shek
summoned his top military men into
a night confercnce. Spokesmen said
the Nationalists were expected to
react strongly, possibly with a
bombing attack on the Chinese
mainland.
Premier O. K. Yui warned that
the Reds had begun a long-expected
leapfrogging campaign against the
island outposts, hoping to blast open
the northern approaches to Formosa
itself.
U.S. STAYS OUT
In Washington Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles yesterday ap
parently ruled out any U.S. inter
vention at this stage in the new
Communist invasion.
He told a news conference the is
land of Yikiangshan is not vital to
the defense of Formosa, the Nation
alist stronghold which the United
States is committed to help protect.
Dulles also said the United States,
in general, favors peaceful means
to ease the tension between the Chi
nese Reds and Nationalists in the
Formosa Strait. He said this coun
try would not object to efforts by
the United Nations to obtain a
cease-fire.
FURTHER AGGRESSION
Military sources said Yikiangshan
could serve as a stepping stone to
further aggression in the Tachen Is
lands group north of Formosa. But
there apparently was no thought at
the Defense Department of U.S. in
tervention at this time.
Dulles said Yikiangshan is one of
four or five islands north of the
Tachens. He said most of them were
seized by the Reds last may with
out attracting "any particular at
tention at that time."
As for the Tachen Islands them
selves, Dulles said, "I would not say
that the Tachen Islands are in any
sense essential to the defense of
Formosa and the Pescadores, which
we do regard as vital to us."
