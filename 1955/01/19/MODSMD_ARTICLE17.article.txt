# Traffic Tie-Up Cure Proposed
## 
### 
Faced with an ever-growing campus traffic problem, Stanford if-:
currently pondering a measure which Business Manager Alf Bran
din believes will remedy the situation.
The plan relies on the full co-operation of non-student drivers
who use the campus roads to get to Palo Alto and other deslin-

tions in that area and direction. It
involves the re-routing of traffic and
closing of one road.
At present drivers from Los Altos
and vicinity travel up Junipero
Serra Boulevard, cross over to cam
pu' - on Frenchman's Road and May
field, and continue to Palo Alto on
either Palm Drive or Galvez Street.
The heavy use of this road during
the morning and early evening rush
hours creates quite a tie-up and
hazard.
Brandin points out that the seem
ingly logical route for these drivers
would be to take Page Mill Road or
Stanford Avenue to El Camino.
Both routes are quicker and easier,
but there has been one big bind.
Without a traffic light at either El
Camino junction it has been practi
cally impossible to make a left turn
toward Palo Alto during rush hours.
A stop light was erected during
the holidays, however, making the
route ideal. With this in mind
Brandin would like to block off
Frenchman's Road to ensure the use
of Page Mill and lighten the campus
traffic load.
The other heavy traffic area origi
nates southwest of the campus.
Drivers coming from the golf course
area take Junipero Serra to Los Ar
boles, cut over to the main campus
on Santa Teresa (which runs by La
gunita and Roble), and reach Palo
Alto via Lomita and Palm Drives.
A survey was taken during the
vacation to check the flow of non
student traffic between 7 a.m. and
(j p.m. During that period 6.000 cars
used Junipero Serra, 1,800 of which
turned down Los Arboles toward
campus.
Brandin is assured of a ready
made solution in the near future.
Stanford, with the co-operation of
Santa Clara and San Mateo coun

ties, will begin construction in
March of a bridge which will spa
San Francisquito Creek and .link
Willow Road in Menlo Park to a i
cently completed Willow Road o
campus. The new road begins at th
junction of Sand Hill and Alp
Roads and runs past the third ho 1
of the golf course and by the Stan
ford Regional Shopping Center er.fi
ing up at the creek. Once the brkU o
is finished, city traffic is expect?
to use the new route, according to
Brandin.
