# Lecturer Tells Development of Photography

### SALLY TRAPNELL 
The attempt to suspend time
as an important factor in the de
velopment of photography was
the topic of Beaumont Newhall's
talk on "Photography and the
Suspension of Time" at last
night's Tuesday Series program.
Newhall, curator of the Eastman
Institute at Rochester, New York,
put special emphasis on the experi
ments performed by Eadweard
Muybridge at the request of Leland
Stanford at his Palo Alto stock farm
in 1877.
Muybridge, a well - known San
Francisco photographer, was hired
by Senator Stanford to help settle a
bet on whether a trotting horse has
all four feet off the ground at any
point in its stride. By taking a se
ries of 12 pictures as the horse
went down the track, using 12 cam
eras, Muybridge was able to win
Stanford's bet for him. The photo
graphs were later run on a special
magic lantern projector, providing
the first motion picture.
HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY
Newhall's talk also included many
slides showing the development, of
clarity and detail in the history of
photography.
This attempt actually began in the
later part of the Renaissance, when
painters began to make their pic
tures as true to life as possible, us
ing perspective and tracing figures
from glass plates. By the time the
daguerreotype was invented, many
paintings, especially still life, were
as detailed as any photograph.
The great task of photographers,
at first, was to cut down the length
of exposure time so that people and
moving objects could be clearly
shown. Slides of street scenes and
news photos, taken about 1860 and
remarkable for their clarity, were
shown. For these, however, the sub
jects had to remain stationary.
MOTION PICTURE
The logical culmination for this
desire for action and detail was the
motion picture. In this medium the
subject could move about freely,
and clarity was obtained by taking
a large number of pictures in a short
period of time.
Since this invention, the main
steps forward in photography have
been in the field of smaller, portable
cameras and better chemicals for
processing pictures. Progress has
also been made in the composition
of photographs. Pictures by Alfred
Stieglitz were among those shown
to demonstrate this trend.
