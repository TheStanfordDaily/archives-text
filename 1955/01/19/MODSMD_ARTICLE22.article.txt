# 'Underway on Nuclear Power'
## 
### 
It took the Navy just four terse words to
launch a new era in scientific history Monday.
At 11:01 a.m. the 3000-ton submarine Nautilus
slipped from her berth at a Connecticut dock,
and moments later came the announcement
-from the bridge: "Underway on nuclear
power."
It was a little less than 10 years ago, when
most of today's Stanford students were frolic
ing about grammar school playgrounds, that
the world learned first hand the meaning of the
term "nuclear power."
It came in the form of a blinding flash and a

deadly mushroom cloud, and it was spelled
"HIROSHIMA."
Men shuddered and were afraid, but nuclear
research went on. After the A-bomb came the
H-bomb and the cobalt bomb, and men began
to wonder if it were even possible to harness
the atom's terrifying power for peacetime use.
That is why the Nautilus, built for war, offers
new hope for the nuclear age. The atom has
been harnessed, dependent on the man at the
helm for its use and direction.
And the message which announced this de
velopment may well be the slogan for a world
at peaceâ€”underway on nuclear power.
