# An International Language
## 
### 
Harry lames' famous trumpet will be speak
ing an international language Saturday after
noon in Memorial Auditorium.
The benefits from this sophomore class
sponsored Jaz.z Concert, the first in Stanford's
history, will go toward tuition for one, or pos
sibly two, foreign students.
A unique musical treat, the concert will also
heighten Stanford's already glowing reputation
in the field of foreign scholarships.
James is a man who has played every type
of jazz trumpet since the inception of that art
form. He has trumpeted through the Chicago
school of the 20's, the swing of the 30's, the

bop era of the 40's, and the rebirth of big band
jazz in the 50's.
His concert Saturday will mean more foreign
students at Stanford next year, studying and
at the same time getting an understanding of
our way of life.
By this concert, the sophomore class is testi
fying its belief that inter-nation communcation
is one of the most important steps toward inter
national understanding.
The concert itself will assure an afternoon
of wonderful music.
The money from the concert will go to a
good cause.
It is an unbeatable combination.
