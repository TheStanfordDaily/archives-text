### RIC TEAGUE 
Of Into, a number of persons have come by the
idea that I am Stanford's answer to the gal who
handles the letters of the lovelorn for old Fifth and
Mission. Jan Flanders, I will call myself.
"Dear Jan: I am fifteen years old and my sixteen
year-old boy friend, a very sweet football player,
wants me to elope to Reno with him. He has twelve
dollars in the bank and ha<: made two payments on
his mfodel A. When he goes to college, he will be
offered a job as a hasher in a living group. I love
him very much and like to snuggle up next, to him in
movies and things like that. My mother and father
don't like him, though. They say a sixteen year-old
football player is too young to like martinis and mar
riage and all the good things in life. His father likes
me and says that he wishes I were his daughter be
cause he has never had one.
"Now my problem is this: Do you think that I
should run away to Reno with my football player?"
The pi(ce war. signed "Bewitched, Bothered and Be
wildered."
Well, doll, here is my solution to your problem.
You just take your football player and run right
down to your nearest used-car dealer and sell the

model A. Then go to his bank and. collect his twelve
dollars. Now, hustle over to Bennie's Cigar Em
porium and put the whole roll on Remember Mama,
across the board, at Santa Anita.
Remember Mamma is an obvious overlay, dolly,
and should come romping home with three lengths
to spare. Her last three races were for purses of
$10,000 and, although she did poorly, her speed ratings
were 91, 00, and 93. She carried 118 all three times
and this time she has an apprentice up and that's
good for five pounds and the weight should be about
107.
As you can see, sugar, this is the handiest way to
build a little capital for the forthcoming nuptials.
As for the idea that sixteen year-old Saturday heroes
shouldn't like martinis and marriage, well! What, 1
ask, should a sixteen year-old football player like?
The more erotic thrills iike popcorn in the back row?
No, doll, you and your swain ignore the Victorian
attitudes of retrogressive parents and take the next
(light to Reno. Marryin' Sarn will fix you up so you
can live a life of matrimonial bliss as hasher and
wife.
What a sweet young lady!

and should come romping home with three lengths
to spare. Her last three races were for purses of
$10,000 and, although she did poorly, her speed ratings
were 91, 00, and 93. She carried 118 all three times
and this time she has an apprentice up and that's
good for five pounds and the weight should be about
107.
As you can see, sugar, this is the handiest way to
build a little capital for the forthcoming nuptials.
As for the idea that sixteen year-old Saturday heroes
shouldn't like martinis and marriage, well! What, 1
ask, should a sixteen year-old football player like?
The more erotic thrills iike popcorn in the back row?
No, doll, you and your swain ignore the Victorian
attitudes of retrogressive parents and take the next
(light to Reno. Marryin' Sarn will fix you up so you
can live a life of matrimonial bliss as hasher and
wife.
What a sweet young lady!
Of Into, a number of persons have come by the
idea that I am Stanford's answer to the gal who
handles the letters of the lovelorn for old Fifth and
Mission. Jan Flanders, I will call myself.
"Dear Jan: I am fifteen years old and my sixteen
year-old boy friend, a very sweet football player,
wants me to elope to Reno with him. He has twelve
dollars in the bank and ha<: made two payments on
his mfodel A. When he goes to college, he will be
offered a job as a hasher in a living group. I love
him very much and like to snuggle up next, to him in
movies and things like that. My mother and father
don't like him, though. They say a sixteen year-old
football player is too young to like martinis and mar
riage and all the good things in life. His father likes
me and says that he wishes I were his daughter be
cause he has never had one.
"Now my problem is this: Do you think that I
should run away to Reno with my football player?"
The pi(ce war. signed "Bewitched, Bothered and Be
wildered."
Well, doll, here is my solution to your problem.
You just take your football player and run right
down to your nearest used-car dealer and sell the

model A. Then go to his bank and. collect his twelve
dollars. Now, hustle over to Bennie's Cigar Em
porium and put the whole roll on Remember Mama,
across the board, at Santa Anita.
Remember Mamma is an obvious overlay, dolly,
and should come romping home with three lengths
to spare. Her last three races were for purses of
$10,000 and, although she did poorly, her speed ratings
were 91, 00, and 93. She carried 118 all three times
