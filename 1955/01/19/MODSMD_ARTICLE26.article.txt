# Chance to Live Abroad Offered Farm Students
## 
### EDA MENDELS 
Spending a month as a brother or sister in a foreign family, then
touring the countryâ€” that is the program offered by the Experi
ment in International Living.
The Experiment is a non-profit, educational corporation that ad
ministers a program of foreign travel and exchange lor students

in 21 countries, with the accent on
promoting international understand
ing and respect. Address of head
quarters is the Experiment in Inter
national Living, Putney, Vt.
Experimenters go abroad in
groups of 10 with a trained leader.
For a month they live in one town,
each group member joining a dif
ferent family. There they see how
the people live, what their problems
and amusements are, and how they
think about the multitude of issues
that people everywhere face daily.
RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE
Trans - Atlantic transportation is
on inexpensive student ships. Liv
ing with private families and profit
ing from the services of volunteers,
Experimenters can go abroad more
cheaply than individual travelers.
Prices for two months in Europe,
including the round trip from Now

All members of the Experiment
in International Living and other
students who may be interested in
traveling with the Experiment are
invited to a meeting tonight, Rob
Kline and Cam Strong announced.
It will be held at 7:110 at CGO
Homer Avenue in Halo Alto.
Rides will leave the Cellar at 7:15.
At this meeting old Experiment
ers will show slides and swap sto
ries of their experiences, and will
try to answer question* about "the
Experiment way" for newcomers.

York, range from $G9O to $755. The
Mexican Experiment, starting from
Laredo, Texas, costs $335.
The most expensive trip is to Ja
pan, three months for $1,445. That
and the Indian Experiment ($1,250)
begin in mid-August and last three
months each. The Japanese tour will
be conducted by Donald B. Watt,
Sr., founder of the Experiment, and
Mrs. Watt.
FOREIGN LANGUAGE
Most, of the groups are English
speaking, but groups to Austria,
France, Germany, Italy, Mexico,
and Spain are expected to speak the
language of the country in which
they are living. Some of these
countries will host English-speaking
groups too. Experimenters who have
spoken a foreign language with their
families abroad have remarked on
their greatly increased facility with
the language.
During their month with the fam
ilies, Experimenters participate in
the daily lives of their foreign fami
lies. They may go to school with
their brothers or sisters, help the
"parents" in their store, learn to
cook new meals, practice different
sports, attend foreign social func
tions, sing their hosts' songs. By
living as his foreign brothers and
sisters do, the American student
gains insight into their mode of life
and the reasons for it.

After living with the families, Ex
perimenters invite their foreign
brothers and sisters on a tour of the
most interesting places of the coun
try or a neighboring land. Often
these are camping trip:-:.
Approximately 20 former Experi
menters are enrolled at Stanford
now. Co-ordinators of Experiment
publicity on campus are Cam Strong
and Rob Kline. Miss Strong lias been
an Experimenter in France and Yu
goslavia, Kline in Mexico, France,
and Colombia. Both of them will
gladly furnish more information
about the Experiment. They can
be contacted at the Institute of In
ternational Relations.
