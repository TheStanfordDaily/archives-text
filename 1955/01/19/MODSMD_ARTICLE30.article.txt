# Taylor Spends Winter On 'Fruit Salad' Circuit
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
A busy man during the off season
is Stanford head football coach
Chuck Taylor. Chuck is now in the
midst of a three month High School
and Alumni banquet tour. This tour,
better known to those in the trade as
the fruit salad circuit, is a five state
trip to most of the major cities in
Washington, Oregon, California, and
Nevada, plus a few stops in Arizona.
Aside from speaking at the ban
quets, Taylor uses his travels to see
various members of Stanford's fast
growing scouting organization. At
present this group includes some 700
members throughout the coast. Each
of the more active members of the
club scouts local high school athletics
in his home town and keeps the Stan
ford football heads informed on any
promising talent in that area.
BUCK CLUB EXPLAINED
One of the most important organi
zations attached to Stanford's ath
letic system is the Buck Club. This
club is made up of approximately
.'5OOO members who contribute a total
of $80,000 per year to help athletes
who need financial aid. The Buck
Club's work enables the university
io offer 105 partial and full grants to
men who qualify scholastically. And

of these 105 grants, 57 are reserved
for football.
Since Pacific Coast Conference
rules won't allow coaches to talk to
any prospective athlete off the uni
versity campus, boys interested in at
tending Stanford are contacted by
members of the Buck or Scouting
clubs and are in this way informed
of the benefits of attending Stanford.
The conference also sanctions their
paying of a boy's way to visit the
campus where he is able to meet
Chuck and see the university.
Another restricting rule of the
coaches in talent hunting is the re
quirance of a prospect to make the
first move in contacting the coach
about his interest in the university.
Before this, Taylor is unable to cor
respond in any manner with a boy.
It is therefore an important function
of the scouting organization to get a
potential star to write or visit the
Farm's coaching staff.
Chuck's banquet engagements will
keep him busy until the end of Feb
ruary when hp will begin prepara
tions for Spring practice. In the
meantime Chuck will strengthen the
bonds in his scouting family with
personal visits and speeches.

is Stanford head football coach
Chuck Taylor. Chuck is now in the
midst of a three month High School
and Alumni banquet tour. This tour,
better known to those in the trade as
the fruit salad circuit, is a five state
trip to most of the major cities in
Washington, Oregon, California, and
Nevada, plus a few stops in Arizona.
Aside from speaking at the ban
quets, Taylor uses his travels to see
various members of Stanford's fast
growing scouting organization. At
present this group includes some 700
members throughout the coast. Each
of the more active members of the
club scouts local high school athletics
in his home town and keeps the Stan
ford football heads informed on any
promising talent in that area.
BUCK CLUB EXPLAINED
One of the most important organi
zations attached to Stanford's ath
letic system is the Buck Club. This
club is made up of approximately
.'5OOO members who contribute a total
of $80,000 per year to help athletes
who need financial aid. The Buck
Club's work enables the university
io offer 105 partial and full grants to
men who qualify scholastically. And

of these 105 grants, 57 are reserved
for football.
Since Pacific Coast Conference
rules won't allow coaches to talk to
any prospective athlete off the uni
versity campus, boys interested in at
tending Stanford are contacted by
members of the Buck or Scouting
clubs and are in this way informed
of the benefits of attending Stanford.
The conference also sanctions their
paying of a boy's way to visit the
campus where he is able to meet
Chuck and see the university.
Another restricting rule of the
coaches in talent hunting is the re
quirance of a prospect to make the
first move in contacting the coach
about his interest in the university.
Before this, Taylor is unable to cor
respond in any manner with a boy.
It is therefore an important function
of the scouting organization to get a
potential star to write or visit the
Farm's coaching staff.
Chuck's banquet engagements will
keep him busy until the end of Feb
ruary when hp will begin prepara
tions for Spring practice. In the
meantime Chuck will strengthen the
bonds in his scouting family with
personal visits and speeches.
