# McFarland Leads Encina Center I to Win Over 3 East
## 
### 
The Encina Center I team defeat
ed a scrappy 3 East squad in ;i
closely contested intramural basket
ball tilt last night. The Center team,
led by Bob McFarland, built up a
five-point half-time lead to win 29
to 27.
Soon after the opening jump, Mc-
Farland and Gary Tripp began hit
ting for the winners and the game
threatened to become a runaway.
At this point John McNally and Bob
McCulloch of 3 East hit with a trio
of driving lay-ups to bring the los
ers within range at the intermission,
13 to 17.
After the half, Pete Bowes joined
McFarland and Tripp in leading the
center wingers. McFarland's 13
points were high for both teams,
followed by Tripps' eight. McNally
led the losers with seven points.
