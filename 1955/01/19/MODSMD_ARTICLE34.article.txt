HE DRIVES—Ron Tomsic, Indian cage sharpshooter, drives past
Berkeley Bears' Ev McKeen and Clif Mayne to net a Held goal
during Stanford's rout of Cal on Saturday night in the Pavilion.
Tomsic scored 34 points over the weekend to lead coach Howie
Dallmar's squad in that department. His biggest contribution,
however, was a set shot in the final seconds of Friday's game
which won for Stanford, 59-57. —Daily photo by Frank Huntress
