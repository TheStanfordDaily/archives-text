# Midnight Tonight: Stanford Cagers Play Hawaii Tilt
## 
### 
While basketball players from
other PCC Southern Division
schools are busy burning the mid
night oil, Stanford's cagers will be
"playing the midnight basketball."
Tonight they are scheduled to
play the University of Hawaii at
Honolulu. Because of the time dif
ferential the game won't be starting
until midnight, California time. The
contest is the first of three games to
be played in the Islands.
A second tilt is scheduled against
Hawaii, whom the Cards defeated
easily at Stanford earlier in the
year. The third game is against a
tough Ail-Star team.
Ten players, Coach Howie Dall
mar, and Trainer Connie Jarvis
made the trip. They will return
next Sunday and begin preparation
then for a tough Cow Palace week
end against USF and Santa Clara.
The following weekend, PCC play
resumes with defending champion
USC traveling to Stanford.
