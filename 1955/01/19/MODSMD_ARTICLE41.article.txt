# Farm Student Describes Life at Berlin University

### 
(Editor's note: The following
are excerpts from a letter received
recently by the Stanford Institute
of International Relations from
Keith Nelson, former Stanford
student now studying at the Free
University of Berlin. Application
blanks for Stanford students in
terested in attending the Free Uni
versity next academic year arc
now available at the ASSU office.
The scholarship is open to both
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents. The deadline for filing ap
plications is Jan. 111.)
"Whenever a person goes to a
famous place, the first thing he
has to do is to tear down all the
ideas of what he thought it would
be like: then he can begin to re
build his thoughts from what he
really sees.
"That's what I'm doing at the
present time. In the first place, Ber
lin is much larger in area than I had
ever imagined. In the second place,
not all of Berlin was destroyed in
the war, only the center. This
brings me to a third first impres
sion. which is that the Free Uni
versity is far from the ramshackle
afTair one might conceive of in re
gard to a six-year-old institution.
"In fact, it seems to me that the
University should be described as a
very beautiful school. The original
buildings are not all in one area nor
are they fancy, but they are large,
well taken care of, and pleasant in
appearance. An attractive and mod
ernistic Evangelical Church looks
down on the center of the Free Uni
versity through a very nice park.
"These past few days have been
busy ones for me. Took the U.S.
Army Special Services tour of West

and East Berlin. What a difference
between them! Did some exploring
this side of the line on my own.
Took in an SED rally in Steglitz.
Had a very pleasant evening with
the Berlin Rotary Club. Attended
an orientation course given by the
Columbus Gesellschaft for Ameri
can students. Participated in a rath
er chaotic but interesting meeting of
the Stanford Affiliation Committee.
"Speaking seriously, I think the
Berlin affiliation is now entering a
very critical phase. The amount of
material aid that the FU needs from
Stanford is ever dwindling in size
and significance. The success of the
(King's Men) concert last quarter
will bring to an end the old problem
of how to establish a permanent
student exchange. Solid things like
books and money are easier to work
with, but now we must look in a
new direction and enlarge the in
tellectual side of the relationship."
