# Rushing the Season

BRRRRRR!—First this season to test the water at Lake Lagunita
is Lynn Lercara of Storey House. She says the water's fine . . .
but cold. Lake Lag has been rising rapidly in the recent rains,
which have totaled 7.18 inches since the first of the year. That's
slightly below the annual average for this time, but the lake has
only about four feet to go to reach its normal level.
