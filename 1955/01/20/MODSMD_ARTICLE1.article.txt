# Frosh Cards Will Sell For Limited Time Only
## 
### 
Freshman class card sales are continuing today in all freshman
dorms. The sale will last through Friday, Jan. 28.
The cards cost $5 and are good for a student's four undergrad
uate years at Stanford. Students may purchase the cards from the
freshman excom member assigned to their particular corridor

or wing.
Class of '58 card holders will re
ceive the class paper free for four
years, and will be admitted without
charge to class assemblies, class tal
ent shows, the Frosh-Soph Jambo
ree, the Cal - Stanford frosh ex
change, and the class beach party.
A card also otters the holder re
duced rates at the Frosh Dance,
class dances in later years, the ex
change dance with Cal, class parties,
and class reunions.
According to freshman excom,
many other activities such as a pa
jama dance and firesides after the
Sunday Night Movies have been
planned for card holders throughout
this year, but the number of activi
ties will depend on the number of
class cards sold.
Freshman cxcom has also stated
that this is the only time during a
student's four years at Stanford
that he is asked to give money to
his class. It was further pointed out
that the card sales are the sole
means of revenue for the class of
'58 treasury, so the success of the
class depends on the success of the
sale.
