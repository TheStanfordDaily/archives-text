TAIPEI, Thursday, Jan. 20 (UP)
—Strong Chinese Communist in
vasion forces aimed a giant
pincers at the bomb battered
Tachen Islands today and the Na
tionalist defenders braced for an
assault expected at any time.
The Rods poured reinforcements
into newly conquered Yikiangshan,
12 miles north of Tachen, and
massed an invasion fleet against Pi
shan, 32 miles to the south.
They hammered the key base of
Formosa's northern flank with a
record 200-plane assault, and lobbed
scores of shells into Pish,an from
field guns on other nearby islands.
The situation is critical, national
military sources said.
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's
air force lashed back as the long
slugfest along the China coast
mounted swiftly to a full-scale war.

Meanwhile, in Washington, Presi
dent Eisenhower said today he
would like to see the United Nations
use "its good offices" to try to ar
range a cease-fire in the snowball
ing war between the Chinese Reds
and the Chinese Nationalists.
The President fully agreed with
Secretary of State John Foster Dul
les that the Red-attacked Tachen
Islands "are not a vital element, as
we see it," to the defense of Gen
eralissimo Chiang Kai-shek's For
mosan bastion and the Pescadores
Islands.
But, while he doubted U.N. inter
vention would accomplish much, he
told a news conference he would
like to see such action "because
wherever there is any kind of fight
ing and open violence in the world,
there is always a powder keg."
