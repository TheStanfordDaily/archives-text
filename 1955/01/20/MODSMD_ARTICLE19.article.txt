# SRI Gets Source Of Radioactivity
## 
### 
Stanford Research Institute's Ra
diation Engineering Laboratory has
obtained an additional 2,000 - curie
source of radioactivity from the
Atomic Energy Commission's
Brookhaven National Laboratory.
(The curie is the unit of measure
ment of atomic disintegrations per
second of radioactive material.)
The new shipment nearly doubles
the Institute's source of cobalt 60
and makes it possible for experi
ments in the cold sterilization of
food and the effects of radiation on
materials to be carried out in half
the time previously required.
