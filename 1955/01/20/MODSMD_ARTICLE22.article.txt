## 
### 
Members of the Stanford Folk
dancers will perform at Yosemite
National Park this weekend, pre
senting an exhibition of European
and American folk dances.
The main feature of the group's
program will be a medley of three
folk dances from Israel and two
complete dances from the same
country. Some of these dances were
taught to the Folkdancers by Mi
chael Maschler, a graduate student
in math from Israel.
The dancers will wear special Is
raeli costumes for this part of the
program and will later change into
calicos and blue jeans to do some
American square dancing.
Another part of the program will
be dances from European countries,
including Russia, Denmark, Yugo
slavia, and Germany.
Participating in the exhibition
will be Peggy and Bud Rorden, Al
berta and Alan Wilmunder, Michael
Maschler, Pete Holm, Phil Diether,
Ann Knoles, Lue Jean Woodard, and
Pat Hofmann. Faculty adviser for
the Folkdancers is Mrs. Miriam Lid
stcr, professor of womens' physical
education.
The Folkdancers will leave for
Yosemite tomorrow and will give
their performance on Saturday.
They will receive free room and
board during their stay.
