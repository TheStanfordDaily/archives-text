## "Okay – Cut Out The Laughing And Let's Read This" A 						Realistic Compromise 
### 
The President's proposed budget for the com
ing fiscal year struck Congress like flint and
steel as usual. But the sparks crossed party
lines and indicated that the Administration's
recommendations are a realistic compromise
between the desirable and the necessary.
Democrats —who usually favor a high level
of qovernrnent spending and sanction deficit
budgeting—expressed disappointment in the
administration's failure to produce the (cam
paign) promised balanced budget, along with
many Republicans.
Other Republicans, and many Democrats, re
plied with House GOP Leader Joseph W. Martin
Jr. that the budget was a "realistic approach"
and that the deficit "certainly is not inflation
ary," showing that the Administration "has our
finances under control."
The budget is astronomical, of course, but it
is lower than this year's in total expenditures
and the proposed deficit is half this year's.
Again, a compromise between the spenders
and the balancers.
The budget has received a great deal of
criticism because there are no specific pro
visions for expanding the educational system.
The 1224-page document does mention an un
defined program for building more schools
and training more scientists and researchers,
however. These may be elaborated in subse
quent messages to Congress—we hope!
And where are the proposed cuts in federal

appropriations? Chiefly in agriculture and ag
ricultural resources, which are trimmed by 871
millions for next year. Natural resources are
scheduled for a cut of 180 millions.
In the overall picture, the major hunk of na
tional income will be spent on atomic-armed
air power and continental defense. Total spend
ing is cut about 1 billion and national income is
up about one billion, so that the estimated na
tional deficit will drop from this year's 4.5
billion to 2.4 billion.
As we anticipate the coming Congressional
debates on the budget, we wonder who will de
fend the agriculture department Jrom the pro
posed cuts—Republican representatives of Re
publican agricultural states, or Democrats who
have fought for farm price supports?
Who will try the hardest to eliminate the
deficit—Republicans who promised to do so
during the campaign or Democrats who profess
regrets that they have failed to carry out the
promise? Who will try to trim defense spend
ing—Republicans whose administration drafted
the budget, or Democrats whose administration
strongly favored high defense expenditures?
Battles will be fought, party lines upheld, and
party lines crossed. It will not be the "usual"
scene with Republicans and Democrats drawn
up in neat ranks defending their political
theories. But we think this Congress will be
able to work out and compromise the differ
ences and produce a realistic, workable budget
for next year.
