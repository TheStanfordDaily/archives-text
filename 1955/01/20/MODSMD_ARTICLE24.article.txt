# BULL SESSION

### RIC TEAGUE 
Since (he opening day of this quarter, a number of
vouiv hucksters have been assaulting my pocketbook
. i 'I : aying ''Bud,'' (lots of people who don't know my
7>ame call me Bud) . . . "Bud," they say, "why don't
you purchase a ticket or two to the Harry James
concert we are throwing in Mem Aud on the 22nd?"
"Because I don't have the scratch," I reply, and
button thi Hap over my pocket. Well, sir, they caught
me coming out of the cellar the other day. I had just
exchanged my rubberized signature for a five-dollar
bill and was vulnerable. "See you at the James
es ion," good-byed the charming young purveyor.
In retrospect (this is a neat, scholarly phrase which
means you just now started thinking about something
vo'i should have thought about earlier)i I am. glad I
li.xv- those tickets. Mr. James is a trumpet player
< wide acclaim. And he also has a very attractive
ile. A j ifted trumpeter with an attractive wife is a
t.'iity on the Stanford campus and I intend to go to
.!em Aud to find out what kind of trumpet playing
gets a Betty Grable.
I was a bugler in the Army for awhile. My clarion
i..II at 5:45 in the morning aroused a great many efi
: led souls;. But never a Betty Grable. So I will go
; rid listvn to Harry James play his trumpet.
Mr. .Jam< cOmes from a musical family. His father
wa: a tromboni I in a circus band. Bunk Johnson,
one of the originators of American jazz, played his

cornet with the older Jaines in a cirrus in Texas back
in the old days and said thai Harry's dad knew his
way around the bass clef.
The younger James knows his way around the
treble clef. He has been in the business a long time,
now, and has picked up quite a bit in the art of
trumpeting. In the 'twenties, a gum-chewing red
head, Loring "Red" Nichols organized an orchestra
and went by the name of Red Nichols and his Five
Pennies. The penny was worth more then. There
were a lot of pennies.
Harry James was one of Iho pennies. So were Glenn
Miller, Jack Teagarden, Gene Krtipa, Benny Good
man, Jimmy Dorsey, and quite a few other gentle
men who went from Nichols to dollars. In the thirties,
James was featured in the great Benny Goodman
band that won Goodman the title "King of Swing."
Since then, he's been on his own, playing "Ciri-biri
bin" for Miss Grable.
And Saturday Mr. James and his accomplices will
peel the plaster from the walls of Mem Aud. The
money for the tickets was well-spent. It is prac
tically axiomatic in the music world that IF James
is playirtg, THEN you get your money's worth.
I will be there listening to a great figure in Ameri
can popular music and jaz#, the man who married
Betty James.
