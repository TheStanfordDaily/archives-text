Glen Scobey (Pop) Warner was honored recently by the fresh
men of Village 214. The former head football coach of Stanford
horn 1924 to 1932 passed away last Sept. 7.
Highly revered by Stanford students and alumni alike, Pop
Warner's death was felt by many lo be a personal loss. And it was

lo his memory that the freshmen
in Village 214 paid tribute by
voting to name their hall after
him.
While at Stanford, Pop Warner's
teams amassed an excellent record
of 65 wins to 17 losses. Warner was
also responsible for the famous
wing - back formation which re
ceived nation-wide acclaim to the
extent of being copied by a large
number of football coaches around
the country.
GRID IMMORTAL
Pop Warner is an immortal to
football now, but the boys in War
ner Hall hope to permanently asso
ciate his name with Stanford for as
long as this University exists. They
are therefore planning to submit
the name "Warner Hall" to the Uni
versity for the new freshman dormi
tory that is being built.
Three other Village freshman
living residences have also been
named. Dost-i Hall is the name
which was given to Village 21(> last
year. The word "Dost-i" means

"friendship" in the language of Af
ghanistan.
Last year', Dost-i Hall contained
many foreign students and they de
cided that this name would be most
fittting as an indication of the at
mosphere of international friendship
that exists on the campus. The
present freshmen living there are
quite proud of their unique name.
CARDINAL HALL
Cardinal Hall is the name by
which Village 210 has been known
for over three years. One of the
first Village residences to be named,
the origin of the title is more or less
self-evident according to the spon
sor there.
Another Village freshman resi
dence named last quarter is Whalen
Hall, Village 208. The residents there
thought so highly of their sponsor,
John Whalen, that they attached his
name to their living group.
All names of residences were first
approved by the University author
ities, who feel that the names cho
sen were quite fitting and in keep
ing with tradition here on the Farm.
