which is to open in the Little The

"Misalliance," according to direc
tor Wendell Cole, is one of Shaw's
most farcical plays, with a maxi
mum of almost slapstick plot com
plications.
But, as always with Shaw, ideas
are at the center of the stage. The
satire of "Misalliance" is directed
mainly at family life: the eternal
battle of man and woman, parent
and child.
The play deals with an extraordi
narily eventful afternoon in the life
of the Tarletons, an English family,
which, though not born to the aris
tocracy, manages to live as if it were,
thanks to the Tarleton Underwear
Company.
Mr. Tarleton dreams of philoso
phy while he makes B.V.D.'s, but
his daughter Hypatia is tired of be
ing good and wants desperately to
be wicked. Johnny Tarleton, on the
other hand, is a forthright young
man who despises thinkers alto
gether, and claims that the "natural
man" is the world's only real doer
and maker. Mrs. Tarleton, in the
meanwhile, actually manages the
lives of all the family.
Into this not exactly placid fam
ily group comes the elderly Lord
Summerhays and his foppish son
Bcntly, who is engaged to Hypatia;
a gunman who appears to be after
Mr. Tarleton; and two mysterious
aviators who crash into the green
house.
The show runs through Jan. 29 and
Feb. 2-5. A final performance will
be given Feb. 11 at the Northwest
Drama Conference in Santa Rosa.
