### BOB DURAND 
Athletes from all over the Western Hemisphere will gather at Mexico City early in March for
the second annual Pan American Sportive Games which will be held under the auspices of the
International Olympic Committee from March 12 to 26.
The United States will send a team of approximately 300 competitors plus 60 officials and
coaches, according to J. Lyman Bingham, executive director of the United States Olympic Games 1
Committee.
Among those tutoring the American athletes will be Stanford's varsity swimming and diving

coach, Tom Kaynie.
Haynie, who has been a member
of the Olympic Committee for eight
years, will supervise the tryouts to
be held on Feb. 25 and 2G, and then
coach the 18 top swimmers and div
ers in the country in preparation for
the Games.
He will be assisted by a manager,
Dr. Hal Henning of Naperville, Illi
nois, also a member of the Commit
tee.

The swimming tryouts will be
held simultaneously at Yale Uni
versity's indoor pool and at the Na
val Base at Treasure Island here in
the Bay Area. Competition for the
diving team will take place at the
Coral Casino in Santa Barbara.
In the last Pan American Games,
which were held in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, the swimming delegation
paced a top-flight American per
formance in the competitions.
As to the United States' chances
this winter, Haynie stated that in
the swimming and other sports they
were "excellent, although the alti
tude (7,200 feet at Mexico City)
might hurt us."
According to Haynie, the Ameri
can swimmers will probably be led
by several former Olympic stand
outs. Among them are Clark Scho
ler, 100-meter champion in 1952, Jim
McClain, and Wayne Moore. An
other former competitor, Bob Clot-

I worthy, will head the list of divers.

: Games will be held are regarded as
among the finest in the world. The

point of all the facilities, stands out
in the world for its original con
ception and outstanding advantages,
which include a merger of old build
ing methods and knowledge with
up-to-date technique, and maximum
safety in the transportation and ac
commodation of 100,000 spectators.

CHAMPIONSHIP CALIBER—This is the brand-new 100,000-capacity track and field University
Stadium at the University of Mexico in Mexico City where the Pan American Games will be held
in March. It is just one of many modern, functionally-designed, and accommodating sports fa
cilities in that area, which will host the second annual Games. The United States swimming dele
gation to the Games, which are held under the auspices of the International Olympic Committee,
will be coached by Stanford varsity mentor, Tom Haynie.
Athletes from all over the Western Hemisphere will gather at Mexico City early in March for
the second annual Pan American Sportive Games which will be held under the auspices of the
International Olympic Committee from March 12 to 26.
The United States will send a team of approximately 300 competitors plus 60 officials and
coaches, according to J. Lyman Bingham, executive director of the United States Olympic Games 1
Committee.
Among those tutoring the American athletes will be Stanford's varsity swimming and diving

coach, Tom Kaynie.
Haynie, who has been a member
of the Olympic Committee for eight
years, will supervise the tryouts to
be held on Feb. 25 and 2G, and then
coach the 18 top swimmers and div
ers in the country in preparation for
the Games.
He will be assisted by a manager,
Dr. Hal Henning of Naperville, Illi
nois, also a member of the Commit
tee.
TRYOUTS
The swimming tryouts will be
held simultaneously at Yale Uni
versity's indoor pool and at the Na
val Base at Treasure Island here in
the Bay Area. Competition for the
diving team will take place at the
Coral Casino in Santa Barbara.
In the last Pan American Games,
which were held in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, the swimming delegation
paced a top-flight American per
formance in the competitions.
As to the United States' chances
this winter, Haynie stated that in
the swimming and other sports they
were "excellent, although the alti
tude (7,200 feet at Mexico City)
might hurt us."
According to Haynie, the Ameri
can swimmers will probably be led
by several former Olympic stand
outs. Among them are Clark Scho
ler, 100-meter champion in 1952, Jim
McClain, and Wayne Moore. An
other former competitor, Bob Clot-

I worthy, will head the list of divers.
NO COLLEGE ATHLETES
The United States team will he
i made up of mostly service men and
several high school students, stated
I Haynie, because college athletes
I would have to drop out of school in
! order to compete.
i The athletic facilities on which the
: Games will be held are regarded as
among the finest in the world. The
majority of the arenas and stadiums
are located at the University of
Mexico outside the city, while oth
ers are located in the city itself.
University Stadium, the focal
point of all the facilities, stands out
in the world for its original con
ception and outstanding advantages,
which include a merger of old build
ing methods and knowledge with
up-to-date technique, and maximum
safety in the transportation and ac
commodation of 100,000 spectators.
SWIM FACILITIES

Athletes from all over the Western Hemisphere will gather at Mexico City early in March for
the second annual Pan American Sportive Games which will be held under the auspices of the
International Olympic Committee from March 12 to 26.
The United States will send a team of approximately 300 competitors plus 60 officials and
coaches, according to J. Lyman Bingham, executive director of the United States Olympic Games 1
Committee.
Among those tutoring the American athletes will be Stanford's varsity swimming and diving

coach, Tom Kaynie.
Haynie, who has been a member
of the Olympic Committee for eight
years, will supervise the tryouts to
be held on Feb. 25 and 2G, and then
coach the 18 top swimmers and div
ers in the country in preparation for
the Games.
He will be assisted by a manager,
Dr. Hal Henning of Naperville, Illi
nois, also a member of the Commit
tee.
TRYOUTS
The swimming tryouts will be
held simultaneously at Yale Uni
versity's indoor pool and at the Na
val Base at Treasure Island here in
the Bay Area. Competition for the
diving team will take place at the
Coral Casino in Santa Barbara.
In the last Pan American Games,
which were held in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, the swimming delegation
paced a top-flight American per
formance in the competitions.
As to the United States' chances
this winter, Haynie stated that in
the swimming and other sports they
were "excellent, although the alti
tude (7,200 feet at Mexico City)
might hurt us."
According to Haynie, the Ameri
can swimmers will probably be led
by several former Olympic stand
outs. Among them are Clark Scho
ler, 100-meter champion in 1952, Jim
McClain, and Wayne Moore. An
other former competitor, Bob Clot-

I worthy, will head the list of divers.
NO COLLEGE ATHLETES
The United States team will he
i made up of mostly service men and
several high school students, stated
I Haynie, because college athletes
I would have to drop out of school in
! order to compete.
