# Douglas Leads Frosh Netmen
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Of the many fine freshman ath-
I letes to enroll at the Farm this year
one Jon A. Douglas is quite possibly
the best.
This is the same Jackie Douglas
; who quarterbacked the outstanding
I frosh football machine last fall, and
| was honored as the best passer on
I the squad.
However well Douglas may play
j football, though, he is best known
j in another field of athletic endeavor.
! Douglas the tennis player is rated j
j the number three national junior
j player, and is ranked 30th nation
| ally in men's singles competition.
Douglas made a vivid impression
as a prospect for the future last
summer in the Pacific Southwest
Tourney and the Junior Davis Cup
competition. Appearing in the Jun
ior Davis Cup play, Douglas made a
creditable showing against the best
Australian junior players. In .sin
gles competition Douglas was edged
out by Roy Emerson in three sets,
5-7, 6-4. 6-3, but triumphed 7-5,
over the Aussies' Ashley Cooper.
Oddly enough Douglas tabs Cooper I
as a better player than the more
publicized Emerson.
Douglas, who is ranked only be
hind junior players Mike Green and
Jerry Moss, has been working out
on the Stanford courts since the
close of football season. He will lead 1
| the frosh team into action when ten
j nis season opens next month.
The ex-Sana Monica prep star ad
mitted to being impressed by the
quality of the Indian varsity this
year, and by the coaching methods
of tennis mentor Bob Renker.
With nearly the whole varsity i
tennis squad returning intact next
year, Douglas and fellow-frosh Bob :
Bowden and Gil White will make
| potent additions to the team. In a
year's time Renker may find him
self with the nation's best colle
giate team and—in Jack Frost and |
Douglas — the two best collegiate
players on his hands.
