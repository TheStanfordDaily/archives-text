UP AND IN—Bill Bond, Stanford's
flashy sophomore forward, jumps
to sink another two points against
Cal last weekend. Bond, whom
Coach Howie Dallmar named as
one of the Cards' best defensive
players, has been making a name
for himself offensively since the
Christmas road trip. Bond is hit
ting a cool 47 per cent of his field
goal attempts, mostly on his jump
shot.
