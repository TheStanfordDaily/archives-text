# Card Matmen Travel to San Jose Seeking First Win Tonight
## 
### 
The Stanford wrestling team will attempt to get on the winning
tiail tonight when they journey to San Jose State to do battle with
the Spartan grapplers. The Indian grunt and groaners opened their
season rather ingloriously last week when they were defeated by
California 26 to 6.
Card Coach Bob Harmon expects an extremely tough match for

his inexperienced matmen this eve
ning, as the Spartans are rated even
a more formidable foe than were
the Bears. San Jose State opened
its season last week by scoring an
impressive 29 to 5 win over San
Francisco State . Top man for the
Spartans is Dick Francis, who wres
tles at 177 pounds. Francis is de
fending Pacific Coast champion.
The Indians will go in tonight's
match at a disadvantage as they
have been forced to forfeit to San
Jose in the 147-pound class.
The Stanford lineup for tonight

will be: 123 lbs., Bob Fisher; 130 lbs.,
Bill Tolley; 137 lbs., Pete Likins; 147
lbs., forfeit to San Jose; 157 lbs.,
Ray Miller; 1(17 lbs., Bob Beatie;
177 lbs., Jerry Beatie or Bob Schaub;
heavyweight, Don Manoukiun.
Winners in their matches against
California were Likins and Manou
kian.
A combined JV and frosh team
from Stanford will do battle with
the San Jose State frosh in a pre
liminary to the varsity match.
