# 'TOO UNWIELDY'
## Excom Considers Motion To Dissolve Pub Rel Board 
### RUSS WILKS Associate Editor, The Daily 
The Executive Committee of
ASSU decided to put off for a
week final consideration of two
recommendations made by
Mary Margaret Fraser, which
would dissolve the present Pub
lic Relations Board and establish
a new organization in its place.
Miss Fraser, director of the Pub
lic Relations Board, stated in a writ
ten report submitted to Excom at its
weekly session last night that the
existing board was "too unwieldy
to accomplish efficiently the jobs for
which the committee should be re
sponsible."
Saying that there is a "tendency
for committees sometimes to think
they have more work to do than
they actually have," Miss Fraser
asked Excom to consider a new 11-
man group.
The proposed group would consist
of a director and a board of no more
than 10 members of equal standing.
The director would {supervise the
workings of the board, while a
three - man publicity committee
would regulate all campus publicity
and serve in an advisory nature for
groups seeking publicity help.
A seven-man public relations staff
would act as a liaison between the
University and outside groups such
as Palo Alto merchants, alumni
groups, and other schools, in addi

tion to assuming responsibility for
public relations problems arising in
the ASSU office.
Miss Fraser pointed out that the
now-existing Pub Rel Board favored
the new set-up. Excom requested
time to study her report and asked
that the necessary By-Law changes
for the ASSU Constitption be drawn
up and offered next week.
The Excom Constitutional Com
mittee was assigned to work on the
new set of by-laws.
Excom also went into a lengthy,
but well-organized discussion of the
draft constitution. The main ques
tion under consideration was the
size of the legislature. The flow of
sentiment favored a small group,
but no definite stand was taken.
President Pete Bing pointed out that
the student body would be given an
opportunity to voice their sentiment
through polls on the different as
pects of the constitution in the near
future.
Other action saw Excom approve
the 18-member Curriculum Evalu
ation Committee. The li§t of names
will be printed in The Daily tomor
row.
Diannc Goldman reported that the
interfraternity dance originally
scheduled for this quarter had been
postponed and would probably be
held spring quarter.

The Excom Constitutional Com
mittee was assigned to work on the
new set of by-laws.
Excom also went into a lengthy,
but well-organized discussion of the
draft constitution. The main ques
tion under consideration was the
size of the legislature. The flow of
sentiment favored a small group,
but no definite stand was taken.
President Pete Bing pointed out that
the student body would be given an
opportunity to voice their sentiment
through polls on the different as
pects of the constitution in the near
future.
Other action saw Excom approve
the 18-member Curriculum Evalu
ation Committee. The li§t of names
will be printed in The Daily tomor
row.
Diannc Goldman reported that the
interfraternity dance originally
scheduled for this quarter had been
postponed and would probably be
held spring quarter.
The Executive Committee of
ASSU decided to put off for a
week final consideration of two
recommendations made by
Mary Margaret Fraser, which
would dissolve the present Pub
lic Relations Board and establish
a new organization in its place.
Miss Fraser, director of the Pub
lic Relations Board, stated in a writ
ten report submitted to Excom at its
weekly session last night that the
existing board was "too unwieldy
to accomplish efficiently the jobs for
which the committee should be re
sponsible."
Saying that there is a "tendency
for committees sometimes to think
they have more work to do than
they actually have," Miss Fraser
asked Excom to consider a new 11-
man group.
The proposed group would consist
of a director and a board of no more
than 10 members of equal standing.
The director would {supervise the
workings of the board, while a
three - man publicity committee
would regulate all campus publicity
and serve in an advisory nature for
groups seeking publicity help.
A seven-man public relations staff
would act as a liaison between the
University and outside groups such
as Palo Alto merchants, alumni
groups, and other schools, in addi

tion to assuming responsibility for
public relations problems arising in
the ASSU office.
Miss Fraser pointed out that the
now-existing Pub Rel Board favored
the new set-up. Excom requested
time to study her report and asked
that the necessary By-Law changes
for the ASSU Constitption be drawn
up and offered next week.
