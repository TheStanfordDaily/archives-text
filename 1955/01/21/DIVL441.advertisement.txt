A GUIDE FOR THE DATELESS
With Ihe cost of dating rising higher and higher (seems the
only pleasure that costs the same these days is Philip Morris),
it is no wonder that so many of us men are turning to discus
throwing. Naturally, we would prefer nuzzling warm coeds to
flinging cold disci, but who's got; that kind of money? Prices
being what they are, the average man today has a simple choice:
dating or eating.
Unless the average man happens to be Finster Sigafoos.
Let me tell you how Finster Sigafoos, a man no smarter, no
richer, than you or I, solved his dating problem. Finster came
to college with the normal ambition of any average man: he
wanted to find the prettiest coed on campus and make her his.
ile looked long and carefully, and at last he found her —a tall
job named Kretchma inskip, with hair like beaten gold.
lie asked her for a date. She accepted. He appeared at her
sorority house that night, smiling, eager, and carrying a bou
quet of modestly priced flowers.
"Now then," said Kretchma, tossing the sleazy flora to a
pledge, "where are we going tonight?"
Finster was a man short on cash, but long on ideas. He had
prepared several attractive plans for this evening. "How would
you like to go out to the Ag campus and see the milking
machine?" he asked.
"Ick," she replied.
"Well then, how about running over to tlx* dental school te
fool with the drills?"
"Bah," she replied.
"Well, what would you like to do?" he ivked.
"Come," said she, "to a funny little place I know just outside
of town."
And away they went.
The place was Millionaires Roost, a simple country inn made
of solid ivory. It was filled with beautiful ladies in backless
gowns, handsome men in dickeys. Waiters scurried about bear
ing costly eats on flaming swords. Original Rembrandts adorned
the walls. Philip Morris trays adorned the cigarette girls.
Chained to each table was a gypsy violinist.
Finster and Kretchma were seated. "I," said Kretchma to the
waiter, "will start with shrimps remoulade. Then I will have
lobster and capon in madeira sauce with asparagus spears. For
dessert I will have loads of out-of-season fruit." *
"And you, Sir?" said the waiter to Finster.
"Just bring me a pack of Philip Morris," replied Finster,
"for if ever a man needed the soothing, steadying, beneficent
aromas of mild vintage tobaccos, it is me now."
So, smoking the best of all possible cigarettes, Finster watched
Kretchma ingest her meal and calculated that every time her
fetching young adam's apple rose and fell, he was out another
\)K. Then he took her home.
Ft was while saying goodnight that Finster got his brilliant
idea. "Listen!" he cried excitedly. "1 just hau a wonderful notion.
Next time we go out, let's go Dutch treat!"
By way of reply, Kretchma slashed him across the face with
her house mother and stormed into the house.
"Well, the heck with her," said Finster to himself. "She is
just a gold digger and 1 am well rid of her. I am sure there
are many girls just as beautiful as Kretchma who will under
stand the justice of my position. For after all, girls get as much
money from home as men, so what could be more fair than
sharing expenses on a date?"
With good heart and high hopes, Finster began a search for
a girl who would appreciate the equity of Dutch treat, and you
will be pleased to hear that he soon found one.
Today Finster goes everywhere and shares expenses fifty-fifty
with Mary Alice Hematoma, a lovely three legged girl with
sideburns.

A GUIDE FOR THE DATELESS
With Ihe cost of dating rising higher and higher (seems the
only pleasure that costs the same these days is Philip Morris),
it is no wonder that so many of us men are turning to discus
throwing. Naturally, we would prefer nuzzling warm coeds to
flinging cold disci, but who's got; that kind of money? Prices
being what they are, the average man today has a simple choice:
dating or eating.
Unless the average man happens to be Finster Sigafoos.
Let me tell you how Finster Sigafoos, a man no smarter, no
richer, than you or I, solved his dating problem. Finster came
to college with the normal ambition of any average man: he
wanted to find the prettiest coed on campus and make her his.
ile looked long and carefully, and at last he found her —a tall
job named Kretchma inskip, with hair like beaten gold.
lie asked her for a date. She accepted. He appeared at her
sorority house that night, smiling, eager, and carrying a bou
quet of modestly priced flowers.
"Now then," said Kretchma, tossing the sleazy flora to a
pledge, "where are we going tonight?"
Finster was a man short on cash, but long on ideas. He had
prepared several attractive plans for this evening. "How would
you like to go out to the Ag campus and see the milking
machine?" he asked.
"Ick," she replied.
"Well then, how about running over to tlx* dental school te
fool with the drills?"
"Bah," she replied.
"Well, what would you like to do?" he ivked.
"Come," said she, "to a funny little place I know just outside
of town."
And away they went.
The place was Millionaires Roost, a simple country inn made
of solid ivory. It was filled with beautiful ladies in backless
gowns, handsome men in dickeys. Waiters scurried about bear
ing costly eats on flaming swords. Original Rembrandts adorned
the walls. Philip Morris trays adorned the cigarette girls.
Chained to each table was a gypsy violinist.
Finster and Kretchma were seated. "I," said Kretchma to the
waiter, "will start with shrimps remoulade. Then I will have
lobster and capon in madeira sauce with asparagus spears. For
dessert I will have loads of out-of-season fruit." *
"And you, Sir?" said the waiter to Finster.
"Just bring me a pack of Philip Morris," replied Finster,
"for if ever a man needed the soothing, steadying, beneficent
aromas of mild vintage tobaccos, it is me now."
So, smoking the best of all possible cigarettes, Finster watched
Kretchma ingest her meal and calculated that every time her
fetching young adam's apple rose and fell, he was out another
\)K. Then he took her home.
Ft was while saying goodnight that Finster got his brilliant
idea. "Listen!" he cried excitedly. "1 just hau a wonderful notion.
Next time we go out, let's go Dutch treat!"
By way of reply, Kretchma slashed him across the face with
her house mother and stormed into the house.
"Well, the heck with her," said Finster to himself. "She is
just a gold digger and 1 am well rid of her. I am sure there
are many girls just as beautiful as Kretchma who will under
stand the justice of my position. For after all, girls get as much
money from home as men, so what could be more fair than
sharing expenses on a date?"
With good heart and high hopes, Finster began a search for
a girl who would appreciate the equity of Dutch treat, and you
will be pleased to hear that he soon found one.
Today Finster goes everywhere and shares expenses fifty-fifty
with Mary Alice Hematoma, a lovely three legged girl with
sideburns.

"Now then," said Kretchma, tossing the sleazy flora to a
pledge, "where are we going tonight?"
Finster was a man short on cash, but long on ideas. He had
prepared several attractive plans for this evening. "How would
you like to go out to the Ag campus and see the milking
machine?" he asked.
"Ick," she replied.
"Well then, how about running over to tlx* dental school te
fool with the drills?"
"Bah," she replied.
"Well, what would you like to do?" he ivked.
"Come," said she, "to a funny little place I know just outside
of town."
And away they went.
The place was Millionaires Roost, a simple country inn made
of solid ivory. It was filled with beautiful ladies in backless
gowns, handsome men in dickeys. Waiters scurried about bear
ing costly eats on flaming swords. Original Rembrandts adorned
the walls. Philip Morris trays adorned the cigarette girls.
Chained to each table was a gypsy violinist.
Finster and Kretchma were seated. "I," said Kretchma to the
waiter, "will start with shrimps remoulade. Then I will have
lobster and capon in madeira sauce with asparagus spears. For
dessert I will have loads of out-of-season fruit." *
"And you, Sir?" said the waiter to Finster.
"Just bring me a pack of Philip Morris," replied Finster,
"for if ever a man needed the soothing, steadying, beneficent
aromas of mild vintage tobaccos, it is me now."
So, smoking the best of all possible cigarettes, Finster watched
Kretchma ingest her meal and calculated that every time her
fetching young adam's apple rose and fell, he was out another
\)K. Then he took her home.
Ft was while saying goodnight that Finster got his brilliant
idea. "Listen!" he cried excitedly. "1 just hau a wonderful notion.
Next time we go out, let's go Dutch treat!"
By way of reply, Kretchma slashed him across the face with
her house mother and stormed into the house.
"Well, the heck with her," said Finster to himself. "She is
just a gold digger and 1 am well rid of her. I am sure there
are many girls just as beautiful as Kretchma who will under
stand the justice of my position. For after all, girls get as much
money from home as men, so what could be more fair than
sharing expenses on a date?"
With good heart and high hopes, Finster began a search for
a girl who would appreciate the equity of Dutch treat, and you
will be pleased to hear that he soon found one.
Today Finster goes everywhere and shares expenses fifty-fifty
with Mary Alice Hematoma, a lovely three legged girl with
sideburns.

A GUIDE FOR THE DATELESS
With Ihe cost of dating rising higher and higher (seems the
only pleasure that costs the same these days is Philip Morris),
it is no wonder that so many of us men are turning to discus
throwing. Naturally, we would prefer nuzzling warm coeds to
flinging cold disci, but who's got; that kind of money? Prices
being what they are, the average man today has a simple choice:
dating or eating.
Unless the average man happens to be Finster Sigafoos.
Let me tell you how Finster Sigafoos, a man no smarter, no
richer, than you or I, solved his dating problem. Finster came
to college with the normal ambition of any average man: he
wanted to find the prettiest coed on campus and make her his.
ile looked long and carefully, and at last he found her —a tall
job named Kretchma inskip, with hair like beaten gold.
