### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 (UP)—President Eisenhower predicted
today that "high and satisfactory" employment and production
will prevail in 1955 and forecast a "general, though modest" tax
cut next year.
He told Congress in his annual economic message that the

nation has made "a transition
contraction to recovery" by pulling I
out of a "mild and brief" business |
slump last year. The economic road
ahead, he said, looks smooth.
House Speaker Sam Ray burn (D.,
Tex.) agreed that '"good times are i
ahead—if the Republicans don't up- j
set the laws we (the Democrats) i
passed in the previous 18 years.
"BIG AND RICH"
"The country now is so big and
rich we'll get along all right pro
vided somebody doesn't throw the
brakes on," Rayburn said.
Republicans generally applauded
the report, which predicted a tax cut
next year if the "vigor of the receirt
recovery" continues.
In holding out the possibility of "a
glorious economic future," Mr. Ei
senhower warned that the govern
ment will keep a "close watch" on
the booming stock market. He said
the "continued economic recovery
must not be jeopardized by over
emphasis on speculative activity."
The 203-page report contained 33
specific recommendations for eco
nomic well-being, most of which
had been outlined in previous mes
sages.
Mr. Eisenhower's principal new
proposals called for a "substantial"
increase in the maximum fine for
violating the Sherman Anti-Trust
Act, and for state action to liberal
ize unemployment compensation
payments.
TEAMWORK FOR PROSPERITY
He told Congress that continued
prosperity depends on teamwork
among the government, business,
and the people. The goal is a steady
rise rather than "an immediate up
ward thrust," he said.
"The role of the federal govern
ment ... is to create an atmos
phere favorable to economic activity
by encouraging private initiative,
curbing monopolistic tendencies,
avoiding encroachment on the pri
vate sector of the economy, and car
rying out as much of its own work
as is practicable through private en
terprise," the President sajd.
Mr. Eisenhower said that with
"wise management" the nation can
achieve a $."500 billion production
level within the next 10 years, com
pared to the current annual level
of about $3f)0 billion.
