# Players Plot Pink Shaw
## 
### 
Settings, lighting, and costumes
will be tried out for the first time
at tonight's "tech" rehearsal of the
Stanford Players' production of
George Bernard Shaw's comedy,
"Misalliance." The show opens
Wednesday at 8:15 p.m. in the Little
Theater, and runs through Jan. 29
and Feb. 2-5.
The production's design, director
Wendell Cole explained, is intended
to complement the nature of the
play. "Misalliance," he said, "is a
conversation with action. The ac
tion is important, but we're not
meant to take it seriously."
(Within one hour, for instance,
the woman aviator finds herself with
marriage proposals from four hith
erto unknown men.)
Accordingly, the set, which rep
resents a genteel tum-of-the-cen
tury conservatory, is done unreal -
istically in stylized tones of pink and
turquoise. Rattan furniture, frilly
costumes, even the huge - horned
gramophone, are all a gay pink.
Other production problems ranged
from an on-stage Turkish bath to
the staging of authentic 1910 tangos
and bunny-hugs. Instead of a
painted backdrop, the set utilizes a
projected landscape scene.
Sets were designed by Wendell
Cole, who is also directing the play.
Cole has done sets for the recent
Players' productions of "The Cli
mate of Eden," "The Male Animal,"
"'lphigenia in Tauris," "'Desire Un
der the Elms," and the opera "Fal
staff."
Costumes arc by Virginia Opsvig
and lighting by Hugo Melchione.
Both Melchione and Mrs. Opsvig
worked on last quarter's "The Al
chemist."
A few tickets arc still available at
the Memorial Hall box office from
12:30 to 4:30 p.m. All seats are $1.
