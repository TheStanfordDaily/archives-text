# Excom Hears Code Report
## 
### 
Ann Irvine, co-chairman of Ex
com's Honor Code subcommit
tee, told the Executive body of
ASSU that one of the major ob
stacles facing the code con
cerned whether or not students
should be allowed to take tests
out of the room.
Reporting to Excom at its weekly
Wednesday night session, Miss Ir
j vine said that certain basic assump
tions could be dra\vn from student
polls conducted last spring: (1) stu
dents favor the Honor Code and
want to keep it; (2) students con
sider it a privilege to take tests out
of the room; (3) students want a
unified policy on the above. They
either want all or none of the
teachers to let them take tests out
of the room.
Although tabulations ot faculty
polls have not been completed, Miss
Irvine said a trend of opinion could
be seen. She pointed out that there
was "faculty unrest" about the Hon
or Code.
COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY
She said that the faculty didn't
believe the Honor Code was work
ing the way it should. Under the
present structure there is collective
responsibility of the students to see
that the code is obeyed and upheld.
Miss Irvine stated that an attempt
would be made to effect a unified
policy through the working together
and full co-operation of President
Wallace Sterling, the faculty, and
the students.
Excom will eventually make the
I final student decision on the code,
I which must then be approved by the
Academic Council.
