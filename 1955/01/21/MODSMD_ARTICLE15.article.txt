Harry James, now one of Amer
ica's most prominent entertainers,
was born into the entertainment
world, but not into the world of
blaring horns and wailing blues, as
might be expected. Instead, he was
born into the world of sawdust and
the big tent.
As a boy. he divided his time be
tween playing a trumpet for tha
circus band and doing a contortion
ist act with a 65-year-old partner.
By the age of 10, he was doing trum
pet solos.
At 15, he began to play with local

He was spotted again, this time
from a recording, and this time by
the famous Benny Goodman. He

new tune, and on the reverse side
of the record gave a new interpre

Me Love You." It was this tune that
swept the country like wildfire and
started him off on his career as one
of the country's favorite band lead
