# 13-WEEK SERIES
## Farm Back on TV Tonight 
### DON JACKSON 
Stanford is back on television
today, with an award-winning
record to protect and a patriotic
theme to present.
"Our Rugged Constitution," to be
shown on educational station KQED
at 7:30 tonight, is the first program
produced by Stanford's radio -TV
department since their series on
"People, Places, and Politics" two
years ago netted the department a
TV award.
The program, according to Dr.
Stanley Donner, who will serve as
moderator, will picture the Con
stitution as a "living, vital docu
ment." Current events will be tied
in with constitutional principles in
an effort to vividly portray the rug
gedness and versatility of the famed
document.
Dr. Stuart Hyde will produce the
show, which is the first local offer
ing to be kinescoped for national
distribution in the future. Though
it will be seen live in the Bay Area,
educational stations throughout the
country will show the local product
at later dates.
Tonight's program, which is the
first of a 13-week series, will feature
Dr. Donner and three other Stan
ford professors in an elaboration of
one of the most fundamental con
stitutional principles.
Views on the issue revolving
around present fear of Communist
accusations and "leftist" suspicions
will be presented by Dr. Harold
Fisher, chairman of the Hoover In
stitute; Dr. John Goheen, head of
the Philosophy Department; and
Professor Stanley Morrison, who
heads the Constitutional Law divi
sion of the Law School.
Regularly throughout the series
Stanford professors will be invited
to give their opinions on the issue
under discussion. There will be
three each week, representing the
fields of history, law, English, phi
losophy, and political science.
Dramatic px-esentation will play a
big part in the impact of the show,
according to Dr. Donner. Scattered
spotlighs and a semi-dark stage will
add to the effect. Dr. Donner, who
gets credit for the idea along with
Dr. Hyde, feels that the Constitution
is too frequently misunderstood and
misinterpreted today, and that this
presentation should help in clearing
up any haze surrounding its mean
ing.
Janet Mason, a graduate radio-
TV major, is serving as a&sistant
producer for the first show. Each
week students will assist in the pro
duction and script-writing end of
the program, while a different, stu
dent will handle the assistant pro
ducer's job every week.
