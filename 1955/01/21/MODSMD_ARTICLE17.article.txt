### 
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 20 — Teh
Senate today approved a $1,000,000
appropriation to help California
stage the Winter Olympics Games in
1960—provided California is clioscn
i as the site.
With the games live years away,
j efforts have begun to bring the 1960
Winter Gaines to Lake Tahoe's fa
mous Squaw Valley ski resort, well
known as a winter playground.
If the Olympic ski and skating
| events came to California, and if
j they showed a profit, the money
would be returned to the state.
The bill, which must go through
\ the lower house, would create a
! "California Olympics Commission"
I and loan it the money from the
1 state's beach and parks fund.
