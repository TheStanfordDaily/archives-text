# Thank You, Mr. Bufano
## 
### 
Trucks will start rolling this morning be
tween Stanford and the tiny San Francisco
studio of sculptor Beniamino Bufano, in the first
step toward moving to the campus the million
and a half dollars worth of art masterpieces
which Bufano recently donated to the Uni
versity.
Included in the noted sculptor's gift to Stan
ford are more than 100 impressive sculptures
and beautiful mosaicsâ€”almost the entire output
of Bufano's talented hands for the past 25 years.
Bufano says his magnificent gift to Stanford
was prompted by his philosophy that "an artist

should give his works back to mankind" in
order to keep them out of the hands of private
collectors who might hide them from the eyes
of an art-loving public.
The 13 sculptures and 11 mosaics which will
be placed in the museum and art gallery here
this weekend will make a magnificent and
much-appreciated addition to the 12-piece
Bufano collection already owned by the Uni
versity.
We are sure we echo the sentiments of the
whole Stanford family in expressing a sincere
"Thank-you, Mr. Bufano."
