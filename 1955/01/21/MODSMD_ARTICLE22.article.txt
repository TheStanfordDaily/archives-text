### DICK MEISTER 
It's winter quarter, basketballs are bouncing and
autumn's touchdowns are a thing of the past. But
iiany are reluctant to see King Football leave. They
yearn for the excitement of the gridiron.
If you're still looking for the thrill of an off-tackle
Sunt, an end run, and the like (sorry, no poon-poon
girl ), cast your peepers toward The Row.
Hi re on this boulevard of BMOC's you'll find the
"i< ,it< â€¢ t group of football men outside of UCLA. Why,
they're so good, so good .... Well, did you ever see
thai, man v/ith the movie camera on Lower Row?
S' nut from the Ivy League, Princeton's short on tail -
hack we hear. And these "athletes" spend more time
oi: their tail; and backs than anyone we know. Damn
muddy, those house lawns at this time of the year.
Seriously, though, they're really athletes. Every
time we hu tie by on the way to class or to the library,
there they are, devoted, what we mean. They give
their all for the game, classes must come after touch
down.-;. What spirit, what sacrifice, and all for those

who just can't stand to see football leave the cpmpus.
And these guys are versatile; what volleyball
players. And the competition! Rugged. They prac
tice with teams from the women's row houses. So
the guys lose, does that get them down? No, never
say die. Real competitors.
You may think that when night and its darkness
comes these devotees of sport could rest ori their
athletic laurels and seek the pleasure of their books.
Ah, but no. Night ping pong, under the lights.
Clunk, clunk, clunk. Why buy No-Doze? The ping
pongists will keep you safely alert.
We suspect the only reason the boys aren't out for
the Indian varsity is that those mean old coaches
would make them take a rest once in a while, but
that wouldn't do, these men are 24-hour a day
athletes. The real thing.
Besides, that would mean grade point average re
quirements and hitting the hooks.
Can't, play night ping pong and do that.
