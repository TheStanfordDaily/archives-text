# Farm Accepts Bufano Works
## 
### 
The first installment of the collec
tion of statues and other works of
art donated to Stanford by San
Francisco sculptor Beniamino Bu
iano will be moved to campus today.
The works will be placed in the
Stanford Museum and Art Gallery,
Included in the first group of
treasures to be transported to the
campus are five pieces of a "Cruci
fixion Scene," two heads of St.
Francis, a small copy of Bufano's
famous "Peace" statue, and eleven
14-by-24-inch mosaics.
The art works will be placed with
12 Bufano works already owned by
the University.
Frank James, chairman of the
Committee for Art at Stanford, said
yesterday that the acceptance of
other pieces of the sculptor's work
will depend upon future University
building developments.
