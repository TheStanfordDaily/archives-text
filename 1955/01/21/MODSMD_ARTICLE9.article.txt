Ski fans will get a treat this week

reports from California ski areas.
Most of the mountain areas are log
ging in for the weekend with clear,
cold weather, and several inches of
new, dry powder snow from last
week's storms.
On Highway 40 at Tahoe, Squaw
Peak reports a good 108-inch pack
underneath 24 inches of new pow
der. Further west at the summit
the hill has 40 inches with 12 of new
powder, while Sugar Bowl has 84
inches at the bottom of the ehairlift.
In the Reno Ski Bowl area, where
the Stanford ski team will train this
weekend, is a reported 72 inches
packed under 12 to 18 inches of dry
powder.
A total of 90 inches on top is re
ported in the Dodge Ridge-Pine
crest area, thanks to a heavy fall
during the week.
Farm students who head for the
hills will find the ski slopes crowded
this weekend with the University of
California and many high schools
and smaller schools having their be
twecn-scmester breaks.
The only ski competition sched
uled for the weekend is the annual
Birthday Giant Slalom, an FWSA-
Open race held at Squaw Valley.
