## 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 23 (UP) — The
Russian government today issued a
surprise call to the Supreme Soviet
(parliament) to meet Feb. 3—two
months ahead of schedule, appar
ently to hear an important Soviet
decision on Germany.
The action followed on the heels
of the recall of Russian ambassadors
from the Big Three Western pow
ers, which was an apparent tip-off
that the Soviets had something big
in the offing.
Moscow radio on its home service
announced that the Russian parlia
mentary body would sit in the So
viet capital Feb. 3. Usually the So
viet meets once a year, in April or
May.
The early session of the Soviet,
which rubber-stamps decisions of
government leaders, coupled with
the recall of the ambassadors to
! Washington, London, Paris, and East
Berlin, set the stage for another
Russian move in Germany and its
rearmament, observers said.
Experts on the Soviet Union said
that the council meeting probably
will disclose the Soviet position on
German rearmament and might cast
I some light on the repeatedly report
j ed struggle for power between Prc-
I micr Georgi Malenkov and First
! Secretary of the Communist Party
I Nikita Krushchev.
The government decree calling the
! Soviet session said:
"The U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet
Pracsidium decrees:
"To convene the second session of
the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet of the
Fourth Convocation on Feb. 3. 1955,
in Moscow."
