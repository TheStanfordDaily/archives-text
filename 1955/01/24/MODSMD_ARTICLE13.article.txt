# Seven Clubs Select 103 New Pledges
## 
### BOB DURAND 
Members of Stanford's seven
eating clubs are slowing their
pace this week as their rushing
activities tapered off after two
weeks of highly concentrated
rushing programs.
Although their rushing never
comes to a complete halt, the clubs
announced that a total of 103 had
pledged the seven clubs as of yes
terday.
El Tigre stood atop the list with
23 new members, followed closely
by Breakers with 20. Los Arcos
pledged the least number with a
total of 10. The average for all clubs
stood at 14.7, the same as last year.
"HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL"
Interclub Council President Marty
Armbrust said he "felt that rushing
was highly successful for the clubs,"
and that he was "quite satisfied."
He went on to comment that, for
the first time, all the clubs had been
able to be highly selective in choos
ing their new members, and that
as a result, each organization en
countered better than average luck
during the past two weeks.
OVER 500 RUS I IKES
The group of over 500 rushees
who flooded the eating club open
houses on the first night of rushing
was, according to Armbrust, the best
record ever. The ICC president also
observed that the second two open
houses, which were held concur
rently with fraternity open houses
and varsity basketball games, were
successful too, considering the con
ditions under which they were held.
As most of the clubs have not yet.
filled their quota of new members,
rushing will continue for them, al
though at a much reduced rate.
