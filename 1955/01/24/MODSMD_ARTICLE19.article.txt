WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 (UP) —
Chairman James P. Richards (D.,
S.C.) of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee today denounced as "a
bunch of bunk" Red China's offer to
let the families of 17 Americans im
prisoned there visit their kin.
Richards noted on the CBS tele
vision program, "Face the Nation,"
that the State Department could
flatly refuse to let the relatives go to
Red China. But he said it might lay
the Department open to a great deal
of criticism..
The State Department hopes the
relatives will decide on their own
not to go .It fears they would be
falling into a propaganda trap, a
view shared by many members of
Congress.
Several Senators warned that
Americans who accept the offer
would never be able to criticize the
Comunists for fear the jailed men
might be tortured in return.
But John J. Sparkman (D., Ala.)
said the Reds also could capitalize
with propaganda if the government
refuses to let the families go. He
said this could lead to "charges that
we are inhumane and want only a
pretext for war."
