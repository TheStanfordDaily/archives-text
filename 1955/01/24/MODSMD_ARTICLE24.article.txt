## Congress Will Act On Formosa Demarcation Eisenhower Requests Plan For Sharp 'Don't-Cross' Line 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 (UP) â€” Congressional leaders today
promised fast and decisive action on President Eisenhower's re
quest for approval of his plan to draw a sharp "don't-cross" line
against Chinese Communist aggression in the Formosa area.
Chairman James P. Richards (D., S.C.) of the House Foreign Af-

fairs Committee predicted that the
President will get overwhelming bi
partisan support in the House if he
lays down a firm policy against fur
ther Red aggression.
The President's urgent and extra
ordinary message, which could lead
to a quick showdown with the Red:.
will be sent to the House and Sen
ate when they convene at noon to
morrow.
FIRM POLICY
Noting that the President Iw the
"great responsibility" of making
what could be a war-or-peage deci
sion, Richards declared that a ' linn
policy" against the Chinese Reds
"will keep us out of war much bet
ter than a weak, vacillating policy."
A highly placed administration
source said that what Mr. Eisen
hower wants from Congress would
amount to a conditional defensive
declaration of war. That would place
squarely on the Reds, he said, com
plete responsibility for war or pcace
in the Formosau straits.
Congress, aroused by recent Com
munist thrusts at Chinese National
ist territory and the imprisonment
of American airmen, appeared to be
ready to give the President exactly
what he wants.
EXACT LINE NOT STATED
Mr. Eisenhower may not publicly
state the exact defense line he has
drawn up for the Formosa area ex
cept, of course, for Formosa itself
and the nearby Pescadores Islands.
Although details of the President's
message were not made public in
advance, it is known that he want.-:
1. Authority to establish a definite
defense line around Formosa, be
yond which U.S. air and naval
forces would shoot, if necessary, to
block Chinese Red aggression.
2. Congressional approval to use
this country's planes and ships to
cover withdrawal of Chinese Na
tionalist forces from the embattled
Tachen Islands and even evacuate
Nationalist troops.
