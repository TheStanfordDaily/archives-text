# Question of the Week

### 
Soviet foreign policy has become the ques
tion of the day as top Russian diplomats con
gregate in Moscow.
The last time the Kremlin called a high-level
conference was immediately following Stalin's
death. The result of this conference was a "re
laxation ci world tension" policy.
Whether or not this conference produces in
structions to tighten or loosen the strain on the
nerves of the world, the ultimate purpose is
reasonably clearâ€”the development of foreign
policy to go into effect if and when the Paris
agreements on rearming Germany and inte
grating it into the Western defense system are
ratified by Western governments.
Molotov and his aides have apparently failed
in their all-out efforts to thwart ratification of
the pacts. Western European policies have
been only slightly influenced by the latest
Soviet declaration on the German issue. And
so, logically, the brains of the Soviet Union
will decide, or be told, their next series of plays
in the East-West game of nations.
The nation certain to be the number one con
cern of Soviet policy won't change. Russia

has never lost her almost pathological fear of
"German militarism" which she developed in
World Wars I and 11. Considering history and
geography, we think it is still a sincere fear.
What will Malik, Vindogradov, and Pushkin,
ranking members of the Soviet Foreign Min
istry's policy making board, decide? Or will
they be informed of decisions already made in
a conference set up under a facade of 'demo
cratic' communism?
We may never know what the to-be-an
nounced policy really is. We will certainly be
informed of what we are supposed to think it
is. And the ways and means that the Soviet
diplomats are to utilize may be unpleasant sur
prises.
Perhaps we are being unduly pessimistic.
But the Soviet Union has reached the point in
its fight against Western Democracy where it
must either retreat and find a new front, or
launch a desperate attempt to kill the ratifica
tions of the Paris pacts.
The question of Soviet foreign policy will
be uppermost in minds of the West
this week. Will it be answered? Or will we
find out the hard way?
