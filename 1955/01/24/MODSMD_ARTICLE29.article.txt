# BULL SESSION

### RIC TEAGUE 
The other'day, the imminence of that part of the
quarter reserved for mid-terms.was brought abruptly
to rny attention. (This is oidy the first of two informa
tive items with which I present you today.)
To continue: On Friday last I settled myself into the
second row of my 9 o'clock and opened my New York
er to a Charles Addams cartoon. And chuckled. "Mr.
Teague," Mr. Teagued a voice from the lectern, ' is
that a blue-book?" "No, sir, it is a periodical."
Well, sir, I doubt that I had prepared a.s well as
some of the others in my class but they were no more
relaxed. And relaxation is an important thing in suc
cessfully attacking the problem ot the mid-term. So,
scholars, my advice to you is relax.
How? Don't cram the night before a mid-term. It
will serve only to confuse you. Cram two nights be
fore your mid-term and review the next day. The
/light, before, you can forget about a last-minute drive
and you can hie yourself down to the Oitsis for a root
beei and a hamburger and get relaxed.
This will pay off on the next day when you glide
into class. Refreshed, pink of cheek, no circles under
t he eyes, and alert and ready to raise the curve.
Enough of this, however. The better part of this

channel will pertain today to man's best friend.
Marilyn Monroe. I note in the daily journals that
Miss Monroe wants lo get arty. Wants to play a high
dramatic part, she says. Well, now, this offers some
problems. Monroe couldn't get the public to take her
.seriously. Sort <>t like Gypsy Rose Lee wanting to
play Lady Macbeth.
Miss Monroe has formed her own company. Marilyn
Monroe Productions, or something like that. Her asso
ciates are, according to the reports that have come
to the attention of this correspondent, a magazine
photographer and an attorney.
The difficulties presented by this arrangement are
immediately apparent. Who knows how to make a
movie? Certainly not Monroe. The others? I doubt
it. Monroe will need expert advice. And I am ready,
willing and able, a.s the song says.
I have been investing a regular twenty cents in the
Sunday night (licks and consider myself well-versed
in what it takes to turn out an epic film. First, you
need a good plot; second, a good battery of screen
writers; third, good technical assistance; and fourth,
a good cast. This leaves only one problem unsolved.
What to do with Miss Monroe.
