# SUMMER PROGRAM:
## NSA Tours Scheduled 
### JOANNE OLSON 
One of the National Students As
sociation programs which directly
affects many American university
students each year is its summer
tour program. According to Jim
Sammet, NSA regional travel direc
tor, the NSA tours have several ad
vantages over other travel plans.
The group's itinerary is planned
by the national student unions of
the countries to be visited, and in
each country students serve as
guides. This makes possible maxi
mum contact with the students of
other countries, Sammet empha
sized.
He also said that an orientation
program and language classes are
conducted on the ship by professors
from both the United States and
Europe.
Among the most popular trips on
the NSA's program are the Tri-Na
tion tours. These visit France, Italy,
and either Spain, Switzerland, Bel
gium-Holland, or England. A new
Lour of Yugoslavia, Greece, and Tur
key is being added this year.
There are about 30 students in
each group, Sammet said, and at the
end of the 75-day tour students will
have 10 free days before returning
to New York.
Mary Carmine, Union Residence,
has been named NSA campus travel
director, and information about the
tours may be obtained from her or
Sammet, who lives at Toyon.
