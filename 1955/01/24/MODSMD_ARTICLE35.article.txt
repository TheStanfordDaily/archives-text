# Quad Bargain Price Deadline Announced
## 
### JULIE ANNE HARRIS 
Quad officials announce that students must pay for their 1955
Quads by Jan. 31 to take advantage of the new mail order system.
By so doing, the student pays a reduced price ($6.50 instead of
$7.50 after Jan. 31) and has the opportunity to have his name en
graved for an additional 25c. This service will be discontinued

alter that date.
The new system was instituted for
two reasons. In the past, the staff of
.the Quad has neve? known until the
end of the year just how many
Quads were going to be sold. Losses
have been sustained by spending too
much on Quads and by having too
many printed.
By the new system, every student
is contacted at registration and i
asked whether or not he wants a i
book. Later, at the end of fall quar- |
ter, he is billed. A stamped, self- |
addressed envelope is enclosed so he
need do little more than write the
check.
In this way, all students are con
tacted, whereas in the past on
campus sales were largely a hit-or
miss proposition. This year 4.000
students replied in the fall that they
wanted to buy the yearbook.
Sales are normally 3,300, though
last year they dropped. II they could
be increased to 4,000, it is very
probable that the book could be re

d iiced to $5.
The Stanford Quad is a $40,000
project. Of thus sum, $22,000 must
come from subscriptions. The rest
is spread over three sources of in
come, to minimize the cost to the
student: advertising, organizations,
and student pictures.
