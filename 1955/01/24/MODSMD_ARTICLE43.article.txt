(Editor's note: This is the first
of a series of articles, based on an
interview with Athletic Director
Al Masters, about the conflicting
proposals for telecasting college
football.)

Regional television ol college
football under the Pacific Coast
Conference plan would not kill
the sport for the small schools,
Al Masters, University athletic
director, said yesterday.
Poth the PCC and the Western
Conference (Big Ten) have an
nounced their support for regional
television nationally controlled —
Masters emphasized "nationally con
trolled"—and said that they would
exercise their right not to partici
pate if the "game of the week" sys
tem is retained by the National Col
legiate Athletic Association.
Opponents of the regional plan
claim that it would destroy small
college football by allowing tele
casts Friday and Saturday night as
well as Saturday afternoon. J. Sho
ber Barr, athletic director of Frank
lin and Marshall College and mem
ber of the NCAA's TV committee,
said last week that the PCC and Big
Ten have "no concern for the hun
dreds of independent and small col
leges and universities throughout
the country and particularly those
in their own area."
FALSE CONCEPTION
Masters, who is the new chairman
of the PCC radio and television

i committee, says that conccption is
1 false. "We don't propose indiscrimi
nate telecasting Friday and Satur
j day nights. This is not arbitrary TV j
[ to hurt the little schools."
Masters explained that one of the j
major features of the regional plan
is co-operation with every regional
school which would be concerned
with any given telecast. Each game
would be blacked out in the local
area (except for sellouts) and in
[ any area which would hurt other |
I schools.
15 TO 2X GAMES
Masters foresee- that from 15 to
: 28 games would be seen on the
i Coast next fall because of Friday
j and Saturday night telecasting. "To
! do this we know we'll have 1o re
| schedule some of our games," he
j said, "and we expect that the small
| schools will co-operate by resched
! uling some of theirs."
Masters discussed the advantages
I of the PCC plan:
1. "It permits telecasting, wilh
j necessary blackouts, Friday and
: Saturday night games, meaning
[ more games on TV for the fans."
(The "game of the week" system al
i lows the telecasting of only one
1 game each Saturday.)
2. "It takes care of local sellouts.
The Big Game is one we like to TV
locally, but last year it was im
possible." (Masters added that the
PCC liker the feature of the East
ern Collegiate Athletic Conference
J proposal, the game of the week"
| system receiving major support,
1 which allows each team a closed

circuit home telecast in addition to
one appearance nationally on the
"game of the week.")
3. "It gives the Coast fans Coast
games. We don't think that many
of the games TV'd last year inter
ested Coast viewers."
4. "It doesn't restrict national tel
ecasting after the 13th week of the
season." (The Army-Navy and SC-
Notre Dame games would
not be restricted regionally.)
PCC RESOLUTION
The PCC in its resolution adopted
j last week said that regional TV "is
best suited to the attainment of a

proper balance between the legiti
mate interests of member institu
tions, the different geographical re
gions of the country, and the tele-
I vision public."
The regional TV system would bo
run individually by each of the
eight NCAA regions under national
NCAA supervision. Each region
would televise only games of schools
in its region. The games would be
1 seen in the local area of the visiting
, team ii there were no conflict, in
the area of the site of the game if
it were a sellout, and anywhere else
in the region in which a telecast
would not conflict with a game.
