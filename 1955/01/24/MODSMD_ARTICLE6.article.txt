teers, French soldiers, police, and
firemen today battled to control the
rising flood waters of the Seine,
which has flooded a 60-mile stretch
up and down stream from the
French capital.
The Americans joined the French
men in fighting the rising river as
Paris' emergency flood control plan
went into operation.
The river threatened to reach its
highest level in 45 years. It already
had reached a flood stage that Pre
mier Pierre Mcndes-France called a
"calamity unchained by the ele
ments which men arc unable to
master."
Large areas of central Paris al
ready were under water. The Hoods
drove hunger-maddened rats from
Paris' famous sewers into the base
ments of riverside homes.
An estimated 20,000 persons were
driven from their homes by ram
paging waters of the Seine and an
other 50,000 were forced to stop
