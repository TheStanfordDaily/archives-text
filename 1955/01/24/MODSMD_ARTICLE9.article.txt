# WEEKEND WINS
## Tribe Dunks Hawaii Five In Two Tilts 
### BILL NICHOLS 
The Stanford varsity basket
ball team made a clean sweep
of its Hawaii trip as the Tribe
won twice over the University
of Hawaii, 71-51 and 58-51.
On Friday night Stanford easily
handled the Rainbows. The Indians
led 45-23 at the half, moved to 65-
36 midway through the second half,
and then Coach Howie Dallmar
turned the game over to the re
serves.
Russ Lawler led the Indian scor
ing with 18 digits, and the Cards
were their usual consistent selves as
they made nine out of 11 free
throws and sank 31 shots from the
floor, hitting almost 47 per cent of
their attempts.
STUBBORN EIGHT
The next night the Hawaiians put
up a much more stubborn fight be
fore succumbing by the 58-51 mar
gin. The Rainbows switched to a
slow, deliberate style, emphasizing
ball control.
Stanford prevailed thanks to the
deadeye set shots of little George
Selleck, who was high point man
for the night with 16. Bill Bond and
Lawler followed with 12 and 11, re
spectively.
Stanford held a narrow four-point
lead, 26-22, at half-time, but was
able to maintain it successfully
against the persistent attack of Ha
waii. Harvey Lee led the Islanders
in both games, scoring 14 the first
night and 10 the second .
FARM RECORD OF 12-3
The wins gave Stanford a season
record of 12-3 going into next
week's games with USF, ranked
third in the nation, and Santa Clara.
The squad was scheduled to re
turn home at 7 this morning, but a
heavy storm, with winds up to 75
miles an hour, was buffeting the
Islands and threatening to delay the
team's departure.
