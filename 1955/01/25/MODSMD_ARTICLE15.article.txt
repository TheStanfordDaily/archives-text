Tokyo, Tuesday, Jan 25 (UP) —
Premier Chou En-lai declared today
in h bristling challenge to President
Eisenhower that Red China is de
termined to "liberate" Formosa re
gardless of U.S. support.
The Communist regime he heads
"absolutely cannot agree to a i~.o
called cease-fire" with Nationalist
China, Chou said.
His message was timed carefully
to collide head-on with Mr. Eisen
hower's pledge to fight for Formosa
if neces: ary. It eracklcd aiound the
world even while the President's
message was being broadcast for the
first time. . »
Accusing the United States of us
ing war threats and brandishing
atomic weapons in an attempt to
intimidate Red China, Chou con
cluded:
"To safeguard China's sovereignty
and territorial integrity, to safe
guard the security of China and
peace in the Far East, the Chinese
people must liberate Formosa, and
the United States must stop inter
vening in China's internal affairs
and withdraw all its anned forces
from Formosa and the Formosa
strait."
The Peiping radio, official voice of
Red China, broadcast. Chou's state
ment after radiocasts had carried a
part of Mr. Eisenhower's message.
At the outset Chou reminded that
his regime repeatedly had pro
claimed its determination to "liber
ate" Formosa.
