Stressing that improvement of
the University's intellectual moti
vation is a "crucial" goal of the
current Study on Undergraduate 1
Education here, H. Donald Win- J
bigler, dean of students, opened
the first of this weeks "Stanford
Today and Tomorrow" discus
sions last night.
Winbigler's talk, given at Lios
Arcos. explained just how the Study
is going about evaluating ideas
which administration, faculty, stu
dents, and alumni have concerning
this improvement.
The relative stress on scholarly
discussion and research as opposed
to regular classroom teaching was
one of the subjects covered by a
questionnaire sent out by the Under
graduate Study group, Winbigler
pointed out. According to the speak
er, some feel that there is an over
stress on the professor's research
role with a corresponding under
emphasis on his teaching role.
This questionnaire, sent out to
faculty members, asked them what
they thought the proper balance be
tween research and teaching should
be.
"In general, the average answer
received stated a preference for an
even balance between the two," said
Winbigler.
Other questions concerning the
balance were, "What do you (the
faculty members) perceive as the
balance now in the University; in
your specific department;" and
"Under which would you prefer to
work?"
The faculty members answering
believed, in general, that the pre
sent balance in the University was
in favor of research and scholarly
discussion, Winbigler commented.
"These answers and comments
will be used as a basis for further
study and analysis."
