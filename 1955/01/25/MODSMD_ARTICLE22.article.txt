# The 						American Dilemma
## 
### 
For the third time since June 1950 Americans
have been rudely shocked into an awareness
of the smoldering mass of dynamite that is
Asia.
First came the Communist onslaught into
South Korea, which added names like Pusan
and Heartbreak Ridge and the Yalu River to
the glossary of familiar geographical terms.
Indochina and Dienbienphu followed, and
now attention is turned to the Tachen Islands
north of Formosa and the Pescadores Islands
between Formosa and the Chinese mainland.
The seriousness of the present situation is
evident. In a message before Congress yester
duy President Eisenhower asked for specific
authority to use American forces to defend For
mosa and "closely related localities" from in
vasion by the Chinese Reds.
In the lace of his reguest, China's Premier
and Foreign Minister Chou En-lai warned the
l/nited States against "intervention in Com
munist China's 'liberation' of Formosa."
Immediate solutions to this tense situation
corne to mind guickly—perhaps too quickly.
The plan supported by many top officials is
to draw a definite line of demarcation between
Communist and non-Communist territory. If
the Chinese should decide to step over this
"don't cross" line, the U.S. 7th Fleet would be
rejdy to reply.

This is the obvious short-range solution. Bui
the long-range problems which could develop
are even more potentially dangerous than the
present threat of aggression.
Should the United States move ahead with
out the United Nations into a full-scale war
with Red China, she might v/ell find herself
fighting alone. The British, anxious not to an
tagonize India and sacrifice her support in the
world-wide battle against communism, would
hesitate to join a force which would be charac
terized as "white imperialist invaders" through
out Asia.
Furthermore, the prestige the United States
would gain outside Asia for fighting commun
ism would be considerably dampened by the
fact she went ahead on her own without con
sulting her western neighbors. Old fears of
America as the match which will light the world
powder keg might reappear, which in turn
would weaken the European defense system.
We aren't attempting to suggest policy or
answer all the "what if'sf involved in the
United States' role in Asia. But these are some
of the more obvious decisions which Wash
ington must make—now.
Whatever our policy, it will be a calculated
risk. It is important that the American people
understand this risk, and what might happen if
the gamble should fail.
