### DICK MEISTER 
With that great free-for-nothin' show, "Motorama,"
about to hit this area we're once again astounded by
the fabulous promotion deaJs Genera! Motors goes
through to put on this entertainment bit, and merely
:;o all of us will run down and buy our new Cadillacs.
They don't miss a bet; all their latest cars, lull
piece orchestras, dancers, and MODELS, MODELS.
MODELS and other incidental gimmicks.
Sure, to the average observer they cover every pos
ible promotion angle. But The Daily, which brought
you that exclusive expose of the cigarette tax scandal
in Sacramento, knows of one important (and luscious)
angle GM did miss.
We're speaking of THE doll, Lee Meriwetherâ€”Miss
America of 1955. How'd the motor moguls miss Meri
wether? Must have been watching too close to see
(hat no one carried off any Corvettes, they ure small
aren't they?
Now we'll continue with another exclusive Daily
item. (Our journalism prof says a reporter is part rle
t' ctive, we're trying professor, we're trying).
Well, it seems that CM was putting on its annual
"Motorama" last year in San Francisco and out from
the show comes this guy to City College of San Fran
cisco (where, at the time, the soon-to-be Miss A was
radiating and your reporter-detective was scrib
bling) looking for guys and dolls to do miscellaneous
work at "Motorama" for real money. We, being the

way we are 'bout work, even for real money, ran air
hid beside Lee (who was radiating more than on;
and hid us well who can notice anyone else whe
she's around.)
Anyhow, this guy hires Lee to work in an exhi
bition of radiator cap making, and there she worke<
In a white smock with "CM Motorama" emblazoned
across the back, like Marciatio in his robe. Look
okay on him, but he's riot as pretty as Mi s Americ;
This is the exclusive news of (he year, remember, yoi
"read it in The Daily."
For almost two weeks the lovely one (no, not. Rocky
pounded out radiator caps and for almo.il, two week
the great promoters didn't notice. We're not big op
erators, but we noticed. However, we'll give GM th
benefit ol the doubt, we cheated, we knew her befor
she donned the colors of good old General Motors.
Oh, yes, they did use Mi Meriwether lor TV pro
motion ... on a show featurin ' the radiator cap ma
chine. The audience got to see her pretty back, will
"GM Motorama" emblazoned across the back.
Maybe the promoters figured the Buiek "Wildcat
was prettier than Miss America??? What would i
cost GM to use her iri this year 's "Motorama?" < )oodle:
And they could have used her for the price ol ,
radiator cap pounder-outer, just last year.
So get ahold of a Cadilac radiator cap ... a Bnicl
radiator cap . . . even a Chevy radiator cap.
Miss America made it, man, Mi America made ii
