# Stanford Professors Featured In TV Series on Constitution
## 
### JAE HUNLEY 
Last Friday night, the first pro
gram of a thirteen-week tele
vision series featuring Stanford
professors was broadcast from
i San Francisco.
Entitled "Our Rugged Constitu
tion," lh" show is a series of discus
ions about the United States Con
stitution by some of the leading pro
j lessors in the Law School and the
: Departments of History, Philosophy
j and Political Science.
The idea for this project is not a
11;â€¢ w one. Two years ago, Stanford
professors participated in a program
dealing with foreign affairs and
railed "People, Places, and Politics."
j It received an award from the North
ern California Academy of Tele
j vision and has been filmed and
j shown throughout the United States
| and Europe.
The producer of the new series is
Dr. Stuart W. Hyde of the Depart
: uient of Speech and Drama. In an
interview, he explained that this
I .' how is a co-operative effort by

students and faculty.
"Although the students do not ap
pear before the cameras," he said,
"they are responsible for most of
the preparatory work on the show
and the stage work while the pro
gram is being televised."
Each show has a student as assist
ant producer and a staff of workers
who make arrangements for ma
terial to be photographed, hunt
through books for passages pertinent
to the planned discussion, and do
general crew work.
Dr. Hyde described some of the
problems faced by these students in
the preparation of the show.
An example he gave as typical
concerned the difficulty involved in
obtaining a copy of the Constitu
tion which could be seen effectively
on a television set.
"You see," he pointed out, "wet
impressions were taken of the orig
inal copy of the Constitution and
the ink faded considerably. There
lore, the writing on most of the
present copies is barely legible and
to prepare a copy that would be
suitable lor our use, the students

carefully retraced the handwriting
(including ink blots) in black ink. I
They did a beautiful job."
Along with that problem, the !
people participating are hampered j
by the luck of a place in which to
rehearse, since there are no tele- j
vision facilities here.
"We have resorted," Dr. Hyde
smiled, "to setting up a semi-tele- |
vision studio in the Green Room of
Memorial Auditorium for practice
here. Then, the day of the program,
we go to San Francisco and spend
three hours or more in concentrated
rehearsal at the studio."
Although the show is similar in
type to the round-table, panel dis
cussions of radio and television, this
series- will use a different approach
according to Dr. Hyde. Varied set
lings and illustrations will be used
in order to avoid the "semi-class
room, conference room appearance."
Friday night's program concerned
the Preamble to the Constitution
and iurther shows will discuss spe
cific details. The show is broadcast
over Station KQED. channel nine, ;
each Friday night at 7:30 p.m.
