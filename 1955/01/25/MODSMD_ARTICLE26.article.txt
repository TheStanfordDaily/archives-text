# COOPER, LANCASTER STAR
## Dry Humor, Dialogue Offset Plodding Plot of 'Vera Cruz' 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Geographically speaking, Vera Cruz is a Mexican port south
east of Mexico City. "Vera Cruz," the movie, however, is nowhere.
This is not to say that the Superscope spectacle—although it
looked no different from CinemaScope to me—featuring Gary
Cooper's cold-laced barbs, Burt Lancaster's sardonic smirk, and

S.irita Montiel—is not. worth seeing.
II is- if you can laugh at the al
inosl ridiculous slaughter of un
known thousands of Mexican peons
. nd the quiet, under-acted sarcasm
of tin- dialogue's punch lines for the
farce that they are.
Lancaster and Cooper play their
lines for all they are worth and

111 ay I) e a little
more; thus they
succeed in keeping
11 plodding plot
from completely
boring the pop
corn rnunehers..
C o o p e r has a

distinctive, effective method of paus
ing. turning his back, and then while
walking away hk softly contributes
information designed to jolt any
listeners. As a tough, rugged, far
from rah-rah good guy, he is out
standing.
I ANCAM I.K JtUTIILESS
Lancaster, who is the gold-crazed,
ruthless killer in the skit, also man
ges to keep the audience laughing.
I lis main product is a sly, villainous,
toothy grin which spreads across this
leering face whenever he feels par
ticularly evil. He could be described
as a bloodcurdling Liberace.
Mi s Montiel, who proves that
Cooper has a "soft spot" for more
than horses, provides the film \oith
.some interesting views. Lancaster's
sneering, vicious compatriots put on
a good show as ruthless killers, but
they can't match Lancaster himself.
Den he Darcel, who receives star
billing, seems more out of place in
the movie than the movie does in
the theater.
Having given the cast the once
over, we come finally to (he plot.
Here is the heart of the disaster.
"Vera Cruz," as you are told at the
out::et follows in the great tradition
of W-; ;terns such as "The Covered
Wagon" and "Shane.'' You'd never
have guessed it if you hadn't been
told.
:.f HI I S DIE HARD
Maximilian affectionately known
to I iiicaster as "Maxie" is fighting

| down a rebellion and he hires Coo
per, Lancaster, and crew to pro
vide Miss Darcel with safe coach
transport from Mexico City to Vera
Cruz. Ah, but it is not Miss Darcel
which is the main cargo, but three
million in gold.
Thus, after a long build-up, the
caravan gets under way. It turns
out, however, that Miss Darcel,
Lancaster, Cooper, and the rebels all
: want the gold. This leads to double
crossing complications and the ar
rival of masses of white-shirted, die
hard—and some of them do die aw
fully hard—rebels. .
Get the gist of it? The audience
does pretty quickly, too. But it
takes so terribly long for it all to
happen.

Maximilian affectionately known
to I iiicaster as "Maxie" is fighting

| down a rebellion and he hires Coo
per, Lancaster, and crew to pro
vide Miss Darcel with safe coach
transport from Mexico City to Vera
Cruz. Ah, but it is not Miss Darcel
which is the main cargo, but three
million in gold.
Thus, after a long build-up, the
caravan gets under way. It turns
out, however, that Miss Darcel,
Lancaster, Cooper, and the rebels all
: want the gold. This leads to double
crossing complications and the ar
rival of masses of white-shirted, die
hard—and some of them do die aw
fully hard—rebels. .
Get the gist of it? The audience
does pretty quickly, too. But it
takes so terribly long for it all to
happen.

Geographically speaking, Vera Cruz is a Mexican port south
east of Mexico City. "Vera Cruz," the movie, however, is nowhere.
This is not to say that the Superscope spectacle—although it
looked no different from CinemaScope to me—featuring Gary
Cooper's cold-laced barbs, Burt Lancaster's sardonic smirk, and

S.irita Montiel—is not. worth seeing.
