The benefits and problems of
the leasing of some 4800 acres
of Stanford land to industry,
shopping center, and housing
developments were reviewed
last night by Alf Brandin, Uni
versity Business Manager as part
of the "Stanford —Today and To
morrow" series.
"Three thousand acres of the 9,000
acres of Stanford land arc reserved
for ultimate growth of the campus
with 1,200 in reserve that the ex
panding university can always move
into," Brandin began his talk.
"Of this, 200 acres has already been
established for ultimate industrial
use and I feel confident that we will
add 275 more acres." Brandin ad
ded that many residents in the area
surrounding this section feared that
industry meant large blinking signs,
and ugly smoke buildings and smoke
stacks.
"But it is not an industrial tract
but. an industrial park." The build
ings arc built to rigid university
architectural standards and the
residents arc already pleasantly sur
prised by the buildings already ex
isting," Brandin declared.
"Forty-two acres have been leased
to the regional shopping center with
an equal amount, to be added in the
future. Behind that, land is leased
to white collar industries such as
insurance companies. Two hundred
sixty-four million dollars in busi
ness goes to the San Francisco stores
from the Peninsula. By this shop
ping center, we hope to get some of
the business that would otherwise
go to the city."
Most of the rest, of the land will
be leased for housing developments.
"In some 25-50 years we expect. 40,-
000 people to be living on this prop
erty. It, will be carefully planned
with a certain number of parks and
elementary schools set aside for the
residents.
