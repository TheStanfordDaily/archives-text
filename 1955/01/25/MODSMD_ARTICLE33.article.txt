The Stanford Braves broke out of a half-time tie to defeat Mo
desto JC 67-58, last night in the Pavilion.
The Braves surged to an early 8-0 lead and led up to the last
minute of the first half when Modesto pulled into a 27-27 tie.
Modesto did not hit from the floor until eight minutes had elapsed

♦■but some sharp shooting by guards
| Ray Sampson 'and Jerry Schell
| sparked a Modesto rally late in the
half.
The Braves kept the pressure on
j Modesto with Bob Milton and Gun
nar Christensen scoring on fast
breaks and Bob McGrath hitting
j from around the key.
Brave Coach George Lynn start-
I ed a fresh team in the second half
1 and the Stan fords pulled out to a
quick 38-31 lead with Dave Dunn
and Beppo Dyer doing most of the
j scoring. The Braves easily held the
! lead with a well-balanced attack,
j while Modesto stayed in the game
I only on the free throw shooting of
| Dick McAulitz.
Both teams used man-for-man de-
I fenses. Tight checking by the
Braves made Modesto repeatedly
! lose the ball on bad passes.
Every Brave who got into the
I game scored. McGrath, Christen
sen, Dave Dunn, and Nick Vojvo
' dich all scored nine points for the
i JV's, while Schell and McAulitz led
! Modesto with 10 each.
