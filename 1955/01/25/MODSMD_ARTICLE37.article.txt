### BILL NICHOLS 
Tanned from basking in the Honolulu sun, Coach Howie Dallmar
said he was well satisfied with results of the basketball trip to
Hawaii.
"We went primarily to play basketball but also for some re-

laxation, and we accomplished both,"*
he added. ''We played real good ball
over there, especially the first two
nights."
Dallmar added that the Army All-
Stars put up a good battle until the
j last 10 minutes, but that they
: showed evidence of lack of work
! which kept them from functioning
! as smoothly as they might have. .
Stanford looked very good on
! Friday night but on Saturday the
University of Hawaii employed
j stalling tactics, and while the Cards
led by four to 12 points throughout,
the winning margin was not as great
as the night before.
The squad had several light work
' outs, and spent gameless days relax
| ing on the beach playing volleyball
or splashing in the surf. Dallmar
expressed the opinion that it was a
good break before conference play
gets under way again the weekend
after next.
The cagers did not work out yes
! terday, but hard practices are sched
! uled for today and tomorrow in
! preparation for USF and Santa
| Clara this Friday and Saturday.
"We'll have to be hitting well
I against the Dons," mentioned Dall
mar, "because we won't be getting
many second shots with that Russell
,in there." Bill Russell is the 6-10
j USF center, who promises to show
j the Card basketballers a rough time
! at the Cow Palace.
