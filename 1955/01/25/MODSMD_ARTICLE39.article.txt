# Grid 'Game of Week' TV Plan Dead, Says Masters

### BILL WRIGHT 
(Editor's note: This is the sec
ond of a series of articles, based
011 an interview with Athletic Di
rector Al Masters, about the con
flicting proposals for telecasting
college football.)

Al Masters, Stanford's director
of athletics, emphatically stated
that the Pacific Coast Conference
feels that the "game of the week"
plan for televising college foot
ball is "dead."
Masters is the chairman of the
PCC's radio and television commit
tee and is a strong advocate of the
conference's proposals for regional
television, nationally controlled, for
football games this fall.
Why do the PCC and Western
Conference (Big Ten) schools want
to drop the coast-to-coast "game of
the week'' format seen last year?
"We think it is dead." said Masters.
LACK OF SPONSOR
He went on to say that last year
the American Broadcasting Com
pany— after investing two million
dollars for rights alone—could not
find a national sponsor and only at
the last minute did ABC manage to
get off the financial hook with re
gional sponsorship. Masters indi
cated that the National College Ath
letic Association would not get a
good price for football TV rights— l
not nearly two million dollars —un-
der the same set-up as last year.
The broadcasting companies cannot
afford it.
And despite the high price paid
by ABC, many schools which tele
vised last year lost money—includ

ing Stanford. Under the PCC policy
of dividing TV revenue among all
the schools, Stanford's share of the
money from the Stanford - Illinois,
USC - Oregon, and Cal - Oklahoma
games did not make up for the lost
attendance at the Illini tilt. Cal also
took a loss and SC and Oregon
barely broke even.
UCLA, the conference champion,
exercised its option and declined to
have any of its games televised.
This is what the PCC and Big Ten
say they will do if the NCAA con
tinues the "game of the week" sys
tem this fall.
MODIFIED PLAN
The modified "game of the week"
plan suggested* by the Eastern Col

legiate Athletic Conference (ECAC)
incorporates last year's system of
televising one game nationally each
Saturday. And a team may go on
the national hook-up only once per
season.
The ECAC proposes a change from
last year which would allow the
sponsor to choose the coming week's
game up until five days before the
event.
The PCC is also opposed to this,
according to Masters, because of the
effect it would have on ticket sales.
Masters believes that many people
would delay their ticket purchasing
until after the TV announcement
and thus cut attendance all over the
country.
