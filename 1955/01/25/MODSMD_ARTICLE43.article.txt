# Business Office Reports on Progress Of Correction of Campus Hazards
## Two Conditions Now Remedied 
### DICK MANSFIELD Associate Editor, The Daily 
The University Business Of
fice has given consideration to
and, in many cases, made plans
to correct nine situations de
scribed as "campus hazards" in
a student report submitted last
spring, according to Assistant
Business Manager S. F. Post.
Two of the "hazardous" conditions
lmve actually been corrected. The
Business Office has acted to paint
parkins lines in parking lots and to
in-tall bicycle racks at Engineering
Corner.
In what amounted to a progress
report on the recommendations .sub
mitted by Axe Society's Committee
for the Investigation and Prevention
of £ampus Hazards (dated March 3,
191)4), Post went on to say that con
siderations of economy and the pres
ent fluctuating state of University
planning have held up further ac
tion on the committee's recommen
dations for the present.
'The Business Oltice feels the
.students have done a swell job on
this report," Post said, "and we're
working ahead on all the proposals
as money and other campus plan
ning projects permit."
" In view of the great volume of
spending on University develop
ments and building program, only
the most urgent projects outside
these programs can be considered
right now," he added.
In all, the Hazards Committee sub
mitted eight recommendations and
a list of suggestions for correcting a
ninth "campus hazard." Six of the
"hazards" listed were directly re
lated to traffic conditions on cam

pus roads and intersections.
Post pointed out that the Univer
sity is considering major changes in
the streets and traffic patterns on
campus, with such features as a pe
ripheral road to take traffic around
the campus and ease traffic conges
tion in the acadcmic area.
Such innovations might render
unnecessary or even inadvisable
some of the Hazards Committee's
recommendations, the Business Of
fice feels.
Much of the Business Office's con
sideration of the student recommen
dations was based on a written ap
praisal submitted by Chief Gordon
Davis of the Stanford Police De
partment.
In detail, here are the recommen
dations of the Hazards Committee
report and the action taken on each
one:
1. I'aint a white line the length
of Palm Drive to remind people to
stay on one side of the road . . .
(or) remove llie crown in the
middle of the road . . . (and) im
prove the lighting of the road.
Commenting on this recommenda
tion, Chief Davis doubted how ef

fective such a line would be, since
at. peak traffic hours traffic moves
two lanes abreast in one direction
or the other, and there would be no
room for two lanes of cars on one
side of a line painted down the mid
dle of Palm Drive.
The proposal to reduce the crown
of the road was not approved by the
Business Office: "ft was felt that the
results would not justify the ex
pense." Also, the Palm Drive condi
tion would be greatly changed
should tentative road-building plans
for the University be carried out.
2. Take action to corrcct the
large number of traffic violations
at the Kscondido-Argilcjlo inter
section (between Stern and Toyon
Halls). The committee offered no
specific recommendation.
Chief Davis noted that the Police
Department does not have sufficient
personnel to maintain a constant pa
trol at this point. The Business Of
fice has tentative plans on file which
would close Arguello to all automo
tive traffic; this plan is involved in
the building program.
Paint parking lines in park
ing lots .
The Business Office has been
working on this problem and has
put down a great number of "traf
fic buttons" to mark parking places
and crosswalks.
4. ''Since there is as much dan
ger in going too slow as there is
in going too fast, we feel that
the speed of traffic on Palm Drive
should be legalized at 155 miles per
hour," the Hazards Committee re
port said.
"No action has been taken because

it is not felt that increase in speed
will contribute to the safety of the
campus residents." Post said.
5. Paint a white line on Em
barcadero to keep drivers 011 their
own sides of the street. (Specific
reference was to the wide curve
near the Stadium.)
Future traffic plans for the cam
pus might obviate the need for such
a step. Post indicated.
6. Place a bicycle nick at Engi
neering Corner to "localize the
litter of transportation outside the
door."
A bicycle rack has been installed
at Engineering Corner.
7. Install easy-opening doors in
Quad buildings to take the place
of the hard-to-open double doors
now in most buildings.
The Business Office notes that the
expense of installing so-called "pan
ic hardwax-e" on all doors would be
immense. "Would the students like
to have easy-opening doors instead
of better lights for classrooms?" Post
asked. He questioned the extent to
which this condition is "hazardous."
8. Install a (yellow) caution
light near Lagunita to slow the
traffic down, and patrol the area
more carfullv.
Post said that the Business Office
liked the idea of a caution light
near the dormitory and was moving
in that direction.
The committee submitted sev
eral suggestions for re - routing
traffic around the post officc-Ccl
lar - Bookstore area to case the
congestion and danger to pedes
trians there.
In appraising the suggestions.
Chief Davis noted that often as not
correction of a traffic condition at
one point may produce a new prob
lem somewhere else. Post indicated
that the University's traffic plans
might well take traffic away from
this area in the near future anyway,
and thus eliminate the problem.


CAMPUS HAZARD AREA?—Typical evening traffic heads out Palm Drive toward Palo Alto. A
student "campus hazards" report submitted to the University administration last spring recom
mended that a white line be painted down the middle of Palm Drive; the University Business Of
fice has road-building plans for the campus which might eliminate the need for such a step.
