Shaw's turn-of-the-century farce
"Misalliance."
A few tickets are still available at

Shaw himself never had any doubts.
His estimate: "one of my master
pieces.

Players' production are Lair Parent
anjl Kathleen Duffy as Mr. and Mrs.
Tarleton. Though the Tarletons arc I

I not to the manner born, they man
age to live as if they were, thanks to
the Tarleton Underwear Company.
Mr. Tarleton, in the meantime, is
firmly convinced that he is destined
to be a great philoospher.
Judith Doty will be seen as the
daughter Hypatia, who is tired of
being good and yearns to be wicked.
Johnny Tarleton, a frank young
man who despises thinkers and
claims that the natural man is the
world's only real doer and maker,
is played by George Ralph.
Others in the cast include Charles
Lyons as the elderly Lord Summer
