# HOUSE GRANTS SPECIAL MILITARY POWER
## Ike Gets Go-Ahead on Formosa 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (UP) —
The House voted overwhelmingly
today to give President Eisenhower
almost blank-check powers to use
U.S. military forces in defense of
Formosa and its invasion approaches
against Chinese Communist attack.

The roll call vote of 400 to 3
which came only a day after Mr. Ei
senhower requested the authority
was one of the biggest majorities
rolled up in the House for any pro
posal in recent years.
The dissenting voles were cast b>

Representatives Graham A. Barden
(D., N.C.), Eugene Siler (R., Ky.),
and Timothy Sheehan (R., 111.).
The action was an emphatic an
swer to a plea by Democratic and
Republican Congressional leaders—
and Mr. Eisenhower himself—for a
dramatic show of American unity in
a new hour of cold war crisis in the
Far East.
The resolution gives the President
broad authority to order U.S. forces
"to fight if necessary" to defend
Chiang Kai-shek's island citadel of
Formctsa and the neighboring Pes
cadores Islands. Some lawmakers
said this included use of atomic
weapons.
The combined Senate Foreign Re
lations and Armed Services Com
mittees completed their hearings on
the extraordinary resolution late to
day and scheduled a secret vote for
10 a.m. EST (7 a.m. PST) tomorrow.
Chairman Walter F. George (D.,
Ga.) of the Foreign Relations group
said the measure might be rushed
to the Senate floor for final Con
gressional action by 1 p.m. EST (10
a.m. PST).
George refused to predict how
long Hie Senate debate might run.
liul lie said Senator Estes Kefauver
(D„ Tenn.) was considering offering
a substitute that would "change the
meaning of the resolution." He said
he "would be decidedly opposed to
the substitute."
The Senate committees ended
their hearings after listening to Ad
miral Arthur Z. Radford, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of StafT, and the
representatives of the various serv
ices. Radford said the Joint Chiefs
supported the President's Formosan
request.
