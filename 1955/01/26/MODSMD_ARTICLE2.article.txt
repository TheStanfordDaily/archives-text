# Matinee Features Shaw Readings
## 
### 
A program of readings from the
letters of George Bernard Shaw and
Mrs. Patrick Campbell will be pre
sented on this afternoon's Theater
Matinee at 4:15 in the Little Theater.
Carolyn Cowan and Eric Johnson
will read the selections. Judy Schae
fer will do the explanatory narra
tion.
Mrs. Campbell was an actress of
some note as well as a personal
friend of Shaw's. The two artists
collaborated in the production of
many plays and exchanged letters
which were alternately vitriolic and
tender, but always witty.
Theater Matinee is open to the
public without charge.
