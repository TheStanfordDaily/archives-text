## "I Said,'- And Probably a Tax Cut Next Year'" For Better Public Relations 
### 
The ASSU Executive Committee is scheduled
to give final consideration tonight to a recom
mendation which would dissolve the Public
Relations Board and set up in its place a new
public relations organization.
Mary Margaret Fraser, present Board direc
tor, turned in a two-page report to Excom last
week stating the whys and wherefores for such
an action. She termed the existing 30-man
structure as "too unwieldy" to do the job. She
maintained that there was too much dead wood
in the working forest and not enough jobs for
all.
She listed the various duties of the Pub Rel
committees: the advisory board, the regulatory
board, the offic'e staff, the internal affairs com
mittee, and the external affairs committee. She
stated that these various functions could be
easily handled by an eleven man pub rel team.
She told Excom last week that the biggest
job Pub Rel has had to cope with was the ad
dressing and mailing of 350 Christmas cards.
A project which was handled by a handful of
people in one afternoon.
There are other tasks for Pub Rel as well, of
course. They regulate all campus publicity
and advise groups seeking advice on publicity
media. They act as a liaison between Palo Alto

merchants and the students; between the Uni
versity and organizations such as the Mother's
Club, the Alumni Association, and other
schools; and they are responsible for all prob
lems of public relations which arise in the
office of ASSU.
An imposing list of duties to be sure, but
Miss Fraser strongly believes that, "A small,
compact, and efficient committee will be defi
nitely better able to fulfill its function on be
half of the ASSU."
The present Pub Rel Board favors the new
plan.
Excom wanted time last week to consider the
recommendation. They knew that dissolving
Pub Rel would entail ASSU Constitutional By
law changes and would necessitate holding in
terviews for a new director and new members
as the existing staff would be dissolved along
with the present structure according to the
Constitution.
It would be a lot of trouble for Excom to go
through if the change isn't really necessary, but
we go along with Miss Fraser in feeling it is
time for a change. We command her and her
committee for examing itself realistically and
offering a sound remedy for the situation.
