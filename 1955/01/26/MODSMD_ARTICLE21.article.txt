### RIC TEAGUE 
Well, Admiral, a lot of you NROTC gentlemen have
been wondering what you will be able to do with all
your naval training when you get out of the service.
According to Time Magazine, the boating industry
has, for the first time, gone over the billion dollar
mark. This means that quite a few Americans lay out
quite a chunk of cash just to be seafaring, in one way
or another.
So. sailor, there is a pretty good chance that you,
someday, will own a nifty little yacht, or rowboat, or
something. You can see what an advantage your
nautical training will be. How many whistles for
passing on the right. What "baker-easy-easy-roger"
means. How many buttons on a sailor's pants. Vital
information for the voyager who owns his own sea
going transportation.
When you hop aboard your sixty-foot schooner for
a schooner or two you'll have to know how pipe the
guests on board and how to pour them ashore. You'll
need the latest methods for scraping barnacles and
wearing blue denims. All this comes easy for an ex-
Ensign. And that, me bucko, is what you're studying
to be.
Once you become the skipper of your runabout,
catboat, or yacht of some other sort, you'll need to
know a lot about signal flags. NROTC gives you most

of the information on this hut there are specialized
flags that the Navy doesn't use. Abercrombie and
Fitch, purveyors oi' everything in New York, have
some of the latest and more unique types, I under
stand.
An admiral of the ocean sea who plied the Hudson
on weekends once went to Abercrombie and Fitch
and requested that they design for him a signal pen
nant that he could fiy from the top ol his mast to let
other yachtsmen in the harbor know he was serving
drinks on board. This resulted in a martini glass in
white against a blue background (if my memory
serves me).
The yachtsman wouldn't let A & F use his flag for
just everybody, but the idea became so popular that
A & F came up with a green flag with a beer mug on
it to satisfy the demand. This is only one of the many
interesting accessories to the life of the boat-owner.
So you see, swabby, take advantage of your naval
training and thereby prepare yourself for a fuller
civilian life. It's just a small matter of scholastic ap
plication, an effortless period of service, and you'll be
ready to take an active part in the functions of your
local yacht club.
So, button those thirteen buttons and buckle down.
You can never tell when you, too, will own a rowboat.

guests on board and how to pour them ashore. You'll
need the latest methods for scraping barnacles and
wearing blue denims. All this comes easy for an ex-
Ensign. And that, me bucko, is what you're studying
to be.
Once you become the skipper of your runabout,
catboat, or yacht of some other sort, you'll need to
know a lot about signal flags. NROTC gives you most

of the information on this hut there are specialized
flags that the Navy doesn't use. Abercrombie and
Fitch, purveyors oi' everything in New York, have
some of the latest and more unique types, I under
stand.
An admiral of the ocean sea who plied the Hudson
on weekends once went to Abercrombie and Fitch
and requested that they design for him a signal pen
nant that he could fiy from the top ol his mast to let
other yachtsmen in the harbor know he was serving
drinks on board. This resulted in a martini glass in
white against a blue background (if my memory
serves me).
The yachtsman wouldn't let A & F use his flag for
just everybody, but the idea became so popular that
A & F came up with a green flag with a beer mug on
it to satisfy the demand. This is only one of the many
interesting accessories to the life of the boat-owner.
So you see, swabby, take advantage of your naval
training and thereby prepare yourself for a fuller
civilian life. It's just a small matter of scholastic ap
plication, an effortless period of service, and you'll be
ready to take an active part in the functions of your
local yacht club.
So, button those thirteen buttons and buckle down.
You can never tell when you, too, will own a rowboat.
Well, Admiral, a lot of you NROTC gentlemen have
been wondering what you will be able to do with all
your naval training when you get out of the service.
According to Time Magazine, the boating industry
has, for the first time, gone over the billion dollar
mark. This means that quite a few Americans lay out
quite a chunk of cash just to be seafaring, in one way
or another.
So. sailor, there is a pretty good chance that you,
someday, will own a nifty little yacht, or rowboat, or
something. You can see what an advantage your
nautical training will be. How many whistles for
passing on the right. What "baker-easy-easy-roger"
means. How many buttons on a sailor's pants. Vital
information for the voyager who owns his own sea
going transportation.
When you hop aboard your sixty-foot schooner for
a schooner or two you'll have to know how pipe the
guests on board and how to pour them ashore. You'll
need the latest methods for scraping barnacles and
wearing blue denims. All this comes easy for an ex-
Ensign. And that, me bucko, is what you're studying
to be.
