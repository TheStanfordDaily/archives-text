# Keio University Plan Spreads Farm Fame

### EDA MENDELS 
An idea, a few thoughtful letters, and Stanford was engaged in
another project that will increase her good name abroad and bring
benefits to the student body.
That was the birth of the Keio Aifiliation Committee, a group
that it now engaged in an active exchange of pictures, recofds,

and newsletters with Keio Univer
sity in Tokyo, Japan.
The Keio affiliation was begun at
the suggestion of Dr. James T. Wat
kins, IV, head of the Political Sci
ence Department. He remarked on
the similarities between Keio and
Stanford. Both are private schools,
have nearly the same size student
bodies, and "have long traditions of
freedom and individuality."
Since Stanford's first letters to
Keio, a Stanford Committee has
been organized there. It will work
for the same ultimate goal as its
Stanford counterpart: an exchange
of students and faculty through a
series of fund-raising projects. Mel
ba Mamiya, chairman of the Keio
Committee here, said that the cur
rent exchange of materials i.s an
intermediate step, "lit rough the
cultural exchange we hope to work
up interest and to acquaint people
with Japan and Keio college life."
'file local committee has written
and sent newsletters about the foot
ball saason, rushing, and the fnsti
tute of international Relations. Since
reading in Keio's English monthly
that Keio students wanted more in
formation about the way their uni
versity was administered, they have
prepared an outline of the Stanford
â€”Today and Tomorrow programs.
The committee has also sent pic
tures and Dailies to Tokyo, as well
as a recording of the 1954 Gaieties
which Ram's Head donated.
Tokyo students have reciprocated
with tape recordings of Keio col
lege songs, radio programs they
have put on, a biography of the
university's founder, and pictures of
the campus and activities.
The affiliation was boosted this fall
when three Keio students visited
Stanford with the Japan - America
Conference. They told about their

school, gave Keio pins, and received
Quads. One promised to write about
Stanford in the English monthly.
The Keio Committee here has two
Keio graduates among' its members,
Kunio Yonemoto and Shuichiro Ni
shiura. Committee members Shar
man Vaughn and Ned Harrold, as
well as Miss Mamiya, have been in
Japan. Others working on the affili
ation are Marcy Johnson, director of
llR's affiliation department, Karen
Erickson, Mary Anna Watanabe,
Margie Trammel, Judy Lehman, and
Bill White. Adviser is Dr. Robert
Brower, professor of Japanese, who
joined the faculty this fall after a
period of research in Japan.
