# Now That Time Again...
## 
### 
Now that it is January and the frost is still on New Year's Reslu
tions and the campus appears to be in need of the warmth of-friendly
humor, the Chappie is out.
Now that the Chappie is out and the Old Boy is recovering from
hysterical outbursts at his own jokes, students may forget their in
tellects and contemplate cartoons, exchange yuks, and special articles.
Now that these cartoons, yuks, and articles have been printed by
machines that are operated by men who draw wages, the Chappio costs
30 cents.
Know that, or it might not seem worth it.
