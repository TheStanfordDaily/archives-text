# Trio of USF Stars Who Will Test Cards Friday

### 

DASHING DONSâ€”Here are three of the members of the top
ranking University of San Francisco quintet which the Stanford
basketballers will face at the Cow Palace Friday night. They are
(left to right): Bill Bush, K. C. Jones, and Stan Buchanan, all of
whom have combined their talents with Bill Russell and Jerry
Mullen to earn a 12-1 record for the season, which rates USF


as the number two basketball team in the nation according to
the latest International News Service ratings. Bush, a 6-foot
junior, is a guard and may be replaced by Hal Perry by Friday's
opening whistle. He is one of the top set shooters on the Don
squad. Jones, a 6-1 senior guard, is the "take charge" man on
the USF squad, and the number two scorer on the team behind


the fabulous Bill Russell with a 13-point average. He is also an
outstanding rebounder, as well as the Dons' best foul shooter.
Buchanan, a 6-3 senior who will go at one of the forward spots,
is not a big scorer, but has tremendous drive and hustle and
pulls off many rebounds. Mullen may be a doubtful starter Fri
day night because of a sprained ankle.
