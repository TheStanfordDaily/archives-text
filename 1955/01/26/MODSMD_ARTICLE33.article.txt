(Editor's note: This is the third of a series of articles, based on an in
terview with Athletic Director Al Masters, about the conflicting pro
posals for telecasting college football.)

This week the National Collegiate Athletic Conference's tele
vision committee is struggling with the problems involving the
televising of college football in the fall—and according to Uni
versity Athletic Director Al Masters, it may be quite a struggle.
Although the split in the NCAA ranks does not approach an

equal division, the NCAA is faced"*
with an almost irreconcilable dead
lock. The power, prestige, and box
office drawing ability of the Pacific
Coast Conference and the Western
Conference (Big Ten) are matched
against the superior voting strength,
almost 4 to 1, of the rest of the |
NCAA.
The PCC and the Big Ten have
taken a strong stand against a re
newal of the "game of the week"
plan for grid TV favored by most of
the schools. The two conferences
have announced that they will not
permit any of their teams to par
ticipate in "game of the week" TV.
Each school has the right to de
cline to have any of its games tele
vised.
"We have taken the heart out of
the 'game of the week' program,"
admitted Masters, who is the chair
man of the PCC radio and TV com
the football television audience is in
the Big Ten area. And another large
percentage is on the Coast.
According to Masters, the PCC
and the Big Ten feel that the "game
of the week" program is "dead" and
that it is time for a change. The
change the conferences propose is
a regional TV set-up under national
NCAA control.
''We don't say that this is the final
answer to the TV problem; there
may be no answer. But we feel that
the "game of the week" system has

proved itself inadequate and that it
is time to try something new," said
Masters. "We believe regional TV
will be an improvement."
He acknowledged that the Pacific
Coast is the best suited of the eight
NCAA regions for regional TV, and
that the New England-New York
area might find it more difficult.
But he says that football TV under
any system faces more problems in
the East. ,
As an illustration of the unusual
conditions in New York, Masters
pointed out that the games from the
West Coast had a higher audience
rating than the Eastern games which
were televised last year. (This might
be a result of the time difference.)
Thus the NCAA television com
mittee must compromise the major
ity stand for a renewal of the "game
of the week" system, led by the
Eastern Collegiate Athletic Confer
ence, with the PCC-Big Ten re
gional plan because the PCC and
Big Ten can practically ruin the
ECAC format by not participating.
Masters said he had no idea what
the NCAA would do.

equal division, the NCAA is faced"*
with an almost irreconcilable dead
lock. The power, prestige, and box
office drawing ability of the Pacific
Coast Conference and the Western
Conference (Big Ten) are matched
against the superior voting strength,
almost 4 to 1, of the rest of the |
NCAA.
The PCC and the Big Ten have
taken a strong stand against a re
newal of the "game of the week"
plan for grid TV favored by most of
the schools. The two conferences
have announced that they will not
permit any of their teams to par
ticipate in "game of the week" TV.
Each school has the right to de
cline to have any of its games tele
vised.
"We have taken the heart out of
the 'game of the week' program,"
admitted Masters, who is the chair
man of the PCC radio and TV com
the football television audience is in
the Big Ten area. And another large
percentage is on the Coast.
According to Masters, the PCC
and the Big Ten feel that the "game
of the week" program is "dead" and
that it is time for a change. The
change the conferences propose is
a regional TV set-up under national
NCAA control.
''We don't say that this is the final
answer to the TV problem; there
may be no answer. But we feel that
the "game of the week" system has

proved itself inadequate and that it
is time to try something new," said
Masters. "We believe regional TV
will be an improvement."
He acknowledged that the Pacific
Coast is the best suited of the eight
NCAA regions for regional TV, and
that the New England-New York
area might find it more difficult.
But he says that football TV under
any system faces more problems in
the East. ,
As an illustration of the unusual
conditions in New York, Masters
pointed out that the games from the
West Coast had a higher audience
rating than the Eastern games which
were televised last year. (This might
be a result of the time difference.)
Thus the NCAA television com
mittee must compromise the major
ity stand for a renewal of the "game
of the week" system, led by the
Eastern Collegiate Athletic Confer
ence, with the PCC-Big Ten re
gional plan because the PCC and
Big Ten can practically ruin the
ECAC format by not participating.
Masters said he had no idea what
the NCAA would do.
