A last-minute technical foul for
too many time outs cost Menlo JC
a chance for possession of the boll
and victory, as the Stanford Frosh
basketballers eked out a 72-66
triumph on the loser's court.
•
With 50 seconds left, a jump ball
was called between Stanford's little
Dean Thomas and 6-2 Jed Warner of
Menlo. At this point Menlo called
the rule-violating time out. Stan
ford was given a free throw and the
ball out of bounds. Tony Vigna
missed the charity toss, and Thomas
passed in to Tom Dyer, second string
guard. Dyer drove, made a layup,
and was fouled. He made his free
throw attempt and Jay Jackson's
jump shot seconds later provided the
winning margin.
The Papooses jumped off to a ten
point lead in the first two minutes
of the game, but then Menlo tight

ened up and slowly whittled the
lead down to five points at halftime,
41-36.
With 6 minutes to go in the second
half, Menlo, led by Warner and Dave
Brewer, went ahead by 64-55.
Then the Papooses began to hit.
Gary Van Galder, Jay Jackson, and
Vigna all sank two pointers, and
Mike Gray got three to put the frosh
ahead, 65-64, a lead they never re
linquished.
Scoring honors went to Stanford's
Gary Van Galder, who got 18 points
via the lay up and free throw route.
Second in scoring was Menlo's Brew
er, who hit for 15 with a series of
jump and set shots. Menlo's Jack
Preaseau and Papoose Mike Gray
took third and fourth place honors
with 14 and 13 points respectively.
