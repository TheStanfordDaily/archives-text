# 150 Reservations Taken For Winter Ski Carnival
## 
### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
With Winter Carnival time getting near, Ski Club President Hal
Courtney hailed the weekend snow festival as "one of the biggest
things we've ever done." He said that so far over a hundred and
fifty Stanford students have made reservations for the Carnival,
to be held this Friday, Saturday, and Sunday St Squaw Valley.

Courtney said that last year's*
Winter Carnival, held at Yosemite,
drew only about 85 people altogeth
er, even though Ski Club member
ship was much larger. He theorized
that the enthusiastic response to this
year's Carnival is due to several
factors. "One of the biggest," he
said, "is the fact that we've changed
the location from Yosemite to
Squaw Valley."
He explained that the big Lake
Tahoe resort is able to handle more
skiers and to provide a wider vari
ety of skiing, plus having usually
better snow conditions than the
lower Yosemite slopes.
This year's banquet will be held
in Squaw Valley Lodge at 8 p.m. !

►
Saturday. An orchestra will play
during the banquet and afterward
for dancing. Dress for the banquet
will be ski clothes, Courtney said.
Courtney also said that a full
schedule of events has been planned
for the weekend.


WINTER CARNlVAL—Standing in front of a display of prizes in the Bookstore window, Ski Club
President Hal Courtney holds the trophy which will be awarded to the winning team entered by a
club or living group in the races this weekend. Ski team members and experienced racers will not
be allowed to enter these races, Courtney stressed, which will be for the average skier. There
will be a special race for beginners, with prizes being awarded to top skiers in all events.
