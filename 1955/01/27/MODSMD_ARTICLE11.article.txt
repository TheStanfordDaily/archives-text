# UNANIMOUS VOTE
## Pub Rel Reorganization Wins Excom's Approval 
### DICK MANSFIELD Associate Editor, The Daily 
Effective next Wednesday night, the present Public Relations
Board of ASSU is disbanded and a new committee with different
structure but similar title and functions set up in its place, the i
Executive Committee decided by unanimous vote at its weekly j
meeting last night.
Student Manager Bob Gable presented two motions- one to!

disband the present Pub Rel
the second to adopt a proposed set j
of bylaw changes setting up the new I
Tub r?cl Board — and Loth were 1
passed with minimal discussion.
The motions take effect at the next
weekly Excom meeting.
The new Public Relations Board
will function with a membership
much smaller than that of the pres- i
ent Board. Mary-Margaret Eraser, !
chairman of the present Board, rec- j
ommended the reorganization in a !
report submitted to Excom last
week. Her hope was to derive "a
small, compact, and efficient com
mittee."
Also at last night's meeting. Ex- '
com decided that the profits of the I
Quad and the Frosh Handbook (both j
put out by personnel of the Quad [
staff) be lumped together in divid
ing profits among the Quad staff,
but that $50 should be held out of
the profits of the 1954 Quad and the
1957 Frosh Book (both published
last year) to be divided among
"those who worked particularly
hard" on the Frosh Book.
The co-editors of the 1954 Quad-
Jon Stufflebeem and Ralph Buch
walter—are to make the division of
the $50, subject to Excom and Pub- j
lications Board approval.
Buchwalter, speaking for the
Quad, had proposed a plan to keep
Quad and Frosh Book profits sepa
rate, arid to split the Quad profits
among the entire Quad staff and the
Frosh Book profits within the group |
of those who actively worked on
the Frosh Book.
Buchwalter felt that there should
be extra monetary reward for tho
extra effort involved in putting out
the Frosh Book.
Gable presented a counterpropo
sal which was close in substance to
the present setup, under which

*
! Quad - Frosh Book profits up to
$1,700 arc split between staff mem
bers on a percentage basis. His pro
posal was passed with a rider pro
viding for monetary recognition of
the Frosh Book .staff.
Then Excom passed ttie $50 mo-
J tion referring to last year's Quad
j and Frosh Book.
Stufflebeem and Tom Uant ex- I
| pressed concern in the course of the !
1 di cussion that an equitable share of j
the profits be given the junior Quad i
editor in charge of living group pic
tures, in recognition of his "difficult j
job" in connection with the Frosh I
Book. 1
