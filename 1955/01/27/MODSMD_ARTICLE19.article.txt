# The 						Student Role Begins
## 
### 
Hew impetus will be given the Study of Un
dorgraduate Education tonight from some of
those most vitally concerned with its outcome â€”
undergraduate students.
The 18-member committee selected last week
to work on the project is meeting at the home
of Dr. Donald Taylor, director of the Study, for
.in orientation and get-acquainted session. They
v/ili he briefed on the work the faculty com
untune has done up to now and plan their own
course oi action for the year.
Their work will be unique in the history of
Stanford. Never before has a student group
been formally consulted to determine just what
kind of an education they are receiving, what
type of an education they would like.
The natural tendency in universities is for
the faculty and administration to assume a
pditly-justifiable attitude of "we know best"
.ind establish curriculum requirements and
leaching standards based on their knowledge.
Stanford ha.s never strictly adhered to this

general rule. Two years ago the lower division
language requirements were changed at the
urging of numerous students.
However, the over-all academic pictuie at
Stanford, the comparative emphasis on teach
ing and research, the motivations and attitudes
of students, and the goals of the University
have been considered outside the realm of stu
dent concern.
The Study of Undergraduate Education has
changed that. Students will be working with
faculty and administration members on all
these problems. Among them they will trade
the wisdom, gained from experience for the
needs and ambitions of youth.
We feel certain the Study will accomplish
its purpose of improving the educational op
portunities at Stanford as long as it is firmly
based on respect for the opinions and judg
ments of the Stanford student as well as the
Stanford professor.
