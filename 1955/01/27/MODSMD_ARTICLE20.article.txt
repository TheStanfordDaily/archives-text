"I'd like to learn more about the current
world situation, but I just don't have the time."
This is a common and not unjustified com*
plaint of Stanford students. A student's life is
.j mixture of classes, assignments, and extra
curricular activities. There is constant pressure
from midterms, papers, and meetings.
It is difficult, and sometimes near-impossible,
to squeeze in the perusal ol newspapers, maga
zines, and radio-TV commentaries necessary
to give one a well-rounded picture of the overall
world scene.
The time and the opportunity to obtain some
of this knowledge will be offered by the West
'-mi College Conference on American Foreign
Policy, which will be held here Sunday through
Wednesday.
The conference will feature speeches, panels,
.ind debates on topics such as "American Lead
ership and the Communist Threat," "Recogni
tion of Communist China," and "Retaliation
.jg.iint Communist China: it's Asian Repercus
sions "

These are hardly subjects for dry, intellec
tual discussions. They are alive and vital. Just
ask any draft-age Stanford male whether or not
he is interested in the outcome of the Formosan
question, whether or not he cared what hap
pened on the battlefields of Korea.
Participating in the conference will be ex
perts in various international fields. Harold E.
Stassen, director of Foreign Operations Admin
istration. Dr. Hugh Tines, president of Pepper
dine College. Paul Lazarfield from the Fprd
Institute of Behavorial Sciences. C. Easton
Rothwell, director ol the Hoover Institute and
Library.
These men and several others will be con
tributing their knowledge and ideas to this
conference, giving students from Western col
leges and universities an informed analysis of
the world struggle against Communism.
We hope as many Stanford students as pos
sible will take advantage of the conference.
Nothing could be more timely or more oppor
tune.
