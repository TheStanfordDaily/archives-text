# Snow Fever Hits Campus
## 
### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
As the weekend draws near,
symptoms of a common winter
malaise grew more evident on
the campus. The signs were j
plain: a daydreaming, far-away
look, a slight bend of the knees
while standing, skin red and
flushed with suntan. Ski fever
was appearing in epidemic pro-!
portions.
At the ASSU office, Ski Club of-
J fieia Is .said thai, they had closed res- j
| ervations because Squaw Valley,
site of the Winter Carnival, was full;
! members of the Stanford ski team,
; baldest hit by the malady, made
plans to leave Wednesday night for
j a skiing meet ;iL Edelweiss on High
| way 50 against the University of
| Nevada, San Jose, Modesto, and
j other schools.
The sickness was spreading
throughout the Bay Area also as
i ski shops up and down the Penin
, •.11 1 ii reported their equipment being
! rented or sold at a record rate.
Hut perhaps the largest group af
| lected by the skiing bug were some
1 150 Stanford students who have
j signed up to go to Squaw Valley
! (his weekend for the annual Farm
l Winter Carnival.
! Some imaginative minds sat in
| class as early as last week dream-
I ing of the two or three days to be !
j spent at the famous Sierra resort, j
j which boasts the longest chairlii't in I
the world, plus a new supplemen
| tary Constam lift which takes skiers
j from the porch of the Squaw Valley
j lodge !MJ() feet up to the slopes of
| (he Powder Horn.
Even though their dreams may J
i not have included the high, open !
slopes of Squaw Peak, the sufferers |
i could at least see two days of good j
j skiing tilled with such events as!
; amateur and beginners' races, ob- j
I stqcle races, team races, and a giant |
slalom, with prizes and trophies to J
I be awarded to top competitors.
Among the many prizes is a pair ]

' worth about $85. The skis, donated
j by Smith's, will go to the winner of:
the giant slalom. Other prizes in- j
etude live sleeping bags and 15 belt
buckle awards given as prizes by !
