(Editor's note: This is the first in a series of articles dealing with the
rules in various spoils and what Stanford roaches and other Farm ath-
Iclic o licials think' of (hem. 'I he coaches were asked to comment on the
rules in their particular sport and also make any suggestions f"i' chang
ing or improving them.)

Stanford football coach Chuck Taylor would like to see the end
of the point after touchdown, while Farm boxing coach Ray Lunny
feels that the use of lighter gloves would cut down the number of
injuries in professional boxing.
Although he has never lost a game via the extra point and has

won by it three times during
Leiiure on the Farm, including the
famous 21 to 20 win over UCI..A in
ITaylor is ol the opinion that
llif point after touchdown is not a
Ln;c indication of the superiority
"lit'tween any two football teams.
"II the teams are so evenly
matched that it em's in a tie, then
that's line and let the chips lall
where they may," Taylor .said re
cently.
1 don't think there would be any
more ties than you have now," Tay
lor continued, "and don't forget, yon
have lies in plenty of sports- soccer,
wiestling, track, boxing, and many
others as ju.st an example."
Taylor does not care lor any ol
the alternative suggestions to break
ties in football, such as giving points
!'<#• most first downs, yardage, etc.,
which have been advocated in the
past. "They're all too complicated,"
lie says.
I I I'll.I) GOAL EMPHASIS
"Of course, when you eliminate
the extra point, you tend to place a
greater emphasis on field goals as
tie-breakers and that's all right, be
cause there is .some special ability
required to kick them."
In discussing the new football
rides adopted by the NCAA at its
meeting this month, Taylor says that
he likes the new substitution rule

♦
which allows a player to return once
| any time during a quarter if he
| started the quarter. Under the old
rules, a player could not return until
j the last lour minutes of the period
! once he had been removed from the
| game.
"This new rule eliminates the
1 senselessness of the old lour-minutc
j rule," Taylor stated, "and it will al
j low a team tA substitute more logi
j cally."

"With this new rule, we will now
! be able to me a player with special
defensive abilities. To illustrate this,
; there are about four or five changes
! of the ball during each quarter of
I a game. If you are deep in your
j own territory on defense at the start
of a quarter, you can put in a
strong defensive man for certain po
sitions. Then when you get the ball
j on offense, you can substitute for
[ that man again on offense without
waiting for the four-minute limit."
Taylor also feels that the new
"tackle eligible" rule has a lot of
merit. This rule states that any line
man will be eligible to receive a
forward pass if he lines up on the
end of a line and none of his team
mates takes up a position closer to
the sidelines than he, regardless of
how far behind the line of scrim
mage the other player may be.
"It's good they straightened this
out," Taylor commented, "because
it is so hard for an official to tell
if a man is eligible for a pass or
not, since they all line up so close
before the snap, only about a yard
apart."
REDUCE BOXING INJURIES
Boxing coach Lunny has no sug
gestions for changing the rules in
collegiate boxing, but would like to
see lighter gloves used in profes
sional boxing because he feels that
it would cut down the number of
injuries.

"My reason for believing that this
would cut down the number of in
juries is that with very light gloves,
about two ounces, compared to the
five and a half or six ounce gloves
now used in California, fighters who
have absorbed a lot of punishment
will go down sooner and take less
punishment. Freddie Apostoli, for
mer world's lightweight champion,
agrees with me.
"There's no important change I'd
like to see in the collegiate boxing
rules, because I think they are very
good right now. As you know, in
college boxing we use 12 - ounce
gloves, and the bouts consist of three
two-minute rounds. Boxers in col
lege also wear headguards with
.sponge rubber in the back to pro
tect the back of their heads when
they go down."
