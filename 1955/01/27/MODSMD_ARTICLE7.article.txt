# Misalliance Called 'Joy To Behold'
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
Bernard Shaw's "Misalliance"
is at once a comedy of ideas and
a cockeyed comic - book farce;
both are a joy to behold. The
Stanford Players' production,
though decidedly uneasy in the
former and less than expert in
the latter, manages to keep the
fireworks going, and that, after
all, is what counts.
Shaw's talk is brilliant stufT, and
it will act. Only it. doesn't act it
self. It. needs a style and elegance
of diction, a line finish, that in the
present cast only Charles Lyons
(Lord Summcrhays) seems capable
of suggesting.
Lyons has the wit and urbanity at
least to sound as if he were saying
something clever. In a play as
frankly artificial as "Misalliance"
this is half the battle. If his' skill
serves to point up the deficioncy in
this respect of the rest of the cost,
it does, at any rate, give Act I its
best moments.
DOWN TO ACTION
The Players do better when Mr.
Shaw gets down to action. The far
cical acrobatics that in the first act
seem to be desperate (and after all
unnecessary) attempts to pep things
up bccome in the second act a suit
able addition to the general and
glorious inanity of the plot.
Shaw himself sums up the chaotic
situation pretty well: "Wherever
you are, you're there anyhow. Leave
it at that."
Even the continual hoarse bellow
of Lair Parent as Mr. Tarleton,
which is in the first act almost cata
strophic, tends to be absorbed itUo
the general vaudeville atmosphere.
