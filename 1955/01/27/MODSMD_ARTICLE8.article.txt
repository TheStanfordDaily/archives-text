# HYPATIA COMES THROUGH
## 
### 
Judith Doty as Hypatia seems at
first a little high - school - heroine
cute, but she comes through in her
big scencs with a fine audacity and
a fetching set. of mannerisms.
Stephen Mermigis makes of Bent
ly Summerhays an amusing if per
haps overly petulant caricature, and
David Pcnhallow's Gunner, while
never particularly suggestive of a
human being, is always very funny.
Wendell Cole's pink and turquoise
set, incidentally, is a small master
piece of elegant Victorian mon
strosity that never quite falls into
the pit of being what it satirizes.
The Players, in short, make Shaw
move along at a good, if slightly
uneven, clip, and that's all Shaw
needs,
"Misalliance" is a thoroughly sar
donic good time.
