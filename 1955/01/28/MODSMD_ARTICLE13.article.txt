# IN COW PALACE
## Card-USF Tilt Featured In Top Doubleheader Bill Cal, Broncs Also Meet 
### BOB DURAND 
Bay Area basketball will put
its best foot forward tonight and
tomorrow night at San Fran
cisco's Cow Palace when Stan
ford, USF, California, and Santa
Clara mix it up in doubleheaders
which begin at 7:30 in both cases.
The Indians tangle with the Dons
and the Broncos in the last ganv
each night, and vice - versa with
the Bears who play first twice.
However, there's more to the story
than just the playing of four baskot
ball games. By Sunday, several
questions which have been debated
back iuid forth in the Bay Area at;
of recent times should be settled.
DEBATED QUESTIONS
1. Does San Francisco rate the
number two ranking in the count) y
which they have enjoyed during the
past week? Were their convincing

wins over UCLA and Oregon State
and in the Oklahoma City All-Col
lege Tournament really indicative?
2. Will Stanford's Cinderella In
dians continue their rise into the
upper regions of the basketball
world? Will they be able to cope
with the highly touted Dons?
3. Will Santa Clara suddenly blos
som forth into their late - season
surge as they have in the last sev
eral years? Although it is virtually
too late for them to consider any
title hopes, are they in a position to
act the role of spoiler?
4. Will the Golden Bears of Cali
fornia awake from their late hiber
nation and show the local fans that,
their past four games have all been
a bad dream?
5. Will the paying patronage at
the doubleheaders prove to be suffi
cient. to prove that basketball at the
Cow Palace can and will be sup
ported in the future?
INDIVIDUAL CONTESTS
On top of probably getting the
answer to these five questions, those
people attending the games will see
some outstanding indiivdual con
tests.
In the words of Card coach Howie
Dallmar, "Four of the greatest pivot
men in the country wiLl be seen this
weekend." Of course he is referring
to Stanford's Russ Lawler, USF's
Bill Russell, Cal's Bob McKeen, and
Santa Clara's Ken Sears.
Also, the customers will be treat
ed to a battle of the small men. In
dians George Selleck and Ron Tom
hic have been called two of the
best "small" (under six feet) play
ers in the country.
To this category, USF contributes
Hal Perry and Rudy Zannini. Cril
boasts of sophomore sensation Mike
Diaz, and the Broncos have Danny
Ball.
The biggest tilt of the four figure.-?
to be the Indian-Don tussle tonight.


COLOSSAL CENTER —Bill Russell, 6-9 center with the Uni
versity of San Francisco, demonstrates some of the ability which
ranks him as the West Coast's top Ail-American candidate in
his second season of varsity basketball. Russell, who has aver
aged 20 points and 20 rebounds a game this year, is considered
to be even a greater defensive player than an offensive one. He
has a special delight in knocking av/ay opponents shots before
they reach the hoop. Russell possesses a fine left handed spin
jump shot, and a hook with either hand to combine with his tre
mendous jumping and rebounding ability.
The high - ranked Hilltoppers arc
first in the nation in defense by vir
tue of allowing only an average of
48 points per game to their oppo
nents.
On the other hand, coach Dall
mur's quintet currently tops the Pa
cific Coast Conference Southern
Division with .a field L'oal shooting
average of 43 per cent.
FORMULA FOR VICTORY
According to Dallmur, if the Cards
want to up-end USF, they will have
to do three things: stop Russell,
maintain their Ij-igh shooting per
cetnage, and put up a better than
average defense.
The Indian coach also noted that
the bench strengtli of both clubs
was weak and therefore, "a loss of a

first-string player could mean a lot."
He commented that the Dons would
be under "considerably more pres
sure" than Stanford due to their
high ranking.
The Indians will be going with
their "iron five" again for the two
games. Dallmar reports that Law
ler, Selleck, Tomsic, Bill Bond, and
Barry Brown are all in good shape
and rested up after the Hawaii trip.
However, he also stated that re
serves Leo Schwaiger, Carlos Bea,
and Hap Wagner have improved
greatly since the start of the season
and that they will be ready to fill in
if needed.
lhe Hilltoppers' starting quintet
will feature 0-5 Jerry Mullen and
6-3 Stan Buchanan at the forward
spots, Perry and 0-1 K. C. Jones at
the guard slot<, and of course the

! fabled G-10 Russell at center.
This means that the Indians will
j be at a deficit in the height catc
! gory. However, they have been in
j this position before and have come
] out of it without any scratches.
RRONCO OUTLOOK
As far as Santa Clara is con
cerned, the future isn't as bright as
it appeared to them several months
ago, when loyal Broncos were fos
tering hopes that their cagers would
attend the NCAA playoffs for the
third straight year.
Sears at center is the only air
tight position on the Bronco squad.
The Cat is currently averaging 18
points per contest, including a 39-
marker outburst in the COP game
to break the CBA record.
Aside from him, coach Bob Fee
rick is having trouble. First-string
| forward Dick Simoni will probably
S be out of action due to a sprained
I ankle incurred in practice on Wed-
I nesday, and second - string center
j Ted Switzler recently quit the
I squad.

aged 20 points and 20 rebounds a game this year, is considered
to be even a greater defensive player than an offensive one. He
has a special delight in knocking av/ay opponents shots before
they reach the hoop. Russell possesses a fine left handed spin
jump shot, and a hook with either hand to combine with his tre
mendous jumping and rebounding ability.
The high - ranked Hilltoppers arc
first in the nation in defense by vir

48 points per game to their oppo
nents.
On the other hand, coach Dall
mur's quintet currently tops the Pa
cific Coast Conference Southern
Division with .a field L'oal shooting
average of 43 per cent.
FORMULA FOR VICTORY
According to Dallmur, if the Cards
want to up-end USF, they will have
to do three things: stop Russell,
maintain their Ij-igh shooting per
cetnage, and put up a better than
average defense.
The Indian coach also noted that
the bench strengtli of both clubs
was weak and therefore, "a loss of a

first-string player could mean a lot."
He commented that the Dons would
be under "considerably more pres
sure" than Stanford due to their
high ranking.
The Indians will be going with
their "iron five" again for the two
games. Dallmar reports that Law
ler, Selleck, Tomsic, Bill Bond, and
Barry Brown are all in good shape
and rested up after the Hawaii trip.
However, he also stated that re
serves Leo Schwaiger, Carlos Bea,
and Hap Wagner have improved
greatly since the start of the season
and that they will be ready to fill in
if needed.
lhe Hilltoppers' starting quintet
will feature 0-5 Jerry Mullen and
6-3 Stan Buchanan at the forward

This means that the Indians will

RRONCO OUTLOOK
As far as Santa Clara is con
cerned, the future isn't as bright as
it appeared to them several months

attend the NCAA playoffs for the
third straight year.
Sears at center is the only air
tight position on the Bronco squad.
The Cat is currently averaging 18

However, there's more to the story
than just the playing of four baskot
ball games. By Sunday, several
questions which have been debated
back iuid forth in the Bay Area at;
of recent times should be settled.
DEBATED QUESTIONS
1. Does San Francisco rate the
number two ranking in the count) y
which they have enjoyed during the
past week? Were their convincing

wins over UCLA and Oregon State
and in the Oklahoma City All-Col
lege Tournament really indicative?
2. Will Stanford's Cinderella In
dians continue their rise into the
upper regions of the basketball
world? Will they be able to cope
with the highly touted Dons?
3. Will Santa Clara suddenly blos
som forth into their late - season
surge as they have in the last sev
eral years? Although it is virtually
too late for them to consider any
title hopes, are they in a position to
act the role of spoiler?
4. Will the Golden Bears of Cali
fornia awake from their late hiber
nation and show the local fans that,
their past four games have all been
a bad dream?
5. Will the paying patronage at
the doubleheaders prove to be suffi
cient. to prove that basketball at the
Cow Palace can and will be sup
ported in the future?
INDIVIDUAL CONTESTS
On top of probably getting the
answer to these five questions, those
people attending the games will see

questions which have been debated
back iuid forth in the Bay Area at;
of recent times should be settled.
DEBATED QUESTIONS
1. Does San Francisco rate the
number two ranking in the count) y
which they have enjoyed during the
past week? Were their convincing

wins over UCLA and Oregon State
and in the Oklahoma City All-Col
lege Tournament really indicative?
2. Will Stanford's Cinderella In
dians continue their rise into the
upper regions of the basketball
world? Will they be able to cope
with the highly touted Dons?
3. Will Santa Clara suddenly blos
som forth into their late - season
surge as they have in the last sev
eral years? Although it is virtually
too late for them to consider any
title hopes, are they in a position to
act the role of spoiler?
4. Will the Golden Bears of Cali
fornia awake from their late hiber
nation and show the local fans that,
their past four games have all been
a bad dream?
5. Will the paying patronage at
the doubleheaders prove to be suffi
cient. to prove that basketball at the
Cow Palace can and will be sup
ported in the future?
INDIVIDUAL CONTESTS
On top of probably getting the
answer to these five questions, those
people attending the games will see
some outstanding indiivdual con
tests.
In the words of Card coach Howie
Dallmar, "Four of the greatest pivot
men in the country wiLl be seen this
weekend." Of course he is referring
to Stanford's Russ Lawler, USF's
Bill Russell, Cal's Bob McKeen, and
Santa Clara's Ken Sears.
Also, the customers will be treat
ed to a battle of the small men. In
dians George Selleck and Ron Tom
hic have been called two of the
best "small" (under six feet) play
ers in the country.
To this category, USF contributes
Hal Perry and Rudy Zannini. Cril
boasts of sophomore sensation Mike
Diaz, and the Broncos have Danny
Ball.
The biggest tilt of the four figure.-?
to be the Indian-Don tussle tonight.


COLOSSAL CENTER —Bill Russell, 6-9 center with the Uni
versity of San Francisco, demonstrates some of the ability which
ranks him as the West Coast's top Ail-American candidate in
his second season of varsity basketball. Russell, who has aver
aged 20 points and 20 rebounds a game this year, is considered
to be even a greater defensive player than an offensive one. He
has a special delight in knocking av/ay opponents shots before
they reach the hoop. Russell possesses a fine left handed spin
jump shot, and a hook with either hand to combine with his tre
mendous jumping and rebounding ability.
The high - ranked Hilltoppers arc
first in the nation in defense by vir
tue of allowing only an average of
48 points per game to their oppo
nents.
On the other hand, coach Dall
mur's quintet currently tops the Pa
cific Coast Conference Southern
Division with .a field L'oal shooting
average of 43 per cent.
FORMULA FOR VICTORY
According to Dallmur, if the Cards
want to up-end USF, they will have
to do three things: stop Russell,
maintain their Ij-igh shooting per
cetnage, and put up a better than
average defense.
The Indian coach also noted that
the bench strengtli of both clubs
was weak and therefore, "a loss of a

first-string player could mean a lot."
He commented that the Dons would
be under "considerably more pres
sure" than Stanford due to their
high ranking.
The Indians will be going with
their "iron five" again for the two
games. Dallmar reports that Law
ler, Selleck, Tomsic, Bill Bond, and
Barry Brown are all in good shape
and rested up after the Hawaii trip.
However, he also stated that re
serves Leo Schwaiger, Carlos Bea,
and Hap Wagner have improved
greatly since the start of the season
and that they will be ready to fill in
if needed.
lhe Hilltoppers' starting quintet
will feature 0-5 Jerry Mullen and
6-3 Stan Buchanan at the forward
spots, Perry and 0-1 K. C. Jones at
the guard slot<, and of course the

! fabled G-10 Russell at center.
This means that the Indians will
j be at a deficit in the height catc
! gory. However, they have been in
j this position before and have come
] out of it without any scratches.
RRONCO OUTLOOK
As far as Santa Clara is con
cerned, the future isn't as bright as
it appeared to them several months
ago, when loyal Broncos were fos
tering hopes that their cagers would
attend the NCAA playoffs for the
third straight year.
Sears at center is the only air
tight position on the Bronco squad.
The Cat is currently averaging 18
points per contest, including a 39-
marker outburst in the COP game
to break the CBA record.
Aside from him, coach Bob Fee
rick is having trouble. First-string
