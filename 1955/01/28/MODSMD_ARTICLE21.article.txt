# An Unbroken Line
## 
### 
Here it is, another last editorial from another
retiring editor. Time has winged its v/ay
Ihrough four months and now snaps Shut the
cover for Volume 126 of the Daily.
For you, Dick, and for those who will work
with you on Volume 127, time is offering a
"fresh start." For you this moment is a be
ginning. For you time has reserved another
four-month stretch.
t h:nd you lie traditions and influences
and periences which transcend the paper
thin divisions in time we call "volumes."
For the Daily is not a series of isolated papers
or gioups of papers. One staff blends into an
other. Ideas and perspective develop in an
unbroken, unending line.
And through the news and editorial columns
of the Daily, these ideas and perspectives exert
an influence on the lives of over 7,000 persons.
The type of influence, and the extent to which
it is lasting, depends on each of you who work
on the Daily. It rests with the reporter who gets
the dates for ticket sales correct —or incorrect.
It lies with the edit board member who writes

an informed, intelligent editorial —or a sloppy
one.
Every word that goes into each morning's
Daily— or is left out —will have an effect on
some segment of the Stanford community.
To you who will be putting out Volume 127
and the volumes to follow, I ask only this:
Weigh the real significance of what appears
in the Daily, not by personal prejudice, but by
its importance and possible influence on
readers.
Balance the local with the national and inter
national news, remembering always that the
Stanford student is a Stanford student only
temporarily, but a citizen of the world com
munity for his entire life.
Balance the humor and light features with the
informative interviews and reasoned editorials,
remembering always that the primary purpose
of a university is to inform and to make persons
think.
Bear in mind the purpose for which you are
writing, the goals for which you are aiming,
and the Daily will serve its purpose.
The very best of luck to each of you. —Pat.
