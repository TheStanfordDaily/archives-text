### RIC TEAGUE 
Mr. Clarence I. Lewis is one of America's most
highly thought of philosophers. He is also a lecturer
in philosophy here. 1 have an informant in his class.
Wednesday, Mr. Lewis came up with one of the great -
est syllogisms over voiced by man.
"The cow jumped over the moon," said Mr. C. I.
Lewis, "and therefore, animals can live in outer space."
Now, the value of this sort of lecturing may be ob
scure to some but not to this correspondent. What
other criteria have we? Where else in literature can
you find an accurate account of an animal's trip be
yond the lunar orbit?
OI course, there is the possibility that the story of
the cow jumping over the moon may be untrue. If
so, it is certainly the first science fiction to which a
child is exposed in early life. More of this cow later.
I am taking a course in the study of sociology. A
science, they say. Well, sir, I am having considerable
difficulty understanding some of the terms they use.
Or, as the sociologist might say, I am experiencing
certain difficulties in comprehending the anticipatory
symbols, expressive symbols, and arbitrary symbols
of symbolic communication as are employed in the
.synthesizing and generalizing of man in all of his re
lationships.
This is a real problem. The story of the cow jump-

ing over the moon, if it were found in a sociology
text, would probably be written something like this:
Heigh diddle diddle (a "nonsense phrase" occurring
predominantly in the folkways as they pertain to
early childhood), the feline carnivorous quadruped
(felis domestica) in a primary relationship with a
fiddle; the mature female of domestic cattle ofj the
genus (Hus) elevated herself without the benefit of
extraneous help until she was able to transcend the
earth's lunar sattelite. The immature canine carnivor
our mammal (Canis familiaris) expressed his delight
with laughter and the dish moved at an accellerated
pace away from the scene in the company of a spoon.
Now, you can see that this type of terminology
makes sociology something of a perplexing study. But
it cannot be otherwise. The ethics of the profession
demand that written and spoken words used in the
study and instruction of sociology be couched in al
most insuperable (as the sociologist puts it) phrase
ology. Otherwise sociology might be ycposed as one
colossal head-fake.
As an afterthought it occurs to me that an enter
prising sociology major could make himself quite a
handsome bundle by merely reprinting the standard
texts of the subject in comic book form.

pace away from the scene in the company of a spoon.
Now, you can see that this type of terminology
makes sociology something of a perplexing study. But
it cannot be otherwise. The ethics of the profession
demand that written and spoken words used in the
study and instruction of sociology be couched in al
most insuperable (as the sociologist puts it) phrase
ology. Otherwise sociology might be ycposed as one
colossal head-fake.
As an afterthought it occurs to me that an enter
prising sociology major could make himself quite a
handsome bundle by merely reprinting the standard
texts of the subject in comic book form.
Mr. Clarence I. Lewis is one of America's most
highly thought of philosophers. He is also a lecturer
in philosophy here. 1 have an informant in his class.
Wednesday, Mr. Lewis came up with one of the great -
est syllogisms over voiced by man.
"The cow jumped over the moon," said Mr. C. I.
Lewis, "and therefore, animals can live in outer space."
Now, the value of this sort of lecturing may be ob
scure to some but not to this correspondent. What
other criteria have we? Where else in literature can
you find an accurate account of an animal's trip be
yond the lunar orbit?
OI course, there is the possibility that the story of
the cow jumping over the moon may be untrue. If
so, it is certainly the first science fiction to which a
child is exposed in early life. More of this cow later.
I am taking a course in the study of sociology. A
science, they say. Well, sir, I am having considerable
difficulty understanding some of the terms they use.
Or, as the sociologist might say, I am experiencing
certain difficulties in comprehending the anticipatory
symbols, expressive symbols, and arbitrary symbols
of symbolic communication as are employed in the
.synthesizing and generalizing of man in all of his re
lationships.
This is a real problem. The story of the cow jump-

ing over the moon, if it were found in a sociology
text, would probably be written something like this:
Heigh diddle diddle (a "nonsense phrase" occurring
predominantly in the folkways as they pertain to
early childhood), the feline carnivorous quadruped
(felis domestica) in a primary relationship with a
fiddle; the mature female of domestic cattle ofj the
genus (Hus) elevated herself without the benefit of
extraneous help until she was able to transcend the
earth's lunar sattelite. The immature canine carnivor
our mammal (Canis familiaris) expressed his delight
with laughter and the dish moved at an accellerated
pace away from the scene in the company of a spoon.
