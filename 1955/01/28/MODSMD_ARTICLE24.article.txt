# SPANISH PIANIST
## Soriano to Play Monday 
### STEW TOY 
Gonzalo Soriano, a brilliant
young pianist whom one critic
I called "a Castilian Horowitz,"
will play for the Stanford Con
! cert Series Monday evening in
Memorial Auditorium.
Soriano, at 31, has been acclaimed
as the greatest pianist ¥ to come from
Spain in 25 years. He has aroused
great enthusiasm in France, Italy,
the Netherlands, and Great Britain.
In his first American tour last
year he played with the New York
Philharmonic, the San Francisco
and the Cincinnati symphonies.
Born in Alicante on Spain's Medi
terranean coast, Soriano showed
versatile artistic ability at an early
age, excelling in sculpture, painting,
and music.
His rise to success as a pianist be
gan when an unknown neighbor—
the famous Spanish composer Er
nesta Halffter—overheard the young
musician playing one of his own
compositions, liked his rendition,
and proceeded to assist him in es
tablishing himself as a.concert art
ist.

He was later awarded first prize
in Madrid, and became the friend
in piano at the Royal Conservatory

and protege of Manuel de Falja, who
supervised his work in composition.

Soriano has become famous for
his brilliant and sensitive perform
ances of Scarlatti, Bach, Schumann,
Chopin, and the moderns, but he
also has a distinctive reputation as
an interpreter of Spanish music.
In this field he has given special
lectures and performances at the
Conservatory in Madrid, at the
Summer School for Foreigners in
Segovia, and in England.
Soriano is noted for his technical
skill and interpretive virtuosity—a
combination which gives freshness
and sparkle to his performances.
Irving Kolodin in the Saturday Re
view has called him "a vigorous i
pianist of independent mind."
In his Stanford concert Soriano I
will play Bach's Toccata and Fugue !
in D Minor, three Scarlatti sonatas, !
Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 13,
Mompou's "Tres Canciones y Dan
zas," Beethoven's "Moonlight" So
nata, and "Alborada del Gracioso" j
and selections from "Le Tom beau
de Couperin," both by Ravel.
Tickets are still available and may
be purchased at the Concert Series
office in the Nitery from 1 to 5 p.m.
today and Monday. Prices are $1.25, |
$1.75, $2.25, and $2.75.
