THE TREEHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON
Spring is just around the corner, and with spring, as always,
will come tree-sitting contests. This I applaud. Tree-sitting is
healthful and jolly and as American as apple pie. Also it keeps
you off the streets.
Tree-sitting is not, however, without its hazards, as you will
presently see when 1 tell you the dread and chilling tale of
Manuel Sigafoos and Ed Pancreas.
Manuel and Ed, friends and room-mates, were walking one day
past the folk music room in the School of Dentistry and Fine
Arts. Suddenly they stopped, for coming through the door of
the folk music room was a clear and thrilling alto voice singing
the lovely folk tune, I Strangled My True-Love with Her Own
Yellow Braids, and I'll Never Eal Her Sorghum Any More.
When the last shimmering notes of the ballad had died away,
Manuel and Ed rushed into the room, and there they thought
their swelling hearts must hurst asunder. For the singer was as
beautiful as the song! Fair as the morn she was, doe-eyed and
curvilinear.
"My name is Manuel Sigafoos," cried Manuel Sigafoos, "and
I love you madly, wildly, tempestuously!"
"My name is Ed Pancreas," cried Ed Pancreas, "and 1 love
you more than Manuel Sigafoos."
"My name is Ursula Thing," cried the girl, "and I've got
a jim-dandy idea. Why don't you two have a contest, and I will
go steady with the winner?"
"What kind of contest?" cried Manuel and Ed.
"A tree-sitting contest," cried Ursula Thing. "Natch!"
"Done and done," cried Manuel and Ed, and they clambered
up adjoining aspens, taking with them the following necessaries:
food, water, clothing, medicaments, bedding, reading matter,
and — most essential of all — plenty of Philip Morris cigarettes.
We who live on the ground, with all the attendant advan
tages, know how important Philip Morris cigarettes are. Think,
then, how much more important they must he to the lonely tree
dweller — how much more welcome their vintage tobaccos, how
much more soothing their mild pure flavor, how much more
comforting to know as one sits in leafy solitude that come wind
or weather, come light or dark, Philip Morris will always remain
the same dependable, reliable, flavorful friend.
Well supplied with Philip Morris, our heroes began their contest
- Manuel with good heart, Ed with evil cunning. The shocking
fact is that Ed intended to win the contest with a Machiavellian
ruse. It seems that Ed, quite unbeknownst to Manuel, was one
of three identical triplets. Each night while Manuel dozed on
his bough, one of Ed's brothers - Fred or .Ted-would sneak
up the tree and replace him. Thus Ed was spending only one-third
as much time in the tree as Manuel. "How can I lose?" said Ed
with a crafty giggle to his brother Fred or .Ted.
But Ed had a surprise coming. For Manuel, though he did not
know it himself, was a druid! lie had been abandoned as an
infant at the hut of a poor and humble woodcutter named
Winthrop Mayhew Sigafoos, who had raised the child as his own,
So when Manuel got into the tree, he found to his surprise that
he'd never felt so at home and happy in his life, and he had
absolutely no intention of ever leaving.
After four or five years Ed and his brothers wearied of the
contest and conceded. Ursula Thing came to Manuel's tree and
called him to come down and pin her. He declined. Instead he
asked her to join him in the tree. This she could not do, being
subject to acromegaly (a morbid allergy to woodpeckers) so
she ended up with Ed after all.
Only she made a mistake-a very natural mistake. It was
Jed she ended up with, not Ed.
Ed, heartbroken at being tricked by his own brother, took
up metallurgy to forget.

THE TREEHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON
Spring is just around the corner, and with spring, as always,
will come tree-sitting contests. This I applaud. Tree-sitting is
healthful and jolly and as American as apple pie. Also it keeps
you off the streets.
Tree-sitting is not, however, without its hazards, as you will
presently see when 1 tell you the dread and chilling tale of
Manuel Sigafoos and Ed Pancreas.
Manuel and Ed, friends and room-mates, were walking one day
past the folk music room in the School of Dentistry and Fine
Arts. Suddenly they stopped, for coming through the door of
the folk music room was a clear and thrilling alto voice singing
the lovely folk tune, I Strangled My True-Love with Her Own
Yellow Braids, and I'll Never Eal Her Sorghum Any More.
When the last shimmering notes of the ballad had died away,
Manuel and Ed rushed into the room, and there they thought
their swelling hearts must hurst asunder. For the singer was as
beautiful as the song! Fair as the morn she was, doe-eyed and
curvilinear.
"My name is Manuel Sigafoos," cried Manuel Sigafoos, "and
I love you madly, wildly, tempestuously!"
"My name is Ed Pancreas," cried Ed Pancreas, "and 1 love
you more than Manuel Sigafoos."
"My name is Ursula Thing," cried the girl, "and I've got
a jim-dandy idea. Why don't you two have a contest, and I will
go steady with the winner?"
"What kind of contest?" cried Manuel and Ed.
"A tree-sitting contest," cried Ursula Thing. "Natch!"
"Done and done," cried Manuel and Ed, and they clambered
up adjoining aspens, taking with them the following necessaries:
food, water, clothing, medicaments, bedding, reading matter,
and — most essential of all — plenty of Philip Morris cigarettes.
We who live on the ground, with all the attendant advan
tages, know how important Philip Morris cigarettes are. Think,
then, how much more important they must he to the lonely tree
dweller — how much more welcome their vintage tobaccos, how
much more soothing their mild pure flavor, how much more
comforting to know as one sits in leafy solitude that come wind
or weather, come light or dark, Philip Morris will always remain
the same dependable, reliable, flavorful friend.
Well supplied with Philip Morris, our heroes began their contest
- Manuel with good heart, Ed with evil cunning. The shocking
fact is that Ed intended to win the contest with a Machiavellian
ruse. It seems that Ed, quite unbeknownst to Manuel, was one
of three identical triplets. Each night while Manuel dozed on
his bough, one of Ed's brothers - Fred or .Ted-would sneak
up the tree and replace him. Thus Ed was spending only one-third
as much time in the tree as Manuel. "How can I lose?" said Ed
