# Jag Takes On Ford—Loses
## 
### 
A Jaguar left the Theta Xi drive
way all by itself yesterday noon and
caused plenty of trouble before it
stopped against the Durand House
hedge.
The owner, Nate Topal, had come
humming back home from his 31
o'clock class yesterday with two pas
sengers and had parked at his fav
orite spot on the steep circular drive
way. He had turned the wheels in
to the curb and had applied the
emergency brake, because the hill
has a 45 degree grade and there is a
30-foot embankment directly below
his parking place.
All precaution was to no avail.
One of the three riders kicked loose
the hand brake as he stepped from
the Jag, and as Topal stood by with
books in hand his means of transpor
tation went over the embankment
backwards and crashed into a tele
phone pole bordering the Figi Alley.
The left rear fender was smashed
against the wheel and the force of
the friction against the wheel spun
the car around in the alley.
Susanne Shumaker was driving up
Dolores in her '49 Ford coupe, mind
ing her own business as she gave
two Delts a lift home. She took no
notice of the little car casing out
of the alley.
When she noticed that nobody was
driving she tromped down on the
gas to get around the sports car, but
she was a little too late. The run
away Jag bent in the left rear fender
of the Ford, loosened the bumper,
and then smashed into the Durand
hedge.
Topal estimates the damage to the
Jaguar at $250. Damage's to Miss
Shumaker'* car were minor,
