UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Jan. 27
(UP)â€”Diplomatic sources said to
night that the United Nations Secu
rity Council would be called into
session to debate the China crisis
early next week, possibly Monday.
The course the Council will follow
was not clear and delegates princi
pally concerned were unusually
close-mouthed about it.
