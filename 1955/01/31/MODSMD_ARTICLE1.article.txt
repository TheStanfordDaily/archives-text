# Stanford Splits With USF, SC
## Dons Show Class in Victories Against Stanford, California 
### 
Students at the University of San Francisco are feeling happy
these days. The reason? It seems a gentleman by the name of
Phil Woolpert has taken a bunch of talented fellows and turned
them into one of the country's top basketball teams, i
If anyone wants proof of this, he can ask any of 23,692 fans who

.saw USF defeat Stanford, 76-60, on
Friday or wallop California, 84-62,
Saturday night.
Friday evening, 13,824 cage en
thusiasts—a new Pacific Coast at
tendance record — also saw Santa
Clara knock ofT the Bears in over
time, 66-59, and Saturday in the
fourth game of the weekend series,
0,868 people watched the Indians
come from behind to drop the Bron
cos, 72-67.
It was basketball's big weekend in
the Bay Area. Perhaps the most im
portant item of the weekend was the
fact that the huge crowds should be
very persuasive in the promotion of
top cage billings for the local fans in
the next few years.
Before the weekend, questions
were being raised on whether the
Dons were deserving of their high
(number 2) ranking in the nation.
Most people who saw the games are
now convinced that the Hilltoppers
should be first.
"ALL THE WAY"
Card coach Howie Dallmat* called
the USF five "terrific" and added,
"If they don't suffer any bad breaks,
they could easily go all the way."
The Santa Clarans, meanwhile,
showed signs of breaking into their
famed late-season surge in Friday's
game and the first three quarters of
Saturday's contest. However, the
red Indians would not be done in,
and they managed to stop the Bron
cos' attack in time to salvage the
win.
California proved to be the disap
pointment of the weekend. After
blowing their lead to lose the first
game to the Santa Clarans, the
Bears were completely helpless
against the Dons on Saturday.
DARK HORSE
Stanford's cagers still will remain
in the position of dark horse. Fri
day, thry did lose to a superior
team. However, their shooting per
centage was 30.(i in the tilt com
pared to a seasonal average of 4.'!
per cent.
In the first half of . Saturday's
game, it was the same story again
as the Cards only hit for 2(>.l) per
cent of their shots, but in the sec
ond half they got hot in time to pull
the game out.
CARDS"LOOSE"
Coach DaUmar, in remarking
about the two games, said that the
Indians were "loose" over the week
end. He commented on the fact that
the games were good experience and
that "we should really be ready for
USC next weekend."
As to the USF contest, Dallmar
mentioned that his cagers were hav
ing a hard time getting adjusted to
the play of the Dons and by the
time they got adjusted they were 2U
points behind.
He lauded center Russ Lawler and
guard George Selleck for their play
over the weekend and said that he
was pleased with the work of re
serve Carlos Bca.
The PCC race gets under way
again this weekend, and the next
four weeks are make or break for
the Cards. Presently the Indians art
tied with UCLA for the league lead,
but the schedule favors the Bruins
from here on in, since thgy have
four games left with powerless Cal.
The Tribe will host USC next
weekend in a two-game series, be
fore they hit the Southland for two
games each against the Bruins and
the Trojans over the following two
weekends.
