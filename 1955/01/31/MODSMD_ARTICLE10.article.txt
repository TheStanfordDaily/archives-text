# 'SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR'
## Tiner Hopeful China Issue Will Go to UN 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Despite the propaganda elements of Russia's demand that the
United States and Chinese Nationalist troops leave Formosa, Dr.
Hugh M. Tiner was hopeful that the United Nations would take
up the issue.
Tiner, the president of Pepperdine College in Los Angeles, dis-

cussed the Formosan situation
shortly after his, opening address to
the Western College Conference on
American Foreign Policy yesterday
in Mcmoerial Auditorium.
"We are committed to the U.N. as
an instrument of peace," he said.
"And we should have nothing to fear
about bringing the issue before the
U.N. For my part, I am pleased that
the United Nations may be taking
up the problem."
Tiner was confident that the Unit
ed States position would be well
supported in the U.N. and that the
right and duty of America to pro
tect Formosa and the Pescadores
would be clear.
Tiner said he feared the possibility
of a minor indiscriminate action ex
ploding into a war. But he thought
that President Eisenhower's policy
as documented in the weekend's
Congressional resolution would pre
vent the chance that any indiscrimi
nate action would lie American.
"The salvation," Tiner said, "was
Eisenhower's promise that he would
make the final decision in any situ
ation. I think that makes it safe."
The two-day visit for the Foreign
Policy Conference, Tiner said, is his
first trip to Stanford in "four or
five years." How did he find the
campus where he received his Mas
ter's degree? "A bit wet." He was
particularly impressed, however, by
all the changes which arc being
made.
Tiner will remain on campus to
day, observing the activities of the
conference. Tonight, Tiner will ac
company Harold E. Stasscn, who
will make today's major spccch, to
Los Angeles. Tomorrow Stasscn is
to address the World Affairs Council
in Los Angeles, of which Tiner is a
director.
