### EDA MENDELS 
The Western College Confer
ence on American Foreign
Policy opened yesterday with
an address by Dr. Hugh M. Tiner,
president of Pepperdine Col
lege. He spoke on "American
Leadership and the Communist
Threat."
'The problems of today's world
are not now, but the perils arc. The
times demand a solution to them,"
Tiner suggested.
He outlined some of the facts and
conditions of which American lead
ers, he said, must continually be
aware. The three primary "facts of
life" are the following:
"1. The Communist menace, So
viet imperialism, exists.
"2. A new, emergent nationalism
has arisen. It is revolutionary in
concept, a reaction against all types
of foreign domination.
'"3. The long - slumbering peoples
from underdeveloped areas are de
manding better living conditions and
recognition of their personal dig
nity."
CONDITIONS OF PEACE
Tiner also saw three "conditions
of peace."
"1. The freedom - loving nations
must be strong, economically, indus
trially, spiritually, as well as mili
tarily.
"2. Russia must be convinced that
she cannot divide and conquer.
'3. Europe and Asia must be con
vinced that the United States really
wants peace." Tiner pointed out
that people abroad are not assured
of the Americans' intentions.
"The future does not depend on
the quantity of American dollars,
but on the quality of American lead
ership," Tiner thought. "Western
military strength cannot and will
not solve the real problems; neither
can technical aid. Real victory de
pends on spiritual and psychological
power. The real battle against Com
munism is for the minds of men."
LAUDS 'PARTNERSHIP' IDEA
Tiner lauded President Eisenhow
er's slant of "partnership instead of
leadership" in the United Nations.
"With multi - lateral consultations,
significant strides forward should be
made."
Tiner, as an educator, reflected
that in many respects the American
people now far too little about the
United Nations. "They must know
the purposes, functions, and accom
plishments, and should have faith in
the U.N. It is at present the only
ray of hope in a dark world."
In policy for 1955, Tiner noticed "a
significant emphasis on world eco
nomic development," with technical
development and capital develop
ment.
Tiner was introduced by Dr. I.
James Quillen, dean of the School
of Education.

significant strides forward should be
made."
Tiner, as an educator, reflected
that in many respects the American
people now far too little about the
United Nations. "They must know
the purposes, functions, and accom
plishments, and should have faith in
the U.N. It is at present the only
ray of hope in a dark world."
In policy for 1955, Tiner noticed "a
significant emphasis on world eco
nomic development," with technical
development and capital develop
ment.
Tiner was introduced by Dr. I.
James Quillen, dean of the School
of Education.
The Western College Confer
ence on American Foreign
Policy opened yesterday with
an address by Dr. Hugh M. Tiner,
president of Pepperdine Col
lege. He spoke on "American
Leadership and the Communist
Threat."
'The problems of today's world
are not now, but the perils arc. The
times demand a solution to them,"
Tiner suggested.
He outlined some of the facts and
conditions of which American lead
ers, he said, must continually be
aware. The three primary "facts of
life" are the following:
"1. The Communist menace, So
viet imperialism, exists.
"2. A new, emergent nationalism
has arisen. It is revolutionary in
concept, a reaction against all types
of foreign domination.
'"3. The long - slumbering peoples
from underdeveloped areas are de
manding better living conditions and
recognition of their personal dig
nity."
CONDITIONS OF PEACE
Tiner also saw three "conditions
of peace."
"1. The freedom - loving nations
must be strong, economically, indus
trially, spiritually, as well as mili
tarily.
"2. Russia must be convinced that
she cannot divide and conquer.
'3. Europe and Asia must be con
vinced that the United States really
wants peace." Tiner pointed out
that people abroad are not assured
of the Americans' intentions.
"The future does not depend on
the quantity of American dollars,
but on the quality of American lead
ership," Tiner thought. "Western
military strength cannot and will
not solve the real problems; neither
can technical aid. Real victory de
pends on spiritual and psychological
power. The real battle against Com
munism is for the minds of men."
LAUDS 'PARTNERSHIP' IDEA
Tiner lauded President Eisenhow
er's slant of "partnership instead of
leadership" in the United Nations.
"With multi - lateral consultations,
significant strides forward should be
made."
