### 
With student administrators acting as moderators "Stanford—
Today and Tomorrow" continues its information series here in
three scheduled talks tonight.
Associated Student President Pete Bing is to moderate the
discussion slated for El Campo. They will meet jointly with

women from Mariposa House to
hear Professor Ray N. Faulkner,
acting dean of humanities and sci
enccs, speak on University develop
ment.
At the Beta Theta Pi house Peter
C. Allien is the featured speaker.
Allen, Stanford director of informa
tion and publications, will also
speak on University development in
a discussion to be moderated by Bob
Gable, ASSU student manager. Also
at the meeting will be residents of
Union.
James S. Triolo, associate general
secretary, will give a talk on Stan
ford's present and future develop
ment at the Alpha Kappa Lambda
house. Student moderator will be
Bob Swain, a regular member of
the "Stanford—Today and Tomor
row" steering committee. The other
moderators in tonight's talks are as
sociate members of the group's
steering committee.
Starting time for ail meetings has
been announced as 6:415. Tonight's
discussions are to follow the usual
procedure of those in the past, ac
cording to the series spokesman.
That plan calls for a short talk by
the main speaker on the subject
listed, followed by a question and

answer session with the audience.
After the questioning there is a
short intermission, then a smaller,
informal group discussion with the
night's speaker.
Since last week the program has
been expanded to two nights of dis
cussion a week with three or more
tals a night. Directors of the series
have commented' that in this way
they can better reach as many on
campus as possible, enabling Stan
ford's students to "learn more about
the University and its problems,
present and future," the stated pur
pose of "Stanford—Today and To
morrow."
