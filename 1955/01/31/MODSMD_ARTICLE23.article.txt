# Freidel Plans a Year-long 'Vacation from Roosevelt’
## 
### 
"l'm going to take a vacation
from Roosevelt for a year." This
is the comment Professor Frank
Freidel made on his forthcom
ing trip to Oxford to teach dur
ing the 1955-56 academic year.
Freidel's life over the past I' 2
I years has been involved with a
| study of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
! During the war Freidel taught at
! the University of Maryland, and lie
| heard the President make a speech
i in which he mentioned activities of
the Navy Department in Haiti din
ing World War 1, when Roosevelt
I had served as Assistant Secretary of
| the Navy.
Freidel became interested in do
| ing a monograph on Roosevelt's ea
| reer as Assistant Secretary, and
later he went to the National Ar
| chives and was able to go through
records and talk to "old sea dogs"
who had known the young FDR.
Freidel's interest grew and the mon
ograph grew into a planned six-vol
ume work which bids fair to be
come the contemporary study of
Roosevelt.
TWO VOLUMES PUBLISHED
At present there are two volumes
published and the third is scheduled
{ for release about a year from now.
; Freidel then hopes lor a book every
j two years, meaning that the series
will be complete in I'lo2.
The angular-faced professor says
, that he and his wile are looking for
ward to visiting England, because it
will give them an opportunity to
; show their four children, aged four
to 14, around Europe during Ox

ford's two long vacations.
Ho attended USC on a scholarship;
although he still sports a very col
legiate crew cut, he insists emphati-

cally that it wasn't a "football
scholarship." Asked as to hi.s feel
ing about Stanford versus Southern
California, he replied that he'd rath
er not say.
Freidel attended Porterville High,
where he hated history and thought
of himself as a budding journalist.
While at USC lie was required to
take a course in recent American
history. He said he liked it very
much, and had been a historian ever
since.

He graduated from USC in 11)37
and got his Master's there in 1939.
Freidel moved to Wisconsin lor liis
Ph.D., and then taught at Vassal
Penn State, and Maryland before
going into the Navy in 1945. Freidel
laughingly admits that he never was
on a ship during his military career.
He added, '"The less said about it
the better; I was stationed in Ok
lahoma lor most of my duty.'
After the war, Freidel moved to
the University oi Illinois, where he
was when Stanford lured him west
two years ago. Although lie will be
away this spring and again n< xl
year, the 38-year-old professor, who
is often mistaken fur the reader by
first-time students, will teach hero
this summer and will be back by the
fall of 195G.
NEVER MET ROOSEVELT
Although he never met the man
whose life he is subjecting to such
thorough exploration, Dr. Freidel
has become well acquainted with
many people closely associated with
the lour-term President. He stated
that Eleanor Roosevelt, Frances
Perkins, and others have been of
especially great service, and that
while nobody is allowed into the
Hoover papers at present, the ex-
President has been very helpful in
answering his queries and explain
ing his views on Roosevelt.
Freidel's course, "The Age of lloo
sevelt," which is his specialty, Im
proved immensely popular here at
Stanford. Last year, when it was
first offered, Freidel expected about
25 students ami ordered books ac
cordingly. Oil the first day of class
over 20U showed up to listen to
Freidel's lectures delivered in short
staccato sentences, punctuated with
frequent, wide, benign smiles. The
reception to his course was over
whelming, and his absence during
the next four quarters will be sorely
felt.

NEVER MET ROOSEVELT
Although he never met the man
whose life he is subjecting to such
thorough exploration, Dr. Freidel
has become well acquainted with
many people closely associated with
the lour-term President. He stated
that Eleanor Roosevelt, Frances
Perkins, and others have been of
especially great service, and that
while nobody is allowed into the
Hoover papers at present, the ex-
President has been very helpful in
answering his queries and explain
ing his views on Roosevelt.
Freidel's course, "The Age of lloo
sevelt," which is his specialty, Im
proved immensely popular here at
Stanford. Last year, when it was
first offered, Freidel expected about
25 students ami ordered books ac
cordingly. Oil the first day of class
over 20U showed up to listen to
Freidel's lectures delivered in short
staccato sentences, punctuated with
frequent, wide, benign smiles. The
reception to his course was over
whelming, and his absence during
