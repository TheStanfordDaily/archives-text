# Stanford Loses, 76-60; Wins, 72-67
## Indians Bow 76-60 to Dons 
### BILL WRIGHT 
K. C. Jones of the University of
I Snn Francisco threw in his second
' consecutive two-handed jump shot
! with moments gone in the game
Saturday night in the Cow Palace
j and 'Stanford never caught up. The
| Tribe hustled after the big Dons he
fore bowing, 7(J-00.
After Jones had put USF topside,
4-2, with his buckets, Long Bill
I Russell, the li-10 demon Don center,
| took charge for the next eight
I points, RUssell pumped in a re
j bound, a hook snot, a /ast-break
| lay-in, and two free throw tosses.
Throughout the first half USF all
; but buried the Indians. Although
j Stanford poured in 17 of 20 tries
' from the foul line, the usually
j sharpshooting Card hoopsters ap
i peared to be aiming for hoops other
| than the ones in the Cow Palace.
! Five field goals were made: three by
| Russ Lawler, one by Ron Tomsic
I from the corner, and one by George
Selleck driving.
Stanford's inaccuracy and USF's
j rebound control and tight defense
; left the half-time count at 38-27.
i but the Dons at one stage led 35-10
; before the Tribe rallied.
In the second half Stanford ral
lied some more, cutting the Don
advantage to 10 points. Bill Bond

! found the range with his jump shots
! and Tomsic began to get loose for
j points.
But whenever USF felt the need
1 of points, Jerry Mullen was in the
open to keep the point-spread com
fortable. Russell and Jones also kept
the nets rippling.
USF substituted frequently in the
j second half, but the Don scoring
I was monopolized by Mullen (24
| points), Russell (23), and Jones (17).
For the Indians Tomsic took high
I honors with 16 points. Selleck's nine
i foul tosses boosted his total to 15.
Bill Bond loosened up in the second
I half for 13 points, and Lawler, play
i ing in the shadow — literally —of
j Russell, managed 11 digits on five
field goals and a free throw.

The Braves seek their filth win
of the season tonight against Santa
Rosa JC ;it S:.*!() in the Pavilion.
The lone JV defeat of the year was
suffered at the hands of the Cal
Blues.
Boh Milton and Boh McGrath
will see much action for Coach
George Lynn as will Gunnar
Christiansen, Dave Dunn. Ben
Heirs and Nick Vojvodich.


HEY UP THERE —USF's Bob Russell, 6-10, and Russ Lawler, 6-6,
of Stanford go up toward the Cow Palace roof for a rebound, as
Stanford's Barry Brown stands by. Russell's rebound talent was
a big factor in defeating Stanford 76-60 Friday night, and has
helped to raise USF to second spot in the nation. The Cards
bounced back Saturday night to win over Santa Clara 72-67,
while USF defeated California 76-60 to finish up the twin game
series for the four Bay Area schools. Russell sank 23 points
against the Cards, but was second highest scorer for USF be
hind Jerry Mullin who took top honors with 24. Lawler, con
stantly outreached by Russell, managed only 11 points on five
field goals and a free throw. Tomsic was Card high scorer with

HEY UP THERE —USF's Bob Russell, 6-10, and Russ Lawler, 6-6,
of Stanford go up toward the Cow Palace roof for a rebound, as
Stanford's Barry Brown stands by. Russell's rebound talent was
a big factor in defeating Stanford 76-60 Friday night, and has
helped to raise USF to second spot in the nation. The Cards
bounced back Saturday night to win over Santa Clara 72-67,
while USF defeated California 76-60 to finish up the twin game
series for the four Bay Area schools. Russell sank 23 points
against the Cards, but was second highest scorer for USF be
