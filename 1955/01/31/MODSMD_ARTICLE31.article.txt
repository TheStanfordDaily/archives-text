## 
### 
The Stanford Braves trounced the
Indian frosh 72-41 last Friday after
noon in a game played at the Pavil
ion. The Papooses got ofT to an early
10 point lead, but the JV's quickly
closed the gap and ran away with
j the game.
Most of the damage was done by
Bob Milton and Bob McGrath who
did great work in controlling the
boards against the taller frosh. The
JV's got hot halfway through the
first half and after that the outcome
| of the game was never in doubt.
A pressing defense and Milton,
who was high point man for the day
with 18, kept the Frosh way behind
in the scoring column.
The frosh play the Santa Clara
freshmen and Washington High
School of San Francisco this week
end.
