# WORLD UNIVERSITY SERVICE
## Small Contributions Help 
### BRAD LEONARD 
A little often goes a long way.
The price of two tickets to the
Sunday Flicks is sufficient to
feed a student of Southeast Asia
for three days or to give two
North African students class
room privileges for a year.
Through the World University
; Service, which will be aided by the
Stanford Winter Quarter Charity
Drive starting next Monday, stu
' dents throughout the world are
! given assistance.
WUS is an international organi
zation directed toward three goals.
The first is relief through self
help. The second goal is cultural
j and educational interplay between
university communities through
conferences, study tours, exchanges
of students, and personal contacts.
The third is research which consists
of looking at the problems of indi
vidual universities and helping stu
dents of these universities to solve
their problems.
The scope of WUS aid is inter
national, interdenominational, and
interracial. The only necessary
qualification for aid is need; where
the need is great the amount of aid
will be proportionately larger.

WUS - sponsored educational aid j
for the youth in various undcrprivi- !
leged countries of the world is a
vital weapon lor the prevention of
war and the easing of much of the
present - day international tension.
Students in the European and Asi
atic countries aided by WUS arc a
powerful force against Communist
aggression, for the education they '
receive enables them to step into
many of the high positions in their
governments immediately after their
graduation.
NOT CHARITY
WUS relief is not charity as is
commonly understood by the term.
Charity implies complete depend
ence on the donor by the recipient,
but WUS attempts to foster inde
pendence on the part of the groups
it aids, giving them just enough help
to achieve this end.
An example of this policy was the
WUS system which existed in post
war Czcchoslovaia. There were no ;
university buildings; homes were;
destroyed; there was a shortage of
warm clothing; books were unob
tainable.
Czech students at the university

in Prague organized and requested
WUS aid. It would have taken mil
lions to have actually gotten the
university under way, and since
WUS has only a limited budget it
was impossible to send more than
$10,000.
The students used this money to
buy mimeograph machines with
which to make their own books.
Within a few months they were sell
ing these books and using the mon
ey for an extensive rebuilding pro
gram. Within a year they had in
creased their original ten thousand
to a million dollars, and by the end
of three years they had enough to
complete the main building of the
university.
This is the sort of thing that WUS
does for students al! over the world.
This is the sort of organization
whose work will be aided in the
Winter Quarter Charity Drive.
