# Adenauer to Push Early Ratification
## 
### 
BONN, Jan. 30 (UP)â€”Chancellor
Konrad Adenauer set out today to
win final ratification of the German
rearmament treaties by the Bonn
parliament within 30 days.
The 79-year-old chancellor took
personal command of the campaign
to push the Paris pacts through the
West German parliament. Carrying
the campaign into its crucial phase,
he set these basic conditions:
1. The West must refuse any
thought of East - V/cst talks with
Russia until the treaties are ratified.
2. As soon as ratification is com
plete, the West should approach the
Soviets to confer on the unification
of Germany.
