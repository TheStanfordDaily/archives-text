# Stassen: Aid To Asia Vital
## 
### EDA MENDELS Economic aid to Asia was the 
main topic of questions asked of
Harold Stassen after the lunch
given in his honor yesterday in
Union Dining Room. The lunch
eon was presented by the Insti
tute of International Relations.
"The center of gravity of the Am
erican foreign aid program has
shifted." hr saiH. Whereas in 1952
Asia received 12 percent of all U.S.
foreign aid funds, now, two years
later, Asia gets 60 percent.
The reasons for this shift are two
fold, Stassen pointed out. "In essence
the job in Europe is accomplished.
Europe is on its feet. Now Asia is in
a state of tension. There the need
is greater.
"The Asian aid program will be
very different in character from the
Marshall Plan, halfway between it
and the Point Four program. It lias
a reasonably good chance of getting
through Congress."
The essential difference between
the Asian and European programs
lies in the backgrounds on which
they could be built. In Europe it
was a costly but fast rebuilding. "In
Asia we must establish sonfiething
that was never <here. It will take a
longer time." Stassen said.
Aid to Asia may be furthered
through university contracts. At
present 53 American universities
liave such contracts, as Stanford has
with. >he University of the Philip
pines, he added.
Stassen praised the "type of sig
nificant, thought-provoking interna
| tional relations activities carried on
at Stanford." He expressed his pleas
| lire at, participating in such "con-
I structive endeavor."
I In a press conforence after his
j speech, Stassen said he was "pleased"
j with the interest shown at. Stanford
in foreign scholarship programs. "I
j look for gradual expansion of pro-
I grams in the future."
j In answer to a question, Stassen
j -aid he would not be a candidate
i for vice-president because he felt
i that the same ticket of Eisenhower
and Nixon should be drafted in 1956.
