### HELEN DEWAR 
Foreign Operations Director
Harold E. Stassen, delivering
the keynote address before ti ">
Western College Conference on
American Foreign Policy yes! r
day, hailed President Eisenhc v
er's policy as one "by whi< !;,
through partnership, we are ry
ating the propelling forces for
progress."
He emphasized the fact that the
administration's foreign and donn
tic policy are completely int i
woven. "The entire collective ;ecu
rity concept of strength would 1 ■
seriously crippled were America not
strong and pro&perous at home. A
unity of weakness can be jut .
dangerous as no unity at all."
POLICY OF PARTNERSHIP
The FOA Director chalkcd up two
advantages for the free world enu<
nating from the United States, on<
being Eisenhower's "deep, sense ol
responsibility for human needs atH
his awareness of the dignity <">f
man," and the other being the aft -
ministration's contribution to out
economic shot-in-the-arm
H>re, hf said, we have played and
mufit continue playing the "effeeti •
role of a good partner to our friend:
abroad," generating a rising confi
dence and optimism among our a! •
lies.
Already in Asia, he reported th
"people are not listening quite as
credulously to the hollow cries
'colonialism'," and in Europe he citf '
economic build-up and contribution
to the free world's defense.
WESTERN DEFENSE
"In just one 12-month period, fo
cal year 1953, Western European
countries contributed over $13 bil
lion for defense—more than the en
tire cost of the Marshall Plan which
covered a three-year span."
In opening his address, Stassen
offered three bits of advice to the
American people: (1) that they keep
calm in the face of world conflicts.
(2) that they remain courageous,
and (3) that they remain confident
of the President's leadership despite
a "chorus of dissent and question
ing."
Reflecting this confidence in the
President, Stassen laughingly re
jected the idea posed to him during
a question program following his
speech that he might be a Presiden
tial candidate if Eisenhower dor
not choose to run."The interests of
the United States," he said, "clear!-;
require that he be drafted and
elected again."
ATOM POOL
In regard to what Stassen thmkr
may be the important question of
the day — Eisenhower's propos i
atom pool, he sees "slow, caution
but steady progress" in that Ru- >
once refusing any part of the pro
posal, is now working along ide th'
West in negotiations at Geneva
To the question asked him of th«
effect of the firing of agricultural
expert Wolf Ladejinsky, < n i
marked that the FOA's decision t"
employ Ladejinskv has elevated
Asian estimation of American for
eign policy.

Foreign Operations Director
Harold E. Stassen, delivering
the keynote address before ti ">
Western College Conference on
American Foreign Policy yes! r
day, hailed President Eisenhc v
er's policy as one "by whi< !;,
through partnership, we are ry
ating the propelling forces for
progress."
He emphasized the fact that the
administration's foreign and donn
tic policy are completely int i
woven. "The entire collective ;ecu
rity concept of strength would 1 ■
seriously crippled were America not
strong and pro&perous at home. A
unity of weakness can be jut .
dangerous as no unity at all."
POLICY OF PARTNERSHIP
The FOA Director chalkcd up two
advantages for the free world enu<
nating from the United States, on<
being Eisenhower's "deep, sense ol
responsibility for human needs atH
his awareness of the dignity <">f
man," and the other being the aft -
ministration's contribution to out
economic shot-in-the-arm
H>re, hf said, we have played and
mufit continue playing the "effeeti •
role of a good partner to our friend:
abroad," generating a rising confi
dence and optimism among our a! •
lies.
Already in Asia, he reported th
"people are not listening quite as
credulously to the hollow cries
'colonialism'," and in Europe he citf '
economic build-up and contribution
to the free world's defense.
WESTERN DEFENSE
"In just one 12-month period, fo
cal year 1953, Western European
countries contributed over $13 bil
lion for defense—more than the en
tire cost of the Marshall Plan which
covered a three-year span."
In opening his address, Stassen
offered three bits of advice to the
American people: (1) that they keep
calm in the face of world conflicts.
(2) that they remain courageous,
and (3) that they remain confident
of the President's leadership despite
a "chorus of dissent and question
ing."
Reflecting this confidence in the
President, Stassen laughingly re
jected the idea posed to him during
a question program following his
speech that he might be a Presiden
tial candidate if Eisenhower dor
not choose to run."The interests of
the United States," he said, "clear!-;
require that he be drafted and
elected again."
