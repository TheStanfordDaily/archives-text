If you've been driving a car around campus
lately, you probably discovered that it is hard to
find a place to park. You probably wondered
where all those cars were coming from, and
wished someone would do something about it.
Well, the University of Colorado has the same
problem, but the Colorado Daily reports that
they have the solution (they think). Their vers
ion of Excom decided to recommend to the
Board of Regents the restriction of all freshman
cars from the campus area.
The paper conducted a poll among the af
fected members of Colorado's class of '58 and
found them most unhappy. A student from Cali
fornia announced: "Where I go, so goes my
car." Another one from Texas, (where there is
plenty of room for parking) moaned "I'm not
used to walking. I don't think I could do it."
The University of Cincinnati complains of
the same difficulty, but they took another tack
in solving the problem. Namely, a two-dollar
fine for all violations, which they add to a fund
for undergraduate scholarships. The University
Dean announced in the campus paper that seven
Si 50 scholarships had been awarded from the
collection of parking penalties and that viola
tions were decreasing in number.

Speaking of Texas and their room for park
ing, some of their space was taken up recently,
when the largest state in the Union acquired
the largest bass drum in the world.
Known as "Big Bertha," this object of the
University of Texas' affections has gone through
many a harrowing experience, from being stuck
in an underpass to becoming radioactive, when
she was housed in a basement where atomic
tests were being carried out.
However, Bertha now has a home and will
soon appear with the Texas band. Since she is
too big to be carried, Texas will soon be able to
boast of having the only bass drum in the
world to be pulled by mechanical devices.
"She may be trouble," said the Daily Texan,
"but we love every one of her 96 inches in
diameter and 44 inches in width."

The University of Washington isn't consid
ering such things as what to do with cars or
drums, however. They are hunting words and
they just found a new one. "Are you myristi
civorcus?" they ask. •
You won't find it in the dictionary but if
you're curious, it means "feeding upon nut
megs!"

The paper conducted a poll among the af
fected members of Colorado's class of '58 and
found them most unhappy. A student from Cali
fornia announced: "Where I go, so goes my
car." Another one from Texas, (where there is
plenty of room for parking) moaned "I'm not
used to walking. I don't think I could do it."
The University of Cincinnati complains of
the same difficulty, but they took another tack
in solving the problem. Namely, a two-dollar
fine for all violations, which they add to a fund
for undergraduate scholarships. The University
Dean announced in the campus paper that seven
Si 50 scholarships had been awarded from the
collection of parking penalties and that viola
tions were decreasing in number.

Speaking of Texas and their room for park
ing, some of their space was taken up recently,
when the largest state in the Union acquired
the largest bass drum in the world.
Known as "Big Bertha," this object of the
University of Texas' affections has gone through
many a harrowing experience, from being stuck
in an underpass to becoming radioactive, when
she was housed in a basement where atomic
tests were being carried out.
However, Bertha now has a home and will
soon appear with the Texas band. Since she is
too big to be carried, Texas will soon be able to
boast of having the only bass drum in the
world to be pulled by mechanical devices.
"She may be trouble," said the Daily Texan,
"but we love every one of her 96 inches in
diameter and 44 inches in width."

The University of Washington isn't consid
ering such things as what to do with cars or
drums, however. They are hunting words and
they just found a new one. "Are you myristi
civorcus?" they ask. •
You won't find it in the dictionary but if
you're curious, it means "feeding upon nut
megs!"

If you've been driving a car around campus
lately, you probably discovered that it is hard to
find a place to park. You probably wondered
where all those cars were coming from, and
wished someone would do something about it.
Well, the University of Colorado has the same
problem, but the Colorado Daily reports that
they have the solution (they think). Their vers
ion of Excom decided to recommend to the
Board of Regents the restriction of all freshman
cars from the campus area.
