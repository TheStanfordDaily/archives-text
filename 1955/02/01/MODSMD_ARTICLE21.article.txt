Just picked up the latest issue of "Sports
Illustrated," the one with the ski doll on the
outside and the "sports" on the inside.
This mag is amazing; pretty babes on front
cover, classy smokes on back, and in-between
what the editors call "sports."
Real on the inside featuring a lady
pool "hdik:, the latest fashion in fox hunting,
voodoo goings-on in Haiti, and a warning that
American rifle shooters better "get off their
bellies" or those dirty guys from Russia may
beat them out for the world's shooting title. In
this last bit the author says "we told you so,"
referring to Si's warning of last October, in what
the mag calls a "memorable article," that the
Kremlin is threatening American track supe
riority. And what are you waiting for, Mr.
Dulles?
Then there's that jim-dandy "sports", article,
"Oh, Sad, Sad Groundhog Day." Only last
year's story on boomerang throwing tops this
one for "sports" thrills.
But SI isn't satisfied with mere "sports" cov
erage. They are crusaders a la Willie Hearst.
Not only must we rise up and beat down the
Soviet belly floppers, but also those raunchy
little gangsters in boxing who are making the
.fight game such a feelthy racket. Obviously
they're all crooks; the photos SI has dug up
prove that. Every fight promoter must look like
A 1 Capone—big black cigar, big fat tummy.

In a basketball section SI picks the leading
players in the nation by photo. A great cross
section; one hocpster from west of the Mis
sissippi—Bob McKeen. Tomsic, Russell. Sears?
Who they?
Best offering in the mag is the 19th Hole. Get
that sporty title. This is the letters to the editor
feature, and some of the notes are gems. Seems
a few readers don't consider bull fighting (a
recent story) or the latest fhing in Fifth Avenue
fashions (a regular "must" for all real "sports")
as from "this wonderful world of sport."
Amen.
Guess I'm of the old school, but I thought
sports was a competitive thing. Thing called
athletics.
However, I'd be content to overlook this mis
representation of the sacred world of sports if
Si's editors would quit foolin' and label their
mag "SPECTATOR SPORTS AND FASHIONS
Illustrated." Even if their average reader can't
have any contact with yachting or Jaguar rac
ing (more "sport" articles appearing recently),
or afford a dashing red coat for his fox hunts,
he may get a vicarious kick out of seeing how
the other half lives, the so-called "sportsmen,"
who have as much in common with athletes
and real sports as Parliaments have with Bull
Durham.
I prefer to roll my own.

one for "sports" thrills.
But SI isn't satisfied with mere "sports" cov
erage. They are crusaders a la Willie Hearst.
Not only must we rise up and beat down the
Soviet belly floppers, but also those raunchy
little gangsters in boxing who are making the
.fight game such a feelthy racket. Obviously
they're all crooks; the photos SI has dug up
prove that. Every fight promoter must look like
A 1 Capone—big black cigar, big fat tummy.

In a basketball section SI picks the leading
players in the nation by photo. A great cross
section; one hocpster from west of the Mis
sissippi—Bob McKeen. Tomsic, Russell. Sears?
Who they?
Best offering in the mag is the 19th Hole. Get
that sporty title. This is the letters to the editor
feature, and some of the notes are gems. Seems
a few readers don't consider bull fighting (a
recent story) or the latest fhing in Fifth Avenue
fashions (a regular "must" for all real "sports")
as from "this wonderful world of sport."
Amen.
Guess I'm of the old school, but I thought
sports was a competitive thing. Thing called
athletics.
However, I'd be content to overlook this mis
representation of the sacred world of sports if
Si's editors would quit foolin' and label their
mag "SPECTATOR SPORTS AND FASHIONS
Illustrated." Even if their average reader can't
have any contact with yachting or Jaguar rac
ing (more "sport" articles appearing recently),
or afford a dashing red coat for his fox hunts,
he may get a vicarious kick out of seeing how
the other half lives, the so-called "sportsmen,"
who have as much in common with athletes
and real sports as Parliaments have with Bull
Durham.
I prefer to roll my own.
Just picked up the latest issue of "Sports
Illustrated," the one with the ski doll on the
outside and the "sports" on the inside.
This mag is amazing; pretty babes on front
cover, classy smokes on back, and in-between
what the editors call "sports."
Real on the inside featuring a lady
pool "hdik:, the latest fashion in fox hunting,
voodoo goings-on in Haiti, and a warning that
American rifle shooters better "get off their
bellies" or those dirty guys from Russia may
beat them out for the world's shooting title. In
this last bit the author says "we told you so,"
referring to Si's warning of last October, in what
the mag calls a "memorable article," that the
Kremlin is threatening American track supe
riority. And what are you waiting for, Mr.
Dulles?
Then there's that jim-dandy "sports", article,
"Oh, Sad, Sad Groundhog Day." Only last
year's story on boomerang throwing tops this
one for "sports" thrills.
