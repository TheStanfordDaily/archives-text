# Stegner Creates His Fiction For 'Self-Understanding'
## 
### BARRY ANDERSON 
(Editor's note: This is an inter- j
view with Dr. Wallace Stegner,
head of the Creative Writing De
partment. Dr. Stegner has written
several ixioks, of which his "Ke
memhe ing Laughter" won the |
Little, Brown Novelette Prize in
19.\'7. His most recent hook, "Be- \
yond the Hundredth Meridian," [
has won wide acclaim. This is the
second in a series of Daily inter- \
views with faculty members.)

Dr. Stegner reacted with a
smile, then his face sobered and
he sank back in his chair.
"Why do I write? I don't know
how well I can answer that ques
tion, but I'll try." He paused to
think. His generous, masculine
face relaxed as he sought an an
swer.
"Well, 1 suppose you could say I
write for myself ... to understand
my.-;elf and the world I came from.
I grew up in Saskatchewan —the last
homestead frontier, the last buffalo
range, the last region to reach the
end of an era. My home was an
anachronism, and because of that
•I've lived in the West through vir
tually 100 years of its growth, from
the time buffalo roamed over un
turned sod to today and the dust
bowl.
• "As a consequence, much of my
writing has been concerned with the
West and its history: 'Mormon
Country,' 'The Big Rock Candy
Mountain,' and the Powell book.

The book I'm working on now is an
attempt to understand the develop
ment of local character in the West
by showing how a physically distinct
local type has evolved in each of
three Western cities. 1 can't tell you
much more than that because right
now it's still just a batch of notes
to me.
VALUE 01 HISTORY
"I believe there is a lot to be
learned from the past, but I don't
value history for itself. I value it
only for what it can teach me about
myself and my surroundings — I
never have cared much for Greek
history.
"But that's not telling you why I
write." He paused to reorient his
thoughts.
"Writing and teaching afford the
freest life I know. A writer is re
sponsible to no one but himself—
although that is no small responsi
bility—and teaching provides the in
tellectually free environment of a
university. I feel at home among
the people around a university.
"I write because nothing gives me
more satisfaction. I know of no
other craft that offers such pride of
achievement, such thrill of creation.
Quite often people have come to me
who were dissatisfied with their
present work and who have since
found satisfaction in writing.
"You've heard Aesop's fable about

the two frogs in the dish of milk?
"Well, there wore two frogs in a
'dish* of milk. One tried to climb up
the side and got out, while the other
just kept swimming around in the
milk. The first frog couldn't get out
because the sides were loo slippery,
so he gave up and died. The second
frog swam around until he had
made a pile of butter high enough
to let him climb out. That's about
the way it is with creative writing.
"My writing has always been an
attempt to create something signifi
cant from experience by patterning
it into a meaningful whole, or by
interpreting and syAthesizing those
patterns that give it meaning. 1 find
that fiction and non-fiction serve my
purpose equally well, although 1
like fiction better, when it's well
done.
A REALIST
"But even when I write fiction, 1
don't depart far from experience;
my characters are people I know,
and the places are real places. II
you want a cubbyhole to put me in,
1 guess you can call mo a realist."
"I hope that I've answered your
question," he said, then in summary,
"I write to understand myself, the
people of the West and the West
itself. I enjoy writing because il is
the freest and most satisfying oeu
pation I know.
"Knowing yourself is sufficient life
work."
