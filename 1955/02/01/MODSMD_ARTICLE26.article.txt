# Miller Writes Religious Book
## 
### 
Alexander Miller, lecturer in re
ligion, is the author of a new book
published by Doubleday and Com
pany as the first volume in a pro
jected Christian Faith Series.'
Miller's "The Renewal of Man"
will be followed by four books by
other noted religious authorities.
Reinhold Niebuhr, nationally known
theologian and consulting editor for
the series, has written the introduc
tion.
The Stanford author subtitles his
book "a 20th century essay on jus
tification by faith." In it he outlines
in contemporary terms fundamental
Biblical doctrines, contrasted with
various religious and anti-religious
viewpoints.
In his discussion of 20th century
man's religious dilemma, Miller ex
amines types of solutions, from
Asian spirituality to Marxism. He
points out the differences not only
among these beliefs, but also among
theological tenets in Christian
thought.
He relates the doctrine of "salva
tion by grace" to such crucial areas
of modern life as the problems of
ethics and political responsibility
and the life of the mind.
