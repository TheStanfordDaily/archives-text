AMAZING BLOCK—George Selleck prepares for what appears
to be an easy lay-up in Friday night's Stanford-USF game. The
shot was blocked, however, in an amazing jump by Bill Russell,
USF junior center. Following Russell down the floor is Stan
Buchanan, Don forward. Selleck had made a clean theft of the
ball from the USF guards before driving for the lay-up. This
block was one of about 8 which Russell made during the tilt.
