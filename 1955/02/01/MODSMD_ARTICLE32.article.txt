# Bob Seeds Faces Victory In Stern 'War of the Wings'
## 
### MIKE McGINNIS 
Stern 4's hoopmcn held the edge
all the way last night when they
beat Stern 3, 36-22, in the "war be
tween the wings."
The Pavilion game was quickly
swayed in 4's favor under the sharp
shooting of Bob Seeds (11 points),
A1 Ames (8), and Ken Townsend
(7).
Loose bnll handling and poor

shooting marked the first half for
both teams. With four minutes to go
before the half, Stern 4 broke the
lethargy with four baskets off the
shooting of Townsend and Seeds to
end the first period 15-10.
Stern 4 continued their flurry of
baskets in the second period, and
the score stood 24-12 after eight
minutes of play in the half. Stern
3 lost the ball often under the bas
ket. Seeds' lay-up talent netted
eight points for Stern 4 in the sec
ond half, and Ames was close be
hind with six mark-ups.
Much sharper shooting and tight
ball control characterized the Stern
4 squad in the second half.
