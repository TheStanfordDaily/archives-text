(Editor's note: This is the second in a series of articles dealing with the
lilies in various shorts and what Stanford coach*s ami other Farm alh
lctic officials think of them. The coaches were asked to comment on the
rules in their particular sport and also make any suggestions for chang
ing or improving them. Today'* article deals with Howie Dallmar. head
basketball coach.)

"I don't see any solution for the bonus foul rule," Howie Dallmar,
head basketball coach said recently. "But the rulemakers will
probably change it somehow by next year."
Dallmar was discussing the controversial bonus one and one
rule currently used in basketball today. The rule permits a player

to attempt a second free throw if he
makes his first shot. The one and
one rule has raised a storm of pro
tect among college coaches through
out the country, many contending
that it has turned the game into a
foul-shooting contest and has not
cut down fouling any more than last
year.
"I have no particular dislike of
the rule," Dallmar continued (this
puts him in a minority among the
other coaches of the Bay Area who
are unanimously opposed to the bo
nus one and one), "but 1 don't see
any solution for it. Mayfcs the rule
we had last year was better." (Then
a player was allowed a second shot
on his free throw if he missed hi::
first.)

Dallmar also feels that the col
leges will also adopt by next season
a rule which will limit the amount
of time a team can retain possession
of the ball without taking a shot.

''The basket right now is just at
the height that when the ball comes
off the backboard the little guy has
a chance. When you raise the bas
ket, there is more time for the
ball to come ott the backboard and
it puts even greater emphasis or) the
big man."
OFFICIATING
Dallmar also had a few comments
on officiating.
"Actually, there shouldn't be a
problem of officiating," he added.
"The coaches and officials all have
a meeting before the season starts
to standardize the rules and to cre
ate some consistency in their own
league."
"On the problem of officiating, a
lot depends on the kids and how
they play. Some nights the one and
one rule puts a lot of pressure on
the officials and they get panicky.

from the coaches during the gamfe
also affect the officials, who can have
off nights just like a team's star
player," Dallmar concluded.

to take a shot within 24 seconds
after it gets possession of the ball,
otherwise the ball goes over to the
other team,
"I don't think the rule will make
the time as short as 24 or 25 seconds,
though," Dallmar stated, "because
forcing a team to shoot that soon
might hurt tiie caliber of play, as
teams will just be running up and
down the court.
"The rule will probably be to take
a shot within 45 or 50 seconds, which
is a considerable amount of time in
basketball, and I don't think giving
a team that much time to take a
shot at the basket will hurt the
caliber of play."
WIDEN FOUL LANE
Dallmar also feels that the col
leges might also adopt the pro rule
of a 12-foot-wide foul lane. The
rule was adopted* to force the big
man further away from the basket.
"Widening the foul lane is a good
rule," Dallmar said, "but it helps a
team with a zone defense, because
teams are always trying to push in
toward the center, and only the de
fense is allowed in that position.
Fans don't, seem to care for the
zone."
Dallmar doesn't think that the
height of the baskets will be raised
from their present 10 feet to 11 or
12 feet as has been advocated by

"I don't think the rule will make

forcing a team to shoot that soon

Dallmar also feels that the col

of a 12-foot-wide foul lane. The
rule was adopted* to force the big

"Widening the foul lane is a good
rule," Dallmar said, "but it helps a

that it has turned the game into a
foul-shooting contest and has not
