# IBC Monopoly Faces Threat
## 
### 
The Supreme Court yesterday
cleared the way for the government
to press an anti-trust suit against
the International Boxing Club. The
6 to 2 decision left the Justice De
partment free to bring action against
the IBC, its president, James D.
Norris, Arthur M. Wirtz. and the
Madison Square Garden Corpora
tion.
Norris, Wirtz, and the Garden
own 80 per cent of the boxing club.
The government charges that they
have a stranglehold on boxing.
