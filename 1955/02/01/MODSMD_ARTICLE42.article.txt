NEW FACES — Bekins' movers are shown above carrying a
head of Si. Francis into the Stanford museum. The head was
pounded out of copper and the eyes are enamel. This is only
one of the 100 sculptures and mosaics out of the collection of
Beniamino Bufano that are being moved from San Francisco to
the museum and art gallery. —Daily photo by Jay Becker
