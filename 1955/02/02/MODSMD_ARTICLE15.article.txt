# Anti-Communism, War Threat Subjects of Panel Discussion
## U.S. Policy Scrutinized 
### JIM PALMER 
American foreign policy was
subjected to critical but con
structive scrutiny by four Stan
ford foreign students during yes
terday morning's panel session
on "American Anti-Communism
and the Threat of a New War."
Led by moderator A 1 Brouse, pan
elists Luciano Berti of Italy, Nabila
Nouhy of Egypt, Dave Penny of
Australia, and Nico Scholten.s of
Holland discussed the position their
countries and America have assumed
in the fight against Communism.
Berti believed American policy
should move toward lower trade
bairiers, a relaxed immigration pol
icy, and greater economic aid.
Nabila Nouhy urged that the
United States "be on the alert, of
fensively" in order to combat Com
munism, and to be "more positive."
She called for more aid for the Mid
dle East, both economically and mil
itarily.
"'Communism has not yet taken a
strong hold in Egypt. But Egypt it.
faced with disease, ignorance, and
poverty. Fifty per cent of the people
are barely subsisting."
Economic development, she said,
was the best way to eliminate the
conditions. She protested the U.S.
reluctance to extend military aid,
and expressed the need for U.S. as
sistance in the solution of Egypt's
internal problems.
Dave Penny stressed that even
though Australia was "an appendage
of Southeast Asia" it was similar in
attitude to the United States and
England.
He pointed out the disparity in the
American budget between sums al
located for aid (i.e., the Point Four
program) and that for military de
fense. "One is 40 millions and the
other is 40 billions."
Penny asserted that "America can
only justify her strength and lead
ership if she acts through a supra
national organization and defers to
an international body."
Nico Scholtens suggested that
"America should overcome fear of
itself so as to radiate inner strength
to the rest of the world."
"America had better rally itself.
Tt needs a unified policy and sta
bility," he warned. He recommended
relaxation of trade and travel •bar
riers, and cautioned against too
much stress on give-away aid pro
grams.
