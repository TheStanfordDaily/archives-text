# Series-goers Hear Talk on Max Reinhardt

Unity of form, color, movement,
and sound was Max Reinhardt's
greatest contribution to the theater,
according to his former right-hand
man, William Melnitz, in his lecture
at the Tuesday Evening Scries last
night.
He believed that the theater was
a synthesis of many arts — music,
dancing, acting, color—and that one
man must create all of these things.
"Stage art has one soul and one
meaning and that is acting," Rein
hardt once said. "When everyone
connected with the play and every
one in the audience is an actor, the
play has fulfilled its mission."
Another great contribution of
Reinhardt, said Melnitz, was his
ability to play to contemporary au
diences. His foremost desire was
that the play give enjoyment to the
people, "to lift them from their lives
into beauty apd peace."
His ability to play classics as if
they were by contemporary authors
made him a great director of Shake
speare. "At one time or another he
has devoted some time to every play
of Shakcspeai-e." His production of
"A Midsummer Night's Dream" was
his most famous, and he has pro
duced it in about eight different
versions.
He directed plays by Moliere,
Gerta, Acschylus, O'Neill, Gilbert
and Sullivan, and many others.
"He's never done a play he didn't
like," Melnitz said, "but when he
did decide on it, he gave it immeas
urable time and effort."
