# Action, Diplomacy Stressed As Weapons in Cold War
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
A successful end to the Cold War depends primarily on positive
action and diplomacy rather than propaganda methods, althoiigh
a positive propaganda network may bring effective results.
On this general basis, a four-man panel, the second in a series of
panels and discussions in the Western College Conference on

American Foreign Policy, proceeded
to discuss the ramifications of propa
ganda and its effect on the Cold War
yesterday afternoon in Cubberley
Auditorium.
Moderating the discussion was
Paul Lazarsfeld of the Ford Insti
tute of Behavorial Sciences. Partici
pating in the discussion were Dr.
Charles M. Huiten, professor of

Stanford debaters Arliss Barnes
and Jinx Patterson won the Delta
Sigma Klho trophy back for Stan
ford last night in their debate
against students from the Univer
sity of Southern California.
They spoke affirmatively on the
recognition of the Red Chinese
government. The debate with
USC, an annual affair, was pre
sented as a feature of the For
eign Policy Conference.

journalism at the University of Cali
fornia, Dr. Alfred J. De Grazia,
Stanford associate professor of po
litical science, and Dr. Eric C. Bell
quist, professor of oplitical science.
De Grazia proposed that our
propaganda program has two gen
eral aims: (1) the establishment of
the "dignity of man," and (2) the

strengthening of American physical
supremacy whenever it is endanger
ed by the forces of Communism.
"Many neutral powers," he said,
"attribute our failures in policy to a
lack of respect for the dignity of
man."
After the opening of the Korean
War, Dr. Kulten declared, the Unit
ed States embarked on a more posi
tive, less negative and defensive ap
proach to its propaganda program.
Through a new "campaign of truth"
with appropriations for propaganda
tripled, we attempted to give "sub
stantive evidence to the world that
our policies are those of peace."
"Yet our policies and actions must
be in harmony," he emphasized. Re
cently President Eisenhower pointed
out that our policy was that of part
nership and not leadership; that the
Free World "should work together
as evidence of harmony of our as
pirations."
Dr. Bellquist pointed out that
"propaganda does not create popular
sentiment, but merely reinforces
ideas and dispositions."
Asserting that "the best propa
ganda is that of action," he stated
that our policy in regard to the Costa
Rican revolt did more to win Latin
American approval than any other
previous action.
