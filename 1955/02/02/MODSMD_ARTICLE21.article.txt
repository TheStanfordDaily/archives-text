With spring ASSU elections getiing closer all
the time, Excom will sit down io try to settle a
few large questions about the proposed ASSU
constitution revision at its meeting tonight at
7:30 in the Excom Room. Excom wants to be
sure to have the draft constitution ready for the
voters on the spring ballot. The student body
must approve any proposed change to the
ASSU constitution.
Knotty problems right now are the questions
of size of the new legislative body and the
composi 4 ' "n of the proposed cabinet and its re
lation to me legislature. There are two schools
of thought on the question of the legislature.
Those who would like to see a large legislature
argue that it would be more representative,
give more chances for students to participate in
government, and could use a system of commit
tees to help efficiency. The "small-legislature
factions" says that its plan would give more re
sponsibility to members, automatically further
efficiency, and make meetings easier to control.
If Excom gets these points settled tonight,
Bing points out, "they'll be a long way toward
writing their constitution."

Excom is scheduled to vote tonight on a by
law change which would send Head Yell Lead
er Ed Mahoney cartwheeling out of Rally Com
and into Cardinals. Cardinals, Rally Com, and
Mahoney himself all are backing a move to
transfer the Hed Yell Leader from the former
organization to the latter.
They say that the Head Yell Leader's func
tions are closer to Cardinals than to Rally Com,
and they add that in Cardinals he'll be in a po
sition to hear more constructive criticism. Ev
eryone seems to be for it; it will probably go
through in a breeze.

Ann Irvine will be at Excom tonight to give
a progress report on the Honor Code project
her Code Subcommittee is working on. The
Honor Code question is a tough one: everyone
wants a unified policy but no one is sure just
what it should be.
