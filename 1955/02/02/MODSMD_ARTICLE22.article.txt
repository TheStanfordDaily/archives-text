And now, sir, a brief chronicle of last Friday's
Bio 2 lecture.
Mr. Graham Phillips DuShane, Professor of
Biology and speaker of note, regaled an eager
and attentive* audience with an account of an
other biologist who was interested in measur
ing the metabolism of a variety of animals. From
the smallest right on up to the largest. The
smallest was a very small mouse. The largest,
an elephant.
He didn't have too much trouble with the
smaller animals. However, the elephant was a
problem and things came to a pretty pass. For
25 years. That's how long he searched to find
just the right elephant.
First he looked in the zoo. This move was
fruitless because all the zoo elephants were ill
tempered. Probably, according to Mr. DuShane,
v/hy they were behind bars. Next, he tried
circuses.
Circus elephants, it seems, develop a "circus
weave." That is, they all seem to weave from
side to side. This wouldn't do because it raised
their metabolism. They flick their tails and ears,
too. Another complication was the gregarious

ness of the elephant. The gentleman didn't
want the metabolism of two elephants. Or the
metabolism of an elephant and a horse or an
elephant and a dog, for ihat matter. (Elephants
like horses and dogs, as v/ell as other ele
phants.)
Well, sir, as I mentioned, the search for just
the right elephant went on for 25 years. Eventu
ally an elephant (4,000 kilograms worth) was
found.
In Stuyvesant Square in New York.
It's not every day you find elephants in Stuy
vesant Square. Anyway, they took the ele
phant in tow and proceeded with the metab
olism taking.
They built an air tight room for the elephant,
but he was skittish in it. They had to find a
keeper (which they did) to keep him company.
But unless the elephant had straw in there with
him, he became nervous ?.nd dropped rocks on
the keeper. Well, to put your mind at ease,
they finally got the elephant's metabolism. But
Mr. DuShane isn't satisfied, yet. "It would be
ideal if we had a whale."
They won't find one in Stuyvesant Square.
