### BOB DURAND 
"The Americans are immature as can be seen by their Senator,
Joseph McCarthy." Such was the common opinion of the British
people, according to Professor Arnaud Bruce Leavelle of the Po
litical Science Department.
Professor Leavelle, who has 14 years of teaching, two years of

newspaper reporting and several
years of travel to his credit, was told
this when he spent a year in Eng
land doing Fulbright research at
Oxford University in 1952-53.
During that year, he spent much
of his time giving talks and leading
seminars and discussion groups on
the American way of life, although
he was concentrating his research
on English and Scottish origins of
American political ideas.
Among his most interesting ex
periences in England were speeches
delivered to service clubs and din
ners with members of Parliament
at the House of Commons.
In connection with the latter, Pro
fessor Leavelle commented that the
British are studying American
methods of production to find pos
sible ways to increase their own
production without hurting their so
cial standards.
In February of 1952, he partici
pated in the Seminar in American
Studies at Salzburg, Austria, which
annually brings together 30 or 40 of
the brightest students from Euro
pean countries to discuss American
civilization.
According to Leavelle, the Semi
nar, which is often attended by
Stanford professors, is "one of the
best things being done over there to
increase European-American rela
tions."
The political science professor,
who was born in Los Angeles, re

ceived his Doctor's degree from UC
LA in 1940. However, many of his
interesting experiences came in
earlier years.
From 1923 to 1927, he lived in
China where he became interested
in the theories of the Chinese Com
munists, who were then the van
guard of the Nationalists. He later
did his thesis on the Chinese Com
munists.
The North Hollywood Sun-Record
had Professor Leavelle as a reporter
from 1933 to 1930. At the same time,
he was a member of the Democratic
County Central Committee for the
San Fernando Valley.
Asked why he entered the field of
political science, he seated that he
considered it the "most vital of the
social sciences."
Professor Leavelle, who is mar
ried and has two children, has done
some writing on American political
theoi'y. He is presently working on
American constitutional theory at
the time of the founding fathers.
