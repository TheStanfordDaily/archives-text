# Short Circuit Smokes Out Toyon; Firemen Answer Call
## 
### 
Smoke pouring from a closet brought the Stanford Fire Depart
ment into the Toyon driveway on the double yesterday morning.
At 9 a.m. the haze billowed out of the first-floor janitor's closet
across from room 125, filling the halls and the office situated
nearby.
The source of the smoke was a short in the wiring, an investi-

Ration by Fire Chief John Marston
revealed.
Plumbers working on the second
floor in room 221 were tearing up
the molding in a corner of the room
in order to repair a leaking steam
pipe. They shoved a screwdriver
between the wires connected to a
floor plug, and a short resulted. Un
known to the plumbers, a fuse in the
first - floor closet fuse box wasn't
working and electricity came
through the circuit full force.
"When the plumber shorted the
wires it was like opening a water
faucet wide," Henry Wood, Toyon
electrician, said. "A faulty fuse al
lowed the current to go out with
out being checked, because the fuse
was bypassed at the panel," he said.
The extra load on the circuit
burned the insulation on 80 feet of
wiring, and was the cause of the
smoke. In one spot the wires were
melted in two.
"The panels are old," Wood said,
"and were probably installed when
the building was erected. They are
outdated and worn out."
