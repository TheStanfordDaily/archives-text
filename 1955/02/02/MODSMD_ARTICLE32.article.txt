The Stanford basketballcrs head into the home stretch this weekend
with a two-game series with the Trojans of USC. The prize at the end is
the play-off with the Northern Division champions, and it would be con
sistent with recent Farm tradition if Coach Howie Dallmar should come up
with a championship team in his first year at the helm.
Stanford went to the Rose Bowl in Chuck Taylor's first year as head
coach, and the Indians won the CIBA baseball crown in 15)50 when Everett
stepped in as boss man. Unfortunately tradition failed in the play
offs. Illinois took care of the footballers by a 40-7 count, while Washington
State and Gene Conley, now of the Milwaukee Braves, won two one-run
decisions, G-5 and 3-2, to trim the horsehiders.
But even though Dallmar's cagers are tied with UCLA for the league
lead at this point, the chances of the championship ending up in Palo Alto

appear dim at this point. 'J he Cards
managed an iron man victory over
the Bruins early in January, but
UCLA came back strong the follow
in}' night and overwhelmed the tired
Indians in the closing minutes, and
from here on in the schedule Rives
the Westwooders the edge. They
have half of their remaining games
w,ith California and play Stanford
at their home gym, which is a great
advantage. Stanford has a tough row
to hoe. They have four games with
USC and only two more with Cal.
Stanford must take two from the
Trojans this weekend if they expect
to go south still tied with the Bruins,
since Cal has about as much chance
of beating UCLA at Westwood this
week as an iceberg in hell. The Tro
jans, last year's champs and fourth
placers in the NCAA tourney, also
face this series with grim determi
nation. The SC team is in third place
with a two win, two loss mark, and
even a split would place them a long
way back of UCLA.

The weird scheduling makes Stanford play five of its last six games away
from home, which is another factor which does not operate to the benefit
of the Cards. The Stanford reserves are thin. When Stanford became tired
and was forced to substitute in the second Bruin game, the visitors walked
away v/ilh the game. With eight tough games packed into four weekends,
the Cards will be hard pressed to put a fresh team on the floor every night.
But the UCLA bench has no such problem. Coach Wooderi's biggest prob
lem each year is picking out his five best men. The talent .on the sidelines
is nothing to be scoffed at.

If anyone had any doubts as to Bill Russell's right to be called All -
American, they should have been dispelled this last weekend. The 6-10
junior was up against Russ Lawler and Bob McKeen and could also be
compared with Ken Sears during the Cow Palace doubleheaders, and the
obvious result is that Russell is head and shoulders above all three. Going
into the series with PCC opposition Russell had made over 50 per cent
of his field goal attempts and was leading the Dons' scoring with a near 21-
point average per game. He maintained this average against Stanford, but
thanks to the weakness of the Cal team, Russell only played a limited time
and scored only 11 points.
USF got off to a 20-0 and 22-1 lead over the Golden Bears, before Wool
pert mercifully substituted. The USF first string outscored Cal 56-19 in
the brief jieriod they played. Regardless of Russell's gratuitous statements
about. Bob McKeen, the factsare that he made McKeen look sick all evening,
Russell scores most of his points on dunk shots. He doesn't have a hook
or jump shot fully at his command as yet. When that happens, look out.
Seal's of Santa Clara probably rates above Russell offensively at this point.
Sears is a clever floor man, but nothing on defense. Russell is, however, a
much better jumper than Sears, and can run circles around him on defense.
McKeen is too lethargic ever to be a match for the hustling USF giant.
Nobody will ever see McKeen come down the court the way Russell did
to block Selleck's layup last Friday. Russ Lawler is a Russell type player,
but he's four inches shorter. That's an insuperable handicap against the
dashing Don.
Give Russell a little time to add some polish and he'll be the tops.

Baseball is off to a slow start this year thanks to inclement weather and
coach Dean's operation. Dean is back in the harness now, though, and
the squad is getting in shape for its opening game on Feb. 19 against a
team composed of former Cards now playing pro ball. Stars such as Ray
Swarts, Bob Murphy, Mike Acker, and Jack Shepard will be on hand for
ihe alums as well as several other earlier players. The game will be pre
ceded by an Old Timers game with pre-war participants.
At this point the varsity team, under the capable guidance of Bill Al
house and Jack Shepard during Dean's absence, is beginning to take form.
After an intrasquad game last Friday it looks as if the 1955 Cards will be
much the same type of aggregation as last year—good field, no hit. The
pitching will be strong with Ray Young back, Dick Jones and Ed Verdur
men up from the frosh, and Walt Paine, a transfer student.
If coach Dean can work some punch into the outfield, this year's team
could develop into a CIBA threat to pre-season favorite USC.
,* * *
Bad weather has slowed the track and field boys under coach Jack
Weiershauser too, but the runners, jumpers, and throwers are back at it,
once again faced with the unenviable task of trying to unseat USC. The
Cards lost NCAA javelin champ Leo Long and hurdler Gerry Wood among
others last June, but high jumpers Norm Jiles and John Stewart, sprinter
Keith Brownsberger, and quarter-miler Walt Garrett will be back.
« * *
There are noisy splashes emanating from the Encina swimming pool these
days. Coach Tom Haynie's boys are readying themselves for the NCAA
championships in March and the PCC schedule during spring quarter. The
paddlers are working hard with the hopes of wresting the NCAA crown
from perennial champs Yale and Ohio State, and the Stanfords have a good
chance to do it. Last year's team placed fifth and Jim Gaughran is the only
non-returnee from that squad. Stars Larry Heirn and Dan Osbourne as
well as a host of lesser lights are all back to continue Stanford's Pacific
Coast reign and possibly to extend it over the nation.

HOWIE DALLMAR
—Will tradition hold?
BILL NICHOLS

The Stanford basketballcrs head into the home stretch this weekend
with a two-game series with the Trojans of USC. The prize at the end is
the play-off with the Northern Division champions, and it would be con
sistent with recent Farm tradition if Coach Howie Dallmar should come up
with a championship team in his first year at the helm.
Stanford went to the Rose Bowl in Chuck Taylor's first year as head
coach, and the Indians won the CIBA baseball crown in 15)50 when Everett
stepped in as boss man. Unfortunately tradition failed in the play
offs. Illinois took care of the footballers by a 40-7 count, while Washington
State and Gene Conley, now of the Milwaukee Braves, won two one-run
decisions, G-5 and 3-2, to trim the horsehiders.
But even though Dallmar's cagers are tied with UCLA for the league
lead at this point, the chances of the championship ending up in Palo Alto

appear dim at this point. 'J he Cards
managed an iron man victory over
the Bruins early in January, but
UCLA came back strong the follow
in}' night and overwhelmed the tired
Indians in the closing minutes, and
from here on in the schedule Rives
the Westwooders the edge. They
have half of their remaining games
w,ith California and play Stanford
at their home gym, which is a great
advantage. Stanford has a tough row
to hoe. They have four games with
USC and only two more with Cal.
Stanford must take two from the
Trojans this weekend if they expect
to go south still tied with the Bruins,
since Cal has about as much chance
of beating UCLA at Westwood this
week as an iceberg in hell. The Tro
jans, last year's champs and fourth
placers in the NCAA tourney, also
face this series with grim determi
nation. The SC team is in third place
with a two win, two loss mark, and
even a split would place them a long
way back of UCLA.

The weird scheduling makes Stanford play five of its last six games away
from home, which is another factor which does not operate to the benefit
of the Cards. The Stanford reserves are thin. When Stanford became tired
and was forced to substitute in the second Bruin game, the visitors walked
away v/ilh the game. With eight tough games packed into four weekends,
the Cards will be hard pressed to put a fresh team on the floor every night.
But the UCLA bench has no such problem. Coach Wooderi's biggest prob
lem each year is picking out his five best men. The talent .on the sidelines
is nothing to be scoffed at.

If anyone had any doubts as to Bill Russell's right to be called All -
American, they should have been dispelled this last weekend. The 6-10
junior was up against Russ Lawler and Bob McKeen and could also be
compared with Ken Sears during the Cow Palace doubleheaders, and the
obvious result is that Russell is head and shoulders above all three. Going
into the series with PCC opposition Russell had made over 50 per cent
of his field goal attempts and was leading the Dons' scoring with a near 21-
point average per game. He maintained this average against Stanford, but
thanks to the weakness of the Cal team, Russell only played a limited time
and scored only 11 points.
USF got off to a 20-0 and 22-1 lead over the Golden Bears, before Wool
pert mercifully substituted. The USF first string outscored Cal 56-19 in
the brief jieriod they played. Regardless of Russell's gratuitous statements
about. Bob McKeen, the factsare that he made McKeen look sick all evening,
Russell scores most of his points on dunk shots. He doesn't have a hook
or jump shot fully at his command as yet. When that happens, look out.
Seal's of Santa Clara probably rates above Russell offensively at this point.
Sears is a clever floor man, but nothing on defense. Russell is, however, a
much better jumper than Sears, and can run circles around him on defense.
McKeen is too lethargic ever to be a match for the hustling USF giant.
Nobody will ever see McKeen come down the court the way Russell did
to block Selleck's layup last Friday. Russ Lawler is a Russell type player,
but he's four inches shorter. That's an insuperable handicap against the
dashing Don.
Give Russell a little time to add some polish and he'll be the tops.

Baseball is off to a slow start this year thanks to inclement weather and
coach Dean's operation. Dean is back in the harness now, though, and
the squad is getting in shape for its opening game on Feb. 19 against a
team composed of former Cards now playing pro ball. Stars such as Ray
Swarts, Bob Murphy, Mike Acker, and Jack Shepard will be on hand for
ihe alums as well as several other earlier players. The game will be pre
ceded by an Old Timers game with pre-war participants.
At this point the varsity team, under the capable guidance of Bill Al
house and Jack Shepard during Dean's absence, is beginning to take form.
After an intrasquad game last Friday it looks as if the 1955 Cards will be
much the same type of aggregation as last year—good field, no hit. The
pitching will be strong with Ray Young back, Dick Jones and Ed Verdur
men up from the frosh, and Walt Paine, a transfer student.
If coach Dean can work some punch into the outfield, this year's team
could develop into a CIBA threat to pre-season favorite USC.
,* * *
Bad weather has slowed the track and field boys under coach Jack
Weiershauser too, but the runners, jumpers, and throwers are back at it,
once again faced with the unenviable task of trying to unseat USC. The
Cards lost NCAA javelin champ Leo Long and hurdler Gerry Wood among
others last June, but high jumpers Norm Jiles and John Stewart, sprinter
Keith Brownsberger, and quarter-miler Walt Garrett will be back.

There are noisy splashes emanating from the Encina swimming pool these

chance to do it. Last year's team placed fifth and Jim Gaughran is the only

HOWIE DALLMAR
—Will tradition hold?
BILL NICHOLS

The Stanford basketballcrs head into the home stretch this weekend
with a two-game series with the Trojans of USC. The prize at the end is
the play-off with the Northern Division champions, and it would be con
sistent with recent Farm tradition if Coach Howie Dallmar should come up
with a championship team in his first year at the helm.
Stanford went to the Rose Bowl in Chuck Taylor's first year as head
coach, and the Indians won the CIBA baseball crown in 15)50 when Everett
stepped in as boss man. Unfortunately tradition failed in the play
offs. Illinois took care of the footballers by a 40-7 count, while Washington
State and Gene Conley, now of the Milwaukee Braves, won two one-run
decisions, G-5 and 3-2, to trim the horsehiders.
But even though Dallmar's cagers are tied with UCLA for the league
lead at this point, the chances of the championship ending up in Palo Alto

appear dim at this point. 'J he Cards
managed an iron man victory over
the Bruins early in January, but
UCLA came back strong the follow
in}' night and overwhelmed the tired
Indians in the closing minutes, and
from here on in the schedule Rives
the Westwooders the edge. They
have half of their remaining games
w,ith California and play Stanford
at their home gym, which is a great
advantage. Stanford has a tough row
to hoe. They have four games with
USC and only two more with Cal.
Stanford must take two from the
Trojans this weekend if they expect
to go south still tied with the Bruins,
since Cal has about as much chance
of beating UCLA at Westwood this
week as an iceberg in hell. The Tro
jans, last year's champs and fourth
placers in the NCAA tourney, also
face this series with grim determi
nation. The SC team is in third place
with a two win, two loss mark, and
even a split would place them a long
way back of UCLA.

The weird scheduling makes Stanford play five of its last six games away
from home, which is another factor which does not operate to the benefit
of the Cards. The Stanford reserves are thin. When Stanford became tired
and was forced to substitute in the second Bruin game, the visitors walked
away v/ilh the game. With eight tough games packed into four weekends,
the Cards will be hard pressed to put a fresh team on the floor every night.
But the UCLA bench has no such problem. Coach Wooderi's biggest prob
lem each year is picking out his five best men. The talent .on the sidelines
is nothing to be scoffed at.

If anyone had any doubts as to Bill Russell's right to be called All -
American, they should have been dispelled this last weekend. The 6-10
junior was up against Russ Lawler and Bob McKeen and could also be
compared with Ken Sears during the Cow Palace doubleheaders, and the
obvious result is that Russell is head and shoulders above all three. Going
into the series with PCC opposition Russell had made over 50 per cent
of his field goal attempts and was leading the Dons' scoring with a near 21-
point average per game. He maintained this average against Stanford, but
thanks to the weakness of the Cal team, Russell only played a limited time
and scored only 11 points.
USF got off to a 20-0 and 22-1 lead over the Golden Bears, before Wool
pert mercifully substituted. The USF first string outscored Cal 56-19 in
the brief jieriod they played. Regardless of Russell's gratuitous statements
about. Bob McKeen, the factsare that he made McKeen look sick all evening,
Russell scores most of his points on dunk shots. He doesn't have a hook
or jump shot fully at his command as yet. When that happens, look out.
Seal's of Santa Clara probably rates above Russell offensively at this point.
Sears is a clever floor man, but nothing on defense. Russell is, however, a
much better jumper than Sears, and can run circles around him on defense.
McKeen is too lethargic ever to be a match for the hustling USF giant.
Nobody will ever see McKeen come down the court the way Russell did
to block Selleck's layup last Friday. Russ Lawler is a Russell type player,
but he's four inches shorter. That's an insuperable handicap against the
dashing Don.
Give Russell a little time to add some polish and he'll be the tops.

Baseball is off to a slow start this year thanks to inclement weather and
coach Dean's operation. Dean is back in the harness now, though, and
the squad is getting in shape for its opening game on Feb. 19 against a
team composed of former Cards now playing pro ball. Stars such as Ray
Swarts, Bob Murphy, Mike Acker, and Jack Shepard will be on hand for
ihe alums as well as several other earlier players. The game will be pre
ceded by an Old Timers game with pre-war participants.
At this point the varsity team, under the capable guidance of Bill Al
house and Jack Shepard during Dean's absence, is beginning to take form.
After an intrasquad game last Friday it looks as if the 1955 Cards will be
much the same type of aggregation as last year—good field, no hit. The
pitching will be strong with Ray Young back, Dick Jones and Ed Verdur
men up from the frosh, and Walt Paine, a transfer student.
If coach Dean can work some punch into the outfield, this year's team
could develop into a CIBA threat to pre-season favorite USC.

Bad weather has slowed the track and field boys under coach Jack
Weiershauser too, but the runners, jumpers, and throwers are back at it,

Coast reign and possibly to extend it over the nation.
