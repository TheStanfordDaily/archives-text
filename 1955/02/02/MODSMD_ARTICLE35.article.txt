# Belts Defeat SAE II In Pavilion Contest
## 
### LARRY JENSEN 
Delt I edged out SAE 11, 19-16, in an intramural basketball con
test in the Pavilion last night. As the score indicates, both teams
were something less than hot in their shooting.
The Delts jumped off to a 5-0 lead in the first 10 minutes of
action on a free throw by Jim Westphal and two buckets by Jim

Kelly. Bill Young finally put the
SAE's on the scoreboard with a two
pointer midway through the first
half.
Kelly and Bill Travel's hit from
the floor to stretch the Delt lead to
9-2 but two quick buckets by Clayt
McGiil and another by Young put
the SAE's back in the game. West
phal hit a pair of free tosses to give
the Delts an 11-8 lead at half-time.
Delt Howie Schwartz hit on a
jump shot to open the second half
but SAE came back to tie the score
at 13 apiece on a free throw by
Young and layins by McGiil and Al
Campbell. %
Westphal hit twice from the side
to push the Delts out in front, 17-
13, but the SAE's narrowed the gap
to one point on Don Geddes' long

Just before the final whistle
I Schwartz pushed in a l()-l'ooter to
ice the game for the Delts.
Neither team could hit from the
floor, especially in the second half.
Play was fairly smooth with few
wild passes, but time after time,
Delt and SAE shots would arch to
ward the basket only to bounce off
the rim. Westphal was most con
sistent for the Delts .while Young
and McGill hit a fair percentage of
j their shots for the SAE's.
McGill and shared scor

Kelly backed up Westphal in the
