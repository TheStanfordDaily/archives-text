# Indians Drop In AP Poll
## 
### 
Stanford fell from the top 20 in
this week's Associated Press basket
ball poll. Losers to USF by a 7(5-60
score, the Indians dropped out of
sight. USF is in the second spot
with 953 votes, behind Kentucky
with 1,031 ballots.
Georgia Tech dropped the Wild
cats by a 65-59 score for their sec
ond win of the year over Kentucky,
and USF could easily move up into
the top spot next week.
Other coast teams in the top 20
are UCLA in eighth place, and Ore
gon State in nineteenth. Oregon
State got off to a slow start, but as
soon as 7-3 Swede Halbrook was
eligible early in January, the Bea
vers began to pick up, and have now
won eight straight Northern Divi
sion games.
