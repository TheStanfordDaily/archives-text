Compiled from Dispaicfaes oi the United Press

WASHINGTON, Feb. Iâ€”A Sen
ate proposal to endorse United Na
tions efforts to achieve a cease-fire
in the Formosa Strait was side
tracked today after Republican
Leader William F. Knowland indi
cated he would .seek "no appease
ment" amendments.
The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee postponed action on the
plan and there were signs it might
be put.on the .shelf for keeps. Sen
ator Homer E. Capehart (R., Ind.)
called the proposed resolution "ab
solutely unnecessary."
Other committee members felt a
Senate debate on the issue, possibly

of angry proportions, might upset
current delicate U.N. efforts to halt
the fighting between the Chinese
Communists and Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalist forces.
