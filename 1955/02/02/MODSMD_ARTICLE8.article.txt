# IFC Discusses Rushing System
## 
### 
A discussion of thus year's rush
ing season was the primary item of
business at a meeting of the Inter-
Fraternity Council in the Kappa
Sigma house last night.
The council generally thought that
the open house period went very
well, but that it might possibly be
better to eliminate the Saturday aft
ernoon session because so few rush
ees visited the houses at that time,
The signing of pledge cards at the
individual houses with various
alumni present, which was initiated
this year, was felt to have been suc
cessful. â€¢ "*
It was pointed out that a meeting
of freshman, sponsors and wing pres
idents liked very much the restric
tions on visiting hours at Encina and
the Village during forma! rush.
Many of the frosh, according to the
report, also wanted to have an open
house on the row during the Fall
before rushing begins.
Several violations of the restricted
visitation hours were reported and
these will be acted upon by the
council within a few weeks.
