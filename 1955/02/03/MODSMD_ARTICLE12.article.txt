Eric Fricker, Election Board chair
man, presented a report on securing
voting machines for the spring elec
tions, and said that he felt that hav

j faster, more accurate voting, and
j would bring out more voters. The
! discussion was tabled by Excom for
a week, and Flicker will continue
! investigation on the machines.
An Honor Code Subcommit
| tee proposal to clarify the issue
on taking tests out of the class
room was tabled for a week for
; further consideration by ASSU
i Executive Committee last night.
The proposal, presented by the
I subcommittee chairman Ann Irvine,
j would add a section to the Honor
I Code stating that if adequate seat
] ing is available, tests would be taken
from the room only with the consent
■ of the instructor. Committee mem
j ber Dave Jenks emphasized that the
proposal would be only a slight
change in the status quo.
The Honor Code group studied
the classroom test policy and its
usage from 1921 to the present, and
felt that it would be advisable to
return to the original policy as stat
ed in their proposal.
A motion presented by ASSU vice
president Diane Goldman to table
consideration of the Honor Code
progress report until constituents
can be heard from, was passed by
Excom.
In another action, Excom passed a
motion to allocate $400 from the
ASSU contingency fund to Rally
Committee to send a small band to
UCLA on the weekend of Feb. 12.
The motion was then amended and
passed that the $400 would be guar
| anteed only if the Stanford Athletic
i Board refused to grant the funds.
George Sheldon, representing the
I Indian Band which plays at basket
| ball games, presented the request to
! Excom. The money would be used
i to charter a bus for band members,
I who would assume the remainder of
I the expenses for the trip, he said.
Sheldon said that the band felt it
I would be worthwhile to have a Stan
i ford representation in the small and
! partisan UCLA pavilion.
Excom appointed Mary Margaret
| Eraser the new director of the re
j ccnt.ly re-formed Public Relations
I Committee. The by - law changes
I transferring the head yell leader
; from Rally Com to Cardinals were
passed unanimously.
