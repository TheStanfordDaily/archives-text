# Foreign Policy Parley Concluded at Banquet; Rothwell Delivers Talk
## Banquet Speaker U.S. Role in Free World Is Discussed 
### JIM PALMER 
"The price of a free world is
high and it cannot be paid in
dollars," declared C. Easton
Rothwell, director of Hoover In
stitute and Library, as the four
day Western College Confer
ence on American Foreign Pol
icy came to a close yesterday
noon with a banquet at Rickey's.
"The price must be paid with seLf
discipline and self-restraint, toler
ance and understanding, acceptance
and vigilance, quiet determination
and a willingness to sacrifice," he
stated.
Some 80 delegates heard Rothwell
describe the role that America, the
"richest and strongest nation in the
world," must assume in order to
"help the free world help itself."
"We must give of our substance
and provide a rallying point for oth
er nations. We must meet acts of
aggression, and we must carry the
major share of the burden."
However, Rothwell pointed out
America cannot buy loyalty and
friendship, but instead must foster
"respect and understanding" on
which any partnership must be
built.
Rothwell assessed the present era
as one of "emancipation" and "deep
ening humanitarianism."
"The distance we've moved in 100
years is tremendous. There has
been a drive to freedom and richer
humanitarianism. We have cam
paigned, legislated, and fought for
freedom."
"So long as colonialism remains in
the world, our task is more diffi
cult," he continued. "The most en
during achievements we have made
are the steps we have taken to build
and strengthen the free world."
