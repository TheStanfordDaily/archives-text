# Concert Hailed As 'Exciting'
## 
### NEWMAN POWELL 
Audiences around Stanford have
had plenty of opportunity to find out
that chamber music can be exciting.
This was demonstrated again last
night by the Juilliard String Quar
tet, which gave a brilliant, colorful,
and musically solid program of
quartets by Mozart, Piston, and
Beethoven.
Chief attraction on the program
from the standpoint of a musical ex
plorer was the Piston Quartet No. 1,
written in 1933. In less capable
hands this is the kind of modern
work that could be deadly, but it
was anything but dead last night.
Piston has achieved the amazing
feat of centering the intensity of the
work in the slow movement, which
was characterized by colorful sono
rities, expressive recitatives, and, as
a centerpiece, a driving fugue.
In the last movement Piston suc
cessfully sui-mounted one of the
most difficult problems of the mod
ern composer—that of writing a fast
movement that has a clearly deline
ated form and that uses irregular
rhythms without getting bogged
down in them.
In the Mozart Quartet, in D. K. .")7r>,
the Juilliard group showed great
finesse, though at times it seemed a
little too gentle, too restricted to the
nineteenth-century concept of Mo
zart as the "acme of Grecian light
ness and grace." A little more bold
ness and sparkle would have been
welcomed by this listener.
The first movement of the Bee
thoven, Op. 59, No. 2, also some
times tended to let down into too
suave a style, though there was ade
quate power and force in the cli
maxes.
