University development was the
subject of the "Stanford—Today
and Tomorrow" talk given by
James S. Triolo, Associate General
Secretary of the University, before
the combined groups of Theta Xi
and the Oaks last night at the Theta
Xi house.
Triolo gave the group an outline
of Stanford's financial situation and
•briefly discussed the present land
development program.
"Stanford's biggest financial han
dicap has been a psychological one,"
Triolo said. "The reason our endow
ment has not risen as fast as that of
other schools is because our alumni
thought that Senator Stanford's
original endowment of $21 million
would last forever."
The Stanford Associates was
formed to build up the University's
income and works through commit
tees. The "R" Plan is run by one
such committee which requests
(through Stanford alumni lawyers)
people to think about Stanford when
they make out their wills.
The Special Gifts Committee tries
to encourage large gifts from very
wealthy friends of the University.
The "American Corporations Com
mittee" looks for gifts from Ameri
can business. "American corpora
tions have an increasing awareness
of their duty toward education,"
Triolo said.
"We have received more gifts in
the last five years than wc received
in the previous 40," he added.
"State aid would be our probable
resort if the present yearly deficit
continues," Triolo stated, but a lit
tle state aid would lead to a lot.
"No one would want to see every
school in the country run by the
government."
"Our efforts are aimed at main
taining the freedom, and independ
ence of this University and to main
tain its caliber," Triolo concluded.
