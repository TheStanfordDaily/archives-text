### EDA MENDELS 
Stanford debaters met with representatives of the University of
Southern California Tuesday night over the question: "Resolved,
that the United States should extend diplomatic recognition to the
Communist government of China."
Jinx Patterson and Arliss Barjies, presenting the affirmative side,

spolco for Stanford. They won the*
debate by unanimous vote of the
judges, and thus brought the Delta
Sigma Rlio cup back to Stanford.
This trophy, named after Ihc na
tional honorary speeeb fraternity of
which both .schools arc members, is
awarded annually after the Stan
ford-USC debate. It has spent the
past year at (JSC. Cal Anderson and
Murray Brine; represented USC.
Miss Barnes, first affirmative
speaker, outlined some of the dis
advantages of non-recognition. She
said it strained unity and co-opera
tion among the Western allies, but
USC opponent Anderson dismissed !
the seriousness of that situation.
In Asia, non-recognition places
the United States at a psychological
disadvantage. With the rampant
nationalism and hostility toward co
lonialism, such countries as Indone
sia, Pakistan, and Ceylon arc re
sentful of foreign intervention. They
don't understand why the U.S. won't
recognize another Asian country.
Miss Barnes continued.
The negative countered that "rec
ognition would greatly enhance the I
prestige of the Communist govern- 1
mcnt in the eyes of the free people j
in Asia." Furthermore, United States I
policy would be discredited at this
reverse of position.
The third point advanced by the
affirmative was that recognition
would decrease dangerous tension in

China itself. USC answered that
with recognition would come in
creased trade, and thus "augment
China's war potential."
Miss Patterson pointed out that,
trade with China was restricted
through a U.N. embargo, rather than
through the United States discour
aging her Western allies from trad
ing. Just as the United States car
ries on diplomatic relations with
Russia without joining in trade
agreements, recognition need not
imply economic involvements with
China.
The Stanford debaters brought
out that communication and nego
tiation could be carried on directly
if the United States were to recog
nize the Chinese Reds. The negative
reply was that negotiations could be
carried on now too, as at Panmun
jom and Geneva.
Judges of the debate were Father
Joseph Wall. S.J., Miss Carmendale
Fcrnandes, and Robert Dagget,
speech coaches at University of
Santa Clara, Fremont High School
in Sunnyvale, and the University of
California, respectively.

prestige of the Communist govern- 1
mcnt in the eyes of the free people j
in Asia." Furthermore, United States I
policy would be discredited at this
reverse of position.
The third point advanced by the
affirmative was that recognition
would decrease dangerous tension in

China itself. USC answered that
with recognition would come in
creased trade, and thus "augment
China's war potential."
Miss Patterson pointed out that,
trade with China was restricted
through a U.N. embargo, rather than
through the United States discour
aging her Western allies from trad
ing. Just as the United States car
ries on diplomatic relations with
Russia without joining in trade
agreements, recognition need not
imply economic involvements with
China.
The Stanford debaters brought
out that communication and nego
tiation could be carried on directly
if the United States were to recog
nize the Chinese Reds. The negative
reply was that negotiations could be
carried on now too, as at Panmun
jom and Geneva.
Judges of the debate were Father
Joseph Wall. S.J., Miss Carmendale
Fcrnandes, and Robert Dagget,
speech coaches at University of
Santa Clara, Fremont High School
in Sunnyvale, and the University of
California, respectively.

Stanford debaters met with representatives of the University of
Southern California Tuesday night over the question: "Resolved,
that the United States should extend diplomatic recognition to the
Communist government of China."
Jinx Patterson and Arliss Barjies, presenting the affirmative side,

spolco for Stanford. They won the*
debate by unanimous vote of the
judges, and thus brought the Delta
Sigma Rlio cup back to Stanford.
This trophy, named after Ihc na
tional honorary speeeb fraternity of
which both .schools arc members, is
awarded annually after the Stan
ford-USC debate. It has spent the
past year at (JSC. Cal Anderson and
Murray Brine; represented USC.
Miss Barnes, first affirmative
speaker, outlined some of the dis
advantages of non-recognition. She
said it strained unity and co-opera
tion among the Western allies, but
USC opponent Anderson dismissed !
the seriousness of that situation.
In Asia, non-recognition places
the United States at a psychological
disadvantage. With the rampant
nationalism and hostility toward co
lonialism, such countries as Indone
sia, Pakistan, and Ceylon arc re
sentful of foreign intervention. They
don't understand why the U.S. won't
recognize another Asian country.
Miss Barnes continued.
The negative countered that "rec
ognition would greatly enhance the I
prestige of the Communist govern- 1
mcnt in the eyes of the free people j
in Asia." Furthermore, United States I
policy would be discredited at this
reverse of position.
