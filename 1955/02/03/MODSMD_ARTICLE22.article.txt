# U.S. Policy Toward Asia Probed in College Panel
## 
### MARY ELLEN ROMNEY 
The diversified scope of opinion in Asian foreign policy was
explored Tuesday night when "Retaliation Against Communist
China: Its Asian Repercussions" was discussed in the final sym
posium of the Western College Conference on Foreign Policy.
Dr. Frederic Spiegelberg, assistant professor of Indian Civiliza-

+ tion, moderated the panel, and in
troduced the participants: Colonel
Fred Buechner, Dr. Robert C. North,
and Dr. Richard L. Park.
Colonel Buechner, recently re
turned from service with the U.S.
Army in Asia, sounded a challenge
to democracy. "We did not achieve
peace in Korea, but an armistice.
We have been too conciliatory to
ward China." Colonel Buechner
stated that he believed 85 to 90 per
cent of the people on the Chinese
mainland "would rise to greet
Chiang Kai-shek if we would free
his army and the South Koreans in
order to invade the mainland."
Buechner also favored a complete
trade embargo against all Asian
Communist countries.
Communist influence combined
with long overdue social revolutions
was Dr. North's explanation of Red
successses in Asia. "No one knows
what support Chiang Kai - shek
would receive in China," he said.
"It is one of the great unknowns of
our time."
North, who recently returned to
Stanford from India, stressed the
importance for the United States to
think on three levels—military, eco
nomic, and political. "We have been
losing the political warfare, which is
probably the most important," he
j concluded.
Dr. Park, an assistant professor of
political science at the University
of California, explained the position
of the independent Asian states,
with particular reference' to India,
where he lived for many years.
"These countries, attempting to
remain neutral, feel that they can
best rebuild their nations in the
absence of war. Typical of new,
week governments, they are seeking
a way to avoid world conflict," Park
said. They are afraid of treaty
agreements because they do not
want to suffer the consequences of a
situation they did not create."
