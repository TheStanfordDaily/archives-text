# the 						real hazard ...... an editorial
## 
### 
A fellow's in a hurry driving down io ROTC
so he rolls through the four-way stop at the
Arguello-Escondido intersection near Stern
Hall. That's what led the ASSU Hazards Com
mittee to tag the intersection as a "campus
hazard." And when the .University recently
pointed out that it didn't have the money, right
now, to put a full-time policeman at the corner
or set up a stoplight, there was a real howl.
"Is the University going to wait until some
body gets killed out there?" somebody asked.
Now wait a minute: What is the hazard at

the four-way stop? There are four stopsigns out
there and all of them can be seen from half a
block away with no trouble. Is it the fault of
the traffic engineer when the guy in the blue
Mercury ignores them?
Don't point the accusing finger at the inter
section when you're picking out campus haz
ards, and don't yell at the University to "do
something!" If you're looking for the hazard
out there, we'll tell you where to find it:
Behind the wheel of that car.
