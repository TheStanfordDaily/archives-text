See by the San Bernardino Sun-Telegraph
that a fellow name of L. P. Beria was nominated
for mayor of that southern city.
In order to run in San Bernardino, a candidate
has to have a petition signed by at least 19
residents. It took only an hour to get the re
quired number for Beria.
On the petition the candidate's occupation
was listed as, ex-police chief, his address as,
143 Kremlin, USSR.
First signature on the petition was another
famous boy, name of V. M. Molotov, 734
Kremlin.
Signer's comments were choice, get this for
the views of a well-informed citizen, "Oh, I've
heard of him a lot in the newspapers," or one
who hoped "this guy will open things wide
open. Oh, maybe not as bad as Vegas. But
it sure would stimulate business."
The gunpowder business?
One of the more cautious citizenry asked
the man with the petition, "Is this man straight?"
Our petition man, thinking of Beria's present
condition said, "He's very straightâ€”now."
Ex police chiefs really swing a lot of weight,
no matter what their condtition.

But this isn't right. Beria's not a U.S. citizen, |
nor a resident or registered voter of San Berna
dino County.
He's dead, too. Well, ain't he?
Think of a city government run by good old
L.P. and his boys: no fuss, no bother; in fact,
no government. Worried about income taxes?
'Mit no government, gives no taxes. Of course,
firing squads cost a bit to equip, but so do
voting machines.
This may sound funny, but it's serious busi- i
ness, it is. The Reds could slowly and surely
slip into our local governments with such
tricks.
"From little acorns, mighty oaks do grow"
(new coined phrase) and before you know it'
the whole Kremlin crew will be sitting in Wash
ington. Instead of Ike's smiling countenance
beaming at us on the teevee, it will be sad-faced
L.P.
What will them Rooshans try next? First they I
fake out that Beria has taken the treatment and
then they sneak him in as mayor of San Ber
nardino. t
But, don't they know: the area has been made
off-limits to Russians, dead or alive.
