To the Editor:
I would like to express my alarm at being grossly
misquoted in The Daily of January 27, 1955. In that
Issue of your newspaper you included an article
abou he unfortunate prank that led to my car, a
lf*"7 x ..wkard, being subjected to two nights mired in
Ld... Lngunita. Your reporting of the incident was
adequate, but later in the article you quoted me as
saying . . he believed the car was deposited in the
lake by some of his Phi Kap fraternity brothers as
a prank." During the proceedings involved in remov
ing the car from the lake I made no such statement,
and it is particularly vexing to have such a quotation
attributed to me since I am not affiliated with the
Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity in any way. I hope these
inaccuracies and unfounded assumptions on your part
are no indication of the average quality of your re
porting. EDGAR F. KIEFER

A spokesman for Phi Kaptia Psi indicates that
Kiefer is affiliated with that house, not Phi Kappa '
Sigma. The Daily story quoted the police, not
Kiefer.—Ed.
thanks!
To the Editor:
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the
Stanford student body as a whole for its enthusiastic
support of the Western College Conference on Amer
ican Foreign Policy, which ended yesterday. I ap
preciate the help of the many students and faculty
members whom I have not had a chance to thank
personally. We of the Conference Department of the
IIR are particularly grateful for the excellent cov
erage of the conference events in The Stanford Daily.
Without such support, the conference could never
have succeeded.
