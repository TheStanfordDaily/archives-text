# Drive to Aid Berlin University
## Supplies Needed For Students From East Berlin 
### BRAD LEONARD 
You are an East German student
living in the Soviet sector of Ber
lin, citizen of a city that is half free
and half slave.
Between you and the free half of
your city is an invisible dividing
line—invisible, that is, except for
the armed Allied and Russian
guards that constantly watch those
entering and leaving each hector.
You want to cross that line in
order to study at the Free Univer
sity of Berlin, but there is one thing
that stops you—money. You are
free to cross to the Allied sector, but
when you do, you leave everything
behind you but the clothes on your
back.
One-third of the money to be col
lected during the Winter Quarter
Charity Drive, which will be next
week, will go towprd helping refu
gee East Berlin students with a
problem like the one posed above.
There are literally thousands of
these students, and they need finan
cial assistance if they are to take
advantage of the educational oppor
tunities offered by the Free Univer
sity of Berlin.
They must be clothed, fed, and
housed until they can find jobs to
support themselves, and this is in
addition to the cost of going to the
university, which is roughly $.38 a
term (the equivalent to a semester).
The scholarships, which the drive
funds will provide, will be given
exclusively to these students fleeing
from the Russian sector of Berlin.
With the problem of inflation in
Germany as it exists today, Ameri
can dollars go a long way; however,
the demand is greater than the sup-
Ply-
Out of the total enrollment of the

Free University of Berlin, which is]
approximately 7.000, over one-third j
of the students come from the Soviet j
Zone of Germany and East Berlin. j
i This means that practically without |
1 exception every one of these stu- J
i dents requires the support which I
j only scholarships can provide.

} The need is great. East German
J students educated at the Free Uni
i versity of Berlin provide an effective
i link between the Communist and
I free world, for their knowledge is
j a powerful weapon in checking the
I spread of Communist propaganda
| concerning the free world.


BOOKS FOR BERLIN—This man in West Berlin is preparing to
send a package of books to a relative in one of the Russian con
| centration camps behind the Iron Curtain. These books are ob-
I tained without charge from the Free University of Berlin, one
j of the charities to receive funds from the Winter Quarter Charity
1 Drive, which will be held next week.

Out of the total enrollment of the

Free University of Berlin, which is]
approximately 7.000, over one-third j
of the students come from the Soviet j
Zone of Germany and East Berlin. j

1 exception every one of these stu- J

j only scholarships can provide.

BOOKS FOR BERLIN—This man in West Berlin is preparing to
send a package of books to a relative in one of the Russian con
| centration camps behind the Iron Curtain. These books are ob-
I tained without charge from the Free University of Berlin, one
j of the charities to receive funds from the Winter Quarter Charity
1 Drive, which will be held next week.
You are an East German student
living in the Soviet sector of Ber
lin, citizen of a city that is half free
and half slave.
Between you and the free half of
your city is an invisible dividing
line—invisible, that is, except for
the armed Allied and Russian
guards that constantly watch those
entering and leaving each hector.
You want to cross that line in
order to study at the Free Univer
sity of Berlin, but there is one thing
that stops you—money. You are
free to cross to the Allied sector, but
when you do, you leave everything
behind you but the clothes on your
back.
One-third of the money to be col
lected during the Winter Quarter
Charity Drive, which will be next
week, will go towprd helping refu
gee East Berlin students with a
problem like the one posed above.
There are literally thousands of
these students, and they need finan
cial assistance if they are to take
advantage of the educational oppor
tunities offered by the Free Univer
sity of Berlin.
They must be clothed, fed, and
housed until they can find jobs to
support themselves, and this is in
addition to the cost of going to the
university, which is roughly $.38 a
term (the equivalent to a semester).
The scholarships, which the drive
funds will provide, will be given
exclusively to these students fleeing
from the Russian sector of Berlin.
