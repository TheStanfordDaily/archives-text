If the spirit should ever move you to write me a letter —and
it's always a pleasure to hear from you—take pen and paper and
address me c/o Philip Morris, 100 Park Ave., New York 17, N. Y.
Or if you don't have any paper, snap open your Snap-Open
pack of Philip Morris, remove the fine vintage cigarettes, turn
the neat brown wrapper inside out and itee it for stationery.
The regular size Philip Morris pack is perfect for short notes.
For longer letters use the king size pack. For chain letters and
petitions, glue several packs together.
This week's column is devoted to a few of the many interest
ing letters that have been coming in:
SIR:
Maybe you can help me. I came up to college eight years ago.
On my very first day I got into a bridge game at the Students
Union. I am still in the same bridge game. I have never gone to
a class, cracked a book, or paid any tuition. All 1 do is play bridge.
To explain my long absence and keep the money coming from
home, I told a harmless little lie. I said 1 was in medical school.
This made Dad (my father) very proud. It also enabled me to
keep playing bridge. We were both terribly happy.
But all good things must come to an end. Mine ended last
week when I was home for spring vacation. I arrived to find that
Sister (my sister) was in the hospital with an ingrown spleen.
Dr. Norbert Sigafoos, the eminent ingrown spleen surgeon, was
scheduled to operate, but unfortunately he was run over by a
hot-food cart on the way to the scrubbing room.
"Oh, nevermind," chuckled Dad (my father). "Harlow (me)
will fix Sister (my sister)."
Well sir, what could I do? If I told the truth I would make a
laughingstock out of Dad (my father) who had been bragging
about me all over town. Also I would get yanked out of school
which would be a dirty shame just when I am getting to under
stand the weak club bid.
There was nothing for it but to brazen it out. T got Sister
(my sister) apart all right, but I must confess myself com
pletely at a loss as to how to put her back together again. Can
you suggest anything? They're getting pretty surly around here.

Dear Harlow,
Indeed I do have a solution for you —the solution that has never
failed me whenever things close in: Light up a Philip Morris!
Knots untie as you puff that rich vintage tobacco. Shade becomes
light as you taste that mild fragrant flavor . . . And as you watch
the pure white smoke drift lazily upward, you will know that
nothing is as had as it seems, that it is always darkest before the
dawn, and that the man worthwhile is the man who can srnile!
STR:
Do you think a girl should kiss a fellow on their first date?
Blanch p. Carhoh yrfra te
Hear Blanche,
Not unless he i» her escort.
SIR:
Here is a rather amusing coincidence that may amuse your
readers.
Just off the campus where I go to school there is a lake called
Lake Widgiwagan where students from time immemorial have
gone fishing. Thirty years ago when my father was an under
graduate here he went fishing one day at Widgiwagan and
dropped his Deke pin into the water. Though he dived for it for
many weeks, he never recovered it.
Just yesterday —thirty years later, mind you —I went fishing
at Widgiwagan. I caught a four pound bass. When I got the fish
home and opened it up, what do you think I found inside of it?
You guessed it! Two tickets to the Dempsey-Firpo fight.

graduate here he went fishing one day at Widgiwagan and
dropped his Deke pin into the water. Though he dived for it for
many weeks, he never recovered it.
Just yesterday —thirty years later, mind you —I went fishing
at Widgiwagan. I caught a four pound bass. When I got the fish

If the spirit should ever move you to write me a letter —and
it's always a pleasure to hear from you—take pen and paper and
address me c/o Philip Morris, 100 Park Ave., New York 17, N. Y.
Or if you don't have any paper, snap open your Snap-Open
pack of Philip Morris, remove the fine vintage cigarettes, turn
the neat brown wrapper inside out and itee it for stationery.
The regular size Philip Morris pack is perfect for short notes.
For longer letters use the king size pack. For chain letters and
petitions, glue several packs together.
This week's column is devoted to a few of the many interest

SIR:
Maybe you can help me. I came up to college eight years ago.
On my very first day I got into a bridge game at the Students
Union. I am still in the same bridge game. I have never gone to
a class, cracked a book, or paid any tuition. All 1 do is play bridge.
To explain my long absence and keep the money coming from
home, I told a harmless little lie. I said 1 was in medical school.
This made Dad (my father) very proud. It also enabled me to
keep playing bridge. We were both terribly happy.
But all good things must come to an end. Mine ended last
week when I was home for spring vacation. I arrived to find that
Sister (my sister) was in the hospital with an ingrown spleen.
Dr. Norbert Sigafoos, the eminent ingrown spleen surgeon, was
scheduled to operate, but unfortunately he was run over by a
hot-food cart on the way to the scrubbing room.
"Oh, nevermind," chuckled Dad (my father). "Harlow (me)
will fix Sister (my sister)."
Well sir, what could I do? If I told the truth I would make a
laughingstock out of Dad (my father) who had been bragging
about me all over town. Also I would get yanked out of school
which would be a dirty shame just when I am getting to under
stand the weak club bid.
There was nothing for it but to brazen it out. T got Sister
(my sister) apart all right, but I must confess myself com
pletely at a loss as to how to put her back together again. Can
you suggest anything? They're getting pretty surly around here.

Dear Harlow,
Indeed I do have a solution for you —the solution that has never
failed me whenever things close in: Light up a Philip Morris!
Knots untie as you puff that rich vintage tobacco. Shade becomes
light as you taste that mild fragrant flavor . . . And as you watch
the pure white smoke drift lazily upward, you will know that
nothing is as had as it seems, that it is always darkest before the
dawn, and that the man worthwhile is the man who can srnile!
STR:
Do you think a girl should kiss a fellow on their first date?
Blanch p. Carhoh yrfra te
Hear Blanche,
Not unless he i» her escort.
SIR:
Here is a rather amusing coincidence that may amuse your
readers.
Just off the campus where I go to school there is a lake called
Lake Widgiwagan where students from time immemorial have
gone fishing. Thirty years ago when my father was an under
graduate here he went fishing one day at Widgiwagan and
dropped his Deke pin into the water. Though he dived for it for
many weeks, he never recovered it.
