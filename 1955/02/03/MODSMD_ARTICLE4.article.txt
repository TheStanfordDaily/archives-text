TAIPEI, Thursday, Feb. 3 —The
Chinese Nationalists today imposed
a security blackout on military ac

evacuation under the protective
guns of the U.S. Navy was shaping
up rapidly.
A shipload of 538 refugees from

were beaten off, and escorted the
ship to Keelung Harbor in North

orders to defend the outpost "to the
last." But all signs pointed to a
crumbling military position.
