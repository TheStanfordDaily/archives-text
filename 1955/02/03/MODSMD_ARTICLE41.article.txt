A completely revamped Pa
cific Coast Conference basket
ball schedule combining the
Northern and Southern Divi
sions for 1956 and 1957 was re
leased last week by the com
missioner's office.
Instead ol playing each team in
the division four times as is pres
ently tfle case, the nine PCC schools
will meet each of the other eight
teams two times over the season.
The new schedule will give the
northern schools the same number
of conference games, while the
southern schools will be playing
four more than their present 12
loop contests.
Stanford will face Idaho, Oregon,
UCLA, and Cal at home, while they
travel to meet Washington, Oregon
State, USC, and Washington State.
The following year, the schedule
will reverse itself, and from then on
will alternate from year to year.
This will be the first time in his
tory that Indian cage fans will be
able to see the Northwest quintets
in regular action. The only appear
ances of the Northern Division
teams have been few and far be
tween.
The schedule:
Jan. 6-7 —Stanford at Washington,
OSC at WSC, USC at California,
Idaho at UCLA.
Jan. 13-14—OSC at USC. Califor
nia at Oregon, UCLA at WSC, Idaho
at Stanford.
