# Honor Code Committees Issue Joint Statement
## 
### 
I'ollowing is a statement drawn up jointly by the Council for
Student Control. It undamental Standard Committee, and the Spe
cial ASSL' Honor Code Study Subcommittee. It relates to the
appearance factor in Honor Code cases, which was brought out
iji several recent Council for Student Control cases.â€”Ed.
The Stanford Honor Code is a privilege that was given to the
students by the faculty in 1921. The responsibility for conduct in the
taking of exams was placed in the hands of the students.
The faculty holds the prerogative to revoke the Code at any time
if they feel that it is not being handled properly by the students.
Therefore it is up to the students to maintain proper appearance,
as well as impeccable conduct, during the taking of exams.
Suspicion can be a great undermining factor in a code that is based
largely on the concept of trust. It is thus the responsibility of each
student to sec that he does not give the "appearance" of cheating.
This "appearance" factor has played an important part in many
of the recent cases brought before the Council for Student. Control.
Persons have been found innocent, of actual Honor Code violations,
but were guilty of creating the atmosphere of cheating.
The students have become lax in their actions in the examination
room, and this has led to the suspicion of cheating. The careless ac
tions of some of these students have abused the privilege of the
Code and put its very existence in danger.
Excessive talking and reference to papers or books during the
taking of examinations gives the*appearance of cheating and weak
ens the whole Code structure. The rumor or suspicion of an Honor
Code violation can Ix? as harmful as an actual violation in regard to
the effective working of the Code.
It is thus important that each student take it upon himself to
watch his own actions in the examination room in order to make
certain that, his actions will arouse no suspicion.
