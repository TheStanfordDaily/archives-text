# U.S. 'World Partnership' Is Theme of Policy Conference
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
In the course of covering several of the events of this week's Western
College Conference here, Daily reporter Helen Dcwar had a chance to
note many of the basic conclusions reachcd on American foreign policy.
Here are her impressions on some of those conclusions.—Ed.

The Western College Conference on American Foreign Policy
which was concluded here recently apparently arrived at several
basic premises in regard to the ideals and applications of American
foreign policy.
Through a series of seminars, panels, debates, and speeches,

the conference participants appeared
to give hearty support to President
Eisenhower's policy of partnership
among the nations of the world in a
system of international co-opera
tion.
A conclusion was drawn in sev
eral of the panels and seminars that
the United States must rcspect the
"dignity of man" a.nd not seek to
forcc her own social and political
ideals on cultures radically differ
ent from her own.
Efforts should be made to guard
against the alienation of neutral
countries by the forceful exporta
tion of our own doctrines, tying
military and other coercive strings
to our economic aid.
Communism finds the most, fertile
ground in which to grow in eco
nomically underdeveloped countries,
several seminar delegates pointed
out. All a Communist leader needs

—
is a small dissatisfied minority, and
a poverty-stricken populace, and the
free world has lost another nation to
Communism.
A panel studying propaganda and
its effect on the Cold War appeared
to have concluded that propaganda
can exert no force unless it is backed
up by positive action on the part of
the United States.
One panel member declared that
our most effective propaganda
weapons have been the Supreme
Court's ruling on the segregation
case and President Eisenhower's
atom proposal.
Three measures were offered, by
another seminal - group to strengthen
our position abroad: (I) economic
aid to "middle bloc" countries, (2)
positive propaganda, and (3) a "fight
fire with fire" policy to stimulate
insurrections in Red countries.
