# Korean Consul Favors War To Free China
## 
### RIC TEAGUE 
"Don't be deceived that a so
j called United Nations fought
Communist aggression in Ko
rea,"
With these words. Young Han
Choo, Korean Consul General in
San Francisco, said that the Korean
War was a war between "two fac
tions of the United Nations, one led
by Russia, the other by the United
States."
The Korean diplomat spoke yester
day in an Institute of International
Relations sponsored talk before an
informal gathering at Bowman
Alumni House.
Choo, speaking sometimes as a
representative of the Republic of
Korea and sometimes "off the cuff"
as an observer of Far Eastern poli
tics, also stated that the Chinese Na
tionalist forces, bastioned 600,000
strong on Formosa, and the ROK
700,000-man army are capable to
gether of uniting Korea and liberat
ing the people of Communist-dom
inated China with logistic support
only from the United States.
I WAR NOW"
"The only hope," he stated, of ac
| complishing this end, "is war, now."
| Choo feels that the collectivised
population of Red China has had a
i taste of Communism and is fed up
! with it. "If the Chinese Nationalists
could attack the mainland and take
one seaport," Chain# Kai-shek's
forces would receive sufficient sup
j port to wage a successful campaign
! against the present, revolutionary
! government. Another two years and
1 "it could be too late."
| Choo exclaimed angrily that. Korea
is "not two nations," but one na
tion divided against, her will; thai
I that, division is the making of the
I powerful nations who sat at, the
! peace-making conferences follow
i ing the United Nations action in
i Korea.
In fact, according to Choo, almost,
all of the notable figures in Korean
| government, including himself and
President Syngman Rhee, are natives
of the northern part of Korea.
PRESENT PROBLEMS
"Communist influence in the Re
public of Korea is nil," said Choo,
speaking of the problems that pres
! ently face the republic, and "Korean
1 attitude favors the United States "100
percent." The problem today is de
■ termining "who are the neutral na
| tions, and how neutral are they"
j who police the Korean truce.
Action by the United Nations to
j rehabilitate Korea was delayed for a
year by deliberations on the methods
of rebuilding the nation and by de
j termining such standards as an ex
| change rate for Korean money.

1 "it could be too late."
| Choo exclaimed angrily that. Korea
is "not two nations," but one na
tion divided against, her will; thai
I that, division is the making of the
I powerful nations who sat at, the

i ing the United Nations action in
i Korea.
In fact, according to Choo, almost,
all of the notable figures in Korean
| government, including himself and
President Syngman Rhee, are natives
of the northern part of Korea.
PRESENT PROBLEMS
"Communist influence in the Re
public of Korea is nil," said Choo,
speaking of the problems that pres
! ently face the republic, and "Korean
1 attitude favors the United States "100
percent." The problem today is de
■ termining "who are the neutral na
| tions, and how neutral are they"
j who police the Korean truce.
Action by the United Nations to
j rehabilitate Korea was delayed for a
year by deliberations on the methods
of rebuilding the nation and by de
j termining such standards as an ex
| change rate for Korean money.
"Don't be deceived that a so
j called United Nations fought
Communist aggression in Ko
rea,"
With these words. Young Han
Choo, Korean Consul General in
San Francisco, said that the Korean
War was a war between "two fac
tions of the United Nations, one led
by Russia, the other by the United
States."
The Korean diplomat spoke yester
day in an Institute of International
Relations sponsored talk before an
informal gathering at Bowman
Alumni House.
Choo, speaking sometimes as a
representative of the Republic of
Korea and sometimes "off the cuff"
as an observer of Far Eastern poli
tics, also stated that the Chinese Na
tionalist forces, bastioned 600,000
strong on Formosa, and the ROK
700,000-man army are capable to
gether of uniting Korea and liberat
ing the people of Communist-dom
inated China with logistic support
only from the United States.
I WAR NOW"
"The only hope," he stated, of ac
| complishing this end, "is war, now."
| Choo feels that the collectivised
population of Red China has had a
i taste of Communism and is fed up
! with it. "If the Chinese Nationalists
could attack the mainland and take
one seaport," Chain# Kai-shek's
forces would receive sufficient sup
j port to wage a successful campaign
! against the present, revolutionary
! government. Another two years and
1 "it could be too late."
