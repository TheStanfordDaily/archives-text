# Indian Quintet Meets Trojans In Pavilion Tonight, Tomorrow
## Irwin, Welsh To Spark SC 
### BILL NICHOLS Sports Editor, The Daily 
Staniord opens the second
halt of the Southern Division
basketball title chase tonight
when its cagers clash with the
USC Trojans in the first of a two
game series at the Pavilion. The
games start at 8:30 both tonight
and tomorrow.
The Cardinal cagers are currently
in a first-place tie with UCLA, while
the Forest Twogood-coached Tro
jans are one game back with a 2-2
record in third place.
The tilts will shed much light on
the eventual position of Stanford in
the conference race. If they can
get by the Figueroa Streeters, last
year's winners, the Indians have a
chance to go all the way. Other
wise Stanford will have to be con
tent to settle for second or third.
The games shape up as scoring
duels between eo - captains Runs
Lawler and Ron Tomsic of Stan
ford and co-captains Roy Irvin and
Dick Welsh of Southern California.
Irvin leads the Trojans with 2b2
points to date and scored 28 in their
last contest. He is on his way to
breaking*the all-time USC scoring
mark of 1.061 held by Bill Sharman,
since he already has dumped in 981
counters during his two-and-a-half
year career.
WELSH RANKS NEXT
Welsh ranks close behind the 6- >
Irvin with a 13.7 scoring average
jer game and holds the team to
gether with his play.
Tomsic and Lawler both score
higher than the SC aces, but USC
plays close possession basketball
which should hold down the scor
ing. And the Trojan bench is long.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar
says he fears this series will be sim
ilar to the .UCLA bouts. "We'll have
to go all out in the first game, and
then we'll be slowed down on Sat
urday night. And we will have to
do even a better than average job
on the boards, since the SCers won't
be throwing the ball away too
much," he said.
IRVIN VS. LAWLER
Commenting on the upcoming
duel between Irvin and Lawler,


THE CENTER ATTRACTlONâ€”Stanford's Russ Lawler and Southern California's Roy Irvin are
the rival centers in this weekend's basketball contests in the Pavilion. Trojan co-captain Irvin is
threatening to break the PCC Southern Division scoring record and is the visitor's main scoring
threat. Stanford will be counting on 6-6Vz Lawler to prevent the tall Trojans from controlling
the backboards. The games will start tonight and tomorrow at 8:30.

Dallmar said that Irvin was a much
improved player over last season,
but that Russ outplayed him in all
four games in 1954. The tall coach
also was worried that Tomsic and
5-8 George Selleck would be pulled
inside on defense by the Trojans.
The starting five for USC all stand
at least 6-2, which will put great de
fensive pressure on Barry Brown
and Lawler, the two cai'ds who can
stay wirfh the giants from Troy.
The probable starting lineup for
Southern California has Ralph Pau
sig, a junior from Oshkosh, Wiscon
sin, at one forward and either Tony
Psaltis from San Francisco or Jack
Dunne at the other. Pausig is a
deadeye free throw artist and a good
defensive man. Psaltis is a smooth

floor man but his scoring lias been
oft lately, and Dunne may get the
I starting call instead.
DEADLY lIOOK
Roy Irvin and his deadly hook
shot will operate from the center
slot. Chet Carr, another Northern
California phenom who has been a
thorn in Stanford's side for two
years, and Dick Welsh will go at the
guard spots. Jim Kaufman, Mike
Leaskou, and Dick Nagai form the
backbone of the Trojan bench.
The usual starters for Stanford
will be on the court at the tipoff.
Barry Brown and Bill Bond at for
wards, Russ Lawler at center, and
I Ron Tomsic and George Selleck at
j the guard spots.
