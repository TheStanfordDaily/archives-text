# most valuable privilege... an editorial
## 
### 
Wednesday night Excom heard a proposed
policy for the question of taking examinations
from the classroom. Presented by the Special
Honor Code Subcommittee, the proposal was
as follows:
"Provided adequate seating is available, tests
will only be taken from the classroom with
the consent of the instructor."
On the front page of today's Daily you will
see a st; . ment of policy on appearances of
obser of the Honor Code, drawn up by
the Council for Student Control, Fundamental
Standard Committee, and the subcommittee.
Basically, both measures arise out of one
problem: The Honor Code, which was set up
by the faculty's Academic Council at the re
quest of the students, is a privilege granted

to the student body, but the students have i
come more and more to regard this privilege!
as a right which cannot be denied. It can be
denied.

We must remember that the Honor Code is j
the most valuable privilege which Stanford \
students boast. We must be careful never to 1
endanger the continuing existence of the Hon
or Code in any way.
Next week Excom will take action on the
subcommittee proposal. The Daily will run
articles on the Honor Code program. Watch;
developments closely; we must all be aware j
what the Honor Code is and what its loss might!
i
mean.
The Honor Code is a privilege, not a right.
