Well, sir, Paris is at it again. At this writing
the fashion moguls (I like that word, moguls;
sounds like czars of crime and corruption) , , ,
the fashion moguls are right now busy with
their fashion shows, refuting what the fashion
moguls (great word) decreed last year.
The "H" line.
â–  I never did like the "H" line. A gentleman
by the name Mr. Christian Dior flattened made
moiselle from clavicle to pistol pocket. Thereby
defying natural law. Something neither I nor
Rennaisance philosophers could ever go along
with.
Well, I am happy to report that natural law
has come out the winner and the thorax has
been restored to its rightful place in fashion
plates and Ladies Home Journal. Although they
may have gone too far.
The United Press dispatch, filed from the
Paris bureau, made comment about the "well
rounded bosom and HIPS" of Miss 1955. I don't
know about this HIPS business. I drive a small,
old Ford coupe and there is just about room for
three. The broader of beam the passenger, the
less room for the passenger. And I like to

transport young ladies in large numbers.
But this is only a minor complaint. The bene
fits of the new, new look far outweigh the
liabilities. We will examine these benefits from
threfc viewpoints:
First, Mademoiselle herself. What does she
think of the new approach? MM in Hollywood
might well say "you couldn't suppress a thing
like that!" Or, Terry of the ermine bathing
suit could mutter "I told you so!" But the gal
next door will welcome the return to nature
as a good excuse to go overwork the old man's
charge account.
Second, the attitude of monsieur. Father De
vine will scold "outrageous." The New York
Bishop who sells television sets on video will
merely wink an eye. But the man around the
corner, while worried about his charge account,
will probably run out and buy a new pair of
glasses.
Third, how about the fashion designers
They, as a body, will chorus "MORE MONEY!
Moremoneymoremoneymoremoney."
But me? I'll just holler "huzzah!"
