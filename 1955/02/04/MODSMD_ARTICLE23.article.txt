# University Representatives Are Heard Wednesday at Three ST&T Meetings
## O'Brien: 3-Point Finance Program 
### 
Richard F. O'Brien, associate
general secretary, spoke at El
Capitan to members of the eat
ing club and Magnolia Casa resi
dents at one of Wednesday
night's "Stanford — Today and
Tomorrow" talks.
O'Brien remarked that "no tuition
was charged Stanford students until
1920 when the inflation in operating
expenses made the $21 million en
dowment insufficient. Charging tui
tion was the first step in a three
point program to raise funds for the
University."
The gift program, begun in 1936,
was the second step. Last year the
University received $4.5 million un
der the program. O'Brien stated that
"of this gift money about $2 million
carried special stipulations for its
use. Every free dollar is worth two
of the dollars that carry stipula
tions as to their use."
The third step in the three-point
program was that of University land
development.
Words of encouragement for the
women were given when O'Brien
informed the group that the new
women's dorm planned has first pri
ority now. This new dormitory,
planned as a sectional type building
built below the Knoll, will consist
of two structures each housing 400
women.
