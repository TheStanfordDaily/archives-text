# Glover: 'University Behind Fraternities'
## 
### 
In another "Stanford—Today and
Tomorrow" talk, Fred Glover, as
sistant to the president, told members
at Chi Psi Wednesday night that
"the University is behind the fra
ternity system and wants to help
them in all ways."
Glover asserted that the University

wanted to see a renovation program
for fraternities set up in the near
future.
He. said many structures were in
pooi- condition and that the houses
would have to do something to com
bat the competition of better living
conditions that will be offered by
new dormitories, especially Ray Ly
man Wilbur Hall and Stern Hall.
Glover, former star boxer and
Stanford fraternity man, said houses
faced a real problem in trying to
raise funds lor rebuilding and ex
pansion. Under the present tax sys
tem all gifts to fraternities are not
tax deductible. This means the gov
ernment takes a large chunk out of
every gift. Donors aren't too eager
to make gifts under these conditions.
"The University is willing to go
along with fraternities, however, and
make loans to them," said Glover.
"Fraternities are stronger right now
than they have been in a long time,
but they still have a lot to do. They
have to start putting some of their

jrctivity leadership into their houses.
We want to help them, but they must
help themselves."
Glover's main discourse was on
land development. He briefly cov
ered the building activity in Stan
ford's light industrial tract and
Regional Shopping Center. He add
ed that the Administration had a
hard time deciding the name of the
shopping center, stating amusingly
that they were torn between the
present title and "Leland and Jane's
Place."
He also touched briefly on campus
dormitory construction, future wo
men's residences, and the new post
oflice, student union, book store,
road revision, and music builditr:.
