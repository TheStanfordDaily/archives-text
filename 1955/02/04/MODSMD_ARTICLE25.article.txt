# Dodds: 'Stanford Has Snob Appeal'
## 
### 
Dr. John Dodds, head of the
humanities honors program, spoke
at the Kappa Alpha house on the
subject of academics in a third
"Stanford â€” Today and- Tomorrow"
discussion.
To the question "Why is Stanford
better than Cal?" Dodds answered
that it is a question of the relative
merits of public and private educa
tion.
"Private institutions," he said,
"benefit the state institutions by
maintaining high intellectual stand
ards. The public universities under
take to educate the larger number of
people, which the private institu
tions are not designed to handle.
It is not a question of good versus
bad. The systems are comple
mentary, and both are necessary to
balance our country's education.
"Stanford is preferred for a num
ber of reasons. Among these are that
Stanford has 'snob appeal' and is
small in size, which gives it special
flavor."
In regard to English courses,
Dodds said that the courses are sup
erficial in nature because Stanford
allows only two quarters for the
course, whereas most universities
allow two semesters.
