COP's varsity rugby team is al
most completely made up of football
players, according to Stanford's
coach Pete Kmotovic, but they lack
experience in rugby playing. They
have a small, fast, tricky backfield,
however, that is valuable in rugby
playing.
Card standouts so far this season
have been: John Stanton, who has
made a fine comeback after being
out for a year after a car accident;
John Doyle, who did a very good job
against the Olympic Club; and Dor
sev Atkinson whose kicking has been
a big win factor for the team.
Dewey Tompkins and Don Cornell
are two COP backfield standouts
who will try to make the Indians'
trip a discouraging one.
