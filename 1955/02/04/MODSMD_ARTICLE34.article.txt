# Frosh Flay Two Games
## 
### 
Coach Dick Clegg's frosh cagers
meet the lough Santa Clara frosh
and Washington High of San Fran
ci.-co in preliminaries to the varsity
games in the Pavilion tonight and
tomorrow night.
The Santa Clara frosh, who have
lost only one game, tangle with the
Indian frosh tonight. The single
Santa Clara loss was to Lowell
High, a team which the Papooses
defeated several weeks ago.
However, Clegg rates the junior
Broncos as a tough hurdle for the
frosh to get over because of three
outstanding players on the Santa
Clara squad. They are Walt Har
rison, 6-5 center, and guards Ray
Paxlon ;:ul Gary Gilmore.
Paxton ;nd Gilmore were both
all-city prep stars in San Francisco
last year. Clegg rates Gilmore "high
as a dribbler and individual player.
Wa iiington High, which meets the
frosh tomorrow night, has only a
fair record. The Eagles have won
two and lost three in the San Fran
cisco prep league and do not figure
to give the frosh too much of a
tussle.
Clegg named co - captains Clint
Waring and Gary Van Galder, Jay
Jackson, Dean Thoyias, and Tony
Vigna to his starting lineup for the
weekend clashes. The rapid im
provement of second-string center
Lee Leonard brought praise from i
Clegg, who indicated that the lanky j
pivotman would see plenty of ac- '
tion. Mike Gray is also ticketed for
heavv dutv.
