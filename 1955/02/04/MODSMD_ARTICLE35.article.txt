# SC Has Edge In All-Time Game Series
## 
### 
Stanford and USC go into their
J series this weekend with USC hold
j ing an all-time edge over the In
| dians in games won, 61-49. In the
la -1 five seasons the Troymen hold *
the edge, 13-7.
Some interesting highlights ap- ]
pear in the records of past compe
tition of the two teams. In 193G
Stanford and SC tied for the South
ern Division championship but the
Cards, leJ by the great Hank Lui- |
setti, won the playoff with two [
straight wins.
In 1953 in Los AngeleÂ«, the Tro-
I ians won the Friday night game,
1 93-5(5, thereby racking up a new
conference one-game scoring rec
ord. However, the Cards came back
the next night on the sensational
-hooting of Ron Tomsic to win 76-
! 74. Tomsic rang up 38 points in that
I game to tie the individual one-game i
j scoring record.
Last season the Indians split with
SC's conference champions in four
close games. The teams traded two
j point victories in Los Angeles and
! split in the Pavilion, with SC taking
! the first garfle, 57-53, and Stanford
| winning the second, 72-67.
The teams will square oft' tonight
j and tomorrow night with Stanford
| being much stronger than last year
! and SC having virtually the same
team that came on with a rush at
the close of last season to go all the
way to the semi-finals of the NCala
! championships.
