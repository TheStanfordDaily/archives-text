HCWIE AND TWOGIEâ€”The brains of the Stanford and Trojan
squads are head coaches Howie Dallmar and Forrest Twogood.
Dallmar, former head mentor at Pennsylvania, has favorably im
pressed basketball fans with his poised handling of a team he
had never seen play until the opening of the season. Twogood,
the veteran SC coach has long been known for his shrewd
handling of the Figueroa Street squad, which surprised every
one by reaching the NCAA semi-finals last year.
