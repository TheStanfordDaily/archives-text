# Stanford Teamwork Drubs USC Cagers, 92-78, 76-60
## Tomsic Pumps In 67 Points To Set Two Scoring Marks 
### BILL NICHOLS Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford's basketball team remained in a first-place tie with
UCLA this weekend, thanks to a sweep of the USC series. The
Cards won Friday, 92-78, and romped, 76-60, Saturday. •
Pointwise they were both one-man victories, with Ron Tomsic
scoring from all over the floor, but even more important than

Tomsic's two new records- was the
team play, which hit a new high
over the weekend.
There were two individual rec
ords set in the two games. Tomsic
set a new Southern Division scor
ing Thark with his 40 points Friday,
but is still behind the all-time Stan
ford mark set by Hank Luisetti of
50 against Duquesne and the North
ern Division mark of 49 which was
set by the Washington Huskies' Bob
Houbregs.
CAREER MARK
Tomsic also eraspd Luisctti's ca
reer record of 1,297 points set in
1936-38. Luisetti still holds the four
year mark, though, as he made
enough points in his freshman year
to put him up in the 1,500 bracket.
Tomsic's injury last year practically
precludes him from breaking that
one.
USC just didn't have a chance ei
ther night. Russ Lawler held the
highly publicized Roy Irvin to just
11 points in two games. Bill Bond
scored 15 points Friday night and
did a terrific job on the boards.
George Selleck played his usual
hustling floor game and added 12
points to the Stanford Friday night
92-point total that was a new Car
dinal record in conference games.
Ron Tomsic and Barry Brown
were just invaluable. Tomsic scored
67 points in the encounters. He
sank 23 out of .'33 from the floor for
70 per cent and swished 21 out of
22 from the free throw line for 95.5
per cent.
Barry Brown did his job admir
ably also. He eased the rebounding
load of Russ Lawler considerably
against the big rough Trojans. He
bagged 19 loo.se balls on the back
boards, and Lawler corralled 16
more to dominate in that depart
ment.
RESERYE STItENGTII
Another heartening department
was the development of the re
serves. Leo Schwaiger moved right
in and looked very sharp, and Hap
Wagner played smoothly while he
operated on the court.
Tomsic was little short of unstop
pable. It wasn't a case of feeding
him for the record, he just hit al
most every time he let go of the

ball. His knee does hamper him on
defense somewhat, but he more than
makes up for it on offense. The
Trojans were giving him a roueh
time both nights, but he showed
them up in the scoring column.
The team defense showed sur
prisingly well. Lawler got up to
block several of Irvin's hoolfs, and
the only SCcr that could score with
any consistency was Dick Welsh.
Chet Carr was hot Friday but did
nothing the next night.
CRUCIAL
The big test for Stanford is next
weekend. The Cards play UCLA
twice in the stuffy, smoke - filled
Westwood gym. UCLA also has a
5-1 conference record and will be
very, very tough.

hustling floor game and added 12
points to the Stanford Friday night
92-point total that was a new Car
dinal record in conference games.
Ron Tomsic and Barry Brown
were just invaluable. Tomsic scored
67 points in the encounters. He
sank 23 out of .'33 from the floor for
70 per cent and swished 21 out of
22 from the free throw line for 95.5
per cent.
Barry Brown did his job admir
ably also. He eased the rebounding
load of Russ Lawler considerably
against the big rough Trojans. He
bagged 19 loo.se balls on the back
boards, and Lawler corralled 16
more to dominate in that depart
ment.
RESERYE STItENGTII
Another heartening department
was the development of the re
serves. Leo Schwaiger moved right
in and looked very sharp, and Hap
Wagner played smoothly while he
operated on the court.
Tomsic was little short of unstop
pable. It wasn't a case of feeding
him for the record, he just hit al
most every time he let go of the

ball. His knee does hamper him on
defense somewhat, but he more than
makes up for it on offense. The
Trojans were giving him a roueh
time both nights, but he showed
them up in the scoring column.
The team defense showed sur
prisingly well. Lawler got up to
block several of Irvin's hoolfs, and
the only SCcr that could score with
any consistency was Dick Welsh.
Chet Carr was hot Friday but did
nothing the next night.
CRUCIAL
The big test for Stanford is next
weekend. The Cards play UCLA
twice in the stuffy, smoke - filled
Westwood gym. UCLA also has a
5-1 conference record and will be
very, very tough.
Stanford's basketball team remained in a first-place tie with
UCLA this weekend, thanks to a sweep of the USC series. The
Cards won Friday, 92-78, and romped, 76-60, Saturday. •
Pointwise they were both one-man victories, with Ron Tomsic
scoring from all over the floor, but even more important than

Tomsic's two new records- was the
team play, which hit a new high
over the weekend.
There were two individual rec
ords set in the two games. Tomsic
set a new Southern Division scor
ing Thark with his 40 points Friday,
but is still behind the all-time Stan
ford mark set by Hank Luisetti of
50 against Duquesne and the North
ern Division mark of 49 which was
set by the Washington Huskies' Bob
Houbregs.
CAREER MARK
Tomsic also eraspd Luisctti's ca
reer record of 1,297 points set in
1936-38. Luisetti still holds the four
year mark, though, as he made
enough points in his freshman year
to put him up in the 1,500 bracket.
Tomsic's injury last year practically
precludes him from breaking that
one.
USC just didn't have a chance ei
ther night. Russ Lawler held the
highly publicized Roy Irvin to just
11 points in two games. Bill Bond
scored 15 points Friday night and
did a terrific job on the boards.
George Selleck played his usual
hustling floor game and added 12
points to the Stanford Friday night
92-point total that was a new Car
dinal record in conference games.
