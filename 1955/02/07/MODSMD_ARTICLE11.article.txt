# Juniors to Open Charity Drive Today with ‘Quad Penny Mile'
## Three Groups to Benefit From Copper Campaign 
### 
Fifty-one thousand pennies laid side by side around Outer Quad
is the goal for today as the Junior Class Activities Board launches
its push for the "Penny-Mile," urging Farm students to "give your
common cents to charity."
"Penny-Day" will kick off the week-long Winter Quarter Charity

• Drive. Proceeds from the drive will
go to the World University Service,
the Red Cross, and the Free Univer- j
sity of Berlin.
The "Penny-Mile" will begin to
i form at 7:30 this morning between
I the four corners of Quad. The
j "Mile" will progress toward the i
; corners of the Quad, so that there
i will be eight places for students to I
1 help "copper the Quad." Change will j
be available for those with rio pen- '
i nies, and, in addition, both the
J Book.store and the Cellar will give i
I change partially in pennies today, j
! Those who do not have time to lay
their pennies themselves can give
j them to the juniors working on the
| "Mile," who will add the coppers to
| the chain during classes.
"NOT A FULL MILE"
Actually the distance around Out- 1
j or Quad is not a full mile. Juniors
have taped it at 3,212 feet. At 16
pennies a foot, it will take 51,392
cents to complete the circuit.
Members of the Junior Activities
Board hope to complete the penny
path by 3:30 this afternoon. The
coins will be swept up with big
brooms, shoveled into containers,
and taken to the athletic department
where they will be put through the
counting machine used for game re
ceipts. The real work begins wWen |
the pennies are wrapped in standard |
50-cent rolls.
Living group solicitations for the J
Drive begin tonight in living groups,
in an attempt to reach the goal of j
$6,000 set by drive chairman Fred j
j Ruhland.
j SENIOR AUCTION
There are several other innova- 1
tions connected with the drive. The
senior class excom will auction off
a harem of beautiful coeds to the
j highest bidders in front of the
Bookstore Friday. The girls will per-
I form hashing chores for one meal
for any campus living group.
Information concerning the re
cipients of the proceeds of the drive
will be disseminated by a speakers'
service under the direction of the
ASSU Speech Association. Axe So
ciety will handle off-campus solici
tations.
The organization of the "Penny-
Mile," with its 480 pounds of pen
nies, is being handled by John
Schacht, Sandy Simons, R. D. Ai
kins, Ben Harris, Bruce McPhee, and
A 1 Gulick.
