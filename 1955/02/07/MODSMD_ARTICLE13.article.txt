# Student Work Won Honor Code Privileges

### HELEN DEWAR 
The problem of interpretation
nl" the Honor Code has been one
lliat has confronted the Stanford
student for many years and has
especially come to focus durin,-?
the last year as a special ASSU
sub-committee under Ann Irvine
was set up to grapple with the
problem of taking examination*
from the class room.
Miss Irvine and her committee
last week submitted a report to
the Executive Committee of their
findings and this Wednesday night
the Committee will vote on the
proposal that hereafter tests will
be taken from the examination
room only with the consent of the
instructor.
The following is the first in a
series of three articles on the de
velopment of the Honor Code
from its enactment in 1021 to the
present time.—Editor

"The Honor Code is a privi
lege, not a right ...
"It depends on each and every
student to uphold the word and
spirit of the Code, not only by
maintaining purely honorable

conduct in his own academic en
deavor, but also by seeing to it
that other students seek to up
hold the system of academic lib
erty that has been earned and
protected for his own benefit
through the years."
These arc often-heard words on
the Stanford campus; bul., more than
this, these are word.s directly ex
pressing the fundamentals of our
student government—a. type of or
ganization based on belief in the
personal integrity of the Stanford
individual.
This Code was adopted on May 24,
.1921, as a result of mounting agita
tion on the part of the students to
convince the administration that
they were capable of substituting
personal honor for a proctor system
in the conduct of examinations. *
As early as 1904, eight years be
fore student government, itself was
established, students had begun
working for the enactment of an
honor system. In 1912, the admin
istration granted the student body
a system of partial student govern
ment., placing the execution of its
policies and affairs under the limited
control ol ihe faculty.

The students were spurred on by
this initial victory and the fact that
it was the expressed belief of David
Starr Jordan, then Chancellor of the
University, that the student - man
aged system was successful, its only
weakness rising from the lack of
interest among the great body of
students.
Those seeking a University-wide
policy were given a fresh arguing
point when, after World War I. re
turning veterans complained that
dishonest, conduct in examinations
was flourishing. They offered an ob
vious solution — an honor code to
work from the inside, so to speak,
relying on and developing the men
tal and moral character of the stu
dent.
In 1921, fervor reached an all
time high. Petitions were signed by
a large proportion of the students
asking the faculty to allow them to
administer the conduct, of examina
tions under a system based on indi
vidual integrity.
Seeing the intense and honest
drive on the part of the students
to fulfill their ends, Ray Lyman
Wilbur, then president of the Uni
versity, declared that "when the
students want an honor system bad
ly enough to ask for it, they can

have it."
Then, on May 21, 1921. thr follow
ing item appeared on the front page
of the Daily Palo Alto: "The Stan
ford faculty, acting upon a petition
from the students, has approved the
plan for an honor system in exami
nations throughout the University.
Thus the Honor Code, now often
blandly accepted, was awarded to
diligent and hard-working students
who accepted the initiative to make
it a working institution within the
University.
Under the Code, as it stood then
and as it stands now, the proctor
system was replaced by the honor
system, the full maintenance and
discipline of the Code being placed
in the hands of the students.
A body elected by the students
was to try all suspected violations
of the Code, although a final ap
peal could always be made to the
Dean of Students or the president.
President Wilbur, commenting on
the working of the Code, once re
marked that "if the initiative had
not been placed with the students,
the Code would have failed. Within
the resulting development of men
tal character lies the system's
strength."
