## 
### DAVE BROWNWOOD 
The junior class executive committee Thursday night voted
strongly in favor of the proposed addition to the Honor Code
which was presented by Ann Irvine to the ASSU Executive Com
mittee Wednesday night.
The proposal, which reads, "Provided adequate seating is avail-

able, tests shall be taken from the
classroom only with the consent of
the professor," was almost unani
mously supported by the group in
a stra\Â£ vote following a short dis
cussion.
In what also might be a preview
of ASSU Excom action this Wednes
day, the class excom took a stand
on* the major question regarding
constitutional revision by support
ing the plan for a legislature of
approximately 35 members as op
posed to one of approximately 20
members.
The group has had several long
discussions on the problems con
nected with the current constitu
tional revision, and in the two most
recent discussions has talked over
in particular the problem of a large
as opposed to a small legislature.
After half an hour of discussion
Thursday, the excom supported a
large legislature by a vote of 14 to 7.
Jim Pingree reported on the plans
for the Junior Prom; which will be
held April 15 at Castlewood Country
Club.
