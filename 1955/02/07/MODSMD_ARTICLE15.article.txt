"Reunification is the basic wish of
all Germans, but they don't know
how it will come about," said Hel
mut R. Boeninger, assistant profes
sor of German, at a recent meeting
of the Young Democrats of the
Stanford Area.
Boeninger based his talk on ob
servations he made last spring while
he traveled through Germany as a
guest of the Bonn government.
"Reunification is one of the big
propaganda points of the Commu
nists," the speaker said. "They hold
it out as bait to the German people."
"While the predominant wish of
the Germans is for reunification,
they ron't think it can be accom
plished without war," he stated.
'"Rearmament will be a fact very
shortly," he said. "However, reuni
fication will move into the far dis
tant future as a result of rearma
ment."
"The Communists are trying to
tempt the Germans to form a Euro
pean defense community without
the United States," said Boeninger.
"Adenauer's idea is first to get
weapons and then to talk to the
Communists, while the •Communist
idea is to talk first and then not re
arm."
"Traditionalism is found every
where in German life," the speaker
stated. "The attitude of the people
is 'We've done it this way and we
will do i! this way'."
