### MARILYN FELLER 
The recital of 18th century tona
tas for violin and harpsichord, pre
sented by Sandor Salgo and Put
nam Aldrich yesterday afternoon,
was a delightful and thrilling musi
cal experience for the audience that
filled Cubberley Auditorium.
The sonatas performed wei" "So
nata in A Major" by Johann Sebas
tian Bach, "Sonata in A Major" by
Jean-Marie Leclair, and "Sonata in
F Major, K. 376" by Mozart. The
different concepts of the form and
styles represented by the c work.-,
were made fully clear by the per
forming artists.
Both Aldrich and S !go . <-.r ed
to have given great and special ( re
to the problems of aiticul ion in
the different works. The result vv. .
an arficulateness of performance,
achieved by Aldrich's powerful ;n 1
precise rhythmic distinctness, lv t -
wonderfully varied tone qu; Hie
which Professor Salgo could obi ; n
from the violin, and also by the
wide range of dynamic ni' ii r->-
which both performers exploited
Salgo's virtuoso ability was cv i
dent in the performance of the I -
clair* sonata. The rapid passage tin
ornaments, and the arpeggios v *
performed with elegance; Salgo':
own cadenzas were refined but not
too restrained.
