Six thousand dollars.

That's the goal set by Drives Committee for
Stanford's Winter Quarter Charity Drive for
1955, which begins today. Today they will be
paving the Quad with copper—a mile of pen
nies!—and all week drive workers will be ask
ing Stanford students and faculty to contribute.
The drive is international in orientation. Pro
ceeds will be divided between World Uni
versity Service, Red Cross, and the Free Uni
versity of Berlin. And what better cause for
Americans today is there than international

amity and international cooperative aid?
Last week Stanford heard the Western Col
lege Conference on American foreign policy,
where international partnership and the dignity
of man were stressed as objectives of that for
eign policy. This week Stanford gets its op
portunity to join that policy.
So support the Charity -Drive! If everyone
gives, your individual share of the quota will
be less than a dollar, and that's little enough
to pay toward the ultimate goal of international
friendship and world peace.
