# Nazi Persecution Causes Weinstein's Flight to U.S.
## 
### MIKE McGINNIS 
You can get a pretty good idea
of what a professor is like by
taking his classes, but it is a
common misconception that pro
fessors have always taught
classes.
Take Leo Weinstein, assistant
professor of French, for example.
He was born in Northern Germany
in 1921, and he went to school until
he \yas 15. Even though he was an
excellent student he couldn't con
tinue his education, because his
faith is Jewish, and the Nazis didn't
approve.
He made up his mind to come to
America. However, in accordance
with American law, he needed as
surances from relatives in this
country that he wouldn't become a
public charge when he arrived. He
wrote his relatives during 1938 in
the Shakespearean English that he
had been taught. '"It was a quaint,
school book language," Professor
Weinstein recalls, "and it must have
amused them because they helped
me out."
MEMORIZATION
For two years he worked in Ger
many preparing for his departure.
He went through the English dic
tionary from A to Z, learning every
word he didn't know, even the tech
nical ones. He learned Italian too,
because he thought that Italy might
be his destination.
Weinstein left Germany with his
brother in 1938 just in time. Four
months later his father was impris
oned as the Germans began their
mass persecution program.
When he arrived in New York he
was 17 years old. He went to work
as an armature winder—a trade he
picked-up in Germany just for such
an emergency—and went to night
school to get required subjects for
college. Night school at New York
City College was next, while he did
odd jobs for eating money.
The result of this desire for edu

cation was a scholarship to Florida
Southern College, where he studied
until drafted in 1942.
Pie was placed in the Army Spe
cial Training Program, due to his
language background, and was sent
to Georgetown University to study.
He wanted to study math, but there
is only the "army way" of doing
things. They stuck him in beginning
German. "We used to play cards
in class," Weinstein said.
GOOD RATIO
At night the students climbed the
campus walls and hiked into Wash
ington, D.C. 'The city had eight
women for every man," he recalls
fondly. "It wag great while it lasted,
but one day a student slipped and
spoke perfect German in class. They
threw us all into Italian."
He was sent to the war theater in
Europe soon after, and with sound
equipment, broadcast propaganda
across the German lines and made
military announcements in freshly
occupied towns.
When the U.S. forces occupied the

I city of Hanover, Weiivitein recalls,
j he was to take his sound truck into |
a newly won section of the city and j
| make his usual broadcast. He and j
I his driver were told to take the j
I second turn off the autobahn into j
! the city.
The route was destroyed so they
) went further down the road and
took the third one. The section of j
j the city they arrived in was com- j
pletely deserted. '"People started
coming out of the buildings, stared
lat us with disbelief," Professor
Weinstein said, "and we suddenly
j realized that we were the first
j Americans in that section of the
city. We drove for 20 minutes with
! out seeing an M.P. We couldn't have !
! missed the retreating Germans by
more than half an hour."
PROMOTION
With the peace, Weinstein was as- j
! signed as producer of a German ra
| dio station in Munich. "One day I
J played some Benny Goodman when
I our relay program didn't come in [
J jazz, 1 ' he explained.
In 194(> he came home and re- ,
I ceived an A.B. degree at Florida |
Southern College. lie came to Stan- '
ford in 1947; was awarded an M.A.
tion covering the legend of Don
Juan.
He played soccer for Stanford j
during 1948 and 1950, and was cap- [
tain both years. He has also coached j
the Stanford team.
Lately he has been working on a ;
biography of the 19th century I
French composer Ernest Chausson,
which will bo published this spring, j
Weinstein also plans fcu publish his

LEO WEINSTEIN
—Fled from the Nazis
You can get a pretty good idea
of what a professor is like by
taking his classes, but it is a
common misconception that pro
fessors have always taught
classes.
Take Leo Weinstein, assistant
professor of French, for example.
He was born in Northern Germany
in 1921, and he went to school until
he \yas 15. Even though he was an
excellent student he couldn't con
tinue his education, because his
faith is Jewish, and the Nazis didn't
approve.
He made up his mind to come to
America. However, in accordance
with American law, he needed as
surances from relatives in this
country that he wouldn't become a
public charge when he arrived. He
wrote his relatives during 1938 in
the Shakespearean English that he
had been taught. '"It was a quaint,
school book language," Professor
Weinstein recalls, "and it must have
amused them because they helped
me out."
MEMORIZATION
For two years he worked in Ger
many preparing for his departure.
He went through the English dic
tionary from A to Z, learning every
word he didn't know, even the tech
nical ones. He learned Italian too,
because he thought that Italy might
be his destination.
Weinstein left Germany with his
brother in 1938 just in time. Four
months later his father was impris
oned as the Germans began their
mass persecution program.
When he arrived in New York he
was 17 years old. He went to work
as an armature winder—a trade he
picked-up in Germany just for such
an emergency—and went to night
school to get required subjects for
college. Night school at New York
City College was next, while he did
odd jobs for eating money.
The result of this desire for edu

cation was a scholarship to Florida
Southern College, where he studied
until drafted in 1942.
Pie was placed in the Army Spe
cial Training Program, due to his
language background, and was sent
to Georgetown University to study.
He wanted to study math, but there
is only the "army way" of doing
things. They stuck him in beginning
German. "We used to play cards
in class," Weinstein said.
GOOD RATIO
At night the students climbed the
campus walls and hiked into Wash
ington, D.C. 'The city had eight
women for every man," he recalls
fondly. "It wag great while it lasted,
but one day a student slipped and
spoke perfect German in class. They
threw us all into Italian."
He was sent to the war theater in
Europe soon after, and with sound
equipment, broadcast propaganda
across the German lines and made
military announcements in freshly
occupied towns.
When the U.S. forces occupied the

I city of Hanover, Weiivitein recalls,
j he was to take his sound truck into |
a newly won section of the city and j
| make his usual broadcast. He and j
I his driver were told to take the j
I second turn off the autobahn into j
! the city.
The route was destroyed so they
) went further down the road and
took the third one. The section of j
j the city they arrived in was com- j
pletely deserted. '"People started
coming out of the buildings, stared
lat us with disbelief," Professor
Weinstein said, "and we suddenly
j realized that we were the first
j Americans in that section of the
city. We drove for 20 minutes with
! out seeing an M.P. We couldn't have !
! missed the retreating Germans by
more than half an hour."
PROMOTION
With the peace, Weinstein was as- j
! signed as producer of a German ra
| dio station in Munich. "One day I
J played some Benny Goodman when
I our relay program didn't come in [
J jazz, 1 ' he explained.
In 194(> he came home and re- ,
I ceived an A.B. degree at Florida |

LEO WEINSTEIN
—Fled from the Nazis
You can get a pretty good idea
of what a professor is like by
taking his classes, but it is a
common misconception that pro
fessors have always taught
classes.
Take Leo Weinstein, assistant
professor of French, for example.
He was born in Northern Germany
in 1921, and he went to school until
he \yas 15. Even though he was an
excellent student he couldn't con
tinue his education, because his
faith is Jewish, and the Nazis didn't
approve.
He made up his mind to come to
America. However, in accordance
with American law, he needed as
surances from relatives in this
country that he wouldn't become a
public charge when he arrived. He
wrote his relatives during 1938 in
the Shakespearean English that he
had been taught. '"It was a quaint,
school book language," Professor
Weinstein recalls, "and it must have
amused them because they helped
me out."
MEMORIZATION
For two years he worked in Ger
many preparing for his departure.
He went through the English dic
tionary from A to Z, learning every
word he didn't know, even the tech
nical ones. He learned Italian too,
because he thought that Italy might
be his destination.
Weinstein left Germany with his
brother in 1938 just in time. Four
months later his father was impris
oned as the Germans began their
mass persecution program.
When he arrived in New York he
was 17 years old. He went to work
as an armature winder—a trade he
picked-up in Germany just for such
an emergency—and went to night
school to get required subjects for
college. Night school at New York
City College was next, while he did
odd jobs for eating money.
The result of this desire for edu

cation was a scholarship to Florida
Southern College, where he studied
until drafted in 1942.
Pie was placed in the Army Spe
cial Training Program, due to his
language background, and was sent
to Georgetown University to study.
He wanted to study math, but there
is only the "army way" of doing
things. They stuck him in beginning
German. "We used to play cards
in class," Weinstein said.
GOOD RATIO
At night the students climbed the
campus walls and hiked into Wash
ington, D.C. 'The city had eight
women for every man," he recalls
fondly. "It wag great while it lasted,
but one day a student slipped and
spoke perfect German in class. They
threw us all into Italian."
He was sent to the war theater in
Europe soon after, and with sound
equipment, broadcast propaganda
across the German lines and made
military announcements in freshly
occupied towns.
When the U.S. forces occupied the

I city of Hanover, Weiivitein recalls,
j he was to take his sound truck into |
a newly won section of the city and j
| make his usual broadcast. He and j
I his driver were told to take the j
I second turn off the autobahn into j
! the city.
The route was destroyed so they
) went further down the road and
took the third one. The section of j
j the city they arrived in was com- j
pletely deserted. '"People started
coming out of the buildings, stared
lat us with disbelief," Professor
Weinstein said, "and we suddenly
j realized that we were the first
j Americans in that section of the
city. We drove for 20 minutes with
! out seeing an M.P. We couldn't have !
! missed the retreating Germans by
more than half an hour."
