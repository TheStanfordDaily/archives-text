# Cards Win Two from Inept SC
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON PHIL BERMAN 
It was all Ron Tomsic Friday night as the Cards won 92-78. The
great little guard had the best night of his spectacular college ca
reer as he broke his old PCC scoring record of 38 and set the new
mark at 40.
Tomsic hit on 14 for 18 field goal attempts, a blazing 78 per cent,

and bucketed 12 out of 13 free throw
attempts to tally his 40.
Coach Howie Dallmar took Tom
sic out of the game with r.bout a j
minute left when he cleared the j
bench. However, on finding out that |
Tomsic had tied the record, Dallmar
sent him back into the game to shoot
for the record. There were scant
seconds remaining, and SC had
three men on Tomsic. Remarkable
Ron got away one shot and missed,
but then an over - eager Trojan
fouled. Ron stepped up to the line
and sank both tosses.
NEW RECORD
Tomsic tied the former record, set
by UCLA's Ed Sheldrake against
Stanford in 1951, when he hit for 38
points against USC at Los Angeles.
Cal's Dick Tamberg tied the record
at Berkeley against Stanford last
year, but couldn't get past the 38-
point level.
As a unit Stanford hit 57 per cent
from the floor and 80 per cent from
the free throw line. They led Troy
all the way.
The Trojans never generated a se
rious threat until the second half.
They came back onto the floor 30-40
behind and promptly cut the margin
to five points before Stanford scored
a point.
The partisan Pavilion crowd was,
ginning to really worry when
Stanford's lead was cut to a meager
three points with 12 minutes left in
the game. Then George Selleck
whisked through a set shot from 25
feet out. Tomsic scored two on a
layup, and Selleck flipped in two
charity tosses.
Lanky g\Ard Chet Carr was most
effective' for SC. Carr netted six
field goals and six free throws for 18
points.

Stanford's basketballers completed their sweep of the weekend
series with Southern California Saturday night by breezing to an
76 to 60 victory over the inept Trojans.
Once again it was Ron Tomsic —Mr. Accuracy himself—who
paced the Indian triumph. Tcmsic meshed nine field goals in 15

attempts and tanked nine free
throws in the same number of at
tempts to total 27 points for the
evening.
Runner -up to Tomsic for the
Cards was Russ Lawler. who ac
counted for 19 points—l 4 of them in
the first half—and did a yeoman job
on the boards.
CARD WALKAWAY
The game was no contest after the
first four minutes when SC held the
Indians to a G-6 tie. Then Lawler
took control of both backboards and
combining with the sharpshooting of
Tomsic, Barry Brown, and Bill
Bond, gave Stanford a 24 to 12 lead
midway through the first half, and
the Trojans never were closer than
nine points after that.
USC seemed unable to buy a bas
ket, through the remainder of the
half, as they played very sloppy ball.
Stanford took full advantage of ev
ery USC slip, and soon enjoyed a 40
to 20 bulge. By half-time it was
42 to 24.
TOMSIC AGAIN
The Trojans made their last bid
midway through the second half
when everyone on the Card quintet
cooled off but Tomsic. Ron account
ed for all the Stanford points
through the first eight minutes of
the half.
Dick Welsh and Ralph Pausig led
the Trojan rally which cut the In
dian margin to 52 to 43 with 12 min
utes to play in the game.
However, Tomsic and Lawler re
taliated to lead a drive which put
Stanford safely in front GG lo 45 witli
a little better than five minutes to
go. At that point. Stanford coach
Howie Dallmar cleared his bench.
Co-captain Dick Welsh topped the
Southern California scorers with 18
points, while the other co-captain,
center Roy Irvin, who played what
was probably the worst game of his
collegiate career, was limited to
three.
The Indians sank 25 field goals in
59 attempts for 43 per cent, while
SC could manage only 21 of G4 tries
from the field for 33 per cent.

the big center is the Trojan's Tony Psaltis.

through the first eight minutes of
the half.
Dick Welsh and Ralph Pausig led
the Trojan rally which cut the In

Stanford safely in front GG lo 45 witli
a little better than five minutes to

Howie Dallmar cleared his bench.
Co-captain Dick Welsh topped the
Southern California scorers with 18
points, while the other co-captain,
center Roy Irvin, who played what
was probably the worst game of his
collegiate career, was limited to

59 attempts for 43 per cent, while
SC could manage only 21 of G4 tries
from the field for 33 per cent.

It was all Ron Tomsic Friday night as the Cards won 92-78. The
great little guard had the best night of his spectacular college ca
reer as he broke his old PCC scoring record of 38 and set the new
mark at 40.
Tomsic hit on 14 for 18 field goal attempts, a blazing 78 per cent,

and bucketed 12 out of 13 free throw
attempts to tally his 40.
Coach Howie Dallmar took Tom
sic out of the game with r.bout a j
minute left when he cleared the j
bench. However, on finding out that |
Tomsic had tied the record, Dallmar
sent him back into the game to shoot
for the record. There were scant
seconds remaining, and SC had
three men on Tomsic. Remarkable
Ron got away one shot and missed,
but then an over - eager Trojan
fouled. Ron stepped up to the line
and sank both tosses.
NEW RECORD
Tomsic tied the former record, set
by UCLA's Ed Sheldrake against
Stanford in 1951, when he hit for 38
points against USC at Los Angeles.
Cal's Dick Tamberg tied the record
at Berkeley against Stanford last
year, but couldn't get past the 38-
point level.
As a unit Stanford hit 57 per cent
from the floor and 80 per cent from
the free throw line. They led Troy
all the way.
The Trojans never generated a se
rious threat until the second half.
They came back onto the floor 30-40
behind and promptly cut the margin
to five points before Stanford scored
a point.
The partisan Pavilion crowd was,
ginning to really worry when
Stanford's lead was cut to a meager
three points with 12 minutes left in
the game. Then George Selleck
whisked through a set shot from 25
feet out. Tomsic scored two on a
layup, and Selleck flipped in two
charity tosses.
Lanky g\Ard Chet Carr was most
effective' for SC. Carr netted six
field goals and six free throws for 18
points.

Stanford's basketballers completed their sweep of the weekend
series with Southern California Saturday night by breezing to an
76 to 60 victory over the inept Trojans.
Once again it was Ron Tomsic —Mr. Accuracy himself—who
paced the Indian triumph. Tcmsic meshed nine field goals in 15

attempts and tanked nine free
throws in the same number of at
tempts to total 27 points for the
evening.
Runner -up to Tomsic for the
Cards was Russ Lawler. who ac
counted for 19 points—l 4 of them in
the first half—and did a yeoman job
on the boards.
CARD WALKAWAY
The game was no contest after the
first four minutes when SC held the
Indians to a G-6 tie. Then Lawler
took control of both backboards and
combining with the sharpshooting of
Tomsic, Barry Brown, and Bill
Bond, gave Stanford a 24 to 12 lead
midway through the first half, and
the Trojans never were closer than
nine points after that.
USC seemed unable to buy a bas
ket, through the remainder of the
half, as they played very sloppy ball.
Stanford took full advantage of ev
ery USC slip, and soon enjoyed a 40

field goals and six free throws for 18
points.

Stanford's basketballers completed their sweep of the weekend
series with Southern California Saturday night by breezing to an
76 to 60 victory over the inept Trojans.
Once again it was Ron Tomsic —Mr. Accuracy himself—who
paced the Indian triumph. Tcmsic meshed nine field goals in 15

attempts and tanked nine free
throws in the same number of at
tempts to total 27 points for the
evening.
Runner -up to Tomsic for the
Cards was Russ Lawler. who ac
counted for 19 points—l 4 of them in
the first half—and did a yeoman job
on the boards.
CARD WALKAWAY
The game was no contest after the
first four minutes when SC held the
Indians to a G-6 tie. Then Lawler
took control of both backboards and
combining with the sharpshooting of
Tomsic, Barry Brown, and Bill
Bond, gave Stanford a 24 to 12 lead
midway through the first half, and
the Trojans never were closer than
nine points after that.
USC seemed unable to buy a bas
ket, through the remainder of the
half, as they played very sloppy ball.
Stanford took full advantage of ev
ery USC slip, and soon enjoyed a 40
to 20 bulge. By half-time it was
42 to 24.
TOMSIC AGAIN
The Trojans made their last bid
midway through the second half
when everyone on the Card quintet
cooled off but Tomsic. Ron account
ed for all the Stanford points
through the first eight minutes of
the half.
Dick Welsh and Ralph Pausig led
the Trojan rally which cut the In
dian margin to 52 to 43 with 12 min
utes to play in the game.
However, Tomsic and Lawler re
taliated to lead a drive which put
Stanford safely in front GG lo 45 witli
a little better than five minutes to
go. At that point. Stanford coach
Howie Dallmar cleared his bench.
Co-captain Dick Welsh topped the
Southern California scorers with 18
points, while the other co-captain,
center Roy Irvin, who played what
was probably the worst game of his
collegiate career, was limited to
three.
The Indians sank 25 field goals in
59 attempts for 43 per cent, while
SC could manage only 21 of G4 tries
from the field for 33 per cent.

It was all Ron Tomsic Friday night as the Cards won 92-78. The
great little guard had the best night of his spectacular college ca
reer as he broke his old PCC scoring record of 38 and set the new
mark at 40.
Tomsic hit on 14 for 18 field goal attempts, a blazing 78 per cent,

and bucketed 12 out of 13 free throw
attempts to tally his 40.
Coach Howie Dallmar took Tom
sic out of the game with r.bout a j
minute left when he cleared the j
bench. However, on finding out that |
Tomsic had tied the record, Dallmar
sent him back into the game to shoot
for the record. There were scant
seconds remaining, and SC had
three men on Tomsic. Remarkable
Ron got away one shot and missed,
but then an over - eager Trojan
fouled. Ron stepped up to the line
and sank both tosses.
NEW RECORD
Tomsic tied the former record, set
by UCLA's Ed Sheldrake against
Stanford in 1951, when he hit for 38
points against USC at Los Angeles.
Cal's Dick Tamberg tied the record
at Berkeley against Stanford last
year, but couldn't get past the 38-
point level.
As a unit Stanford hit 57 per cent
from the floor and 80 per cent from
the free throw line. They led Troy
all the way.
The Trojans never generated a se
rious threat until the second half.
They came back onto the floor 30-40
behind and promptly cut the margin
to five points before Stanford scored
a point.
The partisan Pavilion crowd was,
ginning to really worry when
Stanford's lead was cut to a meager
three points with 12 minutes left in
the game. Then George Selleck
whisked through a set shot from 25
feet out. Tomsic scored two on a
layup, and Selleck flipped in two
charity tosses.
