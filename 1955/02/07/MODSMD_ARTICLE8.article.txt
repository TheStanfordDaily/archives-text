# Professor Travis Explains Ousting of Mendes-France
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
"Did Mendes-France ruin his moral position in deciding not to
support the European Defense Community and in deciding to seek
some other solution?"
Dr. Martin B. Travis, assistant professor of the political science
department, stated in a Daily interview yesterday afternoon that

he considered this question the de- 1 *
termining factor in Saturday's oust
ing of the popular French premier.
"Mcndes-France took a calculated
riskâ€”and losi," Travis observed. In
the downfall vote over his policy to
ward the North African situation, he
foutid that he had lost many of the
initial supporters of his program,
especially among the MRP and oth
er parties that had boosted EDC.
"Many people assert," Travis said,
"that be could have gotten the same
support for EDC that he managed
to get for the Western European
Union."
The immediate cause of the ex
premier's upset, according to Travis,
was his attempt to grant the colony
of Algeria some degree of autonomy.
"In effect," he said, "this move
would have killed the power of the
reactionary Algerian colonials who
are now represented in the National
Assembly."
Travis argued that Mendes-
France is the only possible leader j
for the country, but. he also felt that j
if French feeling is as opposed to
rearmament as it often appears, he
will have no chance to regain con
trol of the government.
Although some "hope that. Mcn

des-France will have the opportu
nity to regroup forces and pull sup
port from the Gaullists and Com
munists," Travis is not optimistic
about his success and warns that the
United States should count o(T
France in the European defense
sphere and proceed to set up other
supply lines to Germany, possibly
through the Low Countries.
"Whether we J ike it or not," he
advanced, "Germany is the one im
portant power in Europe."
