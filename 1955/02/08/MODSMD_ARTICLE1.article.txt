# '59 Coed Class May Fall to 300
## 
### BILL WRIGHT Associate Editor, The Daily 
Fewer women will be admitted to the class of '59 than to any
of the last three freshman classes, Director of Admissions Rixford
K. Snyder predicted yesterday. The cut will be from about 406
admitted last fall to between 250 and 300 next year.
The decrease is caused by the limited University housing facili-

ties for women find by the surpris
ingly large number of women who
have accepted admittance offers the
la,st. three years.
"We're going to have to take a re
duced number of girls because of
t-hc large number who have accepted
in the past three years," Snyder
vaid. "Originally we planned to ad
mit 300 next fall. Whether it will
be that high or a little less I don't
know at this time."
ri;sjdi;nci:s filled
The University usually estimates
that about 100 girls who are ac
cepted will not attend. The num
ber of women accepting has been
greater than the calculations. This
has filled existing women's resi
dences to capacity.
Therefore the next incoming class,
according to Snyder, will match as
closely as possible the number of
women graduating plus the number
of undergraduates who will not re
turn to University residences (be
cause of grades, transferring, mar
riages). Fewer than 300 arc ex
pected to graduate.
TEMPORARY CUT
Snyder said that this is only a
temporary cut and will not, affect
the number of men to bo admitted
in the fall. "We hope to even the
women's enrollment with this one
year's cut," Snyder said.
How is the University planning
to alleviate the cramped women's
housing facilities? The plans are ex
tensive, says Assistant to the Presi
dent Kenneth M. Cuthbertson, but
they are all tentative bccause of j
financial problems.
NEW DORM NEAR KNOLL
A dormitory to house 400 girls—
which has "first priority," according
to Snyder—is planned for the site
below the Knoll. "The target is to
complete this by 1957, but mind
you, this is just a target," said Cuth
bertson.
The tentative planning, which es
timates an expenditure of two and
a half million dollars, provides for
living and dining units for 50 women
each. The eight units would utilize
a common kitchen.
Cuthbertson explained that there

is no money allocated for the dorm
at. tlio present time but that as soon
as plans arc more definite an "ag
gressive fund-raising campaign will
be initiated."
PRKSSURK TO CONTINUE
'"However, the pressure on wom
en's housing will continue for a Ion®
time," said Cuthbcrtson. "We will
have to use any available space."
And until that time the number of
women will have to remain in the
proximity of the 2,042 which are
now enrolled.
And the ratio? The ratio will not
change for the whole University; it
is now 2.Til. But for the entering
freshman cla-s next year, the ratio
will jump from 1.93 to approximate
ly 2.75.
