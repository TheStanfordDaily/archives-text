# Honor Code Problem Arises
## 
### HELEN DEWAR (Second in a series) 
In 1021, the Honor Code became a living institution. Since that
time it has cultivated much respect both within and without the
University.
Indeed, within the University, there has been such a reverence
for the Code that any attempts to re-evaluate it in order to strength-

en its force have been greeted
intense aversion. In addition, stu
dents have conic to accept its privi
leges automatically, and its duties
lightly.
There has been a mowing feeling
within recent years that one of the
basic responsibilities of the students,
that of maintaining "collective or
third-person" responsibility, is fail
ing especially when students take
their tests out of the examination
room. Under these circumstances,
all effective checks on student
by group restraint arc removed.
Despite the fact that for several
years students have assumed that
it is their unquestionable right to
take examinations wherever they
please, the Honor Code has never
stipulated that such a privilege be
granted. The Code merely .says that J
students will sit alternately during |
examinations; if conditions are too j
crowded to permit such a seating
| plan, the professor is to provide an
| alternative set of tests.
The situation was confused when
the Honor Code Committee of 1945
| published an orientation pamphlet
boasting that students at Stanford
j had complete liberty to take tests
wherever they pleased.
| This was accepted bv many slu

dents as a right inherent in the
Code.
The problem of this "assumed"
right has been brought to the at
tention of the student body through
the ASSU Executive Committee
live times in recent years.
In 1911 President Wilbur saw the
possible danger to the Code re
sulting from students removing ex
aminations from the room and from
any scope of collective responsibil
ity. He brought the matter before
the Executive Committee, but no
action was taken.
A similar end befell the 1947
Honor Code Committee's recom
mendation that "a student, wishing
to take an examination outside the
assigned room, first secure the con
sent. of the instructor."
The same committee only a short
time later submitted another reso
lution, slightly different from the
first, but it too was defeated.
In 1940 the problem was again
brought up. Excom then took con
structive action and resolved that
"providing adequate seating is avail
able in the examination room, ex
aminations will be taken out of the

room only with the consent of the
instructor."
The issue again lay comparatively
dormant until the summer of 1053
when Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbiglcr appeared before the sum
mer quarter Excom to warn them
again of the problem.
The faculty, he reported, was
seeking a clear-cut policy on the
matter, but wished the students to
handle it. He warned, though, that
if no action was taken by autumn,
the Academic Council migjit be
forced to step in.
The matter was handed over to
the regular Excom in the autumn
and two plans were proposed and
ultimately defeated: (1) that exami
nations be taken out only when the
students feel that remaining in the
room would hinder performance,
and (2) that policy be determined
by student meetings in the individ
ual departments.
A nine-member committee com
posed of students and faculty was
appointed by Excom to survey the
problem, conduct campus opinion
polls, and tabulate results.
The committee arrived at no defi
nite stand and this year a committee
under Ann Irvine was set up to
cducatc the students about the Code.
This year's Honor Code Commit
tee has made additional studies into
the problem and last, week brought
its studies to a conclusion by sub
mitting to Excom its proposal that
tests will be taken from the room
only with the consent of the instruc
tor, provided adequate seating is
available, .
