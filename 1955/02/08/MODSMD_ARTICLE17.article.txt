# Students' Pennies Encircle Three-Quarters of Quad
## 
### BRAD LEONARD 
If there are any spare pennies
lying around campus after yes
terday's charity-promoting "Pen
ny Mile," nobody can say that
it's the fault of the junior class
activities board.
Members of the board and class
volunteers manned change booths
and the chalked-in lines, which en
circled the Quad, in their attempt to
get the Winter Quarter Charity Drive
off to a (lying start. After extremely
careful computations, rounded off to
the nearest penny, it was estimated
that it would take the staggering sum
of 51,392 cents to completely circle
the outer quad, and donating stu
dents covered approximately' three
fourths of that distance. No exact
figures on how much the stunt
cleared will he available until after
today, as the job of counting the
pennies still remains to be done.
Fund raising for the remainder of
the week will be relatively unspec
tacular. However, on Friday the
senior class ex-com will sponsor a
large scale auction at noon in front
of the bookstore in which 00-cd.s
will offer their hashing talents to
the highest bidders in any campus
living group for one meal.
Student .solicitors will continue to
canvass individuals in their living
groups during the remainder of the
week, while off-campus students and
faculty members may put their con
tributions in specially marked con
tainers in the Cellar.
A large competition board in front
of the Cellar, made by Theta Xi
junior Don Neumann will promi
nently display progress made
throughout the week by individual
living groups toward achieving the
$6000 drive goa4.
