# campus opinion honor code...

### 
To the Editor:
A minority of students and faculty are threatening
to abolish the privilege of taking exams from the
classrooms. Some fallacies in their arguments are
obvious.
1. They would say, "Here is your Honor Code. We
trust you. But we do not trust you when we cannot
see you."
2. They say that the third person responsibility
cannot operate outside the classroom. In the next
breath, they complain that it does not work in the
classroom anyway. (I think they are just looking for
something to gripe about. Has anyone shown any
actual statistics to show that the Honor Code is not
working as well as it used to?)
3. They say that the chance to cheat may happen
quite unintentionally when the student is away
from the class. Nonsense! No one leaves the room
with texts and notes. Any cheating must be pre
meditated.
We want an Honor Code that Stanford can be
proud of: not a system whex-e everyone would sit
in a crowded room suspiciously watching each other.
No system can eliminate cheating 100 per cent. I
suggest that we continue the spirit of faith that the

individual will live up to the trust placed in him,
in or out of the classroom, with these new precau
tions:
1. Those who leave the room must sign a state
ment on the bluebook or a list in the classroom to
that effect.
2. Take-out exams be limited to the Quad area,
excluding the library and living groups.
3. The student outside the class must have no books
or notes with him. This would eliminate the "ap
pearance" factor.
4. Faculty should emphasize the importance of the
Honor Code and explain what constitutes "unper
mitted aid" in their particular course. In four years
at Stanford. I have only heard of one professor who
emphasized this before an exam.
With continuous social pressure and pride in out-
Code, I think it can be the "best of all possible
Codes"!

problem continue. The Daily will welcome letters

tions of the letters received.—Ed.

tions:
1. Those who leave the room must sign a state
ment on the bluebook or a list in the classroom to
that effect.
2. Take-out exams be limited to the Quad area,
excluding the library and living groups.
3. The student outside the class must have no books
or notes with him. This would eliminate the "ap
pearance" factor.
4. Faculty should emphasize the importance of the
Honor Code and explain what constitutes "unper
mitted aid" in their particular course. In four years
at Stanford. I have only heard of one professor who
emphasized this before an exam.
With continuous social pressure and pride in out-
Code, I think it can be the "best of all possible
Codes"!

As study and discussion of the Honor Code
problem continue. The Daily will welcome letters
on all aspects of the Honor Code. The Daily will
make every effort to publish representative selec
tions of the letters received.—Ed.
