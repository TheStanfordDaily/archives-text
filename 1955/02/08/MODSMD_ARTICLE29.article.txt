Well, sir, it's about time (high time, that is)
that this corner offered recognition to the Farm's
answer to the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, the
Stanford Pep Band.
Hearing "Bluin' the Blues" or "That's a
Plenty" at a basketball game is, as the moderns
put it, really a wig. And seeing Ragtime George
Sheldon leading his stompers in "Fight On For
Old S.C." with a toothpick instead of a baton.
Marvelous.
Yes, indeed. The basketball band deserves
a lot in the way of kudos, not only for reviv
ing old two-beat standards, but for the fresh
and zestful way in which it handles the school
songs. Witness the bright and brassy trumpet
flourishes in the middle of "On Men of Stan
ford."
But back to Sheldon's work with the oldies
that when last heard from were ripping through
the walls of New Orleans bistros prior to the
Navy shut-down of Storyville and, more re
cently, have been perpetuated by Bay Area
stalwarts like Melvin (Turk) Murphy and Lu
Watters, et al.
George (Stomp) Sheldon probably has the

spirit of Jelly Roll Morton whistling to himself
and trying to convince to other habitues of the
left bank of the River Styx that he "created
Jazz, rags and stomps." Even Jelly, who was
contemptuous of some of the greatest of all Jazz
musicians, would applaud the hearty efforts of
Stanford's young instrumentalists, as they rock
through the grand old Kid Ory original "Musk
rat Ramble."
To play a good brand of Jazz, even if it is
meticulously arranged, you have to feel that
the music you're playing is all that counts at the
moment. Bunk Johnson, one of the first high
priests of New Orleans (c. 1890) said that "jazz
is talkin' from the heart, you don't lie." I doubt
that Sheldon's Shimmy-she-wabblers are lying.
On the evenings of Friday and Saturday last,
they completely demolished little Tommy
Walker s troubadors from Figueroa Tech. And
Walker was unhappy. His gentlemen sounded
like the Salvation Army tuning up.
So, a bouquet to Mr. Sheldon and orchids
to his troops. But George, how about working
out "Friendless Blues" to serenade the Bears
in Berkeley?

out "Friendless Blues" to serenade the Bears
in Berkeley?
Well, sir, it's about time (high time, that is)
that this corner offered recognition to the Farm's
answer to the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, the
Stanford Pep Band.
Hearing "Bluin' the Blues" or "That's a
Plenty" at a basketball game is, as the moderns
put it, really a wig. And seeing Ragtime George
Sheldon leading his stompers in "Fight On For
Old S.C." with a toothpick instead of a baton.
Marvelous.
Yes, indeed. The basketball band deserves
a lot in the way of kudos, not only for reviv
ing old two-beat standards, but for the fresh
and zestful way in which it handles the school
songs. Witness the bright and brassy trumpet
flourishes in the middle of "On Men of Stan
ford."
But back to Sheldon's work with the oldies
that when last heard from were ripping through
the walls of New Orleans bistros prior to the
Navy shut-down of Storyville and, more re
cently, have been perpetuated by Bay Area
stalwarts like Melvin (Turk) Murphy and Lu
Watters, et al.
George (Stomp) Sheldon probably has the

spirit of Jelly Roll Morton whistling to himself
and trying to convince to other habitues of the
left bank of the River Styx that he "created
Jazz, rags and stomps." Even Jelly, who was
contemptuous of some of the greatest of all Jazz
musicians, would applaud the hearty efforts of
Stanford's young instrumentalists, as they rock
through the grand old Kid Ory original "Musk
rat Ramble."
To play a good brand of Jazz, even if it is
meticulously arranged, you have to feel that
the music you're playing is all that counts at the
moment. Bunk Johnson, one of the first high
priests of New Orleans (c. 1890) said that "jazz
is talkin' from the heart, you don't lie." I doubt
that Sheldon's Shimmy-she-wabblers are lying.
On the evenings of Friday and Saturday last,
they completely demolished little Tommy
Walker s troubadors from Figueroa Tech. And
Walker was unhappy. His gentlemen sounded
like the Salvation Army tuning up.
So, a bouquet to Mr. Sheldon and orchids
to his troops. But George, how about working
out "Friendless Blues" to serenade the Bears
in Berkeley?
