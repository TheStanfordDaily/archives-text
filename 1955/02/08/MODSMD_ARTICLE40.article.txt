# Boeing offers engineers long-range careers
## 
### 
Throughout its 38-year history, Boeing
lias consistently pioneered advanced new
types of military and commercial aircraft,
and new methods of production. 1 his
history of leadership lias meant con
tinued growth for the company. It m<jf»ns
continued opportunities for Boeing
engineers to move ahead according to
their ability in Research, Design and
Production.
Today Boeing is. producing the jet
age's outstanding bombers, the B 52 and
tin* l> 47. Other Boeing projects that
mean continued growth and stability in
clude: America's first jet transport (the
Boeing 707 ). Research in nuclear
powered and supersonic flight. And one
of the nation's major guided missile pro
grams. These and other new-horizon

projects arc expanding at such a rate that
Boeing now employs more engineers than
even at the peak of World War 11.
The high inherent interest of these
programs, together with the stimulation
of expanding opportunities, add to the
stability of careers at Boeing. One meas
ure of stability is given in this chart.

It shows that 46% of Boeing engineers
have been with the company for five
or more years; 25% have been here 10 or
more years, and 6% for I 5 or more years.
Another measure is the increasing pro

portion of engineers to total employees.
Fifteen years ago the figure was one to
16. Today one out of each seven em
ployees is an engineer.
Boeing promotes from within and holds
regular merit reviews to assure individual
recognition. Engineers are encouraged to
take graduate studies while working and
arc reimbursed for all tuition expenses.
Boeing has openings for virtually all
tvpes of engineers—electrical, civil, me
chanical, aeronautical and related fields,
and for applied physicists and mathema
ticians with advanced degrees.
