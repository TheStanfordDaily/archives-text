# Accurate Kicking Sparks Card Rugby Triumph, 11-6
## 
### MIKE McGINNIS 
Stanxord's rough - tough ruggers
kicked their way to an 11-6 win
over the College of Pacific Tigers in
Stockton last Saturday.
r lhe longer, narrower field ham
pered offensive play for the Cards.
They moved the ball to scoring po
sition with accurate kicking and
sharp forward defensive play.
'1 he Card win was boosted by the
playing of Dick Jones, Russ Steele,

and Noel Robinson, all of whom did
much to contain the aggressive COP
scrum. The backfield play of Jerry
Gustafson and Gordy Young helped
rack up yardage for the Indians on
the rough field. Sam Thornton
played good ball at scrum half.
HUGGED CONTEST
Play started rough and ended
rougher. Neither team could gain
an advantage in the first half until
25 minutes had elapsed of the 40-
minute period when Mel Smalley
of COP scored on a 40-yard offside
penalty kick.
The first minutes of the first half
saw hard scrumming on the mid
field stripe. Half-way through the
period both teams opened up with
a kicking barrage that sent the ball
sailing back and forth over the 50-
yard stripe.
CARDS ON DEFENSIVE
Neither team could move the ball
on the ground, except for slight dis
tances, throughout the game. Field
conditions and the big COP for
wards forced the Card forwards to
play a hard tackling defensive
game; it was talent over power. The
Cards played COP for mistakes.
Sam Thornton started a Stanford
second-period scoring drive when
he picked the ball out of a scrum on
the COP 10-yard line and ran over
for a try in the opening moments of
the period. Dorsey Atkinson con
verted and the Card ruggers led 5-3.
After 13 minutes had eLapsed,
Stanford moved the play to COP's
30. The COP scrum half was pen
alized for being "undoubtedly" off
side and Atkinson scored three more
for the Cards on a 30-yard penalty
kick.
TIGERS THREATEN
In the middle of the period COP
threatened after a series of out-of
bounds kicks carried them to the

Card 20-ynrd line. The Tiger for
wards gave COP control of the ball
a number of times inside Stanford
territory, but lack of kicking talent
in the backfield prevented them
from scoring.
CLINCHER BY ATKINSON
The Cards raised their total to 11
points with 15 minutes remaining
in the game when Atkinson scored
three points on a 20-yard offside
kick, terminating a drive from the
Stanford 20.
Another Card drive followed but
a penalty kiclf was missed. COP
took over with a last-minute kick
ing offense and scored as the whistle
blew, to chalk the Tiger total at six
points.
Stanford's head coach, Pete
Kmetovic, called the game "ragged"
due to field conditions, and ex
pressed respect for the rough Tiger
forwards.
Stanford suffered four temporary
injuries. Ernie Dorn, Scott Jones,
and John Woehler were dazed from
blows on the head, and John Doyle
(scrum half) suffered a sprained
foot.
