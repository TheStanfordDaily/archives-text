# Braves Rout Concordia
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
A small Pavilion crowd witnessed
a wild and woolly basketball con
test which saw the Braves come out
on the long end of an 84-37 score
over a hopelessly outclassed Con
cordia JC team.
Although far from their usual
form, the Braves were able to jump
off to a 10 to 0 lead on baskets by
John Hendricks, Carl Isaacs, and
Bob Milton. From here on in it was
just a matter of how high the home
team could push the scoreboard. By
half-time, Denny Mahoney and Dick
Farman had added six points apiece
to mount the score to 33 to 19.
Bob Larson, Concordia's siege gun,
kept the visitors in the game with
his driving lay-ups and hooks. Lar
son caged eight points in the first
half and added six more after the
intermission for his total of 14
points. Nick Vojvodich and Ben
Heirs scored eight and 12 points re
spectively during the second half.
