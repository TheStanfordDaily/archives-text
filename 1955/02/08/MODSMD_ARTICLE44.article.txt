# Papoose Cagers Nip Broncs, Roll Over Washington High
## 
### JIM BAKER LARRY JENSEN 
By tromping an outclassed Wash
ington High basketball club to the
tune of 82-57 Saturday night, the
Stanford frosh completed a sweep
of their weekend games and upped
their won-lost record to a respec
table 9 and 2.
Washington jumped off to an early
lead with some sharp outside shoot
ing in the first quarter, but then
they cooled off and the strong re
bounding and fast break of the tall
er frosh provided the winning mar
gin.
WARING PACES RALLY
High point man for both teams was
Harvey Merriouns, Washington for
ward, who tallied 22 points on long
set shots. Merriouns' timely shots
kept the score respectable until the
beginning of the second half, when
Stanford's Clint Waring got seven
points on two layups, a tip-in, and a
free throw to extend the frosh lead
to 20 points. From here on in the
Papooses scored at will against the
hapless Washington cagers.
NEW STARTINC; QUINTET
Freshman coacli Dick Clegg start
ed a revamped lineup for the pre
liminary game, with Lee Leonard
starting at center for regular Clint
Waring. With five minutes gone in
the first half, Clegg put in Waring
for Gary Van Galder and the double
pivot offense was very effective.
Little Stan Rosenburg of Wash
ington provided the biggest thrill of
the game when he threw the ball
from half court and it swished
through the hoop just as the final
buzzer sounded.

The Stanford frosh broke out of
a half-time deficit on some sharp
second - half shooting by Dean
Thomas, Clint Waring, and Eric An
derson to outgun the Santa Clara
frosh, 72-62, in the Friday night
preliminary game in the Pavilion.
Behind at half-time, 37-35, the
Papooses matched the junior Bron
cos bucket for bucket through the
early going in the second half, and
finally forged a 53-51 lead with 10
minutes to go in the game. Then
five straight points by Anderson and
single field goals by Waring, Bob
Johnson, and Gary Van Galder
boomed the frosh into a command
ing 64-56 lead that broke the Santa
Clarans' backs.
PAPOOSES SEW IT UP
The junior Broncs closed the gap
on buckets by Jack Jordan and Ray
Paxton but the Papooses then con
nected on eight straight points to
sew up the game.
The first half was close all the
way. With Jay Jackson, Tony Vi
gna, and Waring bearing the brunt
oi : the scoring, the frosh built an
early 21-15 lead but the Santa Clara
frosh came back to tie the score on
successive field goals by Gary Gill
mor, Paxton, and Jordan.
The remainder of the half was nip
and tuck with Gillmor finally giving
the Santa Clarans the half - time
edge with a two - pointer at the
buzzer.
JACKSON LEADS FROSH
Jordan of Santa Clara took game
scoring honors with 18 points. Pax
ton rang up 17 and the fancy drib
bling Gillmor hit for 13 to dominate
the Santa Clara scoring.
Jackson led tne trosn \Vith 15
counters. He was followed by War
ing and Thomas who had 12 each.


TIGHT SQUEEZE —Gary Van Galder, Stanford freshman hoopster, runs into a host of Washing
ton High School defenders in their game last Saturday night. The Papooses breezed to an 82-57
triumph over the visiting prepsters. On Friday night the Card Yearlings faced a sterner test be
fore downing the Santa Clara frosh 72-62. Defending against the Papoose guard are high scor
ing Harvey Merriouns (far left), Brewster Robertson (right), and an unidentified Washington
eager (center). Merriouns was high point man for the contest, tallying 22 markers. The Card
hoopster in the foreground is Jerry Rose. The twin Papoose victories gave the local frosh a rec
ord of nine victories and two defeats for the season. Only four contests remain on the fresh
man slate for this year. The Papooses tangle with St. Ignatius, one of the top quintets in San
Francisco, on Friday. Also remaining on their schedule are a single tilt with Santa Rosa High and
a pair of battles against the California frosh. —Daily photo by Keith Fraser

TIGHT SQUEEZE —Gary Van Galder, Stanford freshman hoopster, runs into a host of Washing
ton High School defenders in their game last Saturday night. The Papooses breezed to an 82-57
triumph over the visiting prepsters. On Friday night the Card Yearlings faced a sterner test be
fore downing the Santa Clara frosh 72-62. Defending against the Papoose guard are high scor
ing Harvey Merriouns (far left), Brewster Robertson (right), and an unidentified Washington
eager (center). Merriouns was high point man for the contest, tallying 22 markers. The Card
hoopster in the foreground is Jerry Rose. The twin Papoose victories gave the local frosh a rec
ord of nine victories and two defeats for the season. Only four contests remain on the fresh
man slate for this year. The Papooses tangle with St. Ignatius, one of the top quintets in San
Francisco, on Friday. Also remaining on their schedule are a single tilt with Santa Rosa High and
a pair of battles against the California frosh. —Daily photo by Keith Fraser
