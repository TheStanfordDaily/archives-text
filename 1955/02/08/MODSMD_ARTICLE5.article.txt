# Chinese Reds Are Bluffing—Dulles
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles said today
he doubts the Chinese Communists
"really intend to wage war" over
Formosa as long as the United
States stands ready to fight in its
defense. .
But Dulles told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee the Reds will
continue their "probing" around the
Chinese Nationalist stronghold to
test the U.S. will-to-fight. He said
this country wants peace "ardently"
but not "at the price of our security
or our honor."
