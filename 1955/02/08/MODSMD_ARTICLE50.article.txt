## 
### Photos Text By JACK BYRNE 
Ever thought that you might like to do something foi the first
time in this country ... a premiere of some sort oi another?
Suppose you decided to do a piece of choral music for thr> first
time in America? Where do you start?
If you're doing a work such as Carl Orff'3 "Catulli Carmina" as

the University Chorus is tonight,<
you've got quite a job ahead of you.
To begin with, you'll need a good
j sized chorus, maybe 18") voices,
i You'll ncod two good soloists.
You'll need four pianists. And,
! you'll nerd a percussion section
with some percussion instruments
you never heard of.
1 OrfTs score cails for a dozen or
| -o pcrcussion players to man the
following instruments:
Item: One set of tympani.
Item: Four xylophones, one of the
! car don variety, one soprano, one
tenor, and one bass.
Item: Two glockenspiels.
Item: One Metallophone, a sub
variety of xylophone with brass bars.
Item: One steinspicl (slab of
stone) tuned to a high "C." Since
Jocal .stone doesn't seem to come in
this specification, you'll have to
think up a substitute.
Item: One Sandra.-sel—use a brass
box filled with sand and pea grave].
And for iu-t a bit more color,
you'll need three tambourines, a tri
angle or two, a bass drum, cymbals
(three different sizes), one gong
(Buddha type), tuned to low '"C,* 1
and one smaller gong.

I<ot> of the instruments weren't
available in this country, but. Pro
fessor Paid H. Kirkpatrick of the
Physics Department produced them
for the chorus. Kirkpatrick de
signed and built a steinspicl that
sounds more like a slab of stone
than a slab of stone.
For soloi-ts, chorus director Har
old C. Schmidt secured the services
of two Stanford alumni: Jess Thom
as, a tenor from Piedmont, and Ruth
; Roohr, a Mcnlo Park soprano. Bolh
have appeared in University opera
productions.
The work itself is based on poems
bv the Roman Catullus, written in
the first century before Christ, and
forms the middle part of a trilogy,
j The other two sections are the "Car
mina Burana" and the "Triumph of
| Aphrodite."
Supporting the chorus and MJp
| plying the .story will be Robert I/>-
i per of ihe Speech and Drama De
■ partment, who will serve as narra-
I tor.

time in America? Where do you start?
If you're doing a work such as Carl Orff'3 "Catulli Carmina" as

the University Chorus is tonight,<
you've got quite a job ahead of you.
To begin with, you'll need a good
j sized chorus, maybe 18") voices,
i You'll ncod two good soloists.
You'll need four pianists. And,
! you'll nerd a percussion section
with some percussion instruments
you never heard of.
1 OrfTs score cails for a dozen or
| -o pcrcussion players to man the
following instruments:
Item: One set of tympani.
Item: Four xylophones, one of the
! car don variety, one soprano, one
tenor, and one bass.
Item: Two glockenspiels.
Item: One Metallophone, a sub
variety of xylophone with brass bars.
Item: One steinspicl (slab of
stone) tuned to a high "C." Since
Jocal .stone doesn't seem to come in
this specification, you'll have to
think up a substitute.
Item: One Sandra.-sel—use a brass
box filled with sand and pea grave].
And for iu-t a bit more color,
you'll need three tambourines, a tri
angle or two, a bass drum, cymbals
(three different sizes), one gong
(Buddha type), tuned to low '"C,* 1
and one smaller gong.

I<ot> of the instruments weren't
available in this country, but. Pro
fessor Paid H. Kirkpatrick of the
Physics Department produced them
for the chorus. Kirkpatrick de
signed and built a steinspicl that
sounds more like a slab of stone
than a slab of stone.
For soloi-ts, chorus director Har
old C. Schmidt secured the services
of two Stanford alumni: Jess Thom
as, a tenor from Piedmont, and Ruth
; Roohr, a Mcnlo Park soprano. Bolh
have appeared in University opera
productions.
The work itself is based on poems
bv the Roman Catullus, written in
the first century before Christ, and
forms the middle part of a trilogy,
j The other two sections are the "Car
mina Burana" and the "Triumph of
| Aphrodite."
Supporting the chorus and MJp
| plying the .story will be Robert I/>-
i per of ihe Speech and Drama De
■ partment, who will serve as narra-
I tor.
