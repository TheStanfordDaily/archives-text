# Excom Will Vote On Code Addition
## 
### HELEN DEWAR (Last in a series) 
The ASSU Executive Committee tonight will consider the pos
sible acceptance or rejection of a proposed addition to the written
Honor Code providing that tests will be taken from the examina
tion room only with consent of the instructor.
In reality, this involves no change in the actual Code, but merely

a clarification of a misunderstanding
that arose several years ago over the
application of the Code. The origi
nal Code, and the Code as it stands
now, docs not. imply that students
may take examinations from the
room, but usage had embodied the
students' conception of the Code
with this additional meaning. The
proposal by Ann Irvine's Honor
Code Committee is merely to re
store the original meaning to the
34-ycar-old Code.
STUDY OF PROBLEM
Through studying the problem,
Miss Irvine and her committee have
concluded that the Code is not op
crating as successfully as it might.
Miss Irvine believes that the pres
ent circumstances limit the effec
tiveness of the Code, and restricting
trsts to the assigned room will do
much to strengthen it.
Dean of Students 11. Donald Win
bigler considers Miss Irvine's sug
gestion "an excellent solution to an
otherwise logically impossible prob
lem."
An effective solution to the prob
lem will take effort and education
on the part of the students and fac
ulty alike, Winbigler pointed out.
STUDENTS MAINTAIN CODE
"It must be remembered," he said,
"that the maintenance of the Honor
Code has been turned over to the
students individually and collective
ly and we must give them this
chance to work collectively. We are,
in essence, preventing collective re
sponsibility from having the oppor
tunity to function when wc allow
tests to be taken from the exami
nation room."
"Honesty," the Dean went on, "is
a cultivated taste and not neces
sarily inherent within the individ
ual. Wc cannot merely assume that
the Honor Code will work, but we
must exert effort and take educa
tive measures to insure its succcss.
We must also remember that stu
dents come from high schools and
other schools where the only code
is to get, away with as much as you
ran without getting caught."
FACULTY RESPONSIBILITY
Pointing out that faculty could
often do more than they do to find
adequate seating facilities, Winbig
ler said that the professor must take
the responsibility of deciding under
what conditions examinations are to
be taken from the room. "The pro
fessor is in the best position to de
cide," he added.

"If we didn't have a precedent of
nearly 20 years' history to prove
that this system (of taking tests 'in
assigned rooms) would work. I
might not be so positive," the Dean
said. "I am sure," he added, "that
the faculty will give permission to
remove tests from the examination
room when conditions demand it."
Winbigler warned the students
that they arc doing a great disserv
ice to friends whom they see cheat
ing when they refrain from report
ing them. Instances have occurred
when a minor Honor Code violation
charge might have prevented a stu
dent from committing an offense
which ultimately led to expulsion.
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM
Richard L. Balch, Chief Counselor
of Men, gave an emphatic endorse
ment of Miss Irvine's proposal, but
advised that it be accompanied by
an educational program for the fac
ulty. Stressing the educational ap
proach, he said that "it weighs heav
ily on the students and faculty alike
to educate themselves on the Code."
Balch expressed his disturbance
in regard to the responsibility that
must be assumed both by the stu
dents in their policing of the Honor
Code and the faculty in their allow
ing students the freedom of decision
that is inherent in the Code.
Turning to the Council for Stu
dent Control, which decides all
Honor Code eases, Balch pointed
out that "it would seem inherent in
the situation that the faculty must
abide by the decision of the Council
in the trying of Honor Code cases."
