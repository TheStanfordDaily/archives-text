# Orff Premiere Is 'Exciting'
## 
### MARY ELLEN ROMNEY 
A spectacularly different musical
experience was heard by a near
capacity audience last night at Me
morial Auditorium, when the Stan
ford University Chorus presented
the American premiere of "Catulli
Carmina," a scenic cantata by Carl
OrfT. The concert was a Tuesday
Evening Series event.
The work, which requires a large
chorus, two soloists, four pianos, and
a pcrcussion orchestra, was enthusi
astically received by the audience,
and Conductor Harold Schmidt was
called back three times for curtain
calls Turning in outstanding per
formances were soloists Ruth Roehr
and Jess Thomas, whose parts re
quired true vocal gymnastics.
The scene for the cantata was set
by narrator Robert Lopcr, "with the
old men in tho center, passionate
young men on the right, and the at
tractive young ladies in the center."
After exchanging art exciting, rhyth
mic dialogue punctuated with pound
ing percussion accompaniment, the
young people were chastised by the
old men. "You know nothing of
love," they said. "Learn from the
poems of Catullus. . .
The chorus and soloists then re
lated the tale of Catullus, a 50 B.C.
Roman poet, and Lesbia, his lady
love. The music ranged from Re
naissance chants to contemporary
dissonances, and the chorus whisp
ered, shouted and sang delicate
harmonics. The general effect was
quite theatrical in effect, sometimes
reminiscent of Quo Vadis-sfyle Ro
man music.
