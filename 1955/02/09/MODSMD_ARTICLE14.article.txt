# Fisher, Buck: No Foreign Policy Changes over Russian Shakeup
## Premier Bulganin Member Of Old-Line Stalin Group 
### 
Compiled from dispatches of the United Press
Red Army Marshal Nikolai Bulganin became Premier of Russia
yesterday three hours after poker faced Georgi Malenkov resigned
with a confession of "My Guilt" for unsatisfactory leadership.
Bulganin, 60, a marshal who never commanded an army, is the
second most important member of Molotov's group of old-line

Stalinists. He is known to be a fo 1 -'
lower of the foreign minister.
Ho was defense minister and the
fifth-ranking man in the Kremlin
hierarchy when he suddenly was
tapped for the top job.
He was the political link between
the army and Stalin. As army
spokesman on public occasions and
anniversaries, his tlieme was "Peace,
but. Preparedness."
This preparedness theme is ex
ported to feature his premiership,
replacing the "peaceful co-exist
ence" line of the era of resigned
Premier Georgi M. Malenkov,
He does not have the air of a "fire
breather," but. Western diplomats do
not consider him 100 peaceful. They
sum up his attitude in one of his fa
vorite oft-repeated phrases:
"Wo don't want to fight, but if the
time comes we're ready."
BOLSHEVIK PARTY
At the time of the 1917 revolution
he joined the Bolshevik party and
fought during the civil war in Si
beria.
In 1041, ho organized Moscow's ci
vilian defenses as the Germans ap
proached. It was his guerrilla fight
ers who stopped Hitler's last tank
attack up the Napoleon road.
Bulganin's role in saving Moscow
undoubtedly had much to do with
his later rise in the Soviet hierarchy.
Alexander P. Volkov, chairman of
the Soviet of the Union, read the
resignation of Malenkov.
It said the portly premier was
quitting "in the interest of the moth
erland." to strengthen the leader
ship of the cabinet by making way
for one with greater experience in
state work.
Tho first change in the premier
ship since Malonkov took it over
when Stalin died 23 months ago,
was followed swiftly by a tough for
eign policy statement.
U.S. DENOUNCED
Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov
denounced the United States as an
aggressor, particularly in the For
mosa dispute, heading toward a
third world war.
In Washington, Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles was said today
to have told Congressmen that the
dramatic shake-up in top Russian
leadership may mean a new get
tough policy toward the free world.
Dulles himself told reporters he
still did not know the full signifi
cance of the switch in Soviet pre
miers.
But a Congressional source who
was present when Dulles appeared
before the appropriations group said
the Secretary "seemed to feel it
means a tougher policy both inter-
and externally."
"STRONG TALK"
Other officials said they took for
more "strong talk" from Russia but
no "basic" change in Soviet foreign
policy. They stressed the difTcrcnce
between action and talk.
Diplomats viewed this as an at
tempt. to frighten U.S. allies at a

time when they are concerned over
the German rearmament problem
and the threat of war in the Far
East.
Soviet experts in London saw Ma
lenkov's downfall is a victory for
Molotov. The appointment of Bul
ganin was seen as confirmation that
Molotov is now the real power in
Russia—at least for the time being.

Red Army Marshal Nikolai Bulganin became Premier of Russia
yesterday three hours after poker faced Georgi Malenkov resigned
with a confession of "My Guilt" for unsatisfactory leadership.
Bulganin, 60, a marshal who never commanded an army, is the
second most important member of Molotov's group of old-line

Stalinists. He is known to be a fo 1 -'
lower of the foreign minister.
Ho was defense minister and the
fifth-ranking man in the Kremlin
hierarchy when he suddenly was
tapped for the top job.
He was the political link between
the army and Stalin. As army
spokesman on public occasions and
anniversaries, his tlieme was "Peace,
but. Preparedness."
This preparedness theme is ex
ported to feature his premiership,
replacing the "peaceful co-exist
ence" line of the era of resigned
Premier Georgi M. Malenkov,
He does not have the air of a "fire
breather," but. Western diplomats do
not consider him 100 peaceful. They
sum up his attitude in one of his fa
vorite oft-repeated phrases:
"Wo don't want to fight, but if the
time comes we're ready."
BOLSHEVIK PARTY
At the time of the 1917 revolution
he joined the Bolshevik party and
fought during the civil war in Si
beria.
In 1041, ho organized Moscow's ci
vilian defenses as the Germans ap
proached. It was his guerrilla fight
ers who stopped Hitler's last tank
attack up the Napoleon road.
Bulganin's role in saving Moscow
undoubtedly had much to do with
his later rise in the Soviet hierarchy.
Alexander P. Volkov, chairman of
the Soviet of the Union, read the
resignation of Malenkov.
It said the portly premier was
quitting "in the interest of the moth
erland." to strengthen the leader
ship of the cabinet by making way
for one with greater experience in
state work.
Tho first change in the premier
ship since Malonkov took it over
when Stalin died 23 months ago,
was followed swiftly by a tough for
eign policy statement.
U.S. DENOUNCED
Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov
denounced the United States as an
aggressor, particularly in the For
mosa dispute, heading toward a
third world war.
In Washington, Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles was said today
to have told Congressmen that the
dramatic shake-up in top Russian
leadership may mean a new get
tough policy toward the free world.
Dulles himself told reporters he
still did not know the full signifi
cance of the switch in Soviet pre
miers.
But a Congressional source who
was present when Dulles appeared
before the appropriations group said
the Secretary "seemed to feel it
means a tougher policy both inter-
and externally."
"STRONG TALK"
Other officials said they took for
more "strong talk" from Russia but
no "basic" change in Soviet foreign
policy. They stressed the difTcrcnce
between action and talk.
Diplomats viewed this as an at
tempt. to frighten U.S. allies at a

time when they are concerned over
the German rearmament problem
and the threat of war in the Far
East.
Soviet experts in London saw Ma
lenkov's downfall is a victory for
Molotov. The appointment of Bul
ganin was seen as confirmation that
Molotov is now the real power in
Russia—at least for the time being.
