# Students Contribute 41,589 Pennies in Charity Drive
## 
### BRAD LEONARD 
Don't let anyone ever tell you thai the common penny doesn't
mean much these days. Stanford students proved otherwise on
Monday when they laid their common cents side by side, stretched
thorn 2,599 feet around outer Quad, and collected $415.89 for the
Winter Quarter Charity Drive in the process.

The total amount collected up t,04
4:30 p.m. yesterday is $622.19, Eric j
Field, Drives treasurer, reported.
A 1 together Monday's "Penpy i
Mile'' netted a total of 41,589 pen
nies, according to junior class ac
tivities board member Bruce Me-
Phee, who was in charge of counting
the coppers. Although this was 9,803
pennies short of th» 51,392 which
would have supposedly circled the
Quad completely, the chain of Lin
coln-heads covered more than 80
per cent of the total distance —
slightly over the early estimates
which set the distance traversed at j
three-fourths of the total.
CONTRIBUTIONS MOUNT
Meanwhile, per capita contribu- I
tions in various campus living |
groups were slowly beginning to
mount. As of 4:30 p.m. Monday, the
first day of the drive, the men at the
Stanford Boathouse were out in
front of the competition with a $1.50
contribution pev person. Hurlburt
House was in second place with a
per capita donation of 75 cents.
Last, night's living group totals
showed that the Boathouse was still
in first place, while the Fijis and the
Phi Psis had replaced Hurlburt as
second-place contenders with $1 per
capita, followed by Hurlburt with
75 cents and Roth and Guthrie
Houses with 50 cents and 25 cents
respectively.
GROUP SOLICITATIONS
Living group solicitations will be
accelerated during the remainder of
the week in an attempt to achieve
the drive goal of $6,000, and faculty j
members and off-campus students
will be contacted for donations, ac- j
cording to board members.
Any faculty member or off-cam
pus student who has not been
reached by Friday has been re
quested to leave his contribution in (
specially marked containers at the j
entrance to the Cellar.
