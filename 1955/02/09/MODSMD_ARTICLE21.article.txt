# 'New Chief Is Compromise'
## 
### 
Two Stanford professor
agreed, in separate Daily inte?
views yesterday, that the resiq
nation of Premier Georgi Malen
kov and the resulting Russian
shakeup will probably create lit
tle change in either Russian or
American foreign policy.
Professor Harold Fisher, Chair
man of the Hoover Institute and Li
brary, stated, "Russia's foreign
policy might be a little tougher.
With the new man, Bulganin, their
may be lets'taLk about 'peaceful co
existence.' However, I think that if
there had been strong criticism in -
side Russia of Malenkov's foreign
policy, it would undoubtedly have
appeared in his confession."
Fisher also mentioued that, this
will probably have no effect on Mao
T.se Tung's policy in the Formosa n
situation, since he thought the
shake-up internal.
POLICY TOWARD RUSSIA
In regard to American policy to
ward Russia, Professor Phillip Buck
of the Political Science Department,
said that President Eisenhower "has,
in effect, set conditions for Russian
proposals concerning for example, the
Far Eastern situation and West
Germany plans. Therefore, any
changes in American international
policy will depend largely on Rus
sia's actions."
Fisher pointed out that Bulganin
might have been the compromise in
the selecting of a man for premier.
NO NO. 1 RUSSIAN
"No single man has established!
himself as the number one man in
Russia since Stalin's death. Stalin
obviously intended Malenkov as his
successor but when this happens,
rivals tend to gang up on the new
top man and his aides. This time, it
was Beria first and now Malenkov.
"There is no indication here yet
that Bulganin is top in the Russian
Regime. It may be some other per
son we have never heerd of. I think
that this definitely shows that the
struggle for power which began in
March, 1953, is still going on."
Buck explained Nikita Kruschev's
position in the Kremlin. "He is, at
present, the Party secretary and has
been in that position since Stalin' 3
death. It appears that he is in the
superior rank since he runs the
party organization and is reputed to
also hold offices in t.he Soviet Min
istry. It is interesting to note that
Stalin also held this position.'
INTERNAL POLICY
In regard to the question ot Rus
sian internal policy, Buck thought,
that since Malenkov and his associ
ates placed a greater degree of em
phasis on consumer goods instead of
capital (heavy-industry) goods, Bul
ganin might be inclined to build up
heavy industry goods which would
result in a tougher life for the Rus
sian peasant.
However, Fisher pointed out tb <t
since Malenkov apparently resigned
because of agricultural setbacl
there might possibly be a buildinq
up of Russian agriculture which
would improve the peasant's lot.
NO GUESS ON MALENKOV
Neither man offered a guess as to
what might happen to the ousted
Malenkov. Fisher stated, "A good
deal depends on what happens in the
next few weeks. Should Malenkov
attempt to make a deal with some
of the other top Russiansâ€”well, the
Russians have many ways of liqui
dating people."
Both Fisher and Buck thought th
there will be little chance for revo
lutions within Russia, similar to
one that broke out in East Germany
in June, last year.
