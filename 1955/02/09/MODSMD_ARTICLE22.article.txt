May students under the Stanford Honor Code
take their examinations from testing rooms?
Discussion of this question - the focal point of
recent concern with the Honor Code— will high
light the agenda tonight at Excom.
Honor Code Subcommittee chairman Ann Ir
vine last week presented the committee's pol
icy recommendation which stated that "Provid
ed adequate seating is available, students may
leave the testing room only by permission of
the instructor." Excom. will consider this pro
posal tonight at 8:15 v/ith an eye to possible
ASSU by-law changes incorporating it as a
point of Honor Code policy.
Controversy over the test question hinges on
the concept of "collective responsibility." At
the inception of the Honor Code in 1921, the
understanding was that the faculty was turn
ing responsibility for seeing to it that tests were
conducted ethically without the exchange of
unpermitted aid—over to the students.
Proponents of a stricter policy in the matter
say that the jecent tendency of more and more
people to take their examinations from the
classroom has meant that these people are not
accepting their share of this collective respon
sibility or permitting others to see to it that their
conduct is ethical. Those who oppose restrict
inq exams to tire classrooms insist that under
an Honor Code, every student must be trusted,

and those who wish lo work on exams outside
the testing room must thus be allowed to do so.
Weighting the discussion tonight will be
such considerations as the point which has
been made to the student body recently that the
Honor Code is a privilege granted by the fac
ulty, not an unassailable right of the student.
Some members of the faculty have expressed
dissatisfaction with the way the Honor Code
now functions. In this case, it is pointed out,
what the faculty has given the faculty can read
ily take away . , . although Excom has received
the assurance from President Sterling that if
any changes are to be made in the Honor Code,
they must be made by the students.
The Junior Class Excom has endorser! the
subcommittee proposal.

Also tonight, Excom. hopes lo finish discus
sion on the size of the legislature under the
proposed new ASSU Constitution. A long dis
cussion last Wednesday night indicated that
Excom felt it could reach a decision tonight, but
the opinion of the body is fairly evenly split
over the issue of a large versus a small legis
lature.

The meeting is open to everyone . . . il starts
at 7:3(J tonight in Exconi room, Student
Union.
