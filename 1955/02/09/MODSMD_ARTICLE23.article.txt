Tonight, Stanford's Excom is scheduled to
vote on a proposed clarification of the Honor
Code.
Meanwhile, at Santa Clara, the college paper
has come out with an article advocating the
adoption of an honor code system of their own.
The paper cited the "efficient operation" of
the honor system at "Stanford and other col
leges throughout the United States," and stated
that the Code would be a "worthwhile addition
to the examination procedure at the University
and particularly fitting to Santa Clara ideals."

hong Beach State College, however, does not
have its mind on an Honor Code or anything
remotely like that at least not according to
the rainbow colored paper that recently arrived
in the nailbox.

"T< T; ner"?), the four-page paper concerned

Beaux Arts Sprinq Prom, perhaps?}, and a fea
ture on Grunion Hunting permissible only if
you have a license with pink scalloped edges.
"We don't intend to offend," said the staff.
"It is. just that our minds have become

Students at the llllinois Institute of Technol
ogy are "frothy" also, they claim, but their
light headedness is due to the demise of "Old
Bess," an elevator.
Students and professors (particularly the
professors) are moaning because they must
climb five flights of "steep, steep stairs" on
their way to eight o'clock classes.
Particularly depressing is the problem of one
benighted instructor who has an eight-o'clock
on the fifth floor, a nine o'clock on the first
floor, and a ten o'clock on the fifth floor. "All
this with no elevator," he wept. "Something
has to be done!"
