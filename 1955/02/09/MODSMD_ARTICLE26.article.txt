# Program Obstacles
## 
### 
The obstacles in t"he way of a
completely successful Stanford im
provement program were noted
Monday night by Ray Faulkner,
Acting Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences, to the Delta Chi house in one
of a series of "Stanford—Today and
Tomorrow" talks.
The first obstacle, according to
Faulkner, is a matter of predicting
the future accurately. Another ob
stacle is purely the matter of
finances to carry out the plan.
Faulkner, however, emphasized
"the conflict of ideas and needs."
"For instance," said Faulkner, "peo
ple with cars, who drive them often,
would like the campus like a motel,
with drive-in classes so they would
n't even have to get out of their
cars."
When asked about the traffic
problem created by the road from
the shopping center to Palm Drive,
Dean Faulkner replied, "We need
money, we get more money if th£
shopping center prospers, and we
will have a greater take if there are
more roads making the stores avail
able, so we have to do it."
