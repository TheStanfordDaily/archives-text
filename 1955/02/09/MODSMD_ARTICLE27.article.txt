# Frosh Discussion
## 
### 
Dean of Students 11. Donald Win- |
bigler spoke on the topic of lower
division advising to a group of J
freshmen at Encina Hall Monday |
evening in an ST&T discussion.
The Dean admitted that there
were disadvantages as well as ad- |
vantages in the advising system here j
at Stanford. One of the disadvan
tages is caused by the need for so |
many advisers. Often advisers take
vacations or leave the University
for other reasons during the school
year, sometimes making it neces
sary to change advisers during the
school year.
Any student may change his ad
viser at any time, and there will be
"no questions asked." And advisers
may also have their advisees
changed any time, the Dean added.
