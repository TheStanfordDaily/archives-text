Compiled from Dispatches of the United PrÂ»>ss

WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 The
House overwhelmingly approved
President Eisenhower's request for
a four-year extension of the draft
today after decisively beating down
a move to limit the renewal to two
years.
The measure, approved by ttic roll
call vote of 394 to 4, now goes to
the Senate where favorable action
also is certain.
Carl Vinson, chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee,
told his colleagues, some of whom
grumbled about the way the draft
has been the United
States is "about as close to shooting
as ever happened in the history of
this government."
The House accepted an amend*
ment to provide that anyone rejected
on physical grounds will no longer
be liable for induction after he is 26

years old. Under present law, any
one who is deferred for any reason
is liable for induction until he is 35.
