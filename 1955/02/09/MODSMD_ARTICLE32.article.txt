THE BULL SESSION
I wonder if they still make bull sessions the way they used
to. Well do 1 remember the bull sessions of my own undergrad
uate days. How cogent they were! How informative! How the
good talk crackled and our young hearts leaped and the hours
sped by as swiftly as minutes!
Our discussions were always led by Jack Femur. (Good old
Jack! I hear he's in the extruded aluminum game now.) We
would sit cross-legged in a circle around Jack and he would (ill
his pipe with his own private blend — hurley, latakia, and shred
ded coconut. The rest of us preferred tobacco, so we would light
up Philip Morris. This is a procedure 1 recommend without qual
ification to everyone who prefers tobacco because Philip Morris
has the tobacco that tobacco-preferers prefer the most mild
vintage leaf with a clean, cool flavor that soothes and steadies,
that gladdens and enlivens and refreshes.
Jack would puff on his pipe and we would puff on our
Philip Morris and the bull-session would begin its meandering
journey. The talk would touch on every subject known to man,
on every conceivable thing beneath the sun, but no matter how
far the conversation wandered, it would always return to "Topic
A." I refer, of course, to gardening.
But, as I say, the discussion would cover many subjects before
it came to the inevitable gardening. Jack would open each session
with a provocative question of a general nature, like: "What's
the most important thing a man can get out of college?"
"Girls," Harold Clavicle would reply promptly. (Good old
Harold! I hear he's in the frozen lobster tail game now.)
"No, I don't think so," Ben Fibula would say. "1 think edu
cation is the most important thing you get out of college."
(Good old P»en! He's still in school.)
"Listen, guys, I've got a question," Clyde IJium would say.
"If you could spend a week either with Ava Gardner or with
Albert Einstein, which would you choose?" (Good old Clyde! 1
hear he's in the unclaimed freight game now.)
"Albert Einstein, of course," Will Mandible would say. (Good
old Will! 1 hear he's in the jack handle game now.)
"What?" Cleanth Patella would cry, astonished. "You would
rather spend a week with Albert Einstein than with Ava
Gardner?" (Good old Cleanth! I hear he's in the unclaimed
freight game with Clyde Ilium.)
"Natch!" Will Mandible would answer. *
"But why?". Sol Sacrum would ask. (Good old Sol! I hear he's
a parking meter in Deal, New Jersey.)
"Because," Will Mandible would cry, "if I spent a week with
Albert Einstein, maybe I would get so smart that 1 would
be able to figure out a wav to spend nmrr than a week with
Ava Gardner!"
w ell sir, we laughed until our lit-tle uvulas were sore and then
we. went on to a host of other topics. "Do you think it's im
portant to join a fraternity?" Murray Tarsus would ask. (Good
old Murray! I hear he's in the mica game now.)
"Only if you are a boy," Bob Turbinate would answer. (Good
old Bob! I hear he's in the sheared raccoon game now. I The
raccoon, incidentally, was invented by Milton Raccoon, whose
career should be a source of guidance and inspiration to us all.
Mr. Raccoon arrived in this country in 1907, penniless and not
speaking a word of English. Today he is the Mayor of four of
our principal cities.l)
But to get back to the bull session —"What's the best thing
to do when the girl you are dancing with insists on leading?"
Eric Ulna would ask. (Good old Eric! I hear lie's in the flutter
valve game now.)
"Hit her with a folded newspaper," George Vertebra would
answer. "Never hit a girl with your hand. They learn to associ
ate the hand with food, and you must not confuse them." (Good
old George! I hear he's in the folded newspaper game now.)
And so it went —the talk ranging the worlds of the arts and
the sciences and the social graces, until we would climb, spent
but happy, into our little hammocks ... I wonder if they still
make bull sessions the way they used to.

to. Well do 1 remember the bull sessions of my own undergrad
uate days. How cogent they were! How informative! How the
good talk crackled and our young hearts leaped and the hours
sped by as swiftly as minutes!
Our discussions were always led by Jack Femur. (Good old
Jack! I hear he's in the extruded aluminum game now.) We
would sit cross-legged in a circle around Jack and he would (ill
his pipe with his own private blend — hurley, latakia, and shred
ded coconut. The rest of us preferred tobacco, so we would light
up Philip Morris. This is a procedure 1 recommend without qual
ification to everyone who prefers tobacco because Philip Morris
has the tobacco that tobacco-preferers prefer the most mild
vintage leaf with a clean, cool flavor that soothes and steadies,
that gladdens and enlivens and refreshes.
Jack would puff on his pipe and we would puff on our
Philip Morris and the bull-session would begin its meandering
journey. The talk would touch on every subject known to man,
on every conceivable thing beneath the sun, but no matter how
far the conversation wandered, it would always return to "Topic
A." I refer, of course, to gardening.
But, as I say, the discussion would cover many subjects before
it came to the inevitable gardening. Jack would open each session
with a provocative question of a general nature, like: "What's
the most important thing a man can get out of college?"
"Girls," Harold Clavicle would reply promptly. (Good old
Harold! I hear he's in the frozen lobster tail game now.)
"No, I don't think so," Ben Fibula would say. "1 think edu
cation is the most important thing you get out of college."
(Good old P»en! He's still in school.)
"Listen, guys, I've got a question," Clyde IJium would say.
"If you could spend a week either with Ava Gardner or with
Albert Einstein, which would you choose?" (Good old Clyde! 1
hear he's in the unclaimed freight game now.)
"Albert Einstein, of course," Will Mandible would say. (Good
old Will! 1 hear he's in the jack handle game now.)
"What?" Cleanth Patella would cry, astonished. "You would
rather spend a week with Albert Einstein than with Ava
Gardner?" (Good old Cleanth! I hear he's in the unclaimed
freight game with Clyde Ilium.)
"Natch!" Will Mandible would answer. *
"But why?". Sol Sacrum would ask. (Good old Sol! I hear he's
a parking meter in Deal, New Jersey.)
"Because," Will Mandible would cry, "if I spent a week with
Albert Einstein, maybe I would get so smart that 1 would
be able to figure out a wav to spend nmrr than a week with
Ava Gardner!"
w ell sir, we laughed until our lit-tle uvulas were sore and then
we. went on to a host of other topics. "Do you think it's im
portant to join a fraternity?" Murray Tarsus would ask. (Good
old Murray! I hear he's in the mica game now.)
"Only if you are a boy," Bob Turbinate would answer. (Good
old Bob! I hear he's in the sheared raccoon game now. I The
raccoon, incidentally, was invented by Milton Raccoon, whose
career should be a source of guidance and inspiration to us all.
Mr. Raccoon arrived in this country in 1907, penniless and not
speaking a word of English. Today he is the Mayor of four of
our principal cities.l)
But to get back to the bull session —"What's the best thing
to do when the girl you are dancing with insists on leading?"
Eric Ulna would ask. (Good old Eric! I hear lie's in the flutter
valve game now.)
"Hit her with a folded newspaper," George Vertebra would
answer. "Never hit a girl with your hand. They learn to associ
ate the hand with food, and you must not confuse them." (Good
old George! I hear he's in the folded newspaper game now.)
And so it went —the talk ranging the worlds of the arts and
the sciences and the social graces, until we would climb, spent
but happy, into our little hammocks ... I wonder if they still
make bull sessions the way they used to.

uate days. How cogent they were! How informative! How the
good talk crackled and our young hearts leaped and the hours
sped by as swiftly as minutes!
Our discussions were always led by Jack Femur. (Good old
Jack! I hear he's in the extruded aluminum game now.) We
would sit cross-legged in a circle around Jack and he would (ill
his pipe with his own private blend — hurley, latakia, and shred
ded coconut. The rest of us preferred tobacco, so we would light
up Philip Morris. This is a procedure 1 recommend without qual
ification to everyone who prefers tobacco because Philip Morris
has the tobacco that tobacco-preferers prefer the most mild
vintage leaf with a clean, cool flavor that soothes and steadies,
that gladdens and enlivens and refreshes.
Jack would puff on his pipe and we would puff on our
Philip Morris and the bull-session would begin its meandering
journey. The talk would touch on every subject known to man,
on every conceivable thing beneath the sun, but no matter how
far the conversation wandered, it would always return to "Topic
A." I refer, of course, to gardening.
But, as I say, the discussion would cover many subjects before
it came to the inevitable gardening. Jack would open each session
with a provocative question of a general nature, like: "What's
the most important thing a man can get out of college?"
"Girls," Harold Clavicle would reply promptly. (Good old
Harold! I hear he's in the frozen lobster tail game now.)
"No, I don't think so," Ben Fibula would say. "1 think edu
cation is the most important thing you get out of college."
(Good old P»en! He's still in school.)
"Listen, guys, I've got a question," Clyde IJium would say.
"If you could spend a week either with Ava Gardner or with
Albert Einstein, which would you choose?" (Good old Clyde! 1
hear he's in the unclaimed freight game now.)
"Albert Einstein, of course," Will Mandible would say. (Good
old Will! 1 hear he's in the jack handle game now.)
"What?" Cleanth Patella would cry, astonished. "You would
rather spend a week with Albert Einstein than with Ava
Gardner?" (Good old Cleanth! I hear he's in the unclaimed
freight game with Clyde Ilium.)
"Natch!" Will Mandible would answer. *
"But why?". Sol Sacrum would ask. (Good old Sol! I hear he's
a parking meter in Deal, New Jersey.)
"Because," Will Mandible would cry, "if I spent a week with
Albert Einstein, maybe I would get so smart that 1 would
be able to figure out a wav to spend nmrr than a week with
Ava Gardner!"
w ell sir, we laughed until our lit-tle uvulas were sore and then
we. went on to a host of other topics. "Do you think it's im
portant to join a fraternity?" Murray Tarsus would ask. (Good
old Murray! I hear he's in the mica game now.)
"Only if you are a boy," Bob Turbinate would answer. (Good
old Bob! I hear he's in the sheared raccoon game now. I The
raccoon, incidentally, was invented by Milton Raccoon, whose
career should be a source of guidance and inspiration to us all.
Mr. Raccoon arrived in this country in 1907, penniless and not
speaking a word of English. Today he is the Mayor of four of
our principal cities.l)
But to get back to the bull session —"What's the best thing
to do when the girl you are dancing with insists on leading?"
Eric Ulna would ask. (Good old Eric! I hear lie's in the flutter
valve game now.)
"Hit her with a folded newspaper," George Vertebra would
answer. "Never hit a girl with your hand. They learn to associ
ate the hand with food, and you must not confuse them." (Good
old George! I hear he's in the folded newspaper game now.)
And so it went —the talk ranging the worlds of the arts and
the sciences and the social graces, until we would climb, spent
but happy, into our little hammocks ... I wonder if they still
make bull sessions the way they used to.
