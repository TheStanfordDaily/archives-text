# Frost Takes on Art Larson Today on Stanford Court
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Tennis season on the Farm opens with a bang this afternoon at 2 as Stanford's own Jack Frost
"faces Art Larsen across the net in what should be a smoking-hot singles exhibition.
The match is at the varsity court, open to the general public, and admission is free. But spec
tators should get there early for a good seat as coach Bob Renker anticipates a large turnout.
Following the singles exhibition a doubles match is tentatively scheduled between Frost- Jackie
Douglas and Larsen Jerry DeWitts.
This singles match may be one of the best in Northern California this spring. Larsen is currently

I ranked fourth in the nation in men's
I singles play. He has consistently
; rated as one of the top American
| players in recent years. Larsen's
i best season was in 1950. when he
i captured the U.S. .men's singles title
: at Forrest Hills.
Although that was his best year,
j Larsen has held numerous titles
' since then, including national clay

courts champion in 15)52 and men's
indoor champion in 1953.
Larsen's strongest point in his
play is his great retrieving ability.
Known far and wide as a "screw
ball," Larsen plays somewhat er
ratically. When he feels right he
can beat any amateur playing today.
When bored or displeased Larsen
has broken up many a match with
his clowning and goofing-ofi' on the
court.
The unprectable Larsen is
known as a man who scorns train
ing. He customarily drinks several
cokes and possibly eats a hamburger
during the course of a match. It is
rumored that he also eats ball boys
and linemen alive, but this is exag
gerated—slightly.
Larsen will be dead serious to
morrow, however. Jack Frost is the
best player Stanford has had since
the days of Ted Schroeder. The

stocky junior from Monterey is
ranked 12th in the nation. He im
proved greatly over the past year,
particularly on the tough summer
circuit when he scored surprise up
sets over fifth-ranked Straight Clark
and first-ranked Vic Seixas.
Frost's stock in trade is the pqwer
with which he can clout a tennis
ball. The former junior champion
can nearly blast a man off the court
when he is trying to hit the ball
hard.
Larsen was somewhat off his usual
form at the end of the summer and
may find a tougher job than he ex
pected in beating Frost.
The doubles match, if played, will
be the first local appearance of
freshman Jackie Douglas. Douglas,
rated 30th nationally, is one of the
top young players around. He is
third in junior standing behind Jer
ry Moss and Mike Green.

third in junior standing behind Jer
ry Moss and Mike Green.
Tennis season on the Farm opens with a bang this afternoon at 2 as Stanford's own Jack Frost
"faces Art Larsen across the net in what should be a smoking-hot singles exhibition.
The match is at the varsity court, open to the general public, and admission is free. But spec
tators should get there early for a good seat as coach Bob Renker anticipates a large turnout.
Following the singles exhibition a doubles match is tentatively scheduled between Frost- Jackie
Douglas and Larsen Jerry DeWitts.
This singles match may be one of the best in Northern California this spring. Larsen is currently

I ranked fourth in the nation in men's
I singles play. He has consistently
; rated as one of the top American
| players in recent years. Larsen's
i best season was in 1950. when he
i captured the U.S. .men's singles title
: at Forrest Hills.
Although that was his best year,
j Larsen has held numerous titles
' since then, including national clay

courts champion in 15)52 and men's
indoor champion in 1953.
Larsen's strongest point in his
play is his great retrieving ability.
Known far and wide as a "screw
ball," Larsen plays somewhat er
ratically. When he feels right he
can beat any amateur playing today.
When bored or displeased Larsen
has broken up many a match with
his clowning and goofing-ofi' on the
court.
The unprectable Larsen is
known as a man who scorns train
ing. He customarily drinks several
cokes and possibly eats a hamburger
during the course of a match. It is
rumored that he also eats ball boys
and linemen alive, but this is exag
gerated—slightly.
Larsen will be dead serious to
morrow, however. Jack Frost is the
best player Stanford has had since
the days of Ted Schroeder. The

stocky junior from Monterey is
ranked 12th in the nation. He im
proved greatly over the past year,
particularly on the tough summer
circuit when he scored surprise up
sets over fifth-ranked Straight Clark
and first-ranked Vic Seixas.
Frost's stock in trade is the pqwer
with which he can clout a tennis
ball. The former junior champion
can nearly blast a man off the court
when he is trying to hit the ball
hard.
Larsen was somewhat off his usual
form at the end of the summer and
may find a tougher job than he ex
pected in beating Frost.
The doubles match, if played, will
be the first local appearance of
freshman Jackie Douglas. Douglas,
rated 30th nationally, is one of the
top young players around. He is
third in junior standing behind Jer
ry Moss and Mike Green.
