## 
### 
MOSCOW — Foreign Minister V.
M. Molotov told the wildly cheering
Soviet parliament today that Russia
is stronger than the United States
in the hydrogen bomb field.
The Soviets have developed a
"tremendous capacity for making
hydrogen bombs," Molotov said in a
bristling speech setting the course
of foreign policy under the reorgan
ized government.
He accused the United States of
"aggression," particularly against
Communist China in the Formosa
dispute, an "imperialist" policy
which he said was "leading toward a
third world war."
Relations between the United
States and Russia could be im
proved, Molotov said, but only if the
United States government, "demon
strates the desire to do so."
In any case, he insisted, the Unit
ed States has no edge at. all over the
Soviets in the strength to wage war.
