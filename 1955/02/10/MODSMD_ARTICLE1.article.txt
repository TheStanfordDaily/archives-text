# MILITARY BALL
## ROTC to Host 500 at Dance 
### EARL CILLEY 
The three Stanfoid ROTC units will play host to more than 500
Farm ROTC cadets and their dates at the annual Military Ball to
morrow night at the Sheraton-Palace Hotel in San Francisco. The
Military's biggest social event of the year will be held in the Rose
Room of the Sheraton-Palace from 9 to 1, with Otto Clare and his

eight-piece NBC Studio Orchestra
supplying the music.
Limited strictly to cadets of the
ROTC units at Stanford, the dance
is sponsored jointly by the three
service cadet honor societies, the
Army's Scabbard and Blade, the
Navy's Quarterdeck Society, and the
Arnold Air Society of the Air Force.
The highlight of this week's pre-
Ball activities has been the "Queens
of the Ball" contest conducted by
the three services to determine
which three of all of the coeds nom
inated will reign over the Ball as
Queens of the respective services.
This year's Air Force Queen is
Nancy Boeseke, a sophomore from
Roth House, who was picked by the
members of the Arnold Air Society
and a cadet delegate from each of
the four classes at Stanford from
nominations turned in by the cadets.
The Quarterdeck Society picked
Roble freshman Virginia Nielson as
the Navy's choice. The Scabbard
and Blade Society chose Judy Mal
loy, Lagunita senior, as its queen.
The three queens and their es
corts will be special guests at a pri
vate reception to be held before the
dance. At the reception they will
have the opportunity to meet offi
cers of the three honor societies,
military faculty members, and
guests.
