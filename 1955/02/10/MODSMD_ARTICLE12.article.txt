# Charity Drive Donations Lag
## 
### 
The Stanford Boathouse continues
to lead the way in per capita contri
butions for the Winter Quarter
Charity Drive, but the drive is still
a long way from its $6,000 goal.
Two days—today and tomorrow— J
remain in which to reach the drive j
goal, and although there have been
some bright spots in living group
contributions, generally the drive is
somewhat lagging. Eric Field, treas
urer for the drive, announced that
contributions as of last night totaled i
$608.24. This figure does not include
the money collected in Monday's
"Penny Mile."
Off-campus contributions so far
have been especially disappointing, [
according to drive chairman Fred j
Ruhland. Approximately 1,200 off- j
campus students have been con- |
tacted by mail for donations, and j
Ruhland emphasizes that it is im- j
perative that these people make j
contributions if the drive is to reach
its goal.
Any off-campus student who ei
ther did not get a letter or misplaced
the one he received may leave his
donation in a container marked for :
off - campus donations at the en
trance to the Cellar.
In addition to the Boathouse, j
whose $1.50 contribution per per-!
son continues to set the pace, there j
are also four fraternities with per
capita donations of $I—the1 —the Phi Psis, 1
the Fi j is, the Alpha Sigs, and the j
Thcta Delts. Leading women's .resi
dence is Hurlburt with 70 cents, I
closely followed by the Union Units
with 77 cents. Roth and Jordan
hou'es have 52 ccnts and 45 cents
respectively.
Money may be turned in to the
office in the Nitcry today and to
morrow between 1 and 5 p.m.
