## Coed Given Probation 
### 
Women's Council recently found a
woman guilty of a Fundamental
Standard violation on the grounds
that she put individual convenience
over general security of her house.
The offense occurred after Christ
as vacation, when the woman re
turned to her Row house at 6:15
a.m. She did not remember that
the house did not open until 8 a.m.,
and attempted, unsuccessfully, to
rouse someone to let her in. Then
her companion entered through a
window and opened the door so she
could enter.
This behavior constitutes improp
er entrance and entrance before
opening hours, the breaking of two
university regulations.
The Council declared this a Fun
damental Standard violation on the
ground that the woman had shown
"lack of careful consideration of
standards maintained by the group
in placing her convenience above
their security."
The Council placed the woman on
social probatiort with restriction of
late leaves for the remainder of
winter quarter.
