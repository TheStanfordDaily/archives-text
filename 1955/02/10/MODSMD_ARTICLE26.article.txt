# Code Clarification Passed by Excom
## 
### BILL WRIGHT Associate Editor, The Daily 
The ASSU Executive Committee voted tonight to restrict exami
nations to the class room unless alternate seats are not available
or unless consent is given by the instructor.
In its decision Excom approved the change in the Honor Code
provisions of the ASSU by-laws as recommended by the special

Honor Code Sub-committee headed
by Ann Irvine.
The change to Article 1, Section 2,
subsection c, reads as follows: "Pro
vided that alternate seats are avail
able, tests will be taken from the
class room only with the consent of
the instructor."
The change in the examination
system will go into effect at the be
ginning of spring quarter.
The decision was finally made by
a voice vote after almost two hours
of discussion on the motion as passed
and various substitute motions and
amendments. ASSU President Pete
Bing announced two voice votes
against the motion, and Roberta
Clark and Steve Voykovich said
after the meeting that they had voted
"no."
NOT A CHANGE
Bing emphasized that no change
has been made in the students' Hon
or Code privilege itself. The change
in the by-laws merely codifies the
original understanding of the mean
ing of the Honor Code.
Until last night there had been no
legislation on the question of taking
examinations from the class room.
That custom (which a questioner of
last spring indicated that many stu
dents now thought to be a right)
developed after World War II when
cramped facilities caused instructors
to allow exams to leave the testing
room.
According to the study by Miss
Irvine's committee, most complaints
about the effectiveness of the Honor
Code resulted from the habit of tak
ing tests from the class room. And
one of the main arguments advanced
in Excom last night was that the
Honor Code will not work if their
is dissension about it.
EXCOM OPINIONS
Dave Jenks, of the special Honor
Code Committee, said, "It won't
work if people are unhappy." Sam
Palmer, Men's Row representative,
said that restricting exams to class
rooms was part of the "common
law" of the campus.
Advocates of the provision think
it will lessen dissatisfaction about
the Honor Code by strengthening
third person responsibility.
Suggestions that the by - law
change be subject to a student ref
erendum were discarded. Because
Excom has the power to change by
laws, any student referendum would
be just a straw vote.
