# a
						high-school problem ... an editorial
## 
### 
What this University needs is money: the
Library needs it, the professors need it, the
Business Office needs it, and just about every
one else would like some too.
C. L. Blacker, the superintendent of buildings
and grounds, tell us what is happening to a
small but increasing fraction of what little
money the University does have: His men are
spending more and more of their time picking
up papers off the grounds. Gum wrappers,
paper cups, cigarette packages . . . just about
anything that can be crumpled up and cast
aside.
You'd think it was snowing.
There's paper lying around the Cellar in the
afternoon and in the bushes on Quad and along

every walkway on campus. The situation is
getting worse all the time, Blacker points out.
You'd think this was an editorial for a high
school paper. Scrap paper on the grounds is a
high-school problem; what is it doing at Stan
ford? We've got a good-looking campus and
an intelligent student body . . . too intelligent
to waste the University's money and detract
from the University's appearance by throwing
scrap paper on the grounds.
Blacker is the first to admit we need more
trash cans, but there are quite a few now, and
it doesn't take much looking to find one. Next
time you v/ear out a package of cigarettes, try
finding that trash can!
It'll show you're a college student . . .
