News item: The ASSU is buying a 52.000
CinemaScope screen for the Sunday Flicks.
Two thousand dollars for a movie screen?
My, oh, my.
That's real loot and before the ASSU spends
it they ought to think of how they could better
use two grand to improve the grand old Flicks,
just think of the terrific noise-inekers that could
be had at that price. Who cares about the
screen at those Sunday night earthquakes?
The noise is the thing. Bigger screens aren't
the answer to better Flick-time, it's bigger and
better noise.
What about a real honest-to-goodness San
Francisco fog horn or maybe an air raid siren?
Boy! Could we boo them villains then!
Or, h~'v 'bout installing built-in bronx-cheer
mak~ra 41 ; every seat? Merely press a little
button cmd the dirty guys on the screen (makes
no difference whether its' a CinemaScope job
or not; they're still meanies) have had their
come-uppance, Stanford style.
These handy individual push-botton instal
lations would be a real God-send to the tired
Flick-goers who, having studied too hard Sat
urday night, haven't the strength to give out
with the proper sounds.
So, you see, the ASSU would be giving ev
eryone a good deal.

And, mo3t of all, they'd be upholding our fair
University. Obviously the more noise at the
Flicks, the better the show. And the better the
show, the happier the spectators. And the hap
pier the spectators, the better their morale.
And the better their morale, the better their
grades. And the better their grades, the better
the University's standing.
Also, this CinSkmaScope screen might cut
down attendance. Most of the local movie pal
aces have CinemaScope and Saturday after
noon kiddie shows. Ever been to one of these?
Very familiar indeed. Of course the noise at
these is not quite up to the high Stanford stand
ing. But give the kids a break . . . they haven't
had the benefit of university training. How
ever, the atmosphere is much the same, and
since the Flicks, with CinemaScope, wouldn't
offer the uniqueness which they do now, many
loyal Flickers would join the Saturday after
noon crowd and spend Sunday nights on malt
research.
So ASSU, please don't break our fair tradi
tions. Uphold Stanford and all that it stands
for.
Yours for bigger and better noise, but not
bigger and better The kiddies have
CinemaScope; let's not sink to their level.
