# I Hear Music ...
## ROGER HAGEN 
### 
These words begin a new
regular Thursday morning fea
ture of The Daily, a column de
vcled to the interests of record
buyers and music-lovers in both
the jazz and classical fields.
And a fitting first item is the ex
citing news of a record that will in
tere I both groups. RCA is due to
release sometime this month a re
cording of a new comppsition by a
German, Rolf Lieberman, with the
provocative title of "Concerto for
Jazz Band and Orchestra," per
formed by the Sauter-Finegan Or
chc t. - a with the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra under Fritz Reiner. Ad
vance report suggest it to be in the
tone-row stylo, but if that frightens
some people, Sauter-Finegan may
win them back."
Bigger news in the record indus
try is that Capitol Records has been
bought by the British giant, Elec
tric;.! a;i.l Mu.;ical Industries, Ltd.
EAIf al'O control. l Angel Records,
the ! IMV m l ies of RCA, and Brit
ish Columbia Records, as well as
many foreii-u record industries. Cap
itol will continue as it is in both
managi merit and policy, but it will
probably soon start issuing English
and continental jazz from the Brit
ish Columbia repertoire.
I'LAN CLASSICS
Of more importance to buyers,
Capitol will soon be releasing clas
sical works from the huge EMI li
brary, which is far'too rich for An
gel alone to distribute in the United
States. And in three years, when
RCA's contract with EMI for the
"II; Master's: Voice" series runs out,
the HMV's too will probably begin
to appear in Capitol and Angel al
bums'. In other words, Capitol may
soon have a selection to rival RCA
and Columbia.
Fans of the Les Elgard dance rec
ords will be glad to hear that he has
finally brought his band west for a
few appearances. Tomorrow night
and Saturday night he will appear
at San Francisco's El Patio Ball
room, Market and Van Ness, from 8
to 2 in hi only Bay Area appear
ance.
Eigard's style of swing is reminis
cent ol the old Bill Finegan arrange
ment:; for Tommy Dorsey in the
four years before the Sauter-Fine
gan band was born and Dorsey be
'an depending on his pre-1940 ar

rangements. 'lhe reason for the sim
ilarity of the Elgard and ttye Fine
gan orchestrations is that Eigard's
arranger, Charles Albertine, studied
under the teacher in New York who
trained both Finegan and Sauter.
Albertine also played oboe in the
S-F band for a while. Eigard's rec
ords are now some of Columbia's
biggest sellers.
WEEKEND EVENTS
As for classical music in the Bay
Area, this weekend is a big one, with
several top-Might performers con
verging here at' once. Tonight at
8:30 Marion Anderson, in recital at
the Opera House, will sing songs by
Pureell, Haydn, Schubert, Saint-
Saens, Spanish songs, and Negro
spirituals. It was Anderson's rich
contralto voice that warmed New
Yorkers' hearts recently at the first
performance by a Negro artist with
the Metropolitan Opera Company.
At the same time tonight the great
Walter Gieseking, against whom
Walter Winchell waged his super
patriot campaign a few years ago,
will play Beethoven's "Sonata in D
Minor," Schubert, Brahms, and nine
pieces by Debussy—at the Berkeley
High School Community Theater.
Tomorrow night at 8:30 in the Vet
erans' Auditorium violinist Tossy
Spivakovsky will play Beethoven's
"Sonata in G Major," Leon Kirche
ner's "Sonata Concertante," and Co
relli, Stravinsky, Smetna, Moussorg
sky, and Copland.
BALLET RUSSE
Remaining performances of the
revived Ballet Russe, with such
stars as Maria Tallchief and Fred
erick Franklin, include the new bal
let based on "The Mikado" on Sun
day's matinee program, and that
night the popular "Gaite Parisi
enne," the score of which was ably
culled by Rosenthal in 1938 from the
operas of Offenbach. The last ballet
program will be Monday night with
these favorites: "Swan Lake," "The
Nutcracker," "Scheherazade," and a
pas cle deux from "Don Quixote."
This heavy weekend is rounded
out by the appearance of violinist

S-F band for a while. Eigard's rec
ords are now some of Columbia's
biggest sellers.
WEEKEND EVENTS
As for classical music in the Bay
Area, this weekend is a big one, with
several top-Might performers con
verging here at' once. Tonight at
8:30 Marion Anderson, in recital at
the Opera House, will sing songs by
Pureell, Haydn, Schubert, Saint-
Saens, Spanish songs, and Negro
spirituals. It was Anderson's rich
contralto voice that warmed New
Yorkers' hearts recently at the first
performance by a Negro artist with
the Metropolitan Opera Company.
At the same time tonight the great
Walter Gieseking, against whom
Walter Winchell waged his super
patriot campaign a few years ago,
will play Beethoven's "Sonata in D
Minor," Schubert, Brahms, and nine
pieces by Debussy—at the Berkeley
High School Community Theater.
Tomorrow night at 8:30 in the Vet
erans' Auditorium violinist Tossy
Spivakovsky will play Beethoven's
"Sonata in G Major," Leon Kirche
ner's "Sonata Concertante," and Co
relli, Stravinsky, Smetna, Moussorg
sky, and Copland.
BALLET RUSSE
Remaining performances of the
revived Ballet Russe, with such
stars as Maria Tallchief and Fred
erick Franklin, include the new bal
let based on "The Mikado" on Sun
day's matinee program, and that
night the popular "Gaite Parisi
enne," the score of which was ably
culled by Rosenthal in 1938 from the
operas of Offenbach. The last ballet
program will be Monday night with
these favorites: "Swan Lake," "The
Nutcracker," "Scheherazade," and a
pas cle deux from "Don Quixote."
This heavy weekend is rounded
out by the appearance of violinist
Isaac Stern here in Memorial Audi
torium next Monday night at 8:15.
Watch for: Dave Brubeck at the
Downbeat late in February; Art Ta
tum at the Blackhawk Feb. 22; an
interesting series of chamber music
programs at Opus One Sunday af
ternoons and Tuesday evenings, by
local musicians.
These words begin a new
regular Thursday morning fea
ture of The Daily, a column de
vcled to the interests of record
buyers and music-lovers in both
the jazz and classical fields.
And a fitting first item is the ex
citing news of a record that will in
tere I both groups. RCA is due to
release sometime this month a re
cording of a new comppsition by a
German, Rolf Lieberman, with the
provocative title of "Concerto for
Jazz Band and Orchestra," per
formed by the Sauter-Finegan Or
chc t. - a with the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra under Fritz Reiner. Ad
vance report suggest it to be in the
tone-row stylo, but if that frightens
some people, Sauter-Finegan may
win them back."
Bigger news in the record indus
try is that Capitol Records has been
bought by the British giant, Elec
tric;.! a;i.l Mu.;ical Industries, Ltd.
EAIf al'O control. l Angel Records,
the ! IMV m l ies of RCA, and Brit
ish Columbia Records, as well as
many foreii-u record industries. Cap
itol will continue as it is in both
managi merit and policy, but it will
probably soon start issuing English
and continental jazz from the Brit
ish Columbia repertoire.
I'LAN CLASSICS
Of more importance to buyers,
Capitol will soon be releasing clas
sical works from the huge EMI li
brary, which is far'too rich for An
gel alone to distribute in the United
States. And in three years, when
RCA's contract with EMI for the
"II; Master's: Voice" series runs out,
the HMV's too will probably begin
to appear in Capitol and Angel al
bums'. In other words, Capitol may
soon have a selection to rival RCA
and Columbia.
Fans of the Les Elgard dance rec
ords will be glad to hear that he has
finally brought his band west for a
few appearances. Tomorrow night
and Saturday night he will appear
at San Francisco's El Patio Ball
room, Market and Van Ness, from 8
to 2 in hi only Bay Area appear
ance.
Eigard's style of swing is reminis
cent ol the old Bill Finegan arrange
ment:; for Tommy Dorsey in the
four years before the Sauter-Fine
gan band was born and Dorsey be
'an depending on his pre-1940 ar

rangements. 'lhe reason for the sim
ilarity of the Elgard and ttye Fine
gan orchestrations is that Eigard's
arranger, Charles Albertine, studied
under the teacher in New York who
trained both Finegan and Sauter.
Albertine also played oboe in the

Bigger news in the record indus
try is that Capitol Records has been
bought by the British giant, Elec
tric;.! a;i.l Mu.;ical Industries, Ltd.
EAIf al'O control. l Angel Records,
the ! IMV m l ies of RCA, and Brit
ish Columbia Records, as well as
many foreii-u record industries. Cap
itol will continue as it is in both
managi merit and policy, but it will
probably soon start issuing English
and continental jazz from the Brit
ish Columbia repertoire.
I'LAN CLASSICS
Of more importance to buyers,
Capitol will soon be releasing clas
sical works from the huge EMI li
brary, which is far'too rich for An
gel alone to distribute in the United
States. And in three years, when
RCA's contract with EMI for the
"II; Master's: Voice" series runs out,
the HMV's too will probably begin
to appear in Capitol and Angel al
bums'. In other words, Capitol may
soon have a selection to rival RCA
and Columbia.
Fans of the Les Elgard dance rec
ords will be glad to hear that he has
finally brought his band west for a
few appearances. Tomorrow night
and Saturday night he will appear
at San Francisco's El Patio Ball
room, Market and Van Ness, from 8
to 2 in hi only Bay Area appear
ance.
Eigard's style of swing is reminis
cent ol the old Bill Finegan arrange
ment:; for Tommy Dorsey in the
four years before the Sauter-Fine
gan band was born and Dorsey be
'an depending on his pre-1940 ar

rangements. 'lhe reason for the sim
ilarity of the Elgard and ttye Fine
gan orchestrations is that Eigard's
arranger, Charles Albertine, studied
under the teacher in New York who
trained both Finegan and Sauter.
Albertine also played oboe in the
S-F band for a while. Eigard's rec
ords are now some of Columbia's
biggest sellers.

verging here at' once. Tonight at

regular Thursday morning fea

vcled to the interests of record

And a fitting first item is the ex
citing news of a record that will in
tere I both groups. RCA is due to

German, Rolf Lieberman, with the
provocative title of "Concerto for
Jazz Band and Orchestra," per
