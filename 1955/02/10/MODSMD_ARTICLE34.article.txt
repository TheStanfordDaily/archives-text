# Stu-Fac Com Discusses Faculty Dinner Failures
## 
### DOROTHY CAMPBELL 
The failure of faculty dinners
in large living groups to fulfill
their function in bringing about
friendly relations between stu
dents and faculty members was
the main topic of discussion at
the first meeting of the Student-
Faculty Committee last week.
The 2G students on the committee
li f.ned while an equal number of
profi s 01 s they had invited to the
Women'; Clubhouse for sandwiches
and <li icu.-sion made suggestions.
The Student-Faculty Committee is
tiu> newest standing committee of
ASSU. It was founded to help im
prove relations between the students
and faculty members.
One professor began the discus
ion by describing his own expe
rience:. when invited to a dinner at
a large residence. "When the doors
of the dining room are thrown open,
you stand back or you're done for
. . . As a dinner guest, you feel
obliged to talk. If you talk, you
can't eat. The hashers are very
adept at removing your plate in this
case, it would be nice if these af
fi: il':- were more leisurely. One is
still trying to break the ice when it's
time to leave."
A i:J .lent .suggested that the sit
uation be remedied by having a
mall group of students personally
invite professors who advise them
or in whose classes they are en
rolled.
Several opinions wore offered on
whether students and professors
should get together in semi-aca
(h mic clubs, or on a purely social
basis.
One professor said, "I dislike to
think that I have nothing to offer
my students except chemistry." An
other said, "I am violently opposed
to a formal program of any kind. As
soon as wo declare, 'Come at this

hour, talk about this, and leave at
this hour,' spontaneity is lost; each
side is merely going through its
paces."
One of his colleagues expressed
doubt that students would respond
to friendly overtures from the fac
ulty. A student agreed that over
coming student apathy is one of the
biggest jobs the Student - Faculty
Committee is facing.
