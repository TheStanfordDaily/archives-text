### RAY WADDINGTON 
Art Larsen came from behind to defeat Sanford's Jack Frost in
j three sets, 7-9, 6-4, G-4, before a packed gallery at the Stanford
courts yesterday afternoon. In a doubles exhibition, the combina
tion of Frost and Jackie Douglas trounced Larsen and Jerry De-
I Witts in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4.
I The singles exhibition featured some excellent playing for the

earliness of the season. Frost showed
himself to be much more poised and
in much'better form than he was a
year ago this time. The junior from
Monterey, rated 12th in the nation,
took everything fourth ranked Lar
sen had to offer and gave back
more for a set and a half.
Midway in the second set the
wily Lax'sen's greater experience was

evident as he got Frost on the run
and wore him down. Larsen won
the ninth game on a double fault by
Frost then .slashed baek on his serve
to take the .set (5-4.
Frost was definitely tired as the
thi I'll set bi\.;an. Larsen, a left
hander, swept four straight games,
seemingly as frc-h as when he start
ed. Frost and Larsen traded a pair
of games then Frost rallied strongly
to capture the next three games. Lar
sen bore down and took the next
game to win set and match.
Larsen's partner DeWitts did lit
tle to make the doubles match in
teresting. Freshman Jackie Douglas
played quite well in his first Stan
ford appearance.
