# Breakers Topple El Tigre, 36-34
## 
### MORT BROWN 
In a very loosely played game at
Encina gym last night the Breakers
outlasted El Tigre, 36-32. Breakers
were led by center Frank Herrmann
who led all scorers for the evening,
netting 16 points mostly on jump
shots and tip-ins under the basket.
First-half play was slow with
neither gaining an advantage. Break
ers led at the half-time mark 16-14.
Doug Warner kept Tigre going with
two foul circle jump shots and some
aggressive rebounding.
As second half play started, Tigre
appeared as if they were going to
run away with the contest by scor
ing seven quick points to the Break
ers' one. Tigre cooled off right away
allowing the Breakers to catch up
and go ahead. The game was a nip
and-tuck affair right up until the
last few minutes when Herrmann
dropped in three quick buckets to
chalk up the Breakers' third win
in as many starts.
High scorers for the Breakers be
sides Herrmann were Dave O'Hara
and Weitzner, with six points each
and Bob Wiseman with four. Tigre
was led by Walt Wunderlich with
eight points and McPhail with six.
