# Oxford Theologian Talks On Psychology of Jung
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Discussing the German psy
chologist Carl C. Jung and his in
influence on analytical psychol
ogy, the Reverend Victor White
of Oxford University gave the
first in a series of two lectures
yesterday afternoon on the rela
tion of theology and psychology.
Father White will speak on the
subject of "Guilt in Theology and
Psychology" this afternoon at 4:15
in the lower lounge of tch Women's
Clubhouse.
Tracing the development of Jung's
ideas and his disagreement with
Freudian concepts, Father White
described Jung's theory that dreams
must be considered more from their
"manifest, rather than latent con
tent."
The early twentith century psy
chologist made use of the principle
of free association to interpret the
various symbols in dreams, Father
White pointed out. Jung combined
material from his patient's dreams
with bygone myths, patterns, tradi
tions, and legends to help solve the
letter's psychiatric problems.
Heretofore, it was thought by
Freud and others that repressions
were behind all dream manifesta
tions. Freud believed that under
hypnosis patients would remember
events that they eould»not have re
called before, and talking with the
patient afterward would bring about
some cure.
"Jung," Father White said, "was
less interested in the causes of the
disorder and more in the dynamics
of the situation." He also thought
that discussing these repressions did
more harm than good.
Jung developed four basic func
tions which enable analytical psy
chologists to make their studies,
these being extroversion, introver
sion, regression, and progression.
Father White also discussed Jung's
study of alchemy and his theory that
the old lore arose, not from prin
ciples of chemistry, but of psychol
ogy.
Father White, who said he turned
to the study of psychology when he
became tired of theology, was callod
by Jung his "best theological inter
preter." Father White now teaches
theology at Oxford University and
is visiting Dominican centers in the
United States.
