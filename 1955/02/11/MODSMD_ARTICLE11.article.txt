"We have an excellent, chance of

not endeared himself to California's
voters by his vote on the McCarthy

of the state Legislature, so we can
rearrange the districts as skillfully
as the Republicans did. In 1952 the
Democrats got 51 per cent of the
vote and got only 11 out of 30 Con
gressional scats. I don't, begrudge
the Republicans of this gerryman
