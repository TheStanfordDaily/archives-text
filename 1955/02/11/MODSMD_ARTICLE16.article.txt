# Indian Cagers Go on Southern Warpath, Face Bruins in Crucial Weekend Series
## Southern Division PCC Championship Will Be At Stake in Small UCLA 'Sweatbox' Gym 
### DON WEBSTER 
LOS ANGELES — Stanford's
basketball team travels to West
wood's Boy gymna
sium tonight to face a man-sized
UCLA Bruin quintet, and the
PCC Southern Division cage ti
tle hangs in the balance.
The clubs arc Hod for the loop
lead with 5-1 records. USC is tem
porarily out of contention with a
2-4 mark, and California has a 0-6
record to its "credit."
There will be but four league
games remaining after this week
end. so if either team can win a pair
at Westwood, the pennant is vir
tually assured.
The Cards has little hope of
winning a pair, though. They're
praying only for a split. The Bruins
are difficult to defeat anywhere, but
they're murder on their home court.
Ask the nation's top-ranked team,
USF. The Dons suffered their only
loss of the season at Westwood, but
came back later to easily defeat UC
LA at Kczar.
TICKETS SCARCE
To say tickets are scarce here is
quite an understatement. Thf Bruin
sweatbox seats only 2,000 —a full
thousand less than even Stanford
Pavilion's capacity. Southland tele
vision will save the day for fans
here, but a last-minute effort to
have the game telecast to Northern
California has failed. Ah, radio!
The Bruins, ranked seventh in the
nation, sport a 15-3 record. Their
only losses have been to La Salle
(and Tom Gola), USF (and Bill Rus
sell), and Stanford (and Ron Tom
sic).
UCLA features a well - rounded

attack with a quick, big club. Their
offense doesn't revolve around any
one player. Every one is a bis scor
ing threat, and they all can be
benehed for someone almost as good.
THE WHALE
Willie (The Whale) Naulls is the
club's starting center. The 6-5 jun
ior is a threat to score on offense
and a threat to foul on defense.
Against USC, "The Whale" scored
25 points on Friday night, and then
fouled out. quickly Saturday with
out scoring a point. If the referees
watch him guarding Lawler, he can
be stopped.
Don Bragg is one of the Bruin
forwards. He is an excellent floor
man, but in four years on the var
sity has averaged only eight points

per game. He had one of the best
scoring weekends of his career last
week, bucketing 22 and 12 points
respectively against Cal. But that
still is less than Tomsic had on Fri
day night alone.
John Moore is the other forward
He seems to be an "off and on"
player, sometimes pacing the team
and other times hardly trying to.
His "on" nights have been mostly in
league play, and he is the top Bruin
scorer in the PCC competition.
Naulls is, the top scorer in overall
action.
Morris Taft is a fast, tricky tjuard"
with a great jump shot from any
where on the court. On one hand,

he must, bo closely guarded to .stop
his jump shot, but lie may on tho
other hand straak right past you i
too closely guarded.
Eddie White, who tallied 28 poi.nl>
in one evening agednst Stanford, in
fighting unsuccessfully for tlie other
starting guard spot. He's also ei
ratic—scored 28 one night and only
four the other. La.st. week, JRon
Bane him out of the starting
berth, and will probably see much
of the action at the fifth spot, Whjif
is superior defensively, Bane offen -
sively. ,
GOOD SUBS
So, there you are A quintot of
good players with some high-qual
ity substitution material to match.
None of the Bruins look good all the
time. But so far this season, enough
of them have been hot in any on
game to give their opponents --:i
rough time.
In the series earlier this smson
that was split at fhfc Pavilion, tfne
Bruins were edged, fil-56, in the
first game. Stanford played all fn •
of their starters the whole time, ,?nd
the weariness showed its effect the
following evening when the Uclan .
rolled, 91-75.
Stanford's coach, Howie Dollmar,
learned a lesson there. He'll sub
stitute when necessary tonight, and
give his first-stringers a rest.
Even though the Cards were re
pressive in dumping the Tro;
twice last weekend, USC Coach Foi
rest Twogood predicted herf: yc.v.
day that the Bruins would win both
games. "UCLA's backboard p< ".y
will make the difference."
TOMSIC "TREMENDOUS"
- Main Bruin obstacle is Tom: <*,
who netted 67 points last weeke.
"Tomsic is tremendous," Toogie . d.
"I thought Dick. Welsh played I
well Friday, but he scored 40 poii
No one man can stay with that boy
when he's hot."
UCT.A Coach John Wooden
Taft will draw the assignment < \
guarding Tomsic. He hoper !
speed and agility will bottle v;> '
5-11 ace. "I'd like to put Tafl,
and another boy on him," Wood,
commented. "We tried Brag.; in t 1
first game of our series at Palo Alio,
but Tomsic is too fast and quick fui
Don."
In the second Bruin game at t! -
Pavilion. Tninsie could get but thrt
field goals with Taft guarding. E *'
on the other hand, he wasn't sc -
ing any 40 points a game tl
against anyone. He's much in
proved.
Pairing with Tomsic at the cuaid
spots is George Selleck. Though iv-'
as high a scorer this season as la '
(when he was second in the divi
sion), Selleck is the man who inak<v;


RON TOMSIC

GEORGE SELL EC K
—Keeps team going


RUSS LAWLKR
—Has herculean task


BARRY BROWN
—\ rebounding job ahead


It!LI- BOND
—Makes Cards great
the team go—floor leader, play call -
er. and ball handler.
Russ Lawler and Barry Brown, i
center and forward, have the hercu- i
lean task before them of getting the
Stanford rebounds against the entire i
(all Bruin team. Lawler is 6-6V2, !
Brown G-5.
The other Jo rward, Bill Bond, is j
the club's only starting sophomore.
Twogood insists that Bond is the
fellow who makes Stanford a great
club. After a slow start, he has
come along well and now is a good
floor man and a definite scoring
thi eat.
These two games will be the last
home contests of the season for the
Brains. They play four more—
at Berkeley and two at Long Beach
(against USC). Stanford's remain
ing games are at Pan Pacific against
the Trojans and a home-and-home
series with the Bears. So a split this
weekend might give Stanford an
ever-so-slight edge.
That's all they want — a split.
Their opponents are the UCLA team
and the Westwood court.
