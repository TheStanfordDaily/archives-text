twirl last Wednesday night, dis
cussing student questions on
l subjects ranging from academics

to finances, during a "Stanford
â€”Today and Tomorrow" ses
sion at Stanford Village.
Sterling, noting that the Universi
ty's academic program is undergoing
thorough scrutiny by a special study
committee said, "There is a need to
strengthen the advisory system and
to reduce the wide range of electives."
"Fifty percent of the courses could
hr thrown out," ho declared, adding
that "they grow like toxia and surg
ery is required soon."
He stated that a recent study here
revealed that faculty members be
lieve that there is some "undue em
phasis on research" at. Stanford. The
president added that he believes that,
the role of research is important in
maintaining the competence of Uni
versity faculty.
Turning to the Honor Code, Sterl
ing stressed that, "Unless it Is be
lieved in, it is dead." "It is up to stu
dents to maintain honorable compe
tition even though they are on au
'emery wheel of competition' and un
der constant pressure due to the
quarter system," he added.
The plan of the University is to
apply financial resources to improve
ment of existing facilities rather than
to expand enrollment.
"We are aiming at n numerical
target and tailoring undergraduate
curriculum with fh;tt target in mind."
