In <1 businesslike, informed debate, Excom
clarified the question of taking examinations
from the classroom for students and faculty
members alike Wednesday night.
What Excom did, in effect, was to put down
in writing what study and discussion have de
termined to be an originally intended, but
never codified, application of the Honor Code.
The move is of primary benefit to the student
himself. First it assures him of a better opera
lion of collective responsibility, the responsi
bility Stanford students assumed in 1921 in re-
Uun fcr i privilege granted by the Academic
' Jo'.ii) llowing the students to proctor their

own examinations.
It sets down in writing just what the extent
of the student's privileges are in the matter: If
alternate seats are not provided, he may leave
the room to seek space in which to work. If
alternate seats are provided, he may leave
only with the consent of the instructor.
The Council for Student Control will benefit
by having a code from which to work. The
faculty will know more clearly what its rights
and obligations are.
In setting down in black and white one of
the most important concepts of the Honor
dodo, Excom has done Stanford a real service.
