To t.he Editor:
I do not think that yesterday's Bull Session by Dick
MeUter requires any comment on my part. But I do
think that ii retraction, of some kind is in order con
< i ming a gross mistatement of fact.
It such articles continue in the Daily about a Cine
ma: cope screen, the students are going to be disap
pointed because we arc not buying one of that de
ception. We are buying a wide screen of dimensions
33 by 27 feet to be shot at a 1.37-1 ratio. As a test
• howing proved, this does not. cut anything from the
top or the bottom of the picture.
'1 he present width is 23 feet. Cinemascope is shot
:iL a 2.55-1 ratio; therefore, the new screen would be
wide enough but not ideal as to top and bottom <>!'
picture. We can install Cinemascope eventually, but
thi would cost $2000 more for the Auamorphie lens'-s

Wo feel'that it i. better to install Cinemascope in two
steps; first, the wide screen, then the lenses.
If in about two years most pictures are being made
in Cinemascope we can consider the second step. It
not we will still have a wide screen. We felt that our
pr esent screen because of its 17-year age and its small
..i/.e needed replacing since every major theater today
has at least a wide screen.
There has been some comment that 20 cents is too
exorbitant a price to charge Stanford students. In
the last two years we have been showing films of a
quality that rate $1 anywhere else. At 20 cents we
do make "a profit -and so to give the students their
money' ; worth, we are buying a wide screen.
