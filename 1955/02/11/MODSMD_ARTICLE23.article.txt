Look Magazine has been on the newsstands
for several years now and has progressed from
n cheap periodical to an inexpensive periodi
< al. In fact, Look Magazine seems to be a well
written and informative semi-news magazine.
The reason I mention this is the editors of
l.'jck had better look to their laurels and go to
: leep counting their blessings and circulation,
because something is about to happen that
f.ould change their whole pattern of success.
And I am about to convey this bit of intelli
gence to you. This is another Daily exclusive.
Well, sir, your correspondent has not been
standing still. In fact he has been more or less
sitting still. A good way to gather items of
general interest is to sit still while other people
-<re talking. â€¢
The other day people were talking and I
v/as sitting still at a local spa. These people
were discussing a magazine that is designed,
for a time at least, to take the place of Look
Magazine. The name for this magazine is as
yet undecided but will probably be similar

to Look in an effort to catch the consumer off
guard.
The makeup and layout will be very similar
to that of Look Magazine and the editorial copy
will be written with the idea in mind that it
should approximate that of Look as closely as
possible. I don't think they will try any actual
plagiarism but they'll come close.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, the reason this
applie:; to you. This new magazine will be tried
first on the students of Stanford University.
Along about March 9, I believe.
The publishers of this new magazine have
not ar; yet come up with any press releases so
I can't give you any more pertinent informa
tion on the nature of the publication However,
even though fill this information was gained
semi-surreptitiously, I was able to get the name
cf the publisher.
The Hammer and Coffin Society, in conjunc
tion with the Associated Students, is about to
assault the better judgment of the student body
wijh another parody issue. You can't hardly
get humor like that nowadays. Not in the
Chaparral.
