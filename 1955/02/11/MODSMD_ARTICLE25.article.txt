# Violinist Isaac Stern to Perform In Concert Series Here Monday
## 
### STEW TOY 
Isaac Stern,-"one of the great
est of contemporary violinists,"
will play lor'the Stanford Con
cert Series Monday night at 8:15
in Memorial Auditorium.
Currently on his 12th consecutive
tour of the United States, Stern has
played in virtually every country in
the world outside the Iron Curtain.
He has just returned from a rec
ord - breaking, around - the - world
tour in which lit- played 125 con
certs.
Stern was born in Kriminiesz,
Russia, in 15)20. His parents brought
him to San Francisco when he was
one year old.
He began playing the piano at the
age of six and the violin at eight, I
his only instruction in the violin i
being that given him by Naoum j
Blinder, concertmaster of the San !
Francisco Symphony. He has never j
studied abroad and is the only ma
jor violinist whose training is ox- |
clusively American.
DEBUT
Stern's debut was with the San j
Francisco Symphony, under Pierre !

Monteux, at the age of 11. Monteux
was immediately enthusiastic, de
claring, "1 haven't heard such play
ing since I listened to the young
Kreisler."
Several West Coast guest appear
ances with the Los Angeles, Port
land, Seattle, and San „Franci.sco
symphonies followed, all under.the
loving direction of Monteux. Stern
received rave notices at all of them.
His New York debut in 1937. at the
age of 17, launched him solidly on
his career as an established artist,
with critics calling him "a master
of his instrument" and "a virtuosi
but a musician."
Season after season in New York,
in cities across the U.S. and in Eu
rope, Israel, South America, Japan,
India, and Australia, critics and au
diences have echoed this enthusi
asm.
"DISTINGUISHED MUSICIAN"
In 1950, 1951, and 1952, Stern was
chosen as one of the distinguished
musicians to play at the Pablo Ca
sals Festivals at Prades and Perji
gnan. He regards this as one of the
great events of his life.
Stern's playing on his priceless
250-year-old Guarnerius violin is

famed for its all-encompassing tech
nique, its commanding sense of mu
sical style, and its superb tone qual
ities.
But his goal in music is not just
to play the violin well. "Let me play
the violin as well as 1 can," he says.
"What is equally important to me is
to iive like a human being. If 1 can
show people that a musician needn't
be eccentric, that music is not a
luxury but is as natural as reading
or arithmetic —if 1 can do that, then
I've really accomplished something."
RECORDINGS
His extensive list of recordings
includes three of the all-time best
j sellers: his Brahms, Tschaikowsky,
| and Wienawski concertos.
I In his Stanford concert Stein will

est of contemporary violinists,"
will play lor'the Stanford Con
cert Series Monday night at 8:15
in Memorial Auditorium.
Currently on his 12th consecutive
tour of the United States, Stern has
played in virtually every country in
the world outside the Iron Curtain.
He has just returned from a rec
ord - breaking, around - the - world
tour in which lit- played 125 con

Stern was born in Kriminiesz,
Russia, in 15)20. His parents brought
him to San Francisco when he was
one year old.
He began playing the piano at the
age of six and the violin at eight, I
his only instruction in the violin i

Stern's debut was with the San j
Francisco Symphony, under Pierre !

Monteux, at the age of 11. Monteux
was immediately enthusiastic, de
claring, "1 haven't heard such play
ing since I listened to the young
Kreisler."
Several West Coast guest appear
ances with the Los Angeles, Port

symphonies followed, all under.the
loving direction of Monteux. Stern
received rave notices at all of them.
His New York debut in 1937. at the
age of 17, launched him solidly on
his career as an established artist,
