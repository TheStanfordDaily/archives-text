# Bufano Works To Be Shown
## 
### 
A .special exhibit of Beniamino
Bufano's recent gifts of sculpture to
Stanford, including the crucyfixion
group, will go on display in the
Museum tomorrow.
Bufano, who has been called
America's great sculptor, gave Stan
ford much of his important work
including his St. Francis in wood
and the head of St. Francis in cop
per. The sculptor, who works with
a wide variety of materials, includ
ing ceramics, wood, and metals, is
widely known for the simplicity,
balance, and dynamic feeling in his
work.
Although his pieces are in great
demand, Bufano has repeatedly re
fused to offer them for sale to private
collectors. Since his creations have
not been "tested in the market
place," it is impossible to calculate
the financial worth of his gift.
The crucifixion set. Is particularly
dramatic. The figure of Jesus, fash
ioned from a large oak tree wit.ii
metal parts added later, dominates
the other redwood figuresâ€”the two
Marys and the two thieves. The set
is his most recent work and re
quired eight years to complete. The
Christ figure is 14 feet in height. In
cluded in the collection is a head of
the artist's mother done at 16 years
of age.
In the Oriental Boom of the mu
seum is an exhibit of Chinese and
Japanese prehistoric pottery.
The Museum is open every day
except Tuesday from 1 to 5 p.m.
