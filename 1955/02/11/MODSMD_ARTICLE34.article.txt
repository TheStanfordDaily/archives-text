Stanford's varsity tennis team
travels to Berkeley tomorrow

Coach Bob Renker anticipates a
good day's work for the Indian net
men with the likes of such players
as Jerry Moss, Harry Likas, Norm
Brooks, and Jerry DeWitts swing
ing rackets for the Cal Club.
Moss i:> just back from Australia
with the victorious Davis Cup team,
lie holds the U.S. junior title and
the Australian junior title. His
tournament play and his perform
ances in .Australia recently have
convinced such authorities-as Jack
Kramer that he is one of the bright
est tennis prospects today.
Likas, 1948 intercollegiate cham
pion, is an experienced amateur who
usually ranks within the top 20
players nationally. Brooks and De-
Witts are both very capable play
ers, although DeWitts' performance
in the.doubles exhibition, Wednes
day did not add to his reputation
locally.
Jack Frost, of course, will lead
the Stanford team. He is tabbed
12th in the nation and probably is
the best intercollegiate player in
the country. Frost lost a singles ex
hibition 7-9, (i-4, G-4 to fourth
ranked Art Larsen of San Leandro
Wednesday, but showed up quite
well for early season.
