# Grapplers on Road Tonight
## 
### 
The Indian varsity wrestlers com
plete the last of a grueling three
nights oi intercollegiate matches to
night when they face an always
strong Cal Poly squad in San Luis
Obispo.
After dropping a hard 21-13 deci
sion to San Jose State Wednesday
night here in the Pavilion, the
Bruce Bailey - coached grapplers
traveled south where they met a
strong UCLA team last night. Re
sults of the Bruin and Mustang
matches will be in Monday's Daily.
Wednesday's competition started
off with a bang for the Stanfords as
veteran 123-pounder Bob Fisher up
set Joe Isasi by pinning him in 2:30
of the second period. Howeve/, the
rest of the bouts were disappointing
for the Cards, as only Pete Likins
and Don Manoukian were able to
score victories.
Manoukian, who is undefeated so
far this year, pinned Jerry Piuse for
a five-pointer, while Likins wres
tled his way to a 5-3 decision over
Ben Fernandez.
A preliminary bout saw the Tribe
frosh lose to the Spartan yearlings,
21-10.
