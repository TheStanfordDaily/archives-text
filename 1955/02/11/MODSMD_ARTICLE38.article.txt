## Father White Talks on 'Guilt' 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Father Victor White of Oxford
University attempted to point out
the differences between the psy
chologist's and theologian's concept
of guilt in a talk yesterday after
noon in the Women's Clubhouse.
To the psychologist, guilt implies
a sense of arising from
an emotional attitude in which suf
fering is virtually unavoidable. But
to the theologian, Father White said,
it is essentially an offense against
God and an evil in which man ex
ists willingly.
The psychologist recognizes that
persons with guilt feelings may be
unable or unwilling to acknowledge
the source of their guilt. "Theolo
gians," he said, "need to learn that
'honest - t.o - God' sin very seldom
leads to psychological problems."
Psychologists feel that guilt feel
ings arise from a "disparity between
reality and the ideal." Father White
pointed out that unconscious moti
vations may really be "subhuman,"
thus bringing about a real sense of
shame.
"External conformity," he said,
"can bring about problems because
of some deep-seated need that may
not be satisfied. Such a guilt sense
cannot be flouted without deep re
percussions."
Guilt must,be brought into the
fullest consciousness, he added.
"Faith in the living symbols of
Christianity has been widely lost.
This is the reason for the ritual and
tradition in the Church to call to
consciousness the existence of guilt."
