# Excom Sets Membership Of New Legislature at 20
## 
### BILL WRIGHT Associate Editor, The Daily 
In addition to codifying Honor Code by-laws on removal of
tests from classrooms, the ASSU Executive Committee decided
Wednesday that the legislative body under the proposed new
constitution should include from 18 to 20 representatives.
The motion by Dave Brownwood, junior class representative,

the legislature of 18 to 20 mem
bers was passed by an 8 to 4 vote
after motions for legislatures of 35
lo 40 and 18 to 26—as well as two
motions to table—were defeated.
The decision to have 18 to 20 in
the legislature is exclusive of cabi
net members. The draft constitution
now under consideration provides
that cabinct. members (about 15)
should be voting members of the
legislature.
SHORT OF PllOP6SAL
The 20 - man legislature would
mean a greater number of represen
tatives elected from living groups
than under the present Excom sys
tem. However, the decision reached
Wednesday is short, of the 33-man
body proposed by the draft consti
tution.
Although in theory a large legis
lature with oach representative
elected by a smaller constituency is
more desirable, Excom felt that a
body of over 20 would be too bulky
to operate efficiently. Steve Voyko
vich, grad representative, said that
be had found on trips for the Na
tional Students Association that
large legislatures on most campuscs
are considered an "open farce."

Excom approved a request of the
Concert Series to give the Speech
and Drama Department $1,000 to
help purchase new black curtains
for Memorial Auditorium. Tlie non
profit Conccrt Series has $6,000 in
its reserve fund and Student Mana
ger Bob Gable expects that another
$1,500 will be made this year.
Another expenditure of $750 from
the Concert Series reserve fund was
approved. This provides for a year
ly Stanford Concert Series Leader
ship Scholarship to be administered
on the same terms as the ASSU
j leadership scholarships. The Con
! cert Series will Continue the schol
arship as long as its reserve fund
remains over $3,000.
Excom also voted Wednesday to
allocate $.'!80 from the contingency
fund to buy Quad pages for which
| money had not been budgeted.

Another expenditure of $750 from
the Concert Series reserve fund was
approved. This provides for a year

ship Scholarship to be administered
on the same terms as the ASSU

remains over $3,000.
Excom also voted Wednesday to

In addition to codifying Honor Code by-laws on removal of
tests from classrooms, the ASSU Executive Committee decided
Wednesday that the legislative body under the proposed new
constitution should include from 18 to 20 representatives.
The motion by Dave Brownwood, junior class representative,

the legislature of 18 to 20 mem
bers was passed by an 8 to 4 vote
after motions for legislatures of 35
lo 40 and 18 to 26—as well as two
motions to table—were defeated.
The decision to have 18 to 20 in
the legislature is exclusive of cabi
net members. The draft constitution
now under consideration provides
that cabinct. members (about 15)
should be voting members of the
legislature.
SHORT OF PllOP6SAL
The 20 - man legislature would
mean a greater number of represen
tatives elected from living groups
than under the present Excom sys
tem. However, the decision reached
Wednesday is short, of the 33-man
body proposed by the draft consti
tution.
Although in theory a large legis
lature with oach representative
elected by a smaller constituency is
more desirable, Excom felt that a
body of over 20 would be too bulky
to operate efficiently. Steve Voyko
vich, grad representative, said that
be had found on trips for the Na
tional Students Association that
large legislatures on most campuscs
are considered an "open farce."

Concert Series to give the Speech
