# Sterling— Honor Code Is Stronger
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
University President Wallace
Sterling and Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler both ap
plauded the ASSU Executive
Committee lor strengthening
the Honor Code by codifying
and clarifying Code by-laws last
week.
"I think that what has been one is
very good," said Dr. Sterling. "And
Ithink the debate has been healthy.
Excom, Miss Irvine's committee (Ann
Irvine was chairman of the special
Honor Code Sub-committee which
drafted the new provision), and the
students thought their way through
to a conclusion which to my way of
thinking is good for the Honor Code."
Dr. Sterling felt that confining ex
amination papers to the classroom ex
cept, when alternate seats are un
available or when the instructor con
sents to their removal "has reason
to it." «
STRENGTH SHOWN
"The strength of the Honor Code,"
he said, "is revealed by the fact that
it can become the subject of intense
debate and emerge as strong as when
it started."
However, lie said that allowing
tests to leave the classroom strains
the foundations of the Code, and "you
don't place an unnecessary burden on
anything."
Dr. Sterling said that he was wor
ried that students were trying to make
a right out of a previously-undefined
privilege. Taking tests out of the
classroom began after World War II
because of crowded conditions and no
express provision in the Honor Code
by-laws.
DEAN PLEASED
Dean Winbigler was also pleased:
"This provision, by removing an am
biguity, will allow the maximum of
flexibility. It is a helpful move." He
said that he expects the Honor Code
principles to operate more success
fully because of the clarification.
"It is my assumption that the
faculty should be very happy with
this provision," Winbigler continued.
"It should work out very well."
He also thought that the faculty
"would welcome" an Honor Code
handbook for the instructor. Winbig
ler said his office would assume the
printing costs of such a booklet. This
is an offer which he extended two
years ago.
