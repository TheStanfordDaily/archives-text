## Cards Tumbled from Lead By Uclans, 85-63, 72-59 
### DON WEBSTER 
WESTWOOD MEN'S GYM, Feb. 12—Though UCLA has a very
good basketball team, they're not a great club and they're far from
invincible. But on their home court at Westwood, the Bruins are
both those things.
Stanford's cagers found that out the hard way this weekend as

they dropped a pair of tilts to the
Uclans, who have now all hut sewed
up the PCC Southern Division title.
The Cards were trounced in the first
game, 85-63, but put up a good fight
the following night, 72-59.
The main reason the Indians lost
is a .simple one: UCLA had a better
team. The Bruins arc taller, heav
ier, faster, and deeper.
OfT-hand, you'd think that's all if
club would need to win. But the
Cards offset Yhis superiority .some
what by being better .shooters arid
being a smarter and smoother floor
club.
This wasn't enough, however.
Generally, these are the reasons the
Uclans won the games and thus took
a commanding two-game lead in the
PCC race:
1. Rebound superiority. The Bru
ins dominated the backboards in
both games with their taller and
heavier men. Friday, the winners
got 62 rebounds to but 32 for Stan
ford. Saturday it was the same
story: 46 to 25.
The UCLA players are all big
boys. The Cards have but two tall
men, Russ Lawler and Barry Brown.

The unhappy reminder of last
fall on the Farm was present be
fore each of the Stanford-UCLA
basketball games at Westwood
over the weekend.
Just before the lipolT both nights
the scoreboard in Ihe Westwood
Men's Gym read UCLA 72, Stan
ford 0.
Need we say more?

Center Lawler, though he was thi
tallest man on the court at 6-6 J 2,
cleared a total of only 16 rebounds.
His opposing center, Willie Naulls,
got 33.
Friday night the Indians tried to
fool the Bruins by using a man-to
man defense, instead of the ex
pected zone. But Naulls kept play
ing far away from the basket, bring
ing Lawler out with him.
That left Brown to do the re
bounding for the whole Card team.
2. Illness. The Farm quintet
might well have moved from the
hotel to the L.A. County Hospital.
Brown's jumping was impaired by
a bad back. Bill Bond had severe
sinus trouble, and had to be re
moved twice at key times in tha
final game.
"In the second half Saturday, w
finally were able to take a one-poin)
lead," coach Howie Dallmar s- •id
"But Bond just couldn't go on. I
had to give him a rest and insert c;
substitute. That may have cost
the game."
3. Free throw shooting. Misses at
the charity line really hurt the In -
dians. The Cards in the first half
Friday missed the first shot of a
one-and-one situation seven times,
In the first game, Stanford hit 27
for 41 on free throws, while UCLA
was shooting 19 for 22. Saturda;,
the Cards hit 17 for 26 while th
Bruins were near-invincible with 2
for 29.
Sportsmanship. This is some
thing which players don't like
talk about, particularly after lo i)
two games by wide margins. Bt
the raucous Westwood crowd ro<
the visitors unmercifully.
The fans gave the two referee r ,•
terrible time, booing every foul <•;
on the Bruins regardless of how
