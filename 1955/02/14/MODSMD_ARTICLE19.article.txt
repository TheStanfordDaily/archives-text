The St n'ord Political Union is being mur
dered 7 student apathy.
At last Thursday's meeting, only GO students
turned out to hear Roger Kent discuss the Dem
ocratic party in California.
When the Political Union was founded in
October 1953, it was the result of hard work
by students who wanted what the Union of
fered:
"... a varied program of education on po
litical issues, and ... an opportunity (for stu
dents) to study, make their own decisions, and
ocpress their own opinions on these issues."
If these words are now merely empty rheto

ric, if the Stanford student prefers to stay in
his ivory tower and ignore events outside Palm
Drive, then the Political Union has outlived its
usefulness and should be dropped.
But if the Political Union is felt to be a neces
sary ingredient of Stanford life, if we, as stu
dents, are interested in politics and govern
ment and want to know more about them, then
we must be as willing to support the Political
Union as its founders were to work for it.
The choice is up to us.
Tonight the Political Union is presenting as
its speaker Stanley Barnes, Assistant Attorney
General of the United States.
Will he be speaking to an empty auditorium?
