W&ll, what's doing on the campus scene this
fair Valentine's Day? For the more intellec
tually minded the Biology Department is spon
soring Dr. Carl A. Beam lecturing on "Faotors
Affecting Radio - Sensitivity in Yeast." The
event will get under way at 4:15 p.m. in Room
430. Tea time at 4.

Also on today's agenda is a Concert Series
program which features famous violinist Isaac
Stern. There has been such a demand for tick
ets that seats have even been set up in the
orchestra pit in Mem Aud. Stern has been
hailed by critics the world over. Ironically,
although born in Russia he has never per
formed behind the Iron Curtain. The concert
begins at 8:15 tonight.

Although banned from the "flicks" and out
lawed at bachelor dinners, the Intermezzo Se
lies dares them all tomorrow as it presents the
French film "Life Begins Tomorrow," in Cub
berley at 3:15. This picture has received rave
notices: "C'est la vie'' . . . syndicated columnist
W. G. Wonka. "Oh, la la" . . . D'Artagnan. "An
exciting, provocative examination of today's
-jits and scientists in relation to the world of
tomorrow" . . . The Saturday Review.

The Folkdancers will hold their weekly fes
tive hoedown session Wednesday night in the
Women's Gym . . . hey, mambo . . .

All the excitement of a Broadway opening
will be attached to the premiere of Ram's
Head's One-Acts Thursday evening at 8:15 in
Mem Aud. Three plays will be offered in
cluding the comedy "A House in the Country"
and two dramas "The Sea Shell" and "Two
Squ«ir<. . The plays will run through Satur
day.

On the marquee for the film series Thursday
is "Underworld," with George Bancroft and
Evelyn Brent. What, who, huh . . .

"And somewhere men are laughing and
somewhere children shout, but there is no
joy in Mudville — mighty Casey has struck
out." Accompanying these memorable lines j
from Thayer's baseball poem comes the scent
of neat's-foot oil on leather and the crisp sound
of hickory meeting horsehide and the realiza
tion that Ev Dean's nine opens another season
Saturday. But what possible harm could the '
old alums do against the varsity when they !
meet in the opener? Beware . . .

Being an ardent peruser of such publications
as Playboy, Jack and Jill, The Weekly Reader,
etc., I'm looking forward to Wednesday when
the Chappie, that monarch of magazines, hits
the stands with another issue. The Old Boy
has been cooking up articles of interest for i
straight arrows and social hot dogs alike . . .
you betchum Red Ryder . . .

The Sunday night flicks will offer "Man on
a Tightrope," with Frederic March as the lov
able old circus owner who attempts to lead his
cohorts out from behind the Iron Curtain. Glo
ria Grahame plays his cheating wife ... oh
GG you've done it again girl . . .

SLEEPER OF THE WEEK - The Chemistry

nation of the week as it presents Dr. Clinton
Ballou lecturing today at 4:15 p.m. in Room 20

bohydrate Metabolism."
Tell me about it. I will. And he did, and

Although banned from the "flicks" and out
lawed at bachelor dinners, the Intermezzo Se
lies dares them all tomorrow as it presents the
French film "Life Begins Tomorrow," in Cub
berley at 3:15. This picture has received rave
notices: "C'est la vie'' . . . syndicated columnist
W. G. Wonka. "Oh, la la" . . . D'Artagnan. "An
exciting, provocative examination of today's
-jits and scientists in relation to the world of
tomorrow" . . . The Saturday Review.

The Folkdancers will hold their weekly fes
tive hoedown session Wednesday night in the
Women's Gym . . . hey, mambo . . .

All the excitement of a Broadway opening
will be attached to the premiere of Ram's
Head's One-Acts Thursday evening at 8:15 in
Mem Aud. Three plays will be offered in
cluding the comedy "A House in the Country"
and two dramas "The Sea Shell" and "Two
Squ«ir<. . The plays will run through Satur
day.

On the marquee for the film series Thursday
is "Underworld," with George Bancroft and
Evelyn Brent. What, who, huh . . .

"And somewhere men are laughing and
somewhere children shout, but there is no
joy in Mudville — mighty Casey has struck
out." Accompanying these memorable lines j
from Thayer's baseball poem comes the scent
of neat's-foot oil on leather and the crisp sound
of hickory meeting horsehide and the realiza
tion that Ev Dean's nine opens another season
Saturday. But what possible harm could the '
old alums do against the varsity when they !
meet in the opener? Beware . . .

Being an ardent peruser of such publications
as Playboy, Jack and Jill, The Weekly Reader,
etc., I'm looking forward to Wednesday when
the Chappie, that monarch of magazines, hits
the stands with another issue. The Old Boy
has been cooking up articles of interest for i
straight arrows and social hot dogs alike . . .
you betchum Red Ryder . . .

The Sunday night flicks will offer "Man on
a Tightrope," with Frederic March as the lov
able old circus owner who attempts to lead his
cohorts out from behind the Iron Curtain. Glo
ria Grahame plays his cheating wife ... oh
GG you've done it again girl . . .
