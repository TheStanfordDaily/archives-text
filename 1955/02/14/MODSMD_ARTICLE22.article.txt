# After 16 Years . . . One-Acts a Tradition
## 
### PHYLLIS FERGUSON 
Next Thursday night Rams' Head will carry on the 16th year of
tradition when they present the Annual Winter One-Acts of 1955.
The One-Acts have now become such a part of Stanford tradi
tion that they are taken for granted as an annual occurrence. But
16 years ago, the production was a subject of great controversy.

and a new experiment.
Nineteen thirty-nine was a big
year for Flam's Head. During that
year they changed the name from
Stagei's to Ram's Head. And it was
then that Ram's Head inaugurated
the original student-written Winter
One-Acts.
IDEA BORN IN 1 fJ.'iH
The idea evolved in 1938 when the
group produced the winning entries
from the California One-Act contest.
Why not hold their own one-act
contest for Stanford students and
produce the three winning entries,
Ram's Head directors pondered.
And so they did. The first contest
was anxiously watched by all of the
students. Thirty - two manuscripts
were submitted and the three win
ners automatically became Ram's
Head members. The performance
met great approval from both the
students and the administration.
NATIONAL MOVEMENT
A 1939 Ram's Head member called
the new production "part of a na
tional movement to encourage com
plete collegiate production of one
act plays of high dramatic merit."
The movement was soon followed
by Pomona and later by many other
colleges.
Since that year, the One - Acts
have continued to be a stimulus to
dramatic writing and a credit to the
Drama Department and to the
school. They afford an excellent op
portunity for the budding play
wright to see his plays produced.
JUDGED BEST ONE-ACT
Last year James W. Arnold won
the Samuel French Playwriting Con
test for "The Sheriff," one of the
Winter One - Acts. The play was
pronounced by contest judges the
best original one-act play in the
United States.
For this achievement, Dr. Norman
Philbrick of the Speech and Drama
Department was presented with a
plaque for "excellence in playwrit
ing instruction." Arnold received
$100 and publication. Plays will be
entered in the contest again this
year.
THIS YEAR'S ONE-ACTS
Fourteen manuscripts were en
tered in the Winter One-Act con
test this year. The winning plays
are: "A House in the Country," a
comedy by Barbara Spence; "The
Sea Shell," a symbolic drama by
Dick Learman; and "Two Squared,"
a drama by S. Bruce Lowry.
The plays are traditionally select
ed for their excellence of plot, dra
matic structure, characterization,
and theme. This year one of the
plays selected was written by an
undergraduate, Dick Learman.'
The performances, which will run
next Thursday, Friday, and Satur
day nights at 8:15 in the Little The
ater, have been preceded by .six
weeks of rehearsal.
