# Philippines Get Curriculum Aid
## 
### 
The Philippine Curriculum Proj
ect, established under a contract be
tween the Foreign Operations Ad
ministration and Stanford Univer
sity, has been recently completed,
Herbert B. Wilson, supervisor of the
project, announced recently.
The purpose of the project was to
assemble and transport to the Phil
ippines 11 collections of elementary
and secondary courses of study, cur
riculum guides, units of work, and
the like.
The Bureau of Public Schools of
the Department of Education, the
College of Education of the Univer
sity of the Philippines Normal Col
lege, and eight normal schools on
the islands received the material
gathered by the project.
Wilson, Dr. Paul Hanna, E. M.
Grieder, and several faculty mem
bers of the School of Education
worked on the project, which began
in March, 1954. Ninety thousand in
dividual publications, or about 14
tons of material, were crated and
shipped to Manila and outlying
schools in the Philippines.
Reports from the Philippines indi
cate that the curriculum libraries
will probably be of great value in
teacher training.
