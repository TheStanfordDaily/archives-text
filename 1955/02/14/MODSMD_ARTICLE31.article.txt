WESTWOOD MEN'S GYM, Feb.
11 — Stanfor I's basketballers were
never in the game in the open»r of
their crucial series with UCLA to
night. The Bruins never trailed as
they clawed the Indians 85 to 63.
Ron Tonvsic, Mr. Accuracy himself
last week when he scored (57 points
in two games against USC, never
could get untraeked tonight even
though he led the Stanford scorers
with 15 points.
The Bruins started quickly this
evening and before Stanford could
mesh a basket, UCLA was leading
12 to 1. The Cards then made their
one bid of the night when, paced by
Russ Lawler, they cut the Bruin
lead to 18 to 14 at the eight-minute
mark of the first half. However,
UCLA bounced back to take a 36 to
23 advantage with four minutes to
go in the half and at the intermis
sion it was 40-31 for the Bruins.
UCLA wrapped up the game early
in the second half when, with Taft
and John Moore handling most of i
the scoring burden, it was soon 59 to
35 with 14 minutes left in the game.
The Bruins enjoyed their biggest
lead a lew moments later when it
was 63 to 38, and then 67 to 42.
Stanford shaved the margin a little,
mainly through the work of Tomsic
and reserve Leo Schwaiger, the lat
ter sinking two fielders and nine
charity shots all in the second half.
Taft topped the evening's scorers
with 24 points, while Moore had 21.
Tomsic, as mentioned earlier, topped
the Cards with 15, while George I
Selleck and Schwaiger added 14 and
13 respectively to the Indian cause.
Oddly enough UCLA committed ;
27 personal fouls to only 13 for
Stanford during the game and all
the Bruin regulars had at least four
personals on them, but Indian in
effectiveness from the foul stripe
nullified this potential advantage.
