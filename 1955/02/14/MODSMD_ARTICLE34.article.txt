# Card Ruggers Beat Uclans Over Weekend for Third Win
## 
### MIKE McGINNIS 
Stanford's ruggers swept past the UCLA varsity 14-3 last Fri
day on the Card home field. The win was the third straight for
the unbeaten team.
The Indians scored first, after 7 minutes of the first half, when
Gordy Young scored a try on a lateral from Dorsey Atkinson. The

play originated from a scrum on the'*'
UCLA 20-yard line.
The Bruins bounced back for their
three lone points when Jerry Gardner
ran over for a try. The conversion
was missed.
With five minutes left in the half,
Stanford again drove into UCLA ter
ritory. Jack Taylor ran the ball to
the Bruin ten, and the Cards scored
in a halftime overtime on a penalty
kick as Atkinson booted it through
the uprights. The 25-yard kick made

it 8 points for the Cards.
In the opening minutes of the sec
ond period the play traveled up and
down the field with no advantage to
either team. A penalty kick against
Stanford carried the ball deep into
Card territory, and a scrum formed
on the 20-yard line.
Stanford's Ron Cook got the ball
from the scrum and broke into the
open lor a 70-yard sprint along the
right sideline. The attacking Bruins
were completely faked out.
Cook outran three UCLA backfield
men and faked Bruin fullback George
Martin beautifully on a lateral to
Dorsey Atkinson. Atkinson galloped
over for the try. The conversion was
missed.
The Bruins fought to get back in
the game but Stanford's versatile
kicking kept UCLA frustrated. A
run by Lewis from the Card 30
threatened to outshine Cook's dash,
but an attempted lateral to Paul
Camera was missed on the Bruin 30-
yard stripe.
The Cards kept the pressure on,
however, and finally scored when the
scrum kicked the ball into the Uclan's
end zone from the 25. Glen Stanton
fell on the oval for the Indians for
three points. The conversion was
missed.
Stanford's coach, Pete Kmetovic,
called the contest "a very good rugby
game for both sides." He compli
mented the Card forwards, who. he
said, "did a very good job." The fine
playing of Ron Cook and Jack Lewis
was hard to miss in the backfield.
Noel Robinson and Gordy Young
looked good also.
