## 
### BOB MIEROW 
Smooth working Fred LcCour
proved to be too much for the Stan
ford Frosh in the Pavilion Friday
night as the St. Ignatius High School
Wildcats trimmed the Papooses 47-45.
LaCour. tallying mostly on jump
shots and drives, chalked up 28 points
to pace the victors.
Si's win marked the first time in
H years that a high .school team had
toppled the Frosh. Lowell turned the
trick, 55-51, in the 1948-59 season,
being paced by Kenny Flower, Don
1 Carlson, and Fritz Fevister.
The Wildcats' intricate offense of
! double screens constantly earned
j good shots for LcCour and his team
mates. Only Si's inaccuracy from the
floor kept them from lengthening
their margin of victory.
Stanford jumped into an early lead
which they maintained through most
of the first half. Behind a free throw
and tip by Eric Anderson, the Frosh
gained a (i point advantage at 13-7,
the biggest difference between the
two clubs all night.
After an exchange of baskets, La-
Cour personally brought the Wildcats
to within one marker of the Papooses.
Stanford led 17-10 at the quarter, with
LaCour contributing 11 of Si's points.
The second ten minutes saw very
little scoring, with the Papooses leav
ing the floor at the intermission with
a 23-21 advantage.
St. Ignatius moved ahead early in
the third quarter using double screens
to gain easy set shots. With only ten
minutes remaining, the Wildcats held
a narrow 36-34 margin.
Stanford tied the score twice in the
: final quarter but couldn't move ahead
jof the visitors. LaCour snapped a
; 41-41 tie with five minutes left, hit
ting on a short jump shot. SI began
a stall at this point, and the Papooses
were never able to overtake the Wild
cats.
Dean Thomas headed the Stanford
scoring column, tallying 8 points.
Trailing the little guard from Holly
wood were Clint Waring with 7 and
Gary VanGalder, Mike Gray, and Lee
Leonard with 0 each.
