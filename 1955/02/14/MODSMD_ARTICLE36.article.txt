Stanford's tennis team was blasted
I G-3 by the California Tennis Club at
Berkeley Saturday in the opening

I out a very satisfying straight set vic-
I tory over Jerry Moss, .U.S. and Aus

j Davis Cup team, is a part of Jack
| Kramer's junior development pro
! gram and, wish Mike Green and

to his advantage and exhibited the
\ poise and smooth form he has ac
| quired in the past year.
