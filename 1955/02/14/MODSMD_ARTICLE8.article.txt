One-Acts to be presented this weekend will be "The House in the
Country," a charming comedy farce set in New England.
The play revolves around three college students who suddenly
find that someone has bought the old deserted house in the country

where they have been living. The
fun begins when they try to keep the
people from moving in.
The play has many delightful comic
sequences which lend themselves
well to production. >

into the business in order to keep up
the pace.
