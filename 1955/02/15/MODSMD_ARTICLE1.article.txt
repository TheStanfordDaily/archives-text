# 'NOT UNUSUAL'
## New French Crisis Analyzed by Buck 
### JIM PALMER 
The current French government crisis is "a perennial liability
ol French politics and not at all an unusual or uncharacteristic
situation," declared Philip W. Buck, professor of political science,
in an interview with The Daily yesterday.
"However," he pointed out, "It is not a terrifically insoluable

crisis. It is probable that leadership
must be found among the same mid
dle political groups that have pro
vided previous leadership."
These arc the center and the
slightly-right-of-center parties, he
said.
Buck recalled that the present
French political set-up dates to 1951
when the French Assembly was di
vided into six parties and termed
"the hexagonal assembly."
"In crises since then, it has been
extremely difficult to find leadership
that can assemble a majority out of
the six groups," he stated.
The Fourth Republic is following
an established pattern like the Third
Republic, Buck asserted. "It is a
fluid situation and a chronic situ
ation."
"There is not any way to make a
prediction on who the successor may
be. It is not impossible that they
may come back to Mendes-France."
Buck explained that the French
president in searching for a new
ministry may get a temporary cabi
net until a more stable leadership
can be found, and"the existing min
istry then stays in office on a care
taker basis until a replacement is
found,"
How soon to expect the crisis to be
resolved? Buck said that it is any
body's guess, maybe by the middle
of this week or next week.
"It is unusual for it to take much
longer, although there was a recent
episode when an interval of two
weeks occurred between cabinets."
