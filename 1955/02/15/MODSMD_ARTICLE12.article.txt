# One-Acts to Feature 'Mississippi Drama'
## 
### PHYLLIS FERGUSON 
Winding up the Ram's Head Winter One-Acts this Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday night will be "Two, Squared," a realistic
drama of far-reaching significance.
The play, set in Sardis, Mississippi, does not como within the
precise realm of either comedy or tragedy. It is rather an experi-

mental drama, containing moments
of absorbing depth and moments of
intense excitement which reflect the
work of a professional playwright.
The effectiveness of the play de
pends very heavily on characteriza
tion. Extraordinary demands are j
also being made of the technical
crew who have worked matty long
hours to perfect the technical parts
of the play.
The author is S. Bruce Lowry, a
graduate in speech and drama from
Northwestern. Having spent a couple
of years in the army, he is nojw-doing ;
his first year of graduate work at
Stanford.
Although liiis is Bruce's fourth
play, it is the first to be produced.
"It, is a terribly difficult play to di
rect." said Lowry. "The play depends
upon ensemble acting, it is meaning
less without it."
Joel Rogosin is the director. He has
appeared in many Stanford produc
tions arid was assistant director of
"The Climate of Eden."
"The production depends on co
operation between director, actor,
playwright, designer, and technical j
crew," said Rogosin. "Without a per
formance and an audience a play
doesn't exist."
Bere Boynton, Walt Brown,
Charles Lloyd, Bay Steinhardt and
Lee Simms make up the cast.
Miss Boynton played a leading
role in this year's "Gaieties" and
Brown appeared in "The Skin of Our I
Teeth." Lee Simms is a little boy j
imported especially for this play. He j
has been in several Palo Alto Com
munity Theatre productions.
Betsy Thayer, an art major, de- j
signed the set.
