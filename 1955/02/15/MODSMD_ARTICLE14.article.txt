# The
						Score's The Thing— Or Is It?

### STEW TOY 
"My accompanist and I have
traveled a lot," said violinist
Isaac Stern before his sched
uled playing of Mozart's Con
certo in A Major, No. 5, last night
in Memorial Auditorium.
"And when you travel a lot you
; make mistakes."
This was his explanation for for
! getting to put the music for the con
certo into his suitcase before lie
came to Stanford.
"But instead," he went, on, "we
.shall play another Mozart concerto.
It is another number—No. 3—and in
another key—G major—and we are
obviously paying you the compli
ment of thinking you will know the
difference."
When the capacity audience,
jammed from the last row in the
balcony to the special seats in the
orchestra pit, had recovered and
settled down to hear the substituted
number, it was as relaxed as only
an Isaac Stern audience can be.
CONCERT GOAL
Stern's famous concert goal is to
bring music down from the realm of
stuffiness to the level of the common
man.
As he has said, "I want to show
people that music is not a luxury
but is as natural as reading or arith
metic."
Stern's other renditions included
"La Folia,'" by Corelli, a set of vari
ations on an ancient Portuguese
dance, Alberto Ginastera's "'Rhap
sody (Pampeana No. 1)," Szyma
nowski's weird, impressionistic "La
Fontaine d'Arethuse," and Paga
nini's famed "La Campanella."
He also played Cesar Franck's
Sonata in A Major—a popular num
ber with the audience.
I THE FAVORITE
As might, b'e expected after the
unusual build-up, the Mozart con
certo was the audience's-favorite.
Stern described the concerto, writ
ten by Mozart at the age of 10, as
"just as charming as the originally
scheduled one."
Outstanding among the three en
cores which the audience demanded
of the young virtuoso were four Ru
manian dances by Bela Bartok.
Stern's playing of the third dance
sounded like the strange wailing of
a human voice—a remarkable and
| disquieting effect.
ANOTHER ENCORE
Another encore selection, which
displayed Stern's amazing technique,
was the Heifetz version of "Hora
Staccata."
Stern, the only major violinist
whose training is exclusively Amer
ican (he received his training from
the concert master of the San Fran
cisco Symphony), played the con
cert. on his priceless 250-year-old
Guarnerius violin.
