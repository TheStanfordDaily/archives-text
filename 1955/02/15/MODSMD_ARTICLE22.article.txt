## Barnes Surveys Ike, Anti-Trust 
### DAVE SCOTT 
The Eisenhower administration's attitude toward anti-trust laws
and their enforcement was reviewed last night by Assistant At
torney General Stanley N. Barnes in his speech under the aus
pices of the Political Union.
Barnes stressed three policies of the Justice Department toward

enforcement of anti-trust law.
The first one, and the one on
which he laid special emphasis, was
"equality of enforcement." "Bigness
in the sense of bigness itself is ir
relevant," Barnes stated. "What
counts is the control the company
exercises in relation to its particu
lar industry."
As an example he cited the mer
ger of Packard and Studebakei.
"Their combined assets totaled 300
million, certainly not little business.
But in comparison to the position
control of the automobile industry
held by General Motors, this was
nothing."
By contrast, Barnes then told of a
cement block industry which was
not listed as one of the first 200 lead
ing corporations, but had all the
patents, and therefore almost com
plete control of the manufacture ol
cement blocks, thus necessitating
anti-trust enforcement.
Barnes also cited the recent deci -
sion against Eastman Kodak Com
pany. "There was no question tha!
Eastman did a good job of process
ing color film," Barnes remarked,
"but there was no chance to find ou'.
if another company could do as well.
Kodak controlled over 90 per cen
of the processing business.
"Most of this monopoly was ac
complished by including in the cost
of the film the price of developing.
This was clearly a violation of the
anti-trust laws against tie-in con
tracts."
Barnes declared that by virtue of
a consent decree instigated by the
Justice Department. Kodak has to
sell the film at what the film itself
cost and must charge separately for
the processing.
The second policy has been sim -
plification of administration, Barne.i
said. "When the Eisenhower ad
ministration took over, we discov
ered one case which had taken two
years and 106,590 pages of testimony.
Last year we closed 88 cases, the
second greatest number since the
passage of the Sherman Anti-Trust
Law in 1890.
"Lastly we have endeavored to as
sist the businessman acting in good
faith with the anti-trust laws and
who is confused by the laws, has
had bad legal advice, or has bee i
operating just on the border line of
the law."

The Eisenhower administration's attitude toward anti-trust laws
and their enforcement was reviewed last night by Assistant At
torney General Stanley N. Barnes in his speech under the aus
pices of the Political Union.
Barnes stressed three policies of the Justice Department toward

enforcement of anti-trust law.
The first one, and the one on
which he laid special emphasis, was
"equality of enforcement." "Bigness
in the sense of bigness itself is ir
relevant," Barnes stated. "What
counts is the control the company
exercises in relation to its particu
lar industry."
As an example he cited the mer
ger of Packard and Studebakei.
"Their combined assets totaled 300
million, certainly not little business.
But in comparison to the position
control of the automobile industry
held by General Motors, this was
nothing."
By contrast, Barnes then told of a
cement block industry which was
not listed as one of the first 200 lead
ing corporations, but had all the
patents, and therefore almost com
plete control of the manufacture ol
cement blocks, thus necessitating
anti-trust enforcement.
Barnes also cited the recent deci -
sion against Eastman Kodak Com
pany. "There was no question tha!
Eastman did a good job of process
ing color film," Barnes remarked,
"but there was no chance to find ou'.
if another company could do as well.
Kodak controlled over 90 per cen
of the processing business.
"Most of this monopoly was ac
complished by including in the cost
of the film the price of developing.
This was clearly a violation of the
anti-trust laws against tie-in con
tracts."
Barnes declared that by virtue of
a consent decree instigated by the
Justice Department. Kodak has to
sell the film at what the film itself
cost and must charge separately for
the processing.
The second policy has been sim -
plification of administration, Barne.i
said. "When the Eisenhower ad
