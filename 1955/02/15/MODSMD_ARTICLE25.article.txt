To the student body:
The Stanford Quad's policy of
upping the yearbook's price to
$7.50 after Jan. 31 (over the pre
vious $0.50) wns not intended as
a penalty to the students but
rather for the sake of good busi
ness.
Stanford could have a better
yearbook and the cost of the
book could be lower but only if
sales go up.
Quad sales over the past four
years have averaged between
3,100 and 3,260 books. The Quad
buslines.- - taff feels thnt the fault
for sales having Lcrn so low lies
in llie old sales 1 system. Some
thing had to be done. A sales
.sv-lem of greater convenience
and wider coverage of the stu
dent body had to be designed.
The new sales system is, we
hope, the answer; but right now
it is jus' experiment. Start
ing a ... • tradition is difficult.
What the Quad business staff is
fighting against is the apathy of
students.
The one place where the whole
student body can be reached is at
registration. And so each student
received a Quad order card as he
entered Memorial Auditorium at

fall quarter registration.
At the start of winter quarter
every student who had indicated
on his order card that he wanted
a book received a bill in the mail
and a prepaid return envelope.
There was a month to pay.
The Quad business staff did
everything it possibly could to
make it easier for the student.
Few students realize how hard
both the editorial and business
staffs are trying to make Stan
ford's yearbook as good as pos
sible. We've contracted for the
the best printing and engraving
firms that money can buy.
The yearbook is composed en
tirely by students; every picture
and every piece of copy comes
from student effort. A staff ol
about 25 students, some working
four to five hours a day, every
day, put Stanford's yearbook to
gether. The '55 Quad will be one
o! Stanford's best.
It takes $40,000 to produce one
issue of the Quad. The Quad is
completely independent of the
University.
Twenty-two thousand dollars
must come from sales. This is
where the yearbook has to rely
on the students. This year, to
offset the reduction in price and

the added cost of putting more
color in the book. 3,300 books
must be sold. So far 2,500 have
been sold through the new sales
system.
What the business* stuff has to
fight is apathy on the part of the
students. To make the book pos
sible we need student support, to
give in return the yearbook
Stanford should have.
In order to sell the necessary
800 more books the Quad busi
ness staff is extending the dead
line for payment of this year's
book to Feb. 28. The new sales
system and even this extension
is a realistic approach to a real
problem. It is for the sake of
good business and for conven
ience to the student.
11 for any reason you didn't get
a Quad order card, or lost yours
or haven't paid for your book yet,
do so now. Quad order cards and
bills can 1)0 obtained at the Quad
office from 4 to 0 p.m. Monday
through Friday or- at the ASSU
office.
The Quad business staff hopes
you see this to your advantage.

To the student body:
The Stanford Quad's policy of
upping the yearbook's price to
$7.50 after Jan. 31 (over the pre
vious $0.50) wns not intended as
a penalty to the students but
rather for the sake of good busi
ness.
Stanford could have a better
yearbook and the cost of the
book could be lower but only if
sales go up.
Quad sales over the past four
years have averaged between
3,100 and 3,260 books. The Quad
buslines.- - taff feels thnt the fault
for sales having Lcrn so low lies
in llie old sales 1 system. Some
thing had to be done. A sales
.sv-lem of greater convenience
and wider coverage of the stu
dent body had to be designed.
The new sales system is, we
hope, the answer; but right now
it is jus' experiment. Start
ing a ... • tradition is difficult.
What the Quad business staff is
fighting against is the apathy of
students.
The one place where the whole
student body can be reached is at
registration. And so each student
received a Quad order card as he
entered Memorial Auditorium at

fall quarter registration.
At the start of winter quarter
every student who had indicated
on his order card that he wanted
a book received a bill in the mail
and a prepaid return envelope.
There was a month to pay.
The Quad business staff did
everything it possibly could to
make it easier for the student.
Few students realize how hard
both the editorial and business
staffs are trying to make Stan
ford's yearbook as good as pos
sible. We've contracted for the
the best printing and engraving
firms that money can buy.
The yearbook is composed en
tirely by students; every picture
and every piece of copy comes
from student effort. A staff ol
about 25 students, some working
four to five hours a day, every
day, put Stanford's yearbook to
gether. The '55 Quad will be one
o! Stanford's best.
It takes $40,000 to produce one
issue of the Quad. The Quad is
completely independent of the
University.
Twenty-two thousand dollars
must come from sales. This is
where the yearbook has to rely
on the students. This year, to
offset the reduction in price and

the added cost of putting more
color in the book. 3,300 books
must be sold. So far 2,500 have
been sold through the new sales
system.
What the business* stuff has to
fight is apathy on the part of the
students. To make the book pos
sible we need student support, to
give in return the yearbook
Stanford should have.
In order to sell the necessary
800 more books the Quad busi
ness staff is extending the dead
line for payment of this year's
book to Feb. 28. The new sales
system and even this extension
is a realistic approach to a real
problem. It is for the sake of
good business and for conven
ience to the student.
