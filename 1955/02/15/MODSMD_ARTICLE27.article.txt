The Daily can consider for publication in its
'Campus Opinion' column only those letters to the
editor which have heen signed. Signatures will,
only a remnant?
To the Editor:
The latest revision of the Honor Code, leaving only
a vestigal remnant of that once-proud doctrine, is the
most efficacious means yet devised to utterly subvert
the spirit of the code.
The fact that* students will i-emain unsupervised in
the classrooms is irrelevant; an Honor Code, to be
worthy of its name, must be universally applicable.
The new revision penalizes those students who can
realize their best results on a typewriter, and penalizes
the entire student body by implying thai, the great
majority of its members are not to be trusted unless
supervised by their fellow students.
The Honor Code has been abrogatedâ€”k remains in
effect only nominally.
AL MARER

however, he withheld by request.
Opinions and views expressed in letters to the
editor are not necessarily those of The Daily.
|-hank you
To the Editor:
It is too early to tell exactly how much was raised
in the ASSU Winter Drive, but the co-operation and
effort which the many organizations displayed was the
primary factor in its smooth operation and success.
I wish there were time to personally contact and
thank each individual who worked on or contributed
to the drive, but, unfortunately, this is not possible.
The only "reward" I can offer you is the knowledge
that you have done a little to help those less fortunate
than ourselves.
From the Winter Quarter Drive Committee, Free
University of Berlin, World University Service, and
the Red Cross I wish to extend our sincere thanks.
FRED RUHLAND
ASSU Winter Quarter Drive Chairman
