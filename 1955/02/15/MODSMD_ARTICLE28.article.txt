Want to v/in yourself 500 clams? (Of the
spendable, not the edible variety).
This chance is offered you because I am for
more loot in the hands of Daily readers, many of
whom, agents inform me, put my art to good
use in lining garbage cans and the like. These
true-blue friends of journalism deserve a break.
You can buy a lot of them new-fangled plastic
garbage disposal bags with 500 worth of let
tuce.
Don't these clever synonyms for money
kill you. Must be where the expression "mon
ey-hungry" comes from.
But, down to business . ..
One of our advertisers, makers of King Ed
ward Cigarillo stogies, is offering half a grand
for the best essay on, "How I Would Increase
the Popularity of Cigarillos." This is your big
opportunity, it's open only to "bonifide stu
dents of accredited colleges." That's you, my
friends.
Look to the cigarette industry to find the per
fect essay. What caused the tremendous pop
ularity of smokes? Women. That's right, when
the advertisers started hitting it from the ladies
angle, boom, up went cigarette sales.

And why not the same with cigarillos?
Many great points can be covered in such an
essay. Take democracy. That's always a sure
winner. The politicos claim women are equal
with men, but do the ladies smoke seegars?
They do not. How about a slogan—"Women:
be the equal of the men folks, smoke cigarillos."
Democracy in action.
Or try the fashion approach, that's always
popular with the girls. They wear man-tailored
shirts, man-tailored skirts, khaki shorts, cuff
links, even ties. Style conscious dolls could
really complete their wardrobes with man
tailored cigarillos.
There you have the means to a small fortune,
but there is a catch. You really didn't think
I'd give out with such valuable info without a
gimmick, did you?
With your essay you must send in a band
from a cigar. When you remove that band
don't smoke that stogie, friend. My goil's crazy
'bout them, and . . . well, ... I sorta promised.
Some guys bring their dates boxes of candy,
not me. Cigarillos.
I'd appreciate your contributions. After all,
you will get the $500.
I think.
