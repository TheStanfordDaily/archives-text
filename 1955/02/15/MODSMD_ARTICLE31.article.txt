"So you want to know more
about the professors," Mr. Mil
ler mused. "You know, you
should ask the students what
they think of the professors,
rather than asking the profes
sors themselves. You're likely
to get a slightly biased view
point this way."
Known correctly as the Rev. Al
exander Miller, the Stanford lec
turer in religion is generally called
Mr. Miller. He has been teaching
courses in the Old and New Testa
ments, comparative religion, and
other similar courses at Stanford for
six years.
Miller has written several books,
one of which, "The Christian Sig
nificance of Karl Marx," was trans
lated into Dutch, German, and Dan
ish. His latest literary effort. "The
Renewal of Man," was published in
January of this year. It is the first
in a series of books by prominent
contemporary religious leaders.
Reinhold Niebuhr, who will be writ
ing his own book for the series, has
written the introduction to Miller's
book.
Miller's classes are conducted in
an informal manner and he often
shows his sense of humor, some
times at his own expense. Besides
his classroom contributions to Stan
ford. Miller has also brought many
fine speakers here. He originally es
tablished the Thursday Lunch Club,
which meets each week to hear
speakers and hold discussions on
pertinent religious and literary top
ics.
His wife Jean, a native of New
Zealand, is active in the YMCA and
YWCA activities here on campus.
Their eight-year-old son, Davey, at
tends elementary school here. On a
recent school holiday Davey joined
one of his father's classes. He had

been instructed to sit quietly and
listen to the lecture, which he did.
At the end of the hour, much to his
father's amazement, Davey raised
his hand, timidly asked a question,

and participated in the class dis
cussion.
During his spare time, which is
practically non-existent. Miller en
joys good movies, especially British
films (he's an Alec Guinness ad
mirer). In their home the Millers
have few rules or regulations. How
ever, anyone who does not know
how to brew tea in the proper Brit
ish manner must beware. A tea-bag
is an unknown substance in the
Miller home!
