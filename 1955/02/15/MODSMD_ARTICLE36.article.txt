## Rugby Not 'Complicated' If Rules Are Understood 
### MIKE McGINNIS 
Rugby is the same as any oth
er sport. When you don't un
derstand it, it's complicated;
when you do, it's simple.
The object of the game is the same
as in football, to get the ball over
the opponents' goal and ground it,

and add extra points. The defense
tries to disintegrate the man with
the ball and block extra points.
The game is played with an oval
about the size of a football, and each
team has 15 men. The field is 110
yards long and 75 yards wide.
LITTLE LIKE FOOTBALL
The game is a little like football,
except that:
1. There is no blocking; the ball
carrier must break into the open
| himself.
2. There is no Forward passing,
I only laterals.
| 3. The ball may be dribbled with
■ the feet along the ground.
4. All players must be behind the
| ball at all times, or they are *'ofT
j side."
5. In rugby, penalty kicks are giv
! en for infringement of the rules.
■ There are no yardage penalties.
6. After a stoppage, each team has
i an equal chance to get the ball. The
! forwards (eight of 'em on each side)

come together, lock arms with
teammates, and try to push the en
emy off the ball. This "scrum" is
also used for any minor infringe
ment of the rules, and takes place
at the spot where it happened.
OFFSIDE PENALTIES
Most of the penalties are for off
[ sides. Both teams must stay on their
side of the ball at all times. When
one team is on the attack, that whole
team must stay behind the man with
the ball.
Of course sometimes this is im
i possible. For instance, when the
; ball is kicked behind the attacking
! team, the attacking team must not
; stay out in front. They must turn
around, run back, and try to get j
behind the ball again. The opposing !
team can charge down to where the I
ball has been kicked, but cannot
pass it. Catch on?
The ball can only be carried when
! it is picked up from the scrum,
1 when it is caught in the "line-out,"
! or when an enemy kick is caught.
: As soon as it hits the ground it must
I be played with the foot, however.
THE POINT SYSTEM
Here's how they score. A penalty
j kick equals three points. A try
(same as a touchdown in football)
equals three points, but the scoring
team can try to kick extra points
(2) so there is a possibility of five.
Three points are allowed for a drop
kick, and for a place kick (which
I takes place after* a fair catch is
j cailed).
You can never play the man in
1 rugby, always the ball; pushing,
| stomping, etc., is illegal.
Let's face it—you still don't un
derstand rugby. However, if you
| just happened to see a game this
j season you might become oriented
j enough to yell, "Hey, man, that's a
knock -on off the second five
eighths."


BLOCK THAT BALL!—Hardeman Cureton of UCLA kicks the bail toward unbeaten Stanford's
goal in the rugby contest played on the Card field last Friday. Dorsey Atkinson (11) is about to
block it. Jack Lewis (10) waits in the backfield while Sam Thornton (17), Tony Mosich, Ted
Polich, and Donn Carswell (partially hidden) rush in. —Daily photo by Keith Frazer
