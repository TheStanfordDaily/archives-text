# Card JV's Beat Jaguar Team Easily
## 
### MORT BROWN 
Playing one of their outstanding
games of the season, the Stanford
Braves trampled the San Jo.se Junior
College Jaguars 87-49 at the Pavilion
last night. The game was marked by
sterling all-around play of the Braves
us a whole. Their defensive work
was outstanding and they sank 54
percent of their tries at the basket.
Ben Heirs opened for the Braves
with a drive right through the Jaguar
defense, scoring the first bucket.
From there on it wasn't close.
"Beppo" Dyer, Dave Dunn, and Heirs
were the high scorers with 12, Jl,
and 11 points respectively. The
Braves couldn't seem to miss, mak
ing fourteen out of their first fifteen
shots. They continued to run up the
score even after Coach George Lynn
substituted an entirely new team.
The second team kept right up with
the first to build up the margin to
45-19 at half time.
Early in the second half it seemed
as if the Jaguars, led by Hank Nose,
were going to get back into the game.
However, this surge of power spent
itself before it really started, be
cause of the great defensive play of
the Braves. Offensively they kept
right on adding to the already de
cisive margin to finish up the game
in complete charge.
Coach Lynn made the comment
after the game that the Braves had
just played one of their best games
of the season. He also stated that
the Jaguars were not as bad as they
looked tonight because of the Braves
superior play.
For the Jaguars the high scorers
were Nose and Dunlay with 10 and
12 points respectively.
