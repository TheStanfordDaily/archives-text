### 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 14 (UP) â€”
UCLA's Johnny Moore was named
athlete of the month for January by
the Helm's Athletic Board today.
Moore, described by Bruin coach
John Wooden as "a player with
more moves than a chess player,"
was saluted particularly for his
work against Southern California
when he subbed at center for Willie
Naulls in the second game between
the cro ;;town foes.
