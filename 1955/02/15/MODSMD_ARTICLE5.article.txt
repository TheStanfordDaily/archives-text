# AEC Schedules Bomb Test Today
## 
### 
LAS VEGAS, Nev.—Willi a fore
cast of "safe" weather, AEC officials
gave the go-ahead tonight for an
A-bomb blast, apparently a "big
one" that will open the 1955 winter
spring nuclear test series tomorrow
morning.
For the first time in five years of
testing America's arsenal of atomic
weapons at the Nevada proving
grounds, Highway 95, passing within
40 miles of the test site, was blocked
off by police "to keep drivers from
being blinded and going off the
road."
This led to speculation that the
device was a large one, perhaps as
powerful as 50,000 tons of TNT, or
maybe as large as the biggest one
ever touched off here—a 65,000-ton
ner two years ago whose flash was
seen in Montana, 1,000 miles away.
