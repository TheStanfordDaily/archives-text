### 
UNITED NATIONS, NY â€” The
United Nations Security Council re-
J fused today to debate a Soviet
I charge of United States "aggression"
j in Formosa and adjourned without
j action in its efforts to achieve a
cease-fire in the China crisis.
Fjiccd with the Chinese Commu
nists' outspoken rejection of its in
vitation to participate in a discus
sion of a ccase-fire in the island
I fighting off the China coast, the 11-
nation Council stepped aside to let
other diplomats deal with the prob-
I lem outside the U.N.
Willi the adjournment of the Se
curity Council, the world's hopes for
! a solution that will prevent the For
mosan crisis from erupting into war
turned on India's Prime Minister
Jawaharlal Nehru and British For
eign Secretary Anthony Eden, the
leaders of the diplomatic drive for a
j settlement.
Nationalist China's Dr. Tingfu F.
j Tsiang urged the Council before it
adjourned to "muster enough cour
age to face the basic and monstrous
fact of the aggression of internation
al Communism in the Far East."
