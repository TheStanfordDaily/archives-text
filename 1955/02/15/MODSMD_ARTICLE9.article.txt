# Stanford Ski Team Will Show Movie Tomorrow Night
## 
### 
Sun, snow, and scenery — the.se
three are mixed together in liberal
portions in what has been called the
"best skiing movie ever made." The
film is Warren Miller's "Symphony
on Skis," a 16-mm. color package
version of a year's travel to the best
ski areas of the world. It is sched
uled to be shown tomorrow night
in Cubberley Auditorium at 8 un
der the auspices of the Stanford ski
team. Price of admission is $1.
The two-hour film, which drew
large crowds at its only other show
ing in the Bay Area earlier this
year, was characterized by one per- !
son as an "inexpensive way to see
some of the places you drearn
about." From Norway to New Zea
land, Seattle to Peru, the photogra
phy records some of the most pic
turesque and spectacular scenery in
the world, and provides a skier's
version of the mountain climber's
answer — "We climb them because |
they are there."
Proceeds from the film will go to
support, next year's ski racing team.
Tickets may be purchased today and
tomorrow at the ski shops in town, ;
from Ski Club officials or team j
members, or at the door tomorrow j
night.
