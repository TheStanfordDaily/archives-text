clared that "the United States must
be prepared to deal with the insta
bility of Latin America."
"Contrary to United States expec
tations, leadership from the middle
class of Latin America gives no as
surance of political moderation.
They can take democracy or leave
it alone."
"There is abundant evidence,"
"that the leadership of the middle
groups parlays demagoguery into
political advantage."
CITES BUREAUCRACY
He cited that bureaucracy has
"grown alarmingly" as state control i
has replaced private enterprise, and
individualism has given way to col-,
lectivism.
As a result, the Latin American
j republics have become "introvert
ed," placing international issues in
a national framework and shunning
international diplomacy.
"Latin Americans like to think
their nations are on the threshold
of becoming modern, industrial
states. But half of the people are
j both poverty stricken and sick."
However. .Johnson points out, so- !
cial and economic democracy have
emerged along with the new indus
trial groups and the middle classes.
"Social justice has become more
important than legal justice, and so
j cial equality has become more im-
I portant than political economy."

The growth of collectivism and state capitalism in the presence
of instability, frustration and poverty has characterized the
emergence of "new dynamism, self-confidence and astonishing
progress" in Latin -America, according to John J. Johnson, Stan
ford history professor.

Turning to the Argentine situa
tion, he explained that "Argentine
policy and United States policy doq't
coincide. The basic differences arc
insoluble."
Only short-range, limited agree
| mcnts are possible with Argentina's
Peron, he believed.
Latin America docs not consider
Communism offensive, Johnson said.
"Many individuals in high places
take delight in seeing the USSR
harass the United States. They rea
son that all the progress of the
USSR cannot be entirely bad."
Therefore, Johnson continued,
"the United States must not cxpcct
Latin America to accept, its version
of what the Communist threat
means to the free world,"
CRITICAL VIEW
Latin AmcHca takes a critical
view of United States policy, he said.
"They believe anything we do or do
not do is intervention. And they
love to criticize our culture, or lack
of it."
He pointed out the tremendous
| changes that have occurred inside
Latin America due to the shift of
j wealth concentration from rural to
! urban areas which has produced ex
| panding cities.
Johnson said the population of
Latin America, which is now 165
I million, is growing at the rate of
| 2 x /i per cent per year.

emergence of "new dynamism, self-confidence and astonishing
progress" in Latin -America, according to John J. Johnson, Stan

Turning to the Argentine situa
tion, he explained that "Argentine
policy and United States policy doq't
coincide. The basic differences arc
insoluble."
Only short-range, limited agree
| mcnts are possible with Argentina's
Peron, he believed.
Latin America docs not consider
Communism offensive, Johnson said.
"Many individuals in high places
take delight in seeing the USSR
harass the United States. They rea
son that all the progress of the
USSR cannot be entirely bad."
Therefore, Johnson continued,
"the United States must not cxpcct
Latin America to accept, its version
of what the Communist threat
means to the free world,"
CRITICAL VIEW
Latin AmcHca takes a critical
view of United States policy, he said.
"They believe anything we do or do
not do is intervention. And they
love to criticize our culture, or lack
of it."
He pointed out the tremendous
| changes that have occurred inside
Latin America due to the shift of
j wealth concentration from rural to
! urban areas which has produced ex
| panding cities.
Johnson said the population of
Latin America, which is now 165
I million, is growing at the rate of
| 2 x /i per cent per year.

clared that "the United States must
be prepared to deal with the insta
bility of Latin America."
"Contrary to United States expec
tations, leadership from the middle
class of Latin America gives no as
surance of political moderation.
They can take democracy or leave
it alone."
"There is abundant evidence,"
"that the leadership of the middle
groups parlays demagoguery into
political advantage."
CITES BUREAUCRACY
He cited that bureaucracy has
"grown alarmingly" as state control i
has replaced private enterprise, and
individualism has given way to col-,
lectivism.
As a result, the Latin American
j republics have become "introvert
ed," placing international issues in
a national framework and shunning
international diplomacy.
"Latin Americans like to think
their nations are on the threshold
of becoming modern, industrial
states. But half of the people are
j both poverty stricken and sick."
However. .Johnson points out, so- !
cial and economic democracy have
emerged along with the new indus
trial groups and the middle classes.
"Social justice has become more
important than legal justice, and so
j cial equality has become more im-
I portant than political economy."

The growth of collectivism and state capitalism in the presence
of instability, frustration and poverty has characterized the
emergence of "new dynamism, self-confidence and astonishing
progress" in Latin -America, according to John J. Johnson, Stan
ford history professor.
