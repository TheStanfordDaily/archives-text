# Old Boy Views Dim Old Sagas
## 
### 
California history, starting with
the '49ers and continuing through
the San Francisco earthquake up to
the present day, will be the theme
of this month's Chaparral which
goes on sale today.
Articles, jokes, and pictures on
California's earlier and livelier days
will be included in this issue. Ex
change jokes will be cut down quite
a bit, but not completely "banned"
in favor of campus humor.
The Chaparral will be on sale at
the four corners of Quad and at the
post office for 30 cents a copy.
