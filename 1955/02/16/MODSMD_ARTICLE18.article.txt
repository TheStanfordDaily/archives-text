Blood is expensive. Could
you afford to pay $30 a pint to
replace large quantities of lost
blood?
Bocau.se the University does not
pay for the cost of blood transfu
sions. the Student Health Committee
opened an account for tho ASSU in
the San Mateo County Blood Bank,
now the Peninsula Memorial Biood
Bank. This account was opened in
February, 11)52, when the first pint
of blood was deposited.
Without the existence of the AS
SU account, each transfusion would
cost the student $30 — $22.50 for
blood and $7.50 for its processing
So long as a balance is maintained
in the blood bank, the student docs
not pay for the blood; he has only to
pay the $7.50 processing charge.
The ASSU account now has a bal

ance of two units. Two pints of
blood is meager operating capital
for a student body of 7,106. One
automobile accident could bankrupt
the account.
Last year JO pints of blood were
ijiven to the victim of one accident.
A bleeding duodenal ulcer took an
other 1'J pints. The academic year of
1953-54 saw the use of 50 per cent
of all the blood that, has been given
to students,
It does not take long to yive, Blood
Bank spokesmen point out. The
total process takes about half an
hour.
On Friday there will be a mobile
collecting unit from the Blood Bank
at the Menlo Park Recreation Cen
ter from 3 to 7 p.m. Students under
21 who wish to donate but did not
pick up parental release cards on
Monday may bring a signed state
ment from one of their parents.
