# Village Sale Price Set by Government
## Trustees to Consider Offer Tomorrow Night 
### RUSS WILKS Managing Editor, The Daily 
The federal government made known yesterday, through ar
unofficial advance telephone report by the Public Housing Au
thority that they would sell Stanford Village to the Universit'
for $1,170,733.63.
The final report to Stanford is expected to be.mailed shortly

by J. G. Melville, field director for
the PIIA in San Francisco,
The PHA is offering 78.72 of the
85 acres in the Village. The charge
per acre is $16,044 which actually
makes the gross price $1,262,9813.68.
A discount of $92,250 is being al
lowed by the PHA, however, in ac
cordance with its national policy in
dealing with dispositions of housing
projects. If is designed to assist
Stanford so that it can cover pos
sible de-activation losses which stem
from things like building removal
and loss of rental income.
The discount actually minimizes
the value of each acre to $14,872.12
and thus the net price of $1,170,-
733.68.
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY
The other 6.9 acres in the area
will go to the Department of the In
terior for use as an addition to its
nearby U.S. Geological Survey
building. The addition will double
the existing geological building fa
cilities and the government will es
tablish its Western headquarters
there.
The sale price information will be
presented to the Stanford Board of
Trustees at its meeting tomorrow
night if the final details have been
worked out. The board won't make
any decision at this time, however,
as administration and board com
mittees will study and discuss the
government's oiler and then meet
with the FHA. . â€¢
CONSIDERATIONS
The main considerations that the
University will have to make are:
1. The possibility of fitting the
price into its financial program and
the problem of eventually disposing
of the Village.
2. The consideration of Avhat por
tion and when to sell to the Stan
ford Research Institute for its
permanent building. The SRI has
been thinking in terms of a 30-acre
plot.
3. The consideration of the city of
Mcnlo Park. Stanford and Menlo
Park have an understanding that
Stanford will eventually sell the
Village to them when it no longer
needs the space.
4. What to do about the request
for Village space for a Menlo Park
elementary school.
The Board of Trustees might con
ceivably reach a decision at their
March 17 meeting.
RENTAL SINCE
The decision and agreement on a
price by the government to finally
sell the Village land has been long

coming. Stanford rented the are
from them in August of 1946 after
the Army hospital had been closei
down. In 1949 Stanford attempts
to buy the land, but negotiations
were frozen by the Korean War
Housing Act. Mcnlo Park also en
tered the picture at this time, stat
ing that if would like the land for
planned development and zoning.
After the Korean conflict wa
lied Menlo Park and the PHA ex
changed numerous letters with the
former demanding a decision on the
Village's future and the government
saying a decision would be forth
coming in good time.
For the past couple of years the
government had been comide.ii: 5
establishing an Army training ba 3
and an armory in the Village, but
heated protests from Mcnlo Park
discouraged the projcct.
Stanford, meanwhile faced with
an overwhelming student housin t,
program, stated last year that 1
would need the Village for another
four to five years. There are 3:
apartments in the Village which ;; 1
always occupied and room for ft
students in the dorms which are fuil
in autumn quarter.
