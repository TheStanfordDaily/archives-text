A v/orricd Excom is watching the clock as
it hurries to complete discussions on the pro
posed new ASSU Constitution which it hopes
to present in referendum form for student ap
proval during spring quarter. Up until now
discussions on the document have moved
slowly very slowlyâ€”and with the end of the
quarter in sight Excom has scheduled regular
meetings twice a week to speed the process.
In additi n to its regular Wednesday night
meetir - s iJxcom has set meetings for 4:15
rach buiiUay afternoon. The problem: Getting
a quorum of Excom members to attend meet
ings held on sunny Sunday afternoons.
Tonight in Excom the draft Constitution's
provision for a cabinet will be the topic of
deliberation. Two questions must be consid
ered: First, should such a cabinet be in the
legislature (last week set as a body of ap
proximately 20 representatives)? Second,
v/hat should the membership of such a cabi
net be?
In a Constitution discussion hampered by
the absence of a quorum Sunday afternoon,

Excom members indicated that board chair
men would probably sit on the cabinet, but
felt it necessary to set up criteria for deter
mining the difference between A.SSU boards
and ASSU committees. This matter will prob
ably be brought up for formal discussion to
night.

ASSU President Peter Bing indicates that Liz
Livadary's Student - Faculty Committee and
Ann Irvine's special Honor Code Subcommit
tee will present reports to Excom tonight. The
Honor Code Subcommittee, Bing says, will
probably be called, on for regularly weekly
reports to Excom "to keep us posted" in this
important matter. Excom has heard little re
action of any kind to its Honor Code action of
last week clarifying the question of taking
examinations from the classroom. Representa
tives of the administration have expressed sat
isfaction with the m;?ve, and studfent opinion
seems to be generally favorable.
The Excom meeting, open to the student
body, v/ill begin tonight at 7:30 in the Excom
room, Student Union.
