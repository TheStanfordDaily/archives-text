"Siddown," sez the editor, "and write some
thing funny."
I crawled toward my typewriter.
"And in five minutes too, y'understand?"
But nothing's funny any more. The bloom
•.g stoplight is sitting out there on Palm Drive,
just waiting for a chance to make the Village
lads late to their eight o'clocks.
The so - called - ride - shelier-actually-a-farce
at this end of Palm Drive isn't a necessity now
that the rains have gone, so that I can't make
any crude jokes over that. '
UCLA set their scoreboard at 72-0 before the
games last weekend; no humor there. Stark
tragedy before and after the games.
The Daily, once full of raunchy and riotous
p/oof errors, is now jammed with house elec
tion results which no one cares for anyway,
:-j there's nothing to spoof there.
And now, Frank's is demanding ID's.

But, I take consolation in KZSU. KZ still
gives me my laughs. The Voice of the Cam
pus got off a real boffo the other afternoon,
when a girl doing an afternoon show v/as tell
ing of a forthcoming concert. Among the
items to be played, she said, was the "Sonata
in a major."
There's just one thing that,bothers me: Did
she mean it?

I have in my hand (to coin a phrase) a let
ter from the Old Boy at the Chappie Awfuss,
noting an error in The Daily. The Daily said
yesterday that exchange jokes had gone the
way of all flesh in the Chappie.
'Tain't so, sez the epistle. A "sufficient"
amount of exchange jokes are in, sez T. Old
Boy. "Some of them are even new."
Sure. (
Maybe some of them will even be funny.
