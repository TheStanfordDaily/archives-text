# Regnery: Experience in Drama Aids in Giving Biology Lectures

Did you hear a Shakespear
-1 san overtone in that voice ex
plaining dominant genes? No
wonder—read this:
"Dave Regnery, as Bolingbroke,
sometimes hero, took his honors,
managing to keep the balance even.
. . . His performance contrasted
nicely with Marcuse's — Regnery
supplying the vigorous masculine
complement to King Richard's more
volatile, passionate emotions." —
Stanford Daily, May, 1940.
The play: Shakespeare's "Richard
II." The place: Stanford Univer
sity's Little Theater. The actor:
David C. Regnery, at that time a
Stanford junior, and at present as
sociate professor of biology.
"You would be surprised how
much experience in dramatics helps
i:i a teaching situation," Dr. Regnery
recalls now. "Having appeared be
fore large groups of people makes it
I seem not .so difficult to face a lec-
J tare class of 500." Facing such
I groups is now a routine job for
Regnery, who teaches general biol
ogy in conjunction with Dr. Gra
ham DuShane. Dr. Regnery esti
mated that over half of all incoming
freshmen take the Bio 1-2-3 series.
Dramatics, however, was just an
avocation for him. '"I made up my
mind years before I came to college
that biology was the field for me,"
he said. Finishing high school in
San Diego, he entered Stanford in
'37, where he lived in the Encina
basement.
He graduated in '41, after taking a
year off — "which I advocate," he
said. "The older students know
J what they want out of college."
! Woods Hole, a famous marine bio-
I logical laboratory off a cape in Mas
! sachu.setts, was his next stop.
"The fateful fall of '41 I entered
Cal Tech as a graduate student in
biology and managed to complete a
year before enlisting in the Navy.
1 was a hospital corpsman," Regnery
! continued, "part of an epidemiology
| team —tracing down the micro-or
| ganisms behind such things as ty-
I phoid epidemics and pinning them
down."
Back at Cal Tech after the war,
Regnery finished his graduate work
and was awarded a Ph.D. in genet
ics. "Dr. G. W. Beadle first encour
aged me in the field of genetics when
I I was a student and he was a teach

er' here. Later 1 worked with him
at Cal Tech, where he has been do
ing outstanding research work."
Trie year 1!J47, and Dr. Regnery
was again at Stanford—this time to
stay. "I was fortunate to get the
job here," he says modestly. Be
sides his general biology courses, he
teaches an advanced immunology
course, and is engaged in develop
mental genetics research work. "Dr.
C. M. Smith and 1 have been work
ing with unicellular algae, attempt
ing to determine what a gene is and
how it brings about its effects. It's
actually biochemical genetics."

A home in Menlo Park, a wife,
and three, children—ages eight, four,
and almost two—are Regnery's main
spare-time activities now. "My one
expedition into public life was run
ning for the school board in the
Port o 1 a Valley School District,
where I was defeated by 10 votes by
a very good man!"
"I've always liked living things,"
said Professor David Regnery, sit
ting on a table surrounded by a
dozen busy Biology 2 lab students,
"and I»enjoy teaching general biol
ogy. I consider it a real teaching
challenge."

The play: Shakespeare's "Richard
II." The place: Stanford Univer
sity's Little Theater. The actor:
David C. Regnery, at that time a
Stanford junior, and at present as
sociate professor of biology.
"You would be surprised how
much experience in dramatics helps
i:i a teaching situation," Dr. Regnery
recalls now. "Having appeared be
fore large groups of people makes it
I seem not .so difficult to face a lec-
J tare class of 500." Facing such
I groups is now a routine job for
Regnery, who teaches general biol
ogy in conjunction with Dr. Gra
ham DuShane. Dr. Regnery esti
mated that over half of all incoming
freshmen take the Bio 1-2-3 series.
Dramatics, however, was just an
avocation for him. '"I made up my
mind years before I came to college
that biology was the field for me,"
he said. Finishing high school in
San Diego, he entered Stanford in
'37, where he lived in the Encina
basement.
He graduated in '41, after taking a
year off — "which I advocate," he
said. "The older students know
J what they want out of college."
! Woods Hole, a famous marine bio-
I logical laboratory off a cape in Mas
! sachu.setts, was his next stop.
"The fateful fall of '41 I entered
Cal Tech as a graduate student in
biology and managed to complete a
year before enlisting in the Navy.
1 was a hospital corpsman," Regnery
! continued, "part of an epidemiology
| team —tracing down the micro-or
| ganisms behind such things as ty-
I phoid epidemics and pinning them
down."
Back at Cal Tech after the war,
Regnery finished his graduate work
and was awarded a Ph.D. in genet
ics. "Dr. G. W. Beadle first encour
aged me in the field of genetics when
I I was a student and he was a teach

er' here. Later 1 worked with him
at Cal Tech, where he has been do
ing outstanding research work."
Trie year 1!J47, and Dr. Regnery
was again at Stanford—this time to
stay. "I was fortunate to get the
job here," he says modestly. Be
sides his general biology courses, he
teaches an advanced immunology
course, and is engaged in develop
mental genetics research work. "Dr.
C. M. Smith and 1 have been work
ing with unicellular algae, attempt
ing to determine what a gene is and
how it brings about its effects. It's
actually biochemical genetics."

A home in Menlo Park, a wife,
and three, children—ages eight, four,
and almost two—are Regnery's main
spare-time activities now. "My one
expedition into public life was run
ning for the school board in the
Port o 1 a Valley School District,
where I was defeated by 10 votes by
a very good man!"
"I've always liked living things,"
said Professor David Regnery, sit
ting on a table surrounded by a
dozen busy Biology 2 lab students,
"and I»enjoy teaching general biol
ogy. I consider it a real teaching
challenge."
