# Too Small Now?
## Masters Announces New Pavilion Plan 
### JIM PIGOTT 
The early-season successes of Ihe Indian basketballers brought
the long-existent question of "When will Stanford big-wigs ap
prove the building of a newer, bigger, and more modem basket
ball pavilion?" into the limelight again.
This time A 1 Masters, Director of Athletics, has put his best foot

ward. John Warnecke, former Card
footballer, has been employed to do
the preliminary survey work.
At present the most likely site for
the new pavilion appears to be op
posite the present gym between the
areas where the ROTC's drill and
the old band house lies in state. If
the University should decide to go
ahead with the project, the final de
cision on location will be up to the
University's Planning Board.
One of the main factors in decid
ing the feasibility of the project is
the question of cost. The Slats Gill
Coliseum at Corvallis, completed
about two years ago and seating
some 12,000 fans, cost the Beavers
$1,800,000. This included, however,
a large lockcr room in the basement
and several offices — all of which
Stanford already has.
Masters opined that should the
new pavilion be approved, the pres
ent one would be dismantled of its
seats to make room for three cross
court basketball floors for intra

mural use. The abandonment of the
present pavilion would also allow
the Card boxers and wrestlers to
have their own practice areas.
Thus with the opening of prelim
inary work the way is open for
Stanford to come of age in the bas
ketball world and follow the leads
of the Northern Division schools
such as Washington and Oregon.


SMALL SHOE—Like the old woman who lived in the shoe, A 1
Masters has so many Stanford basketball fans he doesn't know
what to do —in the present Pavilion anyway. Masters revealed
plans for a new Pavilion. Since basketball has become big time
at Stanford, the present Pavilion is quite inadequate.
