## 
### DICK NICHOLS 
A classy Firehouse five rolled over
a scrappy Stern 4 team, 47-23, last
night in the Pavilion.
The fighting Firehouse team con
trolled the backboards throughout
the game, getting as many as four
or five shots in a row at their bas
ket. They started out with eight
points before Stern could break into
the column, and after this they were
never headed.
After leading 23-13 at half-time,
the Firemen continued their mas
tery of the boards and held Stein to
a mere 10 points in the second half,
while scoring 24 of their own.
High scorer for the Firemen was
Roger Anderson with 14, followed
by Jack Lillard with 11 and Tor
Fokedel with .nine. Bruce Mac-
Naughton led Stern with six, fol
lowed by Arnie Saaf and Bob Wil
cox with five each. Looking good
on defense were Tom Talbot for the
Firehouse and Saaf and John Sig
lried for Stern.
