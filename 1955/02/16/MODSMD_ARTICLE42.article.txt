# Ram's Head Party Set by Social Board
## 
### 
The Social Co-ordinating Board
decided last week to allow Ram's
Head to hold a cast party from 1
to (! a.m. alter the final performance
of the Winter One-Acts Saturday
night.
Ram's Head representatives at the
meeting said the party could not
begin any earlier—not until all the
scenery had been taken down—and
that there would be little response
to a party postponed a night. The
board stipulated that Ram's Head
must provide an adequate number
of overnight sponsors.
The Social Co-ordinating Board
j also announced some of the dates
i on next quarter's social calendar:
Junior Prom, April 15; Frosh-Soph
Jamboree, April 23; sponsor ..week
end, April 29-May 1; Spring Show,
May 5-7; Con Home Drive, May 11-
15; Spring Sing, May 20; Senior Ball.
