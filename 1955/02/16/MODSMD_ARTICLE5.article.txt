# House Presidents Meet at Banquet
## 
### 
Both incoming and outgoing presi
dents of Stanford's fraternities met
together for an Interfraternity
Council banquet at Betty and Lee's
last night.
The first gathering of its kind, the
banquet enabled recently elected
presidents to become acquainted
with each other and with older mem
bers of the council.
