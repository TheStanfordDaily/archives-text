LONDON'â€”The United States has
indicated to Britain that it envisions
eventual evacuation of Chinese Na-

tionalist forces from the off-short |
islands of Qucmoy and Matsu, re- j
liable sources reported.
Britain considers evacuation of j
Quemoy and Matsu, just off the Red
China mainland, as the next impor
tant step in Formosa cease-fire ef
forts, now that Nationalist forces
have been withdrawn from the
northern Tachen outposts.
The British were reported to be j
advising the U.S. government to j
persuade Generalissimo Chiang Kai- i
shek to agree to withdraw from the
off-shore islands and pull back to
Formosa and the Pescadores.
Chiang told a news conference
yesterday that the Nationalists were
committed to defend Matsu and
Quemoy.
