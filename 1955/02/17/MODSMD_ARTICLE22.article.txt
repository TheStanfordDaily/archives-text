## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 (UP)—Republicans decided today to
hold their 1956 Presidential nominating convention in San Fran
cisco starting the week of Aug. 20.
It will be the first time since 1940, when the Republicans met
in Philadelphia and the Democrats in Chicago, that the two major
+ p ar t[ es | la ve held their convention in

different cities.
The Democrats decided last week
to hold their 1956 convention in Chi
cago.
San Francisco was selected for the
GOP convention by a seven-mem
ber subcommittee. The choice is ex
pected to be approved by the full
GOP National Committee here to
morrow.
It will be the first national, parly
nominating convention held in San
Francisco since the Democrats met
there in 1920.
The Democrats tentatively have
choscn the week starting July 23 for
their convention, but will switch it
to Aug. 13 if certain state laws are
changed to make this possible.
SCHEDULE REVERSED
In either case it will reverse the
schedule of recent years which has
permitted the Democrats to choose
their candidate after the Republi
can ticket was nominated.
Republican National Chairman
Leonard W. Ilall said San Francisco
was clioscn because Republicans
have been talking for years about a
West Coast convention and they de
cided this was the time to have it.
He labeled "just bunk" reports the
GOP leaders wanted to avoid Chi
cago for fear of running into a
strong anti - Eisenhower conserva
tive element.

Although San Francinco wao a late
starter in formal bidding for the
GOP meeting, Hall said the city had
been in the picture for some time.
He said San Francisco invitations
began to jell last Thursday on the
strength of a telephone call from
Mayor Elmer Robinson.
While San Francisco will move
the convention out of the Midwest,
center of much of the GOP "con
servative" element, it. also will take
it into the home state of Senate Re
publican Leader William F. Know
land and Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon. Both have been mentioned
as possible GOP contenders if Mr.
Eisenhower does not make the race.
Governor Goodwin J. Knight said
j tonight "wt Californians are de
lighted" with the "significant" choice
of San Francisco for the 1956 Re
publican nominating convention.
Knight said the convention "will
mark the centennial of the first Re
publican national convetnion which
in 1856 nominated John CliHrles
Fremont of California as its first
candidate for President."
