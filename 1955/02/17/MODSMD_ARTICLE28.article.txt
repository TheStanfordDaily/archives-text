## french crisis 
### 
M. T'r-nn-Polletier, a Fulbright Scholar from
Fraiu studying in the Stanford Business
School, submitted this letter following recent pub
lication in The Daily of an interview with Dr.
Philip Buck of the Political Science Department on
the French political situation.—Ed.

To the Editor:
"You are against the government fur other reasons."
When Mendes-France hud thrown the last sentence
to the Assembly, no deputy of the opposition pro
tested. This silence confirmed that the government
would not be deposed because of the North African
policy, but this issue would be the excuse of the down
full which would have oecured anyway. The Popular
Republicans and some Radicals have never forgiven
Muides-France for not supporting Ihe now-dead EDC.
Generally speaking, they were afraid of too much
power through other successes and resulting popular
support.
Nevertheless, the dynamic approach of Pierre Men
des-France to the problem has given a new Ireful
to the French policy. That is why the French crisis
may last longer. The new Premier must realize that
the country does not want a new "do-nothing" gov
ernment.
The Gaullists, Socialists, Popular Republicans agree
on the necessity of a positive program of action, but
their personal feelings have thus prevented union
under a new Premier. This union is necessary if
confidence is to be restored, in France and abroad,
in the French parliamentary system.
