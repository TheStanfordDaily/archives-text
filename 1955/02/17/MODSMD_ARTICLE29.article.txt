To the Editor:
Wf would like to know what has happened to the
Daily. Not. too long ago one was able to find out what
was happening in the world. Has the world horizon
shrunk today to the acreage of the Stanford, campus?
It seems as if the new motto of the editorial staff ii;;

"Move local news than ever before." Stanford has
both the privilege and the disadvantage of being iso
lated from this troubled world. However, in the past
the Daily was providing us with a bridge lo outside
realities, and was reminding us that our duty is to
become more than the "cookie-pusher" typo of in
tellectual.
To illustrate the change in editorial policy: The in
ternational and national news has been telescoped
from a sizable section of the front page to the tiny
six-inch, box down at the bottom of the page. From
a "learn-and-laugh" technique the editorial cartoons
have become an intricate composition of meaningless
puppets. If the Daily staff feels thai an interview widi
a faculty member replaces the objective reporting ol
the news, it is mistaken since the faculty member's
interpretation of the news must be judged on the basis
of the facts which, unfortunately, we cannot read
anymore.
A new editorial staff does not have to promote
changes just for changes'sake. Change should be im
provement; and we I<-eI that by this standard l lie
new staff shoots wide of the mark.
