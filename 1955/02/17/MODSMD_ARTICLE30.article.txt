To the Editor:
We wouJd like to thank you for the series of articles
and editorials printed in The Daily during the past
week about the Honor Code. We feel their emphasis
upon the Code as a privilege which was in jeopardy
and their recommendation of the new statement by
Excom as a service to the student body (in clarifying
the responsibilities and privileges of both the faculty
and the students) helped to assure the student body
that the Excom action strengthened, rather than
weakened, the Honor Code. Our committee, with the
special Honor Code Committee, will continue this edu
cation of students and faculty alike in order to make
the Stanford Code a success.
