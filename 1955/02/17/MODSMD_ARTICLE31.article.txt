"Spring is sprung, the grass is rizz, I won
der where the birdies is." This thought, bor
rowed from an ancient issue of the Chappie, is
as good as any way to start off an item fraught
with wonderment. About the overlapping sea
sons of sport.
Saturday, reports Mr. Bob Mierow (a gentle
man of journalistic bent who toils for The
Daily), the Sunken Diamond will ting with :>ach
.shouts as "Yer out!" "Play ball!" and "Ump,
you oughta use youi head and build a rock
garden."
And tomorrow night coach Forrest Twogood
of the USC Trojans will for the third time at
tempt to solve the problem of how to put two
men on Tomsic, two men on Lawler, two men
on Selleck, two men on Brown, and two men
oj) Bond.
And still, the papers are full of items about
Wee Santee, Buck Shaw, and others primarily
concerned with seasonal sports. What am I
supposed to think? I can't get excited about
basketball, track, football, and baseball simul

ianeously. There's only one bright spot. One
answer to the problem.
Mr. Bill Kyne of the California Horse Racing
Association, San Mateo, California, operates
an arena of seasonless sport and is currently
open for business. Ah, the bangtails. For the
rest of the quarter thoroughbred trotters, em
blazoned with the colorful silks of Iheir own
ers, will circle Mr. Kyrie's oval in an effort to
take rriy mind off the vagaries of seasonal sport.
While others are getting more neurotic try
ing to split attention between Howie Dallmar
and Everett Dean, your correspondent will be
splitting his attention between box seats and
pari-mutuel windows. Splitting my GI check
between the cashier's office and the sport of
kings.
Well, sir, this may not interest you too deep
ly, but while you're running from ball parlc3 to
pavilions, I'll be sitting patiently waiting lor
the start of the seventh race, my binoculars
slung from my neck and a cool lemonade in
my left hand.
