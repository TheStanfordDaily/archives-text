# I Hear Music...

Someone wh6 knows him told
me once that Stan Kenton could
make a million dollars selling
oranges. His point was that
Kenton is first and foremost a
salesman, as anyone who has
seen him emcee one of his con
certs will probably understand.
Spotting the entire affair is a lot
j of mellow gab that is at least as
entrancing as the music it punctu
| ates. The same gab is found on the
first record of Capitol's new $25
package, "The Kenton Era."
I had better admit now that I think
: Kenton's is one of the greatest bands
j around. But I do not think he is
| in the mainstream of jazz.
Kenton and Capitol are out to
convince the public that his band
j has led the development of modern
jazz. The big new album contains
j some fine fascinating sounds.
But there is little in the music that
seems close to the trends jazz is
taking. Kenton's music has always
tended toward heavy dramatics and
harsh, moody noises. Modern jazz
themes are predominantly light
hearted, its voicings are soft, and
its moods are tender and occasion
ally brittle. Meanwhile, Kenton has
j remained a lumber dealer.
But Kenton does contribute—for
one thing, a group of over-serious
! arrangers and musicians whom time
i and other employers generally re
fine into valuable jazzmen. Rogers,
Rugulo, Machito, Ken Hanna, Lau
rindo Almeida, Bob Cooper, Shelley
Manne, June Christy, and others
have gone on to make individual
I contributions in new forms.
Besides weaning Inventive musi
j cians, Kenton has undeniably de
veloped a distinctive style. The
j brassy arrangements of Russo and

ROGER HAGAN

Ilolman are often also sensitive and
moving. They make spectacular use
of classical techniques like counter
point, polyphony, dynamics, and
light solos in contrast to shaking
blasts of noise. This type of experi
mentation, plus the use of low-end
brass rhythm sections, weird instru
mental timbres, and arresting chord
substitutions, makes for exciting
listening.
So even if Kenton is peripheral
to jazz, he is fun to' listen to.
Now appearing at Pack's on Mar
ket Street is one group that sings in
the Kenton style, anyway. The Four
Freshmen, who have appeared and
recorded with Kenton, are putting
on a terrific show.
Meanwhile "mouldy figs" (Dixie
fans) should be having a field day,
with three of the country's best in
the city—Kid Ory at the Hangover,
Turk Murphy at the Tin Angel, and
Bob Scobey downstairs at Italian
Village. Another worthwhile city
fixture is Cul Tjader tit Club Ma
cumba, playing Alio - Cuban and
mambo.
Tonight's symphony program in
cludes Vivaldi's Concerto in G and
Lalo's "Symphonic Espagnole," fea
turing violinist Zino Francescatti,

Overture to Borodin's "Prince Igor."
