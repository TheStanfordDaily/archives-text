# BERKELEY MAYOR:
## Demo Power Rests With Common Man 
### RUTH WOLPE 
"The Democratic party and
the democratic principle are the ;
hardest course in the world, for
strength or weakness is based
on the common man," said the
Rev. Laurance L. Cross, mayor
of Berkeley, Tuesday night.
Mayor Cross addressed a Jeffer
son-Jackson dinner oi the Young
Democrats of the Stanford Area. He
spoke on "Where Do We Go from I
Here?"
Referring to tne Democratic party,
Cross stated, "We did well nation
ally, but on teh whole we were as
badly beaten as we could have been
in California. The question is 'Where
do we go from here?' •
"We must face the fact that we
can't win elections just because
Warren is no longer here," the may
or stated. "What beat, us was the |
Republican machine."
"RUN TO BUILD"
"We shouldn't run to win; wo
should run to build," the speaker
said. "It is important to run and to
stand for our ideals. Norman Thom
as was beaten every Lime, but ev
erything he has advocated since H)()H
has come to pass.
"Another thing we must realize,"
he stated, "is that the 3:2 Democratic
to Republican registration in Cali
fornia is a phony. Many of the Dem- |
ocrats who have come to this state j
(especially those from the South) j
are conservatives. Let's not fool |
ourselves any more or go around I
with false confidence. Democratic j
registration is just sentiment with I
the Southerners."
VOTE I OR PRINCIPLE
"We must also realize that this
talk of 'I vote for the man' must be
destroyed," Cross said. "We vote for
the principle, not the man; the prin
ciple is bigger than the man. The
man is like an iceberg, one-seventh
of which you see, but six-sevenths j
of which is under water."
"If you vote for the man," he con
tinued, "you vote for the one-sev
enth. You are not voting for the
principles or pressures that are the i
six-sevenths guiding his actions."
"We must not be discouraged by j
defeats; we must not be discouraged j
that the press is against us, that I
money is against us," he concluded, j
"By the year 2000, we shall live to :
see the kingdom of things as they !
surely shall be."
