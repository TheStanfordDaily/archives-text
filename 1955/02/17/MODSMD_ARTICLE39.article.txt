THE CARE AND FEEDING OF BOOKS
You busy college people — you with your classes and your
studying and your social activities and your three-lodged races
it is no wonder that you have so little time for reading. 1 mean
reading for the pure pleasure of it, not to cram for exams. It is
a sad omission, and my heart goes out to you. 1 do, however,
take comfort from the fact that the graduation season ap
proaches. Many of you will soon leave the hurly-burly of college
for the tranquility of the outside world. Oh, you'll love it on
the outside! It is a quiet life, a gracious and coutemplative
life, a life of ease and relaxation, of plenty of time to enjoy the
treasures of literature.
It is with you in mind that 1 sit now in my cane-bottomed
rocker and close my kindly gray eyes and smoke a mellow
Philip Morris cigarette and remember books that made me
laugh and books that made me cry and, remembering, laugh and
cry again. It is, 1 say, with you in mind that J sit thus and
rock thus and close my kindly gray eyes thus and smoke a
Philip Morris thus and laugh and cry thus, for 1 wish to recom
mend these lovely and affecting books to you so that you too may
someday sit in your cane-bottomed rockers and close your kindly
gray eyes and smoke a mellow Philip Morris and remember
books that made you laugh and books that made you cry and,
remembering, laugh and cry again.
Sitting and rocking, my limpid brown eyes closed in reverie,
a plume of white smoke curling lazily upward from my excellent
Philip Morris cigarette, 1 remember a lovely and affecting
book called Blond on the Grits by that most talented young
Southerner, Richard Membrane Haw. It is a tender and poignant
story of a sensitive Alabama boy who passes safely through
puberty only to be devoured by boll weevils ... A lovely and
affecting book.
I puff my splendid Philip Morris cigarette and close my danc
ing blue eyes and recall another book, a thrilling true adventure,
lovely and affecting, called I Climbed Kv< rest the Hard I la//
by Cliff S her pa. Mr. Sherpa, as everyone knows, was the first
man to reach the peak of Mt. Everest by tunneling from below.
In his book he gives a lovely and affecting account of his trip,
which was not as easy as it sounds, you may lie sure.
J light another merry Philip Morris cigarette and close my
lambent hazel eyes and recollect another book - fAje on Ihe /• arm
by Dick Woolly. This is a short book 'only 55 words and
rather a dull one. It would not be worth mentioning here were
it not for the fact that the author is a sheep.
I exhale a cloud of snowy white smoke from my bracing Philip
Morris cigarette and shut my laughing green eyes and think
of the vast, vast array of historical novels that have given
me pleasure.
There is Blood on the Visor by Richard Membrane Haw Hie
who wrote the lovely and affecting Blood on the. Grits). There
is Cold Steel and Hot Flashes by Emmaline Prentiss Moulting.
There is The. Black Shield of Siijafoos by Wruth Wright. There*
is Four Quarts in a Galleon by William Makepiece Clambroth.
There are many, many others, all lovely, all affecting.
But sitting here, drawing on my matchless Philip Morris
cigarette, my saucy amber eyes closed tightly, 1 am thinking
that the loveliest, most affecting of all historical novels is May
Fuster's classic, I Was a Serf for the F. 8.1. Mrs. Faster, justly
famed for her rich historical tapestries, has outdone herself
in this tempestuous romance of Angela Bodice, fiery daughter
of an entailed fief, who after a great struggle rises to the lofty
position of head-linesman to the Emperor of Bosnia and then
throws it all away to lead the downtrodden peasants in a revolt
against the mackerel tax. She later becomes Ferdinand Magellan.
But the list of fine books is endless, as you will soon discover
who are about to leave the turmoil of the campus and enter into
the serene world outside, where a man has time to read and rock
and close his rakish taupe eyes and smoke good Philip Morris
cigarettes.

Philip Morris cigarette, 1 remember a lovely and affecting
book called Blond on the Grits by that most talented young
Southerner, Richard Membrane Haw. It is a tender and poignant
story of a sensitive Alabama boy who passes safely through
puberty only to be devoured by boll weevils ... A lovely and
affecting book.
I puff my splendid Philip Morris cigarette and close my danc
ing blue eyes and recall another book, a thrilling true adventure,
lovely and affecting, called I Climbed Kv< rest the Hard I la//
by Cliff S her pa. Mr. Sherpa, as everyone knows, was the first
man to reach the peak of Mt. Everest by tunneling from below.
In his book he gives a lovely and affecting account of his trip,
which was not as easy as it sounds, you may lie sure.
J light another merry Philip Morris cigarette and close my
lambent hazel eyes and recollect another book - fAje on Ihe /• arm
by Dick Woolly. This is a short book 'only 55 words and
rather a dull one. It would not be worth mentioning here were
it not for the fact that the author is a sheep.
I exhale a cloud of snowy white smoke from my bracing Philip
Morris cigarette and shut my laughing green eyes and think
of the vast, vast array of historical novels that have given
me pleasure.
There is Blood on the Visor by Richard Membrane Haw Hie
who wrote the lovely and affecting Blood on the. Grits). There
is Cold Steel and Hot Flashes by Emmaline Prentiss Moulting.
There is The. Black Shield of Siijafoos by Wruth Wright. There*
is Four Quarts in a Galleon by William Makepiece Clambroth.
There are many, many others, all lovely, all affecting.
But sitting here, drawing on my matchless Philip Morris
cigarette, my saucy amber eyes closed tightly, 1 am thinking
that the loveliest, most affecting of all historical novels is May
Fuster's classic, I Was a Serf for the F. 8.1. Mrs. Faster, justly
famed for her rich historical tapestries, has outdone herself
in this tempestuous romance of Angela Bodice, fiery daughter
of an entailed fief, who after a great struggle rises to the lofty
position of head-linesman to the Emperor of Bosnia and then
throws it all away to lead the downtrodden peasants in a revolt
against the mackerel tax. She later becomes Ferdinand Magellan.
But the list of fine books is endless, as you will soon discover
who are about to leave the turmoil of the campus and enter into
the serene world outside, where a man has time to read and rock
and close his rakish taupe eyes and smoke good Philip Morris
cigarettes.

THE CARE AND FEEDING OF BOOKS
You busy college people — you with your classes and your
studying and your social activities and your three-lodged races
it is no wonder that you have so little time for reading. 1 mean
reading for the pure pleasure of it, not to cram for exams. It is
a sad omission, and my heart goes out to you. 1 do, however,
take comfort from the fact that the graduation season ap
proaches. Many of you will soon leave the hurly-burly of college
for the tranquility of the outside world. Oh, you'll love it on
the outside! It is a quiet life, a gracious and coutemplative
life, a life of ease and relaxation, of plenty of time to enjoy the
treasures of literature.
It is with you in mind that 1 sit now in my cane-bottomed
rocker and close my kindly gray eyes and smoke a mellow
Philip Morris cigarette and remember books that made me
laugh and books that made me cry and, remembering, laugh and
cry again. It is, 1 say, with you in mind that J sit thus and
rock thus and close my kindly gray eyes thus and smoke a
Philip Morris thus and laugh and cry thus, for 1 wish to recom
mend these lovely and affecting books to you so that you too may
someday sit in your cane-bottomed rockers and close your kindly
gray eyes and smoke a mellow Philip Morris and remember
books that made you laugh and books that made you cry and,
remembering, laugh and cry again.

a plume of white smoke curling lazily upward from my excellent

But sitting here, drawing on my matchless Philip Morris
cigarette, my saucy amber eyes closed tightly, 1 am thinking
that the loveliest, most affecting of all historical novels is May
Fuster's classic, I Was a Serf for the F. 8.1. Mrs. Faster, justly
famed for her rich historical tapestries, has outdone herself
in this tempestuous romance of Angela Bodice, fiery daughter
of an entailed fief, who after a great struggle rises to the lofty
position of head-linesman to the Emperor of Bosnia and then
throws it all away to lead the downtrodden peasants in a revolt
against the mackerel tax. She later becomes Ferdinand Magellan.
But the list of fine books is endless, as you will soon discover
who are about to leave the turmoil of the campus and enter into
the serene world outside, where a man has time to read and rock
and close his rakish taupe eyes and smoke good Philip Morris
cigarettes.
