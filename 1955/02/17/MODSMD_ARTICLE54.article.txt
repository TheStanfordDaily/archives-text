# Stone Termed a 'Typical Critic of Modern School'
## 
### STEW TOY 
Although Wilfred H. Stone of
the English Department picks
Robert Penn Warren, F. R. Lea
vis, and Alan Tate as typical
modern literary critics, we
would be willing to bet that
Stone himself comes closest to
being a representative of the
modern school.
And his avowal that he has '"al
ways avoided joining a school of
criticism" makes him all the more
typical.
Stone, whose intense, deep-set
eyes, black, disheveled hair and
brooding appearance remind us of
some famous poet or anarchist whom
we can't quite place, thinks many
critics are becoming too detached
and scientific in their analyses.
"They have dug in with a sharp
scalpel and tried to show us what
art is made of," he says, "but by
overly de-emphasizing the literary
history around the art work and the
artist's personality they have lost
much of the literature's worth.
"The more you know about the
historical and social climate sur
rounding an art work the richer will
be your understanding and enjoy
ment of it."
In his book, "Religion and Art of
William Hale White (Mark Ruther
ford)." published by the Stanford
Press last fall, Stone has tried to
capture some of this richness. The
book is a critical biography, which
he calls "a psychological interpreta
tion of a man's career, showing how
his personal predicament was re
corded in fictional form."
MAIN INTERESTS
Stone's main interest is poetry and
the novel, especially in the 19th
century. His pet Stanford class is
liis "Introduction to Poetry."
We asked him what he thought
modern poetry was coming to—if
it was about to become extinct. "It's
true that the poetic audience has
diminished," he said, "but we're in
one of the most vital periods in
poetry's development in a long time.
"A lot of people feel modern
poetry is obscure, but this is at least
partly an illusion. Modern poetry
certainly tends to be highly ex
perimental, but the difficulty in read
ing some of it arises from the di
visions in our moral and cultural
context. Many poets have felt the
need of finding unorthodox vehicles
for unorthodox statements."
Stone felt that the novel, although
it has kept up a wide audience, might
have difficulty maintaining its quali
ty in the face of the masses' de
mand for sex and violence.
The competition in other forms of
entertainment has forced the novel
to conform to this demand, he says.
And the fast pace of modern life
lias slashed into popular acceptance
of "worthwhile" books. "People just

don't have time for thoughtful
books."
BIOGRAPHY
Stone was born in Springfield,
Mass., in 1918. He received his M.A.
from the University of Minnesota.
During the war he was a blimp pilot
in the Navy, escorting convoys and
chasing submarines.
In 1946 he started graduate work
at Harvard, where he received his
Ph.D. and taught freshman English.
He went to England for two years in
1949 on a Fulbright Scholarship, at
tached to the London.
His familiarity with Harvard
prompted us to ask him to compare
the eastern university with Stanford.
"Stanford students," he says, "are
just as intelligent, if not more so,
than Harvard students. Particularly
this year's class, which has an
enormous brain power and capacity
for learning.
"But at Harvard, students are in
the middle of an ugly, crowded city,
where life is intense and realistic.
Stanford students live on a country
estate where everything is lovely.
This is all very nice, but perhaps
they aren't made as aware of the un
lovely problems of life as Harvard
students are."
FARM DEFICIENCIES
He thinks Stanford's main de
ficiences are its bookstore ("It should
be three times as big and hold books,
not gifts!") and its lack of a literary

magazine, which would improve the
intellectual atmosphere and provide
students with an outside activity that
demands some intelligence.
He is interested in doing some
thing about the latter deficiency by
organizing a group of students in
terested in writing for a proposed
magazine. He fears the money for
the venture will be anything but
easy to obtain. But he thinks all
efforts for the magazine's realiza
tion will be worthwhile in contrib- |
uting to Stanford's "increasingly!
bright future."

"They have dug in with a sharp
scalpel and tried to show us what
art is made of," he says, "but by
overly de-emphasizing the literary
history around the art work and the
artist's personality they have lost
much of the literature's worth.
"The more you know about the
historical and social climate sur
rounding an art work the richer will
be your understanding and enjoy
ment of it."
In his book, "Religion and Art of
William Hale White (Mark Ruther
ford)." published by the Stanford
Press last fall, Stone has tried to
capture some of this richness. The
book is a critical biography, which
he calls "a psychological interpreta
tion of a man's career, showing how
his personal predicament was re
corded in fictional form."
MAIN INTERESTS
Stone's main interest is poetry and
the novel, especially in the 19th
century. His pet Stanford class is
liis "Introduction to Poetry."
We asked him what he thought
modern poetry was coming to—if
it was about to become extinct. "It's
true that the poetic audience has
diminished," he said, "but we're in
one of the most vital periods in
poetry's development in a long time.
"A lot of people feel modern
poetry is obscure, but this is at least
partly an illusion. Modern poetry
certainly tends to be highly ex
perimental, but the difficulty in read
ing some of it arises from the di
visions in our moral and cultural
context. Many poets have felt the
need of finding unorthodox vehicles
for unorthodox statements."
Stone felt that the novel, although
it has kept up a wide audience, might
have difficulty maintaining its quali
ty in the face of the masses' de
mand for sex and violence.
The competition in other forms of
entertainment has forced the novel
to conform to this demand, he says.
And the fast pace of modern life
lias slashed into popular acceptance
of "worthwhile" books. "People just

don't have time for thoughtful
books."
BIOGRAPHY
Stone was born in Springfield,
Mass., in 1918. He received his M.A.
from the University of Minnesota.
During the war he was a blimp pilot
in the Navy, escorting convoys and
chasing submarines.
In 1946 he started graduate work
at Harvard, where he received his
Ph.D. and taught freshman English.
He went to England for two years in
1949 on a Fulbright Scholarship, at
tached to the London.
His familiarity with Harvard
prompted us to ask him to compare
the eastern university with Stanford.
"Stanford students," he says, "are
just as intelligent, if not more so,
than Harvard students. Particularly
this year's class, which has an
enormous brain power and capacity
for learning.
"But at Harvard, students are in
the middle of an ugly, crowded city,
where life is intense and realistic.
Stanford students live on a country
estate where everything is lovely.
This is all very nice, but perhaps
they aren't made as aware of the un
lovely problems of life as Harvard
students are."
FARM DEFICIENCIES
He thinks Stanford's main de
ficiences are its bookstore ("It should
be three times as big and hold books,
not gifts!") and its lack of a literary

magazine, which would improve the
intellectual atmosphere and provide
students with an outside activity that
demands some intelligence.
He is interested in doing some
thing about the latter deficiency by
organizing a group of students in
terested in writing for a proposed
magazine. He fears the money for
the venture will be anything but
easy to obtain. But he thinks all
efforts for the magazine's realiza
tion will be worthwhile in contrib- |
uting to Stanford's "increasingly!
bright future."

the English Department picks
Robert Penn Warren, F. R. Lea

tion of a man's career, showing how
his personal predicament was re
corded in fictional form."
MAIN INTERESTS
Stone's main interest is poetry and
the novel, especially in the 19th
century. His pet Stanford class is
liis "Introduction to Poetry."
We asked him what he thought
modern poetry was coming to—if
it was about to become extinct. "It's
true that the poetic audience has
diminished," he said, "but we're in
one of the most vital periods in
poetry's development in a long time.
"A lot of people feel modern
poetry is obscure, but this is at least
partly an illusion. Modern poetry
certainly tends to be highly ex
perimental, but the difficulty in read
ing some of it arises from the di
visions in our moral and cultural
context. Many poets have felt the
need of finding unorthodox vehicles
for unorthodox statements."
Stone felt that the novel, although
it has kept up a wide audience, might
have difficulty maintaining its quali
ty in the face of the masses' de
mand for sex and violence.
The competition in other forms of
entertainment has forced the novel
to conform to this demand, he says.
And the fast pace of modern life
lias slashed into popular acceptance
of "worthwhile" books. "People just

don't have time for thoughtful
books."
BIOGRAPHY
Stone was born in Springfield,
Mass., in 1918. He received his M.A.
from the University of Minnesota.
During the war he was a blimp pilot
in the Navy, escorting convoys and
chasing submarines.
In 1946 he started graduate work
at Harvard, where he received his
Ph.D. and taught freshman English.
He went to England for two years in
1949 on a Fulbright Scholarship, at
tached to the London.
His familiarity with Harvard
prompted us to ask him to compare
the eastern university with Stanford.
"Stanford students," he says, "are
just as intelligent, if not more so,
than Harvard students. Particularly
this year's class, which has an
enormous brain power and capacity
for learning.
"But at Harvard, students are in
the middle of an ugly, crowded city,
where life is intense and realistic.
Stanford students live on a country
estate where everything is lovely.
This is all very nice, but perhaps
they aren't made as aware of the un
lovely problems of life as Harvard
students are."
FARM DEFICIENCIES
He thinks Stanford's main de
ficiences are its bookstore ("It should
be three times as big and hold books,
not gifts!") and its lack of a literary

magazine, which would improve the
intellectual atmosphere and provide
students with an outside activity that
demands some intelligence.
He is interested in doing some
thing about the latter deficiency by
organizing a group of students in
terested in writing for a proposed
magazine. He fears the money for
the venture will be anything but
easy to obtain. But he thinks all
efforts for the magazine's realiza
tion will be worthwhile in contrib- |
uting to Stanford's "increasingly!
bright future."
