# 'PROFESSIONAL ENTERAINMENT'
## One-Acts Curtain-Raiser Scores Hit With Audience 
### PHYLLIS FERGUSON 
High praise is easy to give and usually undeserved, but the
Ram's Head Winter One-Acts deserve sincere applause, and a
full house applauded.
Working with three excellent student-written plays, the direc
tors and cast presented a very entertaining and quite professional

•performance. No one play can be
picked out as superior, for each was
entirely different and a fine work in
its own right.
Rich a r d Learman's "The Sea
Shell" effectively used symbols to
point out some basic concepts of life.
Bill Burke's excellent direction es
tablished a smooth-flowing mood,
on which the play depends. Through
an unusual set at the seashore, spe
cial lighting effects, and blocking,
the symbolism was carried out ef
fectively.
Roth Carla Wood and Roger Can
nell gave smooth, sincere perform
ances as the two teen-agers. Larrie
Minkoff was also quite convincing in
a difficult role, although he over
played the part, by keeping consist
ently on a high level,
DELIGHTFUL COMEDY
Barbara Spence's "The House in
th Country" was a completely de
lightful comedy, particularly in that
the cast, as well as the audience,
seemed to be having fun with it.
Through effective blocking, added
bits of business, and perfect timing,
director A 1 Reid added many laughs
to an already funny script.
All three students — Hugh Rob
erts, Ron Baker, and Jim Montgom
ery gave polished performances and
worked especially well together.
As the eccentric wife Martha Rol
ler created a perfect comic charac
ter. Her mannerisms and voice were
technically perfect, and she sus
tained (lie part with apparent ease.
Reler Hurt/ got many laughs in
his part nr. Miss Rotter's stodgy
husband. Two small but. hilarious
caricature parts were those of the
moving men, Gary Waynesrnith and
Wally Carson.
SHOW CLIMAX
The climax of the show was Bruce
Lowry's "Two Squared," a realistic
drama. The play is difficult to cany
across to an audience, but, it was
remarkably we|l done.
Much credit, goes to Joel Rogosin
for his excellent direction of char
acterization and ensemble acting.
The staging was keyed to the mood
and meaning of the play, and Rogo
sin got the moat from his actors.
Here Boynton gave a particularly
outstanding performance as the
beautiful Southern wife. Her sensi
tive characterization atid smooth
technique gave the desired depth
to the play.
As her husband, Walt Brown also
displayed a very sensitive under
standing of the play.
The production will be repeated
tonight and tomorrow night at 8:15
in the Little Theater.
