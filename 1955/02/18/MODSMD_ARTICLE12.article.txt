# Jake Lagunita Officially Open Today
## 
### 
Lake Lagunita will open of
ficially today at 1 p.m. for swim
ming and canocing, the Execu
tive Committee of the ASSU de
cided Wednesday night.
Excom made its decision to open
the lake early this year because the
, water level is already as high as it
| will be allowed to no. The dike
j wall between Roble and Lake Lag is
weak and the state will not. allow
the University to add more water.
Excom authorized full-time duty
for I if" guards starting today at 1
p.m. On week days life guards will
work from 1 to 112Â» p.m. and on Sat
urdays. Sundays, and holidays (in
cluding Washington's Birthday) from
noon to (> p.m.
A starting time of noon on week
ends is an experiment because last
year there was little response to the
10 a.m. opening, which has been the
| custom in the past.
