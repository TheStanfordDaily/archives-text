# Short-Handed Card Five Heads South to Tangle with Trojans
## Lawler, Brown to Sec Limited Action in Weekend Twin Bill 
### BOB DURAND 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 17—The Tribe ol basketballing India'is
from Stanford arrived hero tonight minus their high-scoiing cen
ter, and with another of their first stringers suffering from ail
injury.
Coach Howie Dallmar's Cards are due to face th© revenge
♦seeking use Trojans tomorrow

and Saturday night in games to be
played at. the Pan-Pacific Audito
rium in downtown Los Angele:;.
Russ Lawler, the tallest man on
the squad, and presently 10th in
Southern Division PCC scorin-.?
stayed home on the Farm today r.
euperating from a flu attack which
sent his temperature soaring to 104
degrees.
According to Dallmar, co-captain
Lawler "should be ready to fly dowi
on Friday, but he will only see lim
ited action in the series."
A BAD BACK
Barry Brown, the second tallest
Indian eager, has been sidelined all
week with a bad back, but should
be ready to start tomorrow night in
the first contest. However, Dallmai
also insists that he will "substitut
freely for Barry."
This leaves the Tribe with thoii
three little men to carry the lotto,
this weekend against a USC team
that will be at full strength and will

be looking for a reversal of its
games played two weeks ago in
which Troy was twice downed by
the Cards.
One of these little men will be tho
factor which directly contributed to
the dov/nfall of Troy that weekend.
And he is none other than 5-11 Rcr:
Tomsic, who is currently topping tl t
Southern Division in point-making.
THE BIG QUESTION
In the USC series two weeks
Tomsic scored 40 and 27 points io
pace the Indians to respective 9?-"t
and 76-60 triumphs over the Tro
jans. The 40 markers constituted a
new conference record for the Oak -
land star, who just couldn't be
stopped that night.
The big question this weekend is
what will Southern Californi i
coach Forrest Twogood have up his
sleeve to try and stop Tomsic?
He can't afford to put too many
men on him, because the other two
little men are just as liable to op< i
up. Both George Selleck, who v; -
the second highest league scorer last
year, and Bill Bond will not hesi
tate to send the ball through the nets
I if left alone for an instant.
The replacements for Lawler and
Brown will be Leo Schwaiger and
Carlos Bea, both of whom have
played considerably as substitutes
this year and have improved a great
deal since the season's start.
Schwaiger proved himself capable
last week when, as a substitute
j against the first-place UCLA Bru-
I ins, he netted 13 points.
The Trojans, meanwhile, will have
their first five ready to go. Dick
Welsh, Chet Carr, Roy Irvin, Tony
Psaultis, and Ralph Pausig will all
be lying in wait to challenge the
Tribe.
The Southerners will also have

the advantage of their home court.
However, this is not the same ad
vantage enjoyed by UCLA. Dall
mar terms the Pan-Pacific a "good"
court, with lots of room and good
lighting.
"We just have to win these
games," says the Card mentor.
When asked if he was counting
Stanford out of the conference race,
he emphatically answered, "Defi
nitely not!"

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 17—The Tribe ol basketballing India'is
from Stanford arrived hero tonight minus their high-scoiing cen

injury.
Coach Howie Dallmar's Cards are due to face th© revenge

and Saturday night in games to be
played at. the Pan-Pacific Audito
rium in downtown Los Angele:;.
Russ Lawler, the tallest man on
the squad, and presently 10th in
Southern Division PCC scorin-.?
stayed home on the Farm today r.
euperating from a flu attack which
sent his temperature soaring to 104
degrees.
According to Dallmar, co-captain
Lawler "should be ready to fly dowi
on Friday, but he will only see lim
ited action in the series."
A BAD BACK
Barry Brown, the second tallest
Indian eager, has been sidelined all
week with a bad back, but should
be ready to start tomorrow night in
the first contest. However, Dallmai
also insists that he will "substitut
freely for Barry."
This leaves the Tribe with thoii
three little men to carry the lotto,

that will be at full strength and will

be looking for a reversal of its
games played two weeks ago in
which Troy was twice downed by
the Cards.
One of these little men will be tho
factor which directly contributed to
the dov/nfall of Troy that weekend.
And he is none other than 5-11 Rcr:
Tomsic, who is currently topping tl t
Southern Division in point-making.
THE BIG QUESTION
In the USC series two weeks
Tomsic scored 40 and 27 points io
pace the Indians to respective 9?-"t
and 76-60 triumphs over the Tro
jans. The 40 markers constituted a
new conference record for the Oak -
land star, who just couldn't be
stopped that night.
The big question this weekend is
what will Southern Californi i
coach Forrest Twogood have up his
sleeve to try and stop Tomsic?
He can't afford to put too many
men on him, because the other two
little men are just as liable to op< i
up. Both George Selleck, who v; -
the second highest league scorer last
year, and Bill Bond will not hesi
tate to send the ball through the nets
I if left alone for an instant.
The replacements for Lawler and
Brown will be Leo Schwaiger and
Carlos Bea, both of whom have
played considerably as substitutes
this year and have improved a great
deal since the season's start.
Schwaiger proved himself capable
last week when, as a substitute
j against the first-place UCLA Bru-
I ins, he netted 13 points.
The Trojans, meanwhile, will have
their first five ready to go. Dick
Welsh, Chet Carr, Roy Irvin, Tony
Psaultis, and Ralph Pausig will all
be lying in wait to challenge the
Tribe.
The Southerners will also have

the advantage of their home court.
However, this is not the same ad
vantage enjoyed by UCLA. Dall
mar terms the Pan-Pacific a "good"
court, with lots of room and good
lighting.
"We just have to win these
games," says the Card mentor.
When asked if he was counting
Stanford out of the conference race,
he emphatically answered, "Defi
nitely not!"
