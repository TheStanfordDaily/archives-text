The ASSU account in the Blood
Bank was opened in February, 1952,
by the Student Health Committee to
have the student needing a transfu
sion the cost of the blood, since the
University does not pay the cost, of
transfusions.
Blood costs $22.50 a pint plus $7.50
for its processing. So long as a bal
ance is maintained in the ASSU ac
count, the student has only to pay
the $7.,50 processing charge.
