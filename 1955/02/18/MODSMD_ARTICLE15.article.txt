# Visiting Consul Cites Greek Opposition to Red Aggression

### JO OLSON 
The foreign policies of Greece, and in particular its stand on tha
Cyprus question, were the topics discussed by John A. Tzouni ,
Greek Consul in San Francisco, in a talk yeserday afternoon l.\
Bowman Alumni House.
"Greece has always stood in the way of would-be world con-

trollers," Tzounis pointed out, "as
it is locatcd at the crossroads of
three continents (Africa, Europe,
and Asia), and is also near the Dar
danelles, which give access to the
Middle East."
For these reasons the Communists
have tried repeatedly, but unsuc
cessfully, to gain control of the
country. <
IN WESTERN CAMP
"The Balkans have Jong been con
sidered the powder keg of Europe,"
he remarked, "but this is not true
now; there is a firmer front in this
region than in other parts of Eu
rope." Of the Greek position he
said, "Today we stand firm in the
Western camp."
A trouble spot has developed,
however, on the island of Cyprus.
The island is now governed as a
British crown colony, but the popu
lation is 82 per cent Greek and has
expressed a desire for union with
Greece.
BASKS NEEDED
One of the main British argu
| monts against giving up sovereignty
of Cyprus is that military bases are
needed there. "The bases are nec
essary and we do want them there,"
Tzounis said, "but Greek feeling is
that sovereignty over the island is
not necessary for the maintenance
of such bases."
tn his opinion, he adrled, Britain
will have to relinquish its hold on
the island sooner or later and work
out arrangements with Greece.
Another British contention is that
the Communist party on Cyprus is
strong and might become a tool of
Russia if the island is released.
