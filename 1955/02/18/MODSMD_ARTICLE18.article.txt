# blood for life ...... an editorial

Thirty minutes of your time this afternoon
could materially defray the cost of life itself
for a Stanford student.
The Peninsula Memorial Blood Bank will be
prepared to receive donations for the ASSU
blood account today from 3 to 7 p.m. at the
Menio Park Recreation Center.
Blood from the ASSU account is used for
transfusions to studenis at processing cost:
57.50 a pint. If there is insufficient blood in the
account, students must pay an additional $22.50
for the blood itself.
Last year one person received a transfusion
of 14 pints of blood from the ASSU account, to

offset the effect of a bleeding ulcer. Had the
condition arisen right now, but two of the neces
sary pints would have been found in the ASSU
account. That person's bill for the very sub
stance of life would have been $375.
Little enough to pay for a human life, per
haps . . . but much too much for any Stanford
student to have to pay when, by going through
a simple-half-hour routine, you could donate
a pint of blood to help him.
Donate blood today, specifying that it is to
go to the ASSU account. It is a small, but ex
tremely significant, gesture for your fellow
man.
