Spring is almost here and young men's
thoughts are lightly turning, etc. But with the
ratio being what il is, some of Stanford's gay
blades don't have anything to turn to.
Following my best procedure of looking out
for the interests of Daily readers, I have come
up with a new solution tc this vexing problem.
The problem of the young gentlemen not hav
ing anything to which to turn.
My ever-diligent agents inform me that down
Menlo way there are some cute li'l creatures
just dying to entertain all red-blooded Stan
ford men.
These dolls will even furnish their visitors
with refreshments. Visits call for a bit of hand
holding, too. And none will be left out, all are
welcomed.
How's that sound as a solution to the ratio
problem? Chow, beverages, and hand-holding
by some of the Peninsula's loveliest ladies.
Before you madly rush off to Menlo: get the
address man, get the address.
It's the Menlo Park Recreation Center. And
the comely young ladies are the nurses who
will be there to take blood donations for the
ASSU account iu the San Mateo County Blood
Bank.

Here is an ideal fulfilled, a chance to soc-it
up with real women, break down that ratio
frustration and, what's of true importance, to
add to Stanford's woefully inadequate emerg
ency blood supply.
At present there are two pints of blood on
hand. Why, one auto accident and the fund
would be gone. A Stanford student hurf in
such an accident and requiring transfusions
would be forced to pay $30 a pint for the neces
sary fluid. With blood on hand at the bank, in
the ASSU fund, the price would be only $7.60,
the cost of processing it.
Could you afford S3O? Not many students
can.
Women students are welcomed too, and I
hear there are some young men at the Bank
to hold their paws also. In fact, if they get short
on handholders, I'll gladly fill the breach, sacri
ficer that I am
That's today, from 3 to 7 p.m. at the Menlo
Park Recreation Center, 501 Laurel St. Cross
the railroad tracks from El Camino
Them nurses are real dolls, believe me.
And you can also believe me in this: your
blood someday will be a fellow student's life
saver.
