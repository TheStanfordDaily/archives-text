WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 Presi
dent Eisenhower's liberalized trade
program squeaked by its fir t House
test with a bare one-vote margin
today after a drama-packed session
in which high-tariff advocates al
most won out.
A nt i c ip a t in g another furious
showdown tomorrow, the While
! House w;is reported working behind
the scenes in an effort to win an
agreement with protectionist Con
gressmen that would satisfy both
fa<;t ions.
At. issue was the so-called "cs-
I cape clause" in the present law
which permits the chief executive to
disregard Tariff Commission recom
' mendations on raising import duties.
