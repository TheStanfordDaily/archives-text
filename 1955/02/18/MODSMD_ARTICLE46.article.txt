# Card 9 Opens Season Against All-Pro Alumni
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
Baseball returns to the Sunken Diamond tomorrow afternoon with a double header. The first
game will be an abbreviated affair starting at 1:45 featuring old timers. At 3 p.m. the boys will get
down to earnes. The 1955 varsity coached by E/erett Dean will do battle with an alumni array
culled from the ranks of the pros.
The varsity beat the alumni last year 2-1, when Jack Shepard overran third base and was tagged

out to squelch a ninth-inning rally,
but this year the grads are even
stronger, while the collegiates at
best are only as strong as last sea
son.
Behind the plate for the Cards
will be Lenny Swartz, who is a
heady receiver, has a good arm, but
has not lived up to his potential as
a hitter. Swartz hit only .200 last
year in a season which saw all the
Cards swing very muted bats.
On the mound is where Stanford's
strength lies. Ray Young, voted the
most valuable player in the CIBA
last*year, is back after a summer of
ball in Oregon where he won 11 and
lost two, with a team that lost two
thirds of its games. Young, Walt
Paine, and Ken Brown will handle
the pitching chores tomorrow. Paine
is a JC transfer, while Brown is a
sidearmer who is either very, very
good or he leaves after walking the
first three men he faces.
INITIAL HASSOCK
Tom Dandurand, who is being
counted on to provide the punch in
Coach Dean's attack, will cover first
base. "DumDum" played third
and right field last spring, but was
a first baseman before coming to
Stanford. Dandurand will split the
duty with Bob Gergen, the foot
baller.
Either Mickey Holzman or Bob
Fletcher will get the call at second

base. Both are rooc! fielders and
pesky hitters, llolzan has a bulge in
experience, but Fletcher was a irosh
.standout last year.
Shortstop will be patrolled by
Rich Scramaglia, .starting his fourth
year as a varsity performer. He
moves oVbr from second to fill the
hoie left by the graduation of War-

ren Goodrich. On the left side of the
infield with him is Rudy Figueroa at
third. Figueroa, also up from the
frQsh, is a real prospect for diamond
stardom. Backing up Rudy is Hal
Messner.
OUTER GARDENS
Bob Evans, Sy Hall, and Gene
Manzer or Bob Gergen will perform
in the outfield tomorrow. Evans y/dl
be spelled by Ron Marciel, a trans
fer from The Citadel, while the
speedy, mighty mite, Hall, will han
dle everything hit his way in center
field. The opening choice in right
is a tossup between Manzer and
Gergen, both frosh last year.
This is a team which has good
pitching, and should jell defensively
into something quite good, but the
hitting is a big question mark. The
Sunken Diamond caters to spray
hiters; nobody is going to powder
those 365-foot fences. And most of
the team are potentially good spray
hitters, but last year the supply
dried up in mid-season and left the
Cards high and dry. Coach Dean
is hoping it's a different story this
year.
All in all, it will be quite a day,
and should go a long way in seeing
just how good tho 1955 horsehiders
are, for they aren't likely to run up
against much stronger opposition at
any time this season.
