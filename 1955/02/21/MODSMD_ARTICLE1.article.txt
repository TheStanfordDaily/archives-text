# Capacity Crowd Hears Clergyman
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
An English clergyman gifted with a captivating wit, a pene
trating personality, and a deep Christian message paid liis sec
ond visit to Stanford last weekend.
Canon Bryan Green, the man who on his week-long mission
to this University last winter attracted some of the largest

audiences in Stanford's history and
inspired a discussion of religioft on
a University-wide level, addressed a
congregation which filled Memorial
Church to capacity yesterday morn
ing on the subject of the individual's
own personal realization of the basic
concepts of Christianity.
Earlier, in a Daily interview, Can
on Green described his visit to Stan
ford as "in retrospect, one of the
happiest visits I have ever paid to
a university."
"On the whole," the Canon said.
"I found that Stanford students are
extraordinarily friendly, and that
the students, as a whole, are very
willing to be responsive to a sincere
message."
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING
"But," he added, a perturbed ex
pression passing over his face, "I
found here a basic lack of under
standing of the fundamentals of
Christianity."
Although he admitted that he was
most happy to see the number of
students turning out for his' talks
and discussions, Canon Green re
marked that he detected a '"tre
mendous lot of shallow thinking
even among those who called them
selves Christians."
This he described in his Sunday
sermon as part of a "wave of religi
osity" or superficial responsiveness
to Christian beliefs which is spread
ing over the country, engulfing those
who let their minds be so filled with
the "buisncss" of life that they leave
no room for spiritual fulfillment.
"The highlight of my visit last
year," Bryan Green had said earlier,
"was the fact that religion was dis
eased all through the campus." The
importance of this, he cmphn.si7.ed,
was not that the problem of the
person's realization ' of his religious
beliefs was solved, hut rather that
this person had come to "face
squarely Christ and his teachings."
COMPARISON
Comparing the religious feelings
of the youth of England to those in
this country, Bryan Green remarked
til at it was a question of quality
versus quantity. In the United
States he found that the number of
church-goers among the young peo
ple was higher in comparison with
the number in England, but that the
intensity of their religious experi
ence is comparatively shallow.
Referring in his Sunday sermon

to the controversy over religion that,
his visit last year brought to the
campus, the canon laughed and said
that he was pleased to see it, for
"the most damning sin of all is com
placency."
Canon Green left yesterday after
noon to fly to Honolulu. Hawaii,
where he will participate in a 14-
day city - wide mission under the
auspices of the Honolulu Council of
Christian Churches. Before coming
to Stanford, he spent two days at
Yale University, which he found
"very congenial (although not as
free and friendly as Stanford)."

the number in England, but that the
intensity of their religious experi
ence is comparatively shallow.
Referring in his Sunday sermon

to the controversy over religion that,
his visit last year brought to the
campus, the canon laughed and said
that he was pleased to see it, for
"the most damning sin of all is com
placency."
Canon Green left yesterday after
noon to fly to Honolulu. Hawaii,
where he will participate in a 14-
day city - wide mission under the
auspices of the Honolulu Council of
Christian Churches. Before coming
to Stanford, he spent two days at
Yale University, which he found
"very congenial (although not as
free and friendly as Stanford)."
An English clergyman gifted with a captivating wit, a pene
trating personality, and a deep Christian message paid liis sec
ond visit to Stanford last weekend.
Canon Bryan Green, the man who on his week-long mission
to this University last winter attracted some of the largest

audiences in Stanford's history and
inspired a discussion of religioft on
a University-wide level, addressed a
congregation which filled Memorial
Church to capacity yesterday morn
ing on the subject of the individual's
own personal realization of the basic
concepts of Christianity.
Earlier, in a Daily interview, Can
on Green described his visit to Stan
ford as "in retrospect, one of the
happiest visits I have ever paid to
a university."
"On the whole," the Canon said.
"I found that Stanford students are
extraordinarily friendly, and that
the students, as a whole, are very
willing to be responsive to a sincere
message."
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING
"But," he added, a perturbed ex
pression passing over his face, "I
found here a basic lack of under
standing of the fundamentals of
Christianity."
Although he admitted that he was
most happy to see the number of
students turning out for his' talks
and discussions, Canon Green re
marked that he detected a '"tre
mendous lot of shallow thinking
even among those who called them
selves Christians."
This he described in his Sunday
sermon as part of a "wave of religi
osity" or superficial responsiveness
to Christian beliefs which is spread
ing over the country, engulfing those
who let their minds be so filled with
the "buisncss" of life that they leave
no room for spiritual fulfillment.
"The highlight of my visit last
year," Bryan Green had said earlier,
"was the fact that religion was dis
eased all through the campus." The
importance of this, he cmphn.si7.ed,
was not that the problem of the
person's realization ' of his religious
beliefs was solved, hut rather that
this person had come to "face
squarely Christ and his teachings."
COMPARISON
Comparing the religious feelings
of the youth of England to those in
this country, Bryan Green remarked
til at it was a question of quality
versus quantity. In the United
States he found that the number of
church-goers among the young peo
ple was higher in comparison with
the number in England, but that the
intensity of their religious experi
ence is comparatively shallow.
