# Trustees to Lease Site For Palo Alto Hospital
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees recent
ly stated that it would lease a
25-acre site for the construction
of a Palo Alto city hospital. The
site would be near the Stanford
Medical School so that both con
cerns could benefit economical
ly by the sharing of facilities
such as laundry, kitchen, etc.
The Board gave its stamp of ap
proval to the proposed 200-bed hos
pital and said that it could expand
to 1,000 beds if it desired. It was
also clarified that Palo Alto would
have full control of any facilities it
constructs on the campus.
Tlie Board's statement does not
mean that Palo Alto will necessarily
accept the site. The people of the
city will have the final say in May.
The city has had consultants in
vestigating various alternatives
such as expanding the present hos
pital just off Palm Drive or building
right next to it. The consultants,
however, have advised against an
expansion plan stating that it would
be too expensive.
While the consultants are study
ing the advisability of a co-opera
tive effort with Stanford, city and
University officials have been inter
viewing hospital architects to set up
a joint-construction program if ev
erything goes through.
City Manager Jerry Kcithley ex
pressed extreme satisfaction with
the Board of Trustees' action.
