# Troy Revenges Card Triumph
## 
### BOB DURAND 
PAN PACIFIC AUDITORIUM, Los Angeles—lt wa3 a rough
weekend for Stanford's basketballers.
An inspired guintet, revengeful of its two losses to the same
team earlier in the season, took advantage of an Indian sguad
hampered by injury and sickness, and scored two convincing
wins, 73-63 and 71-56. ♦

The double loss puts the Tribe in
a second - place tie with Southern
California. UCLA clinched the
Southern Division title by defeating
California twice at Berkeley.
A crowd of 3,000 both nights saw
a Trojan team which was not much
better than when it played at Stan
ford. However, the Indians were
just not up to par.
Only in the first half of Friday's
contest did the Cards show the hus
tle and ability for which they have
been noted this season. At half
time they held a 28-26 lead.
The second half saw SC break
through he weakened Stanford de
fenses time and time again. Satur
day was just a continuation as the
Howie Dallmar-coached Cards could
not keep pace with the determined
men of Troy.
TOMSIC OFF HIS GAME
Sharpshooters Ron Tomsic and
Bill Bond were mainly responsible
for keeping the Indians in the ball
game. However, even they were not
playing their usual game.
Tomsic, although scoring 40 points
in the two tilts, was having passes
intercepted and at most times was
being outhustled by Trojan co-cap
tain Dick Welsh.
The big Bear from Berkeley, Bob
McKeen, went on a scoring splurge
to hit 61 points in the UCLA-Cal
series and thus wrest the division
scoring lead away from Tomsic.
Bond, while playing his usual
steady game, was slowed down by
a flu bug which hit him just before
the weekend. The Long Beach soph
omore netted 29 markers over the
weekend.
Card co-captain Russ Lawler, who
on Wednesday came down with a
bad case oi flu, played a goood game
in Friday night's first half. How
ever, the second half and Saturday
night saw him too tired to be ef
fective.
The big.center garnered but 14
points, eight of which came before
the intermission Friday night.
SELLECK INJURED
Perhaps the blow which hurt the
Indians most Saturday was the loss

of George Selleck. Selleck, who
takes the role of playmaker, strained
a knee cartilage late in the first
game and did not even suit up. The
little guard racked up 11 markers
Friday night.
Barry Brown, Tribe forward, who
had been hindered with an old back
injury and a weak ankle, blew hot
and cold. At times, he was out-re
bounding the whole USC team, and
a few minutes later, he couldn't do
anything right.
Six-foot-five Leo Schwaigcr start
ed Saturday's contest, besides play
ing a considerable amount of time
Friday night. He proved a capable
substitute and did his share of re
bounding and scoring.
WAGNERS FILL IN
The two Wagners, Hap and Ron
filled in alternately for Selleck Sat
urday and added a new spark to the
Card defense, but were not able to
help the offense.
A generous collection of Stanford
alumni and students present Satur
day were almost, ready to give u{
completely in the early part of the
second half when Tomsic collided
with Trojan Chet Carr and came up
holding his bad knee. However, the
5-11 guard was back in action a few
minutes later.
The Southern Californians did no
change their style of play much 112: on
hen they dropped two at St" d
I'.rhsp the only change w ~ en
ter Roy Irvin.
Irvine was completely bottled up
at Stanford, but this weekend hi.
famed hook shot was deadly. Friday
night he dunked 22 points, while
Saturday he sank nine.
Welsh, always a threat to any
team, was the biggest factor in the
two Trojan victories.
It was Welsh who kept the home
team from going too fast. It wa;
Welsh who set up the offense. An.
it was Welsh who paced the defen e
Percentage - wise, the Troymer,
were also tops. They hit a 44 and
42 per cent field goal average in the
two contests, while the usually ac
curate Indians hit only 33 and 3£
per cent.
