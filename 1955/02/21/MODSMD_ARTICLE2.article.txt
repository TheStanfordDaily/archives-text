Compiled from Dispatches of Ihe United Press

WASHINGTON. Feb. 20 â€”Presi-
dent Eisenhower's program for rid
ding the government of security
risks came under attack on three
fronts today with a member of the
Subversive Activities Control Board
leading the criticism.
Former GOP Senator Harry P.
Cain, named to the board by Mr.
Eisenhower, said the program has
"swung too far on the side of in
justice." He especially criticized as
"too harsh and difficult of reason
able administration" a key part of
the President's 1953 order setting up
the program.
Cain, noting that World War II
ended 10 years ago, said lie is happy
to sec the postwar decade ended.
During that time, he said, "preju
dice and intolerance" ruled too
many American lives because of
"fear of the unknown," including
Russia and Communism.
At the same time, Representative

Martin Dies (D., Tex.), one-time
chairman of the House Un-Ameri
ciin Activities Committee, charged
that the program had been "badly
handled." He urged "rigid" adher
ence to the "Americnn standards of
justice and fair play."
