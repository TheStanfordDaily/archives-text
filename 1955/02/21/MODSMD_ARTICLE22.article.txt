# campus opinion
## daily policy

To the Editor:
Contrary to the letter of last Thursday I believe
that The Stanford Daily deserves a vote of confi
dence. The two writers complained that The Daily
was not publishing enough stories of! the wire serv
ice, apparently that it was trying to completely iso
late the campus from the rest of the world. Respect
fully, I am not certain The Daily has such a great
influence. It wouid seem that the mediums of radio,
television, and newspapers of San Francisco and
elsewhere, which ar > sold on campus and delivered
to most, if not all, living groups, must slip the news
of the outer world through the ivory curtain around
the campus. On the contrary, it would seem that The
Daily is recognizing this, and at last fulfilling its true

need on the campus. This need is to keep the stu
dents and faculty alert to what is occurring on cam
pus.
There is no question but thai the international
news is of the utmost importance to all of us, but I
consider The Daily's publishing ol Intements by
Stanford professors, truly experts in their fields, on
world events gives us information unreached by
other sources. If we want more news on an inter
national item we can find it via the radio or TV set,
or the city newspapers. To those student; who are
beyond the touch of modern communication, I sug
gest the complete usage of the periodical reading
room in the Main Library.
