# 'Toko-Ri’ Called ‘Clear, Succinct'
## 
### TOM ARP 
James A. Michener's novelette "The Bridges at Toko-Ri" was
a fairly successful book, with enough "action" to make it attrac
tive for the movie industry. The most surprising thing about the
film is that Mr. Michener's attitude (at least I presume that it is
his) is presented clearly and succinctly.
The film is competently done from any technical point of view,

and, except for a slight excess of
melodramatic machinery, is without
most of the cliches associated with
war movies.
It is fortunate that two of the
stars need act only to the extent of

looking tense and
strained: William
Hoi den handles
the job nicely,
and Grace Kelly
manages to look
attractive despite
her acting. Fred
eric March has a
slightly more

complex assignment, and affirms the
opinion that he is a fine film actor.
Mickey Rooney, type-cast as ever,
makes it obvious that his role as a
distinct personality is superfluous.
•LAWYER FROM DENVER'
The story involves a "lawyer from
Denver" who was recalled into the
Navy to fly a jet in Korea; he has
a wife and two small daughters, and
every rational right to have re
mained a civilian. Without being
able to detect a reason for it, Lieu
tenant Harry Brubaker (played by
Mr. Holden) fights as he is told, and
there are few external signs of dis
content.
But' when his wife (Miss Kelly")
and children arrive in Tokyo his
position becomes clear to him: lie
is lighting someone else's war in
.someone else's country, and in do
ing so he is jeopardizing both his
own life and the security of his fam
ily-
He gets little consolation from the
admiral (Mr. March) who lost two
sons and saw his wife's mind break
during the war—the Second Great
War. The admiral is a hard, bitter
man who is just sentimental enough
to identify Brubaker with one of his
own sons, and who exercises the
privilege of superior rank to display
his paternal interest .
ADMIRAL'S ADVICE
Ilis advice: fight the war you are
given; no one likes war, but no one
can escape it; you, Harry Brubaker
or any other man, have no more
privileges than society is willing to
grant you. He, in brief, represents
an attitude of sentimental pessi
mism—an ignorance of the general
concept of war and a sensitive per
ception of its effects upon the indi
vidual, which, when combined, pro
duce a sympathy i'or the individual
(Brubaker) and a determination to
see that the war is fought properly.
His intellectual conflict is morbidly
fascinating but philosophically
alarming.

Anil, because of what happens to
Lieutenant Brubaker, we are forced
to presume that Mr. Michener's at
titude is not far from this. He can
sec? the futility of such a war, anil
can see too that its resulting strain
upon the man involved in it is over
whelming; but he is apparently un
able to grasp the meaning, the rea
son, for the war.
He should, 1 suppose, condemn it
altogether but for some vague intui
tion about patriotism or some deep
seated notion about protecting the
freedom of society.
TYPICAL ATTITUDE
"The Bridges at Toko-Ri" is im
portant, but not because of its tech
nical correctness. It is important
because it displays an attitude which
is too typical. Certainly the individ
ual loses in any war like this, and
just as certainly there are funda
mental ideas about freedom which
coincide with the doctrinal precepts
of this country; but in making these
the forces ruling his two main char
acters, and presenting these men in
a state of mental conflict because of
it, Mr. Michener betrays his pur
pore.
It is a sad story, but it Ls not a
tragic one. There is too much wrong
with his heroes from the start —or
rather, there is too large a defect in
each: they are not very intelligent,
and Mr. Michener has no right to
make them his philosophers. He can
use them only to tell a story of
pointlessness. His lesson for today:
war destroys a man's individuality,
his nobility, and his life—but damn
the torpedoes, full speed ahead!
