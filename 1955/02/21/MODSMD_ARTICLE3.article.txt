PARIS â€” Radical Socialist Edgar
Faurc today promised to push for
ratification of the German rearma
ment treeatics and quick home rule
for Tunisia in a bid to win French
political support as the nation's 21st
post-war premier.
The 46-year-old Faurc received a
promise of support from right-wing
factions which observers said gave
him a better chance of forming a
new government than the three men
who have tried and failed in the
past 1(> days.
Faure, who was foreign minister
in the outgoing government of Pre
mier Pierre Mondcs - France, con
sulted at the Foreign Office
throughout, today with political lead
ers in an attempt to determine
whether he has sufficient political
strength to establish a new govern
ment.
