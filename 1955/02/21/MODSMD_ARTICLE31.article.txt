# Pro Stars Topple Indians With Fourth-Inning Rally
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
The "Nine Old Men" alumni baseball team took the varsity into
camp at the Sunken Diamond Saturday by a 7-1 score. The
collegiates made a contest of it until the fourth inning when the
pros took command by scoring four tallies.
Stanford did not look too smooth, either in the field or at bat,

but they appeared to have the mak
ings of a good team. Several indi
viduals looked very sharp — Rudy
Figueroa cracked out two hits, Len
Swartz played an outstanding game
behincT"*tTie plate, and Sid Hall's
throwing and the pitching supplied
by Ray Young and Walt Payne were
excellent.
The afUms scored in the first in
ning, when with one out, Warren
Goodrich singled, and Lloyd Merri
man of the White Sox lined a one
baser to right, with Goodie moving
to third. Then with Dave Melton of
the Seals at bat, they tried the
double steal. Mickey Holzman's re
turn throw to Swartz covering home
was true and Goodrich was an easy
out.
Melton singled to center, though,
and M e r r i m a n came steaming
around from second for the run.

With Jack Shepard at bat, Melton
was thrown out, Swartz to Holzman,
to end the inning. •
PROS' SCORE
In the second, the varsity capital
ized on two hits to score their lone
counter of the day. Rudy Figueroa
hit in the hole between third and
short and beat it out for a single.
Tom Dandurand and Bob Evans
added nothing, as they both took
called third strikes, but Len Swartz
lined the ball to left center, where
it was bobbled momentarily by Ray
Swarts. Figueroa trudged around
third and headed home. Shepard had
the plate blocked but the throw got
through him for an error and the
apple - cheeked Figueroa was in
safely.
The fourth innjng saw Ray Young
take his lumps. It wasn't his fault
th'ough, as faulty fielding was in
large part responsible. Shepard
opened the frame with a single,
went to second on a passed ball, and
moved to third when Swartz was
safe on an error at third by Figue
roa. Dick Clegg forced Swartz,
Shepard holding, but Bill Alhouse
walked to load the bases. Dave
Dahle's attempted squeeze failed

when Young scooped the ball up and
threw to Swartz for a force on the
incoming Shepard.
The inning should have been over
on the next play, but Rich Scrama
glia, after making a beautiful stop
of Ait Abrahamson's grounder back
of second, threw too hard to Holz
man who couldn't hang onto the pill.
Then two singles brought in four
runs.
YOUNG IMPRESSIVE
Young worked a very creditable
five innings and contributed a
double and a single at the plate, be
fore giving way to Walt Payne, who
twirled the last four innings. Payne
gave up the final two counters in the
sixth.
The Stanfords didn't look too
good, but the areas where they
looked poorest can be improved
upon with time. Scramaglia and
Holzman, working together at the
keystone combination, need to ad
just to each other; the hitting was
also weak, but that always comes
along later than the pitching.
For the alumni, Lloyd Merriman
of the Chicago White Sox, holding
a bat for the first time since Sep
tember, cracked out three singles in
four trips and drew a walk, as well
as playing beautifully in the out
field, while Dave Melton of the San
Francisco Seals had three RBl's and
two singles and also sparkled de
fensively, while Jack Shepard of
the Pittsburgh Pirates a pair of
one-basers. Bob Murphy of Oak
land pitched the three stanzas
for the grads, and struck out nine.
He walked a few though.
