# Barclay: Republicans Hope Eisenhower Will Run Again
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
California's selection as the state for the Republican National
Convention in 1956 seems to indicate that Republican leaders
"hope and expect President Eisenhower to run for reelection,"
Professor Thomas S. Barclay of the political science department
said in a recent interview.
In addition to this, Dr. Barclay said that "the choice of San

Francisco, is a recognition, in part,
of the growing importance of Cali
fornia in the American political
scene."
If Eisenhower chooses to run
again, Barclay feels that it is "quite
certain that he will be renominated
by acclamation and that his wishes
will be carried out both in the plat
form and in the selection of the
Vice-Presidential candidate." Add
ing that the administration forces
usually dominated a national con
vention, he said that "it would be
very unusual for the existing leader
ship to be ignored or repudiated,
without demoralizing party unity
and spirit.
"If the 19r»f> nominees arc Eisen
hower and Nixon," the political sci
ence professor predicted, "the busi
ness of the convention will be some
what routine and formal."
"OPEN" CONVENTION
"But," he went on to say, "if Ei
senhower is not again a candidate
for the Presidency, the convention
becomes art 'open' one, with the
struggle for power between the two

elements in the Republican party."
Looking to Vice-President Nixon
Senate Minority Leader William
Knowland as the two possible
choices if Eisenhower docs not
choose to run again, Barclay pre
sumes that they will both be "very
receptive," and that a struggle be
tween them is not unlikely, assum
ing the President desires to retire
from public life."
DEMO CHOICES
Turning to the other side of the
picture, he said that "Democratic
policy might well rest upon the de
cisions made by the Republicans. If
the Democratic leaders are con
vinced that the President's popular
ity and record will result in his re
election. it is probable that the sup
porters of Adlai E. Stevenson would
not press his candidacy until 1960."
"Stevenson," Barclay stated,
"could run for United States Sena
tor or seek a second term as Gov
ernor of Illinois."
BASIC ISSUES
As to the question of the basic
issues in the 1956 campaign, Bar
clay speculated that "peace and
prosperity" will rank as the two top
issues. "If the American people are
convinced that these two objectives
are being achieved by the Eisen
hower administration, it will be a
formidable task to defeat the Presi
dent. in 1956."
Barclay, an expert in the field of
politics and political parties, has
served as a delegate to one national
convention and an alternate dele
gate to two others. He was assistant
to the chairman of the Democratic
National Convention in 1940 and was
technical adviser to the California
delegation in 1952. He has served
for 18 years as a member of the
county central committee of the
Democratic party.
Barclay has taught courses in the
field of politics, political parties, and
legislation at Stanford since 1927.

will be carried out both in the plat
form and in the selection of the
Vice-Presidential candidate." Add
ing that the administration forces
usually dominated a national con
vention, he said that "it would be
very unusual for the existing leader
ship to be ignored or repudiated,
without demoralizing party unity
and spirit.
"If the 19r»f> nominees arc Eisen
hower and Nixon," the political sci
ence professor predicted, "the busi
ness of the convention will be some
what routine and formal."
"OPEN" CONVENTION
"But," he went on to say, "if Ei
senhower is not again a candidate
for the Presidency, the convention
becomes art 'open' one, with the
struggle for power between the two

elements in the Republican party."
Looking to Vice-President Nixon
Senate Minority Leader William
Knowland as the two possible
choices if Eisenhower docs not
choose to run again, Barclay pre
sumes that they will both be "very
receptive," and that a struggle be
tween them is not unlikely, assum
ing the President desires to retire
from public life."
DEMO CHOICES
Turning to the other side of the
picture, he said that "Democratic
policy might well rest upon the de
cisions made by the Republicans. If
the Democratic leaders are con
vinced that the President's popular
ity and record will result in his re
election. it is probable that the sup
porters of Adlai E. Stevenson would
not press his candidacy until 1960."
"Stevenson," Barclay stated,
"could run for United States Sena
tor or seek a second term as Gov
ernor of Illinois."
BASIC ISSUES
As to the question of the basic
issues in the 1956 campaign, Bar
clay speculated that "peace and
prosperity" will rank as the two top
issues. "If the American people are
convinced that these two objectives
are being achieved by the Eisen
hower administration, it will be a
formidable task to defeat the Presi
dent. in 1956."
Barclay, an expert in the field of
politics and political parties, has
served as a delegate to one national
convention and an alternate dele
gate to two others. He was assistant
to the chairman of the Democratic
National Convention in 1940 and was
technical adviser to the California
delegation in 1952. He has served
for 18 years as a member of the
county central committee of the
Democratic party.
Barclay has taught courses in the
field of politics, political parties, and
legislation at Stanford since 1927.
California's selection as the state for the Republican National
Convention in 1956 seems to indicate that Republican leaders
"hope and expect President Eisenhower to run for reelection,"
Professor Thomas S. Barclay of the political science department
said in a recent interview.
In addition to this, Dr. Barclay said that "the choice of San

Francisco, is a recognition, in part,
of the growing importance of Cali
fornia in the American political
scene."
If Eisenhower chooses to run
again, Barclay feels that it is "quite
certain that he will be renominated
by acclamation and that his wishes
will be carried out both in the plat
form and in the selection of the
Vice-Presidential candidate." Add
ing that the administration forces
usually dominated a national con
