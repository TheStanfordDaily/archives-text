Excom will push ahead with discussions of
the proposed new ASSU Constitution under a
revised agenda format tonight. For various
reasons, major items of business v/ill be dis
cussed early ;n the meeting, v/ith routine re
ports held up until 10 p.m.
i * *
First item of business tonight, at 7:30, will be
another report from Ann Irvine's Special Honor
Code Subcommittee. The subcommittee has
been working closely with Fundamental Stand
aid Committee on education methods for the
recent Code clarifications, and the two groups
v/ill meet this afternoon to give Miss Irvine
something concrete to take to Excom tonight.
On the agenda at 7:45 is continued discus
sion of the Cabinet under the proposed Con
stitution. Should discussion on this topic be
completed - and ASSU President Pete Bing ex
pects it will be - • the Excom discussion will
pass on to the question of a student manager
setup under the revision.
As proposed by Harrison Schmidt's com
mittee which drew up the draft Constitution

being used as a basis for discussions, the
functions now handled by the student mana
ger would be entrusted in part to a policy
making, presidentially appointed Executive
Secretary, while more mundane matters such
as paper work and handling the funds would
be entrusted to a salaried Controller. The Con
troller under this system would have no hand
in policy decisions, but would be a sort of cash
ier for ASSU funds.
Excom officers will confer today with Dean
of Students H. Donald Winbigler, who is finan
cial manager of ASSU, and go over with him
the alternatives of the situation. The principal
alternative k> Schmidt's plan would probably
be retaining a student - manager mechanism
similar to that in use now.
The graduate students have decided that
they would rather have Steve Voykovich rep
resent them on Excom and attend meetings as
often as possible than have him withdraw in
favor of anyone else. Voykovich hopes to ease
his burden of other commitments and attend
Excom meetings regularly (see letter below).
