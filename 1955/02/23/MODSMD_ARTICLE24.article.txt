To the Editor:
Wil.fi regard to the Daily article of Feb. 18, 1U55,
headlined "Excom Asks Voykovitch (sic) Resigna
tion," .-onio correction and clarification is in order.
At the beginning of winter quarter, Steve ex
plained that du ■ to other commitments he would be
unable to attend the Excom meetings regularly. Me
planned to .send a substitute from the Graduate Stu
dents' Association to those meetings from which he
would be absent. At that time he was told that as
long as his constituents were satisfied, there was
certainly no objection from Excom.
La: t Wednesday afternoon, Carolyn Mesick, who
had been attending meetings in Steve's place, told us
that Betty Bi l low, the other graduate representa
tive. W'lild be unable to attend further meetings this
i.jt.i; ' it id pos ihly in the spring as well. Such a
if 1 It I't graduates without a single vote in
the formulation of the new constitution.
At i'n" m-iting of the Executive Committee that
niyht, we felt that I'xcom as a whole was concerned
with the problem only in so far as the graduate
members were satisfying their constituents and were
adequately representing the graduate viewpoint in
the constitutional-revision discussion. It was pointed
out that the graduates could send as many people as
they wished to represent their views in the discus
ions, but the graduate representative present said
that they might, desire to have the votes, as well.
There was only one constitutionally legal way by
which they could gain full voting privileges in the
absence of both Voykovich and Miss Bigelow. This
would be for Stove to resign and have his position
filled bv presidential appointment until the end of
his term of oll'uv. Since Betty had attended for over
half the quarter, it was possible, according to Ar
ticle I, Section 5, of the ASSU By-Laws, for a presi
dentially appointed substitute to have her vote for
the remainder of the quarter, without her resigna
tion.
With this in mind, the motion was made that the
ASSU president suggest the resignation of Voyko

vicli, unci the temporary replacement of Miss Bige-
Jow.
At the present time, Steve feels that his conflicts
are diminishing, and he will therefore retain his seat
on Excom. Betty has been replaced by Vic Pori/ky
for the remainder of the quarter. Thus the graduates
will not only be adequately represented, but will
have full voting privileges as well.
Thank you very much.

There was only one constitutionally legal way by
which they could gain full voting privileges in the
absence of both Voykovich and Miss Bigelow. This
would be for Stove to resign and have his position
filled bv presidential appointment until the end of
his term of oll'uv. Since Betty had attended for over
half the quarter, it was possible, according to Ar
ticle I, Section 5, of the ASSU By-Laws, for a presi
dentially appointed substitute to have her vote for
the remainder of the quarter, without her resigna
tion.
With this in mind, the motion was made that the
ASSU president suggest the resignation of Voyko

vicli, unci the temporary replacement of Miss Bige-
Jow.
At the present time, Steve feels that his conflicts
are diminishing, and he will therefore retain his seat
on Excom. Betty has been replaced by Vic Pori/ky
for the remainder of the quarter. Thus the graduates
will not only be adequately represented, but will
have full voting privileges as well.
Thank you very much.

At the beginning of winter quarter, Steve ex
plained that du ■ to other commitments he would be
unable to attend the Excom meetings regularly. Me
planned to .send a substitute from the Graduate Stu
dents' Association to those meetings from which he
would be absent. At that time he was told that as
long as his constituents were satisfied, there was
certainly no objection from Excom.
La: t Wednesday afternoon, Carolyn Mesick, who
had been attending meetings in Steve's place, told us
that Betty Bi l low, the other graduate representa
tive. W'lild be unable to attend further meetings this
i.jt.i; ' it id pos ihly in the spring as well. Such a

At i'n" m-iting of the Executive Committee that
niyht, we felt that I'xcom as a whole was concerned
with the problem only in so far as the graduate
members were satisfying their constituents and were
adequately representing the graduate viewpoint in
the constitutional-revision discussion. It was pointed
out that the graduates could send as many people as
they wished to represent their views in the discus
ions, but the graduate representative present said
that they might, desire to have the votes, as well.
