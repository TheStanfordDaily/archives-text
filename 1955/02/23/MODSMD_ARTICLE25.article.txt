To the Editor:
There are those of us who become slightly nause
ated when we hear (and frequently read in The
Daily) people complaining about "Nixon's vicious
attacks" on some of the better-known Democrats.
'1 hese are the same people whose theme in 19-18 was
"Give 'em hell, Harry" but now that someone dares
to give Harry hell, they scream dirty politics.
He has effectively pointed to the facts that the
past Democratic administrations lacked an under
standing of the dangers of the Communist conspir
acy. By their lack of vigilance and their "red her
ring" attitude they were guilty of betraying the trust
which had been placed in them. It is a matter of
record that Nixon was chiefly responsible for thwart
ing the Justice Department in their efforts to hush
up the Hiss affair by attempting to prosecute the
chief witness against Hiss. There are some who will
never forgive him for this, but for which we should
all be grateful. It is foolish to dismiss his efforts as
a mere political maneuver on his part, since at the
time it wasn't particularly popular to be anti-Com
munist.
In the next two years, he will be one of the main
targets of the Democratic smears but it is well to
remember that it is because he has continually and
effectively hit them where it hurts.
