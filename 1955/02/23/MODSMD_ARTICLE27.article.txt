# Student and Faculty Problems Are Aired
## 
### DOROTHY CAMPBELL 
"Attitudes on student-faculty
relations vary from individual to
individual and even from de
partment to department. Opin
ions of professors on student
faculty relations and how they
can best be achieved vary as
much as those of the students."
These were the conclusions of
Student - Faculty Committee mem
bers who recently interviewed pro
fessors on the subject.
"The only trouble with student
faculty relations is that students
don't come to see us. 1 announce
my office hours in class and post
them on the door. Then I sit there
and nobody comes," said one profes
sor.
A lower division student said, "If
I go to see a professor, right away
he manages to give me the feeling,
'I'm busy, so state your business
and beat it.' He doesn't want to sit
around and shoot the breeze. So I
don't go unless I have a definite
reason."
A professor said, "I don't enjoy
seeing students lined up outside my
door waiting to see me, and I don't
like to cut each one short. But I
keep more than minimum office
hours as it is, and my responsibili
ties are heavy. I can't help it."
Another professor said, "Nine out
of ten students who come in want to
ask about examinations or grades.
The other one comes out of intel
lectual interest in the subject. I'll
always have time for students like
him—but there aren't many."
GRADUATES SATISFIED
The graduate students seemed to
be the most satisfied with their rela
tions to their professors.
One graduate student remarked,
"As far as I'm concerned, I get a lot
out of my contacts with professors.
Several of them have invited small
groups of us to their homes and I
feel I know them very well."
The association of students and
professors in departmental clubs or
honor societies was found to be a
.satisfactory solution which both
groups enjoy. Departmental clubs
arrange contact outside of lectures
and classes. Some professors, how
ever, do not, feel it is desirable to
compete with extra-curricular ac
tivities.
OPINIONS DIFFER
In one department where forms
are passed out by the honor society
so students can rate professors and
their courses, the professors voted
unanimously to thank the students
for this service. "How else can we
know in what aueas we can improve
our teaching?" asked a professor
from that department.
How opinions differed throughout
the faculty is .shown by another pro

lessor who said, "Off the record, I
think some of us tend to forget that
students are people. Perhaps good
relations between student and teach
er are an important part of teaching.
We like to think that at the college
level, a knowledge of the subject
matter is all that is necessary."
The strong differences of opinion
shown by students and professors
alike seemed to imply that the kinds
of associations between them that,
are not desirable are matters of in
dividual preference. There should
be ample opportunity, but no coer
cion.
SOCIAL MEETINGS
A student summed it up. "Some
professors would like to know us
socially. Those students who iWI
the same way can get together with
them. Other professors stress more
intellectual associations. Very well,
the students who would enjoy de
partmental clubs can join with
them."
Members of the Student-Faculty
Committee are working out ways of
implementing some of the many
suggestions received from students
and faculty both. One of the proj
ects the committee is planning is
student-faculty dessert get-togeth
ers.
"A great deal has already been
accomplished by the committee,"
student chairman Liz Livadary has
commented.
