## 
### LARRY JENSEN 
The Stanford Braves hung on grimly in the second hall to stave !
off repeated Menlo JC rallies and finally outlasted the JC boys, ;
63-58, in the Pavilion Monday night.
Both teams had cold shooting irons in the first half. The Braves j
rushed off to a 15-8 lead in the first 10 minutes of the game as they j

â–º held Menlo to a mere two field goals.
The JCers bounced back witn
I three quick fielders to narrow the
j gap to one point but this was as
i close as Menlo came as they once
j again lapsed into a field-goal drought
that lasted until the end of the half.
: The Braves managed to connect
i three times from the floor and five
! times from the free throw line and
| lolled up a 2G-20 half-time lead.
ISAACS HOT
Carl Isaacs sparked a Brave rally 1
in the second half that lengthened i
the Brave lead to 10 points at 36-28. 1
After an exchange of buckets Menlo \
began to get hot and pulled up to j

within two points of the JV's at
-JG-44. Bob Milton then pulled the
Braves oat of this jam with a driv
ing lay-in and then Dave Dunn hit a
jump shot to further increase the
Stanford margin.
From this point until the final
whistle, the two teams traded bas
kets. Dunn and Gunnar ChrLstensen
hit clutch points for the Braves
while Mike Preseau kept Menlo in
the game with .some fancy jump
shots.
