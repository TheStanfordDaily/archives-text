The U.S. Pan - American Gaines
swimming team splashed out a 46-29
win over the Stanford team last Sat
urday in a meet held at the Stanford
pool. The real excitement of the
day, however, was the world record
set in the 150-yard medley relay by
the Pan-Am swimmers.
The trio of Bernie Kahn, Bud
Baarke, and Don Hill swam the 50-
yard legs in backstroke, breast
stroke, and freestyle respectively in
a total time of 1:14.1 to break the
old mark of 1:16.4 set last year by
the University of North Carolina.
The only Stanford winners were
Larry Heim in the individual med
ley, Cole Wilbur in the 200-yard
freestyle, and Jerry Weisser in the
200-yard backstroke.
