ritory again, anxious to close the
gap, but their kick expert. Jim
"Rabbit" Bradshaw, just couldn't hit
on three penalty kick attempts.
With 25 minutes gone, the Cards
got control and pushed into Olympic
ground. Ron Bush got the ball on
the Greeks' 40, scooted down the
sideline, crossed to the center of the
field at the 20, and crossed over to
score. Atkinson added two extra
points and the Indians had it wrap
ped up at 11-0.
