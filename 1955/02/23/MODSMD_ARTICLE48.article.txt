# Summer Work Program Begun
## 
### 
For the second year in a row, stu
dents in the Stanford Graduate
School of Business are launching an
organized program for securing
summer jobs.
Encouraged by the success of last
summer's operation, they are send
ing brochures to Western compa
nies telling of the qualifications of
the 100 or more students who will
be available from the middle of
June to the middle of September.
Last year the program placed men
in a wide variety of occupations, in
cluding sales, accounting, market re
search, personnel, and similar posts.
Participants are students who have !
completed the first year of Stan- j
ford's two - year graduate course in '
business.
"The program has a two-way ad- j
vantage," Ross Thompson, student
chairman, points out. "It gives the
employee valuable experience and
at the same time gives the company
a chance, without, commitment, to
observe the man as a possible per
manent employee when he gradu
ates."
Further information may be ob
tained from the Summer Employ
ment Committee, in care of James
Johnson, Placement Service.
