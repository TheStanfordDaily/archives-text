### 
A general outline of the goals
of undergraduate education at

r l he study lias as its purpose the
systematic investigation oi "what,
appear to be the important prob
lems of undergraduate education, in
order to provide a basis for the fur
ther improvement of the Univer
sity's program in this area."
Determining the goals is one of
the preliminary stops toward con
sideration of .specific problems. J)r.
Donald W. Taylor, director of the
study, called it. one of the "working
papers." lie elaborated, "The state
ment. of goals is brief and necessarily
somewhat general. The meaning and
implications will become clear in
detail only as the work of the Ex
ecutive and Advisory Committees
! proceeds during the remainder of
I the study."

The study's goals read:
"Undergraduate e d u c a t i o n at
Stanford is directed toward certain
goals common to all students. The
general purpose is not their attain
; men I. in four years, but their estab
i lishment. as goals toward which the
individual will continue to .strive
I throughout life." In brief, these goals
are:
Fir I, to achieve a breadth of
knowledge of our cultural heritage,
i n c 1 u ding understanding of the
physical and biological world, un
derstanding of human behavior, un
derstanding of the humanities.
Armr;v u k noWLJEIK\E
Secondly, to achieve a depth of
knowledge in preparation for pro
fessional work after graduation, en
hance to graduate or professional
schools, careers in business, indus
try, or government, and intensive
development of intellectual inter-
I ests and abilities, whether or not in
preparation for any career.
Thirdly, to develop interests and
I abilities, and clarify values; increase
skill in the use of the English lan
guage, to develop esthetic sensitivi
ties. clarify a system of values, and
to learn to think more effectively.
The final paragraphs of the goals
report read:
"True breadth and depth of
knowledge involves .not. only the at
tainment. of knowledge in specific
areas, but also the understanding of
the interrelations within and among
J such areas together with an aware
j ness of the relevance of such knowl
j edge to the contemporary scene.
The achievement both of breadth
and of depth should result in the
development of abilities and con
tinuing intellectual interests.
"Stanford seeks to prepare young 1
men and women for satisfying and
useful lives, and especially for rc
j sponsible leadership in their com
; munilies, in business, government,
j the professions, whatever their life
I work may be."

The study's goals read:
"Undergraduate e d u c a t i o n at
Stanford is directed toward certain
goals common to all students. The
general purpose is not their attain
; men I. in four years, but their estab
i lishment. as goals toward which the
individual will continue to .strive
I throughout life." In brief, these goals
are:
Fir I, to achieve a breadth of
knowledge of our cultural heritage,
i n c 1 u ding understanding of the
physical and biological world, un
derstanding of human behavior, un
derstanding of the humanities.
