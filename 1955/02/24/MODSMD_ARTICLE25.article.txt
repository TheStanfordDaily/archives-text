The University oi Washington is in the mid
dle of a "blooming controversy" over a de
cision by the university president, Dr. Henry
Schmitz, to ban Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer
from appearing in a series of lectures on the
campus.
The college paper, the University of Wash
ington Daily, reported over the last few days a
series of incidents beginning with an outpour
ing of letters protesting the president's decision
and a request for reconsideration by the
campus Organizations Assembly, and culmi
nating with the hanging of the president in
effigy , a "Quad tree" and a proposed march
on Washington State Legislature to "force"
the president into reversing his stand on the
issue.
Dr. Schmitz, the Daily reported, gave as his
reason for the ban, the-statement that "bring
ing Dr. Oppenheimer here at this time would
not be in the best interests of the University."
Almost immediately, the Daily announced a
"flood" of letters from students, faculty, and
Seattle citizens who questioned, protested, and
occasionally denounced the decision as a "re
pudiation of the mission of higher education,"
"a direct violation of ... a fundamental of
democracy, intellectual freedom," and "a typi
cal example of tendencies to judge a scientist
a brilliant scientist who would speak only on
.science -by his politics."
Some letters suggested that Dr. Schmitz' de
cision was due to the fact that a bill tor (Jui

versity funds was before the State Legislature
and that the president "feared their opinion"
on the subject "more than public sentiment."
The letters deplored a world where "we can
not always carry the banner of principles and
overlook the dirty dollar."
The president was requested to reconsider
his decision in the light of the campus protest,
according to the Daily, but refused to change
his stand. Protest increased and in the midst
of it all, a new debate arose as to whether the
Daily was giving a "fair and unbiased account
of the proceedings."
Letters complained that "no attempt is be
ing made to elicit any statements in favor of
Dr. Schmitz' stand on the Oppenheimer case."
These, the Daily replied to by saying that "pro
fessors and students seem unwilling to give
statements to be printed in favor of the presi
dent."
The last information received here about the
issue was the aforementioned hanging of the
president in effigy and plans for a student
march on the Legislature to force the issue.
These were denounced in a Daily column as
"conduct unbecoming a college student, and
an infantile means of expressing displeasure."
The paper reported angrily in a front-page
story that the university president was not "go
ing back" on statements made in his inaugural
address regarding academic freedom, and "we
huve the word of a university president to
prove it!"

The last information received here about the
issue was the aforementioned hanging of the
president in effigy and plans for a student
march on the Legislature to force the issue.
These were denounced in a Daily column as
"conduct unbecoming a college student, and
an infantile means of expressing displeasure."
The paper reported angrily in a front-page
story that the university president was not "go
ing back" on statements made in his inaugural
address regarding academic freedom, and "we
huve the word of a university president to
prove it!"
The University oi Washington is in the mid
dle of a "blooming controversy" over a de
cision by the university president, Dr. Henry
Schmitz, to ban Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer
from appearing in a series of lectures on the
campus.
The college paper, the University of Wash
ington Daily, reported over the last few days a
series of incidents beginning with an outpour
ing of letters protesting the president's decision
and a request for reconsideration by the
campus Organizations Assembly, and culmi
nating with the hanging of the president in
effigy , a "Quad tree" and a proposed march
on Washington State Legislature to "force"
the president into reversing his stand on the
issue.
Dr. Schmitz, the Daily reported, gave as his
reason for the ban, the-statement that "bring
ing Dr. Oppenheimer here at this time would
not be in the best interests of the University."
Almost immediately, the Daily announced a
"flood" of letters from students, faculty, and
Seattle citizens who questioned, protested, and
occasionally denounced the decision as a "re
pudiation of the mission of higher education,"
"a direct violation of ... a fundamental of
democracy, intellectual freedom," and "a typi
cal example of tendencies to judge a scientist
a brilliant scientist who would speak only on
.science -by his politics."
Some letters suggested that Dr. Schmitz' de
cision was due to the fact that a bill tor (Jui

versity funds was before the State Legislature
and that the president "feared their opinion"
on the subject "more than public sentiment."
The letters deplored a world where "we can
not always carry the banner of principles and
overlook the dirty dollar."
The president was requested to reconsider
his decision in the light of the campus protest,
according to the Daily, but refused to change
his stand. Protest increased and in the midst
of it all, a new debate arose as to whether the
Daily was giving a "fair and unbiased account
of the proceedings."
Letters complained that "no attempt is be
ing made to elicit any statements in favor of
Dr. Schmitz' stand on the Oppenheimer case."
These, the Daily replied to by saying that "pro
fessors and students seem unwilling to give
statements to be printed in favor of the presi
dent."
