We're getting a clip job, men. Rally round.
Effective March 15 the price of a haircut in
Alameda County will be 51.75. The trim ar
tists in the rest of the state aren't going to sit
still while their Alameda buddies rake in the
loot; men everywhere will be affected.
It's high time the customers had their say.
For many years barbers have been raising the
price of haircuts, and raising the price, and
raising the price. But nothing has been done in
retaliation by the poor oppressed clientele. Up
to now, that is.
Knowing that a haircut is a gentlemanly ne
cessity they have continued skyrocketing the
fee for a clip. What to do to lower prices, or
rather, to cut 'em out completely? Make hair
cuts non-necessities! Simple as that.
In accomplishing this there are two alterna
tives, namely:
1. Begin a back-to-the-cave movement in
men's hair styles. Make long, shaggy hair the
thing. Look at Tony Curtis of cinema fame.
And he doesn't do too badly with the ladies,
does he?
2. Do the opposite and start a back-to-the
monastery fad. With this innovation everyone
can start wearing the "cue ball cut." This fits

right in with the natural look in men's clothing.
What is more natural looking than a new-born
babe, and what is more bald than a new-born
babe?
But we must think of the conseguences of
such moves. The results as concerns the gen
eral populace will be good whichever alterna
tive is chosen. In one case, we become lovers
a la Tony Curtis; in the other we are in the
height of fashion.
But what of the effect on the barbers? They
are the opportunists who have been grabbing
all our loot and don't deserve any break, but
their wives and kiddies, have a thought for
them.
We must keep the breadwinners employed.
They won't be able to cut hair, but they can
be put to use in the new scheme of things.
If we choose the Hollywood look they can
be hair-dressers.
If we decide to sport the "cue-ball cut" the
ex-clip artists can be put to work shining bald
pates. We must be shined from head to foot,
from shoe top to head top.
Or maybe it would be simpler to hand your
roommate a pair of scissors.

tives, namely:
1. Begin a back-to-the-cave movement in
men's hair styles. Make long, shaggy hair the
thing. Look at Tony Curtis of cinema fame.
And he doesn't do too badly with the ladies,
does he?
2. Do the opposite and start a back-to-the
monastery fad. With this innovation everyone
can start wearing the "cue ball cut." This fits

right in with the natural look in men's clothing.
What is more natural looking than a new-born
babe, and what is more bald than a new-born
babe?
But we must think of the conseguences of
such moves. The results as concerns the gen
eral populace will be good whichever alterna
tive is chosen. In one case, we become lovers
a la Tony Curtis; in the other we are in the
height of fashion.
But what of the effect on the barbers? They
are the opportunists who have been grabbing
all our loot and don't deserve any break, but
their wives and kiddies, have a thought for
them.
We must keep the breadwinners employed.
They won't be able to cut hair, but they can
be put to use in the new scheme of things.
If we choose the Hollywood look they can
be hair-dressers.
If we decide to sport the "cue-ball cut" the
ex-clip artists can be put to work shining bald
pates. We must be shined from head to foot,
from shoe top to head top.
Or maybe it would be simpler to hand your
roommate a pair of scissors.
We're getting a clip job, men. Rally round.
Effective March 15 the price of a haircut in
Alameda County will be 51.75. The trim ar
tists in the rest of the state aren't going to sit
still while their Alameda buddies rake in the
loot; men everywhere will be affected.
It's high time the customers had their say.
For many years barbers have been raising the
price of haircuts, and raising the price, and
raising the price. But nothing has been done in
retaliation by the poor oppressed clientele. Up
to now, that is.
Knowing that a haircut is a gentlemanly ne
cessity they have continued skyrocketing the
fee for a clip. What to do to lower prices, or
rather, to cut 'em out completely? Make hair
cuts non-necessities! Simple as that.
In accomplishing this there are two alterna
tives, namely:
1. Begin a back-to-the-cave movement in
men's hair styles. Make long, shaggy hair the
thing. Look at Tony Curtis of cinema fame.
