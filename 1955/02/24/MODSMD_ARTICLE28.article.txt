# I Hear Music ...
## ROGER HAGAN 
### 
In San Francisco, in the cellar of a
wedge-shaped building on the cor
ner of Kearny and Columbus, there
is an unusual experiment going on.
Opus one is its name.
People still drop in asking what
happened to the hungry i; they are
told to go down another block on
Kearny. The hungry i has moved
to bigger quarters. In its place is a
dark little bistro where nothing
seems to be going on.
And nothing is. All day long a
hi-fi system sends classical and
modern music out through eight or
nine speakers. There is sand on. the
floor, and sketches and North Beach
paintings on the walls. A bar in one
corner dispenses beer, wine, and
cokes to anyone who wants to get up
and get it himself. The furniture is
all canvas and iron, rind a lew deck
chairs.
OASIS IN S.F.
Can it make money? We hope so,
because it is an oasis in that busy
city. The place is seldom crowded,
always subdued, always a relief.
For a quarter you can get a glass
ful of whatever and sink quietly
away in lhat bohemian atmosphere.
Late Sunday afternoons and Tues
day evenings you can hear little
chamber groups of local musicians
playing anything
to Bartok.
After the syrftphony, or on a hot
day, or any time, it is a place to
relax. The bartender, generally, is
unassuming.
If you like beer and opera-type
singing, there is a place not far
from Finocchio's called Bocce Ball,
which features both «ut once and is
usually a lot of fun.
The city is getting a big share of
vocal groups now, reflecting the
booming popularity of such lately in
record sales. The Four Freshmen
are still at Fack's, and the Four
Sharps at the Downbeat. The Lanc
ers are due in at Bimbo's soon, and
best of all, the Hi Lo's have just
signed to appear at Fack's in about

a month. This last is the group
whose records with Frank Corn
stock, the long-time arranger for
Les Brown, are setting a new stand
ard for how much jazz a vocal group
can turn out.
JAZZ RECORDS
Jazz fans can start watching the
Decea label lor a new line of rec
ords. Decca was pleased with the
sale of the "Wild One" album, which
featured Shorty Rogers under a fake
name and his group of ex-Kenton
ites. So they are going to dig back
into tnelr hies ana release things
from contemporary to Mildred Bai
ley.
Rogers (under his own name) has
a new album due in the stores this
week, called "Collaboration." His
collaborator is Andre Previn. In
high school Previn used to try to
sound like Art latum. Since then
he has matured as a pianist, and this
now album shows that he is also an
excellent jazz arranger. The music
is half standards and half originals
based on the chord structure of the
standards chosen, and is played by
Rogers' group.
COMING EVENTS

Can it make money? We hope so,
because it is an oasis in that busy
city. The place is seldom crowded,
always subdued, always a relief.

away in lhat bohemian atmosphere.
Late Sunday afternoons and Tues
day evenings you can hear little
chamber groups of local musicians

to Bartok.
After the syrftphony, or on a hot

singing, there is a place not far
from Finocchio's called Bocce Ball,
which features both «ut once and is
usually a lot of fun.
The city is getting a big share of
vocal groups now, reflecting the
booming popularity of such lately in
record sales. The Four Freshmen
are still at Fack's, and the Four
Sharps at the Downbeat. The Lanc
ers are due in at Bimbo's soon, and
best of all, the Hi Lo's have just
signed to appear at Fack's in about

a month. This last is the group
whose records with Frank Corn
stock, the long-time arranger for
Les Brown, are setting a new stand
ard for how much jazz a vocal group
can turn out.

from contemporary to Mildred Bai
ley.
Rogers (under his own name) has

excellent jazz arranger. The music
is half standards and half originals
based on the chord structure of the
standards chosen, and is played by

is an unusual experiment going on.
Opus one is its name.

dark little bistro where nothing
seems to be going on.

modern music out through eight or
nine speakers. There is sand on. the
