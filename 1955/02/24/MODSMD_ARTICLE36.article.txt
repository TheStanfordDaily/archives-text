# Tomsic, McKeen Threaten Record
## 
### 
Most of the interest remaining in
the PCC Southern Division basket
j ball race is in the scoring race be
-1 tween Bob McKeen oi' California
| and Ron Tomsic of Stanford. UCLA
has sewed up first place, with USC
J and Stanford tied for second four
! games back.
McKeen has scored 219 points in
I 10 games, while the dark - haired
Tomsic is 11 points behind with 208.
j Either or both could easily break
j Bill Sharman's scoring record of 208
set in 1951. If either goes over the
i 238-point mark it will be an un
beatable record, since starting next
year, the divisions will be aban
doned in favor of an all-conference
round-robin schedule.
Bill Bond is the only other Card
jin the top ten. Bond has hit 12!)
points to rank seventh in the divi
l sion scoring race.
