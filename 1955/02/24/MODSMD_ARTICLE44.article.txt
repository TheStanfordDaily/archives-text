SCIENCE MADE SIMPLE: NO. 2

Though this column is intended solely as a vehicle for well
tempered drollery, the makers of Philip Morris have agreed to
let. me use this space from time to time for a short lesson in
science. They are the most decent and obliging of men, the
makers of Philip Morris, as one would guess from sampling
tlieir product. Only from bounteous hearts could come such a
pleasurable cigarette—so felicitously blended, so gratifying to
the taste, so soothing to the psyche. And, as though bringing
you the most agreeable cigarette on the market were not enough,
the makers of Philip Morris have enclosed their wares in the
Snap-Open Pack, an ingeniously contrived wrapping that yields
lip its treasure without loss of time or cuticle. And.finally,
this paragon of cigarettes, wrapped in the paragon of packages,
can be had in king-size or regular, as your taste dictates. Who
can resist such a winning combination? Not I.
A few weeks ago in this column we had a brief lesson in chem
istry. Today we take up another attractive science- medicine.
Medicine was invented in 10GG by a Greek named Hippocrates.
He soon attracted around him a group of devoted disciples whom
he called "doctors". The reason he called them "doctors" was
that they sat around a dock all day. Some fished, some just
dozed in the noonday sun. In truth, there was little else for them
to do, because disease was not invented until 1192.
After that doctors became very busy, but, it must be reported,
their knowledge' of medicine was lamentably meagre. They
knew only one treatment—a change of climate. For example, a
French doctor would send all his patients to Switzerland; a
Swiss doctor, on the other hand, would send all his patients to
France. By 1789 the entire population of Frame was living in
Switzerland, and vice versa. This later became known as the
Black Tom Explosion.
Not until 1921 did medicine, as we know it, come into being,
in that year in the little Bavarian village of Pago-Pago an
elderly physician named Winko Sigafoos discovered the hot
•water bottle. He was, of course, burned as a witch, but his son
Lydia, disguised as a linotype, smuggled the hot water bottle
out of the country, lie called on Florence Nightingale in London
but was told by her housekeeper, with some asperity, that Miss
Nightingale had died in 1910. Lydia muttered something and,
disguised as a feather boa, made his way to America, where he
invented the blood stream.
M edicinc, as it is taught at your very own college, can be divided
roughly into two classifications. There is internal medicine,
which is the treatment of internes, and external medicine, which
is the treatment of externes.
Diseases also fall into two broad categories—chronic and
acute. Chronic disease, is of course, inflammation of the chron,
which can be mighty painful, believe you me! Last summer my
cousin Haskell was stricken with a chron attack while out pick
ing up tinfoil, and it. was months before the wretched boy could
straighten up. In fact, even after lie was cured, Haskell eon
tinucd to walk around bent over double. This went on for some
weeks before Dr. Caligari, the lovable old country practitioner
who treats Haskell, discovered that Haskell had his pants but
toned to his vest.
Two years ago Haskell had Addison's disease. (Addison, , •
curiously enough, had Haskell's.) Poor Haskell catches every
thing that comes along. Lovable old Dr. Caligari once said to
him. "Son, I guess you are what they call a natural born catcher."
"The joke is on you, Doe," replied Haskell. "I am a third
baseman." He thereupon fell into such a fit, of giggling that the
doctor had to put him under sedation, where he is to this day.
But I digress. We were discussing medicine. I have now told
you all I can; tin; rest is up to you. Go over to your medical
school and poke around. I '.ring popcorn and watch an operation.

Though this column is intended solely as a vehicle for well

A few weeks ago in this column we had a brief lesson in chem
istry. Today we take up another attractive science- medicine.
Medicine was invented in 10GG by a Greek named Hippocrates.
He soon attracted around him a group of devoted disciples whom
he called "doctors". The reason he called them "doctors" was
that they sat around a dock all day. Some fished, some just
dozed in the noonday sun. In truth, there was little else for them
to do, because disease was not invented until 1192.
After that doctors became very busy, but, it must be reported,
their knowledge' of medicine was lamentably meagre. They
knew only one treatment—a change of climate. For example, a
French doctor would send all his patients to Switzerland; a
Swiss doctor, on the other hand, would send all his patients to
France. By 1789 the entire population of Frame was living in
Switzerland, and vice versa. This later became known as the
Black Tom Explosion.
Not until 1921 did medicine, as we know it, come into being,
in that year in the little Bavarian village of Pago-Pago an
elderly physician named Winko Sigafoos discovered the hot
•water bottle. He was, of course, burned as a witch, but his son
