# Soccer Ball to Feature Jazz Combo
## 
### 
The rolling drums and husky
voice of Billy While, together
with the shrieking trumpet of
his wife Gertrude, will set the
pace for the featured jazz combo
at Friday night's Soccer Ball
from 10 to 1 at the Women's
Gym, following the Cal • Stan
ford basketball game.
William and Gertrude White may
well be familiar to many Stanford
students, particularly those who fre
quent the Main Library, where the
couple both hold positions as senior
library assistants.
Other students may know them
for their musical abilities, which
they displayed for the first time on
the Stanford campus at last year's
student-faculty talent show.
Both Bill and Gertrude have life
long musical backgrounds. Bill
learned his jazz on the Mississippi
River boats, back in the 'twenties,
where he came in contact and
played with many of today's leading
musicians. He played the banjo at
the time.
Now, on very rare occasions, Bill
displays his abilities on the drum
and with his voice. Gertrude plays
the trumpet, and Art Smith and
Jimmy Wilson round out the quartet
on the piano and bass respectively.
Tickets for the "stag or drag —
come as you are" affair are now on
sale at Engineering Corner. They
will also be available at the door for
50 cents per person.
