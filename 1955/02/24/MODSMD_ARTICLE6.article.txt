ing examinations from the class- J
room. The by-law codification will |
go into efTeef spring quarter.
The new by-law provides that al
ternate seats muiit be available in j
order to restrict exams to the class- J

' lem about alternate seats for finals I

hers will be urged to request addi- '
tional space for midterms well in I
advance of the test day. She also
said that additional areas for taking |
tests—Memorial Auditorium, Encina
| Commons—will Ijc explored.
Miss Irvine reported that a letter,
' will be sent to all faculty members
explaining the Honor Code and sug

| tution which Excom is trying to
