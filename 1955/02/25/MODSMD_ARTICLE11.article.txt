# Excom Explores Proposed ASSU Financial Branch
## 
### BILL WRIGHT Associate Editor, The Daily 
The Executive Committee began its exploratory discussion
Wednesday night into the financial branch of the draft ASSU con
stitution as proposed by Harrison Schmidt's Committee on Stu
dent Government.
Student Manager Bob Gable outlined his present function as an

introduction to the financial man
agement problems of the ASSU.
Gable said that his duties fall into
four categories:
1. He is a controller of fimds for
all ASSU boards and bodies.
2. He is a bank-teller for the Stu
dents Organization Fund, which is
the banking service of all student
accounts.
3. He has a role as manager of
many aspects of student organiza
tions.
4. And because of his close tic
with most of the groups of the ASSU,
the student manager has a certain
legislative function with regard to
Excom. He is an cx-oflicio mem
ber of Excom.
The proposed constitution seeks to
curb the potentially very powerful
role of a student manager in ASSU
executive affairs. The student man
ager is appointed by the financial
manager of the ASSU —at present
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler—and the elected branch of
the student government has no con
trol over him.
The draft constitution proposes an
executive secretary to be appointed
by the ASSU president to handle

the quasi-legislative matters related
to finances. There is also proposed
a student controller who would be
an accountant and would see that
money was being used for the pur
pose for which it was appropriated.
Also at the meeting, Excom heard
a report from Dave Penny, ASSU
foreign scholar from Australia; ap
proved Kip Koss as a new member
of Public Relations Board.
