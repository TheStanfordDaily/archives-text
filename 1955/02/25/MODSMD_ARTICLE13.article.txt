# 'Cardinals' Guides Many Campus Events
## 
### JAE HUNLEY 
Back to the Farm Week, High
School Day, Big Game Week,
the Con Home Drive—all of
these campus events and others
are sponsored by Cardinals, the
service organization for the
ASSU.
Cardinals' activities begin imme
diately after registration in the fall.
Their major events arc Back to the
Farm Week, the Homecoming float
parade, and Big Game Week and
the varied activities that, go with it.
However, these arc not the only
pr o j e e t. s that occupy Cardinals
members in the fall.

The program of "hospitality for
the visiting football players," which
was inaugurated this year, is a Car
dinals activity, as are the High
School Day for Northern California
which is held here, the one for
Southern California, held in Los
Angeles, and the brand-new "Par
ents' Day for Frosh."
All of these programs are handled
by Individual members of Cardinals
with their own special committees.
Winter quarter is the planning
: and evaluation quarter for Cardi
nals. There are no major activities,
but possibilities for new projects are
developed and old ideas are "given a
| renovation," according to Cardinals
I president James Smith.
I This quarter Cardinals has debated

the feasibility of a "Hoover Day,"
drawn up new plans for the Con
Home drive, and almost completed
all arrangements for a series of

"open houses" at President Ster
ling's.
Spring quarter is the Con Home
Drive—a series of events ' ranging
from a carnival to a barbecue to
raise money to aid the Stanford
Convalescent Home. Also, to a less
er degree, spring quarter means
Spring Sing for Cardinals (although

Rally Com is in charge of the event)
since the Rally Com chairman is an
ex-ofTicio member of the group.
These programs, which form a
major part, of campus events, are
all organized by the 10 regular mem
bers and five ex-ofTicio members of
.Cardinals.

Serving as regular members on
the group now arc James Smith,
president; Lurline Sampson, secre
tary; Barbara Klass, Carol Strauss,

tl'nsen, Sue Ross, and Art StaulTer.

1 manager; Russ Wilks, Daily manag
ing editor; Harmon Brown, Rally

dles or co-handles some definite
j project, under auspices of the
«roup. They are selected for mem
bership on the basis of annual in
