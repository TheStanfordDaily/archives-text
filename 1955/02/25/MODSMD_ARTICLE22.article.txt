# Indians Close Cage Play With Cellar-Dwelling Cal
## Retiring Captains Stanford Seeks Sweep, Second Place in PCC 
### PHIL BERMAN 
The curtain comes down on another Stanford basketball seasor
this weekend, when the Indian cagers play traditional rival Cali
fornia in a pair of games. The Cards and Bears will face off
against each other tonight at the Pavilion, while tomorrow evening
the action shifts to the Men's Gym in Berkeley. Tipoff for both
games is 8:30.
Although both teams are out of the championship fight, UCLA

having clinched that honor la t
week, the games loom as important
ones for Coach Howie Dallmar'
cagers, as they will be striving to
end their season in second place.
They are currently tied for that po
sition with USC, which is doing bat
tle with UCLA this weekend.
To insure themselves of at least a
lie for the runner-up position, the
Indians need to whip California
twice, in case the Trojans dump the
Bruins in their pair. Stanford can
also finish second by winning once
while SC drops two. A split by
both teams would leave them tied
for second.
lill) FOR SWEEP
The Indians will also be bidding
this weekend for their first season's
sweep against Cal since 1949, and
because of the end of division play
this year, it will be their last chance

for a four-game sweep. The In
dians belted the Bears 59-57 and 75-
67 in their first two meetings this
season.
The first encounter was won on
Ron Tomsic's long set shot as the
final buzzer .sounded, while in the
other tilt the Cards built up an 18-
point half-time lead and then staved
off a late Cal rally.
The Indians' overall record this
season is 15-8 and 5-5 in PCC play,
while the Bears are 9-14 for the year
and 1-9 in league competition, their
only triumph being a 58-57 victory
over USC.
PERSONAL BATTLE
Aside from Stanford's quest to take
the second place from the Trojans,
the scries will also be a personal
battle between the PCC's Southern
Division's two scoring leaders, 6-7
Bob McKeen of Cal and 5-11 Bon
Tomsic of Stanford.
Both these sharpshooters are the
all-time scoring leaders of their re
spective schools and both will be
winding up their collegiate careers
this weekend. In his 85 appearances
for the Cardinal and White, Tomsic
has tallied 1,372 points for a 16.1412
overall average, while McKeen in
his 105 games for Cal has meshed
1,606 points for a 15.3 per game
mark.
Tonisic also needs only 18 points
in this weekend's tilts to better the
all-time Stanford three-year var
sity mark of 1,291 points established
by Hank Luisett.i. Luisetti's aver
age for 80 games Is 16.1375.
