Two weeks ago the basketball team made a
disastrous trip to Los Angeles. Stanford's rep
resentatives to those two games with UCLA in
the oft - described Westwood gym returned
with a belly full and they bellyached. Perhaps
because so many bellyached so loud and so
long it indicates that the moaning was not all
sour grapes and was to a great extent justified.
But in bellyaching, Stanford has put itself on
record and on the spot. Stanford has been out
spoken in its derogation of the home court be
havior of Westwood basketball fans. Does
Stanford mean it?
Tonight the local basketball season comes to
an end. The Indians of Howie Dallmar will
host the California Bears in the Pavilion. The
season has been one of hope and frustration;
an excellent, spirited team falling to its supe
rior. Because of that frustration, Stanford fans
will be angered and bitter.

Tonight, amidst the bitterness of a disappoint
ing campaign, Stanford has its lone chance to
demonstrate what it expects of basketball fans
at other conference schools. The only way for
Stanford to defend its attack on unsportsman
like conduct is to set an example of sportsman
ship.
Razzing the opposition is an American cus
tom which is usually considered part of the
game. But threatening officials and booing the
opposition is definitely not part of the game.
And booing and yelling while a visiting player
is readying for a free throw is one. of the most
downright unsportsmanlike gestures any sports
crowd can make.
If the criticism early last week was repre
sentative and sincere, Stanford can salvage
something from the basketball season tonight
by making a stand for sportsmanship.
