INCIDENTAL INTELLIGENCE: A confiden
tial informant tells me that, in one of the men's
living groups hereabouts, a young capitalist has
installed an Eskimo Pie machine. A ten-cent
piece will get you one confection.
Well, sir, in the spirit of Free Enterprise
the American Way—another resident of that
house has informed the first that he (the sec
ond) intends to install a Popsicle machine, of
fering four flavors and a low price of five cents.
This alarmed the original entrepreneur. He
felt, and rightly so, that he would soon be
forced out of business. He fretted that his in
vestment in the business would, as the expres
sion goes, go down the tubes. In fact, he may
even have to lower his prices.
Well, with the idea in mind that the Eskimo
Pie gentleman may be forced to lower his
prices to meet competition, the Popsicle man
is cooking up a scheme whereby the purchas
ers of his product, by saving the bags, can turn
four of them in for a free Popsicle. The results
of this business war will be reported in full on
the Daily financial page.
And guess what happened today. I got a
letter addressed to Jan Flanders:
"DEAR MRS. FLANDERS: I am a young lady
presently attending Stanford and I have a prob

lem. I am going to graduate in June and I
haven't yet been able to find a young man of
the proper temperament, appearance, and so
cio-economic status. In short, I haven't yet been
able to find a husband. It's not that I haven't
tried. I take all the right courses to expose me
to the most men most of the time. In fact, this
quarter I'm enrolled in ME 1 (Forging and
Welding), CE 155 (Construction Equipment and
Methods), PE 153 (Weight Lifting), and Mil Sci
21 (Crew-Served V/eapons and Gunnery).
"And, as if this isn't enough, I go to all the
socially "right" places: The Stone Cellar, The
Idle Hour, Mama Garcia's, et al. And I never
miss a junior league event, either. I'm asking
you, Jan, girl to girl: What can I do?" The
letter was signed "TIRED, BUT TRYING."
Well, dolly, my advice to you is don't play
so hard to get. Make yourself real feminine
and play the "clinging vine" a little. And you
might drop Weight Lifting. It's a little hard for
a weight lifter to be a clinging vine without
breaking someone's arm. But the crux of the
whole mess, dearie, is don't wait for the men
to come to you. You go to them.

presently attending Stanford and I have a prob

lem. I am going to graduate in June and I
haven't yet been able to find a young man of
the proper temperament, appearance, and so
cio-economic status. In short, I haven't yet been
able to find a husband. It's not that I haven't
tried. I take all the right courses to expose me
to the most men most of the time. In fact, this
quarter I'm enrolled in ME 1 (Forging and
Welding), CE 155 (Construction Equipment and
Methods), PE 153 (Weight Lifting), and Mil Sci
21 (Crew-Served V/eapons and Gunnery).
"And, as if this isn't enough, I go to all the
socially "right" places: The Stone Cellar, The
Idle Hour, Mama Garcia's, et al. And I never
miss a junior league event, either. I'm asking
you, Jan, girl to girl: What can I do?" The
letter was signed "TIRED, BUT TRYING."
Well, dolly, my advice to you is don't play
so hard to get. Make yourself real feminine
and play the "clinging vine" a little. And you
might drop Weight Lifting. It's a little hard for
a weight lifter to be a clinging vine without
breaking someone's arm. But the crux of the
whole mess, dearie, is don't wait for the men
to come to you. You go to them.

INCIDENTAL INTELLIGENCE: A confiden
tial informant tells me that, in one of the men's
living groups hereabouts, a young capitalist has
installed an Eskimo Pie machine. A ten-cent
piece will get you one confection.
Well, sir, in the spirit of Free Enterprise
the American Way—another resident of that
house has informed the first that he (the sec
ond) intends to install a Popsicle machine, of
fering four flavors and a low price of five cents.
This alarmed the original entrepreneur. He
felt, and rightly so, that he would soon be
forced out of business. He fretted that his in
vestment in the business would, as the expres
sion goes, go down the tubes. In fact, he may
even have to lower his prices.
Well, with the idea in mind that the Eskimo
Pie gentleman may be forced to lower his
prices to meet competition, the Popsicle man
is cooking up a scheme whereby the purchas
ers of his product, by saving the bags, can turn
four of them in for a free Popsicle. The results
of this business war will be reported in full on
the Daily financial page.
And guess what happened today. I got a
letter addressed to Jan Flanders:
