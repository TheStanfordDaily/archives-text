## Indians Seek Win Against Oakland 
### BILL NICHOLS 
The Stanford baseball team seeks its first victory of the year
tomorrow at 2:30 in the Sunken Diamond against the Oakland Pro's,
a squad made up of Oakland Oak players that has been playing
winter league ball in the Bay Area. The Cards will have a tough row
to hoe since the Pro's present a power-packed lineup featuring

j lour probable starters for the Pa-"
; cilic Coast League Oaks this spring.
| The pitching is provided by three
tough right-handers.
I Coach Dean indicated Stan
ford would go with the same lineup
that lost 7-1 to the alumni last
j weekend, with the possibility that
| Bob Fletcher may get the call.over
Mickey Holzman at second, Pete
Reynolds may start at first instead

of Torn Dandurand, and the left field
1 spot is a tossup between Bob Evans
1 and Ron Marciel.
Ron Young will clothe pitching
for the first five innings, then will
retire in favor of Dick Jones and
Walt Paine who will split the fine.l
four stanzas.
TALENTED HURLING
Pitching tor the visitors will be
(George Bamberger, who was injured
; most of last season, but who won
live games in the Oaks' final stretch
run for a third-place finish; Ernie
Broglio, who may be traded to the
{ Chicago White Sox shortly; and Ron
J Mahrt, an ex-Oak who is now in
: the New York Giant chain with
; Minneapolis.
Chief need of the Indians will be
some base hits. They picked up
only six safeties against the alumni,
and in order to field a winning nine,
Mr. Dean must come up with some
stickers. Presently, Rudy Figueroa
is hitting in the cleanup spot, but if
any of the other talented sophs or
Tom Dandurand show that they can
produce the long* ball, Figueroa
would probably be moved up in the
lineup.
Filling out the rest of the Card
lineup will be Len Swartz behind
the plate, Rich Scramaglia at short,
Figueroa at third, and Sid Hall and
; Bob Gergen in the outfield.
