Edison Hill High, a 6-4 All-North
ern California pivot man lastgyear,
will open at the center slot. Paul
Blake, 6-2, from Long Beach, and
Bob Tealer, 6-3 from San Francisco,
will be the starting forwards. Fill
ing out the starting five are guard
Earl Robinson, All ACAL at Berke
ley. and Bernie Simpson, an All-
City selection at St. Ignatius last
year.
In order to find a consistent win
ning combination, Clegg has re
vamped his starting lineup again.
Opening for the Papooses at Center
will be Clint Waring. At foi*%vard
will be Mike Gray, and his running
mate, Lee Leonard. Dean Thomas
and Gary Van Galder will open as
usual at guard.
"The Cubs can be had," says Clegg,
"but don't forget, this is their best
freshman team in several years."
Cal's yearlings have lost only two
games, both last weekend, to Athens
Athletic Club and City CCSF. The
Blue and Gold will be gunning for
two straight wins, and the Stanfords
should have their hands full.
Both tilts will start at 6:30.
