# AUTOMATION at work

One of Western Elect tic's automatic produc
tion lines used in making the revolutionary
new wire spring relay.

So great was the departure in design of the
new Bell System wire spring relay as com
pared with conventional relays that it posed
a major undertaking for development en
gineers at Western Electric, the manufac
turing and supply unit of the Bell System.
Indeed, it was an undertaking that called
lor new machines and new methods be
cause none was available to do the job.

Longer life, higher operating speed,
lower power consumption, and lower man
ufacturing cost were some of the advan
tages promised by ihe new relay design.
Engineers reasoned thut a lower manufac
turing cost could be achieved through
greater precision in manufacture (which
would cut adjustments) and through ex
tensive use of automatic processes.

One of the products of this reasoning is
pictured at the top of this page. This bat
tery of equipment, developed by Western
Electric product engineers, constitutes one
phase of wire spring relay manufacture.

which automatically performs several separate op
erations. Its function begins after one of the funda
mental elements of the new relay has been fabri
cated. This element, known as a "comb," consists of
a multiplicity of small diameter wires in parallel ar
ray imbedded for pari of their length in molded
phenol plastic.

These molded elements, of which there arc two
types used in the new relay, are delivered to this
line ol machine units in magazines. By fully auto
matic means they are removed from the magazine,
carried by a reciprocating conveyor through each
of the several processes and, when completed,
placed into another magazine to await further as
sembly.

Between the first and final magazine ihe auto
matic battery ol equipment does the following

A new design becomes

operations: clips wire ends, attaches palladium con
tacts to wire ends by means ol percussion welding,
sizes contacts, forms terminal, tension bends wires,
fluxes and tins terminals.

Most remarkable of all is the fact that this is a
precision operation throughout, l or example, the
small block contacts, which arc percussion welded
to the tips of wires of one type of "comb," must be
located on the same plane across the twelve con
tact positions to within a tolerance of i.. .002".

Single Wire Comb with Percussion Welded Contacts,
Wire Spring Relay Designed by Bell Telephone Laboratories
One type of "comb" element is shown at top while a com
pleted wire spring relay is below. The small blocks of metal
on the ends of the wires are cut from a composite tape tim
ing the automatic multiple percussion welding operation.
"Contact conditions" are determined by the code of relay
being manufactured and may vary greatly.
