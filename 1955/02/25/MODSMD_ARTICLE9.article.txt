Anderson's historical drama deals
with (lie effort of the young and
generous Mary Stuart of Scotland
to unite her country despite the
evil forces which plot her downfall.
Mary is a Catholic queen in a
"cold, dour, sour, bastardly villain
ous country" where the Protestant
fanatic John Knox fans religious
hatred. She does, however, through
tolerance and personal charm, near
ly succeed in uniting Scotland.
But Elizabeth, queen of England,
sees in Mary a rival to her own
throne. Rather than dcclare war
openly, Elizabeth connives secretly
with Knox and the Scottish lords to
spread tales about the pleasure-lov
ing queen. Mary is accused of il
licit relations with the rough border
Earl Bothwell and with her Italian
secretary, Rizzio.
Elizabeth, meanwhile, persuades
J her to marry the weak fool Darnley.
The marriage proves Mary's uiulo
j ing-
In a tit of jealous rage Darnley
i murders Rizzio and is in turn mur
j dered by the lords. The war that
results brings Mary's defeat, and
imprisonment by Elizabeth in Eng
land.
The play's last scene is the final
confrontation of the two queens in
Carlisle prison. Even in physical
defeat, Mary triumphs.
