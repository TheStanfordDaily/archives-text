# ON SECURITY COUNCIL
## Humphrey Urges UN Seat to India 
### DAVE SCOTT 
A piopobdl that Nationalist China's permanent seat in the United
Nations Security Council be given to India was voiced last Friday
afternoon by Senator Hubert Humphrey, as a part of his critical
appraisal of our foreign policy.
The Democratic Senator from Minnesota gave his plan for an

internationally-minded program to
a near capacity audience at Cub
berley Auditorium Friday in a
speech under the auspices of the
Political Union.
Humphrey explained his new pro
posal. declaring, "The Chinese gov
ernment on Formosa is weak. It is
useless to deceive ourselves with the
thought that Nationalist forces will
ever take over the China mainland.
"India represents what is happen
ing in the New A c ia. It is throwing
off the shackles of the past. There
are .">. r )0 million people in India, and
only a handful of the Chinese popu
lation on Formosa. Therefore I pro
pose the substitution of India for Na
tionalist China in the UN Security
Council; then let the Soviet Union
say 'No' if they dare."
FOOD SURPLUS
To improve international relations,
Humphrey suggested that we should
set up a food reserve program
whereby our agricultural surplus be
given to the UN, which would dis
tribute it to needy countries.
The Senator also expressed great
enthusiasm for the student ex
change program. "This program
should not be doubled," ho declared,
"It should be increased to five or
six times what it is now."
Commenting on the Formosa situ
ation, Humphrey commended Presi
dent Eisenhower in making Congress
vote on the Formosa defense resolu
tion. "Now we can't wiggle out of
it. like many Congressmen tried to
do when President Truman's send
ing troops to Korea became un
popular."
Humphrey suggested that we quit
trying to buck the opinions of our
allies by insisting on a defense of
Matsu and Queinoy. "It is good to
make concessions to keep our allies
all united," he said emphatically.
WARNS or DISTRACTIONS
He cautioned the audience not. to
be detracted by the Formosan situ
ation. "The number one problem in
the world today is not Formosa. What
the Soviet Union wants is West
Germany and Japan, Because of their
power, population and industry."
Humphrey stated that we also
should not be detracted by the
change of leadership in Russia. "The
objectives of world wide Communism
are still the same. We shouldn't per
mit. ourselves to see the color we
want to see. - '
He reiterated his belief in an
emphasis on both military and eco
nomic aid. "We have done amazingly
well with our relief since the war.
The rapid recovery of the European
countries is testified to by the fact
that 'they arc strong enough to talk
back to us now."
Stressing military preparedness,
the Senator from Minnesota voiced
opposition to any cuts in the armed
forces. "It was unwise to cut the
air force last year, and I so voted,
he declared.

Humphrey admitted that we have
some inefficiency and incompetence
in our defense programs. "But you
know,"he said, "I have read all the
great documents of liberty and de
mocracyâ€”The Magna Carta, The Bill
of Rights, the Declaration of Inde
pendence and I defy any student, in
structor. or professor in this Uni
versity to find the word 'efficiency'
in any of them."
He said that any, attempt to carry
our military program as far as an
actual attack on the China Mainland
would be disastrous. "It. is also in
teresting to note that the very same
people who wanted to bomb Chinese
bases beyond the Yalu river during
the Korean war and carry an ex
tensive attack on the Chinese main
land were the very ones that wanted
to cut the military budget."
