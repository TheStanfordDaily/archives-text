Should there be a light at the Palm Drive
rides shelter?
A few students who, waiting for rides late in
the evening, have found themselves waiting
in the dark, have gone to Alpha Phi Omega, the
service fraternity which helped pay for the
shelter, to ask for a light at the shelter. Their
point is that passing drivers can't see them in
the dark.
A Phi O has gotten rough estimates that the
cost of extending a power line to the shelter
and setting up a light might run to $300. Before
taking any further steps on this relatively ex

pensive project, the service fraternity wants to
be sure there is a real student need and demand
for such a light.
Certainly a light of some sort at the rides
shelter would be a good thing, for the safety
and convenience of those waiting for rides after
dark as well as a means of attracting attention
of passing drivers.
A Phi O officers would like students who use
the shelter to write letters stating their views on
this matter to Stanford Box 1643 or to The Daily.
Once student need has been accurately deter
mined, plans can be made.


MORE LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT?
