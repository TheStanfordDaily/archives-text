The Intermezzo Series continues to bring the
best foreign films to the Stanford screen as it
presents the Italian small-screen, one-dimen
sional, uni-directional sound flicker, Stranqe
Deception, tomorrow at 2:15 in Cubberley.
That same evening the noted American com
poser Elliott Carter will give a lecture with mu
sical illustrations on "Europe and Music To
day." Carter is presenting a series of concerts
and lectures at the campus this week. It's bet
ter living through music. . . .
One of America's famous lost plays, The
Lien of the West, will be presented as the Wed
nesday matinee at 4:15 in the Little Theater.
James Kirke Paulding stars in the reading role.
Only last month another long lost play. Tiger
from the East, was found.
Broderick Crawford plays the big man poli
tician Thursday evening in the film series fea
ture, All the King's Men, in Cubbexley at
7:30. A satire on the famous "Humpty Dumpty"
poem, this picture is geared to keep you in a
state of hyper-suspense.
For the showgoer the Stanford Players' pro
duction Mary of Scotland will lift the curtain
Thursday night at 8:15 in Mem Aud and run
through Saturday. The great Maxwell Ander
son play pits lovable good Queen Bess against
Mary Stuart of Scotland. Good Queen Liz, how
ever, plays the villain as she connives with re
ligious fanatic John Knox to keep Mary from

the English throne. An inspiring play about in
spirational people performed by inspirational
actors. Rather good.

Background of Modern Greece" Friday after
noon at 4:15 in Cubberley.
In an attempt to battle that age-old slump, the
sophomore class will promote the Sophomore
Cotillion Saturday night at the San Francisco
Surf Club. It's the last big social fling of the
quarter and the '57ers are doing it up brown
by having continuous music. Ray Hackett will
provide the slow motion stuff, and when he's
out to lunch jazz master Rebel "I hear ya calling
Caroline" Daily will let loose with the fast foot
work stuff.
Frank Sinatra, making another of his famous
comebacks, gets top billing in Suddenly in the
final Sunday Night flick of the quarter. Sinatra
plays a madman assassin long gone.
SLEEPER OF THE WEEK—Sun spots, mag
netic storms, the aurora: all of these and more
will be included in a talk by Dr. Donald H. Men
zel today in the lecture room of the Electronics
Research Lab at 2 p.m. Dr. Menzel, Ivy Leaguer
from Harvard, is visiting the campus in connec
tion with research work pertaining to radio
propagation in the upper atmosphere. Good
oh. . . .
Beware the ides of March. . . .
