"Back to the Farm Week" is
the first major project of Cardin
als each year.
This tradition features events
ranging from a student-faculty tal
ent show to "Olympic Day," a wild
race to Rudy's, with senior men car
rying the "torch of learning."
The 1954 co - chairmen for the
project, which is sponsored by Car
dinals, were Maureen Maxwell and
Harvey Christensen.
In describing the purpose of the
program, Miss Maxwell pointed out
that "the main idea is to aid in get
ting the professors acquainted with
the students and vice vei-sa."
1 his, according to Miss Maxwell
and Christensen, was the basis for
the faculty-student dinners and tal
ent show,'which was adopted for the
first time this year.
The chairmen stated that approxi
mately 80 professors had dinner in
campus eating halls and that over 45
students visited professors' homes
for dinner. Immediately after the
meals, a talent show, "Farm Frol
ics," was presented in Frost Amphi
theater . .
The 1954 show featured two mas
tars of ceremonies, Dean H. Donald
Winbigler, representing the faculty,
and Richie Meyer for the students.
Among the acts they announced
were a talk by President Wallace
Sterling, a monologue by Robert Lo
per of the Speech and Drama De
partment. a trumpet and tap
dance routine by Mr. and Mrs. Wil
liam White, who recently played at
the Soccer Ball.
Miss Maxwell and Christensen
emphasized that this show was pos
sible only through the combined ef
forts of the students and faculty.
"We had, besides our student sub
chairmen, a faculty committee work
ing with us every step of the way,"
they said.
Besides the talent show, "Back to
the' FiU'tti Week" also has the tradi
tions of an old-car parade, the show
ing of old football movies, and
"Olympic Day."
The chairmen stated that the 1954
"Olympic Day" was one of the best
attended events. Over 3,000 people

were reported to have waited at .
Rudy's for the arrival of the torch- :
bearing seniors, clad in togas, laurel |
wreaths, and dignity.
Christensen pointed out that the
main problem faced by the "Back j
to the Farm Week" chairmen wasl
that of finding events which had ap
peal for all of the campus. "This j
question of appeal previously j
brought about the abandoning oi the |
old ideas of "barefoot day"and "old ;
clothes day."
