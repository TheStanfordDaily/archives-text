### JIM BAKER 
With the Stanford Papooses lead
| ing the California Cubs 51 to 50, and
j 15 seconds left, star Cub guard Earl
Robinson grabbed the ball and
I flicked it through the net to give
the Cubs their third straight victory
over the Papooses, 52-51, Saturday
night in the Cal gym.
The lead changed hands 15 times
in the first half of the tilt. The Cubs
jumped off to a quick lead on Rob
inson's five straight free throws, but
i then the Papooses began to hit.
| Right before the half Clint Waring
j hit on a jump that gave the Indian
frosh a lead that they didn't relin
quish until Robinson's last-minute
j goal.
Robinson, who scored 21 points to
! lead both teams, kept the Cubs in
j the game with his timely shots. High
j point man for the Papooses was
! Gary Van Galder, who got 12.
On Friday night the Papooses
came from behind twice, once to go
ahead, and once to tie the Cubs, but
Paul Blake, unheralded guard from
Long Beach, potted jump shots both
times to put the Cubs ahead.
A two-minute stall at the end of
the Friday night game gave the
Cubs the victory, 65-60.
Both games were close, being de
cided by a few percentage points in
shooting. Despite the two losses,
Coach Dick Clegg was pleased with
the team play.
The frosh ended their season with
a record of 10 and 5, while the Cal
frosh had 13 and 2.
