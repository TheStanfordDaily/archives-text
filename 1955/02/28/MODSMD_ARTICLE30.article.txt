Rain cut into the sports sched
uled for Stanford this weekend.
The tennis match with the Olym
pic Club, the rugby game with the
Palo Alto Ramblers, and the base
ball tilt with the Hayward pros
were all canceled. Stanford's box
ers lost to Santa Clara 5-3 when
they had to forfeit three matches,
and the swimmers won over San
Jose State 64-19 when they placed
first in all but one event.
