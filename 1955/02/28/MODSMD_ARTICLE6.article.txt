# Cards Dump Bears Twice To Finish in Second Place
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
The curlain came down on the Stanford basketball season over
the weekend as the Indian cagers swept a pair of games from
California. Friday night in the Pavilion the Cards defeated the
Bears 90-84, while at Berkeley the following evening Stanford
prevailed 77-68.
The duo victory gave Stanford second place in the Pacific Coast

Conference Southern with a 7-5 rec
ord. USC was tied for second with
the Indians until this week but the
Trojans lost twice to UCLA, the
Southern Division champion. It also
gave the Cards a sweep of the sea
son's series over California, the first
time a Stanford quintet had ac
complished this feat since 1949, and
only the third time in the history of
the long rivalry between the two
schools. California still leads the
overall series with 88 wins to Stan
ford's 50.
REST SEASON IN H YEARS
Stanford finished its season with a
17-8 record in all games, the best
Stanford record since 1942 while
their second place conference fin
ish was the best the Cards have
done since that year. Thus Howie
Dallmar had a mo; t successful
coaching debut at the helm of the
Indians.
More important than the two vic
tories however, was the record shat
tering performances put on by Stan
ford's lion Tom.sic and California's
Bob MeKeen, both the greatest scor
ers in their alma mater's history and
both playing the final games of their
collegiate careers.
Tom: ic mc.'hed 2(5 points in Fri
day's game and added 18 more Sat
urday to break the PCC South
ern Division Scoring record set by
Bill Sharrnan of LSC in 1950. Me

! Keen scored 48 points in the two I
j [James to also shatter Sharman's rec- |
j orcl and finish the season as the |
PCC's individual scoring leader with !
267 points. Tomsic finished the year \
with 253 points. Both these records
v.'ill never be broken as the PCC
' ended division play this year.
Tomsic, who rewrote the Stan
ford record book in his four years
on the Farm, scored 482 points this
j season to give him a Stanford career
total of 1,416 points m 87 games.
; This gives him an average of a
10.2770, which surpasses the lifetime
varsity record of Hank Luisetti,
TOMSIC TOP SCOIIUK
During his four years of varsity
play, Tomsic also established Stan
ford records for most points in a
season, 515; and most points in three i
and four years or varsity play; a
Pavilion individual scoring high of |
40 points, which also set a Southern |
Division PCC one-game record; a j
Cow Palace scoring record of 39 j
points in a game, and second place |
lo McKeen in all-time PCC scoring j
with 033 points. • When Tomsic left !
the game Friday night in his final !
Pavilion appearance, the crowd cave !
him a thrilling heart-tugging and
well-deserved standing ovation.
Three otlu r Stanford seniors also
closed out their varsity careers this
j weekend. They were center Puss
Lawlcr and reserves Leo Sehwaigert
and Bill Turner.
Friday nignt, the Indians kept ex
changing .spurts with Cal. but a final
last surge after the Blue and Gold
had crept, up lo within four points
with four minytes to play, gave the

After the final game Saturday
night, Indian coach Howie Dallmur
appraised Stanford's season as "bet

"We were lucky to go as far as
| we did before injuries hit us," Dall
j mar stated. "Unfortunately, injuries :
hit us at the wrong times. On the j
whole however, I was happy with :
the season."
In summing up prospects for next j
year Dallmar predicted his chief
problems as lack of height and an
experienced post man. "We may be
smaller than this year," he said,
j "And we'll have some problems.
How we will get the ball, how we
will get a post man, and also find- i
ing someone to replace Tomsic." |
Dallmar's two big losses this year j
are Tomsic and Lywler, plus re- \
serves Schwaiger and Turner. How- |
| ever, he will have a nucleus of three ,
of this year's starters to build on, j
Selleck, Bill Bond, and Brown.
Pete Newell, California mentor, |
said after the games "Stanford didn't J
play its best ball, but neither did
we. We couldn't get a basket or free I
throw when they were needed," he
stated.
| Newell was fairly optimistic about
j/iext season even though his club
j had a 1-11 league mark and 9-16 for
j the season, and loses Bob McKeen.
j "Our sophomores will have a year
of experience," he said, "and we will
! have some back-line help from our
! freshman team, but we still will !
; have some filling in to do, specially
I on our front line."

The curlain came down on the Stanford basketball season over
the weekend as the Indian cagers swept a pair of games from
California. Friday night in the Pavilion the Cards defeated the
Bears 90-84, while at Berkeley the following evening Stanford
prevailed 77-68.
The duo victory gave Stanford second place in the Pacific Coast

Conference Southern with a 7-5 rec
ord. USC was tied for second with
the Indians until this week but the
Trojans lost twice to UCLA, the
Southern Division champion. It also
gave the Cards a sweep of the sea
son's series over California, the first
time a Stanford quintet had ac
complished this feat since 1949, and
only the third time in the history of
the long rivalry between the two
schools. California still leads the
overall series with 88 wins to Stan
ford's 50.
REST SEASON IN H YEARS
Stanford finished its season with a
17-8 record in all games, the best
Stanford record since 1942 while
their second place conference fin
ish was the best the Cards have
done since that year. Thus Howie
Dallmar had a mo; t successful
coaching debut at the helm of the
Indians.
More important than the two vic
tories however, was the record shat
tering performances put on by Stan
ford's lion Tom.sic and California's
Bob MeKeen, both the greatest scor
ers in their alma mater's history and
both playing the final games of their
collegiate careers.
Tom: ic mc.'hed 2(5 points in Fri
day's game and added 18 more Sat
urday to break the PCC South

Bill Sharrnan of LSC in 1950. Me

! Keen scored 48 points in the two I
j [James to also shatter Sharman's rec- |
j orcl and finish the season as the |
PCC's individual scoring leader with !
267 points. Tomsic finished the year \
with 253 points. Both these records
v.'ill never be broken as the PCC
' ended division play this year.
Tomsic, who rewrote the Stan
ford record book in his four years
on the Farm, scored 482 points this
j season to give him a Stanford career
total of 1,416 points m 87 games.
; This gives him an average of a
10.2770, which surpasses the lifetime
varsity record of Hank Luisetti,
TOMSIC TOP SCOIIUK
During his four years of varsity
play, Tomsic also established Stan
ford records for most points in a
season, 515; and most points in three i
and four years or varsity play; a
Pavilion individual scoring high of |
40 points, which also set a Southern |
Division PCC one-game record; a j

The curlain came down on the Stanford basketball season over
the weekend as the Indian cagers swept a pair of games from
California. Friday night in the Pavilion the Cards defeated the
Bears 90-84, while at Berkeley the following evening Stanford
prevailed 77-68.
The duo victory gave Stanford second place in the Pacific Coast

Conference Southern with a 7-5 rec
ord. USC was tied for second with
the Indians until this week but the
Trojans lost twice to UCLA, the
Southern Division champion. It also
gave the Cards a sweep of the sea
son's series over California, the first
time a Stanford quintet had ac
complished this feat since 1949, and
only the third time in the history of
the long rivalry between the two
schools. California still leads the
overall series with 88 wins to Stan
ford's 50.
REST SEASON IN H YEARS
Stanford finished its season with a
17-8 record in all games, the best
Stanford record since 1942 while
their second place conference fin
ish was the best the Cards have
done since that year. Thus Howie
Dallmar had a mo; t successful
coaching debut at the helm of the
Indians.
More important than the two vic
tories however, was the record shat
tering performances put on by Stan
ford's lion Tom.sic and California's
Bob MeKeen, both the greatest scor
ers in their alma mater's history and
both playing the final games of their
collegiate careers.
Tom: ic mc.'hed 2(5 points in Fri
day's game and added 18 more Sat
urday to break the PCC South

Bill Sharrnan of LSC in 1950. Me

! Keen scored 48 points in the two I
j [James to also shatter Sharman's rec- |
j orcl and finish the season as the |
PCC's individual scoring leader with !
267 points. Tomsic finished the year \
with 253 points. Both these records
v.'ill never be broken as the PCC
' ended division play this year.
Tomsic, who rewrote the Stan
ford record book in his four years
on the Farm, scored 482 points this
j season to give him a Stanford career
total of 1,416 points m 87 games.
; This gives him an average of a
10.2770, which surpasses the lifetime
varsity record of Hank Luisetti,
TOMSIC TOP SCOIIUK
During his four years of varsity
play, Tomsic also established Stan
ford records for most points in a
season, 515; and most points in three i
and four years or varsity play; a
Pavilion individual scoring high of |
40 points, which also set a Southern |
Division PCC one-game record; a j
Cow Palace scoring record of 39 j
points in a game, and second place |
lo McKeen in all-time PCC scoring j
with 033 points. • When Tomsic left !

him a thrilling heart-tugging and
well-deserved standing ovation.
Three otlu r Stanford seniors also
closed out their varsity careers this
j weekend. They were center Puss

and Bill Turner.
Friday nignt, the Indians kept ex

until the final four minutes as the
j score was tied a dozen times during
i the contest and the lead changed
j hands on 30 separate occasions. With
] the score tied at 62-all, Barry Brown
j and Russ Lawler paced a rally that
j put Stanford ahead by ten points
within the next two minutes. Brown
! and Lawler both played exceptional
| ball off the boards, while Selleck

again starred with his indescribably
I brilliant floor play.

After the final game Saturday
night, Indian coach Howie Dallmur
appraised Stanford's season as "bet
j ter thah he expected."
"We were lucky to go as far as
| we did before injuries hit us," Dall
j mar stated. "Unfortunately, injuries :
hit us at the wrong times. On the j
whole however, I was happy with :
the season."
In summing up prospects for next j
year Dallmar predicted his chief
problems as lack of height and an
experienced post man. "We may be
smaller than this year," he said,
j "And we'll have some problems.
How we will get the ball, how we
will get a post man, and also find- i
ing someone to replace Tomsic." |
Dallmar's two big losses this year j
are Tomsic and Lywler, plus re- \
serves Schwaiger and Turner. How- |
| ever, he will have a nucleus of three ,
of this year's starters to build on, j
Selleck, Bill Bond, and Brown.
Pete Newell, California mentor, |
said after the games "Stanford didn't J
play its best ball, but neither did
we. We couldn't get a basket or free I
throw when they were needed," he
stated.
| Newell was fairly optimistic about
j/iext season even though his club
j had a 1-11 league mark and 9-16 for
j the season, and loses Bob McKeen.
j "Our sophomores will have a year
of experience," he said, "and we will
! have some back-line help from our
! freshman team, but we still will !
; have some filling in to do, specially
I on our front line."
