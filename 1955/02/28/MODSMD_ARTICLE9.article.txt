# Honor Code Policies Are Clarified in Report
## 
### 
The ASSU Honor Code Committee, working in conjunction with
the Fundamental Standard Committee, has drawn up a report at
tempting to clarify the basic policy in regard to the Honor Code.
Th*e report, approved by the ASSU Executive Committee last
Wednesday night, contains the following stipulations applicable
both to students and faculty: i .

1. If alternate seating is available,
all examinations will be taken in the
class room. Tiic professor will he
expected to tell his class whether
alternate scats will be available |
prior to the exam time, preferably
during the previous class period.
In the case that proper seating has
not been prepared, no one will be
required to remain in the class room. ;
A professor desiring more room
space for exams may contact the
scheduling office.
LEAVING TIIE ROOM
2. A student is free to leave the J
examination room at any time, but I
the examination itself will be re- !
moved from the room only if alter- {
natc seats are not available or if]
special permission has been given |
by the professor.
3. Special permission to leave the
tost room may be received from the
professor only if absolutely neces- i
sary. This permission should be
grunted before the student receives
his examination paper.
. The professor or some assistant
authorized by him to grant permis
sion should be readily available for
the first 10 minutes of the examina
tion and should inform the students
of his whereabouts during the re
mainder of the exam period.
4. TJiere shall be no smoking in
the designated rooms during exami
nation time.
EXAMINATION CONDUCT
5. Students are asked to avoid
any suspicious action on their own
part during the examination period.
Since the Honor Code is based fun- ;
damentally on the concept of trust, it ;
is important that each student be j
careful not to create the appearance
of cheating. An atmosphere of
prevalent cheating, though falla
cious, can be as destructive to the
spirit of the Honor Code as actual
violations.
Thus it is recommended by the j
Honor Code Committee that stu- j
dents refrain from unnecessary talk- !
ing in the examination room and j
reference to books and papers dur
ing the exam period, ft is also rcc- i
ommended that the student should i
not take the examinations from the |
room nftcr the official time for j
receiving special permission has |
passed.
G. All Honor Code violations may
be turned in to the Council for Stu
dent Control box outside the ASSU i
office in the Student. Union.
