# Draft Quotas Slashed; Lowest Call Since 1950
## Gen. Ridgway— Cuts Dangerous' 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28( UP)
• The Defense Department to
day slashed April draft calls to
8,000 men for the Army, the low
est monthly quota since the draft
was revived in 1950 at the start
of the Korean war.
The April call was issued as Gen.
Matthew B. Riclgway, Army Chief
of Staff, told Congress that admin
istration cuts in Army manpower
are "dangerous" to national secu
rity. He called for an Army of 1,-
400,000 men, as against administra
tion plans for a 1,127,000-man force.'
Simultaneously, Defense Mobilizcr
Arthur S. Flemming vehemently de
nied that President Eisenhower's
manpower cutbacks were influenced
by "economy" or "budgetary re
quirements." Flemming urged House
approval of the President's new re
serve training plan.
The 8,000-man April draft call, all
for the Army, compares with 11,000
called up in March and February,
and 23,000 for January. Defense of
ficials indicated May and June calls
may be held at the April level. But
first they want to see how the num
ber of volunteers holds up.
The Defense Department said the
April call "represents a moderate
decrease from the previous estimate
because of a greater number of vol
untary enlistments into the Army
than had been forecast." It disclosed
Friday that (38,103 men volunteered
in January, 25,600 for the Army.
The rush to get in uniform was
attributed mainly to the desire of
young men to beat the Jan. 31 dead
line for GI wartime benefits. The
Army wound up January with 1.-
334,220 men, a net gain of 8.170 for
the month.
