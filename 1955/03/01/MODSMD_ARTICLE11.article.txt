# Chuck Taylor to Discuss Athletic Program Tonight
## 
### 
"What Price Football?" will be the subject of a talk by head
football coach Chuck Taylor tonight in the Eating Club Lounge be
ginning at 6:45. The talk, which is being sponsored by the Inter
club Council, will be open to all students.
Taylor will include in his speech an outline of the athletic pro-

gram at Stanford; where the athletic
finances come from and how indi
viduals qualify for them; and an ex
planation of the Buck Club, the
alumni program for raising funds for
worthy athletes.
Tonight will be the first time that
the colorful coach has talked before
an open group of students. Accord
ing to Intcrclub President Marty
Armbrust, Taylor is "interested in
informing the student body of the
athletic situation at Stanford."
The "Buck Club," whose collec
tions go toward paying the tuition
of students with athletic ability who
demonstrate a real and substantial
need for aid, has a long history at
Stanford, but has achieved its pres
ent status under Taylor.
Following the speech, Taylor, who
will have dinner with members of
El Campo Club earlier in the even
ing, will conduct a question and
answer period.
