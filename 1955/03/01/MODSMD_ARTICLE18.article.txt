Dr. J. Robert Oppcnheimer's
views on some of the interrela
i tions of science and cjovernment
were expressed in a filmed in
torview with Edward H. Murrow
shown last night in Cubberley
1 Auditorium.
The informal interview was re
corded Dee. 1(5. 195-1. at. Princeton,
| New Jersey, where Dr. Oppenheim
! or is director of the Institute for
I Advanced Study.
Interchange of ideas between
American .scientists and those of the
j rest of the world is severely limited.
Dr. Oppenheimer emphasized, by
present immigration laws, which
have prevented many of the most
eminent scientists of other countries
from entering the United States to !

attend congresses or conferences.
Asked by Murrow what he
thought about, this impediment, Dr.
Oppenhcimcr called it a "wholly
fantastic and grotesque way to meet
the threat of espionage."
The scientists of the country arc,
he said, "rightly ashamed by the

| contempt of the Europeans, and
I rightly embarrassed that congresses
can't be held here."
Almost all of the fundamental disr
covcries in science have been the
result of work and co-operation by
men of many different countries, lie
i pointed out.
Referring to the importance of the
discoveries and decisions of scien
tists in today's world, Murrow asked
tho physicist., "What about the unin
formed layman i?i this era of sci
ence?"
Dr. Oppenhcimcr considered a
moment, and replied. "Not only the
layman is ignorant; the scientist has
only little pate her of knowledge.
"The problem of civilization is liv
ing with ignorance and not being
frustrated by it."
Speaking of government restric
tions on the publicizing and sharing
of scientific knowledge, Dr. Oppen
hcinier said, "The trouble with se
crecy is that il inhibits science . . .
it. denies to the government, the wis
dom and resources of the whole
community.
"Free and uncorruptcd communi
cation is the heart, of living in ;i
complicated technological world."
The showing of the interview here
| was sponsored by the Stanford
I chapter of the Federation of Ameri
can Scientists, a national organiza
tion concerned with the impact of
science on soiccty.
