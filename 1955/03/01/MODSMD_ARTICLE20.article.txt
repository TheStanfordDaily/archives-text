# Anderson— From Farm To Fame
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
Twenty-five years ago an un
known young man named
Anderson made not much of a
stir in the literary world with a
book of poems he had written
as an instructor of English at
Stanford. Thursday at 8 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium several
hundred people will hail the
Stanford Players' production of
that same Maxwell Anderson's
"Mary of Scotland."
Miss Edith Mirrielees, Emeritus
Professor of English at Stanford, i-e
-members lit instructor Anderson as
an "admirably good student."' He
was deeply interested in writing,
but, while at Stanford, had not yet
done any work in drama.
After leaving the University,
Anderson worked on the old "Globe"
newspaper in New York which was
at that time staffed largely by ex-
Stan fordites.
He turned to verse for his plays
because he was weary of prose that
"never lifted from the ground." His
first blank verse play, "The White
Desert," was, however, a failure.
In studying l.he great poetic mast
erpieces of flic theater Anderson
found what he thought to be the
reason for his early disappointment.
Every famous playwright from
Sophocles to Shakes|»e«ro set His
story in a scene remote in time and
place.
Accordingly, in 15)150, he wrote his;
first historical drama, "Elizabeth the
Queen," which was closely followed
by its companion piece, "Mary of
Scotland," in 1H33. Anderson was
hailed as one of the most important
talent ■ of Ihe American stage.
Tickets for "Mary of Scotland"

Hall Box Office from 12:30 to -1:30
