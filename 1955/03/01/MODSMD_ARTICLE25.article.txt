Last semester at the University of California
at Los Angeles, the Administration issued a
directive changing the method of the election
of the editor of the college paper, the Daily
Bruin.
This took the election of the editor out of the
hands of the staff and made the choice similar
to that of electing a student body president.
Controversy over this decision arose both on
and off the paper.
Now, a group of students from the Daily
Bruin's former editorial board have come out
with their own paper, The Observer, in an at
tempt to avoid strict "Administration control."
Acco; ling to the editors, The Observer will
be ai&iributed free of charge, but they re
quested that students interested in having such
a paper send contributions to aid in financing
it.
The new paper is dedicated by the editors
to "a greater University of California, a more
meaningful student government at UCLA and a
truly vital student press."
The editors promised that the paper would
be distributed on campus as long as they were
able to receive approval from the UCLA ad
ministration. "Approval will take a minimum
of two days," the paper reported. They added

that in the event that "approval is denied, dis
tribution will take place at off-campus spots."
The editors announced in an editorial that
they did not intend The Observer as "opposi
tion to the Daily Bruin." They stated that while
they were on the Daily Bruin's staff they were
interested in "journalistic experience, campus
status, and many other goals," but that now
they would be forced to focus their attention
"on certain areas of thought."
"As members of the Daily Bruin," they wrote,
"we did not use the news page to popularize
our own outlook. We could not. We were part
of a monopoly newspaper and we fulfilled its
obligations."
"We have had to fight for a free student
press," they added. "Last semester, we lost a
battle in that struggle. . . . Now we have to
find a new battlefield or give up. We have
decided that the issues are too important to be
abandoned."
The editors concluded by saying that since
the "sanction, name and money of the ASUC
LA" would no longer be attached to their ef
forts, the responsibility of their statements
would rest solely with them and that they
would "not hesitate to take stands on issues of
importance to students and faculty."

of a monopoly newspaper and we fulfilled its
obligations."
"We have had to fight for a free student
press," they added. "Last semester, we lost a
battle in that struggle. . . . Now we have to
find a new battlefield or give up. We have
decided that the issues are too important to be
abandoned."
The editors concluded by saying that since
the "sanction, name and money of the ASUC
LA" would no longer be attached to their ef
forts, the responsibility of their statements
would rest solely with them and that they
would "not hesitate to take stands on issues of
importance to students and faculty."
Last semester at the University of California
at Los Angeles, the Administration issued a
directive changing the method of the election
of the editor of the college paper, the Daily
Bruin.
This took the election of the editor out of the
hands of the staff and made the choice similar
to that of electing a student body president.
Controversy over this decision arose both on
and off the paper.
Now, a group of students from the Daily
Bruin's former editorial board have come out
with their own paper, The Observer, in an at
tempt to avoid strict "Administration control."
Acco; ling to the editors, The Observer will
be ai&iributed free of charge, but they re
quested that students interested in having such
a paper send contributions to aid in financing
it.
The new paper is dedicated by the editors
to "a greater University of California, a more
meaningful student government at UCLA and a
truly vital student press."
The editors promised that the paper would
be distributed on campus as long as they were
able to receive approval from the UCLA ad
ministration. "Approval will take a minimum
of two days," the paper reported. They added

that in the event that "approval is denied, dis
tribution will take place at off-campus spots."
The editors announced in an editorial that
they did not intend The Observer as "opposi
tion to the Daily Bruin." They stated that while
they were on the Daily Bruin's staff they were
interested in "journalistic experience, campus
status, and many other goals," but that now
they would be forced to focus their attention
"on certain areas of thought."
"As members of the Daily Bruin," they wrote,
"we did not use the news page to popularize
our own outlook. We could not. We were part
of a monopoly newspaper and we fulfilled its
obligations."
"We have had to fight for a free student
press," they added. "Last semester, we lost a
battle in that struggle. . . . Now we have to
find a new battlefield or give up. We have
decided that the issues are too important to be
abandoned."

the "sanction, name and money of the ASUC
