Rambling thoughts while calmly waitin' for
finals to creep up and rap me 'tween the orbs.

Lover boys are tryin a new approach in
Burma. Legally. The Commies there have
passed a law saying young suitors can't whis
per them old-fashioned nothings in their dolls'
ears no more. The legal phrase is, "I'm deeply
impressed by your qualities as a faithful and
energetic member of the Party, and I wish to
wage the Party struggle with you." Also by
official decree, if the Burma boy is turned down
he's not eligible for another try for two weeks.
But he need not fear competition during his
waiting period. Should a fellow comrade try
moving in on the object of his buddy's affection
—bang—the famous Kremlin treatment. The
one with rifle and bullet. I know, but it's legal.

Hearts and flowers remind me that one of
our campus news competitors, the "Branner
Banner," reports that "Janet loves Herb,"" and
"Sue loves Jim." Stop the presses! We have
been scooped. . . .
I suppose the feeling is mutual. And you
can't blame the guys. My goodness, whatever

happened to the awkward young frosh women
of yore? This is indeed the age of progress.
Can't tell a freshman doll from a senior without
a Bawlout nowadays. The GOOD old days???

How 'bout a "Spellout" translating the unique
Stanford dialect of the king's English? People
can be classified like ball clubs. Some are win
ners, some losers. What's your score? Or are
you in a "panic" trying to find out whether
you won or lost (the game of life maybe)? . . .
Boy, do I know some real "losers." Them in
tellectual fellers who sit in the back of the class
and give out with the culturally accented gems.
You know the boys—"Well, professor, I see it
this way ..." Anyway, it's good for sleep-time.

Are you sleeping too much? Probably an
other of the horde of victims who have fallen
prey to that terrible malady which the Health
Service says is sweeping the campus. You're
not sick, you're not tired, you've got spring
fever. In winter? . . .
Speaking of sleep, I'd better get some, and
you . . . HEY, you—wake up, the column is
finished.
See you in the libe.

a Bawlout nowadays. The GOOD old days???

How 'bout a "Spellout" translating the unique
Stanford dialect of the king's English? People
can be classified like ball clubs. Some are win
ners, some losers. What's your score? Or are
you in a "panic" trying to find out whether
you won or lost (the game of life maybe)? . . .
Boy, do I know some real "losers." Them in
tellectual fellers who sit in the back of the class
and give out with the culturally accented gems.
You know the boys—"Well, professor, I see it
this way ..." Anyway, it's good for sleep-time.

Are you sleeping too much? Probably an
other of the horde of victims who have fallen
prey to that terrible malady which the Health
Service says is sweeping the campus. You're
not sick, you're not tired, you've got spring
fever. In winter? . . .
Speaking of sleep, I'd better get some, and
you . . . HEY, you—wake up, the column is
finished.
See you in the libe.
Rambling thoughts while calmly waitin' for
finals to creep up and rap me 'tween the orbs.

Lover boys are tryin a new approach in
Burma. Legally. The Commies there have
passed a law saying young suitors can't whis
per them old-fashioned nothings in their dolls'
ears no more. The legal phrase is, "I'm deeply
impressed by your qualities as a faithful and
energetic member of the Party, and I wish to
wage the Party struggle with you." Also by
official decree, if the Burma boy is turned down
he's not eligible for another try for two weeks.
But he need not fear competition during his
waiting period. Should a fellow comrade try
moving in on the object of his buddy's affection
—bang—the famous Kremlin treatment. The
one with rifle and bullet. I know, but it's legal.

Hearts and flowers remind me that one of
our campus news competitors, the "Branner
Banner," reports that "Janet loves Herb,"" and
"Sue loves Jim." Stop the presses! We have
been scooped. . . .
I suppose the feeling is mutual. And you
can't blame the guys. My goodness, whatever

happened to the awkward young frosh women
of yore? This is indeed the age of progress.
Can't tell a freshman doll from a senior without
a Bawlout nowadays. The GOOD old days???
