# BIG GAME BUILD-UP
## Cardinals Sparks Spirit 
### JAE HUNLEY (Third in a Series) 
A bonfire, fireworks, school
spirit, excitement — these make
up Big Game Week for the Stan
ford student.
This event, which climaxes Stan
lord's football season, is a major
project of Cardinals each fall quar
ter, and one of the busiest students
on campus is the Cardinals chair
man for this event.
Before registration is over in' the
fall, plans are already under way
for Big Game Week. The chairman
—in 1954, it was Marty Spangler—
has chosen the sub-chairmen for the
work and begun drawing up the
schedule for the various activities.
According to Spangler, there are
approximately live sub - chairmen
for the project. "I work with them,
their committees, and the whole
freshman class to promote school
spirit and keep things running
smoothly."
GOOGAWS AND GIMMICKS
Among the projects tiie.se com
mittees handle are the displays
downtown in Palo Alto, the bonfire
and firework:-: on the Thursday night
before the game, the distribution of
suckers or matches lor "licking" or
"burning" the bear, and the publica
tion of Stanford's non - aggression
pact with California.
"Previously," Spangler pointed
out, '"Big Game Week chairmen had
to worry about guarding the cam
pus and the bonfire from attack by
opposition forces. Now, we just
watch out for the bonfire and the
safety of the frosh who are building
it."
CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK
"The Cardinals chairman is kept
busy checking on things," Spangler
said. "Among other things, lie works
with campus living groups on the
house decorations and alumni home
coming which we have when the
game is held here."
Spangler mentioned that Cardi
nals and other groups working with
them, such as Rally Com, try to plan
, a full week of activities which will
appeal to the students and bring
Big Game spirit to a high pitch.
Also, he added that groups such
as Ram's Head and The Daily con
tribute to the promotion of "spirit"
with Gaieties and the Big Game
edition.
