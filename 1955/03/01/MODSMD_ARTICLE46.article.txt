# Busy Week on the Farm
## 
### 
This week—the last before Stan
fordites begin hitting the books—
will be a busy one on the Farm
sports scene. All in all, 18 athletic
events are scheduled for the Indian
teams. Highlighting the sports card
are three varsity baseball games,
and the Big Rugby Game with Cal.
