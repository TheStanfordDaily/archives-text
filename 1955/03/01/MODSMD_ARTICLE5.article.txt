## Compiled from Dispatches of the United Press Senate Postpones Vote on Tax Cut 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 â€” The
Senate Finance Committee today put
off until tomorrow a showdown vote
on the House-passed $20-a-person
tax cut to let Democratic supporters
reply to angry administration at
tacks.
The postponement, which also
could t;ive time for drafting a com
promise, came after two powerful
Democrats lined up with President
Eisenhower against the tax cut. They
were Finance Committee Chairman
Harry F. Byrd (D., Va.) and Senator
Walter F. George (D, Ga.), Dcmo

cratic tax expert.
With committee Republicans ap
parently solidly against the bill, the
stand of the two Democrats indi
cated the group will vote to reject
the tax reduction which House
Democratic leaders rammed through
Friday by a five-vote margin, 215 to
210.
