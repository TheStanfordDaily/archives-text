Positions available for qualified me
chanical engineers: The radiation lab
oratory at Berkeley and Livcrmore em
ploys over 100 mechanical engineers
engaged in the design of a wide range
of equipment for use in fundamental and
applied scicntific investigation. This
work includes nuclear and thermo
nuclear test devices and instrumenta
tion, high energy particle accelerators,
ultra high speed cameras, large scale
high vacuum equipment, devices for re
mote control in high radiation fields,
equipment for remote handling and
processing of radioactive materials, anil
accessory equipment for nuclear reac
tors. Organization is on a project basis
with closc contact between cpgincers
and scientists and the extensive labora
tory shops. Emphasis is not on design
ing tor production manufacture. The
woik calls for an understanding of
principles and ingenuity rather than the
application of standard practices. The
projects of the laboratory include prac
tically all aspects of nuclear engineer
ing.
Inquiries should be made to Mr.
James Johnson. Stanford Placement Bu
reau, or to the Professional Personnel
Office, University of California Radia
tion Laboratory, Berkeley 4, California.
