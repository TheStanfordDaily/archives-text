## Carter Talks On 'European Music Today' 
### 
By MARY ELLEN ROMNEY
"Europeans realized that mu
sic is one of the main means of
cultural propaganda," said El
liott Carter last night, speaking
at Memorial Auditorium Tues
day Evening Series lecture.
"In the United States, there is lit
tle realization of the obligation of
.society to the young musician," Car
ter explained. In Europe, almost all
music is government subsidized, and
the compose r knows that perform
ance by a capable group awaits his
new compositions.
Carter, who was introduced last
night by Leonard Ratner, Stanford
professor and composer, is on the
music faculty of Queens Co]lege in
New York at present. He has held
two Guggenheim fellowships, and
is a winner of a Prix de Rome for
his musical compositions.
Government support of radio or
chestras and opera houses leads to
frequent performance of contempo
rary works. "The public has been
educated to modern music," he said.
"The tastes of Europe arc generally
more advanced than they are here."
However, government subsidy has
its drawback:;, according to Carter.
"The danger exists of developing an
art. out of context with the people.
There is a general disappointment
with current European music pres
ently.
Carter played .several recorded
examples of the two major trends
in European music today: neo-clas
sicism and Shonberg's 12-tone tech
nique. "The latter prevails in Italy
and France." he said.
