# ANDERSON PLAY
## Staging Is 'Formidable' Difficulty 
### 
Maxwell Anderson's "Mary
of Scotland" presents the Stan
ford Players with one of their
most formidable staging prob
lems in several seasons, accord
ing to director Robert Loper.
The historical drama, which will
run in Memorial Auditorium to
morrow through Saturday, calls for
five separate sets: a waterfront,
three castles, and a prison.
"We have made no attempt to re
create these places realistically,"
Loper said. "Wo have tried rather
to capture imaginatively their mood
and their atmosphere.
"Our idea was to emphasize the
.•it? to I'm the vor.se and the action —
which are too often in historical
dramas almost lost in the 'spec
tacle'."
Not that Hugo Melchtone's sets
will be in any way austere. On the
contrary. He has made a liberal
use of colorful co:;tumes, tapestries,
and banners: of the pomp and pag
eantry inseparable from his Eliza
bethan subject.
