# Gimbel Lecturer Tells Symbolism Of Mystery Story
## 
### 
Most people relate a feeling of
: the uncanny to the common mystery
story according to Dr. Martin Grot
' jahn, Southern California psychol
ogist. Grotjahn's talk, one of the
Gimbel Lectures on Sex Psychology,
here was devoted yesterday to a
discussion of the mystery story and
its symbolic meanings.
Grotjahn describes "uncanny" as
a rediscovery of something one has
feared but. thought he had over
come. He illustrated this idea by a
story of a man who unexpectedly
meets a friend who lie believes to
| be dead. The man has a feeling of
! the uncanny because he has learned
J not to believe in ghostsâ€”a ehild
! hood fantasy.
In relation to the mystery story,
! the uncanny is found in the sym
! bolic meaning. The many varia
| lions of the simple theme involving
two people, one of whom is found
| dead, and the search for the murder
er by police and detectives, symbol
izes the child's fear of unknown
j sexual relationships, according to
Grotjahn. By reading the mystery
story, the individual is attempting
; to answer the question of childhood.
Literature revolving around a
! mysterious theme such as Hamlet
or Faust ofTer an outlet to repressed
j emotions in an artistic form mueh
as psyehonaalysis does scientiiical-
I ly, Grotjahn .said.
Grotjahn will lecture today and
tomorrow at I p.m. in Lane Hall at
| l.he .Stanford School of Medicine in
I San Francisco.
