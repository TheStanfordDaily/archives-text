concerned with scholarship, Wes
he is also interested in each
house member and in the house as
a whole. Wes emphasized that the
R.A. can be of great value to the

Any fraternity may submit nomina
tions for thee offices, but these will

I candidates, however, may be nom-
I inated at election time. Both new

the election, each house casting one

QUALIFICATIONS
The R.A.'s in the majority oi cases
are fraternity men themselves, and
are selected by the University after
being nominated by the individual
i houses. Each R.A. must be a gradu-
I ate student and acceptable to the
i University scholastically and from
j the point of view that he will have
I plenty of tune to devote to his job.
