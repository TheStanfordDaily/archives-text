To tlie Editor:
H..in,'-/ loyal rooters, we were at almost all of the
La ketball games this season, and we feel that the
Stanford Band deserves a big round of applause for
be ire.* there, too. They did a wonderful job this year,
and they hud more spirit than has been shown for
severfli year. Their uniforms, their jazzy tunes, and
their cm iusiasni ad Aod and excitement to the
that, otherwi.-e, could have been just an
other Stanford basketball t;amp.
I'he Band should be especially commended for the
UCLA series in Los Angeles. Of course, there were
r,.w Stanford rooters there, but one would have
thought that we had a whole rooting section judging
by the ycilin;*; that the Band did. We were fighting a
losing b !tie down there, and yet they kept their
Spirit U;. rou b the whole game even against a
rath ulting crowd.
We hope mat next year and every year such a per
formance will he repeated.
Stanford Band, you did a fine job. Thank you so
much!

1 should like to extend my congratulations to the
Stanford student body for its sportsmanlike and ma
ture conduct during the basketball games last wcek
« ii(l. and especially during la-t Friday's game at the
Pavilion.
La* I Fridny, The Daily printed an editorial ask
in' Stanford rooters to set an example of good
• if j r l man hip ; fit ■: the Stanford basketball team

had endured the taunts of the spectators at Westwood
when Stanford played UCLA there two weeks pre
viously. 1 was a spectator at both UCLA games, and
can honestly say that conditions as reported in The
Daily about booing and riding players and officials
by UCLA students and spectators were not exagger
ated and were entirely justified.
As a result of our complaints about this conduct,
Stanford was ridiculed by Los Angeles papers and
by UCLA as "cry babies" and "hard losers." So last
weekend, Stanford was on the spot and it came
through.
Spectators and rooters at the game Friday were
very quiet when either a Stanford or a California
man was at the foul line. There was some booing
of the oflirials, but this was a game which several
Bay Area sportswritcrs called the most poorly offi
ciated of the season.
Congratulations on showing to yourselves and the
outside world, specifically UCLA and the Los An
geles press, that you really know something about
and practice "ood sportsmanship.

To the Editor:
At the beginning of tin; present volume of The
Daily you stated in your editorial columns that .stu
dent cartoonists would be given a chance to present
their cartoons concerning campus activities. The
basic premise behind the publishing of student drawn
cartoons is fine, and we're sure that at the outset
most of the people on campus agreed with your new
policy, but don't you think you're overdoing it?
Dancing paper dolls live times a week which are
concerned with campus issues are a poor.substitute
for the professionally drawn cartoons dealing with
vital political issues which have appeared in The
Daily in the past.
There are no doubt enough issues of vital interest
on this campus to justify 24 column inches of your
editorial page once a week, but certainly not five
times: a week for the rest of the year. Let the student
cartoonists have their day, but let it be one day a
week instead of five.

1 should like to extend my congratulations to the
Stanford student body for its sportsmanlike and ma
ture conduct during the basketball games last wcek
« ii(l. and especially during la-t Friday's game at the
Pavilion.
La* I Fridny, The Daily printed an editorial ask
in' Stanford rooters to set an example of good
• if j r l man hip ; fit ■: the Stanford basketball team

had endured the taunts of the spectators at Westwood
when Stanford played UCLA there two weeks pre
viously. 1 was a spectator at both UCLA games, and
can honestly say that conditions as reported in The
Daily about booing and riding players and officials
by UCLA students and spectators were not exagger
ated and were entirely justified.
As a result of our complaints about this conduct,
Stanford was ridiculed by Los Angeles papers and
by UCLA as "cry babies" and "hard losers." So last
weekend, Stanford was on the spot and it came
through.
Spectators and rooters at the game Friday were
very quiet when either a Stanford or a California
man was at the foul line. There was some booing
of the oflirials, but this was a game which several
Bay Area sportswritcrs called the most poorly offi
ciated of the season.
Congratulations on showing to yourselves and the
outside world, specifically UCLA and the Los An
geles press, that you really know something about
and practice "ood sportsmanship.

To the Editor:
At the beginning of tin; present volume of The
Daily you stated in your editorial columns that .stu
dent cartoonists would be given a chance to present
their cartoons concerning campus activities. The
basic premise behind the publishing of student drawn
cartoons is fine, and we're sure that at the outset
most of the people on campus agreed with your new
policy, but don't you think you're overdoing it?
Dancing paper dolls live times a week which are
concerned with campus issues are a poor.substitute
for the professionally drawn cartoons dealing with
vital political issues which have appeared in The
Daily in the past.
There are no doubt enough issues of vital interest
on this campus to justify 24 column inches of your
editorial page once a week, but certainly not five
times: a week for the rest of the year. Let the student
cartoonists have their day, but let it be one day a
week instead of five.
