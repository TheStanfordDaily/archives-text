ASSU President Pete Bing sees time for only
three more Excom meetings this quarter, but
the pace of constitutional discussions is pick
ing up, and the proposed new ASSU Constitu
tion may yet be ready for the voters at the
spring quarter ASSU elections. Bing empha
sizes that he would rather see the Constitution
held off for another quarter than have a poorly
thought-out document presented to the student
body. It's a good point.
Excom will meet Saturday morning at 9:30
and again next Wednesday night, Bing said.
"But I guess we won't meet during finals
week," he added. There is still quite a bit of
work to be done on the Constitution.

the Cabinet and hopes to make considerable
progress toward setting up the financial struc
ture in the proposed Constitution. Excom has

ald Winbigler, who is also ASSU financial
manager, on the proposed plan which would
set up the office of Executive Secretary to han

dle policy matters in relation to finance and the
office of Controller to handle financial paper
v/ork. Stahr favors this plan, while piesent
Student Manager Bob Gable prefers a plan
closer to the present setup.
