Don't try to tell me about army efficiency.
I've learned.
A lev/ days ago While driving home from a
day on ihe beach at Carmel with a companion,
I decided to take a right turn at Fort Ord. We
had a mutual friend whose draft board had
caught up v/ith him, and who needed cheering
up, we felt.
As we turned in past the sentry station we
werfe motioned to a stop by a very grim master
sergeant. Somewhere in the distance a band
struc : ip, and the sergeant snapped into a
So did several other uniformed gentle
men "in the area.
In my very best Sherlock Holmes manner
I looked about, and noticed that the flag of our
country was being lowered. Immediately I
remarked upon this observation. My exact
words were, "See, the flag is coming down and
the soldiers are saluting." Apparently this was
not the proper thing for me to have done, as I
soon learned.
As soon as the martial strains of music had
died away, the sergeant approached with a

scowl on his face, and asked in his most Mc-
Carthyish manner, "Are you a soldier or are
you a civilian and you just don't know any
better than to get out of your car and stand at
attention with your hand over your heart when
that flag which means so much to all of us is
lowered?"
I managed a weak "no," whereupon I was
told next time to do better.
In the next five minutes I was reprimanded
no less than three additional times all in the
same manner for the same offense, the last
word coming from an MP who whizzed up
behind me in a jeep, jumped out and came
running over to me. He had & pair of hand
cuffs at his belt, and looked very menacing.
I was weak by this time from my brutal ques
tioning, and was expecting the worst, but after
informing me that "all males, civilian or mili
tary, obeyed military regulations on a military
base," he said that he always ran for the near
est building whenever he saw that the band
was about to strike up.
