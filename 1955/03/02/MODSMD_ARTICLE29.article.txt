# Cardinals Promote Stanford Traditions
## 
### JAE HUNLEY (Fourth in a Series 
Among the activities of Cardinals, the Homecoming float pa
rade, the High School Days for both Northern and Southern Cali
fornia, and the Hospitality Program play an important part.
The float parade is an annual tradition that takes place usually
before the UCLA or USC football game, depending upon which

is played here. In 1954, Art StaufTer
was chairman for this event.
Among the activities featured that
weekend are a rally after the parade
sponsored by Rally Com, house dec
oration, an aiumni luncheon, and a
dance either on Friday or Saturday
night or, as last year, both nights.
| PROMOTE SPIRIT
These dances are sponsored by
various groups not usually connect
ed with Cardinals. The purpose of
the weekend is to promote spirit for
the game and to welcome the alumni
back to the Farm.
High School Days serve to stimu
late interest in Stanford by giving
prospective students a "look at the
campus."
Two of these are held each year,
one here and the other in Los An
geles. Chairman for 1954 was Sue
Ross. She and the people working
with her provided guided tours of
the campus and of things especially
interesting to the people attending,
such as a tour of the Education
Building.
Also, the students were served
meals at campus living groups and
! were invited to attend the home
football game.
SOUTHERN VISIT
Southern California High School
Day was held in Los Angeles in
! 1954 and featured talks by Farm
) students and faculty. They provided
booths on topics ranging from sports
to academic subjects and answered
questions which students posed.
The Hospitality Program, headed
; by Barbara Klass, former president
of the Institute of International Re
lations, is designed to promote "good
feeling" between Stanford and other
schools and the football teams that
visit here.
This is accomplished by arrang
ing for "open houses" at various
j campus residences after the football
! games. Miss Klass and Cardinals
are also working on a program to
provide "hospitality" for other teams
which visit the Univeristy during
the year.
