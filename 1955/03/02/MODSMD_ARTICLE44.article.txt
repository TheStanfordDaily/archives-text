# Cards Clobber Spartans 11-5 on Sunken Diamond
## 
### BOB DURAND 
Stanford's varsity baseballers put together ten hits and seven
San Jose State errors to take their first win of the season yester
day by an 11-5 count over the Spartans in the Sunken Diamond.
Coach Everett Dean's nine was paced by top-notch pitching
performance of Ray Young and the slugging of Rich Scramaglia

and sophomore third baseman Rudy
Figueroa.
Young and Ken Brown combined
their pitching talents as their team
mates scored in every inning but
the first and third. The slow-moving
game, which saw 31 players used by
the two teams, was marked by 13
errors and 12 walks.
The Indians opened the scoring in
the second inning after Len Swartz
and Bob Gergen had drawn walks.
Young popped a Texas league single
into right field, the Staters com
mitted two errors, and both Swartz
and Gergen crossed the plate.
They added another marker in the
next frame when Sid Hall singled,
stole second, and scored on Figue
roa's line drive to right field. The
fourth run was scored in the last
of the fifth by Scramaglia after the
veteran shortstop had cracked out
the first of his two doubles and had
advanced on a fielder's choice and a
sacrifice fly.
The Tribe's big inning came next.
Brown, Swartz, Hall, and Scrama
glia all registered runs on a combi
nation of three errors by the visi
tors, three hits, and two bases on
balls.
Swartz scored his third marker of
the day in the next frame as he
talked, advanced on a balk and a
wild pitch, and came home behind a
one-bagger by Brown.
The final two Card runs were
made when Hall walked, scored on
a double by Scramaglia, who imme
diately scored on an error.
The Spartans racked up two of
their five tallies in the fourth in
ning. After Bill Rahming had
reached first on a miscue, Charles
Reynolds sent a tremendous 360-foot
triple to left field. Needless to say,
Rahming scored, and seconds later,
Reynolds followed on a sacrifice
fly.
