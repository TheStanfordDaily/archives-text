# Deseret Drubs Propagators in 28-19 Tilt
## 
### LARRY JENSEN 
Deseret easily rolled over the
Propagators, 28-19, in an intramural
thriller last night.
The Desdreters started off fast on
two field goals by Bill Bushmann
and a field goal and free throw by
Karl Winkler to chalk up a 7-0 lead.
Allan Peterson finally broke the
ice for the Propagators with a lay
up but Doug Denton came back with
a long one - hander for Deseret.
From this point on the teams traded
buckets until the end of the first
half, which ended with the Deser
eters holding a IG-8 margin.
The Propagators made their only
bid as the second half opened. Tom
Poulter hit a free throw and How
ard Poulter and Ray Cumming hit
two-pointers to narrow the gap to
16-13.
Deseret suddenly checked the
rally and sewed up the game with
a seven-point outburst as Winkler.
Bob Jefferies, and Denton hit from
the floor and Dick Finch dropped in
a free throw.
Play for both teams was loose but
the Desereters showed a superiority
in shooting, passing, and rebound
ing.
Jefferies of Deseret led the scor
ing parade with seven points. Team
mates Bushmann and Denton each
chalked six. Cumming hit for six
points to lead the Propagators.
