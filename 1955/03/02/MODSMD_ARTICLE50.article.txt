## 
### BOB CARMODY 
The Card matmen pinned almost all of their Santa Clara op
ponents to triumph 28-8 Monday night at Santa Clara.
Jerry Lowell started the Indians on the victory trail when he
scored a first period pin against the Bronco's Ed Kranz. Then un
defeated sophomore Pete Likins took Ed Tomney to the mat before

most spectators kne\v the second
match had started. Employing his
unique catlike attack, Likins quickly
rolled Tomney over and pinned him.
In the next match, 157-pound A 1
Laubscher turned an early disad
vantage into a surprising reversal
and quick pin. Then Jack Adams, a
mid-season addition to the Indian
squad, took a tough 4-2 decision
over Larry Mackel.
In the heavyweight division Don
Manoukian bulled a stubbornly re
sisting Ted Spinardi into submis
sion. The Bronc was one of the few
wrestlers who have made Manou
kian really work.
The only Stanford loss of the eve
ning came when Ade Eitner. coach
and senior star of the Santa Clarans,
decisioned Kirk Neiland. Stanford
also gave up five points because of
| Stan Hartman's illness.
Pete Likins returned to quickly
pin 157-pound Larry Burke in an
exhibition. Freshman Bob Carmody,
substituting for Stan Hartman, pin
ned Don Johnson in a 147-pound ex
hibition.
In other exhibitions, 167 - pound
Card George Whittaker decisioned
191-pound Pat Ellinger. Joe Harich
won in another 191-pound match,
and freshman heavyweight Jim
Newton defeated Dick Compisi.
