# Weeks of Preparation Needed to Produce TV Show
## KQED, Students, Faculty Combine to Give Series 
### 
There is more much more to a television production than
meets the eye.
The variety of students, faculty members end professional
cameramen and technicians who produce "Our Rugged Consti
tution" series every week, start their artistic labor two weeks

ahead of the actual show.
The "Rugged Constitution" series
is the only Farm-nourished tele
vision production in the past two
years.
WEEKLY WOItK
Students have been serving as as
sistant producers, and aiding in the
writing and production feature of
the show each week.
These pictures show a few of the
steps involved in the planning, pro
duction and actual shooting of the
program, which this week moves in
to its seventh broadcast in the 13-
wcek series.
A luncheon meeting starts the
organization wheels rolling two
weeks previous, the script writing
and art-map preparation go on dur
ing the week, and the creation itself
blossoms forth for better or worse
on a Friday rehearsal before the
show is aired at 7:30 on San Fran
cisco's educational channel 9
KQED.
KEIIEAKS.AL
The rehearsal itself i.s a hothouse
of nervou • activity. Cameras move
back, forth, and sideways; partici
pants squirm a little restlessly; floor
managers shout orders and pleas for
"quiet!"' while the control room, the
technological whirlpool that is the
show's nerve center, stands apart
and vigilant. %
When "Our Rugged Constitution"
takes the air after this preparation,
there's many a relieved face around
the studio. But the next show is al
ways right around the corner.

of Political Science; Siuart Hyde and Stanley T. Donner, of the speech and drama department;
Professor Stanley Morrison of the Law School; and Raymond Steinhardt, a student producer.

er retouching pictures to be used on the show.


CONTROL ROOM KQED program director Gary Merrins sig
nals for the cameras to begin rolling. On his right are producers
Dunn and Hyde, and on his left is a KQED program official.
Shown is a television control room monitor.


CLOSING THE SHOW—Stanley Thurnlan of the law school (ex
treme left) listens as Donner and Horn sum up the program's
highlights.
There is more much more to a television production than
meets the eye.
The variety of students, faculty members end professional
cameramen and technicians who produce "Our Rugged Consti
tution" series every week, start their artistic labor two weeks

ahead of the actual show.
The "Rugged Constitution" series
is the only Farm-nourished tele
vision production in the past two
years.
WEEKLY WOItK
Students have been serving as as
sistant producers, and aiding in the
writing and production feature of
the show each week.
These pictures show a few of the
steps involved in the planning, pro
duction and actual shooting of the
program, which this week moves in
to its seventh broadcast in the 13-
wcek series.
A luncheon meeting starts the
organization wheels rolling two
weeks previous, the script writing
and art-map preparation go on dur
ing the week, and the creation itself
blossoms forth for better or worse
on a Friday rehearsal before the
show is aired at 7:30 on San Fran
cisco's educational channel 9
KQED.
KEIIEAKS.AL
The rehearsal itself i.s a hothouse
of nervou • activity. Cameras move
back, forth, and sideways; partici
pants squirm a little restlessly; floor
managers shout orders and pleas for
"quiet!"' while the control room, the
technological whirlpool that is the
show's nerve center, stands apart
and vigilant. %
When "Our Rugged Constitution"
takes the air after this preparation,
there's many a relieved face around
the studio. But the next show is al
ways right around the corner.
