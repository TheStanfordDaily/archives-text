# Triolo: 1955's Scholarship Is 'Most Significant' Gift
## 
### TACY ANN SMITH 
Associate Editor, The Daily
"The class of 1955 is doing the
most significant thing, in its
Heritage Fund, to be done by
any class at Stanford, and is
making the most direct contri
bution to University welfare
ever made by a senior class."
Thus Associate General Secretary
James Triolo praised highly the
program of scholarship fund raising
now being done by the senior class
under chairman Herb West. "In the
past," Triolo continued, "the hold
over or exeses from the class treas
ury became the 'class gift,' and the
ful amount often was not known
until six months after graduation
when all the bills had been paid."
Triolo, who was president of the
Class of 1935, commented on the
fact that the gift left by his class was
a drinking fountain in Memorial
Auditorium. "It was a rather use
less gift, and the money could have
been channeled elsewhere. The leav
ing of 'left-overs' is not the true
spirit of the idea."
LASTING GIFT
The project was suggested by the
General Secretary's Office after in
quiries were made by the senior
class as to a significant and lasting
gift they might leave. The class
committee learned of the definite
needs of the Univeristy in the area
of scholarships, and decided to es
tablish a fund for annual scholar

ships to be based on leadership po
tential, rather than strictly on aca
demic honors or athletics.
All of the work on the project has
been done by members of the senior
class. There are nine student teams,
headed by Herb West, who have
contacted business men in the ai'ea
from a list of 35 firms given the
group. Fourteen have replied, ten
with gifts which now total $5,500.
Some firms have not been heard
from yet. The scholarship contribu
tions will bear the names of the
donors.

In calling the gift a "Heritage
Fund," the group had two aims in
mind. First, the idea that the sen
iors arc acting as a "holding com
pany" for next year's freshman class, (
the recipients of the scholarships, j
"It is (he idea of one generation
helping another," Triolo said.
Secondly, the "heritage" idea of
the fund is that perhaps future
classes will take up the idea and
strengthen it. Chairman Herb West
said, "We have begun a precedent
which we hope the class of 1956 will
continue, :-o that the fund will grow
from year to year."
To aid the class â€¢committee, Presi- !
dent Sterling sent letters, endors
ing the plan and explaining its pur
poses, to the business men selected
for contact for the fund.
CATALYST
It is hoped by members of the j
class that the project of class fund- [
raising for scholarships will act as a j
catalyst to stimulate alumni group
and corporation support, when they j
see that the students, too, are willing
to take initiative in this area.
Assistant to the President Fred- \
crick Glover commented, "I am ;
greatly pleased by the local support j
of the Heritage Fund as another tie
between the University and Palo
Alto. Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler said, "The Class of '55 has
done an excellent job with the pro
gram, and it represents something
important to the University in the
future."
