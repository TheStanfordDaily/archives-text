# Boyce Tells of 'Experiment In International Living'
## 
### 
"Making a friend out of a foreigner."
That is the basic objective of the Experiment in International
Living, said the organization's director, Gordon Boyce, last night
in his open talk at Bowman Alumni House.
Boyce was on campus yesterday to explain the Experiment

program to the student body in gen
eral as well as to the ASSU Excom
and Institute of International Rela
tions Ex-Board.
To make sincere friendships
abroad, Boyce explained, it is nec
essary '"to cut beneath the super
ficials that make for misunderstand
ing." The Experiment tries to do
that by sending groups of 10 stu
dents to small towns in various
countries, to live for a month as
members of local families. They
share in the lives of their foreign
brothers and sisters, and travel
through the country with them for
a month following the home-stay.
"The Experiment allows a person
to become intimately knowledge
able about one country, to love, re
spect, and admire the people of that
one country very well," he elabo
rated.
The Experiment has been in op
eration since 1932, Boyce said, but
"Experiment" is still the appropriate
name. "For each person who tries
it, it is a personal experiment. You
don't know whether you can acom
plish what you set out to do. It is
extremely rewarding, lots of fun,
and very hard."
"It is a deep educational experi

cnce to adjust to life in another
country. It takes humility, open
mindedness, and willingness to sus
pend judgment," Boyce added. Stu
dents who go to a country where
they speak a foreign language show
great improvement in their ability
to understand the spoken language.
After his talk, Boyce showed a
film, "The Experiment Way," de
picting a typical Experiment sum
mer.
Students who want further infor
mation on the program may write to
the Experiment oflice in Santa Bar
bara or may contact Cam Strong or
Rob Kline at the lIR, Bovce said. He
was introduced by Werner Warm
brunn, foreign student adviser.
