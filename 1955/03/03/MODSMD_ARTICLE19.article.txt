# Excom Discusses Role Of Student Manager
## 
### TACY ANN SMITH Associate Editor, The Daily 
The Executive Committee discussion last night centered on the
position cf the Student Manager under the proposed new ASSU
constitution. Two plans were argued before the committee, one
proposed by Harrison Schmidt last year in the draft constitution,
the other supported by present Student Manager Bob Gable.

+ Under the Schmidt plan, there
: would be an ASSU president, an
• executive secretary to the president,
• and a student controller. Last year's
: student manager, John Stahr. favors
' this idea, he told Excom Saturday.
Student Manager Bob Gable fa
vors a plan in which the ASSU pres
. ident would have working with him
. an administrative assistant, a stu
. ! dent manager, and an assistant stu
, dent manager. Gable told Excom
that he feels that the student man
| ager should work very closely with
' ! the president, and should have qua
'! si-legLslative and managerial pow
' ers.
TWO PROPOSALS
He distinguished between the two
i proposals by saying that under the
j Schmidt plan, the student manager
! functions would be limited to those
! of a controller only. In his proposal
, the controller would be a manager
as well and, with an assistant, would
; be able to assume this responsibility.
Both Stahr and Gable felt that the
| present system allows the student
| manager too much authority in
' : making arbitrary decision. Gable
would solve this problem by chang
' ing the present by-laws to give the
I president, an elected officer, this
j power of decision. In the Schmidt
■ plan, the executive secretary would
i assume this responsibility.
MOTION SIIiMITTED
A motion was submitted by Gable
' j stating, ''Move that in further con
| sideration of executive structure
! under the new constitution, the
: president have two direct assistants:
i the first an administrative assistant
(title yet to be determined), and
second, a financial and managerial
assistant to be known as the student
manager; and that he have an as
sistant to be called assistant student
manager."
A vote on the question was post
;: poned several times for further dis
cussion.
