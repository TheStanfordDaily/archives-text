The Surf Club, better known to
Stanford students as Old Barnum's
Ocean Room, has just been com
pletely remodeled and redecorated
in tropical surroundings.
Facilities of the Club include a
large dance floor, a bar and lounge,
a balcony surrounding the dance
floor, and a patio which is suitable

j will be the continuous music of Ray
Hackett and his orchestra and the
jazz of Rebel Daily. Also offered at
the dance will be free corsages for

Meanwhile, .sophomore publicity

unusual angles. Monday, a sign atop
a pile of snow said, "Snow Your
Girl, Take Her to the Cotillion."
Tuesday, a sign on a steamroller
said, "Impress Your Girl . . ." And
yesterday, a girl sitting on a stove
held a sign reading, "I'm Hot to Go
