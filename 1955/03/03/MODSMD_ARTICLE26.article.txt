# pipe down out there!
## ....an editorial 
### 
It's almost dead week, and during dead week
there are no regularly scheduled social events.
So where do the socially minded go for un
scheduled social events?
Why, to the Main Library lobby, of course.
And they'll stand out there and shout at each
other and laugh and generally raise a ruckus.
You can hear them very well all over the Li
bra 7. .Someone recently commented that
Standi is the only place he had ever seen
where so much noise was allowed inside the
Library.
Lots of people say they can't study at the
Library any more because of the racket in the
lobby. If one group or the other must leave
the Library, it should certainly be the talkers,
nol the students.

What can we do to insure a little more quiet
for studying the next couple of weeks? Some
one has suggested that the Library might for- [
%
bid all smoking in the building. Most of the
people who make the noise in the lobby are
out there for a cigarette.
Surely anyone who wants to go out for a
smoke should have a chance to leave the
books and light up a cigarette. But why should
he be allowed to interrupt everyone's studies
whenever he decides to interrupt his own?
So from the Reserve Book Room and the
Periodical Room and back at the typewriter
tables, one last loud PIPE DOWN OUT THERE j
IN THE LOBBY! and we'll all be ready for;
finals.


"YOU SHOULD HEAR THEM WHEN THEY AREN'T WHISPERING!"
