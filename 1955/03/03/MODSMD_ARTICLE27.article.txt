Well, sir, a brace of my closer acquaintances
have become pinned. Getting pinned is a sort
of a stop-gap measure to keep other gentlemen
from dating your date. It's being engaged to
be engaged, as they say.
At any rale, these two people are very nice
people a.'d I have this to say to them: Keep me
in mind, if you please.
Prelty soon, if all goes well, you will scrap
this pinned nonsense and get down to the busi
ness of being engaged. From there it is only
a short (albeit significant) step to matrimony.
And this is where Ol' Uncle Ric comes in.
' It's not that I like weddings. But I'm nuts
about big receptions. All that champagne.
And receptions take careful planning. Hors
d'oeuvres, glasses, beverages, napkins, tooth
picks. I'm an expert. The important thing to
remember is you can't serve bad champagne
-it a wedding reception.
Over the years I have developed quite a
taste for champagne and consider myself a
qualified champagne-tester. When it comes
time for you to plan a reception, I suggest that

you call me and make an appointment for me !
to test your champagne. I will select for you ;
(after necessary experimenting) a proper vin-'
tage with just the right taste and body for your :
reception.
Of course, I will have to be invited to the
reception in ordor to sample each bottle as it
is opened so that none of your guests will be
disappointed, or even insulted, by an inferior
champagne. So you can see there's a whole
lot more to planning the successful reception'
than meets the eye. You'll need expert assist- ;
ance and I'm just the expert to assist you.
One more thing, Jack (Jack's the gentleman
who got pinned), now that you're pinned, you'
won't be needing that little black book of yours
any more. Before you throw it away, I'd like
you to consider that it took you a long time to I
prepare it. A lot of effort and heartbreak went
into that little volume.
I was just v/ondering if, since you won't be
needing it ... if you wouldn't . . . ah . . . that
is . . . I'd like to know if I could . . . well,
anyway ... oh hell, forget it!
