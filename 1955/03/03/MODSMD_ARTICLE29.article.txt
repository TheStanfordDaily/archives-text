The new Rolf Liebermanri Concerto for Jazz Band and Sym
phony Orchestra is now out. It is as exciting as the name, and
the performers' names (Fritz Reiner, Chicago Symphony, and Sau
ter-Finegan band) would suggest. It is also one of the highest
fidelity recordings extant.
But it is going to disappoint people who expect to hear some

thing familiar. To understand it, ♦
! the listener must he familiar with ,
both the jazz idiom and the eontem
porary style known as "tone-row," |
developed by Sehiinberg. Usually a
j person familiar with one has little \
J feeling for the other. So the audi- •
i cnc:e may be limited.
Tone-row is essentially this: The ,
J 12 notes of the chromatic scale (do
j re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do plus the black
jkeys) are played in some particular
1 order, and that order is used all the J
way through. It is like a melody,
j but you couldn't sing it on a bet.
! This is the only structure the com
! poser has to follow. •There is no
[ tune, no key, no modulation, and
j no holds barred. But there can be
j rhythm, counterpoint (use two pat
terns at once) and harmony.
WEIRD, WEIRDER
Of course the "melody" sounds
! weird and the harmony weirder,
j The standard way to receive your j
\ first tone-row is to make a face. It ,
; takes getting used to. Jazz fans all
j over the country are now making
faces. What-Liebermann has done is j
j to apply tone - row's sound and
| structure to four familiar jazz pat- j
| UM'ns—jump, blues, boogie-woogie,
and mambo.
First the orchestra states the tone- .
row over a quiet but tense discoid. 1
Then the band, using rhythms typi
cal of the four forms, makes the pat
tern sound like a jazz riff, by chang
ing the time value on certain notes
in the row, and the instrumental
! combinations that play them. That
| is, the blues is played by a sax,
| boogie-woogie by piano, and mambo
by screeching trumpets.
Symphony musicians sound a lit- j|
tie sad when trying to get a jazzy ;
sound from their instruments. So j |
Liebermann specified that the jazz I
interludes be played by jazzmen, i
j The sound is unmistakably jazzy.
EMOTIONAL APPEAL
Emotionally the composition has
appeal, especially with the growing
rhythmic tension in the last third, j
But it becomes even more fascinat- 1
ing once you "hear" the structure
and understand the challenge — of
j wedding two hitherto divergent mu-
I sical forms. If such unions annoy
the purist, let him know that Bartok 1
; does the same thing.
To the untrained ear (mine), the

music of Elliot Carter, who is vis
iting us this week, sounds atonal
too. Even more than Liebermann's
jazzmen, Cartel' struggles to avoid
musical cliches and worn-out forms.
To Carter this means abandoning
not only familiar structure, but fa
milial- harmony, melody, textures,
and rhythm as well.
While L ie be r m a n n ' s drifting
tounds are saved for the average
ear by the excitement of rhythm,
Carter's never take an eusy emo
tional route. So Carter's audience is
even more limited. His music de
mands analysis. His structure and
rhythm are elusive and experi
mental, and his appeal is hard to pin
down.
NO MYSTERY
The appeal of Art Tatum is no
mystery. The great technician of the
jazz pianists is now at the Black
hawk with humming bassman Slam
Stewart and guitarist Everett Barks
dale. Tatum is the gentlest of jazz
men, but behind his arpeggios and
light phrasing is some of the most
original chording and the solidest
beat in jazz. 1 have seen a crowd of
Nat Cole fans fall suddenly silent
when Tatum came unexpectedly
into the Tiffany Club.
Among musicians his influence is
especially seen in George Shearing,
Andre Previn, Ellis Larkin, Cole,
and Teddy Wilson; Oscar Peterson
will leave the stand for him. And his
music is doubly amazing, for the
man is nearly blind.

j rhythm, counterpoint (use two pat
terns at once) and harmony.
WEIRD, WEIRDER
Of course the "melody" sounds
! weird and the harmony weirder,
j The standard way to receive your j
\ first tone-row is to make a face. It ,
; takes getting used to. Jazz fans all
j over the country are now making
faces. What-Liebermann has done is j
j to apply tone - row's sound and
| structure to four familiar jazz pat- j
| UM'ns—jump, blues, boogie-woogie,
and mambo.
First the orchestra states the tone- .
row over a quiet but tense discoid. 1
Then the band, using rhythms typi
cal of the four forms, makes the pat
tern sound like a jazz riff, by chang
ing the time value on certain notes
in the row, and the instrumental
! combinations that play them. That
| is, the blues is played by a sax,
| boogie-woogie by piano, and mambo
by screeching trumpets.
Symphony musicians sound a lit- j|
tie sad when trying to get a jazzy ;
sound from their instruments. So j |
Liebermann specified that the jazz I
interludes be played by jazzmen, i
j The sound is unmistakably jazzy.
EMOTIONAL APPEAL
Emotionally the composition has
appeal, especially with the growing
rhythmic tension in the last third, j
But it becomes even more fascinat- 1
ing once you "hear" the structure
and understand the challenge — of
j wedding two hitherto divergent mu-
I sical forms. If such unions annoy
the purist, let him know that Bartok 1
; does the same thing.
To the untrained ear (mine), the

music of Elliot Carter, who is vis
iting us this week, sounds atonal
too. Even more than Liebermann's
jazzmen, Cartel' struggles to avoid
musical cliches and worn-out forms.
To Carter this means abandoning
not only familiar structure, but fa
milial- harmony, melody, textures,
and rhythm as well.
While L ie be r m a n n ' s drifting
tounds are saved for the average
ear by the excitement of rhythm,
Carter's never take an eusy emo
tional route. So Carter's audience is
even more limited. His music de
mands analysis. His structure and
rhythm are elusive and experi
mental, and his appeal is hard to pin
down.
NO MYSTERY
The appeal of Art Tatum is no
mystery. The great technician of the
jazz pianists is now at the Black
hawk with humming bassman Slam
Stewart and guitarist Everett Barks
dale. Tatum is the gentlest of jazz
men, but behind his arpeggios and
light phrasing is some of the most
original chording and the solidest
beat in jazz. 1 have seen a crowd of
Nat Cole fans fall suddenly silent
when Tatum came unexpectedly
into the Tiffany Club.
Among musicians his influence is
especially seen in George Shearing,
Andre Previn, Ellis Larkin, Cole,
and Teddy Wilson; Oscar Peterson
will leave the stand for him. And his
music is doubly amazing, for the
man is nearly blind.

The new Rolf Liebermanri Concerto for Jazz Band and Sym

ter-Finegan band) would suggest. It is also one of the highest
fidelity recordings extant.

thing familiar. To understand it, ♦

Emotionally the composition has
appeal, especially with the growing
rhythmic tension in the last third, j
But it becomes even more fascinat- 1
ing once you "hear" the structure
and understand the challenge — of
j wedding two hitherto divergent mu-
I sical forms. If such unions annoy
the purist, let him know that Bartok 1
; does the same thing.
To the untrained ear (mine), the

music of Elliot Carter, who is vis
iting us this week, sounds atonal
too. Even more than Liebermann's
jazzmen, Cartel' struggles to avoid
musical cliches and worn-out forms.
To Carter this means abandoning
not only familiar structure, but fa
milial- harmony, melody, textures,
and rhythm as well.
While L ie be r m a n n ' s drifting
tounds are saved for the average
ear by the excitement of rhythm,
Carter's never take an eusy emo
tional route. So Carter's audience is
even more limited. His music de
mands analysis. His structure and
rhythm are elusive and experi
mental, and his appeal is hard to pin
down.
NO MYSTERY
The appeal of Art Tatum is no
mystery. The great technician of the
jazz pianists is now at the Black
hawk with humming bassman Slam
Stewart and guitarist Everett Barks
dale. Tatum is the gentlest of jazz
men, but behind his arpeggios and
light phrasing is some of the most
original chording and the solidest
beat in jazz. 1 have seen a crowd of
Nat Cole fans fall suddenly silent
when Tatum came unexpectedly
into the Tiffany Club.
Among musicians his influence is
especially seen in George Shearing,
Andre Previn, Ellis Larkin, Cole,
and Teddy Wilson; Oscar Peterson
will leave the stand for him. And his
music is doubly amazing, for the
man is nearly blind.
