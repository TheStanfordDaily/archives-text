# Con Home Drive Winds Up Cardinals' Year of Activity
## 
### JAE HUNLEY (Last in a series) 
The main project of Cardinals in spring quarter is the Con Home
Drive—five days of events designed to acquaint the students, ad
ministration, and faculty with the children in the Stanford Con
valescent Home and to raise money to support the Home.
Chairmen for the 1955 Drive are Paul Bissinger and Carol

Strauss. They and their committeesf
have already begun plans for the
Drive which will open on April 27
and run through May 1.
Con Home Drive is one of the
largest campus activities. Nearly
every person takes part, in some
way, in the extensive program. This
year's will include the old traditions
of the Strawberry Brunch, the Row
Car-wash, the King and Queen Con
test, the Carnival, the Work Day and
Barbecue, a movie sponsored in con
junction with the Sunday night
flicks, and the tournament program.
However, there will be changes in
the Drive procedure. For example,
this year the Drive has been short
ened from a week to five days and
direct on-campus solicitations have
been eliminated, as has Tag Day.
The carnival will be expanded in
order to provide more "appeal" for
the students and the whole theme '
of the Drive, according to the chair- T
men, will be to "arouse student in- i
terest in the Home instead of mere :
seeking of money for its support." j
The Drive, itself, has a long his- !
tory. It began approximately 25 ;
years ago shortly after the Home
was established. Originally it was j
just a work day, when the whole '
campus went out and helped
"spring-clean" the Con Home. How
ever, over the years, it has grown
to its present size.
