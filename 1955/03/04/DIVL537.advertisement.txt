Q but in thirty years of flannel buying, we've never v
() known a cloth that gave such satisfaction as Heath- (<'

a enough to drape and wear, and a finish that's a Q
K pleasure to touch. That's why we've made it P-T's a
\ own, a suit to challenge comparison, especially in >,

coal tones of grey, blue and brown.
