# Consul Speaks On Australia
## 
### JOANNE OLSON 
"The Relation of Australia tc
Southeast Asia" was the topic
discussed by Stuart Jameson,
coi;sul general of Australia, in a
talk yesterday afternoon at Bow
man Alumni House.
Australian foreign policy is large
ly the result of two factors: geo
graphical situation and historical
background, Jameson said. Australia
is very close to Asia, and unpro
tected from aggression. For this
reason, he pointed out, Australia
has a great interest in the affairs of
Asian nations.
Countries of southeast Asia have
a long history of colonial attempts,
Jameson noted, and therefore they
tend to be suspicious of outside ef
forts to help them, and fear ex
ploitation or domination. Unlike the j
United States, Australia is not sub- I
ject to these suspicions, since it is
a small and comparatively weak na
tion, and as the consul put it, "a
rabbit can't exploit an elephant."
Australia gives technical and
economic aid to new nations of Asia
through the Colombo Plan. It is
also a member of the Southeast
Asia Treaty Organization, and in
joining this group has promised for
the first time in its history to pro
vide troops in case of disturbances
which have not yet occurred.
"We think we have shown our
selves prepared to resist aggression,
Communist or otherwise," Jameson
commented.
