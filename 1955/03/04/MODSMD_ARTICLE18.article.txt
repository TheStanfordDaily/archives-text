# Next Chappie Will Be ‘Lurk’
## 
### 
Latest in the series of Stanford
Chaparral parodies of famous mag
azines which have included such
masterpieces as Pile and the Ladies'
Prone Journal will be this quarter's
contribution, Lurk, which goes on
sale next Wednesday.
Lurk, a parody of Look, will be
filled with such articles on typical
American life as "Youth on a Ram
page," an expose of what, happens
when teen-agers take over a city,
and a feature story on teens at the
beach, filled with subtle, good, clean
,fun.
The magazine will also contain
such Look-type articles as a fashion
feature on "miraculous candy cot
ton," a new wonder fabric, and a
do - it - yourself story, "Build-a-
Treen." Articles on food and "for
oily women" will complete the
Chappie's domestic section.
Lurk will also have a Photoquiz,
Letters to the Editors, and other
typical Look departments.
The price this month will be 40
cents, a dime more than usual, but
the magazine will have an extra 20
pages.
