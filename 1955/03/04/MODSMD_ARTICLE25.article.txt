Controversy is blooming at UCLA over a
letter circulated by Swarthmore College urging
universities to invite Russian student editors to
visit United States college papers.
This proposal was tinned down by the
UCLA Cabinet on the grounds that "it would
be of great propaganda value to the Russians
if it became known that UCLA students voted
to invite these people and the State Department
; e:ided to refuse them visas."
The Cabinet's decision brought about a se
ries of letters (both pro and con) to the Daily
Bi u.in. One leiier in favor of the invitation
threatened the publication "by an interested
group, of from three to four thousand hand
: lis attacking the Daily Bruin as a newspaper
ond the Daily Bruin editor as an individual,"
were the letter not published.
The paper printed the letter as "an example
o ,r the scope and implications surrounding the
invitation of Russian editors to the UCLA
campus."

suspects that, in view of recent uranium find
ings in California, that there may be deposits
in the Los Gatos area. "Anyway," the Daily
