Well, won't be long now till old man winter
quarter fades away. He gave us a long, cold,
and oftimes rough go of it, but he certainly
wasn't dull.
'Member back in January when the Greek
letter boys began their rushing program? Were
. ose houses bright then. Dolls serving refresh
ments, greeting prospective pledges, just stand
ing there lookin' purty.
Clue number one, pledge: they don't go with
the furnishings, the guys in the white jackets
serve the chow.
And how 'bout that rushing treatment? Clue
number two: look in those locked closets,
pledge. That's where they keep the paddles.
Men, we gained some ground in the ratio de
partment at last. Figures went down from last
winter's 2.53:1 proportion to the present 2.52:1.
Where'd we lose that .01 of a guy? Not much,
but it's progress. My research shows that at this
rate, by fall quarter 2004 things will be as Ma
Nature originally planned themâ€”l:l. Hang on,
I see a girl in your future.
Winter had its aspects of crime too. Remem
ber the night a blue convert was bounced into
a parked Phi Sig car? Behind him at the scene
of the crime the culprit left interesting goodies:

a pair of sox, one fcafer (that's a shoe, not a
fraternity man), and a champagne glass.
Guess the driver tired hobbling round on single
shod feet 'cause he gavfe himself up a few days
after the crash. Or maybe he was thirsty and
had run out of glasses.
Then there was "The Case of the Flying
Bandit." A copper was reported missing from
the Charity Drive Mile of Pennies. Just this
week the thief, a conscience-stricken pigeon,
winged up to the Biz School and dropped the
hot penny on a window sill. Stamp this one
"Solved," too, Chief Davis.
Basketball season saw the initiation of Stan
ford's own brand of jazz in the grand old man
ner by George Sheldon and his red-vested
floor-stompers. If George and the men keep up
with the two-beat we'll all be wearing raccoon
coats come next pigskin season.
For some of the lucky ones vacation was al
ready here. Thirty-five Stanford skiers were
snowed in behind the Sierras. Hope they took
their books with 'em.
Guess old Pops Winter treated us pretty fair
after all. But now he's gettin' ready to play the
Mr. Hyde role.
Finals.
