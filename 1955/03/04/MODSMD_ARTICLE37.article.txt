# Econ Instructor Praises San Francisco, But Says 'There's Nothing Like London'
## 
### EARL CILLEY 
Interested in finding out what
a Tynemouth-raised, English Ful
bright scholar thought of this
country and of the West in par
ticular, we interrupted eco
nomics instructor Joy Love while
she was correcting the results of
her sections' latest trial to ask
her opinion of the phenomenon
most representative of Western
life, San Francisco.
Smiling, she replied, "San Fran
cisco is much the nicest city in
America—there is always something
fun to do." But asked to compare
it with London, she was equally
positive: "San Francisco is wonder
ful, but there's nothing like London
anywhere—no city in the world is a
bit like it."
Miss Love has been in America a
year and a half on a Fulbright ex
change scholarship, which takes
care of the expenses she incurs in
coming over here and going borne.
Already the possessor of a Bache
lor's degree in economics from the
London School of Economics, a col
lege of the University of London,
she came to America in autumn '53
to enter the Economics Department
of Clark University in Massachu
setts as a fellowship student, where
she got the Master's degree.
WROTE ADVERTISING
Last summer she spent writing
advertising for Minneapolis-Honey
well Corporation in the Middle West,
and in September she came west to
Stanford to teach Economics 1, and
2 to Farm undergrads.
We asked her what she thought of
American higher education after
observing it nearly two years. She
looked thoughtful, then said that she
thought that while English students
who go to college (and only about
10 per cent of college - age Britons
are able to) are perhaps better pre
pared than the American high school
graduate, by the time the Bachelor's
level is reached both countries have

equally wcll-educated students.
"You sec," she said, "in England
you're forced to make a decision
about what you want to specialize
in at college by the time you're 16.
For, if you specialize in the classics
in college, it is supposed that you've
done six years of Latin or Greek
before you 'go up.' At home, once
you've made your decision, there's
very little turning back, while in
America you can put ofT deciding
considerably longer and thus have
more time to decide what your col
lege 'major' will be.

In her spare time, Miss Love plays
tennis and squash, and very well,
too, for she has a letter in each from
London University and was vice
president of her college Athletic
Union.
We asked why she chose to spend
her last year in the U.S. at Stanford.
She answered, "I've always wanted
to sec the West Coast, and Stanford
has a very good Economics Depart-

Mont—the best in the West—so out
I came. I like it here very much;
the climate is wonderful, the food
is so much better than at home, and
the relaxed way of living here is
really very pleasant."

and in September she came west to
Stanford to teach Economics 1, and
2 to Farm undergrads.
We asked her what she thought of
American higher education after
observing it nearly two years. She
looked thoughtful, then said that she
thought that while English students
who go to college (and only about
10 per cent of college - age Britons
are able to) are perhaps better pre
pared than the American high school
graduate, by the time the Bachelor's
level is reached both countries have

equally wcll-educated students.
"You sec," she said, "in England
you're forced to make a decision
about what you want to specialize
in at college by the time you're 16.
For, if you specialize in the classics
in college, it is supposed that you've
done six years of Latin or Greek
before you 'go up.' At home, once
you've made your decision, there's
very little turning back, while in
America you can put ofT deciding
considerably longer and thus have
more time to decide what your col
lege 'major' will be.

In her spare time, Miss Love plays
tennis and squash, and very well,
too, for she has a letter in each from
London University and was vice
president of her college Athletic
Union.
We asked why she chose to spend
her last year in the U.S. at Stanford.
She answered, "I've always wanted
to sec the West Coast, and Stanford
has a very good Economics Depart-

Mont—the best in the West—so out
I came. I like it here very much;
the climate is wonderful, the food
is so much better than at home, and
the relaxed way of living here is
really very pleasant."

Interested in finding out what
a Tynemouth-raised, English Ful
bright scholar thought of this
country and of the West in par
ticular, we interrupted eco
nomics instructor Joy Love while
she was correcting the results of
her sections' latest trial to ask
her opinion of the phenomenon
most representative of Western
life, San Francisco.
Smiling, she replied, "San Fran
cisco is much the nicest city in
America—there is always something
fun to do." But asked to compare
it with London, she was equally
positive: "San Francisco is wonder
ful, but there's nothing like London
anywhere—no city in the world is a
bit like it."
Miss Love has been in America a
year and a half on a Fulbright ex
change scholarship, which takes
care of the expenses she incurs in
coming over here and going borne.
Already the possessor of a Bache
lor's degree in economics from the
London School of Economics, a col
lege of the University of London,
she came to America in autumn '53
to enter the Economics Department
of Clark University in Massachu
setts as a fellowship student, where
she got the Master's degree.
