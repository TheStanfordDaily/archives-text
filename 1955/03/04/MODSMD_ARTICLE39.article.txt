# Suit Filed for VA Hospital
## 
### 
Additional steps for the establish
ment of the Veterans Administra
tion neuropsychiatry hospital on
Stanford land were taken Monday
when the federal government filed a
friendly condemnation suit against
the University for acquisition of the
site.
Under terms of its founding grant
Stanford cannot sell any of its land.
The government, thus has to make
a technical dodge by condemning
the property and then paying the
University for it.
The suit was filed in federal dis
trict court in San Francisco as the
government asked for 88 acres,
which is somewhat below the origi
nal estimate of 110 acres. No price
for the land was specified in the
complaint. The government asked
for a jury trial to determine the
value.
