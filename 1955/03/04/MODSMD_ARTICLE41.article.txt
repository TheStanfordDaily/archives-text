# How our 125 "dry holes" last year helped keep you on wheels
## 
### 
If you're anything like the average motorist,
you'll use about 690 gallons of gasoline this
year. And that's just a beginning. Keeping
you on wheels and supplying you with the
thousand and one "oil-born" products so
vital to modern living requires 2 gallons of
petroleum a day for every man, woman and
child in the U.S.—an increase of 58% since
1911. Helping to keep this oil flowing to you
is Standard Oil Company of California's
biggest, most expensive, least predictable
job. In fact, we plan to invest $200 million
during 1955 alone in exploring for new oil
fields and developing existing ones, to help
replace the petroleum you'll use.
Some 700 times this year, Standard drillers

will start bits spinning. As much as 16,000
feet of pipe may follow the bit before oil is
found or the well is abandoned. Either way
it's a costly hole: drilling an oil well may run
from $125,000 to over $1 million. And every
one is a risk—only 1 out of every 9 wells
drilled in the U. S. in a promising but un
proven area turns out to be an oil producer.
Yet new sources of oil must be lound to
keep our nation's supplies from dwindling.
Risking "dry holes" is the only way to find
them. So the 125 "dry holes" we drilled last
year arc good evidence of the job Standard
docs to help keep you on wheels.
Standard plans ahead to serve you better
