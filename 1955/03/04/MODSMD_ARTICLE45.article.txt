### BOB MIEROW 
Stanford's varsity baseball team will go through a rugged sched
ule in Spring vacation after engaging San Jose State and San Fran
cisco State during dead week. The Card horsehiders will open
their CIBA schedule during vacation with two tilts with SC's
Trojans in Los Angeles.
The Indians will travel to tackle the Spartans tomorrow and will

host the SF State Gators on Mon
day. After finals, the Cards will
host USF on March 19, Oregon's
Ducks on March 20, 21, and Oregon
State March 22 in non-league con
tests.
The Oregon series will highlight
the pre-league battles. Pacing the
Webfoots is George Shaw, great
gridiron and diamond star. Shaw, a
powerful hitter on the baseball
field, was the Baltimore Colts' bonus
choice in the recent football draft.
The Ducks are defending PCC
champions, having represented the
coast in the NCAA play-offs.
CIBA OPENS
Southern California, who will host
the Indians on March 25, 26, are
defending CIBA title-holders. The

Trojans have been established as
co-favorites with California in this
year's race.
"We consider Stanford's team as
a real contender this year, and the
fact that USC and Cal have been
mentioned as co-favorites shouldn't
bother us too much," declares Coach
Everett Dean.
The Trojans have most of their
lettermen back to defend their
crown. Stanford will be depending
upon several untried players.
'"Several new faces are on the
team this year," announces Coach
Dean. "We will be an improved
team in pitching and hitting, how
ever."
SPIRITED TEAM
"Great spirit on the team will have
much to do with its success," states
the Card diamond mentor. Ray
Young, all-CIBA pitcher, turned
down a bid to participate on the
Ail-American team in the Pan-
American games in Mexico City. The
Pan-American contests are being
played during the first week of the
Stanford season.
Coach Dean also turned down a
high honor in interest of the team
in not accepting an invitation to con
duct a baseball clinic in Germany
during the opening week of the con
ference season.
Young is expected to pace the
Card mound staff this year. Stan
ford's leading hitters early in the
season have been Rudy Figueroa,
third baseman, and shortstop Rich
Scramaglia. Catcher Len Swartz is
also a sharp batter.

Stanford's varsity baseball team will go through a rugged sched
ule in Spring vacation after engaging San Jose State and San Fran
cisco State during dead week. The Card horsehiders will open
their CIBA schedule during vacation with two tilts with SC's
Trojans in Los Angeles.
The Indians will travel to tackle the Spartans tomorrow and will

host the SF State Gators on Mon
day. After finals, the Cards will
host USF on March 19, Oregon's
Ducks on March 20, 21, and Oregon
State March 22 in non-league con
tests.
The Oregon series will highlight
the pre-league battles. Pacing the
Webfoots is George Shaw, great
gridiron and diamond star. Shaw, a
powerful hitter on the baseball
field, was the Baltimore Colts' bonus
choice in the recent football draft.
The Ducks are defending PCC
champions, having represented the
coast in the NCAA play-offs.
CIBA OPENS
Southern California, who will host
the Indians on March 25, 26, are
defending CIBA title-holders. The

Trojans have been established as
co-favorites with California in this
year's race.
"We consider Stanford's team as
a real contender this year, and the
fact that USC and Cal have been
mentioned as co-favorites shouldn't
bother us too much," declares Coach
Everett Dean.
The Trojans have most of their
lettermen back to defend their
crown. Stanford will be depending
upon several untried players.
'"Several new faces are on the
team this year," announces Coach
Dean. "We will be an improved
team in pitching and hitting, how
ever."
SPIRITED TEAM
"Great spirit on the team will have
much to do with its success," states
the Card diamond mentor. Ray
Young, all-CIBA pitcher, turned
down a bid to participate on the
Ail-American team in the Pan-
American games in Mexico City. The
Pan-American contests are being
played during the first week of the
Stanford season.
Coach Dean also turned down a
high honor in interest of the team
in not accepting an invitation to con
duct a baseball clinic in Germany
during the opening week of the con
ference season.
Young is expected to pace the
Card mound staff this year. Stan
ford's leading hitters early in the
season have been Rudy Figueroa,
third baseman, and shortstop Rich
Scramaglia. Catcher Len Swartz is
also a sharp batter.
