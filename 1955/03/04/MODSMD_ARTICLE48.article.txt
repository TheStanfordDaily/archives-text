# Indian Nine Whips USF
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
A listless Stanford baseball team
ground out an 8-3 victory over USF
yesterday afternoon at the Sunken
Diamond. After spotting the Dons
two tallies in the top of the first,
the Deanmen came back with five
of their own in the same frame.
After that, it was only a question
of how much.
The Stanford's only banged out 10
hits to the USFer's nine bingles,
but Card pitching was much sharper
in the clutch to provide the margin
of victory. Walt Pains and Dick
Jones combined to strike out 14
Dons.
Paine got off to a shaky start as
Chuck McGuigan singled, Bob Bay
less walked, Buzz Casazza singled
and Del Rossi doubled to left center,
accounting for two runs.
CARDS COME BACK
Bill Butler started on the hill for
the Dons, but got himself into
trouble and left the premises early.
He walked Mickey Holzman and Sid
Hall. Rich Scramaglia bunted safe
ly, and then Rudy Figueroa worked
the Don hurler for a run-scoring
pass. Charlie Falcone came on to
pitch for USF and got Tom Dandur
and to force Hall at home, but Bob
Evans cracked a sharp line single
to center for two x-uns.
Len Swartz followed with a double
down the right field line, and Paine
was safe on an error, but Swartz
was caught off third to end the rally.
Stanford added single tallies in
the third and fourth, while San
Francisco scored one in the fifth on
two infield singles, a walk and a hit
batter.
MESSNER TRIPLES
The final score came in the seventh
when Hal Messner, batting for Rudy
Figueroa, hit a long triple to right
center. Dandurand and Evans pop
ped out, but Swartz hit a Texas
Leaguer which eluded left fielder
Bob Braghetta as he tried for a shoe
string catch and bounded away for
a double.
Walt Paine had control troubles
throughout his five inning stilt. He
walked six and hit one batter. He
had no trouble getting the first
pitch in, but then seemed to ease
up and get behind the batters. Dick
Jones also had his problems but gave
up only three hits and eight Dons
swung futily at third strikes.
In the eighth the first two batters
singled off Jones, but he recovered
and struck out the two, three, and
four men in the visitors batting
order.

Paine. Jones (6), and Swartz,
Murray (8); Butler, Falcone (1) and
Ferrogiaro.
A listless Stanford baseball team
ground out an 8-3 victory over USF
yesterday afternoon at the Sunken
Diamond. After spotting the Dons
two tallies in the top of the first,
the Deanmen came back with five
of their own in the same frame.
After that, it was only a question
of how much.
The Stanford's only banged out 10
hits to the USFer's nine bingles,
but Card pitching was much sharper
in the clutch to provide the margin
of victory. Walt Pains and Dick
Jones combined to strike out 14
Dons.
Paine got off to a shaky start as
Chuck McGuigan singled, Bob Bay
less walked, Buzz Casazza singled
and Del Rossi doubled to left center,
accounting for two runs.
CARDS COME BACK
Bill Butler started on the hill for
the Dons, but got himself into
trouble and left the premises early.
He walked Mickey Holzman and Sid
Hall. Rich Scramaglia bunted safe
ly, and then Rudy Figueroa worked
the Don hurler for a run-scoring
pass. Charlie Falcone came on to
pitch for USF and got Tom Dandur
and to force Hall at home, but Bob
Evans cracked a sharp line single
to center for two x-uns.
Len Swartz followed with a double
down the right field line, and Paine
was safe on an error, but Swartz
was caught off third to end the rally.
Stanford added single tallies in
the third and fourth, while San
Francisco scored one in the fifth on
two infield singles, a walk and a hit
batter.
MESSNER TRIPLES
The final score came in the seventh
when Hal Messner, batting for Rudy
Figueroa, hit a long triple to right
center. Dandurand and Evans pop
ped out, but Swartz hit a Texas
Leaguer which eluded left fielder
Bob Braghetta as he tried for a shoe
string catch and bounded away for
a double.
Walt Paine had control troubles
throughout his five inning stilt. He
walked six and hit one batter. He
had no trouble getting the first
pitch in, but then seemed to ease
up and get behind the batters. Dick
Jones also had his problems but gave
up only three hits and eight Dons
swung futily at third strikes.
In the eighth the first two batters
singled off Jones, but he recovered
and struck out the two, three, and
four men in the visitors batting
order.
