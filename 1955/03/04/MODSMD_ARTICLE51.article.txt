# ON THE OV AL
## Card Tracksters Will Open Season in Five-Way Meet 
### LEE HANSEN 
The sun is shining. New grass
is poking out of the ground.
Spring is hereâ€”and it's track
season again.
Out on the oval, Coaches Jack
Weiershauser and Ray Dean have
just finished tl.eir first trials for
what they call "average" prospects.
Strongest men in the 100 and 220
will be Keith Brownsberger, whose
best times arc 9.8 and 21.4 respec
tively; Jim Sarah, a very consistent
9.9 sprinter; and Walt Garrett,
whose outstanding event, however,
will probably be the 440. In the 440,
in addition to Garrett, whom Weier
shauser calls one of the outstanding
prospects on the team, will be Larry
Spicer, and Myron Hollister.
The 880 hopes are being placed in
a sophcmore. Ford Sims, who ran
under two minutes for the frosh
last year. From the several possible
milers, outstanding prospects at the
present time seem to be Will King,
who has just returned from the
service and has a 4:20 mile to his
credit, and Chuck Strong, a junior
who has done 4:23. The same men
will compete in the two mile and
both men have beaten 9:40.
As usual, one of the outstanding
field events in terms of power is the
javelin. Four men will compete:

I Bob Kimbell, who has 213 feet to
I his credit, John Bugge, with 215
; feet, Ross Pyle, 192 feet, and Hank
| Roldan, 185. In contrast to this is
the pole vault with only one top
| prospect.
Another strong point of the team
is found in Jim Luttrell in the
; hurdles. He has done 14.8 and 23.5,
and is backed by Bernie Nelson who
is consistent at 15.2 and 25. In the
high jump, there are two returning
; lettermen, John Stewart with G-G,
| and Norm Jiles at G-4. Sophomore
Phil Fehlen iias jumped 6-3.
Al Cheney and Phil Brabyn are
competing in the shot. In practice,
they are both putting around 50
feet, although Cheney is capable of
much better. Discus men are Bob
Kimbel, who does around 148 feet,
and Kevin Cassedy.
Relay hopes are extremely high.
Weierhauser has a field of seven
men to choose from with two men
that have 48-ft. relay laps to their
credit, Spicer and Garrett.
While other Stanford students are
relaxing at the beach, thirty track
men will spend spring vacation
j training and competing in two meets.
On March 19 at 1:30. Stanford will
field a team against San Francisco
j Olympic Club, Fort Ord, Santa
Clara County Youth Center. On the
26th they will meet Fresno State
1 at Fresno.
