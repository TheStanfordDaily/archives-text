# Card Ruggers Meet Bears For Make-Believe Crown
## 
### MIKE McGINNIS 
Rugby, that off-season football game, is going to break loose and
display its best Bay Area talent Saturday in the Stanford Stadium.
The California Bears, unbeaten and untied this season, will meet
a Stanford team with just as good a record at 2 p.m. The contest
will be the first of two between the schools which will indicate

j the best rugby team on the Pacific
Coast. British Columbia, College of
Pacific, Olympic Club, and UCLA
! have all lost to either Stanford or
| California.
The Bears have three straight
wins behind them. They dumped
UCLA 17-3, and have a good lead
over Britis-h Columbia in the World
Cup Series play, winning two games,
12-3 and 9-0.
Noel Bowden has lead the Bear
scorers so far this season. The 28-
year-old New Zealander has ac
counted for 20 points so far this
season, due mainly to accurate kick
j ing. Along with this backfield threat
I the Bears have a huge forward wall
! which has been the winning factor
this season. Transplanted football
players Don Gilkey, (230), and
Harry Ghilarducci (240), are plenty
big boys. Other threats up front
are: Cliff Wright (220), Murdo Nich
olson (205), Mike Phelan (185), and
I Matt Hazeltine (205).
Bear Coach Miles Hudson calls
: his team at least the equal of last
! year's squad which won 9 and lost
: 4. The California mentor has a re
turning letterman in practically ev
ery position.
The Bear's big problem is the left
wing position. This important back
field spot could mean the difference

between a lot and a little yardage
for California in running and drib
bling play. Stanford will find the
Bears' weakness in the hackfield.
California depends on Hazel tine
for yardage on the ground. He is
talented at breaking loose and scor
ing trys (same as a TD) when the
Bears are close to their opponent's
goal. Bowrlen is a dependable drop
kicker and is liable to send one
through the uprights at any time
at distances up to 40, yards.
Stanford will field a lighter for
ward wall than Cal's,. made up of
Walt Eagle, Sam Robinson. Donn
Carswell, Dick Jones, Fred Frye,
Ron Bush, Dixon, Smith, and John
Stanton. These scrum-men will have
to move faster than the heavier
Bears in order to keep control of
the ball.
Stanford's coach, Pete Kmetovic,
said that "California' should be
slightly favored." We're a little
short with Gordy Yiung, out of the
backiield, he said,' but the scrum is
in good shape. "Speed will have to
make up for size in the front line,"
he emphasized. '
Kmetovic said that the Indians
can't afford to encurr any offsides
when the ball is in Card territory.
