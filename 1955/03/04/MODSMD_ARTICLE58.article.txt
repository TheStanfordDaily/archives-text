# Indians Seek Win Over Cal In Gymnastics
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
The Indian gymnasts will tangle
with the strong California Bear
squad tomorrow afternoon at 2 in
their second meet of the season at
the Encina Gym. In their opening
meet of the season, the Cards de
feated the Olympic Club of San
Francisco 43 to 34.
The visitors will be strong favor
ites, however, as they will have the
services of Dave Seed and Art Al
dritt. Both are Pacific Association
champions and Coach Chuck Kee
ney of the Bears will use both in
seven events. Seed is a pole vaulter
in the spring and rates along with
Cal's all-time best in this event.
The Indians, led by captain Russ
Royden, will attempt to break a vic
tory famine against the Bears which
has extended for more than 20 years.
Aside from Seed and Aldritt, the
Bear squad will include Bill Morley
in trampoline and tumbling, Wally
Gong in the side horse, and Ken
Morrison in the side horse and rope
climb. With the exception of Morri
son, who is a transfer and thereby
ineligible, this group will represent
California in the NCAA meet at
Westwod March 25 and 26.
Stanford will round out its sched
ule with two more conference
matches plus the Westwood meet in
March and the PCC championships
at Los Angeles April 16.
