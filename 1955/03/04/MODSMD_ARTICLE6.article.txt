Sandor Salgo will conduct the
Stanford Symphony Orchestra in a
concert of the works of Handel,
Bartok, and Mozart Monday night
at 8:15 in Memorial Auditorium.
The program opens with Handel's
"Concerto Grosso." One of 12 fust
published in 1739, it is a typical Ital
ian, late Baroque concerto, pitting
a small group of soloists against the
full orchestra.
Soloists are Doris Brill and Gloria
Vial, violins; Harold Hill, cello; and
Newman Powell, harpsichord.
Bcla Bartok Is represented by his
"Concerto for Orchestra." The Con-

eerto was written in 1943 on a eom
| mission from the Koussevitsky Mu
sic Foundation. The piece is in five
movements, and is so named because
of virtuoso treatment accorded
.single instruments and instrumental
groups.
Exerpts from Mozart's opera "Ido
meneo, King of Crete" complete the
program. Based on the Biblical
story of Jophthah. the work was
written by Mozart in 1781 at the rc
! quest of the city of Munich.
The concert version will feature
scenes from Acts II and 111. Soloists
include Ruth Roehcr, Leona Herd,
and Leona Gordon, soprano; and
Chorale will appear under the di
| the University Choir and Stanford
Chorale will appear under the di
rection of Harold Schmidt.
The concert is open to the public
without charge.
