# ‘Mary of Scotland' Gives Players 'Exciting Time'
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
Maxwell Anderson's "Mary of Scotland" may burn more fre
quently with rhetorical heat than with a really tragic passion, but
burn it often does and the Players have a fine exciting time with it.
Anderson is nothing if not ambitious. His theme is no less than
the conflict of human innocence with the worldly corruption that
may destroy but never defeat it. ♦

It is one thing, however, to draw
moral significance from a situation.
It is quite another to impose it on a
situation and pretty much reduce
the character in doing so. Because
the characters are thin and conven
tional, the play, for all the power of
some individual scenes, stiffens and
lacks any sense of mounting impact.
What is left is the sweep of And
erson's poetry, a frequent theatrical
excitement, an occasional sudden
white-hot fervor. This is quite often
enough.
Director Robert Loper has man
aged to get together four principals
who, whatever their other merits or
demerits, are at least able to handle
the language with force and appar
ent ease.
Leo Hartig, in particular, gives
the rather one-diinensional Bothwell
a great deal of vitality and convic
tion. His humor, his freshness, his,
above all, easy naturalness of bear
ing, are a breath of fresh air in a
play whose atmosphere, it must be
admitted, tends at times to get a
little close.
In the trying role of Mary Stuart,
Astrid Willsrud has dignity and con
siderable depth as an impetuous girl
who is also a queen. Her sweetness
of tone (perhaps occasionally slight
oversweetness) masks an intensity
that becomes, in her farewell to
Bothwell, genuinely affecting, in her
denunciation of the Scottish lords,
scathingly effective.
Queen Elizabeth is so much a
personification of sterile wordly
violence that she almost ceases to
exist as a person. Lois Phillips'
mustachio-twirling in the first scenes
probably doesn't, help much. Luck
ily, Miss Phillips becomes much
more human when she confronts
Mary in the third act.
Thomas Luce has a fine time roar
ing about as the half-crazed John
Knox, although some will find his
posturing a little overdone.
Director Loper keeps things mov
ing fit; a suitably measured pace, and
Hugo Mechione's atmospheric sets,
especially the prison scene, arc often
stunningly effective.
All in all, a superior production
of a play that proves again the
theatrical power of the spoken word.
