# New Bridge Being Built
## 
### 
Construction began recently on a
two-lane bridge which will span San
Francisquito Creek and link an ex
tended Willow Road with Alpine
and' Sand Hill Roads.
Oscar C. Holmes, Inc., Redwood
City, is building the 100-foot steel
beam and concrete bridge which
will cost $85,000 to erect. Santa
Clara and San Mateo Counties have
each contributed $25,000 to the proj
ect and Stanford will pay the re
mainder.
With the bridge running near the
third hole of the Stanford golf
course, the foot bridge between the
third and fourth holes has been
moved up the stream. The change
necessitated the relocation of the
fourth tee as well.
The bridge is expected to be com
pleted by Aug. 15.
Eighteen residents living in the
area where the new bridge will be
constructed petitioned the Univer
sity during the middle of this month
protesting the cutting down of some
20 trees.
After considering the matter fur- j
ther, the University said a change of
this kind would be too much of a ;
traffic hazard. Both San Mateo and i
Santa Clara Counties approved the j
original plan.
