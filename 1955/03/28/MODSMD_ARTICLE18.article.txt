Scott Foresman & Co., textbook
publishers, broke ground recently
for offices in the Stanford light in
dustrial tract.
Foresman will locate its new re
gional headquarters on California
Avenue adjacent to another book
publishing firm, Ploughton-Mifflin.
The $118,000 building will contain
10.000 square feet and will be simi
lar to the Houghton-Mifflin plant in
design as the same architect has
planned both structures.
Houghton-Mifflin will be housed
in a 6,000-square-foot office area and
a 20,000-square-foot warehouse. The
building permit calls for the expen
diture of $100,000.
Both structures are expected to be
finished by the end of June.
