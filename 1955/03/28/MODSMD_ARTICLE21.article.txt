## Employment Form Added

Registrar Harvey Hall expects
Spring Quarter enrollment
"about the same at last year—
about 6800 students" as regis
tration begins today at 8 a.m.
Students with last names begin
ning with L and M, who will start
the registration book pickup at Me
morial Auditorium at 8, will find a
new inclusion to be filled out: a
student employment questionnaire,
to determine the employment status
of students at Stanford.
The questionnaire, termed by Hall
"the first attempt in several years to
see what the Stanford student em
ployment status is," will be used
with a view to possibly increasing
the number of part-time jobs avail
able to students through agencies of
the University.
QUESTIONNAIRE
The questionnaire will be handed
out and returned with reg books.
The nature of the blank is such that
a special numbering technique is
used for answering questions; the
numbered answers will supply in
formation for IBM card files.
