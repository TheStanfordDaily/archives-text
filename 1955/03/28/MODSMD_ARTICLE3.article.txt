### 
Compiled from Dispatches of the United Press

CLEVELAND, March 27 (UP)
•—Delegates to the 15th annual con
stitutional convention of the United
Automobile Workers' Union (CIO)
will hear an appeal tomorrow for a
temporary 200 per cent dues in
crease to build up a strike fund of
$25,000,000.
Indications are that the 3,000 del
egates will approve the boost from
the present $2.50 monthly dues to
$7.50. The plan, as outlined in the
report of Secretary-Treasurer Emil
Mazey, will make the increase auto
matic and continuous until such
time as the strike fund reaches the
required figure. The extra assess
ment will then stop until the fund
drops to $15,000,000, when it will
pick up once more.
The convention in its opening ses
sion today heard UAW and CIO
President Walter Reuther predict
recession in the automobile industry
at the end of 1955.
