# Ghosts Got Your Goat? Try Tibetan Spook Traps

Bothered by ghosts?

Stanford inhabitants no longer
will be tormented by the haunt
ing creatures.
Spiegelberg has brought back
from Tibet 14 types of Lamaistic
ghost traps, each for a particular
type of spook, which are on display
at the Art Gallery.
This is believed to be the first set
of such traps to have been taken out
of' Asia and they are guaranteed to
relieve anyone in their vicinity of
all kinds and varieties of .spooks
from those who bring illness or ca
lamity to those who cause unfavor

able horoscopes.
Complete directions on how to
build the valuable traps come with
the courtesy of the builder, "The
Precious One," the Rinzing Lama of
a Himalayan monastery. The direc
tions follow:
1. Mount the trap on a roof (as
you would a TV antenna) in clay
into which ashes of the dead have
been mixed.
2. Surround this main trap by
miniature traps and effigies, pictures
of people, and animals painted on
wooden stakes. Be certain to place
tufts of wool at all corners of the
traps. This is to insure that the
spooks will be snarled in the traps
after they are attracted by the
whole display.
3. Once the trap becomes damp
the ghost is trapped. You can't see
him, but he's there.
4. Throw the damp trap, ghost and
all, into a chasm, a deep one, and—
poof! No more ghosts.
A warning, however, comes with
the Lama's instructions. Once you
throw away the trap never retrieve
it. Bad business. A few months ago
Prince Peter of Greece and Den
mark took home a ghost trap which
he found thrown into a ravine in
Tibet. Shortly afterward a minor
earthquake occurred.
Needless to say, all the traps in
the Stanford exhibit have never
been used before.
