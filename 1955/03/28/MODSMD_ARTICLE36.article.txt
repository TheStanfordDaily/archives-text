# Student-Faculty Committee Encourages Weekly Get-togethers, Department Clubs
## 
### DOROTHY CAMPBELL 
Members of the Student-Fac
ulty Committee have been en
couraging faculty members to
lunch weekly with a particular
living group, to hold more des
sert get - togethers at faculty
homes, and to form more de-'
partmental clubs, after a need
for such programs was voiced
by both students and faculty
members.
Already a few living groups have
invited professors to lunch with
thern, so that over a period of time
they can become well acquainted
with members of that group. Offi
cers of other living groups are dis
cussing similar arrangements.
"This way we can get to know a
.

few students well, rather than save
those superficial, unsatisfying con
tacts with many," remarked a pro
fessor.
The professors arc invited in pails
so they won't feci completely iso
lated. The suggestion was made that
three should be invited, but this
was vetoed by a professor who said,
"In that case the three would go
into a corner and talk academics
among themselves. If there are jut
two ,thc students will have an easier
time keeping them entertained sep
arately."
INADEQUATE FACILITIES
The luncheon plan was put into
effect when a professor bemoaned
the paucity of luncheon facilities on
campus and .spoke feelingly of the
inadequacies of a paper bag meal.
The idea of eating with a living
group appealed to him. "Even if we
have to pay for our own lunches."
"In my student days," said an in
structor, "it seemed perfectly natu
ral to meet a professor on Quad and
say casually, 'Come along home to
lunch with me.' Now we live in a
society where there is no longer this
facile opening of homes." Students
inviting faculty members to lunch
at their living group fills this gap
and re-establishes the informal at

mosphero that used to exist between
the two groups.

The Student - Faculty Committee
has also discussed the social respon
ibility of the living group for see
ing that the faculty guest is made
to feel at home if this luncheon plan
is put into effect.
"If a group undertakes to enter
tain a professor regularly, it is up
to them to make him feel consist
ently wanted," said a student. One i
instructor, wrongly informed of the '
customary time to depart after a i
meal, wondered, when the students !
kept sending in relays to relieve
each other, why the population was
changing so frequently.
FAVORABLE OPINIONS
Most of the opinions expressed
after these experimental lunches
were favorable. Varied reactions
from those participating were wel
comed.
The dessert get-togethers at fac
ulty homes also received an almost
unanimously favorable reaction.
Professors invited students to their
homes, in many instances as a reac
tion to the interest in the project
that the Student-Faculty Commit

tec had discovered on the part of the
student body. In some cases the
professors had speakers; others had
discussion groups.
A professor felt, "The central
problem is the general intellectual
atmosphere, or lack of it."

for such programs was voiced
by both students and faculty
members.
Already a few living groups have
invited professors to lunch with
thern, so that over a period of time
they can become well acquainted
with members of that group. Offi
cers of other living groups are dis
cussing similar arrangements.
"This way we can get to know a

few students well, rather than save
those superficial, unsatisfying con
tacts with many," remarked a pro
fessor.
The professors arc invited in pails
so they won't feci completely iso
lated. The suggestion was made that
three should be invited, but this
was vetoed by a professor who said,
"In that case the three would go
into a corner and talk academics
among themselves. If there are jut
two ,thc students will have an easier
time keeping them entertained sep
arately."
INADEQUATE FACILITIES
The luncheon plan was put into
effect when a professor bemoaned
the paucity of luncheon facilities on
campus and .spoke feelingly of the
inadequacies of a paper bag meal.
The idea of eating with a living
group appealed to him. "Even if we
have to pay for our own lunches."
"In my student days," said an in
structor, "it seemed perfectly natu
ral to meet a professor on Quad and
say casually, 'Come along home to
lunch with me.' Now we live in a
society where there is no longer this
facile opening of homes." Students
inviting faculty members to lunch
at their living group fills this gap
and re-establishes the informal at

mosphero that used to exist between
the two groups.

The Student - Faculty Committee
has also discussed the social respon
ibility of the living group for see
ing that the faculty guest is made
to feel at home if this luncheon plan
is put into effect.
"If a group undertakes to enter
tain a professor regularly, it is up
to them to make him feel consist
ently wanted," said a student. One i
instructor, wrongly informed of the '
customary time to depart after a i
meal, wondered, when the students !
kept sending in relays to relieve
each other, why the population was
changing so frequently.
FAVORABLE OPINIONS
Most of the opinions expressed
after these experimental lunches
were favorable. Varied reactions
from those participating were wel
comed.
The dessert get-togethers at fac
ulty homes also received an almost
unanimously favorable reaction.
Professors invited students to their
homes, in many instances as a reac
tion to the interest in the project
that the Student-Faculty Commit

tec had discovered on the part of the
student body. In some cases the
professors had speakers; others had
discussion groups.
A professor felt, "The central
problem is the general intellectual
atmosphere, or lack of it."
