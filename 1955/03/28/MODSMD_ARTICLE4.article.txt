# Knowland Opposes Eisenhower Draft
## 
### 
WASHINGTON—Senate Republi
can Leader William F. Knowland
today came out firmly against any
attempt to draft President Eisen
hower for re-election if the chief

executive is reluctant to run again.
Knowland disagreed with Vice-
President Richard M. Nixon's recent
statement that the GOP is not
strong enough to elect a President
next year without such a candidate
as Mr. Eisenhower.
Knowland appeared on the CBS
television program, ''Face the Na
tion." He said the GOP candidate
must be ready for a "hard-fought
campaign" because the 1956 Presi
dential race is going to be "one of
the most vigorous campaigns in the
history of our political life."
He said he does not believe the
President will be a candidate "if he
is reluctant" at convention time. If
Mr. Eisenhower becomes a candi
date, he said, the President "will
go in on the basis that he believes
in an active and vigorous cam
paign."
