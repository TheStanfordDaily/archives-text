# Germany to Start Preparing Army
## 
### 
BONNâ€”The first division of West
Germany's 500,000-man army will
be ready for action in about 18
months, but it will take two and
one-half to three years to recruit,
equip, and train the entire force,
defense officials said today.
They estimated that about 130,000
young Germans will volunteer for
military service. The other 370,000
troops will be drafted.
The West German parliament al
ready has ratified rearmament, but
16 bills covering various details of
the process must be passed before
the first soldier dons his uniform. It
probably will take six months to get
the entire program through parlia
ment.
