### 
No existing Palo Alto shopping
district will be damaged by devel
opment of the Stanford Regional
Shopping Center, in the opinion of
Linn Winterbotham,
ager of the Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce.
In a talk to the Palo Alio Lions
Club, Winterbotham said that the
shopping center will draw trade
from at least a 20-mile radius, and
some of the customers are bound to
"rub oft" on the Palo Alto shopping
areas.
