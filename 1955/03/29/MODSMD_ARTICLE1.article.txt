A total of 4,495 men and 1,773 women registered yesterday, an
increase of 92. and 13 respectively over last year. A ratio of men

to women of 2.53 to I is indicated.
Last spring's registration showed a
2.50 to I ratio. Hall suggested that,
there probably would not be more
students at Stanford this quarter
than last spring. It is his opinion
that, there will he fewer late regis
trations this year.
Students who register late may
pick up their books at the Regis
trar's Information Office, Room
111-A, Inner Quad, according to
Hall. Although the registration pro
cess will not take place in the Pa
vilion, students who register late
should follow the same steps as out
lined in the Time Schedule for reg
ular registration.
Fees may be paid at the Cashier's
Office and the completed registra
tion book may be returned to the
Registrar's Office.
Today and tomorrow the fine for
late registration will be $2. After
tomorrow and until Monday, April
5, the fee will be $5. After April. 5
and until April 13, the fine will be
$10. Students may not register after
April 18. according to the Registrar's
Office. Registration books taken out
yesterday, but not returned, arc sub
ject to the same fees for late filing.
The official study list card re
ceived at the conclusion of registra
tion, together with class cards ob
tained from instructors on the first
day of classes, may be filed at the
Registrar's Office during the first
two weeks of the quarter. The dead
line for filing these cards will be
Friday, April 8.


BUT NEXT QUARTER THE GRADES'LL BE DIFFERENTâ€”The traditional reg lines grow long as
students receive their spring reg books, snatch a hasty glance at the grades, and vow that next
quarter something will have to be done to those C's and D's. But then it's spring quarter . .. Lake
Lag . . . the beach . . . and well, maybe it'll be easier to exert that little bit of extra effort next fall
quarter.
