## Med School Profs Fight Legislation 
### 
Sixteen doctors at the Stan-1
ford Medical School in San Fran
cisco have joined in a recent
movement led by Bay Area phy
sicians to fight pending State
legislation which they believe
would restrict their Constitution
al rights.
The group of 44 doctors launched
their protest movement, by sending
letters to all doctors in the state
suggesting that they write to the
Legislaure and protest the pending
bill.
The legislation, termed by Asso
ciate Medical Dean Jay W. Smith as
the kind "very likely to be declared
unconstitutional," would revoke the
professional license of any person
refusing to testify before Congres
sional, state, or local investigating
committees.
Two such bills are now before the
Legislature in Sacramento.
BURNS BILL
One bill, introduced by State Sen
ator Hugh M. Burns, would require
that a person's professional license
be revoked if he failed to answer
questions relating to membership
in subversive organizations before
Congressional or state un-American
activities committees.
The second bill, introduced into
the Assembly by Charles E. Chapel,
says that a professional license shall
be revoked for failure to testify in
any executive, legislative, or .judi
cial proceedings whether on the fed
eral, state, or local levels.
CIIAPEL BILL
The Chapel bill is particularly dis
tasteful to doctors because it inter
feres with the rights of private com
munication between the doctor and
patient, Dr. Smith pointed out. Psy
chiatric physicians especially object
because they believe it their privi
lege and duty not to divulge conver
sation .that passes between them and
their subjects.
Among the 1(5 Stanford doctors
signing the letter were Associate
Medical Dean Jay Smith; Emile
Holman, emeritus head of the De
partment of Surgery; Alvin J. Cox,
head of the Department of Pathol
ogy; Ludwig Enge, emeritus profes
or of gynecology; R. R. Newell,
professor of radiology; Charles Mc-
Lennan. professor of gynecology;
and Rodney Beard, professor of pub
lic health.
The bills are aimed not only at
physicians, but. would also affect
lawyers, salesmen, accountants, and
other persons licensed or registered
by the state. The bill would include
these persons "in a special group to
whom certain privileges accorded by
the Constitution of the United States
do not apply."
PROTEST LETTER
The protest letter declared that
"the independence and respect of
the medical profession are at stake"
and that doctors must "'make their
opposition known before it is too
late."
"This legislation," the letter stated,
"diverges widely from the principles
on which this country was founded.
They single out particular groups of
individuals and offer them the
choice of losing their means of live
lihood or of renouncing their consti
tutional rights."

the Assembly by Charles E. Chapel,
says that a professional license shall
be revoked for failure to testify in
any executive, legislative, or .judi
cial proceedings whether on the fed
eral, state, or local levels.
CIIAPEL BILL
The Chapel bill is particularly dis
tasteful to doctors because it inter
feres with the rights of private com
munication between the doctor and
patient, Dr. Smith pointed out. Psy
chiatric physicians especially object
because they believe it their privi
lege and duty not to divulge conver
sation .that passes between them and
their subjects.
Among the 1(5 Stanford doctors
signing the letter were Associate
Medical Dean Jay Smith; Emile
Holman, emeritus head of the De
partment of Surgery; Alvin J. Cox,
head of the Department of Pathol
ogy; Ludwig Enge, emeritus profes
or of gynecology; R. R. Newell,
professor of radiology; Charles Mc-
Lennan. professor of gynecology;
and Rodney Beard, professor of pub
lic health.
The bills are aimed not only at
physicians, but. would also affect
lawyers, salesmen, accountants, and
other persons licensed or registered
by the state. The bill would include
these persons "in a special group to
whom certain privileges accorded by
the Constitution of the United States
do not apply."
PROTEST LETTER
The protest letter declared that
"the independence and respect of
the medical profession are at stake"
and that doctors must "'make their
opposition known before it is too
late."
"This legislation," the letter stated,
"diverges widely from the principles
on which this country was founded.
They single out particular groups of
individuals and offer them the
choice of losing their means of live
lihood or of renouncing their consti
tutional rights."
Sixteen doctors at the Stan-1
ford Medical School in San Fran
cisco have joined in a recent
movement led by Bay Area phy
sicians to fight pending State
legislation which they believe
would restrict their Constitution
al rights.
The group of 44 doctors launched
their protest movement, by sending
letters to all doctors in the state
suggesting that they write to the
Legislaure and protest the pending
bill.
The legislation, termed by Asso
ciate Medical Dean Jay W. Smith as
the kind "very likely to be declared
unconstitutional," would revoke the
professional license of any person
refusing to testify before Congres
sional, state, or local investigating
committees.
Two such bills are now before the
Legislature in Sacramento.
BURNS BILL
One bill, introduced by State Sen
ator Hugh M. Burns, would require
that a person's professional license
be revoked if he failed to answer
questions relating to membership
in subversive organizations before
Congressional or state un-American
activities committees.
The second bill, introduced into
the Assembly by Charles E. Chapel,
says that a professional license shall
be revoked for failure to testify in
any executive, legislative, or .judi
cial proceedings whether on the fed
eral, state, or local levels.
