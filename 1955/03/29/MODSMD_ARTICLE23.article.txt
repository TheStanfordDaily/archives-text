The Main Library will close its loan desk,
the Reserve Book Room, and the Western Civ
ilization Library during meal hours this quar
ter and next, and the Stanford community is
asking "Why?"
The library tells us why: "To conserve li
brary funds and yet maintain adequate staff."
That's a gentle way of putting a tough problem:
the library doesn't have enough money.
So no one else has money around the Uni
versity either, you say, but the real pressure of
lack of funds is felt when it hits the library.
You don't have to think very long before you
realize how many of your courses depend on
books you find at the library, and how much
of your study tinje you spend there. A Uni
versity which utilizes research and individual

work to the extent that Stanford does is of
necessity limited in the quality of its curricu
lum by the quality of its library.
That's why we wonder why the people who
give money to the University don't think of the
library more often as they give.
That's why we're surprised to learn that in
one year not long ago only four per cent of
total University operating expenditures were
spent on the library, a figure lower in that year
than those recorded at UCLA, Oregon, Cali
fornia, USC, and Washington on the Pacific
Coast alone.
That's why when we learn that the library
must curtail service at three key points in its
operating setup by three hours a day, we
think that it is time for action—constructive ac
tion—to bolster library finances.
