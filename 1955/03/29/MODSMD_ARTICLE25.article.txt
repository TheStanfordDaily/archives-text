Spring.
Spring, when the flowers bloom, tra-la. And
the girlies . . . ah-ha. But the grades . . .
'Twas by the shores of Lake Lagunita that I
met her. A mermaid with an M.A. in biology.
Being in the "like-a-fish" type swimming cate
gory I struck it off fine with her and soon . . .
well, it was spring.
But, unfortunately, our afternoons together
were being interrupted, by, of all things, my
Bio 1 lab.
"Why," quoth she, "go to that stuffy old bio
lab when T, the mermaid of your dreams, can
give you excellent instruction here, on the lake,
under this beautiful spring sun?"
Why, indeed? thought I.
The perfect solution! But wait a minute, bud
dy, wait just a little minute.
She tutored me and she tutored me till I
knew bio backwards and forwards and for
wards and backwards. Then came the fatal
final.

I took the gas.
From the beginning of that spring quarter
I hadn't shown in class, for at Lag I had the
absolute mostest of instructors. How was I to
know the difference between Marine Biology
and that stuff in Bio 1? My nautical doll didn't.
She sure knew 'bout that sea bio, but from
nothin' did Miss Mermaid know of Bio 1.
The prof knew the difference.
And that is why, buddy, you see me each
afternoon joyfully splashing in the lake with
my li'l mermaid queen, patiently waitin' for
biological progress to come to the Farm.
When Marine Biology is finally made the
lower division requirement in place of Bio 1
I'll make it out of here. My goodness, I've got
450 units in already. Just need that lab science.
Till then, who wants to leave anyway?
Ever been pinned to a mermaid?
