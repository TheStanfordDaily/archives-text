Lec Brown e nd his "Band of Renown," voted America's number

week to play for the Junior Prom on Friday, April 15. at Castle
wood Country Club,
The 18-piece group, under the dir -cii n of the composer of

''Sentimental Journey," has long

ments at the Hollywood Paladium.
Polls which have named Brown
iumber one band include those con
ducted by "Downbeat" magazine,
■'Billboard" magazine, "Orchestra
World," and major national disc
jockey polls.
The class of '56 is planning the
prom as a "Sentimental Journey,"
creating the atmosphere, according
to committee chairmen, with the
combination of the Old California
architecture of Castlewood Country
Club and the popular music of the
"Band of Renown."
Work began on the prom early in
fall quarter, and many bands were
contacted. Brown was selected, ac
cording to general chairman Jim
Pingree, because of his nation-wide
popularity and his danceable music,
which fits the atmosphere associated
with the Prom.
Featured with the Brown band
are Brown's younger brother,
"Stumpy" Brown, and comedy vo
calist Butch Stone, who have a com
edy routine; singe r<-trombonist Ray
Sims; and vocalist Jo Ann Greer.
Miss Greer has also appeared with
Freddie SlacK, Sonnle Burke, and
Ray Anthony, and has sung for
many stars in films, such as for Rita
Hayworth in "Affair in Trinidad"
and "Miss Sadie Thompson."
Brown's music is described as
"sparkling," varying from strong

♦ -
bra : :ul explosive cymbal work to
relaxed and easy rhythm in the en
semble work, which constitutes an
extensive part of the band's reper
toire.
The "Band of Renown" began in
li)''G at Duke University, when
Brov:n became the leader of the
campus band. According to Brown,
he knew then that America loved to
dance and listen to smooth music.
So, says Brown, "'I try to play
danceable as well as listenable mu
sic.
Five years on the Bob Hope Show,
plus travel in.", the armed forces cir
cuit duriiv, that tim< with Hope, es
tablished ttie fact that Brown's ag
gregation has played before larger
audience; than any other band in
I the country. The last trip with Hope
was to Korea, covering some 25,000
mile:; to entertain 500,000 service
men in the Orient.
Castlewood Country Club is lo
acted near Pleasanton, about a 45-
minut< drive from campus. There is

ballroom, which has an extra wing
and an outdoor patio adjacent, as
suring plenty of dance room for the
1,000 couples for which the prom
