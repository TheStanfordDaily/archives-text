# Any Jumping Frogs Here?
## 
### DICK MEISTER 
I - there a jumping, frog in the
house? If so, grab him quick 'cause
he may be worth $1,000.
Straight from Frogtown in Angels
Camp comes this happy news; Stan
ford students have been issued an
invitation to'participate in the fa
mous Calaveras Fair and Jumping
Frog Jubilee to be held there May
20, 21, and 22.
To commemorate the 28th year of
the contests, which honor Mark
Twain's "Jumping Frog of Cala
veras" yarn, a new intercollegiate
frog jumping contest has been de
vised.
Carl T. Mills, veteran manager of
the event, has announced that col
legiate entries in the contest are eli
gible to compete for grand prize
money totaling more than $1,500 and
may also win a .special intercolle
giate trophy.
As Mills says, "frog jumping Is the
world's most unusual sport." The

theory behind it is catch a frog, en- j
ter him, and pray he'll jump quickâ€” !
and far."
Last year's winner, "Lucky La
ger," hopped 1G feet 10 inches. This
fvat broke the world's record ami
gave the frog's owner a dandy $1,000.
According to Mills, Stanford is al
lowed three official entries in the j
intercollegiate division and as many j
as they want in open competition.
The b< :t method for determining
Stanford's most talented frogs would j
seem to be on-campus run-offs, or j
jump-off as the case may be.
fii'rt combing Lake Lag for the |
best jumper.; to carry the colors of I
tlu t!td and White at Frogtown and !
bring home that trophy (and tht>
$1,000) to SU.
Hint: Check Twain's story for the
best methods; there was a real
handy man with frogs.
