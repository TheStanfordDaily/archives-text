# Cards Attempt Comeback Against COP Baseballers
## 
### 
Stanford will attempt to get back on the winning trail this after
noon when they meet College of the Pacific at 3:15 on the Sunken
Diamond.
The Cards, back from the Southland where they lost two tilts
to USC, have lost four of their last five games, beating only a weak
. • Oregon State.

Coach Dean will send sopli right
hander Ed Verdurmen to the mound
against the Bengals, who do not
have too strong a team. Ray High
smith and Dick Jones will follow
Verdurmen aaginst COP, whom the
Cards beat 24-1 last year.
The Cards have been plagued with
erors in the field of late, booting 43
in the 11 games before the USC eon
tests. In Los Angeles, there was
some improvement, but the Swiss
cheese infield has nullified the ef
forts of the Stanford pitchers.
Pitching is the strong point of the
team, but Ray Young was knocked |
out of the box by USC and Walt
Payne had a shaky stint thanks to
bobbles keeping them in hot water.
Both the fieiding and hitting rnufet
improve against the Tigers or else
the Dean men will be in for a rough
session this weekend when they
cross bats with UCLA on Friday and
Santa Clara in a double-header on
Saturday.
COP has lost most of its games
this year, many by big scores. Their
defense equals or excels Stanford's
in porosity, and the Indians should
n't have too much trouble in rack
ing up their sixth Win in 13 games.
