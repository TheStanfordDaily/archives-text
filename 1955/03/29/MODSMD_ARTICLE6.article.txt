LONDONâ€”Minister of State An
thony Nutting told Parliament to
day Russian and Western represen
tatives discussing disarmament here
"have been able to narrow one or
two points of disagreement."
Nutting gave no details of ad
vances in the five-power talks, but
it appeared unlikely that any prog

ress had born made on the main
i:-.sue, Russia's efforts to eliminate
the West's atomic advantage without,
notably reducing the huge armies of
the Communist world.
Representatives of the United
States, Britain, France, and Canada
are trying to persuade Russia to
agree to a genuine, all-around re
duction of armaments.
