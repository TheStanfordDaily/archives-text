# Work Speeded On Constitution
## 
### DICK MANSFIELD Editor, The Daily 
Moving toward completion of a draft of a new ASSU Constitu
tion to be presented to the student body for approval April 19 and
20, the Executive Committee decided several small points and
discussed nomenclature and phraseology at a special meeting
last night.
In one important motion, Excom provided for a statement in the

Constitution making the Student Fi
nancial Manager (similar to the
present Student Manager) explicitly
responsible to the Financial Director
(the present Financial Manager of
ASSU, who is Dean of Students 11.
Donald Winbigler).
. PRESIDING OFFICER
Excom -also decided to allow the
president to appoint a regular or
ex-officio member of the legislature
to act as presiding officer pro tem
under the proposed constitution
should the need for such action
arise.
In further action, Excom decided
to allow the Student Financial Man
ager to appoint, an assistant, with
specification of duties left general,
this appointment, to be subject to
legislative approval.
The question of seating IFC and
ICC presidents on the cabinet was
tabled until the present holders of
these offices should be able to attend
an Excom meeting.
DUTIES CLARIFIED
Excom also acted to clarify the
Student Financial Manager's duties
in the Constitution, to provide for
temporary committees but no stand
ing committees for the Cabinet, to
retain a broad general definition of
boards (which are represented on
the cabinet), and to reject a propo
sal that commission representatives
be accorded ex-officio member rights
when presenting matters to the cab
inet or legislature.
The positions of Women's Athletic
Association and Fundamental Stand
ard Committee in the constitutional
structure will be considered again
at another meeting.
Junior representative Dave
Brownwood presented the issues to
be discussed; a list of these issues
was drawn up by Brownwood, Jim
Flanagan, and Roberta Clark of Ex
com over spring vacation.
Brownwood divided the issues into
two parts: questions of whether to
place various clauscs in the Con
stitution itself or in the by-laws,
and questions of whether to omit
certain clauscs entirely. Most of the
decisions reached were in the first
category and in general favored
elaborating the Constitution itself.
