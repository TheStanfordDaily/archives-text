THE PROBABLE SITEâ€”Preliminary plans for a new dormitory
for about 350 women which are now being rushed to completion
call for the residence to be built between the Knoll and the new
peripheral road (dotted line). The star marks the general area
of the site. A gift of $1,000,000 from Mrs. Robert S. Moore of
Atherton, announced yesterday, has spurred the planning
which until recently was only long-range in nature. One or two
more women's residences may be constructed to the east of the
one which is now being designed.
