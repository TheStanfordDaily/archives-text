# Four Farm Men Climb Mt. Whitney
## 
### 
A quartet of Stanford men had
their hoads in the clouds this vaca
tion. Between last quarter's finals
and this quarter's registration, they
scaled the east buttress of Mt. Whit
ney, highest peak in the United
States.
The climbers are Robert Brooke,
Gil Roberts, Dave Sowles, and Tom
McCormick. Brooke is the presi
dent. of the Alpine Club and Rob
erts is the club's safety manager.
The climb up the rocky east but
tress had been accomplished only
once before during the winter, sea
son. %
The ascent, which was for the
most part uneventful, was called "a
good enjoyable climb, but not a
dangerous one" by the students.
