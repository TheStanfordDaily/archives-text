# FARM GIVEN $1 MILLION FOR NEW DORM
## Hall to House 350 Women 
### 
Mrs. Robert S. Moore of Atherton has given Stanford $1,000,000
to provide a residence hall for approximately 350 undergraduate
women, Persident Wallace Sterling announced yesterday.
The University, faced with an urgent need for women's housing,
is moving at double-quick time on all phases of advance planning
so that the hall will be ready for occupancy in the fall of 1956,
Dr. Sterling said.
"Mrs. Moore's great generosity will in large measure make a
reality of the program for women's housing which has been under
study for some time in the offices of our Dean 6f Students and
Director of Planning," Dr. Sterling said.
"Her gift will make it possible for Stanford to build a residence
which will embody the most advanced thinking in design of stu
dent living facilities and which will be a model for others to fol
low," Dr. Sterling continued.
The University will provide an amount similar to Mrs. Moore's
contribution to complete the financing of the residence.
The dormitory will be known as Florence Moore Hall in honor

of the donor. Mrs. Moore is the
widow of Robert S. Moore, founder
and president of Moore Dry Dock
Company, Oakland. He died in
February, 1930.
Stanford has long been an interest
of the Moores. In 1925 they estab
lished an honors scholarship. 1n*1951
Mrs. Moore presented the Univer
sity with $100,000 for the Robert S.
Moore Endowment. Fund in memory
of her husband. Use of the endow
ment. income is unrestricted.
Mrs. Moore's new gift is the sec-»
ond largest ever to be received by
Stanford from a living ihdividucd.
Also announced yesterday was a
gift, from Mrs. Moore to Menlo
School and College of $350,000 for a
science and engineering building.
The new Stanford women's hall
will combine the advantages of
small-group living with the econ
omies of joint operation. "Princi
pally what we're trying to do is re
create row living conditions in a
large dormitory," said Milton F.
Johnson of the Planning Office.
SEVEN UNITS
General planning contemplates
seven living units, three stories in
height, grouped around central of
fice and service facilities.
The residence will be located on
part of the gradually sloping open
field across from the Knoll and fac
ing the peripheral road which will
run east and west, north of the Zeta
Psi house and Lagunita Drive.
Each of the seven wings of the
dormitory will have its own social
lounge and dining room with adja
cent exterior patio. Study - bed
rooms, most of them doubles, will be
located on the second and third
floors. It is planned that each sec
ond floor will have a sitting room
with kitchenette and a resident as
sistant's apartment.
The main building will house the
entrance lobby, the resident direc
tor's office and living quarters, and
a guest apartment.
PFLUEGER IS ARCHITECT
Milton T. Pflucger of San Fran
cisco will be the architect. He was
architect for a new University of
San Francisco dormitory and for the
Moffitt Hospital, recently dedicated
at the University of California med
ical center in San Francisco.
Eldridgc T. Spencer, Stanford di
rector of planing, will be the super
vising architect.
A special committee of the Uni
versity Board of Trustees is work
ing on a program for another wom
en's residence of approximately the
same size to be built in the near
future on an adjoining site, Dr.
Sterling reported.
NEED FOR SPACE
Stanford's urgent need for wom
en's living space stems from the re
quirement that all undergraduate
women live in University housiiiK
the president explained.
Conversion of Branner Hall from
a men's to a women's dorm and oth
er temporary measures have been in
force since enrollment increased af
ter World War 11.
Still the University has been able
to accept only two out. of every
seven fully qualified women who
apply. And because the number of
women dropping out has been
smaller than anticipated, next fall's
class of freshman women will b*
cut to about i>oo, a drop of 25 per
cent.
Even with the new residence, As
sistant to the President Kenneth M.
Cuthbertson said recently, "the pres
sure on women's housing will con
tinue for a long time. We will have
to use any available space."
"Mrs. Moore's gift could not have
come at a more opportune time,"

sistant to the President Kenneth M.
Cuthbertson said recently, "the pres
sure on women's housing will con
tinue for a long time. We will have
to use any available space."
"Mrs. Moore's gift could not have
come at a more opportune time,"
Dr. Sterling commented.
Mrs. Robert S. Moore of Atherton has given Stanford $1,000,000
to provide a residence hall for approximately 350 undergraduate
women, Persident Wallace Sterling announced yesterday.
The University, faced with an urgent need for women's housing,
is moving at double-quick time on all phases of advance planning
so that the hall will be ready for occupancy in the fall of 1956,
Dr. Sterling said.
"Mrs. Moore's great generosity will in large measure make a
reality of the program for women's housing which has been under
study for some time in the offices of our Dean 6f Students and
Director of Planning," Dr. Sterling said.
"Her gift will make it possible for Stanford to build a residence
which will embody the most advanced thinking in design of stu
dent living facilities and which will be a model for others to fol
low," Dr. Sterling continued.
The University will provide an amount similar to Mrs. Moore's
contribution to complete the financing of the residence.
The dormitory will be known as Florence Moore Hall in honor

of the donor. Mrs. Moore is the
widow of Robert S. Moore, founder
and president of Moore Dry Dock
Company, Oakland. He died in
February, 1930.
Stanford has long been an interest
of the Moores. In 1925 they estab
lished an honors scholarship. 1n*1951
Mrs. Moore presented the Univer
sity with $100,000 for the Robert S.
Moore Endowment. Fund in memory
of her husband. Use of the endow
ment. income is unrestricted.
Mrs. Moore's new gift is the sec-»
ond largest ever to be received by
Stanford from a living ihdividucd.
Also announced yesterday was a
gift, from Mrs. Moore to Menlo
School and College of $350,000 for a
science and engineering building.
The new Stanford women's hall
will combine the advantages of
small-group living with the econ
omies of joint operation. "Princi
pally what we're trying to do is re
create row living conditions in a
large dormitory," said Milton F.
Johnson of the Planning Office.
SEVEN UNITS
General planning contemplates
seven living units, three stories in
height, grouped around central of
fice and service facilities.
The residence will be located on
part of the gradually sloping open
field across from the Knoll and fac
ing the peripheral road which will
run east and west, north of the Zeta
Psi house and Lagunita Drive.
Each of the seven wings of the
dormitory will have its own social
lounge and dining room with adja
cent exterior patio. Study - bed
rooms, most of them doubles, will be
located on the second and third
floors. It is planned that each sec
ond floor will have a sitting room
with kitchenette and a resident as
sistant's apartment.
The main building will house the
entrance lobby, the resident direc
tor's office and living quarters, and
a guest apartment.
PFLUEGER IS ARCHITECT
Milton T. Pflucger of San Fran
cisco will be the architect. He was
architect for a new University of
San Francisco dormitory and for the
Moffitt Hospital, recently dedicated
at the University of California med
ical center in San Francisco.
Eldridgc T. Spencer, Stanford di
rector of planing, will be the super
vising architect.
A special committee of the Uni
versity Board of Trustees is work
ing on a program for another wom
en's residence of approximately the
same size to be built in the near
future on an adjoining site, Dr.
Sterling reported.
NEED FOR SPACE
Stanford's urgent need for wom
en's living space stems from the re
quirement that all undergraduate
women live in University housiiiK
the president explained.
Conversion of Branner Hall from
a men's to a women's dorm and oth
er temporary measures have been in
force since enrollment increased af
ter World War 11.
Still the University has been able
to accept only two out. of every
seven fully qualified women who
apply. And because the number of
women dropping out has been
smaller than anticipated, next fall's
class of freshman women will b*
cut to about i>oo, a drop of 25 per
cent.

women dropping out has been
smaller than anticipated, next fall's
class of freshman women will b*
cut to about i>oo, a drop of 25 per
cent.
Even with the new residence, As
sistant to the President Kenneth M.
Cuthbertson said recently, "the pres
sure on women's housing will con
tinue for a long time. We will have
to use any available space."
"Mrs. Moore's gift could not have
come at a more opportune time,"
Dr. Sterling commented.
Mrs. Robert S. Moore of Atherton has given Stanford $1,000,000
to provide a residence hall for approximately 350 undergraduate
women, Persident Wallace Sterling announced yesterday.
The University, faced with an urgent need for women's housing,
is moving at double-quick time on all phases of advance planning
so that the hall will be ready for occupancy in the fall of 1956,
Dr. Sterling said.
"Mrs. Moore's great generosity will in large measure make a
reality of the program for women's housing which has been under
study for some time in the offices of our Dean 6f Students and
Director of Planning," Dr. Sterling said.
"Her gift will make it possible for Stanford to build a residence
which will embody the most advanced thinking in design of stu
dent living facilities and which will be a model for others to fol
low," Dr. Sterling continued.
The University will provide an amount similar to Mrs. Moore's
contribution to complete the financing of the residence.
The dormitory will be known as Florence Moore Hall in honor

of the donor. Mrs. Moore is the
widow of Robert S. Moore, founder
and president of Moore Dry Dock
Company, Oakland. He died in
February, 1930.
Stanford has long been an interest
of the Moores. In 1925 they estab
lished an honors scholarship. 1n*1951
Mrs. Moore presented the Univer
sity with $100,000 for the Robert S.
Moore Endowment. Fund in memory
of her husband. Use of the endow
ment. income is unrestricted.
Mrs. Moore's new gift is the sec-»
ond largest ever to be received by
Stanford from a living ihdividucd.
Also announced yesterday was a
gift, from Mrs. Moore to Menlo
School and College of $350,000 for a
science and engineering building.
The new Stanford women's hall
will combine the advantages of
small-group living with the econ
omies of joint operation. "Princi
pally what we're trying to do is re
create row living conditions in a
large dormitory," said Milton F.
Johnson of the Planning Office.
SEVEN UNITS
General planning contemplates
seven living units, three stories in
height, grouped around central of
fice and service facilities.
The residence will be located on
part of the gradually sloping open
field across from the Knoll and fac
ing the peripheral road which will
run east and west, north of the Zeta
Psi house and Lagunita Drive.
Each of the seven wings of the
dormitory will have its own social
lounge and dining room with adja
cent exterior patio. Study - bed
rooms, most of them doubles, will be
located on the second and third
floors. It is planned that each sec
ond floor will have a sitting room
with kitchenette and a resident as
sistant's apartment.
The main building will house the
entrance lobby, the resident direc
tor's office and living quarters, and
a guest apartment.
PFLUEGER IS ARCHITECT
Milton T. Pflucger of San Fran
cisco will be the architect. He was
architect for a new University of
San Francisco dormitory and for the
Moffitt Hospital, recently dedicated
at the University of California med
ical center in San Francisco.
Eldridgc T. Spencer, Stanford di
rector of planing, will be the super
vising architect.
A special committee of the Uni
versity Board of Trustees is work
ing on a program for another wom
en's residence of approximately the
same size to be built in the near
future on an adjoining site, Dr.
Sterling reported.
NEED FOR SPACE
Stanford's urgent need for wom
en's living space stems from the re
quirement that all undergraduate
women live in University housiiiK
the president explained.
Conversion of Branner Hall from
a men's to a women's dorm and oth
er temporary measures have been in
force since enrollment increased af
ter World War 11.
Still the University has been able
to accept only two out. of every
seven fully qualified women who
apply. And because the number of
women dropping out has been
smaller than anticipated, next fall's
class of freshman women will b*
cut to about i>oo, a drop of 25 per
cent.
Even with the new residence, As
sistant to the President Kenneth M.
Cuthbertson said recently, "the pres
sure on women's housing will con
