Thank you, Mfs. Moore.
As construction has continued on three
men's dormitory projects this year, the ques
tion has been asked, "When are they going to
do something for the women?" Womens' hous
ing has been one of the really pressing prob
lems confronting the University, as indicated
by the recently announced limitation to be
placed on the number of coeds in. the Class of
1959.
Your gift of one million dollars to build a
women's dormitory, as Dr. Sterling said, could
not have come at a more opportune time.
Your action has started a building program

for women's residences which will eventually
see two more women's dormitories in the same
area and convert Branner Hall back into a men's
dormitory.
Thus your magnificent gift to an institution
which you never attended but which you have
helped with smaller amounts before will mate
rially help the University as it works toward
solution of this housing problem which arose
after the Second World War. Such generosity
helps not just Stanford housing but the whole
Stanford program, in making it possible for
more students to enjoy it in better accommo
dations.
Again, thank you, Mrs. Moore.
