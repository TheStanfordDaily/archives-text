"Tonight in Excom" could well be "Last
Night in Excom" and possibly even "Tomorrow
Night in Excom" today, as the Executive Com
mittee continues to add special sessions to its
discussion of the proposed new ASSU Consti
tution. The Constitution will be presented to
the student body at a special referendum April
19 and 20, and that's only three weeks from
now. Excom's Inn Flanagan, Roberta Clark,
and Dave Brownwood put in time getting the
document into a tentative written form over
spring vacation. Results of last quarter's dis
cussions were brought into line with the docu
ment's original form then.
The Constitution is "in pretty fair form,"
ASSU President Pete Bing points out, "with a
number of small decisions yet to be made."
Excom members will take the Constitution to
iiving groups to explain it before the referen
dum, an/' Bing is "quite sure we'll be ready to
go within the next week."
The tempo of work on the Constitution proj
ect has gradually snowballed with time, as
Excom lengthened meetings, then added an
official weekend meeting each week, and then
added a special meeting last night and may
have to meet again tomorrow night. But Bing
is confident that a very f&w more short meet

ings to attend to details will have the document
ready for the voters.

Those intercollegiate jumping frogs you
read about in yesterday's Daily will have Ex
com hopping tonight. The question: How, if at
all, to select a representative frog to wave the
Cardinal at the forthcoming Calaveras County
Jumping Frog derby? Stanford can enter three
frogs if it is so minded; should we award them
varsity letters? How about a rooting section?
Excom will get a chance to wrestle with these
problems tonight. But they may choose to leap
froq to more mundane matters. . . .

Excom must decide shortly how to go about
selecting a Stanford nominee for the NSA In
ternational Student Relations Seminar to be
held at Cambridge, Massachusetts, July 11
through Aug. 31. The decision is up to ASSU;
at present all Kxcorn needs to decide is how
to select the nominee, and actual selection will
follow,

The Excom meeting will begin at 7:30 tonight
in the Excom room, Student Union. As Consti
tution discussions near a climax, students in
terested in the document's development should
plan to attend.
