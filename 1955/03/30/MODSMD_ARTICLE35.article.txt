# Indians Defeat COP, 18-10, in Game Called Short by Darkness in Seventh
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
Stanford's baseball team got 18 runs yesterday against COP, but Card hurlers surrendered 10
tallies to the Bengals. It was called after seven innings on account of darkness.
The first six batters scored for COP in the first inning. Ed Verdurmen gave up five hits including
a double by Chuck Chatfield, and two walks, as the COPers sent ten men to the plate.
Stanford came right back though, as they also sent ten batters up to swing against Hall in a

first inning that took 35 minutes to
play. The first five Stanford batters
.scored, and Bob Evans was on third,
with no outs, but a strikeout and
two ground outs ended the rally.
Hall's wildness put four Indians on
base and two hits, a single by Rudy
Figueroa and a double by Evans, did
the damage.

Verdurmen held the Tigers score
less in the second although he did
walk two. In the bottom half of the
frame, three hits, an error, walk,
and a balk added four runs to the
Stanford total. A two-run triple by
Tom Dandurand was the key blow.
He scored on a balk a few minutes
later.
A single, balk, and two infield outs
gave COP their seventh run in the
third, but the Cards got that back
when Sid Hall was safe on an error,
went to second on a sacrifice by
Pieh Scramaglia, and scored on a
double by Figueroa.
'1 he Stocktonites closed the gap to
10-8 in the fourth, but Stanford put
the game out of reach with four
runs in both the fifth and sixth.
INDIANS KIJN WILD
The Stan fords started to run on
ihe Bengals in the fifth; they stole
lour bases, and look many others

on balls hit to the outfield. Hall
opened with a single, stole second,
Bob Fletcher walked, then came a
double steal. Scramaglia's one
baser scored Hall, and Figueroa tal
lied Fletcher with his third hit of
the game. Len Swartz grounded out,

but two walks and a single by Hal
Messner made the score 14-8 in
favor of the home club.
COP fell apart at the seams in
the sixth. They threw the ball away,
tripped while picking up errflnt
throws, and made several mental
errors. Pitcher Dick Jones, F!on
Marciel, and Scramaglia added hits
to the deluge and the Cards pushed
their total to 18 as darkness ap
proached.
The Indians • looked much im
proved in the field as lh*ey booted
only two chances in an atmosphere
conducive to miscues. Verdurmen,
the winning pitcher although he
gave up seven runs, had a shaky
first two innings, but looked fairly
sharp in the third. Pay Ilighsmith
relieved him and as usual was quick,
.striking out two but walking three
iin his two-inning stint. Dick Jones
fared much the same in his two in-
I nings.
Although the Bengal pitching was
nothing .special, the 14 base hits that
rattled ofl' Card bats had a hearten
] ing sound. Figueroa had a double
j included in his three, Evans had two
I doubles, Scramaglia three singles,
j including a drag bunt, and Sid Hall
| and Figueroa each scored three
1 runs.
Scramaglia and Mickey Ilolzman
i looked good around second, although
neither have very strong arms.
