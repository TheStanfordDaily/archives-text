# Frost Defeated by Moss in Tourney
## 
### 
Tournament play under the added
handicap of finals proved too much
for the Stanford varsity tennis team
in the Northern Intercollegiate
Tournament March 17-21.
Coach Bob Renker's racketmen
were forced to forfeit several
matches because of conflicting ex
ams. In the finals of the Berkeley
tourney Davis Cupper Jerry Muss
of Modesto JC defeated Stanford
captain Jack Frost, 6-2, G-4. Frost
was obviously off his best form in
the match.
Renker stated, however, that he
was pleased with some individual
performancesâ€”particularly those of
Dave Duff and Bob Norton.
The varsity next sees action
against USC on April 8. The frosh
tennis team plays the Peninsula
Tennis Club this Saturday at 2 p.m.
In their last outing the frosh
trounced the Oakland Tennis Club
7-2.
