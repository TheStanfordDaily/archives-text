## 
### 
Stanford track coach Jack Weiershauser has no fears of a repe
tition of the walloping given to the Indian cindermen by Michigan
last year when the Cards were routed 86-35. But he still looks for
[ a rugged time against the Wolverines.
Weiershauser's squad looked impressive as it romped to an

easy 82J/t-48 t victory over Fresno
State Saturday, but it was only last
month that the Wolverine machine
steamrolled to the Big Ten indoor
title.

One of the top personal battles in

1 sophomore, leaped 6 ft. 6 in. against
Fresno State last Saturday in a per
sonal best effort. Booth, Big Ten
co-champion, cleared 6-5% in the
indoor meet last month.
Four other Big Ten champions
form the vanguard of the Wolverine
team. John Moule has a mile tune

ford does the two-mile in 9:20.4.
Dave Owen puts the shot better than
53 feet, and Jim Love can skim the
70-yard low hurdles in 8 flat.
Behind these flashes sprinter Jolm
Johnson, 440 men Dick Flodin and
Grant Scruggs, 880 man Hobe Jones,
vaulters Tom Skimming and Boh
Appleman, and broad jumpers Tom
Hendricks and Junior Stielstra add
solid depth to the squad.
Pete Gray, double winner in the
indoor title meet, will be missing
from the 1000 and the 880. Gray
is recovering from a recent appen
dectomy, but the rest of Coach Don
Canham's squad will be in excellent
health for the meet.
