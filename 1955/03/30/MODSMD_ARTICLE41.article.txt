# Bruin Bats Threat To Cards Friday
## 
### 
The UCLA Bruin baseball team
which challenges Stanford 011 the
Sunken Diamond Friday afternoon
is the best-hitting Uclan team in 11
years, according to Bruin mentor
Arthur Reiche.
On pre - season dope Stanford's
.strongest point appeared to be the
Indian pitching staff. However, in
practice the Card pitching has been
somewhat shaky so far. SC shelled
Stanford pitchers for seven and
eight runs in two games down .south
and even low - rated COP blasted
Card pitchers for 10 runs in the ab
breviated seven-inning contest yes
terday.
The Bruins count on outfielder
Sam Brown and third-sacker Billy
Heil, a JC transfer, for their strong
est hitting.
Stanford's coach Everett Dean will
probably rely on Ray Young and
Walt Payne to silence the booming
Bruin bats. Young was driven from
the mound by the SC batting lineup
in his last outing.
