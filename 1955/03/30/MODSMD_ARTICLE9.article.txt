## 
### 
Wallets belonging to University
employees, a professor, and a stu
dent were lifted from offices around
campus Monday in a robbing spree
that suggests that the crimes may
have been related, according to Po
lice Chief Gordon Davis.
Professor Ronald Grant of the
Physiology Department had his wal
let taken off his desk around 10 a.m.
when he was out of his office.
At noon a red leather wallet be
longing to Connie Schulz was taken
from the Union Residence lobby.
Miss Schulz was at lunch at. the
time. The wallet contained $72 in
cash and $150 in travelers' checks,
Mrs. Olga W. McNemar, a re
search psychologist in the Education
Building, returned to her office at
about 3:45 p.m. to find her wallet
missing.
Chief Davis emphasized that office
people should be extra careful dur
ing the coffee break time and during
noon. The robberies suggest an or
ganized gang, Davis said.
Three staff members of Hoover
Library suffered losses of purses or
money totaling $22 last Saturday
morning between 10 and 10:15. This
was the first sign of planned purse
stealing, Chief Davis stated.
