—"More Fuii than a H&yride!
Charters are wonderful ... for outings, travel to games
for team, band, and rooters . . . any group trip, any time,
anywhere. And for finest buses and courteous, expert
drivers, be sure your charter's a Greyhound. The cost
is amazingly low—often less per person than the regular
low Greyhound fare! For your next event, check on a
Greyhound Charter. Make it a picnic all the way!
