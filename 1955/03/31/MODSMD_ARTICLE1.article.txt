### 

FINISHING TOUCHES—Additions to Bowman Alumni House, the home of Stanford alumni ac
tivities, are almost completed. The $50,000 building will be finished for dedication May 21, at
the annual Alumni Conference. The main room in the addition is a committee room, suitable for
small meetings. The building also includes new offices for the Stanford Review, and a large
storage space. The building was financed by gifts to the University. The new building is set at
an angle to the existing Bowman House, and is designed with similar architecture.
