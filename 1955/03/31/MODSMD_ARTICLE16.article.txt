# Concert Is 'Relaxing'
## 
### JACK BYRNE 
It is seldom that a symphony
orchestra, with the possible ex
ception of a "pops" group, pre
sents as pleasing and wholly
relaxing a concert as the San
Francisco Symphony did Tues
day night in Memorial Hall un
der the baton of Enrique Jorda.
So simple and appealing was the
program that it seems almost a pity
to waste it on the first day of a
quarter, rather than to present it
finals week when its soothing ef
fects would be even more appreci
ated.
Perhaps the weakest part of the
program was the opening number,
Handel's Water Music Suite. Jorda
led his musicians through the fa
miliar strains in adequate fashion,
but one is left with the feeling that
Handel is deserving of a little more
verve.
Joaquin Turina's "Procesion del
Rocio" is not a memorable compo
sition in its own right, but it served
as a classic example of what a con
ductor sympathetic to the music he
plays can do with an orchestra. Jor
da was obviously at home in the
Latin rhythms, and his swinging in
terpretation was infectious to the
orchestra and audience alike.
The "Petite Suite No. 2" of Igor
Stravinsky (with one section inex
plicably dropped) was another for
tunate mating of orchestra and con
ductor.
Dvorak's Fourth Symphony
rounded the program out in carry
ing'sufficient weight to balance the
rather light first half without resort
ing to pompoisty or theatrics.
Perhaps the most lamentable facet
of the concert was the poor acous
tics. The music of the brass section
was lost in the sea of musicians,
reaching the audience as a barely
audible and bodiless tone. At times
the orchestra gave the impression of
being unable to hear itself, perhaps
accounting for occasional falterings
in the woodwinds.
