# Orchesis to Present Dance Concert
## 
### 
A comic donkey cavorting on
stage, impressionistic studies to
the rhythm of drums, and in
terpretations of the passage of
time will be included in the an
nual spring concert to be pre
sented by Orchesis, student
modern dance club, tomorrow
and Saturday night in Memorial
Auditorium.
The program, open to the public
without charge, will begin at 8:15.
Fourteen dances originated by mem
bers of Orchesis or by the choreog
raphy class will be presented. Cos
tumes and sets have also been de
signed by the students.
During the first half of the pro
gram a number of short dances will
be presented. Among them will be
a dramatic study to De Falla's "Rit
ual Dance of Fire" with choreogra
phy by Monica Kaufmann, graduate
student from Switzerland and guest
of Orchesis for this performance.
One of the major productions is
"Time," with choreography by Mary
Sherman, president of Orchesis, and
original music by Charles Chesnut.
The cast dances out a series of epi
sodes showing that the passage of
time affects people differently de
pending upon the situation.
The finale, "Fable of the Donkey,"
is the light-hearted children's story
of a man and his son taking their
donkey to market and vainly trying
i to follow all the advice offered by
J passers-by. The sets move across
I the stage to make the travelers seem
to move down the road.
Orchesis is sponsored by the
Women's Athletic Association. Mrs.
Margaret P. Duggar, instructor in
modern dance in the Women's Phys
ical Education Department, is fac
ulty adviser to Orchesis, and Mrs.
