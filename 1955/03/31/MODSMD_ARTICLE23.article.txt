## Excom Gets New Draft For Constitution Study New Document Undergoes Word by Word Examination 
### BILL WRIGHT Associate Editor, The Daily 
The Executive Committee was presented with a new revised
draft of the proposed new ASSU constitution at its regular meet
ing last night and began working over the document word by
word.
Excom is'trying to ready the new constitution in time for a

►" period of student education before the
scheduled referendum April 19 and
20. To hurry the process another spe
cial session will be held tonight at
7.
The draft which Excom had in its
possession last night was prepared
during the vacation by Dave Brown -
wood, Roberta Clark, and Jim Flan
agan. It was completed at dinner
time last night.
Excom worked its way through
about one third of the 16-page docu
ment consisting of a preamble and 11
articles. Excom concerned itself with
polishing the wording and punctua
tion as well as debating several ma
jor points of policy.
Excom reviewed the new draft's
provisions regarding the preamble;
the name and membership in the
organization; the duties of the presi
dent, vice-president, and head cheer
leader; the cabinet; administrative
boards; and commissions.
BY-LAW PROBLEM
Excom's main stumbling block last
night concerned the problem of the
by-laws of administrative boards—
the relation of those by-laws to the
constitution and to regular ASSU
constitutional by-laws and the form
ulation of board by-laws.
After prolonged discussion — pri
marily between Bob Gable, Brown
wood, Flanagan, and Miss Clark—Ex
com decided to table the question un
til tonight.
Gable proposed that the regular
by-laws should create the individ
ual boards only and that the by
laws which determine the officers
and operations of the board should
be listed separately in a special sec
tion.
Miss Clark contended that the by
law which created the board should
also include some statements re
garding its officers and functions.
CABINET MEMBERSHIP
In accordance with a suggestion
of graduate representative Steve
Voykovich, Excom made more flex
ible the wording on the graduate
class's representative to the cabinet.
This is to allow for a possible change
in the graduate students' organiza
tion.
The question of seating Interfra
ternity and Interclub Council pres
idents on the cabinet was again de
layed.

ing last night and began working over the document word by
word.
Excom is'trying to ready the new constitution in time for a

►" period of student education before the
scheduled referendum April 19 and
20. To hurry the process another spe
cial session will be held tonight at
7.
The draft which Excom had in its
possession last night was prepared
during the vacation by Dave Brown -
wood, Roberta Clark, and Jim Flan
agan. It was completed at dinner
time last night.
Excom worked its way through
about one third of the 16-page docu
ment consisting of a preamble and 11
articles. Excom concerned itself with
polishing the wording and punctua
tion as well as debating several ma
jor points of policy.
Excom reviewed the new draft's
provisions regarding the preamble;
the name and membership in the
organization; the duties of the presi
dent, vice-president, and head cheer
leader; the cabinet; administrative
boards; and commissions.
BY-LAW PROBLEM
Excom's main stumbling block last
night concerned the problem of the
by-laws of administrative boards—
the relation of those by-laws to the
constitution and to regular ASSU
constitutional by-laws and the form
ulation of board by-laws.
After prolonged discussion — pri
marily between Bob Gable, Brown
wood, Flanagan, and Miss Clark—Ex
com decided to table the question un
til tonight.
Gable proposed that the regular
by-laws should create the individ
ual boards only and that the by
laws which determine the officers
and operations of the board should
be listed separately in a special sec
tion.
Miss Clark contended that the by
law which created the board should
also include some statements re
garding its officers and functions.
CABINET MEMBERSHIP
In accordance with a suggestion
of graduate representative Steve
Voykovich, Excom made more flex
ible the wording on the graduate
class's representative to the cabinet.
This is to allow for a possible change
in the graduate students' organiza
tion.
The question of seating Interfra
ternity and Interclub Council pres
idents on the cabinet was again de
layed.
