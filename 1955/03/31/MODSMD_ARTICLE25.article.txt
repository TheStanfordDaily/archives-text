The USO has awarded Ram's Head its "meri
torious" award (or the Stanford group's tour
oI military bases over spring vacation. It's an
award of which Ram's Head can be most proud.
As originally planned, the tour was to have
had much larger scope and would have been
a much more attractive project for the Ram's
Head members working on it. When a series
of troubles beset the show, however, the cast
and crews kept right on working and presented
"One for the Road," a composite show taken
from old Ram's Head musical productions, in
a fashion which earned it praise as the "best

entertainment" provided for servicemen over
the recent months.
To the Ram's Head members who worked
hard to bring entertainment to servicemen and
honor to Stanford and to themselves, we say
"Congratulations!" Ram's Head wants to make
this vacation tour a regular feature of the Ram's
Head yearly schedule, and the group which
has proved its talent and its worth with so many
fine productions here on campus is certainly
One of the best representatives Stanford couJd
have anywhere.
So we hope Ram's Head will be able to make
more tours and keep up the work they have
started so successfully.
