This is the second Bull Session of the quar
ter but let me be the first to welcome you back.
1 think that this is going to be a pretty social
quarter, what with all this sun and everything.
Well, sir, for those of you who date the
young ladies living in Roble Hall and Branner
Hall. There will probably be considerable
change in dating habits of frosh womanhood.
As you know, this is the quarter that most of
the young ladies will be studying Bio 3. Bio 3
is concerned to come extent with the study of
genetics. Also, the girls are concerned to some
extent with the search for a husband. In fact,
that's why they are at LSJU.
Because of these two factors (husband-hunt
ing and genetics) the freshman dolly will be
casting a more academic eye on the Saturday
escort and will be more selective in her choice
of a date. You ask her out on Tuesday and
she'll £*. \d the next day or two matching
recessives and dominants. "Does he have good
teeth?'' she'll ask herself. "How thick are those
glasses he wears?"
If you get your answer on Thursday you'll
be doing well. And if she says "no" on Thurs
day you'll be going stag Saturday.

You guys from Nevada might as well for
get about dating these lower class women, as
a matter of fact. If one of you asks a frosh
chickadee out she'll probably either give you
a flat no or else hit you with "How close have
you been to the atomic tests?" Or "Have you
ever been under any radioactive fallouts?"
These dollies read the papers, and now that
they know what they are, they'll be thinking
of genes -mutated ones. The rough from Reno
will have to face questions like "How many
arms will your children have?" but the worst
will be when she comes into the lobby looking
lovely in a light summer print and has a Geiger
counter under her arm. One click is all right—
just your watch dial. Any more and she'll be
going back for more equipment.
Imagine a date who insists on keeping an
inch-thick lead plate between you. And you'll
have to carry it.
I have but one comment to make to the ladies.
I am healthy, have fair teeth, excellent eyes
(blue), and am generally strong of limb. What's
more, the last time I was in Nevada, the only
thing that got mutated is my wallet—and that's
on its way to recovery.
