■BILL NICHOLS-

The resignation of Ray Dean brings up a question, since A 1 Masters ha:;
.slated that there will be a grad student helping Jack WeL'ivhauser. Will
Stanford truck teams he as good without a fulltime assistant eoach? Dean
was one of tlu* key men in the early collegiate development of Bob Mathias,
and was the coach who coaxed John Stewart to (>-(;•''i in (lit- high jump as
a I reshman.
Certainly Dean has been and is a valuable man, and his 10. -i will be hit,
but don't underestimate graduate coaches. Two that come to mind arc
Jack Shepard and Jim Gaughran. Shepard spends the ofl'-svason in the
Stanford School of Business and at the Sunken Diamond. 11 is work with
the pitchers and catchers and with Card hitters has proved very valuable
to baseball Coach Dean,
Jirn Gaughran, who swam for Ilaynie last year and is now in Law School,
tutored the mermen while Haynie was with the U.S. squad at the Pan-
American Games in Mexico City. He was out at the .swimming pool all
(luring finals week so that the paddlers could come out at convenient
times for their' workouts. Jim held the watch on the churning swimmers
alul called lor "locomotives" with all llu* acumen of a veteran coach, ,tnd
although the Card showing at the NCAA's was disappointing, il ran't 1.,
atbrilulled to (laughran.

Although the spikers have no chance of overhauling "JSC, they are headed
for a very successful season. Saturday's meet against Big Ttn champs,
Michigan, should prove to be very interesting. Several Cards are on the
brink of great murks- Bhil Fehlen in the high jump, and Jim Luttvell
in the hurdles and there are many events which will be as close as the
proverbial gnat's eye I row.
One of the big question marks will be John Stewart. Stewart was a
sensation as a freshman, cleared (J—(> in his first meet last year, but since
then he has gone down hill steadily. Last week he clcared only six I'oet
although there were extenuating circumstances. John is capable of (i-7
or higher, but if the competition of the next four weeks, when the Cards
meet Michigan, UCLA, Occidental, and USC, doesn't star! Ihe big end
soaring higher, nothing will.

Oil the same day, the baseballers will be down at Washington Field cross
ing bats with the Santa Clara Broncos. This is Everett Dean's last year
and the players would like to make it a winning one. This weekend, with
UCIiA on Friday and Santa Clara twice on Saturday, will go a long way
in determining the final standings.
