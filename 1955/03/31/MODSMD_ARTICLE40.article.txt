# Mathias, Held Only Cards Who Hold World Records
## 
### 
Stanford trackmen over the years have compiled many admirable records. Although only a
few World's records are still held by Stanfordites, the early 1930's saw Stanford men hold rec
ords in the weight events, middle distances, and hurdles.
The only records remaining are Bud Held's mark of 263 feet 10 inches in the javelin set in 1953,
and the mark of 7887 points in the decathalon, under the new scoring system, by Bob Mathias

at the 1952 Olympics.
Although USC has dominated the
U.S. track scene for the last two
decades, Stanford has done very
i well in national meets, too. The
! Cards won the NCAA champion
ships in ]928. 1929, and 1934. They
captured the ICAAAA in the same
years and also in 1927.
FARM POLE VAULTERS
The first man to put Stanford in
the track headlines was Norman
Dole, who broke the world pole
vault record with a sky-scraping
leap of 12 feet 1 8/25 inches, way
i hack in 1904.
Six years later, in 1910, Leland
; :â–  .rott t ame along in the same event
and upped the standard to 12 feet 11
inche-. The present Stanford mark
i held by Bud Deacon at 14 - 2 3 /4,
which was made in 1934.
Although he doesn't even hold the
University record, Bob King is
probably the Indians' best - known
high jumper. He won the 1928
Olympics at Amsterdam with a leap
of . George Horine set a world

record with fi-7 in 1912, but Willard
Smith, who cleared 0-7% in 1943,
holds the present Stanford record.
Stanford broke the mile relay |
mark in 1931 with a time of 5:12.0, j
and Blazing Ben Eastman broke ;
both the 440 and 880 standards.
BLAZING BEN
Eastman set the track world agog
with a 40.4 in the quarter-mile and |
a 1:49.8 in the half. He also ran the !
anchor lap on that relay team.
In the weights, Eric Krenz and
Harlow Rothert alternated in smash- ;
ing the discus and shot put records, j
Krenz' early death cut short his ca
reer, but before he died he held the 1
discus record at 167 feet 5 inches.
Rothert, one of the first ever to
put the 10-pound iron ball over 50 :
feet, reached 52-1, but the Stanford ;
mark is now out to 57-4%, set by
Otis Chandler in 1950. Mathias holds
the discus title at present with a
toss of 173-4 in 1951.
In 1934 John Lyman became the [
first man ever to throw the shot over j
54 feet. He bettered this by one :
inch. Stanford has had 14 shot put- I

ters who have deposited the ball
over 51 feet from the base line.
DASII MEN
Card dominance shifted to the
shorter distances in 1937-1.940. The
880-yard relay record moved to the
Stanford campus when a quartet, in
cluding present coach Jack Weiers
hauser, sprinted 220 yards each to
total 1:25. Weiershauser's 220 mark
of 20.7 set in 1937 still stands as the
top University performance in this
event.
Clyde Jeffrey's 9.4 in the hundred
in 1940 set both a Stanford and
world standard which stood until
Mel Patton came along. Jeffrey also
ran a lap on the mile relay team
which lowered the record to 3:10.5
in the same season.
CHher University marks are Paul
Moore's 4:11.5 in the mile set in
1940, and Bob Simon's 1951 9:19.0 in
the two-mile. Sam Klopstock holds
records in both hurdles. He skip
ped over the lows in 23.2 and the
highs in 14.1. Gay Bryan holds the
broad jump record at 24-4%.
