# I Hear Music ...

Jazz, everybody knows, is a
uniquely American phenomenon.
There are those who say it is Amer
ica's one truly original contribution
to music. Perhaps they are right.
But right or not, jazz grew here and
it has been around long enough to
influence leading composers of all
nationalities, like Hindemith, Stra
vinsky, Mil+iaud, Bernstein, and Lie
bcrmann. It seems likely that more
composers in the future may incor
porate and build on jazz forms.
The possibility that jazz may pro
vide the center for a great deal of
the serious composition of the future
makes it interesting to find where
jazz stands now. In particular, what
is this growing entity called West
Coast Jazz?
JAZZ CENTERS
Jazz has had various centers in
its growth — New Orleans, Kansas
City, Chicago, New York—depend
ing largely on how the jazzman
could earn his money. Playing for
funerals, on river boats, in bars, in
traveling bands, and finally for rec
ords as jazz popularity spread, jazz
men drifted north and east.
Eventually, in the late 30's and
40 : s, more were to be found in New
York than anywhere else. Radio or
chestras, recording companies, and
ever more night clubs gave them
the steady jobs they wanted. It is
still the fond hope of nearly every
traveling band musician to land a
studio job and settle down. The best
of them do, which accounts for the
disappearance of people like Kai
Winding and Billy Bauer.
Jazz's westward move is probably
clue most of all to the growth of
movie studios and their need for
many capable musicians. Along with
them have come branches of the re
cording industry, radio and televi
sion, and finally the establishment
of a number of bars that give steady
jobs and a free hand to inventive
jazzmen, like the Lighthouse and the
Haig.
JAZZ IN CALIFORNIA
So it is not surprising that there
are enough musicians settled in
Southern California to make it the
new center of invention. Barney

Kessel gave up traveling with the
Oscar Peterson Trio to settle in Van
Nuys, play in local clubs, and be on
call for any movie studio or record
ing session that needs a fast-reading
guitarist. Ernie Felice, accordionist
on some old Benny Goodman discs,
has played steadily at the Tail-o'-
the-Cock for four years. Similarly
with Howard Rumsey, Shorty Rog
ers, Gerry. Mulligan, Paul Smith,
and Andre Previn, and many others.
What is left of the West Coast, as
far as jazz is concerned,' is San
Francisco. This city's contributions
stem partly from the presence of
Darius Milhaud, teaching at Mills.
From his students (notably Bru
beck, Dave Von Kriedt, and Dick
Collins) and their friends come the
important new S.F. jazzmen. The
City's extensive serious music pro
gram and its many restaurants and
bars with a. rich public are other
factors.
It is easy to explain why the cen
ter of jazz has become the West
Coast. But the question remains
whether or not West Coast Jazz is
a new form, a distinct contribution.
I think it is. This new jazz may be
the most important yet, because it
has begun the process of fusion with
serious composition. But let that be
the subject for next week — what
have been the contributions to jazz
up to now, and what are the new
ones being made?
