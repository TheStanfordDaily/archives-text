# 'TOP PRIORITY' WORK
## New Dorm Construction Will Begin This Summer 
### BILL WRIGHT Associate Editor, The Daily 
The goal is October, 1956. And in order to ready the new
Florence Moore Hall for women for occupancy at that time, the
University is rushing to complete all phases of planning so that
work can begin this summer.
A gift of $1,000,000 from Mrs. Robert S. Moore of Atherton for

a residence for 350 undergraduate
women was the impetus which has
speeded preliminary work on the
"top priority" dorm.
Frederick O. Glover, assistant, to
the president, explained the situa
tion: "We made an agreement with
Mrs. Moore to try to build the resi
dence by the fall of 195(5. Although
we don't expect to lose the money
if it isn't finished by then, we will
do, and are doing, everything pos
sible to complete the work within
a year and a half.
According to Milton Johnson of
the Planning Office, Stanford has
been studying various aspects of
building a new women's residence
for 10 years, but no detailed plan
ning had been done.
OFF GUARD
Thus the gift from Mrs. Moore
and the goal of October 1!)56 caught
the University slightly otT guard.
Therefore the preliminary and the
working plans must be drawn up
immediately for approval by the
Board of Trustees.
Johnson said that to complete the
dorm by fall of next year, construc
tion must start no later than Aug.
15. That leaves Jess than five months
to prepare the plans and accept the
construction bid. By way of con
trast, the new men's dorm, Wilbur
Hall, was a year in the planning
stage.
Preliminary drawings should be
ready for the Board meeting April
21, Johnson s'aid. Then working
drawings must be prepared and ap
proved, and bids sought and ap
proved.
The preliminary drawings arc now
being prepared by Milton T. Pflue
ger of San Francisco, the architect.
This is a job which would normally
be done by the planning office,
Johnson said.
ROOM DESIGN
The. fundamental problem, .John
son explained, is to design tlie indi
vidual rooms in the residence. And
because Stanford has not construct
ed a women's dorm in 20 years, the
Planning Office does not know ex
actly what the women need in a
dorm and what facilities should be
provided.
For that purpose a special com
mittee of the Associated Women
Students is working with Miss Elva
F. Brown, chief counselor for wom
en, and the women members of the
Board of Trustees; Mrs. Allan E.
Charles, Mrs. Roger Goodan, and
Mrs. Robert L. Lipman.
Johnson thinks Florence Moore
Mall will be a model for future
women's dormitories in the West,
because the new residence should be
an up-to-date expression of the
needs in women's housing.

speeded preliminary work on the
"top priority" dorm.
Frederick O. Glover, assistant, to
the president, explained the situa
tion: "We made an agreement with
Mrs. Moore to try to build the resi
dence by the fall of 195(5. Although
we don't expect to lose the money
if it isn't finished by then, we will
do, and are doing, everything pos
sible to complete the work within
a year and a half.
According to Milton Johnson of
the Planning Office, Stanford has
been studying various aspects of
building a new women's residence
for 10 years, but no detailed plan
ning had been done.
OFF GUARD
Thus the gift from Mrs. Moore
and the goal of October 1!)56 caught
the University slightly otT guard.
Therefore the preliminary and the
working plans must be drawn up
immediately for approval by the
Board of Trustees.
Johnson said that to complete the
dorm by fall of next year, construc
tion must start no later than Aug.
15. That leaves Jess than five months
to prepare the plans and accept the
construction bid. By way of con
trast, the new men's dorm, Wilbur
Hall, was a year in the planning
stage.
Preliminary drawings should be
ready for the Board meeting April
21, Johnson s'aid. Then working
drawings must be prepared and ap
proved, and bids sought and ap
proved.
The preliminary drawings arc now
being prepared by Milton T. Pflue
ger of San Francisco, the architect.
This is a job which would normally
be done by the planning office,
Johnson said.
ROOM DESIGN
The. fundamental problem, .John
son explained, is to design tlie indi
vidual rooms in the residence. And
because Stanford has not construct
ed a women's dorm in 20 years, the
Planning Office does not know ex
actly what the women need in a
dorm and what facilities should be
provided.
For that purpose a special com
mittee of the Associated Women
Students is working with Miss Elva
F. Brown, chief counselor for wom
en, and the women members of the
Board of Trustees; Mrs. Allan E.
Charles, Mrs. Roger Goodan, and
Mrs. Robert L. Lipman.
Johnson thinks Florence Moore
Mall will be a model for future
women's dormitories in the West,
because the new residence should be
an up-to-date expression of the
needs in women's housing.
The goal is October, 1956. And in order to ready the new
Florence Moore Hall for women for occupancy at that time, the
University is rushing to complete all phases of planning so that
work can begin this summer.
A gift of $1,000,000 from Mrs. Robert S. Moore of Atherton for

a residence for 350 undergraduate
women was the impetus which has
speeded preliminary work on the
"top priority" dorm.
