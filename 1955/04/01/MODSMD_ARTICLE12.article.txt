# Junior Excom Cancels Water Carnival Plans
## 
### 
The Junior Class Excom this
week voted unanimously not to
hold the Junior Water Carnival
this spring.
The group felt that, although the
carnival should continue as a spring
quarter tradition, the condition of
Lake Lagunita this year is too un
favorable for the event.
There are two probJcms: There is
little water in the lake, and the level
is dropping rapidly—over an inch of
rain is needed to bring the water to
a level at which the carnival could
be held. The dikes between the lake
and Roble and Lagunita halls have
been greatly weakened by gophers,
and Corporation Yard engineers feel
that to allow the level to be raised
would be dangerous, since it. would
add to the pressure on the dikes.
COMPLETE STUDY
A committee composed of Fred
Stone and Helen Zarifes early in
winter quarter made a complete
study of past water carnivals, and
on the basis of this study made
many recommendations to the class
excom for a revamping of the or
ganization of the carnival.
The excom approved, in principle,
the plans, and work continued. At
the end of last quarter, however,
when the condition of the lake be
came evident, the excom began to
consider the advisability of holding
the carnival. The decision this week
was a result of this consideration.
The excom will make the report
on the carnival available to the
Class of '57, "in the hope that it will
continue the tradition of teh car
nival next year."
SUGGESTIONS
Some of the suggestions incorpo
rated into the report are to give in
tramural points to the men's groups
winning the two-man and four-man
canoe races, a plan which was ap
proved by the Intramural Athletic
Department; to eliminate living
group float competitions, and in
stead have float competition between
the underraduatc classes; and to
have a band and refreshments at the
Boathouse druing the events.
