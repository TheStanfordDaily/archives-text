## Cal Leases Village For Menlo Campus 
### HOMER DALTON Campus Correspondent 
BERKELEY, April 1. —The University of California announced
today that it would erect a new campus on the Stanford Village
site. The plan was made possible by the subletting of the Village
to Cal from the City of Menlo Park, which leased the land from
Stanford, which in turn bought the 85-acre plot from the federal

government..
It. took many weeks of negotiations
and legalistic finagling for the deal
to be transacted, reported Reed
Hapsworth of the Public Housing
Authority.
Robert Gordon Sproul, UC presi
dent, beamed his approval in a
luncheon press interview at the
fashionable Berkeley campus Stu
dent Union. '"This is another meas
ure of our realistic grasping of the
educational problem that confronts
the country. We realize that more
and more people are coming of col
lege age and we must strive to sat
isfy their appetite knowledge."
A VERBAL BLAST
Sources close to home down Palo
Alto way, however, revealed some
outspoken criticism of the proposed
University of California at Menlo
Park. The biggest .verbal blast of
the day originated from the Build
ing of Athletic Control. A prepared
release feared that the Village move
was only a front and that the real
purpose was to establish a spy net

work which would work to the det
riment of Stanford's athletic teams.
The release said, "It is feared that
the Village move is only a front and
that the real purpose is to establish
a spy network which will work to
the detriment of Stanford athletic
teams."
J. L. Pressins, Stanford '23, Wal
nut Creek, Tenn., sent a telegram to
President Sproul which read, "How
can Stanford be expected to win the
Big Game when you-all invade on
our privacy? Suh, this isn't fair
sportsmanship."
NO COMMENT
There was no comment from
President Wallace Sterling's office.
Existing plans call for the now
somewhat drabby Village to be
transformed into a modern mecca of
education with emphasis on modern
architecture. Bids are expected to
j go out to competing firms shortly.
Twcnty-four-hour-a-day labor is
expcctcd to go into the project in
order to ready it for use by this
September. An enrollment of 6,000
is expected for the opening of
UCMP. Liberal Arts, Animal Hus
bandry, and Kelp Micronology will
be offered to undergraduates.
TOUGH GRID SKED
A football schedule is being drawn
! up for UCMP and will include such
teams as Menlo - Athcrton, Menlo
College, Mayfield Elementary
School. Potawalamce, and possibly
Stanford,
Coaching suggestions received
; through the grapevine indicate that
Jackie Jensen, Harvey Knox, Mino
Jelkc, and Fleisch Yeast are under
consideration for the post.
A valid observation from a lead
ing news analyst, Kayborn Vander
ketter, provided food for thought
when he muttered, "and it's APRIL
FOOL'S day too."

BERKELEY, April 1. —The University of California announced
today that it would erect a new campus on the Stanford Village
site. The plan was made possible by the subletting of the Village
to Cal from the City of Menlo Park, which leased the land from
Stanford, which in turn bought the 85-acre plot from the federal

government..
It. took many weeks of negotiations
and legalistic finagling for the deal
to be transacted, reported Reed
Hapsworth of the Public Housing
Authority.
Robert Gordon Sproul, UC presi
dent, beamed his approval in a
luncheon press interview at the
fashionable Berkeley campus Stu
dent Union. '"This is another meas
ure of our realistic grasping of the
educational problem that confronts
the country. We realize that more
and more people are coming of col
lege age and we must strive to sat
isfy their appetite knowledge."
A VERBAL BLAST
Sources close to home down Palo
Alto way, however, revealed some
outspoken criticism of the proposed
University of California at Menlo
Park. The biggest .verbal blast of
the day originated from the Build
ing of Athletic Control. A prepared
release feared that the Village move
was only a front and that the real
purpose was to establish a spy net

work which would work to the det
riment of Stanford's athletic teams.
The release said, "It is feared that
the Village move is only a front and
that the real purpose is to establish
a spy network which will work to
the detriment of Stanford athletic
teams."
J. L. Pressins, Stanford '23, Wal
nut Creek, Tenn., sent a telegram to
President Sproul which read, "How
can Stanford be expected to win the
Big Game when you-all invade on
our privacy? Suh, this isn't fair
sportsmanship."
NO COMMENT
There was no comment from
President Wallace Sterling's office.
Existing plans call for the now
somewhat drabby Village to be
transformed into a modern mecca of
education with emphasis on modern
architecture. Bids are expected to
j go out to competing firms shortly.
Twcnty-four-hour-a-day labor is
expcctcd to go into the project in
order to ready it for use by this
September. An enrollment of 6,000
is expected for the opening of
UCMP. Liberal Arts, Animal Hus
bandry, and Kelp Micronology will
be offered to undergraduates.
TOUGH GRID SKED
A football schedule is being drawn
! up for UCMP and will include such
teams as Menlo - Athcrton, Menlo
College, Mayfield Elementary
School. Potawalamce, and possibly
