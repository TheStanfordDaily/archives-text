# Michigan Trackmen Vie With Cards Tomorrow
## Close Meet Predicted 
### BOB DURAND 
A year ago tomorrow a track
team from the University of
Michigan visited Stanford Stad
ium for a dual meet with tho
Tribe cindermen.
No one was quite sure of the vis
itors' power, but when the smoke
had cleared away the scoreboard
read 86-35 with the Indians on the
short end.
This same Michigan team, minus
and plus a few stars, once again will
take to the Stadium turf timorrow
at 1:30 p.m. to try to make it two in
a row over Jack Weiershauser's
charges.
However, the circumstances on the
Stanford side are different. This
year's Card thinclads are full of tal-

Admission for tomorrow's Stan
ford-Michigan track meet will be
$1.50 for general admission, 50c
for Stanford students, 60c for high
school and junior college students,
and 30c for children. Field events
will start at 1:30, track events at 2.

cnt, spirit, determination, and per
haps what is most important, revenge
for last spring's drubbing.
BIG TEN CHAMPS
However, on the other hand, coach
Don Canham's Wolverines are fresh
from capturing the Big Ten indoor
track championship. This point is
significant in that the collegians
from Ann Arbor swept seven first
places in the meet.
The Tribe, in winning its first two
meets this year, has displayed sev
eral best-of-career performances by
some veterans and quite a few
sparkling efforts by the many sopho
mores on this season's squad.
After much praise for the fine
showings made by his boys in both
practice and in the meets, coach
Weiershauser stated, "We're not go
ing into this meet expecting to lose.
This is a much improved team from
last yearâ€”in both talent and spirit."
As it stands now, the meet figures
to be very close. However, several
come-through performances by eith
er side could make it a decisive
meet.
NO JAVELIN
Also, there will be no javelin
event as the Big Ten does not hold
competition with the spear; Stanford
has two of the best javelin-tossers
in the country in Bob Kimball and
John Bugge.
The Indians have several points in
their favor. These might be the de-
aiding factors in the meet come Sat
urday afternoon.
1) The meet is being held on Stan
ford's home oval. The Card thin
dads know the track and will have
the backing of the crowd.
2) This will be the Wolverine's
first outdoor meet of the season. The
midwest has been snowed in most of
the winter, so that the visitors wilh
have had little, if any, chance to
even practice outdoors.
I!) While competing indoors, the
Maize and Blue have been running
different types of events than those
featured in outdoor events. Their
I strongest points should come in the
middle distance and the mile runs.
4) Michigan's 880 indoor champ
! ion, Peter Gray is reported to have

been laid up with an appendectomy
and will probably not compete to
morrow.
CARDS UNBEATEN
Combine these with what will be
a top effort by a bunch of Indians
who really want to win, on top of
getting revenge, and by late tomor
row afternoon, the Tribe eindermen
might still be unbeaten.
Despite all these "disadvantages"
Michigan is still the Big Ten indoor
champion, and is not to be regarded
lightly. The nucleus of last year's
squad will be back. The only loss
the Wolverines are really feeling
this year is Roland Nilsson, double
Big Ten champ in the shot put and
discus.
The visitor's John Moule ran the
fastest indoor college mile this sea
son with a 4:09.9 and will be gun
ning for a faster time this .spring.
He should also be an important fac
tor in the 880 for the Maize and
Blue.
Junior Stielstra should be a big
point-getter for the Mid westerners
as he will be competing for his third

year in the two hurdle events and
the broad jump.
CLOSE SPRINTS
The 100 and 220 dashes will be
real close. John Vallortigara and
Robert Brown of Michigan will fight
it out with Keith Brownsberger and
Jim Saras of the Tribe.
In the field, Stanford is not a
definite victor in any events, but
has a chance to place first in all of
them. The Tribe's hopes rest with
A 1 Cheney in the shot. Phil Fehlen
in the high jump, Bill Flint in the
pole vault, Frank Herrmann in the
broad jump, and Bob Kimball in the
discus.
The mile relay will }je a close race,
but the Wolverine quartet of
Scruggs, Dick FJodin, Dave Hessler,
and Laird Sloan appears to have a
small edge over the Indian team.
Card Myron Hoi lister, one of
Weiershauser's four men, pulled a
muscle and will not be able to run.
Either Jack Groat or Bob Hyde will
probably combine with Garrett,
Larry Spicer, and Keith Browns
berger to make up the quartet.
