# Michigan Trackmen Vie With Cards Tomorrow
## Close Meet Predicted 
### BOB DURAND 
A year ago tomorrow a track
team from the University of
Michigan visited Stanford Stad
ium for a dual meet with tho
Tribe cindermen.
No one was quite sure of the vis
itors' power, but when the smoke
had cleared away the scoreboard
read 86-35 with the Indians on the
short end.
This same Michigan team, minus
and plus a few stars, once again will
take to the Stadium turf timorrow
at 1:30 p.m. to try to make it two in
a row over Jack Weiershauser's

will start at 1:30, track events at 2.

from Ann Arbor swept seven first
places in the meet.
The Tribe, in winning its first two

After much praise for the fine
showings made by his boys in both
practice and in the meets, coach
Weiershauser stated, "We're not go
ing into this meet expecting to lose.
This is a much improved team from
last year—in both talent and spirit."
As it stands now, the meet figures
to be very close. However, several
come-through performances by eith
er side could make it a decisive
meet.
NO JAVELIN
Also, there will be no javelin
event as the Big Ten does not hold
competition with the spear; Stanford
has two of the best javelin-tossers
in the country in Bob Kimball and
John Bugge.
The Indians have several points in
their favor. These might be the de-
