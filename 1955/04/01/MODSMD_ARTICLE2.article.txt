Compiled from Dispatches of the United Press

810 It LIN, Friday, April 1 â€” The
Communist '"economic blockadc" of
the 110 - mile highway connecting
isolated West Berlin with West Ger
many went into effect at midnight
despite a sharp protest from the
Big Three Western powers.
The Communist East German gov
ernment had ariounccd earlier that
taxes for use of the super-highway
by trucks which carry 40.8 per cent
of West Berlin's food would be
boosted 400 per cent at midnight.
The United States, Britain, and
France protested the action in a
sharp note to Russia, but the taxes
went into effect anyway. The Big
Three protest came after the West
German parliament had appealed
for Allied intervention to break the
new "tax blockadc."
