# student ideas...... an editorial

The announcement in today's Daily of an
AWS committee to help with plans for the new
Florence Moore Hall for women signals a step
in the right direction by the University.
In the rush of dormitory development we
have noted a tendency to forget that the student
must ultimately use the housing facilities pro
vided, and that he may thus have a personal
interest in and valuable suggestions to make
about the design of such facilities. And surely

the complaints of students who live in some
of the older campus dormitories could well be
turned into useful guidance in future dormitory
planning.
The University, in assigning a student com
mit lee from AWS, the three women members
of the Board of Trustees, and Miss Brown to
work with planners of the new women's dorm
itory, has taken cognizance of this. We
look for a resulting product which will better
than ever fulfill the needs of the residents.
