no wafer carnival

To the Editor:
We would like to announce that the Junior Class
will not hold a Water Carnival this year. After care
fully studying the advisability of presenting it, and
conferring with the engineers at the Corp. Yard, it was
decided that the present condition of Lake Lag is too
unfavorable for such an event this quarter. The level
( 112 the lake is dropping at a rate so rapid that over an
inch of rain would be necessary to raise the water to
the necessary level.
Our committee, which has been working on plans

for the Carnival since early winter quarter, pre
sented a report recommending a complete reorganiza
tion of the structure of the Carnival containing sev
eral new ideas which we felt would make the Carnival
a most successful evcr.t had conditions at the lake al
lowed. We would like to make this report available
to the Class of '57 in the hope that it will continue the
tradition of the Carnival next year.
We, as a representative group, are strongly in favor
of holding the Carnival annually, the gophers willing.
