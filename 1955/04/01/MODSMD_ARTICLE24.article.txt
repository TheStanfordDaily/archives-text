A crisis is upon us. We need frogs. Jumping
frogs. Champion jumping frogs.
For the Calaveras Frog Jumping Jubilee,
that's what for.
According to Tuesday's news from Frogtown
in Angel's Camp, site of the Jubilee, a trophy
and a $1000 prize will be awarded to the bestest
jumping frog in inter-collegiate competition.
After a thorough search of Lake Lagunita I
have found many talented frogs, capable of
winning in the best of frog-leaping circles. So,
we have the material and it's talented enough
to bring home the bacon. Eut how we gonna get
it on our team?
Athletic scholarships? Not the answer. These
boys are happy in their ignorance. No schoolin'
for them. They can splash in the lake all day
with no interruptions for classes.
Money? Not for the likes of them. Don't
need loot for the life they lead. All they want
is the water and that they've got, free-for
nothin'.
Wine? They train. Real hustlers.
Women? No ratio problem among the lady
and gentlemen frogs.
Song? They make their own music. Ever

hear those froggy voices on the lake at night?
Fame? Fellow name of Twain immo>talized
the creatures long ago in his story about the
first Calaveras Jubilee.
Glory? This might be the winner. These
boys are athletes. And you know how athletes
eat up that glory bit.
We must get it across to the jumpers that
this Jubilee at Angel's Camp is for the national
championship. The very most. The World
Series of frog jumping.
Why, Sport's Illustrated will certainly run a
story on the winner. The frogs must be shown
that unless they compete this year they'll con
tinue to be thought of as has-beens. Mark
Twain wrote that yarn years ago. The glory has
faded.
It should also be pointed out that in winning
a national championship for Stanford the frogs
will be immortalized along with other Farm
greats, among whom are the world's greatest
athletes.
There is what I believe to be a fine plan of
action to bring these outstanding performers
into the Stanford fold.
Now get out to the lake and convince 'em,
convince 'em.
