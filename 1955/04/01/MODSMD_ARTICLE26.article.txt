# Mazour Says Europe 'Confused, Bewildered' by U.S. War Fears
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
A nation preoccupied with
talk of war, the United States is
creating an atmosphere of con
fusion and bewilderment in Eu
rope, where the threat of war is
not thought likely to materialize.
This is the impression gathered
from a recent visit to Europe by Dr.
Anatole Mazour, professor of his
tory and specialist in the study of
Russia. Dr. Mazour spent five weeks
in England and five months in Fin
land collecting reference material
for a book.
Stressing the bewilderment in
Europe in regard to American ac
tions, Dr. Mazour said that there is
much less talk in Europe of war
than there is in the United States,
where everybody seems to be taking
for granted the absolute certainty
that war will come.
DISPEL CONFUSION
'"There is confusion," he said, "but
not ill-feeling. There" is the feeling
that we do not know what we are
doing, and Americans abroad, in
cluding American embassy staff, do
not do much to dispel this feeling."
"I would wish," he continued,
"that there were more people in
embassies who would think in terms
of the people that they have to live
with rather than mere promotions
and their isolated living." The
Americans in the embassies and
consulates seek to force the Ameri
can way of life on the people, and
yet do little to associate with them
in a social way, Mazour pointed out.
In Finland, where Dr. Mazour

spent the greatest part of his time,
he found that although the prevail
ing feeling is pro-American, the
people themselves "pray only for no
clash between the two great powers.
And they are not interested," he
said, "in Big Power conferences be
cause they know they will be the
ones who 'get it in the neck'."
"Also," he reminded, "they are

aware that the United Stales is far
across the wator and the Russians
are at their doorstep."
TRADi: NOT All>
"They, as ul! other European
countries, are interested in trade
with the United States, but what,"
j he asked, "have we done to help
I them?"
Declaring that Europe is inter
ested in trade and not direct aid,
Mazour explained that "Europeans
J can figure out trade, but it is aid
J that they can't understand since
j they feel that there is something
I else behind it."
Relaxation of the situation is not
I likely, Mazour believes, since there
are strong indications that tariffs
will remain high for defense pur
! poses.
Turning to the recent Aruba in
| cident, Ma/our explained that the
whole situation was a private agree
ment negotiated between a Finnish
i shipping company and Communist
China arranging for a shipment of
jet fuel to be sent from Finland to
| China, breaking the United Nations
blockade of the Communist country.
The Finnish government, he em

Europe in regard to American ac
tions, Dr. Mazour said that there is
much less talk in Europe of war
than there is in the United States,
where everybody seems to be taking
for granted the absolute certainty
that war will come.
DISPEL CONFUSION
'"There is confusion," he said, "but
not ill-feeling. There" is the feeling
that we do not know what we are
doing, and Americans abroad, in
cluding American embassy staff, do
not do much to dispel this feeling."
"I would wish," he continued,
"that there were more people in
embassies who would think in terms
of the people that they have to live
with rather than mere promotions
and their isolated living." The
Americans in the embassies and
consulates seek to force the Ameri
can way of life on the people, and
yet do little to associate with them
in a social way, Mazour pointed out.
In Finland, where Dr. Mazour

spent the greatest part of his time,
he found that although the prevail
ing feeling is pro-American, the
people themselves "pray only for no
clash between the two great powers.
And they are not interested," he
said, "in Big Power conferences be
cause they know they will be the
ones who 'get it in the neck'."
"Also," he reminded, "they are

aware that the United Stales is far
across the wator and the Russians
are at their doorstep."

"They, as ul! other European
countries, are interested in trade
with the United States, but what,"
j he asked, "have we done to help
I them?"
Declaring that Europe is inter
ested in trade and not direct aid,
Mazour explained that "Europeans
J can figure out trade, but it is aid
J that they can't understand since
j they feel that there is something
I else behind it."
Relaxation of the situation is not
I likely, Mazour believes, since there
are strong indications that tariffs
will remain high for defense pur
! poses.
Turning to the recent Aruba in

whole situation was a private agree
ment negotiated between a Finnish
i shipping company and Communist
China arranging for a shipment of
jet fuel to be sent from Finland to

blockade of the Communist country.

—"Confusion, but not ill-feeling"
A nation preoccupied with
talk of war, the United States is
creating an atmosphere of con
fusion and bewilderment in Eu
rope, where the threat of war is
not thought likely to materialize.
This is the impression gathered
from a recent visit to Europe by Dr.
Anatole Mazour, professor of his
tory and specialist in the study of
Russia. Dr. Mazour spent five weeks
in England and five months in Fin
land collecting reference material
for a book.
