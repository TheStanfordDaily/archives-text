I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU
Tt is my earnest hope that an occasional column of mine has
pleased you enough to make you want to clip it out and keep it.
But I'm sure that being preoccupied with more important thing's
— like getting down to breakfast before your room-mate eats
all the marmalade — the impulse has passed and been forgotten.
So 1 am pleased now to report that the makers of Philip Morris
Cigarettes, bless their corporate hearts, have published a booklet
called MAX SHULMAN REVISITED, which contains six of
my favorite columns, along with some brand new material, all
of this profusely illustrated—all of this available to you gratis
when you buy a couple of packs of Philip Morris at your favorite
tobacco counter on or near your campus.
But this is not the only news I've got for you today. Following
you will find a roundup of news highlights from campuses the
country over.
Southern Reserve University
Dr. Willard Hale Sigafoos, head of the department of an
thropology at Southern Reserve University and internationally
known as an authority on primitive peoples, returned yesterday
from a four year scientific expedition to the headwaters of the
Amazon River. Among the many interesting mementos of his
journey is his own head, shrunk to the size of a kumquat. lie
refused to reveal how his head shrinking was accomplished.
"That's for me to know and you to find out," he said with a
tiny, but saucy grin.
Northern Reserve I'niversity
Dr. Mandrill Gibbon, head of the department of zoology at
Northern Reserve University and known to young and old for
his work on primates, announced yesterday that he had received
a grant of $80,000,000 for a twelve year study to determine
precisely how much fun there is in a barrel of monkeys.
Whatever the results of I)r. Gibbon's researches, this much
is already known: what's more fun that a barrel of monkeys is
a pack of Philip Morris. There's zest and cheer iu every puff,
delight in every draw, content and well-being in every fleecy,
flavorful cloudlet. And, what's more, this merriest of cigarettes,
king-size and regular, comes in the exclusive Philip Morris
Snap-Open pack. A gentle tug on the tab and the package pops
obligingly open. A gentle push on the open pack and it silently
folds itself back, sealing in the savory vintage tobacco until
you are ready to smoke again.
Eastern Reserve University
The annual meeting of the American Philological Institute,
held last week at Eastern Reserve University, was enlivened
by the reading of two divergent monographs concerning the
origins of early Gothic "runes," as letters of primitive alphabets
are called.
Dr. Tristram Lathrop Spleen, famed far and wide as the
discoverer of the High German Consonant Shift, read a paper
in which he traced the origins of the Old Wendish rune "pt"
(pronounced "krahtz") to the middle Lettic rune "gr" (pro
nounced "albert"). On the other hand, Dr. Richard Cummerbund
Twonkey, who, as the whole world knows, translated The Pa jama
Game into Middle High Bactrian, contended in his paper that
the Old Wendish rune "pt" derives from the Low Erse rune "mf"
(pronounced "gr").
Well, sir, the discussion grew so heated that Dr. Twonkey
finally asked Dr. Spleen if he would like to step into the gym
nasium and put on the gloves. Dr. Spleen accepted the challenge
promptly, but the contest was never held because there were
no gloves in the gymnasium that would fit Dr. Twonkey.
(The reader is doubtless finding this hard to believe as
Eastern Reserve University is celebrate*! the length and breadth
of the land for the size of its glove collect ion. However, the reader
is asked to remember that Dr. Twonkey has extraordinarily
small hands and arms. In fact, he spent the last war working
in a small arms plant, where he received two Navy "E" Awards
and was widely hailed as a "manly little chap.")
