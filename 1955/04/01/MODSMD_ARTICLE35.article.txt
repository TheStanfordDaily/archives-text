# All-Campus Apache Dance Is Tomorrow
## 
### 
A portion of Paris is being
built onto the campus at the
Theta Xi house.
It will be the site for the an
nual all-campus "Apache Dance"
to take place from 9 p.m. to 1
a.m. tomorrow night.
Decorations will follow a "French
cafe" theme. The main hall walls
will be covered with black paper and
then painted with phosphorescent
murals. Four projectors will shine
on them to create the "black light"
effect.
Apaches will enter the building
through the "sewer" at the back
door. The basement will be free re
freshment headquarters and will be
decorated to simulate an under
ground cafe, complete with sawdust
and barrel tables.
Upstairs there will be a rooftop
cafe, following the theme, along
with French music.
"The dress," says Don Neuman,
dance chairman, "can be tight slit
skirts or full can-can skirts for the
girls, with sweaters or peasant
blouses. The boys," he said, "can
wear loose pants, T-shirts, turtle
neck sweaters, berets, scarves, or
anything else they can think of.
Originality is encouraged," he said;
"wear what you want."
Danceable American and French
records will be played throughout
the evening, and a photographer will
be on hand to take pictures. , *
