# Papooses to Enter Four-Way Meet
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
Tlie frosh cinderburners open
their eight - meet season tomorrow
when they tackle Sacramento, Hart
neli, and San Mateo JC's. The four
wey meet will be staged at Angell
Field starting at 10:30 a.m.
According to frosh coach Hay
Jean, the Little Indians will receive
.he most trouble at the hands of
Sacramento. The capital city boys
are perennial JC powerhouses and
are particularly deep this year in
most-events.
PAPOOSE ACES
Dean's squad is not without hope,
however, and with Doug Dick, Joel
Fries, and Army DeWeese of frosh
football fame combining with Don
Richardson, Dick Stein, and Maury
Graves, the home boys are slated to
give the Hornets a run for their
money.
Hartnell and San Mateo shouldn't
cause much trouble if they run true
to form tomorrow.
The frosh appear to be strongest
in the following events: 880, high
and low hurdles, shot put, and the
discus. They are potentially strong
in the mile if Maury Graves can

| return to his 1954 form when, as a
senior in high school, he circled the
course in 4:28.3.
In the half-mile, Richard on has
been clocked at 1:59. G and, if
pressed, could conceivably better
this. Dean is looking for a win in
this event. Chuck Cobb and Bob
| Nqwman will carry the load in the
| hurdle events and can be counted on
for points. DeWeese will join Ray
Williamson and Jim Hart in both
the shot put and discus events.
DICK IN CENTURY
Doug Dick is Dean's best century
man but so far this year has only
been able to turn in a slow 10.3.
However, Dean is confident that
Dick and Wally Oates, the second
dash man, can lower their times as
the season progresses.
The quarter mile appears to be
a toss-up as far as first and second
men are concerned. Joel Fries/.and
Dick Morehouse are at present
evenly matched. Both are capable
of taking points, especially since to
morrow's meet will see the first four
men in each events receiving points
on a 5-3-2-1 basis.
