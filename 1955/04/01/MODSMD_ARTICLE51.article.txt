Stanford's varsity baseball team has three tough assignments
this weekend. The Indians meet UCLA today on the sunken dia
mond at 3:15 and Santa Clara in a doubleheader at 1:00 on ihe
Washington Park Diamond.
The Everett Dean-coached Cards put their title hopes on ihe

block tod:.y again, l the hard-hlttin7,
top-pitching Uclans, who sport a 3-0
CIBA record ; > far this season.
Slartimi ay.ain-t l■)■ • Cards probably
will be Bruin Bob Nk'hols, who has
a Kr.e 7-0 record for the season and
who pitched a four-hitter against
Santa Clara last weekend.
CARDS ICKADY
According to Dean* tho Indian
base bailors art ready to play their
bo.t baii. Dead and finals weeks cut
into the Stanford baseball reason
and so the Cards have been a little
slow in rounding out. However, the
team i.s now at a physical peak as

.star pitcher Hay Young, who suf- j
fc-red a sore arm against USC, is j
well again. Dean is also /pleased !
with Hurler Walt Payne, who j
pitched a top game down south last ]
weekend.
In the hitting department, Rudy
Figueroa. Bob Evans, and Lennie
Swartz all were praised by Dean for
their improving stick work.
FACE TOP HURLER
Tomorrow, the Cards lace another
four-hit pitcher, Dick Simoni, who
lias a -1-1 record for the Broncos, in
the first game, and Ray Stanley (2-2)
in the second. This doubleheader
will be the first meeting of the two
clubs. On the hitting side, the Cards i
! should be favored, as Santa Clara
could only collect nine hits in 18
innings against UCLA.
The Bruins are supposed to be the
hardest-hitting UCLA team in 11 j
years, according to Bruin mentor .
Arthur Reichle. The job of silencing ;
the big Bruin bats will fall to either I
Payne or Young today and Ed Ver- :
durmen with either Payne or Young, |
whoever doesn't start today, hurling |
in the doubleheader tomorrow.
Starting lineup for the Indians:
