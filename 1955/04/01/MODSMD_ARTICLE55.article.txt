## 
### 
"W„ :\T.vi.k I hear anyone claiming that
I>ibusiness is bad lor small business. I think
of my own ease.
"Back in 1932 I leased this I nion ( )il serv ice
st.ation in Venice, California. with $350 niy
wile and I had saved the hard w.iy. \ow at 46
I'm financially independent. But I'd never
have made it so soon without the Union Oil
Company.

"They taught mc how to buy. Mow to sell.
How to service. Kven how to hire and train
help, and keep my books.
"They'd spend thousands of dollars perfect
ing new service ideas, then p;iss cm on to mc
for nothing.
"Best of all. people practically took Union's
gasoline and motor oil away Irom me. 1 hey
were always the finest in the West.
"Well, business was so good ljiad the station
paid for by 1939. 1 hen 1 started buying real
estate around it. Today my net worth's in the
six figures. The children are through eollegc
and on their own. Marjorie and 1 are going to

travel while we're still young enough to enjoy
it. But believe me—l'd nei-er have done halj so well

if 1 hadn't been in business with big business!"
