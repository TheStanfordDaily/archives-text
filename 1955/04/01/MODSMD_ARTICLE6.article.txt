members of the Board of Trustees —
Mrs. Allan E. Charles, Mrs. Roger
Goodan, and Mrs. Robert L. Lipman
—will represent the female interest
in the planning for the new women's
residence.
WORKING QUICKLY
The committee is one of the groups
which is working quickly to as
semble any new ideas and all the
planning data of various studies of
the last 10 years so that preliminary
plans can be prepared for the April
21 meeting of the Board of Trustees.
Earlier this week the committee
met with the women members of the
Board and with the architect, Milton
T. Pfluegcr of San Francisco. A
meeting is planned for next week
with the Planning Office of the Uni
versity.
Dean of Students 11. Donald Win
bigler outlined the planning situ
ation to the presidents of all living
groups which met with the commit
tee yesterday.
HOUSE DISCUSSIONS
The group presidents will discuss
the new dorm in house meetings
Monday and will report all sug
gestions to the committee for further
action.
Dean Winbigler stressed the fact
that none of the plans are "frozen"
yet and that the University is defi
nitely open to suggestions. He also
spoke of the need for speed in the
planning.
Any students having ideas for the
new dorm are asked by Miss Fergu
son to present them to house presi
dents on Monday or to any mem
bers of the committee.
The design of the residence will
try to preserve the advantages of
small living groups while it utilizes
many single unit advantages. Each
living unit for 50 women will have
its own lounge, kitchenette, and din
ing room. But each unit will operate
from a single kitchen, reception area,
and communications set-up.
