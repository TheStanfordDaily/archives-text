Meeting for the third conse
cutive night, the Executive Com
mittee last night continued its
word-for-word review of the lat
est revision of the proposed new
ASSU Constitution.
In a prolonged discussion, Excom
reworded a section of the proposed
Constitution dealing with adminis
trative boards.
According to the section as event
ually passed for inclusion in the
proposed Constitution, ASSU admin
istrative boards under the new Con
stitution would operate under ASSU
bylaws which could be proposed by
either the board itself or the legis
lature, would have to be approved
by the legislature before entering
into forcc, and could be incorporated
into the Constitution bylaws them
selves.
The section as passed was reword
ed from a proposed version drawn
up by Junior representative Dave
Brownwood. Brownwood stated his
position as being in favor of bringing
board bylaws into the ASSU Bylaws
structure.

of sections referring to election of
members of the legislature and the
duties of the legislature. Excorn
hopes to have the Constitution
printed and discussions on it begun
by the middle of next week.
