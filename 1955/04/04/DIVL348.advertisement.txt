chanical engineers: The radiation lab
oratory at Berkeley and I-ivermorc cm
ploys over 100 mechanical engineers
engaged in the design of a wide range
of equipment for use in fundamental and
applied scientific investigation. This
work includes nuclear and thermo
nuclear test devices and instrumenta
tion, high energy particle nccelcratoi
ultra high speed cameras, large scale
high vacuum equipment, devices for re
mote control in high radiation fields,
equipment for remote handling and
processing of radioactive materials, and
accessory equipment for nuclear real
tors. Organization is on a project Las::/
with close contact between engineers
and scientists and the extensive labora
tory shops. Emphasis is not on design
ing for production manufacture. The
work calls for an understanding of
principles and ingenuity rather than the
application of standard practices. The
projects of the laboratory include piac
