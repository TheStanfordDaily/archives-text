# Variety of Animals Adds Life to Orchesis
## 
### SYDNEY LITTLE 
Reindeer pranced, camels
bounced, and a donkey groped
stubbornly across the stage at
Memorial Hall Friday and Sat
urday nights in the annual
Orchesis Concert.
Indeed, the atunuds, or the stu
dents who portrayed them, added
some of the few light touches to an
otherwise serious and somewhat
slow-moving program.
Four girls dressed as camels, com
plete with humped backs and
stringy tails, frolicked around an
oasis with two harem girls in "Cara
van." The choreography of Lynn
Lercara effectively simulated- the
ungainly movements of the desert
beasts.
PRANCING REINDEER
Another humorous performance
was given by girls dressed in white
leotards with cotton puff tails and
decorative antlers as they portrayed
light-footed "reindeer."
Among the more serious inter
pretations was "Machine Age."
Danced with vigorous repetitive mo
tions to the music of Stravinsky, this
dance showed the effect of the mo
notony of factory-type jobs on in
dividuals. "Rhythm and Drums,"
another precision-type dance, was
performed by a group of 14 in black
costumes to the accompaniment of
a primitive drum rhythm.
In "Eastern Impression" three ori
ental figures in long, golden gauze
skirts approached the black-clad
idol on his pedestal in the temple.
The use of syncopated oriental hand
motions gave an eerie effect.
PASSES AT GLASSES
"Men Seldom Make Passes" was
an attempt to show that even near

sighted men prefer girls who do not j
wear glasses. Bill Davis danced with
the four be-spectacled females, and j
when three of the girls threw away
their glasses he left his original love
clouding her lenses with tears.
Seven situation showing how the |
passage of time seems to vary in ;
speed were danced to the music of
Chuck Chesnut. In each of these
scenes the performers seemed to
be acting rather than dancing, for
while the choreography adequately
portrayed the feelings of the sub
jects there was little movement in
volved.
OTHER DANCES
Other dances included ' Just for
Fun," a duet by Chris Hunt and Lou
Ann Hargraves; "Nightmare" with
Mary Sherman as the dreamer be
ing chased by a group of demons;
"Svenska Rhapsody," a gay danee
in the folk idiom; and "Sinistra,"
done by a trio in masks with black
and orange costumes.
Chris Hunt and Claudette Yeo
man danced together as the donkey
Eog in the light-hearted children's
story of the man and boy taking
their beast to market.
Sets, costumes, and choreography
were worked out by Orchesis and
the choreography class. Margaret P.
Duggar is adviser to the club and
Edith A. Strickland is accompanist.

PASSES AT GLASSES
"Men Seldom Make Passes" was
an attempt to show that even near

sighted men prefer girls who do not j
wear glasses. Bill Davis danced with
the four be-spectacled females, and j
when three of the girls threw away
their glasses he left his original love
clouding her lenses with tears.
Seven situation showing how the |
passage of time seems to vary in ;
speed were danced to the music of
Chuck Chesnut. In each of these
scenes the performers seemed to
be acting rather than dancing, for
while the choreography adequately
portrayed the feelings of the sub
jects there was little movement in
volved.
OTHER DANCES
Other dances included ' Just for
Fun," a duet by Chris Hunt and Lou
Ann Hargraves; "Nightmare" with
Mary Sherman as the dreamer be
ing chased by a group of demons;
"Svenska Rhapsody," a gay danee
in the folk idiom; and "Sinistra,"
done by a trio in masks with black
and orange costumes.
Chris Hunt and Claudette Yeo
man danced together as the donkey
Eog in the light-hearted children's
story of the man and boy taking
their beast to market.
Sets, costumes, and choreography
were worked out by Orchesis and
the choreography class. Margaret P.
Duggar is adviser to the club and
Edith A. Strickland is accompanist.
Reindeer pranced, camels
bounced, and a donkey groped
stubbornly across the stage at
Memorial Hall Friday and Sat
urday nights in the annual
Orchesis Concert.
Indeed, the atunuds, or the stu
dents who portrayed them, added
some of the few light touches to an
otherwise serious and somewhat
slow-moving program.
Four girls dressed as camels, com
plete with humped backs and
stringy tails, frolicked around an
oasis with two harem girls in "Cara
van." The choreography of Lynn
Lercara effectively simulated- the
ungainly movements of the desert
beasts.
PRANCING REINDEER
Another humorous performance
was given by girls dressed in white
leotards with cotton puff tails and
decorative antlers as they portrayed
light-footed "reindeer."
Among the more serious inter
pretations was "Machine Age."
Danced with vigorous repetitive mo
tions to the music of Stravinsky, this
dance showed the effect of the mo
notony of factory-type jobs on in
dividuals. "Rhythm and Drums,"
another precision-type dance, was
performed by a group of 14 in black
costumes to the accompaniment of
a primitive drum rhythm.
In "Eastern Impression" three ori
ental figures in long, golden gauze
skirts approached the black-clad
idol on his pedestal in the temple.
The use of syncopated oriental hand
motions gave an eerie effect.
