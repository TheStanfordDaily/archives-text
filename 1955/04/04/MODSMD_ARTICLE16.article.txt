### 
All women students will have
j an opportunity to express their
! desires ior plans for the new
Florence Moore Hall tonight in
j house meetings.
j The house presidents met last
week with the Dorm Planning Com
mittee, and they will civc a brief
description of the tentative plans
j before throwing the discussion open.
These suggestions will be taken to
the Dorm Planning Committee and
will be incorporated in the commit
tee's suggested plans.
I The Dorm Planning Committee is
composed of a committee of eight,
undergraduate women headed by
Lynn Ferguson. Its purpose is to
help draw up plans for the new
i Florence Moore Halt which will be
â–  built by the fall of '56.
Tentatively the residence hall is
| to accommodate approximately 350
women with each of the seven resi

dences housing 50 women. Each res
idence will have its own dining hall
and social area.
The ground floor will include a
social lounge with kitchenette al
cove; a dining room which will be
designed to serve dual functions;
and a main lounge with a fireplace.
Also there may be small date rooms,
rest room facilities for both men and
women, storage rooms, and laundry
room.
The second floor of the three
story building will be composed of a
sitting room, ironing alcoves, resi
dent assistant quarters, bath facili
ties, and living quarters.
The third floor will be similar to
the second but without the sitting
room or resident assistant quarters.
In addition, the third floor may have
a sun deck.
The individual study bedrooms
will be generally square - shaped
doubles, and each will have built
in closets and dressers. Closets will

consist of a minimum of five feet
of hanging space for each girl. One
entire side of the room will be win
dows, and a molding will go around
the other three walls to facilitate
hanging of pictures and bulletin
boards. There will be four singles in
each residence.
A large parking lot is planned for
each house, and the administration
building will have a work shop room
with mimeograph machines and
. cwing machines.
Such questions as type of floors
dcisred; whether the rooms should
all be painted in a neutral color or
whether the rooms should be done
in different pastel colors will be
discussed tonight.
The AWS Dorm Planning Com
mittee reminds the students that
none of the plans arc definite and
that the purpose of the discussions
tonight is to find out exactly what
the students want included in the
new dorm.
