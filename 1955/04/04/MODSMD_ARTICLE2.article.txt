# Tribe Nine Thumps Bruins, Broncs For Three CIBA Weekend Victories
## 
### JIM BAKER 
A hard-hitting Indian nine es
lablished themselves as one of
the CIBA title contenders over
the weekend, as they whipped
heretofore unbeaten UCLA on
Friday, 11-2, on a wind-blown
Sunken Diamond, and then
grabbed both ends of a double
header against Santa Clara on
Saturday, 16-4 and 11-3 on the
loser's field.
The Cards showed new batting

prowess as they banged out. 40 hits
and 38 runs in the three games to
raise their league record to a re
| spectable 3 and 2. Rudy Figueroa
I led the Stanford hitters with 7 for
12, and is now batting .571 in the
| league. Pitcher Walt Payne and
shortstop Rich Scramaglia also
showed top batting form with 4 for
I 6 and 4 for 11 respectively.
| TOP PITCHING
I Hurlers Ray Young and Payne
; turned in top perfoi-manccs in the !
j three games. Young scattered eight j
j UCLA hits and struck out eight on
j Friday, while Payne pitched the first
I five innings of the first Santa Clara

game, allowing only three hits, and
then came back to hurl the night
cap, spacing five hits over the seven
innings and striking out five.
On Friday the Uclans just couldn't
stop the hungry Cards, and saw
their unbeaten (7-0) ace chucker,
Don Nichols, pelted out in the fourth
inning after surrendering seven runs
and 11 hits. The UCLA loss was
their first against three CIBA wins.
RIG INNING
Santa Clara coach Chuck Bcdoila
couldn't find a pitcher to hold the
Red Indians on Saturday afternoon.
In the first inning the Cards batted
around as seven of the first eight
men who came up scored. Doubles
! by Figueroa and Mickey Holzman
and singles by Lennie Swartz, Dixie
Workman, Hal Mcssner, Payne, and
; Sid Hall gave the Cards a seven-
run advantage with which they
coasted in.
The Santa Clara pitchers also
helped the Stanford can c by giving
up 18 walks to the Indians. Ten of
the e walks were turned into runs,
â€¢and helped the Indians to their first
. oubleheader sweep.
By virtue of the three straight
wins garnered over the weekend,
tin* Cards climbed out of the league
cellar and into third place behind
UCLA ;;nd USC.
The Indians' only weakness ap
pears now to be the lack of expe
rienced pitchers. However, this

should work out after a few more
games. If they can continue their
fine hitting for the rest of the sea
son, the Indians could give the other
teams in the league a tough battle.
In other CIBA name played this
weekend, Cal beat Santa Clara on
Friday, 5-1, and split with UCT.A on
Saturday, 5-4 and 4-10.
