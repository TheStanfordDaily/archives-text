# two weeks to think ....... an editorial
## 
### 
After almost a year of hard work, Excom has
passed a draft of a proposed new consitiution
lor the Associated Students of Stanford Uni
versity . . . and the document they have pro
duced iooks very good to us.
Excom members will be explaining the pro
posed constitution io the student body during
ihe next two weeks, and you'll be able to see
the improved features the new setup would
offer:
Betier representation on student government.

Better coordination between fields of activi
ties.
More participation in student government.
Better definition of the duties of many stu
dent body officers.
More student control of many activities im
portant to them.
These are a few of the points to observe
when Excom presents its draft consitution. Two
weeks from now, on April 19 and 20, you'll be
voting to accept or reject this constitution.
Study it thoughtfully . . . we think you'll like it.
