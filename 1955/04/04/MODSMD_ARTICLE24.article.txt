# Application of Atomic Power to Industry Is Topic of SRI-Sponsored Conference
## 
### DICK MEISTER 
As part of its program of re
search, the Stanford Research
Institute is co-sponsoring a con
{erence this week on Ine appli
:ation of atomic power to in
dustry.
The conference, first West Coast
meeting on applied industrial uses
pf atomic energy, will be held at
San Francisco's Mark Hopkins Hotel
today and tomorrow. Acting with
SRI as sponsor is the Atomic Indus
trial Forum of New York City.
Several meetings are planned
which d?al with varied aspects of
atomic energy's application to in
dustry. They will include (he gen
eral topics "Food and Agriculture,"
"Specialized Uses of Reactors,"
"Progress Toward Nuclear Power,"
"Related Industries," "Atomic En
ergy and the Oil Industry," and
"Ramifications of Atomic Energy."
OPEN INC; ADDRESS
Opening day address will be a
major policy .speech by Morehead
Patterson, United States represen
tative for international atomic en
ergy negotiations, according to SRI
officials. Patterson plans to discuss
the steps which have been taken to
implement President Eisenhower's
"Atoms for Peace" program. Pat
terson's speech will be broadcast at
8:30 tonight over station KGO, San
Francisco, on a national hookup.
A special address on the ramifica
tions of atomic energy in labor is
also scheduled. Speaking on the
subject will be Charles F. MacGow
an, international representative, In- i
ternational Brotherhood of Boiler
makers, Iron Shipbuilders, and
Helpers of America, AFL.
LUNCHEON SPEAKERS
In scheduled luncheon sessions
Dr. Edward Teller, who led the sci
entific development of the hydrogen
bomb, and Dr. Glenn Seaborg, No
bel Prize-winner in chemistry, will
speak. Both men are at the Uni
versity of California.
At each of the several meetings I
listed there will be talks on specific |
topics concerning application of
atomic energy to almost every major
industry in the United States.
At tomorrow's afternoon session
George Fox Trowbridge, Washing- j
ton, D.C., attorney, will discuss the !
atomic energy act of 1954.
DISCUSSION SUBJECTS
Of the range of subjects to be dis- I
cussed at the meetings, the most sig- j
nificant, according to SRI, are the i
following:
1. Recent progress in the develop- I
mcnt of nuclear power plants.
2. Potential uses of nuclear reac
tors for industrial research and the
production of process heat and ra- 1
diation.
3. Applications of atomic energy
in the food industry, including cold
sterilization and the eradication of I
insects.
4. Atomic energy applications in
the oil industry, including petroleum ■
production, petroleum utilitzation,
and research.
5. Products and services required
by an expanding atomic energy in
dustry.
6. Ramifications of atomic energy j
in such related fields as finance, j
insurance, and education.
Conference sponsors expect ap
proximately 500 industrial leaders
from all over the nation to attend
the two-day meetings and have an
nounced that sessions will be open
to all persons interested in atomic j
energy applications in industry.

Sessions are scheduled to begin at
9:30 a.m. today and conclude at 5
p.m. tomorrow.


HOT COBALT—Part of SRl'a atomic research involves the use
of radioactive cobalt 60. which the operator is handling. This is '
used in gamma radiation in studies of the effects of radiation on
food products, polymerization and other chemical reactions.
SRl's source is now one of the largest outside of Atomic Energy-
Commission installations. —SRI photo, i
