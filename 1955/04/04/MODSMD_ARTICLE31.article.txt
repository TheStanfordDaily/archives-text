# 67-54
## Stanford's Track Team Loses to U. of Michigan 
### BOB DURAND 
A power-laden Big Ten champion track team from the University
! of Michigan swept ten first places against Stanford's previously un
beaten cinderrnen Saturday afternoon as they triumphed, 67 1 7 3
to 54 2 3, in Stanford Stadium.
A chilly north wind that resulted in slow times for all the races

blew throughout the meet, which
was decisively but not easily won
by the Wolverines.
A crowd of 10,000 watched the two
Learns battle nip and tuck until the
880 -yard run when the visitors
j swept all three places to j-ive them
a lead which they never relin
| quished.
The Indians were able to garner
! firsts only in the 440 and the broad
jump, discus throw, and high jump.
However, they kept the margin close
by garnering numerous second
places.
CARRETT WINS
Walt Garrett, the Tribe's able
cjuarter-miler who is having his best
year on the cinders, brought home
the only track win for coach Jack
Weiershauser when he shook off
Michigan's Grant.Scruggs and
romped home in :49.3.
Perhaps the best individual effort
by the Cards came in the broad
jump as sophomore star Frank Herr
mann came through with the two
best jumps of his youpg career to
easily take first place in the event.
On his first official jump, Herr
mann leaped 23-7 l k to increase his
former best by three and one-half
inches. On his next try, the prom
ising sophomore again put forth a
mighty effort and this time the tape
measured 23-9%, a distance never
challenged by any other competitor
during the meet.
SURPRISE WIN
Two surprise winners also showed
up for the Indians. Jim Truher, vir
tually unknown in discus circles,
heaved the plate 145-7V2 to handily
win the event. The Card junior's
toss was the best of his career also.
The other surprise came in the
high jump as John Stewart, who had
been disappointing in his first two

meets; this season, outdid teammate
Phil Fehlen and the Maize and
Blue's Mark Booth and cleared the
bar at (!-5 to edge the latter, whose
best leap was C-4.
As expeetsd, the Wolverines were
strongest in the middle distances and
the mile and two-mile runs.
John Moule showed the form
which made him national indoor col
legiate mile champion as tie sprinted
the entire last lap to easily out
distance teammate Hobe Jones and
Stanford's Will King. The veteran
turned in a lime of 4:20.7, which is
very creditable considering the
wind.
