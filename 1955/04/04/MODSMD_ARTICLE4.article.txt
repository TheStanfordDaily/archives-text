"friendship" treaties with Britain
and France has been made "un

German rearmament pacts.
The official government newspa

treaties would become "a screen be
hind which Britain's and France's
ruling circles would hide their par
ticipation in a bloc with the Bonn
revenge - seekers, spearheaded
against the Soviet Union."
Izvestia charged the move to re
arm the West Germans tends to "in
crease the danger of war," but said

trend toward "new conflicts."
