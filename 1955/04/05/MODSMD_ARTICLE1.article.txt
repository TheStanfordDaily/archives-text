# 24-HOUR AGENDA
## Stanford Considers Plans For Soviet Editors' Visit 
### BILL WEIGHT Associate Editor, The Daily 
The University began yesterday to outline an itinerary for next
month's campus visit of the 11 Russian student and youth news
paper who will be touring the country.
The Russian group will arrive at the University during the
evening of Monday, May 2, and will remain until the morning of
Wednesday, May 4. ♦

Stanford is planning a 24-hour
agenda which will show the Rus
sians the various aspects of student
life, provide an opportunity for an
change of ideas between Stanford
students and the visitors, demon
strate the functions of a private
university in the United States, and
yet will not be a rigorous, humdrum
sightseeing trip.
Two officials of the Institute of In
ternational Education — Arthur C.
Nagle, director of special programs,
and Mrs. Paul Eliel, West Coast di
rector— met with University offi
cials and ASSU officers yesterday
to discuss plans for the Russians'
visit.
30-DAY U.S. TRIP
The lIE is administering the 30-
day cross-country trip of the Soviet
group. The entire cost is being paid
by the Russian government.
The information received from
Nagle, who is acting as an "ad
vance man" for the tour, was the
first indication the University had
oT the exact role it would play. Thus
definite plans could not be initiated
until yesterday afternoon.
At this time, no hour - by - hour
schedule has been worked out and
most plans are strictly tentative.
Another meeting of University offi
cials and students will be held today
at 1:15 p.m. in President Sterling's
office to develop the program fur
ther.
lIOOVEK LIBE VISIT
Whatever agenda is decided upon
will probably include a visit to Hoo
ver Library, some type of forum
discussion handled by the Institute
of International Relations, and a
meeting between the Russians and
the Executive Committee.
About half the Russian group will
be graduate students who edit their
university papers, Nagle said, and
the other half will lie professional
journalists who are editors of So
viet youth publications. Their ages

run from 23 to 39 years.
Also traveling with the Russians
will be two American interpreters
supplied by the IIE; both are grad
uate students at the Russian Affairs
Institute at Columbia University.
ARRIVE ON APRIL 29
According to Nagle, the Russians
will arrive at San Francisco Airport
from Albuquerque late in the eve
ning of Friday, April 29. They will
tour the Bay Area for three days
before coming to Stanford.
The University will be responsible
j for housing the Russian editors for
two nights. Tentatively, they will
stay at two or three fraternities or a
residence hall. Both Nagle and Mrs.
Eliel expressed a desire to house
tbom in fraternities.
Other ideas which may be worked
into the program for the visitors in
clude a reception at Bowman Mon
day night, a visit to the Microwave
Laboratory to see the linear accel
erator, lunch at Union, a visit to the
Sunken Diamond for the Stanford
baseball game with Sacramento
State, and a barbecue dinner.
FIVE DISCUSS PLANS
Attending yesterday's meeting
were Frederick O. Glover, assistant
to the president; H. Donald Winbig
ler, dean of students; Pete C. Allen,
director of information and publica
tions; Virginia Waxman of the IIR;
and Pete Bing, ASSU president.
Visas were granted to the 11 Rus
sians after the State and Justice De
partments determined that the visit
was in the national interest, Nagle
said. The Soviet government first
applied for permission to tour the
country two years ago.
The group of editors will arrive
in the United States on the Queen i
Elizabeth on April 19. New York, j
Williamsburg, Tuskegee, and Albu
querque will be stopping points for
the Russians before they arrive in
the Bay Area. Denver and Chicago I
will also be on the route.
