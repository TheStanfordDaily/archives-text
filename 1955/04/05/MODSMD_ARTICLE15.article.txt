# Radar 'Spider' Web Traps Meteors, Weather Data
## Operates From Stanford Hilltop 
### 
From its perch on a Stanford
| hilltop, a spider-like radar device |
is weaving a radio net across the j
| skies to "trap" tiny meteors and
I 'hereby collect new information
i about radio communications,
.
! weather, and the solar system in
i general.
Nicknamed the "Spider," it is op-
I era tod by Dr. Von B. E-hleman and
j graduate student Thomas V. Har-
I roun of the Radio Propagation Lab-
I oratory.
Laboratory scientists designed and
| built it to study the smallest meteors
| detectable by radar—primarily those
midway in size between grains of j
| sand and specks of dust.
Importance of these "stardust"
particles from outer space was dem-
I onstrated earlier in Navy-sponsored
j investigations by Professors O. G.
Villard Jr., Laurence A. Manning,
i and Dr. Allen M. Peterson.
Long-distance radio signals can!
| be "bounced" oil the meteor trails,
j the Stanford group discovered. This
; may brine relief to overcrowded ra
| dio communication channels that |
now depend on the solar-generated |
ionosphere to reflect signals.


METEOR HUNTER—This meteor-tracking "Spider," used in radar work, is being operated here
by the University's Radio Propagation Laboratory under the direction of Dr. Von R. Eshleman.
This apparatus throws a radar net across the sky to detect tiny meteors for information useful
to radio communications, weather forecasting, and study of the solar system. The "Spider" was
built by Stanford radio engineers with sponsorship of the Air Force Cambridge Research Center.
