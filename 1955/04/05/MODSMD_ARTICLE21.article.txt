Parking problems at the University of South
on California h<?. led to the inauguration, of
"bike week." This program is (according to the
Daily Trojan) designed to "promote the use of
bicycles as a means of transportation."
The Managing Editor of the Daily Trojan
is in charge of the "bike week" program.
Among the things he and his committee are
doing die: (1) organizing a "parade" of bicycles
led by the Daily Trojan "peppermint-striped"
bicycle; (2) aiding in marking out a safe route
for bicycles en route to Troy; and (3) promot
ing the success of the campaign with an eye
to a promise from the Bicycle Institute of Amer
ica to use the campus as a source of national
publicity!
Apparently, the weather isn't as nice in Texas
as it could be. The Battalion at Texas A&M re
ported unhappily that unless the weather
changed, the annual float parade was going to
do just that. Float. Further, the Daily Texan
at the University of Texas came out with a long
article about ju3t what to do if a tornado hit.

The paper described what a tornado looks -
like and what it can do-—such as blowing;
straws through tires and skinning cats. The
paper pointed out that most deaths in tornadoes
are caused by head injuries and their final ad- j
vice to tornado-imperiled students, was "HIDE!"
Professor Snarf and his frustrated student,
Worthal have moved to a new college. Dick
Bibler, the creator of the Little Man on Campus I
Series, has been added to the staff on Humboldt '
State College at Areata, California.
The school paper, the Lumberjack, an- j
nounced that Bibler will teach courses in paint
ing and commercial art. The cartoonist received ;
the M.A. degree, here, a few years ago.
Service with a smile was provided a desper
ate student by the Daily Texan, recently. The
frantic pupil was in search of a math tutor for
a quiz which was about to take place and called
in late to place a want ad. Kindly staffers
obliged with a small article headlined "Hys- % ;
terical Hall (the student's last name) Needs i

ported unhappily that unless the weather
changed, the annual float parade was going to
do just that. Float. Further, the Daily Texan
at the University of Texas came out with a long
article about ju3t what to do if a tornado hit.

The paper described what a tornado looks -
like and what it can do-—such as blowing;
straws through tires and skinning cats. The
paper pointed out that most deaths in tornadoes
are caused by head injuries and their final ad- j
vice to tornado-imperiled students, was "HIDE!"
Professor Snarf and his frustrated student,
Worthal have moved to a new college. Dick
Bibler, the creator of the Little Man on Campus I
Series, has been added to the staff on Humboldt '
State College at Areata, California.
The school paper, the Lumberjack, an- j
nounced that Bibler will teach courses in paint
ing and commercial art. The cartoonist received ;
the M.A. degree, here, a few years ago.
Service with a smile was provided a desper
ate student by the Daily Texan, recently. The
frantic pupil was in search of a math tutor for
a quiz which was about to take place and called
in late to place a want ad. Kindly staffers
obliged with a small article headlined "Hys- % ;
terical Hall (the student's last name) Needs i
Tutor!"
