A. friend and reader, to whom I am devoted
as I am to all readers (it's hard to come by a
iriend who will admit he follows this corner),
had a harrowing experience on the way back
to school from his home in Kansas City.
lie left Kansas City on rey day (the late reg
fj/io being incidental to the pleasures afforded
Ly the extra day spent welcoming the Athletics
to K.C.), and winged westward on a TWA Con
stellation. A few airborne hours after his de
parture he was flying over the radioactive state
of Nevada. It was night and many of his fellow
passengers were asleep. Others were sitting
quietly, meditating in the dark, and some had
their small, pinpoint lights switched on and
were reading magazines.
My Kansas City friend was sitting in the dark,
replaying a round of golf mentally.
Sud ly the whole sky was lit up like high
iiO , d the? Constellation was rocked and
buffeted by the force of the distant explosion,
it was at this point in an otherwise serene

evening that the atomic energy gentlemen
chose to disturb the peace of nocturnal Nevada, j
The possibilities were immediately apparent to i
my friend.
Fitch v. U.S. Yes, your honor, I was thrown |
from rriy seat and suffered a sprained finger.
It upset my whole academic career. Can't take
notes with a sprained finger. Collect thousands
in damages. And that isn't all.
As one of the first of the atomic cases, fitch i
v. U.S. would be doubtlessly guoted in a great
many texts. Ten years hence, students study- j
ing American Government in Poli Sci 1 or 2
would be reading in Burns and Peltason about !
the Stanford student who was deprived of his |
education by haphazard igniting of atom bombs.
Immortality.
Well, sir, there is only one unfortunate con
sideration in this matter. My associate didn't
sprain his finger. And I doubt that the Supreme
Cobrt would enteriain a case against the gov
ernment on the grounds of mental cruelty.
