# 'THE COUNTRY GIRL'
## 'Gimmick-lees' Show Wins Acting Laurels 
### DICK MEISTER 
The American movie screen has been refreshed with a real
story. One with no wide-screen, no magic color, one that isn't a
million-dollar spectacle. This product has merely a good story
backed up by fine acting, all that is necessary for a real production.
At last Hollywood has seen the light so amply provided by the
foreign screens on this point. â™¦

This "gimmick-less" movie is, of
course, "The Country Girl," which
features the outstanding acting of
Grace Kelly and Bing Crosby.
Miss Kelly again proved herself
to be what is so rare in the movie
world - an actress. Here is a |x-r
-former who did not merely follow
the director's instructions scene by
scene, but put herself into the role
all the way, and what results is an
Oscar - winning performance. And
for a change, the moguls down I lol
ly wood way agreed.
OBVIOUS OSCAR
The Oscar Miss Kelly received for
"The Country Girl" was the most
obvious thing that could have been
done, and there is no question as to
her absolute mastery of the role in
the picture which demanded so
much.
Crosby, the old easy-going Bing,
put in the acting job of his life, and
one of the best jobs any actor has
put in for quite some time. Always
before in his roles, he has merely
played himself, the happy-go-lucky
hero. In "The Country Girl" he
met his test and proved that he
could turn in a dramatic perform
ance. The old groaner's voice is
getting Hat as the years roll by, but
as the vocal cords fade away, it
seems his acting is improving."
Not only was the movie different
from the day-to-day Hollywood
product because ol its lack of "gim
micks," but also because of its story
angle. In general, it centered around
the old "hero-gets-girl-at-end-af
ter-hard-struggle," but it made the
.spectator feel that, for a change, he
wanted things exactly that way.
Comes the end of the usual movie
based on this therne, and the aver
age movie-goer heads for the near
est foreign movie palace to son a
real story.
HOLOI.N ROLE
The roles of the unkempt wife and
the drunken ex-actor, played by
Miss Kelly and Crosby, receive ex
cellent support from William Hol
den who plays the third lead. llol
den played the role of the director
who gives the alcoholic actor his
chance, and he put in another of his
top acting jobs.
All that was needed to put the
movie across was the acting, which
would equal the Clifford Odets stage
play in quality.
