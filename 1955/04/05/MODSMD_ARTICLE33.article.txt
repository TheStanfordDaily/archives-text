Positions available (or qualified me
chanical engineers: The radiation lab
oratory at Berkeley and l.ivermore em
ploys over 100 mechanical engineers
engaged in the design of a wide range
of equipment for use in fundamental a.id
applied scientific investigation. This
work includes nuclear and thermo
nuclear test devices and instrumenta
tion, high energy particle aoceleiatois,
ultra high speed cameras, large scale
high vacuum equipment, devices lor ic
moie control in high radiation fields,
equipment for remote handling and
processing of radioactive materials, and
accessory equipment for nuclear reac
tors. Organization is on a project basis
with close contact between engineers
and scientists and the extensive labora
tory shops. Emphasis is not on design
ing for production manufacture. The
work tails for an understanding ol
principles anil ingenuity rathei than the
.application of standard practices. The
projects ol the laboratory include prai
tically all aspects of nuclear engineer
ing.
Inquiries should be made rn Mr.
James Johnson, Stanford Placement Bu
reau, or to the Professional Personnel
Office, University of California Radia
tion I.aboratury, Berkeley 4, California.
