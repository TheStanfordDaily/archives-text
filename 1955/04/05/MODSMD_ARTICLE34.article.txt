FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE
Tho first, thought that comes into our minds upon entering
college is, of course, marriage. Hut how many of lis go about
seeking mates, as 1 like to call them, in a truly scientific manner?
Not many, you may be sure. Most of us simply marry the first
person who comes along. This can lead to unpleasant conse
quences, especially if the person we marry is already married.
Let us today make a scientific survey of the three principle
causes of marriage— homogamy, personality need, and propin
quity. We will examine these one at a time.
Homogamy means the attraction of like for like. In marriage
it is rarely opposites which attract; the great majority of people
choose mates who resemble themselves in taste, personality,
outlook, and, perhaps most important of all, cultural level.
Take, for example, the case of two students of ;i few years
ago named Ansclm Glottis and Florence Catapult. Anselm fell
madly in love with Florence, but she rejected him because she
was majoring in the Don .luanian Poets and he was in the lowly
school of forestry. After graduation Anselm got a job as a
forest ranger. Still determined to win Florence, he read every
single Don Juanian Poet cover to cover while sitting in his
lookout tower.
His plan, alas, miscarried. Florence, sent on a world cruise
as a graduation present, picked up the betel nut habit in tho
Indies. Today, a derelict, she keeps body and soul together by
working as a sampan off Mozambique. And Anselm, engrossed
in the Don Juanian Poets, failed to notice a forest lire which
destroyed 29,000,000 acres of second growth blue spruce. Today,
a derelict, he teaches Merrick and Lovelace at th({ Connecticut
School of Mines.
The second reason why people marry, personality need, means
that you often choose a mate because he or- she possesses certain
qualities that complete and fulfill your own personality. Take,
for instance, the case of Alanson Duck. As a freshman, Alanson
made a fine scholastic record, played varsity lacrosse, and was
very popular with his fellow students. Yet Alanson was not
happy. There was something lacking in his life, something vague
and indefinable that was needed to make his personality complete.
Then one day Alanson discovered what ii was. As he was
walking out of his class in Flemish pottery, a fetching coed
named Grace Ek offered him a handsome brown package and
said, "Philip Morris?"
"Yes!" he cried, for all at once he knew what he bad been
needing to round out his personality— the gentle fulfillment of
Philip Morris Cigarettes, the soul-repairing mildness of their
vintage tobaccos, the balm of their unparalleled taste, tfie ease,
and convenience of their bonny brown Snap-Open pack. "Yes,
J will take a Philip Morris!" cried Alanson. "And I will also
take you to wife if you will have me!''
"La!" she exclaimed, throwing her apron over her face, but
after a while she removed it and they were married. Today they
live in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, where Alanson is with
an otter glazing firm and Grace is a bookie.
Propinquity, the third cause of marriage, means closeness Put
a boy and a girl in a confined space for a long period and 111» *y
will almost surely get married. A perfect example is the case of
Fafnir Sigafoos. While a freshman at, Louisiana State, he was
required to crawl through the Rig Inch pipeline as part of his
fraternity initiation. He entered the pipe at flaton Rouge. As
he passed Lafayette? Ind., he was agreeably surprised to he
joined by a comely girl named Mary Alice Isinglass, a Purdue
freshman, who had to crawl through the Big Inch as part of her
sorority initiation. When they emerged from the pipeline at
Burlington, Vermont, they were engaged, and, after a good hot
bath, they were married. Today they live in Klamath Falls, Ore.,
where Fafnir is in the weights and measures department ancl
Mary Alice is in the roofing game. They have three children,
all named Norman. • M.i\ SMllnwn, Ift*>.»
