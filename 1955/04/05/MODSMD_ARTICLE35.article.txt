Twenty-two Oxford-Cambridge ruggers are visiting on the Stanford
eampu.- at pi i sent. They are living at different fraternity houses with the
Stanford ru;,by players. This represents a phase which is totally lacking
in most American collegiate sports. The USC footballers don't spend the

right before the game getting to
now Taylor's boys. The only con
tact is on the field, where they are
trying to beat each other's brains
out.
Because of the two days of living
together, the rugby game between
the British and the Stanl'ords will
' e much clowr to the real spirit of
vnteicollegiate athletics. Winning
becomes a secondary goal when you
participate in a spirit of companion
ship. Everybody will be doing his
Ik".i but if the other fellow does bet
ter, nobody minds.
Although the British ruggers will
'■ ndoubtedly overwhelm the In
dians, it will still be an excellent
show of how rugby should be
played, and perhaps the prime ex
ample- of what true athletic com
petition should be.
A plan where Stanford footballers
ai rived in Los Angeles on Thurs
ay and sequestered themselves with

(JSC players until Saturday would be obviously impractical, but some op
portunity for companionship both before and after the game would bring
re. nits which could he very beneficial.

The Stanford haseballers had a complete change of form last weekend.
Tli y suddenly turned tigers .it the plate, and the pitchers began to look
the way they should. In the last four games Stanford has scored 5G runs
hit 51 hit Walt Payne's iron-man stint of pitching and winning both ends
of a doubl eheadcr is an example of the spirit on the squad. Payne's work
:.i:nd.s one back to the 1900\s and "Iron Man" Joe McGinnity of the Giants,
v/lio it ed to pull the stunt three or four times a season.

John Stewart, who returned to lorin last Saturday as he cleared (1-5
in th" hi;'!' jump, provided some of the best entertainment of the day as
i '.-age, iin a bit of horseplay after the "official" high jumping was over.
Alter he cleared G-5, the bar was moved up to G-7. John's first jump at
this height aw him miss by only a quarter of an inch, and he also knocked
down the bar on the other two. This finished Stewart officially, but it
seems that the photographers missed snapping him clearing the bar. Al
ways n ady io oblige, the handsome end unobtrusively lowered the bar
io (>-0. and then -ailed over with five inches to spare. The crowd set up
a tremendoie ova!ion, thinking that John had cleared G-7. Stewart arose
'rom the :awdvir:t with a sheepish look on his face, and hanging his head
ii» moved the indicator down to (»-0 and hid himself behind the standard.
H< had the spectators convinced, now, if only those officials . . .
