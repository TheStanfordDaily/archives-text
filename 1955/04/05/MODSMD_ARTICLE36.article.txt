### MIKE McGINNIS 
Stanford's Rugby fifteen suf
fered a stiff setback in Cal's Me
morial Stadium last Saturday
when they bowed to the Bear's
25-6.
Stanford played a better game, ac
cording to Stanford coach, Pete
Kmetovie, than the score would in
dicate. The Indian's big headache
was the Bear's great kicker, Noel
Bowden, who scored 19 points all by
himself. He booted two penalty kicks
at distances of 50 and 55 yards. His
great punting kept the Cards in
trouble all the time.
Bowden opened the scoring early
in the first half, when he booted a
25-yard penalty kick.
Alter 25 minutes had passed in the
first period he had added two more
kicks on penalties, and Cal had a 9-0
lead.

25-yard penalty kick through the
posts.

points when the Card's Jack Lewis
