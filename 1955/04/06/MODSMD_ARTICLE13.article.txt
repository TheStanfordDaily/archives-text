## Gable Discusses New Constitution 
### 
Student Manager Bob Gable spoke
briefly at an Interfraternity Council
meeting last night about the pro
posed ASSU constitution. He dis
tributed copies of both new and old
constitutions to the house presidents
asking them to post the copies in
their houses for the benefit of all
fraternity men.
Under the new set-up. Gable em
phasized, the IFC will have repre
sentation on both the president's
cabinet and in the legislature. In
addition, IFC will be an inferior
body in the overall judicial council,
and its judicial by-laws will be able
to be changed by the legislature.
