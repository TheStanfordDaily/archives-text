E:-:jom finally finished up its draft of a new
constitution for the Associated Students Satur
day morning and one Excom member, plan
ning to attend another meeting tonight, asked
ASSU President Pete Bing if, in honor of the
event, Excom might not be put off until 8:30
p.m. No luck—Excom will find that passing on
a constitution leads to as much work as start
ing to consider one . . . almost as much, at
least ! rey'll meet tonight at 7:30 as usual, and
on trie agenda are three items of constitution
business.
The proposed constitution will go to the stu
dent body in a referendum vote two weeks
from yesterday and today, and tonight Excorn
will consider the mechanics of that election:
polling times and places, ballot form, and other
procedural items.
Also in preparation for the referendum, Ex
com plans to review its first two days of work
explaining draft constitution to living group
and class meetings. Most of the open discus
sions on the document will be finished next
Monday.

Third item of consideration on matters con
stitutional will be the question of by-laws for
the proposed constitution. Theoretically such
by-laws will be drawn up by the Legislature
under the proposed constitution, and if the pro
posed constitution passes two weeks from now

the present Excom will automatically become
the Legislature of ASSU. At that time it would
have to set about writing by-laws immediately
to get the new setup working. Excom's ques
tion tonight: shall we begin by-law discussion
now and trust that the constitution will pass?
There seems to be no reason right now why the
proposed constitution will not pass easily at
referendum, but if it were to fail, Excom could
n't do much but throw out all the work it had
done on the by-laws. So, time-element or none,
it might be best to wait for an official go-ahead
from the student body before working over the
by-laws.

An important item on the agenda tonight will
be consideration of plans for the visit of 11
Russian editors early next month to the Stan
ford campus. Excom will be meeting the edi-,
tors in some sort of meeting and helping to j
guide them on campus, and definite plans and |
schedules have been required by those plan
ning the tour for the Russians.

The newly clarified Honor Code took effect
as recently adjusted as of the first day of this
quarter, and Ann Irvine's Honor Code Sub
committee must push plans for an education
program on the clariiication. Miss Irvine will
give another progress report tonight in Excom. :
The meeting, open to all, will be held in the
Excorn room, Student Union.
