How Not to Stop Smoking
(The author, alter having read many articles
on why lo stop smoking, has decided either to
. . . as the cliche goes ... (1) stop reading, or
(2),dÂ° something about it. Since the first course
is impractical until graduation, he has chosen
the second . . . course . . . of . . . action.)
It has been said that the predisposition to
cancer might correlate highly with the predis
position to smoking. This is an interesting
statement (or fact, depending on your bias)
since it indicates something or other. Now this
something or other is also highly interesting
. . . or may be considered so ... or might not.
We smoke (those among us who do) be
cause (and I rim not referring to those who
don't) we (smoke) smoking. We might
not enjoy smoking aad smoke anyway ... if
we're nuts. Then, there are people who say
we are nuts if we smoke whether we enjoy
it or not. Then there are other people . . . some.

Now .to the crux of this discourse .. . how
to stop not smoking. Pick a day when you are
feeling particularly well. Decide in your mind
once and for all ... set your iron will . . . and j
just don't stop. It's easy ... if you follow di
rections.
Any difficulties incurred may be easily dis-1
posed of. Simply tell yourself you'd rather
continue. Tell yourself how expensive it would
be to give up . . . yes, I said expensive. Re
member, you'll have to take a tobacco substi- :
tute for several months after stopping and ;
candy bars cost money ... or did yesterday.
Also, remember this . . . everyone who sjops
gains weight . . . rapidly . . . very fast. Added
weight is bad for you . . . and your heart . . .
and liver . . . and other things.
Just think . . . stop smoking and you don't j
die from cancer (maybe) but you get fat and j
die of heart disease. It's morbid ... so why !
not enjoy (at least) killing yourself?
