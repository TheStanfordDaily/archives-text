# Health Service Dates to 1890's

j (This is the first of a series of articles about the Health ServiceJ
Women on one side of the campus and men on the other. Two
separate offices with identical facilities. Discrimination perhaps,
but this at one time described the Stanford Health Service.
The Health Service traces its origin to the 1890's and ihe physi
cal education classes in the early days of the University. Medical

coverage, treatment, and facilities
were limited until a typhoid fever
epidemic in the winter of 1902 and
IDOU brought to light the need for
more adequate medical services.
Subsequently the isolation hospi
tal was built. To add further to
campus health the Board of Trustees
instituted the requirement of a
smallpox vaccination within the
previous two years for all entering
Stanford students.
These two events mark the real
beginning of the Health Service, al
though in form it wks quite different
from the one in the east wing of
the Women's Gymnasium that is
known today. Two health services
(one for men and one for women)
with no contact between them ex
isted. •
Despite an expansion, medical
service during the 1920\s and '30's
was limited. Treatment was re
stricted to what could be done in
the office.
Campus doctors were not permit
-1 ted to belong to the hospital staff.
Nor could they see students in their
dormitories or homes. This prohibi
tion led to delay in calling a doctor,
j a situation which increased these-
J riousness and duration of the illness.
I Clinical services were combined
j with public health and health in-
I struction.
DISLOCATION
During World War II with the in
j flux of the military, all of the cam
pus medical facilities were dislo
cated. After the war, Stanford Pres
ident Donald B. Tresidder, wishing
! to minimize delay, to avoid financial
I hardship for the students, and to in-
J stitute broader, more liberal health
! coverage stressing preventive medi
j cine as well as diagnosis and treat
| ment by well-qualified physicians,
1 arranged a contract between the
University and the Palo Alto Clinic.
This contract, based upon the
i principles of group practice and
j pre - payment, makes available to
I Stanford students the facilities and

personnel of the Palo Aito Clinic.
The Health Service has now oper
| ated for nine years without any
J fundamental change in its adminis
tration.
The major objective of the Health
Service is to have the largest pos
i sible number of students fully par
ticipating in all phases of student
! life.
CLINICAL VIEW
The attitude of the Health Serv
ice is predominantly clinical. It does
not have the responsibility for the
| public health of the campus; this is
i the work of the University Health
Officer and his staff. It does not
j have responsibility for health edu
! cation.
The director of the Health Service
1 bears dual responsibility as a mem
ber of the University administra
tion, a member of the faculty, and a
! member of the partnership of the
Palo Alto Clinic. The medical and
; clerical staff of, the Health Service
are all either partners or employees
j of the Clinic.
Normally there are five physi
cians and from five to eight nurses
at the Health Service. Dr. George
I H. Houck, director of the Health
j Service, has served in that capacity
since its reorganization in 194G.
All of the facilities of the Palo
i Alto Clinic are available to Stan-
I ford students.

j (This is the first of a series of articles about the Health ServiceJ
Women on one side of the campus and men on the other. Two
separate offices with identical facilities. Discrimination perhaps,
but this at one time described the Stanford Health Service.
The Health Service traces its origin to the 1890's and ihe physi
cal education classes in the early days of the University. Medical

coverage, treatment, and facilities
were limited until a typhoid fever
epidemic in the winter of 1902 and
IDOU brought to light the need for
more adequate medical services.
Subsequently the isolation hospi
tal was built. To add further to
campus health the Board of Trustees
instituted the requirement of a
smallpox vaccination within the
previous two years for all entering
Stanford students.
These two events mark the real
beginning of the Health Service, al
though in form it wks quite different
from the one in the east wing of
the Women's Gymnasium that is
known today. Two health services
(one for men and one for women)
with no contact between them ex
isted. •
Despite an expansion, medical
service during the 1920\s and '30's
was limited. Treatment was re
stricted to what could be done in
the office.
Campus doctors were not permit
-1 ted to belong to the hospital staff.
Nor could they see students in their
dormitories or homes. This prohibi
tion led to delay in calling a doctor,
j a situation which increased these-
J riousness and duration of the illness.
I Clinical services were combined
j with public health and health in-
I struction.
DISLOCATION
During World War II with the in
j flux of the military, all of the cam
pus medical facilities were dislo
cated. After the war, Stanford Pres
ident Donald B. Tresidder, wishing
! to minimize delay, to avoid financial
I hardship for the students, and to in-
J stitute broader, more liberal health
! coverage stressing preventive medi
j cine as well as diagnosis and treat
| ment by well-qualified physicians,
1 arranged a contract between the
University and the Palo Alto Clinic.
This contract, based upon the
i principles of group practice and
j pre - payment, makes available to
I Stanford students the facilities and

personnel of the Palo Aito Clinic.
The Health Service has now oper
| ated for nine years without any
J fundamental change in its adminis
tration.
The major objective of the Health
Service is to have the largest pos
i sible number of students fully par
ticipating in all phases of student
! life.
CLINICAL VIEW
The attitude of the Health Serv
ice is predominantly clinical. It does
not have the responsibility for the
| public health of the campus; this is
i the work of the University Health
Officer and his staff. It does not
j have responsibility for health edu
! cation.
The director of the Health Service
1 bears dual responsibility as a mem
ber of the University administra
tion, a member of the faculty, and a
! member of the partnership of the
Palo Alto Clinic. The medical and
; clerical staff of, the Health Service
are all either partners or employees
j of the Clinic.
Normally there are five physi
cians and from five to eight nurses
at the Health Service. Dr. George
