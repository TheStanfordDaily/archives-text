# Stanford Rugby Squad Battles Oxford-Cambridge in Stadium
## 
### MIKE McGINNIS 
This afternoon the combined Oxford-Cambridge Rugby Tour
ing Team will tussle with the Indian Ruggers at 3:30 in the Stan
ford Stadium.
The conflict will be the first of four scheduled games the Brit
ishers will play in the Bay Area.
The contest will be played according to the rules of the Inter-

national Union, Stanford's coach,
Pete Kmetovic, said. Each side will
dress 15 men and then sit back'and
watch them pluy. There will be no
substitutions. If a man is injured
and cannot continue playing, he will
be removed permanently, and the
team will play with 14 players. The
informal California Rugby Union,
which Stanford is a member of, has
been using substitutions this season.
HOSTED BY OPPONENTS
The touring ruggers have been liv
ing on campus in 12 of Stanford's
fraternities, as guests of members of
the Stanford Rugby team.
On Monday night the Institute of
International Relations held a re
ception for them in Bowman Alumni
House, which many interested stu
dents attended. Since then they have
been kept busy attending dinners
and luncheons, both on campus and
off, and have spent their idle time
sightseeing.
The squad has played approxi
mately 95 games so far on their trip,
and for this reason they need no
heavy workouts before a game. They
did engage in a light exercise pe
riod Monday morning, however,
which consisted mainly of calisthen
ics.
The twenty-two man traveling
squad is captained by I. D. S. "Skip"
Beer. Beer has played for Cam
bridge against Oxford in 1951, 1952,
and 1953. The 23-year-old rugger
stands 6-1 Vj, weighs 203 lbs., and is
studying to be a schoolmaster.
COMPARED TO FOOTBALL
When quizzed on British Rugby
Beer said that the game is the major
sport in British colleges from Sep
tember to April. From April to June,
soccer is the main sport, however,
and in summer the most popular
game is cricket. Although soccer is
the national game of England, Rug
by is as important, when in season,
in the colleges as football is over
, »
here.
Dennis Robinson, a 24-year-old
fullback from Capetown University,
South Africa, and O'xl'ord, showed
an interest in American football and
basketball. He couldn't understand
why, in basketball, the opposing
players couldn't knock the ball out

♦ -
|of the dribbler's hand. The ait of
dribbling the ball was a mystery to
him. There is no sport in England
that employs such a technique. Rob
inson thought that down field block
ing, when football was explained to
him, was a very good feature.
MOKE CHOICE INVOLVED
Robinson had a hard time grasp
ing the concept of planned plays used
in so many American sports, and so
few English ones. The British Rugby
player doesn't rim to a certain spot
to throw a preplanned block, or catch
a pass; he has more choice. ■ The
sport is not run by the coach, but
rather by the team.
Most of the team have seen no
major American sports. Robinson
mentioned that he had seen a high
school football game played at Van
couver, just before the squad had
enplaned for San .Francisco. The
boys hope to see some baseball when
they reach Los Angeles in the next
few weeks.
While in Vancouver, the team won
five of their games and lost one. That
loss, to the British Columbia Ail-
Stars, they attribute to a party they
had the night before.
ATTRACTIVE FARM WOMEN
Stephen Coles, who plays scrum
half and wing, .mentioned that he !
thought Stanford women were very I
attractive. Time to move, girls!
The lineups for today's game are
as follows:
Oxford-Cambridge will field Beer,
lock; Evans, second row; Kinin
month, second row; Plambridge,
front row; Watson, front row; Mc-
Ewen, hooker; Herbert, breakaway; j

school football game played at Van
couver, just before the squad had
enplaned for San .Francisco. The
boys hope to see some baseball when
they reach Los Angeles in the next
few weeks.
While in Vancouver, the team won
five of their games and lost one. That
loss, to the British Columbia Ail-
Stars, they attribute to a party they
had the night before.
ATTRACTIVE FARM WOMEN

HOSTED BY OPPONENTS
The touring ruggers have been liv
ing on campus in 12 of Stanford's
fraternities, as guests of members of
the Stanford Rugby team.
On Monday night the Institute of
International Relations held a re
ception for them in Bowman Alumni
House, which many interested stu
dents attended. Since then they have
been kept busy attending dinners
and luncheons, both on campus and
off, and have spent their idle time
sightseeing.
The squad has played approxi
mately 95 games so far on their trip,
and for this reason they need no
heavy workouts before a game. They
did engage in a light exercise pe
riod Monday morning, however,
which consisted mainly of calisthen
ics.
The twenty-two man traveling
squad is captained by I. D. S. "Skip"
Beer. Beer has played for Cam
bridge against Oxford in 1951, 1952,
and 1953. The 23-year-old rugger
stands 6-1 Vj, weighs 203 lbs., and is
studying to be a schoolmaster.
COMPARED TO FOOTBALL
When quizzed on British Rugby
Beer said that the game is the major
sport in British colleges from Sep
tember to April. From April to June,
soccer is the main sport, however,
and in summer the most popular
game is cricket. Although soccer is
the national game of England, Rug
by is as important, when in season,
in the colleges as football is over

here.
Dennis Robinson, a 24-year-old
fullback from Capetown University,
South Africa, and O'xl'ord, showed
an interest in American football and
basketball. He couldn't understand
why, in basketball, the opposing
players couldn't knock the ball out

|of the dribbler's hand. The ait of
dribbling the ball was a mystery to
him. There is no sport in England
that employs such a technique. Rob
inson thought that down field block
ing, when football was explained to
him, was a very good feature.
MOKE CHOICE INVOLVED
Robinson had a hard time grasp
ing the concept of planned plays used
in so many American sports, and so
few English ones. The British Rugby
player doesn't rim to a certain spot
to throw a preplanned block, or catch
a pass; he has more choice. ■ The
sport is not run by the coach, but
rather by the team.

Beer said that the game is the major
sport in British colleges from Sep
tember to April. From April to June,
soccer is the main sport, however,
and in summer the most popular
game is cricket. Although soccer is
the national game of England, Rug
by is as important, when in season,
in the colleges as football is over

Dennis Robinson, a 24-year-old
fullback from Capetown University,
South Africa, and O'xl'ord, showed
an interest in American football and
basketball. He couldn't understand
why, in basketball, the opposing
players couldn't knock the ball out

|of the dribbler's hand. The ait of
dribbling the ball was a mystery to
him. There is no sport in England
that employs such a technique. Rob
inson thought that down field block
ing, when football was explained to
him, was a very good feature.
MOKE CHOICE INVOLVED
Robinson had a hard time grasp
ing the concept of planned plays used
in so many American sports, and so
few English ones. The British Rugby
player doesn't rim to a certain spot
to throw a preplanned block, or catch
a pass; he has more choice. ■ The
sport is not run by the coach, but
rather by the team.
Most of the team have seen no
major American sports. Robinson
mentioned that he had seen a high
school football game played at Van
couver, just before the squad had
enplaned for San .Francisco. The
boys hope to see some baseball when
they reach Los Angeles in the next
few weeks.
While in Vancouver, the team won
five of their games and lost one. That
loss, to the British Columbia Ail-
Stars, they attribute to a party they
had the night before.
ATTRACTIVE FARM WOMEN
Stephen Coles, who plays scrum
half and wing, .mentioned that he !

This afternoon the combined Oxford-Cambridge Rugby Tour
ing Team will tussle with the Indian Ruggers at 3:30 in the Stan
ford Stadium.
The conflict will be the first of four scheduled games the Brit
ishers will play in the Bay Area.
The contest will be played according to the rules of the Inter-

national Union, Stanford's coach,
Pete Kmetovic, said. Each side will
dress 15 men and then sit back'and
watch them pluy. There will be no
substitutions. If a man is injured
and cannot continue playing, he will
be removed permanently, and the
team will play with 14 players. The
informal California Rugby Union,
which Stanford is a member of, has
been using substitutions this season.
HOSTED BY OPPONENTS
The touring ruggers have been liv
ing on campus in 12 of Stanford's
fraternities, as guests of members of
the Stanford Rugby team.
On Monday night the Institute of
International Relations held a re
ception for them in Bowman Alumni
House, which many interested stu
dents attended. Since then they have
been kept busy attending dinners
and luncheons, both on campus and
off, and have spent their idle time
sightseeing.
The squad has played approxi
mately 95 games so far on their trip,
and for this reason they need no
heavy workouts before a game. They
did engage in a light exercise pe
riod Monday morning, however,
which consisted mainly of calisthen
ics.
The twenty-two man traveling
squad is captained by I. D. S. "Skip"
Beer. Beer has played for Cam
bridge against Oxford in 1951, 1952,
and 1953. The 23-year-old rugger
stands 6-1 Vj, weighs 203 lbs., and is
studying to be a schoolmaster.
