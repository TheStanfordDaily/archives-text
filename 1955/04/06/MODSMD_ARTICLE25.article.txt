# Visiting Ruggers Explain English Game
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
Rugby in England's two major j
colleges, Oxford and Cambridge, oc- '
cupies a much bigger position than j
it does here. There, rugby season !
runs from September to April, cli- j
maxing with a seven-man tourna- j
ment, where many teams gather to
play.
Lan Beer, playing captain of the I
Oxford-Cambridge team which plays
Stanford today, explained that there
are two types of rugby played in
the world today; the most popular
is the type played here at Stanford,
the other is rugby union, which is
professional rugby. Mr. Beer was
last year's Cambridge captain, and
has played all over the world on
tours similar to this one. When j
asked if he planned to play rugby J
union, which pays ten pounds to |
players on the winning team, and 1

five to the losers, he said sharply, |
"Only one Oxford or Cambridge j
player has ever gone into rugby un
ion!"
BLUE' WINNERS
Any player who plays in the Big j
Game (Oxford vs. Cambridge) gets
his "blue." All of the men on this ;
tour have their blues. Last year's
Oxford captain was invited, but was
unable to make the*trip.
The team of "blues" has wop five
while losing one so far on this tour, i
They lost to British Columbia after, :
as Bob MacEwen put it, "they gave j
us a party on the penultimate night |
of the match which lasted until two,
and we didn't get to bed until six." 1
After the game today they move
to Berkeley for two games and then j
travel to Los Angeles. Then they (
head back for New York and on to •

England.
MacEwen pointed out that the
team was trying to stress a wide
open passing type of play, which
would demonstrate best what the
game is like when it is well played.

has played all over the world on
tours similar to this one. When j
asked if he planned to play rugby J
union, which pays ten pounds to |
players on the winning team, and 1

five to the losers, he said sharply, |
"Only one Oxford or Cambridge j
player has ever gone into rugby un
ion!"
BLUE' WINNERS
Any player who plays in the Big j
Game (Oxford vs. Cambridge) gets
his "blue." All of the men on this ;
tour have their blues. Last year's
Oxford captain was invited, but was
unable to make the*trip.
The team of "blues" has wop five
while losing one so far on this tour, i
They lost to British Columbia after, :
as Bob MacEwen put it, "they gave j
us a party on the penultimate night |
of the match which lasted until two,
and we didn't get to bed until six." 1
After the game today they move
to Berkeley for two games and then j
travel to Los Angeles. Then they (
head back for New York and on to •

England.
MacEwen pointed out that the
team was trying to stress a wide
open passing type of play, which
would demonstrate best what the
game is like when it is well played.
