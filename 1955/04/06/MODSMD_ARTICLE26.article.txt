# PAL Stars Face Frosh
## 
### DICK NICHOLS 
Stanford's frosh track team, fresh
from a convincing 33-point victory
in its four-way meet last Saturday,
takes on a collection of Peninsula
Athletic League all-stars today at
3:30 p.m. at Angell Field.
The freshmen, after taking 10 out
of 13 firsts, seem to be very power
ful this year, as Sacramento JC was
supposed to have been a powerhouse
in the JC league.
The PAL all-stars, however, have
several performers wlio.se times lead
all high-school marks in the Bay
Area. The high-schoolers will be
coached by Forrest Jameson, who
coaches the Palo Alto High team.
The frosh appear to be strongest
in the hurdles, weight events, 880,
and mile. There will be no two
mile, as the high schools do not in
clude this event in their meets. The
all-stars expect to pick up points in
the pole vault, in which two of the
high-schoolers, Unland and Matejka
of Burlingame, have cleared 13-2.
The all-stars hope to take the mile
honors away from Maury Graves,
who finished in 4:29.4 last Saturday,
through the work of Jim Hector of
Jefferson High in Daly City, who
has circled the course in 4:30.8. The
880 should also be close, as Ron Lar
rieu of Burlingame, with a 1:59.8,
will challenge Don Richardson of
the frosh. who has a 1:59.6 to his
credit.
The freshmen swept the shot on
Saturday, with Ray Williamson
heaving the iron 47-11 !/|. Jim Hart
hurled the discus 142-lQ 1 for the
freshmen, while Leon Kreuger leads
the all-stars with a toss of 137 feet.
Roger Peterson of Burlingame
leads the high-schoolers in the 440
with a 50.8 effort.
