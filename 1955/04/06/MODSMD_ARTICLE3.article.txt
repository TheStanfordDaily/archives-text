# Churchill Gives Up Reins
## Resignation Is Accepted 
### United Press 
Prime Minister Winston
Churchill, who is 80. presented
his resignation to Queen Eliza
beth II in a 42-minute audience
at Buckingham Palace late yes
terday afternoon. The public an
nouncement which made his
resignation known read:
"The Right Honorable Sir Winston
Churchill had an audience of the
Queen this evening and tendered his
resignation as Prime Minister and
First Lord of the Treasury, which
Her Majesty has graciously prepared
to accept."
After his resignation, Churchill
returned to No. 10 Downing Street
and stood, old and mute, with tears
brimming in his eyes as he received
the cheers of a throng which pressed
about him to bid him farewell.
He stepped from his car into
Downing Street and waved his cigar
awkwardly to the cheering thou
sands.
Slowly his right hand came up and
his face glowed with the faith of the
war years as his fingers formed his
famed "V" for victory sign.
His eyes were very wet.
Churchill is expected to fight again
for re-election to his Parliamentary
seat in the forthcoming elections. It
was above all his determination to
remain in Commons that led him to
decline the offer of a peerage.
He will be succeeded today by
Foreign Minister Anthony Eden, his
personal choice as heir to his pow
ers.
Eden is expected to make few ma
jor changes in the Churchill gov
ernment at least until after an elec
tion which he is expected to call in
May or June to seek a new mandate
for himself and the Conservative
party.
Durable as he was audacious,
Churchill outlived the leaders he
fought beside and against. He was
15 years older than Hitler, whom he
labeled a "bloodthirsty guttersnipe."
He was nine years the senior of

i Benito Mussolini, that "bloated bull
frog of the Pontine marshes . . . that
! whipped jackal."
He was four years older than Jo
sef Stalin, whose Russia he found to
! be "a riddle wrapped in a mystery
j inside an enigma."
He was eight years older than
! Franklin D. Roosevelt, "the greatest
I American friend we have ever
j known."
Older than all, yet he served into
his ninth decade as the forty-first
I Prime Minister to govern this an
j cient kingdom in the last two cen
| turies.
Churchill's dynamic speeches are
! remembered throughout the Eng
| lish-speaking world.
May 13, 1910—three days after he
was appointed Prime Minister—he
said, "'I would say to the House, as
I have said to those who have joined
this government: I have nothing to
offer but blood, toil, tears, and
sweat."
"From Stettin on the Baltic to
Trieste on the Adriatic, an Iron Cur
tain has descended across Europe,"
he said at Fulton, Mo., in March of
1946 — when most Western leaders
still were trying to be nice to the
Russians. The phrase "Iron Cur
tain" was born.
He once stated a code: "Live dan
gerously. Take things as they come.
Dread naught. All will be well."
Churchill acted by his code.

resignation known read:
"The Right Honorable Sir Winston
Churchill had an audience of the
Queen this evening and tendered his
resignation as Prime Minister and
First Lord of the Treasury, which
Her Majesty has graciously prepared
to accept."
After his resignation, Churchill
returned to No. 10 Downing Street
and stood, old and mute, with tears
brimming in his eyes as he received
the cheers of a throng which pressed
about him to bid him farewell.
He stepped from his car into
Downing Street and waved his cigar
awkwardly to the cheering thou
sands.
Slowly his right hand came up and
his face glowed with the faith of the
war years as his fingers formed his
famed "V" for victory sign.
His eyes were very wet.
Churchill is expected to fight again
for re-election to his Parliamentary
seat in the forthcoming elections. It
was above all his determination to
remain in Commons that led him to
decline the offer of a peerage.
He will be succeeded today by
Foreign Minister Anthony Eden, his
personal choice as heir to his pow
ers.
Eden is expected to make few ma
jor changes in the Churchill gov
ernment at least until after an elec
tion which he is expected to call in
May or June to seek a new mandate
for himself and the Conservative
party.
Durable as he was audacious,
Churchill outlived the leaders he
fought beside and against. He was
15 years older than Hitler, whom he
labeled a "bloodthirsty guttersnipe."
He was nine years the senior of

i Benito Mussolini, that "bloated bull
frog of the Pontine marshes . . . that
! whipped jackal."
He was four years older than Jo
sef Stalin, whose Russia he found to
! be "a riddle wrapped in a mystery
j inside an enigma."
He was eight years older than
! Franklin D. Roosevelt, "the greatest
I American friend we have ever
j known."
Older than all, yet he served into
his ninth decade as the forty-first
I Prime Minister to govern this an
j cient kingdom in the last two cen
| turies.
Churchill's dynamic speeches are
! remembered throughout the Eng
| lish-speaking world.
May 13, 1910—three days after he
was appointed Prime Minister—he
said, "'I would say to the House, as
I have said to those who have joined
this government: I have nothing to
offer but blood, toil, tears, and
sweat."
"From Stettin on the Baltic to
Trieste on the Adriatic, an Iron Cur
tain has descended across Europe,"
he said at Fulton, Mo., in March of
1946 — when most Western leaders
still were trying to be nice to the
Russians. The phrase "Iron Cur
tain" was born.
He once stated a code: "Live dan
gerously. Take things as they come.
Dread naught. All will be well."
Churchill acted by his code.
