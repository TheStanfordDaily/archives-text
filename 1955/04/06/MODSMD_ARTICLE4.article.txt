# Professors Fisher, Brand View British Changeover
## 
### RIC TEAGUE 
Eighty-year-old Sir Winston Spencer Churchill drove to Buck
ingham Palace yesterday afternoon and turned over to Queen
Elizabeth II the seals of his office, marking the end of his service
to England as Her Majesty's First Minister.
Previous to that, at a private dinner at No. 10 Downing Street, the

Queen honored the aging diplomat
with an almost unprecedented toast
—one of the few times in British
history that a sovereign so honored
a commoner.
Sir Anthony Eden, Churchill's
Foreign Secretary, took over the
reins of British government and of
the Conservative party from the
man regarded by many as the out
standing figure of the twentieth cen
tury.
Here at Stanford, the retirement
of Britain's wartime hero and peace
time leader was held, generally, as
inevitable. Harold H. Fisher, chair
man of the Hoover Institute and Li
brary and well known as a percep
tive analyst of contemporary politi
cal affairs, felt that Churchill's leav
ing politics was well timed. Fisher
said that '"Eden will probably win"
in the general elections to be held
next month. Eden will have an eas
ier fight than if the elections were
to be held later in the year, Fisher
commented.
Turning to Churchill, Fisher com
mented on "the remarkable number
and the high quality of his many
talents. (He is) one of the great
personalities of the century. He has
made a great many political mis
takes . . . but his place in history
will depend on how the century
comes out."
EDEN A 'DIPLOMATIST'
About Eden as Prime Minister,
Fisher said that Sir Anthony is "a
great diplomatist. He is underesti
mated abroad (from England). Eden
is not spectacular but you don't have
to be spectacular in British politics.
Eden was responsible for saving the
Western European Union and he did
it quietly."
"Eden's strength at home will help
everywhere. He will be less likely
than Churchill to push for a "Big
Four" conference but will attempt
to guide diplomatic relations with
the Soviet bloc through more subtle
policy leadership," said Fisher.

Professor Carl F. Brand of the
History Department, who special
izes in Great Britain, made the point
that he is a historian rather than a
prophet. However, he feels that it
is apparent that "there will be little
change in either British domestic or
foreign policy under Eden. In re
cent years, men other than Churchill
have made many of the decisions.
Eden has been taking into his own
hands the reins of foreign policy.
The decisions at Geneva were his.
SHIFT AT BORDER
"In domestic affairs, R. A. Butler,
who seems more like a professor
than a politician, has led the policy
making. Over recent years the ac
tual business of government has
gradually shifted from Sir Winston
to Eden and Butler.
"Churchill is the greatest living
man ... an accomplished statesman,
soldier, historian, painter, author,
orator, and bricklayer ... a Renais
sance man. His move has been some
time in the making. His health has
been failing and he has been finding
it increasingly difficult to keep the
pace of modern politics.
TIMELY RETIREMENT
"There is some timeliness in his
retirement. Eden has waited a long
time and has been loyal to Church
ill. The present government's term
expires in 1956 and it is too much of
a gamble for a government to wait
to the very end to change its leader.'
Since there is to be a new Prime
Minister, it is thought that the suc
cessor, in this case Eden, should
serve for a time in order to acquaint
the people with him as Prime Min
ister," said Brand.
The general opinion on the cam
pus would seem to be that it is too
bad that a man like Sir Winston
Churchill can't go on forever. Both
Fisher and Brand agree that British
policy will see no great changes,
though, and that Sir Anthony Eden
will prove a capable leader.

Sir Anthony Eden, Churchill's

man regarded by many as the out

Here at Stanford, the retirement
of Britain's wartime hero and peace
time leader was held, generally, as
inevitable. Harold H. Fisher, chair

said that '"Eden will probably win"
in the general elections to be held
next month. Eden will have an eas

to be held later in the year, Fisher
commented.
Turning to Churchill, Fisher com
mented on "the remarkable number
and the high quality of his many
talents. (He is) one of the great
personalities of the century. He has
made a great many political mis
takes . . . but his place in history
will depend on how the century
comes out."
EDEN A 'DIPLOMATIST'
About Eden as Prime Minister,
Fisher said that Sir Anthony is "a
great diplomatist. He is underesti
mated abroad (from England). Eden
is not spectacular but you don't have
to be spectacular in British politics.
Eden was responsible for saving the
Western European Union and he did
it quietly."
"Eden's strength at home will help
everywhere. He will be less likely
than Churchill to push for a "Big
Four" conference but will attempt
to guide diplomatic relations with
the Soviet bloc through more subtle
policy leadership," said Fisher.

Professor Carl F. Brand of the
History Department, who special
izes in Great Britain, made the point
that he is a historian rather than a
prophet. However, he feels that it
is apparent that "there will be little
change in either British domestic or
foreign policy under Eden. In re
cent years, men other than Churchill
have made many of the decisions.
Eden has been taking into his own
hands the reins of foreign policy.
