1 DARK SUIT + 1 NEW ARROW SOFTONE SHIRT
= 1 WELL-DRESSED COUEGE MAN
! With dark suitings the big campus preference, Arrow introduce*
its new Softone shirts with harmonizing ties —soft muted colors
' to blend naturally, easily, with darker fabrics. They give you the
look of a man who wears his clothes well.
See your campus Arrow dealer for these fine colored shirts.
You'll find a wide range of checks, stripes and solids. Best of
all, Arrow Softones are priced right. You can own one (or
several), and still have money left to eat on. They're but
| $5.00 the shirt.
