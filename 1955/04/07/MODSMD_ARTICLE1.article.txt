### MIKE McGINNIS 
Pity!
The Oxford-Cambridge tour
ing ruggers rolled over the In
dians yesterday afternoon, 39-
11, in the Stanford Stadium with
out too much blood, sweat, and
tears expended. The game was
an excellent example of rugby
played by experts and was very
much enjoyed by the crowd.
lit the opening minutes of the con
test. the "Blues" thrilled the crowd
willi their expert ball handling. Ox
ford-Cambridge took the ball on the
first out-of-bounds line-out of the
game and handily lateraled their
way through the Stanford backfield
for a score. The TD was void, how
ever. as the lateral was a forward
pass which is illegal in the game.
LEWIS SAVES CARDS
A few seconds later, the visitors
threatened again, but the Cards'
Jack Lewis saved the Indians with
a lonij kick to the Stanford 40. But
the Oxford-Cambridge boys were j
not to be held back. A good run
carried the ball to the Cards' 10 j
where the ball was lateraled to the j
Britishers' left Wing, Bill Lawrence, '
and he went over for a try. The j
conversion was Rood, and Oxford- j
Cambridge led 5-0 after five min- j
ules.
After a scrum at midfield, with !
10 minutes j*one of the first 45-min
ute period, the Cards' scrum half, i
John Doyle, moved the ball to the
Blues' 25-yard line. Oxford-Cam
bridge incurred a penalty at this
point, and Stanford's Dorsey Atkin
son booted the penalty kick home to
Kivc the Indians their first three
points.
C ARD DEFENSE TIGHTENS
Both teams moved into enemy
territory and failed to score in the
following 15 minutes, as the Cards'
began to tighten up their defense.
There was no stopping the Blues'
Lawrence, though, when he sudden
ly broke into the clear at the end of
one of the Britishers' many cround-
Kaininc; wing-outs. He went 40 yards
to score, weaving through the Card
backs.
Fullback Dennis Robinson con
verted and Oxford-Cambridge led
10-3.
Halfway through the period Stan
ford's Jack Lewis broke loose and
raced yards, but was stopped just
short of the goal. The Cards kept
the pressure on, and two minutes
later Fred Frye dove into the end
zone. Atkinson converted, and the
score was 10-8.
Five minutes later the Blues
shone again. A beautiful passing
rush traveled practically the whole
length of the field and center three
quarters Harry Morgan scored after
deceptively reversing sides of the
green. The conversion by Davies
was good, and the score climbed to
15-8.
In the closing minutes of the first
half, a dribbling rush carried the
Blues to the Stanford 30-yard stripe.
Breakaway A. J. Herbert broke
through at this point and ran over
for a try, after a wing-out had car
ried the ball to the Indians' 15.
Five minutes into the second half,

] Stanford marked the scoreboard
j again. Atkinson applied his toe to |
j the ball and made a 30-yard penalty j
i kick.
But back came the experts to
make the second half a higher scor- j
ing period than the first. Ten min- I
utes into the period, the Cards I
| looked as if they were going to score
i as Jack Taylor broke into the clear
near midfield. He lateraled to Jack
Lewis, who booted a cross - field
kick. The Blues received it and
went 80 yards down the sideline to
score their fifth try.
Robinson, the Blues' fullback, dis
played his tremendous kicking tal
ent next, drop-kicking the oval from
43 yards out on the right side of the j
green for three points.
In the closing minutes, the Ox
ford-Cambridge fifteen stacked up
the scoring. They connected with a
25-yard penalty kick, and then the
Blues' Steve Coles ran 50 yards for
another try. The conversion was
good. A long rush followed which
ended in another try, scored by the
touring team's Robin Plumbridge.
The gun sounded with Stanford
on the Blues' eight.
Stanford's coach. Pete Kmetovic,
said, "They kept the ball moving
fast and ran us to death." He said
that the Britishers play a different
kind of rugby than we do in this
country. Kmetovic praised Bill |
i Lawrence and Harry Morgan in the
Oxford-Cambridge back field.
"The scrum-half, Dick Umber, is
very good,"' he said. "His two-hand
led backhand pitch - out from the
| scrum was more than the Indians j
I could cope with."
