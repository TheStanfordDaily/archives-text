One thing is certain about the Se
lective Service draft.. Sooner or la
ter almost all of Stanford's physi
cally fit males will have been in it.
But June graduates may have a
long wait unless they voluntarily
join the service.
Few people care to predict what
Congress will do about the new
draft law it is working on. But sen
iors will probably go into the armed
services under a law similar to the
present one. The older the senior is
the more likely it is that he will be
called soon after graduation.
If underclassmen stay at certain
required grade levels they have a
good chance of remaining at the
University on a scholastic deferment
no matter what the details of the
proposed law. The required levels
are standing in the upper half of the
class as a freshman, the upper two
thirds as a sophomore, and the up
per three-fourths as a junior.
-Between now and 1959, 5Vz mil
lion men will become eligible for
induction into the service and it has
been estimated by the government
that 2.8 million will be needed, bar
ring national emergency.
Another way of remaining in the
University while draft - eligible is
service in the ROTC, the National
Guard, or any of the servicc re
serves.
A.ny questions concerning military
service may be directed to W. J.
