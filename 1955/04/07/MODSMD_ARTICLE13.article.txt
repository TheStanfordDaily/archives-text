# Vets' Vouchers For March Due
## 
### 
Veterans attending school under
the Korean GI bill must sign their
March attendance voucher before
tomorrow if they want to receive
their monthly allowance on time.
Veterans who have not signed for
March yet arc advised to go to the
National Services Office on Inner
Quad as soon as possible. Failure to
sign means a delay of HO days in
receipt of allowance, officials said.
