# Campus Sceneryâ€” Truck Changes It
## 
### 
The Con Home sign-ups banner
won't be hanging over the street in
front of the Cellar tomorrow a'<
scheduled. In fact there won't be
any banners for some time. Al
though most of the recent changes
in campus scenery have come about
through the efforts of the Planning
Office, this latest development came
about through the efforts of Bill
Ferrctti, truckdriver.
Fcrrctti's truck was peaceably en
gaged in proceeding down Lasuen
Street when its top met with a low
hanging wire strung between the
posts. At this point Con Home pub
licity chairman Jerry Fitzgerald let
loose a lady-like "Oh, my!" The po
lice report, later followed with the
comment: "ASSU at fault,. Wire too
low." Ferrctti was not available for
comment.
