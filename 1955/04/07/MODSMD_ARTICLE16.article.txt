# Mrs. Younger Relates Colorful Political Life
## Demo-GOP Contrasted 
### DAVE SCOTT 
An impression oi her political
experiences and her opinion of
the differences between the Re
publican and Democratic parties
were given by Mildred Young
er in her talk at Cubberley Au
ditorium last night under the
auspices of the Political Union.
The defeated Republican candi
date for State Senator from Los An
geles told the audience her pari in
the drafting of the Republican ra
tional platform in the national con
vention in Chicago in 1952, in winch
she was appointed secretary of the
platform committee and ehainmn of
the Civil Rights sub-committee.
"When I was appointed to the
committee, everybody told me not
to worry about it and ju.st. have ;i
good time. However, we worked 2')
hours a day."
Mrs. Younger recalled interview
ing 22 witnesses sent by Walter Reu
ther before her Civil Rights .sub
committee. Reuther was just w;ht
ing for the convention to turn down
his witnesses, she said, "but we
heard them all out. The sincerity oi
many of the witnesses really im
pressed me, however."
THE CAMPAIGN
"When I returned to California,''
she continued, "I found the present
State Senator (Jack Tenney) an ad
vocate of the very bigotry policy
that the Republican party opposed
in its platform, so I decided to run
against him. The ensuing campaign
could have been bloodier or noisier,
but I don't know how."
Mrs. Younger told of the placing
of ifazel Younger on the ballot and
then the disappearance of the for
mer insane asylum inmate. "She
came back three days before the
election and blackmailed the Tenney
group, and it couldn't have hap
pened to a nicer group."
Moving on to the final election.
Mrs. Younger said that while the
Younger name tactic hadn't harmed
her in the primary, it did definitely
hurt her in her campaign against
Democrat Richard Richards.
PARTY DIFFERENCES
She then moved on to what she
thought was the basic difference be
tween the Republican and Demo
cratic parties. "The Democrats as
constituted today sec a larger and
larger role for the federal govern
ment and the administrative branch
as the dominant branch of govern
ment.
'"The Republicans, on the other
hand, stress the role of the individ
ual citizen in government and want,
more of a balance between the three
branches of the federal government.
Their interest in the importance of
state and local government is shown
in the program of Earl Warren,
which takes care of the obligation of
government at the state level. If
this iS not done," said Mrs. Younger,
"federal bureaucracy is inevitable."

An impression oi her political
experiences and her opinion of
the differences between the Re
publican and Democratic parties
were given by Mildred Young
er in her talk at Cubberley Au
ditorium last night under the
auspices of the Political Union.
The defeated Republican candi
date for State Senator from Los An
geles told the audience her pari in
the drafting of the Republican ra
tional platform in the national con
vention in Chicago in 1952, in winch
she was appointed secretary of the
platform committee and ehainmn of
the Civil Rights sub-committee.
"When I was appointed to the
committee, everybody told me not
to worry about it and ju.st. have ;i
good time. However, we worked 2')
hours a day."
Mrs. Younger recalled interview
ing 22 witnesses sent by Walter Reu
ther before her Civil Rights .sub
committee. Reuther was just w;ht
ing for the convention to turn down
his witnesses, she said, "but we
heard them all out. The sincerity oi
many of the witnesses really im
pressed me, however."
THE CAMPAIGN
"When I returned to California,''
she continued, "I found the present
State Senator (Jack Tenney) an ad
vocate of the very bigotry policy
that the Republican party opposed
in its platform, so I decided to run
against him. The ensuing campaign
could have been bloodier or noisier,
but I don't know how."
Mrs. Younger told of the placing
of ifazel Younger on the ballot and
then the disappearance of the for
mer insane asylum inmate. "She
came back three days before the
election and blackmailed the Tenney
group, and it couldn't have hap
pened to a nicer group."
Moving on to the final election.
Mrs. Younger said that while the
Younger name tactic hadn't harmed
her in the primary, it did definitely
hurt her in her campaign against
Democrat Richard Richards.
PARTY DIFFERENCES
She then moved on to what she
thought was the basic difference be
tween the Republican and Demo
cratic parties. "The Democrats as
constituted today sec a larger and
larger role for the federal govern
ment and the administrative branch
as the dominant branch of govern
ment.
'"The Republicans, on the other
hand, stress the role of the individ
ual citizen in government and want,
