# British Wit Enlivens Tuesday Series Debate
## 
### EDA MENDELS 
With a flurry of witticisms and contradictory quotes, Stanford
University of London debaters met in the Tuesday Evening Series
program to argue the pros and cons of United States recognition
of Red China.
As yet, the winners have not been determined. Instead of in-

viting judges to render a verdict; *
Speech Association distributed ballots
among the audience, and the nearly
1.000 votes cast by the listeners have
not yet been tallied.
Dr. Donald Sikkink, adviser to the
Speech Association, did look through
some of the ballots. "On the basis of

I the 100 I have examined, I predict a
I draw in the minds of the audience,"
! lie said. He counted the number of
| people who changed their minds from
i the affirmative to the negative po-
I sition, and vice-versa.
The British team, composed of Miss
I Jennifer Copeman and Lester Borlcy,
president, and vice-chairman respect
ively of the student body of the Uni
versity of London, presented the af
firmative of the night's resolution,
I 'That the United States should ex
tend diplomatic recognition to the
! Communist government of China,
j Dave Jacobson and Doug Aitken,
i speaking for Stanford, showed the
| negative. Jacobson and A 1 Brou.se,
i chairman of the debate, were the
! only Americans on the platform, for
' Aitken is a Scot from the Isle of Man,
! currently at Stanford to work for an
M.A. in history.
ARGUMENTS ADVANCED
Borlcy opened the argument for
j the affirmative. "Great Britain recog
i nizes what is a fact, and recognition
j docs not imply a mark of approval."
He elaborated, "Chiang Kai-shek is
a thing of the past."
Britain's attitude toward Southeast
i Asia, unlike that of the U.S., is not
"clouded with emotionalism, Borlcy
continued. He found that American
policy labored under a "sense of
humiliation" since the overthrow of
the Nationalist government in 1940.
Jacobsen, first negative speaker,
countered, "Recognition rocs beyond
admitting that the government of
Communist China exists. It implies
and requires the entrance into full
' diplomatic relations between the two
governments."
He also suggested that if the U.S.
were to recognize Red China, the only
reason for the separate existence of
j Formosa would be gone.
' Mis,s Copeman, for tin affirmative,

I
denied absolutely that recognition
implies the loss of Formosa. She
raised several possible objections to
recognition, then refuted each in
turn.
For instance, she listed Communist
China's aggressive policy as a reason
for non-recognition. Then she dis
posed of it by pointing out that U.S.
policy just encourages aggression,
since it. leaves no other avenues for
j communication.
In her discussion of the duties of
the democracies, Mi.ss Copeman de-
I scribed the democratic system with,
"people know what they want, and
deserve to get it good and hard." She
quoted Churchill that recognition is
"not conferring a compliment but ac
quiring a convenience."
Aitken, in the last constructive
speech of the evening, compared
what the U.S. would gain or lose as
leader of the Western world by
' recognizing Red China. As gains he
suggested the good will of India and
Japan, and trade relations with
China.
Aitken saw "no practical reason"
i for recognition till the Red Chinese
would show their "constructive
! ability to cooperate." Such U.S. Ac-

lion now would "open the door to
ward eventual recognition by many
other nations."
BRITISH HUMOR
Typical of the many barbs ex
chanced during the evening was Miss
Cope man's, "You can lead a boy to
college but you can't make him
think."
Borlcy appeaied to the audience
with his mention of the Bay Area as
the "home of San Quentin, Alcatraz,
and the University of California."
Miss Copeman's caustic reference
to the Stanford team as, "These are
debaters plain and simple," reflected
the difference between the English
and American styles of debate. The
British accent seems to be on wit and
mental agility, while Americans stress
the presentation of a logical, factual
case, as moderator Brouse said in his
int rodiid ion.
