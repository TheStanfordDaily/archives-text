# reckless stupidity ...... an editorial
## 
### 
We were standing out at the intersection of
Lomita and Santa Teresa, near Roble Hall, the
other evening, talking to the cop sitting there
in his radio car, when a car coming down
from Lagunita Court driving at about forty
miles an hour, twice the speed limit, went
through the fourway stop without so much as
slowing down.
We laughed a little at how much trouble
that fellow was going to catch, as the cop went
after him, siren wailing and red light blinking.
But if you stop to think . . . it's nothing to
laugh about. A qirl walking home to Roble
could have been in that intersection, and at
foriy miles an hour you don't have much
chance to slop quickly.
Sure, the speeder got a long lecture, but
*
then he probably got just the standard traffic

ticket, and the prices start at $2. Not much of
a price to pay for recltfess stupidity. You hi:
someone at that speed and how much are you
going to pay them? How much does a human
life cost? You add it up.
The University talks in terms of rerouting
campus traffic to ease the problem, but it will
be a matter of time and expense. Meanwhile,
they're slow to do anything about the exist
ing problems which will later . . . theoretically
. . . be obviated.
If we can't have the improved roads right
away, then we must have some other answer
to the problem. You'd think that Stanford
drivers could figure out the dangers for them
selves . . . but if they can't (and so far they
haven't) then what we need is even more
fast, tough enforcement of traffic laws we do
have.
