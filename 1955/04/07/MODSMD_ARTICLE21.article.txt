Man in France says taxes are unfair. In fact
he says "don't pay 'em." Don't know much
about the situation in France, but around here
thine are mighty poor in the state-type tax
field.
It's getting so bad that the tax-paying Stan
ford stident is forced to pa'y the freight for, of
all things, the University of California. Bad.
Real bad. Might even call it a shame. A cryin'
shame.
Cal puts up a new building and where do
they get the backing? Right. Out of the lin
ing of our pockets. This is free-will democracy
in ac' >n?
vv <t Stanford student would ever think of
ting the teddy-bears from Berkeley?
£ut whether he wants to or not the cold fact is
there. He hasio, it's the law of the land.
Every time I light a smoke I can see the
scoreboard at the finale of last season's Big
One, with Cal the winner. Partly due to the
damn tax I paid on that cigarette. The tax
laws are making traitors of us all. «
Time, as the man said, for a change.
Obviously we can't refuse to pay (oh glor
ious thought) the taxes. Jail, you know.

And just as obviously we can't give up those
necessities of a real life that are taxed.
The only way to make things square be
tween California and Stanford on the fields of
glory is to give Stanford "points for taxes,"
as it were. Best way to figure the amount of
points due to Farm squads would be to com
pute the total amount of state taxes paid by
Stanford students, figure what percentage of
the money which the state gives to Cal that
total constitutes and allow Stanford a point for
every 10 per cent or so.
Had this been done in the past the over all
Big Game standings would be enormously in
the favor of the Red and White.
My tax research shows that Stanford stu
dents, being great users of taxed products,
have paid a tremendous amount of the fi
nancial load for Cal. Why, without us they'd
probably not even have fields to practice on
down Berkeley way.
But on second thought, why bother anyway?
Even with all our help we've always been the
obviously superior club.
It takes all that help to bring Cal up near
our level.

down Berkeley way.
But on second thought, why bother anyway?
Even with all our help we've always been the
obviously superior club.
It takes all that help to bring Cal up near
our level.
Man in France says taxes are unfair. In fact
he says "don't pay 'em." Don't know much
about the situation in France, but around here
thine are mighty poor in the state-type tax
field.
It's getting so bad that the tax-paying Stan
ford stident is forced to pa'y the freight for, of
all things, the University of California. Bad.
Real bad. Might even call it a shame. A cryin'
shame.
Cal puts up a new building and where do
they get the backing? Right. Out of the lin
ing of our pockets. This is free-will democracy
in ac' >n?
vv <t Stanford student would ever think of
ting the teddy-bears from Berkeley?
£ut whether he wants to or not the cold fact is
there. He hasio, it's the law of the land.
Every time I light a smoke I can see the
scoreboard at the finale of last season's Big
One, with Cal the winner. Partly due to the
damn tax I paid on that cigarette. The tax
laws are making traitors of us all. «
Time, as the man said, for a change.
Obviously we can't refuse to pay (oh glor
ious thought) the taxes. Jail, you know.

And just as obviously we can't give up those
necessities of a real life that are taxed.
The only way to make things square be
tween California and Stanford on the fields of
glory is to give Stanford "points for taxes,"
as it were. Best way to figure the amount of
points due to Farm squads would be to com
pute the total amount of state taxes paid by
Stanford students, figure what percentage of
the money which the state gives to Cal that
total constitutes and allow Stanford a point for
every 10 per cent or so.
Had this been done in the past the over all
Big Game standings would be enormously in
the favor of the Red and White.
My tax research shows that Stanford stu
dents, being great users of taxed products,
have paid a tremendous amount of the fi
nancial load for Cal. Why, without us they'd
probably not even have fields to practice on
down Berkeley way.
But on second thought, why bother anyway?
Even with all our help we've always been the
obviously superior club.
It takes all that help to bring Cal up near
our level.
