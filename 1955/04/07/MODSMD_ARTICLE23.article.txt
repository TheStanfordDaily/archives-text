The dark suspicion in which Dixie fans and modern jazz
aficionado:: he: / one another has obscured tho fact that their dif
ferences are sir--;:iy a matter of evolution. Dixie was a simple
form of ' : ;re .s ,n to which various innovations were added
which resulted in modern jazz. And now, to this half-century

proa wo are told that a now ad -*
ditiuii has been, made, West Coast
Jazz. Is it a significant innovation?
From its very birth in New Or
leans, jazz took on a format it has I
never abandoned a driving beat, j
improvisation, and interplay be- I
twaen the instruments. ("Jazz" was
derived from the French "juser," to
chat, from th 1 way the instrumenl ;
talk back and lorth.) Jazz also
achieved a capacity for mood with
the blue.', a name given to a stand
ardized chord progression over
which an expre sive solo could bo I
improvised.
Kansas City and Cairigo jazz
brought the written arrangement
and increased ensemble work. It is
characteristic of all jazz that the
soloist is given opportunity to im
provise, but the addition of ensem
ble work'meant more power and ex
citement, and justified larger 112 unds.
From the northern groups o! Ben
Pollack and Red Nichols came many
of the hit; hand Icadci of Ihc 1930'.:. '
tih: :io's
Thus the 30's became the age of j
big bands, swing, and the arranger.
Benny Godman and Count Be, ie
ppitomized the swing era -big ox
citing groups with a lot of precise
ensemble work and the same driv
ing beat that Dixie had, ,vta wc ''
sometimes for dancing. Meanwhile
Duke Ellington was running a big !
band on a different basis, experi
menting with rich, .moody sounds'
and compositions that were to add !
their weight to modern jazz through
their influence on modern arrangers |
like Ralph Burns and Bill Russo.
Toward the end of the 30 s, musi- |
cians and public alike began to miss I
the advantages of the small group, ,
which has always been the best j
. howca e for m-v/ ideas. Benny
Goodman al «ihc Palomar in L.A. be- I
gun reviving small group work dur
ing intermissions and elsewhere a
"Chamber Jazz' movement grew,
with John Kirby, Alec Wilder, and
Raymond Scott leading small exper
imental bands. The band business
remained strong, but small groups j
began recording things which were j
released after the war, helping bring i
about the post-war revival of small j
group jazz.
Then in 1945, Dizzy Gillespie pro- j
duced bebop, a blessing in heavy |
disguised Most people were suspi-r i
cious (Tommy Dorsey said, "I don't
know anything about bebop and I
don't like the looks of the people
who do") and Dizzy's band eventu"-
ally folded. But the blessing, the
new forms for jazz, stayed on. New I

i,n t ica t e rhythm patterns, new
chord . and cadences, Afro - Cuban
heal-:, parallel instrumental voicings,
and speedy, soaring solos gave all
u! equent jazz a new sound. No
body say . oop-bop-sh'bam any more
but you're still hearing bop.
COOL JAZZ
Where Dizzy screeched, Miles Da
vh-. and George Shearing played
>oftly, and cool jazz was born. The
new sounds w.ere easier to take, and
nici • logical, if played quietly and
by ;,ood musicians rather than the
inept crews that Dizzy labored with.
So Woody Herman succeeded where
Dizzy failed, and with him oldsters
hi.-' Red Norvo and new men like
Shorty Rogers learned the new
soun.s. From Miles Davis came
Jerry Mulligan, John Lewis (the
Modem Jazz Quartet), and Chet
Baker.
West Coast Jazz? Its heritage is
the Dixie format, the driving en
emble work of the swing era, the
experimental arranging of hands
from Ellington to Kenton, the
rhythms, voicings, and detached
nes.H of bop, and a public that ex
peels constant innovation as a mat
ter of course.
And it.) innovations? Listen to
albums like "Chet Baker with
Strings," or Shelly Manne Vol. 2, or
a limbeck improvisation, for the
key. It is jazz taking itself seriously.
The men who are arranging West
Coast Jazz are studying classical and
contemporary music now, to learn
and master what 500 years of musi
cal evolution can teach.
SERIOUS STUDENTS
Marty Paich, Jack, Montrose,
Shorty Rogers, Nat Pierce, Jack
Weeks, Bruheck, and others are se
rious music students. Their success
is indicated by the fact that Mont
ro.c. for one, has been asked by
Ballet Theater to expand one of his
compositions into a ballet score.
But most significantly, jazz has nev
er been bigger business than it is
right now. It can only get bigger.
