Broken hemes, loss of blood,
laboratory tesis, X-rays, im- 1
munizations: all these are taken
care of for the student by the
Stanford Health Service.
The mcdical coverage of the
Health Service is comprehensive.
All regularly enrolled students are j
eligible for clinical services andj
medical treatment within a 10-mile j
radius of campus. Coverage begins !
with regi.-t ration except for the loot- 1
ball squad, who come early and for i
whose coverage the University pays ,
a small fee, ami for those students j
concerned with pre-reg activities, j
The costs of this coverage are in- !
eluded in the tuition foe. At present '
the Health Service spends approxi- •
mately $13.50 per : t .ident per quar- ;
t< r. The cost of a single vi. it to the ;
Health Service is about $1.75 per
student.
Hospitalization cost., about $3.11!'
per student per month, are relative- j
ly high becatifo ol' the liberal policy !
toward correcting defects which ex- i
ifi before matriculation at Stanford, j
MEDICAL CAKE
Full nr dical and surgical care and |
treatment .are available for all con- i
ditions compatible with student life, j
Excluded from this category are s
drug addiction, chronic alcoholism,
active pulmonary tuberculosis, in- j
anity, and the results of attempted |
suicide. in these cases, the service j
are restricted to the time necessary
for emergency treatment, diagnosis, j
and disposition.

Hospitalization for 100 days for
any one illness except for poliomy
elitis or its effects, for which cover
agi Ls limited to 21 days, is included.

STAFF PHYSICIANS
Staff physicians are available on

case of illness or injury, students
:nay go either to the Health Service
oflfica or to the Palo Alto Clinic.
The Student Health Committee
keeps the Health Service informed
of the patient's point of view. The
eomin i 11 e e "was instrumental in
bringing excuses for illness under
the Honor Code, thereby doing away
with the need for signed statements
of illness.
Since the price of transfusions is
not covered by the University, the
Student Health Committee set up
the ASSU account in the Peninsula
Memorial Blood Bank. So long as a
balance is maintained in the account
students are not saddled with the
cost of the blood ($22.50); they have
onl\ to pay its processing charge
($7.50).
Through its many facets and com
plete coverage, the Health Service
cares for the well-being of Stan
lord.
