## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Stanford's varsity tennis squad flies south this afternoon to
beard a couple of good sized lions in their dens. And a consider
able amount of fur should fly as the Indians land in the midst of
league play with a match against USC tomorrow and one against
dofonding-champ UCLA on Saturday.
Tomorrow's match v/ith SC will be held on the Los Angeles
Ti nni Club courts at .'5 p.m. Satur- ♦

cl; yV ma toll is at the UCLA varsity
courts at 1 p.m.
Coach Bob Renker is traveling
Willi a seven-man team. Leading
the Indian notrnen, of course, will
I captain .Jack Fro. I, 12th-ranked
player in the nation. Besides Frost
the Stanford lineup will of
Ernie Dußray, Bob Prince, Dave
Dun', Roeer Keesing, Macky Wirth,
and Bob Norton.
Doublss combinations will be

Frost - Duff, Dußray - Keesing,
Prince-Norton.
Both matches will be tough. On
paper USC would seem to be the
strongest of the southern teams.
Frost will have the task of flattening
Troy's wiley Jacque Gigry. Rated
25th in the country, Gigry lias de
feated Frost before, and although
Frost is the better player, may have
a psychological advantage. Backing
Gi.ury will be Alan Cleveland, A!
Call, and Modesto JC transfers Pan
clio Contreras and Joaquin Reyes.
While UCLA has been hurt by
the graduation of Bob Perry and
Ron Livingston, and other front-line
players, they still are a solid team.
Playing number on > will be Dick
Doss, advanced from the fourth sin
gles position last year. Doss is a
three-year veteran in the Uclan ten
nis machine, as is co-captain Jimmy
Read. Behind this pair the lineup
will probably consist of Joe Blatch
i'ord, Dwight Makolf, Stan Canter,
and Craig Garman.
