# Les 						Brown to Tour Europe After Stanford's Junior Prom
## 
### 
The Junior Prom, at which Les Brown will appear on Friday,
April 15, will be one of the last engagements in the United
States before the "Band of Renown" leaves for a tour of Europe
with Bob Hope, which will take them to the principal military
establishments.
Brown, in the many years he has been, with Hope, has made

several such benefit tours, and in
the process has established the fact
that the "Band of Renown" has
played before larger audiences than
any other band in the country.
The last trip with Hope was to
Korea, covering some 25,000 miles
to entertain 500,000 servicemen in
the Orient.
The group has gained nation-wide
popularity since it first came into
the limelight following World War
11. Last year "Downbeat," among
many other music magazines, eon
ducted a readership poll which gave
Brown the title of "America's Most
Popular Dance Band."
Castlewood Country Club is the
site of the prom, and, according to
sources, is the largest prom site ever
obtained. The club recently was re
modeled in a multi-million-dollar
project. The club is a 45 - rmnute
drive from campus.
Ticket sales for the prom continue
this week and next week in living
groups and on campus. The price is
$3.75, and the tickets will be ex
changed for decorative bids at the
door.
