# Varsity Crew To Duel USC
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
The waters of Redwood City' harbor will churn under the white
lipped oars of Stanford and Southern California crews tomorrow
as the Indians host the Trojans in a series of three races.
The varsity event will start at 12:30 p.m. and will be preceded
by races featuring Stanford junior varsity and frosh boats at 11:30

a.m. and noon, respectively.
The races over the 2,000-meter
Olympic sprint distance will he the
second of the season for the Stan
fords. USC has not yet been tested
under race conditions and conse
quently the strength of the visitors
is unknown.
In their opening outing, Stanford
whipped the Oregon State varsity
shell l>y two and a half lengths.
Iri the preliminary race, the Indian
frosh established themselves as fu
ture contenders by coming in ahead
of the OSC junior varsity boat. The
Indians' junior varsity was third in
the race.
Tomorrow the frosh will take on
the Trojan's number three varsity
boat while the Tribe junior varsity
will fare the USC second shell.
STRONGER CREW
Stanford may have its best crew of
rowers in 15 years and may be on
its way back into national prom
inence as it was in the early 1940's,
according to Coach Lou Lindsey.
Lod by co-captains Rowd Davis
and Dan Ayrault, the Cards are deep
in size and experience this season
and should cause lots of trouble for
any team they face.
Davis, who is only a junior, is
rated a top coxswain. And Ayrault,
another junior, is a big stroke, a
powerful oarsman who is capable of
raising the beat when necessary.
CARDS FAVORED
Although SC is allegedly stronger
this year than last, Stanford will be
favored in al three races tomorrow.
The junior varsity, stroked by Fred
Schumacher and coxed by Ciil Co
gcrty, will get the festivities under
way at 11:30 a.m. This may well be
the closest race of the day.
The frosh will leave the starting
mark at. noon in the second race. If
thoy can equal their performance of
two weeks ago, the yearlings should
easily overcome their older foes
from down south.
BETTER SPIRIT
Davis and Ayrault indicated that
they feel that the spirit on this
year's squad is considerably better
than last year.
Coach Lindsey, who was a fine
coxswain at California under the
veteran mentor Ky Ebright, has
whipped his boys into racing trim
but he has been careful to bring
them along slowly.
The only other home races for the
Indians this year will be against the
UCLA Bruins on May 21 and the
Cal regatta on June 4.
FINAL OUTING
The Tribe oarsmen will also com
pete against SC again at San Pedro
and in the Western Sprint Cham
pionships at Newport. The final out
ing will be in the nationals on New
York's Lake Ontario.
