# 'Axe' Comes Back To Farm-In Color
## 
### 
The Axe has returned to the Stan
ford campus.
But this Axe is not the traditional
Big Game trophy now in possession
of California. It is a new red and
white axe - .shaped shoulder patch
being worn by members of the
Stanford Police Department.
The real Axe will have to remain
in Berkeley until a winning Stan
ford team can claim the prize.
