# New Post Office Will Be Built Next to SAE House
## 
### 
The battered post office building which has served the campus
since 1900 will be replaced by a new structure directly across
the street, the University announced yesterday.
The new building, costing about $150,000, essentially will be
a longer, lower version of its predecessor, with a tile roof and a

porch across the front. But it will*
be more than twice as large—7,000
square feet as compared to 3,000.
John C. Warnecke, San Francisco
i architect and football player with
the 1941-42 Wow Boys, is drawing
preliminary plans which will be re
viewed with the Post Office Depart
ment. Stanford will erect the build
ing, probably beginning construc
1 tion late this summer, and will lease
| it to the government.
NEXT TO SAE
The new campus mail center will j
be on Lasuen Street., adjoining the {
Sigma Alpha Epsilon house. An old
and unoccupied private residence on
the Row side of SAE will be razed
to clear an area for the new post
office.
According to Kenneth Cuthbert
son, assistant to t.he president, the
SAE's will not be forced to move
from their present location because
of the new building.
Postal trucks will reach the load
ing ramp at. the rear of the building
via the service lane between Salva
tierra and Lasuen Streets.
ROAD PLAN
When the planned peripheral road
system goes into operation and cur
rent roads arc closed, the lane will
be the only automobile approach to
the post, office.
The existing post office, of brick
construction with stucco facing re
sembling the sandstone of the origi
nal University buildings, will, be
torn down.
The site of the old building will
j be redeveloped as part of the Stu
i dent Activities Center. Presently j

projected for the center arc the
Florence H. Dinkelspiel music thea
ter and the Tresidder Memorial Un
ion. Existing Union buildings even
tually are to be remodeled and inte
grated with the theater and Tresid
der units.
Stanford's first post office was es
tablished in 1893, two years after
the University opened, in a small
wooden cottage in back of where
Memorial Church now stands.

This was the building students
painted red when word was received
in 1896 that the Supreme Court had
dismissed a government suit that
would have tied up Senator Stan
ford's estate.
The present building was erected
by the University during the sum
mer of 1900 to serve a campus pop
ulation of 1,389 students and a fac
ulty of 136. The cost was $6,500.
The January 1925 Stanford alum

ture building plans of the University
included a new post office building
which will probably be placed across
the street and on a much larger
site."
The prophecy took 30 years to
come to pass.

This was the building students
painted red when word was received
in 1896 that the Supreme Court had
dismissed a government suit that
would have tied up Senator Stan
ford's estate.
The present building was erected
by the University during the sum
mer of 1900 to serve a campus pop
ulation of 1,389 students and a fac
ulty of 136. The cost was $6,500.
The January 1925 Stanford alum
ni magazine reports that, "the fu
ture building plans of the University
included a new post office building
which will probably be placed across
the street and on a much larger
site."
The prophecy took 30 years to
come to pass.
The battered post office building which has served the campus
since 1900 will be replaced by a new structure directly across
the street, the University announced yesterday.
The new building, costing about $150,000, essentially will be
a longer, lower version of its predecessor, with a tile roof and a

porch across the front. But it will*
be more than twice as large—7,000
square feet as compared to 3,000.
John C. Warnecke, San Francisco
i architect and football player with
the 1941-42 Wow Boys, is drawing
preliminary plans which will be re
viewed with the Post Office Depart
ment. Stanford will erect the build
ing, probably beginning construc
1 tion late this summer, and will lease
| it to the government.
NEXT TO SAE
The new campus mail center will j
be on Lasuen Street., adjoining the {
Sigma Alpha Epsilon house. An old
and unoccupied private residence on
the Row side of SAE will be razed
to clear an area for the new post
office.
According to Kenneth Cuthbert
son, assistant to t.he president, the
SAE's will not be forced to move
from their present location because
of the new building.
Postal trucks will reach the load
ing ramp at. the rear of the building
via the service lane between Salva
tierra and Lasuen Streets.
ROAD PLAN
When the planned peripheral road
system goes into operation and cur
rent roads arc closed, the lane will
be the only automobile approach to
the post, office.
The existing post office, of brick
construction with stucco facing re
sembling the sandstone of the origi
nal University buildings, will, be
torn down.
The site of the old building will
j be redeveloped as part of the Stu
i dent Activities Center. Presently j

projected for the center arc the
Florence H. Dinkelspiel music thea
ter and the Tresidder Memorial Un
ion. Existing Union buildings even
tually are to be remodeled and inte
grated with the theater and Tresid
der units.
