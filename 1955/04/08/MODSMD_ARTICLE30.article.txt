You can read the third of a series of articles
about Stanford's Health Service in today's
Daily. You'll be reading about an establish
ment which has consistently done an excellent
job within the limits of its resources, keeping
the Stanford community hsalthy at fantastically
low cost.
Their job is a really tough one: at the Health
Service, staffers must treat conditions ranging
from incipient disease to emotional upsets and
.imaginary il tremendous volume of stu
dents move tb r ough their cramped quarters for
all sorts of treatments. It takes more than cold

professional aplomb to keep such a service
functioning.
Unfortunately, the people who have the most
to say about the Health Service—and say it in
the loudest voices — are the hypochondriacs
who were sent away with sugar pills and the
chronic fault-finders who want to be coddled
rather than cured. It isn't a regular practice to
go ciround extolling the Health Service if it
succeeds promptly in helping us (as it almost
always does).
So it's well time to salute our Health Serv
ice . . . they're over there for our good, and
that's aocd to know.


STANFORD HEALTH SERVICE: AN EXCELLENT JOB
