Today I will discuss the Army. This is not
by popular demand or anything like that; it
is just because it seems like the thing to do
at this time of the year.
It is spring. Emphatically. And there are
about two months left until the end of the
guarter. And a seasonal problem faces gen
tleml - i who are seniors. That of preparing for
th /itable call to the colors.
sir, i have considerable experience in
-vims' brown fraternity and am here to
tell you that you have noihing to fear but lear
itself. All it will amount to is two more years
to put off going to work.
Here, in short (a phrase often used to convey
the impression the writer knows even more and
is merely summarizing a vast store of informa
tion) . . . here, in short, is what you can expect:
Yoi v Ul spend about one week in a recep
tion cente * where the Airny will hold a recep
tion in your honor. From there you will be sent
to a basic trdi mg company. Forget what you
have heard < ~ ' ut basicâ€”nothing's as bad as all
that. In your basic training company you will
be encouraged to develop esprit de corps. You
will have the opportunity to get out of doors,
get plenty of fresh air, and participate in play

ful, body-building sport which is designed to
create good fellowship and camaraderie.
All in all, basic training is just good, clean
fun. Like care and cleaning of the U.S. Rifle,
Cal. 30, M-l. Or crawling on your stomach
(GET YER FACE IN THE DIRT, SOLDIER!)
through a hundred yards of sand with a hail
of tracers over your head and small charges
of nitro starch showering you with mud and
gravel as you make three trips through the
infiltration course. You'll almost enjoy that.
It's just the double-timing six miles back to
the company area afterward that will tax your
good humor.
And there is a lot of good humor in ihe Army. |
You will almost die laughing when the field j
first (an innocuous brand of sergeant) demands |
that "you get down and give me ten" (push- j
ups, soldier!). This is easy. It only wears on
you when you find he can't count past seven.
It could, as you can see, be worse. The Brit
ish sing a conscription song:
"1 don't want to join the Army,
I don't want to go to war,
I just want to 'ang around
Picadilly underground
And Jive off the earnings of me 'igh born
li-dee."
