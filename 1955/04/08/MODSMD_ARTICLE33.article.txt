## Health Service Needs Infirmary 
### RUTH WOLPE 
(The third in a series of articles about the Health Service)
Everyone has something that he needs. The Stanford Health
Service is no exception. It needs an infirmary.
Ideally this infirmary would be located near the center of stu
dent traffic. It would have facilities for 25 beds in addition to con
taining the Health Service offices.
At present two-thirds of the student bed-days are spent in ;he

rest homes or isolation hospital. The'
average stay at the rest homes is 2.3
days for tire men and 2.4 for the
women.
The 40-bed isolation hospital, used
only for the treatment of commu
nicable 'diseases, was built shortly
after the typhoid fever epidemic in
the winter of 1902-3.
REST HOMES
The buildings which house the
11-bed Men's Rest Home and the 10-
bed Women's Rest Home are do
nated by the University, which pays
the directors $'> per student per day
for food, laundry, maintenance, and
other costs. The Stanford Mothers'
Club pays the balance of the total
cost of $7.f50 per student per day.
The other third of the student bed
days are spent in the Palo Alto Hos
pital at a cost of $22 per student per
day.
By having the rest homes attached
to the Health Service, as would be
the case with an infirmary, the
nurses would be better and more ef
ficiently utilized, and total expenses
would be decreased. Patients could
be admitted at any time; there
would not be the 10 p.m. deadline
for admissions that Ls the present
policy of the rest homes.
The infirmary would have no
kitchen; meals would be brought in
from the nearest dining hall. There
would be facilities to isolate the var
ious communicable diseases.
CROWDING
The crowding of nurses and lack
of sufficient space in the present
Health Service and the doubling up
of rooms in the rest homes would be
eliminated with the building of an
infirmary. Another improvement
would be found in the physical set
up of the waiting room. At present
it is inadequate to handle the num
ber of students that come into the
Health Service during the busy
hours of the day.
One plan which has been proposed
is the incorporation of tile infirmary
into the medical school hospital
when it is built. This proposal, if
carried out, would result in greater
expense and less accessibility than
now exists with the present Health
Service. As a result of the increased
expense, medical and clinical cover
age would be decreased.
What Stanford needs is a centrally
located 25-bed infirmary with facili
ties to isolate communicable dis
eases.

into the medical school hospital
when it is built. This proposal, if
carried out, would result in greater
expense and less accessibility than
now exists with the present Health
Service. As a result of the increased
expense, medical and clinical cover
age would be decreased.
What Stanford needs is a centrally
located 25-bed infirmary with facili
ties to isolate communicable dis
eases.
(The third in a series of articles about the Health Service)
Everyone has something that he needs. The Stanford Health
Service is no exception. It needs an infirmary.
Ideally this infirmary would be located near the center of stu
dent traffic. It would have facilities for 25 beds in addition to con
taining the Health Service offices.
At present two-thirds of the student bed-days are spent in ;he

rest homes or isolation hospital. The'
average stay at the rest homes is 2.3
days for tire men and 2.4 for the
women.
The 40-bed isolation hospital, used
only for the treatment of commu
nicable 'diseases, was built shortly
after the typhoid fever epidemic in
the winter of 1902-3.
REST HOMES
The buildings which house the
11-bed Men's Rest Home and the 10-
bed Women's Rest Home are do
nated by the University, which pays
the directors $'> per student per day
for food, laundry, maintenance, and
other costs. The Stanford Mothers'
Club pays the balance of the total
cost of $7.f50 per student per day.
The other third of the student bed
days are spent in the Palo Alto Hos
pital at a cost of $22 per student per
day.
By having the rest homes attached
to the Health Service, as would be
the case with an infirmary, the
nurses would be better and more ef
ficiently utilized, and total expenses
would be decreased. Patients could
be admitted at any time; there
would not be the 10 p.m. deadline
for admissions that Ls the present
policy of the rest homes.
The infirmary would have no
kitchen; meals would be brought in
from the nearest dining hall. There
would be facilities to isolate the var
ious communicable diseases.
CROWDING
The crowding of nurses and lack
of sufficient space in the present
Health Service and the doubling up
of rooms in the rest homes would be
eliminated with the building of an
infirmary. Another improvement
would be found in the physical set
up of the waiting room. At present
it is inadequate to handle the num
ber of students that come into the
Health Service during the busy
hours of the day.
One plan which has been proposed
is the incorporation of tile infirmary
into the medical school hospital
when it is built. This proposal, if
carried out, would result in greater
expense and less accessibility than
now exists with the present Health
Service. As a result of the increased
expense, medical and clinical cover
age would be decreased.
