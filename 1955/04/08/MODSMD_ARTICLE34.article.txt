# Berlin Pastor Visits Campus
## 
### DOROTHY CAMPBELL 
Wolfgang Pommor, chaplain of !
the Free University of Berlin, stop
ped unexpectedly at thr> Stanford 1
campus yesterday on his 60 - day |
visit to the United States. Pommer !
first visited Memorial Church and
then the Cellar.
''I always try to see the people of
this country to understand it," he
said. "Often I go into the depart
ment stores without buying any- |
thing just to observe the people. It
takes me half a day to adjust my
self when I go from one state to
another. Even the difference be- j
tween Los Angeles and San Fran
cisco is great. Los Angeles is more j
like a great, spread-out field than
a city."
Originally from Austria, Pommer
went to Berlin in spite of warnings
from his friends that he was crazy
to go to such a danger area.
"Berlin," he said, "is no more j
dangerous than any other place. It
has the atmosphere I like. It is
strongly anti-Communist and anti
nationalist.
"There are many problems at the
Free University: too few professors,
not enough money for the students.
And inadequate housing facilities
are growing worse as students from
the Russian sector continue to pout
in."
