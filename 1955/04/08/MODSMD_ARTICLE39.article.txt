tory since 1951, the UCLA Bruins entertain Stanford's Indians io

Bruin middle-distance ace Bob Sea
man threatening to smash both the
880 and mile marks. The discus and
high jump are the other events in
which new best marks may be set.
Aside from tne javelin and high
jump, the Card tracksters appear to
have the most strength in the
sprints. Indian ace Keith Browns
be rger seems to have a slight edge
in the 100 and 220, but will be of
fered stiff competition from team
mate Jim Saras and Bruins Bert
Kohnhorst, Don Malloy, Bob Da
ligney, and Biil Mason.
Walt Garrett, with a 47.9 quarter
mile to his credit, will be counted
upon by the Cards for a first place

has turned in a 48.8, and Bruin ace
JRuss Ellis, with a 49.0 best,, are
expected to battle it out for the
second spot.
SHAMAN DOMINATES

dominate the picture in the middle
distance events. The swift Seaman
has a 1:54.8 best in the 880 as com
pared with the meet mark of 1:54.7.
In the mile, Bob's top of 4:14.4 needs
little improvement to topple the
meet record of 4:12.6.
Wil King, Indian long distance
star, could give the breezing Bruin
trouble in the mile, boasting a 4:18.4

best. Card Chuck Strong (4:21.5)
and Uclun Pat Delgado (4:23.0)
round out the field.
Hustling Bob Hunt looks like a
solid bet in the two-mile for UCLA.
Cards King and Strong, doubling up
in the two long events, will provide
Hunt with his stilfest competitoin.
1J A LANCED HURDLERS
UCLA's- well - balanced crew of
hurdlers give the hosts a strong ad
vantage in these events. Dave Ro
sellini, Jim Ball, and Chuck Hollo
way form a combo which will be
tough for Card stick-jumpers Ber
nie Nelson and Jim Luttrell to crack.
If previous times are any indica
tion, Ball (14.4) and Ro.scllini (14.5)
should take one-two in the high
barriers. Nelson has run the tall
timber in 14.0 while Luttrell's best
time is 14.8.
Four high jumpers, three Indians
and one Bruin, have a chance to
shatter the meet record of 6-5% to
morrow. Uclan Nick Dyer has
leaped . Phil Fehlen, with a
6-6 best, also must merely match his
1955 best to crack the mark. John
Stewart, who jumped 6-6 as a fresh
man, and Norm Jiles boast 6-5 bests
this year.
Ron Drummond, husky Bruin ath
lete, has come within two inches of
the meet standard in discus-throw
ing this season. The previous best
is 165-4%, while Drummond has
hurled the platter 165-3.
JAVELIN SWEEP
Stanford figures for a sweep of the
javelin. Cards Bob Kimball (219-2)
and John Bugge (214-2) are two of
the top spear-tossers in collegiate
circles.
The Uclans should also show su
periority in the shot put, pole vault,
and broad jump. Don Vick (55-2)
and Clyde Wetter (54-2) pace the
Bruins in the shot. Mel Hill (13-9)
will have competition from team
mate Lindy Kell (13-0) and Indians
Bill Flint (13-0) and John Whalen
(13-0) in the pole vault.
