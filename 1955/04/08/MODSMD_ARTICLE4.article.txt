# Scientists Check Effects of Fallout

### 
WASHINGTON — The National
Academy of Sciences announced to
day that a group of the nation's top
scientists will make a far-reaching
investigation of the "biological ef
fects" of radioactive* fallout from
atomic and hydrogen bombs.
The study will be designed to
clear up "wide differences of opin
ion" as to whether continued use of
atomic energy, especially in bomb
form, could lead to an increase in
the number of defective children
born to future generations or other
wise harm mankind.
