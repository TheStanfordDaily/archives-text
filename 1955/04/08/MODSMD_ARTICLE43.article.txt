# Cubs Host Frosh Nine
## 
### 
Coach Dick Clegg's freshman base
ball team, rolling on a two-game
winning streak, tackles the Cal Cubs
today in the first of a three-game se
ries. The Papooses have already
scored victories over Santa Rosa
and Capuchino this week.
The Cub contest, which will be
held on the California campus, will
start at 2:30.
Expected to pitch for the Card
frosh in the first contest in the series
is George Avery. A hard-throwing
right-hander, Avery has compiled a
1-1 record so far this season.
Pacing the Papooses at the bat will
be second baseman Al Shaw, out
fielder Al Spurgeon, and cleanup
hitting catcher Doug Camilli.
Shaw is belting the ball at a .067
clip including three extra-base hits.
Long ball hitting Spurgeon has a
.400 average at this point. Camilli
broke a slump in the Capuchino
game, rapping out two sharp base
hits.
Filling out the lineup are infield
ers Phil Castellucci, Bob Dwight,
and either Ron Jones or Bob Flan
ders, and outfielder Wayne West.
