# Deanmen to Meet SJS, Bercovich Over Weekend
## 
### 
Coach Everett Dean's varsity
nine takes a weekend off from
CIBA play today and tomorrow,
but they don't get a rest. San
Jose Siate plays tne Indians here
this afternoon, and tomorrow
the semi-pro Bercovich Furni
ture team of Oakland will cross
bats with the Cards.
San Jose split a pair of earlier
games with the Stanfords, and is a
top llight ball club, sparked by sev
eral hard-hitting sophomores. Only
one of last year's regulars is still
playing first .string this year, .so tal
ented are Spartan coach Walt Wil
liams' newcomers.
State beat Oregon twice quite
handily right after the Ducks had
given it to the Indians by 3-0 and
7-4 scores, but Stanford has im
proved tremendously since then. In
its last four games Stanford has av
eraged 14 runs and 14 hits.
SHAKING DUTIES
Ray Young and Walt Payne, he
roes of last week's three - game
sweep, will toe the mound against
the Spartans, splitting the nine in
nings between them. The hurler for
the Bercovich tilt is still undeter
mined.
Dean will start the same lineup
that started against the Bruins and
Broncs last week, except possibly in
right field, where the battle between
Dick Workman and Tom Dandurand
is still in progress.
Reese Dick, 3-1 on the year, will
hurl for the Spartans, who scored 35
runs in two games last Saturday.
Leading the hitting attack for the
visitors will be catcher Jerry Clif
ford at .433 and Tuck Halsey. right
field, with a .405 mark. Both are
sophomores.

Although Stanford i.s idle in CIBA
play, their chances for a first-place
finish depend a lot on what happens
at Bovard Field. Cal plays USC
twice in the Trojans' lair, and if the
Figueroa Streeters should win two,
they would be tough to catch.
