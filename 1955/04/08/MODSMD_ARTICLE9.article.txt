Thirty-five eucalyptus . trees
that are a menace to passing
traffic because they have been
weakened by disease will be re
moved from Stanford property
along El Camino Real between
Palm Drive and the Embarcadero
intersection.
A half dozen of the trees, in spaces
where redwoods or oaks arc not al
ready growing, will be topped and
left temporarily in order to preserve
the area's appearance.
As soon as the removal program
is completed, the University plans
to plant 150 oak trees along the fence
in clusters of three and four, ac
cording to Carroll L. Blacker, sup
erintendent of buildings and
grounds.
The oaks, three to live feet high,
are already growing in containers
in the University's nursery. They
will have to be watered and tended
for four or five years after they arc
planted, Blacker pointed out.
The University is removing the
eucalyptus trees because they have
been attacked by fungus and rot that
have weakened their root systems
and caused large branches to fall,
the superintendent said. He esti
mates that the trees are over 50
years old, an advanced age for the
eucalyptus.
All trees that could fall on the
fence or highway, most of them 80
to 100 feet high, are being taken
down.
