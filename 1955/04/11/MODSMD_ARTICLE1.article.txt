# Stanford Oarsmen Leave USC Wallowing in Wake
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
The Stanford Indians invited the Trojans from Southern Cal to
participate in a three race crew regatta last Saturday and then
proceeded to whip their guests in all three races.
It was a clean sweep for the Big Red as first the J.V., and then
the frosh and varsity boats, came swinging under the finish line

ahead of the Crimson and Gold. "
The most exciting race of the day
was the first one, involving the two
junior varsity boats. The duel, slat
ed to be the closest of the day, got
under way before most of the crowd
had settled along the banks of the
harbor. Southern Cal got off to a
blazing start and pulled out to a
half-length lead while the home
oicht, stroked by Skip Schumacher,
were content to follow the pre-racc
strategy of pacing themselves dur
ing the first half of the 2,000-metcr
distance.
TROJANS TIIUNG
The results of the strategy began
to show as the two shells came up to
the half-way mark. The Trojans
were stroking higher and were tir
ing. Meanwhile Schumacher took the J
beat up to .'52 and the Indian boat
began to pull even with its rivals
from the south.
As the crews came into sight of
the finish line Stanford had wrested
the lead away from the Trojans and
now it was evident that there was
no catching the high-flying Indians.
The short lead was extended to al
most a full boat length as the home
eight hit the finish at (5 minutes and
8 seconds. SC was clocked at 6 min
utes and 11 seconds.
The second event of the afternoon
pitted the Stanford freshman crew !
against the third Trojan varsity. The !
frosh were fresh from a convincing j
victory over the Oregon State jun
ior varsity eight and needed no en
couragement. After the first few
strokes the home boat, coxed by
little Bob Lyon, began to shoot
ahead and the Papooses saw to it
that the Trojans never got within
hailing distance thereafter.
VARSITY RACE
The main event of the bill of fare
was the concluding race between
the two varsity crews. Led by co- j
captains Rowd Davis and Dan Ay- i
rault, the Indian eight were pre
racc favorites on the basis of their
easy win over OSC two weeks ago. i
The duel got off to a close-enough j
start as the distance between the 1
two boats could be covered with the
proverbial blanket. At the one
quarter mark there was very little
to choose between the two shells.
By the time the half-way mark was
reached the Indian boat had estab
lished a small lead and was beating
out a smooth 29 strokes per minute.
At this point, cox Davis called for
a Big Ten and the surge went;
through the boat from stem to stern.
The die was cast as the winners put
more and more water between
themselves and the struggling Tro
jans. The lead was increased to a
lull length and then to lVa lengths
at the three-quarters mark.
The mild finishing sprint of the
Indian boat brought the winning
distance to nearly three full lengths
and it was evident to those who
stood on the banks and cheered as
co-captain Davis received his tradi
tional winner's dunking that, at long
last, the Indians have a powerhouse
on the water.
