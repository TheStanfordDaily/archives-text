"The imperative need of this nation at all times is the leadership
of the Uncommon Men or Women. .. . When we get sick, we want
an uncommon doctor. When we go to war we yearn for an un
common general or admiral. When we choose the president of a
university, we want an uncommon educator."
These words of Herbert Clark Hoover, the Grand Old Party's

"grand old man" and
most distinguished graduate, are a
highlight of one of his "Addresses
Upon the American Road, 1950-
1955," published today by the Stan
ford Press.
The single volume, seventh in a
series, contains all of Hoover's
speeches, official letters, press state
ments, and published articles from
the "Great Debate" speech of Dec.
20, 19. r )0, to his 80th birthday cele
bration's "Uncommon Man" speech
in lowa last summer.
WEALTH OF WISDOM
Not even the more ardent GOP
men will argue Hoover has always
been right, but one cannot deny that
the elder statesman has contributed
his wealth of wisdom and experi
ence to the nation through long
service and tireless devotion.
One prime example of Hoover's
achievements is represented in the
reports on the Second Reorganiza
tion Commission recommending liq
uidation of the Reconstruction Fi
nance Corporation, presented in full
in the- new book.
The RFC, proposed first during
1932 by the Hoover Administration,
was condemned by the Hoover Com
mission in 1951 for no longer serving
its purpose. It went out of existence
last .June.
The reports list. RFC loans out
standing as of June 1950. They in
clude $25,000 for a snake farm, $85,-
000 to the "Gold Front Bar," and
$172,000 to the Hollywood Stars
baseball team.
Other loans were to hotels, thea
ters, beauty parlors, pool halls, and
bowling alleys. This had all been
the evolutionary result of an organ
ization designed to aid business and
promote economic stability 20 years
ago.
VARIED SUBJECTS
Hoover's subject matter ranges
from internal to international in
scope, pausing briefly on such ton
ics as "A Discussion of Agricola's
De Re Motallica," "On Engineers,"
"How to Stay Young," and "On

r —
Boys' Clubs.'
Foreign policy is the major topic:
Hoover's support of an "Atlantic
frontier," favoring the abandoning
of continental European defense by
the United States; his belief that
"we should devote our overwhelm
ing productive power to air and na
val strength . . and his comment
in 1951 that "Japan, Formosa, and
the Philippines are vital links in our
j national security . . . We will need
retain much military strength in the
Pacific to protect those areas."
Contained in the volume is a sc
ries of Hoover addresses defending
j the position of the Republican party,
his famous speech to the 1052 GOP
j convention, an attack on federalized
j electric power, and the danger of
federal deficit.
PERSONAL SIDELIGHTS
But aside from politics and con
troversies, there is plenty of Hoo
ver, the man, reflected here: the hu
mor of "The City Versus Boys,"
; published in The Rotarian Maga
| zine in 1950: and the deep religious
j thought of "This I Believe."
All in all, "Addresses" represents
[ the thought-provoking products of
j a man who has distinguished himself
jas America's great statesman for
i many decades. A man who, like
J Winston Churchill, retains prolific
i expression and political wisdom in j
| advancing years.

ence to the nation through long
service and tireless devotion.
One prime example of Hoover's
achievements is represented in the
reports on the Second Reorganiza
tion Commission recommending liq
uidation of the Reconstruction Fi
nance Corporation, presented in full
in the- new book.
The RFC, proposed first during
1932 by the Hoover Administration,
was condemned by the Hoover Com
mission in 1951 for no longer serving
its purpose. It went out of existence
last .June.
The reports list. RFC loans out
standing as of June 1950. They in
clude $25,000 for a snake farm, $85,-
000 to the "Gold Front Bar," and
$172,000 to the Hollywood Stars
baseball team.
Other loans were to hotels, thea
ters, beauty parlors, pool halls, and
bowling alleys. This had all been
the evolutionary result of an organ
ization designed to aid business and
promote economic stability 20 years
ago.
VARIED SUBJECTS
Hoover's subject matter ranges
from internal to international in
scope, pausing briefly on such ton
ics as "A Discussion of Agricola's
De Re Motallica," "On Engineers,"
"How to Stay Young," and "On

r —
Boys' Clubs.'
Foreign policy is the major topic:
Hoover's support of an "Atlantic
frontier," favoring the abandoning
of continental European defense by
the United States; his belief that
"we should devote our overwhelm
ing productive power to air and na
val strength . . and his comment
in 1951 that "Japan, Formosa, and
the Philippines are vital links in our
j national security . . . We will need
retain much military strength in the
Pacific to protect those areas."
Contained in the volume is a sc
ries of Hoover addresses defending
j the position of the Republican party,
his famous speech to the 1052 GOP
j convention, an attack on federalized
j electric power, and the danger of
federal deficit.
PERSONAL SIDELIGHTS
But aside from politics and con
troversies, there is plenty of Hoo
ver, the man, reflected here: the hu
mor of "The City Versus Boys,"
; published in The Rotarian Maga
| zine in 1950: and the deep religious
j thought of "This I Believe."
All in all, "Addresses" represents
[ the thought-provoking products of
j a man who has distinguished himself
jas America's great statesman for
i many decades. A man who, like
J Winston Churchill, retains prolific
i expression and political wisdom in j
| advancing years.

—His book, "Addresses Upon the American Road,
published today
"The imperative need of this nation at all times is the leadership
of the Uncommon Men or Women. .. . When we get sick, we want
an uncommon doctor. When we go to war we yearn for an un
common general or admiral. When we choose the president of a
university, we want an uncommon educator."
These words of Herbert Clark Hoover, the Grand Old Party's

"grand old man" and
most distinguished graduate, are a
highlight of one of his "Addresses
Upon the American Road, 1950-
1955," published today by the Stan

The single volume, seventh in a
series, contains all of Hoover's
speeches, official letters, press state

the "Great Debate" speech of Dec.
20, 19. r )0, to his 80th birthday cele
bration's "Uncommon Man" speech
