The "Sentimental Journey" at

elaborate interior, and the music of
the "Band of Renown." Decorations
â–  will consist of flowers, including
flowers on the individual tables, a
large flower-covered fountain, and
other innovations.
Lcs Brown is known for "dance
able music," and last year was
named America's number one dance
band in all polls conducted by major
popular music magazines and major
disc jockey programs. Brown's pop
ularity dates back to his early days
at Duke University, where he led
the campus band. Brown says he
knew then that America loved to
listen to smooth music, so "I try to
play danceable as well as listcnable
music."
Brown appears weekly with the
Bob Hope Show, and is making the
trip from Los Angeles especially for
the prom.
