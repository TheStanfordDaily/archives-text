b a
rest home clarification
To the Editor:
The Dailj Fr •arried an editorial and a story
of a series on .h, ' alth Service. Personally, I feel,
too. that Stanford needs an infirmary apart from the
Hospital and certainly a new isolation hospital.
However, some of the information in the article is
quite incorrect.
Under the second heading in the article: "Rest
Homes"—it is stated that the buildings housing the
Rest H->mes are donated by the University. Actually,
the F Jcrc. Mothers' Club, which is legally incor
porated, owns the Women's Rest Home; it was willed
to Mothers' Club as of last year. The Men's Rest
Home is rented from the University by Mothers' Club
at a fairly substantial yearly rental.
The Health Service does pay the Rest Home Di
rectors, $G per day per student. Basic medicine is
furnished by the Health Service. If a student cannot
afford any special medicine required, Mothers' Club

will pay that. They also pay for all linen, laundry,
utilities, telephone, equipment, maintenance or re
placement, garden care—in short, all operating costs.
Further on in this paragraph, reference is made to
the 10 p.m. receiving deadline at the Rest Homes.
May I point out that they are Rest Homes, never in
tended for anything but convalescents. In their in
fancy they were just that, and they are never sup
posed to leceive contagiously or seriously ill stu
dents.
The Rest Homes have been one of Mothers' Club's
main projects, but during my three years as chair
man, it has seemed to me their operation is generally
not very well understood. During the Mothers'
Club's 31 years its activities have been, and are,
solely dedicated to the benefit of Stanford students.
We would appreciate an early clarification.
