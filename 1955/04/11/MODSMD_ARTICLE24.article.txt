"Angei and Sinner" (Boule do Suif). See Guy
de Maupassant's gay and bawdy short stories
about the Franco-Prussian donnybrook brought
to the screen through the miraculous patented
process of 16-rnm. sound projector. It's at 3:15
p.m. Tuesday in Cubberley movie hall.
* * *
The cream of the nation's erudite, Phi Beta
Kappa, will sponsor a night at the Tuesday
Evening Series in Mom Aud. The program
commemorates the key-toters' 50 years on
Quad. Harold W. Stoke, Dean of the Grad

Strength of the Nation—-A New Measure of Ed
ucation." But what does all this mean to me
in the existing world situation . . .
Wednesday evening tough hombre Merritt
Johnson and assorted hooligans begin a four
day en v at the Little Theater. It's the
Stanford PI. jers' production of the western
that has the whole East agog, "The Girl of the
Golden West." Adapted for the stage by Carle
ton E. Morse, the stage epic catches the ol' West
as the ol' timers remember way back when men
were men and women were women. A splen
did set-up. Hinging on notices the play will
be staged April 20-23, as well.
Spirit has been at a maximum the past few
days as students eagerly anticipate "The Big
Colloguium." Mathematicians from the Pro
tagoras to the Einstein Schools have been
sharpening their wits for the occasion. Dr.
Anne C. Davis, University of California, will
kick off festivities Thursday atternoon when
she lectures On the Arithmetic of Relation
Types," only one of the many facets of the

Stanford - Berkeley Colloguium in Logic and
Methodology.
The highlight of the week for all social pan
thers is the Junior Prom. Les Brown and his
organization cf renown will play at the stylish
Castlewood Country Club (ofttime scene of the
Senior Ball.) With Brown on the music and Jo
Ann Greer on the lyrics it should prove to be
one of the better group affairs of the season—
have tux, will travel.
On the athletic front the johnny-come-lately
Indian power hitters will face Cal Friday at
Berkeley and host Santa Clara in a twin bill in
the Sunken Diamond Saturday. Attendance
should pick up now that the Indians have one
eye on the CIBA pennant and the oth£r eye on
the ball.
The cindermen will host Occidental in the
home oval Saturday afternoon in an attempt to
snap their two-meet losing skein.
The Sabbath offers a religious theme in the
flicks' presentation of "I Confess." An evening
in the Teahouse of the Canadian Moon, a fright
ened killer, and a priest torn between secular
and spiritual allegiance enter into the fast
moving melodrama which gives top billing to
Monty Clift and Anne Baxter. Two UPA films
will be shown as an added attraction.

SLEEPER OF THE WEEK—For 4-H and green
thumb fanatics the Natural History Club has
spared no cost to import Dr. Jane Langenheim
from UC to lecture on "The Vegetation of West
ern Colorado and Concepts of the Plant Com
