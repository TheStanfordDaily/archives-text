# BEES TO RATS
## Public Health Service Keeps Campus Clean 
### RUTH WOLPE 
(The last of a series of articles on
Stanford licau i services.)

Bees at the Cellar, flies and
rodents, as well as food handl
ing and sewage disposal, are the
concern of the Stanford Public
Health Service.
The Public Health Service, housed I
on the third floor of Cubberley, is j
the local herdth department for the !
University. "It is responsible for
Stanford's environmental sanitation
and public health; it is not a clinical |
service like the student Health Serv
ice, although the two services work
together in such fields as commun
icable diseases.
The Public Health office is staffed
by a part-time director, two part
time student inspectprs, and a full
time public health nurse.
The director is appointed by the [
president of the University with the
approval of the Board of Trustees; |
he is responsible to the Public I
Health Committee, an administrative j
standing committee of the University '
Academic Council.
Mr. Louis Olsen, the director of the
Public Health Service, was formerly :
Public Health Officer for Palo Alto, i
He has held his present post since
October, li>s3. Miss Margaret Rias- j
setto, public health nurse, teaches I
a course in first aid each quarter in I
addition to her other duties.
CAMPUS SANITATION
Supervision of all University and ;
fraternity dining halls, of milk and '
water supplies, of sewage and gar-
bage disposal, of housing, and of j
general campus sanitation is the job j
of the Stanford Public Health Office. |
University public health is gov
erned by the state Health and Safe- j
ty Code and regulations promulgated
by the Board ol Trustees. These are |
carried out by the Public Health i
Service.
FOOD HANDLING
In addition to the supervision of*)
campus dining halls, the Public j
Health Office instructs dining hall ;
employees in proper food handling L
techniques. It is concerned with the ;
space requirements and sanitary fa- j
cilities of housing.
It requires that all milk used on
campus be pasteurized. This require- |
ment in the winter of 1902-03 would j
have averted the typhoid fever epi- |
demic at Stanford.
The story of the Public Health j
Service is a success story in reverse. [
The more successful the Service is, j
the less one hears about it.

University public health is gov
erned by the state Health and Safe- j
ty Code and regulations promulgated
by the Board ol Trustees. These are |
carried out by the Public Health i
Service.
FOOD HANDLING
In addition to the supervision of*)
campus dining halls, the Public j
Health Office instructs dining hall ;
employees in proper food handling L
techniques. It is concerned with the ;
space requirements and sanitary fa- j
cilities of housing.
It requires that all milk used on
campus be pasteurized. This require- |
ment in the winter of 1902-03 would j
have averted the typhoid fever epi- |
demic at Stanford.
The story of the Public Health j
Service is a success story in reverse. [
The more successful the Service is, j
the less one hears about it.

Bees at the Cellar, flies and
rodents, as well as food handl
ing and sewage disposal, are the
concern of the Stanford Public
Health Service.
The Public Health Service, housed I
on the third floor of Cubberley, is j
the local herdth department for the !
University. "It is responsible for
Stanford's environmental sanitation
and public health; it is not a clinical |
service like the student Health Serv
ice, although the two services work
together in such fields as commun
icable diseases.
The Public Health office is staffed
by a part-time director, two part
time student inspectprs, and a full
time public health nurse.
The director is appointed by the [
president of the University with the
approval of the Board of Trustees; |
he is responsible to the Public I
Health Committee, an administrative j
standing committee of the University '
Academic Council.
