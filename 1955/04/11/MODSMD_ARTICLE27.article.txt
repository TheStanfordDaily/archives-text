# Pagan Says Honor Code Is 'Valuable Institution'
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
What thoughts cone to a pro
fessor's mind when a discussion
of the Honor Code arises?
Economics Professor Elmer D. Fa
gan, who ha.-; served on the Stanford
faculty since 1928, _ hits niven this
issue quite a lot of thought and at
tempted to explain some of these
thoughts in a recent Daily inter
view.
In regard to the Stanford Honor
Code, which has undergone much
review and discussion in the recent
past, Dr. Fagan believe:; that the in
stitution works well, although not
completely without hitch.
Stressing that he strongly believes
the Honor Code to be one of the
most valuable institutions at Stan
ford, Fagan added that he feels that
it should be retained only if stu
dents want it and intend to uphold
it in every detail.
"I hope,'' Dr. Fagan said earnestly,
"that Stanford students fully appre
ciate the value of the Honor Code
in the development of individual in
tegrity and fairness."
Referring to the recent clarifica
tion of the Honor Code declaring
that exams be taken out of the
classroom only with the permission
of the instructor, Dr. Fagan re
marked that it is his contention that
the faculty should not be placed in
a position of policing the class, but
that the Honor Code should specify
clearly under what conditions stu
dents are to be granted permission
to leave the classroom.
"A half-way system of proctoring
exams and an honor system is inef
fective and bad," the economics pro
fessor said. "At the University of
Southern California, professors were
supposed to proctor their own ex

ams. I couldn't as I put myself on j
the same level as a student—l think
of myself as merely another student
with a little more training than the j
rest."
To a question regarding the value
of economics study to the individual,
Fagan quipped that he was not in
terested in training a "bunch of in- j
tellectual odd-balls."
"Its importance," he said serious- |
ly, "lies in the fact that it will help ]
the student in a democratic state to i
formulate more rational judgments." |
