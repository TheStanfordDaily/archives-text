### BILL NICHOLS DICK MANSFIELD 
Stanford's red-hot baseball team
scored its fifth straight victory Fri
day over a strong San Jose Stat?
team by a 12-0 score.
Ray Young and Walt Payne ;om
bined to hold the Spartans to two
hits, both of the scratch infield va
riety. Young pitched the first five
frames and walked only three. How
ever, these were all with two outs in
the second inning, and Young went
to three and none on the next batter
before finding the plate again for
three strikes. This was the closest
that the Staters came. Payne was
very impressive, walking none an J
striking out three.
Stanford took a commanding lead
in the second when Bob Evans cel
lared a double with one out. Four
singles, two walks, and five runs fol
lowed, as the Cards continued their
murderous attack of the last two
weeks.
Bob Evans highlighted a three
run fifth frame with a 425-foot in
side-the-park homer to left center.

The JV and frosh baseball teams
both saw action over the weekend.
Stories on these games will appear
in tomorrow's Daily.
The Braves will host the San
Jose State JV's this afternoon at
!t:l5 in the Sunken Diamond.

The jut-jawed junior collected three
of the Stanfords* 15 hits for the day.
Hits by subs Ron Murciel, Tom
Dandurand, and John Dito and
walks to regulars Rich Scramaglia
and Rudy Figueroa in the eighth
added three additional markers to
the Stanford total.
Tomorrow the Cards meet Salem
of the new Class B Northwest
league, and return to CIBA play on
Friday and Saturday with games
against Cal and Santa Clara.

Stanford's Base-hit Express, which
had theoretically fottenlup enough
steam (68 runs on 71 hits in the last
five games) to I <; utterly invincible,
ground to a dea I stop Saturday aft
ernoon.
Bercovich Furniture Company, a
semi-pro outfit from Oakland which
was supposed to roll over and play
dead, produced a very fine young
pitcher named Loyal B loxam and
neatly trimmed the Indians, 1 to 0,
at the Sunken Diamond.
Bloxam struck out 12 in the nine
inning tiff, giving up six hits, all but
one singles, and three walks. The
Bercovich boys could scrape together
only seven bingles oft three Stanford
pitchers, but three singles off Gil
Duncan in the sixth sufficed to send
Ernie White across the plate for the
visitors to give Bercovich the win
and Duncan and Stanford the loss.
Bercovich brought only ten men
along, but ten were plenty. Airtight
defensive ball helped Bloxam out of
his few jams. Stanford hitters, ap
parently none too eager to swing at
Bloxam's stuff, watched five third
strikes go by, swinging at — and
missing—seven others.
Stanford got runners to third in
the second and fourth, but couldn't
count them, as Bloxam bore down.
Save for the sixth, Indian pitchers
Ed Verdurmen, Duncan, and Dick
Jones stilled the furniture men fairly
handily.
Sid Hall dumped a blooper double
into left-centerfield in the third to
get Stanford's only extra-base blow.
Cleanup hitter Sid Harvey's hot
single to left with White on second
was the run-producer for the win
ners.
Bloxam, strong to the end, struck
out the side in the seventh and
whiffed the last two batters, pinch -
hitters Tom Murray and Ray Young,
in the ninth.
