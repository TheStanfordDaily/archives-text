THE
ALUMINUM INDUSTRY
WAS BORN ON
SMALLMAM
V In 1 888, the aluminum industry consisted of one company—
j located in an unimpressive little building on the east side of
0) S l\ tllC I Pittsburgh. It was called The Pittsburgh Reduction Company.
I he men of this company had real engineering abilities and
Mewed the work to be done with an imagineering eye. But
they were much more than that. They were pioneers . . .
leaders . . . men of vision.
A lot has happened since 1 888. The country ... the
company . . . and the industry have grown up. Ten new
territories have become states, for one thing. The total
industry now employs more than 1,000,000 people—
and the little outfit on Smallman Street? Well, it's a lot
bigger, too —and the name has been changed to Alcoa.
Aluminum Company or America . . . but it's still the
leader—still the place for engineering "firsts."
/v As you prepare to trade textbooks for a position in
industry, consider the advantages of joining a
dynamic company like Alcoa—for real job stability
jHm-- I and pleasant working conditions—where good
lit Ira men move up fast through their association with
|j reco & ' ea^ers i" 'he aluminum industry.
