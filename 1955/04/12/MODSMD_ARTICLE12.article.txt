# Flames Damage Professor's Home
## 
### 
The smelling of smoke by a nine
year-old girl averted what possibly
could have been a bad fire last night
at. the home of Konrad 13. Kraus
kopf, professor of geochemistry at
Stanford, who lives at 450 El Escar
pado, southwest of Lake Lagunita.
Professor Krauskopf's daughter
Marion smelled smoke coming from
the attic just before she went to bod
around 8:15. Opening the door to the
a tic, she was engulfed by a cloud of
smoke. She immediately called her
parents, who in turn called the Farm
fire department.
Upon their arrival, the firemen
found a mattress and part of a wall
badly smouldering in the corner of
the attic. The origin of the fire was
undetermined, pending investigation,
and damage was listed as slight.
