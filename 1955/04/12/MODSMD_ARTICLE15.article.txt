# Signals Replaced On Palm Drive
## 
### 
The "new" gave way to the "new
er" yesterday as a group of workers
removed two traffic signals from
their Palm Drive resting places to
make way for installation of combi
naion light and traffic signal poles.
The signals, which were never in
full operation, will be replaced with
a much taller light standard from
which a 15-foot arm will project
over the drive with a traffic signal
attached.
The "newer" lights will be placed
on the southwest and northeast cor
ners of the Embarcadero cutoff. Sig
nals on the other corners will remain
as before.
Richard C. Johnston, administra
tive assistant in the University busi
ness office, stated that the reason
for the new light standards is "to
avoid having separate poles—one for
lighting and one for traffic signals."
