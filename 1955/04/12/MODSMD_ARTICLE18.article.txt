The band first gained prominence
with their recording of "Sentimen
tal Journey" along with subsequent
hits such as "'l've Got My Love to
Keep Me Warm" and their recent
recordings with the Ames Brothers
on Coral Label which have kept the
men of the Les Brown organization

Stone, Dave Pell, Ray Simms, and
"Stumpy" Brown. The featured vo

to special numbers which turn the
spotlight on the vocalists within the
band. A presentation such as this
displays the arranging talents of
