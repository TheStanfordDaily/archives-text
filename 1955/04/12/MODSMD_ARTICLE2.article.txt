# Alvarado Row Closed by Ditch
## 
### 
Alvarado Row, which runs south
of Stern Hall, was closed to
through traffic yesterday as work
men dug a ditch through the road
to connect water lines.
The road is expected to be open
today according to Police Chief
Gordon Davis.
Arguello Road, which runs east
Of Stern, has been closed for a
couple of weeks because of con
struction work on Ray Lyman
Wilbur Hall and the Stern exten
sion.
Traffic was rerouted through
Engineering Comer yesterday in
order to prevent a noon-time bot
tleneck. That route will be closed
today between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.
as usual.
