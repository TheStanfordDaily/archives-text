# VISITING NIPPON PUBLISHER:
## 'Japan Faces Population Problem' 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Citing tho Japanese problem
1 of an cvor increasing population,
Frank Togasaki, publisher of the
| Tokyo Nippon Times, discussed
| the dilemmas facing the post-v/ar
j Japanese population before an
j informal gathering in Bowman
Alumni House yesterday after
noon.
"The population i.s the problem
from which nearly all of Japan's
other problems rise," the smiling
American - educated Japanese pub
lisher pointed out. He added that,
in a small country in which only 17
per cent, of the area is arable, there
are 80 million people, who produce
I a food supply which is 15 to 20 per
cent short every year.
A native of San Francisco and
graduate of the University of Cnli
fornia, Togasaki wa:; forced by the
1924 immigration law to return to
Japan because his Japanese - born
wife was not allowed to enter the
country.
Togasaki is participating in a pro-
J gram sponsored by Town Hall, Inc.,
ill N< w York which invited 12 men

from Asian and Near Eastern coun
tries in discuss Asian problems
throughout, the United States.
"Another problem facing the .Jap
anese people," Togasaki said, "is
that of the unavailability of basic
raw materials. Japan does possess
the technical know-how to profit
from a favorable exchange of
goods."
Although not directly answering j
a question concerning the state of:
health of Japancsc-Amcrican rela- i
tions, the Japanese publisher stated
that they "remain fundamentally the !
same as they were a few years ago."
"Although we hoped during the |
Utopian post-war years that there j
would be no need for rearmament," I
he pointed out, "we must now pre
pare to defend ourselves and assume !
our responsibility, not allowing the J
American taxpayer to assume the \
whole burden."
Although appearing to present the j
staunchly pro-American viewpoint
in Japan, Togasaki cited the fact i
that the Japanese trade balance is
still out of kilter, with imports far â– 
outweighing exports, and indicated |
that a termination of high American
tariffs could partially remedy the .
problem. '
