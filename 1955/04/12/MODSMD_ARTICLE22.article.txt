# Lake Lag Level Dropping Steadily
## 
### 

SUN SHINES DOWN, TIDE GOES OUT—Folks sit around while the water trickles out. Lako
Lag, at a level of four feet under last year's level at the same time, faces extinction unless the
rains come and replenish its dwindling content. In the meantime, wouldbe canoers sit helplessly
and watch the level drop. If the weather stays sunny, the lake will be down to rock bottom be
fore the quarter ends. Water cannot be pumped into the lake as it was last year because the dam
leaks. —Daily photo by Ken Green
