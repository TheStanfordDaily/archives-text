## 
### JOHN McFEE 
A major revision in the judicial set-up of the Interfraternity
Council was passed by the IFC recently. The change involves the
transfer of all judicial power from the entire council to an eight
member Judicial Committee.
The Judicial Committee will be able to meet on instant summons

♦to deal with violations as they may
arise. #
The new committee will consist of
the IFC president, the secretary
treasurer, the head resident assist
ant, chairman of the House Mana
gers 1 Association, Chief Counselor
for Men Richard L. Balch, and three
elected members of IFC.
Formerly all violations were re
viewed first by a four-man commit
tee, which was simply to study and
present the facts of each case with
no recommendation. The entire
council of house presidents made the
decision.
The IFC felt thai the whole body
was tot) large and unwieldy to han
dle a case effectively. The council
also felt that it took too long when
the four-man committee investigat
ed and reported, and then the coun
cil had to meet and deliberate.
"The now system will function,"
Otis Winters, IFC president, com
mented. "A smaller body will be
able to meet immediately and hand
down its decision before any ad
verse publicity leaks out.' 1 .
The head resident assistant and the
chairman of the House Managers'
Association were included in the
