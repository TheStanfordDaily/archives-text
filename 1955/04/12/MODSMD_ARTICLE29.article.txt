## "call it stupid" 
### 
To the Editor:
The 10 of the Stanford student individually may be
quite hi h. The IQ of the Stanford student body en
masse is somewhere around the level of a low grade
moron.
Last Surdity night, Easter Sunday ... a day which
should be dedk to Christian belief, if no other
day is ... a rncvie was shown at the Sunday Evening
Flicks. It was "The Jazz Singer."
The picture dealt with a singer who decided to make
show business his career rather than sing, as his father
had done before him, in the Jewish temple. Many
sacred prayers . . . including the Jews' most sacred,
the Kadish . . . were greeted with catcalls, and other

responses indicative of Stanford's Christian attitude
towards things strange to them.
It could be called disgraceful. I don't think it was.
I'd prefer to call it stupid ... rankly stupid. Something
that Stanford is not supposed to engender.
I myself am not overly religious, but when I see
something I don't approve of. or appreciate, or under
stand in other religions I do not react with blasphemous
catcalling. I am sure most of us, in our sane moments,
would not razz the Lord's Prayer. Because something
similar to the Lord's Prayer was shown, but in Hebrew
rather than English, is no reason to act otherwise.
