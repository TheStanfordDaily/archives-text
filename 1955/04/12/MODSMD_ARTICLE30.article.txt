Baseball and women.
V/hat a combination. It seems like only yes
terday that I was rather unsuccessfully com
bining the two. I say unsuccessfully because
.. .. But I'm getting ahead of myself (real writ
er's type phrase).
In the deep dark past of my days in what is
affectionately called "the bus (usually broken
down) leagues" in the bushes of baseball I
ones made a decision. Baseball and women.
You see, there was a sweet young thing who
liked baseball. Especially baseball players.
And I liked women. Especially those who liked
baseball. So much in common. How couid I
fail. But I did.
She was a real fan. Clear weather or foul,
win or lose; I'd look up into the (ha) crowd and
there she'd be. Lovely. And interested in a
baseball player. Me.
I guess you know that the object in the grand
old game r; to, quote, keep your eye on the
ball, unquoU . Again I worked a combination.
One eye on the ball, one eye on the young
lady. It got so my teammates started calling
me "One-Eye." Better than what they'd called
me before. Never could understand why they
called me those names anyway.
This eye trick worked great. I was happy.
She was happy. My team was happy. But then

the wrong team started getting happyâ€”and
then even happier.
And why?
My number one fan had given up her former
practice of sitting on the first base side of the
stands and had moved to behind-the-plate. A
bad move. Bad because I was playing the out
field at the time and since she was now farther
away than ever I played as close to the infield
as possible to keep a better eye on my beloved.
Fine. But not so fine when the hits started
flyin' over my head.
And at the plate. Well, I kept lookin' round
at her. While I was lpokin' the dirty guys
pitchin' would sneak 'em up on me. 1 was trad
ed- -to The Daily.
And here I am getting myself in shape for
the world series of the publications; The Daily
vs. The Chaparral. But I'll do all right. The
current light of my life is playing first base and
since I'm in the infield now I can't miss. I know,
but she hits better than anyone else on the
team.
For those of you who don't know from
nothin' 'bout baseball, just take my word .for
it. I know. Baseball and women. The losing
combination.
Unless you want to end up with The Daily
nine.
