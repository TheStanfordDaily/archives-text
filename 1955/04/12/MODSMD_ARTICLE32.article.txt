# Coed Swimmer Lauds Spirit Shown in Pan-Am Competition
## U.S. Domination Not Resented 
### EDA MENDELS 
"The spirit and fellowship, the
competition and sportsman
ship."
That, said Sally Phillips, was
the best part of the recent Pan-
American games.
Miss Phillips, Stanford junior,
traveled to Mexico City to partici
pate in those games as a member
of the United States synchronized
swimming team.
"We met some wonderful people.
There were very good feelings
among all athletes of all nations," she
elaborated. She noticed absolutely
no resentment of the U.S.'s over
whelming victories in the competi
tion.
The Pan-American games, hold
every four years a year prior to the
Olympics, were held in Mexico
City's new University City. "It was
just gorgeous," Miss Phillips re
membered enthusiastically. "There
are ultra - modern buildings, with
colorful murals and mosaics. Our
dorm looked like the U.N. building.
It was beautifully built, though not
really well built."
WOMEN'S DORM
Women athletes from all the par
ticipating nations lived in that dorm
together. They all 'ate together too,
partaking of the same food, which
was prepared by Mexican cooks un
der American supervision.
She and her teammates flew to
Mexico City on March 11. After a
few easy days to get used to the al
titude they began training. Some
times they practiced in the Univer
sity City pool, which Miss Phillips
termed "the hugest I've ever seen."
It was a spectacular pool, with rac
ing lanes, bridges, diving tower, and
a peninsula.
Actually the group had been prac

ticing since last November. They
were selected to represent the U.S.
in synchronized swimming at try
outs in Utah last January, and they
have kept a busy rehearsal sched
ule sines then.

In Mexico City, the team trained
twice a day, two hours in the morn- I
ing and another hour and a half each
afternoon.
"Our contest was on March 25, the
last day of competition. Because of
our training we did not see many |
other events. We did watch Wes
San tee run and saw other swimming
and diving competitions."
TIIKEE ENTRIES
Miss Phillips explained that this
was the first time .synchronized 1
swimming had been represented in
the Pan - American games. Three
countries entered teams, and the
American team won. Mexico was J
second, and Canada came in third.
"There were five girls on our '
team," Miss Phillips told, "four on
the Mexican team, and 12 in the Ca
nadian group. Our number was
"Sacrificial Kites of the Aztecs,"
suitable for Mexico and done to
Mexican music.
"We had one of our biggest thrills
when we were awarded our medals
in the big ceremony in the stadium.
The band played the "Star Spangled
Banner" and they raised the Ameri
can flag on the stand behind us. We
had permanent smiles fixed on our
faces. We couldn't get them off, we
were so excited."
THE EXPENSES
The Olympics Committee paid for
the delegates to the Pan-American
games. They provided each partici
pant with u complete uniform,
swimsuits, sweatsuit, jewelry, un
derwear, handkerchiefs—every con
ceivable item of clothing.
Each athlete got a handful of
"USA" pins, and participants from
the other countries had their em- i
blems, which the players exchanged
among themselves, trying to build
up a collection. "Bargain time," Miss
Phillips laughed.

the best part of the recent Pan-
American games.
Miss Phillips, Stanford junior,
traveled to Mexico City to partici
pate in those games as a member
of the United States synchronized
swimming team.
"We met some wonderful people.
There were very good feelings
among all athletes of all nations," she
elaborated. She noticed absolutely
no resentment of the U.S.'s over
whelming victories in the competi
tion.
The Pan-American games, hold
every four years a year prior to the
Olympics, were held in Mexico
City's new University City. "It was
just gorgeous," Miss Phillips re
membered enthusiastically. "There
are ultra - modern buildings, with
colorful murals and mosaics. Our
dorm looked like the U.N. building.
It was beautifully built, though not
really well built."
WOMEN'S DORM
Women athletes from all the par
ticipating nations lived in that dorm
together. They all 'ate together too,
partaking of the same food, which
was prepared by Mexican cooks un
der American supervision.
She and her teammates flew to
Mexico City on March 11. After a
few easy days to get used to the al
titude they began training. Some
times they practiced in the Univer
sity City pool, which Miss Phillips
termed "the hugest I've ever seen."
It was a spectacular pool, with rac
ing lanes, bridges, diving tower, and
a peninsula.
Actually the group had been prac

ticing since last November. They
were selected to represent the U.S.
in synchronized swimming at try
outs in Utah last January, and they
have kept a busy rehearsal sched
ule sines then.

In Mexico City, the team trained
twice a day, two hours in the morn- I
ing and another hour and a half each
afternoon.
"Our contest was on March 25, the
last day of competition. Because of
our training we did not see many |
other events. We did watch Wes
San tee run and saw other swimming
and diving competitions."
TIIKEE ENTRIES
Miss Phillips explained that this
was the first time .synchronized 1
swimming had been represented in
the Pan - American games. Three
countries entered teams, and the
American team won. Mexico was J
second, and Canada came in third.
"There were five girls on our '
team," Miss Phillips told, "four on
the Mexican team, and 12 in the Ca
nadian group. Our number was
"Sacrificial Kites of the Aztecs,"
suitable for Mexico and done to
Mexican music.
"We had one of our biggest thrills
when we were awarded our medals
in the big ceremony in the stadium.
The band played the "Star Spangled
Banner" and they raised the Ameri
can flag on the stand behind us. We
had permanent smiles fixed on our
faces. We couldn't get them off, we
were so excited."
THE EXPENSES
The Olympics Committee paid for
the delegates to the Pan-American
games. They provided each partici
pant with u complete uniform,
swimsuits, sweatsuit, jewelry, un
derwear, handkerchiefs—every con
ceivable item of clothing.
Each athlete got a handful of
"USA" pins, and participants from
the other countries had their em- i
blems, which the players exchanged
among themselves, trying to build
up a collection. "Bargain time," Miss
Phillips laughed.
