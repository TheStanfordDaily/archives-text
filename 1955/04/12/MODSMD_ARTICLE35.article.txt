Baseball is officially with us now. The coast league lias been playing lor
a week now, and Stanford's season is well underway, but it doesn't really I
.-etui official until the majors yet going. President Eisenhower ushered in I

the horsehidei's as he threw out the
first ball at Washington yesterday.
Lasi year Ike almost played goll in
preference to doing the honors, but
this season, we are happy to report,
he accepted with alacrity, Clark
Griffith's ofler to continue a tradition
which dates back to when William
II. Tuft was President.
Stanford will he no better repre
sentee! this year th in last in the big
leagues.. Ray Swarts, given an out
side chance to .stick with Pittsburgh
this spring alter a .385 year at
Phoenix, was optioned to the New
Orleans Pelicans of the Southern
Association. This leaves only Jack
Sheparel and Lloyd Merriman as In
dian representatives in the East.
»,K itc >:«
Trying to pick final standings is
a dubious blessing at best, especially
for the Daily since a quick look at
last year's predictions show alarm
ing inaccuracies. However, this

Spring, it looks as if they should finish this way next Fall:

national league
Milwaukee
New Yol k
Brooklyn
St. Louis
Cincinatti
Philadelphia
Pittsburgh
Chicago

american league
Cleveland
New York
Chicago
Boston
Detroit
Washington
Baltimore
Kansas City

Milwaukee has a solid Bobby Thomson this year, and was the hottest j
team in the league at the close of last September. The Giants didn't get i
anybody new, and many of last year's come-through performers must come
through again. Sal Maglie is nearing the end, neither Don Mueller nor
Willie Mays ever did as well as they did last, season. Mays probably has I
what it takes. Mueller's .340 mark will probably slump.
Brooklyn should pick up a little now that Roy Campanella can hold a I
bat again, but the infield, except for first is not too strong. St. Louis is a |
gamble for fourth place, and Cineinatti might easily nose them out, but 5
the Cards got two top rookies, Ken Boyer and Bill Virdon who are counted
on to plug first and third base weaknesses, and the pitching can't help
but improve.
$ $ :J?
Cleveland picked up lefty pitcher Herb Score, and the Yankees are
still looking for a replacement lor the Super Chief, Allie Reynolds. That
should be enough to keep the Indians on top again. Cleveland was shaken
by the Dusty Rhodes debacle last October, but back in a league where
there are live second division teams to beat, they should recover.
The Yankees are still trying to figure out what they got in the big trade

with Baltimore. Stengel has already
' announced that decrepit Phil Riz
-1 zuto will open at shortstop in place
j of Bill Hunter, who was supposed
to be one of the key men in the
trade.
Chicago's White Sox lost one of
: the best managers in baseball when
j Paul Richards left for Baltimore, but
1 they still have Billy Pierce and Min
nie Minoso. The tremendous "Go-
Go-Sox" spirit of a few years back
| has died down, but the south-siders
i are still a solid team. Boston, De
-1 troit, and Washington will battle for
j the remaining first division spot
with the Red Sox, a fast-improving j
j team, having the edge.

Milwaukee has a solid Bobby Thomson this year, and was the hottest j
team in the league at the close of last September. The Giants didn't get i
anybody new, and many of last year's come-through performers must come
through again. Sal Maglie is nearing the end, neither Don Mueller nor
Willie Mays ever did as well as they did last, season. Mays probably has I
what it takes. Mueller's .340 mark will probably slump.
Brooklyn should pick up a little now that Roy Campanella can hold a I
bat again, but the infield, except for first is not too strong. St. Louis is a |
gamble for fourth place, and Cineinatti might easily nose them out, but 5
the Cards got two top rookies, Ken Boyer and Bill Virdon who are counted
on to plug first and third base weaknesses, and the pitching can't help
but improve.
$ $ :J?
Cleveland picked up lefty pitcher Herb Score, and the Yankees are
still looking for a replacement lor the Super Chief, Allie Reynolds. That
should be enough to keep the Indians on top again. Cleveland was shaken
by the Dusty Rhodes debacle last October, but back in a league where
there are live second division teams to beat, they should recover.
The Yankees are still trying to figure out what they got in the big trade

with Baltimore. Stengel has already
' announced that decrepit Phil Riz
-1 zuto will open at shortstop in place
j of Bill Hunter, who was supposed
to be one of the key men in the
trade.
Chicago's White Sox lost one of
: the best managers in baseball when
j Paul Richards left for Baltimore, but
1 they still have Billy Pierce and Min
nie Minoso. The tremendous "Go-
Go-Sox" spirit of a few years back
| has died down, but the south-siders
i are still a solid team. Boston, De

j the remaining first division spot
with the Red Sox, a fast-improving j
