# Zetes Face Sigma Chi's In Finals
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
The long intramural basketball
season comes to an end tomorrow
night when the Zetes play the Sig
ma Chi five to determine the Uni
versity championship.
Last night's semi-faials found both
of these quintets on the long end of
31-25 and 51-jj scores. The Zetes
found tough competition in the
scrappy Encina 2E squad but finally
increased their skimpy half-time
lead of two points to ice the contest
in the final minutes.
SIGMA CHI'S WIN
The second game of the night be
tween the Sigma Chi's and the out
classed Biz School was decided, for
all practical purposes, in the first
half when Ken Seese poured 10
points through the hoop to spark the
winners to a 23-10 half-time lead.
Seese wound up the evening with 17
points, good enough for high point
honors.
Other high scorers of the evening
were Paul Perko and Stan Smith of
the powerful Sigma Chi five, who
scored 11 and 9 points respectively.
Duane Baker of the Encina club
garnered 0 points while Steve Hor
rell of the Zetes connected for 8.
Wally Oates, who spends his springs
running for Coach Ray Dean's frosh
track squad, followed Baker with 5
points.
