### LARRY JENSEN 
The Stanford Braves continued
their winning ways with a 9-7
victory over the San Jose State
JVs yesterday on the Sunken
Diamond. The game was a
loosely played encounter with
the teams coming up with nine
errors between them.
Both teams scored once in the first
inning but the Braves jumped all over
Spartan pitcher Tony Chrisco for four
runs in the second. Ron Marciel
singled, stole second and scored when
the San Jo.se shortstop couldn't find
the handle on Pete Reynold's ground
er.
Chrisco then walked Card pitcher
Don Petters and gave up a single to
Bob Fisher to load the bases. Bob
Gergen lined a single to left to score
Reynolds and Petters and John Dito
mopped up by singling in Fisher.
CLOSE SCORE
Spartan Jack Anderson doubled in
two San Jose runs in the third in
ning to close the score to 5-3 but the
Cards didn't stick around long. In
the bottom of the fifth the Stanfords
checked in with three runs as San
Jose came up with a comedy routine
worthy of A1 Schacht.
Dale Metcalf and Ray Looney start
ed the festivities by drawing walks
off Chtisco. Bob Benneett then hit to
the San Jose shortstop who proceed
ed to throw over the first baseman's
head. By the time the first sacker
retrieved the ball, Metcalf and Loon
ey had crossed the plate and Bennett
was steaming for third. Aforemen
tioned first sacker, in his attempt to
nail Bennett, threw over the third
baseman's head'and Bennett came on
in to complete his inside-the-infield
"homer."

The Stanford Braves continued
their winning ways with a 9-7
victory over the San Jose State
JVs yesterday on the Sunken
Diamond. The game was a
loosely played encounter with
the teams coming up with nine
errors between them.
Both teams scored once in the first
inning but the Braves jumped all over
Spartan pitcher Tony Chrisco for four
runs in the second. Ron Marciel
singled, stole second and scored when
the San Jo.se shortstop couldn't find
the handle on Pete Reynold's ground
er.
Chrisco then walked Card pitcher
Don Petters and gave up a single to
Bob Fisher to load the bases. Bob
Gergen lined a single to left to score
Reynolds and Petters and John Dito
mopped up by singling in Fisher.
CLOSE SCORE
Spartan Jack Anderson doubled in
two San Jose runs in the third in
ning to close the score to 5-3 but the
Cards didn't stick around long. In
the bottom of the fifth the Stanfords
checked in with three runs as San
Jose came up with a comedy routine
worthy of A1 Schacht.
Dale Metcalf and Ray Looney start
ed the festivities by drawing walks
off Chtisco. Bob Benneett then hit to
the San Jose shortstop who proceed
ed to throw over the first baseman's
head. By the time the first sacker
retrieved the ball, Metcalf and Loon
ey had crossed the plate and Bennett
was steaming for third. Aforemen
tioned first sacker, in his attempt to
nail Bennett, threw over the third
baseman's head'and Bennett came on
in to complete his inside-the-infield
"homer."

sixth with a four run splurge. The
Spartans connected for two doubles
and a single and were aided by two
walks and Marciel'.s error in center
field.

The Stanford Braves continued
their winning ways with a 9-7
victory over the San Jose State
JVs yesterday on the Sunken
Diamond. The game was a
loosely played encounter with
the teams coming up with nine
errors between them.
Both teams scored once in the first
inning but the Braves jumped all over
Spartan pitcher Tony Chrisco for four
runs in the second. Ron Marciel
singled, stole second and scored when
the San Jo.se shortstop couldn't find
the handle on Pete Reynold's ground
er.
Chrisco then walked Card pitcher
Don Petters and gave up a single to
Bob Fisher to load the bases. Bob
Gergen lined a single to left to score
Reynolds and Petters and John Dito
mopped up by singling in Fisher.
CLOSE SCORE
Spartan Jack Anderson doubled in
two San Jose runs in the third in
ning to close the score to 5-3 but the
Cards didn't stick around long. In
the bottom of the fifth the Stanfords
checked in with three runs as San
Jose came up with a comedy routine
worthy of A1 Schacht.
Dale Metcalf and Ray Looney start
ed the festivities by drawing walks
off Chtisco. Bob Benneett then hit to
the San Jose shortstop who proceed
ed to throw over the first baseman's
head. By the time the first sacker
retrieved the ball, Metcalf and Loon
ey had crossed the plate and Bennett
was steaming for third. Aforemen
tioned first sacker, in his attempt to
nail Bennett, threw over the third
baseman's head'and Bennett came on
in to complete his inside-the-infield
"homer."
SAX JOSE RALLY
San Jose almost tied the score in the
sixth with a four run splurge. The
Spartans connected for two doubles
and a single and were aided by two
walks and Marciel'.s error in center
field.
The Cards got the game's final run
in the seventh as Marciel walked,
stole second, and rode in on Bennett's
double.
Marciel proved to be the big burg
lar ot the aiternoon. He pilfered four
bases and made several fine catches
in center.
