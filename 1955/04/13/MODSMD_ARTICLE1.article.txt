# 'Girl of the Golden West' Will Open Run Tonight
## Melodrama Begins at 8:15 
### 
Tonight at 8:15 in the Little
Theater the Stanford Players!
will open their first week of Da
vid Belasco's "Girl of the Gold
en West." The show, which
stars Merritt Johnson, Judith
Doty, and Thomas Luce, plays j
through Saturday, and Wednes
day through Saturday of next
week.
Betaseo gathered material for his
melodrama of the Old West while
traveling as an itinerant actor
through the mining camps of Cali
fornia and Nevada.
The play deals with the efforts of
"the Girl," proprietor of the Polka
Saloon, dance hall, and gambling
parlor, to save her lovei, Dick John
son, from the clutches of Sheriff
.Jack Ranee, an embittered cx-ad
mirer.
FRONTIER TYPES
Belasco's frontier types—the min
ers, gamblers, Indians, Mexicans,
road - agents, camp minstrels, and
law men—have passed into legend.
First produced in 1905 with a cast
including such notable stars as
Blanche Bates, Robert Milliard, and
Frank Keenan, the play was hailed
I>.v critics as "a lusciously atmosphe
ric token of David Belasco's intrepid
dramatic spirit," "a rare combina
tion throbbing realism and imagi
native poetry."
Puccini took the play a.s the basis
foi his opera of the same name,
wli.ch opened at the Metropolitan
conducted by Arturo Toscanini and
starring Enrico Caruso as Dick j
Johnson.
REVIVED !M VNV TIMES
Although "Girl of the Golden
YVo. t has been revived many times i
in I.!;' p.- -I half-century, the Way- j
m s production is the first in the Bay
Area for over a decade.
"Too many amateur groups," said |
director Douglas Cook, "look at an j
old play only as something to ridi- 1
culo. "Let's see how foolish we can j
m; Ice it look.' That isn't our idea, i
' Melodrama is distinguished by |
its exaggerated and exciting situa- j
lions, its scenes of spectacle and
su.spen.se, its usC of music and of ro- !
man tic characters."
"This," he .said, "is what we want
to get. We want to recapture the !
mood of the show as it must have |
been 50 years ago: a mixture of j
laughter and tears that deserves to
be heard on its own terms."
A few tickets are still available for j
SI at the Memorial Hall box office \
from I2:."0 to L3O p.m.
