The frog hunt is on.
From Stern Hall has leap* the
news that a group of ten frog ex
perts from Wing Three has V;uc
ceeded in its quest for "the best
frogs ever to represent an organi
zation in jumping frog competi
tion."
Mark Deez, who is captain of
the 'Stern Hall Frog-Jumping
Team," says that the three frogs
which his team has found at a
secret site are "the best.there are."
The team plans to enter its three
jumpers in the Calaveras Jumping
Frog Jubilee at Angel's Camp in
intercollegiate competition and
fully expects to "bring home the
bacon" for Stanford.
"NUMBER ONE"
Number one frog in the entry is
"Cockamoon," who at present is
being scientifically trained at a
location known only to his train
ers. who are constantly on the
look-out for "spies" and scouts
from other college groups who
may want to get a line on the fu
ture champs' jumping secrets. It's
even rumored that the University

of California plans to enter into
competition with Stanford's
greenbacks.
"They don't stand a ghost of a
chance," was Decz's comment on
hearing this news. He claims that
his group with its scientific train
ing methods are certain to come
up with a winner in "Cockamoon."
TRAINING
Head trainer is Nils Nilsson who
is also bringing along the other
two entries at their own speed.
The two frogs, "Jack Squat" and
"Warren G. Wonka" prefer to
pace themselves rather than en
gage in the intensive training that
"Cockamoon" is undergoing.
The sponsoring realizes
that there may be other Stanford
frogs disputing the right of their
entries to represent the Farm at
Angel's Camp but they are, in the
words of Deez, "ready and will
ing to challenge any and all frogs;
for our three are the best."
In fact. Deez and his compan
ions have issued a frog-jumping
challenge to the campus ;4 large.
Is there a frog in the house?
