# NEW CONSTITUTION
## Winters Calls Revision 'Great Improvement' 
### JOHN McFEE 
"A student government split into three distinct departments—
Executive, Legislative, Judicial—as exists in the proposed ASSU
Constitution, would be a great improvement over the present set
up," said Otis Winters, outgoing IFC president, last night.
"A system of checks and balances with a separate Cabinet and

Legislature is far superior to the
present combination of legislative
and executive functions in one Ex
ecutive Committee.'"
Under the new constitution the
cabinet will consist of the presidents
of the larger campus organizations,
boards, and judicial councils, while
the legislature will include repre
sentatives from the living areas.
"The cabinet would be an excel
lent co-ordinating board," continued
Winters, "and through the legislature
plans can be voted on by elected
representatives of the student body
rather than by presidents of organi
zations.
"I also favor the increased mem
bership of the legislature. Under
the new system, the representation
will be more equal than before."
If the constitution referendum is
passed, the Interfraternity Council
will be represented on the Cabinet
by its president and will have two
men in the legislature, instead of
one as it is now. In addition, the
IFC Judicial Committee will be one
of the inferior councils under the
ASSU Judicial Council and its pow
ers could be expanded by the legis
lature directly instead of by student
vote as at present.
"By being a part of the cabinet,
legislature, and the Judicial Coun
cil," said Winters, "IFC definitely
establishes itself as an integral part
of the University and not. simply
a board running its own affairs on
the Row. I think it is good to have
the IFC recognized and represented
in the overall campus picture."
