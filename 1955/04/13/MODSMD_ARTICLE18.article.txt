The Interfraternity. Council
last night discussed resolutions
passed by the Encina Executive
Committee Sunday, one of
which states that "no fraternity
or eating club men shall be per
mitted within Encina for retails
tory or other malicious action."
The other rule says that, no ft.<-
ternity or eating club property $hall
be permitted within Encina,'' viola -
tors - being subject to a minimum
sentence oi 10 Con Home hours. As
of last night the same regulations
were passed by the Frosh Village
Excom and will apply to the fresh
man dormitories of the Village n
well as Encina.
In going over these two regul.i
tions, the IFC made the following
statement: "'ln considering the reg
ulations passed by the Encina Ex
com, the IFC recognizes the merit
of these regulations. However, the
IFC wishes to remind the pledges of
the responsibility their regulation;
plaec on them. In addition, the IFC
requests that traditional activil
of the fraternities to be carried on
by the actives and pledges of th<
particular fraternity only."
Presented to the council by Head
Encina Sponsor Fred Aurel, these
new rules arose as a result of inci
dents on the part of two fraternities
trying to retaliate for pledge sneak
last weekend. During Saturday and
Sunday nights, several Encina
phones were damaged and some
property of Encina resident.*, even
those not belonging to a house, wa.>
taken away by fraternity men.
"There is a great spirit, in the
Class of '58 in Encina," said Aurel,
"and last quarter pacts for Encina
men to stick together against any
fraternity raids were drawn up in
many of the wings." Consequently
on Sunday night close to 70 fresh
men, fraternity and non-fraternity
men alike, rallied together and
closed in on the Chi Psi house "for
what might have been a brawl with
great danger to lives and property
if there had been more than just a
few actives on the scene."
"In order to protect the property
and rights of Encina men the first of
these resolutions was passed," went
on Aurel. "At the same time, how
ever, it was felt that the freshmen
should meet the fraternities half
way and not create a haven for the
frosh to hide fraternity property in
Encina, and so the second rule was
put into effect."
Fraternity and eating club men
are still free to enter Encina and
frosh Village buildings, but if there
is any scuffling for retaliatory put -
poses, the fraternity men respon
sible will be subject to IFC disci
pline. Aurel assured the house pres
idents last night that the resident,
advisers and sponsors will make
certain that no fraternity property
is inside Village or Encina rooms.

taken away by fraternity men.
"There is a great spirit, in the
Class of '58 in Encina," said Aurel,
"and last quarter pacts for Encina
men to stick together against any
fraternity raids were drawn up in
many of the wings." Consequently
on Sunday night close to 70 fresh
men, fraternity and non-fraternity
men alike, rallied together and
closed in on the Chi Psi house "for
what might have been a brawl with
great danger to lives and property
if there had been more than just a
few actives on the scene."
"In order to protect the property
and rights of Encina men the first of
these resolutions was passed," went
on Aurel. "At the same time, how
ever, it was felt that the freshmen
should meet the fraternities half
way and not create a haven for the
frosh to hide fraternity property in
Encina, and so the second rule was
put into effect."
Fraternity and eating club men
are still free to enter Encina and
frosh Village buildings, but if there
is any scuffling for retaliatory put -
poses, the fraternity men respon
sible will be subject to IFC disci
pline. Aurel assured the house pres
idents last night that the resident,
advisers and sponsors will make
certain that no fraternity property
is inside Village or Encina rooms.
The Interfraternity. Council
last night discussed resolutions
passed by the Encina Executive
Committee Sunday, one of
which states that "no fraternity
or eating club men shall be per
mitted within Encina for retails
tory or other malicious action."
The other rule says that, no ft.<-
ternity or eating club property $hall
be permitted within Encina,'' viola -
tors - being subject to a minimum
sentence oi 10 Con Home hours. As
of last night the same regulations
were passed by the Frosh Village
Excom and will apply to the fresh
man dormitories of the Village n
well as Encina.
In going over these two regul.i
tions, the IFC made the following
statement: "'ln considering the reg
ulations passed by the Encina Ex
com, the IFC recognizes the merit
of these regulations. However, the
IFC wishes to remind the pledges of
the responsibility their regulation;
plaec on them. In addition, the IFC
requests that traditional activil
of the fraternities to be carried on
by the actives and pledges of th<
particular fraternity only."
Presented to the council by Head
Encina Sponsor Fred Aurel, these
new rules arose as a result of inci
dents on the part of two fraternities
trying to retaliate for pledge sneak
last weekend. During Saturday and
Sunday nights, several Encina
phones were damaged and some
property of Encina resident.*, even
those not belonging to a house, wa.>
taken away by fraternity men.
