The proposed new ASSU Constitution con
tinues to monopolize the agenda at Excom; dis
cussion tonight al the regular weekly meeting
will center around last changes in the docu
ment befoie it goes to the student body in
referendum next Tuesday and Wednesday.
Constitution - correction will necessarily head
the agenda since any corrections must be fin
ished in time to appear, according to require
ment of the present constitution, in tomorrow's
Daily. The entire old and new constitutions
must be print&d 'wice in The Daily; the second

Excom members will report on the progress
of constitution discussions in living groups be
ginning last week. The proposed new docu
ment, which would completely revamp the As
soc.' J Students structure, has been present
ed to living group and class meetings by mem
bers of Excom in an attempt to clarify some of
the changes proposed. Of greatest interest has
been the proposed changeover to a legislature
with more evenly-distributed representation.
The role of the cabinet and the status oi
boards which will be represented on it have

brought questions to Excom; continued work i
on by-laws for the proposed constitution must
take up the matter of possible boards and com
missions. The tryout period for many organi
zations has begun, putting the pressure on Ex
com to let these groups know what their status
is likely to be under the proposed constitution.,
The standard argument of most small groups
which have accosted Excom so far has been,)
"We're impoitant enough to be a board! Why
aren't we a board?" . . . although groups such
as Fundamental Standard Committee have ex- j
pressed a desire to be regarded as commis- J
sions under the proposed constitution. All this j
falls into the category of by-law revision, which 1
Excom began last week and will probably con
tinue tonight.
Also on the agenda is further discussion on
Students' Organizations Fund problems which
was firsi brought up last week in regard to 1IR.
Excom spokesmen indicate a series of execu
tive sessions with the organizations involved
has helped clear up Ihe problem.
The meeting will begin tonight at 7:30 in the
Excom room, Student Union.
