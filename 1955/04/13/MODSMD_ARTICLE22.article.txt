To the Editor:
The Social Co-ordinating Board would like to
commend the 7'heia Xi house on its fine Apache
Dance (held April 2â€”Ed.). Members of the Board
who attended the dance thoroughly enjoyed them
selves and have heard many favorable comments
around campus about it. r Ihi- year the Theta Xi's

made a conscious successful effort to the stand
ards of the dance. They really did a good job on the
decorations, publicity, and organization. In our esti
mation it was terrific, and we hope the Theta Xi
Apaches will put on another dance of the same type
next year.
