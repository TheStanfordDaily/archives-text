Well, sir, here's another exclusive item fiom
my network of informants. It concerns a young
man in Law School and for the purpose of this
narrative we wm iefer to him as Henry.
It seems that there was a testimonial lunch
eon in San Francisco and Henry and his father,
a San Francisco attorney, were to attend to
gether. Henry journeyed to the Fairmont
where he met his father in the lobby. The iwo
of them went into the Empire Room and sat
down at a table with some of Henry's father's
assocL gs und Henry was introduced all
around and he and his father and his father's
friends had a few before-dinner cocktails.
The first course was a small salad and a good
one, too. According to Henry. In fact, he fin
ished it in record time. As he and his father
were v *g for the second course, a head
waiter type came to the table and asked of
Henry's father, "I don't believe you've given
me your tickets, sir?'"

"I have no tickets," was the reply. "I signed
up for the dinner at my firm and my son, Henry
(smile at the man, Henry), signed up at the
Stanford Law School where he is preparing
himself for a life of torts and retorts." (These
quotations may not be entirely accurate, but
they reflect the spirit of the affair.)
"Then I imagine the man at the door has your
names on the list, sir," answered the head
waiter type.' "I would appreciate it if you would
check that with him."
So Henry and his father buttonholed the man
at the door who had the list and asked him what
was the meaning of this since they had already
signed up for this testimonial luncheon. "Tes
timonial luncheon?" queried the man with the
list. "This isn't a testimonial luncheon, this is
a luncheon of the California State Bar Asso
ciation. The testimonial luncheon is across
the hall."
Henry and his father came out ahead by sev
eral martinis and one small salad each.
