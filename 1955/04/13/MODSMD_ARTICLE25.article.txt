## 
### DOROTHY CAMPBELL 
"The exchange ol students between Stanford and the Free Uni- j
versity ol Berlin is constantly growing," said Wolfgang Pommer,
chaplain of the Free University, in a recent speech.
The Free University was lounded in 1948 to educate those of
Berlin's youth who refused to.let the Communists dictate lo them
what they should study. ♦

P o m in i' r visited Stanford last
Thursday on a 60-day tour of the
United States, sponsored by the
State Department, to further the ex
change program. He explained that
Americans aecu.it.oni themselves to
Berlin sooner than to any other G< i
man eity. lie feels that exchange
i students should live with Germans,
j not other Americans. "As an ex-
J ample, I never go into a German
restaurant while in the United
States." ,
"One cannot get any idea of a
nation by reading history books,
though this forms an indispensable
background. One must observe and
mingle wiih people.'
REAL HKRLINKK
Of his eity In said, "All real tier
liners could live nowhere else.
Though 1 am originally from Aus
tria, I consider myself a real Bei -
j liner.
"We know that Americans, real
izing the importance of West Ber
| lin, would never let it fall into Com
j munist hands. The citizens of Berlin
j have been assured by both the Tru
| man and Eisenhower administra

tions that an attack on Berlin will
be regarded as an attack on the
United States.
"'1 herefore we feel there is rela
tively little danger in living in Ber
lin. We know from experience that
the Communists listen to guarantees
of the kind made by the United
States government, not to sweet [
words. We also know enough not j
! lo trust Communist promises."
POLITICS
Berlin is in the middle ol the road
politically, said Pommer. Only four
per cent of the people belong to the
Nationalist party. This is harmless I
anyway, he said, as members limit |
their activities to singing Nationalist!
j song: . Even though unemployment {
is serious, only two per cent are
Communist.
"Our problem is not politics, butr
money," said Pommer. "Berlin is
j an island. As long as the Russians
stay in Germany we will need help. |
Living quarters and jobs are hard
to find."
This fall, realizing that even if
they wished to attend Communist
schools, they would be refused ad
mittance, more and more students
from Communist Germany will flock
to the already overcrowded Free !
University of Berlin..
