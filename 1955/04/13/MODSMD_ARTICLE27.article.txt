# Girls Carry Big Wallop
## 
### SALLY TRAPNELL 
Among the interesting sights
around campus this week will lie
five women .student;;, each of whom
will be carrying a 10-pound sledge
hammer.
They arc not out to commit, mur
der or mayhem. This is just part of
the annual initiation rites of the
Hammer and Coffin Women's Aux
iliary.
Those chosen this year as worthy
of entrance into this high organiza
tion are Diane Woodurd, Joan
Palma, Phyllis Westfall, Jackie
Rouse, and Sheila Blumenthal. All
of them have put time and interest
into the Chaparral, doing everything
from writing to circulation promo
tion to assist in the production of
the campus humor magazine.
The origin of the hammer-carry
ing ritual is rather oTjscure. How
ever, a {spokesman for the group
says that il is the Old Boy's weapon
for knocking the stuffing from
stuffed shirts, a tradition of the so
ciety.
