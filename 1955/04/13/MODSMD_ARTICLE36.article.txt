### JIM PIGOTT 
There were several treats on hand lor those who their way to the Sunken Diamond lor
yestei day's baseball spectacle betvyeen the Sale.-n Senators and the Indians.
The first, in order of importance, was that the home nine came out of the tilt with 4 runs while
the Senators, who resemble their impotent brothers from Washington at the plate, only scored 1.
The win put Stanford back on the winning track a id at the expense of a professional outfit.
The next most impressive event of the day was that Coach Everett Dean's nine went through the

entire game without committing a
single error. In addition to all this,
three of Dean's hurlers, Ray Young,
Hay Highsmiih, and Walt Payne,
combined efTorts to give up only
lour hits. Two of thesi; were singles
of the infield variety.
Highsmith, the eventual winning
pitcher, hurled the fifth and sixth
innings. The tall lefty retired the
side in order in his first round and
put down the first two batters in
the sixth. Then he>showed the only
wildness displayed by any of the
Indian pitchers throughout the af
ternoon. George Coneily, Salem
third baseman, was hit on the left
log by an inside pitch and went
down to first base. Highsmiih imme
diately took care ol the situation,
however, by proceeding to pick
Coneily off when the latter took too
big a lead.
Stanford put the first run on, the
scoreboard when it tallied in the
bottom of the first inning. Sid Hall,
diminutive centerfielder, led off with
a walk. He straightway stole sec
ond base and went on to third when
the second baseman let the throw
roll onto center field.
After Mickey Hoot/.man, Card
second sucker, skyed out to short
left, Rich Scramaglia, who was a
thorn in the Senators' .side all day,
lofted a long fly to center and Hall
came in to score.
Ed Verdurmen was nicked for the
lone Senator run in the top ol the
fourth after putting down a .mild
uprising in the third. Gene Tanseli,
Salem shortstop, led off the inning

with a booming triple to the right
field corner and came in a minute
later when Pick Traversy out
to the left fieldfi* on a moving play.
Ray Highsmith relieved Verdur
men in the top of the fifth and after
the Senators went down in order,
the Cards went to work to regain
their lead. Dandurand walked, and
was sent to second on Hal Me.ssner's
sacrifice bunt. Highsmith helped out
his own cause when he beat out a
perfect bunt, Dandurand moving to
third. At this crucial time, the Sa
lem pitcher had the misfortune to
uncork a wild pitch and Dandurand
crossed the plate. Hall walked to
keep the rally alive but Holtzman
grounded into a double play.
In the Stanford sixth, Scramaglia
led off with a booming triple and
scored on Swartz's grounder. The
latter was safe when the throw went
wild at first and scored later on
Dandurund's line single to right.
This outburst finished tfte day's
scoring and gave the Cards their
10th victory of the season.

There were several treats on hand lor those who their way to the Sunken Diamond lor
yestei day's baseball spectacle betvyeen the Sale.-n Senators and the Indians.
The first, in order of importance, was that the home nine came out of the tilt with 4 runs while
the Senators, who resemble their impotent brothers from Washington at the plate, only scored 1.
The win put Stanford back on the winning track a id at the expense of a professional outfit.
The next most impressive event of the day was that Coach Everett Dean's nine went through the

entire game without committing a
single error. In addition to all this,
three of Dean's hurlers, Ray Young,
Hay Highsmiih, and Walt Payne,
combined efTorts to give up only
lour hits. Two of thesi; were singles
of the infield variety.
Highsmith, the eventual winning
pitcher, hurled the fifth and sixth
innings. The tall lefty retired the
side in order in his first round and
put down the first two batters in
the sixth. Then he>showed the only
wildness displayed by any of the
Indian pitchers throughout the af
ternoon. George Coneily, Salem
third baseman, was hit on the left
log by an inside pitch and went
down to first base. Highsmiih imme
