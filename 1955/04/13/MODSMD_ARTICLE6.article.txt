# PHI BETE LECTURE
## Dean Stoke Appraises Present-Day Education 
### JIM PALMER 
"The end of education is not power but wisdom. Its instruments
are not of force but of reason," declared Harold W. Stoke, dean
of the University of Washington Graduate School, last night at
the fiftieth anniversary celebration of Stanford's Phi Beta Kappa
chapter.
Speaking before the Tuesday Evening Series audience in Me
morial Auditorium, Stoke assessed*

the role of education in the nation as
it has been transformed by the con
cepts of power and national strength.
"Will our concern for power di
minish our love for wisdom and vir
tue?" asked Stoke. "We must know
the danger exists. The issue has not
yet reached the point of open con

flict, hut there is a lurking uneasi
ness that this might not always be so."
"We must prevenc our nation's
power from becoming an end in
itself. . . . We hope that the values to
be protected are also those to which
education shall be devoted."
Power has changed our idea of edu
cation, he continued. The new no
tion replaces the "learned" person
with the "competent" person.
MKASlIKi: EDUCATION
"We measure educated people not
by what they know, but by what they
do, by knowing what needs to be
done and doing it . . . The educated
man is competent in his own field
and diffident, to others."
He cited the ascendency of "power
courses" in the school and college
curriculum: psychology, communica
tion, and government. "Power sub
jects grow by leaps and bounds . . .
others adapt themselves or wither
away."
Stoke rebuked the belief that na
tional strength mil t. I e based on
military power and national defense.
"The greater the number of educated
people, the greater is the strength
of the nation. Society can only be
run by educated people."
Educated people take better care
i of health, work more, read more,
i travel more, consume more, develop
j better tastes, develop organizations
| . . . and have more nervous break
| downs too, he stated.
"The correlation between the level
of education and the degree of eco
nomic well-being is high. Education
is regarded as a .source from which
welfare flows."
"The oducated man is a specialist.
If well-educated, he will have a hob
by, and if very well-educated he will
make a specialty out of his hobby."
SYMBOL
Stok ■ pointed out that Phi Beta
Kappa is a "symbol of excellence and
a bond between intellectuals," com
menting lightly that "it has stimu
lated the sale of watch chains and
inhibited the wearing of double
breasted suits."
"Organizations that have to do with
the mind are longer-lived than those
of government and business. They
are the trustees of most enduring in
terests."

He cited the ascendency of "power
courses" in the school and college
curriculum: psychology, communica
tion, and government. "Power sub
jects grow by leaps and bounds . . .
others adapt themselves or wither
away."
Stoke rebuked the belief that na
tional strength mil t. I e based on
military power and national defense.
"The greater the number of educated
people, the greater is the strength
of the nation. Society can only be
run by educated people."
Educated people take better care
i of health, work more, read more,
i travel more, consume more, develop

"The correlation between the level
of education and the degree of eco

is regarded as a .source from which
welfare flows."
"The oducated man is a specialist.
If well-educated, he will have a hob

make a specialty out of his hobby."
SYMBOL
Stok ■ pointed out that Phi Beta
Kappa is a "symbol of excellence and
a bond between intellectuals," com
menting lightly that "it has stimu
lated the sale of watch chains and
inhibited the wearing of double
breasted suits."
"Organizations that have to do with
the mind are longer-lived than those
of government and business. They
are the trustees of most enduring in
terests."
"The end of education is not power but wisdom. Its instruments
are not of force but of reason," declared Harold W. Stoke, dean
of the University of Washington Graduate School, last night at
the fiftieth anniversary celebration of Stanford's Phi Beta Kappa
chapter.
Speaking before the Tuesday Evening Series audience in Me
morial Auditorium, Stoke assessed*

the role of education in the nation as
it has been transformed by the con
cepts of power and national strength.
"Will our concern for power di
minish our love for wisdom and vir
tue?" asked Stoke. "We must know
the danger exists. The issue has not
yet reached the point of open con

flict, hut there is a lurking uneasi
ness that this might not always be so."
"We must prevenc our nation's
power from becoming an end in
itself. . . . We hope that the values to
be protected are also those to which
education shall be devoted."
Power has changed our idea of edu
cation, he continued. The new no
tion replaces the "learned" person
with the "competent" person.
MKASlIKi: EDUCATION
"We measure educated people not
by what they know, but by what they
do, by knowing what needs to be
done and doing it . . . The educated
man is competent in his own field
and diffident, to others."
