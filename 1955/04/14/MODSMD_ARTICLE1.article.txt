# 'Golden West's' Attraction Is Staging, Design
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
That design and production values should be the main attrac
tion of the Players' current presentation of "Girl of the Golden
West" is a tribute to the skills of director Douglas Cook and de
signer Richard May. It is also a commentary on the essential lack
of vitality of Belasco's Museum-piece melodrama.
Hay's practical problem of scaling the show down to the Little
Theater stage, his artistic one of getting the atmosphere of natural
ism without its clutter, have been effectively—often, in fact, quite
brilliantly—solved. His scenic drops are in particular stunningly
effective. The result is certainly one of the most handsome pro
ductions seen here in some time.
Doug Cook's direction is thoroughly competent: generally well

▼paced, atmospheric, suitably — but
| never ludicrously — exaggerated in
the "big scenes," full of authentic
j bustle and stir. '
Nor does one object to the melo
drama. Even such frank corn as the
scene in which the Girl plays rancid
Jack Ranee a quick two out of three
hands of poker for her lover's life
is good fun and actually cxciting in
a wildly theatrical way.
"SOLEMN PLATITUDES"
But Belasco was not content with
melodrama. "Golden West" is also
Art: replete with solemn platitudes
("Love works miracles every hour")
and phony poetics ("The dawn is
breaking in the East. A new day.
A new life.").
The trouble is that pasteboard
characters, though fine for melo
drama, are ruinous for pathos. The
audience just doesn't care if the Girl
loses her first kiss to a cad, and page
after page of worrying about it is
| apt to be less touching than stupify
i ing
Judith Doty as the Girl does, nev-
I ertheless, give the show its most
nearly human character. Although
her swaggering as a hearty saloon
i keeper is decidedly uncomfortable,
j she manages to come through with
: a good deal of freshness and humor
j in her type of the unspoiled child of
i nature.
SLICK MENACE
Thomas Luce struts and snarls
about quite happily as Jack Ranee.
If his slick menace is more charac
teristic of turn-of-the-century mel
odrama than of the rustic Old West,
! he is at least in the mood of the play.
Merritt Johnson brings to the role
of Dick Johnson his stage presence
j and his wonderfully mellifluous
voice. One wonders, however, even
i while granting that the character is
pretty impossible, if he doesn't over
do the inscrutability a little. The
! tones modulate very nicely indeed,
j but one is never able to grasp any
idea of a person behind them.
There is no doubt that the show
:is a genuine accomplishment for
i Hay and Cook. One only wishes
| that their efforts had been spent on
| something with a little more dra
| matic content for the audience.
