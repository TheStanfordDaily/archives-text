elections specified in this Constitu
tion and its By-laws."
Another change was the substitu
tion of the word "subordinate" for

sition where I have to resign from.

arose in Excom as to whether Voy
kovich would have time to attend
meetings regularly. Excom passed a
motion asking Bing to suggest to

RESIGNATION
In announcing his resignation,
Voykovich said, "I am put. in a po
sition where I have to resign from.
Excom. It its with the greatest re
luctance and greatest embarrass
ment that I have to resign now.
Please be assured of my sincerity."
Late last quarter some question
arose in Excom as to whether Voy
kovich would have time to attend
meetings regularly. Excom passed a
motion asking Bing to suggest to
Voykovich that perhaps he should
resign in favor of .some other grad
uate representative. The ultimate
decision was to be left up to the
graduate class whose representation
was at stake.
Voykovich said last night he re
tained his position because of a de
sire to represent the graduate class
in the discussion of the proposed
constitution.
Voykovich said, "I stayed on fill
the constitution was finished. I did
this after I knew I would have to
resign." He said he would continue
to do work regarding the grads and
their constitutional arrangements.
Bing accepted the resignation and
acknowledged the work Voykovich
has done "to make sure the gradu
ates were adequately represented."
The Executive Committee
made three minor changes in the
wording of the new proposed
constitution last night and then
gave the document is final ap
proval.
The proposed constitution will bo
the subject of u student referendum
on Tuesday and Wednesday, t wo
thirds majority is needed for it to
pass.
The draft constitution is printed
on page 5 of today's Daily in its en
tirety and incorporating the changes
made last night.
In other major action last night,
ASSU President Pete Bing accepted
the resignation of graduate repre
sentative Steve Voykovieh.
Voykovich said he resigned with
."great reluctance and great embar
rassment" because he has many eve
ning classes and must take addi
tional part-time work.
Two of the changes made in the
proposed constitution were proposed
by Roberta Clark. One revised only
the order of words in Article 11, sec
tion 6, sub-section 2, second para
graph on the student financial man
ager. The second sentence now be
gins: "In his comptrollership ca
pacity, the Student Financial Man
ager shall . .
CLARIFICATION
The other change was advocated
by Miss Clark to clarify the pro
posed Legislature's control of elec
tions. The first sentence of Article
V, section 1, on elections reads: "The
Legislature shall have the power to
regulate and supervise all student
elections specified in this Constitu
tion and its By-laws."
Another change was the substitu
tion of the word "subordinate" for
"inferior" with regard to judicial
bodies of lesser authority than the
Judicial Council, which is composed
of Men's and Women's Councils.
This is in Article IV.
