### 
A decision which might change the whole
structure of our student government: that's
what Stanford students will be called upon to
make next Tuesday and Wednesday.
The decision \- '1 be whether or not to adopt
a proposed r.ew j ..siitution for the Associated
Students of Stanford University. The pro
posed document will be submitted to the stu
dent body in referendum, and in order to be
come the Consiiiuticn of A.S.S.U. it must re
ceive approve! â–  !wo-thirds of the voters.
By constitute" nal requirement, today's Daily
reprints both present ciud proposed Constitu
tions, on pages 4 and 5.
rt's an important decision we must make,
and to make ii wisely, we must know what it
is we are voting for. Compare the two Con
stitutions carefully. If you want a separate
copy of both, you can obtain it at the A.S.S.U.
office.
As you comcare the two documents, here
are a few of the salient joints to observe:
The pioposed new Constitution would sep
arate Executive and Legislative branches, of
student governrnori fat present combined in
the Executive Committee) and provide for liv
ing group representation in the Legislature
and class and activity group representation
in the Cabinet.
To compai u f he present and proposed set
ups in this are a, see the present Article 111;

and the proposed Article 11, Section 3,
Article 111.
The proposed new Constitution would give
the President two assistants, and Adminis
trative Assistant who has no counterpart in the
present setup, and a Student Financial Man
ager, at present the Student Manager, who
would have a new formalized connection with
the President.
For comparison, see present Article VI;
and proposed Article 11, Section 6.
The proposed Cabinet would coordinate
student activities and serve as an advisory
and assistant body to the President within the
Executive structure. There is no counterpart
of this Cabinet in the present Constitution.
See proposed Article 11, Section 3.
A reorganization of student activity groups
would set up Boards, Commissions, and
temporary committees by bylaws under the
proposed Constitution. The present setup pro
vides for Boards and Standing Committees?
Compare present Article 111, Section 2,
with proposed Article 11, Sections 3 hand
4.
There are other, less evident differences be
tween the two documents. Look especially at
the points which will affect you. Make your
decision, and then, on Tuesday or Wednes
day, go to the polls and express it. It's in your
own interest to do so.
