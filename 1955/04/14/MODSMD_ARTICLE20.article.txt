# pledge sneaks ......... an editorial

### 
The pledge sneak practice got out of hand
over the weekend. The freshman sneak and the
fraternity retaliation reached near riot propor
tions both at Enema and the Row.
And the shmen in Enema and the Village
have lc ■ within their jurisdiction —to
prevexu w .. • tltion. Eecause both fraternity
men end frerjhmen were responsible in part
for the sneak repercussions, the activities of
both groups within Enema and the Village have
been restricted. •
The pledge sneak is normally a private, lo
calized affair, generally coming under the head
ing of "harmless fun." It is thought of by the
fraternities as a method by which the pledges,
spread out in University residences, can de
velop friendships and unity among themselves.
The advocated goal of a sneak is to incon
venience the active- m the house — without
destioying property, me fraternity attempts to
"uninconvenience" iiself and prevent the sneak
from becoming a nightly occurrence.
The pledge sneak practice is not one to be

particularly advocated or encouraged because
it creates an additional opportunity for thought
less, mob-like action. But as long as pledge
sneak sequence is confined and controlled, we
do not urge outlawing the practice.
However, the weekend disturbance gave evi
dence for the need of some kind of action. The
freshmen felt the need and acted quickly to
curtail the danger of future riots and to maintain
order in the dorms.
|p
The freshmen decided that no fraternity or
eating club men may enter the dorms for re
taliatory purposes and that no fraternity or eat
ing club property —referring to property ac
quired in a sneak—be permitted in the dorms.
The wisdom of the actual rules themselves
is questionable. The regulations represent just
one side of a very complex problem, and the
two rules do not seem equally enforceable.
None the less, the action of the freshmen may
be sufficient to drive home the need for pledge
sneaks conducted rationally, not riotously. This
is the primary goal.
