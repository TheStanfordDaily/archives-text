## "not ridiculing intellectuals" 
### 
To the Editor:
In The Stanford Daily, April 11, your article made
me appear a champion of intellectual mediocrity and
a party to 'he.. d;.r .. rous trend of anti-intellectualism.
You did thir. qu : ..itentionally I hope, by quoting
out of context in remark that I was not interested
in training "a bunch of intellectual odd balis." This
remark made facetiously and in connection with my
definite propositi for changes in our under-graduate
curriculum to the end of more efTective training of
superior students a proposal which I have advocated
since 1937. A copy of my proposal was handed to The
Daily, and it was my understanding that you would
make use of it in your story.
The plan which 1 handed to The Daily is the fol
lowing:
I recommend (he adoption of the policy of dis
tinguishing el ween "pas:." and "honors" degrees.
The work for the A.!». "pa s" degree might very well
remain substantially the same as at present. The
A.B. degree "with honors" would require a pro
gram of study involving at least some individual
work, p?rhaps one fourth to one half of the stu
dent's program, e: r * nuarler throughout the stu
dent's four under. 1 titltt; te year.. This "honors" pro
gram would lead I ■ a comprehensive examination
covering the ft ur years of undergraduate work.
More should lie cxp.cted :f the "honors" than of the
"pass" student in both quantity and quality of work
done.
'I his program w uld call for additional funds for
teaching fellowships nd scholarships for promising
graduate students who, \vhile working for advanced
v. ..uhi servo as faculty advisers to "honors"
students. Such a program should appeal not only to
those who are interested in the extension of graduate
study at Stanford hut also to those who would have
this university develop a type of undergraduate
training in which it has a comparative advantage
over universities and colleges in the West.
Ports of tiiis plan I presented to the Committee on
the Teaching of Undergraduate Economics of the
American Economic Association when I was a mem

ber of the subcommittee on The Treatment of Espe
cially AMe Students of Economic.-:.
Anyone who reads my plan can surely see that I am
in favor of improving the intellectual atmosphere
rather than in ridiculing intellectuals. It is regret
able that The Daily saw fit to omit my plan and not
my "quip" from its article.
