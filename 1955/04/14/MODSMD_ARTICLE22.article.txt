# flicks and "bigotry"
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Leave us face it, Mr. MinkofT: 1) The Sunday Night j
Flicks are one of the few overt signs of consciousness j
on the campus; and 2) an intolerant attitude toward :
some innocent steam-blowing can do no good for in- <
terl'aith relations.
Most students here on tho Farm follow a rigorous !
program of studies, the major on-campus relief being I
the imbibing of boiled coffee hulls at the Cellar. But on
Sunday night the hard-pressed Stanford man, like
Rapunzel, lets down his hair and. descends from the j
ivy tower.
Anyone who criticizes the refreshing and quite
appropriate razzing that goes on at Mem Aud on Sun
days is either hypersensitive, senile, or badly in need
of an additional GO cents so he can attend one of the
"more civilized" local cinemas. And when he cloaks
his feelings with a hollow accusation of bigotry, he is
being not only unfair, but ungentlemanly.
"The Jazz Singer" was a lousy picture. Its boxlike
structure wa:; unimaginative; its stiff dialogue was
dull; its obvious attempt to picture a never-never
land of perfect interfaith harmony was a huge dose of
schmaltz. It deserved a far bigger razzing than it got.
As for the "blasphemy," I deem it safe to say that
most Stanford students do not know a Kadish from a
radish, or the Kol Nidre from a coal mine. If they
heard the Lord's Prayer in Swahili they'd roll in the
aisles. Try rolling in the aisles some time, Mr. Critic, j
So let us not search for bigotry with a microscope !
and a paranoid quiver. Everyone knows that there's |
enough of it out there already, just waiting for us. j
