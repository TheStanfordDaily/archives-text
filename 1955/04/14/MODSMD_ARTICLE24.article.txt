In the world of the a. & r. (artists and repertoire) men, a gimmick
is a device introduced in the making of a record to catch the public
and help sales.
On a good day, an a. <5, r. man thinks to himself, "Man, what's
selling? Why, steel guitar, Mahalia Jackson, French horn, male

chorus, honking saxes, Frankie
L'tini.', rhythm and blues, hillbilly,
church bells, and mambo." Then he
picks a gem like "Tweedle-dee,"
crams all the gimmicks into it) and
along comes another record for the
cretins. It can't miss.
The universal gimmick in the rec
ord business now is high fidelity.
Hi-fi, as a gimmick, is not neces
sarily introduced into the making
of the record, only of the jacket.
When the craze began, the big com
panies furiously pasted hi-fi stick
ers on all the record jackets, and
all covers since have it incorporated
into the design.
The deed does not always follow
the word. Some companies are care
less, particularly the little jazz com
panies. Prestige and Clef wave the
flag but continue to press their rec
ords on gravel. The West Coast
outfits like Contemporary are good,
because nearly all of them record at
either Radio Recorders or Capitol in
L.A., both top studios.
UShS OF "GIMMICK"
Classical records use the gimmick
as much as jazz does. Columbia put
"Hi-fi plus" tabs on a lot of old re
cordings. Capitol is only moderately
careful in what it decides to label
"(is"; many are gulled from old mas
ters, recorded in studios with "dead"
acoustics.
High fidelity in the record (not on
the jacket) depends on the equip
ment used; for example, the German
Teiefunken mike is producing most
of the superior recordings now. Hi
fi depends on the mike placement
and the acoustics of the hall; single
mike technique is replacing the old
multiple mike methods, and Chicago
Symphony Hall arid London's Kings
way Hall have produced some of the
most "live" recordings. Hi-fi even
depends on the instrument chosen;
recent experiments showed that the
Stein way B is one of the few pianos
that record perfectly. Other factors
arc the cutting equipment and the
material is pressed in.
Some labels can be depended on.
The Mercury Golden Lyre and
Olympian series, the newest Co
lumbias and Capitols, most West -
minsters, and above all the RCA
New Orthophonic series.
London and Angel are usually
good, but London occasionally puts
a re-issue from the 78 library on the
back of a good recording. The only
way to tell is to listen for surface
noise and fuzziness in the loudest
highs. Angel can't be beat for cpera.

Decca's pressings from Deutsche
Gramolone masters are good except
for slight surface noise.
SMALL LABELS
But lor recording excellents, some
ol the small labels are better than
the big. Bartok has been quietly
turning out the finest records ex
tant, especially of the music of its
namesake. Esoteric for madrigals
and motets, Period for 18th century
music, Haydn Society for Renais
sance and baroque, Vox for some
romantics, like the Mendelssohn
concerti, Vanguard and Urania —
these turn out mostly good record
ings.
In general the hi-fi label doesn't
mean much yet. There are lots of
old Columbias and Londons without
the tag that sound excellent, and
even some Camdens (RCA's bargain
package, old masters of top orches
tras under false names) still sound
good. The only way to choose is to
listen to several versions of what
you want. Listen lor sound, surface,
and interpretation to please you.
Compared one against the other, one
may drag or sound tinny, and your
choice is made. Some music must
be chosen by interpretation, but if
there are several good versions,
sound can be the criterion.
JAZZ OFFERINGS
Jazz fans at the Prom this week
end may be interested to know that
almost the whole Dave Pell Octet is
made of Les Brown sidemen.
Brown's band, because of steady
work on Bob Hope's program, has
been together longer than any other
big band around, and achieves some
of the same swinging rapport that
Benny Goodman used to. Arranger
Frank Comstock also did the back
ground work on the Hi-lo's new al
bums.
Brubeck arrives tomorrow night
to play every weekend at the Black
hawk.
This Sunday at 4 p.m. the Music
Department will present a chamber
music concert including work by
Roger Goeb, a famous American
composer who is teaching composi
tion at Stanford this year.

ol the small labels are better than
the big. Bartok has been quietly
turning out the finest records ex
tant, especially of the music of its
namesake. Esoteric for madrigals
and motets, Period for 18th century
music, Haydn Society for Renais
sance and baroque, Vox for some
romantics, like the Mendelssohn
concerti, Vanguard and Urania —
these turn out mostly good record
ings.
In general the hi-fi label doesn't
mean much yet. There are lots of
old Columbias and Londons without
the tag that sound excellent, and
even some Camdens (RCA's bargain
package, old masters of top orches
tras under false names) still sound
good. The only way to choose is to
listen to several versions of what
you want. Listen lor sound, surface,
and interpretation to please you.
Compared one against the other, one
may drag or sound tinny, and your
choice is made. Some music must
be chosen by interpretation, but if
there are several good versions,
sound can be the criterion.
JAZZ OFFERINGS
Jazz fans at the Prom this week
end may be interested to know that
almost the whole Dave Pell Octet is
made of Les Brown sidemen.
Brown's band, because of steady
work on Bob Hope's program, has
been together longer than any other
big band around, and achieves some
of the same swinging rapport that
Benny Goodman used to. Arranger
Frank Comstock also did the back
ground work on the Hi-lo's new al
bums.
Brubeck arrives tomorrow night
to play every weekend at the Black
hawk.
This Sunday at 4 p.m. the Music
Department will present a chamber
music concert including work by
Roger Goeb, a famous American
composer who is teaching composi
tion at Stanford this year.
In the world of the a. & r. (artists and repertoire) men, a gimmick
is a device introduced in the making of a record to catch the public
and help sales.
On a good day, an a. <5, r. man thinks to himself, "Man, what's
selling? Why, steel guitar, Mahalia Jackson, French horn, male

chorus, honking saxes, Frankie
L'tini.', rhythm and blues, hillbilly,
church bells, and mambo." Then he
picks a gem like "Tweedle-dee,"
crams all the gimmicks into it) and
along comes another record for the
cretins. It can't miss.
The universal gimmick in the rec
ord business now is high fidelity.
Hi-fi, as a gimmick, is not neces
sarily introduced into the making
of the record, only of the jacket.
When the craze began, the big com
panies furiously pasted hi-fi stick
ers on all the record jackets, and
all covers since have it incorporated
into the design.
The deed does not always follow
the word. Some companies are care
less, particularly the little jazz com
panies. Prestige and Clef wave the
flag but continue to press their rec
ords on gravel. The West Coast
outfits like Contemporary are good,
because nearly all of them record at
either Radio Recorders or Capitol in
L.A., both top studios.
UShS OF "GIMMICK"
Classical records use the gimmick
as much as jazz does. Columbia put
"Hi-fi plus" tabs on a lot of old re
cordings. Capitol is only moderately
careful in what it decides to label
"(is"; many are gulled from old mas
ters, recorded in studios with "dead"
acoustics.
High fidelity in the record (not on
the jacket) depends on the equip
ment used; for example, the German
Teiefunken mike is producing most
of the superior recordings now. Hi
fi depends on the mike placement
and the acoustics of the hall; single
mike technique is replacing the old
multiple mike methods, and Chicago
Symphony Hall arid London's Kings
way Hall have produced some of the
most "live" recordings. Hi-fi even
depends on the instrument chosen;
recent experiments showed that the
Stein way B is one of the few pianos
that record perfectly. Other factors
arc the cutting equipment and the
material is pressed in.
Some labels can be depended on.
The Mercury Golden Lyre and
Olympian series, the newest Co
lumbias and Capitols, most West -
minsters, and above all the RCA
New Orthophonic series.
London and Angel are usually
good, but London occasionally puts
a re-issue from the 78 library on the
back of a good recording. The only
way to tell is to listen for surface
noise and fuzziness in the loudest
highs. Angel can't be beat for cpera.

Decca's pressings from Deutsche
Gramolone masters are good except
for slight surface noise.

flag but continue to press their rec
ords on gravel. The West Coast
outfits like Contemporary are good,
because nearly all of them record at
either Radio Recorders or Capitol in
L.A., both top studios.
UShS OF "GIMMICK"
Classical records use the gimmick
as much as jazz does. Columbia put
"Hi-fi plus" tabs on a lot of old re
cordings. Capitol is only moderately
careful in what it decides to label
"(is"; many are gulled from old mas
ters, recorded in studios with "dead"
acoustics.
High fidelity in the record (not on
the jacket) depends on the equip
ment used; for example, the German
Teiefunken mike is producing most
of the superior recordings now. Hi
fi depends on the mike placement
and the acoustics of the hall; single
mike technique is replacing the old
multiple mike methods, and Chicago
Symphony Hall arid London's Kings
way Hall have produced some of the
most "live" recordings. Hi-fi even
depends on the instrument chosen;
recent experiments showed that the
Stein way B is one of the few pianos
that record perfectly. Other factors
arc the cutting equipment and the
material is pressed in.
Some labels can be depended on.
The Mercury Golden Lyre and
Olympian series, the newest Co
lumbias and Capitols, most West -
minsters, and above all the RCA
New Orthophonic series.
London and Angel are usually
good, but London occasionally puts
a re-issue from the 78 library on the
back of a good recording. The only
way to tell is to listen for surface
noise and fuzziness in the loudest
highs. Angel can't be beat for cpera.

Decca's pressings from Deutsche
Gramolone masters are good except
for slight surface noise.
SMALL LABELS
But lor recording excellents, some
ol the small labels are better than
the big. Bartok has been quietly
turning out the finest records ex
tant, especially of the music of its
namesake. Esoteric for madrigals
and motets, Period for 18th century
music, Haydn Society for Renais
sance and baroque, Vox for some
romantics, like the Mendelssohn
concerti, Vanguard and Urania —
these turn out mostly good record
ings.
In general the hi-fi label doesn't
mean much yet. There are lots of
old Columbias and Londons without
the tag that sound excellent, and
even some Camdens (RCA's bargain
package, old masters of top orches
tras under false names) still sound
good. The only way to choose is to
listen to several versions of what
you want. Listen lor sound, surface,
and interpretation to please you.
Compared one against the other, one
may drag or sound tinny, and your
choice is made. Some music must
be chosen by interpretation, but if
there are several good versions,
sound can be the criterion.
JAZZ OFFERINGS
Jazz fans at the Prom this week
end may be interested to know that
almost the whole Dave Pell Octet is
made of Les Brown sidemen.
Brown's band, because of steady
work on Bob Hope's program, has
been together longer than any other
big band around, and achieves some
of the same swinging rapport that
Benny Goodman used to. Arranger
Frank Comstock also did the back
ground work on the Hi-lo's new al
bums.
Brubeck arrives tomorrow night
to play every weekend at the Black
hawk.
This Sunday at 4 p.m. the Music
Department will present a chamber
music concert including work by
Roger Goeb, a famous American
composer who is teaching composi
tion at Stanford this year.
In the world of the a. & r. (artists and repertoire) men, a gimmick
is a device introduced in the making of a record to catch the public
and help sales.
On a good day, an a. <5, r. man thinks to himself, "Man, what's
selling? Why, steel guitar, Mahalia Jackson, French horn, male

chorus, honking saxes, Frankie
L'tini.', rhythm and blues, hillbilly,
church bells, and mambo." Then he
picks a gem like "Tweedle-dee,"
crams all the gimmicks into it) and
along comes another record for the
cretins. It can't miss.
The universal gimmick in the rec
ord business now is high fidelity.
Hi-fi, as a gimmick, is not neces
sarily introduced into the making
of the record, only of the jacket.
When the craze began, the big com
panies furiously pasted hi-fi stick
ers on all the record jackets, and
all covers since have it incorporated
into the design.
The deed does not always follow
the word. Some companies are care
less, particularly the little jazz com
panies. Prestige and Clef wave the
flag but continue to press their rec
ords on gravel. The West Coast
outfits like Contemporary are good,
because nearly all of them record at
either Radio Recorders or Capitol in
