The number of Stanford students
afflicted with cancer during the past
six years is roughly on a par with
the rats of cancer affliction in the
nation as a whole, according to Dr.
George H. Houck, director of the
University's Health Service.
From 1948 through 1954, 4G stu
dents developed cancer, and eight
are known to have died from the
disease. Dr. Houck says, statistics
are "incomplete, however, since some
of the. victims have gone to foreign
countries.
Twelve students who developed
skin cancers were treated success
fully during the six-year period, Dr.
Houck said.
With the exception of minor skin
cancers, the disease strifck approxi
mately five students each year. I'he
victims corresponded roughly to the
enrollment ratio of about three men
to each woman.
The most surprising finding of the
Stanford cancer study, Dr. Houck
said, was the absence of a single
case of leukemia or related blood
cancer among students.
Dr. Houck's statistics were in
cluded in a recent speech before the
Palo Alto Rotary Club, entitled
