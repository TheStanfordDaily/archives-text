## THE 						GIFT HOUSE 
### Author of "Barefoot Boy With Cheek," etc 
Many of our friends will soon be graduating. What kind of
gifts should we give them?
Here is no simple question. It is never simple 1o Hud gifts for
people who have everything, and college students, as everyone*
knows, are the most richly endowed of mortals. They've got
beauty and truth. They've got rhythm. They've rot stout hear! a,
willing hands, and a clear vision that dispels the miasmas of the
future as the morning sun sears away the last wisp:; of a cool
night's fog. They've got heaps and heaps of money, as who would
not who has been receiving such a huge allowance over four
years of schooling?
What can we give them that they don't already have?
One infallible gift for the person who has everything is, of
course, a stethoscope. Xew models, featuring sequined earpieces
and power steering, are now on display at your local surgical
supply house. Accompanying each stethoscope is a gift card with
this lovely poem:
When you hear yovr heart beat,
When you hear it -pound,
Rarnembi r me, your buddy,
William Henry Round,
Tf, by some odd chance, your name does not happen to be
William Henry Round (you're laughing, but it's possible), bore
is another dandy suggestion for the person who has everything
- a gift certificate from the American Bar Association.
These certificates, good at your local lawyer's, come in three
convenient sizes:- small, medium, and large. The small certificate
covers title searches and writs of estoppel. The medium size
covers torts, claim jumping, and violations of the Smoot-Hawley
Act. The large one covers kidnapping, murdei\ and barratry.
If, by some odd chance, you don't know what barratry is
(you're laughing, but it's possible), it i; arson at sea. Tiii.- inter
esting crime is called after Cosmo "Bubbles" Barrat, a captain
in the British navy during the last century, who was addicted to
burning his ships. One man o' war after another fell victim to
his incendiary bent. The Admiralty kept getting crosser and
crosser, but every time they called in Captain Barrat for a
!:colding, he would roll his big blue eyes ami tug his lnivhck and
promise faithfully never to do it again. Oh, butter wouldn't
melt in his mouth, that one!
So t hey would give him another ship, and he would soon reduce
it to a scattering of charred spars. He burned more than 120,')«')<)
ships before Ik; was finally discharged as "doubtful ollicer
material."
After his separation from the navy, he moved to Vienna whore
he changed his name to Freud and invented Scrabble.
But 1 digress. 1 was listing gifts for the person who ha every
thing, and here is another one. This gift, in fact, i:i not only for
persons who have everything, it is also for persons who have
nothing, for persons who have next to nothing, for persons who
have next to everything, and for persons in betwi n. I refer,
of course, to l'hilip Morris cigarettes. Here is. the cigarette
for everybody for everybody, that is, who liis i mild relaxing
smoke of fine vintage tobacco in a handsome br )\vn package
that snaps open with the greatest of ease. For th• <', if such
there be, who like dull, nondescript tobacco in a i.."kago that
requires a burglar's kit to open, Philip Morn i : defmiioly the
wrong gift.
Among iho newer gifts that warrant your attention is a revolu
tionary development in the enjoyment of recorded music. This
is the Low-Fi Phonograph. The l,ow-Fi. product of yeai of
patient research, has so little fidelity to the rei<<nl you put on
it that if, for example, you put Stordu. t on 1h:.» turntable,
M( laveliidy fiaby will come out. This i an especially welcome
gift for people who hate Stardust.
Finally thery is Sigafoos Shaving Cream, a brand new kind
of cream that makes whiskers grow in in t< ad < ? out.. Von ju:'
bite them off in the morning.
