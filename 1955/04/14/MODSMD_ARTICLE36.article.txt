# Frosh Horsehiders Bounce Paly High Vikings, 9-3
## 
### 
The Stanford frosh, although out
hit by the Palo Alto Vikings, rang
up a 9-3 win yesterday in a contest
played across El Camino on the los
ers' diamond.
Bob Dwight got the Papooses off
to a fast start when he homered in
the first inning off Vike pitcher
Bucky Armstrong. The Paly park
has no fences and Dwight's long hit
just rolled and rolled. There were
two other Card homers and these
provided the winning margin. Palo

Alto outswatted the frosh eight to
seven, but walks and the homers
turned the game in favor of Stan
ford.
Gordy Medaiis led off the fifth in
ning with a circuit clout to push the
Indian lead to' 6-2, and pitcher Ben
Stevens lined out a two-run home
run in the seventh.
Dick Schmidt opened on the
mound for Stanford and was re
lieved in the sixth by Stevens after
giving up the three Viking tallies.
