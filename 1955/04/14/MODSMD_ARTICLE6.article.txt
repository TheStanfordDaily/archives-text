# Doctors Comment On Polio Vaccine
## 
### JOHN McFEE 
The announcement yesterday of a polio vaccine developed by
Dr. Jonas E. Salk of the University of Pittsburgh which has proven
to be up to 90 per cent effective in mass tests conducted over the
past year may very well be one of the highlights of medical accom
plishments over the past century. The new vaccine, derived after

: many years of research, will be put'
j to use immediately, the first and
I second grade children of the Bay
I Area obtaining their first shots
I Monday.
"It's entirely too early to know
i.how much vaccine will be available
for college-age people," said Dr.
George Houck, Health Service Di
rector. "It is mostly for young chil
dren, and immunizing them will be
of benefit to everyone."
"As far as cost of the inocula
tion shots are concerned, I can't
, quote a figure yet. However, it
will be low enough so that cost
will not be a deciding factor to the
student."
"The critical point," Dr. Houck
went on, "concerns how much of
the vaccine is available. There will
not be enough this year to give to
everyone who wishes it." To pre
vent any "black market" in the vac
cine, the government may call an
urgent conference soon to plan dis
tribution and use of the vaccine.
The Salk vaccine itself is made
up of three types of polio viruses
which have been killed by formal
' dehydc. The. viruses were originally
obtained from the nervous tissue of
dead polio victims, and due to re
search in 1949 under Dr. John F.
Enders at Harvard, these viruses
may be grown in unlimited num
j hers in the non-notvous cultures of
test-tubes.
"So far the reports on the Salk
vaccine are very encouraging and I
hope the vaccine turns out well,"
said Professor Charles E. Clifton

of the Bacteriology Dept. At pres
ent the inoculation will be ac
complished by three shots of the
vaccine serum, two, of which will be
given within two to four weeks of
each other. A third "booster" shot
will follow seven months or so later.
"This booster shot increases the
number of antibodies in the body
just as any other booster shots cause
a marked increase in body resist
ance to the particular disease," went
on Dr. Clifton.
"Although I have not yet seen any
scientific report on the Salk vac
cine," said Dr. Rodney Beard, head
of the Dept. of Public Health and
Preventive Medicine at Stanford
Medical School, "it will be very en
couraging to have a vaccine which
is in some measure effective against
polio. However, it is premature u
say that polio is gone for good, and
it will take many years to evaluate
this vaccine. There is at present no
way of knowing how long immunity
produced by the vaccine will last, or
as to how many booster shots are
necessary for adequate immuniza
tion."

The announcement yesterday of a polio vaccine developed by
Dr. Jonas E. Salk of the University of Pittsburgh which has proven
to be up to 90 per cent effective in mass tests conducted over the
past year may very well be one of the highlights of medical accom
plishments over the past century. The new vaccine, derived after

: many years of research, will be put'
j to use immediately, the first and
I second grade children of the Bay
I Area obtaining their first shots
I Monday.
"It's entirely too early to know
i.how much vaccine will be available
for college-age people," said Dr.
George Houck, Health Service Di
rector. "It is mostly for young chil
dren, and immunizing them will be
of benefit to everyone."
"As far as cost of the inocula
tion shots are concerned, I can't
, quote a figure yet. However, it
will be low enough so that cost
will not be a deciding factor to the
student."
"The critical point," Dr. Houck
went on, "concerns how much of
the vaccine is available. There will
not be enough this year to give to
everyone who wishes it." To pre
vent any "black market" in the vac
cine, the government may call an
urgent conference soon to plan dis
tribution and use of the vaccine.
The Salk vaccine itself is made
up of three types of polio viruses
which have been killed by formal
' dehydc. The. viruses were originally
obtained from the nervous tissue of
dead polio victims, and due to re
search in 1949 under Dr. John F.
Enders at Harvard, these viruses
may be grown in unlimited num
j hers in the non-notvous cultures of
test-tubes.
"So far the reports on the Salk
vaccine are very encouraging and I
hope the vaccine turns out well,"
said Professor Charles E. Clifton

of the Bacteriology Dept. At pres
ent the inoculation will be ac
complished by three shots of the
vaccine serum, two, of which will be
given within two to four weeks of
each other. A third "booster" shot
will follow seven months or so later.
"This booster shot increases the
number of antibodies in the body
just as any other booster shots cause
a marked increase in body resist
ance to the particular disease," went
on Dr. Clifton.
"Although I have not yet seen any
scientific report on the Salk vac
cine," said Dr. Rodney Beard, head
of the Dept. of Public Health and
Preventive Medicine at Stanford
Medical School, "it will be very en
couraging to have a vaccine which
is in some measure effective against
polio. However, it is premature u
say that polio is gone for good, and
it will take many years to evaluate
this vaccine. There is at present no
way of knowing how long immunity
produced by the vaccine will last, or
as to how many booster shots are
necessary for adequate immuniza
tion."
