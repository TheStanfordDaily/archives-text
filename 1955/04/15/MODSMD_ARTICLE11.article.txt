## Farm Visit May Be Delayed As Ship Passage Canceled 
### 
Eleven Russian college and youth publication editors slated to
arrive in the United States next week and visit Stanford next month
have balked at being fingerprinted and their trip may be delayed,
U.S. officials disclosed yesterday.
Officials said the editors have not yet picked up their visas

at the U.S. embassy in Moscow.
The editors were scheduled to sail
from England yesterday aboard the
Queen Elizabeth, but they canceled
their cabin class passage without ex
planation.
The Russians were scheduled to
arrive in the United States next
Tuesday. Advance plans had them
in the Bay Area from April 30 until
May 4 and at Stanford from the eve
ning of May 2 through the morning
of May 4.
NOT IN BRITAIN
A spokesman at the U.S. embassy
in London said that as far as he
knew the Russians had never ar
rived in Britain. lie said he would
have been notified if they had ar
rived.
A State Department spokesman
said, however, that he had not been
informed that the tour had been
canceled and "we still expect that
they will come."
Arthur C. Nogle, director of spe
cial programs of the Institute of In
ternational Education which is han
dling the visit, said in New York he
still expects that "somehow or other
they will arrive on April 19." He
said he presumed they would come
by plane."
TENTATIVE PLANS
Stanford has made tentative plans
for entertaining the Russians next
month, and those plans are now in
the hands of the lIE, Assistant to the
President Frederic O. Glover said
last night.
Glover stated that the University
would be able to modify the ar
rangements should the tour of the
Soviet group be delayed. "While it
would be inconvenient, it would
be entirely possible to change the
plans and we would set about im
mediately to do so," he said.
Glover emphasized that "it would
be primarily a matter of inconven
ience."
U.S. immigration laws require all
persons entering this country to be
fingerprinted before receiving visas.
An official said the Russians
"raised a question" about this and
have not yet picked up their visas
in Moscow. He said the editors have
not submitted to fingerprinting yet

Stanford has made tentative plans
for entertaining the Russians next
month, and those plans are now in
the hands of the lIE, Assistant to the
President Frederic O. Glover said
last night.
Glover stated that the University
would be able to modify the ar
rangements should the tour of the
Soviet group be delayed. "While it
would be inconvenient, it would
be entirely possible to change the
plans and we would set about im
mediately to do so," he said.
Glover emphasized that "it would
be primarily a matter of inconven
ience."
U.S. immigration laws require all
persons entering this country to be
fingerprinted before receiving visas.
An official said the Russians
"raised a question" about this and
have not yet picked up their visas
in Moscow. He said the editors have
not submitted to fingerprinting yet

Eleven Russian college and youth publication editors slated to
arrive in the United States next week and visit Stanford next month
have balked at being fingerprinted and their trip may be delayed,
U.S. officials disclosed yesterday.
Officials said the editors have not yet picked up their visas

at the U.S. embassy in Moscow.
The editors were scheduled to sail
from England yesterday aboard the
Queen Elizabeth, but they canceled
their cabin class passage without ex
planation.
The Russians were scheduled to
arrive in the United States next
Tuesday. Advance plans had them
in the Bay Area from April 30 until
May 4 and at Stanford from the eve
ning of May 2 through the morning
of May 4.
NOT IN BRITAIN
A spokesman at the U.S. embassy
in London said that as far as he
knew the Russians had never ar
rived in Britain. lie said he would
have been notified if they had ar
rived.
A State Department spokesman
said, however, that he had not been
informed that the tour had been
canceled and "we still expect that
they will come."
Arthur C. Nogle, director of spe
cial programs of the Institute of In
ternational Education which is han
dling the visit, said in New York he
still expects that "somehow or other
they will arrive on April 19." He
said he presumed they would come
by plane."
