# Proposed Constitution Is Examined
## 'Responsibility Is Centralized' 
### JIM PALMER 
"The proposed ASSU Consti
tution is an attempt to centralize
and coordinate responsibility,
making the student body presi
dent a more active leader and
less of a figurehead," asserted
Tom Bartlett of the political sci
ence department in an interview
with The Daily yesterday.
Bartlett, who served on the spc
cal student government committee
which drew up recommendations for
the constitution, pointed out that the
student manager has been actually
serving as chief administrative of
ficer with "routine control."
"If you control routine matters,
you control the whole organization
. . . The proposed constitution has
: been designed to decrease the policy
role of the student manager and to
j give the elected officer more eon -
: trol."
Bartlett said that the proposed cab
inet system will give the leaders a
chance to understand what other
student organizations are doing, al
lowing them to meet together and to
work out problems. Before, the
j groups were isolated.
The legislature will provide bet
ter representation and will "provide
j a better training ground for student
j body officers, as well as an oppor-
I tunity for more creative energies."
"The proposed constitution has the
j potential . . . whether or not any
thing comes of it will depend on the
j enthusiasm and insight of the people
' who pul it in < lied," lie declared.
