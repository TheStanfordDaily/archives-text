# Foreign Students Express Views
## 
### EDA MENDELS 
Five foreign students ex
i pressed some of their views on
Stanford student government
j and the new constitution, and
I contrasted them to the forms to
which they were accustomed.
"I admire the efficiency by which
they carry out the set-up here,
though too many committees may
stand in the way," Nabila Nouhy
from Egypt remarked. "It might lead
to bureaucracy. One day there might
be more people on the committees ■
than there arc to take care of."
At. the American University of :
Cairo which she attended, a Council
of eight representatives selected j
from the classes and clubs directed
all activities. New to dorm life, she |
found that "AWS is doing a very good
job with the dorm regulations."
Doug Atkcn, graduate of Oxford,
explained how student government
operated at his alma mater. Oxford
has no central University student j
government, but works through its I
26 colleges, each about the size of
Stern Hall.
Every college has its junior com
mon room, in which each student
participates. It elects its own presi
dent, who is the direct liaison to the
administration.
When asked whether he thought,
i such a system might operate at Stan- ■
lord, Aitken decided, "It couldn t
really. It works there because life
rotates around the college, it's inte
grated in the college. With so many
off-campus students here, it wouldn't
work."

Kaufmann said, student leaders, even
the president, are all volunteers.
There are very few student activi
ties, and these arc on an academic
basis, such as lectures by prominent
visitors.
Miss Kaufmann compared her uni- ;
versity to graduate school, where !
students arc working seriously to
ward a specific job. "They study in
tently. then go skiing or swimming i
to relax, and don't want to be bound i
by extra - curricular activities." j
Dave Penny outlined the system j
common in Australian universities. '
At his school, the University of Ade
laide, a student council of 30 car
ried on activities for the student
body of 3,000.
Modeled on the British parlia
mentary system, the student council
i elects the executive officers, such as j
I the president and treasurer.
"The treasurer always has the di
rect assistance of a professional ac- j
countant. Problems about the indc
i pendencc of the student manager
have therefore never arisen."
About Stanford's proposed Consti
-1 tution, Penny commented, "It's very
good to increase the size of the legis
lature, if for no other reason than
that more people can share Lhe j
1 work."
"I have observed Little interest!
here in what student government j
does. But then, again, student, apathy
seems to be common to universities
all over the world. Perhaps it is j
inevtablc that this would be so here,
since the living group claims first
interest," Penny said.
Eckart Rottka, from the Free Uni
; versity of Berlin, commented on the ,
i proposed constitution. "It's a very '
good improvement. The most sig
nificant feature is the real division
between the executive and the legis
lative departments." The Free Uni
versity has complete separation, with
the executive elected from the legis
lature.

Kaufmann said, student leaders, even
the president, are all volunteers.
There are very few student activi
ties, and these arc on an academic
basis, such as lectures by prominent
visitors.
Miss Kaufmann compared her uni- ;
versity to graduate school, where !
students arc working seriously to
ward a specific job. "They study in
tently. then go skiing or swimming i
to relax, and don't want to be bound i
by extra - curricular activities." j
Dave Penny outlined the system j
common in Australian universities. '
At his school, the University of Ade
laide, a student council of 30 car
ried on activities for the student
body of 3,000.
Modeled on the British parlia
mentary system, the student council
i elects the executive officers, such as j
I the president and treasurer.
"The treasurer always has the di
rect assistance of a professional ac- j
countant. Problems about the indc
i pendencc of the student manager
have therefore never arisen."
About Stanford's proposed Consti
-1 tution, Penny commented, "It's very
good to increase the size of the legis
lature, if for no other reason than
that more people can share Lhe j
1 work."
"I have observed Little interest!
here in what student government j
does. But then, again, student, apathy
seems to be common to universities
all over the world. Perhaps it is j
inevtablc that this would be so here,
since the living group claims first
interest," Penny said.
Eckart Rottka, from the Free Uni
; versity of Berlin, commented on the ,
i proposed constitution. "It's a very '
good improvement. The most sig
nificant feature is the real division
between the executive and the legis
lative departments." The Free Uni
versity has complete separation, with
the executive elected from the legis
lature.
Five foreign students ex
i pressed some of their views on
Stanford student government
j and the new constitution, and
I contrasted them to the forms to
which they were accustomed.
"I admire the efficiency by which
they carry out the set-up here,
though too many committees may
stand in the way," Nabila Nouhy
from Egypt remarked. "It might lead
to bureaucracy. One day there might
be more people on the committees ■
than there arc to take care of."
At. the American University of :
Cairo which she attended, a Council
of eight representatives selected j
from the classes and clubs directed
all activities. New to dorm life, she |
found that "AWS is doing a very good
job with the dorm regulations."
Doug Atkcn, graduate of Oxford,
explained how student government
operated at his alma mater. Oxford
has no central University student j
government, but works through its I
26 colleges, each about the size of
Stern Hall.
Every college has its junior com
mon room, in which each student
participates. It elects its own presi
dent, who is the direct liaison to the
administration.
When asked whether he thought,
i such a system might operate at Stan- ■
lord, Aitken decided, "It couldn t
really. It works there because life
rotates around the college, it's inte
grated in the college. With so many
off-campus students here, it wouldn't
work."
