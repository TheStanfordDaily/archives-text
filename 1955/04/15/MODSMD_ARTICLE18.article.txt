# 'Co-ordination Is Improvement'
## 
### JOANNE OLSON 
The major improvement con
tained in the proposed ASSU
Constitution, in the opinion of
National Students' Association
coordinator, A 1 Loomis, is the co
ordination which would be
made possible between the var
ious administrative boards of
ASSU.
"The major difficulty of NSA
here," Loomis said, "has been the
lack of co-ordination between the
administrative boards on campus."
The new constitution, he feels,
would largely correct this by set
ting up a cabinet composed of pres
idents of these boards.
The cabinet would have the tunc- |
tion of assisting the ASSU president j
with the executive co-ordination of J
ASSU activities and advising him
on student government and its pro
gram.
The NSA co-ordinator would be a j
voting member of the cabinet, and
also an ex-ofTicio member of the
legislature. x
The fact that the NSA co-ordina- j
tor is a member of both bodies will
give him a much better opportunity
to dispense the tremendous store of
information acquired from NSA j
conferences, Loomis pointed out.
Regarding the proposed cabinet
legislature setup, Loomis comment
ed that the new constitution would
establish an effective liaison between
the executive and legislative
branches of the government, as scv- ;
eral student officers would be mem
bers of both cabinet and legislature.
