### BOB DURAND 
Stanford's track warriors will be dressed in full war paint to
morrow as they lay in ambush for a powerful Occidental College
team in Stanford Stadium.
Oxy's Tigers, ranked as the second best cinder squad in the
country, will be a strong favorite to overcome the challenges of th .

The meet, which will get under
way at 1:30 p.m., will be the fourth
meeting between the two schools.

opponents so far this season are the
highly ranked cindermen from Ok

Stanford's record shows victories
over Fresno State and a three-way
win over Santa Clara Youth Center
and Olympic Club. Their two losses

RETURNING TIGERS
The Tigers have back a nucleus of
last year's squad that whipped the
Cards, 78-54, in a meet at Eagle
Rock. Their only important lo; es

OXY SWEEP
The Bengals .should sweep two
events. Their 880 trio should easily
outdistance any competition that
Weiershauser can muster, while in
the discus, Kolley Hester, Jim Ma
thius (brother of Stanford's Bob),
and Bob Kimball all are capable of
exceeding the Cards' best.
Incidentally, Stanford also has a
Bob Kimball competing in the discus
as well as the javelin. Oxy's Bob
Kimball will also take part in the
shot put.
The Tribe should score a sweep in [
the javelin, with Kimball, John
Bugge, and Hank Holdan receiving
the credit. Holdan should hit the
200-foot mark tomorrow which will
give the Cards three in that fate
gory.
( LOSEST RACK
One of the closest races of the day, j
oddly enough, figures to be the two- !
mile. Occidental sophomore Ed Lin
gan and Indian Wil King both have
almost identical times for the dis- |
tance and should provide a very ex- |
citing contest. |
