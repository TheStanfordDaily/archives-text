To the Editor:
While I was guiding a group of people on the ob
servation deck of the Hoover Tower, I showed the
sights looking south from the tower and a shocking
sight greeted my eyes. The sight of the olive drab
temporary buildings ruined the beauty of the land
scape. Now I realize t.t the University is low on
funds ;uid needs these temporary buildings, but they
certainly cannot call them temporary if they have
been here since World War 11.
Therefore, in view of the fact that the buildings
have become a part of the campus, and because they
are a definite eyesore both from the tower and from
below, I recommend that the University expend a
small amount of money to paint the buildings but!'
with red roofs to fit in with the rest of the Stanford
campus. This to me is not spending money for ;i
worthless purpose.
