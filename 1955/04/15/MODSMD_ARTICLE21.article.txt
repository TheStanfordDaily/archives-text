To the Editor:
I am a freshman and i agree with Mr. Winston.
Mr. Minkoff is a big fat fuddyduddy. He doesn't want
anybody to have any fun at all.
The Sunday evening flicks are a wonderful place
to have fun. I was one of the guys making funny
noises during the religious scenes of "The Jazz Sing
er." Man, i was having a crazy time.
During the week, when there aren't any flicks, i
tie tin cans on cat's tails, or steal cains away from
ofd ladies, or do a hundred other jolly tricks.
I do not know a Kadish from a radish, or a Kol
Nidre from a coal mine, or much of anything at all.
I am dumb. Bat i have fun.

"The Jazz Singer" was a good picture, i guess.
I don't know for sure. I don't usually pay attention
to the pictures. I just sit there thinking up l'unny
things to say or shout or yell. Sometimes i bring
my alarm clock.
I agree with mister Winston. We shouldn't be old
fuddyduddies like Mister Minkoff. We should have
fun. I think i am fairly tipical of Stanford students
and they are tipical of me.
1 think i'll take my alarm clock to Men Church
next Sunday mourning. It should be a kick.

To the Editor:
Don Winston's answer to Larrie Minkoff's timely
and apt criticism of the disrespect displayed during
last Sunday night's flick merely emphasizes, I think,
what Larrie feels: that is the student body is bas
ically stupid when it comes to understanding or re
specting ceremonies unfamiliar to it. Mr. Winston
feels that the Sunday night flick is an escape mechan
ism from the drudgery of normal behavior and tedious
studies throughout the week and that Larrie should
expect noise and a general letting off of steam. I
agree. Mr. Winston feels that the movie stank. I
agree. Furthermore, Mr. Winston feels that "most
Stanford students do not know a Kadish from a radish,
or the Kol Nidre from a coal mine.'" If this is true,
then things are really in a pretty sad state. So for
the benefit of those students who don't know the
differences, particularly Mr. Winston who appears
to represent this majority, I shall try briefly to ex
plain them. Kadish is a most sacred Jewish prayer
said upon the death of an immediate member of the
family. A radish is a vegetable. Kol Nidre is an
ancient ceremonial chant now used as the national
anthem of Israel. A coal mine is a hole in the ground.

1 think i'll take my alarm clock to Men Church
next Sunday mourning. It should be a kick.

To the Editor:
Don Winston's answer to Larrie Minkoff's timely
and apt criticism of the disrespect displayed during
last Sunday night's flick merely emphasizes, I think,
what Larrie feels: that is the student body is bas
ically stupid when it comes to understanding or re
specting ceremonies unfamiliar to it. Mr. Winston
feels that the Sunday night flick is an escape mechan
ism from the drudgery of normal behavior and tedious
studies throughout the week and that Larrie should
expect noise and a general letting off of steam. I
agree. Mr. Winston feels that the movie stank. I
agree. Furthermore, Mr. Winston feels that "most
Stanford students do not know a Kadish from a radish,
or the Kol Nidre from a coal mine.'" If this is true,
then things are really in a pretty sad state. So for
the benefit of those students who don't know the
differences, particularly Mr. Winston who appears
to represent this majority, I shall try briefly to ex
plain them. Kadish is a most sacred Jewish prayer
said upon the death of an immediate member of the
family. A radish is a vegetable. Kol Nidre is an
ancient ceremonial chant now used as the national
anthem of Israel. A coal mine is a hole in the ground.

To the Editor:
I am a freshman and i agree with Mr. Winston.
Mr. Minkoff is a big fat fuddyduddy. He doesn't want
anybody to have any fun at all.
The Sunday evening flicks are a wonderful place
to have fun. I was one of the guys making funny
noises during the religious scenes of "The Jazz Sing
er." Man, i was having a crazy time.
During the week, when there aren't any flicks, i
tie tin cans on cat's tails, or steal cains away from
ofd ladies, or do a hundred other jolly tricks.
I do not know a Kadish from a radish, or a Kol
Nidre from a coal mine, or much of anything at all.
I am dumb. Bat i have fun.

"The Jazz Singer" was a good picture, i guess.
I don't know for sure. I don't usually pay attention
to the pictures. I just sit there thinking up l'unny
things to say or shout or yell. Sometimes i bring
my alarm clock.
I agree with mister Winston. We shouldn't be old
fuddyduddies like Mister Minkoff. We should have
fun. I think i am fairly tipical of Stanford students
and they are tipical of me.
1 think i'll take my alarm clock to Men Church
next Sunday mourning. It should be a kick.
