1 ' n't like'to say 30, but life is hell.
' "n mat this idea is a new one with me; quite
the r~ verse.
Ny theory that life is hardly worth the
effort has been strengthened recently, as a re
sult of my experience with pipes and tobacco.
Six months ago, the thought of smoking a pipe
was as foreign to me as yo-yos are to gophers.
But that was six months ago . . .
It all started with the frosts of last autumn,
which impelled me strongly to purchase some
sort c ; oat, and I ended up with a $6.95 bar
gain colored to resemble the Ã¼biquitous "Stan
ford Jacket." The jacket, when I got it back to
the room ai:d c ould check it out carefully, ap
peared to be made from reclaimed desk blot
ters, and definitely had served as a light snack
for two moths. All of which goes to show (a)
that a 56.55 jacket is that and nothing more,
and (b) that last season must have been a rough
one for moths.
Nov; that I am readily identifiable, depend
ing on locale, as either a Stanford student or an
unden v", ate from Bellingham (Washington)
High Sc.: ul, various and sundry of the local
cognoscenti informed be that any Indian wor
thy of his Hoos megaphone was never seen
without a pipe.

Appreciating the association of rod man and
briar, I paddled down to a local commercial
venture dealing mostly in copies of Playboy
and secured a dusty pipe and a packet of do
mestic.
Shortly afterward, I found out from my coun
selors that sophisticated people, wearers of
Stanford jackets (however ersatz), smoke only
imported, high-priced tobaccos. I bit.
Six cans and about $4.75 later, I found a
Scotch blend which neither over-cured my
tonsils nor whose strength was as the strength
of ten and, rejoicing, I gave thanks, little know
ing what was to corne.
On subsequent visits, I became the posses
sor in addition of a pipe lighter (specially con
structed and not quite windproof), pipe clean
ers, flints and wicks and bug juice for the light
er, a clean peanut butter jar which serves me
for a humidor, and I only have nine more pay
ments to go on a Neolite piperack.
So, considerably embittered and exceeding
impoverished, I now find myself the owner of
one of the most expensive miniature incinera
tion systems on (or anywhere near) Quad, all
because I needed a jacket last fall . . .
Life is hell for sure.
