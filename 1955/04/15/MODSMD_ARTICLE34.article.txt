Coach Bob Renker's varsity ten
-1 nis squad journeys up to Berkeley
tomorrow to meet Cal in a match
that will determine who holds on to
third place in league play. The
match is at 1 p.m. on the Cal varsity
courts.
Going into the match both Stan
ford and Cal have identical 0-2 rec
orde in league play. On disastrous
Southland trips USC smashed Stan
ford 9-0 and Cal, 6-3. UCLA
trounced the Indians 7-2 and the
Bears were behind 4-3 when the
match was called because of dark
ness.
If he is in good form tomorrow,
| Stanford's captain Jack Frost, 12th
j ranked singles player in the U.S.,
j should have no trouble defeating his
I old rival Clif Mayne. If Frost is not
' playing well, Mayne stands a good
| chance of defeating him.
Cal's Herschel Hyde rates the edge
over Ernie Du√üray as does Bill De
! mas over Dave DufT. The Indians'
Bob Prince should beat Cal's Buzzy
Summers, but it could be a very
close match. Roger Keesing has been
playing well enough lately to rate
a slight edge over Cal's Stan Hack.
