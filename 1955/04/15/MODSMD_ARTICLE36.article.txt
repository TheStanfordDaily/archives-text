# Deanmen Face Cal Once, Santa Clara in Twin Bill
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
If Stanford is going anywhere in
the CIBA pennant chase, it'll have
to produce this weekend. One game
with California at Berkeley and two
with cellar-dwelling Santa Clara in
the Sunken Diamond at 1:30 give
the Cards a chance to stay in the
running, provided they can take at
least two of the three tilts.
California has a very strong team,
that had a very had veokend when
it lost twice to USC. The Bears
will be out to show t'ney are better
than they looked against USC and
wili be very tough to beat today, es
pecialy on their home field.
Cal is vastly improved over last
season. The Bears have two strong
pitchers to go witn Joe Gaggero and
it is not yet certain who will toe the
slab for the Bears this afternoon.
At first is A 1 Kyte, a pesky hitter;
Lloyd Canton, a newcomer, is
second; Dick Ament, shortstop, is
probably the outstanding short
patcher in the league; and at third,
Joe's brother, Ron Gaggero, has
moved out veteran Don Walker. The

| outfield is loaded. Catching is the
I only weak department.
To counter the powerful Bear hit
ters, coach Everett Dean has nomi
nated righthander Ray Young.
Young, who has apparently come
around into the form that made him
the top CIBA pitcher last season,
will be seeking his first Edwards
Field victory.
CARD SWATTERS
Stanford has five hitters over the
.3(50 mark: Rudy Figueroa at .471,
Young at .409, Len Swart/ at .371,
Rich Scramaglia at .370, and Bob
Evans at .304. These five have been
giving the Indians plenty of punch
at the plate during the last few
games.
Fielding, too, has improved along
with the hitting in the past two
weeks. Scramaglia and Holzman are
working more smoothly at second,
and Dixie Workman tightens the
outfield.
Santa Clara, beaten decisively in
! both ends of a double-header two
j weekends ago, will come into the
' Sunken Diamond tomorrow .seeking

revenge. The Broncos' Dick Simoni
is one of the top hurlers in the loop,
and is certain to see some mound
duty although he may not start. Ted
Wi'lp and Bill Carroll are other
leading Santa Clara .stars.
Walt Payne, whom the Broncs
have reason to remember, will twirl
the first contest, nine innings,
against the Jesuits. Dick Jones, Ray
Highsmiith, or Ed Verdurmen will
get the nod in the seven - inning
closer.
