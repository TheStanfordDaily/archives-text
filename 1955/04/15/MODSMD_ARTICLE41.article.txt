# Bike Shop Owner Recalls Better Days
## 
### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
Do you cuss and swear and end up five minutes late to class
trying to find a parking space on campus? Or do you spend half
your day trudging around campus with an armload of books?
There's a solution to your problems.
The solution has two wheels, handlebars, and a set of pedals—

It's called a bicycle. According to
Fred Morse, owner of the campus
bike shop, surprisingly few students
have taken advantage of this method
of locomotion. "There are only about
150 bicycles on campus now," he
said, tightening the spoke of a dis
embicycled wheel.
PARKING PROBLEM
Commenting on the campus
parking problem, Morse peered out
the window and shook his head.
"Used to be a lot more bikes on
campus," he said. "There was a time
just after the war when the bike
racks up at Lake Lag were packed
every afternoon, bikes all over the
place. I guess people have just quit
riding."
But Morse, a former student here
who runs the Campus Bicycle Shop
with his father - in - law, Charles
"Pop" Stillwel 1, says business is still
very good. All 30 of his new Eng
lish bicycles are rented out for the
quarter. "It's a cheap way to get
around," he elaborated. "We rent
'em out at $15 for the quarter."
A few of his older models were
still standing at the rack outside,
but he explained that they were
rented by the day or up for sale.
SEASONAL BUSINESS
"Business is seasonal,' too," Morse
went on. "We get more business
during the fall. We're the only place
around here that rents bikes, as far
as I know."
Most of Morse's rented machines
are used around the campus, but he
mentioned that students often take
out bikes for cross-country trips.
There's a group over in Menlo
; Park that goes almost every week
! end—clown to Carmel, around the
countryside." He pointed over in
the corner to a shiny blue two-seat
er. "Really belongs to me and my
wife, but we sometimes rent it out—
! don't get much chance to ride it
; ourselves. It's a good touring bike.
| Has eight speeds forward."
j FEW ACCIDENTS
Turning, Morse pointed to another
j corner whore a bicycle stood, its
j front wheel and fork twisted into
something which looked like a Ti
betan Ghost Trap done by Benia
mino Bufano. "Lady backed over
it,"he explained. "We don't have
too many acidents on bikes around
here."
Morse has worked at the little

shop beside the campus gas station j
since 1949, while he was going to
school here. He bought the place in
1951, has been working there ever
since.
Although he owns alt the stock !
and tools—about $3,500 at the last
inventory—the little white shack is I
rented from the University.
Strolling outside, Morse dropped
a dime in the soft-drink machine. I
As he opened the bottle, a girl came j
around the corner pushing a bike i
with a flat tire. Putting the bottle
down, he took the bicycle inside to
the bench and began taking ofT the
wheel.
"Well," he said, "that's the way it
goes—maybe some day I'll get some
time to do a little riding myself."

PARKING PROBLEM
Commenting on the campus
parking problem, Morse peered out
the window and shook his head.
"Used to be a lot more bikes on
campus," he said. "There was a time
just after the war when the bike
racks up at Lake Lag were packed
every afternoon, bikes all over the
place. I guess people have just quit
riding."
But Morse, a former student here
who runs the Campus Bicycle Shop
with his father - in - law, Charles
"Pop" Stillwel 1, says business is still
very good. All 30 of his new Eng
lish bicycles are rented out for the
quarter. "It's a cheap way to get
around," he elaborated. "We rent
'em out at $15 for the quarter."
A few of his older models were
still standing at the rack outside,
but he explained that they were
rented by the day or up for sale.
SEASONAL BUSINESS
"Business is seasonal,' too," Morse
went on. "We get more business
during the fall. We're the only place
around here that rents bikes, as far
as I know."
Most of Morse's rented machines
are used around the campus, but he
mentioned that students often take
out bikes for cross-country trips.
There's a group over in Menlo
; Park that goes almost every week
! end—clown to Carmel, around the
countryside." He pointed over in
the corner to a shiny blue two-seat
er. "Really belongs to me and my
wife, but we sometimes rent it out—
! don't get much chance to ride it
; ourselves. It's a good touring bike.
| Has eight speeds forward."
j FEW ACCIDENTS
Turning, Morse pointed to another
j corner whore a bicycle stood, its
j front wheel and fork twisted into
something which looked like a Ti
betan Ghost Trap done by Benia
mino Bufano. "Lady backed over
it,"he explained. "We don't have
too many acidents on bikes around
here."
Morse has worked at the little

shop beside the campus gas station j
since 1949, while he was going to
school here. He bought the place in
1951, has been working there ever
since.
Although he owns alt the stock !
and tools—about $3,500 at the last
inventory—the little white shack is I
rented from the University.
Strolling outside, Morse dropped
a dime in the soft-drink machine. I
As he opened the bottle, a girl came j
around the corner pushing a bike i
with a flat tire. Putting the bottle
down, he took the bicycle inside to
the bench and began taking ofT the
wheel.
"Well," he said, "that's the way it
goes—maybe some day I'll get some
time to do a little riding myself."

Do you cuss and swear and end up five minutes late to class
trying to find a parking space on campus? Or do you spend half
your day trudging around campus with an armload of books?
There's a solution to your problems.
The solution has two wheels, handlebars, and a set of pedals—

It's called a bicycle. According to
Fred Morse, owner of the campus
bike shop, surprisingly few students
have taken advantage of this method
of locomotion. "There are only about
150 bicycles on campus now," he
said, tightening the spoke of a dis
embicycled wheel.
