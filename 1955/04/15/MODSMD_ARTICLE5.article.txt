# Court Will Decide Segregation Case
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Supreme
Court's historic school segregation
arguments ended today with a final
plea by Negro groups that all racial
bars in public education be struck
down within a year.
A decision is expected sometime
before the close of the current term
of court, probably about the first of
June. It will set forth how and
when the states must comply with
the momentous ruling of last May 17
that racial segregation in public
schools is uih <>nstilti!ioh;il.
