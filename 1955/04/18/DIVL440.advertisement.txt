MECHANICAL DESIGN
ENGINEERS
Positions available for qualified me
chanical engineers: The radiation lab
oratory at Berkeley and Livermore em
ploys over 100 mechanical engineers
engaged in the design of a wide range j
of equipment for use in fundamental and j
applied scientific investigation. This |
work includes nuclear and thermo- j
nuclear test devices and instrumenta- j
tion, high energy particle accelerators, j
ultra high speed cameras, large scale
high vacuum equipment, devices for re
mote control in high radiation fields,
equipment for remote handling and
processing of radioactive materials, and
accessory equipment for nuclear reac
tors. Organization is on a project basis
with close contact between engineers
and scientists and the extensive labora
tory shops. Emphasis is not on design- i
ing for production manufacture. The \
work calls for an understanding of j
principles and ingenuity rather than the j
application of standard practices. The \
projects of the laboratory include prac- i
tically all aspects of nuclear engineer
ing.
Inquiries should be made to Mr.
James Johnson, Stanford Placement Bu
reau, or to the Professional Personnel
Office, University of California Radia
tion Laboratory, Berkeley 4, California.
