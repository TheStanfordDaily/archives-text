# Wilbur Hall Will Have Revised Sponsor Plan
## 
### JIM MORREY 
Many of the traditions and activities of the old Encina Hall will
be transferred to the new Ray Lyman Wilbur Hall when the Class
of '59 enters the new dormitory next September. But important
changes will also be made.
One of these involves the sponsors and their most important

part in the new living plan for the ]
freshmen. Each dormitory unit will
have three sponsors, one of whom j
will be the head sponsor for that (
building with the title of Senior
Sponsor. This title does not mean
that he need be a member of the
senior class. The other two sponsors
will be designated Junior Sponsors.
21 SPONSORS
Twenty-four sponsors will be cho
sen for Wilbur Hall, and two for '
Stern Hall. They will be picked on i
the basis of their interest and quali
fication. Each sponsor will be given
a single room and will have charge

All men interested in applying j
for sponsor positions may pick up j
applications at the Encina office j
this week between the hours of
B:3ft a.m. and 5 p.m. The office will
close at noon on Saturday. Ap
plications should be returned to
the Encina office at which time an
arrangement for an interview will
be made. The interviews will run
from April 25 through May 2.

of one floor of about 30 men living
in double rooms. The sponsors will
carry the full responsibility for their
individual buildings in addition to
their responsibilities in the activi
ties for Wilbur Hall as a whole, as
there will be no RA's in the hall.
Continuing in the tradition of En
cina, student government under the
leadership of the sponsors will play
a very important part in the new
residence. The freshmen will be di
vided among eight separate dormi
tory units, each housing about 90
studepts and each with its own
lounge leading into the main dining
rooms.
MAIN OFFICE
The main office will be approxi
mately in the center of the eight
units, near the dining rooms. The
director of Wilbur Hall will be Mrs.
Ellene Sumner, who is now director
of Encina. Since Wilbur Hall will
not be large enough to accommodate
all the freshman men, the remainder
of the class will live across the street
in Stern Hall, but they will eat in
one of the dining rooms at Wilbur.

director of Wilbur Hall will be Mrs.
Ellene Sumner, who is now director
of Encina. Since Wilbur Hall will
not be large enough to accommodate
all the freshman men, the remainder
of the class will live across the street
in Stern Hall, but they will eat in
one of the dining rooms at Wilbur.
Many of the traditions and activities of the old Encina Hall will
be transferred to the new Ray Lyman Wilbur Hall when the Class
of '59 enters the new dormitory next September. But important
changes will also be made.
One of these involves the sponsors and their most important

part in the new living plan for the ]
freshmen. Each dormitory unit will
have three sponsors, one of whom j
will be the head sponsor for that (
building with the title of Senior
Sponsor. This title does not mean
that he need be a member of the
senior class. The other two sponsors
will be designated Junior Sponsors.
21 SPONSORS
Twenty-four sponsors will be cho
sen for Wilbur Hall, and two for '
Stern Hall. They will be picked on i
the basis of their interest and quali
fication. Each sponsor will be given
a single room and will have charge

All men interested in applying j
for sponsor positions may pick up j
applications at the Encina office j
this week between the hours of
B:3ft a.m. and 5 p.m. The office will
close at noon on Saturday. Ap
plications should be returned to
the Encina office at which time an
arrangement for an interview will
be made. The interviews will run
from April 25 through May 2.

of one floor of about 30 men living
in double rooms. The sponsors will
carry the full responsibility for their
individual buildings in addition to
their responsibilities in the activi
ties for Wilbur Hall as a whole, as
there will be no RA's in the hall.
Continuing in the tradition of En
cina, student government under the
leadership of the sponsors will play
a very important part in the new
residence. The freshmen will be di
vided among eight separate dormi
tory units, each housing about 90
studepts and each with its own
lounge leading into the main dining
rooms.
MAIN OFFICE
The main office will be approxi
mately in the center of the eight
units, near the dining rooms. The
director of Wilbur Hall will be Mrs.
Ellene Sumner, who is now director
of Encina. Since Wilbur Hall will
not be large enough to accommodate
all the freshman men, the remainder
of the class will live across the street
in Stern Hall, but they will eat in
one of the dining rooms at Wilbur.
