# Rise Stevens to Sing Tonight
## 
### STEW TOY 
Rise Stevens appears in con
cert tonight in Memorial Audi
torium with an established repu
tation as "the greatest singing
actress of our time."
But. a generation ago, that an
American could ever be the top
primadonna of her era seemed out
of the question to an opera long en
trenched in the glories of European
tradition.
But Mi.ss Stevens' rise to an over
whelming world popularity Is as
American as her native Bronx.
Rise showed no signs of extraordi
nary gifts in her early youth, and
her parents had no aspirations for
their daughter.
Born of American and Norwegian
extraction — hence the Norwegian
name Rise—she grew up quite nor
mally, and there was no indication
that hers would be one of the most
unorthodox careers in music.
It wasn't until the family moved
to Elrnhurst, Long Island, while Rise
was in her early teens, that her vo
cal potentialities were discovered by
accident.
One day the superintendent of
schools attended the regular high
. chool singing class and interrupted
the choral singing to discover "who
produced that certain jarring
sound." It was Rise, who had unwit
tingly sung in her natural register,
an octave below the others.
When he took her aside to correct
her hb noticed that the voice showed
unusual promise. Her whole curric
ulum w.'is immediately changed, and

she attended all music classcs for the
rest of her school career.
She soon sang at weddings, fu
nerals, and parties and made her
professional debut as a primadonna
on a local radio program.
She worked her way up, still in
her middle teens, through comic op
era bit parts to a lead in "The Choc
olate Soldier." And when a music
teacher at the Juilliard School of
Music heard one of these perform
ances, she obtained a scholarship for
Rise at the famous school.
Here Rise was Lold she should
concentrate on a concert career, be
cause she didn't have quite the right
looks for opera—strange advice to
one whom Variety has called "the
sexiest dame on a screen since
Thedn Bara,"

But she refused to follow the ad
vice and learned operatic parts in
secret.
In Europe she studied under Mme.
Guttheil Schoder and Richard
Strauss, who personally coached her
for her now-famous role in "Der
Ro. enkavalicr."
Back in the United States, Rise
spurned an attractive movie con
tract to begin her career at the Met.
.She has never regretted this deci
sion, for her opera fame has brought
her starring roles in such pictures
as "The Chocolate Soldier," "Carne
gie Hall," and the Academy Award
winning "Going My Way."
Miss Stevens appeared with suc
cess in various operas, but it was not
until she disregarded the advice of
the Met's management that she
achieved her greatest triumph: "Car
men."

"Voi Che Sapcte" from Mozart's
"Marriage of Figaro," "Where Ere
You Walk" by Handel, Wolff's "All
Things Have Speech," "Mon Coeur
Suivrc a ta Voix" from Saint-Saens'

of folk songs by Edvard Grieg.
She will also sing three arias from
"Carmen," in addition to works by
Richard Strauss and several French
and English composers.
