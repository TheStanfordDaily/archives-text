# Student Found Guilty of Honor Code Violation
## 
### 
The Council for Student Control
recently found a history student
guilty of an Honor Code violation,
giving the student an F in the course
on the grounds that consulting rele
vant material during an exam, re
gardless of intent to cheat, consti
tutes an Honor Code violation.
*
Because of special circumstances
involving illness, the Council did
not feel that this violation warranted
removal from the University.
The Council did feel, though, that
consulting material during an exam
violates the privileges of the Honor
Code, which thus, in fact, constitutes
a violation of the Honor Code.
Although the student testified that
no material referred to was used in
the exam, the Council stated that
any reference to material during an
exam would give a student an "un
due advantage" over other students.
