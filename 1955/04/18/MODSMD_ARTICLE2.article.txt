# More Changes Are Made In Proposed Constitution
## 
### BILL WRIGHT Associate Editor, The Daily 
The ASSU Executive Committee held an emergency meeting
yesterday afternoon to make last minute changes in the proposed
new constitution. Nine members of Excom were on hand to dis
cuss corrections recommended by the Law School and the Political
Science Department.
The newly-altered version will go to a student referendum to
morrow and Wednesday with a two-+~

thirds vote required for passage.
The constitution which will be
voted upon is printed in its en
tirety on page 5 of today's Daily.
The present constitution is on page
4. To comply with ASSU constitu
tional requiremens, both will be
printed again tomorrow.
CLOSED MEETINGS
One of the main problems dis
cussed yesterday was whether or not
to allow the legislature to meet in
executive session (i.e., a closed
meeting).
Proponents of executive sessions
felt that closed meetings are neces
sary in student government because
of the personalities' involved. The
opposite view was that closed meet
ings restrict the democratic process
and make it more difficult to make
the legislature responsible to the
electorate.
A compromise was reached by
making the rules for executive ses
sion (Article 111, Section 4) more
stringent. A motion for executive
session is debatable and must have
a three-fourths vote to pass. Any
votes taken in the executive session
will be roll call votes, and they
will be in the minutes.
Article IV on the judiciary was
subjected to two important revis
ions. An addition to section 1, (d)
permits a student to appeal a de
cision of the Judicial Council to the
President of the University or his
representative.
TEMPORARY COUNCILS
Section 2 under Article IV was
altered to allow the Judicial Council
to establish temporary subordinate
judicial councils. The period of ex
istence" of these temporary councils
is to be determined by the legisla
ture.
Another problem arose over an in
consistency in the power granted the
administrative boards to recommend
to the legislature measures for their
own administration. .A sentence (the

; first sentence of Article 11, Section
4, paragraph 4 of the version printed
| Thursday) was deleted so that
i boards "shall make decisions for . . .
| administration of the activities with
in their jurisdiction" subject to the
j legislature's approval.
Another change eliminated the
! legislature as an enforcer of the

; rules of the Students' Organization
| Fund (Article 11, Section 6, part c,
| subsection 1). The president, the
j financial director, and the financial
i manager have that responsibility.
MAJORITY VOTE
The cabinet's power to establish
temporary advisory committees was
clarified. They are to be established
by majority vote of the cabinet
(Article 11, Section 3, part b).
The president was given the re
sponsibility of reporting to the legis
| laturc both his and the cabinet's
recommendation (Article 11, section
2, part a, paragraph 6).
The methods of changing the by
laws by three-fourths vote of the
legislature was clarified. The word
j ing now states that it is to be a
three-fourths vote of the members
present (Article VIII, section 1).
