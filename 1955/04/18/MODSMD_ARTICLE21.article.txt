# Russians Say Editors Won't Come to U.S.
## 
### BILL WRIGHT Associate Editor, The Daily 
As it appears now, the 11 Russian newspaper editors definitely
aren't coming to Stanfordâ€”or the United States.
The principle issue seems to hinge over the matter of finger
printing the Russians in accordance with United States immigra
tion laws. But many United States officials feel the principle

issue is purely propaganda.
The Soviet group was scheduled
to arrive in New York on the Queen
Elizabeth tomorrow for a 30-day
tour of the country. They were to
have been at Stanford May 2 through
4.
Russia announced Saturday that
the college and youth newspaper
editors had been "deprived of the
opportunity" of visiting the United
States because the U.S. insisted on
fingerprinting the Russians.
DIPLOMATS EXCEPTED
The State Department replied
that fingerprinting is required of
all entrants to this country except
diplomats.
Russia countered by claiming that
the Russian professors and chess
players who came to the United
States last year were not finger
printed. The State Department said
this was an oversight.
The Russians also rebelled at the
standard phrase in immigration
forms which says the trip would be
at the Russians' "own risk."
Some U.S. officials said they
thought Moscow never wanted the
editors to visit the country and used
the fingerprinting issue as an "ex
cuse" to try to pin an "Iron Curtain '
label on the United States.
However, the United States quoted
Rep. E. Y. Berry (R-S.D.) yester
day as saying that when the Rus
sians are through with the propa
ganda aspect, they may later "find
a means of stepping out of it and
letting the editors come."
STANFORD TOUR
Stanford administrators and stu
dents had planned a special tour
for the Russians in conjunction with
the Institute of International Educa
tion, which was to administer the
trip.
According to Frederic O. Glover,
assistant to the President, these plans
are flexible and modifications would
be possible if the Russians should
come at a later date.
ASSU President Pete Bing, who
wps one of those arranging the Stan
ford tour, commented that he whs
disappointed that the Russian weren't
coming, "particularly in view of the
stand the Executive Committee took
earlier in the year." Exoom passed
a resolution urging the State De
partment to grant visas to the edi
tors.
Bing added, "I still have hope
they will visit the United States
and Stanford at least next year if
not at this time."
