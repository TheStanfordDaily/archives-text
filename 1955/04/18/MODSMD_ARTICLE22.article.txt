### 
To the Editor:
I wish to thank the Stanford. Student Body for its
help in making "Sentimental Journey" the most suc
cessful Junior Prom ever held at Stanford. Unfortun
ately, due to the size of the ciowd the traffic situation
after the dance was something that could not be
helped. Anticipating the unexpected problem of gat

ing the girls home on time, we ended the dance one J
half hour early and called all the women's dorms I
telling them of the situation. Even so we understand j
that many'girls received lock-outs. We are extremely
sorry about this, and have explained the situation j
to the proper authorities and understand that due j
consideration will be taken. Again we want to thank 1
you for your attendance. j
JIM PINGREE
Prom Chairman.
