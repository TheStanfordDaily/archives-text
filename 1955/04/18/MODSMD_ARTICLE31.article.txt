# Cards Lose to Cal, Whip Broncs Twice
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
Stanford remained in third place in the CIBA race as they won
two and lost one ball game. Stanford now has a 5-3 record behind
UCLA with 4-2 and USC with 7-1. California dropped the Indians
8-4 on Friday, but the Cards bounced back to sweep the Saturday
doubleheader from Santa Clara 3-2, and 4-1.
California treated Ray Young very roughly as they banged him

For 11 solid hits. Young wasn't"
helped by the shaky outfield support
that he got either. Three of the Card
miscues eame in the outer gardens,
apparently from failure in knowing
how to play balls off walls, Dixie
Workman and Sid Hall had errors,
and Bob Evans let a ball get by him
that was a "mental error" double.
The Bears scored two in the sec
ond inning on one hit. A ground out
brought in one and a wild throw by
Rich Scramaglia permitted the sec
ond Bear tally. Lloyd Canton's
double past Evans in the third
scored A 1 Kyte from first to boost
the Bear margin.
CARDS Tlti IT
Three straight Berkeley hits made
it 4-0 in the fourth, but Stanford's
lone offensive outburst of the day

came in the fifth. Bob Evans started
things off when he was safe on an
error. Workman singled, Hal Mess
ner v/alked to load up the bases,
and then Ray Young lined a 0 and
two pitch to right for two tallies.
Sid Hall struck out, but Mickey
Holzman walked and Rich Scrama
glia's fly and Rudy Figueroa's single
added two more scores. Then Len
Swartz was purposely, passed, and
Bob Evans grounded out to second
to end the rally.
Three hits, a walk, and an error
clinched the game for Cal in the
seventh. Stanford managed only six
singles off Blue and Gold hurler
Doug Weiss, who is only a sopho
more. Workman collected two of
these.
PAYNE AGAIN
The Cards triumphed over Santa
Clara 3-2 in the nine-inning game
on Saturday. Walt Payne and Ray
Stanley hooked up in a terrific duel,
which threatened to go into extra
innings until Hal Messner unloaded
a long triple to'left center with one
out in the bottom of th ninth to

score Workman from first base.
Payne allowed eight Bronc hits and
struck out seven; Stanley only
whiffed two, but gave up a meager
five bingles.
One of these Card hits, grouped
with a walk, error, and two sacri
fices, gave Stanford two runs in the
third, but Santa Clara set the stage
for Messner by scoring a duo of
their own in the seventh with two
hits, a walk, and a sacrifice.
SWARTZ SQUEEZES
The second game was over almost
before it started. Ray Noonan start
ed for Santa Clara and threw nine
straight balls, the last being a wild
pitch. Dick Simoni, who then re
lieved him, came in with runners
on second and third. He allowed an
infield single to Scramaglia, but the
other two runners could not ad
vance. A wild pitch tallied one and
a squeeze bunt by Lcn Swartz
brought Bob Fletcher across.
The Broncs scored a lone run in
the third, but Figueroa's two-run
triple in the fifth clinched the seven
inning game. Ed Verdurmen went
the distance for Stanford and al
lowed only three hits in his first
league start.
