# Indians Edged By Oxy, 66-65
## 
### BOB DURAND 
Stanford's track warriors lay in ambush Saturday hoping to up
set a favored Occidental squad at Stanford Stadium.
The Oxy Tigers, who were seeking to protect their ranking of
the number two track team in the country, were stunned by the
determined bunch of Indians but then recovered to take advantage

of a couple of breaks and barely
pull the meet out of the fire, 66-65.
With three events to go in the
competition, the score was tied at
54 points apiece. The Tribe hopes
were not too high at that moment
after Oxy's Bill Carling had edged
a favored Keith Brownsberger in
in the 220-yard dash.
The next race was the two-mile
run in which the Cards were hop
ing for a second. This coupled with
a first in the low hurdles and the
outside chance of a relay victory
would have meant a Stanford win.
During the first five laps of the
grueling distance race, four run
ners—two from each team —kept
bunched close together. Then In-

dian Chuck Strong started to kick
out and pulled away from the pack.
Strong, who had never done bet
ter than 9:44.4 in the event, did
not fade as many observers thought
he would. Instead he pulled steadily
ahead and soon was followed by
teammate Wil King.
STKONG SURPRISES
With the many Tribe rooters roar
ing their approval, the amazing
Strong, smiling from ear to ear,
broke the tape in 9:25.5, 40 yards
ahead of King. Both Cards were
well in front of Oxy's Bei*t Stokes
bary.
For those next few minutes until
the next race, excitement was at its
peak. Tine Stanfords only needed
four points to win the meet. Either a
first or a second and third in the
low hurdles would do it.
The race was close. But the Card
faithful were quiet, for their hope
in the event, Jim Luttrell, had faded
in the last ten yards, and had fin
ished fourth. Bernie Nelson ran his
best race ever to save a second and
three points for the Indians, but it
wasn't enough.
Stanford's relay chances were slim
since Myron Hollister was still nurs
ing a muscle pull and Larry Spicer
had cramped his leg in the pre-meet
warmup.
Coach Jack Weiershauser, in an
effort to come up with a possible
winning combination, juggled his
men around until he came up with
broad jumper Jim Seebold and
sprinter Bob Hyde to run with
Brownsberger and anchor man Walt
Garrett.
DEFEAT IN RELAY
However, his efforts were in vain
as the visiting Tigers built up such
a lead in the first three laps that
they captured the victory despite an
outstanding :47.0 run by Garrett.
Needless to say the five points gave
Occidental enough to win the meet
—by one point.
