# Card Mermen Dump Cal, Heim Sets PCC Record
## 
### JIM BAKER 
Led by Larry Heim's new PCC record in the 150 yard individual
medley, Stanford's defending PCC champion swimming team
whipped Cal Saturday afternoon in the Encina pool 43-31. Heim
swam the distance in 1:29.1, to better his previous best of 1 ;31.7.
The Stanford mermen took only half of the first places, but used

their superior depth to make the"*
difference in winning their second
straight meet.
One of the bright spots of the
meet was frosh Robin Moore's 51.1-
second victory in the 100-yard free
style in the frosh meet.
Junior Phil Gay also turned in a
top performance, winning the 50-
yard freestyle in 24.0.
