# Campus Publicity Applications Due
## 
### 
Public Relations Board has asked
that all requests for u.se of campus
publicity media for this quarter be
turned in.
Because of the number of organi
zational functions this quarter, those
groups may find that the banner,
silk .screen, and poster locations are
not available when they want them,
unless they apply now. The policy
is fir.st come, first served.
