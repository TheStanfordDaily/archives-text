# Revision: Students Give Views
## 
### 
In an effort to ascertain public
opinion on the proposed ASSU
Constitution, the Daily recently
conducted a campus opinion
poll in which various students
were interviewed concerning
their opinions on the document,
which will be'put before the stu
dents in a referendum tomorrow
and Wednesday.
The following represents a tele
scoped view of each of the students'
views on the proposed draft:
Ann Irvine, '55 . . . the proposed
constitution would enable student
government to work much more ef
ficiently, especially in that there will
be an assistant to the president . . .
an excellent idea to have all the
heads of hoards together to bring
co-ordination.
John Sullivan, '58 . . . the legis
lature under the proposed constitu
tion should have a check: it should
n't be able to override the student
manager.
Liz Livadary, '55 . . . it would
provide more student participation
in school government . . . more
functional balance between judicial
bodies and elimination of much red
tape by reorganizing all existing
committees into boards or commis
sions . . . student government will
be mol-e meaningful and workable.
Boh Norman, '5(5 . . . the proposed
constitution is much stronger from
the administrative standpoint . . .
it will be much easier on the presi
dent . . . cabinet means better co
ordination between organizations
concerned with day-to-day activi
ties and student government as a
whole.
Colleen Baker, '56 . . . cabinet will
be excellent in aiding the president
. . . new idea of representation much
better because the living group rep
resentatives are much closer to their
constituents than class representa
tives.
Dave Jcnks, '57 . . . proposed con
stitution achieves neither the goal
of an ideal constitution nor a con
stitution for the college level . . .
will make student government con
fusing . . . defeating purpose when
cabinet larger than legislature.
Boh McClure, '58 . , . the new
constitution decreases the efficiency
and increases the mess . . . the
powers of an impartial business
manager should not be limited by
political faction.
Eileen Conaghan, '56 . . . division
of the executive and legislative
branches is the greatest merit of
the draft . . . assistants to the presi
dent and the cabinet, which will co
ordinate student activities and serve
as advisory board, are a groat im
provement, . . . more efficient gov
ernment with better representation.
Ed Bordenkrrcher, '58 . . . the best
thing about the new constitution Ls
the improvement made in the legis
lature . . . the weak Excom now
gives no true representation . . . the
new system will provide a really
representative showing.
Tom I)ant, '57 . . . new constitu
tion provides too much power under
the president's office ... in the
eventuality of a weak president, a
strong student manager is needed
and the office of the student mana
ger is so ambiguous that his posi
tion is weakened . . . the legislature
is too large.
