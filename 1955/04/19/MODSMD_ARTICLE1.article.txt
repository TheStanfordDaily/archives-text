# Coed Dies on Mountain Climb
## 
### 
Anne R. Pottinger, a 19-year
old Stanford sophomore who
lived at the Oaks, died late Sun
day night while . descending
from a climb to the summit of
Higher Cathedral Spire in Yo
semite National Park.
Reports from Chief Park Ranger
Oscar Sedergrcn indicated that Miss
Pott.in.g6r apparently died of a com
bination of exposure, exhaustion,
and shock.
Another Stanford sophomore, Irene
Bcaidsley, was with Miss Pottinger
when she died. The third member
of the party, Jack Weicker. who
graduated from Stanford in 1953, had
gone for help.
All three climbers have been af
filiated with Stanford Alpine Club.
Ail sources emphasized that the
climb was a private project and not
an official Alpine Club venture.
Neither Weicker nor Miss Beards
ley was immediately available to
supply information, but details of the
climb were supplied to Chief Coun
sellor for Women Elva F. Brown and
Alpine Ciub President Bob Brooke
by Scdergren.

The party of three signed out for
a climb of the Higher Cathedral
Spire, which rises 2,500 feet above
the Yosemite Valley floor, Saturday
night. Sunday morning the weather
was slightly rainy, which, according
to Brooke, put the climbers behind
in their schedule.
Led by Weicker, the partly suc
cessfully reached the summit of the
spire and started down. Some time
between 7 and 8 p.m., they had
reached the talus at the foot of the
main spire, some 1500 feet rbove the
valley floor. Here Miss Pottinger
complained of extreme weariness.
Some indication was given that
Weicker may have stayed with the
party briefly, but at about 8 p.m. he
started for help, leaving Miss Beards
ley and Miss Pottinger together.
Rain had fallen in a steady drizzle
all day, and had turned to snow
about dark. The temperature t at this
time was about 24 degrees above
zero. Sedergren indicated, however,

that this was not unusually cold for
the area.
Weicker reached the ranger sta
tion at 10:25 p.m. A party of seven
rangers went back up the spire,
reaching the two women at about 1
a.m. Miss Pottinger was dead when
the rangers arrived.
All sources emphasized that there
was no fall or any kind of accident
involved.
Commenting on the tragedy,
Brooke pointed out that Weicker had
been a qualified leader in the Alpine
Club since 1952 (he is a past vice
president of the club), and had
climbed the spire four times prev
iously. Both women were "qualified
by the club to climb second," Brooke
said.
DIFFICULT CLIMR
Brooke termed the climb "tech
nically difficult but not what I'd call
long or arduous." The route from
the talus slope to the ranger station
is about four miles long and rocky,
and Brooke pointed out that it would
be "very hard lo move over that kind
of territory after dark." He also in
dicated that Weicker was apparently
himself quite weary at this time.
"Weicker is defintely a competent
leader," Brooke said.
Early reports were that neither
Weicker nor Miss Beardsley suffered
any serious ill effects.
A memorial service will be held for
Miss Pottinger Friday at 3 p.m. in
Memorial Church. Chaplain Philip
Bentley USN, of the United States
Naval Hospital at Oakland, will con
duct the service, assisted by David
H. Romeis, Assistant to Stanford
Chaplain R. M. Minto.
Funeral arrangements are to be
made by Roller and Hapgood in Palo
Alto.
Miss Pottipger was the daughter
of William K. Pottinger of the United
States Marines, who is stationed at
Cherry Point, North Carolina.

All three climbers have been af

Ail sources emphasized that the
climb was a private project and not
an official Alpine Club venture.
Neither Weicker nor Miss Beards

Alpine Ciub President Bob Brooke
by Scdergren.

The party of three signed out for
a climb of the Higher Cathedral
Spire, which rises 2,500 feet above
the Yosemite Valley floor, Saturday
night. Sunday morning the weather
was slightly rainy, which, according
to Brooke, put the climbers behind
in their schedule.
Led by Weicker, the partly suc
cessfully reached the summit of the
spire and started down. Some time
between 7 and 8 p.m., they had
reached the talus at the foot of the
main spire, some 1500 feet rbove the
valley floor. Here Miss Pottinger
complained of extreme weariness.
Some indication was given that
Weicker may have stayed with the
party briefly, but at about 8 p.m. he
started for help, leaving Miss Beards
ley and Miss Pottinger together.
Rain had fallen in a steady drizzle
all day, and had turned to snow
about dark. The temperature t at this
time was about 24 degrees above
zero. Sedergren indicated, however,

that this was not unusually cold for
the area.
Weicker reached the ranger sta
tion at 10:25 p.m. A party of seven
rangers went back up the spire,
reaching the two women at about 1
a.m. Miss Pottinger was dead when
the rangers arrived.
All sources emphasized that there
was no fall or any kind of accident
involved.
Commenting on the tragedy,
Brooke pointed out that Weicker had
been a qualified leader in the Alpine
Club since 1952 (he is a past vice
president of the club), and had
climbed the spire four times prev
iously. Both women were "qualified
by the club to climb second," Brooke
said.
DIFFICULT CLIMR
Brooke termed the climb "tech
nically difficult but not what I'd call
long or arduous." The route from
the talus slope to the ranger station
is about four miles long and rocky,
and Brooke pointed out that it would
be "very hard lo move over that kind
of territory after dark." He also in
dicated that Weicker was apparently
himself quite weary at this time.
"Weicker is defintely a competent
leader," Brooke said.
Early reports were that neither
Weicker nor Miss Beardsley suffered
any serious ill effects.
A memorial service will be held for
Miss Pottinger Friday at 3 p.m. in
Memorial Church. Chaplain Philip
Bentley USN, of the United States
Naval Hospital at Oakland, will con
duct the service, assisted by David
H. Romeis, Assistant to Stanford
Chaplain R. M. Minto.
Funeral arrangements are to be
made by Roller and Hapgood in Palo
Alto.
Miss Pottipger was the daughter
of William K. Pottinger of the United

Cherry Point, North Carolina.
