### BILL WRIGHT Associate Editor, The Daily 
A proposed now ASSU constitution will be voted upon in a long
planned student referendum today and tomorrow. To pass, it
must be approved by two-thirds of the voters.
The new draft, which is the product of a year of work by the
Executive Committee, would completely replace the present con-
fstitution.

Polls will be open today arid to
morrow at Engineering Con*r and
in the Village. Engineering Corner
voting booths will be open today
from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The Vil
lage booth will be open from 11 a.m.
to 1 p.m.
There will be an additional booth
open tonight at the Main Library
from 7 to 9.
The hours tomorrow will be 8:30
a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at Engineering Cor
ner and 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the
Village.
RESULTS
The results of the referendum will
i be posted cm the door of the Exconi
room in the Union Building tomo l
j row afternoon.
j If the proposed constitution pas:
j today and tomorrow, the ptea
j Excom would be replaced by

larger legislature, a cabinet would
be created for administrative co
ordination, and many other parts of
the student government would be
altered.
Transitional arrangements ar»
provided in the proposed constitu
tion should it pass (Article X, sec
tion 3). Excom would asume the
functions of the newly created leg
islature. Its first duty would be to
provide for the election and assump
tion of office of the new members
of the legislature.
CONTINUE FUNCTIONS
All existing organizations and or-
of the current student govern
ment would continue their current
functions until the legislature (or
Excom acting as the new legisla-*
ture) changes them by by-law.
The creation of a whole new set of
by-laws for the ASSU would be be
gun immediately by Excom. Presi
dent Pete Bing said last week that
he didn't think the new by-laws
would be completed by the end of
the quarter.
Plans for the constitution change
were begun last spring when Ex
com established a special Cbmmittee
on Student Government headed by
Harrison Schmidt.

In accordance with the ASSU
constitution, the- proposed new
constitution which will be voted
upon today and tomorrow is
printed in its entirety on page 5.
As a comparison, the present con
stitution is pritned on page 1.
