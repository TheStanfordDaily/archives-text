# Cal, Oregon, Stanford Constitutions Compared
## 
### MARY ELLEN ROMNEY 
Stanford isn't the only univer
sity that has felt the need for a
revised constitution in the last
several years. Both the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley
and the University of Oregon
have recently adopted new
frameworks for their student
government.
University student governments
seem to be of an extremely flexible
nature, eacli school adopting what
works best in its particular case.
UC has an unusual plan, with
some similarity to Stanford's exist
ing organization. Oregon, on the
other hand, has a system very simi
lar to the proposed ASSU constitu
tion.
At Cal, a lfi-member Executive
Committee is the group with final
legislative and executive authority.
This committee is Composed of the
Student Association president, two
vice - presidents, eight representa
tives-at-large, an alumni represen
tative, a • faculty representative, a
University Chancellor's representa
tive, and a men's and a women's re
rcsentativc. There are also eight
non-voting members of the Execu
tive Committee — primarily the
chairmen of major boards, and the
Daily Californian editor.
CAL ORGANIZATION
Some of the administrative re
sponsibility at Cal is dejegated to
several subordinate committees,
such as an Activities Planning Com
mittee, a Student Financial Commit
tee, a Student Judicial Committee,
and a series of boards, representing
large groups of organizations.
The UC plan combines the func
tions of government, with almost no
separation of powers. The Associ
ated Students' president is given a
high degree of responsibility as the
perron to whom all appointees, in
cluding the heads of boards, are re
sponsible.
At the University of Oregon, the

branches of government are more
clearly separated. The Association
president, vice - president, and the
non-elective officers form a cabinet,
which is the executive arm of the
government, while an elected senate
is the sole legislative body.
30-MAN SENATE
This senate has 30 members, in
cluding the president, vice - presi
dent, class officers, two representa
tives from each class, nine members
elected at large, two faculty mem
bers, and one graduate student rep
resentative.
As at Cal, the judiciary consists of
an appointed court, in contrast to
the elected Men's and Women's
Council at Stanford.
The Oregon plan has the same di
vision of powers as the proposed
Stanford ASSU constitution. In both,
an elected representative body has
complete legislative power, and the
chief executive has an advisory cab
inet to aid administration.
Stanford's financial provisions arc
more complex than Oregon's, how
ever, in the proposed plan. More
expert, non-political financial ad
ministration is possible under Stan
ford's constitution, where an appoin
tive Student Financial Manager is
directly responsible to the Univer
sity Financial Director.
FACULTY MEMBERS
On both UC's Excutive Commit
tee and Oregon's senate, there are
two faculty members who are vot
ing members of the legislative body.
Cal also has an alumni representa
tive, appointed by the Alumni Asso
ciation, who is a voting member of
the Executive Committee.
In contrast, Stanford has no fac
ulty or administration representa
tives in its student government.
Stanford's Judicial Council also has
broader jurisdiction than cither of
the state universities.
An interesting feature of Califor
nia's constitution is the require
ment that all candidates for stu
dent offices "pass a written exami
nation on the organization and ac
tivities of the Association."
In general, Stanford's proposed
plan would have the same degree of
separation of powers and elected
representation as Oregon, with
financial direction similar to Cali
fornia.
The new Stanford constitution
would follow (he trend of both to
ward a centralized government, with
a higher degree of board control,
and fewer appointive officers.

Student Association president, two
vice - presidents, eight representa
tives-at-large, an alumni represen
tative, a • faculty representative, a
University Chancellor's representa

rcsentativc. There are also eight
non-voting members of the Execu

chairmen of major boards, and the
Daily Californian editor.
CAL ORGANIZATION
Some of the administrative re
sponsibility at Cal is dejegated to
several subordinate committees,
such as an Activities Planning Com
mittee, a Student Financial Commit
tee, a Student Judicial Committee,
and a series of boards, representing
large groups of organizations.
The UC plan combines the func
tions of government, with almost no
separation of powers. The Associ
ated Students' president is given a
high degree of responsibility as the
perron to whom all appointees, in
cluding the heads of boards, are re
sponsible.
At the University of Oregon, the

branches of government are more
clearly separated. The Association
president, vice - president, and the
non-elective officers form a cabinet,
which is the executive arm of the
government, while an elected senate
is the sole legislative body.
30-MAN SENATE
This senate has 30 members, in
cluding the president, vice - presi
dent, class officers, two representa
tives from each class, nine members
elected at large, two faculty mem
bers, and one graduate student rep
resentative.
As at Cal, the judiciary consists of
an appointed court, in contrast to
the elected Men's and Women's
Council at Stanford.
The Oregon plan has the same di
vision of powers as the proposed
Stanford ASSU constitution. In both,
an elected representative body has
complete legislative power, and the
chief executive has an advisory cab
inet to aid administration.
Stanford's financial provisions arc
more complex than Oregon's, how
ever, in the proposed plan. More
expert, non-political financial ad
ministration is possible under Stan
ford's constitution, where an appoin
tive Student Financial Manager is
directly responsible to the Univer
sity Financial Director.
FACULTY MEMBERS
On both UC's Excutive Commit
tee and Oregon's senate, there are
two faculty members who are vot
ing members of the legislative body.
Cal also has an alumni representa
tive, appointed by the Alumni Asso
ciation, who is a voting member of
the Executive Committee.
In contrast, Stanford has no fac
ulty or administration representa
tives in its student government.
Stanford's Judicial Council also has
broader jurisdiction than cither of
the state universities.
An interesting feature of Califor
nia's constitution is the require
ment that all candidates for stu
dent offices "pass a written exami
nation on the organization and ac
tivities of the Association."
In general, Stanford's proposed
plan would have the same degree of
separation of powers and elected
representation as Oregon, with
financial direction similar to Cali
fornia.
The new Stanford constitution
would follow (he trend of both to
ward a centralized government, with
a higher degree of board control,
and fewer appointive officers.
Stanford isn't the only univer
sity that has felt the need for a
revised constitution in the last
several years. Both the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley
and the University of Oregon
have recently adopted new
frameworks for their student
government.
University student governments
seem to be of an extremely flexible
nature, eacli school adopting what
works best in its particular case.
UC has an unusual plan, with
some similarity to Stanford's exist
ing organization. Oregon, on the
other hand, has a system very simi
lar to the proposed ASSU constitu
tion.
At Cal, a lfi-member Executive
Committee is the group with final
legislative and executive authority.
This committee is Composed of the
Student Association president, two
vice - presidents, eight representa
tives-at-large, an alumni represen
tative, a • faculty representative, a
University Chancellor's representa
tive, and a men's and a women's re
