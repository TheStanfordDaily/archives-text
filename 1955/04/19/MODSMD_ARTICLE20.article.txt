# Weak Dam Causes Low Lake Level
## 
### DICK MEISTER 
Unless the rains come down,;
Lake Lagunita's waters will van- j
ish. In fact, they may dry up
belore the end of spring quar-1
ter, according to Carroll L.
Blacker, University superintend
ent of buildings and grounds.
Graphs in the superintendent's of
fices show that the lake's level is
rapidly going dov/n and will con
tinue to do so unless the water sup
ply is replenished by some steady
rainfall.
Last year at this time the level
was almost five feet higher than at
present but this was because Uni-,
versity workmen had pumped in ad
ditional water.
However, Blacker explains, this
method of refilling the,lake can't be
used again since there is a seepage
in the lake dam. Unless the dam
is either repaired or replaced ac
cording to California state require
ments Blacker predicts that the lake
will not be used until such work is
done.
STATE WANTS I)AM
The State wants a dam and spill
way which will make certain that I
there would bo no water seepage
should Lagunita's level go higher
because of rains or heavy unseason
able storms.
Seraphim F. Post, Stanford assist
ant business manager, says that the
University plans to hold the level
down in compliance with state re
quirements and says that plans are
pending for a meeting with Califor
nia officials. Slated for discussions
at this meeting are plans for what
can be done to raise the level.
Keeping the level down, in ac
cordance with dam facilities, is a
safety measure.
SAFETY FACTOR
"We must take less chances and
have more and more regulations as
the community builds up, and right
ly so," is Post's comment on the j
safety factor involved.
So far, according to Post, the Uni- j
versity has asked, but instead of j
lowering the lake's level they are '
keeping it as it is, at a constantly |
declining level. At. the meeting with
state officials the University hopes
to get the go-ahead on raising the
level to the old height, which is
normally about five feet higher than
now at this time of year.
''The University will try to bring
Lagunita's level up and if they can't
it will be due to not being able to
raise the money which would be
needed to meet state requirements,"
Post commented.
MONEY PROBLEM
If Stanford does have to meet state
clam building or repairing require
ments the question will be, as Post
puts it, "Where do we get the mon
ey?"
Post assures that the University
will do all it. can to keep the lake
a part of life on the Farm, pointing
out that it adds color to the cant pus
and is a recreation area for all. He
adds that it has another beneficial
aspect, of replenishing the Univer
sity's underground water supply.
"The state would like to see cer
tain changcs, which we will make if i
obliged, but we want to hold on to |
the past and so we're now in a proc- |
ess of reconciling our differences j
with the state," Post noted.
Lake Lagunita has been a part of I
the Stanford scene for many years i
and Post, among many others, would
like to sec it stay.
