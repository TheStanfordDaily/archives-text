Last week, the University of Southern Cali
fornia, under the leadership of the managing
editor of the Daily Trojan, inaugurated a cam
paign to "ride a bike to school."
To encourage students to participate, the
Daily Trojan printed lists of all the advantages
of cycling and in a recent article pointed out
that bicycling really was "voguish." "Why,"
the Trojan said, "there are bicycle traffic jams
at many colleges from Yale and Mount Hol
yoke to Illinois and Stanford."
The University of Washington Daily reported
the completion of a university lighting project.
"New mercury vapor lights will be used," the
paper said, "and will do much to brighten
campus walks and aim thejiopes of countless

numbers of sweethearts."
Even airlines lose luggage, according to the
Colorado Daily.
Dave Brubeck and his quartet were sched
uled to present a concert at the University of
Colorado recently. However, at concert-time,
a rather serious loss was reported. No instru
ments. They had gotten onto the wrong plane.
Colorado students found "other" instruments
for the frustrated quartet, the paper reported,
but the quartet, who had grown "sensitive" to
ward their own playing equipment, weren't too
happy.
However, the Daily stated, in its review of
the concert, that it was good despite the mixup.
(Even the piano stayed in tune part of the time,
they said.)
