So Let's Go Sesquipedalian
(Not to be confused with sexquipaaian which
is not a word, but a typographical error)
(The author kind of figures that Stanford stu
dents know lots of big words, but just don't use
them of .en enough. Kind of figuring this, he
has decided to start a sesquipedalian club.
Won't you join him?)
Everywhere I go, 1 hear students saying,
Would y like to go to a movie Saturday
night?' "How are you feeling . . . ?" or
other sucn uneducated forms of statement . . .
far below Ihe level of a to-be-enlightened Stan
ford rough. Eelow I have listed several widely
used expressions, and their sesquipedalian
equivalents:
"Want to walk up to the P. 0.?" . . . Would
il be in the realm of conception that you might
have a preconditioned disposition to assay a
r;ojourn to tho locale of the transient habitat of
'"pistelian tangibles?

"I'm going to a flick tonight." ... I should
trust credence at the- supposition that I possess
an emotional exigency immediately directed
at fulfillment by means of absorbing the va
garies of the cinematic universe inherent in
films producing the illusion of motion at the
theater when obscuration gravitates.
"She's a great gal." ... It is more unerring
than molecular conjecture that I subscribe
credence to the tenet, and I do not have the
tendency to assume an eleemosynary nature
when I broach this matter, that this damsel has
tenancy to extraordinary graces . . .
"I think alligators are fun You do?
"I flunked again Once more an
additive to my dereliction has betided my veg
etation.
Well, you've got the picture. I can only hope
you'll join in this pedantic approach to vocal
ization. And since this wraps it up, I'll just end
with . . . my orbital sense psreeptors will
descry your countenances at the enclave to
v/hich is unconditionally appropriated the ap
pellation of the Quadrangle (see you on Quad).
