# Coro Foundation Trains Students For Government, Business, Labor
## 
### PAT KING 
The successful businessman,
politician, government official,
and labor leader all have one
thing in common — a thorough
understanding of public affairs
and the interrelationship of
these four fields.
This is the basic assumption un
derlying the program sponsored by
the Coro Foundation of San Fran
cisco. This explains the fact that
each September, 12 college gradu
ates begin a nine months' intern
ship designed to give them an in
tensive study of government, busi
ness, and labor.
The name "Coro" itself has no
special significance. It was deliber
ately chosen by the founders of the
i Foundation to avoid the connota
tions of a more descriptive title.
SIGNIFICANT WOKK
The work of the Coro Foundation,
however, has been of great .signifi
cance. In the past nine years it has
enlisted the aid of over 50 business
j fit ms and 35 major union groups in
training its public affairs interns.
Government departments for San
J Francisco City and County and the
j State play an active role in this
! program, as do the U.S. Bureau ol
Reclamation, the U.S. Mediation and
Conciliation Service, and the U.S.
federal courts.
Coro interns are placed in a series
of government offifTicos on a half
day basis to carry out training as
j .signments as determined by the var
ious department heads. The other
half of the day they are placed on a
rotating basis in business firms and
' labor unions. In addition they un
dertake individual and group proj
ects on behalf of Bay Area commu
nities and organizations.
Last spring three Stanford gradu
ating seniors were selected as 1954-
55 Coro interns — Dianne Catlin,
Barbara Tuerk, and Cecil Riley. As
part of their training program they
took an active part in the 1954
Con gressiona 1 cam oa ign.
VIFLT PUBLIC FIGURES
| Each intern was assigned to work
! with a candidate running for office.
They were in close contact with the
Democratic and Republican County
! Central Committees and personally
met such public figures as Senator
I Thomas Kuchel, Congressman John
JF. Shelley, California Governor
: Goodwin J. Knight, and San Fran
| cisco Supervisor George Christo
j pher.
In an assignment this spring the
group spent a week in Sacramento,
studying the operation of state gov
ernment, meeting state Senators and
Assemblymen, an d interviewing
state officials.
In its internship program Coro is

| looking for persons who will be
I community leaders 10 to 20 years
I from now. r l o find such people thre >
| requirements are listed for possible
I applicants;
1. Sound character, good health,
and leadership abilities.
2. A definite interest in public af
i fairs, and a potential desire for a
| career in this field.
3. A written evaluation of person
j al qualifications for this field, an

social, economic, or political prob

Interviews for students interested
in the internship program will be
j conducted at the Placement Service
tomorrow. Application blanks may
be obtained directly from the Coro
Foundation, Pacific Building, 821
Market Street, San Francisco. May
; G is the deadline for contacting Coro
for applications.

The training program runs from
October through June on a full
time professional basis, witli a tui
tion charge of $500. The foundation
grants each intern a subsistence
scholarship of $1,000, plus $125 for
one dependent or $350 for two or
more dependents. If need is shown,
a tuition loan may be arranged, and
a few tuition scholarships are avail
able.
To date graduates of the Coro in
ternship program have entered a
broad range of activity associated
with "public affairs." Fifty - eight
per cent are now employed in public
service, 24 per cent in business, 3
per cent in labor, 10 per cent in
journalism or education, and 5 per
cent in law.
In these fields they are realizing
the three goals of the Coro Founda
tion: more able men in public life,
higher moral and ethical standards
of political behavior, and better
public understanding.

In these fields they are realizing
the three goals of the Coro Founda

higher moral and ethical standards
of political behavior, and better
public understanding.
The successful businessman,

To date graduates of the Coro in

broad range of activity associated
with "public affairs." Fifty - eight
per cent are now employed in public
service, 24 per cent in business, 3
per cent in labor, 10 per cent in
journalism or education, and 5 per
cent in law.
In these fields they are realizing
the three goals of the Coro Founda

higher moral and ethical standards
of political behavior, and better
public understanding.
