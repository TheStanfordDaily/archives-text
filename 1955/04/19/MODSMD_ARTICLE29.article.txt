# Space Company Uses Rare Book Room Map

### BARBARA NICHOLS 
Big business came to campus
and it found what it needed in
the Alfred M. Bender Rare Book
Room.
The Spice Islands Company sent a
representative to the Rare Book
Room to find material to use for
designs on the new Christmas cov
ers for its .spice and herb chests.
One of the resulting' covers for the
chests was green with drawings of
five herb bushes. The drawings were
taken from John Gerard's "The Her
bal, or General Historic of Plants,"
published in London in 1597. The
herbal contained descriptions and
pictures of herbs. It also told the
herbs' medicinal uses, their habitat,
and their flowering time.
The other cover designed from
Stanford materials was yellow with
a copy of an old map of the Spice
Islands and the surrounding area.
The map was one of a collection of
3,000 purchase:! by Stanford about
seven years ago.
, Finding just the right map took a
whole morning. The .'l,OOO maps wore
in no order, and the Spice Islands
Company representative had to go

through most of them to find the
one he wanted to use on the chest.
Then the map was taken to the Pho
tography Department on campus
where it was photographed for use
as a mode! for the chest cover. The
map used was Herman Moll's "A
Mcp of the East-Indies and Adja
cent .Countries," London, 1080.
The Rare Book Room received an
acknowledgment for the use of these
materials on the KCIO-TV show
"Success Story." The success story
told on this program was that of the
Spice Islands Company. The show
described each department of the
company at work, describing the
processing, packaging, and labeling
of herbs, spices, and vinegars.
When the publicity department
told of its operations, it showed the
map and herbal belonging to Stan
ford that it had used in making the
chest covers.
