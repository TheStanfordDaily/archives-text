# Rounding the Bases

Stanford athletics saw another "almost but not quite" last Saturday in
the Stadium when Coach Weiershauser's spikers lost by a hearbrcaking one
point to the second best track squad in the nation. The loss left a feeling

of pride, in the amazing number of
comethrough performances by Card,
runners, throwers and jumpers, but
also a feeling of futility. Stanford
had the meet won unlil Jim Luttrell's
knee buckled in the middle of the
low hurdles, and the i - elay would
possibly have fallen to the Cards ex
cept that Myron Hollister and Larry
Spicer were out with injuries.
The team was all set to carry
Weiershauser off on their shoulders,
but then Newquist sneaked in ahead
of Luttrell in the hurdles and Ev
Trader hung on long enough to stay
ahead of Walt Garrett Oxy came
out on top.
An unusual innovation saw the
100 and the high hurdles run "back
wards." Usual practice is to run these
two races from south to north, into
the wind, but last Thursday Weier
shaWser hit upon the idea of revers-

ing the direction. "We've talked about that wind for a long time, so I de
cided to do something about it." Keith Brownsberger won the hundred
in a fast time of :09.7 with a three mile tailwind. The usual wind is about
ten miles an hour, whieh would nullify any records made in these races
since any time made with more than a 4.4 tailwind is thrown out. Weier
shauser figures that Brownie's time would have been closer to :10.1 if the
race had been run in the conventional fashion.
CHICANERY
Although Weiershauser points out that the wind is there for both teams,
there is a psychological advantage in being a :09.7 sprinter instead of a : 10. 1
man. In the hurdles race there is a bit of chicanery though. In the race
the hurdles are set 10 yards apart. When you are practicing on a windless
field, you set the hurdles 10'/•> yards apart if you are going to be running
into the wind at the meet. If the race is to be run with the wind, the sticks
are at 9'/:> yards apart.
Oxy had been practicing for into the wind. Stanford took one-two in the
high hurdles. 'Nufl said?

Chuck Strong decided not to be a front runner last Saturday. Against
Michigan, Strong broke fast from the mark and fairly sped the first four
laps. He finished out of the money. This time he deckled to hold back and
save his strength for the end. Strong was way back until the start of the
seventh lap; then he let go. Many feared that he was confused and thought
it was the final circuit. But no, he kept it up for two laps and was home in
0:25. His time for the first mile? 4:45. How fast does the front runner go
in the first mile? Approximately 4:45. Psychology again. Strong "saved"
his strength for the end, and took first place. Unfortunately, he'll have to
save a little more next weekend for USC's Ledesma is a 9:10 runner.

INCIDENTAL INTELLIGENCE—Know when Stanford last lost a frosh
golf match? 17 years ago today, April 19, 19,"8.

Spring practice gets underway next Monday with Chuck.Taylor cracking
the whip over the 1955 hopefuls. Stanford loses very few boys in June, and
although their loss will definitely be felt, Taylor will have a big nucleus
to work around. That old devil, the quarterback spot, is still a toss up be
tween John Brodie and Jerry Gustafson with Jon Douglas, up from the
frosh, in there too.
"Pappy" Waldorf greeted only 13 lettermen over at Cal yesterday, and it
appears that the Wise; Walrus has his work cut out for himself even to dupli
cate his mediocre efforts of last season. Maybe this will be the year. That
spot in the Cellar has looked very empty now for eight years.
Two freshmen impressed this weekend. Maury Graves doubled up to
take the mile and the two mile for the Papooses in a trianglar meet, and
Robin Moore eased through to victory in the 220 freestyle against the Cal
frosh and then turned it on to take the 100 in :51.0, faster by three seconds
than the time which won the Varsity 100.
Orchids also to Hal Messner, Walt Payne, and Ed Verdurmcn. Messner's
long triple, his fourth of the year, busted up the first game of Saturday's
doubleheader and got the Cards back on the winning trail after a bum effort
against California Friday. Payne seems to have found his cousins in the
Missionites. They have succumbed to him three times this season. Ver
durmcn showed that he can pitch on the Varsity level in the second game,
and having a third dependable man on the pitching staff will make things
easier for Coach Dean.
