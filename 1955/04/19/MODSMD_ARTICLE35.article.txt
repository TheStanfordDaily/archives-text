# Frosh Crew Abandon Ship In Bay Tour
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
Coach Conn Findley's Irosh
crew decided to take a little tour
of the Bay mudflats last Satur
day and wound up treking off
to the Oakland Estuary, home of
the California Bears. This was
the first time such an adventure
has ever been attempted at Stan
ford.
The sprightly lads left the Red
wood City Harbor at the likely
hour of 4 in the morning. After the
eight - oared shell and the coach's
launch roared out of the three-mile
harbor by the light of the moon, a
course toward the San Mateo Bridge
was steered by cox Randy Jones.
EVERYTHING FINE
Everything was progressing just
fine until towering three-foot waves
were encountered just on the other
side of the bridge. Soon it was evi
dent to all involved that a crack in
the outer covering of the bow was
enlarging wave by wave. The inevi
table result was that the bow sec
tion of the shell soon was submerged
to the extent that all nine adven
turers irt the craft were forced to
abandon ship into the tropical San
Francisco Bay waters.
FINDLEY HELPS
At this point Coach Findley lent a
helping hand by towing the 64-foot
shell to the east bank of the Bay,
which was some 200 yards distant.
Once on the shore, the shell was
emptied and the worthies set out
anew. Two frosh substitutions were
made after the unscheduled stop,
namely Chick Field, number 2, and
Charley Martin at coxswain. â€¢
Frosh members who rowed the
entire distance were: Bill Pope,
stroke; Ken Monroe, 7; John Reich
man, 6; Bill Mein, 5; Pete Haywood,
4; John Kinsey, 3; and Tom Frost,
bow.
Due to the condition of the shell
and the choppiness of the water the
shell was entrusted to the shell
house manager at. Cal until the he
roic eight plus one decide to ven
ture forth again,
