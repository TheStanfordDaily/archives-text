For the first time he was pressed in
the mile, as Bill Kuha of Santa Rosa
finished in 4:26.2.
The freshmen scored 57 points,
followed by Modesto's 51 and Santa
Rosa's 43.
Chuck Cobb again finished first in
both the low and high hurdles,
timed at 24.5 in the lows and 14.9 in
the highs. He was trailed by Bob
Newman in both races.
Don Richardson passed Kuha at
the 440 post and went on to score a

convincing victory in the 880. His
time was 1:58.8. The other fresh
man first was accounted for by Jim
Hart, who hurled the discus 139 feet.

The closest event of the morning,
however, was the broad jump, in
which Kent Hansen of the freshmen
was edged by Bob McCullough of
Modesto JC. Hansen leaped 22 feet
V4 inch, but McCullough came
through to win as on his last try he
jumped 22 feet % inch.
