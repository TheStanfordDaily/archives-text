# Physicist Einstein Dies at 76
## 
### 
i Dr. Albert Einstein, heralded as
father of the atomic bomb and tele
vision, died yesterday at Princeton,
j He was 76.
An official of the Stanford Re
j search Institute commented that "his
tremendous contributions to science
j speak for themselves. The whole sci
entific community is going to feel
j his death severely."
Even after death the mind and
body of the great 20th-century gen
ius were dedicated to science. At
his request, his brain and other vital
organs were removed for medical
study.'
The frail wizard, whose theory of
relativity led to the first nuclear
chain reaction, died at Princeton
Hospital at 1:15 a.m. of a rupture in

the main artery of the body. He
also suffered from a severe, long
standing gall bladder ailment.
Shortly before 4:30 a.m., his doc
tor announced that his body had
been cremated, in accordance with
his wishes, after the vital organs
were removed.
Einstein was widely hailed as the
greatest mind of his generation, and
received the Nobel Prize for his ef
forts toward peace. Behind his phi
losophy of life, however, was a sim
ple formula—A equals X plus Y
plus Z.
He explained that if A was suc
cess in life, then X was work and
Y was play. Z, he said, was keeping
your mouth shut.
