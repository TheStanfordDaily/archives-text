## 
### 
Men's Council convicted a fresh
man of a Fundamental Standard
violation for using another student's
notes without permission and de
priving him of the use of those notes
before a final.
The freshman received 25 Con
Home hours. He had originally
faced suspension on a charge of theft
of the notes.
The charge was reduced from
theft because it was established that
he thought the notes belonged to a
friend and did not act maliciously
in taking them. However, upon dis
covering whose notes they were, he
failed to return them until caught
with them in his possession.
