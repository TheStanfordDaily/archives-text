## Radio Waves Tell History Of Universe 
### MARY ELLEN ROMNEY 
About the year 1050, the
Chinese recorded the birth of a
new star. Today, astronomers
are watching the remains of this
star fly outward into space in
the form of a "crab nebula,"
while radio receivers report the
violent movement in the form of
radio static.
Tliis discovery of perhaps the most
spectacular occurrence man has wit
nessed in the universe is one of the
phases of radio astronomy, as ex
plained last night, by Dr. Ronald N.
Bracewell in a Tuesday Evening So
ries address at Memorial Auditorium.
DISCOVERY OF WAVES
Dr. Bracewell, who has done sig
nifivant research in this new science
in his native Australia, described
first "the origin of radio astronomy.
"When the nature of radio waves was
discovered, it was apparent that
heat, light, and radio waves were all
of.thr same nature, and could be re
ceived on the same instrument much
in the same way as we dial in differ
ent stations on our radios," he ex
plained.
Men figured as early as I8SK) that
the sun would therefore emit radio
waves, but it was not until 1930 that
radio contact was made with outer
space. The noise is much like the
static heard on an ordinary radio.
TYPES OF REFLECTORS
These radiations are received by
a variety of reflectors, which Dr.
Bracewell illustrated by slides. They
are in the form of huge parabolic
"mirrors"â€”actually made of wire
mesh, which is an excellent reflec
tor of radio beans.
Radio sources from the sun are of
several types, said Dr. Bracewell.
Loud, periodic radiations have been
traced to sun-spots, while even more
intense, minute - long "outburst"
radiations come from material being
shot out from the sun at fantastically
high speeds.
"Other galoctic radiations arc
spotty iti location," continued Dr.
Bracewell. "These radiations have
been proved to come not from stars,
but from a multitude of curious and
unique astronomical phenomena."
