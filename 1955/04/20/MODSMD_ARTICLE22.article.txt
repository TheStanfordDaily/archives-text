# Rise Stevens Predicts Long Life for Opera

### STEW TOW 
"Good heavens, no!" Rise Stevens answered with amazement
; after hor concert Monday night. "Opera isn't on the wane. It's
more alive than ever!"
And the overflow crowd, stuffed into Memorial Auditorium from
the balcony to the special seats in the orchestra pit, was lucrative

proof for the Concert Series that the
opera box office is holding its own.
But can opera .survive forever on
the 19th century warhorses? Miss
Stevens thought that it could, but
that the standard operas should be
translated into English.
OPERAS IN ENGLISH
"It's a great help for operas to be
ung it) English. They're translated
into the languages of all other coun
tries, so why shouldn't they be into
ours?"
Did she think is a prostitution of
art for opera stars to sing in night
clubs? "No ... if they enjoy it,
that's what, they should do. Estab
lished stars are already good—they
don't have In prove anything, so they
can do a:. they like.''
She thought that opera has lost
much of the stuffiness which has
made it unpopular in the past. An
example of opera reaching the
masses is the movie "Carmen
Jones," which she called "terrific."
CARMEN arias
There is certainly nothing stuffy
about Miss Stevens. Her renditions
of three "Carmen" arias—the Haba
nera, Seguidilla, and Gypsy Sotig—
were perfect combinations of art and
sex appeal.
Even on the concert stage, the
i good looks, theatrical sensitivity,

and refreshingly un-primadonna-ish
mezzo voice which have made Miss
Stevens a huge operatic drawing
card were plainly evident.
Her singing of the famous "Mon
Coeur s'ouvre a ta voix," from
"Samson and Delilah," made us wish
she had sung a few more well
known arias, instead of the many
unfamiliar little songs.
"The Pasture," by Charles Nagin
ski, was one of the least familiar of
the latter group, and one of the
best.
The four songs by Edvard Grieg—
"With a Water Lily," "Morning
Dew," "The First Meeting," and '"A
Dream"—were also well done.
Miss Stevens sang several en
cores, among them the perennial
"Because." But it was a request, so
we can't blame her.
Accompanist James Shorn ate pro
vided a diversion by playing three
piano solos by modern French com
posers.
