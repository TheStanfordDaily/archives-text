# Jamboree Is New Tradition
## 
### MARGO BOOTHE 
The annual Frosh-Soph Jamboree,
which will take place this Saturday
is a relatively new Stanford tradi
tion.
The Jamboree idea originator! in
Autumn quarter of 1947 when t!
freshman football team challenp<d
"any and all willing sophomores" to
play against them in a game early
in Winter Quarter. Chuck Taylor
was coaching the freshman team at
that time.
The sophomores were naturally
surprised at the offer, but they de
cided to accept the challenge and ;i
February date was set for the battle
royal. Both squads began practice at
the beginning of winter quarter and
strict training rules applied. The
sophomores were set to fill the air
with pates, while Taylor announced
that hi:l%eam would employ a T
formation.
GREATER PARTICIPATION
As the football game spirit re e,
the two classes began to organize
other contests which could be held
along with the football game and
thereby allow more students in the
classes to participate.
The night before the Jamboree a
no-date jolly-up dance was organ
ized. The men were charged 50
cents admission, but the women were
allowed in free. Transportation was
provided from Women's Row in order
that there would be'enough women.
At the dance, a beard growing con
test, another of the many side attrac
tions to the game, was judged, and
entertainment featuring fifty dancing
girls was provided.
OTHER CONTESTS
The next day, besides the football
game, an inner tube pull, a milk
drinking contest, a wheelbarrow rc -
lay, a rail-riding event, and a log
rolling contest were held. There v;â– 
also a tug-o'-war, the great-gre i
granddaddy of the present day mud
fest.
