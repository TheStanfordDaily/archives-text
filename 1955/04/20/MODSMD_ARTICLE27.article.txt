The turnout of voiezs yesterday in the- ASSU
Constitution referendum was somewhat en
couraging. Fortunately there is still today for
the ones who didn't succeed in casting a vote
yesterday. A new form of government for the
ASSU deserves the consideration of every stu
dent, again, the idea that this decision-making
process is an opportunity as well as a duty.
Election Board has spent time and effort to
make the eleci'"' . mechanics run as smoothly
as possible. The result is a definite improve
ment over past procedure. The placing of vot
ing tables at Engineering Corner was a wise

move !o catch the How of tiatJic in one ol the !
busiest areas on Quad. The booth set up at the j
library last night made voting just that much
more convenient. The Village residents also
had a handy polling place.
Election Board has provided the basis (or
a successfully run election. The only quantity
needed to complete the process is voters. There |
are four tables at which to vote at Engineering
Corner, so the election lines are sure to be i
much shorter than Cellar coffee lines. And the
returns are greater.
