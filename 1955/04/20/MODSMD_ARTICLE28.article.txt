Today's voting in the constitution referen
dum will set the agendo for Excom tonight. If
a new constitution has been voted in for ASSU,
Excom musit immediately set about drawing
up by-laws outlining constituencies for mem
bers of the new Legislature, so that election
of these members can be held during the first
two we: A May in the regular ASSU elec
tion.
Right now, Excom ejPrisions a Legislature
seating one representative for roughly each
500 students. Undergraduate representation
would be by living area; graduate representa
tion by academic division. Complications may
arise in regard to representation for the Village
and the problem'of students who will change
living area between ebction time and next fall
when the new members oi the Legislature will
take over.
But these problems .-.re contingent on the
student vote tor ay. vVhan Election Board
chairman E: Fi announces the tally late
this afternoon Excom will have a much better
idea whether it will have a long nr a short
meetincr tonight.

Organizations continue to briny their own
constitution revisions to Excom for approval.
Last week at the end of the meeting Excom
received a draft constitution for the Political
Union. Theie is every indication that this con
stitution should produce an interesting session
tonight.
Fundamental Standard Committee will also
present proposed changes in its operative set
up. The group recenily began work to clarify
its status in Stanford student government. Un
der the proposed constitution it would be Fun
damental Standard Commission, according to
its present plans, so its members, along with
many others, will be particularly-interested in
the outcome of today's voting.
Representatives of IIR will be on hand at U
tonight to discuss the organization's financial
affairs. This is the problem which came to Ex
com first two weeks ago.
The meeting will begin in the Excom room,
Student Union, tonight at 7:30.
