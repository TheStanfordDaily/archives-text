Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's
Chowder?
And who, whil. we're on the subject, let the
bedbugs on the Thela Chi Sleeping Porch?
Here lies the story for today.
Seems as how a couple of the Theta Chi
brcs were coming back from the symphony in
San Francisco. They passed, as many people
do, ough (the metropolis of South San Fran
r - Up to here, you will agree, there is
; different about this narrative.
n oouth San Francisco, they picked up a
dog, who, for our purposes, shall be known as
Joe. Joe returned to the local Theta Chi dig
gings and high life.
The next evening, one of the fraternal lads
discovered he had strange and inexplicable

:
itchings. Accordingly, he gave himself over i
to the hands of the Health Service. This was:
OK with the Health Service, I am told, until a
few more of the Theta Chians turned up with j
a similar complaint at the local dispensary, j
The Health Service, taking a deep breath, de
cided bedbugs were on the loose.
joe has been banished to the dismal con
fines of the Palo Aito Pound. Theta Chi is about 1
to be fumigated, at the very least.
Take heed. If the guy next to you is squirm-j
ing in class as you read this, he may not be |
bored. He may not be wishing h© was about j
to be cut out of his long woolies. He may, in
truth, be serving as the entree for some gour
met among bedbugs.
