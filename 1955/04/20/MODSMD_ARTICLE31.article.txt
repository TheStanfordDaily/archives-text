# Dutch Foreign Scholar Solves Haircut Problem
## 
### EARL CILLEY 
"And you take haircuts, lor instance. At home in the Nether
lands they cost the equivalent ol 15 American cents, but here,
well! So I bought a pair of clippers and now I cut my own and
some other guys'—and they are Americans, too! No charge is
made, so I don't get into trouble . .
Joris Biemans, a Fulbright loreign scholar from the Netherlands,

is here for the year teaching and'
studying in the Food Research In
stitute. This fact brought u lew ob
vious questions to mind, like "Why
did you desire to come to Stanford,
and what are you going to do with
your knowledge of foods?" and .so
on.
He sat back and thought for a mo
ment, and then gave me some pretty
good answers.
"I studied Agricultural Economics
at the Catholic School of Economics
at Til burg, in the Netherlands, and
in many of the books I read 1 would
see a footnote, and down at the bot
tom of the page would be a quota
tion and at the end of the quotation
it would say "Courtesy of the Food
Research Institute, Stanford Univer
sity, Stanford, California." So I in
quired and found out that the Food
Research Institute here is very good;
you could say, I believe, that it is
the best in the world.
"I wanted to study the structure
of European agriculture in compari
son to that of North America, and so
1 applied for a Fulbright scholar
ship and when i got it, 1 came."
INTERNATIONAL WORK
"1 will probably go to work for the
government in Holland when 1 get
back," he related, "but I would
rather work for an international
agency, say, for the U.N., because I
think it would be more interesting
to work on the international level.
And my work is concerned more
with the general food - producing
base of all Europe than with that of
one country in particular.

Biemans said that he came from a
farm in a village called IJeshout,
which is only about 14 kilometers
from Eindhoven, and so 1 asked him
about the Germans, and about the
war and the invasion and all.
PASSWORDS
''if you gave the Germans every
thing they wanted, all your metals
and your livestock and your crops,
then they didn't bother you," fie re
plied." "The SS were very bad, j
though. Every boy was supposed to !
go to a camp, and if you were hid
den, or helped to hide Dutch boys or |
downed American flyers, or were
found withholding food for them, it
was very bad. I was hidden, ami w,e j
used to figure out passwords that!
the Germans couldn't pronounce.
"For instance, we had one, 'acht
en tachtig kacheltjes,' which means ■
"eighty-eight little stoves,' and the j
Germans never could pronounce it ■
right, so it was very good.
'"You saw troops, an army, when j
the Germans came, but when the |
Americans come you saw only tanks, !
only machines.
"It is the same here in the United
States: out on the highway you see |
no people, only machines. It is so
unnatural, there is an inhuman
quality to life here. At home, we
have even more people, but they t
don't bother you."
"'Perhaps that is why it is so very :
hard to make intimate friends in
America," Biemans continued. "In j
Holland, it takes lots of time, but
when you have a Dutchman's friend- !

ship you really have something. In
New York I think I saw what David
Rieschman meant in his hook 'The
Lonely Crowd.' You are just noth
ing in a crowd.
POLITE AMERICANS
"It is the so-great politeness here
that inhibits real friendship with
Americans, I think. Of course you
have friends, but your conversations
are superficial and whimsical. Real
ly il i.s very seldom that an exchange
of very personal or basic ideas takes
place, and because ol the continual
use of these standard formulas of
conversation, everybody seems to
feel lonely, cut off from his fellows."
Finally, I asked him about Stan
ford women, a topic which always
seems to come up in any conversa
tion that lasts longer than 30 sec
onds. lie smiled and said, "Most of
the girls I get interested in are go
ing steady, and the others are just
social butterflies!"

good answers.

at the Catholic School of Economics

in many of the books I read 1 would
see a footnote, and down at the bot

the best in the world.
"I wanted to study the structure
of European agriculture in compari

1 applied for a Fulbright scholar

INTERNATIONAL WORK
"1 will probably go to work for the
government in Holland when 1 get
back," he related, "but I would
rather work for an international
agency, say, for the U.N., because I
think it would be more interesting
to work on the international level.
And my work is concerned more
with the general food - producing
base of all Europe than with that of
one country in particular.

Biemans said that he came from a
farm in a village called IJeshout,
which is only about 14 kilometers
from Eindhoven, and so 1 asked him
about the Germans, and about the
war and the invasion and all.
PASSWORDS

thing they wanted, all your metals
and your livestock and your crops,

though. Every boy was supposed to !
go to a camp, and if you were hid
den, or helped to hide Dutch boys or |
downed American flyers, or were
found withholding food for them, it
was very bad. I was hidden, ami w,e j
used to figure out passwords that!
the Germans couldn't pronounce.
"For instance, we had one, 'acht

"eighty-eight little stoves,' and the j
Germans never could pronounce it ■

have even more people, but they t

"'Perhaps that is why it is so very :

POLITE AMERICANS

that inhibits real friendship with

have friends, but your conversations
are superficial and whimsical. Real

it would say "Courtesy of the Food
Research Institute, Stanford Univer
sity, Stanford, California." So I in
quired and found out that the Food
Research Institute here is very good;
you could say, I believe, that it is
the best in the world.
"I wanted to study the structure
of European agriculture in compari
son to that of North America, and so
1 applied for a Fulbright scholar
ship and when i got it, 1 came."
INTERNATIONAL WORK
"1 will probably go to work for the
government in Holland when 1 get
back," he related, "but I would
rather work for an international
agency, say, for the U.N., because I
think it would be more interesting
to work on the international level.
And my work is concerned more
with the general food - producing
base of all Europe than with that of
one country in particular.

Biemans said that he came from a
farm in a village called IJeshout,
which is only about 14 kilometers
from Eindhoven, and so 1 asked him
about the Germans, and about the
war and the invasion and all.
PASSWORDS
''if you gave the Germans every
thing they wanted, all your metals
and your livestock and your crops,
then they didn't bother you," fie re
plied." "The SS were very bad, j
though. Every boy was supposed to !
go to a camp, and if you were hid
den, or helped to hide Dutch boys or |
downed American flyers, or were
found withholding food for them, it
was very bad. I was hidden, ami w,e j
used to figure out passwords that!
the Germans couldn't pronounce.
"For instance, we had one, 'acht
en tachtig kacheltjes,' which means ■
"eighty-eight little stoves,' and the j
Germans never could pronounce it ■
right, so it was very good.
'"You saw troops, an army, when j
the Germans came, but when the |
Americans come you saw only tanks, !
only machines.
"It is the same here in the United
States: out on the highway you see |
no people, only machines. It is so
unnatural, there is an inhuman
quality to life here. At home, we
have even more people, but they t
don't bother you."
"'Perhaps that is why it is so very :
hard to make intimate friends in
America," Biemans continued. "In j
Holland, it takes lots of time, but
when you have a Dutchman's friend- !

ship you really have something. In
New York I think I saw what David
Rieschman meant in his hook 'The
Lonely Crowd.' You are just noth
ing in a crowd.
POLITE AMERICANS
"It is the so-great politeness here
that inhibits real friendship with
Americans, I think. Of course you
have friends, but your conversations
are superficial and whimsical. Real
ly il i.s very seldom that an exchange
of very personal or basic ideas takes
place, and because ol the continual
use of these standard formulas of
conversation, everybody seems to
feel lonely, cut off from his fellows."
Finally, I asked him about Stan
ford women, a topic which always
seems to come up in any conversa
tion that lasts longer than 30 sec
onds. lie smiled and said, "Most of
the girls I get interested in are go
ing steady, and the others are just
social butterflies!"
