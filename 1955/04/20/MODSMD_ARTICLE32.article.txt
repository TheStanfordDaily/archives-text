# Professor Declares Pleasure At Success of Video Show
## 
### DON JACKSON 
Stanford's 13-week television
series rolled to a close last week,
and the speech and drama pro
fessor who directed the series
declared he was "more than
pleased" with the show's suc
cess.
"'Our Rugged Constitution," an
educational feature designed to-pic
ture the Constitution as a living, vi
tal document, was produced and di
rected solely by Stanford faculty
and students, though sponsored by
the National Educational Television
Association.
Dr. Stanley Donner, who directed
the program and served as modera
tor for its discussions, commented
that it "maintained a high level of
performance throughout all the 13
weeks." He gave special praise to
the program style, which presented
faculty members discussing various
aspects of the Constitution.
The show was broadcast from the
studios of KQED, San Francisco ed
ucational station. Stanford students
—undergraduate as well as gradu
ate —aided in the show's writing and
production in the capacity of assist
ant producer.
Donner added that the series
"avoided the high-school civics class
approach that we feared, and suc
cessfully put over the purpose—to
present the Constitution as a vital
document."
The last series produced by Farm
creators was "People, Places, and
Politics," which netted the depart
ment a Northern California TV
award. "Our Rugged Constitution,"
Donner explained, will have a les
sened chance for an award, since it
was broadcast early in the year, but
it will still be a contender.
Dr. Stuart Hyde, who produced
the series, echoed Dr. Dormer's

praises, calling the- presentation a |
".success!'til attempt at a high-level !
serious discussion." Ho singled out |
the student producers lor special i
commendation, pointing out that j
"everyone helped in the production, j
and they all gained an opportunity I
to work and learn."
As for the future, Dr. Donner re- |
vealed plans, somewhat doubtful at
present, for a series on the problems
facing Southeast Asia. The discus
sion mode would be forsaken, how
ever, for the "personalized camera"
approach.
