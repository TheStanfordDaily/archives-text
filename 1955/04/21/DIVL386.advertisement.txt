NEWSPAPER WORK AS A CAREER
The Ist of 3 advertisements. 7
There are a number of first-rate newspapers.
Some are published in big cities, some in towns, and some are published
in cities of middle size.
These first-rate newspapers have two things in common —they cannot
be bought, and they cannot be intimidated.
They are not perfect.
Like even the best individuals, they have their faults and their frailties.
The philosophies back of these newspapers are varied.
* Yet the philosophy back of one or another of them you are pretty sure
to find more or less in accord with your own philosophy.
• ,
Such newspapers play an important role in American life.
The role is sometimes dangerous, sometimes romantic, sometimes pro
saic, sometimes exciting, but at all times honorable and worthwhile.
Newspaper work is too unpredictable to be cut and dried.
Like all work it requires industry and an amount of routine drudgery.
But to alert minds, newspaper work offers endless possibilities of variety
and of interest.
If you think of a newspaper career, teach yourself to keep your eyes
open and your ears open.
Teach yourself to write clear, simple English.
*
A working knowledge of short-hand you will find a useful tool.
To speak and read a foreign language moderately well may sometimes
prove to be a very great asset.
For the rest, read everything that interests you, but always read and
think about what you read.
