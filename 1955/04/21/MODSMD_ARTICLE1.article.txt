# Cranston Says United Nations Is Only Alternative for Policy of Containment
## Political Union Hears Democrat 
### DAVE SCOTT 
"It is my conviction that the
only hope for an alternative
Dther than a continual contain
ment policy is the United Na
tions, which is increasingly be
ing ignored by the present ad
ministration," declared Alan
Cranston, chairman of the Cali
fornia Democratic Council, last
night to members of the Political
Union.
''The containment policy as initi
ated by the Democratic party," ex
plained Cranston, "was a shield to
hold back the Communist power
while other methods were looked"
for.
"Truman saw that everything was
done through the United Nations
while the shield of containment was
in effect. Broad new plans like the
Point Four Program were initiated.
UNDER REPUBLICANS
"Under the Republican adminis
tration a containment policy has be
come a thing within itself. While the
shield has remained up no other
problems have been worked out to
solve the coexistence problem. No
body has been liberated and we
have shrunk back from massive re
taliation."
Therefore, Cranston advocated a
greater participation in the United
Nations, instead of the "present pol
icy of taking our problems odtside
the body." In the 10-year constitu
tional revision conference to come
up before the General Assembly this
fall, Cranston voiced his opinion that
we should strive toward a more ef
fective police force and abolition of
the Security Council veto vote.
"But an equally important and
more realistic thing to be done," the
speaker urged, "is to change the
voting formula per nation. We
should get away from the rule of
one vote per nation in the General
Assembly."
BASIS FOR VOTING
He advocated considering popula
tion, economic.strength, and educa
tional level as a basis for voting
strength. He declared that since
when this was done, the Communist
nations would be given more pro
portional representation, they could
not afford to refuse the plan. Then,
after this was adopted, the nations
would be more likely to use the U.N.
to make decisions.
"As the second part to my pro
gram, I advocate a truly Goliath
Point Four program, that would
really help other nations to help
themselves," Crang'ton concluded.
"If America embarked upon this
course, we would have the leader
ship of the world."

voting formula per nation. We
should get away from the rule of
one vote per nation in the General
Assembly."
BASIS FOR VOTING
He advocated considering popula
tion, economic.strength, and educa
tional level as a basis for voting
strength. He declared that since
when this was done, the Communist
nations would be given more pro
portional representation, they could
not afford to refuse the plan. Then,
after this was adopted, the nations
would be more likely to use the U.N.
to make decisions.
"As the second part to my pro
gram, I advocate a truly Goliath
Point Four program, that would
really help other nations to help
themselves," Crang'ton concluded.
"If America embarked upon this
course, we would have the leader
ship of the world."

Advocates more participation in United Nations
"It is my conviction that the
only hope for an alternative
Dther than a continual contain
ment policy is the United Na
tions, which is increasingly be
ing ignored by the present ad
ministration," declared Alan
Cranston, chairman of the Cali
fornia Democratic Council, last
night to members of the Political
Union.
''The containment policy as initi
ated by the Democratic party," ex
plained Cranston, "was a shield to
hold back the Communist power
while other methods were looked"
for.
"Truman saw that everything was
done through the United Nations
while the shield of containment was
in effect. Broad new plans like the
Point Four Program were initiated.
UNDER REPUBLICANS
"Under the Republican adminis
tration a containment policy has be
come a thing within itself. While the
shield has remained up no other
problems have been worked out to
solve the coexistence problem. No
body has been liberated and we
have shrunk back from massive re
taliation."
Therefore, Cranston advocated a
greater participation in the United
Nations, instead of the "present pol
icy of taking our problems odtside
the body." In the 10-year constitu
tional revision conference to come
up before the General Assembly this
fall, Cranston voiced his opinion that
we should strive toward a more ef
fective police force and abolition of
the Security Council veto vote.
"But an equally important and
more realistic thing to be done," the
speaker urged, "is to change the
voting formula per nation. We
should get away from the rule of
one vote per nation in the General
Assembly."
