## Handling of Referendum Commended 
### TACY ANN SMITH Associate Editor, The Daily 
ASSU Executive Committee
began its meeting last night by
unanimous approval of a vote of
commendation to Eric Fricker
and Election Board for their ef
ficient handling of the constitu
tion referendum.
Fricker, chairman of the board,
was praised for his work in achiev
ing a second ASSU election without
error.
Excom approved a motion by Stu
dent Manager Bob Gable to allocate
$140.18 to the Institute of Interna
tional Relations to pay for publica
tion of a publicity pamphlet, after a
report by lIR president A 1 Brouse.
lIR REPORT
Brouse said in his report that a
closer watch would be kept on
budget matters of the organization
in the future. The financial prob
lem may be solved, according to
Brouse, by a plan worked out by
the Student Manager and lIR repre
sentatives for a more flexible budg
et. Under this arrangement, the
budget might be appropriated in
block amounts, and be subdivided
quarterly according to department
neds. The matter of lIR finances
came before Excom because of an
unauthorized appropriation for the
publicity pamphlet at the beginning
of the quarter.
ALLOCATIONS
A $50 allocation was approved for
the lIR Host Committee as part
payment of dancing lessons for for
eign students. Another $50 expendi
ture was approved by Excom for the
Political Union to pay for expenses
of a talk to be given by Senator Ma
lone next week.
Fundamental Standard and Honor
Code Committee by-laws were sub
mitted to Excom for approval, but
were sent back to the group to be
revised with the help of the Excom
Constitution Committee. By-laws of
the Christian Science Organization
at Stanford were approved.
