The first step has taken a year. And the AS
SU has a new constitution.
Eighty-one per cent of those who bothered
tc care evidently felt that a reorganization of
student government would be a step forwaid.
Undoubtedly, that 31 per cent would not agree
as to whether the new constitution is a big
stride toward efficiency or a stumbling shuffle
.away from inefficiency.
The new law of the campus is certainly not
perfect in itself. It will not automatically cor
rect the ills of Stanford's unwieldy bundle
of • "nrnlttees. But greater centralization and
<**- : 'ion may be obtained; more direction
rpose may result.
More significant perhaps than all the struc
tural improvements may be the effect of
change itself—change for the sake of change.
And this change may lead to more changes;

this constitution may lead to amendments or
yet another new constitution. Each re-evalua
tion of student government should lead to an
improved student government. Few will deny
the need for improvement.
The document—like any constitution —will
only be the framework for that document The
real responsibility for improvement lies with
those who will put the new constitution into
action.
Last night, the Executive Committee—or at
any rate the Excom acting as the new Legis
lature — operated under the new regulations.
They created the constitution; now it is theirs
to make work. They had but moments to exult
between success and the next task.
Thus we pass quickly from the first step—
the constitution —to the second—the by-laws.
It is the second step which now commands our
attention.
