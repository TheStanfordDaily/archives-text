interest '' zero

from Australia, why had wide experience with stu
dent government there and in other countries.—Kd.
To the Editor:
A new constitution—bravo, progress ha:, been, made,
and the millenium i.s at hand.
And student interest is zero.
Perhaps the student body cannot appreciate the time
and the thought that ha.s gone into this glorious new
edifice. Perhaps they fed that all will now be well.
But this is impossible, for the structure of a con
stitution can mean but little to the creation of a full
and satisfying student life —yet we do seern to feel
that the constitution is the source of strength and vi
tality in the American Democracy. But surely the
cement of the American Democracy derives not from
the constitution itself, but from the fact that the con
stitution wr? forged at the conclusion of a revolution
where peop • felt that they had to for their rights
and, a new way of life.
In this case -no war, no shouting, just merely a
faint feeling of dissatisfaction within the general body
of students.
Bui the form of the American Constitution lives on
—if only our constitution were like that of the country
as a whole then perhaps all would be well. Let us
hope that these sanguine wishes prove to be true.
We can see that something is wrong with student
government at this university, a feeling that is shared
by the Excom itself. Perhaps it has been the feeling
of dissatisfaction with the role of the student manager
who tends to fill each Excom meeting, albeit quite
efficiently, wii.h all the minutiae that are the stock-in
trade cf student managers. This could well be so.
Or does it derive from a feeling that not enough
people are interested in what student government
does? This seems to have also some element of truth.
Or is it rathe'- that, the Excom feels that they are in

some way hampered in doing useful work as a student
government because of the restricting confines of ;i
constitution not based on the fundamental American
pattern?
But let it bo remembered that:
a) Changing the constitution will not necessarily
improve the quality of student life. In fact, from the
enthusiasm shown by the student body generally it
might appear that there is something in this con
tention. A constitution is only as good as what those
who abide by it are able to do. Or .should we be .so
skeptical?
b) By increasing the superstructure of the student
government it i;; more likely that red tape and not
useful student activity wili multiply.
e) Student government is an entirely different field
of human activity from the government of a great fed
eral state. Student government must be representa
tive it is true, and wider representation may lead, to
greater interest, and, perhaps, also spread the work in
volved; student government must also be efficient, and
it is difficult to see where the amateur student poli
tician can cope with the finely balanced structure
of (.hecks and balances envisaged in the new con
stitution; but most important of all the student gov
ernment must do more than administrate existing ac
tivities (indeed, this has been seemingly well clone by
the student manager up-to-date) and embark upon
some line of action which will make the student body
feel (though never the whole of the student body, for
this is impossible) that something of worth is being
done.
That the Excom feels that it works hard there is no
doubt—but it i.s also true that student opinion, ex
pressed in the vernacular, mostly couldn't care less
about the activities of Excom. They are certainly
apathetic about the newly-born constitution, for it is
not through this means that any rebirth of student
activity can be expected, whatever the hopes of its
sponsors.
