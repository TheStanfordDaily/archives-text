# Stanford Players To Repeat 'Girl'
## 
### 
The Stanford Players repeat Da
vid Belasco's "Girl of the Golden
West" tonight and tomorrow night
at 8:15 in the Little Theater. The
show closes Saturday.
Belasco's melodrama of the Old
West was immensely popular when
first produced at the turn of the cen
turq and was the basis of Puccini's
opera of the same name.
