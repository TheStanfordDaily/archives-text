# STANFORD
## SPORTSCOPE 
### Bob Durand 
Stanford (•(>, USC l»5. A basketball score? iLvcry well could be, but this
isn't basketball season. This is spring and the only spring sport that could
come up with such a score would be track. At this point you are probably
thinking that anyone who would predict Stanford to beat Southern Cali-

fornia in track is not in their right
mind. And you are most likely
corrcct.
As most of you who are reading
this know, the Trojans have had, and
have now one of the most powerful
cinder aggregations that the United
States has ever seen. The USC thin
dads who are coached by Jess Mort
ensen, have won the NCAA champ
ionships for the last 14 years. In the
NCAA meets, they have won 49 in
dividual events, and hold seven meet
records. In the FCC meets, they
claim 95 individual championships
and eight records. This is quite an
impressive background.
This year the Trojans have
swept through all their opposition
without any real difficulty. There
lore, why should Stanford, who has
won only two of their five meets be
any exception. Well, this reporter
sees the situation this way. In the

three meets that they have lost this year, the Indian trackmen have met
three of the toughest teams in the country, i.e., Michigan, the Big Ten
champ; Occidental, the number two team in the country according to early
ratings; and UCLA. Almost everyone who has seen these meets has felt
that Stanford could have won any ok all of them.
NOT HOPELESS?
On paper at this writing, the men from the land of smog look to be about
.i<) points Letter than the Cards lor their meet Saturday. If the Jack Wcier
.'••l»auser-coached Tribe can keep improving like they have been all season,
this reporter feels that they can reach within 20 markers of USC. And with
• very break possible within reason—they might just record the score prev
iously mentioned. And that is still giving the mile relay to the Trojans.
This is being very optimistic, but from this angle, at least the meet, does not
seem hopeless.
Stanford s track team this year is more than just a bunch of individuals!
striving to better their own marks. They are a group of spirited, determined
athletes who are working together as a team and who are trying to win as j
a team. According to coach Weiershauser, this is one of the most important
factors a track squad can have to its credit. In this respect, Weiershauser
says that th : s spring's team is one of the best he has ever coached. Appar
ently, this is the reason why the Indians have had so many "come-through" j
performances this spring and appear to be headed for quite a few more.
The team, spirit is such that if one or two of the Tribe record unusually ,
good marks early in a meet, the rest of the squad doesn't want to let them
down. This results in all out efforts by every member, and thus a lx;tter
showing by the team as a whole.
TOUGHEST COMPETITION
True, this theory may seem to have not been the case in the last three !
meets, but on closer inspection, you will find it true. On each consecutive
Saturday, the Cards have had many unexpected "come-through" perform
ances. Were it not for a lew untimely injuries, Stanford's track record
might stand a lot better than it does presently. Therefore, in going to the
track meet Saturday, don't expect to see USC swamp an outclassed Stan- i
ford team. Instead, look for the Trojans to be up against their toughest !
competition ol fhe year.

# # #
By the way, the Tribe is the only track team that has a winning record
against the Trojans. Out of 52 meets, the Indians have triumphed 28 times,
while the Figueroa Streeters have come out on top in 24 instances. Stanford
won the first 25 dual competitions between the two schools while Southern
California has won the last 19. The largest score ever amassed was by the
southerners in 1946 when they rolled to a 108-23 victory. The Indians,
however, hold the distinction of having the largest winning margin as a
result of their 104-18 win in 1908. The closest meet was in 1933, when the
Tribe edged USC, 67-64. That was the last time tin- Trojans lost to the
Cards.
MEET RECOItDS
Southern California holds all but (wo meet records. Stanford's Ben East
man set the 440-yard run mark in 1932 with a :47.1 clocking, while Paul
Moore set the mile record in 1940 in 4:11.5. The latter is one of the few
that will be threatened Saturday as the Trojans' Sid Wing has done 4:11.7
already this season. Among the other meet records that will be in danger j
tomorrow arc the two-mile run of 4:22.G (SC's Fernando Ledesma has done I
9:11.1), and the high jump mark of 6-9% (broken by SC»s Ernie Shelton, I
last spring. He has already done 6-10 this spring).
Some of the outstanding meet records set by the Trojans are a 57-10Vli !
shot put by Parry O'Brien, a 185-s'/j discus toss by Sam Iness, a :20.9 220- I
yard dash by Fay Draper, and a :23.0 low hurdles by Norm Paul.
The Troymen rolled over Stanford last year in the Los Angeles Coliseum !
to the tune of 88-43 but the Cards had their moments. Jim Luttrell won the j
low hurdles in 23.5 and got a third in the highs. A 1 Cheney put the shot j
52-4% to win by nearly two feet over Trojan Des Koch. Cards John Stewart :
and Norm Jiles picked up a second and a third in the high jump. Bob Kim- j
bull took second in the javelin, and Keith Brownsberger got a third in the '
hundred and a second in the 220.

As was said earlier, if Ihc Indian cindermen continue their steady im
provement, they should be able to get within 20 points of the Southern Cali
ornians. Therefore, my prediction: CSC 75, Stanford 56. '

won only two of their five meets be
any exception. Well, this reporter
sees the situation this way. In the

three meets that they have lost this year, the Indian trackmen have met
three of the toughest teams in the country, i.e., Michigan, the Big Ten
champ; Occidental, the number two team in the country according to early
ratings; and UCLA. Almost everyone who has seen these meets has felt
that Stanford could have won any ok all of them.
NOT HOPELESS?
On paper at this writing, the men from the land of smog look to be about
.i<) points Letter than the Cards lor their meet Saturday. If the Jack Wcier
.'••l»auser-coached Tribe can keep improving like they have been all season,
this reporter feels that they can reach within 20 markers of USC. And with
• very break possible within reason—they might just record the score prev
iously mentioned. And that is still giving the mile relay to the Trojans.
This is being very optimistic, but from this angle, at least the meet, does not
seem hopeless.
Stanford s track team this year is more than just a bunch of individuals!
striving to better their own marks. They are a group of spirited, determined
athletes who are working together as a team and who are trying to win as j
a team. According to coach Weiershauser, this is one of the most important
factors a track squad can have to its credit. In this respect, Weiershauser
says that th : s spring's team is one of the best he has ever coached. Appar
ently, this is the reason why the Indians have had so many "come-through" j
performances this spring and appear to be headed for quite a few more.
The team, spirit is such that if one or two of the Tribe record unusually ,
good marks early in a meet, the rest of the squad doesn't want to let them
down. This results in all out efforts by every member, and thus a lx;tter
showing by the team as a whole.
TOUGHEST COMPETITION
True, this theory may seem to have not been the case in the last three !
meets, but on closer inspection, you will find it true. On each consecutive
Saturday, the Cards have had many unexpected "come-through" perform
ances. Were it not for a lew untimely injuries, Stanford's track record
might stand a lot better than it does presently. Therefore, in going to the
track meet Saturday, don't expect to see USC swamp an outclassed Stan- i
ford team. Instead, look for the Trojans to be up against their toughest !
competition ol fhe year.

# # #
By the way, the Tribe is the only track team that has a winning record
against the Trojans. Out of 52 meets, the Indians have triumphed 28 times,
while the Figueroa Streeters have come out on top in 24 instances. Stanford
won the first 25 dual competitions between the two schools while Southern
California has won the last 19. The largest score ever amassed was by the
southerners in 1946 when they rolled to a 108-23 victory. The Indians,
however, hold the distinction of having the largest winning margin as a
result of their 104-18 win in 1908. The closest meet was in 1933, when the
Tribe edged USC, 67-64. That was the last time tin- Trojans lost to the
Cards.
MEET RECOItDS
Southern California holds all but (wo meet records. Stanford's Ben East
man set the 440-yard run mark in 1932 with a :47.1 clocking, while Paul
Moore set the mile record in 1940 in 4:11.5. The latter is one of the few
that will be threatened Saturday as the Trojans' Sid Wing has done 4:11.7
already this season. Among the other meet records that will be in danger j
tomorrow arc the two-mile run of 4:22.G (SC's Fernando Ledesma has done I
9:11.1), and the high jump mark of 6-9% (broken by SC»s Ernie Shelton, I
last spring. He has already done 6-10 this spring).
Some of the outstanding meet records set by the Trojans are a 57-10Vli !
shot put by Parry O'Brien, a 185-s'/j discus toss by Sam Iness, a :20.9 220- I
yard dash by Fay Draper, and a :23.0 low hurdles by Norm Paul.
The Troymen rolled over Stanford last year in the Los Angeles Coliseum !
to the tune of 88-43 but the Cards had their moments. Jim Luttrell won the j
low hurdles in 23.5 and got a third in the highs. A 1 Cheney put the shot j
52-4% to win by nearly two feet over Trojan Des Koch. Cards John Stewart :
and Norm Jiles picked up a second and a third in the high jump. Bob Kim- j
bull took second in the javelin, and Keith Brownsberger got a third in the '
hundred and a second in the 220.

As was said earlier, if Ihc Indian cindermen continue their steady im
provement, they should be able to get within 20 points of the Southern Cali
ornians. Therefore, my prediction: CSC 75, Stanford 56. '

Stanford s track team this year is more than just a bunch of individuals!
striving to better their own marks. They are a group of spirited, determined
athletes who are working together as a team and who are trying to win as j
a team. According to coach Weiershauser, this is one of the most important
factors a track squad can have to its credit. In this respect, Weiershauser
says that th : s spring's team is one of the best he has ever coached. Appar
ently, this is the reason why the Indians have had so many "come-through" j
performances this spring and appear to be headed for quite a few more.
The team, spirit is such that if one or two of the Tribe record unusually ,
good marks early in a meet, the rest of the squad doesn't want to let them
down. This results in all out efforts by every member, and thus a lx;tter
showing by the team as a whole.
TOUGHEST COMPETITION
True, this theory may seem to have not been the case in the last three !
meets, but on closer inspection, you will find it true. On each consecutive
Saturday, the Cards have had many unexpected "come-through" perform
ances. Were it not for a lew untimely injuries, Stanford's track record
might stand a lot better than it does presently. Therefore, in going to the
track meet Saturday, don't expect to see USC swamp an outclassed Stan- i
ford team. Instead, look for the Trojans to be up against their toughest !
competition ol fhe year.

By the way, the Tribe is the only track team that has a winning record
against the Trojans. Out of 52 meets, the Indians have triumphed 28 times,
while the Figueroa Streeters have come out on top in 24 instances. Stanford
won the first 25 dual competitions between the two schools while Southern
California has won the last 19. The largest score ever amassed was by the
southerners in 1946 when they rolled to a 108-23 victory. The Indians,
however, hold the distinction of having the largest winning margin as a
result of their 104-18 win in 1908. The closest meet was in 1933, when the
Tribe edged USC, 67-64. That was the last time tin- Trojans lost to the
Cards.
MEET RECOItDS
Southern California holds all but (wo meet records. Stanford's Ben East
man set the 440-yard run mark in 1932 with a :47.1 clocking, while Paul
Moore set the mile record in 1940 in 4:11.5. The latter is one of the few
that will be threatened Saturday as the Trojans' Sid Wing has done 4:11.7
already this season. Among the other meet records that will be in danger j
tomorrow arc the two-mile run of 4:22.G (SC's Fernando Ledesma has done I
9:11.1), and the high jump mark of 6-9% (broken by SC»s Ernie Shelton, I
last spring. He has already done 6-10 this spring).
Some of the outstanding meet records set by the Trojans are a 57-10Vli !
shot put by Parry O'Brien, a 185-s'/j discus toss by Sam Iness, a :20.9 220- I
yard dash by Fay Draper, and a :23.0 low hurdles by Norm Paul.
The Troymen rolled over Stanford last year in the Los Angeles Coliseum !
to the tune of 88-43 but the Cards had their moments. Jim Luttrell won the j
low hurdles in 23.5 and got a third in the highs. A 1 Cheney put the shot j
52-4% to win by nearly two feet over Trojan Des Koch. Cards John Stewart :
and Norm Jiles picked up a second and a third in the high jump. Bob Kim- j
bull took second in the javelin, and Keith Brownsberger got a third in the '
hundred and a second in the 220.

As was said earlier, if Ihc Indian cindermen continue their steady im
provement, they should be able to get within 20 points of the Southern Cali
ornians. Therefore, my prediction: CSC 75, Stanford 56. '

Stanford (•(>, USC l»5. A basketball score? iLvcry well could be, but this
isn't basketball season. This is spring and the only spring sport that could
come up with such a score would be track. At this point you are probably
thinking that anyone who would predict Stanford to beat Southern Cali-

fornia in track is not in their right
mind. And you are most likely
corrcct.
As most of you who are reading
this know, the Trojans have had, and
have now one of the most powerful
cinder aggregations that the United
States has ever seen. The USC thin
dads who are coached by Jess Mort
ensen, have won the NCAA champ
ionships for the last 14 years. In the
NCAA meets, they have won 49 in
dividual events, and hold seven meet
records. In the FCC meets, they
claim 95 individual championships
and eight records. This is quite an
impressive background.
This year the Trojans have
swept through all their opposition
without any real difficulty. There
lore, why should Stanford, who has
won only two of their five meets be
any exception. Well, this reporter
sees the situation this way. In the

three meets that they have lost this year, the Indian trackmen have met
three of the toughest teams in the country, i.e., Michigan, the Big Ten
champ; Occidental, the number two team in the country according to early
ratings; and UCLA. Almost everyone who has seen these meets has felt
that Stanford could have won any ok all of them.
NOT HOPELESS?
On paper at this writing, the men from the land of smog look to be about
.i<) points Letter than the Cards lor their meet Saturday. If the Jack Wcier
.'••l»auser-coached Tribe can keep improving like they have been all season,
this reporter feels that they can reach within 20 markers of USC. And with
• very break possible within reason—they might just record the score prev
iously mentioned. And that is still giving the mile relay to the Trojans.
This is being very optimistic, but from this angle, at least the meet, does not
