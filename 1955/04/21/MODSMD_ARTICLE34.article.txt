DEFENDING CIIAIVIP
The tourney brings together the
NCI defending champion, Stanford's '
Chuck Van Linge, and last year's 1
runner-up, sensational San Jose
State sophomore Ernie George. Last '
year on the Stanford course, Van J
Linge, who had stepped out ol a '
Marine uniform and into golf attire,
defeated George thrce-and-two for '
the individual crown. • *
Other strong challengers for Van
Linge's title are USF's John Fry, Se- I
i attic city champ Dick Masterson,
J and Stanford's Fred Drown and ;
Warren Dailey. j (
Blown won the NCI tourney four i
years ago as a freshman, was run- j
ner-up in his sophomore year, and
I was eliminated in an early round
j last year. Last week, as Van Linge j
looked on, Brown aced the 130-yard i
J 15th hole here with a seven iron as j l
the boys got in some practice ses- '
sions. | J
Dailey, a veteran of four years, is : <
1 one of coach Bud Finger's most tal- j ;
I ented yet erratic players. Last week | 1

[ he showed the way against UCLA
j with a par 71.
S'IATEKS TOUGH
Finger expects the toughest chal
[ lenge for the team trophy to come
j from San Jose State. The Indians
j defeated the Spartans earlier in the
| season, 17Va to 9 1 / a, but each match
was close and could have gone ei
ther way. Finger is also wary of
Oregon and Oregon State, labeling
; them as "unknown quantities."
Playing for the varsity today, in
addition to Van Linge, Dailey, and
Brown, will he Phil Gctehell, Frank
Silliman, and John Brodie. It will
be Brodie's final links appearance
until late May as the sophomore will
ian-wer Chuck Taylor's spring loot
hall call Monday.
In addition to the varsity, such JV
and frosh hopefuls as John Forbush,
j Bill Cleyer, Dave DifVenderfer. Hon
Luceti, and Jim Rowley will be vy
-1 ing for team and individual honors.
Last year the frosh tied for second
and the JV's finished fourth.

The tourney brings together the
NCI defending champion, Stanford's '
Chuck Van Linge, and last year's 1
runner-up, sensational San Jose
State sophomore Ernie George. Last '
year on the Stanford course, Van J
Linge, who had stepped out ol a '
Marine uniform and into golf attire,
defeated George thrce-and-two for '
the individual crown. • *
Other strong challengers for Van
Linge's title are USF's John Fry, Se- I
i attic city champ Dick Masterson,
J and Stanford's Fred Drown and ;
Warren Dailey. j (
Blown won the NCI tourney four i
years ago as a freshman, was run- j
ner-up in his sophomore year, and
I was eliminated in an early round
j last year. Last week, as Van Linge j
looked on, Brown aced the 130-yard i
J 15th hole here with a seven iron as j l
the boys got in some practice ses- '
sions. | J
Dailey, a veteran of four years, is : <
1 one of coach Bud Finger's most tal- j ;
I ented yet erratic players. Last week | 1

[ he showed the way against UCLA
j with a par 71.
S'IATEKS TOUGH
Finger expects the toughest chal
[ lenge for the team trophy to come
j from San Jose State. The Indians
j defeated the Spartans earlier in the
| season, 17Va to 9 1 / a, but each match
was close and could have gone ei
ther way. Finger is also wary of
Oregon and Oregon State, labeling
; them as "unknown quantities."
Playing for the varsity today, in
addition to Van Linge, Dailey, and
Brown, will he Phil Gctehell, Frank
Silliman, and John Brodie. It will
be Brodie's final links appearance
until late May as the sophomore will
ian-wer Chuck Taylor's spring loot
hall call Monday.
In addition to the varsity, such JV
and frosh hopefuls as John Forbush,
j Bill Cleyer, Dave DifVenderfer. Hon
Luceti, and Jim Rowley will be vy
-1 ing for team and individual honors.
Last year the frosh tied for second
and the JV's finished fourth.
