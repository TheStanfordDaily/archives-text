# Taylor Welcomes 80 Grid Hopefuls To Early Practice
## 
### 
Local gridiron critics will be in
terested observers when Coach
Chuck Taylor welcomes back some
80 grid hopefuls Monday for the
opening of spring practice. Included
among those expected to be on hand
will be 20 returning lettermen led by
1954 regulars Bob Gergen and John
Stewart, ends; Paul Wiggin, tackle;
Tony Mosich, guard; John Brodie
and Jerry Gustafson, quarterbacks;
Ernie Born and Gordy Young, half
backs; and Bill Tarr, fullback.
Taylor already has his practice
plans formulated into plenty of hard
work for his charges in an effort to
work off those extra pounds and
toughen the bodies. According to the
athletic department, next year's
schedule, which calls for the In
dians to face Ohio State, Michigan
State, and UCLA on successive
weekends, will be one of the best in
school history.
The next four weeks will feature
plenty of hard scrimmages under
game conditions. The coaching staff,
believing that next fall's fortunes
will be determined this spring, will
attempt to simulate exact game con
diions with uniforms, kickoffs, points
after touchdown attempts, and ap
proximate game length. Taylor stat
ed that this would be good expe
rience for his younger prospects.
The students and faculty are
heartily encouraged to come down
to the field and watch these scrim
mages, which will be held every
Monday, Thursday, and Saturday.
Taylor feels that good attendance
at these intrasquad battles will
strengthen team spirit. With the ex
cellent potential that the Indians
will have available next year, this
collective spirit may well go a long
way in determining whether the
Cards will be a great club or just
another eleven.
