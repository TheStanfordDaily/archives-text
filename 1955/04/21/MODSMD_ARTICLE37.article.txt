# Spicer Is Out Of SC Meet
## 
### 
Larry Spicer, a key runner on
Stanford's track team, will definitely
not be able to run in Saturday's
meet with the powerful USC Tro
jans in Stanford Stadium.
Spicer, who injured a muscle
while warming up before the Occi
dental meet last Saturday, has been
a valuable member of the Indian
mile relay team and a consistent
performer in the 440-yard dash.
With this exception, the squad
seems to be in good shape. Coach
Jack Weiershauser was enlightened
by the return of quarter-miler My
ron Hollister to action. Hollister,
who has been favoring a pulled
muscle for several weeks, will take
up some of the slack left by Spi
cer's absence.
