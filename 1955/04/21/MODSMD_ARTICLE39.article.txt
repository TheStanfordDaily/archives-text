# Stanford Sends 7 Entries To Ojai Tennis Tourney
## 
### 
The Ojai Tennis Tournament opens today with seven Stanford
racketmen entered in ihe four-day Southern California tourney.
The Farm entrants made the seven-hour trip to Ojai by car yes
terday afternoon.
Stanford sent its top six varsity players—-Jack Frost, Ernie Du-

Bray, Dave Duff, Bo!; Prince-, Roger
Keesing, and Bob Norton—to play
in the men's collegiate division. They
were accompanied by Coach Bob
Renker and manager Jim Hicks.
Card frosh Jackie Douglas, 30th
ranked U.S. men's singles player,
will also be playing in the tourney.
As he is ineligible to enter the col
legiate division, he will bo partici
pating in the men's open division.
Players from all the major PCC
schools -SC. UCLA, and Cal—will
be entered in the collegiate division
as well as the best players from the
smaller schools. The tournament
should be a good test of whether
Stanford's faltering squad is still
faltering or is going to settle down
to play tennis.

The Indians have lo.st all three of
j their first - round c o nference
; matches, playing for the most part
quite a bit below par. The way the
nelmen smashed a fairly good Mo
desto JC team, 8-1, Tuesday was en
couraging. Now Renker's squad
faces the same players that have
beaten them in every conference
match thus far this season.
Stanford's captain Jack Frost is a
i former juniors champion and is cur
rently the 12th ranked men's sin
i gles player in the nation. If he plays
| well he should be able to beat the
j best collegiate competition — Cal's
Clif Mayne, UCLA's Dave Duff,
i SC's Jacque Grigrey, and Pancho
j Contreras.
