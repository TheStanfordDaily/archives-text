# I Hear Music ...
## ROGER HAGAN 
### 
Last Sunday at Stanford, while sports-car fans moped around the
library and the Lake seeped further away, the Music Department
produced another excellent chamber concert in Cubberley. The
hall was packed.
A highlight of the program was the set of three American

Dances for string orchestra by Roger
Goeb. These are a much easier in
troduction to this man's work than
what most people identify him with,
his Third Symphony. This complex
work is available on a 12-inch RCA
LP, conducted by Stokowski.
The Dances are easily grasped.
Like the third movement of Goeb's
symphony and like much of Aaron
Copland's work, they are written in
the spirit of American folk material.
Unlike Copland's work, however,
the theme material is all original.
Compared with the symphony, the
Dances are uncomplex. They were
originally written (1952) lor the
CBS Symphony Orchestra, and were
designed to require a minimum of
rehearsal.
LONG APPLAUSE
It was hard to imagine the Dances
performed better by any group than

they were under Mr. Salgo. During
the long applause that followed,
composer Goeb, who has been teach
ing at Stanford this year, stood at
a signal from Dr. Salgo to meet the
audience. Greying, well-suited, once
a Juilliard School professor, he is
one of the top-ranking American
composers of the generation of Cop
land, Thompson, and Bernstein.
Goeb subscribes to no particular
"school" of modern composition. He
views with favor the probable addi
tion of jazz ideas to contempory mu
sic, but feels many past attempts
have been abortive.
Although he expects American
music to grow naturally away from
European tradition, he does not try
to make his music "uniquely Ameri
can," preferring to be part of the
furthering of world-wide musical
progress. The development of the
individual and his work, not of a
technique or separate national ex
pression, is most important to him.
NO PERFORMER
That is, the individual composer,
not the musician. Goeb looks for
ward with some glee to the elimi
nation of the performer. This is no
idle dream. In Germany and Amer
ica progress is being made in the
development of an electronic ma
chine which will produce sounds of
any pitch and timbre. These sounds,
distorted and combined by a tape
recorder, could someday be the
source of recorded music. Colum
bia's LP "Strange to Your Ears" is a
popular example of what a tape re
corder alone can do.
In San Jose's Civic Auditorium
tomorrow night, Dr. Salgo will con
duct the San Jose Symphony in an
all-French program. In the City the
C.O.P. Band will give a concert in
Nourse Auditorium. Both events arc
free. There is also a chamber con
cert at the Labaudt Gallery.
IN BERKELEY
Sunday night in Berkeley Little
Theater the Little Symphony Or
chestra will give a program includ
ing Bartok's Music for Strings, Per
cussion and Celeste. At Opus One,
Bach, Beethoven, and Schubert so
natas will be performed.
Next Tuesday night tenor Jan
Peerce will give a recital in the Op
era House. And Wednesday night
another Composers' Forum Concert
occurs in the Museum of Art.
Local gassers: the Hi-Lo's, Dave
Brubeck. Tjader, and perhaps, next
week, Chris Conner might show up.
