## Compiled from Dispatches of the United Press Ike Asks New Asian Aid Funds 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 20 â€”Presi-
dent Eisenhower asked Congress to
day to vote $3,530,000 in new foreign
aid funds next year, with the lion's
share going to build up free nations
in the "vast arc of free Asia."
The plan, outlined in a 5,000-word
message to the House and Senate,
ran into an immediate roadblock.
Chairman James P. Richards (D..
S.C.) said his House Foreign Affairs
Committee will hold up action until
after the Senate has acted.
In support of his request, the
President said "the immediate threat
to world security and stability is

now centered in Asia." He said
Asian development should be ac
celerated by the U.S., which has "the
capacity, the desire, and the con
cern" to help.
