# NATION'S BEST
## Card-Trojan Track Meet Depends Upon Weather Duel Scheduled For Tomorrow 
### BOB DURAND 
A team of determined, hope
ful Staniord trackmen are due to
challenge the powerful, unde
feated USC thinclads in what is
shaping up to be an interesting
meet tomorrow afternoon — if
nature's weather elements will
allow.
The field events are clue to begin
at 1:30 with the first race at 2.
According to Athletic News Di
rector Don Lcibendorfer, a definite
decision as to whether or not the
competition will take place will be
made later this morning when the
athletic directors of the two Uni
versities get together over the tele
phone.
At this writing, the chances of the
meet being run off seems to be slim.
Indian mentor Jack Weiershauser
insists that the two teams will not
meet on a sloppy track, and the
prospects today are for rain.
However, ii' the meet is not held
tomorrow, it will be rescheduled for
Monday afternoon, or at the earliest
possible date thereafter.
With Daylight Saving time in ef
fect, tentative plans call for a week
day competition to start at 5:30 p.m.
to allow for the local businessmen
to attend, according to Leibendorfer.
This procedure was followed four
years ago when the USC meet was
rained out.
TROJANS THE BEST
In the last three weeks, the fast
improving Tribe • cindermen have
lost to three of the best track teams
in the country. In the Trojans, they
face the best.
SC Coach Jess Mortensori will be
bringing with him a colorful and
talented array of runners, jumpei's,
and throwers who have had little
or no trouble with their competition
so far this spring. Just last Satur
day, they swamped California, 107 \'i
to 23'1 j.
Among the Trojans who will be
competing are the world's best high
jumper Ernie Shelton, 56Vz shot
putter Ray Martin, 167-7 discus
thrower Des Goch, 4:11.7 miler Sid
Wing, and 9:11.1 two-miler Fer
nando Ledesma.
Despite these and other capable
Southern California performers, the

Indians are expecting to give the

Coach Weiershauser will be look

ish in front in the 440, and possibly
Frank Herrmann to beat out Jon
Arnett in the broad jump.
POINTS IN SPRINTS
In the 100- and 220-yard dashes,
Weiershauser is placing his aspira
tions with Keith Brownsberger and
Jim Saras to cop at least nine of
the 18 points in the two events. To
do this, they will have to contend
with Trojans Howard Bugbee and
Pat Coyle.
The Indian mentor hopes for
"come throughs" by Wil King in the
mile, Chuck Strong in the two-rnile,
and Bill Flint in the pole vault. All
three of these men will be facing
top-flight opposition, but an out
standing performance might bring
results.
Second- and third-place points
will be important in the meet as
usual. Among the Stanfordites fall
ing into this category are shotputters
A 1 Cheney and Phil Brabyn, discus
tossers Bob Kimball and Jim Truher,
and 880-yard runner Ford Sims.
Needless to say, the Tribe won't
be worrying about a first in the high
jump. Shelton leaped 0-11 last year,
and this year, he has done 6-10 al
ready. Last week against Cal, he
just barely missed three chances
with the bar at a world record
6-11 : *4.
POLK VAULT TOuGII
The Trojans' Floyd Jeter has done
6-8 in that event and will most
likely earn a second. However, the
Cards' John Stewart, Phil Fehlen,
and Norm Jiles are not ready to
concede that position.
USC's mile relay quartet of Lanny
Quigley, Bert Purdue, Howard Smith
and Mike Larrabee should not en
counter too much opposition from
the Indians. The Troy baton-pass
ers have recorded 3:15.6 best time
this spring and could do better.
The Tribe again will be without
two of their four runners. Larry
Spicer has been out all week with a
muscle pull, and Myron Hollister re
injured his leg on Wednesday.
