## Card-Trojan Track Meet Depends Upon Weather Duel Scheduled For Tomorrow 
### BOB DURAND 
A team of determined, hope
ful Staniord trackmen are due to
challenge the powerful, unde
feated USC thinclads in what is
shaping up to be an interesting
meet tomorrow afternoon — if
nature's weather elements will
allow.
The field events are clue to begin
at 1:30 with the first race at 2.
According to Athletic News Di
rector Don Lcibendorfer, a definite
decision as to whether or not the
competition will take place will be
made later this morning when the
athletic directors of the two Uni
versities get together over the tele
phone.
At this writing, the chances of the
meet being run off seems to be slim.
Indian mentor Jack Weiershauser
insists that the two teams will not
meet on a sloppy track, and the
prospects today are for rain.
However, ii' the meet is not held
tomorrow, it will be rescheduled for
Monday afternoon, or at the earliest
possible date thereafter.
With Daylight Saving time in ef

day competition to start at 5:30 p.m.
to allow for the local businessmen
to attend, according to Leibendorfer.
This procedure was followed four
years ago when the USC meet was
rained out.

and throwers who have had little
or no trouble with their competition
so far this spring. Just last Satur
day, they swamped California, 107 \'i
to 23'1 j.
Among the Trojans who will be
competing are the world's best high
jumper Ernie Shelton, 56Vz shot
putter Ray Martin, 167-7 discus
thrower Des Goch, 4:11.7 miler Sid
Wing, and 9:11.1 two-miler Fer
nando Ledesma.
Despite these and other capable
Southern California performers, the
