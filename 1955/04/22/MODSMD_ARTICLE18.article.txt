test, frosh rank and filers have cried, "Just wait!"—till the big day tomorrow, we suppose.

DE-WHISKERED—PauI Williams, frosh class president, was caught yesterday by an unidenti
fied group of hawk-eyed sophs who promptly proceeded to put the razor to the prexy's proud
chin patch. With their leader being removed so disrespectfully from the beard-growing con
test, frosh rank and filers have cried, "Just wait!"—till the big day tomorrow, we suppose.
Intense interclass rivalry, rambling loudly on campus in the
past few days, will erupt tomorrow as underclassmen battle it
out for the glory of victory and the winner's trophy in the annual
Frosh-Soph Jamboree.
A series of races, contests and sports events, including the

traditional" tug-o'-war in the mud,"*
will highlight the Jamboree and de
termine who gets the victory tro
phy.
The decision will be announced at
the Jamboree Dance in Mangini's
Barn at midnight.
Both sides have been marshaling
their forces. Yesterday, numerous
voodoo dolls emblazoned with the
numeral '57, and complete with pins,
appeared on campus.
