# Trivia and wasted time ......an editorial

### 
On i uosday and Wednesday the Associated
Students voted themselves a new constitution,
and Wednesday night the Executive Commit
tee of the outgoing government demonstrated
one reason why a new constitution was needed.
A large, useless chunk of Wednesday night's
meeting was devoted to word-by-word hag
gling in full Excorn otfer the proposed by-lav/
changes of a few campus organizations. This
kind of thing has gone on all year, right through
the constitution discussions. Excom has con
cerned itself for hour after tedious hour with
commas, capital?'Ttion, and connotation. It's a
job which threo intelligent people could do for
them in half the time and, quite possibly, with
twice the success.
Strangely enough, Excom did have a consti
tution committee. We sometimes wonder why.
Matters were referred io this committee and the
re ports returned were worked over again, with
nothing but a duplication of effort, in Excom. A

rare exception to this unfortunate state of af
fairs was the action taken when constitution
talks were lagging badly at spring vacation
time. Then the constitution committeee sat
through the vacation, drew up recommenda
tions on several remaining points of contro
versy, cind watched them win/, through Excom
in 45 minutes.
It can be done and it should be done. The
Legislature in the new setup will be laiger than
the Excom it replaces. We fear the thought of
an even larger body considering verb forms
in. full meeting. We hope that the new Legis
lature will be willing to sot up subcommittees
and then put so me faith in them.
It's a jealous government indeed which
won't delegate the bulk of its minutiae to com
mittee. There are things which government
must do which it can't do if it wustes its time
on trivia. We hope the Legislature will realise
this - -Excom never did.
