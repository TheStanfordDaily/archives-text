The recent cancellation of the Russian stu
dent newspaper editors' proposed visit to the
United States and to Stanford has caused
much comment here and elsewhere.
People are asking themselves. "Why?"
Many are disappointed to see the Red scribes
stay on their side of the iron curtain.
No one knows for certain the reason behind
the seeminq back out of the editors just as ihey
were to embark Idr this country from England.
And it's certain that no one in this country,
outside of perhaps State Department officials,
can know the real truth behind the move.
Of course it simply could be that the Rus
sian group w.-:: completely honest when
they relu-sed tb trip on iheir assertion that the
fingerprints required of all U.S. visitors weie
"strictly for criminals, undignified."
Here at Stanford student opinions on the
canceled visit art- varied. Some typical com
ments are:
Den Cohen, '58: "If we're willing to let thern
come, they should meet us halfway. We're not
depriving them of any liberties by asking them
to qet finqerprinted."
Jim Gilkey, '58: "They have a perfect right
not to want to qet fingerprinted. If the object
of their trip is to observe a democratic system
at work, we should not begin our illustrations
by usinq police state tactics."
Carol Lynch, '56: ". . . This represents a
great ss in the interchange of ideas."
Levin, qiaduate student: "My gen
i-ral feeling is that the Russians were looking
for an r xcuse not to come. In a country where
everyone is fingerprinted and always carries
many different identifications, their excuse for
not cominq seems like a minor point."

Larry Stewart, '58: "... 1 must sympathize
with their refusal. I feel a government has no
right to fingerprint people except at the re
quest of its citizens for personal identifications ■
or to keep track of criminal offenders, in any •
other case fingerprinting is an infringement of
personal rights."
Others think that the fingerprinting "alibi" is
merely one of any number of excuses that the ,
Reds would have come up with. They say that
Russia would never allow any of their people
to visit our country, where "they couldn't help
but receive a favorable impression."
One also hears the assumption that ihe
whole thing was a propaganda device and that
Russia was quite surprised when the U.S.
okayed the visit.
In commentinq on the cancellation Moscow
newspapers said that the editors had been"de- ;
jjrived of visitinq the U.S." They also noted I
that a group of Russian chess players had vis
ited the United States recently without beinq
subjected to fingerprinting. U.S. government
officials call this an "oversight," since the fin
gerprinting requirement has been part of U.S.
law since 1940.
American officials have commented that
Russia never wanted the students to come
here, and used the fingerprinting as an "ex
cuse" to try to pin an iron curtain label on this
country.
The reasons behind the cancellation are mud
dled but one thing is certain that Stanford
and the nation at large have missed a fine op
portunity to let the editors observe how the
"other half" lives; working, studying, and just |
plain loafing in the American way.
