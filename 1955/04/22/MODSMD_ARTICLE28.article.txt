# Indian Nine Dares Uclans In Double Bill at Westwood
## 
### BILL NICHOLS 
fighting to remain in contention for the CIBA crown, the Stan
ford baseball team challenges UCLA twice this weekend in Los
Angeles. The Cards are currently in third place with a 5-3 record.
The Bruins are one notch above with a 4-2 record. Both teams
need sweeps of the two-game series to remain in contention with

U.S.C. The Trojans are idle today
and tomorrow.
Dean's baseballers left yesterday,
and meet UCLA today and tomor
row on Joe E. Brown Field. Ray
Young, who pitched Stanford to an
11-2 win over the Uclans in the two
teams' only other encounter, will
hurl the game this afternoon and
Walt Payne will get the call tomor
row. Ed Verdurmen and Ken Brown
will be in the bull pen.
Young's win three weeks ago
against the Bruins' ace, Don Nichols,
was his only conference win to date,
and Dean is hoping the sinewy
right-hander can repeat. Young al
lowed only eight hits in that game
and kept them well spaced. Don
Nichols, UCLA ace, got his only loss
of the year in that game and is
scheduled to seek revenge on Fri
day. UCLA's Saturday starter is un
determined, although either Tom
O'Donnell or Carroll Adams may get
the nod.
SAI> STICKMEN
The Stanford hitters, who have
slumped oil' just as suddenly as they
started, will take aim at the spacious
Bruin outfield. Rudy Figueroa, still
the leading Card sticker, will go into
today's game with a .462 mark.
Rich Scramaglia and Len Swartz
are the only other stickers over the
. .'5OO level.
The remainder of the starters
have not wielded the willow too
successfully this season. Hal Mess
ner, whose timely triple broke op

r
the Santa Clara game, is hitting only
.230. Second baseman Mickey Holz
man boasts a microscopic .169 fig
ure although he is second in walks
with 14. Dick Workman leads the
picketmen with .309, and Bob Ev
ans is a clo.-e second with .291. Sid
Hall brings up the rear with .231.
The Bruins boast a hard-hitting
lineup led by Bill Heil with a .500
record in league play. He is the
burly Uclan who threw the football
block on Swartz, when he was
thrown out on the tail end of a
third-to-home double play.
WEAK ON PITCHING
UCLA is the only team to beat
USC in league play this year, but.
after their ace, Don Nichols, the
mound staff is thin. Bruin coach Art
Reichle has put together the best
ball club seen at Westwood for a
number of years, and his squad
seems to have the best chance of
catching the high-flying Trojans.
The Cards, who have only one re
maining game away from home af
ter this weekend, play USC twice
more, but even wins in both won't
do them any good if they cannot
pickle the Westwooders in this one.
