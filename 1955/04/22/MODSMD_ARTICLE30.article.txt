# Cleggmen Seek Win From Cubs On Wet Diamond
## 
### 
Stanford's frosh baseball nine will
5 be after revenge tomorrow morning
when they host the California Cubs
on the irosh diamond at 10 o'clock.
The freshman club from Berkeley
won the first tilt in their three-game
series two weeks ago, and the Card
yearlings must sweep the next two
contests to ga\n victory in the se
ries.
The Cups scored six runs in the
first two innings of the opener off
Papoose hurler George Avery and
coasted to the triumph. The Clef.'g
rnen are determined to keep from
being surprised early again.
The rain Oils week has kept the
J Papooses from their usual training
j schedule. An encounter with Menlo
: Atherton High on Wednesday was
! canceled, and the wet grounds
throughout the week h;tve made
practice very rough.
Expected to start for the frosh are
Phil Castellucci, A 1 Shaw, Bob
Flanders, and' Bob Dwight in the
infield, Wayne West, Gordy Me
daris, and A 1 Spurgeon in the out
field, and Doug Camilli behind the
plate. Avery may hurl again for the
Papooses although he has been suf
fering with a .slightly sore arm.
