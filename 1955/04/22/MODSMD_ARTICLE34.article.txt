# Frosh Meet May Wash Out, Too
## 
### 
Frosh cindermen may have to
tackle Angell Field in hip boots to
morrow morning if present weather
continues. The yearlings are sched
uled tor a three - way meet with
Oakland JC and Stockton College at
10:30. However, unless' the track
does some fast drying out, the meet
will probably be called off.
Coach Ray Dean seemed doubtful
about the meet since weather reports
call lor more, rain today and posÂ»
sibly tomorrow.
