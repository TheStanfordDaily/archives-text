# Card Sharks Host Bruins At Encina Pool Tomorrow
## 
### 
Looking for their third straight win, Stanford's varsity swimming
team will face the UCLA Bruins tomorrow in a meet scheduled for
10 a.m. in the Encina Pool.
Leading the Indians will be Larry Heim, who set a new PCC rec
ord in the individual medley last Saturday against Cah Heim

should win easily tomorrow as the
fastest UCLA lime is 12 seconds
over his record.
The Bruins, who possess a 2-4
record this season, will be decided
underdogs against the powerful In
dians. The only Bruin threat will
probably be in the* 300-yard medley
relay, as their team of Bob Doner
Dave Drum, and Vance Miller has
been constantly improving.
Oilier probable winners for the

Cards are Phil Gay in the 50-yard
freestyle and Ron Grunt in the 200-
j yard backstroke. The Indians should
| garner numerous second and third
! places to cinch the meet.
The Cards have two top relay
teams, both of which should win
handily. The 300*-yard medley relay
team and the 400-yard relay team
! both have records better than the
i Uclans.
