# Residences to Discuss Honor Code Tonight
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Discussions of the Honor Code, with special emphasis placed on
the recent Code clarification, will be held tonight during house
meetings at every residence on campus.
This University-wide program has been instituted by the Honor
Code Committee under Ann Irvine to educate the Stanford stu-

► dent about every facet of his Honor
System.
Over 150 speakers have been
trained by Miss Irvine's committee
over the past two weeks to lead ed
ucation and discussion programs in
the various living groups.
The program is primarily one of
direct education by the speakers,
but questions and student discussion
will be encouraged. The speakers
will refer back to the Honor Code
Committee any discussions, recom
mendations, or questions that come
up.
The committee will then attempt
to answer these questions through
The Daily and will pass any sug
gestions on to the Fundamental
Standard Committee.
The discussions are primarily an
attempt to answer all questions aris
ing from the clarification made in
the Honor Code last quarter speci
fying that examinations will be
taken from the clasroom only with
the consent of the instructor, pro
vided that alternate seating is avail
able.
NEW SYSTEM
Under the new system, a student
may remove his exam from the room
only when the instructor has given
him special permission or when al
ternate seating is not available.
The student himslf is free to leave
the exam room at any time.
The professor is asked by the
committee to remain available to the
students for the first 10 minutes of
the examination and then advise the
students as to where he will be for
the continuation of the exam.
Permission to leave the room will
be granted only when absolutely
necessary and before the student
starts taking the exam. The profes
sor is asked to tell the students
on the day before the exam whether
adequate seating will be provided.
ALTERNATE SEATS
If alternate seating is not pro
vided. no one will be required to re
main in the exam room.
Miss Irvine's committee has also
suggested that students avoid all
suspicious actions while taking ex
ams. It has been requested that
they refrain from unnecessary talk
ing or referring to notes, books, or
papers during the exams.
The committee has also specified
that there will be no smoking in the
classroom during exams.

trained by Miss Irvine's committee
over the past two weeks to lead ed
ucation and discussion programs in
the various living groups.
The program is primarily one of
direct education by the speakers,
but questions and student discussion
will be encouraged. The speakers
will refer back to the Honor Code
Committee any discussions, recom
mendations, or questions that come
up.
The committee will then attempt
to answer these questions through
The Daily and will pass any sug
gestions on to the Fundamental
Standard Committee.
The discussions are primarily an
attempt to answer all questions aris
ing from the clarification made in
the Honor Code last quarter speci
fying that examinations will be
taken from the clasroom only with
the consent of the instructor, pro
vided that alternate seating is avail
able.
NEW SYSTEM
Under the new system, a student
may remove his exam from the room
only when the instructor has given
him special permission or when al
ternate seating is not available.
The student himslf is free to leave
the exam room at any time.
The professor is asked by the
committee to remain available to the
students for the first 10 minutes of
the examination and then advise the
students as to where he will be for
the continuation of the exam.
Permission to leave the room will
be granted only when absolutely
necessary and before the student
starts taking the exam. The profes
sor is asked to tell the students
on the day before the exam whether
adequate seating will be provided.
ALTERNATE SEATS
If alternate seating is not pro
vided. no one will be required to re
main in the exam room.
Miss Irvine's committee has also
suggested that students avoid all
suspicious actions while taking ex
ams. It has been requested that
they refrain from unnecessary talk
ing or referring to notes, books, or
papers during the exams.
The committee has also specified
that there will be no smoking in the
classroom during exams.
