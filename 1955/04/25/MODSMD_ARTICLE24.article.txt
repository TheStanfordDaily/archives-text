# your honor code...... an editorial
## 
### 
Tonight in every campus living group meet
ing, discussion leaders trained by the Honor
Code Subcommittee of ASSU will explain ihe
if vised interpretation of the Honor Code which
w<;nt into effect at the beginning of this quarter.
This is the controversial interpretation which
will keep examinations in classrooms in all
i r ,ts given at Stanford, unless inadequate
seating is | rovided or the professor specili
i ally permits individuals or the entire class to
leavi th»• examination toorn.
Tl. int^iprot.ition, rendered by the snbcom
ii i'!• -. I till'larri' iilal Standard Committor', and

Council for Student Control last quarter, has
excited very little student comment of any
kind. The administration and faculty like the
new interpretation, and some students have
spoken for it, but not with any deep feeling.
This is a matter which deserves student at
tention and thought. Tonighi, discussion lead
ers will seek questions and comments on the
inf- ipretation. Be ready to state your views.
Stanford's Honor Code setup is widely looked
up to and has been copied on o'.her campuses;
it's one of our finest institutions at Stanford.
It's yciii Honoi Code and it;: interpretation is
yow business.
