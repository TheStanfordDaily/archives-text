This ir. Con Home Week!
'I In ; is the week when Stanfords pitch in for
all Con Home tads and extend that helping
hand. The week booms off today when the
polls open in the King and Queen race Stan
loml's only regal derby of the year. Off-campus
felicitations will be made today by exuberant
irosh. As the headline read on the Daily's gal
ley proof last week just before it was killed
out, "Frosh Men lo Help Co-eds Solicit."
Strawberry Brunch, and it's good for you 100,
will be offered in Union's festival court Wed
riesday, and the ever famous all-campus barbe
cue will be held Thursday on the Con Home
grounds. The barbecue, of course, terminates
Work Day activity as thousands of hungry stu
dents will lay down their tools after a day's
labor to partake of the succulent repast.
The Intermezzo Series, always a treat rather
than a treatment, has another excellent film in
view for flick fanatics as it unreels "The Bicycle
Thief" tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 in Cubber
l(,y. This rare Italian film unwinds the story of
a broken hearted sports car fan who fails to
raise enough loot to purchase a Jag or Ferrari.
He steals a Schwinn and discovers a way to
get more spokes to the mile.
He enlers the Mille de Migna despite the
criticisms of his so-called friends who call him
"mad, mad, mad." Racing against the top cars
in the world, he finishes last.
Now that we've set our sundials ahead an
hour il looks like there'll be bigger and better
twilight doings. This will be the case if the
Athletic Department has anything to say about
il. They have rescheduled the USC track meet
for tomorrow evening at 5:45. The method be

hind the madness is lo calch the commuter
f< m:: and build one's appetite (or the barbecue
due to one's missing of dinner.
As soon as the track meet is curtailed the
Tuesdjy Series fan will just have lime to catch
his breath and hustle o'ei to Mem Aud to hear
a dissertation on "Forerunners of the Modern
Orchestra." Otto Kinkeldey of the Cal Music
Department will do the honors.
W» dnesday's Theater Matinee looks pretty
good in my book as Stirling Huntley will give
"A Lighting Demonstration of Color." You've
probably often wondered what would happen
with the mere flip of a high-voltage switch.
Now you'll know what experts the world over
have been guessing. The power of . . . ah,
but we're getting ahead of ourselves.
A weird tale of suspense will be told at the
Sunday Night Flicks with the presentation of
"Strangers on a Train." A passionate struggle
over a girl (Ruth Roman) by Bruno (Robert
Walker) and a tennis star (Farley Granger) is
enacted with dramatic impact. Don't miss the
gigantic screen battle in which a bully conduc
tor punches a ticket. Thank you, Crazy Otto.
SLEEPER OF THE WEEK— B'gorrah the Min
eral Sciences Journal Club has done it again.
Practically week after week they've hung up
there with the darkhorse events and this one is
no exception. "Structure of the East Africa Rift
Valleys" will be the topic under consideration
today at that home away from home, Room 320.
It's a rolling moose that gathers no stones.. ..

As soon as the track meet is curtailed the
Tuesdjy Series fan will just have lime to catch
his breath and hustle o'ei to Mem Aud to hear
a dissertation on "Forerunners of the Modern

Department will do the honors.
W» dnesday's Theater Matinee looks pretty
good in my book as Stirling Huntley will give
"A Lighting Demonstration of Color." You've
probably often wondered what would happen
with the mere flip of a high-voltage switch.
Now you'll know what experts the world over
have been guessing. The power of . . . ah,
but we're getting ahead of ourselves.
A weird tale of suspense will be told at the
Sunday Night Flicks with the presentation of
"Strangers on a Train." A passionate struggle
over a girl (Ruth Roman) by Bruno (Robert
Walker) and a tennis star (Farley Granger) is
enacted with dramatic impact. Don't miss the
gigantic screen battle in which a bully conduc

SLEEPER OF THE WEEK— B'gorrah the Min
eral Sciences Journal Club has done it again.
Practically week after week they've hung up
there with the darkhorse events and this one is
no exception. "Structure of the East Africa Rift
Valleys" will be the topic under consideration
today at that home away from home, Room 320.
It's a rolling moose that gathers no stones.. ..
This ir. Con Home Week!
'I In ; is the week when Stanfords pitch in for
all Con Home tads and extend that helping
hand. The week booms off today when the
polls open in the King and Queen race Stan
loml's only regal derby of the year. Off-campus
felicitations will be made today by exuberant
irosh. As the headline read on the Daily's gal
ley proof last week just before it was killed
out, "Frosh Men lo Help Co-eds Solicit."
Strawberry Brunch, and it's good for you 100,
will be offered in Union's festival court Wed
riesday, and the ever famous all-campus barbe
cue will be held Thursday on the Con Home
grounds. The barbecue, of course, terminates
Work Day activity as thousands of hungry stu
dents will lay down their tools after a day's
labor to partake of the succulent repast.
The Intermezzo Series, always a treat rather
than a treatment, has another excellent film in
view for flick fanatics as it unreels "The Bicycle
Thief" tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 in Cubber
l(,y. This rare Italian film unwinds the story of
a broken hearted sports car fan who fails to
raise enough loot to purchase a Jag or Ferrari.
He steals a Schwinn and discovers a way to
get more spokes to the mile.
He enlers the Mille de Migna despite the
criticisms of his so-called friends who call him
"mad, mad, mad." Racing against the top cars
in the world, he finishes last.
Now that we've set our sundials ahead an
hour il looks like there'll be bigger and better
twilight doings. This will be the case if the
Athletic Department has anything to say about
il. They have rescheduled the USC track meet
for tomorrow evening at 5:45. The method be
