## Lewis Listed In Who's Who 
### ELLEN SPIEGL 
Under the name Lewis, Clar
ence 1., in Who's Who is an im
' pressive list of degrees and
teaching positions in many of
j the finest schools in the United
States.
This year the position of guest
lecturer in philosophy, Stanford
University, may be added to the
J compilation. Professor Lewis has
I been teaching here this year and .will
! be on the faculty again for the 1955-
j 5G academic year.
A tall, slender man with white
[ hair and a white mustache, Profes
| sor Lewis is considered one of the
J leading contemporary philosophers in
| the United States.
He began his teaching career in
| 1910 at Harvard University, where
j he previously had received the A.B
I and Ph.D. degrees.
He has since been on the teach -
J ing staffs at the University of Cali
fornia, Columbia, Princeton, and the
University of Colorado. Professor
J Lewis also has several awards and
j honorary degrees to his credit.
IDEAL VS. SCIENCE
When asked what practical appli
j cations he believed were available to
| students of philosophy, he replied in
his resonant, pleasant voice that in
his day"The Darwinian-Spenserian

influence led many students to ques- |
tion values and beliefs they had held
previously."
"Today," lie continued, "students j
are led to philosophy by a vague
conflict between their ideals and
science. This is a naive point of j
view to be sure, but after being in- |
traduced to philosophy they find
they need to establish more con- j
I cretely their values and aims."
"And 1 like to believe," he added,
"that students want to know what j
makes this world tick, see what j
could be better, and donate their j
individual contributions." A second '

practical application of philosophy,
according to Professor Lewis, is the
training in logical thinking processes.
When asked if he found any aca
demic difference between Eastern
and Western schools, Professor Lew
is laughed deeply and adjusted his
pince-niz before answering. "Intel
lectually there is little difference,"
he replied. "But there is a congen
iality easier to find in tin atino: |.heiv
of Western schools.'
HOME IN THE WEST
"My first contact with the West
was at the University of Colorado,"
Professor Lewis volunteered. "And
in those days it actually was the
West."
He went on to say that although he
was born in Massachusetts, today he
and his wife consider California
their home. One of their sons and
his family live in Menlo Park, while
their other son works on the edi
torial staff for the television produc
tion Omnibus.
Professor Lewis is at present
working on a book concerning ethics
to be published in the near future.
In reply to a question about his
writing, his eyes flashed and he
smiled as he answered, "Oh, yes,
I'm working on a book now. There's
always a book on my desk, but that
doesn't mean anything. I've only
published four!" The works about
which he teems so modest include
"Survey of Symbolic Logic." pub
lished in 1918, "The Mind and the
World-Order, Symbolic Logic," and
"An Analysis of Knowledge and Val
uation," which were published in
more recent years.
