### EDA MENDELS 
The opinions you give your
roommate about your professors
are likely to be the same as the
other students tell their friends.
This is one of the findings from a
study-of teaching evaluation carried
on at the University of Washington.
A progress report. "The Evaluation
of Teaching," by E. R. Guthrie, has
recently been published, and two
copies of the pamphlet have been
placed on the seven - day book
shelves at the Main Library.
Student judgments arc fairly con
sistent, surveys showed. Under
grads and grad students tend to
agree in their over-all evaluations
of teaching effectiveness.
The most frequently mentioned
fault of pooi- teachers was sarcasm
and belittling, the pollsters lound.
The question of whether students
value entertainment above knowl
edge was not conclusively answered
by the surveys.
In the ratings, instructors ranked
"significantly below" associates, the
next rung up the ladder, and below
assistant professors. Except for
these, there was "very slight im
provement from one rank to the
other."
The booklet sought to explain
this: "It appears probable that any
increase of teaching skill in the
higher ranks tends to be offset by
losses of enthusiasm and leisure, and
the increased preoccupation with af
fairs other than teaching that comes
with added years on a college cam
pus."
Different studies showed "little if
any relation between size of class
and the ratings assigned the instruc
tor," slight differences between the
evaluation by majors and non-ma
jors, and scarcely any relation be
tween student evaluation of the in
structor and the student's grade.
