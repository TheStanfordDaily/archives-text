The Hammer and Coffin Society is
a magazine publishing oranization'
which exists for the purpose of put- !
ting out the Chaparral. It handles i
both the financial and editorial poli- |

cies of the Chappie.
This organization, so legend has it,
was founded on April 17, 1906, just
before the San Francisco earth
quake. There is also a rumor that
the Old Boy was so happy to have
a society formed in his honor that
he caused the quake by testing his
silver hammer.
The Hammer and Coffin Society is
a national organization. Once it con
tained 20 chapters, although at pres
ent only the one at Stanford re
mains. A move is now uiwer way
to revive some of the deceased
branches on other campuses.
