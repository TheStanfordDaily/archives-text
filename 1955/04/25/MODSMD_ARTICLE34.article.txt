## DOUBLE LOSS Cards Toppled By Bruin Nine 
### BILL NICHOLS 
Stanford was virtually elimi
nated from the CIBA race this
weekend, as the team dropped
two games to UCLA, 1-11 and
7-11. It rained on Friday so the
two teams played a double
header on Saturday.
From the Card point of view it
should never have stopped raining.
The Indians are now four games be
hind USC with six games to play.
Walt Payne took his lumps in the j
first game. The Bruins took a first- i
inning lead when Dixie Workman |
misjudged Darryl West%rfeld's fly to
right and it went for a triple, scor- i
ing Jim Decker. Stanford tied it up
briefly. Rudy Figueroa was safe on
an error, moved to second as Len
Swartz went out, and scored on Bob
Evans' one-baser to left.
But the Uclans blew the game
wide open in the fourth. Payne
walked the bases loaded and several
hits and a homer into the track
stands by Decker pushed seven runs
across the plate.
COCKY DON
The Indian batters collected only j
six hits, all singles, off of Bruin ace {
cocky Don Nichols. Although he
struck out only one. Nichols kept
the Cards in the hole with his curve ;
ball, until the eighth when here- j
tired in favor of Tom O'Donnell.
The second game was much the
same. Stanford picked up seven hits
against John White and made seven
runs, but UCLA had a commanding
10-1 lead at the end of the fourth
inning, and coasted after that.
CLOSING RALLY
Triples by Jack Willis, Westerfeld,
and Decker were the big blows, and
Bill Heil banged out three safeties.
Stanford made the score somewhat j
respectable with a two-run homer j
to left center by Evans in the sixth, J
and a four-run stanza to close out i

the seven-inning game.
Figueroa surrendered his batting
leadership as he went one for seven
in the two games. Bill Heil, who was
second, overhauled him with a four
for-eight effort.
