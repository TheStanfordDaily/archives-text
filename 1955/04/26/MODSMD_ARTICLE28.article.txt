Odds and ends: The Columbia Spectator re
cently published an editorial entitled "Alpha
bet Soup." It was a plea to professors to give
criticism as well as letter grades on tests . . .
Aljo at Columbia, a contest has been started
to "name the un-named street." It seems that
the main street of the university has been trav
eling without any sort of name since the uni
versity was founded.
Neki Hokey may be Dick Tracy's latest com
ment but at Cornell, its' NERCK! The Cornell
Daily Sun has been running it everywhere in
the paper ... A student at San Jose State sent
a "prose poexn" to the Spartan Daily claiming
tiiat "San Jose State looks into the great mirror
of life and leaves not a reflection on it." . . .
The advertisement of the year comes from
the Campus Chronicle of Pacific Union College
at Angwin, California. One morose - looking
boy saying, "Why was I born to keep falling
for girls in dresses from the Fashion Shop . . . ?"
The Colorado Daily is all agog over a new
rule that permits senior women "in good stand

ing" to come in at whatever hour they wish.
Nc more lock-out . . . The University of Oregon
Daily happily reported that "an overflow
crowd" attended the first Condon Lecture by
Dr. Robert Oppenheimer. His topic was "The
Subnuclear Zoo" . . .
The Battalion of Texas A&M announced re
cently that no master which direction one might
take in entering the small town of Bryan, near
the college, one would find a different popu
lation num&ei. No one in the town knows ex
actly which sign is correct, the paper reported,
and".hey are waiting for the next census to
find out which ones need changing . .
Every college paper from New York (Colum
bia Spectator) to Texas (University of Texas
Daily) is listing rules and regulations for, as
well as entrances in Spring Sing contests. Most
frequeni number chosen by houses and living
groups appears to be a "Brigadoon Medley" .. .
Spring elections are taking up space in many
college papers also. Everybody's getting new
officers or new constitutions . . .
And that's all there is . . .


SPRING SING'S CCMING . . . ON OTHER CAMPUSES, TOO (See below)
