"Those ore the ;imes ihat try men's souls"
was the way ihat old Tom Paine put it.
Tom, by the way, passed on quite a few other
offerings thai never attained such high repute.
Like there was the ume he 35id "Have another
beer, Charley old fossil," in a moment of por
tentous folly, or the time when he eloquently
1 allied the forces with his memorable "Jinkies,
it's hot in here!"
Well Tom, you gay dcvil-may-care madcap
old wag you, you have hit it in the proverbial
bullseye. Because soul-trying lime is here
again. Midterms.
I'm new here, but the way I get this rnid
leim jay is this: they are unique creations
hatched in moments of professorial abandon
designed to cultivate in the s'.udent a feeling of
sincere hoplelessness. They are spaced ade
quately throughout the quarter, starting some
times about now, so the plodding coolie can
feel equally hopeless at any anu all times. Any

relevancy !o the course, the final, or the girl
three seats down is skillfully omitted from the
midterm. They separate the men from the
women. Women—above the median. Men —
below it.
Now, not being a reformer by nature, I can't
think cf anything offhand to take the place of
midterms.
Torn, though, probably could. He'd come up,
with a Boston Tea Party or something. Or at
least the ever-appropriate "Damn :he torpedoes,
full speed ahead!"
This tea party has limitless possibilities. Pic
ture it if you can. Teabag upon teabag washing
up on the gradiose shores of glimmering Lake
Laguni a. Lemon sales in Palo Alto at a record
high. Professors boycotting all grocery £ .ores,
trying to prevent the sales cf tea, stacking old
midterms like sandbags barring the door to
every store.
And, wi.t'h a little luck and a lot of tea, it
rnighi even raise the level of the lake!
