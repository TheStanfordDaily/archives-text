# 'East of Eden' Stands Up Well

### JACK BYRNE 
"East of Eden," now at the
Varsity, stands up as a good pic
ture —even though director Elia
Kazan goes ovei board in a good
many places.
The story, taken from John Stein
beck's modern taJe of Cain and Abel,

has been edited
down enough to
tell in little more
than an hour. In
Iri m m in g the
story, a tfood deal
of background has
had to be elimi
nated: The basic
conflict between

Aaron (Abel) aiyl Caleb (Cain) ap
pears without any explanation of
their boyhood. Mother Kate becomes
bawdy-house Kate—but her revolt
from the all-good Adam Trask is
never shown on the screen. In short,
in trimming the story, a lot of the
meaning and significance has been
lost.

Also in the process, much of the
meaning has been exchanged be
tween the characters. Kate, who was
so important to the Steinback story,
loses much of her influence on Caleb.
Abra, the sweet little-girl-next-door
type, becomes a sex character in the
film.
Director Kazan, never noted for
his restraint, has gone overboard on
this film when it comes to develop
ing weird camera angles, diffuse ef
fects, and similar gimmicks. Cine
mascope has saved him in this re
spect: many of his effects would have
been lost on the old small screen.
Occasionally it's laid on a bit thick,
but by and large it's good.
The acting? Raymond Massey does
a superb job of portraying Adam,
considering the limitations imposed
on him by the tore-shortened plot.
Jame; Dean is a sufficiently compe
tent Caleb, if a little overplayed at

times. Julie Harris, on the other
hand, is just a bit too simpering and
a bit too forced for Abra. Richard
Davalos as Aaron is unsatisfying, in
| a role lull of potential, he just doesn't
I quite carry it off.
But all in all, the picture is worth
i the tariff, if only for the pleasure of
seeing Truth, Goodness, and; 111 >.ueh
triumph.
