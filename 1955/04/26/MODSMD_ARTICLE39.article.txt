Because A 1 Masters, Stanford's athletic director, hopes to gain a little
coin from the Stanford-USC trackmeet which was postponed for two weeks
yesterday, the meet is scheduled for 5:45. This is so that commuters can
come to the event.
Commuters pays $1.20 to see the meet; students, $0.50. This difference is
enough to cause the meet to be scheduled at dinner hour so that students
have their choice of missing dinner or missing the first half of the spikef'est.
Commuters who work in San Francisco rarely get home before 6:00 and
I doubt that many of them are big enough track bugs to come dashing out
to the meet without eating dinner. The few that do come will hardly make
up for the number of students who will be cut out by the ridiculous hour.
II the meet were started at 3:15 all students could view it, and it is my guess
that the number of Palo Allans attending who pay the full tariff would not
be greatly reduced.

Congratulations are due to Dutch Fehring who takes over from Everett
Dean as head baseball coach this June. Fehring will be stepping into the
shoes of a big man, but he has many of the s;»me attributes that make Dean
the wonderful coach and person that he is. As one player put it when he
heard of Fehring's appointment—"That's wonderful, he's right behind Dean
in things besides baseball." Fehring, like Dean, is the kind oi person whom
you can talk to about any problems you have, baseball or otherwise.

The big league races are beginning to shape up now, and already the teams
have settled themselves into their predicted spots. Only the Giants who
got off to a bad start, and the Cubs, who always start last seem to be badly
misplaced at the moment. As usual, the pitchers arc ahead oi the batters,
as witness the great number of shutouts, and Brooklyn who doesn't have
the strongest pitchers in the world is away and winging in the National
League. But the real success story is Jack Shepard.
Shepard plays for the Pittsburgh Pirates who finally won their first game
on Sunday. In eight games the muted Buccaneers have batted out 47 hits.
Shepard has seven of those although he has only played all the way in a
few of those games and has come to bat only 113 times. Shepard also started
the year off right with a stolen base, a feat which eluded him'last season.
But the burly backstop never was too speedy when playing in the stolen
base conscious CIBA.

Commuters who work in San Francisco rarely get home before 6:00 and
I doubt that many of them are big enough track bugs to come dashing out
to the meet without eating dinner. The few that do come will hardly make
up for the number of students who will be cut out by the ridiculous hour.
II the meet were started at 3:15 all students could view it, and it is my guess
that the number of Palo Allans attending who pay the full tariff would not
be greatly reduced.

Congratulations are due to Dutch Fehring who takes over from Everett
Dean as head baseball coach this June. Fehring will be stepping into the
shoes of a big man, but he has many of the s;»me attributes that make Dean
the wonderful coach and person that he is. As one player put it when he
heard of Fehring's appointment—"That's wonderful, he's right behind Dean
in things besides baseball." Fehring, like Dean, is the kind oi person whom
you can talk to about any problems you have, baseball or otherwise.

The big league races are beginning to shape up now, and already the teams
have settled themselves into their predicted spots. Only the Giants who
got off to a bad start, and the Cubs, who always start last seem to be badly
misplaced at the moment. As usual, the pitchers arc ahead oi the batters,
as witness the great number of shutouts, and Brooklyn who doesn't have
the strongest pitchers in the world is away and winging in the National
League. But the real success story is Jack Shepard.
Shepard plays for the Pittsburgh Pirates who finally won their first game
on Sunday. In eight games the muted Buccaneers have batted out 47 hits.
Shepard has seven of those although he has only played all the way in a
few of those games and has come to bat only 113 times. Shepard also started
the year off right with a stolen base, a feat which eluded him'last season.
But the burly backstop never was too speedy when playing in the stolen
base conscious CIBA.
Because A 1 Masters, Stanford's athletic director, hopes to gain a little
coin from the Stanford-USC trackmeet which was postponed for two weeks
yesterday, the meet is scheduled for 5:45. This is so that commuters can
come to the event.
Commuters pays $1.20 to see the meet; students, $0.50. This difference is
enough to cause the meet to be scheduled at dinner hour so that students
have their choice of missing dinner or missing the first half of the spikef'est.
