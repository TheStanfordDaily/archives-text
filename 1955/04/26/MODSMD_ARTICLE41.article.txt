# Bearcubs Bob Cleggmen, 17-5, In Slugfest
## 
### BOB MIEROW 
Paced by the powerful slug
ging of Paul Ortner and the
brilliant pitching of Mike Too
mey, the California frosh base
ball team outslugged Stanford's
Papooses, 17-5, last Saturday on
the Sunken Diamond.
Ortner picked out a first-inning
offering of Card hurler Ben Stevens
and sent it soaring over the right
field wall for a two-run homer. His
blow was only the third ball ever hit
over the fence in the stadium's his
tory.
BICi STICK
The slugging first-sacker from San
Francisco also drove in another run
in the sixth with a long triple.
Toomey, a husky right - hander
from Sacramento, didn't allow the
Papooses a single base hit until A 1
Spurgeon slapped a single to lead

off the sixth frame. Stanford man
aged only two bingles and no runs
in the six innings that Toomey
hurled.
By the time the Tribe frosh scored
in the seventh inning, Cal had run
up a 10-0 lead. Doug Camilli led
off the stretch-frame festivities with
a walk. Successive singles by Gordy
Medaris and Pete LaChapelle, an in
field out, and a single by Spurgeon
tallied three runs for the Papooses.
WAY BEHIND
Trailing 17-3 going into the bot
tom of the ninth, the Card rookies
rallied for two more markers on
three infield errors and a base on
balls.
