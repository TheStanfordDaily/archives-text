## Track Meet Postponed Again; Cards-USC To Duel May 10 
### 
April showers may bring May
flowers — but they also postpone
track meets. Such was the general
attitude of the Stanford track team
yesterday when they learned that
rain had forced a rescheduling of the
USC meet for the second time.
The rains, which are not too com
mon on the Farm during spring
quarter, started into their second
straight week yesterday afternoon,
causing the Trojan and Indian ath
letic directors to slate the meet for
late afternoon on May IC.
The competition was originally
scheduled to take 'place Saturday,
hut a wet track and the prospect of

rain resulted in the postponing until
this afteronon. And yesterday, the
rains came again.
Thus the two teams will make
their third attempt to fight it out
two weeks from today on May 10.
The meet will be scheduled to get
under way at 5:45 with the first race
beginning at 6.
The long postponement could
prove to be a break for coach Jack
Weiershauser's hoys. Several top
runners who are nursing pulled
muscles now should be in top con
dition by the time the Trojans ar
rive here.
The Indian thinclads travel to San
Jose Saturday for a meet with the
Spartans.
