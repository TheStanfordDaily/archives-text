# Deanmen Challenge Rain And S.F. State Today
## 
### 
Weather permitting, the Stanford baseballers will take on the
San Francisco State Gators this afternoon at 3:15 on the Sunken
Diamond. Coach Dean's squad, smarting from the two defeats
handed them by UCLA, will be seeking to get back on the winning
trail, having lost three in a row.
However, it appears likely that the rain that has already raised

havoc with the sports schedule will*"
force a cancellation or postpone- j
nient of the game.
Stanford is now virtually elimi- |
nated from the CIBA race which
has settled down to a buttle be- j
tween UCLA and USC. Three games !

remain between the two teams.
Stanford plays the Bruins once more
md meets the Trojans in a double
header two weeks from now.
Pitching for Stanford will be ei
ther Ed Verdurmen or Dick Jones,
.vhile the visitors, who Jed Stanford
5-5 in an earlier game, will probably
use Ed Smith.
The Cards take a weekend off
rom league encounters this Friday
and Saturday. They journey to San
Luis Obispo for two games with Cal
Poly.
