# Living Groups Hear Talks on Honor Code
## 
### 
Discussions of the Stanford Hon
or Code encompassing recent clari
fications made by the Honor Code
Committee were held in each living
group on campus last night in an ef
fort to further educate the Stanford
student for his duties under the
Code.
Explanations in each of the living
groups centered around the clarifi
cation passed by the ASSU Execu
tive Committee last quarter that ex
ams may be removed from the class
room only with the consent of the
instructor provided that alternate
seats are available.
Speakers from each of the resi
dences had been trained over a pe
riod of two weeks by the Honor
Code Committee under Ann Irvine
to lead the discussions and question
periods.
Stressing the point of individual
responsibility, the speakers advised
that it is the responsibility of each
student himself to find out what
constitutes an Honor Code violation
if he is in doubt.
In view of difficulties that have
recently arisen, it has been stated
that it is a violation of the Honor
Code to attempt to gain an unfair
advantage by missing a midterm
without a valid excuse.
Also the Honor Code Committee
has specified that where attendance
is used as a basis of grading, dis
honest verification of class attend
ance will comprise a Code violation.
In answer to questions that have
come up about turning names in for
Code violations, the students were
reminded that names and residences
of the suspected students may be
dropped in the Council for Student
Control box outside the ASSU of
fice.
In cases that come before the
Council for Student Control, neither
the name of the accused student nor
the witnesses involved will be di
vulged.
