### 
Professor Lawrence R. Blinks,
director of the University's Hop
kins Marine Station at Pacific
Grove, has been elected to the
National Academy of Sciences.
Dr. Blinks is a specialist in plant
physiology, and is considered a world
authority on a study of marine plants
which develops responses similar to
those of animal nerves.
His membership in the group of
scientists is one of thirty accorded
throughout the nation each year. Up
to this time twenty-eight members
of the Stanford faculty have received
this honor.
Total membership in the group is
limited to 400 as incorporated by an
act of Congress while Abraham Lin

Assistant Director of the National
Science Foundation which was
organized to coordinate all research
sponsored by United States govern
ment agencies.
Blinks is concerned with the study
of marine plants which produce red
pigment and flourish at great depth
in the ocean. He hopes his studies
may yield more exact of how these
plants convey sunlight and miner
als into the organic material of which
they are composed. This may in turn,
he hopes, shed more light on the
same process, called photosynthesis,
in green plants.
The professor has been at Stanford
since 1933, sex - ving as professor of
biology here. He received the Ph.D.
