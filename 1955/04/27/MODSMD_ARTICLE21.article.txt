# Symphony History Told by Musician
## 
### MARY ELLEN ROMNEY 
The ancient ancestors of the in
struments in the modern symphony
orchestra were the subjects of last
night's Tuesday Evening Series lec
ture, given by Dr. Otto Kinkeldey,
American musicologist. Dr. Kinkel
dey illustrated his lectures with a
large collection of slides.
Although the modern symphony
has as many as 120 musicians play
ing a variety of instruments, the
three vital groups remain the same
as in ancient times, said Dr. Kinkel
dey. The stringed intsruments,
which are bowed or plucked; the
winds, which are blown; and the
percussions, which are beaten or
struck, can be traced back to the
early Egyptian civilization.
Dr. Kinkeldey concentrated on the
time from 1000 A.D. to the 15th cen
tury in his lecture. "The music of
this time is quite new to scholars,"
he said. "Almost all our records are
old manuscripts, combining words
with musical notation."
"It was long believed that only
vocal music existed in this era," he
continued. "However, old paintings
and sculptures have recently proved
the existence of musical instru
ments."
Stringed instruments were most
popular among the Egyptians, as Dr.
Kinkeldey illustrated with a slide
taken of a painting in the tomb of
an ancient Pharaoh. Harps of vari
ous shapes, lutes similar to our mod
ern mandolin, and lyres were in use
even then.
The use of bows was introduced to
Europe in the 12th century by Ara
bians, and is depicted in English ca
thedral sculpture as early as 1340.
These ancestors of the violin were
called "vielles," and were oval
shaped.
Reference is made in the Bible to
"cornets, utes, and secputs," all of
which were instruments in common
use in medieval England. The cor
nets were wooden pipes with finger
holes and metal mouthpieces. Sec
puts were the forerunners of the
modern trombone.
Bagpipes, drums, double pipes,
psalteries, dulcimers, and bells were
also in common use. Dr. Kinkeldey
said. A tiny predecessor of the or
gan was shown, where the musician
played with one hand and pumped
a bellows with the other.

night's Tuesday Evening Series lec
ture, given by Dr. Otto Kinkeldey,
American musicologist. Dr. Kinkel
dey illustrated his lectures with a
large collection of slides.
Although the modern symphony
has as many as 120 musicians play
ing a variety of instruments, the
three vital groups remain the same
as in ancient times, said Dr. Kinkel
dey. The stringed intsruments,
which are bowed or plucked; the
winds, which are blown; and the
percussions, which are beaten or
struck, can be traced back to the
early Egyptian civilization.
Dr. Kinkeldey concentrated on the
time from 1000 A.D. to the 15th cen
tury in his lecture. "The music of
this time is quite new to scholars,"
he said. "Almost all our records are
old manuscripts, combining words
with musical notation."
"It was long believed that only
vocal music existed in this era," he
continued. "However, old paintings
and sculptures have recently proved
the existence of musical instru
ments."
Stringed instruments were most
popular among the Egyptians, as Dr.
Kinkeldey illustrated with a slide
taken of a painting in the tomb of
an ancient Pharaoh. Harps of vari
ous shapes, lutes similar to our mod
ern mandolin, and lyres were in use
even then.
The use of bows was introduced to
Europe in the 12th century by Ara
bians, and is depicted in English ca
thedral sculpture as early as 1340.
These ancestors of the violin were
called "vielles," and were oval
shaped.
Reference is made in the Bible to
"cornets, utes, and secputs," all of
which were instruments in common
use in medieval England. The cor
nets were wooden pipes with finger
holes and metal mouthpieces. Sec
puts were the forerunners of the
modern trombone.
Bagpipes, drums, double pipes,
psalteries, dulcimers, and bells were
also in common use. Dr. Kinkeldey
said. A tiny predecessor of the or
gan was shown, where the musician
played with one hand and pumped
a bellows with the other.
