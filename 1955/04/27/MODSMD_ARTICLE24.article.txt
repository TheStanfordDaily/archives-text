# Rain May Help Lake Lag's Level
## 
### 
Lake Lagunita might make it till
the end of the quarter yet—if the
rains continue.
University Superintendent of
Buildings and Grounds Carroll L.
Blacker said yesterday that if it
should rain a few more days this
week there may be enough water
flow to raise Lagunita's rapidly de
clining level.
The rains of late haven't affected
the lake at all. according to Blacker,
who said that the water has merely
been absorbed by the ground, with
no overflow into Lagunita.
Of course, if the rains come down
hard enough the matter of the lake's
supposedly weakened dam will again
present itself. If Lagunita's. level
does get "dangerously" high it can
be drained.
The drainage would be done to
comply with California state require
ments calling for impi-ovement in
the existing Lagunita dam which
they say has become weakened over
the years.
University officials have written
the state asking for negotiation on
the requirements but still no date
for a meeting has been set.
