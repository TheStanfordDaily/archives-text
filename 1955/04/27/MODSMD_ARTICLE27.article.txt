## crosswalks 
### 
To the Editor:
Something really must he done about these un
sightly crosswalks which clutter up the streets on
campus. They obviously serve no useful purpose
and may do considerable harm. One of these days,
some simple minded soul who isn't familiar with
the customs and traditions of this great institution
is going to take a cross walk seriously. He'll honestly
rt'ly on one of them and expect that car bearing

rlgwn on him at 40 m.p.h. to stop for him. Granted,
only a completely unsophisticated type could be in
jured in this manner, hut the possibility is there
and could lead 1o nasty complications.
Seriously, the unkindest cut of all, the ultimate
in .twisting the knife, is to jump aside trom an on
rushing vehicle, wishing there were only a cop
there to give the idiot a ticket, and then find that
your" tormentor is a policeman! It seems as if at least
the minions ot the law could refrain from declaring
open season on ignorant pedestrians.
