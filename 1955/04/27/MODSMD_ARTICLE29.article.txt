### BARRY ANDERSON 
(This Con Home Week marks
the first annivers:ar\ of Sam Mr-
Donald's retirement its Superin
tendent of Athletic Buildings and
Grounds, a job which he had held
since 1J)07. Sam lias always heen
closely identified with the Con
Home, as friend to (he children
and chef at the annual all-campus
barbecue.—Ed.)

Out from !he front of Sam Mc
-1 Donald's second - story living
room has been built a smaller
I room overlooking Angell Field,
an afterthought, though it now j
seems a part of the original
house. Here Sam often sits v/ith
a few of his many University
friends.
Sam was looking at the empty
track. He sat in a chair with his
long-boned frame relaxed.
"Well, I thought you might like to
j know how it feels to be retired.
RETIREMENT
j "I thought I was going to have a
j lot of time to do the things I wanted
j when I retired, but I find my time
more taken up now than before. I
find I've made a lot of promises of
things I'd do for people when I re
| tired. I like to help out all 1 can, but
! it doesn't leave me much time for
; other things. 1 haven't been able to
I get over to eat with the children at
i the Convalescent Home for two
' weeks now, and that's .scandalous.
"One of the things that's been
; keeping me busy is a project 1 have
[ in La Honda now. I've got quite a
i number of acres up there- it's a
J game and wildlife refuge. I'm work
ing on the plan of getting Stanford
supporters to form a little commu
nity there. It wouldn't I jo restricted
I to Stanford people.
! RESERVATION'
"I'm going to call it 'The Stanford
j Indians' Reservation' and use dif
j ferent Indian name, for the sections,
j I got that idea from Pop Warner. 1
j had a visit with him just before he
j passed on. Back when the Stanford
J teams didn't have any name, Pop gol
! the idea to call them the Indians,
i That gave,,..me an inspiration for

naming that acreage up there.
"That's taking most of my time
right now, along with going to din
ners and making speeches and writ
ing things. I'm not making so many
speeches any more. They take too
much time. But I'm always willin'
and glad to write a few words when
anyone asks me to.
CORRESPONDENCE
"Correspondence in regard to
"Sam McDonald's Farm" kind of re
activated my whole life. All my
friends sent me congratulations. I'm
trying to answer and I'm just
swamped.
"You've got to have inspiration to
write, I've round out." He gestured
with his long arm at the word in
. piration. "Sometimes after hearing
a sermon or a speech, you feel you
liaVe something to write about, but
you have to write right then and
there. You forget anything if you

, wait three or four days.
"I've seen many of the men retire,
and it makes you sad to see the way
some of them take retirement. I'm
thankful the Lord has permitted me
to live this long. I've come back to
do more work. I never felt better in
jmy life. I'm renewed.
COMPENSATION
"I'm not working for compensa
! lion. Some people would continue to
j work until they're 120 years old just
;to make some more money. Thai
| won't make them happy. They
I should be contributing to someone
I coming up the line. Whenever you
find pleasure in whatever you're do
ing, that's happiness — that comes
I down from Dr. Jordan.
"If someone asked me if I'd like to
|be 30 years younger, I'd say no. I
| couldn't lead a happier life. It seems
I've been blessed here continually,
I right from the beginning."
