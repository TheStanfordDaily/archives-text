# Cards Meet S.F. State If Diamond Dries On!
## 
### 
Wet grounds forced the postponement of yesterday's baseball
game between San Francisco State and Stanford. The game will
be played today instead at 3:15 on the Sunken Diamond. Pitching
for the Cards will be Ed Verdurmen, Dick Jones, Ray Highsmith,
or Gil Duncan.
The diamond was still too soggy to permit playing yesterday

although no rain !'?11 and it was
â–  unny for most of the day. The dia
mond dries fast in the wind, but the
game was postponed when the fore
cast predicted more rain,
Stanford, sporting a season record
ol l!i wins, 11 losses, and one tie,
has a chance to avenge that tie this
afternoon. The Gators escaped with
a 5-5 deadlock in a winter quarter

dead week game when Rich Scra
maglia was called out at the plate irf
the ninth inning on a highly de
bated play. He tried to score from
second on an infield grounder and
was apparently home safely, but the
umpire ruled differently and imme
diately called the game on aceount
of darkness.
The Cards are away this weekend
with two games in San Luis Obispo
against the Cal Poly Mustangs. The
team leaves Friday morning at 8.
