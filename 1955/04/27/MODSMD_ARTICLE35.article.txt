# Moore Leads Frosh Over Carlton HS
## 
### 
Hampered by the cold weather,
Torn Haynie's fre. hman swimming
J team floated to a 42-28 victory over
Carlton High School in a meet no
table mainly for the slow times.
None of the frosh extended them
} selves too much in the chilly water.

—
The Ire-hman swimming team
takes to the water again tonight at
7 as the Treasure Island team in
i vades the Pool. The Treas
i lire Islanders are heavily favored
i in the meet as frosh Ivohin Moore
may have some real competition
J for perhaps the first time this sea
son.

j Carlton picked up quite a few points
! simply as a result of Haynie's not
{ using his top men.
Indian Tom Decker turned in one
j of the few fast times recorded in the
j meet with his 25.1 mark in the 50-
; yard freestyle. It was Decker's third
j straight win in that event.
The phenomenal Robin Moore
j took his usual pair of firsts—in the
1 100- and 200-yard freestyle. In both,
| however, Moore only swam fast
enough to assure himself of victory.
His times were 52.5 in the .100 and
2:10.2 in the 200. Moore also won
the medley 150 with a time of 1:44.6.
Bob Mclntyre won the diving
I event.
