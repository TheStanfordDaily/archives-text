UP AND OVER- Indian high jumper Phil Fehlen has been one
of the pleasantest surprises of the current season. A sophomore
who has been steadily improving all season, Fehlen made his
best effort when he cleared 6 ft.-G inches a couple of weeks back.
He will be counted on for several points against tough San Jose
State this Saturday.
