Positions are available lor qualified mechanical design engineers at the Uni
versity oi California Radiation Laboratory. We have over 100 mechanical en
gineers engaged in the design of a wide range oi equipment lor use in funda
mental and applied scientific investigation.
This work includes nuclear and thermonuclear test devices and instrumentation,
high energy particle accelerators, ultra high speed cameras, large scale high
vacuum equipment, devices for remote control in high radiation fields,' equip
ment for remote handling and processing of radioactive materials, and accessory
equipment for nuclear reactors.
scientists and the extensive laboratory shops. Emphasis is not on designing for
scientists and the extensive laboratory shops. Emphasis is not on designing for
production manufacture. The work calls for an understanding of principles and
ingenuity rather than the application of standard practices. The projects of
the laboratory include practically all aspects of nuclear engineering.
COMPUTERS: Recent graduates needed for three months' training in operation
of digital computing machines.' Assignment as computer mathematician follow
ing satisfactory completion of training. A.B. or U.S. degree in Mathematics
required.
JUNIOR PHYSICISTS: Graduates in psysics at B.S. or M.S. level. Openings
in semi-theoretical and in experimental work. Should plan to work full time
