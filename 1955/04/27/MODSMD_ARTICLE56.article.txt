# New Playclothes Show Stripes, Italian Trend
## 
### SALLY TRAPNELL 
Now that Spring is here and the sun has decided to shine on Stan
lord (Mice more, thoughts turn to the out-01-doors and particularly
the beach. To follow this trend, more and more playclothes are ap
pearing in shops, tins year stressing clashing colors and especially the
Italian influence.
ProbaMy the newest thini; lor lounging this year is the Italian

T-shirt. Made with long or three-'
quarter length sleeves, these jerseys
usually have straighl-across or V
necks and are horizontally striped
in all a lots (.1 the rainbow. Par
ticularly Mattering to tall or dark
haired girls, these shirts look good
:,vcr bathing suits or to top ofl a
pair of shorts or pedal pushers.
BERMUDAS
Something new has also been,
added in the way ol shorts this
year. Besides the usual short
horts and the Bermuda, which i,s
being made in summer fabrics,
there is n< w a third style in an in
termediate length called the Ja
maican. Linen and denim arc
popular materials, and bright
shades often predominate in a
number ol dilTerent stripe com
binations.
For those who prefer pedal
pushers, toreador pants are still the
main lashion. Styles seem to be
getting more casual, however, with
none el the velvet and jewelled
pants that were seen last year. Pat
terns tend to either strips or harle
quin prints, many in nicely clash
ing shades ol red, purple, and
orange.
Bathing suits have also turned
plainer this year, although ruffles

combined wiih a lastex suit have
become quite popular. There are
lewcr billowing bloomer and
hourglass styles, the emphasis
being on a practical swim suit.
Crisp cotton suits often blossom
into .sjda.hy flower prints in keep
ing with the rest ol the season's
bright colors.
The new long waistline lias even
entered the playclothes field. Foi
covering up to and Iroin the beach
are two-toned middy blouses of
sturdy sailcloth. Also following
diis trend are cotton overblouses.
afren in bright purple or green,
equally good over bathing suits or
to match and mix with pedal
pushers and shorts.
