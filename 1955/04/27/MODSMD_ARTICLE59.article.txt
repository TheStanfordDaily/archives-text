# Quad Clothes Feature Color, Floral Prints
## 
### ELLEN MANN 
Away with the hum-drum—spring is coming in. And with it comes
a riot of colors—clear, cool, and striking. Poplin comes in print;
cotton in ice blue or cotton candy pink, lemon linen and frosted
organdy in dazzling spanking white. People are talking about it.
Express yourself in print: fancy, fun floral prints, for instance.

The gargantuan print is populart
this spring; in iacj, many cottons
look as though someone had
spilled a paint pot on them. Here
comes the tiny, tiny checked ging
ham, the stitched and pleated
neatness of a shirtwaist dress, me
ticulously slimmed separates.
Wear polka-dots and stri|>es, try
a narrow linen in palest green with
a contrasting cardigan; dress up a
white pique with a pink satin belt.
The easy middy-look is hack again.
Pleats are everywhere, and the
waist-line is long.
The sweater scheme is fine this
season: a dress and a cardigan—a
cashmere bolero, silk-lined and
banded with grograin, the cardi
gan over silk pongee, a black linen
under a white sweater lined with
white, polka-dotted silk, a beige
sweater bound with satin, the red
cardigan over everything — cock
tail sheath, Bermuda shorts, or
dinner dress.
Coats arc straight from the
shoulder and beautifully tailored
in red tweed, grey wool, soft beige
cashmere, stark black faille, flar
ing coats of velvet with stand
away collars. The sleeves are set
in, often elbow length; double
breasted, turn-over collar coats
belted low in back; reversible
coats; some are slashed at the!
sides so the fullness of the skirt !
length may puff out here.
Fashions have special ideas this
season. And it's something to talk
I
about.

'Phis dress, a typical Lanz print of little cross-hatched hearts and
flowers, shows the long-waisted loo{ so popular this season. Darl(-

The easy middy-look is hack again.
Pleats are everywhere, and the
waist-line is long.
The sweater scheme is fine this
season: a dress and a cardigan—a
cashmere bolero, silk-lined and
banded with grograin, the cardi
gan over silk pongee, a black linen
under a white sweater lined with
white, polka-dotted silk, a beige
sweater bound with satin, the red
cardigan over everything — cock
tail sheath, Bermuda shorts, or
dinner dress.
Coats arc straight from the
shoulder and beautifully tailored
in red tweed, grey wool, soft beige
cashmere, stark black faille, flar
ing coats of velvet with stand
away collars. The sleeves are set
in, often elbow length; double
breasted, turn-over collar coats
belted low in back; reversible
coats; some are slashed at the!
sides so the fullness of the skirt !
length may puff out here.
Fashions have special ideas this
season. And it's something to talk
I
about.

'Phis dress, a typical Lanz print of little cross-hatched hearts and
flowers, shows the long-waisted loo{ so popular this season. Darl(-

READY FOR SUMMER PIC
NICS is MARILYN POPPING,
Bran.ner, in a splashy Hawaiian
print from LEI ALOHA.
Away with the hum-drum—spring is coming in. And with it comes
a riot of colors—clear, cool, and striking. Poplin comes in print;
cotton in ice blue or cotton candy pink, lemon linen and frosted
organdy in dazzling spanking white. People are talking about it.
Express yourself in print: fancy, fun floral prints, for instance.

The gargantuan print is populart
this spring; in iacj, many cottons
look as though someone had
spilled a paint pot on them. Here
comes the tiny, tiny checked ging
ham, the stitched and pleated
neatness of a shirtwaist dress, me
ticulously slimmed separates.
Wear polka-dots and stri|>es, try
a narrow linen in palest green with
a contrasting cardigan; dress up a
white pique with a pink satin belt.
