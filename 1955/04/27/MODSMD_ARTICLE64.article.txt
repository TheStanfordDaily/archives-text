# Ivy League Tradition Continues Its Influence on Stan ford Fashions
## 
### DICK MEISTER 
While the Stanford student will ntver he as traditional in his cloth
ing tastes as his Eastern college counterpart, t• ie Ivy League influence
■ looks as if it will continue to lit lelt this spring as it has in the past.
The neater, more conservative look <>l the so-called Ivy leaguers is
j appealing to nlore and more men on the Farm and the news in

spring stylings is more and more*
color to provide sharp contrast to
the darker tones ol i his now almost
universally accepted college w< ar.
Pastel shirts, already a necessary
xirt of the Stanlord "man ol <!is
tinction's" wardr(;he, will he even
livelier this spring. New shades of
rreen, yellow, and liehotn pe will
ie added to the pink and blue
uied ones which have been sported
)[ late. Checked and striped hut
on-down collared shirts in these
■hades are gaining in popularity.
(dollar styles are still .is varied as
he imagination < I their designers
nit at Stanford the traditional hut
on-down, harmonizing with the
jther Ivy league furnishings, is
.till the top choice.
<EVERSAL
This spring will feature a re
versal ol the old adage that light
jolors are correct lor warm weath
er, at least in suit wear. Even the
wool tropical suits will be in the
charcoal tones, in .ill colors. 1 he
eading fabric here is the wool and
lacron combination which high
ights the new prominence ol the
'miracle" materials in clothing.
Many of the patterns in these
tew suits are distinctly new, with
leek and light striped patterns pre
lominating.
To further enliven the dark
background o! the charcoal shades
lew lighter toned ties have been
lesigned. Most are in the tradi
ional regimental stripes, but have
muted pastel tones in lighter ma
erials, such as shantung with its
haracteristic nubby effect. I'he
lark tie with its bright contrast
ng stripes or patterns is also a top
pring seller and all are in the nar
•ower, neater shapes.
,ots of color
Color and plenty of it will be
ecn in spring sport shirts. 1 he
rend in design is away from the
raditional standard collared, but
on-fronted shirts ol the past. Ital
an and French designers have al
nost completely "revolutionized"
he casual shirt held with their
inic]tie stylings.
Here, too, leading colors are the
)astels in patterns ol checks, plaids,
tripes, and you name it. Shirts in
irlon and the other "miracle" or
'man-made" fabrics make more
ise ol this trend in materials.
In trousers the East has really
ihown its influence. The narrow
belted slacks in every material

from khaki and denim to flannel
are selling like the proverbial hot
i cakes. Charred tones are,of course,
il.c me i|H pular, but tlie ever re
liable fa led blue still has its sup
porters, as many as lor the < titer
shades in lact.
BRICI IT BELTS
IVrhap:, tire most colorful items
in the spring wardrobe are the
bright ribbon and elastic belts seen
around the waists o! many Stan
lord males. These come in a great
variety ol lutes and in patterns of
stripes, plaids, and what lutve-you.
Some in solid tones are catching
the eves of those who wish a more
conservative contrast to their dark
shaded trousers.
Footwear si vies provide a real
opportunity lor relaxation and cas
ual ness. The "low-top" shoes in
charcoal colorings are a great lav
orite and a definite move away
Irom the traditional "brogucish"
shoe look of lifte past. Shoes are
neater, lighter, and most import
ant ol all—more comfortable than
ihe\ have been lor many years.
STRETCI iy socks
One of the newest and most
popular items in men's hose is the
arctch sock, which "breathes" with
its wearer. The trend in material
is away Irom the heavy wool to the
new materials like dacron, nylon,
and orlon and innumerable blends.
Men are beginning to prefer a lux
ury feeling in their socks without
the expense of cashmere. And
lamb's wool and the other fabrics
answer this preference adding a
practical note of real wearability.
In formal wear the traditional
blacks and blues are still the lead
ers but those who are serious
"party-timers" will hnd new trends
in ihe formal department. Light
weight tropical labrics in shan
tung in the new pastel shades are
appearing. Here, as in the other
fields of men's sittings, double
breasted coats are almost non
existent.
Trends or no, the Stanford m; ile
prefers his year to year, casual and
comfortable attire. Colorful pat
terned shirts combined with den
! Ims or the standard khakis, per
haps brightened by a colorful
striped belt, and with the comfort
ableness of the loafer shoe backed
by a bright boxer-type pair of
swimming trunks for L;J<e Lag
time, will continue to be the mark
of spring in men's wear.


CAY STRIPES AND CHARCOAL are the combination KI\N
KILEY, Village, is wearing for summer-sunshine wear. The out
lit. from ROOS BROS., follows the new trend of darl{ colors for
men's spring clothing. Ihe shirt is made of Egyptian lisle, a new
cotton fabric which is lighter than air.


THE CHARACTER IS HARRY SKINNER—the sport shirt is
the CREWCUT, a washable, short sleeve Gaucho number
Ithat really has the gals looking twice. It sells for $5.95 at
IERRY'S STORE FOR MEN in Menlo Park.
P.S. The hat is a Campus Tyrol at $1.95.
