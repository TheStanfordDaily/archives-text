Madison Avenue, in New York,
is a street of pressure, politics,
j permanent youth and peptic
Ulcers. The advertising center ol
the United States. Think alumi
the permanent voiuh concept.
A lew years ago a minor sort
ol revolution took place on Madi
son Avenue. Middle aged account
executives, disturbed by the youth
; !nl appearance of young junior
account executives —and the effect
ol that youthful appearance on
clients —hurried down the street
to number the home ol
Brooks Bros., and let them know
that they wanted to look youth
ful.
And thus was born the Madi
son Avenue Look which has since
degenerated into the so-called Ivy
League Look.
Only a split second behind was
the MAL's invasion ol the eastern
campus. A few additions and the
Ivy League Look was born. The
chief addition that made the MAL
the ILL was the White Buck
Shoe that had been allowed to (let
Dirty. The Airtmouthian or
alie was ready lor the wars,
luted out in sincere jacket, sincere
tie, sincere collar, sincere trousers,
sincere argvles, and probably sin
tere shorts.
But since so many middle aged
account executives had adopted
the Madison Avenue Look be
cause it was youthful, the balance
[of effect was shifted and now, the
young man in the Ivv League
Look seems to be trying v look
i middle aged.
