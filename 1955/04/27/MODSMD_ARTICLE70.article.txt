Fcr two solid years, it's been growing and growing
and growing; getting heavier and hotter all the time.
It takes two weeks to dry after it's washed, and five
minutes for my brush to get from the top or my head to
the end of my hair. When the wind blows I can't see
a thing, and i gain 2 pounds every time it rains. Furth
ermore, it completely ruins the effect of backless
dresses.
After three sleepless nights of indecision I decided it
was time for a change. Who would be the mastermind
to direct this world-shaking event? He couldn t have
any element or mediocrity. He had to be outstanding,
plus; and the two-foot, first prize, gold trophy for
hair cutting in Maurice William's window was enough
for me. i rurned and took several bold steps into the
beauty salon, plopped myself down in front of the near
est mirror, and trembling, said, Cut it!" So here goes.

It's cool, easy to care for, and boy does it feel wonder
ful. I sure hope my friends will like it, because I
really do! Mr. Williams really did a great job. and as
far as I m concerned, he is the perfect stylist for college
girls. His years of specialization in hair styling has
really paid off for me. and I'm going to recommend
him to all my friends.
P. S Did it ever cause a sensation in the dorm—and
' he*liked it too!

It's, all gone now. and I should have had Ih. i mop cut
off long ago. Bui. oh gosh, what will he thin!' he
didn't know I was going to get it cut—nobody r! 1 !
wonder if my friends will know me.
