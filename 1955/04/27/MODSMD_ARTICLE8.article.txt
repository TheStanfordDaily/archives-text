### 
TAIPEI Nationalist Premier I. K.
Yui today assured the Legislative
Yuan (parliament) that the United
States has not urged Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek to surrender the
Quemoy and Matsu Islands as part
of a deal to win a cease-fire from
Red China.
But there wore indications that
there was more tension than has
been admitted publicly in the secret
negotiations between Chiang and
Admiral Arthur W. Radford, U.S.
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
