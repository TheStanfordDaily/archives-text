NEWSPAPER WORK AS A CAREER
(
The 2nd of 3 advertisements.
Doubtless you have heard talk of an outstanding Washington corre
spondent or of an outstanding foreign correspondent.
The chances are you have heard very little talk of an outstanding local
reporter.
Yet an outstanding local reporter is one of our most valuable citizens.
Through hard labor, he has acquired a thorough knowledge of many
important things in his community, and he has built up a reputation
for absolute integrity.
His acquaintances are wide-spread.
*
He may know, and probably does know, an able detective sergeant, n
couple of prominent business men, a flamboyant ward boss, a shy but
brilliant professor of physics, a railroad executive, a wise and well-loved
minister, an old-time civil servant in the city hall who can remember * ,
everything that happened there during the past forty years, a leading
banker, a judge and a notable doctor.
l
He has acquired their trust and their respect and hence they will talk
freely with him.
He is gifted with "a sense of smell" as to what is phony and dubious.
Perhaps he never could be an outstanding Washington or foreign cor
respondent.
Perhaps he much prefers his own line of work. —*
Competent performance of a local reporter's job is not easy, but it
may be attended by great satisfaction and a world of romance.
If you are primarily interested in security and starting with big pay
' (and such interests are common and very natural), newspaper work as
a career does not hold much of an appeal.
If you like to work hard, to be something of an artist, to laugh and
dream a little, and never to know what is going to happen next, then
newspaper work as a career probably offers more than anything else.
