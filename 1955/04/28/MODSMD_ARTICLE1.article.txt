# Preliminary Plans for Moore Hall Approved
## Mock-up Room Will Be Built 
### MARG DALGLIESH 
The idea of the Florence
Moore Hall is rapidly becoming
a reality.
Preliminary plans for the
dorm were passed by the Board
df Trustees in their April 21
meeting.
Mrs. Robert S. Moore, donor of
funds for the hail, was shown the
plans earlier this week and ex
pressed her pleasure at the progress
which had been made thus far.
These preliminary plans have been
drawn up in the past three weeks by
Milton T. Pflueger, San Francisco

architect. Ideas were presented to
him by the eight undergraduate
women on the planning committee
and the administration.
The seven residence units, each
housing 50 undergraduate women,
will be ranged on a sloping field be
low the Knoll with the new pe
ripheral road running in front of
the hall.
Working plans for the hall were
made possible by a million-dollar
gift from Mrs. Moore, who lives in
Atherton. Target dates are Sept. 15,
1955, for the final plans; contracts to
be awarded Oct. 15, 1955; and the
hall completed by Sept. 15, 1956, so
as to be ready for occupany that fall.
This new hall will not cause the
administration to change the admis
sions policy. The new dorm will
merely enable the University to re
sume its policy of admitting about
<100 women to the freshman class
beginning with the class of 1960.
Due to the present overcrowded

conditions in women's housing the
administration was forced to lower
the number of freshman women to
be admitted to 300 for the class of
1959.
The hall is primarily to improve
present overcrowding for the under
graduate women. It. will alsq enable
the University to remove some of
the older buildings presently being
used for women's housing.
A double room "mock-up" is be
ing planned in order to experiment
with the actual room arrangement
with various types and designs of
furniture and alternate plans. The
"mock-up" is a full-sized room, and
may be built this quarter, according
to Kenneth Cuthbertson, Assistant,
to the President.
Although the buildings are cen
trally connected, each will maintain
its own entrance and patio. Each
unit will also have its own lounge
and dining room and will be served
by central kitchen and administra
tive facilities.
Some of the interior features will
include a sun deck for each resi
dence, a second-floor lounge-study
combination, a social room with re
frigerator and stove, and a separate
formal closet with adjacent pressing
room.

Preliminary plans for the
dorm were passed by the Board
df Trustees in their April 21
meeting.
Mrs. Robert S. Moore, donor of
funds for the hail, was shown the
plans earlier this week and ex
pressed her pleasure at the progress
which had been made thus far.
These preliminary plans have been
drawn up in the past three weeks by
Milton T. Pflueger, San Francisco

architect. Ideas were presented to
him by the eight undergraduate
women on the planning committee
and the administration.
The seven residence units, each
housing 50 undergraduate women,
will be ranged on a sloping field be
low the Knoll with the new pe
ripheral road running in front of
the hall.
Working plans for the hall were
made possible by a million-dollar
gift from Mrs. Moore, who lives in
Atherton. Target dates are Sept. 15,
1955, for the final plans; contracts to
be awarded Oct. 15, 1955; and the
hall completed by Sept. 15, 1956, so
as to be ready for occupany that fall.
This new hall will not cause the
administration to change the admis
sions policy. The new dorm will
merely enable the University to re
sume its policy of admitting about
<100 women to the freshman class
beginning with the class of 1960.
Due to the present overcrowded

conditions in women's housing the
administration was forced to lower
the number of freshman women to
be admitted to 300 for the class of
1959.
The hall is primarily to improve
present overcrowding for the under
graduate women. It. will alsq enable
the University to remove some of
the older buildings presently being
used for women's housing.
A double room "mock-up" is be
ing planned in order to experiment
with the actual room arrangement
with various types and designs of
furniture and alternate plans. The
"mock-up" is a full-sized room, and
may be built this quarter, according
to Kenneth Cuthbertson, Assistant,
to the President.
Although the buildings are cen
trally connected, each will maintain
its own entrance and patio. Each
unit will also have its own lounge
and dining room and will be served
by central kitchen and administra
tive facilities.
Some of the interior features will
include a sun deck for each resi
dence, a second-floor lounge-study
combination, a social room with re
frigerator and stove, and a separate
formal closet with adjacent pressing
room.
