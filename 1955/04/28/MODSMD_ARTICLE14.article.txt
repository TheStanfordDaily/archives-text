fice headed for the Stanford
Convalescent Home and the Uih

This year's event continues nn an -

trim lawns, and do a general face
lifting an the Convalescent Home.
The patients at Con Home arc four

have coine there after the initial
stages of such illnesses as rheumatic
fever have passed. They no I .
need the close medical attention of
a hospital but still must have plenty
of rest and good nourishment. Chil

The Con Home is completely sup -

contributing. Stanford is the only
university which helps support ;i
charity of this kind.
Prizes will be given by the Con
Home Committee for the best group
of workers at the Day.
Following the awards will be the
traditional Barbecue (5:30-6:45 p.m.).
Event chairmen say that 2500 pounds
of beef will be served at the Sum
McDonald Barbecue. Food will be
free to all students who regularly
eat in University dining halls, eal •
ing clubs, and fraternities and who
obtain a barbecue ticket at then
groups. No dinners will be servcl
tonight in student residences. Oil
campus students may obtain tickets
in the ASSU office, the Nitery, for
$1.
Entertainment at the Barbecue is
to be provided by the "Hi-Lo'.s '
vocal quartet now being featured in
a San Francisco club. Other grout -
entertaining will be Stanford stu
dents and Con Home children.
"The Barbecue is the prime pui -
pose of the Con Home Drive, since
students get to know the Home rind

Home Committee chairmen.
The route to the Con Home
recommended by chairmen is "A
left turn off Palm Drive by the stop.
light that isn't working." (See map,
