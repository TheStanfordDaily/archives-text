### DAVE SCOTT 
"Let's go back to the Constitution of the United States," declared
Senator Malone last night to members of the Political Union at
Cubberley.
He then demonstrated how the United States could carry out
this needed goal by limiting the presidents' trade and treaty-

making power, doing away with re
ciprocal trade, and stopping the
"pouring of billions into Europe."
He was sharply critical of recipro
cal trade, declaring that forcing two
manufacturing areas to trade was
like "two barbers making money
shaving each other."
Malone declared that tariffs were
necessary to protect our domestic
goods against competition from
cheap foreign goods, made by cheap
labor.
He blasted our recent tendency to
instigate pacts whenever two na
tions happened to get together, de
claring that this was an obvious vio
lation of Washington's "no perma
nent alliance" tradition. "We should
stop pouring billions into Europe
and dividing what we have and
forcing our living standards down
to bring others up."
Instead, the Senator declared, we
should spend our money at home on
fortifications or on Western Hemi
sphere trade. He said that we need
to build up badly needed airplanes
as "the next war will have no foot
soldiers."
"Strongly backed by this air pow
er, we should stand on our own two
feet, and draw a line, and tell our

enemy not to cross it.
"In the past few years we have
amended the Constitution, through
granting the President the trade and
treaty making not granted in the
Constitution. That is why I voted for
the Brick e r amendment which
would make any agreements pos
sible only with passage of regular
law in Congress."
