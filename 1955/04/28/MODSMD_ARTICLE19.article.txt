# just a white line ........ an editorial
## 
### 
The University painted a white line down
the middle of Galvez Street near the Stadium
yesterday.
ASSU's Hazards Committee wanted them io
do it a year ago. Two serious accidents in \he
past six weeks, one Tuesday night, finally
prompted the University to action. It took a
student plea and two head-on collisions io do
it, and now we have our white line on Galvez.
So what have we got? Just a white line.
A white line won't keep a speeder from
swinging to the wrong side of that curve, and
it won't keep the sloppy driver from wandering
all over the road. A better solution would be to
rebuild the road to cut out the curve. The best

solution would be to take a few of the speeders
and the careless drivers off the road. You can't
take that curve at any speed over 45 and hope
to hold your lane . . . but it's easy to keep your
car in control if you obey the speed limit.
The University must occasionally take steps
■to protect the majority 'of the student body
from its few reckless members. The painting
of white lines on campus streets is long over
due. But a rerouting of the Galvez curve would
be an expensive project, and the University,
with its financial position and future plans in
mind, doey not want Co undertake it.
There are strict limits to what the University
can do to protect the citizens of the campus
community from themselves.


AFTER TWO ACCIDENTS. A WHITE LINE . . . WILL IT PREVENT A THIRD?
