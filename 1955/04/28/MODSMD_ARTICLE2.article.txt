### 
Compiled from Dispatches of (he United Press

WASHINGTON, April 27 The
government today banned the use of
;iil Salk polio vaccine produced by
the Cutter Laboratories of Berkeley
after six children inoculated with
the scrum were stricken with para
lytic polio.
The ban was ordered by the U.S.
Public Health Service, which cm
phasized its "complete faith" in the
Salk serum. It said that the chil
dren may have already contracted
the disease, or that one shot was not
sufficient protection.
But the Health Service insisted
that all Cutter vaccine—the brand
used in the National Foundation for
Infantile Paralysis' inoculation pro
grams in five Western states —should
be withdrawn pending adequate
study of the stricken children.
