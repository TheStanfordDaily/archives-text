## no excuse ... 
### 
To the Editor:
During the last week of winter quarter, a very
serious collision occurred at almost the same spot
as the one reported in Wednesday's Daily. What
ever the cause of that head-on accident, the Uni
versity probably was not without some blame.
Obviously feeling that such was the case, the Uni
versity had seme surfacing added to increase the
width of the roadway where it curved the most; also
a rather weak light was attached to a telephone
pole lome distance away.
There is no excuse (least of all a financial one)
for the present condition of Galvez Street on the
approach to the school, as well as the shape that
Palm Drive is in. At the very minimum a new and
distinct whit* line should divide these roads. If
oncoming headlights flashed in Miss Jorat's eyes,
it is easy to see why she crossed onto the wrong
side of the road.

Evidently (lie University agrees with you in one
|H)int (see above). The police record shows that
the two recent collisions were entirely different in
nature, and each was caused by the negligence
of one of (he drivers involved. These were the
only two accidents at this corner in the past 25
years; "if we'd been neerirgent here," said one Ijni
versitj spoke? man to The Daily yesterday, "you'd
think there would have been other accidents
there." Nevertheless, the University's action in
painting white line: is, as yon indicate, long over
due.â€”Kd.
