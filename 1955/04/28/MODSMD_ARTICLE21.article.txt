# "toward liberal education

### 
To the Editor:
I propose a new course for Stanford seniors that
v/ill make it possible for them to use the liberal
education they have supposedly acquired, develop
interest toward getting a liberal education if they
have nut. demand a program of individual research
by the Indent, require him to organize research
material, found into logical order of importance,
judge the validity of the authority studied and be
able to present his material convincingly.
'Ihis will be a course in debating, say "Debating
57" to have something to call it. The student will be
lotted to seek research materials on his own. with
out the aid of study lists, and will learn by par
ticipating in debate and by listening to others;
criticism will be spontaneous. Because of the flex

ibility of the religious, political, economical,
social, artistic, musical, psychological, scientific, tech
nological . . . virtually any subject could be studied.
Two or three hour labs could meet two or three
times a week, depending upon the credit to be
given for the class, and class sessions would not
necessarily need to meet in the class room. Dis
cussions would be led by a different discussion
leader each week. The discussion leader could be
picked in much the same way that members of the
faculty are picked to give Civ lectures. Celebrated
men could be picked for discussion leaders to add
color and interest to the new subject. A Super
vising Faculty Member would pick the discussion
leaders, and subjects of debate. He would pick
these subjects of sufficient complexity that students
could not rely entirely upon their previous educa
tion, but would have to do quite a bit of individual
research. The Supervising Faculty Member and
discussion leaders might be picked from the pres
ent iaculty with these duties merely supplementary
to the duties they have now.
I have by no means exhausted the possibilities
of Debate 57 and its liberal advantages nor have I
attempted to set up a rigid plan for the course. De
bate fj7 at this stage is merely an idea that can be
used expanded, changed, or forgotten. It is a course
1 would like to take.
