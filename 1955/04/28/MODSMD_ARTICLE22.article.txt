To the Editor:
The Stanford Daily of Tuesday. April 2G, pictured
one Jim Walters stroking the back of an overgrown
hag of eggs. Yes, gentlemen, she bs expecting, not
little frogs as you may have been led to believe,
1 lit little TOADS. Ye.s, gentlemen, TOADS. Gentle
men. please note the undersized tympanum two feet
in Jrorit of Mr. Walters' right hand. This, my friends,
is the mark of that sluggish creature, the toad. Mr.
Walters' beast is much more likely to crawl rather
than jump to DEFEAT.
We are all very much ashamed to find that Mr.
Walters does not know the difference between the
genus Bufo and the genus Rana. This is like running
ijn expectant donkey in the Kentucky Derby. The
Theta Chis will surely lose their shirts if they bet
on that Bufo boreas. Mr. Walters would surely do
much better if he started managing a Rana cates
beiana. Tis on this beast that I shall bet.
