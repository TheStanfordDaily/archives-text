ROGER HAGAN

Dave Brubeck's opening night at the Black Hawk: Guido and
Johnny behind the bar, busy mixing drinks, oblivious to every
thing but the waitresses; people standing in every available
space; kids on dates, looking 22; grey business men in large
groups; a few cats, some drunk, trying to move with the music.

Here and there a middle-aged lady
with her eyes closed, .studious, try
ing not to miss a thing.
Terry Gibbs, with a few days left,
alternating with Brubeck: a hve
wire, flashy at his vibe-, jealous
when Brubeck took the stand. Shak
ing his head, looking around, "I
don't get it; his technique's lousy,"
kidding noisily with a waitress dur
ing a Brubeck solo.
Incongruous in the night-club
crowd, little Sol Weiss in Levis,
thick, glasses and a beard, takim
photos of Brubeck for covers of hi
Fanta.'y records.
In the middle, Brubeck's quick
mind, sometimes resting, .sometimes
racing; composing, concerliicing;
j Desmond nodding, hands crossed
i over his sax, "Yeah." And many
people, more than you'd expect, un
derstanding, following, intent, hush
ing each other up, smiling in quiet
approval when things went right l'o>
Dave and Paul. Usually things did.
