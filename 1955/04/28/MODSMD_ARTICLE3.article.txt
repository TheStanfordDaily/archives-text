WASHINGTONâ€”President Eisen
hower declared today the United
States would be "glad" to sit down
with Communist China and discuss
a Formosan cease-fire and other Far
East issues, including the release of
U.S. prisoners in China.
The only condition, he said, is that
this country will not talk about the
"affairs" of Chiang Kai-shek's Chi
nese N a t i on a li s ts "behind their
backs."
The President told his news con
fcrence he has a "feeling" that hopes
for peace are "on the upswing." He
based this chiefly on Russia's offer
to sign an Austrian peace treaty and
Red Chinese Premier Chou En-lai's
offer to negotiate with this country
on the explosive Formosa issue.
