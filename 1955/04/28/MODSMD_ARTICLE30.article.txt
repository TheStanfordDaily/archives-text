# Cindermen Favored Over Tough San Jose Team
## 
### BOB DURAND 
For the first time in four weeks, Stanford's cindermen will be
playing the role of favorite when they travel to San Jose Saturday
for a dual meet with the Spartans.
The meet, which will take place on Spartan Field beginning at
1 30, will be fhe first for the Indians in two weeks as last Saturday's i

USC meet was postponed until May
10 after two tries to beat the weather.
San Jose State, who has won its last
six meets in a row, will be one of
the toughest foes that the forces of
coach Jack Weiershauser face this
season despite their underdog rating.
In Lynne Greene, tlie Spartans
have the only javelin thrower in
the country better than the Card's
Bob Kimball and John Bugge. They
also are competing with Stanford
for the distinction of having the best
hurdlers on the coast.
RETURNING SPARTANS
However, the Indians will be just
getting a preview of next year's
State squad as every important
member of the Golden Raiders will
be returning except two hurdlers,
Mick Maramonte and Ed Kreyen
hagen, who are scheduled to gradu
ate.
Greene, who came to State this
year after a hitch in the Navy, is
only a junior and will have one more
yead of intercollegiate competition
left after this spring. His best spear
toss this season was 231-9 : !'4 feet,
which is good for best in the country.
Among the other Spartan athletes

who will be back to bother the Tribe
next year are Ray Goodwin, who has
high jumped 6-5 a 4 and broad
jumped 23-10%, Chuck Hightower, a
14-4 polevaulter, and Billy Jo
Wright, who has put the shot 52-5.
TOP RECORD
San Jose State cinder coach Bud
Winter has tutored his team to 4(J
victories in 68 meets over a period
of ten years, despite a lack of out
standing personnel available to him.
In 1952. the Golden Raiders placed
second in the NCAA meet.
The Spartan mentor also coached
State to five CCAA titles in six years
before they finally left the confer
ence. Previously, in seven years of
coaching at Watsonville High School
and Hartnell JC, his teams won four
league championships.
The freshmen teams from the two
schools will meet tomorrow after
noon at Angell Field at 3.
