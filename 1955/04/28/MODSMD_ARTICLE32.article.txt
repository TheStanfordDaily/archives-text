# T.I. Sailors Dump Frosh Swimmers
## 
### BILL NICHOLS Sports Editor, the Daily 
Don Hill, ex-Michigan swimming
ace, led the Treasure Island sailors
to a 50-33 win over the Stanford
freshman last night in the Encina
pool. Hill took two firsts and a third,
in a meet in which times were slow
because of the low temperatures.
Stanford only took three first
places; Cecil Cutting in the 200-
yard backstroke, Harry Collins in
the 200-yard breaststroke, and the
Card team of Nick Ames, John
Trumbull, John Connolly, and Robin
Moore won the 400-yard freestyle
relay.
Robin Moore, the frosh ace, failed
to garner a first, although he took
two seconds in the 50-yard free
style qnd the 440-yard race. Al
though the longest race of the night,
the 440 was the most exciting, as
Moore took an early lead over Art
Smith of TT, but lost it on the 12th
lap, and the sailor maintained a
slim lead for the remaining five and
a half lengths to win in 4:13,7.
Alan Scherer of TI won the diving
and Bob Mclntyre of the Cards w*is
second but the star of the etffent was
Bogey Nelson of the visitors. He fell
off the board three times to take a
third place.
