# Three Card Pitchers Combine for 5-0 Win
## 
### JIM PALMER 
.Three Stanford pitchers shut out San Francisco State on six hits
on the Sunken Diamond yesterday afternoon as the Indians recov
ered from a three-game losing skein to notch a 5-0 victory.
Catcher Len Swartz led the Tribe's batting attack with a triple
and two singles, also scoring three runs. The game's second three-

bagger was tagged by State's Booker
Jackson.
Ed Verdurmen, Dick Jones, and
Walt Payne worked very wobbly,
but were strongly supported by the
# Stanford infield and State's lack of
' hitting-in-the-clutch.
Verdurmen, who got the credit for
I the win. gave free passes to the first
| three men to face him, but managed
to escape the first inning unscathed
1 as the losers failed to come through.
San Francisco loaded up the bases
in the last two innings against
Payne, but a sparkling double play
by second baseman Bob Fletcher to
first baseman Hal Messner saved the
goose eggs in the eighth, and a fine
line-drive catch by Messner retired
the side in the ninth.
Swartz's triple came in the sev
enth inning with none aboard; he
romped home on a fly by Dixie
Workman. The peppy catcher tal
lied Stanford's first run in the sec
ond frame when he scored on a bin
gle by Tom Dandurand.
Line score:
S.F. State .... 000 000 000—0 6 3
Stanford 010 002 20x—5 7 0
