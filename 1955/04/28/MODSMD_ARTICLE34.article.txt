# Ex-SU Baseballers Settle Down for '55
## 
### 
Stanford's representatives in or
ganized baseball have for the most
part settled down with their 1955
clubs. Most have been optioned out
for further seasoning. Jack Shepard
is still with the Pirates, however,
and Lloyd Merriman has been sold
by the White Sox across town to
the Chicago Cubs.
Ray Swarts is playing for the New
Orleans Pelicans, while Bob Mur
phy is another ex-Card in a league
of higher classification. Murphy is
with Oakland. Chuck Essegian was
released by Sacramento and is now
playing in the Texas loop. Warren
Goodrich, from the 1954 team, has
been optioned to Lincoln of the
Western League by Holh'wood.
Phil Page, another 1954 graduate,
is pitching in the new Northwest
loop for Eugene, and appeared here
last week when the Emeralds tan
gled with the Cards. Mike Acker is
back with Channel Cities.
