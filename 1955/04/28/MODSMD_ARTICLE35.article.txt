## Braves Seek Win Over Santa Rosa 
### 
Stanford's oft-rained-out Braves
baseball team will attempt to get in
its first game in two weeks today at
3:15 p.m. in the Sunken Diamond
with Santa Rosa JC providing the
opposition.
The Braves, who won seven out of
their first eight games, but who have
been the losers to rain in their last
three, will have Don Petters, Ray
Highsmith, Gil Duncan, Ken Brown,
and possibly Ed Verdurmen avail
able for mound duty.
Other probable starters will be
Dale Metcalf, catcher; Pete Reyn
olds, Bob Bennett, John Dito, and
Bob Fisher around the infield; and
Ray Looney, Ron Marciel, and Bob
Gergen in the outfield.
