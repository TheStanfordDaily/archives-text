# Frosh Whip Sequoia, 8-7
## 
### 
Stanford's frosh baseball team
made the most of only three hits
yesterday, edging Sequoia High 8-7.
A two-run squeeze bunt by Ron
Jones in the sixth scored the win
ning tallies for the Papooses.
Stanford opened the scoring in the
bottom of the first on a pair of
walks, a sacrifice, and Doug Camil
li's long sacrifice fly to center.
Sequoia jumped ahead with four
unearned runs in the third off Pa
poose starter Rog Bohne. The Cher
okees managed only two hits in that
frame, but five walks, two errors, a
ba4k, and a wild pitch aided their
cause.
Stanford regained the lead in the
fifth inning with a five-run rally.
The Papooses filled the bases on the
visitors' only two errors and a hit
batsman. Pinch-hitter Bob Flanders
punched in two markers with a sin
gle to left.
After Doug Camilli walked to re
fill the sacks, Gordy Medaris blasted
a tremendous triple to right center
for three more runs and a 6-4 lead.
The Cherokees dented the plate
three times in the top of the sixth,
but Jones' beautiful squeeze, scor
ing hustling Wayne West from the
second sack, won the contest for
Stanford.
