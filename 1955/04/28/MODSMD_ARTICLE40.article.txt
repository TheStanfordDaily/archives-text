### 
The Stanford Skiiidi vers Qlub
will take to the cold waters off
Carmel Meadows this Sunday
for their first organized compe
tition. The undersea hunters will
be divided into two classes ac
cording to their proficiency and
will go after two prizes in each
class, one for the largest fish and
one for the largest total pound
age of fish.
Skindivers' president Buck Pierce
stressed that the contest is for novice
undersea men as well ;is experienced
divers. "We're encouraging every
one who's at all interested to come
down and join in," he said.
To give those without the neces
sary equipment a fair chance in the
cold waters, the club has arranged
to provide everyone with protective
suits.
Each of the two groups will have
an hour and thirty minutes to bring
in its catch. Prizes, including an
extra prize for the largest abalone,
have been donated by several Palo
Alto merchants. The competition will
begin at 1 p.m. Sunday afternoon
