# Plans Passed For Music Hall
## 
### 
Preliminary plans for the music
hall which is to house the Florence
Hilman Dinkelspiel Memorial Audi
torium were approved by the Board
of Trustees last week at their
monthly meeting.
Preliminary plans include a 600-
seat auditorium using ultra-modern
acoustic facilities. This is expected
to be one of the outstanding acous
tic buddings in the United States.
The music hall will include re
hearsal and practice rooms.
This is to be built in the area near
where the present post office is sit
uated.
The new music building will pri
marily replace Woodpecker Lodge,
which is now used for practices.
Classes will continue to be held at
the Knoll.
