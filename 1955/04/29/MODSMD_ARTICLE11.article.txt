# GE Research Lab to Double Present Size
## 
### 
With one eye on the future
and one eye on the present The
General Electric Company an
nounced yesterday plans to
double the size of its new micro
wave research laboratory in the
Stanford light industrial area.
Only last November GE opened
up its building on California Ave
nue. The rapid advances that have
been made in the application of
microwave electron tubes to the
communications and radar indus
tries have necessitated an expan
sion, according to laboratory man
ager H. R. Oldfield Jr.
LAM) DOUBLED
General Electric, in doubling its
leasehold from three to six acres,
will increase its floor space by 10.000
square feet and expand its staff from
70 to 140 employees by the end of
the year when the new lab is ex
pected to be completed.
Oldfield said that construction
would start in a few days and that
the same type of architecture would
be followed. The original building
was designed to make room for fu
ture expansion.
Announcement of the expansion
comes just a month before the labo
ratory's formal dedication, which is
scheduled for May 27.
Future expansion is also planned,
according to Oldfield, which will
bring the laboratory to its optimum
size.
RESEARCH
The program of applied research
and advance engineering in micro
waves at the laboratory includes the
research and development of new
and improved microwave tubes of
all types and power levels and the
•application of new microwave tubes
to advanced military and commer
cial problems.
Alf E. Brand in, Stanford Business
Manager, announced that the Uni
versity would build the expansion
just as it had the original structure.
San Francisco architect John C.
YVarnecke designed the addition.
GE was one of the pioneers in the
industrial tract, preceded only by
Eastman Kodak and Varian Asso
ciates. Other members of the indus
trial family include Palo Alto Engi
neering, Hewlett - Packard, Scott-
Forsman, Houghton - Mifflin, and
Preform Line Products.
