# SRI Economist Lauds Aid to Poor Nations

### DICK MEISTER 
"We want a world that fosters
human dignity. A world where
people are reasonably free to
develop their interests, partici
pate in government, and reach
a reasonable standard of living."
And the United Nations technical
assistance program is helping to
achieve this goal of the United States
in its U.N. role as stated by Dr. Eu
gene Staley in the campus Little
Theater last night.
Dr. Staley, a Stanford Research
Institute senior international econo
mist, speaking before the prelimi
nary session of the seventh annual
United Nations Conference for Cali
fornia High Schools, outlined the
U.N.'s program of international
technical assistance which involves
the development of the so - called
underdeveloped nations of the world
through financial aid as well as with
the aid of qualified experts from
U.N. countries.
The new theory of such aid is to
help the countries "help them
selves," Staley said. For instance,
CARE is now sending tool kits,
rather than the usual food packets,
to these underdeveloped nations to
help the nations in establishing pri
vate enterprise, also a goal of the
technical assistance program.
By working through the U.N. pro
gram, Staley said, the United States
can see more work done in countries
which we, acting alone, couldn't do.
A recent case cited by the speaker
was in Bolivia, where the country
was badly in need of public admin
istrators. The United States could
hardly send direct aid for fear of
Red nation charges of "Yankee im
perialism.'' However, working
through the U.N., Staley points out,
we can get such aid accomplished
without being accused of interfer
ence.
The conference, sponsored by the
Institute of International Relations,
will continue this weekend with ses
sions planned for today on "'The
U.N. in Action" and"The U.N. in the
High School" at Cubberley Audito
rium. Saturday a session is also
planned for Cubberley with the con- I
ference to end that night at a ban
quet at the Old Plantation.
