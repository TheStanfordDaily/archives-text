# Spartan Spikers Battle Indians in San Jose
## 
### BOB DURAND 
With a gleam of victory in their eyes, the track Indians of Stan
ford travel south to Spartan Field tomorrow where San lose Stale
hosts them in a dual meet. The first field event is scheduled to
begin at 1:30, and the first race at 2.
The Golden Raider thinclads have a winning streak of six wins

under their belt against mediocre
competition. The Tribe is due to
give them their first stiff opposition
this spring.
Among their victims are Califor
nia, whom they trounced decisively,
and Fresno State, whom the Cards
scuttled by a 82'/j-48-/j count earlier
in the spring.
GREENE LEADS SPARTANS
The Spartans are paced by a br-vy
of individual stars who are respon
sible for tehir team's success llm
season. Among them are javelin
thrower Lynne Greene and hurdler:.
Mick Maramonte and Ed Kreyen
hagen.
Greene has to his credit the be"t
spear toss in the country this year
while Maramonte and Kreyenhagen
are regarded as two of the beat
stick jumpers in the West.
The Indians will be giving them
their toughest competition yet when
they throw javeliners Bob Kimball
and John Bugge against Greene, and
hurdlers Bernie Nelson and Jim
Luttrell against the other two.
SPRINTS LOOK CLOSE
While the javelin and the low and
high hurdles are due to be the top
events, the closest races of the day
figure to be the two in which State's
Maramonte and will fight it out with
the Indians' dash duo of Keith
Brownsberger and Jim Sarah.
Other competitions which should
prove exciting to the fans who travel
to San Jose tomorrow are the bro.id
jump, in which Stanford's Frank
Herrmann (23-10%) will oppose Ray
Goodwin (23-10%), and the high
jump, in which Goodwin will face a
trio of John Stewart, Phil Fehlen,
and Norm Jiles.
Another unpredictable event will

INDIAN BILL FLINT CLEARS THE BAR
be the shot put, in which the Cards'
A 1 Cheney (52-4V2) will go against
the Golden Raiders' sensational
sophomore star Billy Jo Wright (52-
5).
An unusually close race seems to
be developing in the 880-vard run
where four out of the first five fast
est entries have exactly the same
time as their best effort this spring.
Quite a few meet records are in
danger of being broken during the
afternoon. The Spartans' Charles
Hightower has cleared 14-4 in the
pole vault this season and the meet
record stands at 14-1 1 i. The jave
lin record is 227-5V2, a distance
which has been bettered by Greene.
GARRETT AFTER MARK
Stanford's claim -to fame in the
440-yard run. Walt Garrett, appears
to be able to break the meet record
of 48.3 in that event. Garrett has
done 47.9 this spring and is capable
of doing faster, according to coach
Weiershauser.
One record that is almost a cer
tainty to be broken during the meet
is the two-mile mark of 9:37.3. Two
StanforcMtes, Chuck Strong and Wil
King, both have recoided better
times this year. Strong broke the
tape in 9:25.1 against Occidental
two weeks ago.
POSSIBLE 880 WIN
Although the Indians have yet to
win a mile relay this spring, if coach
Weiershauser comes up with a com
bination that can click, that meet
record may fall too. The present
mark is 3:17.3, .set by the Cards in
1949."
For the first time this season, the
Tribe is in a position to take a first
in the 880. Ford Sims has been im
proving steadily all during the last
several months and appears ready to
come up with a winning effort.
