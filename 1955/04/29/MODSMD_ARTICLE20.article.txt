Moat associated student organizations have
publications in fo :r fields: a year book, a hu
mor magazine, a newspaper, and a literary
magazine. Stanford students publish the Quad,
the Chaparral, and The Daily. But at present
there is no student literary magazine here.
Students ar.d professors alike have frequent
ly commented on this lack and have often won
dered why Stanford has no magazine and what
could be done about a new literary venture,
providing ilhat the student body would support
it.
The most recent attempt at publishing such a
magazine here was in 1953 when "Viewpoint"
.was put out under the editorship of A 1 Brouse,
new lIR president. The magazine soon folded
because of lack of funds. Brouse had this to
say concerning the advisability of publishing a
new li'.erary magazine on campus:
". . . This evidence of apathy [lack of student
financing! should not, I believe, be taken as
conclusive proof thai a literary magazine is not
wanted. I consider the publication of a maga
zine similar to the'groa: literary quarterlies of
our Eastern universities, devoted to present
ing the creative work of the Stanford commu
nity, to be an extremely valuable undertaking,
but capablc of success only if proper financing
is guaranteed. Along this line, I might suggest
a joint subsidization by the Associated Stu
!tnts and the University to cover any losses—
small price t;> pay for such a worthy addition
! o the list of Stanford publications."
Other student comments:
'Money Nulier, '55: "A literary magazine is
cn excellent idea and would be successful only
in the case that it appealed to a large enough

group on campus and regained certain aca- 1
demic standards. The bas:c problem is that of |
deciding what group you're going to appeal
to. The appeal must be as broad as possible
and of long-term interest."
Phyllis M surer, '56: "The appeal of the maga- j
zine depends entirely on the quality of the !
writing. It could be a Chappie with snob ap-;
peal. It must be run by people with more in-1
terest in literature than Stanford itself and
prestige factors."
Ann Fitzgerald, graduate student: ". . . It
must represent all facets at the University. A
university can best do such a job because it
has men of the best academic discipline from
every field. It should pull its material from as
many departments as possible, avoiding the
humanities. 'Viewpoint' failed mostly because
it was primarily a venture of the creative writ
ing department."
Jim Hinton, '50: "To succeed it would have
to have interesting articles, designed for stu
dents. On the whole I Ihink it would be a i
good idea."
On the whole t seems that the Stanford stu
dent would like to see a literary magazine on
campus, but one of top quality. Without the
necessary excellence it would seem to be
doomed o failure, as "Viewpoint." Students
want assurance that the magazine would be
aimed at their interests and kept at a high qual
ity level.
In studying the topic of "intellectual atmos
phere" al the University, the Study of Under
graduate Education- has noted that such a ven
ture would possibly do much to improve this
atmosphere providing that students were
willing lo support the magazine.

zine depends entirely on the quality of the !
writing. It could be a Chappie with snob ap-;

Ann Fitzgerald, graduate student: ". . . It
must represent all facets at the University. A
university can best do such a job because it
has men of the best academic discipline from
every field. It should pull its material from as
many departments as possible, avoiding the
humanities. 'Viewpoint' failed mostly because
it was primarily a venture of the creative writ
ing department."
Jim Hinton, '50: "To succeed it would have
to have interesting articles, designed for stu
dents. On the whole I Ihink it would be a i
good idea."
On the whole t seems that the Stanford stu
dent would like to see a literary magazine on
campus, but one of top quality. Without the
necessary excellence it would seem to be
doomed o failure, as "Viewpoint." Students
want assurance that the magazine would be
aimed at their interests and kept at a high qual
ity level.
In studying the topic of "intellectual atmos
phere" al the University, the Study of Under
graduate Education- has noted that such a ven
ture would possibly do much to improve this
atmosphere providing that students were
willing lo support the magazine.


STANFORD'S LITERARY PAST ... DO WE WANT A FUTURE? (See below)
Moat associated student organizations have
publications in fo :r fields: a year book, a hu
mor magazine, a newspaper, and a literary
magazine. Stanford students publish the Quad,
the Chaparral, and The Daily. But at present
there is no student literary magazine here.
Students ar.d professors alike have frequent
ly commented on this lack and have often won
dered why Stanford has no magazine and what
could be done about a new literary venture,
providing ilhat the student body would support
it.
The most recent attempt at publishing such a
magazine here was in 1953 when "Viewpoint"
.was put out under the editorship of A 1 Brouse,
new lIR president. The magazine soon folded
because of lack of funds. Brouse had this to
say concerning the advisability of publishing a
new li'.erary magazine on campus:
". . . This evidence of apathy [lack of student
financing! should not, I believe, be taken as
conclusive proof thai a literary magazine is not
wanted. I consider the publication of a maga
zine similar to the'groa: literary quarterlies of
our Eastern universities, devoted to present
ing the creative work of the Stanford commu
nity, to be an extremely valuable undertaking,
but capablc of success only if proper financing
is guaranteed. Along this line, I might suggest
a joint subsidization by the Associated Stu
!tnts and the University to cover any losses—
small price t;> pay for such a worthy addition
! o the list of Stanford publications."
Other student comments:
'Money Nulier, '55: "A literary magazine is
cn excellent idea and would be successful only
in the case that it appealed to a large enough

group on campus and regained certain aca- 1
demic standards. The bas:c problem is that of |
deciding what group you're going to appeal
to. The appeal must be as broad as possible
and of long-term interest."
