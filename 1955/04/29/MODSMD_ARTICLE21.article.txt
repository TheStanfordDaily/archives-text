Biology 3 is a very interesting course. Ev
ciybocly says so. In fact, everybody says, "My,
v/hat an interesting course Eiology 3 would be
if only I didn't have to get a grade in it and
didn't have to go to lab. My lab man is lousy
md besides I never understand v/hat is going
in and ihen we have a guiz and I go down the
*')es. It sure is an interesting course though."
you want io know why I think Biology 3
is sjch an interesting course I'll tell you. It is
it is so interesting—it provides food
[or the cerebrum, or is it the thymus (anyway,
we learned all about it last guarter). My in
structor says I don't retain very well and maybe
I don't but I think the tests are unfair, and I
said so, and then he said—but we are getting
off 'he point (as someone said the o.her day in
much the same spot under similar circum
stances).
We were saying that Biology 3 provides food

for thought and so it does. Jusi today I was |
reading in our textbook where i>! Says that "the
resemblances between men and apes and
monkeys are too numerous to dismiss as coin
cidental." And ihen it goes on to say that
. . chimpanzees would appear io be entirely
capable of speech," and that only "motivation"
is lacking.
Just think about this — real monkeys and
chimpanzees walking around Quad, attending
classes, maybe even lecturing. With a coat and j
tie on, how could you tell the students from the
faculty? The way it is now there isn't much of
a problem, cxcept in some extreme cases. AS
SU Excom would have to get out a booklet or
a broadside or something telling frosh how to
tell the faculty from the students. And for a
caper, think about apes lecturing in Biology to
monkeys about chimpanzees . . .
Personally, I can hardly wait . . .
