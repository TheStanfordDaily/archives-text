## Allied Arts Guild Helps Con Home 
### DOROTHY CAMPBELL 
Working in surroundings of colorful Colonial Spanish architec
ture, the ladies of ihe Woodside-Atherton Auxiliary contribute \o
the Convalescent Home all year through the Allied Arts Guild.
The Guild enables people in the community to watch skillful
craftsmen ply their trades of metal work, pottery making, weav-

ing, and forming jewelry from semi
precious stones while they look for
gifts. All profits from these sales go
to the Con Home.
j The property on which the Guild
I is situated was once the Rancho de
j las Pulgas, owned by Don Jose Ar-
I guello, commandant of San Joss in
1 the early 1830's. He had received it
j as a grant from the king of Spain.
In 1Q29 the Garfield Merners, world
' travelers and collectors, purchased
j three and a,half acres of the prop
erty and established the Guild as a
place where they could foster the
j early crafts of California.
EUROPEAN DESIGN
With the assistance of prominent
architects and artists who designed
and decorated the buildings, the
; Guild took shape, modeled after
similar institutions in Europe. The
still usable barns and sheep shear
ing sheds were retained.
The Merners became interested in
! the Convalescent Home and in 1932
j invited the Palo Alto Auxiliary to
j maintain and run a lunoh room,
j Members of this volunteer group in
stalled facilities and turned over all
the money they earned to the Con
valescent Home. Luncheon and tea
j are still served every afternoon, ei
ther inside or on the patio which is
rin the middle of a lavish tulip gar
den.
GARDEN DELIGHT
All the flowers in the garden are
I blue. Graceful wisteria hangs from
I the buildings, which fit naturally
into the landscaping. Adjoining this
! are the Courts of Abundance which
featurs masses of tulips.
"The stone paths which connect
; the gardens and lead to the shops
| were made from stones gathered
J from a river which runs through the
property," said Mrs. Varthv, pro
| motion and publiciy chairman.
Shops are conveniently placed at
the entrance and adjoin each other.
The new Contemporary shop won a
prize for its architecture. There is
also a Children's shop; a Traditional
shop with copper and brass wear,
home-made candy, and spiced tea; a
Patio shop; and the Flea Market
where reduced items from the other
shops are put on sale.
The stores still have the tradition
al corner fireplaces, iron work, and
murals which identify Spanish ar
chitecture. All the money earned in
these stores is turned over to the
Convalescent Home by the ladies of
the Woodisde - Atherton Auxiliary,

property," said Mrs. Varthv, pro

Shops are conveniently placed at
the entrance and adjoin each other.
The new Contemporary shop won a
prize for its architecture. There is
also a Children's shop; a Traditional
shop with copper and brass wear,
home-made candy, and spiced tea; a
Patio shop; and the Flea Market
where reduced items from the other
shops are put on sale.
The stores still have the tradition
al corner fireplaces, iron work, and
murals which identify Spanish ar
chitecture. All the money earned in
these stores is turned over to the
Convalescent Home by the ladies of
the Woodisde - Atherton Auxiliary,
who took over the project in 1935.
Working in surroundings of colorful Colonial Spanish architec
ture, the ladies of ihe Woodside-Atherton Auxiliary contribute \o
the Convalescent Home all year through the Allied Arts Guild.
The Guild enables people in the community to watch skillful
craftsmen ply their trades of metal work, pottery making, weav-

ing, and forming jewelry from semi
precious stones while they look for
gifts. All profits from these sales go
to the Con Home.
j The property on which the Guild
I is situated was once the Rancho de
j las Pulgas, owned by Don Jose Ar-
I guello, commandant of San Joss in
1 the early 1830's. He had received it
j as a grant from the king of Spain.
In 1Q29 the Garfield Merners, world
' travelers and collectors, purchased
j three and a,half acres of the prop
erty and established the Guild as a
place where they could foster the
j early crafts of California.
EUROPEAN DESIGN
With the assistance of prominent
architects and artists who designed
and decorated the buildings, the
; Guild took shape, modeled after
similar institutions in Europe. The
still usable barns and sheep shear
ing sheds were retained.
The Merners became interested in
! the Convalescent Home and in 1932
j invited the Palo Alto Auxiliary to
j maintain and run a lunoh room,
j Members of this volunteer group in
stalled facilities and turned over all
the money they earned to the Con
valescent Home. Luncheon and tea
j are still served every afternoon, ei
ther inside or on the patio which is
rin the middle of a lavish tulip gar
den.
GARDEN DELIGHT
All the flowers in the garden are
I blue. Graceful wisteria hangs from
I the buildings, which fit naturally
into the landscaping. Adjoining this

featurs masses of tulips.
