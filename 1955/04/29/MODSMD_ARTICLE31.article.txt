Jose Slate's yearling-; this afternoon
at 3.30 on Angell Field, provided
that the weather is all right. The
track is fairly dry but l'ro.-.h coach
Ri.y Dean fears what more rain
would do to it.
The frosh spikers, paced by ace
distance runner Maury Graves,
houldn't be pushed too hard by the
' partem juniors, since the Staters
have failed to impress in any of their
earlier meet.s.
