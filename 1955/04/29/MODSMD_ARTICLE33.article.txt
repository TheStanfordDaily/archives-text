# Cal Poly Hosts Tribe in Country Days Ball Game
## 
### 
The Stanford baseballers board the Daylight this morning at
8 for a trek to San Luis Obispo and two games against the Cal Poly
Mustangs. Stanford will be in town for the annual Cal Poly Coun
try Days celebration at which there is an intercollegiate rodeo,
track meet, and baseball game.
The Mus'.angs have never lost a baseball game on Country Day,

and the Deanmen will have to battle
this jinx as well as the Cal Poly
team. The Cards, who broke a
three-game losing streak with a 5-0
win over San Francisco State two
clays ago, will send their two slight
ly tarnished aces, Walt Payne and
Ray Young, to the hill.
Young, who has slipped somewhat
from his 1954 record, will attempt to
quell the Mustang bats on Friday
and Payne will take the hill on Sat
urday. Coach Dean stated that he
knew nothing about the Poly team;
however, they dropped a 13-7 game
to USC on Tuesday, and played Cal
on Wednesday.
The Cards, who are currently only
a half-game ahead of Cal in the
CIBA race, could fall into fourth if
the Bears can take two from UCLA.
The Tribe returns to league action
next weekend as they play two
games with Cal and close out CIBA
play with three games against USC
and UCLA.
The Cards will play their usual
lineup with Mickey Holzman and
Bob Fletcher alternating at second.
