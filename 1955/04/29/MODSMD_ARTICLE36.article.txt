### JIM BAKER 
For the third time in three weeks,
varsity swimming coach Tom Hay
nie's comment on the coming meet
was, "We should win easily." Today,
the Cards meet College of the Pacific
at 3:30 p.m. in the Encina Pool.
The Indians, who last week were
only four points away from a com
plete sweep, might have one today.
COP offers real competition in only
two eventsâ€”Bob Gan in the 150-
yard individual medley, and Dickson
Moogs in the 100-yard freestyle.
Leading the Cards as usual will be
Phil Gay, PCC champion in the 50-
yard freestyle, and Larry Heim,
holder of the PCC record in the in
dividual medley.
Making his second official appear
ance with the varsity will be Kasu
ichi Mori, national diving champion
of Japan, who is now a student here.
Mori won last week's competition
with a total of 215.7 points.
Sophomore Denny Stimson, who
last week was barely edged by Gay,
will be a cinch second place this
week and may beat out his team
mate. Stimson also swims one lap of
the 440-yard relay.
Another talented soph, Phil Clock,
will be counted on for several points.
Clock swims in the medley relay
and the 200-yard breaststroke.
Other probable winners are Eon
Grunt in the 200-yard backstroke,
Dan Osborne in the 220-yard free
style. and Bill Hynes in the 440-yard
freestyle.
The Indians meet University of
Southern California next weekend,
in what may be their toughest bat
tle of the year. Therefore, the meet
today might have slower times than
usual because the swimmers will be
looking ahead. No chance for an
upset, though.
