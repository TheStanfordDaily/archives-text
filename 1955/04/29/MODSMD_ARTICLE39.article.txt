# First Scrum Of Season Tomorrow
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
Football fans will get their first
chance to see Coach Chuck Taylor's
Indiana in action tomorrow when
the head mentor sends his charges
through their first scrimmage of the
spring practice session.
The Bi-j Red coaching staff, com
pletely intact from last year, lias
worked out a new innovation for
scrimmage sessions in an effort to
keep spirit and competition at a
maximum. The new system will in
volve splitting the squad up into
four equal teams which will pair off
against each other alternately in a
round robin affair. Under this sys
tem the boys will be playing against
different "teams." This should stim
ulate competition by creating a sort
of league.
According to Taylor, the spring
schedule calls for contact scrim
mages under full game conditions
every Monday, Thursday, and Sat
urday. The early week-day sessions
will begin at 3:30 in the afternoon
but the Saturday work will get
under way in the morning at 11.
The general feeling down at the
field during workouts this past week
is that at last the Big Red machine
has the horses to do the work. With
a few breaks from Lady Luck the
Indians could find themselves pre
occupied next New Year's Day. The
public is heartily encouraged to at
tend the 'scrimmages which will
bring them in contact with the play
ers and the coaching staff.
Taylor wanted to emphasize that
competition is extremely close this
year and that there are very few, if
any, "fixed" positions.
