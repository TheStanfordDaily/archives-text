### 
A major San Francisco depart
ment store, Livingston Bros., has
announced its plan to open a
branch in the University's multi
million dollar shopping center
and Admiral Corp. is reported to
be negotiating with Stanford for
land here.
Livingston Bros, will occupy the
center portion of a glass - walled
building in the shopping center. It
will be flanker in the building by
Roos Bros, and J. Magnin Co.
Officials of the firm, which al
ready operates stores in downtown
San Francisco and Stonestown, said
their quarters would contain 15,000
square feet of selling space.
$470,000 CENTER
The building to be occupied by
Livingston's, Roos, and Magnin's is
set at a $470,000 value by a building
permit.
The Admiral Corp. wants the land
to establish an electronics labora
tory, presumably in the Stanford
light industrial tract in South Palo
Alto.
Lloyd S. Weber, San Jose Cham
ber of Commerce industrial mana
ger, revealed that plans are nearly
complete for the project.
Admiral officials said that a formal
announcement would be forthcom
ing "in about a week or so."
NOT CONFIRMED
Alf E. Brandin, University Busi
ness Manager, neither confirmed nor
denied that negotiations wore being
made for a leaseholding.
He did state that "Such announce
ments are properly made by the
firm which would occupy leased
land, and any information relative
to plans would of necessity have to
come from the firm itself."
Admiral is one of the leading tel
evision manufacturers and electron
ics firms in the nation. It has oper
ated a small laboratory on College
Avenue since February, 1953, where
20 engineers have concentrated on
the development of color TV equip
ment and other electronic devices.
No estimate was available on the
size of the land for which Admiral
is dickering.
