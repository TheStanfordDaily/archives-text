# Alpha Delts Get Social Probation, Work Hours for 'Failure to Meet Requirements and Responsibilities'
## 
### JOHN McFEE 
Alpha Delta Phi was given so
cial probation until fall quarter
and 16 University work hours
per man by the Inter-fraternity
Council's Judiciary Committee
last Thursday "for failure to
meet the requirements and re
sponsibilities of a Stanford fra
ternity over the past academic
year."
The Alpha Delts will also be under
overall probation until June, 1956.
If any further action against the
house is brought before the IFC
committee before this date, the fra
ternity will be automatically sus
pended.
MANY INCIDENTS
A water fight Wednesday, which
was started by the Alpha Delts and
spread to several other fraternities
and Row houses, was the immediate
cause which brought the case to
the committee's attention. However,
the penalty was not based solely
on this water fight but on a series
of little incidents since the begin
ning of fall quarter which reflected
the inability of the Alpha Delts to
exercise good judgment in determin
ing the difference between fun and
infringement upon the rights of oth

ers, according to the IFC committee.
All Alpha Delt social privileges
until Sept. 26 have been suspended.
This includes participation in Spring
Sing, in which the Alpha Delts have
won sweepstakes for the past two
years. House parties, dances, and
overnights have also been canceled.
In the sentence, University work
hours were substituted for the usual
penalty of Con Home hours. These
hours must be worked off by the
house as a group and will be done
for the University — painting,
straightening up parts of the
grounds, or whatever the Corpora- :
tion Yard wants done.
MAJOR DECISION
This was the first major decision ,
to be handed down by the new i
seven-member IFC Judicial Com
mittee, which was established late in
winter quarter. The committee now
includes Ron Wagner, IFC president;
Otis Winters, ex-IFC president; Wes
Gardiner, Head Resident Assistant;
Heath McLendon, chairman of the
House Managers' Association; and
IFC members Louis Amestoy, Pete
Scott, and George McCown. The
administration played no part in the
handling of the case.
"It is regrettable, yet justifiable,
that such measures were taken
against the Alpha Delts by the IFC
Judicial Committee last Thursday,"
said IFC president Ron Wagner. "As

the stringency of the verdict implies,
an academic year of irresponsible
conduct was the basis of adjudica
tion, and not simply the water fight
incident on Wednesday. It is hoped
that this action will both enlighten
and remind Stanford fraternities of
j their obligations and responsibilities
assumed by any living group on this
! campus."

ALPHA DELTA PHI FRATERNITY HOUSE
Alpha Delta Phi was given so
cial probation until fall quarter
and 16 University work hours
per man by the Inter-fraternity
Council's Judiciary Committee
last Thursday "for failure to
meet the requirements and re
sponsibilities of a Stanford fra
ternity over the past academic
year."
The Alpha Delts will also be under
overall probation until June, 1956.
If any further action against the
house is brought before the IFC
committee before this date, the fra
ternity will be automatically sus
pended.
MANY INCIDENTS
A water fight Wednesday, which
was started by the Alpha Delts and
spread to several other fraternities
and Row houses, was the immediate
cause which brought the case to
the committee's attention. However,
the penalty was not based solely
on this water fight but on a series
of little incidents since the begin
ning of fall quarter which reflected
the inability of the Alpha Delts to
exercise good judgment in determin
ing the difference between fun and
infringement upon the rights of oth

ers, according to the IFC committee.
All Alpha Delt social privileges
until Sept. 26 have been suspended.
This includes participation in Spring
Sing, in which the Alpha Delts have
won sweepstakes for the past two
years. House parties, dances, and
overnights have also been canceled.
In the sentence, University work
hours were substituted for the usual
penalty of Con Home hours. These
hours must be worked off by the
house as a group and will be done
for the University — painting,
straightening up parts of the
grounds, or whatever the Corpora- :
tion Yard wants done.
MAJOR DECISION
This was the first major decision ,
to be handed down by the new i
seven-member IFC Judicial Com
mittee, which was established late in
winter quarter. The committee now
includes Ron Wagner, IFC president;
Otis Winters, ex-IFC president; Wes
Gardiner, Head Resident Assistant;
Heath McLendon, chairman of the
House Managers' Association; and
IFC members Louis Amestoy, Pete
Scott, and George McCown. The
administration played no part in the
handling of the case.
"It is regrettable, yet justifiable,
that such measures were taken
against the Alpha Delts by the IFC
Judicial Committee last Thursday,"
said IFC president Ron Wagner. "As

the stringency of the verdict implies,
an academic year of irresponsible
conduct was the basis of adjudica
tion, and not simply the water fight
incident on Wednesday. It is hoped
that this action will both enlighten
and remind Stanford fraternities of
j their obligations and responsibilities
assumed by any living group on this
! campus."
