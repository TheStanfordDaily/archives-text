# Muffin Baker Wins, Siren Loses Wintergreen in '55 Spring Show
## 
### JAE HUNLEY 
Jilted for a corn muffin. That's
Diana Devereaux's (Alice Mi:ldle
kauff) sad plight in this year's
Spring Show, "01 Thee I Sing.'
Miss Devereaux, the most tempt
ing siren ever to cross the Memo
rial Auditorium stage, is the win
ner of a national beauty contest and
her prize is supposed to be the Pres
ident of the United States, John P.
Wintergreen.
However, Mr. Wintergreen (Bert
Berns) spurns the luscious Deve
reaux for Mary Turner (Carolyn
Cowan) and her corn muffins. And
there the complications begin.
Before it is all solved, France pre
pares for war; the Senate begins im
peachment proceedings against the
President; and twins are born to the
Presidential pair.
Even the forlorn, forgotten Vice-
President. Alexander T'hrottlebot
tom, gets into the act and teaches the
Senate to mambo.
All of this is done to the tune of
George Gershwin's sparkling music,
and it promises to raise the roof in
Memorial Auditorium this Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday.
Tickets for the show are on sale
at the Memorial Auditorium box of
fice and at Engineering Corner on
campus. There are still good seats
available for opening night, accord
ing to the Ram's Head business man
ager, Jon Stufflebeem.
Curtain time each night will be at
8:15.
The show is being directed bv
Warner Leßoy.. Music director is
Bill Scott, and choreographer is
Mary Sherman. Others on the staff
include W. Kirk MacNulty, technical
director; Robert Levin, lighting de
sign; Sharon Harris, costume design;
and Astrid Willsrud, makeup artist.
