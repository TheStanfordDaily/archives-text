# BOOK PURGE
## Mrs. Smart Speaks in P.A. 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Mrs. Anne Smart, a young
woman with a militant desire to s
see American schools purged of
subversive and immoral liter
ature, came to Palo Alto last;
Thursday afternoon.
And behind her sne left an emo- '
tional wave of controversy over
whether books such as those she
condemned should be censored from
public schools. Here she said they
would "plant the seeds of Commu
nism and immorality in the minds of
our children.."
Emotions and tempers rose among
the women of the South Palo Alto
Women's Club to whom she spoke,
as she proceeded to produce a
lengthy list of books from Drake
High School in Marin County which
she said advocated Communism, im
morality, and world government'.
AMERICAN PRISONS
She first produced the book by
Lowell Naeve, "A Field of Broken
Stones," concerning life in an Amer
ican prison. There was some ti'uth
in the book, she conceded, but "Is
this what we want our children to
read?"
The book "H Is for Heroin." she
said, contained no moral, only the
filth of the dope world. Persons in
the audience later rose to say that
they had found a definite moral in
the book.
"The Growing Human Family," by
a United Nations official, contains
the whole Communist party line and
ends with a chapter on world gov
ernment, she stated emphatically.
"This," she said, "is being sold to
high school students who have not I
yet reached emotional maturity, and
it does not show what this (world
government) would lead to."
PEARL BUCK ATTACKED
Then she attacked a book by
Pearl Buck, whom she termed a
Communist sympathizer.
In reference to books by United
Nations officials, the young ' woman
declared that "it is treason to teach j
relinquishment of the sovereignty of!
the United States of America."
"Do you want text books written
by people from all over the world."
she said, "who have ideas different j
than ours?"
"We want schools to teach the
truth, love of home, country, and j
I family."
112 EVIL BOOKS'
Stating that the schools choose
evil books over good classics, she j
.said that this discrimination is the i
"worst kind of censorship." Thus she
reasoned, "I am trying to get rid of
censorship."
Indignation and admiration were
alternately arrayed as Mrs. Smart
attempted to answer questions and
refute arguments put forward by,
persons in the audience.
In a dramatic climax to the meet
ing, Howard Poase, the author of
many children's books, rose and an
i>rilv labeled Mrs. Smart as "sub
â€¢>
versive and un-American.
