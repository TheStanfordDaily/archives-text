not avoiding humanities
To the F Jitor:
Nov/ 1 know how other innocent victims l'eel. as
I,' . ,- a!' roundly mi quoted on subjects in which
t.joy are interested.
It- ;.n interview with The Daily, I offered some
oo:;:ion.-i a;id suggestions on the subject of "Literary
Magazine:;" here at Sianford. I did venture the
theory that one of the reasons why "Viewpoint"
fail'd <A'a thai it representvd the efforts and thoughts
. : ,d ifitc r< •: of only a . mall part ol the University.
On the other hand, I never did say that one way to
!-■;.( i" this shortcoming was by "avoiding the hil
i ianitic as I was quoted as saying.
'I lie; n i under. I 'landing may have grown out of the
ia t thai I did suggest drawing upon as large and
\• i ;ed a group for contributions as possible. I poin'cd
o.it that, in a university, we gather together the best
a,oid■; that we can in the various fields of study. How
c.vr. I. cause many of the members of our faculty are
:K'h tovat man, they have a view much broader than
ilk limits of the fields of their specialization. For
thi it a on, we should 10-e much if wc did not take
i I a opportunity to hear from them in a magazine
: uch as that under discussion.
Certainly, this idea does not eliminate students and
faculty whose interest is in the humanities! In all
likelihood, these people would be your core group in
,!.< fiiundin ■, and maintaining of a "Literary Maga
. no." My |ilea Was simply that representatives of
other di eipline: Le encouraged to contribute.

at no extra cost
To the Editor:
La. t Friday The Daily ran a column suggesting
tin po: ibilily of reviving a literary magazine for
Stanford. One : Indent commented that such a maga
, i.f could conceivably become "a Chappie with snob
: |» ( a ai." Lids letter, then, is to inform you that the
( ;a| ie now lias "snob a| peal." Tin- forthcoming
i: aL' iilowbrow i sin 1 , due ai 'tin stands on May

11, will include at no extra cost to the rendei a ccm
j letc and unique booklet lor "the hyper-intellectual"
entitle:! "Two." 'i he booklet will contain stories,
]jo. nr . . nicies and art designs intended to stimulate
tin vegetating thinking centers of Stanford students.
Not only that, but the pamphlet is funny too.
