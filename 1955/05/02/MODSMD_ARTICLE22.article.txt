# 'Personal' Approach Is Guide Service's Goal
## 
### SYDNEY LITTLE 
For most of the hundred-thousand visitors attracted to :he camp
us each year, the only official contact with the University is the
Stanford Guide Service.
This organization is a division of the Office of Information and j
Publications and its purpose, according to head guide Dwight

Clark, is to make visitors' experi-*
ence hero as personal and friendly
as possible. The Service consists of
15 students, each of whom takes
turns giving confused visitors direc
tions and information at the "cell"
in front of Memorial Court, taking
groups through Memorial Church ,
and to the top of Hoover Tower, and
giving tours of the campus.
The Church and the Tower are
standard features of any tour. Oth
er points of interest depend upon the
group itself, which may range from
the wives of members of a conven
tion meeting in San Francisco to a
high school club or class.
TYPICAL TOUil
A typical tour might be a group of
GO high school seniors eager to glean
some information on Stanford as a
prospective home and school. Ar
rangements would be made by them
through Mrs. Barbara Cochran, as
sistant director of publications, who,
through letters and perhaps a phono
call, would learn what the group
wants to see, whether they would
bring lunches, and other details.
Two guides meet the group when
they arrive at the "cell." Campus
maps and copies of The Daily are
distributed. Then each guide takes
half the students to the Church or

â–º
the Tower. After the groups have
keen to both places, they meet at
the Cellar for lunch, alter which
they go to a room on Quad for a
talk by an admissions official. A trip
to the museum ends the tour.
GUIDES BENEFIT
"While guides are paid for their
work, they feel that one of the
greatest benefits of guiding is the :
opportunity for contact with many j
; kinds of people from all over the i
country and world, and the chance j
to perform a valuable service to !
their school," states Clark.
Because of its desirability, there |
are always many more applications
for jobs than there are jobs avail
able. Guides work from two to 12
hours a week depending on their
schedules.
TOUR FACTS
The main body of facts given on
the average tour is learned by the
guide from a guide handbook, but
the manner of presentation or as
j pect to the University stressed is
left to the individual student. Guides
| undergo no formal training.
Two guides are on duty at the
Tower Monday through Friday from
1 to 5 p.m. anof on Saturday's from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and the "oell" is
1 open daily.
