The College of Pacific mermen at
tempted to halt the winning ways
of the powerful Indian outfit yester
day but were completely outclassed
as they fell before the home club 70
to 14.
The Indian swimmers never fin
ished out of the running as they
racked up firsts and seconds in sev
en of the 10 events and grabbed
thirds in the rest.
MORI WINS
Due to the one-sidedness of the I
competition there were few impres- j
sive times turned in, but Phil Gay's !
23.1 clocking in the 50-yard free
style and Kapsuichi Mori 's 222.4
points in the fancy dives are worthy
of mention. The little diver repeat- ;
edly impressed the crowds with his j
repertoire of twists and turns, and j
left little doubt in the minds of the J
visitors of why he was selected to |
represent Japan in the Olympics
three years ago at Helsinki.
Stanford's big trio, Gay, Larry
Heim, and John Weiser, all came j
through in their respective events as !
expected. Heim swam middle man
in the winning 300-yard medley re
lay team -and then went on to take j
the 100-yard freestyle in 52.7 sec
onds. After Gay captured the 50, he
came to spark the winning final
relay. Weiser took the 150-yard in
dividual medley and placed second
in the 200-yard backstroke to garner
his eight points.
By winning, the Cards kept their
home winning streak intact. The
next squad to attempt to do what no
team has succeeded in doing for the
last five years will be the Trojans
from Southern Cal, who take on the j
Indians next Friday at 3:30.
