Track stars Keith Brownsberger
and Walt Garrett were elected to
lead the Stanford cindermen for
the 1955 season at a team dinner
held last Friday night. Browns
berger, a senior from La Verne,
has been acclaimed as one of the
Tribe's best dash men ever. In the
100- and 220-yard dashes, he has
recorded times of :09.7 and:21.1
this spring. Garrett, who is also a
senior and hails from Whit tier, is
undefeated in 440 competition this
season and has been clocked in
:47.7 for the distance.
