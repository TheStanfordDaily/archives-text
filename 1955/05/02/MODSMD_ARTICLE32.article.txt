###

tion with the first spring practice
scrimmage of the season, which was
held Saturday morning.
"Needless to say, we're not exact
ly ready to meet Ohio State or
Michigan State yet," he said, "but
considering it was our first contact,
I was pleased with the performance."

horses, and such. Two players were
hurt more seriously—freshman cen

twisted knee, and tackle Chris Mar
shall suffered a broken finger.

fullback Jim Bryer, quarterbacks
Jack Douglas and Jack Lewis, half
