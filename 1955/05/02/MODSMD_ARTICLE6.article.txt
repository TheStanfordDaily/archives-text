### 
SAIGON, Indochina — American
backed Premier Ngo Dingh Diem
won control of-Free Viet Nam's
army today and sent absentee Em
porer Bao Dai's commanding general
fleeing to the hills in defeat.
In the. wake of the premier's ap
parent victory, Bao Dai himself
backed down and said he was not
hostile to Diem. He said the pre
mier's enemies were "extremist mi
norities blinded by passion."
Diem nipped an attempted coup
by General Nguyen Van Vy, Bao
Dai's choice as army commander
in-chief, in a day of sensational ma
neuvering that saw the premier
come out on top—at least for the
moment.
