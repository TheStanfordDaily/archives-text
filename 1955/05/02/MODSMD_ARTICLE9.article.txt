# 86-44
## Trackmen Win, Break 2 Records 
### BOB DURAND 
Breaking two meet records
and tying another, Stanford's
track forces quelled an early
splurge by upset-minded San
Jose State and then methodically
proceeded to crush the Spartans,
86 V2 to 44 V2 on the loser's field
Saturday.
Displaying a surprising amount of
strength and depth in almost all of
the events, the Tribe quickly dis
pelled any hopes of the home team
for an upset. In all, 13 Indians sur
passed their best-ever marks to help
their squad gain its first win since
March 26.
When "asked how he felt after the

TWO NEW MARKS
Setting the two new marks for the
Indians were co-captains Walt Gar

two seniors received their honorable
titles at an election Friday night.
Garrett set a blazing pace in the
440-yard run and finished in a time
of :47.7 which erased the old mark
of :48.3 set by Slate's Walt Burnett
in 1952 and the field record of :48.2
formerly held by Fresno State's Les
Laing.
Brownsberger, after taking a first
in the 100-yard dash, literally stun
ned the crowd with his performance
in the 220. The blond speedster
broke the tape in 21.1, four-tenths
of a second under the old standard
set by the Spartans' Bob Bingham
in 1947.
Card sophomore Bernie Nelson
tied the meet record in the 120-yard
high hurdles as he sped to victory
in :14.5. The home team's Ed Krey
enhagen led for* most of the race but
stumbled after the last hurdle, a fac
tor which might have made the win-
