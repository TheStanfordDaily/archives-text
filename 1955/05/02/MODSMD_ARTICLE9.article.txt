# 86-44
## Trackmen Win, Break 2 Records 
### BOB DURAND 
Breaking two meet records
and tying another, Stanford's
track forces quelled an early
splurge by upset-minded San
Jose State and then methodically
proceeded to crush the Spartans,
86 V2 to 44 V2 on the loser's field
Saturday.
Displaying a surprising amount of
strength and depth in almost all of
the events, the Tribe quickly dis
pelled any hopes of the home team
for an upset. In all, 13 Indians sur
passed their best-ever marks to help
their squad gain its first win since
March 26.
When "asked how he felt after the
meet, Card coach Jack Weiershau
ser answered with a gleam in his eye
and a big smile, "Very good!" His
cindermen face California next
week, and the Spartans earlier
whipped the Bears by many points.
TWO NEW MARKS
Setting the two new marks for the
Indians were co-captains Walt Gar
rett and Keith Brownsberger. The
two seniors received their honorable
titles at an election Friday night.
Garrett set a blazing pace in the
440-yard run and finished in a time
of :47.7 which erased the old mark
of :48.3 set by Slate's Walt Burnett
in 1952 and the field record of :48.2
formerly held by Fresno State's Les
Laing.
Brownsberger, after taking a first
in the 100-yard dash, literally stun
ned the crowd with his performance
in the 220. The blond speedster
broke the tape in 21.1, four-tenths
of a second under the old standard
set by the Spartans' Bob Bingham
in 1947.
Card sophomore Bernie Nelson
tied the meet record in the 120-yard
high hurdles as he sped to victory
in :14.5. The home team's Ed Krey
enhagen led for* most of the race but
stumbled after the last hurdle, a fac
tor which might have made the win-
ning time even faster.
MAItAMONTE WINS
The Golden raiders also got into
the record-breaking act when their
low hurdler .Miek Maramonte, cap
tured that event with a clocking of
23.3 to smash former Tribe star Gay
Bryan's mark of :23.8, set in .1948.
Lynne Greene provided the home
team with its second meet record of
the day when he tossed the javelin
228-6, which exceeded former Tribe
star Bud Held's mark ol 227-5 1 •>.
Held on Spartan Field in San Jose,
the meet took place under clouds
which threatened to drcnch the field
at any time during the afternoon. A
few sprinkles did occur but were
not enough to deter the two squads.
The State thinclads had their brief
moment of glory in the early events
after their soph star Billy Jo Wright
put the shot a foot farther than he
ever had before to win that event.

and their top miler, Don Hubbard,
put on a last finishing spring to gain
an upset triumph over Stanford's
Chuck Strong and Wil King.
EASTER SURPRISES
However, in the next race, the
Staters' backs were broken. Garrett
won the 440 as expected, but Tribe
sophomore Jim Eastsr became the
first Card surprise of the day by
crossing the finish line second with
a time of :49.2, his best ever.
From then on it was a matter of
time before the Tribe had clinched
the meet. 'Coach Weiershauser's
warriors proceeded to sweep the
high jump, broad jump, and 880, and
to gain a one-two position in 100 and
220.
San Jose was only able to domi
nate two other events — the pole
vault and low hurdles. Tribe vault
er Bill Flint, who has cleared 13-8
this spring, could not even reach 13.
and the winning height was shared
by two Spartans at 13-6.
Among other Indian best - ever
performances were a 24-foot broad
jump by Frank Herrmann, a 149-6 1/ 4
discus twirl by Jim Truher, and a
1:58.1 880' time by Ford Sims, all
winning efforts.
The Tribe achieved what has been
a rarity around these parts lately in
the 880. Sims led teammates Joe
Woolett and Bill Carls to a dean
sweep while achieving his good time
of 1:58.1.
Strong, who gave Stanford fans a
big thrill in the Occidental meet
with his finishing victory drive in
the two-mile, was forced to drop out
of the event on the third lap by a
coughing spell after taking a com
manding lead.
However, his talented teammate,

King, took over where he left off
and crossed the finish line with a
mark of 9:44.5 to his credit. Indian
Ralph Love turned on the speed to
finish third and gain his first point
of the season.
Love was falling rapidly behind
until Strong dropped out and then
began pulling upto beat Spartan Don
Berry for the third position. The
Card distance runner gave the spec
tators a laugh when he riped off his
jersey on the sixth lap, apparently
to help him run easier.
Coach Weiershauser used what
was virtually a second-string quar
tet in the mile relay and still won
the event handily. Nelson, Bob
Hyde, Easter, and Brownsberger all
turned in good laps to give the Tribe
victory in 3:20.5.
