# Lois Moran Recalls Lead Role in 'Of Thee I Sing'
## 
### PHYLLIS FERGUSON 
During the 1930'5, "Of Thee I Sing,'' the Ram's Head Spring
Show, played on Broadway and was the first musical comedy to
receive the Pulitzer Prize. The leading lady was Lois Moran, a
charming 21-year-old actress who had already been in show busi
ness for nine years.
In the Ram's Head production Carolyn Cowan will portray Mary

Turner, which was Miss Moran's
' role.
The show was Miss Moran's first
musical comedy. It ran two years,
and she wore out three bridal gowns
during the wedding scene. "But I
never got tired of playing it," she
said. "The music always gave me a
| lift."
The vivacious Miss Moran (now
Mrs. Clarence Younger) is only
; about 5 foot 2 with a deep stage
voice and a twinkle in her eyes when
she talks about the theater. She
now lives in Atherton and is "anx
[ ious to see the Stanford production."
I"It will be interesting to see a new
cast and the changes made since I
played the show," she said.
ORIGINAL PRODUCTION
â–  With a little smile of reminiscence,
Miss Moran told of some incidents
i during the original production.
I There were always colds running
: through the whole company during

! winter in New York, she said. "I
j remember one time when I had a
terrible cold. As I made my entrance
down the stairs in the wedding scene,
I opened my mouth to sing and not
a word would come out. Two big
tears started down my cheeks when
suddenly Billy Baxton, the original
John P. Wintergreen, started sing
ing my part. So . . . from then on
we just started passing the parts
around according to who had colds."
She also told about a scene in the
; show where Billy Gaxton and Victor
| Moore, the original Throttle bottom,
tossed jokes back and forth. "It was
I only an eight-minute scene," she

said, "but by the time the show had
been running a year, it went on for a
half-hour. It was a wonderful scene,
but finally George Kaufman, author
and director, had to stop them be
cause the show ran so late."
EARLY LIFE
By the time she was 11, Miss j
Moran had made up her mind to be
an actress, and when she was 12 she
went backstage at the Paris Opera |
and asked the Maitre de Ballet to
teach her to dance.
The astonished lady agreed, and ,
after six months of training Miss 1
Moran became a member of the j
Paris Ballet. Her mother insisted
that she finish high school, however,
so she finished her studies under
tutors while dancing five hours a
day.
She passed the college entrance
exams when she was 14 and threw
herself whole-heartedly into her ca
reer. "I just couldn't wait to get i
started," she said.
She didn't have to wait long.
Soon she landed the lead in a French
movie, persuading the producer she
would look older on the screen.
When Miss Moran was 15, she met
Samuel Goldwyn in Paris, and he
asked her to come back to the United
States and play Laurel in the movie
"Stella Dallas." The movie was a big
success and she stayed with films for
five years.
STAGE CAREER
But she always wanted to go on
the stage. She got her chance in
1930 when she was offered the lead
in Robert Sherwood's "This is New
York." After Sherwood's play, she
began "Of Thee I Sing" and fol- !
lowed it up with the sequel, "Let
'em Eat Cake." in which the presi
dent and his boys go on to form a |
dictatorship.
She has also appeared in Sher
wood's "Petrified Forest," the opera
"Bastian and Bastienne" for the San
Francisco Conservatory of Music, and ;
"Twelfth Night" in the Greek The
ater in Berkeley.
At Stanford, she played the lead
in "Biography" and Athena in the
"Orestia" for the Stanford Players.
PRESENT LIFE
During the war she channeled her
talents into voluntary war work in
San. Francisco. There she served as
chairman of the speakers bureau for
the Red Cross and chairman of the
entertainment committee at the
Stage Door Canteen. She now
teaches dance therapy at the Veter
ans Hospital six days a week.
Although- her present role is
mainly that of wife and mother, she
still finds time to do a Friday night
TV show, "Waterfront," a family ad
venture story in which she plays the
wife of a tugboat captain.
The Stanford "Of It:s6 T Sing"
cast will find Lois Moran an inter
ested and appreciative supporter
during the show's run.
