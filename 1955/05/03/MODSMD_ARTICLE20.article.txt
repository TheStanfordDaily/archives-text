### 
The voters of Palo Alto will <jo
to the polls May 10 to cast tic it
approval or disapproval for a $4
million hospital bond which
would pave the way for a joint
development program between
Stanford and the city.
The unified hospital plan would
be established on the campus and
would include a new Palo Alto Hos
pital, the Stanford Medical School,
and a teaching hospital.
Administrative officials of the city
and Stanford have agreed on flic
basic details for joint operation ac
cording to City Manager Jerry
Keithley.
Among the more pertinent points
are:
1. Joint use of such facilities a ,
kitchen, laundry, and utilities.
2. Stanford and Palo Alto will
build and control its own main fa
cilities.
3. Operational costs of joint facili â€¢
ties will be prorated in accordance
with established cost accounting
procedures.
4. Palo Alto's representation on
the hospital governing board will be
increased if Stanford continues the
management, and Palo Alto will re
tain its right to take over complete
management if it wishes.
5. Palo Alto staff doctors will con
tinue to control private practice in
the city hospital just as they do
now.
6. The Stanford faculty will have
its own staff organization. There
will be some integration between
staffs when "mutually agreeable."
7. Stanford will lease 25 acres on
nominal terms similar to those now
in effect for the present hospital
Keithley stated that the city could
probably rent the land at $1,000 a
year.
A year ago Palo Alto voters passed
a $4 million bond issue which pin
pointed funds for a new hospital or
expansion of the present plant. The
City Council decided to go in with
Stanford on a co-operative effort.
They cannot go ahead on the proj -
ect with the original bond authori
zation because of its wording.
'A favorable vote in May and the
approval of Stanford's Board of
Trustees are needed before the
plans become final.
