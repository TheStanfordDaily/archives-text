Ki:tie bits of nothingâ€”The Residence Halls
Committee at Columbia University has rejected
. hk'o plan to admit women to men's dormitory
r, ;;n:j during established afternoon hours. Ac
cooiing to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the
officials decided that the proposal offered no
7/1:~j of keeping "undesirables" out. .. .
Apparently spring is an event at Alliance
< ' vlltHje in Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania.
Tlf college paper, the Hilltopper, greeted it
with four pink pages and an arlicle by "Aunt
Jenny" entitled "Spring's A-comin' .
"In spring, a young man's fancy lightly turns
I-. thoughts of love," but the Washington Paily
linhtly turns to thoughts of a bridal edition.
The paper learned aiticles on the latest styles
in wedding gowns, on plans for a "perfect"
honeymoon, and "checklists" for both the bride
and the groom. . . .
According to the Colorado Daily, the Uni
versity of Colorado will have a "late night for
( haiity." Women, there, may purchase a 1 a.m.
lo "koi.it for a penny a minute or a 2:30 a.m. lock
out lor $1. Otherwise, 'he ladies are required
t Eft in by 12 p.m. . . .
A 1.50, at the University of Colorado, a new
in-?, called opt*, was given approval by
the University Board of Publications. The Colo
i.ido Daily reported that the magazine will give
an "on let for serious student writing" and will
E published on a quarterly basis. . . .
The Daily Texan has corne to the conclusion
that the political campaigns for student body

officers at the University of Texas are getting
rough. A girl who was handing out cards for
one of the candidates handed one .o a "gentle
man" passing by. He bit her hand. . . .
It must be warmer in Texas. The Daily Texan
carried an article recently, giving advice to
students who were beginning the "water-ski
ing season." Among the rules they offered
was "ski away from fish or carry fish nets." . . .
But it isn't warm at San Jose Lltate. The col
lege paper, the Spartan Daily, gives its weather
reports as though they were being spoken by
everything ranging from a pigeon to a sand
flea. And the most recent paper stated, "The
sand flea said his horoscope said he could
ca'.cli cold ioday." . . .
The Rocky Mountain Collegian reported in
its last issue that although 79 per cent of the
men and 49 per cent of the women, in a lecent
college poll, did not like Bermuda shorts on
anyone, 35 per cent of the men .and 55 per
cent of the women thought they would become
very popular. . . .
Students at the University of Washington be
came quite upset recently when someone stole
all the copies of the Washington Daily from
theii various elands on campus. According io
the Daily, irate calls began corning in from
students who wanted to know what had hap
pened.
All the paper could say was "well, the cir
culation department swears that they were de
livered and it's nice lo know somebody reads
the Daily, occasionally."
