Here on the Farm we have almost every size,
r;li. Ps, and variety of dog and every one of
tli'-m is my buddy. Formerly this was my only
solace in a rather rugged life. At least little kids
and dogs liked me. But the dogs' friendship is
fifitlmg out of hand.
Thi; c her a.m. while strolling to class the
usual contingent of four-footed creatures greet
ed rne in their usual four-footed way. All lour
i"i ! on my somewhat battered body.
That part of the usual dog greeting routine
is line. I've even got used to wearing clothes
:;hredded by the claws of friendly mutts. It's
arj )od deal, ffe Ip 3 with the Scholarship Com
mittee, too. Students with torn clothes hit 'em
where it hur:s.
However, man's best friends are doin' rne
wron'.j. A greeting each morn is not enough to
satisfy tham. Now they insist 011 accompany
ing me to class.
This part is poor. For sundry reasons. They
don't know when to laugh at the prof's jokes.
Bring completely natural creatures, the dogs
don't affect airs and are prone to laugh at the
o Idest moments. They even yawn when a lec

ture strikes them as boring. Of course, that's
only their opinion. I've never heard a boring
leclure, have you?
And did you ever hear a dog laugh? Some
sound. I think it's mor.e properly termed a
bark. Noisy.
And they are friendly. Too friendly. They
sense the pain it is to take notes and in their
best doggie mariner try to keep their student
buddies away from this nerve-wracking chore.
The dog's methods are clever.
They play a game called "grab the pen and
run." When the going really gets rough they
play another variation which runs something
like, "You take the top of the prof's lecture
notes firmly in mouth, I'll take the bot'om and
we'll go 011 our own merry, but opposite,
ways." The results are disastrous, but it's a
sure way to end a lecture that's begun to drag.
What all these antics are leading me to is
the tubes. Right down 'em. Since the doggies
are my friends (in fact, my only friends except
for the kiddies), profs are beginning to think
it's me who's putting them up to the tricks.
But, professor, can I help it if they're man's
best friends?
