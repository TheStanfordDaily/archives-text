# Seniors Urged To Register For Placement
## 
### BARBARA NICHOLS 
All graduating seniors have
been requested to register with
the Placement Service as soon
as possible, according to Eu
gene Dils, director of the Place
ment Service. Seniors should I
register in spite of draft status
and future job possibilities.
The purpose of registration is to
| establish a permanent record for
future reference on the part of the
! student or a prospective employer.
Another reason for immediate
registration is that professors and
staff members can make statements
about the student while they are
most familiar with him. If registra
tion is left until after the student
leaves school, the staff members
might not remember important facts
about him.
TWO PARTS
Registration is urged for those go
ing into the service. Then the stu
dent will have some references that
he can use when he seeks a position
after leaving the service.
This registration consists of two
parts. The first is the filing, for the |
permanent records, of a summary of L
education experiences, extra-curric
ular activities, and work experiences j
at Stanford which have vocational
significance.
The second part of the procedure
is obtaining forms to be filled out by
two or three members of the Uni
j versity faculty or staff or former
J employees who are well acquainted
! with the registering student. The
staff members or employers asked to
j fill out these forms give their opin
ion of the student, his personality
qualities, and work performance.
FORMS AVAILABLE
All of these forms may be ob- j
tained from the receptionist at the j
Placement Service.
These forms will be a permanent i
( record on file at the Placement;
Service. They may be used at any
[ time and as often as desired by the
student applying for work.
The fact that men going into the
service should register was stressed
by Dils. He Â£aid that employers in
terview the men and often, if the
j induction date is not immediate, the j
student is hired to work as long as
! he can.
