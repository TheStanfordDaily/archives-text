### 
BERLINâ€”AIIied authorities today
proposed a meeting with the Soviets
here Saturday to discuss East Ger
many's "purse-string blockade" of
West Berlin.
The United States, French, and
British High Commissioners sent
identical notes to Soviet High Com
missioner G. M. Pushkin. At issue
is the increased highway tolls im
posed on trucks carrying supplies to
the Allied sector .
The notes were in answer to one
from Pushkin in which he agreed to
a conference but said he considered
the tolls a topic for direct negotia
tions between West and East Ger
many.
The West replied that it could
"not accept that this matter ... is
solely within the responsibility of
East German authorities.
