# Three Frosh Are Given Probation
## 
### 
Men's Cotincil gave three fresh
men probation and 10 Con Home
hours each for lying to avoid ap
pearing before a subordinate judi
cial council and failing to co-oper
ate with sponsors.
The three had been scheduled to
appear before the subordinate
council for quiet hours violations,
but had notified their head sponsor
that they would plead guilty and
asked to be excused from the coun
cil meeting. They said that they had
to attend a seminar.
The head sponsor discovered later
that the three had lied and had
never been enrolled in the seminar.
He referred the case to Men's Coun
cil.
Keith Brownsberger, chairman of
Men's Council, warned the three
that probation means that any other
offense, however small, that they
commit this quarter will be brought
to the attention of Men's Council
and will probably result in suspen
sion.
