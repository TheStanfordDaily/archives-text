# 'Of The I Sing' Features Stylized Sets, Direction
## 'Experimental' Treatment Modernizes 1930's Musical 
### PHYLLIS FERGUSON 
Out of time, out of reality, modern, stylized sets, direction, rind
music lift "Of Thee I Sing" out of the '30's into the frenzied po
litical arena of today.
This stylized production is the creation of Warner Leßoy,
director of the Ram's Head Spring Show. Leßoy pointed out tho

difficulties of presenting an older
musical comedy, no matter how ex
cellent the script and music. "I
wanted to do an experimental show
and knew I could take 'Of Thee I
Sing' and stylize it," Leßoy said.
Stylize means that the show has
no flat sets as do most similar pro
ductions. The set for the hotel room
is only a skeletonized framework.
Sets are placed on angles, out of
perspective and out of proportion,
giving an air of fantasy to the stage.
Sets were designed by Kirk Mc-
Nulty and Bill Davis. They include
Madison Square Garden, the United
States Senate, and the White House
steps, scene of the ''inaugural wed
ding."
THE JUG'
The White House set has been
nicknamed "The Jug," short for
Juggernaut, because it is extraordi
narily big. It is the largest ever to
be built at Stanford and covers the
greater part of the stage. The set
supports nearly 50 members of the
cast during the finale to Act One.
Brilliant and unrealistic colors of
chartreuse, shocking pink, and
bright green touch off unusual cos-

tumes. In line with the modern ver
sion of the script, a mambo beat
j modernizes one number in the show.
No blaekouts interrupt any part
of the show. All shifting of scenes
is done in front of the audience, and
! the furniture is moved by a man in
i a tuxedo.
To add a finishing touch to the
stylized performance, much of the
show is played directly to the audi
ence. Characters often step forward
and deliver their lines across the
footlights.
HI(ill STANDARD'
Leßoy set a high standard when
he chose "Of Thee I Sing." "1 work
on the theory that Rani's Head's first
obligation is to their audience and
the most important thing is to put
on a good show." he said.
Leßoy is a junior and directed the
1953 Gaieties and last year's Spring
Show. "Anything Goes." He is the
first student to direct three shows
at Stanford.

Spring Show, "Of Thee I Sins,"

WINTERGREEN FOR PRESIDENT—Chairman of the National Party Committee (Hart Sprager)
addresses the crowd in Madison Square Garden and ardently praises the ticket of love. Look
ing on are Mary Turner (Carolyn Cowan) and Bert Berns (John P. Wintergreen). The scene is from
"Of Thee I Sing" which will open tomorrow night in Memorial Auditorium.
Out of time, out of reality, modern, stylized sets, direction, rind
music lift "Of Thee I Sing" out of the '30's into the frenzied po
litical arena of today.
This stylized production is the creation of Warner Leßoy,
director of the Ram's Head Spring Show. Leßoy pointed out tho

difficulties of presenting an older
musical comedy, no matter how ex
cellent the script and music. "I
wanted to do an experimental show
and knew I could take 'Of Thee I
Sing' and stylize it," Leßoy said.
Stylize means that the show has
no flat sets as do most similar pro
ductions. The set for the hotel room
is only a skeletonized framework.
Sets are placed on angles, out of
perspective and out of proportion,
giving an air of fantasy to the stage.
Sets were designed by Kirk Mc-
Nulty and Bill Davis. They include
Madison Square Garden, the United
States Senate, and the White House
steps, scene of the ''inaugural wed
ding."
THE JUG'
The White House set has been
nicknamed "The Jug," short for
Juggernaut, because it is extraordi
narily big. It is the largest ever to
be built at Stanford and covers the
greater part of the stage. The set
supports nearly 50 members of the
cast during the finale to Act One.
Brilliant and unrealistic colors of
chartreuse, shocking pink, and
bright green touch off unusual cos-

tumes. In line with the modern ver
sion of the script, a mambo beat
j modernizes one number in the show.
No blaekouts interrupt any part
of the show. All shifting of scenes
is done in front of the audience, and
! the furniture is moved by a man in
i a tuxedo.
To add a finishing touch to the
stylized performance, much of the
show is played directly to the audi
ence. Characters often step forward
and deliver their lines across the
footlights.
HI(ill STANDARD'
Leßoy set a high standard when
he chose "Of Thee I Sing." "1 work
on the theory that Rani's Head's first
obligation is to their audience and
the most important thing is to put
on a good show." he said.
Leßoy is a junior and directed the
1953 Gaieties and last year's Spring
Show. "Anything Goes." He is the
first student to direct three shows
at Stanford.

Tickets for the Ram's Head
Spring Show, "Of Thee I Sins,"
will be on sale at Engineering

Auditorium box office until Fri
day. The box office is open from
