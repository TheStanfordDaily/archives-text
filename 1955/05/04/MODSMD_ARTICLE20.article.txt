miliar, but the name . . .
The same fifteen student representatives
who adjourned the Executive Committee a
week ago will convene the brand new Legis
lature of the Associated Students tonight at 7:30
iu what will probably always be called the Ex
com room, Student Union. When President
Wallace Sterling gave final approval to the new
ASSU constitution a few days ago, he took one
handy term out of the Stanford vocabulary. But
while campus linguists and headline writers
search for an "Excom"-like abbreviation for
"Legislature," the new representative branch
of student government will carry on tonight.
Reporting on preparations for the election
which will cjiye the Legislature a few of the
regular representatives the constitution allots''
it, Eric Fricker will speak at the Legislature to
night. Representatives elected two weeks from
now in the ASSU final elections will take office
next fall, with members of the old Excom sitting
on the Legislature until the expiration of their
original terms.

One of the most interesting topics of discus
which Legislature will handle is the report of
the Union Planning Committee, which has com
pleted a detailed study of reguirements and
problems of the proposed Tresidder Memorial
Student Union. Legislature will review the
study and decide whether to forward it directly
to the administration or to work over it longer
in the full group. This is to be a facility for the
whole student body, and tonight's meeting will
be another good chance for interested students
to make suggestions and comments.
Liz Livadary will report on progress of her
Student-Faculty Committee which has been
working guietly and well toward freer and
more informal relations between students and
faculty. Informal meetings between students
and faculty have keynoted the committeee's
program.
By-law changes for organizations will occupy
much discussion time tonight, although Presi
dent Pete Bing foresees "an easy meeting" at
the first gathering of Stanford's new Legisla
ture,
