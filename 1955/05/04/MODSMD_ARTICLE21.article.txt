We are raising a generation of friendless kid
dies.
The sociologists say so and I say so. And
you should say so too.
And what is causing this mass of unfriendly
children in our midst?
TV. TV, formerly the scourge of radio, now
the scourge of our youth.
A recent survey shows that because of the
very nature of TV, being home entertainment,
the li'l tots don't get out and live it up with
their playmates like in the good old days.
l! was fine when only one kid in the neigh
borhood had a TV-equipped home and the
whole gang of little monsters could meet there
for the latsst of Space Patrol or whatever. Of
course some of the geniuses among the iots
liked to charge admissions to these get-togeth
ers. This may have cut down friendships some,
but not to the extent that TV is presently do
ing.
Fcr now all the kiddies are on their own and
fast losing friends. No more neighborhood

gangs, no more deadly assaults on your home
by a crew of "innocent" little fun-makers.
That's bad?

On hearing that Harry Truman's portrait had
been moved from the White House foyer, Mrs.
Truman said it's "pretty funny, that's all." Mov
ing of the portrait broke a tradition that had
lasted for "longer than I can remember," ac
cording to Mrs. Truman. The tradition was to
hang portraits of the preceding two Presidents
in the foyer.
But since Ike is a Republican and FDR and
Harry are . . . Well, pictures of Abraham Lin
coln and George Washington are now hanging
in the foyer.
