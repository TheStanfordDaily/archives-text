THE GREAT CAP and GOWN CONTROVERSY
The cup and gown season is upon us, and with it comes the
perennial question: which side of the cap should the tassel
hang on?
This is an argument that arises every year to roil the aca
demic world, and it is, alas, no closer to solution today than it
was in IGO4 when Fred Tassel invented the troublesome orna
ment.
Fred Tassel, incidentally, never made a penny from His inven
tion. The sad fact is he never took out a patent on it. This tragic
oversight becomes understandable, however, when one considers
that patents were not invented till 1851 by Fred Patent, himself
a pitiable figure. A compulsive handwasher, he died in his four
teenth year, leaving behind a wife and five spotless children.
But I digress. We were discussing which side of the cap the
tassel should hang on.
For many years the universally accepted practice was to hang
the tassel over'the front of the cap. This practice was abandoned
in 1942 when the entire graduating class of Northwestern Uni
versity, blinded by tassels hanging in their eyes, made a wrong
turn during commencement exercises and ended up at the Great
Lakes Training Center where, all unwitting, they were inducted
into the Navy for five year hitches.
There is one school of thought-large and growing daily larger
-which holds that the tassel should be worn on the same side
you carry your Philip Morris cigarettes. Thus a quick glance
will show you where your Philip Morris are and save much time
and fumbling.
This makes a good deal of sense because when one wants a
Philip Morris, one wants one with a minimum of delay. One does
not relish being kept, even for a second, from the clean, delicate
flavor of Philip Morris, so artfully blended, so subtly concocted
to please the keen and alert taste buds of young smokers. One
chafes at any obstacle, however small, that is put in the way of
enjoying this most edifying of cigarettes, so pleasing to the
perceptive palate. Here, in king size or regular, at prices that
do no violence to the slimmest of budgets, is a firm white cylinder
of balm and pure, abiding content.
There is another group, small but vocal, that insists the tassel
should hang over the back of the cap. The tassel, they say, is a
symbol like the bullfighter's pigtail, signifying honor and
courage.
They are wrong. Bullfighters wear pigtails for only one rea
son: to keep the backs of their necks warm. Do you have any
idea what a draft a bull makes when he rushes past you ! A
plenty big one, you may be sure.
In fact, upper respiratory infections, contracted in the wake of
passing bulls, are the largest single cause of bullring fatalities.
I have this interesting statistic from the Bullfighters Mutual
Life Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut, one of the
few insurance companies in Hartford, Connecticut, which writes
insurance exclusively for bullfighters. Incidentally, Hartford,
J he insurance capital of America, is a most interesting city and
well worth a visit if you are ever in New England, as north
eastern United States is, for some reason, called. Hartford can
be reached by bus, train, plane, and the Humboldt Current. Try
to make your visit in spring, when the actuaries are in bloom.
But 1 digress. We were talking about what side to wear the
tassel on. An ingenious solution to this troubling problem was
proposed a few years ago by Fred Sigafoos, perhaps better known
as "The Quoit King of Delaware." An early forbear ol Mr.
Sigafoos, Humboldt Sigafoos (who later invented the current
which bears his name ) was granted a monopoly by King George
111 on all quoits manufactured in Delaware. Somehow the royal
appointment was never rescinded and from that day to this,
every quoit made in Delaware has been a Sigafoos Quoit.
Well, sir, Fred Sigafoos once suggested that an equitable
settlement to the great tassel controversy would be to .starch
the tassels so they stood upright and hung on no side of the cap
at all. Mr. Sigafoos was, of course, only seeking to broaden his
market, because after graduation, what can you do with an
upright tassel but hurl quoits at it? al ,

This makes a good deal of sense because when one wants a
Philip Morris, one wants one with a minimum of delay. One does
not relish being kept, even for a second, from the clean, delicate
flavor of Philip Morris, so artfully blended, so subtly concocted
to please the keen and alert taste buds of young smokers. One

There is another group, small but vocal, that insists the tassel
should hang over the back of the cap. The tassel, they say, is a
symbol like the bullfighter's pigtail, signifying honor and
courage.
They are wrong. Bullfighters wear pigtails for only one rea
son: to keep the backs of their necks warm. Do you have any
idea what a draft a bull makes when he rushes past you ! A
plenty big one, you may be sure.
In fact, upper respiratory infections, contracted in the wake of
passing bulls, are the largest single cause of bullring fatalities.
I have this interesting statistic from the Bullfighters Mutual
Life Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut, one of the
few insurance companies in Hartford, Connecticut, which writes
insurance exclusively for bullfighters. Incidentally, Hartford,
J he insurance capital of America, is a most interesting city and
well worth a visit if you are ever in New England, as north
eastern United States is, for some reason, called. Hartford can
be reached by bus, train, plane, and the Humboldt Current. Try
to make your visit in spring, when the actuaries are in bloom.
But 1 digress. We were talking about what side to wear the
tassel on. An ingenious solution to this troubling problem was
proposed a few years ago by Fred Sigafoos, perhaps better known
as "The Quoit King of Delaware." An early forbear ol Mr.
Sigafoos, Humboldt Sigafoos (who later invented the current
which bears his name ) was granted a monopoly by King George
111 on all quoits manufactured in Delaware. Somehow the royal
appointment was never rescinded and from that day to this,
every quoit made in Delaware has been a Sigafoos Quoit.
Well, sir, Fred Sigafoos once suggested that an equitable
settlement to the great tassel controversy would be to .starch
the tassels so they stood upright and hung on no side of the cap
at all. Mr. Sigafoos was, of course, only seeking to broaden his
market, because after graduation, what can you do with an
upright tassel but hurl quoits at it? al ,

THE GREAT CAP and GOWN CONTROVERSY
The cup and gown season is upon us, and with it comes the
perennial question: which side of the cap should the tassel
hang on?
This is an argument that arises every year to roil the aca
demic world, and it is, alas, no closer to solution today than it
was in IGO4 when Fred Tassel invented the troublesome orna
ment.
Fred Tassel, incidentally, never made a penny from His inven
tion. The sad fact is he never took out a patent on it. This tragic
oversight becomes understandable, however, when one considers
that patents were not invented till 1851 by Fred Patent, himself
a pitiable figure. A compulsive handwasher, he died in his four
teenth year, leaving behind a wife and five spotless children.
But I digress. We were discussing which side of the cap the
tassel should hang on.
For many years the universally accepted practice was to hang
the tassel over'the front of the cap. This practice was abandoned
in 1942 when the entire graduating class of Northwestern Uni
versity, blinded by tassels hanging in their eyes, made a wrong
turn during commencement exercises and ended up at the Great
Lakes Training Center where, all unwitting, they were inducted
into the Navy for five year hitches.
There is one school of thought-large and growing daily larger
-which holds that the tassel should be worn on the same side
you carry your Philip Morris cigarettes. Thus a quick glance
will show you where your Philip Morris are and save much time
and fumbling.

insurance exclusively for bullfighters. Incidentally, Hartford,
J he insurance capital of America, is a most interesting city and
well worth a visit if you are ever in New England, as north
eastern United States is, for some reason, called. Hartford can
be reached by bus, train, plane, and the Humboldt Current. Try
to make your visit in spring, when the actuaries are in bloom.
But 1 digress. We were talking about what side to wear the
tassel on. An ingenious solution to this troubling problem was
proposed a few years ago by Fred Sigafoos, perhaps better known
as "The Quoit King of Delaware." An early forbear ol Mr.
Sigafoos, Humboldt Sigafoos (who later invented the current
which bears his name ) was granted a monopoly by King George
111 on all quoits manufactured in Delaware. Somehow the royal
appointment was never rescinded and from that day to this,
every quoit made in Delaware has been a Sigafoos Quoit.
Well, sir, Fred Sigafoos once suggested that an equitable
settlement to the great tassel controversy would be to .starch
the tassels so they stood upright and hung on no side of the cap
at all. Mr. Sigafoos was, of course, only seeking to broaden his
market, because after graduation, what can you do with an
upright tassel but hurl quoits at it? al ,
