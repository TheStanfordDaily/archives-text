# Bill Heil Retains CIBA Bat Lead
## 
### 
UCLA infielder Billy Heil retained his CIBA batting lead this
week as diamond activity reached a low ebb. The Bruins played
only one contest during the week, a losing one against Cal, with
Heil batting one for two to keep his .500 hitting mark.
Stanford's Rudy Figueroa retained his .472 average as the Tribe
did not take to the field in a CIBA*

contest.
Tony Santino and Doc Mason fat
tened their averages at the expense
of Bronco pitching this week. The
Trojan duo, who are third and
fourth in loop action, are batting
. 4G9 and .407 respectively.
Figueroa, Indian third baseman, is
tied with Bruin Bill Mills for the
most base-hits in league play with
17 each. The slugging sophomore is
third in the runs-batted-in depart
ment with 11 in 10 games.
First baseman Kent Hadley of the
league-leading Trojans is pacing the
circuit in rbi's. The southpaw
swinging junior has banged in 15
runs. Heil of the Uclans trails him
with 12.
Mason, the left-handed outfielder
for the men of Troy, is on top of the
CIBA in home runs with three cir
cuit clouts. Card Rich Scramaglia,
Trojan Bill Faddis, and Bear Don
Nusser have each smashed two
four-base blows.

Of Heil's 15 hits, seven have been
for two bases. Five more diamond
aces, none of them from Stanford,
trail the leader with four doubles
apiece.
Card lead - off man and center
fielder Sid Hall is still leading the
loop with his five stolen bases. Cal's
Dick Anient. First Down Brown of
UCLA, and the Trojans' Faddis each
have pilfered four sacks.
Vic Lapiner. husky USC hurler, is
pacing the league in both won-lost
percentage and earned-run average.
Big Vic has scored four triumphs
without a setback and has allowed
only 1.98 earned runs per nine in
nings.
Sophomore Doug Weiss of Cal has
proved to be the work-horse of the
league. Weiss has a 4-1 mark and
has toiled 4(5 frames on the hill,
more than any other CIBA chucker.
Weiss is second behind Santa
Clara's Dick Simoni with 36 strike
outs. The Bronco ace has fanned 41.
but will probably miss action the
rest of the season because of inju
ries.
