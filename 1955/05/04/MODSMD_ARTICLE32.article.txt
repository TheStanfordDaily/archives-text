## FIVE-HITTER Sacramento State Nips Stanford in 1-0 Contest 
### BILL NICHOLS Sports Editor, The Daily 
J. C. Masters, a masterful righthander from Sacramento State,
pitched his teammates to a 1-0 victory over Stanford yesterday
afternoon at the Sunken Diamond. Masters allowed only five hits,
as did the two Stanford hurlers, Walt Payne, and Ed Verdurmen,
and he was in bad trouble only once.
The Hornets scored the game's only run in the third when John
Mazzei led off with a single to ccn-*

ter. Boh White forced Mazzei at
second, but moved to the keystone
sack when Masters grounded out.
Dick 01.-on then grounded a_ hall
fc .'tween first and second; Bob
Fletcher raced back and over to his
left and managed to get a glove on
the ball, but it kicked off into right
field and White was home free with
the only tally of the game.
Sam Pullaro followed with another
sharp single to right and Olson
headed for third, but Dick Workman
fielded the ball cleanly and let go
a one-bounce strike to Rudy Figue
10a to nip the flying Hornet on a
very close play.
SIX WHIFFS
Masters struck out six Cards,
while walking only four. Stanford
threatened in the third when two
walks and a bunt single by Sid Hall
loaded the bases, but Rich Scrama
glia forced Fletcher to end the rally.
From the third on to the final in
ning, it was a defensive battle with
several sparkling plays. The Hor
nets' Ron Hoy was on first with noi
outs in the fourth, but Hal Messner
dove for Ed Pegram's liner and fell
on first base for a double play to
cut # off that threat.
Rudy Figueroa led off the Cardi
nal fourth with a smash over the
right fielder's head, but was thrown
out on a beautiful relay trying to
stretch it into a triple. The follow
ing inning, Hall singled, stole sec
ond, and went to third on a wild
pitch, all with two out, but Fletcher
struck out to finish that frame.
BLOW BICi CHANCE
Bob Evans led ofT he Stanford half
of the seventh with a 480 - foot
triple, and Workman walked on a
full count, but the Indians still
could not score. Messner went out
pitcher to first for the first out, with
Workman taking .second. John Dito
pinch-hit for Payne, but lofted a
short fly to left and the runners had
to hold. Hall popped out to short to
end the abortive rally.
Again in the eighth Stanford lost
a golden opportunity to score. With
Mickey Holzman on second, Rudy
Figueroa's line drive was snared by
Sacramento's Atch Pedretti as he
leaped high into the air and caught
the ball on his finger tips.
Evans and Hall each collected two
hits in the Cards' losing effort while
Payne gave up just four hits in
seven innings before he gave way

to Ed Verdurmen, but Masters had
too much in the clutches. Dick Ol
son led the winners with two hits.
Sacramento .. 001 000 000—1 5 0
Stanford 000 000 000—0 5 .'5

J. C. Masters, a masterful righthander from Sacramento State,
pitched his teammates to a 1-0 victory over Stanford yesterday
afternoon at the Sunken Diamond. Masters allowed only five hits,
as did the two Stanford hurlers, Walt Payne, and Ed Verdurmen,
and he was in bad trouble only once.
The Hornets scored the game's only run in the third when John
Mazzei led off with a single to ccn-*

ter. Boh White forced Mazzei at
second, but moved to the keystone
sack when Masters grounded out.
Dick 01.-on then grounded a_ hall
fc .'tween first and second; Bob
Fletcher raced back and over to his
left and managed to get a glove on
the ball, but it kicked off into right
field and White was home free with
the only tally of the game.
Sam Pullaro followed with another
sharp single to right and Olson
headed for third, but Dick Workman
fielded the ball cleanly and let go
a one-bounce strike to Rudy Figue
10a to nip the flying Hornet on a
very close play.
SIX WHIFFS
Masters struck out six Cards,
while walking only four. Stanford
threatened in the third when two
walks and a bunt single by Sid Hall
loaded the bases, but Rich Scrama
glia forced Fletcher to end the rally.
From the third on to the final in
ning, it was a defensive battle with
several sparkling plays. The Hor
nets' Ron Hoy was on first with noi
outs in the fourth, but Hal Messner
dove for Ed Pegram's liner and fell
on first base for a double play to
cut # off that threat.
Rudy Figueroa led off the Cardi
nal fourth with a smash over the
right fielder's head, but was thrown
out on a beautiful relay trying to
stretch it into a triple. The follow
ing inning, Hall singled, stole sec
ond, and went to third on a wild
pitch, all with two out, but Fletcher
struck out to finish that frame.
BLOW BICi CHANCE
Bob Evans led ofT he Stanford half
of the seventh with a 480 - foot
triple, and Workman walked on a
full count, but the Indians still
could not score. Messner went out
pitcher to first for the first out, with
Workman taking .second. John Dito
pinch-hit for Payne, but lofted a
short fly to left and the runners had
to hold. Hall popped out to short to
end the abortive rally.
Again in the eighth Stanford lost
a golden opportunity to score. With
Mickey Holzman on second, Rudy
Figueroa's line drive was snared by
Sacramento's Atch Pedretti as he
leaped high into the air and caught
the ball on his finger tips.
Evans and Hall each collected two
hits in the Cards' losing effort while
Payne gave up just four hits in
seven innings before he gave way

to Ed Verdurmen, but Masters had
too much in the clutches. Dick Ol
son led the winners with two hits.
