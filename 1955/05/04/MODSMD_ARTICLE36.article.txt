# Frosh Tackle Bellarmine Hi
## 
### 
nming on a three-game winning j
streak, Stanford's freshman baseball I
team will host Bellarmine Prep to
day at 3:15 p.m. The Cleggmen have
toppled Sequoia, Richmond, and St.
Ignatius high schools since falling
before Cal's undefeated Cubs.
Left-hander Rick McElhenny and
right-hander George Avery are ex- i
pected to share the pitching chores I
against the Bells. Avery has been '
suffering with a sore back while the
Papoose portsider has been ham
pered by arm trouble. Both are ex
pected to be ready today, however, j
Infielder Bob Flanders has been
pacing the team with his explosive
bat lately. The Capuchino High
grad smacked out three hits in the
last contest to raise his average near j
the .500 matk.
The statement in yesterday's j
Daily that Papoose pitcher Bob
Schmidt is a former Bellarmine j
hurler was a mistake. Schmidt ,
played his high school ball in Bur
lingame.
