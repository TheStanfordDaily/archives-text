### 
WASHINGTON â€” The nation's j
Governors today opposed compul- i
sory U.S. controls on distribution of
the Salk polio vaccine. They spoke
out in favor of a voluntary system
directed by the government.
They made their views known at
the close of a two-day Governors'
conference here as pressure mount- )
ed in Congress for some kind of
compulsory control over allocation j
and distribution of the vaccine.
Several Governors criticized fed
eral health officials for not having j
any kind of distribution program
under way yet. They aired their
complaints after being briefed by
Mrs. Oveta Culp Hobby, Secretary
of Health, Education, and Welfare, i
and others.
