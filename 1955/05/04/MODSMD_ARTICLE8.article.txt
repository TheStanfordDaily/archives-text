"Random notes of an editor,"
was the way Boyd Schafer de
scribed his informal talk yester
day at Bowman Alumni House.
Schafer, managing editor of "The
American Historical Review,"
spoke on the publication and on
the field of history and historians
generally.
His magazine, a quarterly, pub
lishes reviews of historical books.
Schafer noted that his main duty
was to select the dozen or so books
reviewed yearly out of those sent
to "The Review" and then to choose
a man to review the book.
His office receives almost 1,100
books a year, and Schafer comment
ed this "wasn't all."
"The amount of historical produc
tion in the United States today is
great, really rather amazing," he
said.
Chief purpose of the reviews,
Schafer said, is their scholarship
value.
"Americans generally are quite
friendly in their reviews, more so
than Europeans," Schafer said, and
issued a call for a more "critical"
attitude in American reviews. By
critical he meant examining the
books more in the light of literary
work.
Schafer's "rules" for writing:
"1. Apply the seat of the pants to
the seat of the chair.
"2. Write every day.
"3. Read the world's great litera
ture often and in quantity."
The speaker noted that the field
for historians has been opened a
bit in recent years and said that sta
tisticians in his office say that the
field will need some 400 history
Ph.D.'s in 19(30 and 500 in 1970.
