# Civil Liberties Head Sees Future Problems In National Security
## Civil Servants' Discretionary Power Viewed as Trouble Spot 
### EDA MENDELS 
"Civil servants' discretionary power will be the most important
civil liberties problem of the next five years. I know of no other
arena where battles will be fought more within our lifetime."
Patrick Murphy Malin, director of the American Civil Liberties
Union, expressed this opinion last night in an address at the First

Methodist Church in Palo Alto. The
meeting, sponsored by the Northern
California ACLU, was attended by
some 150 people.
"Civil Liberties and National Se
curity in Britain and America" was
the title of the talk, in which Malin
compared the application of various
liberties and the comparative stages
of uneasiness about national secu
rity.
Malin established as fact that one
cannot run the complicated, modern
state without entrusting more dis
cretionary powers to government
employees. "But," he found, "we
need to hem in the bureaucrats.
They should not make the unalter
able and unreviewable decisions
about the people outside and lesser
employees of the government. This
is an arena for application of "due
process of law."

NATIONAL SECURITY

In regard to national security,
Malin remarked, ''Britain has been
living with chronic international
danger for centuries. She has
learped how to live in its midst
without panic. The Britons, in their ;
gradually created equilibrium, are
profoundly critical of us in our J
present spasm of international dan- !
ger."
"I don't know whether we're go
| ing to come through to an equilib
rium of equality before the law and j
the other civil liberties. To the ex
tent that we do come through, it will
take much more doing than the
British have had to put into it,"he
continued in his deliberate manner.
Academic freedom is greater in
' Britain, Malin said. One reason for j
this was that "the company of schol- :
ars there have taken their holy mo- I
nastic vows. Each individual schol- !
ar will go probing as far as he can j
in the mysteries of life, then make
| an honest report thereon."'
FEW INSTITUTIONS
The second reason for more aca
demic freedom is the fact that Brit
| ain has relatively few institutions at
the collegiate and university level,
and that most of these are private.
Since Britain has just begun to j
provide free public education, Brit- i
ish schools "have profited from the
neglect of the community in which
they were located, which felt little
i responsibility for the schools."
He contrasted this to the Ameri- j
| can system, where the schools are I
vital and a Tbone of contention in j
every community.
Before accepting the directorship j
of the ACLU, Malin had a varied
career including the positions of
professor of economics at Swarth
more, lay Quaker preacher, profes
sional YMCA worker, and govern
-1 ment refugee worker.

present spasm of international dan- !

"I don't know whether we're go
| ing to come through to an equilib
rium of equality before the law and j
the other civil liberties. To the ex
tent that we do come through, it will
take much more doing than the
British have had to put into it,"he
continued in his deliberate manner.
Academic freedom is greater in
' Britain, Malin said. One reason for j
this was that "the company of schol- :
ars there have taken their holy mo- I
nastic vows. Each individual schol- !
ar will go probing as far as he can j
in the mysteries of life, then make
| an honest report thereon."'
FEW INSTITUTIONS
The second reason for more aca
demic freedom is the fact that Brit
| ain has relatively few institutions at
the collegiate and university level,
and that most of these are private.
Since Britain has just begun to j
provide free public education, Brit- i
ish schools "have profited from the
neglect of the community in which
they were located, which felt little
i responsibility for the schools."
He contrasted this to the Ameri- j
| can system, where the schools are I
vital and a Tbone of contention in j
every community.
Before accepting the directorship j
of the ACLU, Malin had a varied
career including the positions of
professor of economics at Swarth
more, lay Quaker preacher, profes
sional YMCA worker, and govern
-1 ment refugee worker.
"Civil servants' discretionary power will be the most important
civil liberties problem of the next five years. I know of no other
arena where battles will be fought more within our lifetime."
Patrick Murphy Malin, director of the American Civil Liberties
Union, expressed this opinion last night in an address at the First

Methodist Church in Palo Alto. The
meeting, sponsored by the Northern
California ACLU, was attended by
some 150 people.
"Civil Liberties and National Se
curity in Britain and America" was
the title of the talk, in which Malin
compared the application of various
liberties and the comparative stages
of uneasiness about national secu
rity.
Malin established as fact that one
cannot run the complicated, modern
state without entrusting more dis
cretionary powers to government
employees. "But," he found, "we
need to hem in the bureaucrats.
They should not make the unalter
able and unreviewable decisions
about the people outside and lesser
employees of the government. This
is an arena for application of "due
process of law."

NATIONAL SECURITY

In regard to national security,
Malin remarked, ''Britain has been
living with chronic international
danger for centuries. She has
learped how to live in its midst
without panic. The Britons, in their ;
gradually created equilibrium, are
profoundly critical of us in our J
present spasm of international dan- !
ger."
