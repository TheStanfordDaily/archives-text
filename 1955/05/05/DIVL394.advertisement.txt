MOTHER!
The day-of-days for Mothers is coming up soon —
May Bth is Ihe date—Mother's Day the occasion!
As usual, Congdon & Crome has been busy for
weeks gathering an outstanding collection of
Mother's Day greeting cards—and thoughtful-type
gifts that Mothers of all ages will appreciate. Here
are just a few ideas:
• CARDS — The exactly right sentiment for
your Mother is on .our card rack now.
• STATIONERY —'Mothers are letter writers.
Why not add to her enjoyment by picking
cut a gift box of stationery, just for her!
• PENS — There's a pen (or pen and pencil
set) to fit your pocketbook — and Mother's
writing style—among the hundreds on display
at C & C . . . including the Sheaffer Snorkel!
• LEATHER GOODS—A lady's billfold will
be appreciaied by Mother. Congdon &
Crome carries only the finest.
Come in soon — the time is drawing nigh!
