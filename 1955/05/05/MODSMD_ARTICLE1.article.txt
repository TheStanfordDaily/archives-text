The procedure for drawing will be

numbers to cards.
Each student may draw separate

draw together. Women drawing to
gether from different classes draw
with the lower class, and one or
both women may cancel but may
not redraw separately.
Placement in the residences will
be made according to class standing
and the number obtained in the
drawing. If the vacancies are not
filled by the designated class, ac
cording to the 3:2:1 ratio, they are j
opened to the next class and filled J
according to number drawn.

choices in regular drawing proce- ]
dure may apply for shrinkage.
