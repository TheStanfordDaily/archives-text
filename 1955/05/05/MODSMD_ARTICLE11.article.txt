Close to $8,000 was collected for
the Stanford Convalescent Home in
the recent drive, according to Paul
Bissinger, one of the drive's co
chairmen.
"Only a rough estimate of what
was actually collected can be given
now," Bissinger said, "because we
are still receiving contributions and
we will not be able to figure out the
total expenditures or transfer pay
ments until after this quarter."
However, Bissinger gave a list of
the "approximate" amount collected
by each of the fund-raising activi
ties.
The biggest contribution toward
the drive came from the off-campus
