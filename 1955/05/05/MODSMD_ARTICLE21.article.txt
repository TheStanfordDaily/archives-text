# 'Of Thee I Sing' Opens Tonight in Mem Aud
## Parody on U.S. Politics Curtain Time 8:15 For Three-Day Run 
### PHYLLIS FERGUSON 
The curtain rises at 8:15 to
night on George Gershwin's
musical comedy. "Of Thee I
Sing." The Ram's Head Spring
Show will run through Saturday
night in Memorial Auditorium.
The political parody, written by
George Kaufman, is one of the few
musical comedies ever to win a Pu
litzer Prize. It features Georye
Gershwin's memorable music,
"Wintergreen for President," "Who
Cares?" "Love Is Sweeping the
Country," and the title song, ''Of
Thee I Sing."
The plot revolves around John P.
Wintergreen, who is running for
President of the United States on
the ticket of love. To prove his sin
cerity, Wintergreen falls in love
himself.
INTERNATIONAL CRISIS
But to the extreme annoyance of
France, he loves Mary Turner in
stead of the delightful Diana Deve
reaux, winner of the Miss White
House contest. A great international
crisis results and war is almost de
clared before a solution is offered
by the half-forgotten candidate for
Vice-President, Alexander Throttle
bottom.
The show has a cast of over 100,
ranging from chambermaids and
wrestlers to bathing beauties and
Supreme Court Justices. Many un
usual scenes highlight the show, in
cluding an "inaugural wedding" on
the White House steps, a campaign
parade, and a political rally in Mad
ison Square Garden.
MODERNIZED
Modern stylized sets and minor
script changes lift the musical out
of the 1930's into the political scene
of today.

John P. Wintergreen, the whole
hearted proponent of love. Berns Is
from San Jose and played the lead
in the 1952 Spring Show, "Finian's
