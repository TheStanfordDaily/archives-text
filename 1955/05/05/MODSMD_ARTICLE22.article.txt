for artists and writers
To the Editor:
Oithesis for dancers; chorus, choir, and orchestra
lor musicians; KZSU and Rum's Head for speech and
drama majors. Where do artists and writers fit in?
Until a literary magazine is started here, they will
have no outside activity in which they can do their
I.est creative work. Such an activity outside the class
room is instrumental in encouraging the student to be
more productive, and in giving the rest of the campus
the opportunity to enjoy his work. I care most about
the stimulation a literary magazine would give Jhe
student, being an art major, and feel that such a
project should not be forced to stop if the audience
for the magazine proves to be small.
Could the audience be made large by aiming the
ma;.', /.inc at the inte v ests of the students? If so, how?
Certainly the ( hapareal writers have no problem
here. Since it is obvious what the students want,
features are geared to their taste. However, the writer
lor the literary magazine has no idea what students
want from him, and feels annoyed that he should have
to (are '1 he very requirement makes him shy of

producing, or makes him talk down to his audience
and write half-heartedly. In this way '"aiming to
please" keeps the magazine from being a real ex
pression of student work. Since the magazine could
not compete with the Chaparral in popularity, I think
the suggestion that it be subsidized would be the only
way to make ends meet. 112

A couple of other things are on my mind: Speaking
of white lines, the street markings, particularly the
cross walks, all over campus need touching up.
And please, just once in a while, couldn't we have
an editorial about national affairs, just for old time's
sake? "Editorials" like "This Week on Quad" and
"On Other Campuses" should be used as regular
feature articles like "I Hear Music."
