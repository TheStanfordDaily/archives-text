(The.author feel ; that entirely too much has
been done ior the malcontent in this society.
Millions, even thousands, of panaceas are of
fered to the maladjusted . . . and none to ihe
well oriented personality. Thus, as an offering
to the man who feels he has too many friends,
he has prepared this essay. . . .)
first we must ask ourselves if we have too
many friends or not. (To ourselves.) "Do we
have too many friends?" We don't? Then this
is not for you . . . read the ads. V/e do? Then,
this is for v/e. Now, let us ask ourselves why.
"Why?" (To ourselves.) What's that . . . we
have too much money? Oh, do we? Well,
there's nothing personal about this, but could
I get to know we a li.tie better .. . pleaSe! (Back
to what wo were saying . . .) Obviously we
have too many friends because we are too
charming. This is bad ... let us not be so
(harming. We are nice to be with and thus,
let u:. not be so nice to be with. Lei's we be a

stinker. . . . How can we lose friends and dis
interest people, huh? . . . ask that again! . . .
Ok, how can v/e lose friends and disinterest
peopled It's funny that you should ask that
. . . lend an ear.
1. When a prof gives an exlra long assign
ment, run gracefully to the front of the room,
and kneel before him . . . and cry . . . your
wish is my command, sire. (But, don't do this
in a psych class. . . . I've found those teachers
have no sense of humor whatsoever.)
2. When you call the little lady on the tele
phone, tell her you've juat gotten pinned, but
want to see her just one last time . . . this has j
been known to work wonders. . . .
3. In general, be contrary, adverse, opposed,
antagonistic, inconsistent, contradictory, hos- i
tile, and plain old mean. (If you try >:his for |
any length of time, you may have to purchase
my book . . . How io Regain Friends Lost by
Tomfoolery" . . . v/hich I may write sometime.)
