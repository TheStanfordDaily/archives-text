ROGER HAGAN

This Sunday afternoon one of the mos; frequently performed
modern composers of this age will be at Stanford to conduct a pro
gram of his own works. Darius Milhaud, now over sixty and fre
quently quite ill, has been one of the central figurete in the devel
opment of modern French music.
Paris, in the early years of this century, became Che center of

musical invention. The long he
gemony of German music was wan-
I ing before tin* /lurry of composition
, and experiment in France. The
teachings of Gabriel Faure and Erik
Satie had brought new harmonic
| color and lyric qualities to French
j music which Debussy and Ravel
I then expanded in to the style called
Impressionism.
After them, in the twenties, came
"The Six," a group of young com
posers united only in their kir.;hip
to Satie and the Paris Conservatory.
Chief among them were Milhaud
and Arthur Horicgger; the others
were Francis Poulenc, Georges Au
ric, Louis Durey, arid Germaine
Tailleferre.
HUMOR IN MUSIC
"The Six" uid not lollow the Im
pressionist tradition. Rather they
j harked back to Satie in applying
i humor to their music (Satie's works
often bore grotesque titles like
"Genuine Preludes for a Dog,"
"Dried Embryos") and to a more
structural style of composition.
Milhaud, the most significant of
the six, applied the polyharmony
(simultaneous use of several tonal
centers) of Richard Strauss, the
rhythms of early jazz, the flavor of
Brazil, and S~TcTPTCT.TfTT humor and
vitality to his composition. The re
sults are dissonant and exciting,
very seldom as sweet as earlier
French music. Perhaps the most fa
mous of his works is the "jazz" bal
let, "The Creation of the World,"
available on a record with Benny
Goodman doing the solo clarinet
work.
In addition to his appearance here,
it is interesting to note in how many

of tliis week's programs Midland's
works are being performed.
Tomorrow night the students and
faculty of the San Francisco Con
servatory of Music will put on a
chamber concert of Haydn, Beetho
ven, Roussel, Milhaud, and Hinde
mith at the Conservatory. Saturday
night the University of California
Glee Club will give a choral con
c 'rt, including Britten's "Hymn to
St. Cecilia" and baroque and classi
cal selections.
Sunday afternoon Richard Purvis
will do a program of contemporary
organ works at Grace Cathedral,
at 5:15. At 8 that evening the Ber
keley Symphony Orchestra will join
the choir of the First Unitarian
Church of Sun Francisco for a con
cert at the church.
That same evening, Opus One will
present one of its most unusual con
certs, a program of baroque and
modern works fpr little-heard in
struments like recorders, harpsi
chord, and viola de gamba.
Monday night, soprano Alma Bon
ner and pianist Eugene Gash will
give separate p erf or m ances of
Brahms and Ravel works in a joint
recital at the Century Club.
SONATA RECITAL
On Tuesday night pianist Bern
hard Abramowitsch will give an
other of a series of Beethoven so
nata recitals that is winning excel
lent reviews, at Cal's Wheeler Au
ditorium. Also, the San Francisco
String Quartet will perform at Main
Theater in the city.
Wednesday night in Nourse Audi
torium (Hayes and Franklin) a
symphony orchestra consisting
largely of members of the San
Francisco Symphony and conducted
by Murray Graitzer will give a ben
efit concert (tickets $1.65) including
Wagner's Tannhauser Overture;
three Chausson songs; Bizet's Sym
phony in C; Milhaud's Air for Viola
and Orchestra; Milhaud's Mediter
ranean Overture; and Shostako
vich's Symphony No. 1. This looks
like a good bargain.
For jazz fans: Harry James will
play the El Patio tomorrow night,
Bay Meadows Saturday night. Jack
Teagarden has opened at the Hang
over, and the Tin Angel not only has
ragtime pianist Wally Rose and his
new band, but the famous jazz sing
er Lizzie Miles as well.
Cal Tjader's Afro-Cubans play at
the Black Hawk until Tuesday,
when Earl Bostic takes over. Bru
beck has left to play East for a
while, and to appear in the Newport
(Rhode Island) Jazz Festival in
mid-July. Jerri Southern, an excel
lent performer, has joined the Hi-
Lo's at Fack's, and she sounds fine
when the high school kids aren't
screaming.
