Local track fans are having trouble this season finding adjectives to de-
Kcril:a Stanford's amazing cindermen. Coach Jack Weiershauser's Indians
have won only three out of six meets thus far this spring, but with the out
standing marks and the unusually high team spirit which are prevalent on
the squad, they rank as one of the best Tribe teams since the early '40's.
'Jlii' Card thindads are now in the home stretch as far as the dual meet

season is concerned. Saturday, they
travel to Berkeley for a meet with tht
oft-whipped California Bears. Three
days later, they host the powerful
Trojans of USC in a twice-postponed
twilight meet at Stanford Stadium.
These two competitions will be the
last ui their type for the Tribe as the
following weekend they will take
part in the Modesto Relays. The an
nual Modesto affair will be the first
in a string of similar events that are
climaxed by the Pacific Coast Con
ference meet on May 27-23 in Eu
gene. Oregon and the NCAA champ
ionships in Los Angeles on June 17-
18.
No one expects the Indians to en
counter too much trouble against the
Golden Bears. The Berkeleyans had

tlieir best day against UCLA, and still lost by about 150 points. The Cards
lost to the Bruins in a meet that was not decided until the final event. Cal
also lost to San Jose by 30 some-odd markers. Last weekend, the
Spartans were helpless against the Tribe forces as they lost, 86V2 to 44Va.
As to the USC meetâ€”the Trojans are and have been undisputed national
champions for quite a few years. Before the meet was originally post
poned, the Indians figured to be about 20-30 point underdogs. Since then
they have improved their marks considerably, while on the basis of South
ern Cal'si last competition at Dallas, Texas, the Figueioa Streeters have
not yet had their best meet. Comparing the times of the Stanford-San
Jose meet and the USC-Texas meet, the two squads were approximately
equal. This might be wishful thinking, but the silver lining seems to be
getting brighter all the time.
WEEKLY AWARD
If a weekly track award were to be given to a member of the varsity
track team lor an outstanding performance, this week's award would
doubtless haye to be split between the Tribe's newly-elected co-captains,
Walt Garrett and Keith Brownsberger. If these two seniors could repeat
tiie marks made against the Spartans in the USC affair, it would mean two
first places for coach Weiershauser.
However, a sophomore broad jumper could give them plenty of compe
tition for the award. Frank Herrmann, one of the brightest spots on the
team this year, has been improving so steadily in last year that if he
continues at the same pace, he could very well become one of Stanford's
all time greats in that event. Last year as a freshman, his best jump was
22-3. Under the tutoring of Weiershauser and assistant coach Ray Dean,
Herrmann has increased his distance every meet and last weekend hit 24 ] j.
GRADUATING SENIORS
Besides Garrett and Brownsberger, nine other seniors will be competing
in their last Big Meet. The Cards will lose sprinter Jim Saras, who has
turned in consistently top marks in the two dashes, Larry Spicer, who was
headed for a good year until a pulled muscle disabled him, and distance men
Wil King and Bob Reed. Also graduating are two of the top javelin men
in the country. Bob Kimball and John Bugge, and shot-putter Phil Brabyn.
high-jumper Norm Jiles, and broad jumper Loren Sorensen.'
SAY IT WITH MUSIC!
This is the Big Weekend. Besides the varsity and freshman track teams'
meets with California, both baseball squads will challenge their Berkeley
counterparts over the two-day period. It would be very nice if the Farm
could claim a clean sweep. Along with this, certain people have inquired
about the possibility of the Stanford Band traveling to Berkeley on Sat
urday to lend their support to the trackmen and the baseballers. The Band
has won the support of the whole student body this year by their fine per
formances during basketball season and out at the Con Home barbeque
the other night. With the Band behind them, the Indian teams would
have an even greater stimulus to beat the Bears. It's a good suggestion
how about it, George Shelton?
