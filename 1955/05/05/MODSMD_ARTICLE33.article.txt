# Riflemen Move Outdoors
## 
### KEN GREEN 
The indoor rifle season is
about to end, and the outdoor
season is about to begin. Almost
any day of the week one could
go over to the rifle range and
find many shooters practicing
for a coming match.
The Stanford team has but one
indoor match left* this season, but
! many of the team members are
i looking forward to the individual
; matches in the coming outdoor sea
son.
Stanford has completed its
matches in the Northern Intercolle
giate Rifle Conference. The Univer
sity of California, with its national
championship team, finished first,
and Stanford finished a disappoint
ing fourth with a three-win and
seven-loss record.
SANTA CLARA LEAGUE
Stanford, with a two - win and
three-loss record, is doing better in
the Santa Clara Valley Rifle League.
Stanford's only match left is with
second-place Santa Clara.
At the 50-foot range that is used
to shoot the matches on, the target
seems very small. The bull's-eye is
about three-sixteenths of an inch
in diameter, and the five ring, which
is the largest ring, is about two
inches in diameter.
BEST EFFORT
The high point of this season so
far was in a match with San Jose
State College when Tom Murray of
Stanford shot a 290 individual score.
This was important because it en
abled Stanford to win the match by
one point, 1,400 to 1,399. The 290
shot by Murray was the highest in
dividual score of the Stanford team
this season, and the 1,400 was the
highest team score of the season.
This year's team is a very well
balanced team. Tom Murray is the
leading shooter, and behind him all
of the shooters have almost identi
cal averages. The other team mem
bers are senior Edward Abram; jun
iors William Hadley, Dave Conrath,
and Ken Green; freshmen Bob Ellis,
Norman Dang, Jim Frost, and Gaye
Harpster.

FlRE!â€”Members of the Indian rifle squad take aim at the elusive
target some 50 feet away. Shown firing are Card seniors Ed
Abram, kneeling, and Tom Murray, shooting off hand. The two
sharpshooters are the only members of the team who will not be
returning next year.
