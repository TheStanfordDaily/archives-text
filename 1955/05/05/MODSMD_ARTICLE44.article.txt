# Water Causes Bumpy Riding On Boulevard
## 
### 
Been having bumpy rides lately?
If you've been driving south of
the campus on Junipero Serra Bou
levard you have, because, of the
rough road surface. Leonard Bush
nell, Santa Clara County Engineer,
said yesterday that poor water
drainage was causing the road to
deteriorate. He warned that if the
situation wasn't alleviated soon,
"there won't be a road in a couple
of years."
The county highway department
has been studying the problem for
the past three weeks, making sur
veys in order to establish the repair
cost.
The budget for the project must
be approved by the county before
repairs can be started, but Bush
noil was hopeful that work would
get under way this year.
