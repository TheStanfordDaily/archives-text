# Ike May Ask Free Salk Distribution
## 
### 
WASHINGTONâ€”President Eisen
hower will ask Congress to author

ize federally financed free distribu- j
tion of the Salk polio vaccine to all ;
the nation's children if he finds any j
child is being unfairly deprived of ;
its protection.
The White House announced the j
possible drastic step today as the j
Public Health Service reported that :
supplies of the vaccine have fallen
nearly 7,000,000 doses behind esti
mates made only a week ago. The
Service said one factor in the "slow
down" was the ban on Cutter vac
cine.
But it said the lag also is due in
part to its refusal to approve 3,900,-
000 doses prepared by other firms
until the manufacturers submit ad
ditional information their tests of
the vaccine's safety and potency.
