Robert Scott 'Scotty" Gray, Phi Kappa Psi, was reported in "sat
isfactory" condition last night at the Palo Alto Hospital after a
campus auto accident yesterday afternoon.
Gray sustained severe cuts on the face and nose when his car
struck a house on the Row about 5 p.m. He was the only occupant

of the car.
Police said Gray was turning off
the Row toward Mayfield Avenue
when he lost control, skidded, and
smashed into the house of Dr. A. M.
Espinosa, Jr., associate professor of
Romanic languages, at 572 Lasuen
Street.
Gray was rushed by Palo Alto
ambulance to the Palo Alto Hospital,
where he underwent surgery a few
hours later. His physician last night
said Gray evidently escaped a con
cussion. His injuries were sustained
when his head struck the wind
shield, according to police.
A partially filled half-gallon of
wine was found in the back seat of
Gray's Chevrolet at the time of the
accident. Stanford Chief of Police
Gordon Davis said that was evidence
that Gray was "under considerable
influence of alcohol" at the time of
the acident.
An eyewitness said Gray was
traveling at a high rate of speed,
lost control of the car, and hit the
porch of the house, where the car
came to rest.
The front steps of the house were
partially demolished by the force of
the crash.
Gray is a junior from Sacramento,
majoring in education.
