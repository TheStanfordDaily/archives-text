# Ram's Head Production Of Gershwin Musical Called 'Snappy, Hilarious'
## 
### PHYLLIS FERGUSON 
Of thee I sing, Ram's Head. It's easy to understand why 'ihe
musical comedy "Of Thee I Sing" won the Pulitzer Prize in the
19305. The script is hilarious, the music outstanding, and the plot
delightful.
It is difficult to understand how an amateur group could do such

justice to the high standards set by
the show. But Ram's Head does.
"Of Thee I Sing" literally starts
with a bang as a campaign parade
struts down the aisles. This snappy
pace carries through to the spec- J
tacular finale of 100 voices, an ex- |
cellent effect which is rarely found
in modern musicals.
Special effects, ,such as a clever \
movie of the election returns, a i
loudspeaker interrupting campaign
speeches in Madison Square Gar- I
den, and a mambo routine in the !
Senate chambers, add many laughs
to the show. Skillful lighting adds
to the effectiveness of the scenes.
The show has many all - cast
scenes which are particularly strong.
Occasionally the chorus had diffi
culty keeping with the orchestra but
it did an excellent job of getting
the lyrics out to the audiencfe.
ORCHESTRA 'COLLISION'
The musical score is one of
Gershwin's best, and arrangements
are outstanding. But despite Bill
Scott's adept, direction, the orches
tra can't seem to avoid sounding
like a collision between two milk
trucks.
Carolyn Cowan deserves high
praise for her portrayal of the plain
American girl. Her graceful stage
presence and charming voice create
a perfect Mary Turner. In brief, a i
superb performance.
Although Bert Berns is no actor,
he makes a valiant effort and suc
cessfully carries the part of John P. j
Wintergreen. His baritone voice is
a marked advantage and his ges-

tures, though limited, are adequate
for the satire.
Alice Middlekauff is far from a
lilting soprano which the part of
Diana Devereaux calls for. But her
voice is of little consequence to her
convincing characterization and her
skill in putting the songs across. As
the Southern temptress, she's a
knockout.
COMIC CHARACTER
As the simple-minded Vice-Pres
ident, John Benedict creates a per
fect comic • character. His expres
sions and gestures are priceless, and
he often steals from Wintergreen.
Jn small parts, special mention
must go to Bill Burke and Hart
Sprager. Burke's portrayal of the
French ambassador is nothing less
than professional and his feeling for
the part and technique are unmis
takable.
As Chairman of the National
Committee, Sprager creates a char
acter. Unlike the rest of the Presi
dent's "boys," he gives an individ
ual interpretation of the part.
Staging and choreography are un
usually good and handle the large
cast easily. Unrealistic costumes and
stylized sets sharpen the s'atire.
