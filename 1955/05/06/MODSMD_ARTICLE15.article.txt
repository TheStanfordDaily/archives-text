# Cards Heavily Favored To Top Cal Trackmen In Big Meet Tomorrow
## Garrett, Bugge, Kimball, Stewart Threats to Break Meet Records 
### BOB MIEROW 
It's time for another trip to Berkeley, but conditions are a little
different now than they were when the Big Red grid machine hit
the road for the California campus.
Tomorrow, Stanford's startling track team will be rated heavy
favorites to rout the Gold and Blue at 2 p.m. on Edwards Field. The

♦•Card cindermen should gather up
11 of the 15 first places in the Big
Meet if everything is run according
i to form.
Five meet records are in jeopardy
of being exploded. The Tribe's Walt
Garrett looks like the best bet to
smash one of the old marks. Gar
rett has turned in a 47.7 quarter
mile and an unofficial 47 flat relay
lap. Grover Klemmer's meet stand
ard is 47.6.
JAVELIN DUO
Stanford's javelin-tossing duo of
John Bugge and Bob Kimball are
serious threats to Leo Long's year
old mark of 223-1%. Bugge has got
ten off a 221-7 spear toss, while
Kimball has a 221-0 1 4 flip to his
credit.
Three Tribesmen, John Stewart,
| Phil Fehlen, and Norm Jiles, have
I jumped within one inch of the meet
record of 6-6. The Cards look for a
clean sweep of this event, since Cal
j hasn't a jumper who has cleared
j over six feet.
Cal's John Kahnert has a 54-7V4
shot put to his credit and has been
! improving steadily during the year.
Otis Chandler, Indian weight great
| of five years ago, holds the present
I mark of 55-3.
Another possible new record
j could be set in the two-mile where
Chuck Strong has turned in a 9:25.1
performance. The present 12-sea
son-old best is 9:22.9.
SPRINTERS
Stanford's sprinting pair of Keith
Brownsberger and Jim Saras should
come through with only one Bear
expected to give them any compe
tition. Jim Plessas will not only try
• to break up the Card sprint duo,
but will try his luck in the low
hurdles.
Sarah (9.7 and 21.3) and Browns
berger (9.7 and 21.1) have better
times to their credit than Plessas
