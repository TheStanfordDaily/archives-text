# Cards Heavily Favored To Top Cal Trackmen In Big Meet Tomorrow
## Garrett, Bugge, Kimball, Stewart Threats to Break Meet Records 
### BOB MIEROW 
It's time for another trip to Berkeley, but conditions are a little
different now than they were when the Big Red grid machine hit
the road for the California campus.
Tomorrow, Stanford's startling track team will be rated heavy
favorites to rout the Gold and Blue at 2 p.m. on Edwards Field. The

♦•Card cindermen should gather up
11 of the 15 first places in the Big
Meet if everything is run according
i to form.
Five meet records are in jeopardy
of being exploded. The Tribe's Walt
Garrett looks like the best bet to
smash one of the old marks. Gar
rett has turned in a 47.7 quarter
mile and an unofficial 47 flat relay
lap. Grover Klemmer's meet stand
ard is 47.6.
JAVELIN DUO
Stanford's javelin-tossing duo of
John Bugge and Bob Kimball are
serious threats to Leo Long's year
old mark of 223-1%. Bugge has got
ten off a 221-7 spear toss, while
Kimball has a 221-0 1 4 flip to his
credit.
Three Tribesmen, John Stewart,
| Phil Fehlen, and Norm Jiles, have
I jumped within one inch of the meet
record of 6-6. The Cards look for a
clean sweep of this event, since Cal
j hasn't a jumper who has cleared
j over six feet.
Cal's John Kahnert has a 54-7V4
shot put to his credit and has been
! improving steadily during the year.
Otis Chandler, Indian weight great
| of five years ago, holds the present
I mark of 55-3.
Another possible new record
j could be set in the two-mile where
Chuck Strong has turned in a 9:25.1
performance. The present 12-sea
son-old best is 9:22.9.
SPRINTERS
Stanford's sprinting pair of Keith
Brownsberger and Jim Saras should
come through with only one Bear
expected to give them any compe
tition. Jim Plessas will not only try
• to break up the Card sprint duo,
but will try his luck in the low
hurdles.
Sarah (9.7 and 21.3) and Browns
berger (9.7 and 21.1) have better
times to their credit than Plessas


WIL KING
(10.1 and 22.2), but the Cal ace
could give the Cards trouble.
Unbeaten 440 runner Garrett may
run into a tough competitor in Cal's
Bob Warwick. The Blue and Gold
quarter-mile ace has a 48.5 to his
credit.
Ed Hersh of the Berkeley thin
clads will be tough to whip in the j
880. His be.st time of 1:54.9 com- '
pares with teammate A1 Carlson's
1:55.5 and the 1:57.6 best of the I
Tribe's Ford Sims.
MILE BATTLE
An interesting race should de
velop in the mile. Stanford's Wil
King (4:18.4) and Chuck Strong
(4:21.5) will battle A1 Baeta
(4:19.4) of the Bears in a three-way
struggle.
Stanford figures to completely
dominate the high jump and jave
lin. Stewart, Fehlen, and Jiles!
should have no problem outleaping j
their Cal opponents.
While Bugge and Kimball should
place one-two in the spear-throw.
Hank Roldan will face stern compe
tition from the Bears' Hal Norris for
third place. Roldan has a 201-9%
best while Norris' best is 200-9.
Another strong Tribe event will
be the broad jump. Frank Herrmann

(24-O'i), Ed Fremouw (23-Ity), and
Loren Sorenson (22-3) will be op
posed by California's Marshall Ce
lestin (22-6 7 ,5).
CAL THREATS
Brutus Hamilton's charges look
like victors in the discus and pole
vault. Eric Murray (157-0 :i m) looks
like a cinch in the platter-toss
against Stanford's Jim Truher (149-
GVa) and Bob Kimball (147-8%).
Dave Seed has a 14-0 top against

the Indians' Bill Flint's record of
13-8 in the pole vault.
Bernie Nelson and Jim Luttrell
are solid choices to share the hurdle
races. While absolutely no compe
tition is expected in the high sticks,
Plessas may make a race out of the
low barriers. Luttrell's best is 23.fi,
while the Cal ace has a 23.9 top.


Frank Huntress
SOPH TRlO—Card sophomores Ford Sims, Joe Wollett, and Bill
Carls come in 1-2-3 in the 880 against San Jose State to give the
Indians a clean sweep. The three will have their work cut out for
them to beat Ed Hersh and A 1 Carlson of Cal in the Big Meet
Saturday.
