Since the very beginnings of formai educa
lion there lias been argument as to whether
university training should be in the classical
liberal rts vein or along more practical "job
training" lines.
And as the field of education has expanded,
the public lias demanded more stress on the
vocational aspect and less on liberal arts train
ing. Supporters of liberal arts say the function
<,l a university is to teach its students "to think,
rather than to teach them to do a specific job."
This is the so-called "classical" view held by
most educators.
However, with increasing numbers of young
peofiji.- a! ending college a cry has been raised
to "teach us how to make a living; we don't
want culture alone, we want job training." The
public institution has had to respond to this
pressure more so than the private school with
the result that public education has become
more and more specialized in its stress.
The stress at Stanford is still on a broad edu
cational base as opposed to specialized voca
tion.'! training and student opinion on the mer
its of this is as varied as that of the public at
large.
Younger students have perhaps felt the pres
sure of liberal arts training as against vocation
al training more so than others and some fresh
man here have this to say:
Mike Holmes, '58: "It's impossible for a col
lege to train people for occupations. The com
pexity of jobs in the modern world reguires
schools to give students only a general basis
for thought and living. Training should bo
given on the job."
Dan Cohen, '58: "I don't believe in liberal
education. A person,develops interests he en
joys culiivating and he shouldn't be forced
along lines he gets neither pleasure nor value
pursuing."
Hon Larson, '58: "The main purpose of a
school is to train for an occupation. But the in
dividual should strive for a liberal education
whenever possible, both in school and out,
except when it interferes with his training."
Jnn (iilkey, '58: "Liberal education is the
mark of an educated man. Thinking developed

only along one line leads to a sterile and un
creativo existence."
Student opinion in other groups:
Sally Thompson, '56: "I don't think it's true
I that Stanford is beginning to overemphasize
vocational education], because many people at
Stanford are majoring in fields where no direct
vocational training is required."
Meredith Ellis, '56: "There should be a bal
ance. Stanford's setup is a good idea because
• liberal arts aren't included just as a scholarly
pastime. You can learn both areas of training
together and can apply the principles of one to
the other. But the liberal arts don't have to be
presented to everyone in the same way. Every
one shouldn't be poured through the same pat
tern of humanities courses."
Melissa Woodrinq, '57: "This [trend to un
deremphasize liberal arts training] is bad. It
gives people a narrow-minded, technological
view and produces mechanization, leaving
only the nuts and bolts of the social structure.
Stanford should hold out for the concept of man
as man, not one of the 'faceless crowd.' It isn't
headed that way now, but it has the opportu
nity."
Sandra Peters, '57: "This is bad if carried
too far I vocational training I. It's a good idea to
know something outside of your own field.
You can get an awfully narrow viewpoint if you
don't. I think Stanford generally emphasizes
the liberal arits."
Pierre Servoz-Gavin, graduate student: "At
the undergraduate level, T don't think there is
enough stress on developing intellectual
power. There's too much material, too much
specialization. I am a graduate engineer, but
in France I studied Greek, literature, philoso
phy ... it is useless to fill the untrained mind
wi'lh a mass of detail."
Adoll Seilacher, Ph.D., from Tubingen Uni
versity, Germany: "Compared with many Ger
man schools, I think Stanford concerrtrates
more on the general liberal arts; there is less
accent, in my field, at least, on the technical
specialties."

LIBERAL EDUCATION ... OR VOCATIONAL TRAINING?
Since the very beginnings of formai educa
lion there lias been argument as to whether
university training should be in the classical
liberal rts vein or along more practical "job
training" lines.
And as the field of education has expanded,
the public lias demanded more stress on the
vocational aspect and less on liberal arts train
ing. Supporters of liberal arts say the function
<,l a university is to teach its students "to think,
rather than to teach them to do a specific job."
This is the so-called "classical" view held by
most educators.
However, with increasing numbers of young
peofiji.- a! ending college a cry has been raised
to "teach us how to make a living; we don't
want culture alone, we want job training." The
public institution has had to respond to this
pressure more so than the private school with
the result that public education has become
more and more specialized in its stress.
The stress at Stanford is still on a broad edu
cational base as opposed to specialized voca
tion.'! training and student opinion on the mer
its of this is as varied as that of the public at
large.
Younger students have perhaps felt the pres
sure of liberal arts training as against vocation
al training more so than others and some fresh

Mike Holmes, '58: "It's impossible for a col

schools to give students only a general basis
for thought and living. Training should bo
given on the job."
Dan Cohen, '58: "I don't believe in liberal
education. A person,develops interests he en
