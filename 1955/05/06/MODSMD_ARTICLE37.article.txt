# Gofers Face Cal
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity and freshman
goll teams will both see action this
weekend. The varsity linksmen will
face Cal, whom they whipped ear
lier this season, 21'->-5 1 2. Opposing
the freshmen will be Santa Barbara
High School. The matches will start
at 7:45 a.m. on Saturday,
The varsity should have a fairly
easy time defeating the Bears, and
there is a chance that the Indians
might make a clean sweep. Leading
the Bears will be Fred Soloman, Bob
Schnal, and Bob Gregovich.
The freshmen, however, will have
a hard fight on their hands, as Santa
Barbara's first man, AI Geiberger. is
the junior golf champion of the
world. Last year he created a sen
sation in Europe.
