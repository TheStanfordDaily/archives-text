# Card Cindermen Rout Hapless Bears,87-44
## 
### BOB MIEROW 
Stanford had just 100 many
horses for California's varsity
trackmen Saturday as the Tribe
juggernaut smashed the faded
Golden Bears, 87-44.
Outstanding performances by
Cards John Bugge, Keith Browns
berger, and Walt Garrett led the
victors to their rout.
Bugge posed a tremendous threat
to tracksters warming up on the
south turn of Edwards Field as he
continually heaved the javelin off
the grass and onto the cinders. His
winning throw was an outstanding
229-B'/a, a new meet record.
Brownsberger sprinted to victo
ries in the 100 and 220, and raced on
a leg of the triumphant relay team.
Garrett scored an easy victory in
the 440 and anchored the relay
quartet.
SECOND NATIONALLY
Buggc's spear - toss smashed Leo
Long's one-year-old meet standard
of 223-1%. The tremendous effort
was also the second best by any col
legian this year.
Boh Kimball, with a 219-6 throw,
and Hank Roldan, who fired the
spear 203-0%, combined with Bugge
to give the Indians a clean sweep.
The Bears managed to come
through with only four first places
in the 15 events. As expected. Dave

Seed won the pole vault, Ed Hersh
broke the tape first in the 880, and
Eric Murray scored a triumph over
his discus-throwing opponents.
TWO-MILE UPSET
California's Jim Maddux upset'the
Cards' favored duo of Wil King and
Chuck Strong in the two-mile with
a time of 9:42.5. Strong dropped out
after six laps while King didn't have
any kick left to match the Bear run
ner.
Hersh was pushed more than ex
pected in the half-mile when Tribe
ace Ford Sims came through with
his all-time best, 1:55.5, to make a
real thriller out of the race.
BROWNIE WINS 100
Jim Plessas almost upset the apple
! cart early in the meet when he came
I within inches of toppling favored
! Keith Brownsberger in the century.
Brownie spurted near the finish line
to edge out the Berkeley dash star.
Stanford scored an unexpected
triumph in the shot put when Cal's
