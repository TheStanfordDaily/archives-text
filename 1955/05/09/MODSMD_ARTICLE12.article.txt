# ASSU Primary Elections Will Begin Tomorrow
## 26 Positions To Be Filled 
### 
HELEN ZARIFES—Through serv
ing on the Social Co-ordinating
Board this year, as the Junior Class
representative, I have had the op
portunity to see mc strength, weak
ness, and potential of that organiza
tion and of the vice-presidential of
fice itself.
Definite gains have been made,
but the material accomplishments
have been small. The groundwork
of good organization has been laid;
I would like to begin next year right
where we leave off at the end of this
quarter, providing continuity and
avoiding the indecisiveness that lack
of experience can foster.
An orientation program for men's
social chairmen, clarification of the
patron and social registration pro
gram, and a closer working rela
tionship with all campus and Vil
lage social chairmen are necessary.

EILEEN CONAGHAN — Student
government needs to become a real
ity. It should represent the ideas of
everyone, not just the office-hold
ers. Less consideration should be
given to meetings and more effort
exerted to establish personal con
tact. Social Co-ordinating Board
should de-emphasize fines and stress
positive aspects of their regulations.
It needs the co-operation of all
groups and to succeed it must make
unbiased decisions. I thing many
committees have no justification or
are inefficient; therefore they should
be dissolved or revamped.
In general, I feel apathy about
student government stems from "not
knowing." Give the student the op
portunity to know the direct effects
of his government—he's entitled to
it.

JERRY FITZGERALD—Even the
current anarchist ticket agrees that
the job of social co-ordination, one
of the specific duties of the five
president, Ls a necessary function of
student government. Certain inade
quacies now exist in the planning
of the social program at Stanford.
For instance, Associated Women
Students has a wonderful leader
ship conference instructing social
chairmen in the protocol of ex
changes, parties, dances, etc.
Would not an ASSU leadership
conference include and inform the
men a little more effectively? Fur
ther, no social program can be ex
pected to fulfill satisfactory ends
unless that program is approach
able, flexible, based on personal re
lationships, and meets the needs of
the students.

ASSU primary elections for 26
student body and class positions will
