# Yell Leader Candidates Urge More Co-operation
## 
### 
The two candidates for next year's
head yell leader both agree that
better planning and co-ordination
are the keys to good student rallies.
Joe Critchfield and Jim Walters, the
two men opposed in the coming
election for yell leader, have both
had previous experience on Rally
Committee and are seeking the of
fice held this year by Ed Mahoney.
Jim Walters, a junior from Long
Beach, looks at the job of yell leader
as that of a co-ordinator, unifying
the efforts of the band, the team,
and the rooting sections into one in
tegrated unit.
Walters, a Theta Chi majoring in
political science and international
relations, has had high school expe
rience with rally committees and
has definite plans for improvement
of Stanford spirit.
He says,"I believe that all stu
dents, faculty members, and ad
ministrators are well aware of the
vast area open for improvement in
regard to yell leaders and the Stan
ford spirit in general."

The candidate's plans call for the ]
use of "three key words which, if
put into action, will unlock the I
problems existing." The three words
are co-operation, co-ordination, and
pre-planning.
He would worX crosely with the
band to better integrate the yells of i
the three rooting sections with game
music. Walters' ideas call for pre
planning with the band and the stu
dents in the sections in order to pre
sent a group effort at the football
games this fall.
UNIFY SPIRIT
Walters feels that the job of yell
leader is to unify the work of the
parts of Stanford spirit—the rooting
sections and the band—into one unit
which will better represent the Uni
versity.
Specifically, he plans to attend
band and Rally Committee meetings
to get their ideas and his co-ordi
nated and then to present these to
student rooters at pre-game rallies.
He'd al :o try to get local merchants
to sponsor convenient-sized book
lets which would include yells and j
songs and which students could
carry so they'd be better prepared i
when they enter the rooting section, i
Joe Critchfield, sophomore from
Anaheim, thinks that the yell leader
should work closely with the Rally t
Committee in planning to assure
that pre-game rallies bring student !
spirit "up" for^games.
CON HOME KING
Critchfield is a Sigma Nu major
ing in civil engineering who was an j
assistant yell leader here last year, j
He was Con Home King this year
and has done comedy acting.
He says that Stanford spirit is j
good and that there's no need for
improvement, just a need for better
rally planning and co-ordination
between the head yell leader and l
his assistants.
Critchfield would have weekly
meetings with his assistants to plan
stunts for the coming game and sec :
that the yell leader had more to j
say in rally planning.
He considers the many appear
ances which a yell leader is called
upon to make at alumni functions
vital and says, "It's important for
the yell leader to present a good
picture to the alumni on what we
are doing here at Stanford.
So, briefly, Critchfield would work
closely with Rally Com and his as
sistant yell leaders to keep student
spirit "up" and would be prepared
to better represent the University at
alumni gatherings.
