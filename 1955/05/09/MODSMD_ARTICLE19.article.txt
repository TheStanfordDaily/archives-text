Again tomorrow, we all have the chance to
participate in cn annual Stanford farce: ASSU
elections.
But why should the grand tradition of self
government have degenerated into a farce? Is
it because of a lack of good candidates with in
telligent programs, a lack of "educated" voters,
cr the fact that ASSU officers have so little
really worth while to do?
Probably it is all of these. But they in turn
are caused by one thing alone—voter apathy.
' We can have no good candidates, intelligent
programs, or anything worth while in student
government unless the voters want it. And
at Stanford, the majority of voters seem to want
nothing; for they repeatedly refuse to support
anything or anybody at the polls.
But before you complain that you hate the
whole ridiculous business of student politics,
ask yourself what you have done to improve
things. How often do you vote? Do you ever
lake the trouble to write letters to student lead
ers or to The Daily making suggestions for

changes? Have you bothered to read the new
constitution, or do you merely attack things,
without knowing what you're attacking?
If you are guilty of these lethargic crimes,
as is a majority cf Stanford's student body ev
ery spring election, try doing something con
structive: ay voting.
Whatever evils exist in Stanford's present
political setup —and there are many—cannot
be cured by an apathetic student body. Minor
ity rule leads only to inefficiency and corrup
tion. Vole tomorrow for whichever candidates
most nearly express your own feelings about
the way student government should be run.
And if you feel that no one comes close, try
running yourself next time, backing a friend,
or letting people know in some way how you
feel. If you'll be satisfied only by an end tp
student government, good so long as you do
something about it.
Forty-five per cent of the student body voted
in the last ASSU election. Let's t> y for an inno
vation this year in Stanford's government: a
rule by the majority. Stew lay
