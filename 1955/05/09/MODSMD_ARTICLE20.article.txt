# this, week on quad...... earl cilley
## 
### 
It'll be "Sex on Quad" time tomorrow after
noon when wicked ol' Intermezzo screens an
other of'its daring French imports. This one is
called The Big Day (Jour de Fete), and while
i: may not pack all the wallop of the recent
Biology 3 production of The Birth of a Pig, we'll
bet you culture lovers will all be there at Cub
berley when the great gong strikes 4:15 and the
gendarmes bolt the doors.
Tuesday Evening Series is back and tomor
row night will find Alf E. Brandin, Business
Manager and head of the Farm land develop
ment program, on deck at Mem Aud to talk on
the ins and outs of the University's plans to get
some money out of its surplus real estate. The
witching hour is 7:30.
Wednesday looks like a good day to get out
of town, when the Old Boy's latest effort will
be the filling the trashbaskets of a long-suffer
ing student body, and polluting the fragrant
East Bay zephyrs. Dedicated to raising the in
tellectual level, the new Chappie promises to
be a real rib-tickler. Anyorte for Popular Me
chanics?
Do you want to be mean, grasping, nasty?
Do you giggle when you read Dickens? Do
you chuckle when the kid next door sticks pins
in his pet hamster? Do you like to pull wings
off houseflies? If you do, and if you have a
ticket to the Film Series, plan to be at Cubber
ley Thursday night towing your Iron Maiden

when Public Exercises will show a bit of froth
entitled Greed. Poet time: 7:30.
If the Film Series doesn't make your little
heart go pit-a-pat, !he Stanford Folkdancers and
the WAA are running off a Scottish folkdancing
spree in the Village Auditorium. Same day,
same time. Everybody and his grandmother is
invited, and it looks like it might be a chance to
solve the old guestion: Wha':, if anything, do
Scots wear under their kilties? One, two, and
away . . .
* * *
Blithe Spirit and two UPA cartoons will be
the offering Sunday night at the flicks. The
feature is a Noel Coward comedy, so leave the
alarm clocks and the rubber snakes at home.
Culture, sophistication, and the well-bred titter
are in order, and the word is out that the ASSU
cops will be on the lookout for waterpistols. So
where does this leave you, McNulty?
Just don't let anybody tell you that Stanford
doesn't have a red-hot program of activities and
cultural events. Glim the following offering
of the Biology Department, which we nominate
as the crowd-pleaser of the week. It's a semi
nar called "Auxin Destruction in Relation to
Leaf Growth in the Fern Osmunda cinnamo
mea," and the scientific medicine ball will start
bouncing at 4:15 p.m. Monday, in Room 430.
Tie a siring on your finger—this is a once-in-a
lifetime chance . . . Quiet in the back row,
please,

off houseflies? If you do, and if you have a
ticket to the Film Series, plan to be at Cubber
ley Thursday night towing your Iron Maiden

when Public Exercises will show a bit of froth
entitled Greed. Poet time: 7:30.
If the Film Series doesn't make your little
heart go pit-a-pat, !he Stanford Folkdancers and
the WAA are running off a Scottish folkdancing
spree in the Village Auditorium. Same day,
same time. Everybody and his grandmother is
invited, and it looks like it might be a chance to
solve the old guestion: Wha':, if anything, do
Scots wear under their kilties? One, two, and
away . . .
* * *
Blithe Spirit and two UPA cartoons will be
the offering Sunday night at the flicks. The
feature is a Noel Coward comedy, so leave the
alarm clocks and the rubber snakes at home.
Culture, sophistication, and the well-bred titter
are in order, and the word is out that the ASSU
cops will be on the lookout for waterpistols. So
where does this leave you, McNulty?
Just don't let anybody tell you that Stanford
doesn't have a red-hot program of activities and
cultural events. Glim the following offering
of the Biology Department, which we nominate
as the crowd-pleaser of the week. It's a semi
nar called "Auxin Destruction in Relation to
Leaf Growth in the Fern Osmunda cinnamo
mea," and the scientific medicine ball will start
bouncing at 4:15 p.m. Monday, in Room 430.
Tie a siring on your finger—this is a once-in-a
lifetime chance . . . Quiet in the back row,
please,
It'll be "Sex on Quad" time tomorrow after
noon when wicked ol' Intermezzo screens an
other of'its daring French imports. This one is
called The Big Day (Jour de Fete), and while
i: may not pack all the wallop of the recent
Biology 3 production of The Birth of a Pig, we'll
bet you culture lovers will all be there at Cub
berley when the great gong strikes 4:15 and the
gendarmes bolt the doors.
Tuesday Evening Series is back and tomor
row night will find Alf E. Brandin, Business
Manager and head of the Farm land develop
ment program, on deck at Mem Aud to talk on
the ins and outs of the University's plans to get
some money out of its surplus real estate. The
witching hour is 7:30.
Wednesday looks like a good day to get out
of town, when the Old Boy's latest effort will
be the filling the trashbaskets of a long-suffer
ing student body, and polluting the fragrant
East Bay zephyrs. Dedicated to raising the in
tellectual level, the new Chappie promises to
be a real rib-tickler. Anyorte for Popular Me
chanics?
Do you want to be mean, grasping, nasty?
Do you giggle when you read Dickens? Do
you chuckle when the kid next door sticks pins
in his pet hamster? Do you like to pull wings
off houseflies? If you do, and if you have a
ticket to the Film Series, plan to be at Cubber
