training for liberals
To the Editor:
It is appropriate that the Daily has chosen to write
articles concerning a balanced education because it
causes the student to think a little about whether or
not his own education is sufficiently broad. It is un
fortunate that students in the technical fields are not
able to take more courses outside of their own de
partments for we feel that they would benefit from
such training. On the ether hand, the technical edu
cation at Stanford can hardly be called specialized
or termed one leading to a great amount of facility in
any one narrow field. The average engineering stu
dent finds upon graduation that he must learn in the
field more than 75 percent of the information he must
Â«pply; hi.s training has only been in valuable broad
background material.
The Daily's choice of an illustration for their edi
torial is most unfortunate because the engineering
student at Stanford spends one quarter hour in the
machine shop out of better than 190 quarter units re
quired. The choice of an illustration might well have
been a shot of the engineering library and one of the
motion picture rooms in Cubberley where some stu
dents learn the intricacies of threading a movie pro
jector.
It might bs further suggested that more non-tech
nical students avail themselves of facilities available
to learn more about the technical side of the modern
conveniences we use in everyday living. Time so
spent would very likely increase the average Stanford

student's appreciation of the world we live in.

liberal education unrealistic
To the Editor:
In defense of my three-line harangue against lib
eral education. I would like to expand a little on the
statement I made for the Daily last Friday. I do not
believe in a liberal education for all. It seems as un
realistic to me to expect everyone to interest himself
in, or benefit from, a liberal education, as it is to de
mand from all of us a mastery of the banjo. Isn't, it
more logical that students whose interests are special
ized are better served by pursuing their specialty than
by hopefully expecting them to be transformed into
broad-minded men and women through a liberal
arts program?
The engineer who complains of an inability to pur
sue an interest in liberal arts might be wiser to ex
amine his inclination towards engineering before he
condemns specialized education for its demands on his
time. It is not the responsibility of a specialized edu
cation to provide the individual with enough time,
money, or elective units, to wander through an un
related field. I have often heard that a specialized
education will soon produce a society of mechanized
minds and a dearth of leadership. Perhaps this is
true, but civilisation has struggled this far and still
produces its share of leaders and geniuses from the
ranks of men who never hoard a Civ. lecture or strug
gled through English 2B.
