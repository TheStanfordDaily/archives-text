### STEW TOY 
To a Victorian society which
had all the answers, Charles
Darwin's calm announcement ol
man's real place in the Great
Scheme of Things burst like a
thunderstorm on a July garden
paity.
Crucified a:s anti-God in a mil
lion minds, Darwin, with the help
of his oratorical partner-in-icono
cla.-m, Thomas Huxley, had unbal
anced i mug Philistia's "instant of
monumental equilibrium" with his
mundane, factual thumb, and few
people were willing to let him get
away with it.
As Professor William Irvine of the
English Department points out in
his new book, "Apes, Angels, and
Victorian ," Darwin's great study
"placed him directly athwart almost
every great i;:sue in philosophy,
ethics, and religion."
But Darwin, a devout Christian
al! his life, had no desire to de
stroy the complacency of society.
Shy, withdrawn, and ploddingly sci
entific, he had neither planned nor
wanted to write the monumental
work that was to become "the great
est book of the century."
But he was forced, by a pile of
evidence he could not ignore, to
begin formulating his now-famous
theory of evolution through selec
itve adaptation. And the more he
thought, the more entangled in the
problem he became.
With his book s publication, Dar
win was immediately ridiculed on
all sides. Wags began asking if it
was "through his grandfather or his
grandmother that he claimed his de
scent from a monkey?"

The clergy became his most vio
' lent attackers, for the Bible hud
J long been considered a biological
and geological treatise, and anyone
supplanting its authority was guilty
of sacrilege.
In the midst of his infamy, the
meek little Darwin, whose only
worries while writing his book had
been a fear of alienating the church,
i being laughed at, and being" antici
pated, was rescued by the impas
sioned oratory of Thomas Huxley.
Huxley, a captivating speaker and
j an original scientist in his own right,
| became the "field general" of the
' cause, defending Darwinism from
the halls of Oxford to the chapels of
country churches.
Huxley's brilliant campaign "cre
j ated a legend, both for himsetf and
for Darwin, founded a new ptriest
j hood, and very nearly made Eng
| land a scientific nation."
Irvine has a scholarly and enter
| taining work to his credit in "Apes,
Angels," and Victorians."
The book's main importance is in
its lucid and'lively account of the
change in the thought of an era; of
the Victorian's sudden realization
j that he was not the perfect culmina
tion of a divine plan of creation.
Its reception by the critics has
been unanimously enthusiastic. As
Joseph Henry Jackson said in the
San Francisco Chronicle: "This is
Pulitzer material, make no mistake
about it. I hope to be able to remind
you of that prophecy about this time
next year."
