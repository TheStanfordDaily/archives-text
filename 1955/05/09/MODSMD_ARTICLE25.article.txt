# Lawyers Teed Off By Lady Linkster
## 
### 
The so-called "weaker" sex led
the law school faculty t:> a crushing
5-4 victory on the golf links Fri
day. The legal prof-, beat their very
own second-year -stud nt in a chal
lenge match on the Stanford com e,
and Jacqueline Bartell of the fac
ulty team was by far tii.j "be t on
the links."'
In accepting the second - year
men's challenge, the professors dis
played raw courage. As an ob
server said, "They could have taken
on the older students for an easy
victory. By the time they've had the
students longer they have them
under better control or at least
they've worn them out .somewhat."
The victors haven't made plans
for any new conquests at this writ
ing.
