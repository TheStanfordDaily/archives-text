# Young Hurls Indians to 5-4 Victory
## 
### DICK NICHOLS 
Ray Young allowed only two
earned runs as the Stanford
horsehiders defeated Cal last
Friday, 5-4. Young also account
ed for one of the Stanford runs
with a triple.
Cal jumped off to a quick 2-0 lead
in the first 2V> innings, tallying once
in both the second and the third.
Both runs were unearned and Young
deserved a much better fate, for his
mates committed five errors behind
him in each of those innings. Young's
triple came in the last of the third,
after whicft he was squeezed home
by Sid Hall's perfect bunt.
The Indians scored once again in
the fifth, when with two out, Hall
walked and scored on the hit and
run as Mickey Holzman doubled to
right-center.
Then in the seventh Stanford op
ened up for what proved to be the
necessary runs for the win. Hal
Messner led off with a single to left.
Hall laid down a bunt attempting to
sacrifice Messner to second, but Doug
Weiss, the Cal pitcher, threw high
to first and Hall was safe on the
error.
Rich Scramaglia then lined a
single through the box to drive in
both Messner and Hall. Weiss saved
himself from further anguish by
getting Rudy Figueroa to bounce in
to a double play and Bill Evans to
ground out, pitcher to first.
Cal came roaring back in the top
of the eighth, and it looked for a
time as if the Bears might drive
Young from the mound. Dick Anient
led off the inning with a single
through the middle. After second
baseman Don Walker popped up to
Figueroa at third, A 1 Kyte and.
Lloyd Canton lined singles between
first and second to fill the bases.
Young got John Derdivanis to pop
up to Scramaglia in back of second
base, but Ron Gaggero, Cal's lead
ing hitter, singled through the box,
scoring both Anient and Kyte.
