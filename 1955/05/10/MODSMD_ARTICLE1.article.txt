# Thinclads Host Trojans Today
## DSC favored In 6 p.m. Meet 
### BOB DURAND 
The trackmen of Stanford and
USC will collide this afternoon :
at Stanford Stadium in a meet
that was originally scheduled for ;
April 23, but was postponed be
cause of rain.
The field events are due to start
at 5:45 p.m., while the first race
will start at 6.
Student admission is 50 cents.
The meet will be the last dual
competition of the season for both
teams. Since their original post
ponement, both the Trojans and the
Indians have competed twice and
both schools have added two I
triumphs t.o their credit.
Two weeks ago the men of Troy |
traveled to Texas where they i
trampled Texas, Texas A&M, and
Southern Methodist. Last Saturday !
they knocked olf UCLA, which 1
earlier edged the Cards, by a 7D-52
count.
MUST WINS
The Indians, on the other hand,
have had two comparatively easy
meets, as they whipped San Jose
State and California by 32 and 33
points, respectively.
During the two weeks, the two
squads have improved their marks
in every event, but the Tribe claims i

the advantage in this respect. Be
cause of this, the meet figures to be
closer than did the original meeting.
However, the USC cindermen will
still be heavily favored to take the
meet and keep their string of 18
straight victories over the Stanfords
intact. The Figueroa Streeters will
also be putting a long record of
consecutive dual triumphs on the
line today.
CON TESTED KIVALItI ES
Several hotly-contested rivalries
will be brought to a head during
the competitions. The 440-yard run,
the two dashes, and the two hurdles
should all prove to be high points
of the day as far as close events are
concerned.
The Indians' Walt Garrett has cur
rently recorded the second best 440
time in the country this spring at
