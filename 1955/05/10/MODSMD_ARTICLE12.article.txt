# Legislature Candidates State Views, Purposes
## 
### 
Twenty-one candidates are contesting for positions in the newly- :
created ASSU Legislature from five constituenciesâ€”Stern, Men's
Row, Union Units, Women's Row, and Off-Campus.
The Daily contacted each of the 21 for the statements which
follow:

STERN
Holt McFarland, '57: I believe the
most important duty (is) to fairly
interpret (legislation) for Stern
Council . . . then vote according to
the will of the council.
I
Joe Pool, '56: I would like to see
the final (ASSU) power reside with
the Legislature. The main problem
will be keeping the legislative pro
cess efficient and thus effective.
Torn Tilton, '56: Under the new
constitution the representative must
report to the living group of the
business of the Legislature and to
specifically aid the president of the
ASSU in legislation. . . .
Don Woodward, '57: I would like
to . . . get (Stern men's) suggestions
about issues . . . and to relieve con
fusion and red tape in the Legisla
ture by having committees discuss
and submit their findings on issues.
MEN'S ROW
Jerry Fuller, Theta Xi: The need
for more representation of the Row
can't be overlooked. With 700 to
800 persons living in fraternities
. . . the Row should have three rep
resentatives at least.
John Hancock, ATO: Since fra
ternities will have twice as many
votes in the new Legislature than
under the old system, I think (ASSU
action concerning the Row without
the Row having anything to say
about it) can be stopped.
Jim Kelland, Phi Kap: (The
duties of the Row representative
are) to act as a liason between the
Legislature and the fraternities and
to stimulate active interest . . .
among the fraternities.
Hill Lund, Sigma Chi: The more
representation there is, the more
chances there will be to have the
opinion expressed of the . . . Row.
Neil Papiano, Phi Delt: We can
derive many benefits from a greater
voice, and hope we can take ad
vantage of it (with) greater par
ticipation from the Row in school
activities.
John.Scarborough, Theta Delt: At
the present time, a gap is widening
between fraternity and student gov
ernment groups. It is cspeceially
important that this gap be filled . . .
Hill SouverolT, SAE: I feel that
too much unwarranted pressure is
put on fraternities, and I would like
to see their positions strengthened.
Sherman Wclpton, Fiji: The new
constitution will eliminate the prob
blem of many groups with cross
purposes, and it will tend to tighten
and unify the student government.

UNION UNITS
Sue Coshow, '57: it would be my
responsibility (to bring) the incli
dual in direct contact with the sep
arate governing bodies and (to
cause) the Legislature to recognize
the voice of the student . . .
Janet Katz, '5(5: Having . . .
worked, indirectly, on the revised
constitution ... I should like to be
a member of the legislative body
which will establish new policy and
precedent . . .
Sydney Little, '57: In accordance
with the enthusiasm demonstrated
by the ratification of the new con
stitution, I am especially anxious
for . . . Union Units and Ventura to
fee! well represented in the Legis
lature.
Marilyn Miller, *56: (After a year's
thorough study of student govern
ment) we accepted the new consti
tution ... I would like to have the
challenge and honor of working with
it in its trial year.
OFF-CAMPUS
Paul Jewell, '58: My First job
would be to ;ee that the opinions of
off-campus groups are taken into
consideration when policy is being
made.
Elsie Peters, '57: I would try to
contact as many (off-campus) stu
dents as possible to get some indi
cation of their opinion. (Thus) in
terest in student government will
probably rise.
WOMEN'S ROW
Nancy Vvnull, '56: If I am elected
. . . I will endeavor to help estab
lish precedents and develop the
forthcoming by-laws to Ihe better
ment, of the student body and the
Row in particular.
Mimi Maddocks, '5(5: By straw
votes through the house president
. . . I hope to get a consensus . . .
of Row girls before voting on is
sues. . . .
Margy McNair, '57: I . . . feel
challenged . . . by the new consti
tution and the opportunities it of
fers. The development of the Legis
lature and the Cabinet requires in
terested and qualified student lead
ers.
