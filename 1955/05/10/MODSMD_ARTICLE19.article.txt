# constitution to be built
## 
### 
For the second time within a month, stu
dents will vote in an ASSU election today,
tomorrow, and a week from now, and the
issue is the same one today which confronted
the voters on Apiil 19: What kind of student
government do you want at Stanford?
We have a new ASSU constitution, ap
proved by the student body three weeks ago.
But what is a constitution? Not just words on
paper. A constitution exists in interpreta
tions, practices, usage ... in the traditional
procedure of a government. Exactly what
our new constitution is cannot be deter
mined by reading. Next fall when Legisla
ture, Cabinet, and President begin the work
of making the new government function, we
will learn what this new constitution of ours
really means. It is the role of the first offi
cers under the new documents to set the pat
terns and make the judgements which will
bring the constitution off the paper and into
reality.
For this reason this is not an ordinary elec
tion. Nor can we be satisfied in choosing
ordinary people for the executive and legis
lative positions up for eleciion. This is not
the time to vote for "Max because he's a gcod
guy and it'll do the club some good," or
"Mabel because her posters are so cute."
We need student leaders in the fullest sense
of leadership, to set the pace and the direc
tion for the new constitution.
Most important, perhaps, is the choice of
an ASSU president. With wide executive
powers and an expanded executive branch,

the president will have a great influence
on the course of the new student govern
ment. The Daily asked each candidate for
this office several questions in regard to the
office and the role of student government
and the studen's whose government it is.
You will find the answers each candidate
gave printed on this page. Look at the
answers to the questions which particularly
interest you. They all concern you. These
answers, submitted in written form, repre
sent thought and opinion which has been
carefully considered by each candidate.
They should afford good indications as to the
type of approach to student government
which each candidate would favor.
In yesterday's Daily and again in today's,
you can find statements by and articles about
many of the candidates. Study these state
ments. In relation to central student govern
ment, note particularly the attitudes and
opinions of the candidates who, if elected,
will represent you on the Legislature next
fall. Remember that the Vice President must
take an active part in all phases of student
government, and look over the candidates'
statements.
Combine the information you find here
with impressions from the speeches you
have heard and from the personal meetings
you have had with the candidates. Vote for
what the candidates are and what they rep
resent.
Here is a constitution to be built—and here
is your opportunity to choose the builders.
Choose wisely.

ordinary people for the executive and legis
lative positions up for eleciion. This is not
the time to vote for "Max because he's a gcod
guy and it'll do the club some good," or
"Mabel because her posters are so cute."
We need student leaders in the fullest sense
of leadership, to set the pace and the direc
tion for the new constitution.
Most important, perhaps, is the choice of
an ASSU president. With wide executive
powers and an expanded executive branch,

the president will have a great influence
on the course of the new student govern
ment. The Daily asked each candidate for
this office several questions in regard to the
office and the role of student government
and the studen's whose government it is.
You will find the answers each candidate
gave printed on this page. Look at the
answers to the questions which particularly
interest you. They all concern you. These
answers, submitted in written form, repre
sent thought and opinion which has been
carefully considered by each candidate.
They should afford good indications as to the
type of approach to student government
which each candidate would favor.
In yesterday's Daily and again in today's,
you can find statements by and articles about
many of the candidates. Study these state
ments. In relation to central student govern
ment, note particularly the attitudes and
opinions of the candidates who, if elected,
will represent you on the Legislature next
fall. Remember that the Vice President must
take an active part in all phases of student
government, and look over the candidates'
statements.
Combine the information you find here
with impressions from the speeches you
have heard and from the personal meetings
you have had with the candidates. Vote for
what the candidates are and what they rep
resent.
Here is a constitution to be built—and here
is your opportunity to choose the builders.
Choose wisely.
For the second time within a month, stu
dents will vote in an ASSU election today,
tomorrow, and a week from now, and the
issue is the same one today which confronted
the voters on Apiil 19: What kind of student
government do you want at Stanford?
We have a new ASSU constitution, ap
proved by the student body three weeks ago.
But what is a constitution? Not just words on
paper. A constitution exists in interpreta
tions, practices, usage ... in the traditional
procedure of a government. Exactly what
our new constitution is cannot be deter
mined by reading. Next fall when Legisla
ture, Cabinet, and President begin the work
of making the new government function, we
will learn what this new constitution of ours
really means. It is the role of the first offi
cers under the new documents to set the pat
terns and make the judgements which will
bring the constitution off the paper and into
reality.
For this reason this is not an ordinary elec
tion. Nor can we be satisfied in choosing
ordinary people for the executive and legis
lative positions up for eleciion. This is not
the time to vote for "Max because he's a gcod
guy and it'll do the club some good," or
"Mabel because her posters are so cute."
