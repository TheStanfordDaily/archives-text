# dinnertime special..... an editorial

### 
If the rams stay away, Stanford will host
Southern California in that twice-postponed
track meet this afternoon. This is the meet that
lias been dubbed the "Commuters' Special" or
the ' Daylight Saving Special."
But lor student track fans it would be more
logically called the "Dinnertime Special."
That's because the field events get underway
at 5:45 and the mile at 6 in the p.m.
As you might assume, the commercial im
pulse is behind this unusual starting hour. The
SC track team, the best in the nation, is an
excellent drawing card. And revenue is not to
be sneered at.
Thus the meet has been scheduled at an
hour which may help attract commuters and
other Peninsula working men through the Sta
dium turnstiles. This is both good business and
qood public relations.
But the students like to think that the Uni
versity is for the students. And it seems ob
vious that an athletic team composed of stu

dents and representative of students should
cater first of all to students.
So the Athletic Department schedules the
bulk of the meet for the dinner hour. The din
ner hour is not flexible for students who eat on
campus.
The Athletic Department has proposed a so
lution—a solution which is more of an affront
to the majority of students than the decision
to run the meet at dinner time. In a presump
tious recommendation in these pages Friday,
the Athletic Department suggested that the din
ner hour be moved up to allow students to get
to the meet.
In effect, the remedy for inconveniencing a
thousand or so student track fans is to incon
venience three thousand other students by
changing their dinner hour.
As it stands, the track fan has a choice of
either dinner or the meet. Unless the Athletic
Department decides to serve a hot plate be
tween the high hurdles and the half mile.
