Student body elections are taking up space
in a great many college papers right now, but
several colleges have different ways of ap
proaching the matter.
The University o'f Washington, according to
the Washington Daily, is trying quiet. All cam
paigning is going on without noise. Parades
move about on tiptoe, and the loudest possible
demonsrtation in favor of a candidate is a
whisper.
The University of Southern California also
lias a new wrinkle in its election procedure.
The "Immature Student Government" candi
date for vice-president of the Trojan student
body, challenged his opponent, in a statement
to the Daily Trojan, to a "spirit contest."
He announced his intention to "antenna-sit"
until he"( 1) won; (2) the antenna collapsed;
(3) or he was coated with bronze and made a
landmark."
His opponent gave no comment.
And Biigham Young University witnessed
the payment of the election bets made by var
ious class candidates in regard to the percent
age of their class voting in the election.
According to the Universe, the losers, ihe
senior and sophomore class presidents, cheer
fully swallowed the raw ostrich eggs and stood
still while pies v/ere thrown at them, but ihe
paper commented that there must be some oth
er way io avoid student apathy.
And the coffee is not good at Washington

State College. A letter to the editor of the Daily
Evergreen angrily protested the "bitter, black,
horrible . . . mud flow" to be found at ihe WSC
version of the Cellar.
The irate writer claimed that "nothing he had
ever found in the whole of the United States
and the Army" compared to that coffee. "May
be flouridalion would help," he concluded.
