DEN KENNEDY
Den Kennedy is 20, a jun
ior from San Jose. He is a
history major, a member of
Chi Psi fraternity, and lives
at Encina Hall.

On the ASSU level student gov
ernment is necessary to co-ordi
nate campus activities. It repre
sents student opinion. It muÂ§t
work for material improvements
in recreational facilities for stu
dents, in public relations, and in
other fields where student effort
is necessary. The primary duty is
to make sure that opinions ex
pressed by the legislature are
those of the students.
Extra benefits accrue to those
students who are willing to spend
some of their time in the educa
tional process of leadership and
organization.
The minimum standard for the
existence of any ASSU committee
should be accomplishments bene
iiting the student body and com
munity.

The president should be respon
sive to the student body and
should not limit his contacts to
those within student government,
for then it becomes their views
alone to which he responds. As
chief executive, it is his responsi
bility to see that ASSU commit
tees justify their existence in
terms of accomplishment for the
student body and the community.
In relations with the faculty and
administration, he should speak for
the interests of the students. Co
operation with both groups is es
sential, but special emphasis must
be put on remaining the students'
representative to the administra
tion and not the administration's
representative to the students.
As host to campus visitors, and
speaker to civic groups, the ASSU
president is often the basis by
which Stanford is judged.

The administrative assistant, the
-placement of managerial control of
finances under the president, and
the closer control of representa
tives by the students are particu
lar changes that may make gov
ernment more able to effect ac
complishment.
When organizational details need
to be changed to increase effec
tiveness of the government, then
they must be worked out, but
without fanfare. Constant re-eval
uation as proposed in (my) answer
5 is necessary.
The legislature must not be
come a rubber stamp. They should
not pass any cabinet proposal un
less they are convinced that it is
for the benefit of the students
whom they represent!

Generally good, but I do not
propose to criticize or justify the
present condition of student ac
tivities and organizations. Rather,
I propose to improve it.
Until Stanford is so perfect that
student effort is no longer useful,
committees must not exist for their
own sake. No committee not ben
efiting the student body and com
munity should carry the ASSU
name or receive ASSU funds.
Many students feel that their
government is not doing anything.
This is not because they haven't
heard of its organization and re
organization. The failure is that
at present they don't associate the
accomplishments with the source,
for instance Spring Sing and Rally
Com.
I propose to first clear out any
dead wood and then emphasize not
the machinery involved but the
accomplishments.

Th e administrative assistant
would provide the president with
the essential knowledge of ASSU
organizations. For example, he
would obtain extremely brief quar
terly reports from each of the
board and commission chairmen
stating what their committee is ac
complishing for the student body
and community. These reports
would be verified by the cabinet
and submitted to the legislature
for consideration in allocation of
ASSU funds.
The Student Financial Manager
would be given largely a free hand
in the management of finances
with any managerial decision sub
ject. to review by the President.

Students who undertake gradu
ate work usually have a high pre
mium on their time. They don't
feel that they care to participate in
anything that is purely busy work
and organization. This last is nec
essary but with the new constitu
tion it is now largely behind us.
It is now necessary to set a
standard of accomplishment which
will interest many of the gradu
ates in student government enough
so I hat they will offer their expe
rience and ability.

NATHAN J. LEANSE
Nathan J. Leanse is 21, a
junior from Los Angeles. He
is an economics major and a
member of Phi Kappa Psi fra
ternity.

ASSU government has three
functions: (1) to interpret princi
ples of conduct; (2) to initiate ac
tivities; (3) to co-ordinate these
activities, so that students with
the desire may participate.
Because of the Fundamental
Standard and the Honor Code,
Stanford students have great free
dom in establishing their own
rules. Since these rules were origi
nated by students, it is an ASSU
function to interpret them.
Such activities as the Concert
Series, the lIR, Ram's Head, and
the Political Union accrue from
ASSU government. Too many stu
dents, I believe, do not realize that
many activities like these are co
ordinated by ASSU.

The student body president has
two broad functions to perform:
First, the internal function of
heading the ASSU, and second, the
external function of representing
the student body to the faculty
and to the world.
In heading the government, he
is responsible for all executive de
cisions. With the aid of his cabi
net, he will present a comprehen
sive program and budget for the
year to the legislature. In addi
tion, as a voting member of the
legislature, it will be his challenge
to achieve approval of his program.
In executing the external func
tion, he must uphold the position
of the student body when meeting
with the faculty. Further, as en
voy to other schools and outside
groups, he must preserve the rep
utation of Stanford University.

Greater efficiency in government
will be the result of the new con
stitution. The pressure on the stu
dent body president will be eased
by his administrative assistant. The
cabinet will insure better co-ordi
nation of campus activities. And
finally, the legislature will bring
the students closer to the ASSU
because each living group repre
sentative has fewer constituents.
I believe there should be critical
inspection of the government peri
odically to determine its efficiency.
Criteria for criticism should be
formally composed by the first
legislature; a research division on
student government could then be
established using the criteria, plus
NSA information, to evaluate the
ASSU.

The condition of student activi
ties and organizations is excellent
because they are performing their
two important functions: first, ini
tiating activities; and second, co
ordinating activities, allowing those
with the desire to participate.
I believe that the shallow inter
est shown toward ASSU govern
ment in some quarters stems from
a general lack of knowledge of the
functions of ASSU government. To
some students, government means
only "Excom,'' not realizing thr.t
activities such as the Concert Se
ries, The Daily, the? Fundamental
Standard, plus more, are ;;11 part
of the ASSU structure. There
should be an educational program
during the freshman orientation
program, describing the structure,
the duties, and the results of AS
SU government so that a basic un
derstanding could be established.

It is said that the sign of a good
executive is the ability to delegate
authority. The administrative as
sistant, as chief of stuff and prin
cipal presidential assistant, pro
vides the president with the op
portunity to delegate authority ;o
that his overly busy schedule can
be more efficiently handled.
The Student Financial Manager
will be the financial expert not
only for the president, but for all
ASSU organizations. He shall con
trol the funds of the association in
accordance with the annual budg
et and policies he and the presi
dent have prepared.

The graduates, like all Stanford
students, are recipients of ASSU
activities, and therefore their in
fluence should be maintained an I
considered. Too many graduates
are under the misconception that
ASSU functions are for the under
graduate only; others, busy with
advanced work, can offer no ac
tive participation. These two fac
tors formulate the reason for gen
eral graduate disinterest in Stan
ford government. The role ol the
graduates in ASSU government
can only be in proportion to their
interest and to the time they can
devote.

DON PECK

from San Diego. He is an in
dustrial engineering major, a
member of Los Arcos club,
and lives at Toyon Hall.

The role of student government
at Stanford is to coordinate and
supervise our many .student activi
ties. Because of the iast turnover
in student offices and the limited
time, experience, and technical
proficiency 'i .student can give to
his government, it is necessary that
the ASSU promote cooperation, the
passing on of experience, and the
training of new personnel. The stu
dent v/ho participates in student
activities develops personal, public,
and professional responsibility. In
helping the student develop these
qualities through experience, lies
the purpo e and dignity of our stu
dent I'overnirient,

The ASSU president is the chief
representative of the student gov
ernment to every student. He is
personally responsible to every
student for the efficient leadership
and supervision oi' the ASSU. It is
his duty to maintain and promote
respect for the student government
among the students, the faculty,
and the administration. The pres
ident is the representative of the
ASSU to the rest of the world. In
his association with students of
other schools, civic groups, and
alumni organizations he must
maintain the high standard of
character which is expected of a
Stanford student,

Our new constitution is but a
piece of paperâa plan. It remains
for us to put this plan into prac
tice, to make it work. I believe
that the plan will work well, but
not without a concentrated effort
to establish it soundly. The pro
posed legislature is a large and
potentially unwieldy group. I am
sure that with good procedure, it
can operate efficiently. Care must
be taken, however, not to compli
cate the legislature's functioning
until the individual student can
no longer understand and partici
pate in the open session along with
his representative,

Student organizations are more
numerous and active than ever be
fore. We needed our now Consti
tution to keep up with the ex
pansion of student activities. In
the past the student's interest in
his government was hampered by
an obvious lack of coordination
within the ASSU. The new con
stitution is a plan to remedy this
situation. It provides for direct
communication between the legis
lative and administrative organi
zations. It (: 1 early defines the au
thority and responsibility of the
ASSU officers. With the new con
stitution, the student government
can Le built into ; n organization
which will he worthy of the stu
dent's respect, and his enthusiasm
as well.

The administrative assistant
would be an id ;'l person to gather
information for the president, to
attend meetings on behalf of the
president, to serve as recording
secretary for the cabinet, to plan
the agenda for the legislature, and
to nerve as presiding officer pro
tein of both the legislature and
cabinet. The Student Financial
Manager is the financial arm of
the ASSU. He assists the presi
dent in the administration ol ASSU
activities which involve expendi
ture of student funds. In this ca
pacity he is responsible to the
president, who in turn is respons
ible to the legislature, which de
fines the ASSU financial policies.

Many graduate students feel that
academic effort, and. perhaps, out
side employment should occupy
them entirely. Those graduate
students who are interested in their
student government are very valu
able to the ASSU. Graduate* stu
dents often lend stability and ex
perience to our student govern
ment. Graduate students face
many unique problems which may
be presented and understood only
with the help <>( Ihe I'.raduate rep
resentatives,

GEOUGH IMI TII

"How many angels will fit on
the head of a pin?" It has been
said that the Middle Ages were
devoted entirely to arguing such
questions as this. While sucli a
criticism is somewhat unfair to the
Middle Ages, it is not a bad illus
tration of what goes 011 at Excom
meetings. It seems to me that we
could dismiss a few officers and a
few dozen committees and never
know the difference. At least we
would find out what we actually
need under the existing system
and give the students a chance to
reinstate what if anything thr-y
wanted.

One of the biggest little things to
hit this campus was the debate
over joining NSA. We have been
a member of this outfit for a year,
and yet a bright new life has not.
opened up before me. For our
$1,100 six conventioners have a
ball; and yet, there was no way for
a student to affect this decision
without attending many meetings
and still having no vote. If a .stu
dent has something on his mind he
will more easily find means of ex
pression without the red tape ex
isting under the present hierarchy.
There would be a real value in de
formalizing the office of president,
in the realization that about his
most important function is as head
handshaker to ereet visitors.

The new constitution is a good
example of the growing bureauc
racy. A reading of it (and it is an
all-day job) discloses that instead
of the old Excom we now have
two bodies, legislature and cabi
net; and there is a morass of
boards and corns. If there are any
fresh sprouts in student govern
ment, we can't see them for all the
dead wood. And it is no use to
attempt to remove part of the rub
ble. Instead of allowing the legis
lature to create more committees
by voting by-laws, why not let the
students form whatever organiza
tions they find they need?
/

For the organizers and the fig
ureheads and the busybodies there
are all sorts of clubs and social or
ganizations. Those who are in
terested in debates and in activi
ties join specific groups, and these
groups successfully concern only
those whom they attract. That a
small minority is concerned about,
the working of student govern
ment, which theoretically reflects
general student opinion, is indi
cated by the fact that 26 per cent
of the students voted on the new
constitution. Perhaps student ju
dicial committees are a desired in
stitution; but they do not require
all the sub-committees and re
ports and by-laws, which actually
tend to confuse us as to where we
stand with the University. The
legislature can form new commit
tee: by a two-thirds vote; let's
give the say back to the students.

That things are getting worse is
indicated by the now office of "Ad
ministrative Assistant to the Pres
ident." It seems senseless to cre
ate new officers when the ones we
have now do not have anything
useful to do. We have a Student
Financial Manager (who appoints
assistants!) to help the University
â¢chosen Financial Director. This po
sition may help the administration
and may give students business
experience, but there is no need
for a constitution with a hundred
by-laws and multitudinous drivel
ing committees to deliberate on his
activities. Other schools have got.
along without this stuff for a long
time.

I think that the graduate .stu
dents are especially apathetic to
ward student government, and
witWgood reason. They have more
important things to do. But they,
along with the rest of us, pay for
ihe whole set-up without feeling
any benefit. I would like to offer
Stanford students a chance to do
heller with less.
