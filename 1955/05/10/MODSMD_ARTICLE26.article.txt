# Indian Crews Triumph Again
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
The Card oarsmen continued their
I winning ways last Saturday by
whipping the fast-improving USC
Trojanj' in the varsity and junior
varsity races on the San Pedro Har
bor course.
The Stanford varsity dispelled all
doubt of the validity of their easy
three-length victory over the Tro
jans three weeks ago on the Red
wood City Harbor course by over
coming a full-length deficit and go
ing on to register a length victory in
the featured race. The winning time
over the 2,000-meter course was a
slow 7:02.1 seconds; Southern Cal
was clocked at 7:07.4. â€¢
INDIAN SURGE
The contest between the two var
sity boats was the thriller of the day
as both eights got off on a 36-stroke
a-minute beat. The Trojans soon
established a length lead by keep
ing their stroke up while the In
dians dropped down to a smooth 31
beats per minute.
USC followed the example and
Coach Bob Hillen's boys were
matching the Cards stroke for stroke
at 31 as the shells approached the
quarter mark. At this point the
red-tipped oars of the Stahford eight
began to take in more and more
water and the distance between the
boats was fast diminishing.
At the 1,000-meter or half-way
point it was neck and neck and the
Indians were beginning to put on
the pressure. USC attempted game
ly to stay even with the now-Hying
Stanford .shell hut their efforts went,
for naught.
JV'S LOOK GOOD
The junior varsity race was also
closely contested but the greater
stamina of the Indian reserves pro
vided them with the finishing kick
which decided the outcome. Stroke
Hugh Dewitt responded to the urg
ings of little coxswain Kurt Seiffert
by raising the stroke to 34 in the
stretch drive. The winners covered
the distance in 7:14, some l 1 i lengths
ahead of the crimson-shirted Tro
jans.
The last race of the day saw the
frosh first boat row home to a con
vincing four - length victory over
'Orange Coast Junior College of San
Pedro. The frosh, undefeated in
three races this year, got off to a
Past start and never were threatened
by the less-experienced JC eight.
