## Indians Nip Cal In 10th 
### BILL NICHOLS Sports Editor, The Daily 
The Stanford Indians nipped
the University of California
Bears, 5-4 yesterday in a nerve
racking 10-inning thriller at Ed
wards Field.
Cai came from behind twice to
tie up the contest, once in the
eighth and again in the ninth. But
the Cards were equal to the task
and won the game with a single run
in the 10th.
Walt Payne started for Stanford
and pitched nicely for seven in
nings. Double plays in thp fifth,
sixth, and seventh kept Payne sail
ing along a 3-0 lead. But in the
eighth the roof fell in on the tiring
j outhpaw. Before Ray Young could
come in and put out the fire, the
Bears had tied up the game with
three runs.
Don Walker singled and moved to
third on two infield outs. But then
a walk, a double by Eon Gaggero,
and two singles finished Payne.
Young came in and Doug Stowell
was thrown out at home on a double
steal attempt to end the disasterous
inning.
Rudy Figueroa led the Card ninth
with a Texas League single and
moved to second on a sacrifice. Len
Swatz walked and Tom Dandurand
lined out his third hit of the day
to send Stanford into a short-lived
lead.
It looked like the end for the
Cards in the Cai half of the ninth.
Cai had one run in with the bases
loaded and Ron Gaggero the batter
had a three ball no strike count.
One more ball and the Bears would
have won. But Young, who beat
Cai, 5-4, last Friday, threw two
strikes and then tossed Gaggero out
at first.
The sturdy right-hander then
won his own ball game in the 10th
smashing a triple to the right field
wall. He scored the winning run
when Figueroa doubled to right.
