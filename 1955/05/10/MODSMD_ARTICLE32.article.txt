# Quaker to Speak On Compulsory Training Today
## 
### 
George Burcham, an Associate
Peace Secretary for the American
Friends Service Committee, will
speak today at 4 p.m. on the Na
tional Reserve Plan pending before
Congress.
If passed, the act would provide
compulsory military training during
an eight-year period for all young
able-bodied American men.
Burcham's talk, to be held on the
third floor of the Women's Club
house, will present the opposition of
the American Friends. They feel
that such a law would destroy
America's strength by basing it on
military might rather than on free
dom.
Refreshments will be served after
tlie talk, sponsored by the "Y." All
interested students are invited to at
tend.
