# Palo Altans Vote Today On Hospital
## Farm Supports Joint Financing 
### RUSS WILKS Managing Editor, The Daily 
The fate of the proposed Palo
Alto-Stanford hospital will be de
cided today when the voters of
Palo Alto go to the polls to vote
on a S4 million bond issue.
Palo Alto's City Council has come
*out in favor of establishing a new
city hospital next to Stanford's pro
posed campus medical school. Co
operative plans, tentatively worked
out, call for joint financing and con- |
struction of common facilities like
operating rooms, kitchens, etc. Palo
Alto and Stanford would build their
own hospitals from these core fa
cilities
CHANGE IN WORDING
Last June the city approved a $4
million bond which committed it to
expand its present building. The new
bond would void the original one
in wording only, making it possible
to use the money for the joint co
operation plan.
A two-thirds majority is required
for the bond's passage and final ap
proval by Stanford's Board of Trus
tees is necessary before definite steps
are taken toward the realization of
the project.
On the voting side more than 30
civic organizations have endorsed
the bond issue according to co
chairmen Warren Cook and Ralph
Cahn of the Citizens Hospital Com
mittee.
The expansion program was drop
ped by the city council when a sur
vey report recommended that co
operation with Stanford would pro
vide more beds, greater facilities and
room for expansion.
FARM BACKS PLAN
Stanford gave "unqualified sup
port" to the bond issue last week
in a statement issued by President
Wallace Sterling and Lloyd W.
Dinkelspiel, president of the Board
of Trustees. Stanford has already of
fered to spend as much as $1 million
for the joint core facilities if the
bond is approved.
The University has offered 25
acres to the city at a low rental
about a half-mile west of the pres
ent Palo Alto Hospital.
