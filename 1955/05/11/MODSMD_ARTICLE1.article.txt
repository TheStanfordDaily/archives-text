Besides the javelin, the Cards'
only other firsts were gained when
Bernie Nelson took the high hur
dles, Jim Luttrell the lo.w hurdles,
ami Frank Herrmann the broad
jump.
Nelson and Luttrell had little
trouble placing one-two in the high
sticks as SC's John Morgan finished
third about five yards back. The
winning time was :14.6. Luttrell
nosed out Troy footballer Leon
Clarke in the lows with a time of
:23.9.
Herrmann again surpassed his
"best-ever" jump when he leaped
24-1 to win with little trouble. Cards
Jim Seebold and Ed Fremouw tied
for third in that event at 23-1, a
mark which was the former's all
time best by 10 inches.
The Tribe gained a lone sweep in
the javelin throw. John Bugge
placed second behind Kimball with
a heave of 225-11 V2, while gridder
Hank Roldan sailed the spear 214—
6% for third. These three trackmen
