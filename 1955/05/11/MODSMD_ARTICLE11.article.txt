# CITY ELECTION
## Palo Altans Approve Hospital 
### 
Palo Alto voters approved the
$4 million bond issue yesterday
which gave the green light for
Stanford and the city to co-oper
ate on a joint hospital construc
tion program.
Forty-five per cent of the 17,039
registered voters turned out to par
ticipate in the biennial municipal
election as they kept the polls busy
from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
The new bond issue actually re
places one passed last year in word
ing only. A year ago the city voted a
$4 million bond issue which dictated
the expansion of the present Palo
Alto Hospital. None of those bonds
were sold, however, as the city made
a study of the feasibility of joining
with Stanford in a building pro
gram. This study proved favorable
and the City Council endorsed the
plan.
HOSPITAL PLANS
The plan entails the using of joint
core facilities like X - ray rooms,
kitchens, operating rooms, etc., by
the University and Palo Alto. The
two interests will build their own
hospitals, however, on a campus site
about a half-mile west of Palo Alto
Hospital.
Conferences with an architect
have been going on and all that is
needed to make the program official
is the stamp of approval by Stan
ford's Board of Trustees. This is ex
pected to be more or less automatic
since Board President Lloyd W.
Dinkelspiel came out last week in a
concurrent statement with Wallace
Sterling, University president, that
Stanford favored the bond issue.
CIVIC ENDORSEMENT
The hospital bonds were the only
non-controversial issue in the elec
tion, as many civic groups had pre
viously endorsed the measure.
Both Palo Alto and Stanford are
expected to reap benefits from the
program such as lower costs by the
common sharing of facilities and the
benefit of a common sharing of med
ical knowledge.
No estimate was made as to when
actual construction would begin.
Stanford has a goal of approximately
$15 million to reach before it starts
on its medical school dream.
