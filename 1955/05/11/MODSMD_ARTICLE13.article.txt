### 
In an unusually large turnout of voters, 2,373 students cast their
ballots yesterday in the first day of ASSU primary elections.
Voting booths will be open today from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at
the Main Library, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the Village, and 9:45 to 10:05
a.m. and 10:45 to 11:05 a.m. at the graduate booth located between

the Law and Business Schools.
The freshmen led the other classes
in number of voters yesterday with
701. Approximate figures for the
other classes showed 567 juniors, 531
sophomores, 340 seniors, and 230
graduates.
Election Board chairman Eric
Flicker commented that these fig
ures indicate a probable record
turnout in the two-day election.
Today's balloting will probably
decide the offices of head cheer
leader, and off-campus representa-

tive to the Legislature, as there are
only two candidates for each of
these offices.
If any candidate receives a ma
jority of the votes for his office, no
final election will be held for that
office.
Results of the primaries will be
announced in Cubberley Audito
rium at 5:30 p.m. today.
Students mu.st present student
body cards in order to vote. All
voters are reminded by Election
Board to check both class and liv
ing group on the list provided at the
polls.
Each voter may cast three votes
for Men's or Women's Council mem
bers, but ballots will be counted if
one, two, or three names are
marked.
Students will vote for the Legisla
ture representative from their pres
ent living group, even if they in
tend to move next year.
