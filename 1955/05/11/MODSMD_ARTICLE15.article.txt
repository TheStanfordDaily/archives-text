# Decisions on Scholarships Are Delayed
## 
### 
Decisions on registered under
graduate awards have been post
poned until July by the University
scholarship office.
Mrs. Olivia Byler, scholarship
secretary, explained that in making
the awards students' complete grade
totals up to the end of spring quar
ter will be considered in figuring
overall grade averages as basis for
awards.
Reason for the delay, according to
Mrs. Byler, is that the scholarship
committee has decided to wait until
applicants' spring quarter grades are
out to make this year's awards.
All students who have applied
will be notified as to whether or no!
they have been granted an award
by the end of July, Mrs. Byler said,
and emphasized that no applicants
will be considered until the comple
tion of spring quarter.
