EARTHQUAKE REMNANTS - Columns 'hat once supported a Stanford building and were ruined
in the earthquake of 1906 are turned up as workmen clear out rubble for the construction of a
bridge across San Francisquito Creek. The collapsed pillars and other wreckage were moved
to the creek area after the earthquake.
