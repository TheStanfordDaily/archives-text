Arid "responsible leadership," Mr. Cohen, requires
the ability to make vaKie judgments, which can only
be based on a BROAD as well as deep l'ramework

consider the tragic and much belabored case of J.
Robert Oppcnheimer- undoubtedly one of the most
brilliant scientists alive BUT, a man who could tell

the loss of his services, a great deal.
I hope that Mr. Cohen arid everyone who feels as
he doe:; will think again before they condemn liberal
education. Human problems (the only significant
problems for civilization) cannot be dealt with by
the use of measui ing instruments, and anyone both
ering to examine the Curriculums of even such
"coldly technical" schools as M.I.T. and Caltech
will find a great emphasis on a truly liberal educa
tion. Finally, I think that Mr. Cohen has drawn a
coifelu ion that he doesn't believe himself when he
implies that liberal education (hearing a civ lecture
or struggling through English 2I>) is of no benefit in
producing better leaders for civilization. Rut, if he
does believe this, and il he feels that the University's
liberal arts requirements are really hindering his
"specialized education," then may 1 l.e so hold as to
inquire why he came to Stanford in the first pl/iee?

To the Editor:
Afti i some not-too-prolonged observations, it would
seem that there is something common to the engineer,
the medical student, the lawyer, and the professor.
They are, one and all, men.
Granted that man has a purpose for existence and
the capacity tu achieve that goal, it is his obligation
to see to it that his capacities are realized. This task
may b accomplished, never forgetting his end in life,
l,y a study of Cod, of man, of society, of himself.
These studies are commonly the subject matter of lib
eral arts courses.
r I bus, to realize their capacities as men, the doctor,
the lawyer, and the engineer owe it to themselves to
be well versed in the liberal arts, lest they lose sight
of their goal.
This does not mean that the "realized" man cannot
be an engineer, too. For engineer and man are the
same person.
Who is more important, who should receive more
training, the engineer or the man of which he is
made? Your answer depends on how well you have
understood what liberal arts training you have had.

To the Editor:
Afti i some not-too-prolonged observations, it would
seem that there is something common to the engineer,
the medical student, the lawyer, and the professor.
They are, one and all, men.
Granted that man has a purpose for existence and
the capacity tu achieve that goal, it is his obligation
to see to it that his capacities are realized. This task
may b accomplished, never forgetting his end in life,
l,y a study of Cod, of man, of society, of himself.
These studies are commonly the subject matter of lib
eral arts courses.
r I bus, to realize their capacities as men, the doctor,
the lawyer, and the engineer owe it to themselves to
be well versed in the liberal arts, lest they lose sight
of their goal.
This does not mean that the "realized" man cannot
be an engineer, too. For engineer and man are the
same person.
Who is more important, who should receive more
training, the engineer or the man of which he is
made? Your answer depends on how well you have
understood what liberal arts training you have had.
