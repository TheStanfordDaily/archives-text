WASHINGTON, May 10 â€” The
Western Big Three today invited
Soviet Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin
to an "early" meeting with Presi
dent Eisenhower and British and
French heads in a new "effort to re
move the sources of conflict between
us."
Mr. Eisenhower underscored this
country's sincerity by telling a
group of Republican women he is
willing In "meet with anyone, any
where" if there was the "slightest
. . . chance of furthering this great
cause of peace."
The U.S. agreement to seek a
chief-01-stale meeting with Russia

marked a shift in President Eisen
hower's attitude. He long has indi
cated unwillingness to attend such a
conference unless advance prospects
of success were attained in lower
level conferences.
