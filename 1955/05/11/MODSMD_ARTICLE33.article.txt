### BILL NICHOLS' Sports Editor, The Daily 
Fort Orel knocked the Stan
ford Indians off the victory trail

Indians, who played flawless
baseball on Monday while win
ning a 10-inning 5-4 victory over
Cal, booted seven chances
against the soldiers.
Both teams pounded out 10 hits,
but the errors spelled the difference.
Starter Ed Verdurmen was the loser
for Stanford, and Harold Dodeward
received credit for the win.
Stanford scored first on two hits
after there were two outs. Rudy Fi
gueroa hit a double down the left
field line, and Bob Evans scored him
with a single, but Fort Ord came
back with two of their own in the
fourth.
The Cards tied up the game in the
bottom of the fourth when Evans
singled. Len Swartz ,was hit by the
pitcher, and Tom Dandurand Jpeat
out a sacrifice bunt to load the

bases. But the hapless Stanfords
could only squeeze one run out of
the frame. Hal Messner hit a high
bouncer to the mound and Dode
ward had no play except at first, as
Evans scored. Sid Hall then struck
out and Verdurmen was an easy out
to end the threat.
Three errors and two hits served
to give the visitors their tie-break
ing duo in the fifth. Verdurmen,
Messner, and Evans each contrib
uted "skulls."
