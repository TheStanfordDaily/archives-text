# Spring Sing Boasts 15 – Year Tradition
## 
### BRAD LEONARD 
Take a novel suggestion, work it over until it meets with ap
proval, temper it with fifteen years' time, and you find yourself
with a tradition.
In such a manner did Stanford's annual Spring Sing come into
being and eventually grow to be such an enthusiastically received

event that, today it ranks with sueh
Farm traditions as Con Home Week
and Big Game.
Credit for originating the idea for
the Sing belongs to Tom Howard,
member of the 1940-41 Rally Com
mittee, who thought a campus-wide
song f'est would be a suitable activ
ity for giving the members of Rally
Com a project for the remainder of
the year after football season was
over.
SPRING EVENT
The idea of having the Sing dur
ing spring quarter rather than win
ter quarter was approved by Rally
Com members, and Lawrence Frost
Amphitheater was chosen as the
logical setting for the event.
The first Sing, in wnich 25 campus
groups participated, was held on
May 7, 1941. and the Stanford Med
School began what has proved to be
a 15-year unbroken winning streak
by walking away with the Men's
Division trophy for their original
selection entitled "Fair Stanford."
15-YEAR HISTORY
During the 15 years since its in
ception, Spring Sing audiences have
witnessed many a memorable per
formance. Even the threat of a pos
sible bombing attack during the
years of World War II didn't di
minish the enthusiasm of each audi
ence or the quality of performance,
and each year there always seems
to be a humorous occurrence to
mark the evening's entertainment.
Usually it is nothing more than a
stray dog putting in an appearance
at an inappropriate time, but ocea

sionally there will be a particularly
amusing incident—for example, the
celestial co-operation the Guthrie-
Delta Tau Delta entry received in
1953 when it sang "Singin' in the
Rain" to the accompaniment of an
actual shower.
The idea of having only 15 partici
pants in each group was eventually
abandoned, and the number of divi
sions, which originally was only two
—a Men's and a Women's—was ex
panded to include a Novelty and
Mixed division and a Grand Sweep
stakes trophy for the best overall
performance.
Community singing, which
marked the first few Sings, was
eventually dropped due to time lim
itations, and the idea of having
torches to light up the amphitheater
was considered too risky both for
the amphitheater and also for the
spectators and was banned by the
University in 1946.

MATCH CEREMONY
The most novel innovation of the
Sing was made in ilfctW-with the idea
of having each person in the audi
ence light a match simultaneously.
The match lighting ceremony has
almost become a tradition in itself
and it never fails to bring a chorus
of oh's and all's from audiences each
year.
Some of the aspects of this year's
Sing will be different from those
which have existed in the past, but
one aspect of the Sing will never
change. A person gets the feeling of
having had an evening of real en
tertainment.
It is this feeling which established
the Spring Sing as an annual event
and which has perpetuated it down
through the years to the position it
now holds—a widely recognized and
highly acclaimed Stanford tradition.
