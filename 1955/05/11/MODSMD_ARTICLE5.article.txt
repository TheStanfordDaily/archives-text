# Congress Shelves Bill for Statehood
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - A sharply split
House voted 218 to 170 today to deny
statehood to Hawaii and Alaska. The
vote apparently dooms statehood
hopes of the two territories for at
least two more years.
The House killed the measure by
sending it back to a House Interior
Committee pigeonhole. Friends and
foes alike conceded there was little
chance of reviving the issue in the
current Congress.
