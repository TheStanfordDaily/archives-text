# Woman Student Put on Probation
## 
### 
Women's Council recently placed
a Stanford woman on probation for
the rest of the quarter because of a
Fundamental Standard violation.
The woman had returned to her
residence one hour and 45 minutes
beyond her sign-out because she
had fallen asleep in a man's apart
ment.
Although her conduct did not ap
pear in any way to be morally
wrong, the situation must be looked
upon in relation to the group, not
just the individual. This behavior is
not sanctioned as acceptable con
duct, Council explained.
Until recent years, women's social
regulations included the "lone wom
an rule," which made it unaccept
able for a woman alone to enter any
man's residence. Under that provi
sion. a woman could not even enter
a men's dormitory to hang a poster.
This restriction was changed in
1953, but gives Stanford women the
additional responsibility to deter
mine the appearance of their ac
tions.
