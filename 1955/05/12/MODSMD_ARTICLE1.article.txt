tional relations, said after his vie- |
tory:
"To say the least, I am extremely
pleased at being elected yell leader.
Bui always accompanying victory
there is the grave responsibility i
which taking office entails. I am j
cognizant of this fact and accept the i
challenge which the position of Yell
Leader offers. I'll attempt in all my
words and actions to be a repre
sentative of whom the student body
can be proud.
"All too often we, as students, are
critical observers, but rarely do we
form our criticism into suggestions
from which constructive improve
ments and innovations can be ex- j
traded. I would greatly appreciate
any criticisms regarding any phase
of yell leading. This is the only i
method by which we can continue to j
be dynamic.

"As the campaign progressed and
I became better acquainted with my
opponent, Joe Critchfield, my re
spect for him grew proportionately
and I'm certain that we'll pool our
ideas concerning yell leading.
"Without the aid of two groups I
would not have been elected and to
these people I am greatly indebted.
The first are those who actively cam
paigned for me and the second are
those who put their faith in me by
placing an X on the ballot.
"To both of these groups I am
deeply grateful and I will sincerely
do my best to live up to the faith
and trust which the student body
has placed in me."
Jewett, the new ofT-campus repre
sentative, is a freshman from Menlo
Park and Miss Maddocks, Women's
Row representative, a junior from
Aptos majoring in history. She lives
at Roth House.
The three will take office in Sep
