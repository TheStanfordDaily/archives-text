## UMT Apathy Is 'Conformity' 
### SYDNEY LITTLE 
George Burcham, Associate Peace
Secretary of the American Friends
Service Committee, spoke here
Tuesday in opposition to the Na
tional Reserve Act which is now be
fore Congress.
Four students cfttended.
The apathy demonstrated by
Stanford students toward universal
military training is typical of col
lege students and the general public,
according to Burcham. He attrib
uted lack of interest to a basic
American drive to conform which
has built up from a fear of Russian
Communism, and from the 14-year
Selective Service program â€” "mili
tary training which has destroyed,
in part, our willingness to be criti
cal."
The bill, which is scheduled to go
before the House of Representatives
tomorrow, would set up a program
whereby all men between 17 and IS
could volunteer for six months of
military training followed by seven
and one-half years in the reserves,
and all men under 35 would be
classified as reserves for six years.
Burcham argued that the bill is
not necessary from a military point
of view. "As long as we have these
nibbling wars like Korea and the
threat of atomic warfare, we need
highly trained technicians, not a
mass army. During the Korean war
only 250 thousand of the two mil
lion men inducted were actually
needed."
Although Burcham said that he
believed the military to be sincere
in their aims, he suggested that the
desire of universal military training
is an effort to gain control of the
American public.
