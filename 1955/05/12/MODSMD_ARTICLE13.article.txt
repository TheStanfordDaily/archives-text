# Prof Discusses 'European Mentality'

"Th e European Mentality"
was the subject of the Institute
of International Relations' sec
ond lecture in its "Travel Tips for
1955" series, presented at Bow
man Alumni House yesterday.
Henry Blauth, associate professor
of German, spoke on the contrast
between the European and Ameri
can social and political attitudes.
Tracing the differences between
the class consciousness of the Euro
pean mind and the unity of Ameri
can attitudes, Blauth commented
that the Europeans were very care
ful to preserve their beliefs in the
historic and aesthetic values of their
institutions.
The aristocrat in Europe, Blauth
informed his listeners, preserves his
dignity and the emblem of his sta
tion by a series of formalized ac
tions that would make clear to all
his exalted position.
The traveler in Europe would be
likely to recognize him by his dark
suit and tie in the summer heat on
the boulevards of Rome, or by his
proficiency in pouring tea.
These marks of the upper class
man, seeming incomprehensible to
members of an American society
that is practically classless, are the
results of a political system dis
turbed since the Enlightenment by
disillusionment and upheaval, he
commented.
Because the American is able to
boast of a political history that has
evolved toward unity, the average
American may be regarded as pri
marily an economic being, to be fed,
clothed, and furnished along basic
patterns with much less regard to
social status and personal dignity
than his European counterpart,
Blauth said.
