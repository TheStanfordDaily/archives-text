# Council Suspends Woman Student For 3 Quarters
## 
### 
A Stanford woman was found
guilty of a Fundamental Standard
violation and suspended for three
quarters in a recent Women's Coun
cil action.
The violation was incurred by re
peated and excessive deception in
volving the Administration, the so-
I eial regulations, and academic work.
Since the foundations of living at
Stanford are based on the Funda
mental Standard, the University as
sumes honorable action of each stu
dent and allows him to live with
little or no check, Council said.
By her repeated deceptions, con
cerning a final exam and activities
covering a span of several weeks,
the woman showed that she had no
Conception of the responsibility
placed upon her and that she had
not accepted the trust placed in each
student. Therefore, she was not ca
pable of living in the Stanford com
munity at this time, Council de- {
cided.
The suspension was for spring, !
summer, and autumn quarters.
