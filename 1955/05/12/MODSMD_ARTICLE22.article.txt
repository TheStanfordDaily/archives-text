# Davis: Palm Frond Loss Ruins Trees
## 
### 
Students who have been cutting
palm fronds for woven hats on Palm
Drive are ruining the beauty of the
trees for years to come, Gordon
Davis, Stanford police chief, an
nounced.
Many of the younger trees already
appear unbalanced due to the loss
of fronds on one side, Davis said.
There are no doubt many frond.;
at the dump below the KOTC build
ings, the chief added. Some tree;
were recently removed in ordc i to
install the new stop lights on Palm
Drive.
The loss of just one or two front's
from a tree changes its shape, and
the new foliage takes three or four
years to grow out.
