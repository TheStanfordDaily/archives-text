## value of ‘toe-sticking’ 
### 
To tho Editor:
The anxiety and frustration expx-esscd by Bob
Barton in his letter is characteristic of a malady com
mon to ail graduating seniors in the field of Liberal
Arts: the fear of KNOW-NOTHINGNESS. After four
years ol "toe-sticking" we suddenly awaken to the
blank realization that we don't know a damn thing!
To adi' lo our frustration all we have to do is cross
the hail and see our friends frantically completing
th.-'ir lab reports and homework assignments, for in
just a few wt ;ks they are to receive their I AM AN
ENGINEER buttons. They know plenty about
Migineivin;*, and what we know about any one thing
couldn't (ill a thimble. In Mr. Barton's terminology
they've- taken a "bath," and all we've gained as a
r. ,ii!t of oui "toe-sticking" is the knowledge that
: 10 :L oi the 1 tufl we've read is a pile of half-truths.
Mr. Barton says this i- not a liberal education. I
maintain that it is.
Toe- ticking" is all that an undergraduate liberal
education is anc! ever wa: meant to be. After fifty
five unit, of economics, I could toll you all I know
;.bout it in less than a minute. I've been exposed,
in a somewhat lesser dagree, to political science,
histo'rv, psychology, sociology, English, law, and
religion.
The liberal arts major is "fed-up" only because
!r can'l re what he has achieved. What tangible
contribution to our future careers has our brief ex
r- ine to so many diversified and broad subjects
provided us? The answer is none.

And yet I feel that we have gained a great deal.
We can recognize a half-truth. We can look at life's !
situation with a critical eye, one capable of weighing I
the facts, and arriving at a self-formulated opinion, j
This is my reward. There is always time for speeiali- ;
zation. This university affords us an opportunity to ;
view life in its countless manifestations.
Granted that it's just a glance, but this exposure
makes possible a broader and *more profound se-I
lection of a specialized field of endeavor. I'll venture
to say that most engineers or doctors, as a result of
their specialized education, will never enjoy the
depth of intellectual interests or the capacity for
value judgements that we have cultivated, and, 1
whether we realize it or not, shall continue to dc- !
velop for the remainder of our lives.
