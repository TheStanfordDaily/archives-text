To the Editor:
I would like to request that in the future your I
correspondents be fully identified.
There have been several statements in the Daily
issued by a Mr. Daniel Cohen (not myself). I doÂ»
not wish to be connected in any way with arty of
Mr. Cohen's statements.
Inasmuch as we have different middle initials, and
I was in the Class of 1952, while Mr. Cohen is in a
different class, it should be relatively easy to prevent j
situations of this nature from occurring in the future. I
I look forward to the future cooperation of both
the Daily and Mr. Cohen in this matter.
DANIEL MORRIS COHEN, "52
