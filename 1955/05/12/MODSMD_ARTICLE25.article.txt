See where jolly old England has come up
with a companion product for "Noggo," the al
coholic milk. This "Noggo" is great. 'Bout
months ago an enterprising British dairyman
decided that the only way to sell milk was to
jazz it up.
He jazzed it up ail right. Added scotch and
whisky flavoring. Now when Londoners go
into a health bar, they go into a health bar.
Those sturdy Englishmen. Ovalline's not
enough. Maybe it isn't.
But that's not all the man did. If spiked milk
will sell then why not spiked ice cream to go
with it? So he spiked the ice cream.
You see, ice cream sales in England were
plain lousy. Too cold. The picture we get of
the average Englishman wi'.h the ever-present
umbrella would look plain silly if he had the
usual ice cream cone in one hand. But not with
thf unusual ice cream cone in one hand, the
spiked kind. Our boy went to work on this
new picture. I suspect he's had considerable
experience with this spiking business, prob
ably at college, or somewhere, with the punch
bowls.
The man asked himself, "Why isn't ice cream

selling in England?" The man answered him
self, "Ice cream is cold, England is cold, and
the two don't go together." To sell ice cream,
then, two paths were open:
1. Warm up England.
2. Warm up ice cream.
Naturally, number two was it. A winner, Mr.
Dairyman, a winner indeed. N
How to warm up ice cream without melting
it? That's right.
Hence, now when one goes to one's corner
grocer in London one has a choice of whisky,
apricot liqueur, brandy, rum, or creme de
menthe flavored ice cream.
The percentage of spirits runs all the way
up to five per cent and a pint goes for about a
buck. Drink your milk the happy way, top off
your meals the happy way — an unbeatable
combination of health and happiness.
And why in the world didn't Mendes-France
think of this? He'd most likely still be premier
and the little French tots would be making their
elders happy and Pierre happy too with wine
spiked milk and ice cream.
Might be better than chocolate, strawberry,
and vanilla at that.

spiked milk and ice cream.
Might be better than chocolate, strawberry,
and vanilla at that.
See where jolly old England has come up
with a companion product for "Noggo," the al
coholic milk. This "Noggo" is great. 'Bout
months ago an enterprising British dairyman
decided that the only way to sell milk was to
jazz it up.
He jazzed it up ail right. Added scotch and
whisky flavoring. Now when Londoners go
into a health bar, they go into a health bar.
Those sturdy Englishmen. Ovalline's not
enough. Maybe it isn't.
But that's not all the man did. If spiked milk
will sell then why not spiked ice cream to go
with it? So he spiked the ice cream.
You see, ice cream sales in England were
plain lousy. Too cold. The picture we get of
the average Englishman wi'.h the ever-present
umbrella would look plain silly if he had the
usual ice cream cone in one hand. But not with
thf unusual ice cream cone in one hand, the
spiked kind. Our boy went to work on this
new picture. I suspect he's had considerable
experience with this spiking business, prob
ably at college, or somewhere, with the punch
bowls.
The man asked himself, "Why isn't ice cream

selling in England?" The man answered him
self, "Ice cream is cold, England is cold, and
the two don't go together." To sell ice cream,
then, two paths were open:
1. Warm up England.
2. Warm up ice cream.
Naturally, number two was it. A winner, Mr.
Dairyman, a winner indeed. N
How to warm up ice cream without melting
it? That's right.
Hence, now when one goes to one's corner
grocer in London one has a choice of whisky,
apricot liqueur, brandy, rum, or creme de
menthe flavored ice cream.
The percentage of spirits runs all the way
up to five per cent and a pint goes for about a
buck. Drink your milk the happy way, top off
your meals the happy way — an unbeatable
combination of health and happiness.
And why in the world didn't Mendes-France
think of this? He'd most likely still be premier
and the little French tots would be making their
elders happy and Pierre happy too with wine
spiked milk and ice cream.
Might be better than chocolate, strawberry,
and vanilla at that.
