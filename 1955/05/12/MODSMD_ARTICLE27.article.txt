(Reporter's note: Lew Terman, one of this campus's leading exponents
of traditional jazz (Dixieland) lias kindly submitted some of today's ina
' terial, on what he feels is an important discovery for Dixie fans in this
area. So for today, Lew hears music.)
Young musicians are the lifeblood of jazz, and the discovery of
a new group of them is always an exciting event for jazz fans. Such
an outstanding group of young traditional jazz musicians is Bob
Meilke's Bearcats, presently playing Thursdays and Saturdays at
the Lark's Club, 340 Sacramento Street in Berkeley.
Bob Meilke, trombonist and leader, first recorded with Bob Wil-

our's Jazz Band after hitch-hiking
across the country in 1947. Since
j then he has recorded with several
Eastern and Midwestern groups be
fore returning to San Francisco to
form his present band.
Besides his fine trombone, Bunky
I Coleman is outstanding on clarinet,
and Pete Stanton plays a soft but
' very driving cornet with fine inven
tiveness. But the piano-less rhythm
: section really marks the band. The
! combination of banjo, bass, and
| drums lays down a rock-solid base
upon which the horns drive along
beautifully.
For variety, three of the musicians
take vocals, and the repertoire of
j the group is highly diversified, in
cluding pops like "September in the
Rain" and rare old jazz like Jelly
Roll Morton's "Pontchartrain Blues."
A word about the Lark's Club it
: self: it is a small, pleasant place with
the ideal atmosphere for hearing a
jazz band. There is no door, cover,
or minimum charge. All this com
bined with the finest traditional jazz
in the Bay Area makes without a
! doubt one of the best deals around
J for a lover of Dixieland.
Other jazz news is that Jack Tea
garden is at the Hangover, Wally
Rose is at the Tin Angel, and for a
change of pace, Earl Bostic (honk
type sax) is at the Black Hawk.
Jerri Southern and the Hi-Lo's con
tinue at Fdck's
Darius Milhaud's music continues
to earn the spotlight among local
classical events. Primarily, next
Wednesday night at the Merola Me
morial Concert of the San Francisco
Opera Company, two new works of

â™¦
Milhaud's will be given their first
perforinence, "L'Enlevement d'Eu
rope" and "L'Abandon d'Arliane."
Milhaud will direct at the Veterans
Auditorium.
In addition, numerous selections
from his vast output of chamber
music and choral work are being
given at various recitals this week,
i beginning tonight at Mills, where
the Mills Chorus Concert takes place
at 8:15. Milhaud being a teacher at
Mills, where Dave Brubeck, Dave
j von Kriedt, Dick Collins, and other
jazzmen studied with him, it is
be expected that he Ije represented
in every program given there. Next
Wednesday morning at 11, pianist
James Grove will play a program
there including Milhaud's works.
And at the Century Club Monday
night, pianist Charles Somers will
| do likewise in an all-contemporary
program.
Other news of particular interest
to followers of contemporary music
I is the presentation of Aaron Cop
land's opera "The Second Hurri
cane" by the San Fuancisco Con
servatory, at Roosevelt Junior High
auditorium, next Monday night.
Also, a Berkeley recital by or
ganist John Forshaw will include
music by the French composer Jean
Langlais, with whom Forshaw has
studied. Langlais is presently or
ganist in the church where Camille
Saint-Saens played for many years,
and his organ music is some of the
most provocative in the contempo
rary repertoire. The recital will be
at St. Mark's Episcopal Church at
7:30 Sunday night.
Sunday evening, a clarinet, 'cello,
and piano trio will perform Brahms
j at Opus One. And Tuesday evening,
