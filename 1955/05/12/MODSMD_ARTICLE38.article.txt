SCIENCE MADE SIMPLE: NO. 3
Once again the makers of Philip Morris, men who are dedicated
to the betterment of American youth, have consented to let me
use this space, normally intended for levity, to bring you a brief
lesson in science.
It is no new thing, this concern that the makers of Philip
Morris feel for American youth. Youth was foremost in their
minds when they fashioned their cigarette. They were aware
that the palate of youth is keen and eager, awake to the subtlest
nuances of flavor. And so they made a gentle and clement smoke,
a suave blending of temperate vintage tobaccos, a summery
amalgam of the most tranquil and emollient leaf that their
buyers could find in all the world. And then they designed their
cigarette in two sizes, king-size and regular, and wrapped them
in the convenient Snap-Open pack, and priced them at a figure
that youth could afford, and made them available at every
tobacco counter in the land.
That's what they did, the makers of Philip Morris, and I for
one am glad.
The science that we take up today is called astronomy, from the
Greek words astro meaning "sore" and nomy meaning "back."
Sore backs were the occupational disease of the early Greek
astronomers, and no wonder! They used to spend every blessed
night lying on the damp ground and looking up at the sky, and
if there's a better way to get a sore back, I'd like to hear about it.
Especially in the moist Mediterranean area, where Greece is
generally considered to tie.
Lumbago and related disorders kept astronomy from becom
ing very popular until Galileo, a disbarred flense!' of Perth,
fashioned a home made telescope in 1921 out of three Social
Security cards and an ordinary ice cube. What schoolboy does
not know that stirring story — how Galileo stepped up to his
telescope, how he looked heavenward, how his face filled with
wonder, how he stepped back and whispered the words heard
round the world: "L'etat, e'est moi!"
Well sir, you can imagine what happened then! William
Jennings Bryan snatched Nell Gwynne from the shadow of the
guillotine at Oslo; Chancellor Bismarck brought in four gushers
in a single afternoon; Hal Newhouser was signed by the
IJanseatic League; Crete was declared off limits to Wellington's
entire army; and William Faulkner won the Davis Cup for his
immortal Penrod and Sam.

Hut after a while things calmed down, and astronomers began
the (daggering task of naming all the heavenly bodies. First
man to name a star was Sigafoos of Mt. Wilson, and the name
lie chose was Betelgeuse, after his wife Betclgeuse Sigafoos,
prom queen at Michigan State College from 1919 to 1931.
Not to be outdone, Formfig of Yerkes Observatory named a
whole constellation after his wife, Big Dipper Formfig, the
famed dirt track racer. This started the custom of astronomers
naming constellations after their wives — Capricorn, Cygni,
Orion, Ursa Major, Canis Major, and so forth. (The Major girls,
Ursa and Canis, both married astronomers, though Canis subse
quently ran off with a drydock broker named Thwaite Daphnis.)
After naming all the heavenly bodies, the astronomers had a
good long rest. Then, refreshed and brown as berries, they
undertook the gigantic project of charting the heavens. Space is
so vast that it is measured in units called "light-years." These
are different from ordinary years in that they weigh a good
deal less. This, of course, is only relative, since space is curved.

Once again the makers of Philip Morris, men who are dedicated
to the betterment of American youth, have consented to let me
use this space, normally intended for levity, to bring you a brief
lesson in science.
It is no new thing, this concern that the makers of Philip
Morris feel for American youth. Youth was foremost in their
minds when they fashioned their cigarette. They were aware
that the palate of youth is keen and eager, awake to the subtlest
nuances of flavor. And so they made a gentle and clement smoke,
a suave blending of temperate vintage tobaccos, a summery
amalgam of the most tranquil and emollient leaf that their
buyers could find in all the world. And then they designed their
cigarette in two sizes, king-size and regular, and wrapped them
in the convenient Snap-Open pack, and priced them at a figure
that youth could afford, and made them available at every
tobacco counter in the land.
That's what they did, the makers of Philip Morris, and I for
one am glad.
The science that we take up today is called astronomy, from the
Greek words astro meaning "sore" and nomy meaning "back."
Sore backs were the occupational disease of the early Greek
astronomers, and no wonder! They used to spend every blessed
night lying on the damp ground and looking up at the sky, and
if there's a better way to get a sore back, I'd like to hear about it.
Especially in the moist Mediterranean area, where Greece is
generally considered to tie.
Lumbago and related disorders kept astronomy from becom

fashioned a home made telescope in 1921 out of three Social
Security cards and an ordinary ice cube. What schoolboy does
not know that stirring story — how Galileo stepped up to his
telescope, how he looked heavenward, how his face filled with
wonder, how he stepped back and whispered the words heard
