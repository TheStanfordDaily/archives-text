(Editor's note: The historical information in the following story was made available through the courtesy
of Elwyn Bugge, Director of Tennis from 1930 to 1950 and present Director of Intramurals at Stanford.)

In 1920 through a special action the student body voted by a 4-1 margin to make tennis a major
sport at Stanford. Since that time tennis has almost always played a major role in the athletic pic
ture on the Farm.
Two factors were instrumental in bringing the issue of tennis's importance to a vote. Stanford
first really became tennis conscious in 1917 when grad student R. Lindley Murray amazed the

tennis world by copping the U.S.
singles title. He did it again in 1918
with a hard-fought four-set victory
over Bill Tilden at Forest Hills.
Three years later two sophomores,
Phil Neer and Jimmy Davis, aroused
enough interest in the sport locally
to popularize it and bring about the
change in status. Neer and Davies
did not let the student body down.
The following year, in 1921, Neer
captured the National Intercolle
giate singles title, and in 1922 Davies

♦
and Neer* combined to bring home
to the Farm the National Intercolle
giate Doubles crown.
AUSTRALIA TOUR
Stanford gained international ten
nis prestige and a reputation for fine
sportsmanship when a four - man
Stanford team was chosen to make
a good-will tour qf Australia in the
summer of 1924. The team, composed
of Richard Hinkley, Ted Mertz, Nor
man de Back, and Hal Overfelt, won
j 12 of their 17 matches down under.
The Indian racketmen began to
take hold as a power in the Pacific
Coast Conference the next year,
when they scored the first varsity
win over California in 14 years. In
1927 the Cards swept to their first
PCC title, and repeated the per
formance the following season.
They were edged out of the PCC
crown in 1928, but Stanford came
in for its share of honors as A 1 Har
rington and Ralph McElvenny
brought home the National Inter
collegiate Doubles title. Bouncing
right back the next season, Stanford
regained top place in the PCC, and
on the national scene Card John
Doeg teamed up with George Lott to
capture the U.S. Doubles title.
BUGGE DEBUT
Elwyn Bugge served his first year
as Director of Tennis at Stanford in
1930 as the rampaging Indian net
men grabbed another PCC crown.
In 1931 the Pacific Coast Confer
! ence assumed its present form as it
was divided up into Northern and
Southern Divisions for the first time.
The Southern Division was com
posed of Stanford, Cal, UCLA, and
USC. Apparently the change didn't
upset the Stanford players any as
they won handily in all six of their
J conference matches. In the play
offs Stanford's Keith Gledhill and
Ted Easton defeated the University
of Washington team, 3-0.
DOUBLES CROWN
The next year Gledhill and Jo
Coughlin combined to win the Na
tional Intercollegiate Doubles cham
pionship for Standford. Later in the
year Gledhill and Ellsworth Vines
| teamed up to ensnare the U.S.
I Doubles title.
Jo Coughlin, playing this time
j with Sam Lee, was a repeat winner
in the National Intercollegiate doub
les in the 1933 season. On the local
scene Stanford lost only one PCC
match, that one to USC.
The next PCC title came in 1935
as the Cards were unbeatable, in
conference play. Many players grad
uated, however, and the next few
years marked an era of a few out
standing individuals and below-par
team play. Ben Dey and Bill Sew
ard grabbed the collegiate doubles

j championship in 1936, and in 1940
| Larry Dee and Jimmy Wade won
j the National Intercollegiate Doubles
title once more for Stanford. This
time was enough to permanently
retire the trophy to the Farm.
BACK ON TOP
After half a dozen lean years in
the PCC, Stanford shot to the top
again in 1942 with an all-time great
team. The squad, composed of Dee,
| Wade, Ted Schroeder, Emery Neale,
j Ben Olsen, Andy Roberts, and Tom
Kruger and Paul Wilson in doubles,
rolled up a 6-0 record in PCC play.
The NCAA tennis finals were an all-
Stanford show. Schroeder defeated
Dee for the singles championship,
then the two teamed up to trounce
Wade and Neale in the doubles
finals. •
No tennis was played, of course, at
Stanford during the war years, and
when intercollegiate play resumed
Stanford found itself somewhat left
behind in the PCC tennis race.
NEW MAN
In 1950, after 20 years as tennis
director at Stanford, Elwyn Biigge
| decided he needed a change and
| stepped down from the helm. Tak
ing over in a dual capacity as tennis
director and coach was bronzed,
young Bob Renker, who immedi
ately began where Bugge left off the
task of building up the Card squad.
Renker is still building, but he
thinks the goal he seeks is in sight.
His job has been complicated by the
fact that the red-hot tennis play of
the Southern Division PCC has
turned it into probably the tough
est collegiate circuit in the nation.
STRONG CONTENDER
However, he has a young team.
! From this year's .squad only one
man, Mackey Wirth, currently num
ber seven singles, will be graduat
ing. He has Jack Frost, 12th ranked
nationally and one of the best young
players in the nation, coming back
next year. He will have Ernie Du-
Bray, Dave Duff, Bob Prince, Roger
Keesing, and Bob Norton—all reg
ulars this season—back again. Jack
ie Douglas, 30th ranked nationally,
Bob Bowden, and Gill White will be
j up from the frosh.


Jay Becker
LOOKING AHEAD- Thinking about next year are (left to right) Coach Bob Renker, Ernie Dußray,
Mackey Wirth, Roger Keesing, Bobby Prince, Captain Jack Frost, Bob Norton, and Dave Duff.
Wirth is the only senior on the squad. Prince is a sophomore and the rest are juniors. Frost is
a former junior's champion and is currently the 12th ranked singles player in the nation.

(Editor's note: The historical information in the following story was made available through the courtesy
of Elwyn Bugge, Director of Tennis from 1930 to 1950 and present Director of Intramurals at Stanford.)

In 1920 through a special action the student body voted by a 4-1 margin to make tennis a major
sport at Stanford. Since that time tennis has almost always played a major role in the athletic pic
ture on the Farm.
Two factors were instrumental in bringing the issue of tennis's importance to a vote. Stanford
first really became tennis conscious in 1917 when grad student R. Lindley Murray amazed the

tennis world by copping the U.S.
singles title. He did it again in 1918
with a hard-fought four-set victory
over Bill Tilden at Forest Hills.
Three years later two sophomores,
Phil Neer and Jimmy Davis, aroused
enough interest in the sport locally
to popularize it and bring about the
change in status. Neer and Davies
did not let the student body down.
The following year, in 1921, Neer
captured the National Intercolle
giate singles title, and in 1922 Davies

♦
and Neer* combined to bring home
to the Farm the National Intercolle
giate Doubles crown.
AUSTRALIA TOUR
Stanford gained international ten
nis prestige and a reputation for fine
sportsmanship when a four - man
Stanford team was chosen to make
a good-will tour qf Australia in the
summer of 1924. The team, composed
of Richard Hinkley, Ted Mertz, Nor
man de Back, and Hal Overfelt, won
j 12 of their 17 matches down under.
The Indian racketmen began to
take hold as a power in the Pacific
Coast Conference the next year,
when they scored the first varsity
win over California in 14 years. In
1927 the Cards swept to their first
PCC title, and repeated the per
formance the following season.
They were edged out of the PCC
crown in 1928, but Stanford came
in for its share of honors as A 1 Har
rington and Ralph McElvenny
brought home the National Inter
collegiate Doubles title. Bouncing
right back the next season, Stanford
regained top place in the PCC, and
on the national scene Card John
Doeg teamed up with George Lott to
capture the U.S. Doubles title.
BUGGE DEBUT
Elwyn Bugge served his first year
as Director of Tennis at Stanford in
1930 as the rampaging Indian net
men grabbed another PCC crown.
In 1931 the Pacific Coast Confer
! ence assumed its present form as it
was divided up into Northern and
Southern Divisions for the first time.
The Southern Division was com
posed of Stanford, Cal, UCLA, and
USC. Apparently the change didn't
upset the Stanford players any as
they won handily in all six of their
J conference matches. In the play
offs Stanford's Keith Gledhill and
Ted Easton defeated the University
of Washington team, 3-0.
DOUBLES CROWN
The next year Gledhill and Jo
Coughlin combined to win the Na
tional Intercollegiate Doubles cham
pionship for Standford. Later in the
year Gledhill and Ellsworth Vines
| teamed up to ensnare the U.S.
I Doubles title.
Jo Coughlin, playing this time
j with Sam Lee, was a repeat winner
in the National Intercollegiate doub
les in the 1933 season. On the local
scene Stanford lost only one PCC
match, that one to USC.
The next PCC title came in 1935
as the Cards were unbeatable, in
conference play. Many players grad
uated, however, and the next few
years marked an era of a few out
standing individuals and below-par
team play. Ben Dey and Bill Sew
ard grabbed the collegiate doubles

j championship in 1936, and in 1940
| Larry Dee and Jimmy Wade won
j the National Intercollegiate Doubles
title once more for Stanford. This
time was enough to permanently
retire the trophy to the Farm.
BACK ON TOP
After half a dozen lean years in
the PCC, Stanford shot to the top
again in 1942 with an all-time great
team. The squad, composed of Dee,
| Wade, Ted Schroeder, Emery Neale,
j Ben Olsen, Andy Roberts, and Tom
Kruger and Paul Wilson in doubles,
rolled up a 6-0 record in PCC play.
The NCAA tennis finals were an all-
Stanford show. Schroeder defeated
Dee for the singles championship,
then the two teamed up to trounce
Wade and Neale in the doubles
finals. •
No tennis was played, of course, at
Stanford during the war years, and
when intercollegiate play resumed
Stanford found itself somewhat left
behind in the PCC tennis race.
NEW MAN
In 1950, after 20 years as tennis
director at Stanford, Elwyn Biigge
| decided he needed a change and
| stepped down from the helm. Tak
ing over in a dual capacity as tennis
director and coach was bronzed,
young Bob Renker, who immedi
ately began where Bugge left off the
task of building up the Card squad.
Renker is still building, but he
thinks the goal he seeks is in sight.
His job has been complicated by the
fact that the red-hot tennis play of
the Southern Division PCC has
turned it into probably the tough
est collegiate circuit in the nation.
STRONG CONTENDER
However, he has a young team.
! From this year's .squad only one
man, Mackey Wirth, currently num
ber seven singles, will be graduat
ing. He has Jack Frost, 12th ranked
nationally and one of the best young
players in the nation, coming back
next year. He will have Ernie Du-
Bray, Dave Duff, Bob Prince, Roger
Keesing, and Bob Norton—all reg
ulars this season—back again. Jack
ie Douglas, 30th ranked nationally,
Bob Bowden, and Gill White will be
j up from the frosh.

LOOKING AHEAD- Thinking about next year are (left to right) Coach Bob Renker, Ernie Dußray,
Mackey Wirth, Roger Keesing, Bobby Prince, Captain Jack Frost, Bob Norton, and Dave Duff.
Wirth is the only senior on the squad. Prince is a sophomore and the rest are juniors. Frost is

(Editor's note: The historical information in the following story was made available through the courtesy
of Elwyn Bugge, Director of Tennis from 1930 to 1950 and present Director of Intramurals at Stanford.)

In 1920 through a special action the student body voted by a 4-1 margin to make tennis a major
sport at Stanford. Since that time tennis has almost always played a major role in the athletic pic
ture on the Farm.
Two factors were instrumental in bringing the issue of tennis's importance to a vote. Stanford
first really became tennis conscious in 1917 when grad student R. Lindley Murray amazed the

tennis world by copping the U.S.
singles title. He did it again in 1918
with a hard-fought four-set victory
over Bill Tilden at Forest Hills.
Three years later two sophomores,
Phil Neer and Jimmy Davis, aroused
enough interest in the sport locally
to popularize it and bring about the
change in status. Neer and Davies
did not let the student body down.
The following year, in 1921, Neer
captured the National Intercolle
giate singles title, and in 1922 Davies

♦
and Neer* combined to bring home
to the Farm the National Intercolle
giate Doubles crown.
AUSTRALIA TOUR
Stanford gained international ten
nis prestige and a reputation for fine
sportsmanship when a four - man
Stanford team was chosen to make
a good-will tour qf Australia in the
summer of 1924. The team, composed
of Richard Hinkley, Ted Mertz, Nor
man de Back, and Hal Overfelt, won
j 12 of their 17 matches down under.
The Indian racketmen began to
take hold as a power in the Pacific
Coast Conference the next year,
when they scored the first varsity
win over California in 14 years. In
1927 the Cards swept to their first
PCC title, and repeated the per
formance the following season.
They were edged out of the PCC
crown in 1928, but Stanford came
in for its share of honors as A 1 Har
rington and Ralph McElvenny
brought home the National Inter
collegiate Doubles title. Bouncing
right back the next season, Stanford
regained top place in the PCC, and
on the national scene Card John
Doeg teamed up with George Lott to
capture the U.S. Doubles title.
BUGGE DEBUT
Elwyn Bugge served his first year
as Director of Tennis at Stanford in
1930 as the rampaging Indian net
men grabbed another PCC crown.
In 1931 the Pacific Coast Confer
! ence assumed its present form as it
was divided up into Northern and
Southern Divisions for the first time.
The Southern Division was com
posed of Stanford, Cal, UCLA, and
USC. Apparently the change didn't
upset the Stanford players any as
they won handily in all six of their
J conference matches. In the play
offs Stanford's Keith Gledhill and
Ted Easton defeated the University
of Washington team, 3-0.
DOUBLES CROWN
The next year Gledhill and Jo
Coughlin combined to win the Na
tional Intercollegiate Doubles cham
pionship for Standford. Later in the
year Gledhill and Ellsworth Vines
| teamed up to ensnare the U.S.
I Doubles title.
Jo Coughlin, playing this time
j with Sam Lee, was a repeat winner
in the National Intercollegiate doub
les in the 1933 season. On the local
scene Stanford lost only one PCC
match, that one to USC.
The next PCC title came in 1935
as the Cards were unbeatable, in
conference play. Many players grad
uated, however, and the next few
years marked an era of a few out
standing individuals and below-par
team play. Ben Dey and Bill Sew
ard grabbed the collegiate doubles

j championship in 1936, and in 1940
| Larry Dee and Jimmy Wade won
j the National Intercollegiate Doubles
title once more for Stanford. This
time was enough to permanently
retire the trophy to the Farm.
BACK ON TOP
After half a dozen lean years in
the PCC, Stanford shot to the top
again in 1942 with an all-time great
team. The squad, composed of Dee,
| Wade, Ted Schroeder, Emery Neale,
j Ben Olsen, Andy Roberts, and Tom
Kruger and Paul Wilson in doubles,
rolled up a 6-0 record in PCC play.
The NCAA tennis finals were an all-
Stanford show. Schroeder defeated
Dee for the singles championship,
then the two teamed up to trounce
Wade and Neale in the doubles
finals. •
No tennis was played, of course, at
Stanford during the war years, and
when intercollegiate play resumed
Stanford found itself somewhat left
behind in the PCC tennis race.
NEW MAN
In 1950, after 20 years as tennis
director at Stanford, Elwyn Biigge
| decided he needed a change and
| stepped down from the helm. Tak
ing over in a dual capacity as tennis
director and coach was bronzed,
young Bob Renker, who immedi
ately began where Bugge left off the
task of building up the Card squad.
Renker is still building, but he
thinks the goal he seeks is in sight.
His job has been complicated by the
fact that the red-hot tennis play of
the Southern Division PCC has
turned it into probably the tough
est collegiate circuit in the nation.
STRONG CONTENDER
However, he has a young team.
! From this year's .squad only one
man, Mackey Wirth, currently num
ber seven singles, will be graduat
ing. He has Jack Frost, 12th ranked
nationally and one of the best young
players in the nation, coming back
next year. He will have Ernie Du-
Bray, Dave Duff, Bob Prince, Roger
Keesing, and Bob Norton—all reg
