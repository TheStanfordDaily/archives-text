### 
1/ON"DON â€” The UViited States,
Britain, and France welcomed the
new Soviet disarmament plan today,
agreeing that it brings Russia much
more nearly in lino with the West
than any previous Soviet proposal.
Western delegates to the disarma
ment conference here carefully
checked the official Soviet an
nouncement for possible "hidden
gimmicks," but there was general
feeling that the plan was a signifi
cant contribution toward ending
cold war tensions.
