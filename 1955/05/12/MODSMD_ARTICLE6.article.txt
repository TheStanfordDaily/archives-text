Council dance tomorrow night.
Open to fraternity actives only,
the dance will be given from 9

CHARLESTON CONTEST
A special event of the evening will
be a Charleston contest among the
24 fraternities with Otis Winters as
master of ceremonies. Each house
will enter one couple and the win
ning couple will receive a prize.
The band which will play tomor
row night is one that Kenton has
formed recently after dissolving his
old one following an extensive Eu
ropean tour in 1953. Having had his
own band fer around 14 years, Ken
ton got his start in the Los Angeles
area.
STRESS ON BRASS
Kenton's musical style stresses
brass section, rendering it as loud
and blaring as brass can be. Trum
pets appear high and. loud while
deep, guttural trombones provide
rhythmic background. His bands
perform modern jazz, ordinary
dance music, and experimental mu
sic like Bob Graettinger's arrange
ment of "City of Glass." He has
also recorded for Capitol several
long-playing records tracing the en
tire development of his music called
"The Kenton Era."
Patrons for the dance will include
Mr. and Mrs. Richard L. Balch, Mr.
and Mrs. Robert Huff, Mrs. Ellene
Sumner, and Bill Altieri.
