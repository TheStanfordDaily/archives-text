# Dean Will Be Honored; Tribe Nine Plays 3
## 
### BILL NICHOLS Sports Editor, The Daily 
Everett Dean leads his horseniders into the final weekend of
the 1955 season against UCLA and USC today and tomorrow. It
will also mark the end of one of the longest and most rewarding
coaching careers in the country.
Dean will retire at the end of the season, which closes on Thurs-

day, but the veteran mentor, who'*
has been coaching for 35 years, will
be honored in a ceremony during
the intermission between the games
of the USC doubleheader, which
starts at 1:30 p.m.
Today is Coed Day; all girls with
student body cards will be admitted
free. The Cards will send Ray
Young against the Bruins, while

trying to outfungo their UCLA ri
vals. The game will start at 3:15.
Tomorrow the Trojans, who have
won 10 straight league games aftei
an initial loss to UCLA, will make
their lone Sunken Diamond appear
ance of the year. Stanford has lost
five in a row to the Bovard Fielders,
and the players are not out to add
to this record.
USC plays Santa Clara on Friday,
so will probably save its two top
hurlers, Vic Lapiner and Ralph
Pausig, both right - handers, for
Stanford.
SOPH DUO
Dean is countering with two soph
omores. Payne is a known quan
tity, who is tough for seven innings,
but has shown trouble in going all
the way against first - rate teams.
Verdurmen, brilliant in a 1-0 win
over Santa Clara, has had trouble
of late.
USC presents a tough lineup with
many hard hitters. Tony Santino,
Doc Mason, Kent Hadley, and John
Garten all hit the long ball, and the
other swatters aren't weaklings ei
ther.
Today's opponents, the Bruins,
aren't the supermen that the Figue
roa Street window breakers are.
UCLA has lost its last three confer
! enee games, and Stanford had an
easy time of it with the Bruins up
here several weeks ago, although
two losses were the result in Los
Angeles when the two met.
The Stanford lineup will be the
j same that has been starting recenl
games. Right field is still a tossup
between Tom Dandurand and Dixi<
Workman, but the former seems the
likely choice.
Dandurand's hitting did much to
bring victory over Cal last Tuesday,
and the Cards need those base hits.
Bob Evans, Len Swartz, and Rudy
Figueroa will also be counted upon
for stickwork, as will Mickey Holz
man, who has been banging the ball
i at a fast clip in recent contests.
Both today's game with the Bru
ins and tomorrow's doubleheadei
j will be broadcast by radio station
KZSU.

Walt Payne and Ed Verdurmen, both
sophs, will pitch the Trojan double
header.
Stanford can tie USC for the
CIBA lead, but the Trojans have al
ready won the "league within the
league" PCC championship, and
with it, the right to play off with
the Northern Division winners.
FUNGOS ANI) RUNNERS
Today's festivities will start at 3:05
with Sid Hall and Ron Marciel rac
ing 60 yards against two Bruins, and
Tom Dandurand and Ken Brown
