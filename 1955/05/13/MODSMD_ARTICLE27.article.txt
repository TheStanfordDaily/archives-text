The University has been considering the
building of a new basketball pavilion, some
thing which many fans think is a virtual neces
sity if Stanford is to continue its prominence in
the athletic world.
Such a building would naturally be quite
costly to consiruct and the project would only
bo undertaken if University officials were as
sured that the student body and the fans in
general wanted a new building and would
support games which would be held in the
structure.
The overflow crowds and the many fans
turned away during games held at ihe present
pavilion in the past show some need for a new
court. And it's been reported that the floor in
the pavilion, in need of sanding to keep its
surface smooth, can't be sanded much more
because of the thinness of the court boards.
Added to this is the fact that some officials say
that putting in a new floor in the present "in
adequate" pavilion would be useless. These
men favoi a new pavilion providing that in
terest and attendance is high enough to support
the cost of its construction.
The present pavilion was built in 1921 and
has its original court floor, which has been
sanded almost to the ground.
A random sampling of student opinion on
how many more games a year they'd attend if

a new pavilion were built and if they thought
a new court would be athletic overemphasis
provided the following comments, which show
the great student interest in the need for a new
pavilion:
Carclyn Davis, '57: ". . . would attend about
two more games a year. It certainly would not
be too much emphasis on athletics. We need
a new pavilion badly."
Kay Vinson, '57: ". . . would attend no more
games than I do now, but we do need a new
pavilion badly."
Marcia Moyer, '56: "I certainly would attend
more games. Then I wouldn't have to go four
hours early [to get a seat in the overcrowded
standsl . . . not too much emphasis on ath
letics."
Dick Oxandale, '58: "This is a top University
and it should have at least adequate basketball
facilities. There have been games when peo
ple couldn't get in because of the size of the
crowd."
George Avery, '58: "The present pavilion is
too small. A larger one Would allow more
people to come and would evoke more inter
est and spirit in our basketball team."
Craig Rushforth, '58: "If a small school like
Utah can consistently fill a 12,000-seat pavilion,
Stanford should be able to do at least as well."

pavilion in the past show some need for a new
court. And it's been reported that the floor in
the pavilion, in need of sanding to keep its
surface smooth, can't be sanded much more
because of the thinness of the court boards.
Added to this is the fact that some officials say
that putting in a new floor in the present "in
adequate" pavilion would be useless. These
men favoi a new pavilion providing that in

the cost of its construction.
The present pavilion was built in 1921 and
has its original court floor, which has been
sanded almost to the ground.
A random sampling of student opinion on
how many more games a year they'd attend if

a new pavilion were built and if they thought
a new court would be athletic overemphasis
provided the following comments, which show
the great student interest in the need for a new
pavilion:
Carclyn Davis, '57: ". . . would attend about
two more games a year. It certainly would not
be too much emphasis on athletics. We need
a new pavilion badly."
Kay Vinson, '57: ". . . would attend no more
games than I do now, but we do need a new
pavilion badly."
Marcia Moyer, '56: "I certainly would attend
more games. Then I wouldn't have to go four
hours early [to get a seat in the overcrowded
standsl . . . not too much emphasis on ath
letics."
Dick Oxandale, '58: "This is a top University
and it should have at least adequate basketball
facilities. There have been games when peo
ple couldn't get in because of the size of the
crowd."
George Avery, '58: "The present pavilion is
too small. A larger one Would allow more
people to come and would evoke more inter
est and spirit in our basketball team."
Craig Rushforth, '58: "If a small school like
Utah can consistently fill a 12,000-seat pavilion,
Stanford should be able to do at least as well."

THE PAVILION: STUDENTS WANT A NEW ONE (See below)
The University has been considering the
building of a new basketball pavilion, some
thing which many fans think is a virtual neces
sity if Stanford is to continue its prominence in
the athletic world.
Such a building would naturally be quite
costly to consiruct and the project would only
bo undertaken if University officials were as
sured that the student body and the fans in
general wanted a new building and would
support games which would be held in the
structure.
The overflow crowds and the many fans
turned away during games held at ihe present
pavilion in the past show some need for a new
court. And it's been reported that the floor in
the pavilion, in need of sanding to keep its
surface smooth, can't be sanded much more
