high school education
To the Editor:
The controversy that is going on at the present time
about whether a college education should be technical
or liberal is a problem which has its origin in high
school education, and it is there where the remedy
lies.
Most people who attend college nowadays do so be
cause they want to acquire a profession or at least
enough knowledge to get a specific type of job. Very
few people can afford to go to college just for the
.sake of barning since almost everyone has to earn a
living sooner or later. The training for a job can
not be achieved through a liberal education, but
only by specialized courses in each field. As pointed
out in one of the letters to the editor on Monday,
an engineering student, when he gets his first job,
will have to learn in the field 75 per cent of the
information he needs for this job. This is a hard way
of learning, and it would save time and disappoint
ment to this person if he would have gotten more
technical training during his years of college.
On the orher hand. I am convinced that no man can
go far in any profession if he does not have a good
general background of what is called a liberal edu
cation. This can easily be obtained in high school if
the whole high school program is radically changed.

From the ago of 12 to 18 the average student can
grasp more knowledge much more easily than at any
later period. It seems a terrible waste of time that
high school students should have two or three basic
courses every year and spend the rest of that year in
sports and subjects like 'life in the community' and
social science topics of this kind. It also seems un
reasonable that a person of the age of 13 or 14 should
choose the subjects he wants to study. Naturally, he
will take the easier and more appealing ones ac
cording to his particular taste. How can he know
that he will not need other more important subjects
later in his life?
High school education should have certain basic
courses required for everyone; these should he:
mathematics, chemistry, physics, world and art his
tory (similar to Western Civ), biology, and of course
English and literature, in addition to some secondary
courses like a foreign language and social sciences.
This would still allow the average student enough
time for sports and amusement but would save him
from many courses now required in college.
With a program of this sort, the student would
already have a BROAD LIBERAL EDUCATION .at
the time he starts college, and more time of the four
short years in college could be put, to use in a better
preparation of the student for his profession.

high school students should have two or three basic
courses every year and spend the rest of that year in
sports and subjects like 'life in the community' and
social science topics of this kind. It also seems un
reasonable that a person of the age of 13 or 14 should
choose the subjects he wants to study. Naturally, he
will take the easier and more appealing ones ac
cording to his particular taste. How can he know
that he will not need other more important subjects
later in his life?
High school education should have certain basic
courses required for everyone; these should he:
mathematics, chemistry, physics, world and art his
tory (similar to Western Civ), biology, and of course
English and literature, in addition to some secondary
courses like a foreign language and social sciences.
This would still allow the average student enough
time for sports and amusement but would save him
from many courses now required in college.
With a program of this sort, the student would
already have a BROAD LIBERAL EDUCATION .at
the time he starts college, and more time of the four
short years in college could be put, to use in a better
preparation of the student for his profession.

To the Editor:
The controversy that is going on at the present time
about whether a college education should be technical
or liberal is a problem which has its origin in high
school education, and it is there where the remedy
lies.
Most people who attend college nowadays do so be
cause they want to acquire a profession or at least
enough knowledge to get a specific type of job. Very
few people can afford to go to college just for the
.sake of barning since almost everyone has to earn a
living sooner or later. The training for a job can
not be achieved through a liberal education, but
only by specialized courses in each field. As pointed
out in one of the letters to the editor on Monday,
an engineering student, when he gets his first job,
will have to learn in the field 75 per cent of the
information he needs for this job. This is a hard way
of learning, and it would save time and disappoint
ment to this person if he would have gotten more
technical training during his years of college.
On the orher hand. I am convinced that no man can
go far in any profession if he does not have a good
general background of what is called a liberal edu
cation. This can easily be obtained in high school if
the whole high school program is radically changed.

From the ago of 12 to 18 the average student can
grasp more knowledge much more easily than at any
later period. It seems a terrible waste of time that
high school students should have two or three basic
courses every year and spend the rest of that year in
sports and subjects like 'life in the community' and
social science topics of this kind. It also seems un
reasonable that a person of the age of 13 or 14 should
