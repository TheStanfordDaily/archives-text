# Snarf Snarls In 150 Papers
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
The drooling, luckless "Little Man on Campus" . . . the snarling,
vindictive Prolessor Snarf . . . these Iwo creations of Dick Bibler
battle it out on the pages of over 150 college newspapers in the
country.
Bibler, the mastermind of the sniveling Worthal who is familiar

to ul! Stanford students, took up
Worthal's role at Stanford in .1952
and received the MA degree in draw
ing and painting a year later.
The young cartoonist then
promptly stepped out of Worthal's
shoes and into Professor Snarl's and
has been playing that role ever since.
Having taught for two years at Colo
rado State College of Education, Bib
ler is planning to return to Cali
foi'nia next year to teach at Hum
boldt State College.
Reaction to the aniics of Bibler's
little characters is not confined only
to this country. For instance. Bibler
just recently heard that at the Uni
versity of Mexico students are con
structing a Professor Snarl' 40 feet
high—with a head over eight feet in
height.
The University, it seems, has a
yearly Snarf-burning celebration.
And from American universities,
he gets a wide range of remarks.
Housemothers say he makes them
look too old, and college professors
complain that he hits too close to
home.
And to the fiendish old Snarf who
lives only to frustrate the already
confused Worthals, Bibler said that
his character is "patterned after all
the little Snarfisms that lie latent in
tyrannical old professors, especially
myself."
The 32-year-old artist published
his first cartoons at 14, and his first
collegiate cartoons appeared in the
University Daily Kansan as a result
of a student cartoon drawing contest
sponsored by the paper.
When Bibler came to Stanford, he
brought Worthal and his associates
along with him and at Stanford, his
cartoon series became famous across
the nation. In 1952, the Stanford
University Press published a book of
the cartoons which went through
three printings in the first month of
publication.

The "Little Man on Campus" car
toons are prepared a year in advance
and are planned so that they will
conform to such seasonal happenings
as football, registration, and social
activities.
Bibler prepares his cartoons in
such a way that the text below the
cartoon can be changed to suit local
names and places.
Worthal's compatriots next year
will include many new names. Bibler
said, such as Louise Lush and an
other girl yet unnamed, Bolivar Q.
Shagnasty 111, Penrod McGifford, and
Dean Bellows.

When Bibler came to Stanford, he
brought Worthal and his associates
along with him and at Stanford, his
cartoon series became famous across
the nation. In 1952, the Stanford
University Press published a book of
the cartoons which went through
three printings in the first month of
publication.

The "Little Man on Campus" car
toons are prepared a year in advance
and are planned so that they will
conform to such seasonal happenings
as football, registration, and social
activities.
Bibler prepares his cartoons in
such a way that the text below the
cartoon can be changed to suit local
names and places.
Worthal's compatriots next year
will include many new names. Bibler
said, such as Louise Lush and an
other girl yet unnamed, Bolivar Q.
Shagnasty 111, Penrod McGifford, and
Dean Bellows.


DICK BIBLER
The drooling, luckless "Little Man on Campus" . . . the snarling,
vindictive Prolessor Snarf . . . these Iwo creations of Dick Bibler
battle it out on the pages of over 150 college newspapers in the
country.
Bibler, the mastermind of the sniveling Worthal who is familiar

to ul! Stanford students, took up
Worthal's role at Stanford in .1952
and received the MA degree in draw
ing and painting a year later.
The young cartoonist then
promptly stepped out of Worthal's
shoes and into Professor Snarl's and
has been playing that role ever since.
Having taught for two years at Colo
rado State College of Education, Bib
ler is planning to return to Cali
foi'nia next year to teach at Hum
boldt State College.
Reaction to the aniics of Bibler's
little characters is not confined only
to this country. For instance. Bibler
just recently heard that at the Uni
versity of Mexico students are con
structing a Professor Snarl' 40 feet
high—with a head over eight feet in
height.
The University, it seems, has a
yearly Snarf-burning celebration.
And from American universities,
he gets a wide range of remarks.
Housemothers say he makes them
look too old, and college professors
complain that he hits too close to
home.
And to the fiendish old Snarf who
lives only to frustrate the already
confused Worthals, Bibler said that
his character is "patterned after all
the little Snarfisms that lie latent in
tyrannical old professors, especially
myself."
The 32-year-old artist published
his first cartoons at 14, and his first
collegiate cartoons appeared in the
University Daily Kansan as a result
of a student cartoon drawing contest
sponsored by the paper.
