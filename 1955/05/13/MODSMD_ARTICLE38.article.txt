## Indian Mermen Face California 
### JIM BAKER 
Stanford's PCC champion swimmers, undefeated in four years
of collegiate dual meet competition, will be looking for another
victory to add to their string tomorrow when they meet Cal at
10 a.m. in the Berkeley Men's Gym pool.
Leading the Indians will be ace Larry Heim, who has broken

the PCC 150-yard individual med
ley record twice in the last two
weeks. So far Heim has lowered the
record three seconds—from 1:31.2 to
1:28.5.
The Indians, who humbled the
Bears 57-27 the last time the two
teams met, are a heavy favorite to
repeat the drubbing. The Cards
have no injured team members,
while the loss of sprinter Gordon
Mall will hurt the Cal cause. Hall
was a possible point scorer in either
the 50- or 100-yard freestyle.
WILBUR FAVORED
Favored to bounce back this week
is Cole Wilbur, who was edged out
last week by USC's Stan Horsely, in
the 200-yard breaststroke. Wilbur,
former PCC champion in this event,
should win easily.
Cal's only hope for a first place
lies with distance man Dave Rad
cliff, who beat Stanford's Dan Os
borne in the 220- and 440-yard free
styles last time the two met. Sprint
er Bill Spore could upset in the 100-
yard freestyle; however, Stanford's
Denny Stimson and Phil Gay will be
favored in this event.
Kapsuichi Mori, Japanese national
diving champion, will also be try
ing to bounce back after his defeat
by Bob Connti* of USC. Mori piled
up his largest amount of points this
year last weekend, but still lost to
the Trojan. John Trias and Jim
Lawson are Cal's only hopes in this
event.
John Weiser, Ron Grunt, and
Doug Ackerman, all winners last
week, are heavy favorites to repeat
against the Cal mermen.
WARMUP FOR PCC
The Cards will be using this meet
as a warmup for the PCC meet,
which will be held in Los Angeles
next week. Stanford will enter the j
conference meet as a favorite.
Alternating events with the var- j
sity will be the freshman teams of
both schools. Highlight of this meet i
will be Piobin Moore and his attempt
to break the national freshman rec
ord in the 100-yard freestyle. Last
time he swam, Moore did 50.7, }
which is only .1 second off the rec- j
ord. held by Ford Konno of Ohio
State.

ley record twice in the last two
weeks. So far Heim has lowered the
record three seconds—from 1:31.2 to
1:28.5.
The Indians, who humbled the
Bears 57-27 the last time the two
teams met, are a heavy favorite to
repeat the drubbing. The Cards
have no injured team members,
while the loss of sprinter Gordon
Mall will hurt the Cal cause. Hall
was a possible point scorer in either
the 50- or 100-yard freestyle.
WILBUR FAVORED
Favored to bounce back this week
is Cole Wilbur, who was edged out
last week by USC's Stan Horsely, in
the 200-yard breaststroke. Wilbur,
former PCC champion in this event,
should win easily.
Cal's only hope for a first place
lies with distance man Dave Rad
cliff, who beat Stanford's Dan Os
borne in the 220- and 440-yard free
styles last time the two met. Sprint
er Bill Spore could upset in the 100-
yard freestyle; however, Stanford's
Denny Stimson and Phil Gay will be
favored in this event.
Kapsuichi Mori, Japanese national
diving champion, will also be try
ing to bounce back after his defeat
by Bob Connti* of USC. Mori piled
up his largest amount of points this
year last weekend, but still lost to
the Trojan. John Trias and Jim
Lawson are Cal's only hopes in this
event.
John Weiser, Ron Grunt, and
Doug Ackerman, all winners last
week, are heavy favorites to repeat
against the Cal mermen.
WARMUP FOR PCC
The Cards will be using this meet
as a warmup for the PCC meet,
which will be held in Los Angeles
next week. Stanford will enter the j
conference meet as a favorite.
Alternating events with the var- j
sity will be the freshman teams of
both schools. Highlight of this meet i
will be Piobin Moore and his attempt
to break the national freshman rec
ord in the 100-yard freestyle. Last
time he swam, Moore did 50.7, }
which is only .1 second off the rec- j
ord. held by Ford Konno of Ohio
State.


TOM HAYNIE
Stanford's PCC champion swimmers, undefeated in four years
of collegiate dual meet competition, will be looking for another
victory to add to their string tomorrow when they meet Cal at
10 a.m. in the Berkeley Men's Gym pool.
Leading the Indians will be ace Larry Heim, who has broken

the PCC 150-yard individual med
ley record twice in the last two
weeks. So far Heim has lowered the
record three seconds—from 1:31.2 to
1:28.5.
