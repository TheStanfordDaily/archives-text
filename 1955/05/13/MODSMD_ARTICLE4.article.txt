VIKNNA â€” Russia bowed to a
United States ultimatum today and

agreed to an Austrian peace treaty
on Western terms.
The Reds had threatened to dead
lock the negotiations on the issue
of Austrian debt payments but
yielded to John Foster Dulles' ulti
matum, which read:
"Either agree on a completed
treaty draft, Or call off the meeting
at which the Big Four foreign min
isters are scheduled to sign the
treaty this Sunday."
The treaty - signing ceremonies
will be held Sunday at 11 a.m. (3
a.m. PDT), making Austria a free
nation for the first time in 17 years.
