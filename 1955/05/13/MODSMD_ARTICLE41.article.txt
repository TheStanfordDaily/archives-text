# Tribe Thinclads Compete In Fresno Relays Meet
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Bob Kimball gets another shot at the national collegiate javelin
record tomorrow evening in Fresno at the 29th annual West Coast
Relays.
In addition to Kimball, who lost an NCAA record Tuesday when
his javelin was 16 grams light, Stanford should have strong chal-

lengers in the 440. 880, and mile re
lays, Coach Jack Weiershauser said
yesterday.
Kimball is expected to have little
chance in the open javelin tomor
row because the meet should draw
such spear-tossing experts as world
record holder Bud Held, Bill Miller,
Cy Young, and Leo Long.
But after his 239-7 l /£ toss Tuesday
against SC, Kimball should be the
choice in the college ranks. His
closest competitors among colle
gians should be Lynne Greene of
San Jose and Farm teammate John
Bugge.
The relays will draw entries from
colleges and athletic clubs on the
coast and in addition individual
stars including America's greatest
miler, Wes Santee.
Two scoring systems will be used:
one for all teams and one exclusive
ly for college .squads. Southern Cal
ifornia is, as always, the favorite.
Indian quartets are entered in five
relays—44o, 880. mile .distance med
ley, and two-mile. Occidental is ex
pected to place its strength in the
two-mile race, with SC and UCLA
fighting it out in the medley.
GARRETT WELL
Stanford will concentrate on the
three shorter distances. Keith
Brownsberger and Walt Garrett will
run in all three. Weiershauser re
ported that Garrett has recovered
from his cold.
In the 440 baton race Loren So
renson, Garrett, Jim Saras, and
Brownsberger are scheduled to run
in that order. Saras, Frank Herr
mann, Brownsberger, and Garrett
will carry the mail for the Cards in
the 880.
In the mile relay, where the Tribe
will be trying to avenge losses to
Oxy, SC, and UCLA, Jim Luttrell,
Bernie Nelson, Brownsberger, and
Garrett will run the quarter-mile
assignments.
BROWNIE
Because Brownsberger will be
running in three relays within an
hour, he may not run in the open
100. Currently he is entered in a
heat with Oxy's Bill Calling. Saras
will be in with Jim Bugbee (SC),
Herbie Turner (Fresno State), and
Jim Plessas (Cal).
In the open 120-yard high hur
dles, Stanford will send Nelson into
a heat which includes Jim Ball
(UCLA). Luttrell's opposition will
include Will Wright (ex-SC, LA
AC) and Rafer Johnson (UCLA
frosh).
Stanford has numerous entries in
the field events. Among them are
Herrmann in the broad jump, A 1
Cheney in the shot put, Hank Rol
dan in the javelin, and Bill Flint
in the pole vault.

440 relay—Sorenson, Garrett, Sa

from his cold.
In the 440 baton race Loren So
renson, Garrett, Jim Saras, and
Brownsberger are scheduled to run
in that order. Saras, Frank Herr
mann, Brownsberger, and Garrett
will carry the mail for the Cards in
the 880.
In the mile relay, where the Tribe
will be trying to avenge losses to
Oxy, SC, and UCLA, Jim Luttrell,
Bernie Nelson, Brownsberger, and
Garrett will run the quarter-mile
assignments.
BROWNIE
Because Brownsberger will be
running in three relays within an
hour, he may not run in the open
100. Currently he is entered in a
heat with Oxy's Bill Calling. Saras
will be in with Jim Bugbee (SC),
Herbie Turner (Fresno State), and
Jim Plessas (Cal).
In the open 120-yard high hur
dles, Stanford will send Nelson into
a heat which includes Jim Ball
(UCLA). Luttrell's opposition will
include Will Wright (ex-SC, LA
AC) and Rafer Johnson (UCLA
frosh).
Stanford has numerous entries in
the field events. Among them are
Herrmann in the broad jump, A 1
Cheney in the shot put, Hank Rol
dan in the javelin, and Bill Flint
in the pole vault.

Bob Kimball gets another shot at the national collegiate javelin
record tomorrow evening in Fresno at the 29th annual West Coast
Relays.
In addition to Kimball, who lost an NCAA record Tuesday when
his javelin was 16 grams light, Stanford should have strong chal-

lengers in the 440. 880, and mile re
lays, Coach Jack Weiershauser said
yesterday.
Kimball is expected to have little
chance in the open javelin tomor
row because the meet should draw
such spear-tossing experts as world
record holder Bud Held, Bill Miller,
Cy Young, and Leo Long.
But after his 239-7 l /£ toss Tuesday
against SC, Kimball should be the
choice in the college ranks. His
closest competitors among colle
gians should be Lynne Greene of
San Jose and Farm teammate John
Bugge.
The relays will draw entries from
colleges and athletic clubs on the
coast and in addition individual
stars including America's greatest
miler, Wes Santee.
Two scoring systems will be used:
one for all teams and one exclusive
ly for college .squads. Southern Cal
ifornia is, as always, the favorite.
Indian quartets are entered in five
relays—44o, 880. mile .distance med
ley, and two-mile. Occidental is ex
pected to place its strength in the
two-mile race, with SC and UCLA
fighting it out in the medley.
GARRETT WELL
Stanford will concentrate on the
three shorter distances. Keith
Brownsberger and Walt Garrett will
run in all three. Weiershauser re
ported that Garrett has recovered
from his cold.
