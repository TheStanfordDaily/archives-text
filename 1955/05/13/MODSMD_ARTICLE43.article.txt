# Papooses Host Willow Glen High
## 
### 
Fresh from a week's rest after
their defeat by Cal's Cubs, Stan
ford's injury -riddled frosh baseball
team will host Willow Glen High
at 10 a.m. tomorrow on the frosh
diamond.
Coach Dick Clegg has practically
run out of third basemen for the
Papooses. Bob Dwight has not seen
action for several weeks because of
an ailing arm. Solid-hitting Bob
Flanders injured his ankle last week
and is not expected to take the field
against the Rams.
George Avery, crossfire throwing
right - bander, will open on the
mound for the Papooses.
