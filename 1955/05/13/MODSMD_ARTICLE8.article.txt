## Venetian, Dresden Glass Featured In Art Exhibit 
### 
Rare examples of Dresden and
Venetian glass of the 17th and
19tn centuries are on exhibit at
the Stanford Museum and will
remain throughout the summer.
A group of commemorative pieces
made in Dresden during the 17th
century is on loan from Mr. and
Mrs. Rudolf Muron of Atherton.
Italian pieces, lent by Mrs. Olive
H. Whittier of Pasadena, include an
Empire style blue agate statuette
bowl decorated with pearls and
enamel.
A 19th century Venetian agate
bowl is set with rose-cut diamonds,
emeralds, sapphires, pearls, and ru
bies, mounted in gold and silver.
The Maron collection contains
green glass tankards made at Dres
den in the 17th century, decorated
with opaque enamel showing the
imperial agle and coats of arms of
the sovereigns of the Holy Roman
Empire. White glass tankards bear
the Saxon coat of arms.
Work of John Melchior Dingling
er, lent by the Marons, includes
agate bowls with silver mountings
and two anniversary pitchers, one
decorated with heraldic devices and
the other with figures of the Em
pire's seven Prince Electors. Ruby
glasses in silver mountings, made
by John Kunkel, alchemist and
apothecary to John George 11, attain
their color through the addition of
particles of gold to the glass.
The Museum is open daily from
1 to 5 p.m. except Tuesdays when it
is closed.
