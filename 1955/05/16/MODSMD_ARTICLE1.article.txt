## Tribe Wins 2; Loses to USC 
### BILL NICHOLS Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford won two of their three weekend baseball games, but
the one they lost was the one they had to win. When USC won
the first game of the Saturday doubleheader 8-6, they clinched
both the CIBA and Southern Division PCC flags. Stanford bounced
back to win the second game 3-2 and whipped UCLA 3-1 on Friday.

Coach Everett Dean, who is retir
ing in June, was honored on Satur
day between games of the double
header. Players from both teams
lined up, while the Athletic De
partment presented Dean with a
Stanford blanket, and then the play
ers gave him a gold tie clasp and
cuff links. The cuff links had 1920
engraved on one side and 1955 on
the other to signify Dean's 35 years
of active coaching.
USC led 8-1 going into the final
inning but had to stave oft' a tre
mendous Indian rally in the first
contest. Walt Payne was very shaky,
especially in the first four frames
when the Trojans scored five runs.
He walked nine and gave up nine
hits, which kept him in constant hot
water, but the spirited Cards put on
a ninth-inning rally to come within
one hit of tying up the game, remi
niscent of the USC game two years
ago when Stanford, trailing 9-1 in
the eighth, won 11-10.
Bob Fletcher pinch hit for Payne
to start the rally and walked, as did
Ray Young, swinging for Hal Mess
ner. Then the Cards' third pinch
hitter, Dick Workman, bombed a
two - base hit to right, scoring
Fletcher. Mickey Holzman walked
to load the bases and Rich Scrama
glia's grounder forced the second
baseman as Young tallied.
YOUNG ENDS IT
Ron Marciel's single to center
scored Scramaglia after Rudy Fi
gueroa batted in a run on a ground
out. Len Swartz' walk finished Tro
jan starter Ralph Paussig and
brought on Jack Lovrich. The sec- !
ond USC hurler lasted only a short
time, walking Tom Dandurand and
Bob Fletcher, before SC coach Rod .
Dedeaux put in Marty Zuanich. {
Ray Young came to bat with two j
outs, the bases loaded, and the Cards J
two runs behind. Young, who had
won the Indians' last CIBA games j
with triples, took a called strike, j
then swung hard and missed for 0-2. |
Then he watched Zuanich's next
pitch over and heard umpire Don
Silva cry strike and the game was !
all over.
St SQUEAKS THROUGH
The Trojans looked very sharp j
through the first eight innings of the
game, keeping the basepaths warm
in all but two innings. But it wasn't i
until the ninth when they scored
three "insurance" runs that they
had enough to outlast the late-ral
lying Cards.
Gary Robin banged out his third
hit, and two walks loaded up the
bases, then a single by Bill Faddis
scored the Trojans' sixth and sev
enth runs. Mickey Holzman dropped
a pop fly for one more enemy tally.
