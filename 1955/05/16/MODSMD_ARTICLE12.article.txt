# Fisher Views Red Policy

### HELEN DEWAR 
The recent Soviet peace over
tures represents an over - all
change in Communist tactics
aimed at presenting the Soviet
Union as the champion of peace
and independence.
Harold H. Fisher, chairman of
Hoover Institute an'd Library, of
fered, in a Daily interview, this ex
planation of the recent sequence of
events that have seemed to indicate
a shift in Communist strategy from
that of leading the banner against
capitalism to that of appearing to
lead the world toward peace.
The Soviets in the last few months
have appeared willing to consider
President Eisenhower's atom-pool
ing plans, negotiate a treaty of peace
with Austria, participate in disarm
ament discussions, and propose a
unification treaty for Germany.
Dr. Fisher commented that "this
move began before Stalin died, but
has been shaping up particularly in
the last two years."
"They no longer talk about a class
war," the Russian specialist pointed
out, "but prefer to discuss 'peaceful
coexistence'."
"It is important to remember,
though," he reminded, "that this
means a change in policy, but not in
goal. The policy up to now has re
sulted in the rearmament of the
Free World and the development of
collective securitv."

"Now,' Dr. Fisher said, "they
have decided that it is more to their
advantage to bring about disarma
ment and lessening of tensions."
Pointing out that unification and
neutralism are two of the strongest
aspirations of the German people
who are wearied of militarism and
war, Dr. Fisher stated that the main
.strategy ol the Russians in regard
to Germany is to slow down ratifi
cation ol the West European Union
and cieat a strong neutralist senti
ment.
In regard to Adenauer's strength.
Fisher believes that his position is
stronger because of the West Ger
man economic recovery and because
his government has become the ob
ject of solicitation of other Western
powers.
The Russians, he said, are doing
"all they can to impress the Ger
mans by the Austrian treaty which
has given them reunification and
neutrality."
As well as the strong feeling of
post-war anti-militarism. Dr. Fish
er said that there is a potent eco
nomic argument in that the cost of
armament takes money from the
nation's standard of living."
Instead of styling themselves as
the "leaders of the toiling and ex
ploited masses," Dr. Fisher com
mented, the Communists now seek
to influence everyone, especially
the middle classes, by their new
policy of peace, coexistence, and in
dependence before all.
