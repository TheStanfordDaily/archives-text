JOHN LELANI)
Three important points merit
mention. First, with the new con
stitution shedding a new light on
the office, sight should not be lost of
the fact that the president's first
duty lies with the class. Second, a
well-executed questionnaire, pool
ing all the candidates' ideas and
combining them with other relevant
matters, will mean that the class of
ficers stand for what the class wants,
not what they themselves want.
Third, in dealing with all projected
senior year activities, the officers
must be careful not to overestimate
class spirit and must seek to foster
it, not impose upon it.

JIM SMITH
The . . . senior class president . . .
next) . . . year . . . will be a mem
ber oi the Cabinet created by the
new constitution. . . . There is a
great ne ed for -an organization such
as this to co-ordinate the functions
of the many different boards and
classes.
I would like to . . . extend . . .
class activities to as many members
of the class as have a desire to help.
I would try to instill in (Activities
Board) members a feeling of im
portance and responsibility by giv
ing them essential work to do and
making them a sounding board for
class opinion and ideas.

TOM TELFEK
I would find out what the class
wanted to do through an active,
well - represented Activities Board.
. . . I would get Activities Board
and class excom together to make
a list of suggested activities . . .
The lists would then be passed out
to all the class, to check which
would cast its vote on the activities
desired,
I would try to make a stronger
Activities Board and class excom. A
more wide representation of the
class on the boards is needed.

CAL TILDEN
With the junior class president a
voting member of the new ASSU
cabinet, I feel closer contact between
the class officers and the juniors will
be of paramount importance.
Having . . . observed the work
ings of class government, I feel this
contact could be established by
greater interest in the Activities
Board and more complete informa
tion on class affairs ... I would
like to see a better spread of repre
sentation in the various living
groups.

TOM DICCKEK
The Class of 1958 is about to be
confronted by a serious problem.
Next year, it will be divided into '58
living units, and its constitutional
representation as a class is apt to be
weak. There is an eminent need for
strong leadership, for class interest,
and for class participation. The class
must start a fresh page next year
with new ideas and new talent be
cause this problem must be solved.
In order to keep ourselves as a
group . . . we must give serious
thought to . . . encournginr; partiri
pat ion and interest,

(Â»ARY THl'KX
Since next year our class will bi
spread out, a unifying agent will be
necessary. The Social Activities
Board . . , will have the duty of
unifying the class.
The duty of the president will be
to see that Excom will have a new
group of interested people. In addi
tion. he will have for his duties or
ganizing Excom to handle class
functions (and) offering . . . oppor
tunity to participate in . . . class
activities. The . . . president should
have . . . above all the desire to
see that our class maintains the high
level . . . established this year.
