# Event to Be In Cubberley
## 
### 
The two key figures in torn
morrow's final elections-—ASSU
presidential candidates Nathan
Leanse and George Ralph—wiil
face each other in a specially
arranged debate tonight on the
stage of Cubberley Auditorium.
Leading off at 8 p.m., the two
candidates will deliver short speeches
outlining their platforms and clari
fying their stands on major cam
paign issues.
Alone on the stage, the two prin
cipals will cross-examine each other
in fifteen-minute sessions, winding
up with brief summaries. Moder
ator for the debate will be ASSU
President Peter Bing.
Sponsored by the Stanford Po
litical Union, the debate may be, in
the words of Election Board officials,
! "the most important thing, as far as
the candidates are concerned, in the
j whole campaign, as it will be their
| final statement of policy."
A strict time limit has been set
J on the debate, according to Election
Board Chairman Eric Flicker, who
added that there would probably be
I no questioning from the floor al
j lowed. He said that campus police
j have been alerted to turn out in
! force to handle the expected ca
j pacity crowd.
Stanford radio station KZSU an
! nounced that it will record the en
i tire debate, to be broadcast later to
night from 9 to 10.
Ralph, a junior history major, ex
plained that his talk "will simply
be an elaboration of my previous
statements. The issues at Cubber
ley," he said, "will be essentially the
new student government, the posi
! tion of the student body president,
the Honor Code, and other related
j isuses."
ISSUES
Leanse, 21-year-old junior and
member of Phi Kappa Psi, said he
j expected the main issue he will dis
cuss would be NSA, the Honor Code,
! and "construction, rather than de
struction, of student government."
Ralph, an off-campus student from
I Painesville, Ohio, topped Leanse in
last week's primary elections by a
bare seventeen votes. Campaignin",
j for a reduction in the functions ol
j student government, Ralph oppose ,
Leanse's platform of more use of
student government, increased stu
dent interest, and delegation of au
j thority through more use of govern
! ment forms.
The campaign, perhaps one of the
most hotly-contested in ASSU hist
ory, set records last week with a
vote in the primary topping 55 pei
cent of the total student strength.
BUSY WEEK
The past week, a busy one for the
' two candidates, has been taken up
with talks before different groups,
but it was felt that in the iriteiest
of better understanding of each can
didate's views, a special debate
: should be arranged.
In line with interest generated,
I several different student groups
have swung en bloc to support of one
of the two candidates; but other con
testants in the primaries denied giv
ing their support to either finalist.
Both candidates have been invited
by the Encina Club to attend an in
formal question-and-answer session
tonight after the debate, according
to vice-president Robert H. Leekley
Only Encina Club members would
be present at the ten o'clock session,
he said, and a student moderator
would conduct the discussion.
