One thing Stanford has always been blessed
with is top flight coaches. Top flight in regard
to their ability and top flight personality-wise.
This is most certainly the case with Everett
Dean who will end a long and glorious career
tomorrow afternoon when the last out is re
corded in the Stanford-California baseball
game.
Dean was a Utile known Indiana University
graduate when he took up the coaching reins
at Minnesota's Carleton College thirty-five
years ago. His fame grew and spread as he
moved along to his alma mater to lead the
basketball and baseball teams to three champ
ionships apiece in 14 years.
In 1939 he arrived on the Stanford scene and
concentrated on keeping Farm basketball on
the level that Hank Luisetti had placed it. Dean
was successful in this venture as his 1942 club
brought the national championship home from
Kansas City. A fellow named Dallmar helped
play a part here.

In 1950 the Card mentor took up the baseball
challenge and in the ensuing six years led the
Indian nine to two league pennants and his
1953 club reached the NCAA championships
before being eliminated.
Dean has always been more than just a good
coach. He has always been a gentleman of [he
sport, a credit to the game and the schools he
has representatived. The records he's estab
lished and the athletes that he's sent into pro
fessional sports bear out his coaching genius.
The friends he's made and the respect he's
earned speak for his personality.
The Indiana gentleman was honored by
players, coaches, and friends Saturday between
games of the USC doubleheader. Wo can only
echo their sentiments and feelings in wishing
Everett Dean long life and happiness on his In
diana farm where he will retire in memories
of a job well done.


EVERETT DEAN HONORED FOR HIS SEVENTEEN YEARS OF STANFORD COACHING
