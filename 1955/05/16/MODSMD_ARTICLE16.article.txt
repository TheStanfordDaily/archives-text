That giant tidal wave known as ASSU elec
tions rushes over the campus tomorrow and
Wednesday as thousands of students will flow
to the polls to support their standard bearer.
Regardless of who is swept into office in the
election tide another record vote is expected
as we mature Stanford students recognize our
democratic duty and shake off these overtones
of apathy. Ballots are more effective than bul
lets, the pen is mightier than the sword, liberty,
eguality, and fraternity . . . yeah, yeah—Thank
you Steve Wilson of the Illustrated Press.
Thursday the Northern California and Hawaii
branch of the Society of American Bacteriol
ogists will pitch tent in ihe Bacteriology Build
ing at 3 p.m., in a general meeting which will
probably evoke discussion of Pasteur's recent
discoveries....
The Swimming team will go after its sixth
straight PCC title as it travels to Los Angeles
Thursday for the four-team meet. The Indian
Cardsharks (oh, very witty boy) are continu
ally the winningest team on campus and aren't
about lo lose that highly prized championship
chattel this week. . . .

"Givem Hell good an' plenty Stanford In
dians 1920," "Play it loose and play it safe,
Stanford class of '38," "Hard as nails, full of
tricks, Stanford class of '46." Here it is gang,
its bigger than both of us, its bigger than Ring
ling Brothers, more powerful than a Shrine
convention. . . . it's Alumni Day. The 23rd An
nual Stanford Conference emerges on the
campi (campi meaning just all over the campus)
Saturday. The Annual Alumni Assembly will

assemble in Bowman Alumni House for a panel j
discussion "Stanford What Now?" You mean j
there's more ...?
King football will bow out with a boom Sat
urday morning when Chuck Taylor sends his
boys through the final scrimmage of the spring.
New cheerleader Jim Walters will lead one
rooting scction and old trouper Ed Mahoney
will head the other in a show of spirit. The
final scrimmage on other campuses has always
been a major production and there's a move
afoot to get the Tribe fans out for the sneak
preview of the '55 team. If it's Stanford football,
it's got to be good. . . .

"From the foothills to the Bay, it shall ring '
as we sing ..." a galaxy of voices will fill the
air Saturday evening as one of Stanford's top
activities, Spring Sing, commences at 7:15 in
Frost Amphitheater. Multi song groups will vie
for the top accolades which leads one to think
. . . is there a doctor in the house?
The dashing, devil-may-care rogue of the
sound screen, "The Scarlet Pimpernel," will go
into action' Sunday evening before the Flicks
fans with Leslie "Gone with the Wind" Howard,
Merle "Dark Waters" Oberon and Raymond
"East of Palo Alto" Massey in the leading roles.
Also up for grabs are two UPA Kartunes.
