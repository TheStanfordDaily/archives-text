# Conclusions of Lung Cancer Study Given
## 
### 
Conclusions in a recent study by
Dr. L. Henry Garland, a well-known
San Francisco radiologist of the
Stanford Medical School, indicate
that less than one in ten victims of
lung cancer survive more than five
years and that greater use should be
made of generally available X-ray
therapy in the care and treatment
of lung cancer today.
"Average survival time after diag
nosis is considerably shorter than
many clinicians appear to realize,"
Garland told a recent meeting of
doctors in Washington, D.C. "The
occasional patient who shows a long
survival, either spontaneously or
because of treatment, tends to re
main uppermost in the mind."
The radiologist based his conclu
sions on 25 years' experience with
more than 500 patients at San Fran
cisco Hospital, plus a smaller group
of private patients. He also re
viewed reports made by other doc
tors in medical literature.
"Of 100 unselected patients with
lung cancer, it may be expected
that about half will be inoperable
at the time of diagnosis, and the
other half eligible for exploration.
Of the latter, about half will also
prove inoperable, while the other 25
per cent will be resectable (amen
able to surgical removal of cancer)."
The Stanford physician said that
the most effective curative treat
ment for lung cancer is surgery,
simple or radical, depending on the
stage and type of disease and the
patient's condition; however, vari
ous types of X-ray therapy are
used.
"Judging by experience, average
survival time after diagnosis of 75
inoperable patients will be from
three to six months. The chance of
such increased survival is augment
ed by moderate-dose X-ray ther
apy to the primary cancer site and
its area of spread. Even when sur
vival time is not prolonged, the pa
tient is usually made more com
fortable by such treatment."
