# Air Raid!---Stanford Would Be Prepared
## 
### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
Look around you sometime when you're on Quad. Someplace
—on the wall, on a bulletin board or a door—you'll see a little blue
and white sign. It's labeled "AIR RAID INSTRUCTIONS."
If you look at it more closely you'll see that the word "drop"
is repeated at the beginning of almost every paragraph: "Drop
to floor. Bury face in arms." ♦

! Stanford's -Fire Chief John Mars-
I ton. explaining the new Air Raid in
j structions recently set up by Civil
Defense, didn't elaborate. In case of
of "Red Alert," he says: "I'd run,
i brother. Just run for cover." Under
j the present warning system, a red
I alert means "air attack imminent,"
| and begins here on the Stanford
campus with a wailing, up-and-down
I blast of the firehouse siren, continu
j ing for three minutes.
In a more cheerful tone. Chief
Marston explained that a steady blast
on the siren lasting from three to
five minutes heralds a "Yellow
Alert"—air attack probable but not
imminent.
Chief Marston is one of a well
organized group which would have
little time for head-ducking in case
of any disaster. As head of the Fire
Department he is a member of the
Disaster Committee, which includes
functions such as that of the Police
Department, Medical Service, In
formation Center, Emergency Hous
ing, Food Service, Military Aid, and
Public Works.

The Disaster Committee, attached
to the county Civil Defense organi
zation, is, in the words of P. G.
DufFy, committee chief of staff, "all
j set up and ready to go." He explained
that in the case of an air-raid there
are several alternate plans set up,
any one of which would immediately
I go into effect depending on the se
riousness of the disaster.
"We have Plan A, for instance," he
I explained; "that's in case of five
atomic bursts—three water and two
air." The plan would begin with an
announcement over the special Dis
; aster Control radio network, which
J operates 24 hours a day.
The call would be forwarded to

Committee Commander All' E. Bran
din, University Business Manager,
and simultaneously the alarm would
be set off. Heads of the different de
partments would meet at the fire
house with the exception of the Med
j ical Service, which would go into
I action at the Health Service.

j Chief Counsellor for Men Richard

| Student Information Service, which
j would handle all requests for in
| formation by and about students in
the disaster. ROTC Major D. R.
I Whitaker would take charge of all
Army, Navy, and Air Force ROTC
j cadets on the drill field.
What part do the students play in
Civil Defense? Very little, says Chief
I Marston. "The program wasn't set
I up to include students," he explains.
| "because a disaster might occur any
| time, when the students aren't here."
Largest student group involved
\ would be the ROTC cadets, who
i would report to the drill field and
j be assigned as auxiliary police and
| firemen and to assist the Public
: Works committee in rescue and de
i molition.
Other students who would help
I fight the disaster are the regular
student firemen—l 7 of them—spon
sors, R.A.'s, and student air-raid
wardens in each living group.
"We're ready," says Brandin of
Stanford's Civil Defense. "Let's hope
we don't have to go to work."

of "Red Alert," he says: "I'd run,

campus with a wailing, up-and-down
I blast of the firehouse siren, continu

In a more cheerful tone. Chief
Marston explained that a steady blast
on the siren lasting from three to
five minutes heralds a "Yellow

imminent.
Chief Marston is one of a well

little time for head-ducking in case
of any disaster. As head of the Fire

that in the case of an air-raid there
are several alternate plans set up,
any one of which would immediately
I go into effect depending on the se

"We have Plan A, for instance," he
I explained; "that's in case of five

air." The plan would begin with an
announcement over the special Dis
; aster Control radio network, which
J operates 24 hours a day.
The call would be forwarded to
