# Questionnaires Sent to Seniors
## Answers to SUE-Prepared Poll To Evaluate Undergrad Career 
### 
Questionnaires regarding many phases of campus life will go
in the mail today to all graduating seniors, inviting them to evalu
ate their undergraduate career at Stanford.
The questionnaire has been prepared by the Student Committee
of the Study of Undergraduate Education (SUE), in co-operation

with Professor Robert Hoopes, SUE
assistant director.
Opinions gathered in this com
prehensive poll will be influential
in helping determine the architec
ture of the new four-year program
which the SUE is preparing to sub
mit to the Academic Council, Hoopes
explained.
The eight-page questionnaire is
expected to reach some 1,000 grad
uating seniors. A self - addressed,
stamped envelope is enclosed, to
make returning the answers as con
venient as possible for the student.
Replies will be completely anony
mous.
RATING SCALES
Elaborate rating scales have been
devised to let students express their
attitudes. They will be asked to
evaluate a list of lower division
courses, personal relations with stu
dents and faculty, quality of teach
ing, attributes of education devel
oped, and other topics.
Only a few questions require an
essay - type answer. For instance,
one question reads "Which year at
Stanford have you enjoyed the
most? (Check freshman, sophomore,
junior, or senior.) Any special rea
son for your answer?"
The mailing list for the question
naire was compiled directly from the
degree application list, and hence
will reach just those graduating in
June.
If, by accident, a graduating sen
ior does not receive a questionnaire
in the mail by the end of the week,
he may pick one up in the SUE of
fice, Room 15, in the basement of
Cubberley.
CO-OPERATION HOPED
The student committee hopes for
full co-operation of the senior class.
The more answers received, the
more meaningful the survey will be.
The SUE director's office estimat
ed that the tabulation of answers
would not be done until the end of
June. It may take 1,000 man-hours
to analyze and correlate the results.
Sarge Horwood, chairman of the
student committee, explained that
the committee decided to undertake
the questionnaire project because it
considered that the best way to
help the faculty committee was to
furnish it with a broad idea of stu
dent opinion.
In preparing the questions, the
committee split into four subcom
mittees,
