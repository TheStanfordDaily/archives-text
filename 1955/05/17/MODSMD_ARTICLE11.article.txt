rium last night as George Ralph
and Nate Leanse ended their
formal campaign for the ASSU

thusiastic portion of the student
body.

hearted attention as they listened to
two different approaches to the
problem of student body govern
ment and the role of the president.
Ralph stressed amendments which
he felt were needed in the new gov
ernment setup. Leanse countered

In response to student demand,

election debate between presiden
tial candidates George Ralph and
Nate Leanse at 8:30 tonight.

with a program of giving the new
student body government a chance
to prova itself before reforms were
brought forth.
RALPH DECLARATION
In his 10 - minute speech which
began the program, Ralph declared,
"I do not intend to overthrow all
student government." He outlined
reforms which he believed were
necessary before the government
could work to the best interests of
the students. He voiced the fear that
under the new government the Leg
islature would tend to become "a
rubber stamp organization." He de
clared that this difficulty could be
eliminated through the abolition of
the Cabinet.
Ralph suggested that many of the
organizations such as Drives Com
mittee and Cardinals, Speech Activ
ities and Political Union, be com
bined. He declared himself against
the present system of selecting com
mittee members.

LEANSE PROGRAM

Leanse proposed a four-point pro
gram of strengthening the new gov
ernment from within without re
forming it. First, he advocated an
intensive education program in stu
dent government for the incoming
freshmen.
"At times," he said, "there should
be a periodic inspection of the gov
ernment to see if it is doing the job
it should be doing." He added that
the students could add their voice
in student government by filling out
questionnaires which would be run
through an IBM machine.
He concluded his program by ad
vocating that the legislators should
be encouraged in their tasks of
faithfully representing their con
stituents.
Both candidates expressed the be
lief that the whole student body
should vote on NSA when it next
comes up for renewal.
The formal speech session was fol
lowed by seven - minute periods
during which the candidates fired
questions at each other.
The question period was a spirited
one, with the candidates trying to
pin each other down on previous
statements, while the crowd eagerly
watched the verbal battle.

election debate between presiden
tial candidates George Ralph and
Nate Leanse at 8:30 tonight.

with a program of giving the new
student body government a chance
to prova itself before reforms were
brought forth.
RALPH DECLARATION
In his 10 - minute speech which
began the program, Ralph declared,
"I do not intend to overthrow all
student government." He outlined
reforms which he believed were
necessary before the government
could work to the best interests of
the students. He voiced the fear that
under the new government the Leg
islature would tend to become "a
rubber stamp organization." He de
clared that this difficulty could be
eliminated through the abolition of
the Cabinet.
Ralph suggested that many of the
organizations such as Drives Com
mittee and Cardinals, Speech Activ
ities and Political Union, be com
bined. He declared himself against
the present system of selecting com
mittee members.

LEANSE PROGRAM

Leanse proposed a four-point pro
gram of strengthening the new gov
ernment from within without re
forming it. First, he advocated an
intensive education program in stu
dent government for the incoming
freshmen.
"At times," he said, "there should
be a periodic inspection of the gov
ernment to see if it is doing the job
it should be doing." He added that
the students could add their voice
in student government by filling out
questionnaires which would be run
through an IBM machine.
He concluded his program by ad
vocating that the legislators should
be encouraged in their tasks of
faithfully representing their con
stituents.
Both candidates expressed the be
lief that the whole student body
should vote on NSA when it next
comes up for renewal.
The formal speech session was fol
lowed by seven - minute periods
during which the candidates fired
questions at each other.
The question period was a spirited
one, with the candidates trying to
pin each other down on previous
statements, while the crowd eagerly
watched the verbal battle.
(See page 2 for digest of the
complete debate.)
There wasn't an empty seat
to be had in Cubberley Audito
rium last night as George Ralph
and Nate Leanse ended their
formal campaign for the ASSU
presidency before a wildly en
thusiastic portion of the student
body.
The students gave their whole
hearted attention as they listened to
two different approaches to the
problem of student body govern
ment and the role of the president.
Ralph stressed amendments which
he felt were needed in the new gov
ernment setup. Leanse countered
