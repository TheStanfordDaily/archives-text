As this campaign has drawn to a
close, its appearance has changed j
considerably. In fact, there has been
a complete revex-sal. It is no longer
a question of governemnt versus no
government. The question remain
ing is, what approach will be taken
in maintaining government here at
Stanfordâ€”a positive or a negative
approach.
The re-evaluation of the nine
boards and nine commissions which
make up the ASSU structure must
be accomplished in a productive
way. The students, in electing the
student body president, will deter
mine that approach.
The greatest challenge facing the
president next year, I believe, will
be that of making the new constitu
tion meaningful and effective in the
eyes of the students. This I feel can
be accomplished by a program of |
education, evaluation, question
naires, and effort on the part of the
legislators. Government can be
made more meaningful if it is ap- I
proached in this constructive, posi
tive way.

| It seems to me that the recent
j trend in student opinion indicates a
desire for a re-evaluation of student
government and a revitalization of
its various organs. I feel that boards
and committees should be free to
operate on their own, continuing to
remain subject to the Legislature as
far as the granting of budget is con
cerned.
Those organizations which are not
producing results will work them
selves out of a job. The duties of the
Legislature can then be simplified,
that group deciding only those is
sues which actually require a higher
representative body. In considering
committees, I think that a suitable
method of obtaining interested
members should be kept in mind.
Many students feel that too few
people are given a chance to partici
: pate because less experienced and
lesser-known applicants are turned
away. It may be that a large number
of students will still feel unaffected
, by student government, but nothing
j can be lost by cleaning away as
much wastage as possible.
