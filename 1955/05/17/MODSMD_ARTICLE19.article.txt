# Speech Student Found Innocent In Honor Case
## 
### 
A speech and drama student was
brought before the Council for Stu
dent Control on two charges of vio
lating the Honor Code and was
found not guilty on both counts.
The student was suspected of
looking over another student's
shoulder on the first count, and of
hearing an answer mentioned dur
ing the class and copying it down
on his paper on the second count.
After copying the answer onto his
paper and handing it in, the student
went to the professor on his own
volition and asked that the ques
tions not be considered in grading
the paper.
It was thus felt by the Council,
that he thereby freed himself from
an Honor Code violation by admit
ting what he had done to the pro
fessor before handing his paper in
for grading.
The student was found not guilty
because of adequate explanation of
the charges in both cases.
