### 
It's an old Stanford tradition--each graduat
ing class donates a memorial gift to the Uni
versi! y.
!./ iiric- classes are commemorated by a drink
ing lounlain on Quad; others donate andirons
for liowman Alumni House.
The Class of '55 has been given an oppor
tvmily to add a new twist to an old tradition
in .iddiliDn !o their endowment of the '55 Herit
age fund, they are now invited to donate in
formation.
Today questionnaires will be mailed lo every
guduating senior questionnaires that seek to
evaluate Stanford's strengths and weaknesses
in the fields of academics and extra-curricular
activities.
In answering the questions, each senior will
be (\illed upon to evaluate, with honesty and
thoughtfulness, his four years at Stanford.
Thin will take time, but it will be time well
spent.

Now more than ever, with the Board of Trus
tees considering a proposal to overhaul the
present Upper and Lower Division program,
student opinions are needed.
Students have voiced criticisms of
academic and activity program to friends but
have, consciously or sub consciously, asked,
"What is my personal opinion worth? What
good it do?"
That guestion can be answered now.
The personal opinion of each senior, cloaked
in the anonymity of the questionnaires, will be
joined With the opinions of other seniors in
helping to mould an improved undergraduate
program at Stanford.
As each graduating member of the Class of
'55 receives his questionnaire in the mail, he is
being given a chance to contribute to his class's
gift to Stanford. A ICJO per cent response will
make that gift a truly worthwhile one,
