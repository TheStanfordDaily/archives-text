i am myself button
To the Editor:
Sometime during the four years he is an under
graduate, a student ask,s himself why he is being edu
cated. The answer has something to do with a better
quality of his life after graduation. A liberal arts edu
cation i l . a luxury. Vocational training at the uni
versity lev. I i' a luxury. These two forms of educa
tion are not mutually exclusive. If a student thinks
of lii education as a means by which he will be able
to teak - money, then he will be impatient with ele
ment'. in his education not conducive to that end.
However, if a student is hungry to know why life is
wo! 11l living, and who and what he is, and why mid
i wi*i,'tiet!i century civilization is the way it is, and
.vhat, it ail means to him as number one, then he can
find something to chew on in everything he learns.
Mr. Cohen's letter (Daily, May 9), and Miss
lf< ingot's letter (Daily, May 13), both contain the
•.i>ll o fallacies. They imply that liberal arts equals
I) ll< I,'ftri-s. They imply that the study of humani
tie i something which contributes lo the niceties
(,!' lift- b;il which has little to do with making a good
living. And talk about toe-sticking! The notion of
< unfining broad education to the high schools over
look the psychological fact that high school students
:,m- inim itin The high school student i.s interested
in him elf, not in himself abstracted as a responsible
adult The high school student learns facts, tech
nique . if he is lucky he learns how to-question what
lie i learning, i! he is luckier still he does some in
'(< |j< ndont thinking. But rare is the adolescent who
r j-"in:/, to care about epistemology or the inner self
i>l Shakespeare or why El Greco makes him gasp.
Win ii a student does not care about what he is
I:arning, then be is toe-sticking, learning words,
names for things When a person dives into an in
i» i • t head first, he gets drenched. The person who
plunges into engineering graduates with his "I am an
en; .net i button, but the person who plunges into
the liberal arts is aiming for an "1 am myself" button.
A person never truly graduates from a plunge into the
'human spirit. The deeper one dives, the wider one
.vim.', the more one knows that Man is a mighty
ocean, unfathomable.
"Tin unexamined life is not worth living." The
mi n who were mo: t. vehement about this statement:

.Torus Christ, Socrates, Thoreau, are in (lie past. Does
lime affect a true statement? "Know thyself." Was
Socrates speaking only to the Athenians? The ideas
about life and living that are important are important
because they are told by men to Man. Here are a
lew questions, directed in particular to those stu
dents to whom "education" means "training for a
profession," and who ask nothing more from a uni
versity education than ihe .security of a respectable
job when they graduate. "To thine own self be true":
Do you know what that .statement means? Do you
know why it is important to be true to yourself? Do
you care? Do you know your own self? Don't try
to answer in one sentence, part of the enigma of
"Hamlet" lies there.
It i.s a fact of life that human beings have to work
for a living, but let's not confuse a good income with
a good living. Mr. Agate said, "We (liberal arts ma
jors) can recognize a half-truth." He made a daring
statement, because that is what we hope we can do,
that is what we want to do. But the mere one thinks
the more one knows that one does not know much
of anything. The more fields of knowledge a person
investigates, the more he realizes how little i.s his
wisdom. The trouble with specialization i.s that a
person accumulates more and more knowledge of
one field and never realizes how much he does not
know. II is time, in international disputes as well as
in campus controversies, that individuals realized that
il one feels condescending it means that one's self
i.s narrow.
Certainly, it i.s rather difficult for the engineering or
science or education major to care about a .'mother
ing survey of western civilization and the imposition
of elementary composition and all the other introduc
tion to the ocean courses. 1 am a philosophy major,
also taking the Humanities Program; I found the
physical science survey nauseating. But aren't these
at-first-distasteful introductions similar to the stick
ing of one's toe into cold, unafimiiiar waters? The
water feels warmer after one lias plunged into it.
Mr. Cohen might be speaking after thinking, when
he implies, "Who wants it?" about the liberal arts;
he might not. After all. a person's education is for
the prison's own benefit. Only secondarily does it
benefit Society or The Corporation or the Army.
Some people do believe that a good income is the
same as a full life. Some do not. "'Tastes differ,'
said the old woman as she kissed the cow."
