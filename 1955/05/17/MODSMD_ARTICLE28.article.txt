ASSU President Pete Bing in
troduced the candidates, George

a 10-niinute opening address, qui/,
each other in four seven-minute
periods, and linish with a sum

GEORGE RALPH

A number of you have heard me
in your living groups. I feel I may
have left some of you unsatisfied.
. . . I do riot intend to overthrow
student government. It would be
impossible.
I do not, have not ever, and I
don't expect to ride a motorcycle.
. . . J hope the campaign will be
fought on issues rather than per
sonalities. The stories circulating
are quite untrue; we are not gutter
snipes. None of my friends have
ever appeared on a charge of Honor
Code violation.
What concrete things do I propose
to do?
The Cabinet shall assist the presi
dent in the co-ordination of ASSU
activities. ... I propose reform in
Legislature and Cabinet; executive
power is concentrated in the hands
of the Cabinet under the present
setup.
Having committee chairmen for
executive offices is inexcusable.
Here is an example of undemocratic
government: rubber - stamping the
president's decision. The Legisla
ture is a body of your representa
tives. The Cabinet is a closet cor
poration of the president and made
up of committee heads.
Class affairs can just as well be
handled completely independent of
it. . . . lIR could take under its
wing Foreign Scholarship Commit
tee. Duties of public relations can
be combined with the Student-Fac
ulty Committee; thus reforms could
be carried with adequate student
government. . . .
Any man should be able to run for
head yell leader. He should work in
close co-operation with Rally Com.
I have nothing personal against
NSA; we joined it through undemo
cratic processes. Students should
have a chance to vote on it, I be
lieve. I proposed this; it was origi
nal with me.
One should- be innocent until
proven guilty. What if you were a
student, would you want your char
acter blighted for the rest of your
life? I object to accusations tanta
mount to guilt in the Honor Code.
Student apathy is a definite failing
which can't be corrected by student
officers. ...
I expect no support in my stand
of the various Com-ocrats. I feel
that reform is necessary; it would
be my mandate from the students
to do all that I can to carry out these
reforms. . . .

NATE LEANSE

In answer to various questions
which people have asked me about
my campaign: By joining NSA, we
can make our voice heard on vari
ous campuses and in national af
fairs. I am strongly in favor of our
affiliation but I feel students should
decide.
During the campaign as a result
of the recent clarification of the
Honor Code, it has been said that
wc have an Honor Code without
honor. There is a basic misunder
standing. It was never stated by the
faculty lhat tests could be taken
from the room. The clarification is
not a change, but a return to what
was originally granted. The Honor
Code is a privilege. It builds re
sponsibility and integrity.
How would construction be car
ried out? First there must be an
education program on student gov
ernment. The faculty explains aca

demic life (to incoming freshmen).
! There also (should be) time ... to
j explain student government.
In some universities, there is a
one-unit, one-quarter course in stu
dent government. It is necessary
(to find out what education pro
gram is best for Stanford) when
student government is accused of
being, in essence, composed of mul
j titudinous, driveling committees.
; There are only 18 committees for a
community of 7.000.
They perform functions for which
the administration would otherwise
have to pay. The criteria for evalu
ation of these committees should be
! determined by the Legislature. IBM
; cards or a questionnaire system
could be devised to see what stu
dents desire in the way of activities.
The campaign has undergone a
change of appearance ... a complete
reversal. No longer is it "govern
ment versus no government" but
rather a question of a positive or a
negative approach (to government).
In the May 10 Daily . . . the ASSU
was evaluated as a "head hand
shaker." If this is the concept of
the role, then either the possibili
! ties of achievement are overlooked,
or there is a negative attitude to
ward ASSU government. The . . .
president's role (must) not be de
formalized or reduced. For a more
1 meaningful, mors effective govern
ment, the president's role must be
elevated to face the . . . obvious . . .
challenge of making teh new consti
tution meaningful and effective in
j the eyes of the students.
This can be achieved through ed
j ucation and evaluation by many
willing hands. . . . ASSU govern
ment can be made more meaning
ful to students if approached in a
! constructive, positive way.
After Lcanse's opening speech,
Ring switched (lie program into a
question-and-answer period be
tween the two candidates. Eeanse
asked the opening round of qucs
j tions.
LEANSE
You said in your speech you
would abolish the Cabinet. How
could you achieve co-ordination of
the major activities?
RALPH
I believe co-ordination should
come from the Legislature. The
Cabinet does not have this power,
but would come to assert this pow
er. Committees with autonomy
would be able to work with just as
much efficiency and save the Legis
lature for really essential problems.
I,EANSE
I asked you the other evening
what we should do away with in
student government; you said Rally
j Com should be done away with.
RALPH
Did you quote me as saying Rally
Com should be done away with? 11

I said to do away with Rally Com
I'm very sorry .' . , there may be
some people from Rally Com in the
audiencie. . . .
LEANSE
Are you in favor of abolishing all
committees?
RALPH
My idea is not to abolish commit
tees at the outset. Give them a
chance to produce results. Let them
have a party but they won't need
ASSU funds.
'I' li e seven-and-a-half-minute
period closed. Riiitf gave Ralph
the floor to question Leanse.
RALPH
You are for construction, not de
struction. How do you propose to
construct on a constitution already
constructed?
LEANSE
George, I think I did mention that
in my speech. I don't mean adding
to or building on the constitution
but a strengthening within, a con
structive approach.
RALPH
It seems to me that the students
have expressed a desire that some
reform is necessary. I want to know
what you think about this.
LEANSE
I cannot tell whether reform is
necessary until I can put the pro
gram I have proposed in working
order. IBM cards or no, I cannot
tell. .
RALPH
Am I correct in assuming that
NSA should be put up to the stu
dents to decide?
LEANSE
Yes.
RALPH
Would you agree that the appear
ance clause of the Honor Code is
somewhat unfortunate?
LEANSE
I don't understand what you mean
by the appearance clause.
RALPH
It seems to me that the recent
clarification makes it seem that the
student is guilty till proven inno
cent. Do you see this in it?
LEANSE
What I do know is this: I talked
to Bill Allen, member of the Honor
Code Committee, and he told me
students are not guilty until proven j
so; that is my understanding of the j
Honor Code.
RALPH
We don't agree on the matter of
! abolishing the Cabinet. Do you feel
that the close advisers to the presi
dent should be the representatives
I of the student body or not?

LEANSE
I feel that people nearest to the
president should be only in the sense
of advisory capacity. My conception
of the Cabinet is an advisory hody
only.
RALPH
Don't you feel that the "Cabinet
could usurp the legislative power?
Doesn't this make sense that the
Legislature would become a rub
ber-stamping body?
LEANSE
No, I do not. The Cabinet as such
j doesn't have a vote in the Legisla
j ture. There is only the one vote of
! the president.
RALPH
Do I understand that you consider
me to be in favor of abolishing pub
lications, Sunday Evening Flicks,
Ram's Head?
LEANSE
George, I'm not sure what you're
opposing.
RALPH
Do you not feel that the constitu-
J tion should be cut down and the
1 unctions cut down and combined to
[ save considerable money?
LEANSE
I do not want to return a question
to you, but I wish you would give
me some examples of cutting down.
RALPH
I believe in my speech I mentioned
drives, Political Union. Board, and
so on.
LEANSE
To my knowledge if they perform
different functions and if they need
different experts, they should not be
combined. Unless activities so much
1 overlap that this would be necessary.
At this point, Leanse took over
(he questioning.
LEANSE
You said that there would be real
value in deformalizing the office of
the President. Is this a failure on
your part to recognize the import
ance of the President?
RALPH
Well, I don't believe that I or any
one else would admit to a failure.
I feel that the office of the President
should be as informal, as casual as
possible, allowing contact with the
student body.
LEANSE
What is your conception of the
I student body president's role?
RALPH
I feel that the most important role
: of the ASSU president is his rela
j tionship with people off campus. Ad
| ministrative duties could be reduced.
LEANSE
What do you mean by diminishing
these activities?
RALPH
Along with diminishing the super

fluous rubber-stamping activities of
the Legislature, I believe in giving
them autonomy, to make their own
decisions and let them decide matters
they know hest. having the Legisla
ture make decisions which pertain
to the whole campus.
LEANSE
You mention the Legislature and
not the president. You haven't
answered the question.
RALI'Ii
In that the president presides over
the Legislature. 1 assume when the
legislature's duties would be dimin
ished, the president's would Ik* also.
LEANSE
Look, your program has changed.
How do we know what you stand
for?
RALPH
I feel only the approach has
changed. My purpose was to stir up
some thinking about student govern
ment. I think it had some effort
along that line.

Ralph look over the questioning.

RALPH
You spoke oi an edueatinn pro
grain for freshmen. How would you
go about carrying out this educa
tion?
LEANSE
One unit class on student govern
ment. I think we have enough other
creative people to devise some kind
?>! education program using slides,
movies, and so on.
RALPH
I wonder if you have any .specific*
ideas about how to increase student
interest in government?
Li: ANSI-
Several things, Geovge: training
people, making government mean
ingful, increasing desire to partici
pate. . . . Too often students fail to
realize that everyone is the recipient
in student government even if they
don't participate.
RALPH
You mentioned the Honor Code as
part of student government. Do you
feel that the Code is part of student
government or something given to
us by the faculty as a privilege?
LEANSE
My conception of the Honor Code
is that it was granted as a privilege
by the faculty in 1927.
RALPH
In 1927 by the faculty . . . that
answers my question doesn't it?
At this point Ring ended the
question period and called 011
Leanse to present the (irst sum
mary.
LEANSE
My program includes the follow
ing points:
1) Construction of positive student
government.
2) Student government must ho
more meaningful.
3) We need evaluation to do away
with weakness.
Making the Legislature work will
also bring government closer to stu
dents and make it more meaningful.
Then Ralph summarized his po
sition.
RALPH
I have heard some talk concern
ing dignity, responsibility concerning
the offices of Stanford University.
This should be considered.
I would like to feel that the cam
paign is not a joke, but a novel ap
proach to get some students think
ing more seriously about student
government.
I presented certain reforms to you
that I feel would make student gov
ernment a more vital thing. If I am
elected, I would feel my election
would be a mandate of the students
to work on these reforms.

community of 7.000.
They perform functions for which
the administration would otherwise
have to pay. The criteria for evalu
ation of these committees should be
! determined by the Legislature. IBM
; cards or a questionnaire system
could be devised to see what stu
dents desire in the way of activities.
The campaign has undergone a
change of appearance ... a complete
reversal. No longer is it "govern
ment versus no government" but
rather a question of a positive or a
negative approach (to government).
In the May 10 Daily . . . the ASSU
was evaluated as a "head hand
shaker." If this is the concept of
the role, then either the possibili
! ties of achievement are overlooked,
or there is a negative attitude to
ward ASSU government. The . . .
president's role (must) not be de
formalized or reduced. For a more
1 meaningful, mors effective govern
ment, the president's role must be
elevated to face the . . . obvious . . .
challenge of making teh new consti
tution meaningful and effective in
j the eyes of the students.
This can be achieved through ed
j ucation and evaluation by many
willing hands. . . . ASSU govern
ment can be made more meaning
ful to students if approached in a
! constructive, positive way.
After Lcanse's opening speech,
Ring switched (lie program into a
question-and-answer period be
tween the two candidates. Eeanse
asked the opening round of qucs
j tions.
LEANSE
You said in your speech you
would abolish the Cabinet. How
could you achieve co-ordination of
the major activities?
RALPH
I believe co-ordination should
come from the Legislature. The
Cabinet does not have this power,
but would come to assert this pow
er. Committees with autonomy
would be able to work with just as
much efficiency and save the Legis
lature for really essential problems.
I,EANSE
I asked you the other evening
what we should do away with in
student government; you said Rally
j Com should be done away with.
RALPH
Did you quote me as saying Rally
Com should be done away with? 11

I said to do away with Rally Com
I'm very sorry .' . , there may be
some people from Rally Com in the
audiencie. . . .
LEANSE
Are you in favor of abolishing all
committees?
RALPH
My idea is not to abolish commit
tees at the outset. Give them a
chance to produce results. Let them
have a party but they won't need
ASSU funds.
'I' li e seven-and-a-half-minute
period closed. Riiitf gave Ralph
the floor to question Leanse.
RALPH
You are for construction, not de
struction. How do you propose to
construct on a constitution already
constructed?
LEANSE
George, I think I did mention that
in my speech. I don't mean adding
to or building on the constitution
but a strengthening within, a con
structive approach.
RALPH
It seems to me that the students
have expressed a desire that some
reform is necessary. I want to know
what you think about this.
LEANSE
I cannot tell whether reform is
necessary until I can put the pro
gram I have proposed in working
order. IBM cards or no, I cannot
tell. .
RALPH
Am I correct in assuming that
NSA should be put up to the stu
dents to decide?
LEANSE
Yes.
RALPH
Would you agree that the appear
ance clause of the Honor Code is
somewhat unfortunate?
LEANSE
I don't understand what you mean
by the appearance clause.
RALPH
It seems to me that the recent
clarification makes it seem that the
student is guilty till proven inno
cent. Do you see this in it?
LEANSE
What I do know is this: I talked
to Bill Allen, member of the Honor
Code Committee, and he told me
students are not guilty until proven j
so; that is my understanding of the j
Honor Code.
RALPH
We don't agree on the matter of
! abolishing the Cabinet. Do you feel
that the close advisers to the presi
dent should be the representatives
I of the student body or not?

LEANSE
I feel that people nearest to the
president should be only in the sense
of advisory capacity. My conception
of the Cabinet is an advisory hody
only.
RALPH
Don't you feel that the "Cabinet
could usurp the legislative power?
Doesn't this make sense that the
Legislature would become a rub
ber-stamping body?
LEANSE
No, I do not. The Cabinet as such
j doesn't have a vote in the Legisla
j ture. There is only the one vote of
! the president.
RALPH
Do I understand that you consider
me to be in favor of abolishing pub
lications, Sunday Evening Flicks,
Ram's Head?
LEANSE
George, I'm not sure what you're
opposing.
RALPH
Do you not feel that the constitu-
J tion should be cut down and the
1 unctions cut down and combined to
[ save considerable money?
LEANSE
I do not want to return a question
to you, but I wish you would give
me some examples of cutting down.
RALPH
I believe in my speech I mentioned
drives, Political Union. Board, and
so on.
LEANSE
To my knowledge if they perform
different functions and if they need
different experts, they should not be
combined. Unless activities so much
1 overlap that this would be necessary.
At this point, Leanse took over
(he questioning.
LEANSE
You said that there would be real
value in deformalizing the office of
the President. Is this a failure on
your part to recognize the import
ance of the President?
RALPH
Well, I don't believe that I or any
one else would admit to a failure.
I feel that the office of the President
should be as informal, as casual as
possible, allowing contact with the
student body.
LEANSE
What is your conception of the
I student body president's role?
RALPH
I feel that the most important role
: of the ASSU president is his rela
j tionship with people off campus. Ad
| ministrative duties could be reduced.
LEANSE
What do you mean by diminishing
these activities?
RALPH
Along with diminishing the super

fluous rubber-stamping activities of
the Legislature, I believe in giving
them autonomy, to make their own
decisions and let them decide matters
they know hest. having the Legisla
ture make decisions which pertain
to the whole campus.
LEANSE
You mention the Legislature and
not the president. You haven't
answered the question.
RALI'Ii
In that the president presides over
the Legislature. 1 assume when the
legislature's duties would be dimin
ished, the president's would Ik* also.
LEANSE
Look, your program has changed.
How do we know what you stand
for?
RALPH
I feel only the approach has
changed. My purpose was to stir up
some thinking about student govern
ment. I think it had some effort
along that line.

Ralph look over the questioning.

RALPH
You spoke oi an edueatinn pro
grain for freshmen. How would you
go about carrying out this educa
tion?
LEANSE
One unit class on student govern
ment. I think we have enough other
creative people to devise some kind
?>! education program using slides,
movies, and so on.
RALPH
I wonder if you have any .specific*
ideas about how to increase student
interest in government?
Li: ANSI-
Several things, Geovge: training
people, making government mean
ingful, increasing desire to partici
pate. . . . Too often students fail to
realize that everyone is the recipient
in student government even if they
don't participate.
RALPH
You mentioned the Honor Code as
part of student government. Do you
feel that the Code is part of student
government or something given to
us by the faculty as a privilege?
LEANSE
My conception of the Honor Code
is that it was granted as a privilege
by the faculty in 1927.
RALPH
In 1927 by the faculty . . . that
answers my question doesn't it?
At this point Ring ended the
question period and called 011
Leanse to present the (irst sum
mary.
LEANSE
My program includes the follow
ing points:
1) Construction of positive student
government.
2) Student government must ho
more meaningful.
3) We need evaluation to do away
with weakness.
Making the Legislature work will
also bring government closer to stu
dents and make it more meaningful.
Then Ralph summarized his po
sition.
RALPH
I have heard some talk concern
ing dignity, responsibility concerning
the offices of Stanford University.
This should be considered.
I would like to feel that the cam
paign is not a joke, but a novel ap
proach to get some students think
ing more seriously about student
government.
I presented certain reforms to you
that I feel would make student gov
ernment a more vital thing. If I am
elected, I would feel my election
would be a mandate of the students
to work on these reforms.

a 10-niinute opening address, qui/,
each other in four seven-minute
periods, and linish with a sum

GEORGE RALPH

A number of you have heard me
in your living groups. I feel I may
have left some of you unsatisfied.
. . . I do riot intend to overthrow
student government. It would be
impossible.
I do not, have not ever, and I
don't expect to ride a motorcycle.
. . . J hope the campaign will be
fought on issues rather than per
sonalities. The stories circulating
are quite untrue; we are not gutter
snipes. None of my friends have
ever appeared on a charge of Honor
Code violation.
What concrete things do I propose
to do?
The Cabinet shall assist the presi
dent in the co-ordination of ASSU
activities. ... I propose reform in
Legislature and Cabinet; executive
power is concentrated in the hands
of the Cabinet under the present
setup.
Having committee chairmen for
executive offices is inexcusable.
Here is an example of undemocratic
government: rubber - stamping the
president's decision. The Legisla
ture is a body of your representa
tives. The Cabinet is a closet cor
poration of the president and made
up of committee heads.
Class affairs can just as well be
handled completely independent of
it. . . . lIR could take under its
wing Foreign Scholarship Commit
tee. Duties of public relations can
be combined with the Student-Fac
ulty Committee; thus reforms could
be carried with adequate student
government. . . .
Any man should be able to run for
head yell leader. He should work in
close co-operation with Rally Com.
I have nothing personal against
NSA; we joined it through undemo
cratic processes. Students should
have a chance to vote on it, I be
lieve. I proposed this; it was origi
nal with me.
One should- be innocent until
proven guilty. What if you were a
student, would you want your char
acter blighted for the rest of your
life? I object to accusations tanta
mount to guilt in the Honor Code.
Student apathy is a definite failing
which can't be corrected by student
officers. ...
I expect no support in my stand
of the various Com-ocrats. I feel
that reform is necessary; it would
be my mandate from the students
to do all that I can to carry out these
reforms. . . .

NATE LEANSE

In answer to various questions
which people have asked me about
my campaign: By joining NSA, we
can make our voice heard on vari
ous campuses and in national af
fairs. I am strongly in favor of our
affiliation but I feel students should
decide.
During the campaign as a result
of the recent clarification of the
Honor Code, it has been said that
wc have an Honor Code without
honor. There is a basic misunder
standing. It was never stated by the
faculty lhat tests could be taken
from the room. The clarification is
not a change, but a return to what
was originally granted. The Honor
Code is a privilege. It builds re
sponsibility and integrity.
How would construction be car
ried out? First there must be an
education program on student gov
ernment. The faculty explains aca

demic life (to incoming freshmen).
! There also (should be) time ... to
j explain student government.
In some universities, there is a
one-unit, one-quarter course in stu
dent government. It is necessary
(to find out what education pro
gram is best for Stanford) when
student government is accused of
being, in essence, composed of mul
j titudinous, driveling committees.
; There are only 18 committees for a
community of 7.000.
They perform functions for which
the administration would otherwise
have to pay. The criteria for evalu
ation of these committees should be
! determined by the Legislature. IBM
; cards or a questionnaire system

that the close advisers to the presi
dent should be the representatives
I of the student body or not?

LEANSE
I feel that people nearest to the
president should be only in the sense
of advisory capacity. My conception
of the Cabinet is an advisory hody
only.
RALPH
Don't you feel that the "Cabinet
could usurp the legislative power?
Doesn't this make sense that the
Legislature would become a rub
ber-stamping body?
LEANSE
No, I do not. The Cabinet as such
j doesn't have a vote in the Legisla
j ture. There is only the one vote of
! the president.
RALPH
Do I understand that you consider
me to be in favor of abolishing pub
lications, Sunday Evening Flicks,
Ram's Head?
LEANSE
George, I'm not sure what you're
opposing.
RALPH
Do you not feel that the constitu-
J tion should be cut down and the
1 unctions cut down and combined to
[ save considerable money?
LEANSE
I do not want to return a question
to you, but I wish you would give
me some examples of cutting down.
RALPH
I believe in my speech I mentioned
drives, Political Union. Board, and
so on.
LEANSE
To my knowledge if they perform
different functions and if they need
different experts, they should not be
combined. Unless activities so much
1 overlap that this would be necessary.
At this point, Leanse took over
(he questioning.
LEANSE
You said that there would be real
value in deformalizing the office of
the President. Is this a failure on
your part to recognize the import
ance of the President?
RALPH
Well, I don't believe that I or any
one else would admit to a failure.
I feel that the office of the President
should be as informal, as casual as
possible, allowing contact with the
student body.
LEANSE
What is your conception of the
I student body president's role?
RALPH
I feel that the most important role
: of the ASSU president is his rela
j tionship with people off campus. Ad
| ministrative duties could be reduced.
LEANSE
What do you mean by diminishing
these activities?
RALPH
Along with diminishing the super

fluous rubber-stamping activities of
the Legislature, I believe in giving
them autonomy, to make their own
decisions and let them decide matters
they know hest. having the Legisla
ture make decisions which pertain
to the whole campus.
LEANSE
You mention the Legislature and
not the president. You haven't
answered the question.
RALI'Ii
In that the president presides over
the Legislature. 1 assume when the
legislature's duties would be dimin
ished, the president's would Ik* also.
LEANSE
Look, your program has changed.
How do we know what you stand
for?
RALPH
I feel only the approach has
changed. My purpose was to stir up
some thinking about student govern
ment. I think it had some effort
along that line.

Ralph look over the questioning.

RALPH
You spoke oi an edueatinn pro
grain for freshmen. How would you
go about carrying out this educa
tion?
LEANSE
One unit class on student govern
ment. I think we have enough other
creative people to devise some kind
?>! education program using slides,
movies, and so on.
RALPH
I wonder if you have any .specific*
ideas about how to increase student
interest in government?
Li: ANSI-
Several things, Geovge: training
people, making government mean
ingful, increasing desire to partici
pate. . . . Too often students fail to
realize that everyone is the recipient
in student government even if they
don't participate.
RALPH
You mentioned the Honor Code as
part of student government. Do you
feel that the Code is part of student
government or something given to
us by the faculty as a privilege?
LEANSE
My conception of the Honor Code
is that it was granted as a privilege
by the faculty in 1927.
RALPH
In 1927 by the faculty . . . that
answers my question doesn't it?
At this point Ring ended the
question period and called 011
Leanse to present the (irst sum
mary.
LEANSE
My program includes the follow
ing points:
1) Construction of positive student
government.
2) Student government must ho
more meaningful.
3) We need evaluation to do away
with weakness.
Making the Legislature work will
also bring government closer to stu
dents and make it more meaningful.
Then Ralph summarized his po
sition.
RALPH
I have heard some talk concern
ing dignity, responsibility concerning
the offices of Stanford University.
This should be considered.
I would like to feel that the cam
paign is not a joke, but a novel ap
proach to get some students think
ing more seriously about student
government.
I presented certain reforms to you
that I feel would make student gov
ernment a more vital thing. If I am
elected, I would feel my election
would be a mandate of the students
to work on these reforms.

a 10-niinute opening address, qui/,
each other in four seven-minute

GEORGE RALPH

A number of you have heard me
in your living groups. I feel I may
have left some of you unsatisfied.
. . . I do riot intend to overthrow
student government. It would be
impossible.
I do not, have not ever, and I
don't expect to ride a motorcycle.
. . . J hope the campaign will be
fought on issues rather than per
sonalities. The stories circulating
are quite untrue; we are not gutter
snipes. None of my friends have
ever appeared on a charge of Honor
Code violation.
What concrete things do I propose
to do?
The Cabinet shall assist the presi
dent in the co-ordination of ASSU
activities. ... I propose reform in
Legislature and Cabinet; executive
power is concentrated in the hands
of the Cabinet under the present
setup.
Having committee chairmen for
executive offices is inexcusable.
Here is an example of undemocratic
government: rubber - stamping the
president's decision. The Legisla
ture is a body of your representa
tives. The Cabinet is a closet cor
poration of the president and made
up of committee heads.
Class affairs can just as well be
handled completely independent of
it. . . . lIR could take under its
wing Foreign Scholarship Commit
tee. Duties of public relations can
be combined with the Student-Fac
ulty Committee; thus reforms could
be carried with adequate student
government. . . .
Any man should be able to run for
head yell leader. He should work in
close co-operation with Rally Com.
I have nothing personal against
NSA; we joined it through undemo
cratic processes. Students should
have a chance to vote on it, I be
lieve. I proposed this; it was origi
nal with me.
One should- be innocent until
proven guilty. What if you were a
student, would you want your char
acter blighted for the rest of your
life? I object to accusations tanta
mount to guilt in the Honor Code.
Student apathy is a definite failing
which can't be corrected by student
officers. ...
I expect no support in my stand
of the various Com-ocrats. I feel
that reform is necessary; it would
be my mandate from the students
to do all that I can to carry out these
reforms. . . .

NATE LEANSE

In answer to various questions
which people have asked me about
my campaign: By joining NSA, we
can make our voice heard on vari
ous campuses and in national af
fairs. I am strongly in favor of our
affiliation but I feel students should
decide.
During the campaign as a result
of the recent clarification of the
Honor Code, it has been said that
wc have an Honor Code without
honor. There is a basic misunder
standing. It was never stated by the
faculty lhat tests could be taken
from the room. The clarification is
not a change, but a return to what
was originally granted. The Honor
Code is a privilege. It builds re
sponsibility and integrity.
How would construction be car
ried out? First there must be an
education program on student gov
ernment. The faculty explains aca

demic life (to incoming freshmen).
! There also (should be) time ... to
j explain student government.
In some universities, there is a
one-unit, one-quarter course in stu
dent government. It is necessary
(to find out what education pro
gram is best for Stanford) when
student government is accused of
being, in essence, composed of mul
j titudinous, driveling committees.
; There are only 18 committees for a
community of 7.000.
They perform functions for which
the administration would otherwise
have to pay. The criteria for evalu
ation of these committees should be
! determined by the Legislature. IBM
; cards or a questionnaire system
could be devised to see what stu
dents desire in the way of activities.
The campaign has undergone a
change of appearance ... a complete
reversal. No longer is it "govern
ment versus no government" but
rather a question of a positive or a
negative approach (to government).
In the May 10 Daily . . . the ASSU
was evaluated as a "head hand
shaker." If this is the concept of
the role, then either the possibili
! ties of achievement are overlooked,
or there is a negative attitude to
ward ASSU government. The . . .
president's role (must) not be de
formalized or reduced. For a more
1 meaningful, mors effective govern
ment, the president's role must be
elevated to face the . . . obvious . . .
challenge of making teh new consti
tution meaningful and effective in
j the eyes of the students.
This can be achieved through ed
j ucation and evaluation by many
willing hands. . . . ASSU govern
ment can be made more meaning
ful to students if approached in a
! constructive, positive way.
After Lcanse's opening speech,
Ring switched (lie program into a
question-and-answer period be
tween the two candidates. Eeanse
asked the opening round of qucs
j tions.
LEANSE
You said in your speech you
would abolish the Cabinet. How
could you achieve co-ordination of
the major activities?
RALPH
I believe co-ordination should
come from the Legislature. The
Cabinet does not have this power,
but would come to assert this pow
er. Committees with autonomy
would be able to work with just as
much efficiency and save the Legis
lature for really essential problems.
I,EANSE
I asked you the other evening
what we should do away with in
student government; you said Rally
j Com should be done away with.
RALPH
Did you quote me as saying Rally
Com should be done away with? 11

I said to do away with Rally Com
I'm very sorry .' . , there may be
some people from Rally Com in the
audiencie. . . .
LEANSE
Are you in favor of abolishing all
committees?
RALPH
My idea is not to abolish commit
tees at the outset. Give them a
chance to produce results. Let them
have a party but they won't need
ASSU funds.
'I' li e seven-and-a-half-minute
period closed. Riiitf gave Ralph
the floor to question Leanse.
RALPH
You are for construction, not de
struction. How do you propose to
construct on a constitution already
constructed?
LEANSE
George, I think I did mention that
in my speech. I don't mean adding
to or building on the constitution
but a strengthening within, a con
structive approach.
RALPH
It seems to me that the students
have expressed a desire that some
reform is necessary. I want to know
what you think about this.
LEANSE
I cannot tell whether reform is
necessary until I can put the pro
gram I have proposed in working
order. IBM cards or no, I cannot
tell. .
RALPH
Am I correct in assuming that
NSA should be put up to the stu
dents to decide?
LEANSE
Yes.
RALPH
Would you agree that the appear
ance clause of the Honor Code is
somewhat unfortunate?
LEANSE
I don't understand what you mean
by the appearance clause.
RALPH
It seems to me that the recent
clarification makes it seem that the
student is guilty till proven inno
cent. Do you see this in it?
LEANSE
What I do know is this: I talked
to Bill Allen, member of the Honor
Code Committee, and he told me
students are not guilty until proven j
so; that is my understanding of the j
Honor Code.
RALPH
We don't agree on the matter of
! abolishing the Cabinet. Do you feel
that the close advisers to the presi
dent should be the representatives
I of the student body or not?

LEANSE

In 1927 by the faculty . . . that
answers my question doesn't it?
At this point Ring ended the
question period and called 011
Leanse to present the (irst sum

LEANSE
My program includes the follow
ing points:
1) Construction of positive student
government.
2) Student government must ho
more meaningful.
3) We need evaluation to do away
with weakness.
Making the Legislature work will
also bring government closer to stu
dents and make it more meaningful.
Then Ralph summarized his po
sition.
RALPH
I have heard some talk concern
ing dignity, responsibility concerning
the offices of Stanford University.
This should be considered.
I would like to feel that the cam
paign is not a joke, but a novel ap
proach to get some students think

government.
I presented certain reforms to you
that I feel would make student gov

would be a mandate of the students
to work on these reforms.

GEORGE RALPH

A number of you have heard me
in your living groups. I feel I may
have left some of you unsatisfied.
. . . I do riot intend to overthrow
student government. It would be
impossible.
I do not, have not ever, and I
don't expect to ride a motorcycle.
. . . J hope the campaign will be
fought on issues rather than per
sonalities. The stories circulating
are quite untrue; we are not gutter
snipes. None of my friends have
ever appeared on a charge of Honor
Code violation.
What concrete things do I propose
to do?
The Cabinet shall assist the presi
dent in the co-ordination of ASSU
activities. ... I propose reform in
Legislature and Cabinet; executive
power is concentrated in the hands
of the Cabinet under the present
setup.
Having committee chairmen for
executive offices is inexcusable.
Here is an example of undemocratic
government: rubber - stamping the
president's decision. The Legisla
ture is a body of your representa
tives. The Cabinet is a closet cor
poration of the president and made
up of committee heads.
Class affairs can just as well be
handled completely independent of
it. . . . lIR could take under its
wing Foreign Scholarship Commit
tee. Duties of public relations can
be combined with the Student-Fac
ulty Committee; thus reforms could
be carried with adequate student
government. . . .
Any man should be able to run for
head yell leader. He should work in
close co-operation with Rally Com.
I have nothing personal against
NSA; we joined it through undemo
cratic processes. Students should
have a chance to vote on it, I be
lieve. I proposed this; it was origi
nal with me.
One should- be innocent until
proven guilty. What if you were a
student, would you want your char
acter blighted for the rest of your
life? I object to accusations tanta
mount to guilt in the Honor Code.
Student apathy is a definite failing
which can't be corrected by student
officers. ...
I expect no support in my stand
of the various Com-ocrats. I feel
that reform is necessary; it would
be my mandate from the students
to do all that I can to carry out these
reforms. . . .

NATE LEANSE

In answer to various questions
which people have asked me about
my campaign: By joining NSA, we
can make our voice heard on vari
ous campuses and in national af
fairs. I am strongly in favor of our
affiliation but I feel students should
decide.
During the campaign as a result
of the recent clarification of the
Honor Code, it has been said that
wc have an Honor Code without
honor. There is a basic misunder
standing. It was never stated by the
faculty lhat tests could be taken
from the room. The clarification is
not a change, but a return to what
was originally granted. The Honor
Code is a privilege. It builds re
sponsibility and integrity.
How would construction be car
ried out? First there must be an
education program on student gov
ernment. The faculty explains aca

demic life (to incoming freshmen).
! There also (should be) time ... to
j explain student government.
In some universities, there is a
one-unit, one-quarter course in stu
dent government. It is necessary
(to find out what education pro
gram is best for Stanford) when
student government is accused of
being, in essence, composed of mul
j titudinous, driveling committees.
; There are only 18 committees for a
community of 7.000.
They perform functions for which
the administration would otherwise
have to pay. The criteria for evalu
ation of these committees should be
! determined by the Legislature. IBM
; cards or a questionnaire system
could be devised to see what stu
dents desire in the way of activities.
The campaign has undergone a
change of appearance ... a complete
reversal. No longer is it "govern
ment versus no government" but
rather a question of a positive or a
negative approach (to government).
In the May 10 Daily . . . the ASSU
was evaluated as a "head hand
shaker." If this is the concept of
the role, then either the possibili
! ties of achievement are overlooked,
or there is a negative attitude to
ward ASSU government. The . . .
president's role (must) not be de
formalized or reduced. For a more
1 meaningful, mors effective govern
ment, the president's role must be
elevated to face the . . . obvious . . .
challenge of making teh new consti
tution meaningful and effective in
j the eyes of the students.
This can be achieved through ed
j ucation and evaluation by many
willing hands. . . . ASSU govern
ment can be made more meaning
ful to students if approached in a
! constructive, positive way.
After Lcanse's opening speech,
Ring switched (lie program into a
question-and-answer period be
tween the two candidates. Eeanse
asked the opening round of qucs
j tions.
LEANSE
You said in your speech you
would abolish the Cabinet. How
could you achieve co-ordination of
the major activities?
RALPH
I believe co-ordination should
come from the Legislature. The
Cabinet does not have this power,
but would come to assert this pow
er. Committees with autonomy
would be able to work with just as
much efficiency and save the Legis
lature for really essential problems.
I,EANSE
I asked you the other evening
what we should do away with in
student government; you said Rally
j Com should be done away with.
RALPH
Did you quote me as saying Rally
Com should be done away with? 11

I said to do away with Rally Com
I'm very sorry .' . , there may be
some people from Rally Com in the
audiencie. . . .
LEANSE
Are you in favor of abolishing all
committees?
RALPH
My idea is not to abolish commit
tees at the outset. Give them a
chance to produce results. Let them
have a party but they won't need
ASSU funds.
'I' li e seven-and-a-half-minute
period closed. Riiitf gave Ralph
the floor to question Leanse.
RALPH
You are for construction, not de
struction. How do you propose to
construct on a constitution already
constructed?
LEANSE
George, I think I did mention that
in my speech. I don't mean adding
to or building on the constitution
but a strengthening within, a con
structive approach.
RALPH
It seems to me that the students
have expressed a desire that some
reform is necessary. I want to know
what you think about this.
LEANSE
I cannot tell whether reform is
necessary until I can put the pro
gram I have proposed in working
order. IBM cards or no, I cannot
tell. .
RALPH
Am I correct in assuming that
NSA should be put up to the stu
dents to decide?
LEANSE
Yes.
RALPH
Would you agree that the appear
ance clause of the Honor Code is
somewhat unfortunate?
LEANSE
I don't understand what you mean
by the appearance clause.
RALPH
It seems to me that the recent
clarification makes it seem that the
student is guilty till proven inno
cent. Do you see this in it?
LEANSE
What I do know is this: I talked
to Bill Allen, member of the Honor
Code Committee, and he told me
students are not guilty until proven j
so; that is my understanding of the j
Honor Code.
RALPH
We don't agree on the matter of
! abolishing the Cabinet. Do you feel
that the close advisers to the presi
dent should be the representatives
I of the student body or not?

LEANSE
I feel that people nearest to the
president should be only in the sense
of advisory capacity. My conception
of the Cabinet is an advisory hody
only.
RALPH
Don't you feel that the "Cabinet
could usurp the legislative power?
Doesn't this make sense that the
Legislature would become a rub
ber-stamping body?
LEANSE
No, I do not. The Cabinet as such
j doesn't have a vote in the Legisla
j ture. There is only the one vote of
! the president.
RALPH
Do I understand that you consider
me to be in favor of abolishing pub
lications, Sunday Evening Flicks,
Ram's Head?
LEANSE
George, I'm not sure what you're
opposing.
RALPH
Do you not feel that the constitu-
J tion should be cut down and the
1 unctions cut down and combined to
[ save considerable money?
LEANSE
I do not want to return a question
to you, but I wish you would give
me some examples of cutting down.
RALPH
I believe in my speech I mentioned
drives, Political Union. Board, and
so on.
LEANSE
To my knowledge if they perform
different functions and if they need
different experts, they should not be
combined. Unless activities so much
1 overlap that this would be necessary.
At this point, Leanse took over
(he questioning.
LEANSE
You said that there would be real
value in deformalizing the office of
the President. Is this a failure on
your part to recognize the import
ance of the President?
RALPH
Well, I don't believe that I or any
one else would admit to a failure.
I feel that the office of the President
should be as informal, as casual as
possible, allowing contact with the
student body.
LEANSE
What is your conception of the
I student body president's role?
RALPH
I feel that the most important role
: of the ASSU president is his rela
j tionship with people off campus. Ad
| ministrative duties could be reduced.
LEANSE
What do you mean by diminishing
these activities?
RALPH
Along with diminishing the super

fluous rubber-stamping activities of
the Legislature, I believe in giving
them autonomy, to make their own
decisions and let them decide matters
they know hest. having the Legisla
ture make decisions which pertain
to the whole campus.
LEANSE
You mention the Legislature and
not the president. You haven't
answered the question.
RALI'Ii
In that the president presides over
the Legislature. 1 assume when the
legislature's duties would be dimin
ished, the president's would Ik* also.
LEANSE
Look, your program has changed.
How do we know what you stand
for?
RALPH
I feel only the approach has
changed. My purpose was to stir up
some thinking about student govern
ment. I think it had some effort
along that line.

Ralph look over the questioning.

RALPH
You spoke oi an edueatinn pro
grain for freshmen. How would you
go about carrying out this educa
tion?
LEANSE
One unit class on student govern
ment. I think we have enough other
creative people to devise some kind
?>! education program using slides,
movies, and so on.
RALPH
I wonder if you have any .specific*
ideas about how to increase student
interest in government?
Li: ANSI-
Several things, Geovge: training
people, making government mean
ingful, increasing desire to partici
pate. . . . Too often students fail to
realize that everyone is the recipient
in student government even if they
don't participate.
RALPH
You mentioned the Honor Code as
part of student government. Do you
feel that the Code is part of student
government or something given to
us by the faculty as a privilege?
LEANSE
My conception of the Honor Code
is that it was granted as a privilege
by the faculty in 1927.
RALPH
In 1927 by the faculty . . . that
answers my question doesn't it?
At this point Ring ended the
question period and called 011

my campaign: By joining NSA, we
can make our voice heard on vari
ous campuses and in national af
fairs. I am strongly in favor of our
affiliation but I feel students should
decide.
During the campaign as a result
of the recent clarification of the
Honor Code, it has been said that
wc have an Honor Code without
honor. There is a basic misunder
standing. It was never stated by the
faculty lhat tests could be taken
from the room. The clarification is
not a change, but a return to what
was originally granted. The Honor
Code is a privilege. It builds re
sponsibility and integrity.
How would construction be car
ried out? First there must be an
education program on student gov
ernment. The faculty explains aca

demic life (to incoming freshmen).
! There also (should be) time ... to
j explain student government.
In some universities, there is a
one-unit, one-quarter course in stu
dent government. It is necessary
(to find out what education pro
gram is best for Stanford) when
student government is accused of
being, in essence, composed of mul
j titudinous, driveling committees.
; There are only 18 committees for a
community of 7.000.
They perform functions for which
the administration would otherwise
have to pay. The criteria for evalu
ation of these committees should be
! determined by the Legislature. IBM
; cards or a questionnaire system
could be devised to see what stu
dents desire in the way of activities.
The campaign has undergone a
change of appearance ... a complete
reversal. No longer is it "govern
ment versus no government" but
rather a question of a positive or a
negative approach (to government).
In the May 10 Daily . . . the ASSU
was evaluated as a "head hand
shaker." If this is the concept of
the role, then either the possibili
! ties of achievement are overlooked,
or there is a negative attitude to
ward ASSU government. The . . .
president's role (must) not be de
formalized or reduced. For a more
1 meaningful, mors effective govern
ment, the president's role must be
elevated to face the . . . obvious . . .
challenge of making teh new consti
tution meaningful and effective in
j the eyes of the students.
This can be achieved through ed
j ucation and evaluation by many
willing hands. . . . ASSU govern
ment can be made more meaning
ful to students if approached in a
! constructive, positive way.
After Lcanse's opening speech,
Ring switched (lie program into a
question-and-answer period be
tween the two candidates. Eeanse
asked the opening round of qucs
j tions.
LEANSE
You said in your speech you
would abolish the Cabinet. How
could you achieve co-ordination of
the major activities?
RALPH
I believe co-ordination should
come from the Legislature. The
Cabinet does not have this power,
but would come to assert this pow
er. Committees with autonomy
would be able to work with just as
much efficiency and save the Legis
lature for really essential problems.
I,EANSE
I asked you the other evening
what we should do away with in
student government; you said Rally
j Com should be done away with.
RALPH
Did you quote me as saying Rally
Com should be done away with? 11

I said to do away with Rally Com
I'm very sorry .' . , there may be
some people from Rally Com in the
audiencie. . . .
LEANSE
Are you in favor of abolishing all
committees?
RALPH
My idea is not to abolish commit
tees at the outset. Give them a
chance to produce results. Let them
have a party but they won't need
ASSU funds.
'I' li e seven-and-a-half-minute
period closed. Riiitf gave Ralph
the floor to question Leanse.
RALPH
You are for construction, not de
struction. How do you propose to
construct on a constitution already
constructed?
LEANSE
George, I think I did mention that
in my speech. I don't mean adding
to or building on the constitution
but a strengthening within, a con
structive approach.
RALPH
It seems to me that the students
have expressed a desire that some
reform is necessary. I want to know
what you think about this.
LEANSE
I cannot tell whether reform is
necessary until I can put the pro
gram I have proposed in working
order. IBM cards or no, I cannot
tell. .
RALPH
Am I correct in assuming that
NSA should be put up to the stu
dents to decide?
LEANSE
Yes.
RALPH
Would you agree that the appear
ance clause of the Honor Code is
somewhat unfortunate?
LEANSE
I don't understand what you mean
by the appearance clause.
RALPH
It seems to me that the recent
clarification makes it seem that the
student is guilty till proven inno
cent. Do you see this in it?
LEANSE
What I do know is this: I talked
to Bill Allen, member of the Honor
Code Committee, and he told me
students are not guilty until proven j
so; that is my understanding of the j
Honor Code.
RALPH
We don't agree on the matter of
! abolishing the Cabinet. Do you feel
that the close advisers to the presi
dent should be the representatives
I of the student body or not?

LEANSE
I feel that people nearest to the
president should be only in the sense
of advisory capacity. My conception
of the Cabinet is an advisory hody
only.
RALPH
Don't you feel that the "Cabinet
could usurp the legislative power?
Doesn't this make sense that the
Legislature would become a rub
ber-stamping body?
LEANSE
No, I do not. The Cabinet as such
j doesn't have a vote in the Legisla
j ture. There is only the one vote of
! the president.
RALPH
Do I understand that you consider
me to be in favor of abolishing pub
lications, Sunday Evening Flicks,
Ram's Head?
LEANSE
George, I'm not sure what you're
opposing.
RALPH
Do you not feel that the constitu-
J tion should be cut down and the
1 unctions cut down and combined to
[ save considerable money?
LEANSE
I do not want to return a question
to you, but I wish you would give
me some examples of cutting down.
RALPH
I believe in my speech I mentioned
drives, Political Union. Board, and
so on.
LEANSE
To my knowledge if they perform
different functions and if they need
different experts, they should not be
combined. Unless activities so much
1 overlap that this would be necessary.
At this point, Leanse took over
(he questioning.
LEANSE
You said that there would be real
value in deformalizing the office of
the President. Is this a failure on
your part to recognize the import
ance of the President?
RALPH
Well, I don't believe that I or any
one else would admit to a failure.
I feel that the office of the President
should be as informal, as casual as
possible, allowing contact with the
student body.
LEANSE
What is your conception of the
I student body president's role?
RALPH
I feel that the most important role
: of the ASSU president is his rela
j tionship with people off campus. Ad
| ministrative duties could be reduced.
LEANSE
What do you mean by diminishing
these activities?
RALPH
Along with diminishing the super

fluous rubber-stamping activities of
the Legislature, I believe in giving
them autonomy, to make their own
decisions and let them decide matters
they know hest. having the Legisla
ture make decisions which pertain
to the whole campus.
LEANSE
You mention the Legislature and
not the president. You haven't
answered the question.
RALI'Ii
In that the president presides over
the Legislature. 1 assume when the
legislature's duties would be dimin
ished, the president's would Ik* also.
LEANSE
Look, your program has changed.
How do we know what you stand
for?
RALPH
I feel only the approach has
changed. My purpose was to stir up
some thinking about student govern
ment. I think it had some effort
along that line.

Ralph look over the questioning.

RALPH
You spoke oi an edueatinn pro
grain for freshmen. How would you
go about carrying out this educa
tion?
LEANSE
One unit class on student govern
ment. I think we have enough other
creative people to devise some kind
?>! education program using slides,
movies, and so on.
RALPH
I wonder if you have any .specific*
ideas about how to increase student
interest in government?
Li: ANSI-
Several things, Geovge: training
people, making government mean
ingful, increasing desire to partici
pate. . . . Too often students fail to
realize that everyone is the recipient
in student government even if they
don't participate.
RALPH
You mentioned the Honor Code as
part of student government. Do you
feel that the Code is part of student
government or something given to
us by the faculty as a privilege?
LEANSE
My conception of the Honor Code
is that it was granted as a privilege
by the faculty in 1927.
RALPH
In 1927 by the faculty . . . that
answers my question doesn't it?
At this point Ring ended the
question period and called 011
Leanse to present the (irst sum
mary.
LEANSE
My program includes the follow
ing points:
1) Construction of positive student
government.
2) Student government must ho
more meaningful.
3) We need evaluation to do away
with weakness.
Making the Legislature work will
also bring government closer to stu
dents and make it more meaningful.
Then Ralph summarized his po
sition.
RALPH
I have heard some talk concern
ing dignity, responsibility concerning
the offices of Stanford University.
This should be considered.
I would like to feel that the cam
paign is not a joke, but a novel ap
proach to get some students think
ing more seriously about student
government.
I presented certain reforms to you
that I feel would make student gov
ernment a more vital thing. If I am
elected, I would feel my election
would be a mandate of the students
to work on these reforms.

dent Peter Bing moderated. For

a 10-niinute opening address, qui/,
each other in four seven-minute
periods, and linish with a sum

Kajph was the firsf speaker.

GEORGE RALPH

A number of you have heard me
in your living groups. I feel I may
have left some of you unsatisfied.
. . . I do riot intend to overthrow
student government. It would be
impossible.
I do not, have not ever, and I
don't expect to ride a motorcycle.
. . . J hope the campaign will be
fought on issues rather than per
sonalities. The stories circulating
are quite untrue; we are not gutter
snipes. None of my friends have
ever appeared on a charge of Honor
Code violation.
What concrete things do I propose
to do?
The Cabinet shall assist the presi
dent in the co-ordination of ASSU
activities. ... I propose reform in
Legislature and Cabinet; executive
power is concentrated in the hands
of the Cabinet under the present
setup.
Having committee chairmen for
executive offices is inexcusable.
Here is an example of undemocratic
government: rubber - stamping the
president's decision. The Legisla
ture is a body of your representa
tives. The Cabinet is a closet cor
poration of the president and made
up of committee heads.
Class affairs can just as well be
handled completely independent of
it. . . . lIR could take under its
wing Foreign Scholarship Commit
tee. Duties of public relations can
be combined with the Student-Fac
ulty Committee; thus reforms could
be carried with adequate student
government. . . .
Any man should be able to run for
head yell leader. He should work in
close co-operation with Rally Com.
I have nothing personal against
NSA; we joined it through undemo
cratic processes. Students should
have a chance to vote on it, I be
lieve. I proposed this; it was origi
nal with me.
One should- be innocent until
proven guilty. What if you were a
student, would you want your char
acter blighted for the rest of your
life? I object to accusations tanta
mount to guilt in the Honor Code.
Student apathy is a definite failing
which can't be corrected by student
officers. ...
I expect no support in my stand
of the various Com-ocrats. I feel
that reform is necessary; it would
be my mandate from the students
to do all that I can to carry out these
reforms. . . .

structive approach.
RALPH
It seems to me that the students
have expressed a desire that some
reform is necessary. I want to know
what you think about this.
LEANSE
I cannot tell whether reform is
necessary until I can put the pro
gram I have proposed in working
order. IBM cards or no, I cannot
tell. .
RALPH
Am I correct in assuming that
NSA should be put up to the stu
dents to decide?
LEANSE
Yes.
RALPH
Would you agree that the appear
ance clause of the Honor Code is
somewhat unfortunate?
LEANSE
I don't understand what you mean
by the appearance clause.
RALPH
It seems to me that the recent
clarification makes it seem that the
student is guilty till proven inno
cent. Do you see this in it?
LEANSE
What I do know is this: I talked
to Bill Allen, member of the Honor
Code Committee, and he told me
students are not guilty until proven j
so; that is my understanding of the j
Honor Code.
RALPH
We don't agree on the matter of
! abolishing the Cabinet. Do you feel
that the close advisers to the presi
dent should be the representatives
I of the student body or not?

LEANSE
I feel that people nearest to the
president should be only in the sense
of advisory capacity. My conception
of the Cabinet is an advisory hody
only.
RALPH
Don't you feel that the "Cabinet
could usurp the legislative power?
Doesn't this make sense that the
Legislature would become a rub
ber-stamping body?
LEANSE
No, I do not. The Cabinet as such
j doesn't have a vote in the Legisla
j ture. There is only the one vote of
! the president.
RALPH
Do I understand that you consider
me to be in favor of abolishing pub
lications, Sunday Evening Flicks,
Ram's Head?
LEANSE
George, I'm not sure what you're
opposing.
RALPH
Do you not feel that the constitu-
J tion should be cut down and the
1 unctions cut down and combined to
[ save considerable money?
LEANSE
I do not want to return a question
to you, but I wish you would give
me some examples of cutting down.
RALPH
I believe in my speech I mentioned
drives, Political Union. Board, and
so on.
LEANSE
To my knowledge if they perform
different functions and if they need
different experts, they should not be
combined. Unless activities so much
1 overlap that this would be necessary.
At this point, Leanse took over
(he questioning.
LEANSE
You said that there would be real
value in deformalizing the office of
the President. Is this a failure on
your part to recognize the import
ance of the President?
RALPH
Well, I don't believe that I or any
one else would admit to a failure.
I feel that the office of the President
should be as informal, as casual as
possible, allowing contact with the
student body.
LEANSE
What is your conception of the
I student body president's role?
RALPH
I feel that the most important role
: of the ASSU president is his rela
j tionship with people off campus. Ad
| ministrative duties could be reduced.
LEANSE
What do you mean by diminishing
these activities?
RALPH
Along with diminishing the super

fluous rubber-stamping activities of
the Legislature, I believe in giving
them autonomy, to make their own
decisions and let them decide matters
they know hest. having the Legisla
ture make decisions which pertain
to the whole campus.
LEANSE
You mention the Legislature and
not the president. You haven't
answered the question.
RALI'Ii
In that the president presides over
the Legislature. 1 assume when the
legislature's duties would be dimin
ished, the president's would Ik* also.
LEANSE
Look, your program has changed.
How do we know what you stand
for?
RALPH
I feel only the approach has
changed. My purpose was to stir up
some thinking about student govern
ment. I think it had some effort
along that line.

Ralph look over the questioning.

RALPH
You spoke oi an edueatinn pro
grain for freshmen. How would you
go about carrying out this educa
tion?
LEANSE
One unit class on student govern
ment. I think we have enough other
creative people to devise some kind
?>! education program using slides,
movies, and so on.
RALPH
I wonder if you have any .specific*
ideas about how to increase student
interest in government?
Li: ANSI-
Several things, Geovge: training
people, making government mean
ingful, increasing desire to partici
pate. . . . Too often students fail to
realize that everyone is the recipient
in student government even if they
don't participate.
RALPH
You mentioned the Honor Code as
part of student government. Do you
feel that the Code is part of student
government or something given to
us by the faculty as a privilege?
LEANSE
My conception of the Honor Code
is that it was granted as a privilege
by the faculty in 1927.
RALPH
In 1927 by the faculty . . . that
answers my question doesn't it?
At this point Ring ended the
question period and called 011
Leanse to present the (irst sum
mary.
LEANSE
My program includes the follow
ing points:
1) Construction of positive student
government.
2) Student government must ho
more meaningful.
3) We need evaluation to do away
with weakness.
Making the Legislature work will
also bring government closer to stu
dents and make it more meaningful.
Then Ralph summarized his po
sition.
RALPH
I have heard some talk concern
ing dignity, responsibility concerning
the offices of Stanford University.
This should be considered.
I would like to feel that the cam
paign is not a joke, but a novel ap
proach to get some students think
ing more seriously about student
government.
I presented certain reforms to you
that I feel would make student gov
ernment a more vital thing. If I am
elected, I would feel my election
would be a mandate of the students
to work on these reforms.

GEORGE RALPH

A number of you have heard me
in your living groups. I feel I may
have left some of you unsatisfied.
. . . I do riot intend to overthrow
student government. It would be
impossible.
I do not, have not ever, and I
don't expect to ride a motorcycle.
. . . J hope the campaign will be
fought on issues rather than per
sonalities. The stories circulating
are quite untrue; we are not gutter
snipes. None of my friends have
ever appeared on a charge of Honor
Code violation.
What concrete things do I propose
to do?
The Cabinet shall assist the presi
dent in the co-ordination of ASSU
activities. ... I propose reform in
Legislature and Cabinet; executive
power is concentrated in the hands
of the Cabinet under the present
setup.
Having committee chairmen for
executive offices is inexcusable.
Here is an example of undemocratic
government: rubber - stamping the
president's decision. The Legisla
ture is a body of your representa
tives. The Cabinet is a closet cor
poration of the president and made
up of committee heads.
Class affairs can just as well be
handled completely independent of
it. . . . lIR could take under its
wing Foreign Scholarship Commit
tee. Duties of public relations can
be combined with the Student-Fac
ulty Committee; thus reforms could
be carried with adequate student
government. . . .
Any man should be able to run for
head yell leader. He should work in
close co-operation with Rally Com.
I have nothing personal against
NSA; we joined it through undemo
cratic processes. Students should
have a chance to vote on it, I be
lieve. I proposed this; it was origi
nal with me.
One should- be innocent until
proven guilty. What if you were a
student, would you want your char
acter blighted for the rest of your
life? I object to accusations tanta
mount to guilt in the Honor Code.
Student apathy is a definite failing
which can't be corrected by student
officers. ...
I expect no support in my stand
of the various Com-ocrats. I feel
that reform is necessary; it would
be my mandate from the students
to do all that I can to carry out these
reforms. . . .

NATE LEANSE

In answer to various questions
which people have asked me about
my campaign: By joining NSA, we
can make our voice heard on vari
ous campuses and in national af
fairs. I am strongly in favor of our
affiliation but I feel students should
decide.
During the campaign as a result
of the recent clarification of the
Honor Code, it has been said that
wc have an Honor Code without
honor. There is a basic misunder
standing. It was never stated by the
faculty lhat tests could be taken
from the room. The clarification is
not a change, but a return to what
was originally granted. The Honor
Code is a privilege. It builds re
sponsibility and integrity.
How would construction be car
ried out? First there must be an
education program on student gov
ernment. The faculty explains aca

demic life (to incoming freshmen).
! There also (should be) time ... to
j explain student government.
In some universities, there is a
one-unit, one-quarter course in stu
dent government. It is necessary
(to find out what education pro
gram is best for Stanford) when
student government is accused of
being, in essence, composed of mul
j titudinous, driveling committees.
; There are only 18 committees for a
community of 7.000.
They perform functions for which
the administration would otherwise
have to pay. The criteria for evalu
ation of these committees should be
! determined by the Legislature. IBM
; cards or a questionnaire system
could be devised to see what stu
dents desire in the way of activities.
The campaign has undergone a
change of appearance ... a complete
reversal. No longer is it "govern
ment versus no government" but
rather a question of a positive or a
negative approach (to government).
In the May 10 Daily . . . the ASSU
was evaluated as a "head hand
shaker." If this is the concept of
the role, then either the possibili
! ties of achievement are overlooked,
or there is a negative attitude to
ward ASSU government. The . . .
president's role (must) not be de
formalized or reduced. For a more
1 meaningful, mors effective govern
ment, the president's role must be
elevated to face the . . . obvious . . .
challenge of making teh new consti
tution meaningful and effective in
j the eyes of the students.
This can be achieved through ed
j ucation and evaluation by many
willing hands. . . . ASSU govern
ment can be made more meaning
ful to students if approached in a
! constructive, positive way.
After Lcanse's opening speech,
Ring switched (lie program into a
question-and-answer period be
tween the two candidates. Eeanse
asked the opening round of qucs
j tions.
LEANSE
You said in your speech you
would abolish the Cabinet. How
could you achieve co-ordination of
the major activities?
RALPH
I believe co-ordination should
come from the Legislature. The
Cabinet does not have this power,
but would come to assert this pow
er. Committees with autonomy
would be able to work with just as
much efficiency and save the Legis
lature for really essential problems.
I,EANSE
I asked you the other evening
what we should do away with in
student government; you said Rally
j Com should be done away with.
RALPH
Did you quote me as saying Rally
Com should be done away with? 11

I said to do away with Rally Com
I'm very sorry .' . , there may be
some people from Rally Com in the
audiencie. . . .
LEANSE
Are you in favor of abolishing all
committees?
RALPH
My idea is not to abolish commit
tees at the outset. Give them a
chance to produce results. Let them
have a party but they won't need
ASSU funds.
'I' li e seven-and-a-half-minute
period closed. Riiitf gave Ralph
the floor to question Leanse.
RALPH
You are for construction, not de
struction. How do you propose to
construct on a constitution already
constructed?
LEANSE
George, I think I did mention that
in my speech. I don't mean adding
to or building on the constitution
but a strengthening within, a con
structive approach.
RALPH
It seems to me that the students
have expressed a desire that some

ment. I think it had some effort
along that line.

Ralph look over the questioning.

RALPH
You spoke oi an edueatinn pro
grain for freshmen. How would you
go about carrying out this educa
tion?
LEANSE
One unit class on student govern
ment. I think we have enough other
creative people to devise some kind
?>! education program using slides,
movies, and so on.
RALPH
I wonder if you have any .specific*
ideas about how to increase student
interest in government?
Li: ANSI-
Several things, Geovge: training
people, making government mean
ingful, increasing desire to partici
pate. . . . Too often students fail to
realize that everyone is the recipient
in student government even if they
don't participate.
RALPH
You mentioned the Honor Code as
part of student government. Do you
feel that the Code is part of student
government or something given to
us by the faculty as a privilege?
LEANSE
My conception of the Honor Code
is that it was granted as a privilege
by the faculty in 1927.
RALPH
In 1927 by the faculty . . . that
answers my question doesn't it?
At this point Ring ended the
question period and called 011
Leanse to present the (irst sum
mary.
LEANSE
My program includes the follow
ing points:
1) Construction of positive student
government.
2) Student government must ho
more meaningful.
3) We need evaluation to do away
with weakness.
Making the Legislature work will
also bring government closer to stu
dents and make it more meaningful.
Then Ralph summarized his po
sition.
RALPH
I have heard some talk concern
ing dignity, responsibility concerning
the offices of Stanford University.
This should be considered.
I would like to feel that the cam
paign is not a joke, but a novel ap
proach to get some students think
ing more seriously about student
government.
I presented certain reforms to you
that I feel would make student gov
ernment a more vital thing. If I am
elected, I would feel my election
would be a mandate of the students
to work on these reforms.

Reprinted below is a digest of
the debate between ASSU presi

Leanse and George Ralph held
last night in Cubberley Audito

on KZSU. Present ASSU Presi
dent Peter Bing moderated. For
summary story of debate, see

ASSU President Pete Bing in
troduced the candidates, George

plained thai they would each offer
a 10-niinute opening address, qui/,
each other in four seven-minute
periods, and linish with a sum
mary .statement 1 .
Kajph was the firsf speaker.

GEORGE RALPH

A number of you have heard me
in your living groups. I feel I may
have left some of you unsatisfied.
. . . I do riot intend to overthrow
student government. It would be
impossible.
I do not, have not ever, and I
don't expect to ride a motorcycle.
. . . J hope the campaign will be
fought on issues rather than per
sonalities. The stories circulating
are quite untrue; we are not gutter
snipes. None of my friends have
ever appeared on a charge of Honor
Code violation.
What concrete things do I propose
to do?
The Cabinet shall assist the presi
dent in the co-ordination of ASSU
activities. ... I propose reform in
Legislature and Cabinet; executive
power is concentrated in the hands
of the Cabinet under the present
setup.
Having committee chairmen for
executive offices is inexcusable.
Here is an example of undemocratic
government: rubber - stamping the
president's decision. The Legisla
ture is a body of your representa
tives. The Cabinet is a closet cor
poration of the president and made
up of committee heads.
Class affairs can just as well be
handled completely independent of
it. . . . lIR could take under its
wing Foreign Scholarship Commit
tee. Duties of public relations can
be combined with the Student-Fac
ulty Committee; thus reforms could
be carried with adequate student
government. . . .
Any man should be able to run for
head yell leader. He should work in
close co-operation with Rally Com.
I have nothing personal against
NSA; we joined it through undemo
cratic processes. Students should
have a chance to vote on it, I be
lieve. I proposed this; it was origi
nal with me.
One should- be innocent until
proven guilty. What if you were a
student, would you want your char
acter blighted for the rest of your
life? I object to accusations tanta
mount to guilt in the Honor Code.
Student apathy is a definite failing
which can't be corrected by student
officers. ...
I expect no support in my stand
of the various Com-ocrats. I feel
that reform is necessary; it would
be my mandate from the students
to do all that I can to carry out these
reforms. . . .

NATE LEANSE

In answer to various questions
which people have asked me about
my campaign: By joining NSA, we
can make our voice heard on vari
ous campuses and in national af
fairs. I am strongly in favor of our
affiliation but I feel students should
decide.
During the campaign as a result
of the recent clarification of the
Honor Code, it has been said that
wc have an Honor Code without
honor. There is a basic misunder
standing. It was never stated by the
faculty lhat tests could be taken
from the room. The clarification is
not a change, but a return to what
was originally granted. The Honor
Code is a privilege. It builds re
sponsibility and integrity.
How would construction be car
ried out? First there must be an
education program on student gov
ernment. The faculty explains aca

demic life (to incoming freshmen).
! There also (should be) time ... to
j explain student government.
In some universities, there is a
one-unit, one-quarter course in stu
dent government. It is necessary
(to find out what education pro
gram is best for Stanford) when
student government is accused of
being, in essence, composed of mul
j titudinous, driveling committees.
; There are only 18 committees for a
community of 7.000.
They perform functions for which
the administration would otherwise
have to pay. The criteria for evalu
ation of these committees should be
! determined by the Legislature. IBM
; cards or a questionnaire system
could be devised to see what stu
dents desire in the way of activities.
The campaign has undergone a
change of appearance ... a complete
reversal. No longer is it "govern
ment versus no government" but
rather a question of a positive or a
negative approach (to government).
In the May 10 Daily . . . the ASSU
was evaluated as a "head hand
shaker." If this is the concept of
the role, then either the possibili
! ties of achievement are overlooked,
or there is a negative attitude to
ward ASSU government. The . . .
president's role (must) not be de
formalized or reduced. For a more
1 meaningful, mors effective govern
ment, the president's role must be
elevated to face the . . . obvious . . .
challenge of making teh new consti
tution meaningful and effective in
j the eyes of the students.
This can be achieved through ed
j ucation and evaluation by many
willing hands. . . . ASSU govern
ment can be made more meaning
ful to students if approached in a
! constructive, positive way.
After Lcanse's opening speech,
Ring switched (lie program into a
question-and-answer period be
tween the two candidates. Eeanse
asked the opening round of qucs
j tions.
LEANSE
You said in your speech you
would abolish the Cabinet. How
could you achieve co-ordination of
the major activities?
RALPH
I believe co-ordination should
come from the Legislature. The
Cabinet does not have this power,
but would come to assert this pow
er. Committees with autonomy
would be able to work with just as
much efficiency and save the Legis
lature for really essential problems.
I,EANSE
I asked you the other evening
what we should do away with in
student government; you said Rally
j Com should be done away with.
RALPH
Did you quote me as saying Rally
Com should be done away with? 11

I said to do away with Rally Com
I'm very sorry .' . , there may be
some people from Rally Com in the
audiencie. . . .
LEANSE
Are you in favor of abolishing all
committees?
RALPH
My idea is not to abolish commit
tees at the outset. Give them a
chance to produce results. Let them
have a party but they won't need
ASSU funds.
'I' li e seven-and-a-half-minute
period closed. Riiitf gave Ralph
the floor to question Leanse.
RALPH
You are for construction, not de
struction. How do you propose to
construct on a constitution already
constructed?
LEANSE
George, I think I did mention that
in my speech. I don't mean adding
to or building on the constitution
but a strengthening within, a con
structive approach.
RALPH
It seems to me that the students
have expressed a desire that some
reform is necessary. I want to know
what you think about this.
LEANSE
I cannot tell whether reform is
necessary until I can put the pro
gram I have proposed in working
order. IBM cards or no, I cannot
tell. .
RALPH
Am I correct in assuming that
NSA should be put up to the stu
dents to decide?
LEANSE
Yes.
RALPH
Would you agree that the appear
ance clause of the Honor Code is
somewhat unfortunate?
LEANSE
I don't understand what you mean
by the appearance clause.
RALPH
It seems to me that the recent
clarification makes it seem that the
student is guilty till proven inno
cent. Do you see this in it?
LEANSE
What I do know is this: I talked
to Bill Allen, member of the Honor
Code Committee, and he told me
students are not guilty until proven j
so; that is my understanding of the j
Honor Code.
RALPH
We don't agree on the matter of
! abolishing the Cabinet. Do you feel
that the close advisers to the presi
dent should be the representatives
I of the student body or not?

LEANSE
I feel that people nearest to the
president should be only in the sense
of advisory capacity. My conception
of the Cabinet is an advisory hody
only.
RALPH
Don't you feel that the "Cabinet
could usurp the legislative power?
Doesn't this make sense that the
Legislature would become a rub
ber-stamping body?
LEANSE
No, I do not. The Cabinet as such
j doesn't have a vote in the Legisla
j ture. There is only the one vote of
! the president.
RALPH
Do I understand that you consider
me to be in favor of abolishing pub
lications, Sunday Evening Flicks,
Ram's Head?
LEANSE
George, I'm not sure what you're
opposing.
RALPH
Do you not feel that the constitu-
J tion should be cut down and the
1 unctions cut down and combined to
[ save considerable money?
LEANSE
I do not want to return a question
to you, but I wish you would give
me some examples of cutting down.
RALPH
I believe in my speech I mentioned
drives, Political Union. Board, and
so on.
LEANSE
To my knowledge if they perform
different functions and if they need
different experts, they should not be
combined. Unless activities so much
1 overlap that this would be necessary.
At this point, Leanse took over
(he questioning.
LEANSE
You said that there would be real
value in deformalizing the office of
the President. Is this a failure on
your part to recognize the import
ance of the President?
RALPH
Well, I don't believe that I or any
one else would admit to a failure.
I feel that the office of the President
should be as informal, as casual as
possible, allowing contact with the
student body.
LEANSE
What is your conception of the
I student body president's role?
RALPH
I feel that the most important role
: of the ASSU president is his rela
j tionship with people off campus. Ad
| ministrative duties could be reduced.
LEANSE
What do you mean by diminishing
these activities?
RALPH
Along with diminishing the super

fluous rubber-stamping activities of
the Legislature, I believe in giving
them autonomy, to make their own
decisions and let them decide matters
they know hest. having the Legisla
ture make decisions which pertain
to the whole campus.
LEANSE
You mention the Legislature and
not the president. You haven't
answered the question.
RALI'Ii
In that the president presides over
the Legislature. 1 assume when the
legislature's duties would be dimin
ished, the president's would Ik* also.
LEANSE
Look, your program has changed.
How do we know what you stand
for?
RALPH
I feel only the approach has
changed. My purpose was to stir up
some thinking about student govern
ment. I think it had some effort
along that line.

Ralph look over the questioning.

RALPH
You spoke oi an edueatinn pro
grain for freshmen. How would you
