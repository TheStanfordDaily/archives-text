# Rocky Holds Title By TKO in Ninth
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. May 1G (UP)â€”
Heavyweight champion Rocky Mar
ciano ripped England's game Don
Cockell with a combined hooking
attack to the head and body tonight,
floored the bloody fat man three
times, and won a technical knock
out at 54 seconds of the ninth round
of their title fight.
Cockell, with blood flowing down
his face from a gash high on the
forehead, was knocked halfway
through the ring ropes onto the
apron with a right to the back of
the neck just before the bell rang
to end the eighth round. The count
had reached three when the bell
sounded.
In the ninth round Rocky went
all out to put him away before he
himself tired from throwing so many
punches at the surprisingly rugged
Briton.
