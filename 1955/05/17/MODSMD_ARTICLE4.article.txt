## (Compiled from dispatches of the United Press) Molotov Talks to Austrian Leaders 
### 
VIENNA, May 16â€”Soviet Foreign
Minister V. M. Molotov tried today
to steal a diplomatic march on the
West by arranging a surprise and
secret meeting with the leaders of
newly freed Austria.
The foreign ministers of the West
ern Big Three were no more than
safely out of Vienna when the
Kremlin's chief diplomat let it slip
out that the "sightseeing" he had
stayed to do included a meeting
with Austrian Chancellor Julius
Raab.
Allied sources interpreted Russia's
moves as Moscow's latest strategy to
pave the way for creation of a belt
of neutral states between East and
West Europe.
