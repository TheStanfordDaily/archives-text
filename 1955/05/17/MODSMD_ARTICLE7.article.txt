SAIGON, Indochina â€” American
backed Premier Ngo Dinh Diem was
believed today to have set in motion
a final drive to oust Emperor Bao
Dai from the government of free
South Viet Nam.
Bao Dai's title of emperor is a
courtesy designation, retained from
the time when he was monarch. He
has no actual throne to lose.
The premier yesterday abruptly
dissolved the 5,000 - man imperial
guard and incorporated Bno Pii's
personal forces into the national
army as infantry units.
