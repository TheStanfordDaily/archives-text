# Cal Trips Cards, 4-2, In Dean's Last Game
## 
### BOB DURAND 
Playing as it were the first game of the season instead of the
l»i:jt. Stanford's varsity baseballers closed out the 1955 schedule
by dropping a 4-2, 11 inning decision to the Golden Bears of Cali
fornia yesterday afternoon on the Sunken Diamond.
Although they were hindered by a lack of hitting and six errors

in the field, the Indian nine managed
to keep a 2-1 lead until the eighth
and almo.jt were able to pull the con
test out of the fire in their effort to
give retiring head coach Everett
Dean a victory in his last game.
However, the visitors were able to
push across a run in that inning
to send the game into extra innings.
The 2-2 deadlock remained until the
top of the eleventh when a Tribe
miseue and two Cal basehits left
Stanford two runs on the short side.
Righthander Ray Young went the
distance for coach Dean's men and
turned in a creditable performance
that was marred only by the sloppy
fielding. Young, himself, was charged
with two errors, both overthrows to
bases.
Chuck Becker started for the Bears
but was relieved in the second frame
by Doug Weiss. Weiss finished the
game, striking out seven and allow
ing but five bingles in the nine in
nings he toiled. The sophomore star
was credited with the win.
The Cards registered the first run
on the scoreboard in the third when
co-captain and centerfielder Sid Hall
singled to left, advanced on a stolen
base and a wild pitch, and scored

CLOSES CAREER —Retiring baseball coach Everett Dean gazes across the Sunken Diamond, his
"home base" for the past 17 years. He ended his 35-year coaching career after yesterday's game
against California, which the Indians dropped 4-2 in 11 innings. Dean, who coached the 1942
NCAA championship basketball team, will retire to his farm in Indiana.
on an infield single by Rich Scra
maglia.
The Blue & Geld horsehiders tied j
it up in the fifth with the help of ;
the Tribe misplays. Doug Stowell 1
opened the inning by drawing an
innocent-looking hase-on-balls. The

fun started when he attempted to
.steal second.
Tribe catcher Len Schwartz over
threw the bag leaving the runner
safe. The next batter Doug Weiss
acrificed; Young picked up the bunt,
turned to throw to first, found no
one there, instead threw to third—
wild. Stowell easily crossed the
plate.
TIIE SHOW GOES ON
Even though Cal did not score
again during the inning, the show
continued as Art Weldon sacrificed
and gained first on a fielders choice
when an attempt to get Weiss at
third was late. Weldon then stole
second.*
Sliding into the bag. the Bear
shortstop upset Scramaglia who fell
on top of him. Being stunned by this,
Weldon let go of the bag, whereupon
Scrag tagged him for the first out.
However, the visitors did not like
this call, and their whole dugout im

mediately proceeded to the infield to
let the umpire, Seacap Christian
sen, know as much. When the .smoke
had cleared away several minutes
later, the inning was soon brought
to an end.
SECOND RUN
The Tribe scored their second and

final run in the sixth by virtue of
their only extra-base blow of the
contest—a double to lel't by Scra
maglia. The senior shortstop tallied
after going to third on a passed ball
and then coming in on a single by
Rudy Figueroa.
California gained their important
tying marker when first-sacker A 1
Kyte tripled past Dixie Workman in
right. Kyte romped home on a hard
grounded to short by teammate
Lloyd Canton.
The last of the eighth and the ninth
saw neither team get a runner on
first. In the last of the ninth, three
Card batters were retired on three
straight pitches.
The Golden Bears threatened in
their half of the tenth as the In
dians gave up two errors and a walk.
Once again, though, they failed to
score, and the Indians followed suit
in their half.
The decisive inning came next.

Cal's John Derdivanis gained first
on a walk and was sacrificed to sec
end by Ron Gaggero. Substitute
outfielder Ted Pollock then became
the hero of the day by cracking a
double down the left field line thus
bringing across the winning run.
An insurance was added moments

j later as L?s Mitchell singled infield
i to second. Tribe baseballer Mickey
Holzman hobbled the ball when he
attempted to make a throw, and Pol
lack registered the fourth run.
The win gave Weiss a five-won.
1 two-lost record in league play, while
for Young, it was the fourth loss
against five triumphs.

final run in the sixth by virtue of

opened the inning by drawing an
innocent-looking hase-on-balls. The

fun started when he attempted to

threw the bag leaving the runner
safe. The next batter Doug Weiss
acrificed; Young picked up the bunt,
turned to throw to first, found no
one there, instead threw to third—

plate.
TIIE SHOW GOES ON
Even though Cal did not score
again during the inning, the show
continued as Art Weldon sacrificed
and gained first on a fielders choice
when an attempt to get Weiss at
third was late. Weldon then stole
second.*
Sliding into the bag. the Bear
shortstop upset Scramaglia who fell
on top of him. Being stunned by this,
Weldon let go of the bag, whereupon
Scrag tagged him for the first out.
However, the visitors did not like
this call, and their whole dugout im

mediately proceeded to the infield to
let the umpire, Seacap Christian
sen, know as much. When the .smoke
had cleared away several minutes
later, the inning was soon brought
to an end.
SECOND RUN
The Tribe scored their second and

final run in the sixth by virtue of
their only extra-base blow of the
contest—a double to lel't by Scra

after going to third on a passed ball
and then coming in on a single by
Rudy Figueroa.
California gained their important
tying marker when first-sacker A 1

score, and the Indians followed suit
in their half.
The decisive inning came next.

Cal's John Derdivanis gained first
on a walk and was sacrificed to sec
end by Ron Gaggero. Substitute

Playing as it were the first game of the season instead of the
l»i:jt. Stanford's varsity baseballers closed out the 1955 schedule
by dropping a 4-2, 11 inning decision to the Golden Bears of Cali
fornia yesterday afternoon on the Sunken Diamond.
Although they were hindered by a lack of hitting and six errors

in the field, the Indian nine managed
to keep a 2-1 lead until the eighth
and almo.jt were able to pull the con
test out of the fire in their effort to
give retiring head coach Everett
Dean a victory in his last game.
However, the visitors were able to
push across a run in that inning
to send the game into extra innings.
The 2-2 deadlock remained until the
top of the eleventh when a Tribe
miseue and two Cal basehits left
Stanford two runs on the short side.
Righthander Ray Young went the
distance for coach Dean's men and
turned in a creditable performance
that was marred only by the sloppy
fielding. Young, himself, was charged
with two errors, both overthrows to
bases.
Chuck Becker started for the Bears
but was relieved in the second frame
by Doug Weiss. Weiss finished the
game, striking out seven and allow
ing but five bingles in the nine in
nings he toiled. The sophomore star
was credited with the win.
The Cards registered the first run
on the scoreboard in the third when
co-captain and centerfielder Sid Hall
singled to left, advanced on a stolen
base and a wild pitch, and scored

CLOSES CAREER —Retiring baseball coach Everett Dean gazes across the Sunken Diamond, his
"home base" for the past 17 years. He ended his 35-year coaching career after yesterday's game
against California, which the Indians dropped 4-2 in 11 innings. Dean, who coached the 1942
NCAA championship basketball team, will retire to his farm in Indiana.
