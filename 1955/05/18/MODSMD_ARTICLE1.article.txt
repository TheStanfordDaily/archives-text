## 
### BOB DURAND 
Playing as it were the first game of the season instead of the
l»i:jt. Stanford's varsity baseballers closed out the 1955 schedule
by dropping a 4-2, 11 inning decision to the Golden Bears of Cali
fornia yesterday afternoon on the Sunken Diamond.
Although they were hindered by a lack of hitting and six errors

in the field, the Indian nine managed
to keep a 2-1 lead until the eighth
and almo.jt were able to pull the con
test out of the fire in their effort to
give retiring head coach Everett
Dean a victory in his last game.
However, the visitors were able to
push across a run in that inning
to send the game into extra innings.
The 2-2 deadlock remained until the
top of the eleventh when a Tribe
miseue and two Cal basehits left
Stanford two runs on the short side.
Righthander Ray Young went the
distance for coach Dean's men and
turned in a creditable performance
that was marred only by the sloppy
fielding. Young, himself, was charged
with two errors, both overthrows to
bases.
Chuck Becker started for the Bears
but was relieved in the second frame
by Doug Weiss. Weiss finished the
game, striking out seven and allow
ing but five bingles in the nine in
nings he toiled. The sophomore star
was credited with the win.
The Cards registered the first run
on the scoreboard in the third when
co-captain and centerfielder Sid Hall
singled to left, advanced on a stolen
base and a wild pitch, and scored
