## Israel Trip Described by SRI's Allen 
### MARY ELLEN ROMNEY 
A pictorial tour of Israel was
conducted last night in Memo
rial Auditorium by Dr. J. Knight
Allen, Stanford Research Insti
tute economist recently returned
from the near Eastern country.
"Israel — Desert Miracle or
Mirage" was his topic.
Dr. Allen, whose talk was pri
marily a commentary on a large set
of colored slides taken in Israel last
year, was optimistic about the fu
ture of the new republic.- "Their
industrial progress has been spec
tacular — almost miraculous."
"But will they survive economi
] cally? I believe the answer is a
qualified yes. They are still largely
dependent on outside help." Dr. Al
len listed the world Jewry, the
I United States, and reparation pay-
I ments from the German government
as the three major sources of Is
rael's outside income.
POOR TRADE BALANCE
The need for aid stems from the
j unfavorable trade balance, Dr. Allen
continued. Israel's imports far ex
ceed her exports. They are striving
for agricultural self-sufficiency, but
still have great shortages of bread
grains and meat.
On the credit side, Israel has de
j veloped a booming citrus industry,
j Oranges have become her major ex
] port. Salt, potash, magnesium, phos
phate rock, and other chemicals are
potentially profitable natural indus
tries.
Dr. Allen began his talk with a
brief summary of the country's his
tory. "Israel became a parliamen
tary republic May 15, 1948. and an
I armistice was declared in 1949. fix
ing her borders." The country was
divided between the Arabs and the
Jews, leaving Jerusalem interna
! tional. '"However, peace has not yet
j been concluded. . . . Controversy
J is too mild a term to be applied to
Israel," he said.
STRATEGIC POSITION
Israel has a strategic position.
{ "placed at the crossroads of Asia,
Africa, and Europe. She is at a po
| litical crossroads, also," Dr. Allen
continued. "All types of political
and social ideologies can be found in
Israel. Her people are of GO dis
| tinct racial groups."
A geographic survey of the coun
try was illustrated with slides show
ing the four main areas: Galilee, the
coastal plain, the hills of Judea, and
| the Nagive desert.
In commenting on the collective
farming enterprises being attempted
throughout the country, Dr. Allen
concluded: "The Israelis abhor slav
ery of any kind, and dislike Com
munism. They are ingenius and ag
gressive, and strong individualists.
They can take collectivism or leave
i it alone."
