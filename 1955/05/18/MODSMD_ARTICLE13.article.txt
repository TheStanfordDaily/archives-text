# POISON OAK
## Three-Leaved Menace Threatens Farm Hikers 
### SALLY TRAPNELL 
"Leaves three, let it be." According to Dr. George Houck, di
rector of the Stanford Health Service, this is a slogan that every
Stanford student should remember when tempted to go walking
where there might be poison oak.
The blisters and itchiness which characterizes poison oak are

| particularly prevalent around cam
pus, says Dr. Houck. mainly be
cause students are ignorant of how
to recognize the plant, and thus they
run straight into it while hiking or
! lounging around Lake Lag.
DANCE DECORATION
Because of this ignorance, the
decorations for three student dances
in the past few years have included
the reddish branches of poison oak.
In each instance, the Health Service
was kept busy for the next few days.
This year the total number of
j poison oak cases has been much
smaller, due mainly to the bad
weather during early spring quar
ter, Dr. Houck said.
Students haven't had as much of
| a chance to get near the plants, but
j with the return of spring weather,
the Health Service expects the num
ber of cases to rise again.
According to Dr. Houck, the stu
dent should remember three things
to avoid being among the uncom
j fortable poison oak sufferers.
THREE RULES
First, each student should famil
iarize himself with the plant's ap
l pearance. There are many differ
ent varieties, sizes, shapes, and col
ors of poison oak. The Health Serv
] ice has specimens of some leaves for
i display.
There are few places on campus
' that do not have poison oak; the
! lake, golf course, and hills in back of
j campus are especially infested.
Secondly, if you do get poison oak.
j the best treatment is a hot bath,
j preferably with a strong soap. Some
cases can be entirely prevented in
this way.
Dr. Houck's third piece of ad
: vice is to yet a serious case of poi
son oak if you get it at all. That is
because there is no known treat
ment lor mild eases. However, the
serious ones can be treated with
i ACTH which clears up blisters in a
few days.
