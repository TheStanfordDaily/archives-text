Presidential aspirants Nathan Le
anse and George Ralph lead 44 other
office-seekers to the climax of a
campaign which has seen everything
from motorcycle caravans to a lively
debate in Cubberley Auditorium
Monday night.
PLATFORMS
Leanse has based his campaign on
the principle of "construction, not
destruction, of student government."
He advocates "strengthening the
government from within, without
reforming it."
Ralph has emphasized reforming
the government by eliminating the
Cabinet set up under the new con
stitution and combining various
groups which now function as sepa
rate committees. He has termed the
Cabinet "a closet corporation of the
president and made up of commit
tee heads."
In the primary elections last week
Ralph, an off-campus student ma
joring in history, topped Leanse by
a 17-vote margin. Leanse is an eco
nomics major and member of Phi
Kappa Psi.
PRESENT CARDS
When voting today students must
present student body cards which
will be punched by clerks at the
polls. Students are also requested
by Election Board to check both
class and living group on the sheets
provided.
Each student is entitled to vote for
three members of Men's or Women's
Council, but ballots will be counted
even though only one or two names
are marked.
Voting for class officers is accord
ing to class standing at the time the
candidate will take office. The only
exception is for seniors who are in
graduate school. If they have "grad
uate" circled on their student body
cards, they may vote as graduates.
