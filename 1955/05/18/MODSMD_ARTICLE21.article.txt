# KNIGHT ADVISES:
## 'Either Law Or Politicsâ€” Not Both' 
### JIM PALMER 
"If you want to be a lawyer,
do not plan to be a politician."
This was the advice of jovial
Governor Goodwin J. Knight, a
politician who once was a law-
yer, as he spoke last night at
Rickey's at a banquet sponsored
by Stanford's Holmes chapter of
Phi Alpha Delta, national legal
fraternity.
With his attractive, young wife
seated on his left, the Governor
spoke to 83 law students and other
guests about the changing position
of the lawyer in politics.
With his customary gusto, the
Governor pointed out that the lives
of lawyers have changed in the past
50 years. "Lawyers are no longer
politicians ... no longer the un
disputed leaders of politics. Law
yers are specialists today . . . they
| have less time and energy to de
vote to a political career."
MEMORIES
Smiling broadly, former Phi Al
pha Delt Knight interspersed his
message to the law students with a
few remembrances of his college ac
tivities at Stanford. (He was grad
-1 uated in 1919 after an active .stu
dent life that ranged from associ
! ate editor of the Chaparral to mem
ber of a dramatics group and Joffre
debater.
(The Governor commented be-
forehand that he had worked on The
Daily, and then switched to the
Chappie because "it was much eas
ier work.")
Knight cited Calvin Coolidge,
Franklin Roosevelt, and Earl War
ren as examples that lawyers and
politicians have become separate
fields today.
"All were admitted to law," he
said, "but Coolidge never tried any
important cases before he became
| engaged in public office . . . Roose
velt never graduated from law
school . . . and Warren practiced his
law in the public service, not in
private practice."
LUNCH WITH WARREN
In an aside, Knight commented
that he had luncheon with Warren
in Washington two weeks ago. "We
reminisced, speculated, and made
predictions. . ."
Returning to message, Knight
j reviewed the list of California Gov
ernors and United States Presidents,
concluding that "six Governors were
never lawyers and none out of eight
Presidents were lawyers ... in this
century."
With a non-partisan glow, Knight
referred to Woodrow Wilson "as a
great man, who said and wrote and
did remarkable things."
In a closing ceremony last night,
Knight presented the first annual
award by Phi Alpha Delta to the
outstanding law school senior, Dell
Fuller.

Returning to message, Knight
j reviewed the list of California Gov
ernors and United States Presidents,
concluding that "six Governors were
never lawyers and none out of eight
Presidents were lawyers ... in this
century."
With a non-partisan glow, Knight
referred to Woodrow Wilson "as a
great man, who said and wrote and
did remarkable things."
In a closing ceremony last night,
Knight presented the first annual
award by Phi Alpha Delta to the
outstanding law school senior, Dell
Fuller.
"If you want to be a lawyer,
do not plan to be a politician."
This was the advice of jovial
Governor Goodwin J. Knight, a
politician who once was a law-
yer, as he spoke last night at
Rickey's at a banquet sponsored
by Stanford's Holmes chapter of
Phi Alpha Delta, national legal
fraternity.
With his attractive, young wife
seated on his left, the Governor
spoke to 83 law students and other
guests about the changing position
of the lawyer in politics.
With his customary gusto, the
Governor pointed out that the lives
of lawyers have changed in the past
50 years. "Lawyers are no longer
politicians ... no longer the un
disputed leaders of politics. Law
yers are specialists today . . . they
| have less time and energy to de
vote to a political career."
MEMORIES
Smiling broadly, former Phi Al
pha Delt Knight interspersed his
message to the law students with a
few remembrances of his college ac
tivities at Stanford. (He was grad
-1 uated in 1919 after an active .stu
dent life that ranged from associ
! ate editor of the Chaparral to mem
ber of a dramatics group and Joffre
debater.
(The Governor commented be-
forehand that he had worked on The
Daily, and then switched to the
Chappie because "it was much eas
ier work.")
Knight cited Calvin Coolidge,
Franklin Roosevelt, and Earl War
ren as examples that lawyers and
politicians have become separate
fields today.
"All were admitted to law," he
said, "but Coolidge never tried any
important cases before he became
| engaged in public office . . . Roose
velt never graduated from law
school . . . and Warren practiced his
law in the public service, not in
private practice."
LUNCH WITH WARREN
In an aside, Knight commented
that he had luncheon with Warren
in Washington two weeks ago. "We
reminisced, speculated, and made
predictions. . ."
