# KNIGHT ADVISES:
## 'Either Law Or Politics— Not Both' 
### JIM PALMER 
"If you want to be a lawyer,
do not plan to be a politician."
This was the advice of jovial
Governor Goodwin J. Knight, a
politician who once was a lav/-
yer, as he spoke last night at
Rickey's at a banquet sponsored
by Stanford's Holmes chapter of
Phi Alpha Delta, national legal
fraternity.
With his attractive, younn wife
j seated on his left, the Governor
! spoke to 83 law students and other
i guests about the changing position
| of the lawyer in politics.
With his customary gusto, the
Governor pointed out that the live.-,
of lawyers have changed in the past
50 years. "Lawyers are no longer
politicians ... no longer the un
disputed leaders of politics. Law
yers are specialists today . . . they
| have less time and energy to de
vote to a political career."
MEMORIES
Smiling broadly, former Phi Al
- pha Delt Knight interspersed hi -
I message to the law students with a
few remembrances of his college ac
tivities at Stanford. (He was grad
-1 uated in 1919 after an active .stu
dent life that ranged from associ
! ate editor of the Chaparral to mem
ber of a dramatics group and Jo/Irc
j debater.
(The Governor commented be -
j forehand that he had worked on The
• Daily, and then switched to the
Chappie because "it was much eas
j ier work.")
Knight cited Calvin Coolidge,
Franklin Roosevelt, and Earl War
j ren as examples that lawyers and
politicians have become separate
fields today.
"All were admitted to law," he
said, "but Coolidge never tried any
j important cases before he became
| engaged in public office . . . Roose
[ velt never graduated from law
school . . . and Warren practiced his
j law in the public service, not in
I private practice."
LUNCH WITH WARREN
In an aside, Knight commented
that he had luncheon with Warren
! in Washington two weeks ago. "We
| reminisced, speculated, and made
! predictions. . .
Returning to message. Knight,
j reviewed the list of California Gov
ernors and United States Presidents,
j concluding that "six Governors were
! never lawyers ami none out of eigh'
Presidents were lawyers ... in this
j century."
With a non-partisan glow, Knight
! referred to Woodrow Wilson "as a
great man, who said and wrote and
did remarkable things."
In a closing ceremony last night,
Knight presented the first annual
j award by Phi Alpha Delta to the
! outstanding law school senior, Dell
Fuller.

With his customary gusto, the
Governor pointed out that the live.-,
of lawyers have changed in the past
50 years. "Lawyers are no longer
politicians ... no longer the un
disputed leaders of politics. Law
yers are specialists today . . . they
| have less time and energy to de
vote to a political career."
MEMORIES
Smiling broadly, former Phi Al
- pha Delt Knight interspersed hi -
I message to the law students with a
few remembrances of his college ac
tivities at Stanford. (He was grad
-1 uated in 1919 after an active .stu
dent life that ranged from associ
! ate editor of the Chaparral to mem
ber of a dramatics group and Jo/Irc
j debater.
(The Governor commented be -
j forehand that he had worked on The
• Daily, and then switched to the
Chappie because "it was much eas
j ier work.")
Knight cited Calvin Coolidge,
Franklin Roosevelt, and Earl War
j ren as examples that lawyers and
politicians have become separate
fields today.
"All were admitted to law," he
said, "but Coolidge never tried any
j important cases before he became
| engaged in public office . . . Roose
[ velt never graduated from law
school . . . and Warren practiced his
j law in the public service, not in
I private practice."
LUNCH WITH WARREN
In an aside, Knight commented
that he had luncheon with Warren
! in Washington two weeks ago. "We
| reminisced, speculated, and made
! predictions. . .
Returning to message. Knight,
j reviewed the list of California Gov
ernors and United States Presidents,
j concluding that "six Governors were
! never lawyers ami none out of eigh'
Presidents were lawyers ... in this
j century."
With a non-partisan glow, Knight
! referred to Woodrow Wilson "as a
great man, who said and wrote and
did remarkable things."
In a closing ceremony last night,
Knight presented the first annual
j award by Phi Alpha Delta to the
! outstanding law school senior, Dell
Fuller.
"If you want to be a lawyer,
do not plan to be a politician."
This was the advice of jovial
Governor Goodwin J. Knight, a
politician who once was a lav/-
yer, as he spoke last night at
Rickey's at a banquet sponsored
by Stanford's Holmes chapter of
Phi Alpha Delta, national legal
fraternity.
With his attractive, younn wife
j seated on his left, the Governor
! spoke to 83 law students and other
i guests about the changing position
| of the lawyer in politics.
