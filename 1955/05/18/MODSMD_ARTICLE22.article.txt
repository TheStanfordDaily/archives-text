The Stanford Affiliation Committee of the Free
University of Berlin sents its annual invitation
to the Stanford student hody in care of The Daily.
It is reprinted here.—Ed.
Dear Stanfordites:
During the coming summer many of you
perhaps may be planning a Lrip to Europe,
hoping to absorb a little of that "Old World
culture." The Stanford Affiliation Commit
teo hers r . the Free University would like to
renew its annual invitation to all of you
travelers, students and faculty members
alike, to come to Berlin during your Euro
pean visit. The unique situation of this free
city behind the Iron Curtain and the unpar
alleled opportunity Berlin affords for getting
a good look at Communism in practice, make
any trip to Europe without a few days here
incomplete.
The five of us Berliners who have studied
at Stanford, the two currently here from the
Stanford Affiliation Committee would be de
lighted io act as your host and help you io
get to know our ci!y. It will be a pleasure
for us to contribute to the strengthening of
the bonds of friendship which have grown

up between our two schools through the
Stanford-Free University affiliation.
Visitors to Berlin need have no worries
about having difficulties with the Russians,
nor is the visit to our city as expensive as one
might expect —a round trip air ticket from
Hannover, for example, costs less than SIS,
and if you notify us a few weeks in advance,
we can probably make reservations for you
on the military train from Bremen or Frank
furt at an even cheaper rate.
If some of you could arrange io come to
gether in groups to Berlin, that would, of
course, make our planning easier, but single
individuals are also most welcome, and a
card from you a few days before your ar
rival here will enable us to set up various
tours, etc. Write us in care of the Aussen
referat der Freien Universitaet, Berlin-Dah
lem, Garystrasse 20.
With V3ry best wishes and hoping to see
you all this summer.
