It will be virtually a one item agenda at Leg
islature tonight.
Eric Fricker of Election Board v/ill present
his official report on an A3SU election which
has evoked a new high in student interest in
their government. Count on a perfect-attend
ance record for Legislature members tonight
and that in itself is rare and plenty of intar
ested spectators.
Center of interest, of course, is the student
body-president race, which in itself has excited
a v/dve of siiident feeling which will probably
overcome all the election turnout records of
ASSU. Pricker will have some interesting sta
tistics to report on the turnout and its composi
tion.
As to the outcome itself: Flicker will an
nounce it in Cubberley Auditorium — where
the presidential finalists debated before a
packed house Monday night—before dinner.
But again, as in the primaries, candidates with
questions and complaints and people who
want to hear the official report approved will
go to Legislature at 7:30.
As to the race which has forced all the other

campaigns into the shade: Fricker says of the
presidential contest between Nate Lsanse and
George Ralph, "I don't know can't tell yet —
who's winning, but 1 can tell you thai if it's
close, there'll be headaches. That's when my
w.ork really starts!"
And start it will: close elections mean re
count of the ballots. If the early turnout pace
continues, there may be more than 4,000 bal
lots to recount. Word of graduate apathy was
contradicted yesterday about noon when a
solid phalanx of graduate men marched across
the library grass to vote at the central polling
place. Fricker is happy with the turnout, but
he's scratching his head over possible protest
of the count or the campaigns.
Tight class and Legislature election races are
being v/on and lost on the library grass loday,
and the principals in those races will be at the
Legislature tonight. It's the climax of a great
election, admirably well run by Fricker's Elec
tion Board and sparked in large measure by
the vigor of the presidential campaign, and the
story of that election v/ill be told tonight when
the Legislature meets at 7:30 p.m. in the Excom
room, Student Union.

ested spectators.
Center of interest, of course, is the student
body-president race, which in itself has excited
a v/dve of siiident feeling which will probably
overcome all the election turnout records of
ASSU. Pricker will have some interesting sta
tistics to report on the turnout and its composi
tion.
As to the outcome itself: Flicker will an
nounce it in Cubberley Auditorium — where
the presidential finalists debated before a
packed house Monday night—before dinner.
But again, as in the primaries, candidates with
questions and complaints and people who
want to hear the official report approved will
go to Legislature at 7:30.
As to the race which has forced all the other

campaigns into the shade: Fricker says of the
presidential contest between Nate Lsanse and
George Ralph, "I don't know can't tell yet —
who's winning, but 1 can tell you thai if it's
close, there'll be headaches. That's when my
w.ork really starts!"
And start it will: close elections mean re
count of the ballots. If the early turnout pace
continues, there may be more than 4,000 bal
lots to recount. Word of graduate apathy was
contradicted yesterday about noon when a
solid phalanx of graduate men marched across
the library grass to vote at the central polling
place. Fricker is happy with the turnout, but
he's scratching his head over possible protest
of the count or the campaigns.
Tight class and Legislature election races are
being v/on and lost on the library grass loday,
and the principals in those races will be at the
Legislature tonight. It's the climax of a great
election, admirably well run by Fricker's Elec
tion Board and sparked in large measure by
the vigor of the presidential campaign, and the
story of that election v/ill be told tonight when
the Legislature meets at 7:30 p.m. in the Excom
room, Student Union.
