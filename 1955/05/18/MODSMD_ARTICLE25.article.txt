# FULL PROGRAM OF EVENTS
## Public Exercises Com Brings World to Farm 
### MARY ELLEN ROMNE 
In 1891, David Starr Jordan, j
first president of Stanford Uni-1
versity, said that Stanford
should "share fine special
ists on this campus and their l
knowledge with the commu- j
â– nity," arid so scheduled the first
Tuesday Evening Series lecture.
Today, 64 years later, the Com
mittee on Public Exercises handle.- j
a full program of events, bringing I
the outside world to campus, and I
vice-versa. And the Tuesday Eve- '
ning Series is still going strong.
The Committee is an administra- i
tive organ of the President's office,
and consists of 12 faculty members !
plus an executive secretary and her !
staff. Harold M. Bacon, professor of
mathematics, is chairman of the j
Committee this year.
PLANS VARIED f.VENTS
From the busy office of Mrs. Jean
Duncan White, the executive secre
tary, come the plans and adminis
tration of such events as the Thurs
day revival film series, Founders'
Day program, Commencement Ex
ercises, professional concerts, and
Tuesday Series.
The office also publishes the j
weekly University Calendar; sched
uies the use of Memorial and Cub- !
fcerley Auditoriums; approves and
schedules all University events open
to the public; sends out publicity on j
University events; and sponsors a j
Stanford speaker service for Penin- j
sula groups.
Planning for the events starts in
a monthly meeting of the Commit- i
tee. held the first Friday of each |
month. Specific programs are dele- 1
gated to sub-committees, which
then submit suggestions to Mrs. j
White.
TUESDAY SERIES
The actual arrangements for the
various groups and speakers arc
made by Mrs. White and her office,
and the complicated business of
scheduling is handled there.
For the Tuesday Evening Series. J
the weekly programs are planned to I
present a variety of speakers, com- I
bining both Stanford talent and j
guest speakers. Program ideas come j
from many sources. "The Committee j
welcomes student suggestions for \
the Series," Mrs. White emphasized.
"Some of our best programs have |
been planned that way."

Concerts are another major job
j for the Committee. At least one out
standing musical event is brought to
i the campus each quarter. The San
| Francisco Symphony concert and
t the New York Philharmonic Cham
ber Ensemble were the Committee's
j guest performers this quarter.
COMMENCEMENT
"Commencement and Baccalaure-
I ate are our biggest jobs, however,"
! said Mrs. White. Plans are now in

] full swing for this June's programs.
: Selecting top-rated speakers, plan
; ning an academic procession, and
: taking care of the innumerable de
! tails of such a production require
| months of preparation.
In its dual role of sharing Stan
ford's talent with tlje community
and bringing top-flight events to the
campus, the Committee on Public
| Exercises is an important liaison be
tween Stanford and the public.
