SUMER IS ICUMEN IN
Siimer is icumen in; ,
Lliude, sing cuccu!
Thus, as eveyy schoolboy knows, begins T. S. Eliot's immortal
Hiawatha. And no wonder "The Boy Orator of the Platte" (as
T. S. Eliot is commonly called) was moved to pen such light
hearted lines! For summer (or the "vernal equinox" as it is
frequently referred to) is the happiest season of the year, mild
and balmy and contented-making.
Which brings us, of course, to Philip Morris Cigarettes. They,
too, are mild and balmy and contented-making. But that is not
all. They are also genial, placid, and amiable. But that is still not
all. They are, moreover, smooth, pacific, and lenient. But hold!
There is more. They are, in addition, tranquillizing, clement, and
dulcet.
Indeed the list could go on and on, until every adjective is
exhausted that would describe the mildness of Philip Morris,
the subtlety of their blending, the delicacy of their flavor. What
more perfect companion could be found to a summer's day?
What more apt complement to a summer's night ?
If you have been pleased with Philip Morris through the win
ter and spring—as who has not who has a taste bud left in his
head?—you will find your pleasure compounded, your enjoyment
trebled, when you smoke Philip Morris in the warm and joyous
months before you.
M y own plans for the summer (except that I will smoke Philip
Morris through all my waking hours ) are still vague. 1 have been
invited to attend a writers conference, but 1 don't think I'll ac
cept. I've been attending writers conferences for years, and I
always have a perfectly rotten time. The trouble is that Alexan
dre Dumas and Harriet Beeeher Stowe are always there. Not
that 1 have anything against these two swell kids; it's just-that it
breaks my heart to see them. They're so in love—so terribly de
voted and so hopelessly! Dumas will never divorce Jane Eyre
while she is with Peary at the North Pole, and Miss Stowe has
long since despaired of getting her release from th® Pittsburgh
Pirates. So hand in hand, brave and forlorn, they go from writers
conference to writers conference while Dumas works on his mon
umental Stover at Yale.
No, thank you, I'll do without writers conferences this summer.
1 think instead I'll try to improve my fishing. As I/.aak Walton
once said, "No man is born an artist or an angler." 1 often turn
to the works of Walton (or "The Fordham Flash" as he is fa
miliarly called) when I am searching for a choice aphorism. In
fact, I told him so when we met some years ago at a writers
conference. Walton was accompanied, as always, by Henrik
Ibsen (or "The Pearl of the Pacific" as he is known as). They —
Ibsen ("The Pearl of the Pacific") and Walton ("The Fordham
Flash")—were collaborating on Mister Roberts at the time, but
they fell to quarreling and abandoned the project and the world,
as a consequence, was deprived of a truly robust and entertain
ing comedy.
It is not uncommon, I must say, for writers to fall into dispute.
They are, after all. a sensitive and high-strung lot. I'll never
forget what William Makepeace Thackeray (or "The Body" as he
was universally called) once said to me. "You show me a good
writer," said Thackeray, "and I'll steal his wife."
Well, as I was saying, I think I'll give writers conferences a
miss this summer, and I recommend that you do the same. Why
don't you just take it easy? Swim and fish and sail and smoke and
read and sleep and tan your lithe young limbs. I want the best
for you because-if I may get a little misty in this, my final
column of the year—l think you should know that it's been real
kicks for me, delivering this nonsense to you each week.
And in conclusion let me state what Jane Austen (or "Old
54-40 or Fight" as she is called the world over) once said to
me. "Nothing is so precious as friendship," she said, "and the
richest man in the world is the one with the most money."
