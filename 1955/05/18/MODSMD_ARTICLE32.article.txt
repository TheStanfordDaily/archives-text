Coach Bob Renker's varsity racketmen made a splendid team
effort to smash Modesto JC but the key man in the Card operation
wasn't clicking, so it was all for nothing as Stanford fell to ihe
visitors, 5-4.
Jack Frost, who only last week advanced to the finals of the

state championships without losing a
set, disappointed the crowd with his
worst playing of the year against
the U.S. and Australian juniors
champion Jerry Moss.
Moss, exhibiting startling speed
and excellent control, was complete
ly the master of the situation as he
squashed Frost, 6-1, 6-1. Frost was
badly off form in the brief exhibi
tion, revealing only in occasional
flashes a hint of the playing that is
responsible for his high national
ranking.
Moss' Davis Cup teammate, boy
ish Mike Green, didn't extend him
self at all as he trounced Ernie Du-
Bray, 6-1, 6-4, relying on his super

lative control with a variety of soft
shots.
Bob Prince had an excellent day
for the Indians. He overcame Mo
desto's tough Don Stinsaas, 6-3, 8-6,
in an even, well-played match.
