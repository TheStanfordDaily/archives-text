# Area GOP Seeks 300 New Members
## 
### 
This week the Young Republicans
of the Stanford Area are holding
their spring membership drive in an
attempt to boost membership from
200 to 500 members.
Membership is $1 for a year. The
prize for the Young Republican
procuring the most new members
will be the choice between a dinner
at L'Ommie's or a job at the 1956
convention in San Francisco.
