# RALPH SWEEPS ELECTION
## Record Turnout Gives New President 849 Vote Margin in ASSU Finals Fitzgerald Defeats Zarifes In Tight Vice-Presidency Race 
### 
George Ralph was swept into office as i955-'56 ASSU president yesterday, defeating Nathan
Leanse by an 849-vote margin in the ASSU final election.
Ralph polled more than 60 per cent of the vote, winning 2,389 to 1,540, as 3,993 students voted
yesterday and Tuesday, toppling all previous ASSU voting records. The record turnout comprised
60 per cent of the student body, breaking the 45.5 per cent all-time mark set in last year's final elec
tion when 3,132 voted.
In a closer race, Jerry Fitzgerald defeated Helen Zarifes for the associated student vice-presi
dency. Miss Fitzgerald polled 1,960 votes, her opponent, 1,851.
In the primaries last week Ralph, an off-campus student majoring in history, topped Leanse by a
bare 17 votes. Fifty-five per cent of the electorate voted in the primary for what was then a new high.
Commenting on the record turnout for the finals, Eric Fricker, Election Board chairman, said, "I
think we have set records which it will probably take 10 years to break."
The election interest which caused the heavy vote was stimulated by strenuous compaigning,
climaxed by a debate before an overflow crowd in Cubberley Auditorium Monday night.
In the debate Ralph spoke for the need of reform. He proposed that students should have
a right to vote on the NSA membership, he advocated combining many of the ASSU commit
tees into more centralized groups, he saw no need for the new Cabinet.
Leanse's platform was one of strengthening the student government from within, without reform-

ing it. He advocated "construction, <
not destruction" of student govern
ment.
CLASS BREAKDOWN
Breakdown by classes of the rec
ord turnout showed freshmen cast
the highest number of votes. Total
vote by the class of '58 was 1,017.
Other approximate figures were: j
juniors, 893; sophomores, 871; sen
iors, 6(52; and graduates, 550.
In giving his report to the ASSU j
Legislature last night, Fricker com- j
mented that the election as a whole
went smoothly, but recommended
clarification of the procedure to be
followed in the case of a student
who had lost his student body card. 1

TO THE VlCTORS—Winning ASSU vice-presidential candidate Jerry Fitzgerald, left, next year's

were cast.

A WINNER — George Ralph, new Mr. President, ASSU style,
turns on the victory glow after yesterday's ASSU final election.
The turnout which put Ralph in the presidency was an all-tuuc
mark for Stanford.
George Ralph was swept into office as i955-'56 ASSU president yesterday, defeating Nathan
Leanse by an 849-vote margin in the ASSU final election.
Ralph polled more than 60 per cent of the vote, winning 2,389 to 1,540, as 3,993 students voted
yesterday and Tuesday, toppling all previous ASSU voting records. The record turnout comprised
60 per cent of the student body, breaking the 45.5 per cent all-time mark set in last year's final elec
tion when 3,132 voted.
In a closer race, Jerry Fitzgerald defeated Helen Zarifes for the associated student vice-presi
dency. Miss Fitzgerald polled 1,960 votes, her opponent, 1,851.
In the primaries last week Ralph, an off-campus student majoring in history, topped Leanse by a
bare 17 votes. Fifty-five per cent of the electorate voted in the primary for what was then a new high.
Commenting on the record turnout for the finals, Eric Fricker, Election Board chairman, said, "I
think we have set records which it will probably take 10 years to break."
The election interest which caused the heavy vote was stimulated by strenuous compaigning,
climaxed by a debate before an overflow crowd in Cubberley Auditorium Monday night.
In the debate Ralph spoke for the need of reform. He proposed that students should have
a right to vote on the NSA membership, he advocated combining many of the ASSU commit
tees into more centralized groups, he saw no need for the new Cabinet.
Leanse's platform was one of strengthening the student government from within, without reform-

ing it. He advocated "construction, <
not destruction" of student govern
ment.
CLASS BREAKDOWN
Breakdown by classes of the rec
ord turnout showed freshmen cast
the highest number of votes. Total
vote by the class of '58 was 1,017.
