You've won an election. You're the next
president of the Associated Students of Stan
ford University. What now, George?
You ran, in a campaign which stimulated
student interest as never before and got a rec
ord turnout of voters in primary and final elec
tions, on a platform of reform the government.
Last week, you said "It seems to me that we
could dismiss a few officers and a few dozen
committees and never know the difference."
"No government is good government!" your
campaign posters said.
This week you said "It seems to me that the
recent trend in student opinion indicates a de
sire for a re-evaluation of student government
and a re vital;.nation of its various organs." And
the end of Monday night's debate, you said "If
i an; elected, I v/ould feel my election would be
<"■ mandate of the students to work on these re
forms."
You have been eicctod. You have a mandate.
/"• moi-.th ago, students dissatisfied with their
government gave a majority vote to a new Con
r..i!ution for ASSU. Here are a few things which
t!i..! Constitution says:

"The Legislature shall be the supreme policy
making body or this Association ... it shall
have jurisdiction over all student organizations,
including their creation and dissolution ... it
shall have the power to levy all fees and assess
ments of this Association ... it shall establish its
own rules of procedure . . . (it) shall have the
power ... to set up special committees . .
The president is "the chief executive officer"
of ASSU. He works for the Legislature and the
student body; the Legislature does not work
for hirn. The Cabinet does in a sense work for
the president, but you've come out strongly
against the Cabinet.
So unless the Legislature will go along with
your reforms, you'll be all by yourself, George.
You can't institute reforms by yourself. Nor
can you rewrite the constitution by yourself.
The student body voted you into office on a
wave of optimism over your campaign prom
ises. Can you mako good on those promises?
Without the continued support of the student
body'and its Legislature, you cannot.
What now, George?

government gave a majority vote to a new Con
r..i!ution for ASSU. Here are a few things which
t!i..! Constitution says:

"The Legislature shall be the supreme policy
making body or this Association ... it shall
have jurisdiction over all student organizations,
including their creation and dissolution ... it
shall have the power to levy all fees and assess
ments of this Association ... it shall establish its
own rules of procedure . . . (it) shall have the
power ... to set up special committees . .
The president is "the chief executive officer"
of ASSU. He works for the Legislature and the
student body; the Legislature does not work
for hirn. The Cabinet does in a sense work for
the president, but you've come out strongly
against the Cabinet.
So unless the Legislature will go along with
your reforms, you'll be all by yourself, George.
You can't institute reforms by yourself. Nor
can you rewrite the constitution by yourself.
The student body voted you into office on a
wave of optimism over your campaign prom
ises. Can you mako good on those promises?
Without the continued support of the student
body'and its Legislature, you cannot.
What now, George?
