### 
The most exciting Kenton band ever, played last Friday night
lor the interfraternity Dance. The band of 20, newly formed and
beginning a tour, is dazzling dancers, critics, and Kenton himself.
"Those guys!" Kenton told "Downbeat." "I slap an incredibly
complex arrangement down in front of them and they play ii right

off, no questions asked." The Surf
Club never sounded better.
The new band has all the power
of the old ones—with five trumpets,
five trombones, and five saxes, it
should —but none of the sloppiness.
The personnel includes no dead
wood and more talented soloists
than usual. But best of all, here is
a Kenton band that swings. Here's
why.
For years, Kenton's big failing has
been an over emphasis on heavy
handed experimentation. The band
didn't rock, and however much ex
citement there was in his "Progres
sive Jazz," there was seldom the ex
citement of driving rhythm. Now at
last he is using the Gerry Mulligan
arrangements in his book and com
missioning new ones of similar drive
from Dave van Kreidt, Bill Holman,
and Bill Russo.
This means that modern jazz is
being played by a group with more
power than any now in the field.
*It also means that Kenton's musi
cians have to be better than ever.
| There is no chance to get sloppy in
an up-beat jazz arrangement, much
less in a solo. There was too much
chance in "Progressive Jazz." With
the new band, all Kenton's music,
whether jazz, experimental, or bal
lad, sounds better.
To a jazz fan, one look at the
band showed why. In the sax sec
tion alone sat four famous musi
cians: playing tenor, Dave van
Kreidt, of the original Dave Bru
beck Octet and student of Darius
Milhaud; likewise, Bill Perkins, the
leading soloist with Shorty Rogers
in the jazz background to "The
Wild One and featured soloist on
the RCA Ip of the same name.
Playing alto sax in the style of
Lee Konnitz, Lennie Niehaus took
many solos. He is well known for
three contemporary lp's with his
own octet. .
In contrast to his cool style, the
l other alto soloist was Charlie Ma-
I riano, chief heir of the Charlie Par

♦
! ker tradition in alto saxery, and a
famous name from some of his own
lp's.
In the trumpet section sat Stu
Williamson, who got his fame at
Howard Rumsey's Lighthouse and
in numerous L.A. recording ses
sions. His solos were among the
most facile I have heard from a
Kenton trumpet. On bass, little Max
Bennet, long with the Sauter-Fin
egan band, was another familiar
face.
The unfamiliar faces produced
some good solos too. Gus Chappell
on trombone was featured a lot, but
more exciting was Eob Fitzpatrick,
who has the power, speed, and blare
that made Milt Bernhart and Frank
Rosolino famous in earlier Kenton
bands. Mel Lewis on drums had
some of the subtlety that Shelley
Manus and Stan Levy developed in
the same chair.
And the new vocalist, Ann Rich
ards, sings in the pleasantly
straightforward style of Lucy Ann
Polk, with an occasional moment
like Ella Fitzgerald and a clearer
voice than most Kenton thrushes.
And, of course, the lanky Kenton,
who has come to symbolize his bold
music, charmed and fascinated the
dancers who came close enough to
talk to him. He knows he has start
ed a new "era" with a band that
is not only fun to listen to but is
fun to dance to.
In Redwood City tomorrow, the
Peninsula Symphony Orchestra,
Aaron Sten, conductor, will give a
concert in the high school audito
rium at 8:30 p.m. with David Abel,
guest violinist: Beethoven's "First
Symphony,"' Tschaikovsky's "Rome:)
and Juliet Overture," Mozart's "A
Major Violin Concerto." and "Cau
casian Sketches" constitute the pro
gram.
And this Sunday, Herbert B. Nan
ney will give an organ recital at the
Memorial Church at 4 p.m.

! ker tradition in alto saxery, and a
famous name from some of his own
lp's.
In the trumpet section sat Stu
Williamson, who got his fame at
Howard Rumsey's Lighthouse and
in numerous L.A. recording ses
sions. His solos were among the
most facile I have heard from a
Kenton trumpet. On bass, little Max
Bennet, long with the Sauter-Fin
egan band, was another familiar
face.
The unfamiliar faces produced
some good solos too. Gus Chappell
on trombone was featured a lot, but
more exciting was Eob Fitzpatrick,
who has the power, speed, and blare
that made Milt Bernhart and Frank
Rosolino famous in earlier Kenton
bands. Mel Lewis on drums had
some of the subtlety that Shelley
Manus and Stan Levy developed in
the same chair.
And the new vocalist, Ann Rich
ards, sings in the pleasantly
straightforward style of Lucy Ann
Polk, with an occasional moment
like Ella Fitzgerald and a clearer
voice than most Kenton thrushes.
And, of course, the lanky Kenton,
who has come to symbolize his bold
music, charmed and fascinated the
dancers who came close enough to
talk to him. He knows he has start
ed a new "era" with a band that
is not only fun to listen to but is
fun to dance to.
In Redwood City tomorrow, the
Peninsula Symphony Orchestra,
Aaron Sten, conductor, will give a
concert in the high school audito

The most exciting Kenton band ever, played last Friday night
lor the interfraternity Dance. The band of 20, newly formed and
beginning a tour, is dazzling dancers, critics, and Kenton himself.
"Those guys!" Kenton told "Downbeat." "I slap an incredibly
complex arrangement down in front of them and they play ii right

off, no questions asked." The Surf
Club never sounded better.
The new band has all the power
of the old ones—with five trumpets,
five trombones, and five saxes, it
should —but none of the sloppiness.
The personnel includes no dead
wood and more talented soloists
than usual. But best of all, here is
a Kenton band that swings. Here's
why.
For years, Kenton's big failing has
been an over emphasis on heavy
handed experimentation. The band
didn't rock, and however much ex
citement there was in his "Progres
sive Jazz," there was seldom the ex
citement of driving rhythm. Now at
last he is using the Gerry Mulligan
arrangements in his book and com
missioning new ones of similar drive
from Dave van Kreidt, Bill Holman,
and Bill Russo.
This means that modern jazz is
being played by a group with more
power than any now in the field.
*It also means that Kenton's musi
cians have to be better than ever.
| There is no chance to get sloppy in
an up-beat jazz arrangement, much
less in a solo. There was too much
chance in "Progressive Jazz." With
the new band, all Kenton's music,
whether jazz, experimental, or bal
lad, sounds better.
To a jazz fan, one look at the
band showed why. In the sax sec
tion alone sat four famous musi
cians: playing tenor, Dave van
Kreidt, of the original Dave Bru
beck Octet and student of Darius
Milhaud; likewise, Bill Perkins, the
leading soloist with Shorty Rogers
in the jazz background to "The
Wild One and featured soloist on
the RCA Ip of the same name.
Playing alto sax in the style of
Lee Konnitz, Lennie Niehaus took
