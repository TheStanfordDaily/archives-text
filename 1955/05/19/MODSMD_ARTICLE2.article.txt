## Ralph Says His Victory Is Mandate for Reform 
### BILL WRIGHT 
George Ralph, the newly elec
ted president of the ASSU, said
last night he considers his 849- j
vote victory a mandate for the
reforms he proposed in his cam
paign.
"But the 'how'," Ralph said, "is

something I couldn't quite say at
this time."
"The indication is that some of the
reforms which I suggested should be
put through," Ralph said. "But it
will take a good deal of investiga
tion. And anything that is done has
to be done with the Legislature."
Ralph hoped that any changes
which he would propose next year
would be in such a form and value

. that the Legislature would not be
iopposed.
Asked if much of his vote was
from people who are apathetic to-
I ward student government. Ralph
replied that the really apathetic
didn't vote at all. He felt that he
got a good vote from the graduate
class and "some of those who were
i apathetic or felt they weren't af
fected by student government" until
j now.
"I think most of my supporters
were sincerely for the reforms I
proposed," he continued. "And I
think I'll have support (next year)
from those who supported me in
the election."
"I don't think it was a 'goof-off'
vote —to use the term," Ralph add
ed. "If there was any indication of
a joke at the start of.my campaign,
I don't think there is now. The in
ference was not that they elected a
personality, but a platform."
Ralph said he was still thinking
: about whom he would appoint as
executive assistant to the president,
! a new post created by the constitu
tion. He didn't know when the ap
pointment would be announced or
how the selection would be made.
