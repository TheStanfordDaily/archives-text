# SRI Will Build Nuclear Reactor
## 
### 
Stanford Research Institute has
completed a preliminary design and
cost study for a versatile test nu
clear reactor, planned for installa
tion somewhere in California.
The reactor's design permits si
multaneous conduct of a large num
ber of industrial projects with due
regard for commercial secrecy when
required.
Three industrial nuclear engi
neering organizations participated in
the preliminary study, according to
SRI nuclear engineering head Dr.
Edwin L. Zebroski.
Dr. Zebroski said the study
"shows encouragingly moderate
cost for a 10,000 - kilowatt reactor
having fluxes comparable to the
Atomic Energy Commission's mate
rial-testing reactor."
He explained that both light and
heavy water designs were consid
ered for a versatile installation, use
ful for a wide range of research in
| the fields of physics, chemistry, met
| allurgy, medicine, food, and agricul
j ture.
Production of radio-isotopes for
| high - intensity radiation sources
would also be possible.
