The varsity and freshman track teams and the many Stanford track fans
will he losing a good friend this spring. Ray Dean, who has coached the
irosh cinder squads and has assisted Jack Weiershauser in tutoring the
varsity, will not return to the farm next year. A shake-up in the Athletic-
Department has resulted in doing away with the position of assistant track
mentor in favor of graduate coaching.
To the casual passing fan who attends some of the Indian meets each
spring, Ray is just another coach. But to the Tribe thinclads, the sports-

writers, and anyone else who happens
to have a close association with
Stanford track, he is a good friend.
Ray can always be seen with a
hand on the shoulder of one of "his
boys" either offering him encourage
ment or congratulating him. And
the genial coach will always go out
of his way to provide the informa
tion needed by the sportswriters, or
to talk about his team and their
prospects for next year. .
But the most important asset re
quired in being a track mentor is
to bring results. This spring, Ray's
fresh man thinclads went through
their entire schedule only dropping
one meet —to City College of San
Francisco, the northern California
JC champion. Among their victims
were the highly-touted yearlings
from California. After this meet,
which was their last, the Papoose
trackmen paid fitting tribute to Ray
by carrying him off the field on their

TRACK TALK —The Tribe cindermen have been doing alright for them
selves on the track this season, according to the National Collegiate track
and field statistics as of May 10. Bernie Nelson and Jim Luttrell ranked
sixth and eighth in the country in the high and low hurdles respectively.
Walt Garrett had recorded the fastest college clocking in the 440-yard
dash.
Sprint man Keith Brownsberger was rated fourth in the 220 and tied
for tenth in the 100. Chuck Strong is number twelve on the list of two
milers. In the field events, the javelin-throwing Indians rank first, fourth,
;;nd twelfth, thanks to the efforts of Bob Kimball, John Bugge, and Hank
Roldan. Frank Herrmann has the ninth best broad jump in the nation to
place in that event.
On paper, these records would give Stanford about 30 points in the
NCAA meet, if the statistics were based on that meet. 30 markers has
Leen good for either second or third place in the meet in past.years. Come
the big meet which will be held in« Los Angeles June 17 and 18, a good
showing might give coach Weiershauser those 30 points—or maybe more.
For those track fans planning to stay in the Bay Area for a while after
school is out: a whizzer of cinder meet will be held in Berkeley on June
21. The Big Ten and the PCC will resume their old feud at Edwards Stad
ium in what should be a top show. The midwesterners will be featuring
such stars as Jim Golliday, the:09.3 sprinter from Northwestern, while
the coasters have USC—'nuff said.

INTERESTING ANECDOTES: Oh, for the good old days. Ty Cobb,
alias the Georgia Peach, alias one of baseball's all time greats, was in the
stands at Saturday's Stanford-Southern California baseball tilt. After sit
ting through the first three hours of the doubleheader. he got up. shook
his head, and said, "They don't play baseball any more." Whereupon he
left. Seems that a recent magazine article quoted Cobb as saying the same
thing.
The USC horsehiders, whose bench was much calmer this year in con
trast to former seasons, did come up with one comment (directed to the
Tribe): "Why don't you guys use bats instead of sliderules?" At this
point, the Cards had been able to register but one run.
