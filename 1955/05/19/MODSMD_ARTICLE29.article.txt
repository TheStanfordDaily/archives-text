quest of their sixth straight PCC championship. According to
coach Tom Haynie, the Cards should have "little trouble" in ac
quiring this, their eighth championship since 1946.

whipped 52-27, and Cal, who lost to
the Cards twice—s7-22 and 59-24.

Osborne in their first meeting and
then was beaten and tied by the
Stanford star in their second meet
ing. In last year's meet, Osborne set
no less than 12 records.
Heim is a heavy favorite to win
his best event, the 150-yard individ
ual medley, in which the swimmer
swims 50 yards breaststroke, 50
yards backstroke, and 50 yards free
style. Heim broke the PCC record
in this event twice during the dual
