Knee-High
Nylons
$1 a pair
A summer's delight . . . knee
high nylons. Wonderfully cool
and comfortable, wonderfully
low priced! No worries about
them staying in place because
they have a non-bind clastic that
anchors them securely. Fash
ioned with thin pencil seams in
sheer spring and summer shades.
60 gauge. I 5 denier, 8 V\ to 11.
