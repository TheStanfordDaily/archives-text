living groups lend their vocal endeavors to the 1955 Spring Sing.
Participating groups will offer selections ranging all the way
from Negro spirituals to hit Eroadway tunes, in competition for

the coveted Sweepstakes trophy.

] Sweepstakes with a cleverly ar
ranged medley of radio commer

vious year their Opus No. 1 by the
same name was also a sweepstakes
winner.

! the 1954 Sing went to Encina and
Roble respecticely. This year the
j Encina men will be offering "This
Ol' House," while the Roble lassie;
; will present "Summertime."
The Stanford Med School, peren-
I'nial winner in the Sing, will at
j tempt to repeat their prize-winning
j performance of last year in which
I they combined with the Nursing

This year, in addition to the
I Sweepstakes award, trophies will be
given to the best entry in each of
three divisions—under 40, between
40 and 80, and over 80.
Although the performance itself
will not get under way until 7:30,
all participants are asked to be in
Frost by 6:30. Sing chairman Don
Crowell stresses the fact that time
restrictions for each group will be
strictly enforced. There is a four
minute time limit for all groups

end until the last person is off the
■ stage.
