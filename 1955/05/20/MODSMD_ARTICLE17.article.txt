# 'Rake' Called Major Opera By UC Prof
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
Igor Stravinsky's "The Rake's
Progress" is "perhaps the major
opera of the century, certainly
the best opera ever written in
this language," said Professor
Joseph Kerman of the University
of California in a speech here
recently.
Local theater-goers will have a
i chance to judge for themselves May
; 26-28 when the work gets its West
! Coast premiere in a production by
the Stanford Players and Depart
ment of Music.
Although W. H. Auden's libretto
was inspired by Hogarth's 18th cen
tury paintings, the plight of Tom
Rakewell is the plight of modern
man. Pushed by circumstances,
shrinking from reality and yet
afraid of temptation, he feels in
complete but does not know what
he wants.
In the course of the opera Tom
makes three wishes, all of which are
designed to lead him away from
Anne, his true love and his true des
tiny, all of which are granted in
stantly by Nick Shadow, the devil.
And each in turn is shown to be lu
dicrous and empty.
WISHES GRANTED
First he yearns for money. But
j soon, at Mother Goose's brothel in
j London, he is disillusioned with
j pleasure.
Next he wants happiness. This,
Nick Shadow tells him, he can
achieve only by refusing to be gov
erned either by reason or by his
senses: only then will he be a free
man. Tom resolves to marry Baba,
the bearded woman.
Far from being a liberating influ
ence, however, Baba turns out to be
exceedingly talkative. Tom sees the
futility of his second wish.
Having gotten rid of Baba, he
wishes next for salvation through
good works. Nick Shadow oblig
j ingly produces a machine that turns
I rocks to bread. Soon, though, Tom
is bankrupt and disillusioned again.
ACT OF FAITH
Only when, in a crucial act of
i faith, he wishes for Anne, his true
! reality, is he freed from the devil's
J power.
Enraged. Nick Shadow strikes him
| mad. But Tom has come to recog
nize himself.. In the final scene, in
Bedlam, he is represented as at least
half-redeemed. His madness may be
I hell, but he remains on earth, re
| united with Anne.
