what now, daily?'
To the Editor:
Yesterday The Daily immortalized itself in bad
taste. To criticize publicly the incoming ASSU Presi
dent is both morally wrong and intellectually un
f.ound.
1 say critic ize because under no circumstances could
yesterday's editorial be called unbiased. Indeed, the
whole campaign coveiage was somewhat less than
impartial. The moral wrongness is apparent: Stan
ford University profits not one whit from such an
open attack o«i the policies of the President-elect.
Likewise manifest is the intellectual error. If the
Daily's opposition to George is'genuine (and it was),
the surest way to endear him to the hearts of the
electorate is to show marked partiality again:! him.
Hereafter, when Mr. Man field writes why not title
hi:; column "The Squirrel Cage."
PHILIP OLSON
T<. ihe Editor:
Your candidate for ASSU president has been de
feated. Instead, a man with imagination, a man with
a critical eye has been elected in a landslide. What
now, Daily?
You slanted your news stories and headlines against
the man wh6 was elected by almost two-thirds of
the voters. You said he was opposed to a platform
of increased student interest. (We did not.—Ed).
What now, Daily?
You have always been in favor of cooperation and
good feelings between various segments of student
government. You have always stood for the con
strue tive outlook. Will you now make yourself the
dissenter, the destructive influence to the man whom
an overwhelming majority of the students swept into
office?
For the first time in recent Stanford history a vast,
intense bloc of students have interested themselves in
the mo-.t intricate workings of their own govern
ment. Through the person of the winning candidate
they have shown an ardent desire to question various
phases of student government at Stanford, to cut
away the dead wood, remove the hollow men, and
instill, maybe for a long time to come, an individual
istic, pulsating version of student activities.
Are you going to help out, or was the old system
more to your comfort? What now, Daily?
DON C. WINSTON
To the Editor:
The Daily's "political editorial" of yesterday plumbs
a new depth of unfairness and immature bitterness.
When are you going to grow up enough to know
that any person (ASSU president-elector no) is en
titled to a fair chance to produce before receiving
your daf°ers in his back!
CHUCK MAHLER
ROBERT GILMAN
To the Editor:
The Daily's editorial, "What now, George?" on the
day following the student body election seems (like
so many other Daily editorials) to have missed the
point.
Its harping tone and negative approach is typical
of the childish attitude which has been taken toward
our newly-elected President—a President going into
office with more popular support than any ASSU
President since I have attended Stanford.
Some facts which it ignoies:
1) The student body of Stanford is the sovereign
in our consideration —not the Constitution and not
the legislature. These exist to reflect its will, to get
things done.
2) Far fewer students cared about the Constitu
tion which consumed so much time and caused so
much hot air over nothing this year than about elect
ing a President whom they thought would help them
find their way out of the jungle of red tape, com
mitteeism and general baloney which surrounds their
student body government.
3) The burden of proof lies not with George Ralph
but with the committees and procedures of the ASSU
which must now, and this is a good thing, prove their
worth.
I am an ASSU "bureaucrat" having served on many
boards and committees and would be the first to
maintain that a hard-working, intelligent and level
headed ASSU can provide real student leadership
where and when it is needed. But haggling over petty
appropriations, spending months trying to get our
Constitution in line with that of the political scien
tists' "perfect union" and general wasting time and
getting nothing done—this is not good student gov
ernment and it deserves the protest which it has
received.
We ought to be glad that this election has happened
and that one student had the nerve and the fight to
buck all that we dislike. A,student body as intelli
gent as Stanford's deserves a vital, compact govern
ment and with the honest and generous help of the
Daily and our out-going officers perhaps George
Ralph can accomplish something.
We owe him our thanks and our support.
JACK FRASER
To the Editor:
You've written an editorial. You're the present
editor of the Stanford Daily. What now, Dickie?
In the first place, the bulk of your editorial was
a restatement of facts which have been hashed over
throughout the entire presidential campaign. There
is nothing original but your bitter tone.
Next, we criticize your poor sportsmanship.
Throughout the past two weeks the Daily has shown
its bias by its silence on events which had the whole
campus talking. George Ralph's campaign was ad
mittedly sensational, and he has justified this sen
sationalism to the satisfaction of 2,389 voters. Never
theless, the events of his campaign were news. It was
your duty to record them objectively, but you de
liberately maintained silence, apparently in order
to kill the effect for which he was striving. The
campaign is over now, Dickie, and your bias has
culminated in Thursday's display of poor sportsman
ship.
The Daily exists for the benefit of the students,
and not as a grindstone for the editor's political
axes. You have a right to your opinion, but it
should be expressed in the letters section, rather
than in an unsigned editorial. You seem to think
the Legislature will not accept the new president's
proposed reforms. Remember, the Legislature also
exists for the benefit of the students. You say Ralph
stands alone, Dickie? Not according to 2,389 voters.
We think it's time for you to grow up and become
a big boy now. We're curious to see how you'll
answer this and other letters about your editorial.
What now, Dickie?

ARTHUR BOSWORTH

To the Editor:
In your article entitled "What now, George?" in
the May l£th Daily, you made a statement attacking
by innuendo the validity of George Ralph's "man
date" to attack the new ASSU constitution. You said
further that, "A month ago, students dissatisfied with
their government gave a majority vote to a new
Constitution for ASSU."
These so called "dissatisfied students" were able to
muster up a stampeding herd of 1,200 students to
storm the polls and push through their constitution.
Apparently a large segment of the student body at the
time just didn't care. Despite repeated attempts by
the Daily to bring the constitution to the eyes pf
everyone, very few seemed to read it and fewer yet
actually studied it. George Ralph apparently leads a
group of almost 2,400 students who. dissatisfied with
the 1,200 who voted in the constitution, have voted
in George Ralph to change that constitution.
Albeit that there are many things of to be
said about the new constitution, there are many
things about it which will, I believe, if allowed to
fester unattended, drive student government down
into a mire of eomniitteekin, duplication and use
less work. Although things can be said for a con
stitution modeled on pretty political theories, one that
will work faster, smoother, and with less demand on
students' time has been requested by 2,400 students.
You went on 10 say in your article that "unless
the Legislature will go along with your reforms you'll
be all by yourself, George." Impossible as it is to
attack this statement on its face, I cannot envision
a Legislature representing the Stanford students, in
the face of George's huge .vote, turning a deaf ear to
the voice of the student body.
As to the Daily, instead of trying to point out the
futility of George's task or the evils of any change,
you, as the only published voice of the student body,
should back George to the hilt, or at least to 00
per cent of hilt. Opposition for opposition's sake never
helped government run smoothly or efficiently; it
never helped get anything done.
DICK MALTZMAN
To the Editor:
On Tuesday and Wednesday a record number of
Stanford students went to the polls and elected their
student body president by a convincing majority. On
Thursday the Daily printed an editorial concerning
the results of this election.
Members of the Daily staff (Daily editorial policy
is determined by the editorial board, not the start'
at large.—Ed) may not be in agreement with the ma
jority of the student body, ncr 'with the platform of
the new president. They have every right to their
opinions, but common .sense should restrain them
from printing .such an editorial as appeared Thurs
day. It is neither good policy for a campus news
paper, nor good publicity for Stanford. If this edi
torial policy is to continue throughout the coming
year, if the Daily is going to oppose whatever the
new president wants to do, and set up its own little
oligarchy, it may do so, but it will lose the favor and
respect of many people.
We have a new president, elected by 2,1389 people.
Let's back him up and help make his year successful,
not try to run him into the ground at the first turn.
POLLY McDONALD
To the Editor:
What Now, George? In your editorial you point out
that George can't put his reforms into effect without
the assistance of the Legislature. Theoretically, at
least, we adopt the notion in this country that our
governing body, the Legislature, puts into effect the
will of the majority. If we assume therefore that
George was elected by a majority of the student body
who desired reform in student government, then
doesn't it follow that the Legislature, reflecting the
views of the majority of the students, should and must
go along with George?
Practically, you could make an argument that Leg
islatures often don't echo the sentiments of the ma
jority they represent; but query whether this is the
practice which Legislatures should follow, and query
whether Legislatures consistently disregard the will
of their constituents.
If the student Legislature at Stanford does, as you
suggest, what it wills, then student government is run
by a bunch of despots, and it is high time for reform.
BILL FERNANDEZ
To the Editor:
Well, as the dust settles over the election field and
the outcome is decided, the valiant Stanford Daily
moves into action. During the entire campaign, our
newspaper brought out no editorial throwing its sup
port to one candidate. This would seem to indicate
an impartial and aloof stand on the election, for opin
ion in a newspaper belongs in a place where it can be
recognized as opinion—in the editorial column. How
ever, while thus maintaining an appearance of neu
trality, the Daily sought to insert its opinions else
where—in "reporting" the facts. Such an article as
the "condensation" of the Ralph-Leanse debate can
only be termed yellow journalism.
We have no objection to the Daily expressing its
views—through the proper channels. We do object to
distortion of the facts and misquoting or half-quoting
to misrepresent.
Nor do we object to the Daily expressing its views at
the proper time. But we cannot condone its ill-timed
attack of May 1!) on a settled issue. Especially when
the attack ignores certain facts.
1) George Ralph ran in opposition to the Con
stitution and its defender. He was elected by a ma
jority of the students in a record-breaking turnout.
No, he cannot "rewrite the Constitution by himself,"
but student interest in revision is certainly indicated
by his election.
2) "You cannot institute reform by yourself,
George." Nor can any reform candidate who is elect
ed. But, by virtue of the majority support behind
him, he can certainly attempt it.
3) "Unless the Legislature will go along with your
reforms, you'll be all by yourself." Reforms must
come from a law-making body, but isn't any law
making body responsible to the voters who gave it
authority? If the representatives in the Legislature
have any concern for the wishes of ihe constituents,
Ralph's reforms must be investigated.
What! Now? Daily. The Daily is now questioning
Ralph's ability to carry through his program. It is
implicating that support will be lacking to him. It is,
in fact, denying its support to him. Isn't it a bit late,
Daily? Is it time to create obstacles to the will of the
majority, or is it time to foster co-operation?
What now. Daily? A professional approach to the
situation, or a whining post-mortem?
What now, Daily.' A positive or a negative approach
to the new administration?

LET'S GET ON THE BALL, GEORGE
For crying out loud, George, haven't you done any
thing yet! Man, don't you realize you've got a man
date for reform? Well, what's the matter? You won,
didn't you? This morning, I looked around, and man.
you haven't changed one damn thing.
By the way, can you make it legal to ride roller
skates on Inner Quad? And, hey. Can we elimi
nate the Department of Athletics? No, 1 rcaily mean
it. 1 really do. I didn't make the varsity last year,
see, and I'm really teed-off.
Well, anyway, I'm just one of those 2,!iH9 who dur
ing some inexplicable neurotic upsurge latched your
square. Hey, that was pretty funny: "scratched your
square."
Anyhow, it sure was a ball, wasn't it? But now
you're all alone. I'll bet you think I'm kidding, Lut
I'm not. I didn't think so either until 1 read the Daily
this morning. I can read. I rcaily can. Did you read
that article by Richard William Randolph? He says
you're alone, and boy, if he says you're alone, man,
you're all alone. I mean you've got me and 2,388
others for sure but you ain't got Richard William
Randolph and without him you're nowhere, man. For
I am the editor, the campus mind-molder. And if
you can't get my support, mandate or no mandate,
you're wiped out, you mangy radical.
Can we burn the Daily Shack. George? Can we?
Please say yes. Or just nod. Well, anyway, there
had better be some noise around here by Monday,
because we guys ale really getting bored. If you
haven't shaped this place up by then, you may find
yourself running for Senator.
MICHAEL G. AGATE
To the Editor:
Your editorial in yesterday's Daily was a disgrace.
Without knowing all the facts concerning George
Ralph, you went ahead and attacked our new ASSU
president. All through the campaign and especially
after the debate Monday night, it was apparent that
the "objective" Daily was pulling for Leanse. Your
story and "quotation" coverage were stilted in favor
of anyone but Ralph.
I have been at this university for five years and
have keenly followed all the ASSU elections—all were
covered fairly by your newspaper. Why then was

the campaign coverage of George Ralph stilted?
You also mentioned in your editorial that the
". . . students dissatisfied with their government gave
a majority vote to a new Constitution . , However,
you forgot to add that less than one-third of the
student body voted in that election.
It appears to me that George Ralph really and truly
received a mandate from the students. The student
body will support George's reforms, and for the first
time in at least a decade will pay some attention to
student government.
Instead ol attacking George Ralph, it would have
been more intelligent if you had joined with the rest
ol the student body in wishing him success in in
stituting reforms.
RICHARD J. MEYER
To the Editor:
Your complete lack of sportsmanship and good
taste in writing the editorial on the school election
deserves a few comments.
No doubt you are entitled to your views as to who
was the more desirable candidate, but this is entirely
beside the point. Even in national elections, where
the things at stake are just a little more significant
than in our recent contest, it has always been con
sidered the proper thing to do to congratulate the*
winner, as you have always done in the past. Since
you did not desire to adopt this course of conduct,
you might have shown the restraint of not saying
anything.
Much more important is your opinion that the con
stitution which you so ardently espoused will pre
vent Mr. George from attaining any reform which
the majority of students seem to desire. If this is
true, it doesn't appear to be quite the monument
r.f representative student government that you claim
it to be!
Finally, I've always been disgusted by your smug
superiority complex about the fundamental standard.
It is beyond question a very fine code of life. Per
haps a closer reading of it rather than the constant
patting ourselves on the back can bring the editorials
back to the accepted minimum of decency.

Stanford Daily editorial policy is formulated by
members of the editorial hoard (Editor, Managing
Editor, StalY Editor, and Associates), not by the staff
at large. The bylaws of the ASSU Constitution state
that "the Editor shall have entire control of the

Please say yes. Or just nod. Well, anyway, there
had better be some noise around here by Monday,
because we guys ale really getting bored. If you
haven't shaped this place up by then, you may find
yourself running for Senator.
MICHAEL G. AGATE
To the Editor:
Your editorial in yesterday's Daily was a disgrace.
Without knowing all the facts concerning George
Ralph, you went ahead and attacked our new ASSU
president. All through the campaign and especially
after the debate Monday night, it was apparent that
the "objective" Daily was pulling for Leanse. Your
story and "quotation" coverage were stilted in favor
of anyone but Ralph.
I have been at this university for five years and
have keenly followed all the ASSU elections—all were
covered fairly by your newspaper. Why then was

the campaign coverage of George Ralph stilted?
You also mentioned in your editorial that the
". . . students dissatisfied with their government gave
a majority vote to a new Constitution . , However,
you forgot to add that less than one-third of the
student body voted in that election.
It appears to me that George Ralph really and truly
received a mandate from the students. The student
body will support George's reforms, and for the first
time in at least a decade will pay some attention to
student government.
Instead ol attacking George Ralph, it would have
been more intelligent if you had joined with the rest
ol the student body in wishing him success in in
stituting reforms.
RICHARD J. MEYER
To the Editor:
Your complete lack of sportsmanship and good
taste in writing the editorial on the school election
deserves a few comments.
No doubt you are entitled to your views as to who
was the more desirable candidate, but this is entirely
beside the point. Even in national elections, where
the things at stake are just a little more significant
than in our recent contest, it has always been con
sidered the proper thing to do to congratulate the*
winner, as you have always done in the past. Since
you did not desire to adopt this course of conduct,
you might have shown the restraint of not saying
anything.
Much more important is your opinion that the con
stitution which you so ardently espoused will pre
vent Mr. George from attaining any reform which
the majority of students seem to desire. If this is
true, it doesn't appear to be quite the monument
r.f representative student government that you claim
it to be!
Finally, I've always been disgusted by your smug
superiority complex about the fundamental standard.
It is beyond question a very fine code of life. Per
haps a closer reading of it rather than the constant
patting ourselves on the back can bring the editorials
back to the accepted minimum of decency.

To the Editor:
Yesterday The Daily immortalized itself in bad
taste. To criticize publicly the incoming ASSU Presi
dent is both morally wrong and intellectually un
f.ound.
1 say critic ize because under no circumstances could
yesterday's editorial be called unbiased. Indeed, the
whole campaign coveiage was somewhat less than
impartial. The moral wrongness is apparent: Stan
ford University profits not one whit from such an
open attack o«i the policies of the President-elect.
Likewise manifest is the intellectual error. If the

the surest way to endear him to the hearts of the
electorate is to show marked partiality again:! him.

PHILIP OLSON
T<. ihe Editor:
Your candidate for ASSU president has been de
feated. Instead, a man with imagination, a man with
a critical eye has been elected in a landslide. What
now, Daily?
You slanted your news stories and headlines against
the man wh6 was elected by almost two-thirds of
the voters. You said he was opposed to a platform
of increased student interest. (We did not.—Ed).
What now, Daily?
You have always been in favor of cooperation and
good feelings between various segments of student
government. You have always stood for the con
strue tive outlook. Will you now make yourself the
dissenter, the destructive influence to the man whom
an overwhelming majority of the students swept into
office?
For the first time in recent Stanford history a vast,
intense bloc of students have interested themselves in
the mo-.t intricate workings of their own govern
ment. Through the person of the winning candidate
they have shown an ardent desire to question various
phases of student government at Stanford, to cut
away the dead wood, remove the hollow men, and
instill, maybe for a long time to come, an individual
istic, pulsating version of student activities.
Are you going to help out, or was the old system
more to your comfort? What now, Daily?
DON C. WINSTON
To the Editor:
The Daily's "political editorial" of yesterday plumbs

CHUCK MAHLER
ROBERT GILMAN
To the Editor:
The Daily's editorial, "What now, George?" on the
day following the student body election seems (like
so many other Daily editorials) to have missed the
point.
Its harping tone and negative approach is typical
of the childish attitude which has been taken toward
our newly-elected President—a President going into
office with more popular support than any ASSU
President since I have attended Stanford.
Some facts which it ignoies:
1) The student body of Stanford is the sovereign
in our consideration —not the Constitution and not
the legislature. These exist to reflect its will, to get
things done.
2) Far fewer students cared about the Constitu
tion which consumed so much time and caused so
much hot air over nothing this year than about elect
ing a President whom they thought would help them
find their way out of the jungle of red tape, com
mitteeism and general baloney which surrounds their
student body government.
3) The burden of proof lies not with George Ralph
but with the committees and procedures of the ASSU
which must now, and this is a good thing, prove their
worth.
I am an ASSU "bureaucrat" having served on many
boards and committees and would be the first to
maintain that a hard-working, intelligent and level
headed ASSU can provide real student leadership
where and when it is needed. But haggling over petty
appropriations, spending months trying to get our
Constitution in line with that of the political scien
tists' "perfect union" and general wasting time and
getting nothing done—this is not good student gov
ernment and it deserves the protest which it has
received.
We ought to be glad that this election has happened
and that one student had the nerve and the fight to
buck all that we dislike. A,student body as intelli
gent as Stanford's deserves a vital, compact govern
ment and with the honest and generous help of the
Daily and our out-going officers perhaps George
Ralph can accomplish something.
We owe him our thanks and our support.
JACK FRASER
To the Editor:
You've written an editorial. You're the present
editor of the Stanford Daily. What now, Dickie?
In the first place, the bulk of your editorial was
a restatement of facts which have been hashed over
throughout the entire presidential campaign. There
is nothing original but your bitter tone.
Next, we criticize your poor sportsmanship.
Throughout the past two weeks the Daily has shown
its bias by its silence on events which had the whole
campus talking. George Ralph's campaign was ad
mittedly sensational, and he has justified this sen
sationalism to the satisfaction of 2,389 voters. Never
theless, the events of his campaign were news. It was
your duty to record them objectively, but you de
liberately maintained silence, apparently in order
to kill the effect for which he was striving. The
campaign is over now, Dickie, and your bias has
culminated in Thursday's display of poor sportsman
ship.
The Daily exists for the benefit of the students,
and not as a grindstone for the editor's political
axes. You have a right to your opinion, but it
should be expressed in the letters section, rather
than in an unsigned editorial. You seem to think
the Legislature will not accept the new president's
proposed reforms. Remember, the Legislature also
exists for the benefit of the students. You say Ralph
stands alone, Dickie? Not according to 2,389 voters.
We think it's time for you to grow up and become
a big boy now. We're curious to see how you'll
answer this and other letters about your editorial.
What now, Dickie?
PATRICK MADDEN GUS BLAISDBLL
KEVIN CASSEDY ROWENA PHILLIPS

ARTHUR BOSWORTH

To the Editor:
In your article entitled "What now, George?" in
the May l£th Daily, you made a statement attacking
by innuendo the validity of George Ralph's "man
date" to attack the new ASSU constitution. You said
further that, "A month ago, students dissatisfied with
their government gave a majority vote to a new
Constitution for ASSU."
These so called "dissatisfied students" were able to
muster up a stampeding herd of 1,200 students to
storm the polls and push through their constitution.
Apparently a large segment of the student body at the
time just didn't care. Despite repeated attempts by
the Daily to bring the constitution to the eyes pf
everyone, very few seemed to read it and fewer yet
actually studied it. George Ralph apparently leads a
group of almost 2,400 students who. dissatisfied with
the 1,200 who voted in the constitution, have voted
in George Ralph to change that constitution.
Albeit that there are many things of to be
said about the new constitution, there are many
things about it which will, I believe, if allowed to
fester unattended, drive student government down
into a mire of eomniitteekin, duplication and use
less work. Although things can be said for a con
stitution modeled on pretty political theories, one that
will work faster, smoother, and with less demand on
students' time has been requested by 2,400 students.
You went on 10 say in your article that "unless
the Legislature will go along with your reforms you'll
be all by yourself, George." Impossible as it is to
attack this statement on its face, I cannot envision
a Legislature representing the Stanford students, in
the face of George's huge .vote, turning a deaf ear to
the voice of the student body.
As to the Daily, instead of trying to point out the
futility of George's task or the evils of any change,
you, as the only published voice of the student body,
should back George to the hilt, or at least to 00
per cent of hilt. Opposition for opposition's sake never
helped government run smoothly or efficiently; it
never helped get anything done.
DICK MALTZMAN
To the Editor:
On Tuesday and Wednesday a record number of
Stanford students went to the polls and elected their
student body president by a convincing majority. On
Thursday the Daily printed an editorial concerning
the results of this election.
Members of the Daily staff (Daily editorial policy
is determined by the editorial board, not the start'
at large.—Ed) may not be in agreement with the ma
jority of the student body, ncr 'with the platform of
the new president. They have every right to their
opinions, but common .sense should restrain them
from printing .such an editorial as appeared Thurs
day. It is neither good policy for a campus news
paper, nor good publicity for Stanford. If this edi
torial policy is to continue throughout the coming
year, if the Daily is going to oppose whatever the
new president wants to do, and set up its own little
oligarchy, it may do so, but it will lose the favor and
respect of many people.
We have a new president, elected by 2,1389 people.
Let's back him up and help make his year successful,
not try to run him into the ground at the first turn.
POLLY McDONALD
To the Editor:
What Now, George? In your editorial you point out
that George can't put his reforms into effect without
the assistance of the Legislature. Theoretically, at
least, we adopt the notion in this country that our
governing body, the Legislature, puts into effect the
will of the majority. If we assume therefore that
George was elected by a majority of the student body
who desired reform in student government, then
doesn't it follow that the Legislature, reflecting the
views of the majority of the students, should and must
go along with George?
Practically, you could make an argument that Leg
islatures often don't echo the sentiments of the ma
jority they represent; but query whether this is the
practice which Legislatures should follow, and query
whether Legislatures consistently disregard the will
of their constituents.
If the student Legislature at Stanford does, as you
suggest, what it wills, then student government is run
by a bunch of despots, and it is high time for reform.
BILL FERNANDEZ
To the Editor:
Well, as the dust settles over the election field and
the outcome is decided, the valiant Stanford Daily
moves into action. During the entire campaign, our
newspaper brought out no editorial throwing its sup
port to one candidate. This would seem to indicate
an impartial and aloof stand on the election, for opin
ion in a newspaper belongs in a place where it can be
recognized as opinion—in the editorial column. How
ever, while thus maintaining an appearance of neu
trality, the Daily sought to insert its opinions else
where—in "reporting" the facts. Such an article as
the "condensation" of the Ralph-Leanse debate can
only be termed yellow journalism.
We have no objection to the Daily expressing its
views—through the proper channels. We do object to
distortion of the facts and misquoting or half-quoting
to misrepresent.
Nor do we object to the Daily expressing its views at
the proper time. But we cannot condone its ill-timed
attack of May 1!) on a settled issue. Especially when
the attack ignores certain facts.
1) George Ralph ran in opposition to the Con
stitution and its defender. He was elected by a ma
jority of the students in a record-breaking turnout.
No, he cannot "rewrite the Constitution by himself,"
but student interest in revision is certainly indicated
by his election.
2) "You cannot institute reform by yourself,
George." Nor can any reform candidate who is elect
ed. But, by virtue of the majority support behind
him, he can certainly attempt it.
3) "Unless the Legislature will go along with your
reforms, you'll be all by yourself." Reforms must
come from a law-making body, but isn't any law
making body responsible to the voters who gave it
authority? If the representatives in the Legislature
have any concern for the wishes of ihe constituents,
Ralph's reforms must be investigated.
What! Now? Daily. The Daily is now questioning
Ralph's ability to carry through his program. It is
implicating that support will be lacking to him. It is,
in fact, denying its support to him. Isn't it a bit late,
Daily? Is it time to create obstacles to the will of the
majority, or is it time to foster co-operation?
What now. Daily? A professional approach to the
situation, or a whining post-mortem?
What now, Daily.' A positive or a negative approach
to the new administration?

For crying out loud, George, haven't you done any

didn't you? This morning, I looked around, and man.
you haven't changed one damn thing.
By the way, can you make it legal to ride roller

Anyhow, it sure was a ball, wasn't it? But now
you're all alone. I'll bet you think I'm kidding, Lut
I'm not. I didn't think so either until 1 read the Daily
this morning. I can read. I rcaily can. Did you read
that article by Richard William Randolph? He says
you're alone, and boy, if he says you're alone, man,
you're all alone. I mean you've got me and 2,388

Randolph and without him you're nowhere, man. For

jority of the students in a record-breaking turnout.
No, he cannot "rewrite the Constitution by himself,"
but student interest in revision is certainly indicated
by his election.
2) "You cannot institute reform by yourself,
George." Nor can any reform candidate who is elect
ed. But, by virtue of the majority support behind
him, he can certainly attempt it.
3) "Unless the Legislature will go along with your
reforms, you'll be all by yourself." Reforms must
come from a law-making body, but isn't any law
making body responsible to the voters who gave it
authority? If the representatives in the Legislature
have any concern for the wishes of ihe constituents,
Ralph's reforms must be investigated.
What! Now? Daily. The Daily is now questioning
Ralph's ability to carry through his program. It is
implicating that support will be lacking to him. It is,
in fact, denying its support to him. Isn't it a bit late,
Daily? Is it time to create obstacles to the will of the
majority, or is it time to foster co-operation?
What now. Daily? A professional approach to the
situation, or a whining post-mortem?
What now, Daily.' A positive or a negative approach
to the new administration?

LET'S GET ON THE BALL, GEORGE
For crying out loud, George, haven't you done any
thing yet! Man, don't you realize you've got a man
date for reform? Well, what's the matter? You won,
didn't you? This morning, I looked around, and man.
you haven't changed one damn thing.
By the way, can you make it legal to ride roller
skates on Inner Quad? And, hey. Can we elimi
nate the Department of Athletics? No, 1 rcaily mean
it. 1 really do. I didn't make the varsity last year,
see, and I'm really teed-off.
Well, anyway, I'm just one of those 2,!iH9 who dur
ing some inexplicable neurotic upsurge latched your
square. Hey, that was pretty funny: "scratched your
square."
Anyhow, it sure was a ball, wasn't it? But now
you're all alone. I'll bet you think I'm kidding, Lut
I'm not. I didn't think so either until 1 read the Daily
this morning. I can read. I rcaily can. Did you read
that article by Richard William Randolph? He says
you're alone, and boy, if he says you're alone, man,
you're all alone. I mean you've got me and 2,388
others for sure but you ain't got Richard William
Randolph and without him you're nowhere, man. For
I am the editor, the campus mind-molder. And if
you can't get my support, mandate or no mandate,
you're wiped out, you mangy radical.
Can we burn the Daily Shack. George? Can we?
Please say yes. Or just nod. Well, anyway, there
had better be some noise around here by Monday,
because we guys ale really getting bored. If you
haven't shaped this place up by then, you may find
yourself running for Senator.
MICHAEL G. AGATE
To the Editor:
Your editorial in yesterday's Daily was a disgrace.
Without knowing all the facts concerning George
Ralph, you went ahead and attacked our new ASSU
president. All through the campaign and especially
after the debate Monday night, it was apparent that
the "objective" Daily was pulling for Leanse. Your
story and "quotation" coverage were stilted in favor
of anyone but Ralph.
I have been at this university for five years and
have keenly followed all the ASSU elections—all were
covered fairly by your newspaper. Why then was

the campaign coverage of George Ralph stilted?
You also mentioned in your editorial that the
". . . students dissatisfied with their government gave
a majority vote to a new Constitution . , However,
you forgot to add that less than one-third of the
student body voted in that election.
It appears to me that George Ralph really and truly
received a mandate from the students. The student
body will support George's reforms, and for the first
time in at least a decade will pay some attention to
student government.
Instead ol attacking George Ralph, it would have
been more intelligent if you had joined with the rest
ol the student body in wishing him success in in
stituting reforms.
RICHARD J. MEYER
To the Editor:
Your complete lack of sportsmanship and good
taste in writing the editorial on the school election
deserves a few comments.
No doubt you are entitled to your views as to who
was the more desirable candidate, but this is entirely
beside the point. Even in national elections, where
the things at stake are just a little more significant
than in our recent contest, it has always been con
sidered the proper thing to do to congratulate the*
winner, as you have always done in the past. Since
you did not desire to adopt this course of conduct,
you might have shown the restraint of not saying
anything.
Much more important is your opinion that the con
stitution which you so ardently espoused will pre
vent Mr. George from attaining any reform which
the majority of students seem to desire. If this is
true, it doesn't appear to be quite the monument
r.f representative student government that you claim
it to be!
Finally, I've always been disgusted by your smug
superiority complex about the fundamental standard.
It is beyond question a very fine code of life. Per
haps a closer reading of it rather than the constant
patting ourselves on the back can bring the editorials
back to the accepted minimum of decency.

T<. ihe Editor:
Your candidate for ASSU president has been de
feated. Instead, a man with imagination, a man with
a critical eye has been elected in a landslide. What
now, Daily?
You slanted your news stories and headlines against
the man wh6 was elected by almost two-thirds of
the voters. You said he was opposed to a platform
of increased student interest. (We did not.—Ed).
What now, Daily?
You have always been in favor of cooperation and
good feelings between various segments of student
government. You have always stood for the con
strue tive outlook. Will you now make yourself the
dissenter, the destructive influence to the man whom
an overwhelming majority of the students swept into
office?
For the first time in recent Stanford history a vast,
intense bloc of students have interested themselves in
the mo-.t intricate workings of their own govern
ment. Through the person of the winning candidate
they have shown an ardent desire to question various
phases of student government at Stanford, to cut
away the dead wood, remove the hollow men, and
instill, maybe for a long time to come, an individual
istic, pulsating version of student activities.
Are you going to help out, or was the old system

CHUCK MAHLER
ROBERT GILMAN
To the Editor:
The Daily's editorial, "What now, George?" on the
day following the student body election seems (like
so many other Daily editorials) to have missed the
point.
Its harping tone and negative approach is typical
of the childish attitude which has been taken toward
our newly-elected President—a President going into
office with more popular support than any ASSU
President since I have attended Stanford.
Some facts which it ignoies:
1) The student body of Stanford is the sovereign
in our consideration —not the Constitution and not
the legislature. These exist to reflect its will, to get
things done.
2) Far fewer students cared about the Constitu
tion which consumed so much time and caused so
much hot air over nothing this year than about elect
ing a President whom they thought would help them
find their way out of the jungle of red tape, com
mitteeism and general baloney which surrounds their
student body government.
3) The burden of proof lies not with George Ralph
but with the committees and procedures of the ASSU
which must now, and this is a good thing, prove their
worth.
I am an ASSU "bureaucrat" having served on many
boards and committees and would be the first to
maintain that a hard-working, intelligent and level
headed ASSU can provide real student leadership
where and when it is needed. But haggling over petty
appropriations, spending months trying to get our
Constitution in line with that of the political scien
tists' "perfect union" and general wasting time and
getting nothing done—this is not good student gov
ernment and it deserves the protest which it has
received.
We ought to be glad that this election has happened
and that one student had the nerve and the fight to
buck all that we dislike. A,student body as intelli
gent as Stanford's deserves a vital, compact govern
ment and with the honest and generous help of the
Daily and our out-going officers perhaps George
Ralph can accomplish something.
We owe him our thanks and our support.
JACK FRASER
To the Editor:
You've written an editorial. You're the present
editor of the Stanford Daily. What now, Dickie?
In the first place, the bulk of your editorial was
a restatement of facts which have been hashed over
throughout the entire presidential campaign. There
is nothing original but your bitter tone.
Next, we criticize your poor sportsmanship.
Throughout the past two weeks the Daily has shown
its bias by its silence on events which had the whole
campus talking. George Ralph's campaign was ad
mittedly sensational, and he has justified this sen
sationalism to the satisfaction of 2,389 voters. Never
theless, the events of his campaign were news. It was
your duty to record them objectively, but you de
liberately maintained silence, apparently in order
to kill the effect for which he was striving. The
campaign is over now, Dickie, and your bias has
culminated in Thursday's display of poor sportsman
ship.
The Daily exists for the benefit of the students,
and not as a grindstone for the editor's political
axes. You have a right to your opinion, but it
should be expressed in the letters section, rather
than in an unsigned editorial. You seem to think
the Legislature will not accept the new president's
proposed reforms. Remember, the Legislature also
exists for the benefit of the students. You say Ralph
stands alone, Dickie? Not according to 2,389 voters.
We think it's time for you to grow up and become
a big boy now. We're curious to see how you'll
answer this and other letters about your editorial.
What now, Dickie?
PATRICK MADDEN GUS BLAISDBLL
KEVIN CASSEDY ROWENA PHILLIPS
.1 F. SKINNER JAYNE KRAVIG
ARTHUR BOSWORTH

To the Editor:
In your article entitled "What now, George?" in
the May l£th Daily, you made a statement attacking
by innuendo the validity of George Ralph's "man
date" to attack the new ASSU constitution. You said
further that, "A month ago, students dissatisfied with
their government gave a majority vote to a new
Constitution for ASSU."
These so called "dissatisfied students" were able to
muster up a stampeding herd of 1,200 students to
storm the polls and push through their constitution.
Apparently a large segment of the student body at the
time just didn't care. Despite repeated attempts by
the Daily to bring the constitution to the eyes pf
everyone, very few seemed to read it and fewer yet
actually studied it. George Ralph apparently leads a
group of almost 2,400 students who. dissatisfied with
the 1,200 who voted in the constitution, have voted
in George Ralph to change that constitution.
Albeit that there are many things of to be
said about the new constitution, there are many
things about it which will, I believe, if allowed to
fester unattended, drive student government down
into a mire of eomniitteekin, duplication and use
less work. Although things can be said for a con
stitution modeled on pretty political theories, one that
will work faster, smoother, and with less demand on
students' time has been requested by 2,400 students.
You went on 10 say in your article that "unless
the Legislature will go along with your reforms you'll
be all by yourself, George." Impossible as it is to
attack this statement on its face, I cannot envision
a Legislature representing the Stanford students, in
the face of George's huge .vote, turning a deaf ear to
the voice of the student body.
As to the Daily, instead of trying to point out the
futility of George's task or the evils of any change,
you, as the only published voice of the student body,
should back George to the hilt, or at least to 00
per cent of hilt. Opposition for opposition's sake never
helped government run smoothly or efficiently; it
never helped get anything done.
DICK MALTZMAN
To the Editor:
On Tuesday and Wednesday a record number of
Stanford students went to the polls and elected their
student body president by a convincing majority. On
Thursday the Daily printed an editorial concerning
the results of this election.
Members of the Daily staff (Daily editorial policy
is determined by the editorial board, not the start'
at large.—Ed) may not be in agreement with the ma
jority of the student body, ncr 'with the platform of
the new president. They have every right to their
opinions, but common .sense should restrain them
from printing .such an editorial as appeared Thurs
day. It is neither good policy for a campus news
paper, nor good publicity for Stanford. If this edi
torial policy is to continue throughout the coming
year, if the Daily is going to oppose whatever the
new president wants to do, and set up its own little
oligarchy, it may do so, but it will lose the favor and
respect of many people.
We have a new president, elected by 2,1389 people.
Let's back him up and help make his year successful,
not try to run him into the ground at the first turn.
POLLY McDONALD
To the Editor:
What Now, George? In your editorial you point out
that George can't put his reforms into effect without
the assistance of the Legislature. Theoretically, at
least, we adopt the notion in this country that our
governing body, the Legislature, puts into effect the
will of the majority. If we assume therefore that
George was elected by a majority of the student body
who desired reform in student government, then
doesn't it follow that the Legislature, reflecting the
views of the majority of the students, should and must
go along with George?
Practically, you could make an argument that Leg
islatures often don't echo the sentiments of the ma
jority they represent; but query whether this is the
practice which Legislatures should follow, and query
whether Legislatures consistently disregard the will
of their constituents.
If the student Legislature at Stanford does, as you
suggest, what it wills, then student government is run
by a bunch of despots, and it is high time for reform.
BILL FERNANDEZ
To the Editor:
Well, as the dust settles over the election field and
the outcome is decided, the valiant Stanford Daily
moves into action. During the entire campaign, our
newspaper brought out no editorial throwing its sup
port to one candidate. This would seem to indicate
an impartial and aloof stand on the election, for opin
ion in a newspaper belongs in a place where it can be
recognized as opinion—in the editorial column. How
ever, while thus maintaining an appearance of neu
trality, the Daily sought to insert its opinions else
where—in "reporting" the facts. Such an article as
the "condensation" of the Ralph-Leanse debate can
only be termed yellow journalism.
We have no objection to the Daily expressing its
views—through the proper channels. We do object to
distortion of the facts and misquoting or half-quoting
to misrepresent.
Nor do we object to the Daily expressing its views at
the proper time. But we cannot condone its ill-timed
attack of May 1!) on a settled issue. Especially when
the attack ignores certain facts.
1) George Ralph ran in opposition to the Con
stitution and its defender. He was elected by a ma
jority of the students in a record-breaking turnout.
No, he cannot "rewrite the Constitution by himself,"
but student interest in revision is certainly indicated
by his election.
2) "You cannot institute reform by yourself,
George." Nor can any reform candidate who is elect
ed. But, by virtue of the majority support behind
him, he can certainly attempt it.
3) "Unless the Legislature will go along with your
reforms, you'll be all by yourself." Reforms must
come from a law-making body, but isn't any law
making body responsible to the voters who gave it
authority? If the representatives in the Legislature
have any concern for the wishes of ihe constituents,
Ralph's reforms must be investigated.
What! Now? Daily. The Daily is now questioning
Ralph's ability to carry through his program. It is
implicating that support will be lacking to him. It is,
in fact, denying its support to him. Isn't it a bit late,
Daily? Is it time to create obstacles to the will of the
majority, or is it time to foster co-operation?
What now. Daily? A professional approach to the
situation, or a whining post-mortem?
What now, Daily.' A positive or a negative approach
to the new administration?

Members of the Daily staff (Daily editorial policy
is determined by the editorial board, not the start'
at large.—Ed) may not be in agreement with the ma
jority of the student body, ncr 'with the platform of
the new president. They have every right to their
opinions, but common .sense should restrain them
from printing .such an editorial as appeared Thurs
day. It is neither good policy for a campus news
paper, nor good publicity for Stanford. If this edi
torial policy is to continue throughout the coming
year, if the Daily is going to oppose whatever the
new president wants to do, and set up its own little
oligarchy, it may do so, but it will lose the favor and
respect of many people.
We have a new president, elected by 2,1389 people.
Let's back him up and help make his year successful,
not try to run him into the ground at the first turn.
POLLY McDONALD
To the Editor:
What Now, George? In your editorial you point out
that George can't put his reforms into effect without
the assistance of the Legislature. Theoretically, at
least, we adopt the notion in this country that our
governing body, the Legislature, puts into effect the
will of the majority. If we assume therefore that
George was elected by a majority of the student body
who desired reform in student government, then
doesn't it follow that the Legislature, reflecting the
views of the majority of the students, should and must
go along with George?
Practically, you could make an argument that Leg
islatures often don't echo the sentiments of the ma
jority they represent; but query whether this is the
practice which Legislatures should follow, and query
whether Legislatures consistently disregard the will
of their constituents.
If the student Legislature at Stanford does, as you
suggest, what it wills, then student government is run
by a bunch of despots, and it is high time for reform.
BILL FERNANDEZ
To the Editor:
Well, as the dust settles over the election field and
the outcome is decided, the valiant Stanford Daily
moves into action. During the entire campaign, our
newspaper brought out no editorial throwing its sup
port to one candidate. This would seem to indicate
an impartial and aloof stand on the election, for opin
ion in a newspaper belongs in a place where it can be
recognized as opinion—in the editorial column. How
ever, while thus maintaining an appearance of neu
trality, the Daily sought to insert its opinions else
where—in "reporting" the facts. Such an article as
the "condensation" of the Ralph-Leanse debate can
only be termed yellow journalism.
We have no objection to the Daily expressing its
views—through the proper channels. We do object to
distortion of the facts and misquoting or half-quoting
to misrepresent.
Nor do we object to the Daily expressing its views at
the proper time. But we cannot condone its ill-timed
attack of May 1!) on a settled issue. Especially when
the attack ignores certain facts.
1) George Ralph ran in opposition to the Con
stitution and its defender. He was elected by a ma
jority of the students in a record-breaking turnout.
No, he cannot "rewrite the Constitution by himself,"
but student interest in revision is certainly indicated
by his election.
2) "You cannot institute reform by yourself,
George." Nor can any reform candidate who is elect
ed. But, by virtue of the majority support behind
him, he can certainly attempt it.
3) "Unless the Legislature will go along with your
reforms, you'll be all by yourself." Reforms must
come from a law-making body, but isn't any law
making body responsible to the voters who gave it
authority? If the representatives in the Legislature
have any concern for the wishes of ihe constituents,
Ralph's reforms must be investigated.
What! Now? Daily. The Daily is now questioning
Ralph's ability to carry through his program. It is
implicating that support will be lacking to him. It is,
in fact, denying its support to him. Isn't it a bit late,
Daily? Is it time to create obstacles to the will of the
majority, or is it time to foster co-operation?
What now. Daily? A professional approach to the
situation, or a whining post-mortem?
What now, Daily.' A positive or a negative approach
to the new administration?

LET'S GET ON THE BALL, GEORGE
For crying out loud, George, haven't you done any
thing yet! Man, don't you realize you've got a man
date for reform? Well, what's the matter? You won,
didn't you? This morning, I looked around, and man.
you haven't changed one damn thing.
By the way, can you make it legal to ride roller
skates on Inner Quad? And, hey. Can we elimi
nate the Department of Athletics? No, 1 rcaily mean
it. 1 really do. I didn't make the varsity last year,
see, and I'm really teed-off.
Well, anyway, I'm just one of those 2,!iH9 who dur
ing some inexplicable neurotic upsurge latched your
square. Hey, that was pretty funny: "scratched your
square."
Anyhow, it sure was a ball, wasn't it? But now
you're all alone. I'll bet you think I'm kidding, Lut
I'm not. I didn't think so either until 1 read the Daily
this morning. I can read. I rcaily can. Did you read
that article by Richard William Randolph? He says
you're alone, and boy, if he says you're alone, man,
you're all alone. I mean you've got me and 2,388
others for sure but you ain't got Richard William
Randolph and without him you're nowhere, man. For
I am the editor, the campus mind-molder. And if
you can't get my support, mandate or no mandate,
you're wiped out, you mangy radical.
Can we burn the Daily Shack. George? Can we?
Please say yes. Or just nod. Well, anyway, there
had better be some noise around here by Monday,
because we guys ale really getting bored. If you
haven't shaped this place up by then, you may find
yourself running for Senator.
MICHAEL G. AGATE
To the Editor:
Your editorial in yesterday's Daily was a disgrace.
Without knowing all the facts concerning George
Ralph, you went ahead and attacked our new ASSU
president. All through the campaign and especially
after the debate Monday night, it was apparent that
the "objective" Daily was pulling for Leanse. Your
story and "quotation" coverage were stilted in favor
of anyone but Ralph.
I have been at this university for five years and
have keenly followed all the ASSU elections—all were
covered fairly by your newspaper. Why then was

the campaign coverage of George Ralph stilted?
You also mentioned in your editorial that the
". . . students dissatisfied with their government gave
a majority vote to a new Constitution . , However,
you forgot to add that less than one-third of the
student body voted in that election.
It appears to me that George Ralph really and truly
received a mandate from the students. The student
body will support George's reforms, and for the first
time in at least a decade will pay some attention to
student government.
Instead ol attacking George Ralph, it would have
been more intelligent if you had joined with the rest
ol the student body in wishing him success in in
stituting reforms.
RICHARD J. MEYER
To the Editor:
Your complete lack of sportsmanship and good
taste in writing the editorial on the school election
deserves a few comments.
No doubt you are entitled to your views as to who
was the more desirable candidate, but this is entirely
beside the point. Even in national elections, where
the things at stake are just a little more significant
than in our recent contest, it has always been con
sidered the proper thing to do to congratulate the*
winner, as you have always done in the past. Since
you did not desire to adopt this course of conduct,
you might have shown the restraint of not saying
anything.
Much more important is your opinion that the con
stitution which you so ardently espoused will pre
vent Mr. George from attaining any reform which
the majority of students seem to desire. If this is
true, it doesn't appear to be quite the monument
r.f representative student government that you claim
it to be!
Finally, I've always been disgusted by your smug
superiority complex about the fundamental standard.
It is beyond question a very fine code of life. Per
haps a closer reading of it rather than the constant
patting ourselves on the back can bring the editorials
back to the accepted minimum of decency.

Stanford Daily editorial policy is formulated by

To the Editor:
Yesterday The Daily immortalized itself in bad
taste. To criticize publicly the incoming ASSU Presi
dent is both morally wrong and intellectually un
f.ound.
1 say critic ize because under no circumstances could
yesterday's editorial be called unbiased. Indeed, the
whole campaign coveiage was somewhat less than
impartial. The moral wrongness is apparent: Stan
ford University profits not one whit from such an
open attack o«i the policies of the President-elect.
Likewise manifest is the intellectual error. If the

the surest way to endear him to the hearts of the

PHILIP OLSON
T<. ihe Editor:
Your candidate for ASSU president has been de
feated. Instead, a man with imagination, a man with
a critical eye has been elected in a landslide. What
now, Daily?
You slanted your news stories and headlines against
the man wh6 was elected by almost two-thirds of
the voters. You said he was opposed to a platform
of increased student interest. (We did not.—Ed).
What now, Daily?
You have always been in favor of cooperation and
good feelings between various segments of student
government. You have always stood for the con
strue tive outlook. Will you now make yourself the
dissenter, the destructive influence to the man whom
an overwhelming majority of the students swept into
office?
For the first time in recent Stanford history a vast,
intense bloc of students have interested themselves in
the mo-.t intricate workings of their own govern
ment. Through the person of the winning candidate
they have shown an ardent desire to question various
phases of student government at Stanford, to cut
away the dead wood, remove the hollow men, and
instill, maybe for a long time to come, an individual
istic, pulsating version of student activities.
Are you going to help out, or was the old system
more to your comfort? What now, Daily?

CHUCK MAHLER
ROBERT GILMAN
To the Editor:
The Daily's editorial, "What now, George?" on the
day following the student body election seems (like
so many other Daily editorials) to have missed the
point.
Its harping tone and negative approach is typical
of the childish attitude which has been taken toward
our newly-elected President—a President going into
office with more popular support than any ASSU
President since I have attended Stanford.
Some facts which it ignoies:
1) The student body of Stanford is the sovereign
in our consideration —not the Constitution and not
the legislature. These exist to reflect its will, to get
things done.
2) Far fewer students cared about the Constitu
tion which consumed so much time and caused so
much hot air over nothing this year than about elect
ing a President whom they thought would help them
find their way out of the jungle of red tape, com
mitteeism and general baloney which surrounds their
student body government.
3) The burden of proof lies not with George Ralph
but with the committees and procedures of the ASSU
which must now, and this is a good thing, prove their
worth.
I am an ASSU "bureaucrat" having served on many
boards and committees and would be the first to
maintain that a hard-working, intelligent and level
headed ASSU can provide real student leadership
where and when it is needed. But haggling over petty
appropriations, spending months trying to get our
Constitution in line with that of the political scien
tists' "perfect union" and general wasting time and
getting nothing done—this is not good student gov
ernment and it deserves the protest which it has
received.
We ought to be glad that this election has happened
and that one student had the nerve and the fight to
buck all that we dislike. A,student body as intelli
gent as Stanford's deserves a vital, compact govern
ment and with the honest and generous help of the
Daily and our out-going officers perhaps George
Ralph can accomplish something.
We owe him our thanks and our support.
JACK FRASER
To the Editor:
You've written an editorial. You're the present
editor of the Stanford Daily. What now, Dickie?
In the first place, the bulk of your editorial was
a restatement of facts which have been hashed over
throughout the entire presidential campaign. There
is nothing original but your bitter tone.
Next, we criticize your poor sportsmanship.
Throughout the past two weeks the Daily has shown
its bias by its silence on events which had the whole
campus talking. George Ralph's campaign was ad
mittedly sensational, and he has justified this sen
sationalism to the satisfaction of 2,389 voters. Never
theless, the events of his campaign were news. It was
your duty to record them objectively, but you de
liberately maintained silence, apparently in order
to kill the effect for which he was striving. The
campaign is over now, Dickie, and your bias has
culminated in Thursday's display of poor sportsman
ship.
The Daily exists for the benefit of the students,
and not as a grindstone for the editor's political
axes. You have a right to your opinion, but it
should be expressed in the letters section, rather
than in an unsigned editorial. You seem to think
the Legislature will not accept the new president's
proposed reforms. Remember, the Legislature also
exists for the benefit of the students. You say Ralph
stands alone, Dickie? Not according to 2,389 voters.
We think it's time for you to grow up and become
a big boy now. We're curious to see how you'll
answer this and other letters about your editorial.
What now, Dickie?
PATRICK MADDEN GUS BLAISDBLL
KEVIN CASSEDY ROWENA PHILLIPS

ARTHUR BOSWORTH

To the Editor:
In your article entitled "What now, George?" in
the May l£th Daily, you made a statement attacking
by innuendo the validity of George Ralph's "man
date" to attack the new ASSU constitution. You said
further that, "A month ago, students dissatisfied with
their government gave a majority vote to a new
Constitution for ASSU."
These so called "dissatisfied students" were able to
muster up a stampeding herd of 1,200 students to
storm the polls and push through their constitution.
Apparently a large segment of the student body at the
time just didn't care. Despite repeated attempts by
the Daily to bring the constitution to the eyes pf
everyone, very few seemed to read it and fewer yet
actually studied it. George Ralph apparently leads a
group of almost 2,400 students who. dissatisfied with
the 1,200 who voted in the constitution, have voted
in George Ralph to change that constitution.
Albeit that there are many things of to be
said about the new constitution, there are many
things about it which will, I believe, if allowed to
fester unattended, drive student government down
into a mire of eomniitteekin, duplication and use
less work. Although things can be said for a con
stitution modeled on pretty political theories, one that
will work faster, smoother, and with less demand on
students' time has been requested by 2,400 students.
You went on 10 say in your article that "unless
the Legislature will go along with your reforms you'll
be all by yourself, George." Impossible as it is to
attack this statement on its face, I cannot envision
a Legislature representing the Stanford students, in
the face of George's huge .vote, turning a deaf ear to
the voice of the student body.
As to the Daily, instead of trying to point out the
futility of George's task or the evils of any change,
you, as the only published voice of the student body,
should back George to the hilt, or at least to 00
per cent of hilt. Opposition for opposition's sake never
helped government run smoothly or efficiently; it
never helped get anything done.
DICK MALTZMAN
To the Editor:
On Tuesday and Wednesday a record number of
Stanford students went to the polls and elected their
student body president by a convincing majority. On
Thursday the Daily printed an editorial concerning

To the Editor:
In your article entitled "What now, George?" in
the May l£th Daily, you made a statement attacking
by innuendo the validity of George Ralph's "man
date" to attack the new ASSU constitution. You said
further that, "A month ago, students dissatisfied with
their government gave a majority vote to a new
Constitution for ASSU."
These so called "dissatisfied students" were able to
muster up a stampeding herd of 1,200 students to
storm the polls and push through their constitution.
Apparently a large segment of the student body at the
time just didn't care. Despite repeated attempts by
the Daily to bring the constitution to the eyes pf
everyone, very few seemed to read it and fewer yet
actually studied it. George Ralph apparently leads a
group of almost 2,400 students who. dissatisfied with
the 1,200 who voted in the constitution, have voted
in George Ralph to change that constitution.
Albeit that there are many things of to be
said about the new constitution, there are many
things about it which will, I believe, if allowed to
fester unattended, drive student government down
into a mire of eomniitteekin, duplication and use
less work. Although things can be said for a con
stitution modeled on pretty political theories, one that
will work faster, smoother, and with less demand on
students' time has been requested by 2,400 students.
You went on 10 say in your article that "unless
the Legislature will go along with your reforms you'll
be all by yourself, George." Impossible as it is to
attack this statement on its face, I cannot envision
a Legislature representing the Stanford students, in
the face of George's huge .vote, turning a deaf ear to
the voice of the student body.
As to the Daily, instead of trying to point out the
futility of George's task or the evils of any change,
you, as the only published voice of the student body,
should back George to the hilt, or at least to 00
per cent of hilt. Opposition for opposition's sake never
helped government run smoothly or efficiently; it
never helped get anything done.
DICK MALTZMAN
To the Editor:
On Tuesday and Wednesday a record number of
Stanford students went to the polls and elected their
student body president by a convincing majority. On
Thursday the Daily printed an editorial concerning
the results of this election.
Members of the Daily staff (Daily editorial policy
is determined by the editorial board, not the start'
at large.—Ed) may not be in agreement with the ma
jority of the student body, ncr 'with the platform of
the new president. They have every right to their
opinions, but common .sense should restrain them
from printing .such an editorial as appeared Thurs
day. It is neither good policy for a campus news
paper, nor good publicity for Stanford. If this edi
torial policy is to continue throughout the coming
year, if the Daily is going to oppose whatever the
new president wants to do, and set up its own little
oligarchy, it may do so, but it will lose the favor and
respect of many people.
We have a new president, elected by 2,1389 people.
Let's back him up and help make his year successful,
not try to run him into the ground at the first turn.
POLLY McDONALD
To the Editor:
What Now, George? In your editorial you point out
that George can't put his reforms into effect without
the assistance of the Legislature. Theoretically, at
least, we adopt the notion in this country that our
governing body, the Legislature, puts into effect the
will of the majority. If we assume therefore that
George was elected by a majority of the student body
who desired reform in student government, then
doesn't it follow that the Legislature, reflecting the
views of the majority of the students, should and must
go along with George?
Practically, you could make an argument that Leg
islatures often don't echo the sentiments of the ma
jority they represent; but query whether this is the
practice which Legislatures should follow, and query
whether Legislatures consistently disregard the will
of their constituents.
If the student Legislature at Stanford does, as you
suggest, what it wills, then student government is run
by a bunch of despots, and it is high time for reform.
BILL FERNANDEZ
To the Editor:
Well, as the dust settles over the election field and
the outcome is decided, the valiant Stanford Daily
moves into action. During the entire campaign, our
newspaper brought out no editorial throwing its sup
port to one candidate. This would seem to indicate
an impartial and aloof stand on the election, for opin
ion in a newspaper belongs in a place where it can be
recognized as opinion—in the editorial column. How
ever, while thus maintaining an appearance of neu
trality, the Daily sought to insert its opinions else
where—in "reporting" the facts. Such an article as
the "condensation" of the Ralph-Leanse debate can
only be termed yellow journalism.
We have no objection to the Daily expressing its
views—through the proper channels. We do object to
distortion of the facts and misquoting or half-quoting
to misrepresent.
Nor do we object to the Daily expressing its views at
the proper time. But we cannot condone its ill-timed
attack of May 1!) on a settled issue. Especially when
the attack ignores certain facts.
1) George Ralph ran in opposition to the Con
stitution and its defender. He was elected by a ma
jority of the students in a record-breaking turnout.
No, he cannot "rewrite the Constitution by himself,"
but student interest in revision is certainly indicated
by his election.
2) "You cannot institute reform by yourself,
George." Nor can any reform candidate who is elect
ed. But, by virtue of the majority support behind
him, he can certainly attempt it.
3) "Unless the Legislature will go along with your
reforms, you'll be all by yourself." Reforms must
come from a law-making body, but isn't any law
making body responsible to the voters who gave it
authority? If the representatives in the Legislature
have any concern for the wishes of ihe constituents,
Ralph's reforms must be investigated.
What! Now? Daily. The Daily is now questioning
Ralph's ability to carry through his program. It is
implicating that support will be lacking to him. It is,
in fact, denying its support to him. Isn't it a bit late,
Daily? Is it time to create obstacles to the will of the
majority, or is it time to foster co-operation?
What now. Daily? A professional approach to the
situation, or a whining post-mortem?
What now, Daily.' A positive or a negative approach
to the new administration?

MICHAEL G. AGATE
To the Editor:
Your editorial in yesterday's Daily was a disgrace.
Without knowing all the facts concerning George
Ralph, you went ahead and attacked our new ASSU
president. All through the campaign and especially
after the debate Monday night, it was apparent that
the "objective" Daily was pulling for Leanse. Your
story and "quotation" coverage were stilted in favor
of anyone but Ralph.
I have been at this university for five years and
have keenly followed all the ASSU elections—all were
covered fairly by your newspaper. Why then was

the campaign coverage of George Ralph stilted?
You also mentioned in your editorial that the
". . . students dissatisfied with their government gave
a majority vote to a new Constitution . , However,
you forgot to add that less than one-third of the
student body voted in that election.
It appears to me that George Ralph really and truly
received a mandate from the students. The student
body will support George's reforms, and for the first
time in at least a decade will pay some attention to
student government.
Instead ol attacking George Ralph, it would have
been more intelligent if you had joined with the rest
ol the student body in wishing him success in in
stituting reforms.
RICHARD J. MEYER
To the Editor:
Your complete lack of sportsmanship and good
taste in writing the editorial on the school election
deserves a few comments.
No doubt you are entitled to your views as to who
was the more desirable candidate, but this is entirely
beside the point. Even in national elections, where
the things at stake are just a little more significant
than in our recent contest, it has always been con
sidered the proper thing to do to congratulate the*
winner, as you have always done in the past. Since
you did not desire to adopt this course of conduct,
you might have shown the restraint of not saying
anything.
Much more important is your opinion that the con
stitution which you so ardently espoused will pre
vent Mr. George from attaining any reform which
the majority of students seem to desire. If this is
true, it doesn't appear to be quite the monument
r.f representative student government that you claim
it to be!
Finally, I've always been disgusted by your smug
superiority complex about the fundamental standard.
It is beyond question a very fine code of life. Per
haps a closer reading of it rather than the constant
patting ourselves on the back can bring the editorials
back to the accepted minimum of decency.

T<. ihe Editor:
Your candidate for ASSU president has been de
feated. Instead, a man with imagination, a man with

You slanted your news stories and headlines against

the voters. You said he was opposed to a platform
of increased student interest. (We did not.—Ed).

For the first time in recent Stanford history a vast,

the mo-.t intricate workings of their own govern

they have shown an ardent desire to question various
phases of student government at Stanford, to cut
away the dead wood, remove the hollow men, and

CHUCK MAHLER
ROBERT GILMAN
To the Editor:
The Daily's editorial, "What now, George?" on the
day following the student body election seems (like
so many other Daily editorials) to have missed the
point.
Its harping tone and negative approach is typical
of the childish attitude which has been taken toward
our newly-elected President—a President going into
office with more popular support than any ASSU
President since I have attended Stanford.
Some facts which it ignoies:
1) The student body of Stanford is the sovereign
in our consideration —not the Constitution and not
the legislature. These exist to reflect its will, to get
things done.
2) Far fewer students cared about the Constitu
tion which consumed so much time and caused so
much hot air over nothing this year than about elect
ing a President whom they thought would help them
find their way out of the jungle of red tape, com
mitteeism and general baloney which surrounds their
student body government.
3) The burden of proof lies not with George Ralph
but with the committees and procedures of the ASSU
which must now, and this is a good thing, prove their
worth.
I am an ASSU "bureaucrat" having served on many
boards and committees and would be the first to
maintain that a hard-working, intelligent and level
headed ASSU can provide real student leadership
where and when it is needed. But haggling over petty
appropriations, spending months trying to get our
Constitution in line with that of the political scien
tists' "perfect union" and general wasting time and
getting nothing done—this is not good student gov
ernment and it deserves the protest which it has
received.
We ought to be glad that this election has happened
and that one student had the nerve and the fight to
buck all that we dislike. A,student body as intelli
gent as Stanford's deserves a vital, compact govern
ment and with the honest and generous help of the
Daily and our out-going officers perhaps George
Ralph can accomplish something.
We owe him our thanks and our support.
JACK FRASER
To the Editor:
You've written an editorial. You're the present
editor of the Stanford Daily. What now, Dickie?
In the first place, the bulk of your editorial was
a restatement of facts which have been hashed over
throughout the entire presidential campaign. There
is nothing original but your bitter tone.
Next, we criticize your poor sportsmanship.
Throughout the past two weeks the Daily has shown
its bias by its silence on events which had the whole
campus talking. George Ralph's campaign was ad
mittedly sensational, and he has justified this sen
sationalism to the satisfaction of 2,389 voters. Never
theless, the events of his campaign were news. It was
your duty to record them objectively, but you de
liberately maintained silence, apparently in order
to kill the effect for which he was striving. The
campaign is over now, Dickie, and your bias has
culminated in Thursday's display of poor sportsman
ship.
The Daily exists for the benefit of the students,
and not as a grindstone for the editor's political
axes. You have a right to your opinion, but it
should be expressed in the letters section, rather
than in an unsigned editorial. You seem to think
the Legislature will not accept the new president's
proposed reforms. Remember, the Legislature also
exists for the benefit of the students. You say Ralph
stands alone, Dickie? Not according to 2,389 voters.

day following the student body election seems (like
so many other Daily editorials) to have missed the
point.
Its harping tone and negative approach is typical
of the childish attitude which has been taken toward
our newly-elected President—a President going into
office with more popular support than any ASSU
President since I have attended Stanford.
Some facts which it ignoies:
1) The student body of Stanford is the sovereign
in our consideration —not the Constitution and not
the legislature. These exist to reflect its will, to get
things done.
2) Far fewer students cared about the Constitu
tion which consumed so much time and caused so
much hot air over nothing this year than about elect
ing a President whom they thought would help them
find their way out of the jungle of red tape, com
mitteeism and general baloney which surrounds their
student body government.
3) The burden of proof lies not with George Ralph
but with the committees and procedures of the ASSU
which must now, and this is a good thing, prove their
worth.
I am an ASSU "bureaucrat" having served on many
boards and committees and would be the first to
maintain that a hard-working, intelligent and level
headed ASSU can provide real student leadership
where and when it is needed. But haggling over petty
appropriations, spending months trying to get our
Constitution in line with that of the political scien
tists' "perfect union" and general wasting time and
getting nothing done—this is not good student gov
ernment and it deserves the protest which it has
received.
We ought to be glad that this election has happened
and that one student had the nerve and the fight to
buck all that we dislike. A,student body as intelli
gent as Stanford's deserves a vital, compact govern
ment and with the honest and generous help of the
Daily and our out-going officers perhaps George
Ralph can accomplish something.
We owe him our thanks and our support.
JACK FRASER
To the Editor:
You've written an editorial. You're the present
editor of the Stanford Daily. What now, Dickie?
In the first place, the bulk of your editorial was
a restatement of facts which have been hashed over
throughout the entire presidential campaign. There
is nothing original but your bitter tone.
Next, we criticize your poor sportsmanship.
Throughout the past two weeks the Daily has shown
its bias by its silence on events which had the whole
campus talking. George Ralph's campaign was ad
mittedly sensational, and he has justified this sen
sationalism to the satisfaction of 2,389 voters. Never
theless, the events of his campaign were news. It was
your duty to record them objectively, but you de
liberately maintained silence, apparently in order
to kill the effect for which he was striving. The
campaign is over now, Dickie, and your bias has
culminated in Thursday's display of poor sportsman
ship.
The Daily exists for the benefit of the students,
and not as a grindstone for the editor's political
axes. You have a right to your opinion, but it
should be expressed in the letters section, rather
than in an unsigned editorial. You seem to think
the Legislature will not accept the new president's
proposed reforms. Remember, the Legislature also
exists for the benefit of the students. You say Ralph
stands alone, Dickie? Not according to 2,389 voters.
We think it's time for you to grow up and become
a big boy now. We're curious to see how you'll
answer this and other letters about your editorial.
What now, Dickie?

To the Editor:
In your article entitled "What now, George?" in
the May l£th Daily, you made a statement attacking
by innuendo the validity of George Ralph's "man
date" to attack the new ASSU constitution. You said
further that, "A month ago, students dissatisfied with
their government gave a majority vote to a new
Constitution for ASSU."
These so called "dissatisfied students" were able to
muster up a stampeding herd of 1,200 students to
storm the polls and push through their constitution.
Apparently a large segment of the student body at the
time just didn't care. Despite repeated attempts by
the Daily to bring the constitution to the eyes pf
everyone, very few seemed to read it and fewer yet
actually studied it. George Ralph apparently leads a
group of almost 2,400 students who. dissatisfied with
the 1,200 who voted in the constitution, have voted
in George Ralph to change that constitution.
Albeit that there are many things of to be
said about the new constitution, there are many
things about it which will, I believe, if allowed to
fester unattended, drive student government down
into a mire of eomniitteekin, duplication and use
less work. Although things can be said for a con
stitution modeled on pretty political theories, one that
will work faster, smoother, and with less demand on
students' time has been requested by 2,400 students.
You went on 10 say in your article that "unless
the Legislature will go along with your reforms you'll
be all by yourself, George." Impossible as it is to
attack this statement on its face, I cannot envision
a Legislature representing the Stanford students, in
the face of George's huge .vote, turning a deaf ear to
the voice of the student body.
As to the Daily, instead of trying to point out the
futility of George's task or the evils of any change,
you, as the only published voice of the student body,
should back George to the hilt, or at least to 00
per cent of hilt. Opposition for opposition's sake never
helped government run smoothly or efficiently; it
never helped get anything done.
DICK MALTZMAN
To the Editor:
On Tuesday and Wednesday a record number of
Stanford students went to the polls and elected their
student body president by a convincing majority. On
Thursday the Daily printed an editorial concerning
the results of this election.
Members of the Daily staff (Daily editorial policy
is determined by the editorial board, not the start'
at large.—Ed) may not be in agreement with the ma
jority of the student body, ncr 'with the platform of
the new president. They have every right to their
opinions, but common .sense should restrain them
from printing .such an editorial as appeared Thurs
day. It is neither good policy for a campus news
paper, nor good publicity for Stanford. If this edi
torial policy is to continue throughout the coming
year, if the Daily is going to oppose whatever the
new president wants to do, and set up its own little
oligarchy, it may do so, but it will lose the favor and
respect of many people.
We have a new president, elected by 2,1389 people.
Let's back him up and help make his year successful,
not try to run him into the ground at the first turn.
POLLY McDONALD
To the Editor:
What Now, George? In your editorial you point out
that George can't put his reforms into effect without
the assistance of the Legislature. Theoretically, at
least, we adopt the notion in this country that our
governing body, the Legislature, puts into effect the
will of the majority. If we assume therefore that
George was elected by a majority of the student body
who desired reform in student government, then
doesn't it follow that the Legislature, reflecting the
views of the majority of the students, should and must
go along with George?
Practically, you could make an argument that Leg
islatures often don't echo the sentiments of the ma
jority they represent; but query whether this is the
practice which Legislatures should follow, and query
whether Legislatures consistently disregard the will
of their constituents.
If the student Legislature at Stanford does, as you
suggest, what it wills, then student government is run
by a bunch of despots, and it is high time for reform.
BILL FERNANDEZ
To the Editor:
Well, as the dust settles over the election field and
the outcome is decided, the valiant Stanford Daily
moves into action. During the entire campaign, our
newspaper brought out no editorial throwing its sup
port to one candidate. This would seem to indicate
an impartial and aloof stand on the election, for opin
ion in a newspaper belongs in a place where it can be
recognized as opinion—in the editorial column. How
ever, while thus maintaining an appearance of neu
trality, the Daily sought to insert its opinions else
where—in "reporting" the facts. Such an article as
the "condensation" of the Ralph-Leanse debate can
only be termed yellow journalism.
We have no objection to the Daily expressing its
views—through the proper channels. We do object to
distortion of the facts and misquoting or half-quoting
to misrepresent.
Nor do we object to the Daily expressing its views at
the proper time. But we cannot condone its ill-timed
attack of May 1!) on a settled issue. Especially when
the attack ignores certain facts.
1) George Ralph ran in opposition to the Con
stitution and its defender. He was elected by a ma
jority of the students in a record-breaking turnout.
No, he cannot "rewrite the Constitution by himself,"
but student interest in revision is certainly indicated
by his election.
2) "You cannot institute reform by yourself,
George." Nor can any reform candidate who is elect
ed. But, by virtue of the majority support behind
him, he can certainly attempt it.
3) "Unless the Legislature will go along with your
reforms, you'll be all by yourself." Reforms must
come from a law-making body, but isn't any law
making body responsible to the voters who gave it
authority? If the representatives in the Legislature
have any concern for the wishes of ihe constituents,
Ralph's reforms must be investigated.
What! Now? Daily. The Daily is now questioning
Ralph's ability to carry through his program. It is
implicating that support will be lacking to him. It is,
in fact, denying its support to him. Isn't it a bit late,
Daily? Is it time to create obstacles to the will of the
majority, or is it time to foster co-operation?
What now. Daily? A professional approach to the
situation, or a whining post-mortem?
What now, Daily.' A positive or a negative approach
to the new administration?

LET'S GET ON THE BALL, GEORGE
For crying out loud, George, haven't you done any
thing yet! Man, don't you realize you've got a man

didn't you? This morning, I looked around, and man.
you haven't changed one damn thing.
By the way, can you make it legal to ride roller

Anyhow, it sure was a ball, wasn't it? But now

Randolph and without him you're nowhere, man. For
I am the editor, the campus mind-molder. And if
you can't get my support, mandate or no mandate,
you're wiped out, you mangy radical.
Can we burn the Daily Shack. George? Can we?
Please say yes. Or just nod. Well, anyway, there
had better be some noise around here by Monday,
because we guys ale really getting bored. If you
haven't shaped this place up by then, you may find
yourself running for Senator.
MICHAEL G. AGATE
To the Editor:
Your editorial in yesterday's Daily was a disgrace.
Without knowing all the facts concerning George
Ralph, you went ahead and attacked our new ASSU
president. All through the campaign and especially
after the debate Monday night, it was apparent that
the "objective" Daily was pulling for Leanse. Your
story and "quotation" coverage were stilted in favor
of anyone but Ralph.
I have been at this university for five years and
have keenly followed all the ASSU elections—all were
covered fairly by your newspaper. Why then was

the campaign coverage of George Ralph stilted?
You also mentioned in your editorial that the
". . . students dissatisfied with their government gave
a majority vote to a new Constitution . , However,
you forgot to add that less than one-third of the
student body voted in that election.
It appears to me that George Ralph really and truly
received a mandate from the students. The student
body will support George's reforms, and for the first
time in at least a decade will pay some attention to
student government.
Instead ol attacking George Ralph, it would have
been more intelligent if you had joined with the rest
ol the student body in wishing him success in in
stituting reforms.
RICHARD J. MEYER
To the Editor:
Your complete lack of sportsmanship and good
taste in writing the editorial on the school election
deserves a few comments.
No doubt you are entitled to your views as to who
was the more desirable candidate, but this is entirely
beside the point. Even in national elections, where
the things at stake are just a little more significant
than in our recent contest, it has always been con
sidered the proper thing to do to congratulate the*
winner, as you have always done in the past. Since
you did not desire to adopt this course of conduct,
you might have shown the restraint of not saying
anything.
Much more important is your opinion that the con
stitution which you so ardently espoused will pre
vent Mr. George from attaining any reform which
the majority of students seem to desire. If this is
true, it doesn't appear to be quite the monument
r.f representative student government that you claim
it to be!
Finally, I've always been disgusted by your smug
superiority complex about the fundamental standard.
It is beyond question a very fine code of life. Per
haps a closer reading of it rather than the constant
patting ourselves on the back can bring the editorials
back to the accepted minimum of decency.
JOHN COHAN
Stanford Daily editorial policy is formulated by
members of the editorial hoard (Editor, Managing
Editor, StalY Editor, and Associates), not by the staff
at large. The bylaws of the ASSU Constitution state
that "the Editor shall have entire control of the
editorial policies of the Stanford Daily . » ."—Ed.
what now, daily?'
To the Editor:
Yesterday The Daily immortalized itself in bad
taste. To criticize publicly the incoming ASSU Presi
dent is both morally wrong and intellectually un
f.ound.
1 say critic ize because under no circumstances could
yesterday's editorial be called unbiased. Indeed, the
whole campaign coveiage was somewhat less than
impartial. The moral wrongness is apparent: Stan
ford University profits not one whit from such an
open attack o«i the policies of the President-elect.
Likewise manifest is the intellectual error. If the
Daily's opposition to George is'genuine (and it was),
the surest way to endear him to the hearts of the
electorate is to show marked partiality again:! him.
Hereafter, when Mr. Man field writes why not title
hi:; column "The Squirrel Cage."
PHILIP OLSON
T<. ihe Editor:
Your candidate for ASSU president has been de
feated. Instead, a man with imagination, a man with
a critical eye has been elected in a landslide. What
now, Daily?
You slanted your news stories and headlines against
the man wh6 was elected by almost two-thirds of
the voters. You said he was opposed to a platform
of increased student interest. (We did not.—Ed).
What now, Daily?
You have always been in favor of cooperation and
good feelings between various segments of student
government. You have always stood for the con
strue tive outlook. Will you now make yourself the
dissenter, the destructive influence to the man whom
an overwhelming majority of the students swept into
office?
For the first time in recent Stanford history a vast,
intense bloc of students have interested themselves in
the mo-.t intricate workings of their own govern
ment. Through the person of the winning candidate
they have shown an ardent desire to question various
phases of student government at Stanford, to cut
away the dead wood, remove the hollow men, and
instill, maybe for a long time to come, an individual
istic, pulsating version of student activities.
Are you going to help out, or was the old system
more to your comfort? What now, Daily?
DON C. WINSTON
To the Editor:
The Daily's "political editorial" of yesterday plumbs
a new depth of unfairness and immature bitterness.

your daf°ers in his back!

To the Editor:
Yesterday The Daily immortalized itself in bad
taste. To criticize publicly the incoming ASSU Presi
dent is both morally wrong and intellectually un
f.ound.
1 say critic ize because under no circumstances could
yesterday's editorial be called unbiased. Indeed, the
whole campaign coveiage was somewhat less than
impartial. The moral wrongness is apparent: Stan
ford University profits not one whit from such an
open attack o«i the policies of the President-elect.
Likewise manifest is the intellectual error. If the
Daily's opposition to George is'genuine (and it was),
the surest way to endear him to the hearts of the
electorate is to show marked partiality again:! him.
Hereafter, when Mr. Man field writes why not title

PHILIP OLSON
T<. ihe Editor:
Your candidate for ASSU president has been de
feated. Instead, a man with imagination, a man with
a critical eye has been elected in a landslide. What
now, Daily?
You slanted your news stories and headlines against
the man wh6 was elected by almost two-thirds of
the voters. You said he was opposed to a platform
of increased student interest. (We did not.—Ed).
What now, Daily?
You have always been in favor of cooperation and
good feelings between various segments of student
government. You have always stood for the con
strue tive outlook. Will you now make yourself the
dissenter, the destructive influence to the man whom
an overwhelming majority of the students swept into
office?
For the first time in recent Stanford history a vast,
intense bloc of students have interested themselves in
the mo-.t intricate workings of their own govern
ment. Through the person of the winning candidate
they have shown an ardent desire to question various
phases of student government at Stanford, to cut
away the dead wood, remove the hollow men, and
instill, maybe for a long time to come, an individual
istic, pulsating version of student activities.
Are you going to help out, or was the old system
more to your comfort? What now, Daily?
DON C. WINSTON

The Daily's "political editorial" of yesterday plumbs

CHUCK MAHLER
ROBERT GILMAN
To the Editor:
The Daily's editorial, "What now, George?" on the
day following the student body election seems (like
so many other Daily editorials) to have missed the
point.
Its harping tone and negative approach is typical
of the childish attitude which has been taken toward
our newly-elected President—a President going into
office with more popular support than any ASSU
President since I have attended Stanford.
Some facts which it ignoies:
1) The student body of Stanford is the sovereign
in our consideration —not the Constitution and not
the legislature. These exist to reflect its will, to get
things done.
2) Far fewer students cared about the Constitu
tion which consumed so much time and caused so
much hot air over nothing this year than about elect
ing a President whom they thought would help them
find their way out of the jungle of red tape, com
mitteeism and general baloney which surrounds their
student body government.
3) The burden of proof lies not with George Ralph
but with the committees and procedures of the ASSU
which must now, and this is a good thing, prove their
worth.
I am an ASSU "bureaucrat" having served on many
boards and committees and would be the first to
maintain that a hard-working, intelligent and level
headed ASSU can provide real student leadership
where and when it is needed. But haggling over petty
appropriations, spending months trying to get our
Constitution in line with that of the political scien
tists' "perfect union" and general wasting time and
getting nothing done—this is not good student gov
ernment and it deserves the protest which it has
received.
We ought to be glad that this election has happened
and that one student had the nerve and the fight to
buck all that we dislike. A,student body as intelli
gent as Stanford's deserves a vital, compact govern
ment and with the honest and generous help of the
Daily and our out-going officers perhaps George
Ralph can accomplish something.
We owe him our thanks and our support.
JACK FRASER
To the Editor:
You've written an editorial. You're the present
editor of the Stanford Daily. What now, Dickie?
In the first place, the bulk of your editorial was
a restatement of facts which have been hashed over
throughout the entire presidential campaign. There
is nothing original but your bitter tone.
Next, we criticize your poor sportsmanship.
Throughout the past two weeks the Daily has shown
its bias by its silence on events which had the whole
campus talking. George Ralph's campaign was ad
mittedly sensational, and he has justified this sen
sationalism to the satisfaction of 2,389 voters. Never
theless, the events of his campaign were news. It was
your duty to record them objectively, but you de
liberately maintained silence, apparently in order
to kill the effect for which he was striving. The
campaign is over now, Dickie, and your bias has
culminated in Thursday's display of poor sportsman
ship.
The Daily exists for the benefit of the students,
and not as a grindstone for the editor's political
axes. You have a right to your opinion, but it
should be expressed in the letters section, rather
than in an unsigned editorial. You seem to think
the Legislature will not accept the new president's
proposed reforms. Remember, the Legislature also
exists for the benefit of the students. You say Ralph
stands alone, Dickie? Not according to 2,389 voters.
We think it's time for you to grow up and become
a big boy now. We're curious to see how you'll
answer this and other letters about your editorial.
What now, Dickie?

ARTHUR BOSWORTH

To the Editor:
In your article entitled "What now, George?" in
the May l£th Daily, you made a statement attacking
by innuendo the validity of George Ralph's "man
date" to attack the new ASSU constitution. You said
further that, "A month ago, students dissatisfied with
their government gave a majority vote to a new
Constitution for ASSU."
These so called "dissatisfied students" were able to
muster up a stampeding herd of 1,200 students to
storm the polls and push through their constitution.
Apparently a large segment of the student body at the
time just didn't care. Despite repeated attempts by
the Daily to bring the constitution to the eyes pf
everyone, very few seemed to read it and fewer yet
actually studied it. George Ralph apparently leads a
group of almost 2,400 students who. dissatisfied with
the 1,200 who voted in the constitution, have voted
in George Ralph to change that constitution.
Albeit that there are many things of to be
said about the new constitution, there are many
things about it which will, I believe, if allowed to
fester unattended, drive student government down
into a mire of eomniitteekin, duplication and use
less work. Although things can be said for a con
stitution modeled on pretty political theories, one that
will work faster, smoother, and with less demand on
students' time has been requested by 2,400 students.
You went on 10 say in your article that "unless
the Legislature will go along with your reforms you'll
be all by yourself, George." Impossible as it is to
attack this statement on its face, I cannot envision
a Legislature representing the Stanford students, in
the face of George's huge .vote, turning a deaf ear to
the voice of the student body.
As to the Daily, instead of trying to point out the
futility of George's task or the evils of any change,
you, as the only published voice of the student body,
should back George to the hilt, or at least to 00
per cent of hilt. Opposition for opposition's sake never
helped government run smoothly or efficiently; it
never helped get anything done.
DICK MALTZMAN
To the Editor:
On Tuesday and Wednesday a record number of
Stanford students went to the polls and elected their
student body president by a convincing majority. On
Thursday the Daily printed an editorial concerning
the results of this election.
Members of the Daily staff (Daily editorial policy
is determined by the editorial board, not the start'
at large.—Ed) may not be in agreement with the ma
jority of the student body, ncr 'with the platform of
the new president. They have every right to their
opinions, but common .sense should restrain them
from printing .such an editorial as appeared Thurs
day. It is neither good policy for a campus news
paper, nor good publicity for Stanford. If this edi
torial policy is to continue throughout the coming
year, if the Daily is going to oppose whatever the
new president wants to do, and set up its own little
oligarchy, it may do so, but it will lose the favor and
respect of many people.
We have a new president, elected by 2,1389 people.
Let's back him up and help make his year successful,
not try to run him into the ground at the first turn.
POLLY McDONALD
To the Editor:
What Now, George? In your editorial you point out
that George can't put his reforms into effect without
the assistance of the Legislature. Theoretically, at
least, we adopt the notion in this country that our
governing body, the Legislature, puts into effect the
will of the majority. If we assume therefore that
George was elected by a majority of the student body
who desired reform in student government, then
doesn't it follow that the Legislature, reflecting the
views of the majority of the students, should and must
go along with George?
Practically, you could make an argument that Leg
islatures often don't echo the sentiments of the ma
jority they represent; but query whether this is the
practice which Legislatures should follow, and query
whether Legislatures consistently disregard the will
of their constituents.
If the student Legislature at Stanford does, as you
suggest, what it wills, then student government is run
by a bunch of despots, and it is high time for reform.
BILL FERNANDEZ
To the Editor:
Well, as the dust settles over the election field and
the outcome is decided, the valiant Stanford Daily
moves into action. During the entire campaign, our
newspaper brought out no editorial throwing its sup
port to one candidate. This would seem to indicate
an impartial and aloof stand on the election, for opin
ion in a newspaper belongs in a place where it can be
recognized as opinion—in the editorial column. How
ever, while thus maintaining an appearance of neu
trality, the Daily sought to insert its opinions else
where—in "reporting" the facts. Such an article as
the "condensation" of the Ralph-Leanse debate can
only be termed yellow journalism.
We have no objection to the Daily expressing its
views—through the proper channels. We do object to
distortion of the facts and misquoting or half-quoting
to misrepresent.
Nor do we object to the Daily expressing its views at
the proper time. But we cannot condone its ill-timed
attack of May 1!) on a settled issue. Especially when
the attack ignores certain facts.
1) George Ralph ran in opposition to the Con
stitution and its defender. He was elected by a ma
jority of the students in a record-breaking turnout.
No, he cannot "rewrite the Constitution by himself,"
but student interest in revision is certainly indicated
by his election.
2) "You cannot institute reform by yourself,
George." Nor can any reform candidate who is elect
ed. But, by virtue of the majority support behind
him, he can certainly attempt it.
3) "Unless the Legislature will go along with your
reforms, you'll be all by yourself." Reforms must
come from a law-making body, but isn't any law
making body responsible to the voters who gave it
authority? If the representatives in the Legislature
have any concern for the wishes of ihe constituents,
Ralph's reforms must be investigated.
What! Now? Daily. The Daily is now questioning
Ralph's ability to carry through his program. It is
implicating that support will be lacking to him. It is,
in fact, denying its support to him. Isn't it a bit late,
Daily? Is it time to create obstacles to the will of the
majority, or is it time to foster co-operation?
What now. Daily? A professional approach to the
situation, or a whining post-mortem?
What now, Daily.' A positive or a negative approach
to the new administration?

For crying out loud, George, haven't you done any
thing yet! Man, don't you realize you've got a man
date for reform? Well, what's the matter? You won,
didn't you? This morning, I looked around, and man.
you haven't changed one damn thing.
By the way, can you make it legal to ride roller

Anyhow, it sure was a ball, wasn't it? But now
you're all alone. I'll bet you think I'm kidding, Lut
I'm not. I didn't think so either until 1 read the Daily

you're alone, and boy, if he says you're alone, man,
you're all alone. I mean you've got me and 2,388
others for sure but you ain't got Richard William
Randolph and without him you're nowhere, man. For
I am the editor, the campus mind-molder. And if
you can't get my support, mandate or no mandate,
you're wiped out, you mangy radical.
Can we burn the Daily Shack. George? Can we?
Please say yes. Or just nod. Well, anyway, there
had better be some noise around here by Monday,
because we guys ale really getting bored. If you
haven't shaped this place up by then, you may find
yourself running for Senator.
MICHAEL G. AGATE
To the Editor:
Your editorial in yesterday's Daily was a disgrace.
Without knowing all the facts concerning George
Ralph, you went ahead and attacked our new ASSU
president. All through the campaign and especially
after the debate Monday night, it was apparent that
the "objective" Daily was pulling for Leanse. Your
story and "quotation" coverage were stilted in favor
of anyone but Ralph.
I have been at this university for five years and
have keenly followed all the ASSU elections—all were
covered fairly by your newspaper. Why then was

the campaign coverage of George Ralph stilted?
You also mentioned in your editorial that the
". . . students dissatisfied with their government gave
a majority vote to a new Constitution . , However,
you forgot to add that less than one-third of the
student body voted in that election.
It appears to me that George Ralph really and truly
received a mandate from the students. The student
body will support George's reforms, and for the first
time in at least a decade will pay some attention to
student government.
Instead ol attacking George Ralph, it would have
been more intelligent if you had joined with the rest
ol the student body in wishing him success in in
stituting reforms.
RICHARD J. MEYER
To the Editor:
Your complete lack of sportsmanship and good
taste in writing the editorial on the school election
deserves a few comments.
No doubt you are entitled to your views as to who
was the more desirable candidate, but this is entirely
beside the point. Even in national elections, where
the things at stake are just a little more significant
than in our recent contest, it has always been con
sidered the proper thing to do to congratulate the*
winner, as you have always done in the past. Since
you did not desire to adopt this course of conduct,
you might have shown the restraint of not saying
anything.
Much more important is your opinion that the con
stitution which you so ardently espoused will pre
vent Mr. George from attaining any reform which
the majority of students seem to desire. If this is
true, it doesn't appear to be quite the monument
r.f representative student government that you claim
it to be!
Finally, I've always been disgusted by your smug
superiority complex about the fundamental standard.
It is beyond question a very fine code of life. Per
haps a closer reading of it rather than the constant
patting ourselves on the back can bring the editorials
back to the accepted minimum of decency.

you're alone, and boy, if he says you're alone, man,
you're all alone. I mean you've got me and 2,388
others for sure but you ain't got Richard William
Randolph and without him you're nowhere, man. For
I am the editor, the campus mind-molder. And if
you can't get my support, mandate or no mandate,
you're wiped out, you mangy radical.
Can we burn the Daily Shack. George? Can we?
Please say yes. Or just nod. Well, anyway, there
had better be some noise around here by Monday,
because we guys ale really getting bored. If you
haven't shaped this place up by then, you may find
yourself running for Senator.
MICHAEL G. AGATE
To the Editor:
Your editorial in yesterday's Daily was a disgrace.
Without knowing all the facts concerning George
Ralph, you went ahead and attacked our new ASSU
president. All through the campaign and especially
after the debate Monday night, it was apparent that
the "objective" Daily was pulling for Leanse. Your
story and "quotation" coverage were stilted in favor
of anyone but Ralph.
I have been at this university for five years and
have keenly followed all the ASSU elections—all were
covered fairly by your newspaper. Why then was

the campaign coverage of George Ralph stilted?
You also mentioned in your editorial that the
". . . students dissatisfied with their government gave
a majority vote to a new Constitution . , However,
you forgot to add that less than one-third of the
student body voted in that election.
It appears to me that George Ralph really and truly
received a mandate from the students. The student
body will support George's reforms, and for the first
time in at least a decade will pay some attention to
student government.
Instead ol attacking George Ralph, it would have
been more intelligent if you had joined with the rest
ol the student body in wishing him success in in
stituting reforms.
RICHARD J. MEYER
To the Editor:
Your complete lack of sportsmanship and good
taste in writing the editorial on the school election
deserves a few comments.
No doubt you are entitled to your views as to who
was the more desirable candidate, but this is entirely
beside the point. Even in national elections, where
the things at stake are just a little more significant
than in our recent contest, it has always been con
sidered the proper thing to do to congratulate the*
winner, as you have always done in the past. Since
you did not desire to adopt this course of conduct,
you might have shown the restraint of not saying
anything.
Much more important is your opinion that the con
stitution which you so ardently espoused will pre
vent Mr. George from attaining any reform which
the majority of students seem to desire. If this is
true, it doesn't appear to be quite the monument
r.f representative student government that you claim
it to be!
Finally, I've always been disgusted by your smug
superiority complex about the fundamental standard.
It is beyond question a very fine code of life. Per
haps a closer reading of it rather than the constant
patting ourselves on the back can bring the editorials
back to the accepted minimum of decency.

Stanford Daily editorial policy is formulated by

at large. The bylaws of the ASSU Constitution state
that "the Editor shall have entire control of the

what now, daily?'
To the Editor:
Yesterday The Daily immortalized itself in bad
taste. To criticize publicly the incoming ASSU Presi
dent is both morally wrong and intellectually un
f.ound.
1 say critic ize because under no circumstances could
yesterday's editorial be called unbiased. Indeed, the
whole campaign coveiage was somewhat less than
impartial. The moral wrongness is apparent: Stan
ford University profits not one whit from such an
open attack o«i the policies of the President-elect.
Likewise manifest is the intellectual error. If the
Daily's opposition to George is'genuine (and it was),
the surest way to endear him to the hearts of the
electorate is to show marked partiality again:! him.
Hereafter, when Mr. Man field writes why not title

PHILIP OLSON
T<. ihe Editor:
Your candidate for ASSU president has been de
feated. Instead, a man with imagination, a man with
a critical eye has been elected in a landslide. What
now, Daily?
You slanted your news stories and headlines against
the man wh6 was elected by almost two-thirds of
the voters. You said he was opposed to a platform
of increased student interest. (We did not.—Ed).
What now, Daily?
You have always been in favor of cooperation and
good feelings between various segments of student
government. You have always stood for the con
strue tive outlook. Will you now make yourself the
dissenter, the destructive influence to the man whom
an overwhelming majority of the students swept into
office?
For the first time in recent Stanford history a vast,
intense bloc of students have interested themselves in
the mo-.t intricate workings of their own govern
ment. Through the person of the winning candidate
they have shown an ardent desire to question various
phases of student government at Stanford, to cut
away the dead wood, remove the hollow men, and
instill, maybe for a long time to come, an individual
istic, pulsating version of student activities.
Are you going to help out, or was the old system
more to your comfort? What now, Daily?
DON C. WINSTON
To the Editor:
The Daily's "political editorial" of yesterday plumbs
a new depth of unfairness and immature bitterness.

CHUCK MAHLER
ROBERT GILMAN
To the Editor:
The Daily's editorial, "What now, George?" on the
day following the student body election seems (like
so many other Daily editorials) to have missed the
point.
Its harping tone and negative approach is typical
of the childish attitude which has been taken toward
our newly-elected President—a President going into
office with more popular support than any ASSU
President since I have attended Stanford.
Some facts which it ignoies:
1) The student body of Stanford is the sovereign
in our consideration —not the Constitution and not
the legislature. These exist to reflect its will, to get
things done.
2) Far fewer students cared about the Constitu
tion which consumed so much time and caused so
much hot air over nothing this year than about elect
ing a President whom they thought would help them
find their way out of the jungle of red tape, com
mitteeism and general baloney which surrounds their
student body government.
3) The burden of proof lies not with George Ralph
but with the committees and procedures of the ASSU
which must now, and this is a good thing, prove their
worth.
I am an ASSU "bureaucrat" having served on many
boards and committees and would be the first to
maintain that a hard-working, intelligent and level
headed ASSU can provide real student leadership
where and when it is needed. But haggling over petty
appropriations, spending months trying to get our
Constitution in line with that of the political scien
tists' "perfect union" and general wasting time and
getting nothing done—this is not good student gov
ernment and it deserves the protest which it has
received.
We ought to be glad that this election has happened
and that one student had the nerve and the fight to
buck all that we dislike. A,student body as intelli
gent as Stanford's deserves a vital, compact govern
ment and with the honest and generous help of the
Daily and our out-going officers perhaps George
Ralph can accomplish something.
We owe him our thanks and our support.
JACK FRASER
To the Editor:
You've written an editorial. You're the present
editor of the Stanford Daily. What now, Dickie?
In the first place, the bulk of your editorial was
a restatement of facts which have been hashed over
throughout the entire presidential campaign. There
is nothing original but your bitter tone.
Next, we criticize your poor sportsmanship.
Throughout the past two weeks the Daily has shown
its bias by its silence on events which had the whole
campus talking. George Ralph's campaign was ad
mittedly sensational, and he has justified this sen
sationalism to the satisfaction of 2,389 voters. Never
theless, the events of his campaign were news. It was
your duty to record them objectively, but you de
liberately maintained silence, apparently in order
to kill the effect for which he was striving. The
campaign is over now, Dickie, and your bias has
culminated in Thursday's display of poor sportsman
ship.
The Daily exists for the benefit of the students,
and not as a grindstone for the editor's political
axes. You have a right to your opinion, but it
should be expressed in the letters section, rather
than in an unsigned editorial. You seem to think
the Legislature will not accept the new president's
proposed reforms. Remember, the Legislature also
exists for the benefit of the students. You say Ralph
stands alone, Dickie? Not according to 2,389 voters.
We think it's time for you to grow up and become
a big boy now. We're curious to see how you'll
answer this and other letters about your editorial.
What now, Dickie?
PATRICK MADDEN GUS BLAISDBLL

ARTHUR BOSWORTH

To the Editor:
In your article entitled "What now, George?" in
the May l£th Daily, you made a statement attacking
by innuendo the validity of George Ralph's "man
date" to attack the new ASSU constitution. You said
further that, "A month ago, students dissatisfied with
their government gave a majority vote to a new
Constitution for ASSU."
These so called "dissatisfied students" were able to
muster up a stampeding herd of 1,200 students to
storm the polls and push through their constitution.
Apparently a large segment of the student body at the
time just didn't care. Despite repeated attempts by
the Daily to bring the constitution to the eyes pf
everyone, very few seemed to read it and fewer yet
actually studied it. George Ralph apparently leads a
group of almost 2,400 students who. dissatisfied with
the 1,200 who voted in the constitution, have voted
in George Ralph to change that constitution.
Albeit that there are many things of to be
said about the new constitution, there are many
things about it which will, I believe, if allowed to
fester unattended, drive student government down
into a mire of eomniitteekin, duplication and use
less work. Although things can be said for a con
stitution modeled on pretty political theories, one that
will work faster, smoother, and with less demand on
students' time has been requested by 2,400 students.
You went on 10 say in your article that "unless
the Legislature will go along with your reforms you'll
be all by yourself, George." Impossible as it is to
attack this statement on its face, I cannot envision
a Legislature representing the Stanford students, in
the face of George's huge .vote, turning a deaf ear to
the voice of the student body.
As to the Daily, instead of trying to point out the
futility of George's task or the evils of any change,
you, as the only published voice of the student body,
should back George to the hilt, or at least to 00
per cent of hilt. Opposition for opposition's sake never
helped government run smoothly or efficiently; it
never helped get anything done.
DICK MALTZMAN
To the Editor:
On Tuesday and Wednesday a record number of
Stanford students went to the polls and elected their
student body president by a convincing majority. On
Thursday the Daily printed an editorial concerning
the results of this election.
Members of the Daily staff (Daily editorial policy
is determined by the editorial board, not the start'
at large.—Ed) may not be in agreement with the ma
jority of the student body, ncr 'with the platform of
the new president. They have every right to their
opinions, but common .sense should restrain them
from printing .such an editorial as appeared Thurs
day. It is neither good policy for a campus news
paper, nor good publicity for Stanford. If this edi
torial policy is to continue throughout the coming
year, if the Daily is going to oppose whatever the
new president wants to do, and set up its own little
oligarchy, it may do so, but it will lose the favor and
respect of many people.
We have a new president, elected by 2,1389 people.
Let's back him up and help make his year successful,
not try to run him into the ground at the first turn.
POLLY McDONALD
To the Editor:
What Now, George? In your editorial you point out
that George can't put his reforms into effect without
the assistance of the Legislature. Theoretically, at
least, we adopt the notion in this country that our
governing body, the Legislature, puts into effect the
will of the majority. If we assume therefore that
George was elected by a majority of the student body
who desired reform in student government, then
doesn't it follow that the Legislature, reflecting the
views of the majority of the students, should and must
go along with George?
Practically, you could make an argument that Leg
islatures often don't echo the sentiments of the ma
jority they represent; but query whether this is the
practice which Legislatures should follow, and query
whether Legislatures consistently disregard the will
of their constituents.
If the student Legislature at Stanford does, as you
suggest, what it wills, then student government is run
by a bunch of despots, and it is high time for reform.
BILL FERNANDEZ
To the Editor:
Well, as the dust settles over the election field and
the outcome is decided, the valiant Stanford Daily
moves into action. During the entire campaign, our
newspaper brought out no editorial throwing its sup
port to one candidate. This would seem to indicate
an impartial and aloof stand on the election, for opin
ion in a newspaper belongs in a place where it can be
recognized as opinion—in the editorial column. How
ever, while thus maintaining an appearance of neu
trality, the Daily sought to insert its opinions else
where—in "reporting" the facts. Such an article as
the "condensation" of the Ralph-Leanse debate can
only be termed yellow journalism.
We have no objection to the Daily expressing its
views—through the proper channels. We do object to
distortion of the facts and misquoting or half-quoting
to misrepresent.
Nor do we object to the Daily expressing its views at
the proper time. But we cannot condone its ill-timed
attack of May 1!) on a settled issue. Especially when
the attack ignores certain facts.
1) George Ralph ran in opposition to the Con
stitution and its defender. He was elected by a ma
jority of the students in a record-breaking turnout.
No, he cannot "rewrite the Constitution by himself,"
but student interest in revision is certainly indicated
by his election.
2) "You cannot institute reform by yourself,
George." Nor can any reform candidate who is elect
ed. But, by virtue of the majority support behind
him, he can certainly attempt it.
3) "Unless the Legislature will go along with your
reforms, you'll be all by yourself." Reforms must
come from a law-making body, but isn't any law
making body responsible to the voters who gave it
authority? If the representatives in the Legislature
have any concern for the wishes of ihe constituents,
Ralph's reforms must be investigated.
What! Now? Daily. The Daily is now questioning
Ralph's ability to carry through his program. It is
implicating that support will be lacking to him. It is,
in fact, denying its support to him. Isn't it a bit late,
Daily? Is it time to create obstacles to the will of the
majority, or is it time to foster co-operation?
What now. Daily? A professional approach to the
situation, or a whining post-mortem?
What now, Daily.' A positive or a negative approach
to the new administration?

We have no objection to the Daily expressing its
views—through the proper channels. We do object to
distortion of the facts and misquoting or half-quoting
to misrepresent.
Nor do we object to the Daily expressing its views at
the proper time. But we cannot condone its ill-timed
attack of May 1!) on a settled issue. Especially when
the attack ignores certain facts.
1) George Ralph ran in opposition to the Con
stitution and its defender. He was elected by a ma
jority of the students in a record-breaking turnout.
No, he cannot "rewrite the Constitution by himself,"
but student interest in revision is certainly indicated
by his election.
2) "You cannot institute reform by yourself,
George." Nor can any reform candidate who is elect
ed. But, by virtue of the majority support behind
him, he can certainly attempt it.
3) "Unless the Legislature will go along with your
reforms, you'll be all by yourself." Reforms must
come from a law-making body, but isn't any law
making body responsible to the voters who gave it
authority? If the representatives in the Legislature
have any concern for the wishes of ihe constituents,
Ralph's reforms must be investigated.
What! Now? Daily. The Daily is now questioning
Ralph's ability to carry through his program. It is
implicating that support will be lacking to him. It is,
in fact, denying its support to him. Isn't it a bit late,
Daily? Is it time to create obstacles to the will of the
majority, or is it time to foster co-operation?
What now. Daily? A professional approach to the
situation, or a whining post-mortem?
What now, Daily.' A positive or a negative approach
to the new administration?

To the Editor:
LET'S GET ON THE BALL, GEORGE
For crying out loud, George, haven't you done any
thing yet! Man, don't you realize you've got a man
date for reform? Well, what's the matter? You won,
didn't you? This morning, I looked around, and man.
you haven't changed one damn thing.
By the way, can you make it legal to ride roller
skates on Inner Quad? And, hey. Can we elimi
nate the Department of Athletics? No, 1 rcaily mean
it. 1 really do. I didn't make the varsity last year,
see, and I'm really teed-off.
Well, anyway, I'm just one of those 2,!iH9 who dur
ing some inexplicable neurotic upsurge latched your
square. Hey, that was pretty funny: "scratched your
square."
Anyhow, it sure was a ball, wasn't it? But now
you're all alone. I'll bet you think I'm kidding, Lut
I'm not. I didn't think so either until 1 read the Daily
this morning. I can read. I rcaily can. Did you read
that article by Richard William Randolph? He says
you're alone, and boy, if he says you're alone, man,
you're all alone. I mean you've got me and 2,388
others for sure but you ain't got Richard William
Randolph and without him you're nowhere, man. For
I am the editor, the campus mind-molder. And if
you can't get my support, mandate or no mandate,
you're wiped out, you mangy radical.
Can we burn the Daily Shack. George? Can we?
Please say yes. Or just nod. Well, anyway, there
had better be some noise around here by Monday,
because we guys ale really getting bored. If you
haven't shaped this place up by then, you may find
yourself running for Senator.

To the Editor:
Your editorial in yesterday's Daily was a disgrace.
Without knowing all the facts concerning George
Ralph, you went ahead and attacked our new ASSU
president. All through the campaign and especially
after the debate Monday night, it was apparent that
the "objective" Daily was pulling for Leanse. Your
story and "quotation" coverage were stilted in favor
of anyone but Ralph.
I have been at this university for five years and
have keenly followed all the ASSU elections—all were
covered fairly by your newspaper. Why then was

the campaign coverage of George Ralph stilted?
You also mentioned in your editorial that the
". . . students dissatisfied with their government gave
a majority vote to a new Constitution . , However,
you forgot to add that less than one-third of the
student body voted in that election.
It appears to me that George Ralph really and truly
received a mandate from the students. The student
body will support George's reforms, and for the first
time in at least a decade will pay some attention to
student government.
Instead ol attacking George Ralph, it would have
been more intelligent if you had joined with the rest
ol the student body in wishing him success in in
stituting reforms.

To the Editor:
Your complete lack of sportsmanship and good
taste in writing the editorial on the school election
deserves a few comments.
No doubt you are entitled to your views as to who
was the more desirable candidate, but this is entirely
beside the point. Even in national elections, where
the things at stake are just a little more significant
than in our recent contest, it has always been con
sidered the proper thing to do to congratulate the*
winner, as you have always done in the past. Since
you did not desire to adopt this course of conduct,
you might have shown the restraint of not saying
anything.
Much more important is your opinion that the con
stitution which you so ardently espoused will pre
vent Mr. George from attaining any reform which
the majority of students seem to desire. If this is
true, it doesn't appear to be quite the monument
r.f representative student government that you claim
it to be!
Finally, I've always been disgusted by your smug
superiority complex about the fundamental standard.
It is beyond question a very fine code of life. Per
haps a closer reading of it rather than the constant
patting ourselves on the back can bring the editorials
back to the accepted minimum of decency.
