# U.S. Intelligence Service Is Powerful, Says Briton

"The United States Intelligence Service is rapidly becoming one
of the most useful and powerful in the world," Donald Stokes, of
the British Information Service said yesterday afternoon to a group
of students at Bowman Alumni House.
"Espionage is at a higher pitch than ever before, and it is espe-

cially important today because if we
are to become engaged in another
full-scale war, it will undoubtedly be
a war of extermination where few
or none of us here will be around
to tell about it."
Stokes explained that the under
cover agent now plays a minor role
in the intelligence service. The main
work is done by a small body of
highly trained experts whose job it is
to bring together and evaluate a tor
rent of small, unconnected facts, ac
cording to Stokes.
As an example of this, Stokes told
the story of a hidden German fac
tory, during World War 11, whose
position was located by means of
clues found in a letter on a dead
German officer, a business transac
tion in Argentina, a time change in
a railway schedule, aerial photo
graphs of a German town, and a let
ter in a small German daily.
The espionage agent, said Stokes,
acquires, through long practice, a
sort of sixth sense about pieces of
information that are likely to pay ofT.
'"The United States," is stated,
"is notably not security conscious.
There is an old joke in the British
Information Service that the easiest
way to collect American secrets is
to take out a subscription to Life
Magazine, and to a certain extent,
that's true. America is certainly the
easiest country in the world to spy
on."
In the course of his speech Stokes
made the remark that one of the
dangerous things about China is her
lack of an espionage system. China,
he said, would probably never have
been willing to engage the United
States in Korea if Russia had not
assured her that we would be easy
to defeat. It would be to Russia's
advantage to encourage a conflict be
tween China and the U.S. and there
fore very dangerous for us that China
obtains all her information about the
West's strength through Russian
channels.
