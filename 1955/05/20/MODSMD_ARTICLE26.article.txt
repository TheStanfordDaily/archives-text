# Tennis Team Tangles With Bruins, Trojans
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
It's going to be a big, tough weekend for the Stanford tennis
team. It starts this afternoon when the big, tough UCLA Bruins in
invade the varsity courts at 1:00. And it gets worse when the even
bigger and tougher USC Trojans take to the courts at 1:00 to
morrow.
In the Southland excursion earlier this season the Indians, play-

ing badly, were smothered by these
squads 7-2 and 9-0 respectively.
This time the Cards have some
what better prospects. Against a
first-rate Modesto JC team the rack
etmen probably made their best
team effort of the season earlier this
week.
A lot will depend on the erratic
Indian captain, Jack Frost. Last
week in the state championships
Frost looked like a champion.
Against Modesto this week he
looked like a recruit from the ele
mentary tennis class. He'll have to
be at his best today and tomorrow.
Besides Frost, Coach Bob Renker
will play Ernie Dußray, Dave Duff.
Bob Prince and Roger Keesing.
Henry Sutcliffe will probably get
the nod over Bob Norton for the
other singles spot on the basis of his
performance against Modesto. Nor
ton should play in one of the doub
les tandems.
UCLA will bring up Dick Doss,
Joe Blatchford, Stan Canter, Jimmy
Read, Brooke Grant, and Dwight
Makoff.
SC will rely on Jacque Grigry,
Pancho Contreras, A 1 Call, Joaquin
Reyes, Jim Perley, . Dick Haskell,

and Allen Cleveland.
Renker hinted that he might
§hake up his doubles lineup. The
Indians are going all out for a win
over UCLA this afternoon, but they

through with a win over Canter.
