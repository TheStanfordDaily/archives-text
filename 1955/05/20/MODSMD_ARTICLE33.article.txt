# Bruins Test Card Crew
## 
### 
Stanford's smooth-stroking varsity
crew will put its unbeaten record
on the line tomorrow afternoon
when the UCLA Bruins challeneg
the Indians in a three-mile test on
the Redwood City Harbor course.
The day's festivities will get under
way at 10:30 a.m. when the two
frosh eights will battle it out over
an abbreviated two-mile run. The
Card yearlings are undefeated and
will be the favorites tomorrow to
capture their fourth victory of the
season.
Immediately alter the opening
contest is finished the Bruin JV
boat will tangle with their Indian
counterparts and this will also be
over the two - mile course. The
Braves are greatly improved since
their narrow win over USC a month
ago and many expect this one to be
the closest race of the day.
The concluding and featured con
test of the program will pit the sea
soned Indian shell against the fast
improving Bruin varsity. The race
will be the first three-miler of the
season for the Cards while the boys
from down south already have two
long-distance contests under their
belts. Coach Lindsey of the Indans
expects this race to be a good test
for his boys in preparation for their
three-mile race against Cal.
