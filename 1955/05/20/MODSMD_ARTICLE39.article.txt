# Jumping Frogs Come Out of Hiding
## 
### 
OUR JUBILEE JUMPERS â€”Here they are in their first public ap
pearance, Stanford's representatives for the Calaveras Frog
Jumping Jubilee. They've just arrived at Stern Hall from their
special training quarters for the "final touches." The big fellow
on the left is The Wiggler, and on the right, Cockamoon, the big
championship hope. Another entry, Jack Squat, is too shy for
the camera. The Jubilee begins this weekend, but the frogs are
ready after three months' intensive training.
