WASHINGTON — The House
d topped President Eisenhower's
new compulsory military reserve
program like a hot potato today af
ter members refused to kill an anti

segregation proviso strongly opposed
by Southern lawmakers.
The move postponed action on the
measure indefinitely — possibly for
good—although some of its backers
promised to try to get it through
later this session.
Representative Ovferton Brooks
called it "unthinkable" that the na
tion "could go without an adequate
reserve." The bill would enforce
service in the reserves, now fre
\ quently neglected, by providing stiff
i penalties for failure to train.
