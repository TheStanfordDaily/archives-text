# Shapiro Breaks Mold of Stereotyped Modern Poet
## 
### STEW TOY 
Few modern poets act less like
modern poets than Karl Shapiro,
but his readings for the Intermezzo
series yesterday afternoon in the
Bender Room proved, as if it were
again necessary, that he is one of the
best of them.
Shapiro, currently a visiting pro
fessor at the University of Califor
nia, has the speech and the manner
of a prosperous, middle-aged busi
nessman, straight from a Marquand
novel.
His voice is extremely pleasant
and un-"poetic," almost fatherly,
full of the sympathetic, "trustwor
thy" qualities of a doctor or min
ister.
This aura of friendly omniscience
seems to spill over into his work;
for when listening to his poems, one
senses Shapiro's profound but un
pedantic knowledge of what he's
talking about.
Shapiro's poetry is the kind you
trust. When he speaks of his dying
friend in "A Figurehead." you know
that this is the way it feels to die.
In his epic series on Adam and

Eve—"The Sickness of Adam," "The
Recognition of Eve," "The Kiss,"
"Tree of Guilt," "The Confession,"
"Shame," and "Exile" — Shapiro
seems especially to be saying, "I
was there, and this is the way it
was."
He achieves this strange authen
ticity by a potent mixture of narra
tive description and rich imagery,
commanding the listener's attention
so much by the beautiful accuracy
of his words that he is left no time
to doubt.
Shapiro uses this ability to fine
advantage in his new poem, "Cadil
lac." One monstrous, branching
metaphor, it mildly satirizes a high
ly satirical American institution.
Shapiro's other readings included
"The Dome of Sunday," "Going to
Schocfl," and "University."
