# Show-down Seen In Congress Vote
## 
### 
WASHINGTONâ€”President Eisen
hower challenged the Democratic
controlled 84th Congress to an all
out test of strength today by veto
ing an average 8.8 per cent pay
hike for the nation's 500,000 postal
employees.
Democratic leaders promptly
moved to meet the challenge. A
show-down vote on overriding the
veto was scheduled for next Tues
day in the Senate, first to act on the
issue.
Informed sources predicted the
Senate vote will be "very close"
despite the chamber's original GO to
11 majority for the pay raise.
