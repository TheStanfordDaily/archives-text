# RALPH INTERVIEW
## 'Obviously Reform: They Voted for It,' Says Ralph 
### DICK MEISTER 
A new voting record was set at Stanford this week. Sixty per
cent of the student body turned out at the polls, topping the high
est previous record by 15 per cent. Almost 4,000 students voted
and sixty per cent of these 4,000 voters marked their ballots for
George Ralph, the new ASSU president.
With such a turnout it's evident that the Ralph campaign was

1-
ry out his ideas —Ideas which he says
will come from the student majority
which elected him ASSU president
by a 849 vote lead.
Ralph says he will depend more on
the small group representatives for
' his "pulse of the people." These
! people, he says, are closer to the in-
I dividual and know his needs better.
CONSTITUTIONAL VOTE
i"The small 25 per cent vote on the
recent constitutional change is in
dicative that not enough students are
being reached by student govern
ment to gain sufficient interest . . .
what do the other 75 per cent think?"
Ralph feels that the cabinet should
' not be abolished, but that it should
! be developed into a real legislative
body. And he feels that it gives
| better student representation than
| the old Executive Committee.
''Activity for activity's sake is fine,
I but not in student government."
i Ralph wants to work more for re
sults than for the benefits of activity.
He feels that too few people are
doing too many things committee
wise in the government. He wants
to spread committee work among
more students.
NO IMPASSE
Ralph sees no impasse between
himself and any other campus
groups, in government or out, and
expects "to work with the Legisla
ture and representatives in as much
an air of cordiality as possible."
He sees the public relations role
j of a president as important since,
i"The president is one of the few stu
j dents who have the opportunity to
i represent the Stanford student body
to outsiders and to the administra-
I tion."
"Above all, whatever I do in the
: way of reform will have student
j backing and ... I plan nothing rash."

responsible in great part for the'*
record vote. But the student is ask
ing himself now what led to the
campaign, with its unusual approach,
and what brought Ralph to his de
cision to run in what was undoubt
edly the most colorful and exciting
campaign in ASSU history.
Ralph says that he had planned
on running for the presidency as
long ago as last spring.
"I, myself, felt untouched by stu
dent government, and I knew a lot
of others felt the same ... I asked
myself why?"
The new president thought that
people who felt this way wanted re
forms in the usual set-up, wanted a
chance to be heard.
GOVERNMENT GOAL
''Student government shouldn't
have as its prime goal the teaching
of its members to become better
organizers or to get along better with
each other. Rather, its prime goal
should be to accomplish results for
the people who aren't the leaders of
student government but who the
student government should work for
—those who have felt untouched by
the government."
And what reforms does Ralph pro
pose for revitalizing the approach to
student government?
"I'll talk with my associates and
investigate what's necessary . . . and
what students want. Obviously they
want reform, they voted for it."
Ralph is still busy accepting con
gratulations and adjusting to his new
role and says that he can't make any
specific statements on any of his
plans.
CAMPAIGN APPROACH
The unusual success of his cam
paign was due to the unique ap
proach that he used, according to
the president.
"At first I used the extreme ap
proach—a gimmick—to get original
interest up."
Ralph felt that this was the only
method of getting himself in the
public eye, in the minds of those
v/ho felt, like him, that they were
untouched by student government in
its present set-up.
He was clearly gunning for a win
and once he got the voters' initial
support by primary election, Ralph
purposely changed to a more ortho
dox approach and picked up even
j more interest.
Now that he's in office the new
president realizes that he will be
| closely watched to see if he can car-

ry out his ideas —Ideas which he says
will come from the student majority
which elected him ASSU president
by a 849 vote lead.
Ralph says he will depend more on
the small group representatives for
' his "pulse of the people." These
! people, he says, are closer to the in-
I dividual and know his needs better.
CONSTITUTIONAL VOTE
i"The small 25 per cent vote on the
recent constitutional change is in
dicative that not enough students are
being reached by student govern
ment to gain sufficient interest . . .
what do the other 75 per cent think?"
Ralph feels that the cabinet should
' not be abolished, but that it should
! be developed into a real legislative
body. And he feels that it gives
| better student representation than
| the old Executive Committee.
''Activity for activity's sake is fine,
I but not in student government."
i Ralph wants to work more for re
sults than for the benefits of activity.
He feels that too few people are
doing too many things committee
wise in the government. He wants
to spread committee work among
more students.
NO IMPASSE
Ralph sees no impasse between
himself and any other campus
groups, in government or out, and
expects "to work with the Legisla
ture and representatives in as much
an air of cordiality as possible."
He sees the public relations role
j of a president as important since,
i"The president is one of the few stu
j dents who have the opportunity to
i represent the Stanford student body
to outsiders and to the administra-
I tion."
"Above all, whatever I do in the
: way of reform will have student
j backing and ... I plan nothing rash."

responsible in great part for the'*
record vote. But the student is ask
ing himself now what led to the
campaign, with its unusual approach,
and what brought Ralph to his de
cision to run in what was undoubt
edly the most colorful and exciting
campaign in ASSU history.
Ralph says that he had planned
on running for the presidency as
long ago as last spring.
"I, myself, felt untouched by stu
dent government, and I knew a lot
of others felt the same ... I asked
myself why?"
The new president thought that
people who felt this way wanted re
forms in the usual set-up, wanted a
chance to be heard.
GOVERNMENT GOAL
''Student government shouldn't
have as its prime goal the teaching
of its members to become better
organizers or to get along better with
each other. Rather, its prime goal
should be to accomplish results for
the people who aren't the leaders of
student government but who the
student government should work for
—those who have felt untouched by
the government."
And what reforms does Ralph pro
pose for revitalizing the approach to
student government?
"I'll talk with my associates and
investigate what's necessary . . . and
what students want. Obviously they
want reform, they voted for it."
Ralph is still busy accepting con
gratulations and adjusting to his new
role and says that he can't make any
specific statements on any of his
plans.
CAMPAIGN APPROACH
The unusual success of his cam
paign was due to the unique ap
proach that he used, according to
the president.
"At first I used the extreme ap
proach—a gimmick—to get original
interest up."
Ralph felt that this was the only
method of getting himself in the
public eye, in the minds of those
v/ho felt, like him, that they were
untouched by student government in
its present set-up.
He was clearly gunning for a win
and once he got the voters' initial
support by primary election, Ralph

recent constitutional change is in
dicative that not enough students are
being reached by student govern
ment to gain sufficient interest . . .
what do the other 75 per cent think?"
Ralph feels that the cabinet should
' not be abolished, but that it should
! be developed into a real legislative
body. And he feels that it gives
| better student representation than
| the old Executive Committee.
''Activity for activity's sake is fine,
I but not in student government."
i Ralph wants to work more for re
sults than for the benefits of activity.
He feels that too few people are
doing too many things committee
wise in the government. He wants
to spread committee work among
more students.
NO IMPASSE
Ralph sees no impasse between
himself and any other campus
groups, in government or out, and
expects "to work with the Legisla
ture and representatives in as much
an air of cordiality as possible."
He sees the public relations role
j of a president as important since,
i"The president is one of the few stu
j dents who have the opportunity to
i represent the Stanford student body
to outsiders and to the administra-
I tion."
"Above all, whatever I do in the
: way of reform will have student
j backing and ... I plan nothing rash."

responsible in great part for the'*
record vote. But the student is ask
ing himself now what led to the
campaign, with its unusual approach,
and what brought Ralph to his de
cision to run in what was undoubt
edly the most colorful and exciting
campaign in ASSU history.
Ralph says that he had planned
on running for the presidency as
long ago as last spring.
"I, myself, felt untouched by stu
dent government, and I knew a lot
of others felt the same ... I asked
myself why?"
The new president thought that
people who felt this way wanted re
forms in the usual set-up, wanted a
chance to be heard.
GOVERNMENT GOAL
''Student government shouldn't
have as its prime goal the teaching
of its members to become better
organizers or to get along better with
each other. Rather, its prime goal
should be to accomplish results for
the people who aren't the leaders of
student government but who the
student government should work for
—those who have felt untouched by
the government."
And what reforms does Ralph pro
pose for revitalizing the approach to
student government?
"I'll talk with my associates and
investigate what's necessary . . . and
what students want. Obviously they
want reform, they voted for it."
Ralph is still busy accepting con
gratulations and adjusting to his new
role and says that he can't make any
specific statements on any of his
plans.
CAMPAIGN APPROACH
The unusual success of his cam
paign was due to the unique ap
proach that he used, according to
the president.
"At first I used the extreme ap
proach—a gimmick—to get original
interest up."
Ralph felt that this was the only
method of getting himself in the
public eye, in the minds of those
v/ho felt, like him, that they were
untouched by student government in
its present set-up.
He was clearly gunning for a win
and once he got the voters' initial
support by primary election, Ralph
purposely changed to a more ortho
dox approach and picked up even
j more interest.
Now that he's in office the new
president realizes that he will be
| closely watched to see if he can car-
