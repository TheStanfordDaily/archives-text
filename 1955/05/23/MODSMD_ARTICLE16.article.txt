# 'Vets' Win in Final Spring Scrimmage
## 
### BILL NICHOLS Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford closed out its 1955 spring
practice Saturday on a note of
guarded optimism. The veteran
Whites beat the Reds 14-7, but it
was the players wearing the cardi
nal jerseys that made Chuck Taylor
happy. The Reds outgained the
Whites in every department except
the scoreboard, and Lou Valli, a 5-9
speedster up from the frosh, was the
star of the day as he racked up 120
yards in 12 carries for the losers.
For the first time in several years
Stanford shows evidence of a run
ning attack. A host of backs, in
cluding two frosh, were getting
away for steady gains all day.
Paul Camera, Valli, Jim Truher,
John Neff, Bill Tarr, and Jerry An
gove all were very sharp in their
ball-handling duties.
Statistically, the passing was not
as good as it might have been, but
several times receivers dropped
good pitches, and the pass defense
also accounted for several incom
pletions.
Although neither side scored dur
ing the first half, both teams showed
offensive strength. Paul Camera and
John Brodie got the Reds off to a
good start after Gordy Young re
turned the kickoff to the 20.
Camera picked up a first down on
the 34 on two plays, and then Brodie
threw to Bill Burget for 9, and to
Carl Isaacs way down field for 40
more. But the Whites held on their
17. After Camera gained 2, Brodie
took to the air with no success. The
Whites took over on their own 24.
Jerry Gustafson moved his team
to the Red 44, mostly on line bucks
by Ernie Dorn, Tarr, and Angove.
There, however, on fourth and sev
en, the Whites had to punt.
Burget and Camera moved the
Reds from the 20 to the 45 on six
plays and then Brodie bootlegged
19 and passed to Gergen for 12. and j
the Reds were threatening again.
| Young made one to the 17, but un- }
necessary roughness set them back
Ito the 33, and four passes went
| astray.
Tarr moved the ball back into Red .
territory as he picked up 20 yards
on a pitchout at left end, as the
quarter ended.
The crimson shirts took over and
Valli made a spectacular debut.
Brodie pitched out to the squat full- I
back who was seemingly trapped
behind the line but got away for
five yards gained. Jack Taylor, an
other frosh, stopped this thrust as he J
intercepted a Brodie pass on the
20.
Valli and Jack Douglas provided J
the excitement for the remainder of
the half, although the Whites did
get off a drive in the closing min
utes that saw them reach the Red
two at the gun. Two Gustafson
passes gained 55 yards to the 13, and ;
Tarr passed to Frank Hook on the
two as the half ended.
WHITES SCORE QUICKIE
Dorn of the Whites took the sec
! ond-half kickoff on his 10 and re
j turned to the 36. Then he made four
j on a pitchout, and Jim Truher, 1952
j frosh star, rounded end for 15. Jack
Lewis "kept" and made 22 up the
middle, and Dorn bit off two at right
guard before Truher burst through
left tackle for 21 yards and the
score. Then he booted the PAT with
Lewis holding.
A brilliant defensive stand set up
the second White score, late in the
third quarter. The Reds made a first
down to their own 20. and Valli ;

made 23 at left end, but an offside
penalty nullified the gain.
Brodie dropped back to pass then,
but Paul Wiggin rushed him, and he
threw too hurriedly. Neff and Bob
Schmidt broke up the next two and
a short punt gave the Whites the
ball on the Red 35. Neff. Angove,
and Tarr, along with one pass from
Lewis to Dick Stein, put the ball on
the three and Angove carried it over.
Tarr kicked the extra point.
The Reds got their only score late
in the fourth quarter as they went
74 yards in six plays. Valli made all

but the last nine of the 74. His big
contribution was when he ran left
end 42 yards to the White 14.
His freshman counterpart, Doug
las, scooted the final nine on a beau
tiful bootleg, and Brodie came in to J
kick the final digit.

TRUHER TRIPPED —- Jim Truher, top ground gainer for the
Whites, is brought to earth after a 15 yard jaunt, by an unidenti
fied Red Tackier. Three plays later, Truher went 21 yards for
the first score of the game.
Stanford closed out its 1955 spring
practice Saturday on a note of
guarded optimism. The veteran
Whites beat the Reds 14-7, but it
was the players wearing the cardi
nal jerseys that made Chuck Taylor
happy. The Reds outgained the
Whites in every department except
the scoreboard, and Lou Valli, a 5-9
speedster up from the frosh, was the
star of the day as he racked up 120
yards in 12 carries for the losers.
For the first time in several years
Stanford shows evidence of a run
ning attack. A host of backs, in
cluding two frosh, were getting
away for steady gains all day.
Paul Camera, Valli, Jim Truher,
John Neff, Bill Tarr, and Jerry An
gove all were very sharp in their
ball-handling duties.
Statistically, the passing was not
as good as it might have been, but
several times receivers dropped
good pitches, and the pass defense
also accounted for several incom
pletions.
Although neither side scored dur
ing the first half, both teams showed
offensive strength. Paul Camera and
John Brodie got the Reds off to a
good start after Gordy Young re
turned the kickoff to the 20.
Camera picked up a first down on
the 34 on two plays, and then Brodie
threw to Bill Burget for 9, and to
Carl Isaacs way down field for 40
more. But the Whites held on their
17. After Camera gained 2, Brodie
took to the air with no success. The
Whites took over on their own 24.
Jerry Gustafson moved his team
to the Red 44, mostly on line bucks
by Ernie Dorn, Tarr, and Angove.
There, however, on fourth and sev
en, the Whites had to punt.
Burget and Camera moved the
Reds from the 20 to the 45 on six
plays and then Brodie bootlegged
19 and passed to Gergen for 12. and j
the Reds were threatening again.
| Young made one to the 17, but un- }
necessary roughness set them back
Ito the 33, and four passes went
| astray.
Tarr moved the ball back into Red .
territory as he picked up 20 yards
on a pitchout at left end, as the
quarter ended.
The crimson shirts took over and
Valli made a spectacular debut.
Brodie pitched out to the squat full- I
back who was seemingly trapped
behind the line but got away for
five yards gained. Jack Taylor, an
other frosh, stopped this thrust as he J
intercepted a Brodie pass on the
20.
Valli and Jack Douglas provided J
the excitement for the remainder of
the half, although the Whites did
get off a drive in the closing min
utes that saw them reach the Red
two at the gun. Two Gustafson
passes gained 55 yards to the 13, and ;
Tarr passed to Frank Hook on the
two as the half ended.
WHITES SCORE QUICKIE
Dorn of the Whites took the sec
! ond-half kickoff on his 10 and re
j turned to the 36. Then he made four
j on a pitchout, and Jim Truher, 1952
j frosh star, rounded end for 15. Jack
Lewis "kept" and made 22 up the
middle, and Dorn bit off two at right
guard before Truher burst through
left tackle for 21 yards and the
score. Then he booted the PAT with
Lewis holding.
A brilliant defensive stand set up
the second White score, late in the
third quarter. The Reds made a first
down to their own 20. and Valli ;

made 23 at left end, but an offside
penalty nullified the gain.
Brodie dropped back to pass then,
but Paul Wiggin rushed him, and he
threw too hurriedly. Neff and Bob
Schmidt broke up the next two and
a short punt gave the Whites the
ball on the Red 35. Neff. Angove,
and Tarr, along with one pass from
Lewis to Dick Stein, put the ball on
the three and Angove carried it over.
Tarr kicked the extra point.
The Reds got their only score late
in the fourth quarter as they went
74 yards in six plays. Valli made all

but the last nine of the 74. His big
contribution was when he ran left

TRUHER TRIPPED —- Jim Truher, top ground gainer for the
Whites, is brought to earth after a 15 yard jaunt, by an unidenti
fied Red Tackier. Three plays later, Truher went 21 yards for
the first score of the game.
Stanford closed out its 1955 spring
practice Saturday on a note of
guarded optimism. The veteran
Whites beat the Reds 14-7, but it
was the players wearing the cardi
nal jerseys that made Chuck Taylor
happy. The Reds outgained the
Whites in every department except
the scoreboard, and Lou Valli, a 5-9
speedster up from the frosh, was the
star of the day as he racked up 120
yards in 12 carries for the losers.
For the first time in several years
Stanford shows evidence of a run
ning attack. A host of backs, in
cluding two frosh, were getting
away for steady gains all day.
Paul Camera, Valli, Jim Truher,
John Neff, Bill Tarr, and Jerry An
gove all were very sharp in their
ball-handling duties.
Statistically, the passing was not
as good as it might have been, but
several times receivers dropped
good pitches, and the pass defense
also accounted for several incom
pletions.
Although neither side scored dur
ing the first half, both teams showed
offensive strength. Paul Camera and
John Brodie got the Reds off to a
good start after Gordy Young re
turned the kickoff to the 20.
Camera picked up a first down on
the 34 on two plays, and then Brodie
threw to Bill Burget for 9, and to
Carl Isaacs way down field for 40
more. But the Whites held on their
17. After Camera gained 2, Brodie
took to the air with no success. The
Whites took over on their own 24.
Jerry Gustafson moved his team
to the Red 44, mostly on line bucks
by Ernie Dorn, Tarr, and Angove.
There, however, on fourth and sev
en, the Whites had to punt.
Burget and Camera moved the
Reds from the 20 to the 45 on six
plays and then Brodie bootlegged
19 and passed to Gergen for 12. and j
the Reds were threatening again.
| Young made one to the 17, but un- }
necessary roughness set them back
Ito the 33, and four passes went

Tarr moved the ball back into Red .
territory as he picked up 20 yards
on a pitchout at left end, as the
quarter ended.
The crimson shirts took over and
Valli made a spectacular debut.
Brodie pitched out to the squat full- I
back who was seemingly trapped
behind the line but got away for
five yards gained. Jack Taylor, an
other frosh, stopped this thrust as he J
intercepted a Brodie pass on the
20.
Valli and Jack Douglas provided J
the excitement for the remainder of
the half, although the Whites did
get off a drive in the closing min
utes that saw them reach the Red
two at the gun. Two Gustafson
passes gained 55 yards to the 13, and ;

en, the Whites had to punt.
Burget and Camera moved the
Reds from the 20 to the 45 on six
plays and then Brodie bootlegged
19 and passed to Gergen for 12. and j
the Reds were threatening again.
| Young made one to the 17, but un- }
necessary roughness set them back
Ito the 33, and four passes went

Tarr moved the ball back into Red .
territory as he picked up 20 yards
on a pitchout at left end, as the
quarter ended.
The crimson shirts took over and
Valli made a spectacular debut.
Brodie pitched out to the squat full- I
back who was seemingly trapped
behind the line but got away for
five yards gained. Jack Taylor, an
other frosh, stopped this thrust as he J
intercepted a Brodie pass on the
20.
Valli and Jack Douglas provided J
the excitement for the remainder of
the half, although the Whites did
get off a drive in the closing min
utes that saw them reach the Red
two at the gun. Two Gustafson
passes gained 55 yards to the 13, and ;
Tarr passed to Frank Hook on the
two as the half ended.
WHITES SCORE QUICKIE
Dorn of the Whites took the sec
! ond-half kickoff on his 10 and re
j turned to the 36. Then he made four
j on a pitchout, and Jim Truher, 1952
j frosh star, rounded end for 15. Jack
Lewis "kept" and made 22 up the
middle, and Dorn bit off two at right
guard before Truher burst through
left tackle for 21 yards and the
score. Then he booted the PAT with
Lewis holding.
A brilliant defensive stand set up
the second White score, late in the
third quarter. The Reds made a first
down to their own 20. and Valli ;

made 23 at left end, but an offside
penalty nullified the gain.
Brodie dropped back to pass then,
but Paul Wiggin rushed him, and he
threw too hurriedly. Neff and Bob
Schmidt broke up the next two and
a short punt gave the Whites the
ball on the Red 35. Neff. Angove,
and Tarr, along with one pass from
Lewis to Dick Stein, put the ball on
the three and Angove carried it over.
Tarr kicked the extra point.
The Reds got their only score late
in the fourth quarter as they went
74 yards in six plays. Valli made all

but the last nine of the 74. His big
contribution was when he ran left

las, scooted the final nine on a beau
tiful bootleg, and Brodie came in to J
kick the final digit.
