# Backstage at Spring Sing: Co-ordination
## 
### RIC TEAGUE 
Saturday's 15th Annual
Spring Sing went off without a
hitch.
Many students and visitors
probably wondered what it takes
to turn out a smooth perform
ance where the attention of the
audience is focused on the per
formers themselves instead of on
the operating personnel.
Alter the NROTC had sung the
I final number of the Sing, Chairman
Don Crowell complimented Master
of Ceremonies Tim Sharpe for
I "turning out a very smooth show."
Sharpe was asked what went into
emceeing a show like the Spring
| Sing.
"The first and most important fac
tor," according to Sharpe, "was the
excellent handling of participants by
Rally Com, and Rally Corn's ;ill
over administration of the several
acts. Ushers had each group ready
to go on at precisely the right time.
This made my job easy because t
knew that after each announcement,
the group was on its way.
"This, coupled with the planning
of the Sing, under the direction of
the chairman, is chiefly responsible
for the show's smoothness." The
emcee emphasized that "technical
.excellence on the part of lighting
I and sound experts played a large
part in the Sing's success.
"Even though their efforts are for
the most part unnoticed, they cer
tainly would be noticed if there had
been any mistakes." Sharpe men
tioned that he had been told that
i "even in the last rows, the sound
was clear and sufficiently loud."
About the long wait between the
! last song and the presentation of
awards, Sharpe said, "I hadn't plan
ned for it—l thought it was goin •
I to be a terrible dead spot in Ihe
program. The audience was won
derful; it entertained itself wilti
songs. In fact, there were 10,(100
great people in the audience. I'm
glad so many alumni were able to
be there."
