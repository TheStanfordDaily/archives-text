To the Editor:
The shouting is ovar an 1 r: fleet ion begins. It was

feated candidate lor Student Body Preside: >t, ad

in a creative approach to what are. at beet, Ira i
tional lunclion;. During the campaign just new laid
to ret, 1 rtad anil listened to constant al'egations
to the effect that student government here at Stan
ford has been a failure.
Wiiy? There were ready : nswar; f:.r th's ques
tion: Because it flounders in the muck of bureau
racy; because rules and useless camniilti e.; are im
posed from above (wherever that may be), and do
not arise as indigenous expressions of student in
terest; because the individual is frustrated in his
dc 'res by the complexity of the organization.
These were serious charges, and about them
swirled the counter-charges and petty issues which
made up the election. With the voting passed, what
may we now say for their validity? Towards what
bright new future may we turn heads still sodden
with the wight of campaign profundities?
I do not speak as a member of the present admin
istration, but rather as one who has been its tcon
stant critic. Yet, I feel myself forced into revolt
against the irrational wave of reaction which has
swept aside, with scarcely a murmur, its accomplish
ments. This has been a year of constitution-making
an extremely exacting task, completely divorced
from the sensational, but requiring great sacrifice an-J
patience from those who labored over its details.
Twenty-live per cent of the electorate voted on its
ratification, and now the cry goes up (raised, I as
sume. by those who have just discovered its ex
istence) that it is a document riddled with evil. I
have listened to talk about the Cabinet and its po
tentiality for usurping the powers of the Legislature,
and wondered at the lack of understanding of what
this body is really designed to do.
Let us face the existing situation squarely. We
may easily deceive ourselves by viewing the voting
figures of last week as an indication of increased
student interest in the workings of their government.
We need only recall the emotional character of a
campaign filled with .sterile generalizations and pro
vocative half-truths to realize that there is no cause
for optimism. A vote against the status quo is a
hollow gesture when alternative courses of action,
based upon an accurate knowledge of what the prob
lems are, do not spur the voter on to a greater reali
zation of his own responsibilities.
The basic challenge facing student government
during the corning year will be to take stock of itself,
to decide its proper function, and then to carry out
its duties as quietly and efficiently as possible—re
membering always the guiding objective of working
to increase Stanford's ability to educate its students.
This may mean new projects, things which haven't
been done before but these should not be shrunk
from, as they constitute the greatest part of the
challenge.
Anil as for the "eternal questions": like prayer, they
are easily embarassed by the light of public scrutiny.

the daily is out of line
To the Editor:
I have always thought it was a democratic custom
after an election for the minority to congratulate the
majority an:l join with them to carry out the wishes
of the majority, but in less than twenty-four hours
the majority was ignored.
I have always thought that the legislature's duty
was to work for its constituents and not for itself. It
seems quite evident that the constituents like George
Ralph.
I think the Daily is out of line when they ask
"What Now, George?" If anything should be asked,
it's: "What Now. Stanford?" Are you going to lapse
back into the old ways and leave George in the
doldrums, or are you going to keep the "wave of
optimism" rolling until something can be done about
George's platform?
What now, Stanford?
BARBARA ROCHE
To the Editor:
You were so right when yoq said "What now,
George?" You cited campaign slogans, posters and
the constitution which I overlooked when I voted for
George Ralph. Now I know George deceived me—
so kind of you to remind me that George is helpless
before the mighty legislature.
1 guess, along with some 2,400 students who voted
for George Ralph, I too had a lapse of memory when
I dropped my vote in his box. Honestly, Mr. Mans
field, you did a magnificent job convincing me that a
vast majority of Stanford students could not read and
hear what George publicized and told in his election
campaign. Thanks a lot, Mr. Mansfield.

bad taste . . . cancelled
To the Editor:
It is a perennial Farad'_x frequently encountered
in the Daily, that the first to condemn a piece of bad
taste —as Thursday's editorial no doubt was (albeit
a fair comment nonetheless) —feel compelled to out
do the original malefactor in bad taste and down
right scurrility. If those who wrote the letters would
plumb down into the depths of their souls, could
they not find it in themselves to understand and for
give the hapless editorialist? The flaw in "Let him
who is without sin among you cast the first stone"
is that the first stone may be a sin. If by their fruits
we may know them, there is a psychological kinship
between the editorialist and his critics. But, of course,
the writers Fiiday were in the majority.
We are aware that we are also psychological blood
brothers of all these, and like Oscar Wilde we feel
that it is the height of bad manners to criticize the
bad manners of others, and we realize that even point
ing out this valuable fact makes us guilty of the
crime of which we complain—ad infinitum. In ex
tenuation, we plead only our lack of malice.
Let's all sit back and see who came out on top in
this exchange. Mr. Ralph, who pardon us we do not
mean to discuss, possibly engaged in a bit of ques
tionable taste in the course of his campaign. But of
course that was just to arouse interest. The letters
Friday seemed to show quite a bit of interest; so
now of the Daily comes out and says it didn't really
mean it, everything will be all right.
What we're suggesting is that if anyone is entitled
to bad taste, the minority is as well as the majority.

Il anyone is entitled to open his mouth and say nasty
thing about others, everybody is. Run down that I
page. Was the editorial "disgusting"? In sheer j
vituperative volume, the letters were exceedingly
disgusting. Cr does the majority have the right to
be (JO per cent disgusting? Are these letters paragons
of j:-ood ta; te, good sportsmanship, fairness, intellec- !
tual soundness, mature sweetness and liyht, and moral
excellence? Or are these virtues to be cultivated by
leers alone?
We don't always like Daily editorials, but the less
we like them the more valuable they are to us. To
us, the chief function of the editor is not to try to
write editorials (50 per cent for and 40 per cent against
—it is "to himself to be true," albeit with tact, and to
be reasonably fair in let ting sf mebody who has
something to say in opposition do so. This the Daily j
has done.
In this case the editorial was in bad tas'.e. But it j
seenvs to us that this has more than been cancelled 1
out on Friday.

gimmicks, fallacies
To the Editor:
At the risk of being penned into "immortality" by
the valiant nobles of George I, we wish to "clarify'
the "late" Daily editorial. It seems that many of the
2,400 have lost tfieir taste for "gimmicks." Gimmicks
worked lor Ralph before he ascended. Why stop !
now (nobles)?
Georgi ... we mean George . . . personified on
posters and pronouncements, awoke in the people's
people a desire for purge ... we mean "re-evalu
ationing" .* . . by whipping up such shockers as "I
hate cops" and "No government"—etc., et . . . e . . .
With "nothing to lose . . . use . . . but their chains
. . . brains . . ." the students of the world . . .
campus . . . arose, and through the ballot box they
did cast their Hero into office. As A. Lincolnov has
said, "You can fool enough of the people any time."
People know that when George said he hated cops
he really meant he wanted to be president. When
George said that no government was best govern- j
inent he really meant that he desired a "mandate
for reform."
The Daily employed a gimmick, and for some rea
son many "rasb" people were offended and didn't
catch on. If the Editor says that George may end up
all alone, he means that George has the universe
behind him. If the Editor tells George that he can't
rewrite the constitution, he means there is a "man
date" to "Let George do it." If the Editor says
"What now, George," he means "Relax, George;
there's plenty of time." #
So the Ralphians (homo gimmicus) were beaten at
their own game, only they didn't understand the
clever Editor. History will record that George was j
turned upside down by Mansfield. You say the Edi
tor was unconscious, that he didn't know he was us- i
ing a gimmick? All the more effective—an uncon
sciously motivated gimmick.
Thus the gimmick is a double edged sword. Ralph
used one edge, and the gang forgot about the other
edge, so when the motocycles came roaring through j
the columns of the Daily ...

"Creeping Socialists"
To the Editor:
I am one to say "Bravo" for your forthright edi
torial of May 19. I believe, from the comments that
it engendered, that the majority of the electorate had j
the wool pulled over their eyes by the jumble of j
double talk that Mr. Ralph used during his campaign !
and when the truth was so forcibly brought to their
attention, the natural reaction was one of shock and
disbelief. I am certain that if it hadn't been brought j
out at the beginning, it would have been so in the
future. So thanks again for taking this stand. I think
that it will put the question of campaign promises ;
and their fallacies in their proper light, as it seems to ■
'have already started to do.
It has been apparent from the beginning that Mr. i
Ralph took on the campaign as a lark, to prove on a
bet that it could be done. He has reversed his posi- j
tion so many times that one is wondering just what ■
he actually means and what his intentions are. All j
those who so loyally defend him have quite effectively :
been hoodwinked by his slick tongue and glib prom
ises on something that he can't deliver. From the j
hue and cry it seems that these supporters feel that
to be of the opposition is to declare oneself a heretic
and eligible (o be burned at the stake.
As for abolishing the cabinet and other deadwood J
of the present student government, I don't think that
Mr. Ralph or any of his supporters took a very
close look at the constitution, as evidenced by their j
cry of fire. If they didn't take much interest in it |
when they could have done something about it, why j
all the rumpus now? The maojrity of those who
were interested anough to vote in the constitutional ;
election certainly must have felt that it satisfied the J
need for a step forward. Granted it isn't perfect,
it wasn't advertised to be so, but in contrast to pres- i
ent campaign promises, it was a step forward along j
legal lines, to correct any duplication of effort.

bode even more ill . .
To the Editor:
Friday's "Campus Opinion" reveals some rather in
teresting assumptions on the part of your various
correspondents. Among these:
1) That to criticise the ASSU President is "morally
wrong and intellectually unsound."
2) That to disagree with the majority is "bad
sportsmanship."
3) That the dissenter is, per se, a "destructive in
fluence."
4) That the editor does not have the right to ex
press his opinion in an editorial (only in the letters
section).
5) That as the "only published voice of the stu- j
dent body," you should necessarily agree with the
majority of the student body on all issues.
6) That if the Daily is going to oppose the new
President it will lose the "favor and respect of many
people."
7) That in spite of your disagreement with Ralph,
you would have been "more intelligent" had you pre
tended support rather than to have stated an honest
opinion (hyproerisy is the better part of valour?)
8) That it is better to be silent than to criticize
adversely.
Perhaps these assumptions bode even more ill for ;
Stanford's future than the new constitution.

give the hapless editorialist? The flaw in "Let him
who is without sin among you cast the first stone"
is that the first stone may be a sin. If by their fruits
we may know them, there is a psychological kinship
between the editorialist and his critics. But, of course,
the writers Fiiday were in the majority.
We are aware that we are also psychological blood
brothers of all these, and like Oscar Wilde we feel
that it is the height of bad manners to criticize the
bad manners of others, and we realize that even point
ing out this valuable fact makes us guilty of the
crime of which we complain—ad infinitum. In ex
tenuation, we plead only our lack of malice.
Let's all sit back and see who came out on top in
this exchange. Mr. Ralph, who pardon us we do not
mean to discuss, possibly engaged in a bit of ques
tionable taste in the course of his campaign. But of
course that was just to arouse interest. The letters
Friday seemed to show quite a bit of interest; so
now of the Daily comes out and says it didn't really
mean it, everything will be all right.
What we're suggesting is that if anyone is entitled
to bad taste, the minority is as well as the majority.

Il anyone is entitled to open his mouth and say nasty
thing about others, everybody is. Run down that I
page. Was the editorial "disgusting"? In sheer j
vituperative volume, the letters were exceedingly
disgusting. Cr does the majority have the right to
be (JO per cent disgusting? Are these letters paragons
of j:-ood ta; te, good sportsmanship, fairness, intellec- !
tual soundness, mature sweetness and liyht, and moral
excellence? Or are these virtues to be cultivated by
leers alone?
We don't always like Daily editorials, but the less
we like them the more valuable they are to us. To
us, the chief function of the editor is not to try to
write editorials (50 per cent for and 40 per cent against
—it is "to himself to be true," albeit with tact, and to
be reasonably fair in let ting sf mebody who has
something to say in opposition do so. This the Daily j
has done.
In this case the editorial was in bad tas'.e. But it j
seenvs to us that this has more than been cancelled 1
out on Friday.

gimmicks, fallacies
To the Editor:
At the risk of being penned into "immortality" by
the valiant nobles of George I, we wish to "clarify'
the "late" Daily editorial. It seems that many of the
2,400 have lost tfieir taste for "gimmicks." Gimmicks
worked lor Ralph before he ascended. Why stop !
now (nobles)?
Georgi ... we mean George . . . personified on
posters and pronouncements, awoke in the people's
people a desire for purge ... we mean "re-evalu
ationing" .* . . by whipping up such shockers as "I
hate cops" and "No government"—etc., et . . . e . . .
With "nothing to lose . . . use . . . but their chains
. . . brains . . ." the students of the world . . .
campus . . . arose, and through the ballot box they
did cast their Hero into office. As A. Lincolnov has
said, "You can fool enough of the people any time."
People know that when George said he hated cops
he really meant he wanted to be president. When
George said that no government was best govern- j
inent he really meant that he desired a "mandate
for reform."
The Daily employed a gimmick, and for some rea
son many "rasb" people were offended and didn't
catch on. If the Editor says that George may end up
all alone, he means that George has the universe
behind him. If the Editor tells George that he can't
rewrite the constitution, he means there is a "man
date" to "Let George do it." If the Editor says
"What now, George," he means "Relax, George;
there's plenty of time." #
So the Ralphians (homo gimmicus) were beaten at
their own game, only they didn't understand the
clever Editor. History will record that George was j
turned upside down by Mansfield. You say the Edi
tor was unconscious, that he didn't know he was us- i
ing a gimmick? All the more effective—an uncon
sciously motivated gimmick.
Thus the gimmick is a double edged sword. Ralph
used one edge, and the gang forgot about the other
edge, so when the motocycles came roaring through j
the columns of the Daily ...

"Creeping Socialists"
To the Editor:
I am one to say "Bravo" for your forthright edi
torial of May 19. I believe, from the comments that
it engendered, that the majority of the electorate had j
the wool pulled over their eyes by the jumble of j
double talk that Mr. Ralph used during his campaign !
and when the truth was so forcibly brought to their
attention, the natural reaction was one of shock and
disbelief. I am certain that if it hadn't been brought j
out at the beginning, it would have been so in the
future. So thanks again for taking this stand. I think
that it will put the question of campaign promises ;
and their fallacies in their proper light, as it seems to ■
'have already started to do.
It has been apparent from the beginning that Mr. i
Ralph took on the campaign as a lark, to prove on a
bet that it could be done. He has reversed his posi- j
tion so many times that one is wondering just what ■
he actually means and what his intentions are. All j
those who so loyally defend him have quite effectively :
been hoodwinked by his slick tongue and glib prom
ises on something that he can't deliver. From the j
hue and cry it seems that these supporters feel that
to be of the opposition is to declare oneself a heretic
and eligible (o be burned at the stake.
As for abolishing the cabinet and other deadwood J
of the present student government, I don't think that
Mr. Ralph or any of his supporters took a very
close look at the constitution, as evidenced by their j
cry of fire. If they didn't take much interest in it |
when they could have done something about it, why j
all the rumpus now? The maojrity of those who
were interested anough to vote in the constitutional ;
election certainly must have felt that it satisfied the J
need for a step forward. Granted it isn't perfect,
it wasn't advertised to be so, but in contrast to pres- i
ent campaign promises, it was a step forward along j
legal lines, to correct any duplication of effort.

bode even more ill . .
To the Editor:
Friday's "Campus Opinion" reveals some rather in
teresting assumptions on the part of your various
correspondents. Among these:
1) That to criticise the ASSU President is "morally
wrong and intellectually unsound."
2) That to disagree with the majority is "bad
sportsmanship."
3) That the dissenter is, per se, a "destructive in
fluence."
4) That the editor does not have the right to ex
press his opinion in an editorial (only in the letters
section).
5) That as the "only published voice of the stu- j
dent body," you should necessarily agree with the
majority of the student body on all issues.
6) That if the Daily is going to oppose the new
President it will lose the "favor and respect of many
people."
7) That in spite of your disagreement with Ralph,
you would have been "more intelligent" had you pre
tended support rather than to have stated an honest
opinion (hyproerisy is the better part of valour?)
8) That it is better to be silent than to criticize
adversely.
Perhaps these assumptions bode even more ill for ;
Stanford's future than the new constitution.

The shouting is ovar an 1 r: fleet ion begins. It was
jut a littK' more than a year ago that I, t i a de
feated candidate lor Student Body Preside: >t, ad
di-e: j'd a letter la the Daily iongratulaLing 1' - Pres
idi -nt-Ek el anil offering rr.y hops that under 11is

in a creative approach to what are. at beet, Ira i
tional lunclion;. During the campaign just new laid
to ret, 1 rtad anil listened to constant al'egations
to the effect that student government here at Stan
ford has been a failure.
Wiiy? There were ready : nswar; f:.r th's ques
tion: Because it flounders in the muck of bureau
racy; because rules and useless camniilti e.; are im
posed from above (wherever that may be), and do
not arise as indigenous expressions of student in
terest; because the individual is frustrated in his
dc 'res by the complexity of the organization.
These were serious charges, and about them
swirled the counter-charges and petty issues which
made up the election. With the voting passed, what
may we now say for their validity? Towards what
bright new future may we turn heads still sodden
with the wight of campaign profundities?
I do not speak as a member of the present admin
istration, but rather as one who has been its tcon
stant critic. Yet, I feel myself forced into revolt
against the irrational wave of reaction which has
swept aside, with scarcely a murmur, its accomplish
ments. This has been a year of constitution-making
an extremely exacting task, completely divorced
from the sensational, but requiring great sacrifice an-J
patience from those who labored over its details.
Twenty-live per cent of the electorate voted on its
ratification, and now the cry goes up (raised, I as
sume. by those who have just discovered its ex
istence) that it is a document riddled with evil. I
have listened to talk about the Cabinet and its po
tentiality for usurping the powers of the Legislature,
and wondered at the lack of understanding of what
this body is really designed to do.
Let us face the existing situation squarely. We
may easily deceive ourselves by viewing the voting
figures of last week as an indication of increased
student interest in the workings of their government.
We need only recall the emotional character of a
campaign filled with .sterile generalizations and pro
vocative half-truths to realize that there is no cause
for optimism. A vote against the status quo is a
hollow gesture when alternative courses of action,
based upon an accurate knowledge of what the prob
lems are, do not spur the voter on to a greater reali
zation of his own responsibilities.
The basic challenge facing student government
during the corning year will be to take stock of itself,
to decide its proper function, and then to carry out
its duties as quietly and efficiently as possible—re
membering always the guiding objective of working
to increase Stanford's ability to educate its students.
This may mean new projects, things which haven't
been done before but these should not be shrunk
from, as they constitute the greatest part of the
challenge.
Anil as for the "eternal questions": like prayer, they
are easily embarassed by the light of public scrutiny.

the daily is out of line
To the Editor:
I have always thought it was a democratic custom
after an election for the minority to congratulate the
majority an:l join with them to carry out the wishes
of the majority, but in less than twenty-four hours
the majority was ignored.
I have always thought that the legislature's duty
was to work for its constituents and not for itself. It
seems quite evident that the constituents like George
Ralph.
I think the Daily is out of line when they ask
"What Now, George?" If anything should be asked,
it's: "What Now. Stanford?" Are you going to lapse
back into the old ways and leave George in the
doldrums, or are you going to keep the "wave of
optimism" rolling until something can be done about
George's platform?
What now, Stanford?
BARBARA ROCHE
To the Editor:
You were so right when yoq said "What now,
George?" You cited campaign slogans, posters and
the constitution which I overlooked when I voted for
George Ralph. Now I know George deceived me—
so kind of you to remind me that George is helpless
before the mighty legislature.
1 guess, along with some 2,400 students who voted
for George Ralph, I too had a lapse of memory when
I dropped my vote in his box. Honestly, Mr. Mans
field, you did a magnificent job convincing me that a
vast majority of Stanford students could not read and
hear what George publicized and told in his election
campaign. Thanks a lot, Mr. Mansfield.

It is a perennial Farad'_x frequently encountered
in the Daily, that the first to condemn a piece of bad

a fair comment nonetheless) —feel compelled to out
do the original malefactor in bad taste and down
right scurrility. If those who wrote the letters would
plumb down into the depths of their souls, could

that it will put the question of campaign promises ;
and their fallacies in their proper light, as it seems to ■
'have already started to do.
It has been apparent from the beginning that Mr. i
Ralph took on the campaign as a lark, to prove on a
bet that it could be done. He has reversed his posi- j
tion so many times that one is wondering just what ■
he actually means and what his intentions are. All j
those who so loyally defend him have quite effectively :
been hoodwinked by his slick tongue and glib prom
ises on something that he can't deliver. From the j
hue and cry it seems that these supporters feel that
to be of the opposition is to declare oneself a heretic
and eligible (o be burned at the stake.
As for abolishing the cabinet and other deadwood J
of the present student government, I don't think that
Mr. Ralph or any of his supporters took a very
close look at the constitution, as evidenced by their j
cry of fire. If they didn't take much interest in it |
when they could have done something about it, why j
all the rumpus now? The maojrity of those who
were interested anough to vote in the constitutional ;
election certainly must have felt that it satisfied the J
need for a step forward. Granted it isn't perfect,
it wasn't advertised to be so, but in contrast to pres- i
ent campaign promises, it was a step forward along j
legal lines, to correct any duplication of effort.

bode even more ill . .
To the Editor:
Friday's "Campus Opinion" reveals some rather in
teresting assumptions on the part of your various
correspondents. Among these:
1) That to criticise the ASSU President is "morally
wrong and intellectually unsound."
2) That to disagree with the majority is "bad
sportsmanship."
3) That the dissenter is, per se, a "destructive in
fluence."
4) That the editor does not have the right to ex
press his opinion in an editorial (only in the letters
section).
5) That as the "only published voice of the stu- j
dent body," you should necessarily agree with the
majority of the student body on all issues.
6) That if the Daily is going to oppose the new
President it will lose the "favor and respect of many
people."
7) That in spite of your disagreement with Ralph,
you would have been "more intelligent" had you pre
tended support rather than to have stated an honest
opinion (hyproerisy is the better part of valour?)
8) That it is better to be silent than to criticize
adversely.
Perhaps these assumptions bode even more ill for ;
Stanford's future than the new constitution.

to the effect that student government here at Stan
ford has been a failure.
Wiiy? There were ready : nswar; f:.r th's ques

racy; because rules and useless camniilti e.; are im
posed from above (wherever that may be), and do
not arise as indigenous expressions of student in
terest; because the individual is frustrated in his
dc 'res by the complexity of the organization.
These were serious charges, and about them
swirled the counter-charges and petty issues which
made up the election. With the voting passed, what
may we now say for their validity? Towards what
bright new future may we turn heads still sodden
with the wight of campaign profundities?
I do not speak as a member of the present admin
istration, but rather as one who has been its tcon
stant critic. Yet, I feel myself forced into revolt
against the irrational wave of reaction which has
swept aside, with scarcely a murmur, its accomplish
ments. This has been a year of constitution-making
an extremely exacting task, completely divorced
from the sensational, but requiring great sacrifice an-J
patience from those who labored over its details.
Twenty-live per cent of the electorate voted on its
ratification, and now the cry goes up (raised, I as
sume. by those who have just discovered its ex
istence) that it is a document riddled with evil. I
have listened to talk about the Cabinet and its po
tentiality for usurping the powers of the Legislature,
and wondered at the lack of understanding of what
this body is really designed to do.
Let us face the existing situation squarely. We
may easily deceive ourselves by viewing the voting
figures of last week as an indication of increased
student interest in the workings of their government.
We need only recall the emotional character of a
campaign filled with .sterile generalizations and pro
vocative half-truths to realize that there is no cause
for optimism. A vote against the status quo is a
hollow gesture when alternative courses of action,
based upon an accurate knowledge of what the prob
lems are, do not spur the voter on to a greater reali
zation of his own responsibilities.
The basic challenge facing student government
during the corning year will be to take stock of itself,
to decide its proper function, and then to carry out
its duties as quietly and efficiently as possible—re
membering always the guiding objective of working
to increase Stanford's ability to educate its students.
This may mean new projects, things which haven't
been done before but these should not be shrunk
from, as they constitute the greatest part of the
challenge.
Anil as for the "eternal questions": like prayer, they
are easily embarassed by the light of public scrutiny.

the daily is out of line
To the Editor:
I have always thought it was a democratic custom
after an election for the minority to congratulate the
majority an:l join with them to carry out the wishes
of the majority, but in less than twenty-four hours
the majority was ignored.
I have always thought that the legislature's duty
was to work for its constituents and not for itself. It
seems quite evident that the constituents like George
Ralph.
I think the Daily is out of line when they ask
"What Now, George?" If anything should be asked,
it's: "What Now. Stanford?" Are you going to lapse
back into the old ways and leave George in the
doldrums, or are you going to keep the "wave of
optimism" rolling until something can be done about
George's platform?
What now, Stanford?
BARBARA ROCHE
To the Editor:
You were so right when yoq said "What now,
George?" You cited campaign slogans, posters and
the constitution which I overlooked when I voted for
George Ralph. Now I know George deceived me—
so kind of you to remind me that George is helpless
before the mighty legislature.
1 guess, along with some 2,400 students who voted
for George Ralph, I too had a lapse of memory when
I dropped my vote in his box. Honestly, Mr. Mans
field, you did a magnificent job convincing me that a
vast majority of Stanford students could not read and
hear what George publicized and told in his election
campaign. Thanks a lot, Mr. Mansfield.

bad taste . . . cancelled
To the Editor:
It is a perennial Farad'_x frequently encountered
in the Daily, that the first to condemn a piece of bad
taste —as Thursday's editorial no doubt was (albeit
a fair comment nonetheless) —feel compelled to out
do the original malefactor in bad taste and down
right scurrility. If those who wrote the letters would
plumb down into the depths of their souls, could
they not find it in themselves to understand and for
give the hapless editorialist? The flaw in "Let him
who is without sin among you cast the first stone"
is that the first stone may be a sin. If by their fruits
we may know them, there is a psychological kinship
between the editorialist and his critics. But, of course,
the writers Fiiday were in the majority.
We are aware that we are also psychological blood
brothers of all these, and like Oscar Wilde we feel
that it is the height of bad manners to criticize the
bad manners of others, and we realize that even point
ing out this valuable fact makes us guilty of the
crime of which we complain—ad infinitum. In ex
tenuation, we plead only our lack of malice.
Let's all sit back and see who came out on top in
this exchange. Mr. Ralph, who pardon us we do not
mean to discuss, possibly engaged in a bit of ques
tionable taste in the course of his campaign. But of
course that was just to arouse interest. The letters
Friday seemed to show quite a bit of interest; so
now of the Daily comes out and says it didn't really
mean it, everything will be all right.
What we're suggesting is that if anyone is entitled
to bad taste, the minority is as well as the majority.

Il anyone is entitled to open his mouth and say nasty
thing about others, everybody is. Run down that I
page. Was the editorial "disgusting"? In sheer j
vituperative volume, the letters were exceedingly
disgusting. Cr does the majority have the right to
be (JO per cent disgusting? Are these letters paragons
of j:-ood ta; te, good sportsmanship, fairness, intellec- !
tual soundness, mature sweetness and liyht, and moral
excellence? Or are these virtues to be cultivated by
leers alone?
We don't always like Daily editorials, but the less
we like them the more valuable they are to us. To
us, the chief function of the editor is not to try to
write editorials (50 per cent for and 40 per cent against
—it is "to himself to be true," albeit with tact, and to
be reasonably fair in let ting sf mebody who has
something to say in opposition do so. This the Daily j
has done.
In this case the editorial was in bad tas'.e. But it j
seenvs to us that this has more than been cancelled 1
out on Friday.

gimmicks, fallacies
To the Editor:
At the risk of being penned into "immortality" by
the valiant nobles of George I, we wish to "clarify'
the "late" Daily editorial. It seems that many of the
2,400 have lost tfieir taste for "gimmicks." Gimmicks
worked lor Ralph before he ascended. Why stop !
now (nobles)?
Georgi ... we mean George . . . personified on
posters and pronouncements, awoke in the people's
people a desire for purge ... we mean "re-evalu
ationing" .* . . by whipping up such shockers as "I
hate cops" and "No government"—etc., et . . . e . . .
With "nothing to lose . . . use . . . but their chains
. . . brains . . ." the students of the world . . .
campus . . . arose, and through the ballot box they
did cast their Hero into office. As A. Lincolnov has
said, "You can fool enough of the people any time."
People know that when George said he hated cops
he really meant he wanted to be president. When
George said that no government was best govern- j
inent he really meant that he desired a "mandate
for reform."
The Daily employed a gimmick, and for some rea
son many "rasb" people were offended and didn't
catch on. If the Editor says that George may end up
all alone, he means that George has the universe
behind him. If the Editor tells George that he can't
rewrite the constitution, he means there is a "man
date" to "Let George do it." If the Editor says
"What now, George," he means "Relax, George;
there's plenty of time." #
So the Ralphians (homo gimmicus) were beaten at
their own game, only they didn't understand the
clever Editor. History will record that George was j
turned upside down by Mansfield. You say the Edi
tor was unconscious, that he didn't know he was us- i
ing a gimmick? All the more effective—an uncon
sciously motivated gimmick.
Thus the gimmick is a double edged sword. Ralph
used one edge, and the gang forgot about the other
edge, so when the motocycles came roaring through j
the columns of the Daily ...

the wool pulled over their eyes by the jumble of j

for optimism. A vote against the status quo is a
hollow gesture when alternative courses of action,
based upon an accurate knowledge of what the prob
lems are, do not spur the voter on to a greater reali
zation of his own responsibilities.
The basic challenge facing student government
during the corning year will be to take stock of itself,
to decide its proper function, and then to carry out
its duties as quietly and efficiently as possible—re
membering always the guiding objective of working
to increase Stanford's ability to educate its students.
This may mean new projects, things which haven't
been done before but these should not be shrunk
from, as they constitute the greatest part of the
challenge.
Anil as for the "eternal questions": like prayer, they
are easily embarassed by the light of public scrutiny.

the daily is out of line
To the Editor:
I have always thought it was a democratic custom
after an election for the minority to congratulate the
majority an:l join with them to carry out the wishes
of the majority, but in less than twenty-four hours
the majority was ignored.
I have always thought that the legislature's duty
was to work for its constituents and not for itself. It
seems quite evident that the constituents like George
Ralph.
I think the Daily is out of line when they ask
"What Now, George?" If anything should be asked,
it's: "What Now. Stanford?" Are you going to lapse
back into the old ways and leave George in the
doldrums, or are you going to keep the "wave of
optimism" rolling until something can be done about
George's platform?
What now, Stanford?
BARBARA ROCHE
To the Editor:
You were so right when yoq said "What now,
George?" You cited campaign slogans, posters and
the constitution which I overlooked when I voted for
George Ralph. Now I know George deceived me—
so kind of you to remind me that George is helpless
before the mighty legislature.
1 guess, along with some 2,400 students who voted
for George Ralph, I too had a lapse of memory when
I dropped my vote in his box. Honestly, Mr. Mans
field, you did a magnificent job convincing me that a
vast majority of Stanford students could not read and
hear what George publicized and told in his election
campaign. Thanks a lot, Mr. Mansfield.

bad taste . . . cancelled
To the Editor:
It is a perennial Farad'_x frequently encountered
in the Daily, that the first to condemn a piece of bad
taste —as Thursday's editorial no doubt was (albeit
a fair comment nonetheless) —feel compelled to out
do the original malefactor in bad taste and down
right scurrility. If those who wrote the letters would
plumb down into the depths of their souls, could
they not find it in themselves to understand and for
give the hapless editorialist? The flaw in "Let him
who is without sin among you cast the first stone"
is that the first stone may be a sin. If by their fruits
we may know them, there is a psychological kinship
between the editorialist and his critics. But, of course,
the writers Fiiday were in the majority.
We are aware that we are also psychological blood
brothers of all these, and like Oscar Wilde we feel
that it is the height of bad manners to criticize the
bad manners of others, and we realize that even point
ing out this valuable fact makes us guilty of the
crime of which we complain—ad infinitum. In ex
tenuation, we plead only our lack of malice.
Let's all sit back and see who came out on top in
this exchange. Mr. Ralph, who pardon us we do not
mean to discuss, possibly engaged in a bit of ques
tionable taste in the course of his campaign. But of
course that was just to arouse interest. The letters
Friday seemed to show quite a bit of interest; so
now of the Daily comes out and says it didn't really
mean it, everything will be all right.
What we're suggesting is that if anyone is entitled
to bad taste, the minority is as well as the majority.

Il anyone is entitled to open his mouth and say nasty
thing about others, everybody is. Run down that I
page. Was the editorial "disgusting"? In sheer j
vituperative volume, the letters were exceedingly
disgusting. Cr does the majority have the right to
be (JO per cent disgusting? Are these letters paragons
of j:-ood ta; te, good sportsmanship, fairness, intellec- !
tual soundness, mature sweetness and liyht, and moral
excellence? Or are these virtues to be cultivated by
leers alone?
We don't always like Daily editorials, but the less
we like them the more valuable they are to us. To
us, the chief function of the editor is not to try to
write editorials (50 per cent for and 40 per cent against
—it is "to himself to be true," albeit with tact, and to
be reasonably fair in let ting sf mebody who has
something to say in opposition do so. This the Daily j
has done.
In this case the editorial was in bad tas'.e. But it j
seenvs to us that this has more than been cancelled 1
out on Friday.

gimmicks, fallacies
To the Editor:
At the risk of being penned into "immortality" by
the valiant nobles of George I, we wish to "clarify'
the "late" Daily editorial. It seems that many of the
2,400 have lost tfieir taste for "gimmicks." Gimmicks
worked lor Ralph before he ascended. Why stop !
now (nobles)?
Georgi ... we mean George . . . personified on
posters and pronouncements, awoke in the people's
people a desire for purge ... we mean "re-evalu
ationing" .* . . by whipping up such shockers as "I
hate cops" and "No government"—etc., et . . . e . . .
With "nothing to lose . . . use . . . but their chains
. . . brains . . ." the students of the world . . .
campus . . . arose, and through the ballot box they
did cast their Hero into office. As A. Lincolnov has
said, "You can fool enough of the people any time."
People know that when George said he hated cops
he really meant he wanted to be president. When
George said that no government was best govern- j
inent he really meant that he desired a "mandate
for reform."
The Daily employed a gimmick, and for some rea
son many "rasb" people were offended and didn't
catch on. If the Editor says that George may end up
all alone, he means that George has the universe
behind him. If the Editor tells George that he can't
rewrite the constitution, he means there is a "man
date" to "Let George do it." If the Editor says
"What now, George," he means "Relax, George;
there's plenty of time." #
So the Ralphians (homo gimmicus) were beaten at
their own game, only they didn't understand the
clever Editor. History will record that George was j
turned upside down by Mansfield. You say the Edi
tor was unconscious, that he didn't know he was us- i
ing a gimmick? All the more effective—an uncon
sciously motivated gimmick.
Thus the gimmick is a double edged sword. Ralph
used one edge, and the gang forgot about the other
edge, so when the motocycles came roaring through j
the columns of the Daily ...
LEON and EDDIE ARDZROONI
"Creeping Socialists"
To the Editor:
I am one to say "Bravo" for your forthright edi
torial of May 19. I believe, from the comments that
it engendered, that the majority of the electorate had j
the wool pulled over their eyes by the jumble of j
double talk that Mr. Ralph used during his campaign !
and when the truth was so forcibly brought to their
attention, the natural reaction was one of shock and
disbelief. I am certain that if it hadn't been brought j
out at the beginning, it would have been so in the
future. So thanks again for taking this stand. I think
that it will put the question of campaign promises ;
and their fallacies in their proper light, as it seems to ■
'have already started to do.
It has been apparent from the beginning that Mr. i
Ralph took on the campaign as a lark, to prove on a
bet that it could be done. He has reversed his posi- j
tion so many times that one is wondering just what ■
he actually means and what his intentions are. All j
those who so loyally defend him have quite effectively :
been hoodwinked by his slick tongue and glib prom
ises on something that he can't deliver. From the j
hue and cry it seems that these supporters feel that
to be of the opposition is to declare oneself a heretic
and eligible (o be burned at the stake.
As for abolishing the cabinet and other deadwood J
of the present student government, I don't think that
Mr. Ralph or any of his supporters took a very
close look at the constitution, as evidenced by their j
cry of fire. If they didn't take much interest in it |
when they could have done something about it, why j
all the rumpus now? The maojrity of those who
were interested anough to vote in the constitutional ;
election certainly must have felt that it satisfied the J
need for a step forward. Granted it isn't perfect,
it wasn't advertised to be so, but in contrast to pres- i
ent campaign promises, it was a step forward along j
legal lines, to correct any duplication of effort.

bode even more ill . .
To the Editor:
Friday's "Campus Opinion" reveals some rather in
teresting assumptions on the part of your various
correspondents. Among these:
1) That to criticise the ASSU President is "morally
wrong and intellectually unsound."
2) That to disagree with the majority is "bad
sportsmanship."
3) That the dissenter is, per se, a "destructive in
fluence."
4) That the editor does not have the right to ex
press his opinion in an editorial (only in the letters
section).
5) That as the "only published voice of the stu- j
dent body," you should necessarily agree with the
majority of the student body on all issues.
6) That if the Daily is going to oppose the new
President it will lose the "favor and respect of many
people."
7) That in spite of your disagreement with Ralph,
you would have been "more intelligent" had you pre
tended support rather than to have stated an honest
opinion (hyproerisy is the better part of valour?)
8) That it is better to be silent than to criticize
adversely.
Perhaps these assumptions bode even more ill for ;
Stanford's future than the new constitution.

The shouting is ovar an 1 r: fleet ion begins. It was
jut a littK' more than a year ago that I, t i a de
feated candidate lor Student Body Preside: >t, ad

in a creative approach to what are. at beet, Ira i

to ret, 1 rtad anil listened to constant al'egations
to the effect that student government here at Stan
ford has been a failure.
Wiiy? There were ready : nswar; f:.r th's ques
tion: Because it flounders in the muck of bureau
racy; because rules and useless camniilti e.; are im
posed from above (wherever that may be), and do
not arise as indigenous expressions of student in
terest; because the individual is frustrated in his
dc 'res by the complexity of the organization.
These were serious charges, and about them
swirled the counter-charges and petty issues which
made up the election. With the voting passed, what
may we now say for their validity? Towards what
bright new future may we turn heads still sodden
with the wight of campaign profundities?
I do not speak as a member of the present admin
istration, but rather as one who has been its tcon
stant critic. Yet, I feel myself forced into revolt
against the irrational wave of reaction which has
swept aside, with scarcely a murmur, its accomplish
ments. This has been a year of constitution-making
an extremely exacting task, completely divorced
from the sensational, but requiring great sacrifice an-J
patience from those who labored over its details.
Twenty-live per cent of the electorate voted on its
ratification, and now the cry goes up (raised, I as
sume. by those who have just discovered its ex
istence) that it is a document riddled with evil. I
have listened to talk about the Cabinet and its po
tentiality for usurping the powers of the Legislature,
and wondered at the lack of understanding of what
this body is really designed to do.
Let us face the existing situation squarely. We
may easily deceive ourselves by viewing the voting
figures of last week as an indication of increased
student interest in the workings of their government.
We need only recall the emotional character of a
campaign filled with .sterile generalizations and pro
vocative half-truths to realize that there is no cause
for optimism. A vote against the status quo is a
hollow gesture when alternative courses of action,

At the risk of being penned into "immortality" by
the valiant nobles of George I, we wish to "clarify'
the "late" Daily editorial. It seems that many of the
2,400 have lost tfieir taste for "gimmicks." Gimmicks
worked lor Ralph before he ascended. Why stop !
now (nobles)?
Georgi ... we mean George . . . personified on
posters and pronouncements, awoke in the people's
people a desire for purge ... we mean "re-evalu
ationing" .* . . by whipping up such shockers as "I
hate cops" and "No government"—etc., et . . . e . . .
With "nothing to lose . . . use . . . but their chains
. . . brains . . ." the students of the world . . .
campus . . . arose, and through the ballot box they
did cast their Hero into office. As A. Lincolnov has
said, "You can fool enough of the people any time."
People know that when George said he hated cops
he really meant he wanted to be president. When
George said that no government was best govern- j
inent he really meant that he desired a "mandate
for reform."
The Daily employed a gimmick, and for some rea
son many "rasb" people were offended and didn't
catch on. If the Editor says that George may end up
all alone, he means that George has the universe
behind him. If the Editor tells George that he can't
rewrite the constitution, he means there is a "man
date" to "Let George do it." If the Editor says
"What now, George," he means "Relax, George;
there's plenty of time." #
So the Ralphians (homo gimmicus) were beaten at
their own game, only they didn't understand the
clever Editor. History will record that George was j
turned upside down by Mansfield. You say the Edi
tor was unconscious, that he didn't know he was us- i
ing a gimmick? All the more effective—an uncon
sciously motivated gimmick.
Thus the gimmick is a double edged sword. Ralph
used one edge, and the gang forgot about the other
edge, so when the motocycles came roaring through j
the columns of the Daily ...

"Creeping Socialists"
To the Editor:
I am one to say "Bravo" for your forthright edi
torial of May 19. I believe, from the comments that
it engendered, that the majority of the electorate had j
the wool pulled over their eyes by the jumble of j
double talk that Mr. Ralph used during his campaign !
and when the truth was so forcibly brought to their
attention, the natural reaction was one of shock and
disbelief. I am certain that if it hadn't been brought j
out at the beginning, it would have been so in the
future. So thanks again for taking this stand. I think
that it will put the question of campaign promises ;
and their fallacies in their proper light, as it seems to ■
'have already started to do.
It has been apparent from the beginning that Mr. i
Ralph took on the campaign as a lark, to prove on a
bet that it could be done. He has reversed his posi- j
tion so many times that one is wondering just what ■
he actually means and what his intentions are. All j
those who so loyally defend him have quite effectively :
been hoodwinked by his slick tongue and glib prom
ises on something that he can't deliver. From the j
hue and cry it seems that these supporters feel that
to be of the opposition is to declare oneself a heretic
and eligible (o be burned at the stake.
As for abolishing the cabinet and other deadwood J
of the present student government, I don't think that
Mr. Ralph or any of his supporters took a very
close look at the constitution, as evidenced by their j
cry of fire. If they didn't take much interest in it |
when they could have done something about it, why j
all the rumpus now? The maojrity of those who
were interested anough to vote in the constitutional ;
election certainly must have felt that it satisfied the J
need for a step forward. Granted it isn't perfect,
it wasn't advertised to be so, but in contrast to pres- i
ent campaign promises, it was a step forward along j
legal lines, to correct any duplication of effort.

bode even more ill . .
To the Editor:
Friday's "Campus Opinion" reveals some rather in
teresting assumptions on the part of your various
correspondents. Among these:
1) That to criticise the ASSU President is "morally
wrong and intellectually unsound."
2) That to disagree with the majority is "bad
sportsmanship."
3) That the dissenter is, per se, a "destructive in
fluence."
4) That the editor does not have the right to ex
press his opinion in an editorial (only in the letters
section).
5) That as the "only published voice of the stu- j
dent body," you should necessarily agree with the
majority of the student body on all issues.
6) That if the Daily is going to oppose the new
President it will lose the "favor and respect of many
people."
7) That in spite of your disagreement with Ralph,
you would have been "more intelligent" had you pre
tended support rather than to have stated an honest
opinion (hyproerisy is the better part of valour?)
8) That it is better to be silent than to criticize
adversely.
Perhaps these assumptions bode even more ill for ;
Stanford's future than the new constitution.

reflection begins'
To the Editor:
The shouting is ovar an 1 r: fleet ion begins. It was
jut a littK' more than a year ago that I, t i a de
feated candidate lor Student Body Preside: >t, ad
di-e: j'd a letter la the Daily iongratulaLing 1' - Pres
idi -nt-Ek el anil offering rr.y hops that under 11is
leadership student feovernmtr;!. w„u!d move ahe .1
in a creative approach to what are. at beet, Ira i
tional lunclion;. During the campaign just new laid
to ret, 1 rtad anil listened to constant al'egations
to the effect that student government here at Stan
ford has been a failure.
Wiiy? There were ready : nswar; f:.r th's ques
tion: Because it flounders in the muck of bureau
racy; because rules and useless camniilti e.; are im
posed from above (wherever that may be), and do
not arise as indigenous expressions of student in
terest; because the individual is frustrated in his
dc 'res by the complexity of the organization.
These were serious charges, and about them
swirled the counter-charges and petty issues which
made up the election. With the voting passed, what
may we now say for their validity? Towards what
bright new future may we turn heads still sodden
with the wight of campaign profundities?
I do not speak as a member of the present admin
istration, but rather as one who has been its tcon
stant critic. Yet, I feel myself forced into revolt
against the irrational wave of reaction which has
swept aside, with scarcely a murmur, its accomplish
ments. This has been a year of constitution-making
an extremely exacting task, completely divorced
from the sensational, but requiring great sacrifice an-J
patience from those who labored over its details.
Twenty-live per cent of the electorate voted on its
ratification, and now the cry goes up (raised, I as
sume. by those who have just discovered its ex
istence) that it is a document riddled with evil. I
have listened to talk about the Cabinet and its po
tentiality for usurping the powers of the Legislature,
and wondered at the lack of understanding of what
this body is really designed to do.
Let us face the existing situation squarely. We
may easily deceive ourselves by viewing the voting
figures of last week as an indication of increased
student interest in the workings of their government.
We need only recall the emotional character of a
campaign filled with .sterile generalizations and pro
vocative half-truths to realize that there is no cause
for optimism. A vote against the status quo is a
hollow gesture when alternative courses of action,
based upon an accurate knowledge of what the prob
lems are, do not spur the voter on to a greater reali
zation of his own responsibilities.
The basic challenge facing student government
during the corning year will be to take stock of itself,
to decide its proper function, and then to carry out
its duties as quietly and efficiently as possible—re
membering always the guiding objective of working
to increase Stanford's ability to educate its students.
This may mean new projects, things which haven't
been done before but these should not be shrunk
from, as they constitute the greatest part of the
challenge.
Anil as for the "eternal questions": like prayer, they
are easily embarassed by the light of public scrutiny.

the daily is out of line
To the Editor:
I have always thought it was a democratic custom
after an election for the minority to congratulate the
majority an:l join with them to carry out the wishes
of the majority, but in less than twenty-four hours
the majority was ignored.
I have always thought that the legislature's duty
was to work for its constituents and not for itself. It
seems quite evident that the constituents like George
Ralph.
I think the Daily is out of line when they ask
"What Now, George?" If anything should be asked,
it's: "What Now. Stanford?" Are you going to lapse
back into the old ways and leave George in the
doldrums, or are you going to keep the "wave of
optimism" rolling until something can be done about
George's platform?
What now, Stanford?
BARBARA ROCHE
To the Editor:
You were so right when yoq said "What now,
George?" You cited campaign slogans, posters and
the constitution which I overlooked when I voted for
George Ralph. Now I know George deceived me—
so kind of you to remind me that George is helpless
before the mighty legislature.
1 guess, along with some 2,400 students who voted
for George Ralph, I too had a lapse of memory when
I dropped my vote in his box. Honestly, Mr. Mans
field, you did a magnificent job convincing me that a
vast majority of Stanford students could not read and
hear what George publicized and told in his election
campaign. Thanks a lot, Mr. Mansfield.

bad taste . . . cancelled
To the Editor:
It is a perennial Farad'_x frequently encountered
in the Daily, that the first to condemn a piece of bad
taste —as Thursday's editorial no doubt was (albeit
a fair comment nonetheless) —feel compelled to out
do the original malefactor in bad taste and down
right scurrility. If those who wrote the letters would
plumb down into the depths of their souls, could
they not find it in themselves to understand and for
give the hapless editorialist? The flaw in "Let him
who is without sin among you cast the first stone"
is that the first stone may be a sin. If by their fruits
we may know them, there is a psychological kinship
between the editorialist and his critics. But, of course,
the writers Fiiday were in the majority.
We are aware that we are also psychological blood
brothers of all these, and like Oscar Wilde we feel
that it is the height of bad manners to criticize the
bad manners of others, and we realize that even point
ing out this valuable fact makes us guilty of the
crime of which we complain—ad infinitum. In ex
tenuation, we plead only our lack of malice.
Let's all sit back and see who came out on top in
this exchange. Mr. Ralph, who pardon us we do not
mean to discuss, possibly engaged in a bit of ques
tionable taste in the course of his campaign. But of
course that was just to arouse interest. The letters
Friday seemed to show quite a bit of interest; so
now of the Daily comes out and says it didn't really
mean it, everything will be all right.
What we're suggesting is that if anyone is entitled
to bad taste, the minority is as well as the majority.

Il anyone is entitled to open his mouth and say nasty
thing about others, everybody is. Run down that I
page. Was the editorial "disgusting"? In sheer j
vituperative volume, the letters were exceedingly
disgusting. Cr does the majority have the right to
be (JO per cent disgusting? Are these letters paragons
of j:-ood ta; te, good sportsmanship, fairness, intellec- !
tual soundness, mature sweetness and liyht, and moral
excellence? Or are these virtues to be cultivated by
leers alone?
We don't always like Daily editorials, but the less
we like them the more valuable they are to us. To
us, the chief function of the editor is not to try to
write editorials (50 per cent for and 40 per cent against
—it is "to himself to be true," albeit with tact, and to
be reasonably fair in let ting sf mebody who has
something to say in opposition do so. This the Daily j
has done.
In this case the editorial was in bad tas'.e. But it j
seenvs to us that this has more than been cancelled 1
out on Friday.

not arise as indigenous expressions of student in
terest; because the individual is frustrated in his
dc 'res by the complexity of the organization.
These were serious charges, and about them
swirled the counter-charges and petty issues which
made up the election. With the voting passed, what
may we now say for their validity? Towards what
bright new future may we turn heads still sodden
with the wight of campaign profundities?
I do not speak as a member of the present admin
istration, but rather as one who has been its tcon
stant critic. Yet, I feel myself forced into revolt
against the irrational wave of reaction which has
swept aside, with scarcely a murmur, its accomplish
ments. This has been a year of constitution-making
an extremely exacting task, completely divorced
from the sensational, but requiring great sacrifice an-J
patience from those who labored over its details.
Twenty-live per cent of the electorate voted on its
ratification, and now the cry goes up (raised, I as
sume. by those who have just discovered its ex
istence) that it is a document riddled with evil. I
have listened to talk about the Cabinet and its po
tentiality for usurping the powers of the Legislature,
and wondered at the lack of understanding of what
this body is really designed to do.
Let us face the existing situation squarely. We
may easily deceive ourselves by viewing the voting
figures of last week as an indication of increased
student interest in the workings of their government.
We need only recall the emotional character of a
campaign filled with .sterile generalizations and pro
vocative half-truths to realize that there is no cause
for optimism. A vote against the status quo is a
hollow gesture when alternative courses of action,
based upon an accurate knowledge of what the prob
lems are, do not spur the voter on to a greater reali
zation of his own responsibilities.
The basic challenge facing student government
during the corning year will be to take stock of itself,
to decide its proper function, and then to carry out
its duties as quietly and efficiently as possible—re
membering always the guiding objective of working
to increase Stanford's ability to educate its students.
This may mean new projects, things which haven't
been done before but these should not be shrunk
from, as they constitute the greatest part of the
challenge.
Anil as for the "eternal questions": like prayer, they
are easily embarassed by the light of public scrutiny.

the daily is out of line
To the Editor:
I have always thought it was a democratic custom
after an election for the minority to congratulate the
majority an:l join with them to carry out the wishes
of the majority, but in less than twenty-four hours
the majority was ignored.
I have always thought that the legislature's duty
was to work for its constituents and not for itself. It
seems quite evident that the constituents like George
Ralph.
I think the Daily is out of line when they ask
"What Now, George?" If anything should be asked,
it's: "What Now. Stanford?" Are you going to lapse
back into the old ways and leave George in the
doldrums, or are you going to keep the "wave of
optimism" rolling until something can be done about
George's platform?
What now, Stanford?
BARBARA ROCHE
To the Editor:
You were so right when yoq said "What now,
George?" You cited campaign slogans, posters and
the constitution which I overlooked when I voted for
George Ralph. Now I know George deceived me—
so kind of you to remind me that George is helpless
before the mighty legislature.
1 guess, along with some 2,400 students who voted
for George Ralph, I too had a lapse of memory when
I dropped my vote in his box. Honestly, Mr. Mans
field, you did a magnificent job convincing me that a
vast majority of Stanford students could not read and
hear what George publicized and told in his election
campaign. Thanks a lot, Mr. Mansfield.

bad taste . . . cancelled
To the Editor:
It is a perennial Farad'_x frequently encountered
in the Daily, that the first to condemn a piece of bad
taste —as Thursday's editorial no doubt was (albeit
a fair comment nonetheless) —feel compelled to out
do the original malefactor in bad taste and down
right scurrility. If those who wrote the letters would
plumb down into the depths of their souls, could
they not find it in themselves to understand and for
give the hapless editorialist? The flaw in "Let him
who is without sin among you cast the first stone"
is that the first stone may be a sin. If by their fruits
we may know them, there is a psychological kinship
between the editorialist and his critics. But, of course,
the writers Fiiday were in the majority.
We are aware that we are also psychological blood
brothers of all these, and like Oscar Wilde we feel
that it is the height of bad manners to criticize the
bad manners of others, and we realize that even point
ing out this valuable fact makes us guilty of the
crime of which we complain—ad infinitum. In ex
tenuation, we plead only our lack of malice.
Let's all sit back and see who came out on top in
this exchange. Mr. Ralph, who pardon us we do not
mean to discuss, possibly engaged in a bit of ques
tionable taste in the course of his campaign. But of
course that was just to arouse interest. The letters
Friday seemed to show quite a bit of interest; so
now of the Daily comes out and says it didn't really
mean it, everything will be all right.
What we're suggesting is that if anyone is entitled
to bad taste, the minority is as well as the majority.

Il anyone is entitled to open his mouth and say nasty
thing about others, everybody is. Run down that I
page. Was the editorial "disgusting"? In sheer j
vituperative volume, the letters were exceedingly
disgusting. Cr does the majority have the right to
be (JO per cent disgusting? Are these letters paragons
of j:-ood ta; te, good sportsmanship, fairness, intellec- !
tual soundness, mature sweetness and liyht, and moral
excellence? Or are these virtues to be cultivated by
leers alone?
We don't always like Daily editorials, but the less
we like them the more valuable they are to us. To
us, the chief function of the editor is not to try to
write editorials (50 per cent for and 40 per cent against
—it is "to himself to be true," albeit with tact, and to
be reasonably fair in let ting sf mebody who has
something to say in opposition do so. This the Daily j
has done.
In this case the editorial was in bad tas'.e. But it j
seenvs to us that this has more than been cancelled 1
out on Friday.

gimmicks, fallacies
To the Editor:
At the risk of being penned into "immortality" by
the valiant nobles of George I, we wish to "clarify'
the "late" Daily editorial. It seems that many of the
2,400 have lost tfieir taste for "gimmicks." Gimmicks
worked lor Ralph before he ascended. Why stop !
now (nobles)?
Georgi ... we mean George . . . personified on
posters and pronouncements, awoke in the people's
people a desire for purge ... we mean "re-evalu
ationing" .* . . by whipping up such shockers as "I
hate cops" and "No government"—etc., et . . . e . . .
With "nothing to lose . . . use . . . but their chains
. . . brains . . ." the students of the world . . .
campus . . . arose, and through the ballot box they
did cast their Hero into office. As A. Lincolnov has
said, "You can fool enough of the people any time."
People know that when George said he hated cops
he really meant he wanted to be president. When
George said that no government was best govern- j
inent he really meant that he desired a "mandate
for reform."
The Daily employed a gimmick, and for some rea
son many "rasb" people were offended and didn't
catch on. If the Editor says that George may end up
all alone, he means that George has the universe
behind him. If the Editor tells George that he can't
rewrite the constitution, he means there is a "man
date" to "Let George do it." If the Editor says
"What now, George," he means "Relax, George;
there's plenty of time." #
So the Ralphians (homo gimmicus) were beaten at
their own game, only they didn't understand the
clever Editor. History will record that George was j
turned upside down by Mansfield. You say the Edi
tor was unconscious, that he didn't know he was us- i
ing a gimmick? All the more effective—an uncon
sciously motivated gimmick.
Thus the gimmick is a double edged sword. Ralph
used one edge, and the gang forgot about the other
edge, so when the motocycles came roaring through j
the columns of the Daily ...
LEON and EDDIE ARDZROONI
"Creeping Socialists"
To the Editor:
I am one to say "Bravo" for your forthright edi
torial of May 19. I believe, from the comments that
it engendered, that the majority of the electorate had j
the wool pulled over their eyes by the jumble of j
double talk that Mr. Ralph used during his campaign !
and when the truth was so forcibly brought to their
attention, the natural reaction was one of shock and
disbelief. I am certain that if it hadn't been brought j
out at the beginning, it would have been so in the
future. So thanks again for taking this stand. I think
that it will put the question of campaign promises ;
and their fallacies in their proper light, as it seems to ■
'have already started to do.
It has been apparent from the beginning that Mr. i
Ralph took on the campaign as a lark, to prove on a
bet that it could be done. He has reversed his posi- j
tion so many times that one is wondering just what ■
he actually means and what his intentions are. All j
those who so loyally defend him have quite effectively :
been hoodwinked by his slick tongue and glib prom
ises on something that he can't deliver. From the j
hue and cry it seems that these supporters feel that
to be of the opposition is to declare oneself a heretic
and eligible (o be burned at the stake.
As for abolishing the cabinet and other deadwood J
of the present student government, I don't think that
Mr. Ralph or any of his supporters took a very
close look at the constitution, as evidenced by their j
cry of fire. If they didn't take much interest in it |
when they could have done something about it, why j
all the rumpus now? The maojrity of those who
were interested anough to vote in the constitutional ;
election certainly must have felt that it satisfied the J
need for a step forward. Granted it isn't perfect,
it wasn't advertised to be so, but in contrast to pres- i
ent campaign promises, it was a step forward along j
legal lines, to correct any duplication of effort.

bode even more ill . .
To the Editor:
Friday's "Campus Opinion" reveals some rather in
teresting assumptions on the part of your various
correspondents. Among these:
1) That to criticise the ASSU President is "morally
wrong and intellectually unsound."
2) That to disagree with the majority is "bad
sportsmanship."
3) That the dissenter is, per se, a "destructive in
fluence."
4) That the editor does not have the right to ex
press his opinion in an editorial (only in the letters
section).
5) That as the "only published voice of the stu- j
dent body," you should necessarily agree with the
majority of the student body on all issues.
6) That if the Daily is going to oppose the new
President it will lose the "favor and respect of many
people."
7) That in spite of your disagreement with Ralph,
you would have been "more intelligent" had you pre
tended support rather than to have stated an honest
opinion (hyproerisy is the better part of valour?)
8) That it is better to be silent than to criticize
adversely.
Perhaps these assumptions bode even more ill for ;
Stanford's future than the new constitution.

a fair comment nonetheless) —feel compelled to out
do the original malefactor in bad taste and down
right scurrility. If those who wrote the letters would
plumb down into the depths of their souls, could
they not find it in themselves to understand and for
give the hapless editorialist? The flaw in "Let him
who is without sin among you cast the first stone"
is that the first stone may be a sin. If by their fruits
we may know them, there is a psychological kinship
between the editorialist and his critics. But, of course,
the writers Fiiday were in the majority.
We are aware that we are also psychological blood
brothers of all these, and like Oscar Wilde we feel
that it is the height of bad manners to criticize the
bad manners of others, and we realize that even point
ing out this valuable fact makes us guilty of the
crime of which we complain—ad infinitum. In ex
tenuation, we plead only our lack of malice.
Let's all sit back and see who came out on top in
this exchange. Mr. Ralph, who pardon us we do not
mean to discuss, possibly engaged in a bit of ques
tionable taste in the course of his campaign. But of
course that was just to arouse interest. The letters
Friday seemed to show quite a bit of interest; so
now of the Daily comes out and says it didn't really
mean it, everything will be all right.
What we're suggesting is that if anyone is entitled
to bad taste, the minority is as well as the majority.

Il anyone is entitled to open his mouth and say nasty
thing about others, everybody is. Run down that I
page. Was the editorial "disgusting"? In sheer j
vituperative volume, the letters were exceedingly
disgusting. Cr does the majority have the right to
be (JO per cent disgusting? Are these letters paragons
of j:-ood ta; te, good sportsmanship, fairness, intellec- !
tual soundness, mature sweetness and liyht, and moral
excellence? Or are these virtues to be cultivated by
leers alone?
We don't always like Daily editorials, but the less
we like them the more valuable they are to us. To
us, the chief function of the editor is not to try to
write editorials (50 per cent for and 40 per cent against
—it is "to himself to be true," albeit with tact, and to
be reasonably fair in let ting sf mebody who has
something to say in opposition do so. This the Daily j
has done.
In this case the editorial was in bad tas'.e. But it j
seenvs to us that this has more than been cancelled 1
out on Friday.

gimmicks, fallacies
To the Editor:
At the risk of being penned into "immortality" by
the valiant nobles of George I, we wish to "clarify'
the "late" Daily editorial. It seems that many of the
2,400 have lost tfieir taste for "gimmicks." Gimmicks
worked lor Ralph before he ascended. Why stop !
now (nobles)?
Georgi ... we mean George . . . personified on
posters and pronouncements, awoke in the people's
people a desire for purge ... we mean "re-evalu
ationing" .* . . by whipping up such shockers as "I
hate cops" and "No government"—etc., et . . . e . . .
With "nothing to lose . . . use . . . but their chains
. . . brains . . ." the students of the world . . .
campus . . . arose, and through the ballot box they
did cast their Hero into office. As A. Lincolnov has
said, "You can fool enough of the people any time."
People know that when George said he hated cops
he really meant he wanted to be president. When
George said that no government was best govern- j
inent he really meant that he desired a "mandate
for reform."
The Daily employed a gimmick, and for some rea
son many "rasb" people were offended and didn't
catch on. If the Editor says that George may end up
all alone, he means that George has the universe
behind him. If the Editor tells George that he can't
rewrite the constitution, he means there is a "man
date" to "Let George do it." If the Editor says
"What now, George," he means "Relax, George;
there's plenty of time." #
So the Ralphians (homo gimmicus) were beaten at
their own game, only they didn't understand the
clever Editor. History will record that George was j
turned upside down by Mansfield. You say the Edi
tor was unconscious, that he didn't know he was us- i
ing a gimmick? All the more effective—an uncon
sciously motivated gimmick.
Thus the gimmick is a double edged sword. Ralph
used one edge, and the gang forgot about the other
edge, so when the motocycles came roaring through j
the columns of the Daily ...

"Creeping Socialists"
To the Editor:
I am one to say "Bravo" for your forthright edi
torial of May 19. I believe, from the comments that
it engendered, that the majority of the electorate had j
the wool pulled over their eyes by the jumble of j
double talk that Mr. Ralph used during his campaign !
and when the truth was so forcibly brought to their
attention, the natural reaction was one of shock and
disbelief. I am certain that if it hadn't been brought j
out at the beginning, it would have been so in the
future. So thanks again for taking this stand. I think
that it will put the question of campaign promises ;
and their fallacies in their proper light, as it seems to ■
'have already started to do.
It has been apparent from the beginning that Mr. i
Ralph took on the campaign as a lark, to prove on a
bet that it could be done. He has reversed his posi- j
tion so many times that one is wondering just what ■
he actually means and what his intentions are. All j
those who so loyally defend him have quite effectively :
been hoodwinked by his slick tongue and glib prom
ises on something that he can't deliver. From the j
hue and cry it seems that these supporters feel that
to be of the opposition is to declare oneself a heretic
and eligible (o be burned at the stake.
As for abolishing the cabinet and other deadwood J
of the present student government, I don't think that
Mr. Ralph or any of his supporters took a very
close look at the constitution, as evidenced by their j
cry of fire. If they didn't take much interest in it |
when they could have done something about it, why j
all the rumpus now? The maojrity of those who
were interested anough to vote in the constitutional ;
election certainly must have felt that it satisfied the J
need for a step forward. Granted it isn't perfect,
it wasn't advertised to be so, but in contrast to pres- i
ent campaign promises, it was a step forward along j
legal lines, to correct any duplication of effort.

bode even more ill . .
To the Editor:
Friday's "Campus Opinion" reveals some rather in
teresting assumptions on the part of your various
correspondents. Among these:
1) That to criticise the ASSU President is "morally
wrong and intellectually unsound."
2) That to disagree with the majority is "bad
sportsmanship."
3) That the dissenter is, per se, a "destructive in
fluence."
4) That the editor does not have the right to ex
press his opinion in an editorial (only in the letters
section).
5) That as the "only published voice of the stu- j
dent body," you should necessarily agree with the
majority of the student body on all issues.
6) That if the Daily is going to oppose the new
President it will lose the "favor and respect of many
people."
7) That in spite of your disagreement with Ralph,
you would have been "more intelligent" had you pre
tended support rather than to have stated an honest
opinion (hyproerisy is the better part of valour?)
8) That it is better to be silent than to criticize
adversely.
Perhaps these assumptions bode even more ill for ;
Stanford's future than the new constitution.
