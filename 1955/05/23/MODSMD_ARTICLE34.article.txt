# 'Rake's Progress'—Opera, Good Theater Blended in Modern Auden-Stravinsky Work
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
They had been rehearsing
"The Rake's Progress" for most
of the evening, and now direc
tor F. Cowles Strickland called
a break. Robert Rounseville
looked tired but his voice when
he talked was enthusiastic.
''What we're trying to do here."
he said, "is to make opera good
theater too. It's supposed to be, you
know. Auden has written a terrific
libretto for "Rake" and you can't
just ignore it."
"It's so easy," he said, "to fall in
to standard operatice cliches. Al
most unconsciously. Here comes a
big duet, so everybody walks to the
front of the stage: that sort of thing,
you know.
"But Professor Strickland is a man
interested primarily in ph'ama, and
he sees opera in terms of its drama.
I think that's a good thing."
Rounseville laughed.
"They never would let me in the
dramatic club when I was in college,"

he said. Then a little ruefully: "That
was twenty years ago." He laughed
again. "But I've always thought of
myself as an actor as well as a sing
er."
"In America," h? went on, "the
musical comedies have given us a
tradition of integrating the arts.
Things like Rogers and Hammer
stein are almost opera. But they're
drama too—and dance, and comedy
and sets and lights. The works."
He stopped for a minute to think.
"In a way. you know,"he said, "in
a way, even the music depends on
the story. This is 'The Rake's Prog
ress': it's Tom Rakewell and his
progress down. The music is mag
nifieant, really great, but it was con
ceived as part of this story. The two
shouldn't be separated."'

Robert Rounseville was going to
continue but news came that he was
wanted on stage. More rehearsal.
"Opening night is almost on top of
us," he said, I

"In a way. you know,"he said, "in
a way, even the music depends on
the story. This is 'The Rake's Prog

They had been rehearsing
"The Rake's Progress" for most
of the evening, and now direc
tor F. Cowles Strickland called
a break. Robert Rounseville
looked tired but his voice when
he talked was enthusiastic.
''What we're trying to do here."
he said, "is to make opera good
theater too. It's supposed to be, you
know. Auden has written a terrific
libretto for "Rake" and you can't
just ignore it."
"It's so easy," he said, "to fall in

front of the stage: that sort of thing,
you know.
"But Professor Strickland is a man
interested primarily in ph'ama, and
he sees opera in terms of its drama.
I think that's a good thing."
Rounseville laughed.
"They never would let me in the
dramatic club when I was in college,"
