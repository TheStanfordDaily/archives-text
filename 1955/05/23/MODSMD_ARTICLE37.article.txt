# Tennis Team Loses Twice
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Th ings might have been
worse for the tennis team this
weekend, but looking at the
scores of the matches it's hard
to see how. Friday in a maich
closer than the score would
seem to indicate UCLA man
aged to score points in just the
right places to overwhelm the
Cards 7-2.
Saturday Stanford was hurt bad
ly by injudies in key positions and
was .slilit out 9-0 by USC.
Stanford put up a good fight
against the Bruins. Four of the sin
gles matches went three sets, but
(he Indians were able to win only
one cl these. Boger Keesing, the
only consistent winner for the Cards
this year, came off with the only
singles victory of the weekend
against UCLA's Brooke Grant. Grant
took the first set, 6-4, but Keesing
rebounded to capture the next one
6-3, and the deciding round 8-6.
The Indian captain, Jack Frost,
still playing a rather spotty game,
lost unconvincingly to the Bruins'
Dick Doss, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. Ernie Du-
Bray got off to a good start against
Joe Blatchford, but faded as Blatch
lord prevailed 5-7, 6-1, 6-2. Henry
Sutcliffe dropped his match to Craig
Carman, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3, despite his
fine second-set effort.
Coach Bob Eenker came up with
a potent doubles combination in
Keesing and Frost. Keesing's drive
and energy plus Frost's power broke
Doss and Blachford, 6-4, 3-6, 9-7.
Misfortune hit the Cards hard
Saturday. Frost, suffering from a
heel blister, didn't play and default
ed his match to SC's Jacque Grigry.
Keesing raised the spectators' hopes
for a Stanford win in his match
against Jim Perley, but he twisted
an ankle and had to be helped from
the court. The injury appeared to
be nothing more than a bad sprain,
but the match had to be defaulted.
