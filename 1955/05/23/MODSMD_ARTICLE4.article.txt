### 
WASHINGTON â€” Senator Walter
F. George said today he will sup
port President Eisenhower's special
$200,000,000 Asian aid fund "with
the necessary and proper limitations
on its use."
The Georgia Democrat, chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, told reporters he favors
using most of the money for loans
rather than outright# grants.
The $200,000,000 fund, which could
be used by the President as he sees
fit, has drawn some fire within the
committee. The group is expected
to finish action late this week on the
$."3,530,000,000 foreign aid bill, of
which the Asian fund is a part.
Senator Mike Mansfield (D.,
Mont.) said he will try to get the
provision eliminated, leaving in
regular military and economic aid
programs for Asia.
