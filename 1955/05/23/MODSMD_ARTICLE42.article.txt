## 
### 
Coach Lou Lindsey's Stanford
crews remained unbeaten as they
walloped the UCLA Bruins in all
three races last Saturday on the
Rid wood City Harbor course.
The junior varsity got the day ofT
to a good start for the Indians by
overcoming an early lead of the
Bruins to cross under the finish line,
two lengths ahead of their rivals.
The featured lace of the day saw
tlu- Indian varsity move into an t al
ly three - length lead which they
maintained throughout the remain
der of the three-mile dual. Co-cap
tain Rowd Davis allowed the stroke
to drop down to 25 after the home
shell established its supremacy dur
ing the first mile. From that point
on to the finish marker the Bruin

shell was unable to close the gap,
although they were rowing at 30.
The final wininng margin was four
lengths and the Indians were clocked
at 14:55) minutes Hat.
The Card yearlings kept the slate
clean for the home shells as they
stroked home to a two-length vic
tory on the abbreviated 2,000-meter
freshman course. The winning time
for the contest was 0:12 minutes.
