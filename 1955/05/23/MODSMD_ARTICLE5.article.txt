WASHINGTONâ€”Two top Senate
Democrats said today Russia's gl ow
ing atomic airpower challenge un
derscores the urgency for reversing
President Eisenhower's military
manpower cuts.
Senators Richard B. Russell (Ga.)
and Henry M. Jackson (Wash.)
made the statement in separate in
terviews in the wake of a high-level
argument over whether the Soviet
Union has wiped out this country's
atomic airpower lead.
Russell, chairman of the powerful
Senate Armed Services Committee,
said, "We have rather generally and
consistently underestimated the cre
ative capacity and industrial ability
of the Russians."
Jackson, a member of the Armed
Services group and the Joint Con
gressional Atomic Energy Commit
tee, said the Communists may be
able to gain a "temporary lead"
over the United States in the
production of intei lonLinental jet
bombers.
