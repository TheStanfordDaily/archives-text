The Political Union and Ram's
Head play "Waiting for Lefty" to be
presented next week is "probably
the most powerful social play ever
J written," according to Director War
ner Leßoy.
"Written in the depth of the de
pression (by Clifford Odets), it is
frankly Communist propaganda,"
adds Leßoy. "It is unsurpassed for
brutality and violence of ideas and
hits you like a Joe Louis right
cross."
The play will be presented in the
Little Theater at 8 p.m. Tuesday
i and Wednesday. Since it is Com
munist propaganda, under the ex
isting copyright it is not released
for profit performance. For this rea
son it is being presented with no
admission charge.
"Waiting for Lefty" is a one-hour
play dealing with a taxi drivers'
strike and the effect it has on the
lives of the workers. It opens with
a union meeting and closes with a
union meeting with part of the cast
seated in the audience as members
of the union. The production is be
ing presented with no sets and in
modern dress.
The cast of the play includes Doug
I Cook, Richard Learman, Carolyn
Cowan, Walt Brown, Hart Sprager,
| Gary Waynesmith, Jim Weilenman,
I Dave Penhallow, Ed Crane, and
i Joel Rogosin.
