# Fightin' Farm Frogs Finish Second Best
## 
### DICK MEISTER 
Two and a half inches from immortality.
By this measly measure Stanford's entry in the Jumping Frog
Jubilee at Angels Camp lost the intercollegiate championship to a
bouncing greenback from San Jose State.
Jack Squat, carrying the colors of the Red and White, leaped

to 10 feet, 2'j inches, only to lose to""
the Spartan's leap of 10-5.
Of course, Squat was Stanford's
second best. Cockamoon, who had
been specially groomed for the
championship, backed out at the last
minute in a fit of athletic temper
ment.
BREACH OF HONOR?
In the investigation of this seem
ing breach of frog honor owed to
the Stanford student body, the fol
lowing shocking facts were turned
up re the case of Cockamoon versus
the Stanford code of athletic honor:
Cockamoon, like all trained ath
letes. is high-strung and when in
formed that the BAC had made no
provisions for an award he refused
to jump. (It has been conceded that
Cockamoon would have been a sure
winner). We must admit that he
could have been assured a Block S
at the least.
This was unfortunate after all the
extensive training that he had un
dergone at the hands of Mark Dees
and the Stern Hall Frog Jumpers,

►
but one can't blame old Cockamoon.
He gave up a lot of social life and
party time to go into this training
and some award was due him.
And the reader shouldn't be too
harsh on him. He's only a soph and
can't be expected to have that old
"do or die spirit." He's just made
the frog jumping varsity; it takes
time to instill that college spirit.
And there's nothing to be ashamed
of in second place. Special com
mendation goes to Jack Squat, who.
in a difficult position, stepped into
the hero's spot and came home with
flying colors. It took plenty of that
old intestinal fortitude to do this and
Squat showed more than enough.
How about an award for the hero
of the hour, Jack Squat?
THE WIGGLER
The University's other entry, Dean
Wiggler, finished fifth with a 9-4
leap. Of course, as his .trainer com
mented, the Wiggler didn't have the
benefit of special training.
"He played it loose, but he gave
his all for the Indians . . . after all
could you jump nine feet?" the
trainer shot back at a scoffer in the
crowd.
Other colleges with entries were
the University of California (whose
best was 8-6 —guess we showed 'em),
the Cal Aggies, Cal Poly. Modesto
J.C., New York University, and Mad
ison Junior College. The entry from
Siam's Bankok J.C. was scratched.
COLORFUL CONTEST
All in all the contest was quite a
colorful spectacle with many col
leges sending body guards and spe
cial rooting sections for their en
tries.
Waldo, the gargantuan frog who
had been a possible Stanford entry
was disqualified because of size. He
grew so big that he couldn't fit in
his sponsors' Theta Chi House.
Winner of the world's champion
ship event was "Tule Pete" with an
enormous leap of 15-3.
