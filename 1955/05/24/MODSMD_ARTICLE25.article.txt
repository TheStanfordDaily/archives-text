# Salgo to Lead Stravinsky's ‘Rake’s’ Opera
## 
### 
"The Rake's Progress," according
to Professor Sandor Salgo, who will
conduct the modern opera in its
West Coast premiere here Thursday
night, is Stravinsky at his most lyric,
is most melodious.
"He has simply ignored the nine
teenth century,"' Salgo explained,
"and written twentieth-cetnury mu
sic that expresses his genuine admi
ration for the eighteenth - century
idiom of Mozart."
This means in the first place a
framework of recitatives that carry
forward the plot interspersed with
"set-piece" arias, duets, and so on.
"It is a small, intimate orchestra,"
Salgo said, "and in the opera's most
tense moments it becomes still
smaller. It contracts to a string
quartet and finally, in the graveyard
scene, to a single harpsichord."
"It is without a doubt," Salgo said
in summary, "the major work so far
of the twentieth century." The Uni
versity of California offers a course
in "The Rake's Progress," and Har
vard includes it in a course on the
world's ten greatest operas.
"The score," Salgo added, "is of
tremendous depth and complexity.
I cannot imagine the orchestra of
any other American university be
ing capable of performing it."
Tickets are still available for $1
and $1.50 at the Memorial IT;<11 Hoy
office from 12:30 to 4:.'10 p.m.
