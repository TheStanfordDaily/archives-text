## honor code suggestion 
### 
'I o the T. '"tor:
fie: Suggested chair es in the Honor Code.
'J he Slanfuid honor sy.vtem has impressed me ami
oy JritU'is «•; a smug, ineffectual gioup approach to
Pi ional honor.
1) The revolting requirement that we tell on others
is an linden ocraiie limitation upon our freedom of
action. We h.iv.- committed no crime if we happen
to see someone else cheating. We should not be pen
alized I y being required to do something wa do not
care to do. Fven if the group labels ratting as "hon
o;able," it does not change the nature of the act.
Gf course th 're are some who approve of the pres
ent procedure, who see nothing offensive in it per
haj ; there is a nujm ity of such individuals, though
1 doubt it. But whatever be the particular percent
agel, those whose per. l mal dignity cann »t stomach
telling oh othtrs should not be forced to do so.
2) From the articles appearing in the Daily, 1 have
garnered the impression that the board adopts a eom-
I lacent approach in trying a violator and tends to
lake his excuse at its face value. Perhaps it is Lit •
lepoiter ol the news item who is complacent and not
Men's Council. In any event, I suggest that defense
and prosecution icpresentatives be chosen from the
law school so that witnesses might be thoroughly
examined and cro-s-examined. If anyone is lying,
we should not he afraid of discovering that fact.
3) In another university, when a person cheats on
an examination, F is the appropriate punishment.
However, when a person cheats at Stanford, he also
violates a pledge, 'the minimum penally should be
suspension for one quarter. This would put some
teeth into the Honor Code.
J have made three proposals—elimination of the
tattling requirement, appointment of defense and
prosecution representatives from students in the law
school and a slifl'er minimum penalty for violators.
I request the new president to submit them to a
vote of the student body to the end that we might
have an Honor Code that is an honor code.

done a good job when ignoring the opinions of 2,389
voters and giving its own. Big numbers do not justi
fy or ennoble an opinion. How many of George
Ralph's 2,389 voters knew what he was voting for?
George had 110 platform. How could they know? Not
one out ol Ull of those voters could answer either
of these two quotations: Who is George Ralph?
What exact reforms does lie want?
£i« can;" lias riot told us what reforms he
wants. Which is fine, since lie is not obliged to.
Hi t the traditional Stanford voter's apathy indicates
not only lack of interest in impending issues, but
ignorance. 'I he ignorant always fly south like the
birds do, looking lor reform and revolution. Reform
is like fermenting matter which attracts the pseudo
intellectual Hies of the avant-garde. Hie pseudo
intellectuals sit in the Cellar and dream of reform.
Their voices are as noisy as the stomach rumblings
of a .viek elephant, and about as intelligible. Reform
has the fame delicious taste for them as the For
bidden Fruit of the Garden of Eden. Their rise is
always thunderous and their fall a bit pathetic.
Who elected George Ralph? The pseudo-intellec
tuals, the dreamt rs, the."individualists" and, above
all, the ignorant. A few honest voters also backed
George Ralph, but they were a minority among the
2,:jSy. That does, not mean that Ralph is not good.
Maybe he is a decadent social necessity. But, because
of the way in which he was elected, he now stands
alone. Ignorant voters are rarely compromised by
their votes; they are almost never responsible for
them. Are the people who voted George Ralph in
responsible enough to back his reforms? They have
voted him in vyithout knowing his reforms. Who is
to guarantee that when he does concoct them his
music will sound sweet enough for the voters to
dance to it?
When people do not know what they are voting
lor in the first place, no one is to say whether or
net they will like it when they find out what it is.
The word "reform" does not mean anything. Ralph
was elected on no platform. He may be a good man.
II he i 1 :, the Daily has certainly done him a good
turn by disassociating him from some of his sensa
tionalism and that of his voters.
