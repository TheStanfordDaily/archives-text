To the E:lit.or:
Congratulations for your editorial patience. News
papers, like people, are often alone in their opinions;
in their so-called "bias" lies their strength.
The Daily is biased in favor of a struggling, hard
working, progressive administration. President Peter
Bing has not screamed or pulled his hair. He has
not been a Radical. He has been a good, honest
man. That is enough. Anyone who sneers at and de
tracts from the work of an honest man in order to get
himself into office is running on a vacant plaUorm
and jeopardizing his own name. George Ralph has
done this and more. With one hand he has pointed
at the word "administration" and said: That is bad.
With his ether hand he has pointed at the word
"Reform" and said: That is good. His position has
been static as that of a statue spouting water.
He has not told us what he means by "reform."
2,.'189 votei - have backed him without knowing what
he mean; by "reform." They have jumped at the
word like automatons. They have voted in utter
darkness, waving their arms. The Daily has not sup
pressed George Ralph's ideas of "reform." They
simply do not seem to exist. The Daily has sup
pressed only some of the noise and the bad smell
.surroundinghis election. It has done George Ralph
a favor by keeping some of the indignity, some of
the hot air off the record.
II a newspaper has any other than the mechanical
function of reporting, it is to illuminate the people,
to j;iiide them, not to reflect their views. It fash
ions, rather than reflects, policy. This is the Ameri
can journalistic tradition. That is why the Daily has
