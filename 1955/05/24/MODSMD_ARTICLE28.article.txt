To the Editor:
There are two roisons for the success of the student
body elections this year. The first is the help the
chairman has received. I would like to thank the
Election Board member., for their assistance in organ
izing and conducting the elections and the Daily for
it.i complete coverage of the elections. The Political
Union and KZSU are responsible for the success
and publicity of the debate. The living groups aided
ip obtaining a large number of voters through their
organizing meetings where the candidates could
speak. The President, the Legislature, and the ASSU
office made possible the smooth running of the elec
tions which would not have been possible without
their suggestions and aid.
liie reorganization of the Election Board and the
improvement of voting procedure also aided in mak
ing the elections succesesful. If anyone can think
of improvements that should go into effect to make
next year's elections even better, such as preferen
tial voting, longer or shorter campaigning, or changes
in (he campaign limit, I would appreciate talking
with them this next week.
Again 1 wish to thank everyone who helped make
successful elections possible at Stanford.
ERIC N. FRICKER
Chairman, Election Board

cellent organization and handling of three elections
