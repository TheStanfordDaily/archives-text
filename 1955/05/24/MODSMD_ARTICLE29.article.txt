Do you want to know how passionate your
kiss is? Or have you a particular desire to
know why the Pisa Tower leans? Or are you
consumed with curiosity to know why quick
sand is quick instead of slow?
According to the Spartan Daily at San Jose
Slate, the answers to all of these questions were
available when the SJS Electronics Department
held its open house.
They featured a "top-secret Kiss-O-Meter,"
an ice making machine, and a wind tunnel.
However, according to the Daily, they could
find no connection among the three.
Apparently other things come from Bermuda
besides shorts. Things to wear, that is, because
the Daily Bruin at UCLA recently carried a story
on an "all-Bermuda" fashion show. The Ladies
of UCLA promised previews of what would
be fashionable in Bermuda (and elsewhere) ihis
summer.
A feature of the fashion show, according to
the Bruin, was to be a pineapple juice drinking
contest, but they didn't tell how one went
about it.

Bottles, bottles everywhere, and all of them
empty. The Rocky Mountain Colleqian at Colo
rado A&M recently carried an announcement
regarding the Phi Kappa Tau Bar Room Open
House Tea (that was its name!) and gave out
the information that students could find their
way to it by following a line of empty bottles.
According to the Collecjian, root beer, potato
chips, and pretzels were to comprise the menu
for the occasion.
The Washington Daily, at the University of
Washington, came through with the week's
most exciting bit of information.
Snuggled down at the bottdm of a column
was the following paragraph: "Clean and peel
fruit and vegetables on paper for easy disposal
of the peelings. No mess to clean from the
sink."
And the headline of the week must be the
one from the Texas A&M Battalion. It reads "In
vitations now Ready for Pick Up," or seniors
may pick up graduation announcements.
