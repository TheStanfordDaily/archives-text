# ‘MILLION DOLLAR NOTHING'
## 'Prodigal' Is Mixture Of ‘Sex and Schmaltz' 
### JACK BYRNE 
"The Prodigal," one of those
maqloria pictures now running at the Varsity, turns out to be a
million-dollar nothing.
Perhaps some people can excuse themselves from attending
Sunday school on the strength of seeing this flick, but 1 maintain

that the .story is a lot further lost
than the prodigal son. In the process
of adding sex and schmaltz, he who
was lost and now is found really
doesn't seem to matter.
What does the picture have? Well,
there's that lovable Edmond Pur
dom, who appears at various times
with and without beard in the role
of the roving son. There's Lana
Turner, way past her acting peak,
trying to look like the high priestess
of Astarte (titular head of a free
love sect) should, or at least the way
Hollywood thinks she should.
And there's Louis Calhearn, who
still has a very fine sneer, which he
looses on the infidel Christians, sun
dry slaves, etc.
But that's not all. The writers for
this picture had a predisposition for
barbecue. Not only do they roast
the fatted calf for the return of the
prodigal, but they also take delight
in hurling sacrifices, high priest
esses, and such into a flaming mouth
of hell, handily located in the love
sect temple.
For variety, they serve warriors,
slaves, and Christians alike up on
flaming spears, a la shishkabob.
Or if this palls, you can have the
scene where a supposedly dead (but
no such luck) prodigal gets hurled
into the bone pit and fights to the
death with an unconvincing vulture.
It's just not a good picture. Ad
vice for the day is to take her to the
Guild. And save 35 cents in the bar
gain.
