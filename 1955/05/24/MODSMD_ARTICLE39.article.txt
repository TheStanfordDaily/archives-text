# Taylor Pleased As Gridders End Workouts
## 
### 
Coach Chuck Taylor stated after
last Saturday's spring practice final
that he was "quite pleased" with the
way his boys had progressed
throughout the four-week practice
session, Chuck went on to say that
the Indians had "come along better
than expected" and that they were
definitely ahead of last year's team
at the end of the spring workouts.
Taylor thought his pupils looked
good in their last outing of the sea
son when the Whites downed the
lk>ds, 14-7, in a hard-fought "game"
in the Stadium. Outstanding per
formances were turned in by half
backs Lou Villii and Jerry Angove,
guard Don Carswell, and fullback
Bob Schmidt who shone on defense.
Valli carried the ball 12 times for
120 yards in addition to having a 23-
yard scamper called back.
The Indians are well stocked in
the backfield according to Taylor,
but the coach is worried over the
lack of depth at the tackle and end
positions. The quarterback spot is
particularly strong where Taylor
may choose from veterans Jerry
Gustafson and John Qrodie, last
year's JV standout Jack Lewis, or
Jackie Douglas, up from the frosh.
Chuck believes that any one of these
four could take over the signal
calling job on next fall's eleven.
The coach declined to make any
further comments until he has had a
chance to review the movies of the
game. However, Taylor added that
his boys "will be in a position to
hurt any team they encounter next
year." The head Indian mentor said
he didn't want to put anyone on the
spot as being Rose Bowl-bound, but
he indicated that his eleven will be
ready to face its 10-game schedule
which includes some of the nation's
top teams.
