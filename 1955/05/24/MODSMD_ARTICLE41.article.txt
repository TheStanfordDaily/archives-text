# Farm Links Makes Champions As Stanford Gains Golf Supremacy
## 
### DICK NICHOLS 
Stanford University boasts a his
tory of great golf teams. Ever since
192G, when Stanford first tied the
University of California in a golf
match, the Farm has boasted more
than able representation on the
links.
In 1929, Charles Davis became the
first coach of golf at Stanford. The
Indians beat Cal that year, 17-10,
and went on to their first undefeated

season, with five wins.
In 1931, Eddie Twiggs took "over
the coaching. Coach Twiggs' first
three teams were among his be<-t,
but their strength was never tested,
since Stanford didn't enter the Na
tionals until 1934.
Sparkplug of the era was long
hitting Charlie Seaver, later a state
champion and member of the Walker
Cup team. Seaver was recently
elected to the Stanford Hall of Fame.
LAWSON LITTLE LEADS TEAM
Following in Seaver's footsteps
was Lawson Little. Little, as a mem
ber of the 1934 team, won the match
play in the Northern California In
tercollegiates at Pasatiempo and was
chosen to the Walker Cup team.
From 1938 to 1942. Stanford's golf
teams enjoyed their Golden Age.
During these five years, Stanford
won four national championships. In
collegiate dual meet competition, the
Card golfers won 23, lost 1. and tied
1. The strongest team of this era
was the 1941 outfit, led by Bud
Finger, now the Card's coach. Bud
Brownell, in November of 1941. shot

nine 4's and nine 3's for an eight
under-par G3 and the course record.
In 194(5, Stanford's golfers still
showed they had the winning habit
by coming through with another
National championship. Leading this
team were Bob Rosburg and Bob
Cardinal.
TWIGGS ENDS CAREER
At the end of 1948, Coach Twiggs
retired. In eleven tries at a national
championship, he had won five
crowns and taken a second and a
third. His teams had won 15 Pa
cific Coast championships in 15 years.
Bud Finger succeeded Twiggs in
1949. Since then he has brought the
team to several PCC championships,
including 1952, when the Indians
scored an all-time low of 587 strokes.
The varsity went undefeated in
dual match play again this year, and
will be gunning for a National
Championship starting June 18 back
in Knoxville, Tennessee.
