# Cards Falter At Modesto
## 
### 
Stanford finished ninth in the 14th
annual Modesto Relays Saturday
night. The crowd of 7,000 was treat
ed to three world records, although
We.s Santee's 1:48.5 in the 880 will
not count, since Lon Spurrier's
1:47.5 will probably be approved by
the AAU.
Bud Held, ex-Stanford javelinist,
broke his own world record with a
toss of 2(iB-2'l>, and the University
of Texas 440 relay team broke their
own mark with a time of :40.2 in a
very close race. Stanford finished
fourth.
The Cards could garner only ll'.'i
points in a meet that .saw Texas
come out on top with .'!4. USC, UC
LA, LAAC, and the Olympic Club
finished in that order to take the
next four places.
The Stanford javelin aggregation,
scourge of the colleges, went un
placed as club representatives Held,
Bill Miller, Cy Young, and Leo Long
dominated the event. Neither John

Bugge nor Bob Kimball could even
qualify for the finals as they threw
only approximately 215 feet.
Stanford failed to take one first
place, as Frank Herrmann slipped to
a disappointing 23-5 for fourth place
in trie broad jump, and the mile re
lay team, victorious last week at
Fresno, went unplaced.
Although the team performance
was not up to par, several individ
uals came through with good efforts.
Bob Hyde ran a :48.8 in the mile
relay, and Jim Luttrell managed a
:48.6 quarter in the medley relay.
The mile relay team did its best
ever with a 3:16.0 clocking, but the
winning time was 3:12 and again the
Stanford team was shut out.
Bernie Nelson grabbed a second
in the high hurdles, and the 880 re
lay squad, also winners last week,
took a fourth, and John Stewart
garnered the Cards V4 point with a
four-way tie for fourth in the high
jump at 6-2.

Javelinist John Bugge won the
Zeimer award for trackman show
ing most improvement during the
season at the track banquet Sun
day night. Bugge, a senior from
Los Alios, had a best throw of 211
feet last year, and lias gone up to
22!) this season.

We.s Santee's 1:48.5 in the 880 will
not count, since Lon Spurrier's
1:47.5 will probably be approved by
the AAU.

toss of 2(iB-2'l>, and the University

points in a meet that .saw Texas

only approximately 215 feet.

uals came through with good efforts.
Bob Hyde ran a :48.8 in the mile
relay, and Jim Luttrell managed a
:48.6 quarter in the medley relay.
The mile relay team did its best
ever with a 3:16.0 clocking, but the

Stanford team was shut out.

lay squad, also winners last week,
took a fourth, and John Stewart
garnered the Cards V4 point with a
four-way tie for fourth in the high
