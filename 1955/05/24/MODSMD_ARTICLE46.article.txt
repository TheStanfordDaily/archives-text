# Coast Conference
## 
### 
PORTLAND. Ore., May 23 (UP)â€”
The Pacific Coast Conference
opened its four-day spring meeting
here today with a decision expected
before the week is out on whether
the ban on spring football practice
will go into effect next season.
The PCC earlier had voted to
abandon spring football practice
starting in 1956 but many coaches
feel this would put the PCC at a
disadvantage and a move was ex
pected to try to get the ruling re
versed.
