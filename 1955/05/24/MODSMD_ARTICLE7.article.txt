icy Committee has agreed unani
mously that President Eisenhower's
$101,000,000,000 highway program is

the President's program on two
counts:
1. It would allot more money to
an interstate highway system and
less to state and farm-to-market
roads. He called this a "bonds for
boulevards" plan.
2. It would let the administration
rather than Congress decide wheth
er the money should be spent. John
