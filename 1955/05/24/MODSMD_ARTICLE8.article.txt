# U.S. to Clarify Vaccine Confusion
## 
### 
WASHINGTONâ€”The government
hopes to clear up tomorrow some of
the confusion in the Salk polio vac
cination program. The tangled sit
uation prompted one New England
city today to call off all inoculations
until fall.
The Board of Health of Brockton.
Mass., voted to cancel its vaccinal
tions, scheduled to start Thursday,
because of "the unstable condition
concerning vaccine." It was the first
city to take such drastic action, al
though others have deferred their
programs temporarily.
