# Tory Victory Predicted
## 
### JIM PALMER 
The Conservatives will win the
election in Britain this Thursday,
and it is expected that they will
increase their Pariamentary ma
jority to 60 seats.
This was the opinion of Professors
Carl F. Brand oi the History De
partment and Philip W. Buck of the
Political Science Department, as
they assessed the British election
candidates, campaign issues, and
prospects in recent Daily inter
views.
"Political factors weigh more
heavily in this election than in any
election of the century," Brand de
clared. "Things are at their best in
Britain right now for the Conserva
tives."
He pointed out that a Gallup poll,
"amazingly accurate" in Britain in
the past, placed the Conservatives 4
per cent ahead of Labor at the
time the election was called. "This
would have meant about a 100-seat
majority for the Tories."
"Eden has enjoyed a series of tri
umphs or settlements in foreign pol
icy. . . . Also, reduced income taxes
have strengthened the position of
the Conservatives."
"Britain is prosperous, on the
whole, as it has not been for many,
many years ... a knife-edge pros
perity dependent on world condi
tions. People have more money to
spend, small bank savings are in
creased, and there is more to eat and
to wear."
These reasons, and a split in the
ranks of the Labor party, have been
among the determining factors in
the calling of the election for May
26, Brand believes. "For in six

months hence the situation might
not be nearly as good."
Buck admitted that while he
thought the calling of the election
for late May was "premature" at the
time it was announced a few weeks
ago, "I think it is a good gamble
now . . . the Conservatives are in
a favorable position."
The four-power talks operate in
favor of the Conservatives, Buck
said. "They can claim credit for
this. Churchill made the proposal
a few years ago (Feb. 14, 1950)."
Buck foresees another very close
election in terms of popular vote. In
the last general election in 1951, the
Conservatives controlled the Par
liament, but polled some 250,000
votes less than Labor.
"Three elections (1945, 1950, 1951)

have all reflected the general atti
tude that it isn't easy to make a
choice. There are no decisive dif
ferences between the parties . . .
there is general agreement in vari
ous aspects of policy."
Brand noted that in eight minis
terial changes in the last 60 years
in which there was no shift in party
control, not a single time was an
election held to renew the mandate
of the people. Therefore, Eden's
statement in calling the election
was "a novel constitutional doc
trine."
Brand, agreed with Buck that
there is no single outstanding issue
between the two parties. "They are
struggling to find issues." Brand
stated, "but Labor has not found one
yet on which it can hope to over
throw the Conservatives."
"The British people are close to
gether," he said. "The Conserva
tives have accepted most of what
Labor has done, have accepted the
welfare state in practice, and have
even claimed credit for it."
The leading candidates, Buck con
tends, are very similar in some re
spects too. "Eden and Attlee are
calm, quiet men, regarded with con
fidence by the people. They are not
totally different, although they do
differ on some views . . . but only
in a sense."
Labor's Attlee has had more min
isterial experience over a long time,
Buck said, but Eden is no newcom
er either. "He has been in cabinet
positions since the 1930's—he's expe
rienced, and liked and trusted by
Churchill."

Labor has done, have accepted the

The leading candidates, Buck con

spects too. "Eden and Attlee are
calm, quiet men, regarded with con

in a sense."

DR. PHILIP W. BUCK
The Conservatives will win the
election in Britain this Thursday,
and it is expected that they will
increase their Pariamentary ma
jority to 60 seats.
This was the opinion of Professors
Carl F. Brand oi the History De
partment and Philip W. Buck of the
Political Science Department, as
they assessed the British election
candidates, campaign issues, and
prospects in recent Daily inter
views.
"Political factors weigh more
heavily in this election than in any
election of the century," Brand de
clared. "Things are at their best in
Britain right now for the Conserva
tives."
He pointed out that a Gallup poll,
"amazingly accurate" in Britain in
the past, placed the Conservatives 4
per cent ahead of Labor at the
time the election was called. "This
would have meant about a 100-seat
majority for the Tories."
"Eden has enjoyed a series of tri
umphs or settlements in foreign pol
icy. . . . Also, reduced income taxes
have strengthened the position of
the Conservatives."
"Britain is prosperous, on the
whole, as it has not been for many,
many years ... a knife-edge pros
perity dependent on world condi
tions. People have more money to
spend, small bank savings are in
creased, and there is more to eat and
to wear."
These reasons, and a split in the
ranks of the Labor party, have been
among the determining factors in
the calling of the election for May
26, Brand believes. "For in six

months hence the situation might
not be nearly as good."
Buck admitted that while he
thought the calling of the election
for late May was "premature" at the
time it was announced a few weeks
ago, "I think it is a good gamble
now . . . the Conservatives are in
a favorable position."
The four-power talks operate in
favor of the Conservatives, Buck
said. "They can claim credit for
this. Churchill made the proposal
a few years ago (Feb. 14, 1950)."
Buck foresees another very close
election in terms of popular vote. In
the last general election in 1951, the
Conservatives controlled the Par
liament, but polled some 250,000
votes less than Labor.
"Three elections (1945, 1950, 1951)

have all reflected the general atti
tude that it isn't easy to make a
choice. There are no decisive dif
ferences between the parties . . .
there is general agreement in vari
ous aspects of policy."
Brand noted that in eight minis
terial changes in the last 60 years
in which there was no shift in party
control, not a single time was an
election held to renew the mandate
of the people. Therefore, Eden's
statement in calling the election
was "a novel constitutional doc
trine."
Brand, agreed with Buck that
there is no single outstanding issue
between the two parties. "They are
struggling to find issues." Brand
stated, "but Labor has not found one
yet on which it can hope to over
throw the Conservatives."
"The British people are close to
