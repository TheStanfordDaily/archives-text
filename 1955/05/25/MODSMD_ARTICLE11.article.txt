science, before an attentive

ence in Memorial Auditorium.
'"One might well concede that con

explored the question of "Who
Makes Our Foreign Policy?"
SAGACIOUS STATESMAN
In appraising the powers of the
President in the foreign policy field,
the noted foreign service expert and
author made a number of evalua
tions on doctrines, personalities and
events concerned with the foreign
policy.
Stuart commented on John Foster
Dulles: "I believe he is a sagacious,
successful statesman"; on the Brick
er Amendment: "It would take us
back to the Articles of Confedera
tion ... it demoralizes , executive
action . . . and hamstrings the Presi
dent;" on the Monroe Doctrine: "It
is a successful doctrine of security;"
on the Point Four policy: "A very
munificent doctrine"; on Roosevelt's
appointment of Stettinius as Secre
tary of State: "Roosevelt passed over
many names because he wanted a
man who would take orders and not
answer back."
IN FOREIGN SERVICE
Stuart, who retired from Stanford
in 1952 to become a U.S. State De
partment adviser, disclosed that 125
Stanford graduates are in the foreign
service field. "Two are ambassadors,
and 10 are ministers or counsels."
Assessing the role of the State De
partment and the foreign service,
Stuart summarized, "The President's
power is very vast. He has the re
sponsibility for foreign policy prob
lems, but they are so many and so
complex that he needs expert help."
