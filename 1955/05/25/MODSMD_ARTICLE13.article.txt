# Sets of 'Rake' Are 'Elegant Says Designer
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
"What we've tried to do," said
: Wendell Cole, stage designer
for the Stanford Players-Music
Department production of the
I "Rake's Progress," "is to ap
proach the settings in the same
way the opera approaches its
material."
This means, according to Cole, the
! eighteenth-century idiom treated in
; a modern and hence slightly satir
ical tone.
The production utilizes an inner
proscenium typical of the 1700's.
I "When one scene ends," Cole said,
"the inner curtain drops and the next
scene starts in front of it without
any break in the music."
Six settings are required, the key
note of which, according to Cole, is
"artificiality and elegance." Several
j of them use 18th century "wing-and
j drop" construction: a painted back
j ground hung behind two canvass
) wings.
j Included are the garden of Anne
I Trulove, Mother Goose's brothel, the
j exterior of Tom Rakewell's home,
j the interior of Tom Rakewell's home,
I a cemetery, and Bedlam.
Gadgets required range from a
machine that turns rocks to bread,
to a sedan chair on which Baba, the
bearded lady is carried. The script
| also calls for disappearances and
sudden visions.
The opera opens tomorrow, in its
' West Coast premiere, at 8:15 in Me
morial Auditorium. Robert Rounse
vi He. who created the role of Tom
Rakewell in the show's 1951 world
premiere in Venice, heads a cast of
young professionals and student
lingers. Francis Barnes appears as
Nick Shadow, and Ruth Roehr as
Anne Trulove.
Stage director is F. Cowles Strick
land, and musical director is Sandor
