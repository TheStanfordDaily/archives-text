# Brand, Buck Describe British Election Issues

(This is the second and last of a series of interviews with Dr. Carl F.
Bland of the History department and Dr. Philip W. Buck of the Po
litical Science department about the British elections.—Ed.)

Tomorrow is election day in Great Britain, and D-Day for Britain's
two major parties, Labor and Conservative. Several million voters
will cast ballots for 630 Members of Parliament, with the prize of
national leadership going to the party gaining a majority of seats.
At the time the British election was called, the Labor Party

seemed hopelessly split between the'*
right-wing moderation of Clement
Attlee and the left-wing aggressive
ness of Aneurin Bevan, according to
History Professor Carl F. Brand.
LABOK UNITED
"But now. Labor has closed its I
ranks. Bevan has made a written
apology and has promised to be |
good. For the purpose of the elec
tion, Labor stands united."
The position of Bevan has been
described as "militant" by Political!
Science Professor Philip W. Buck.
"The right wing moderates say
'let's go slow . . . let's be cautious
. . . let's build slowly on what has
been done.' Bevan, on the other j
hand, has been more aggressive."
Beva n i t e views, according to
Brand, include (1) nuclear weapons |
—don't use them against aggression
with conventional weapons; (2)
"anti - Americanism" — British de- 1
pendence on America is not good.
Bevan disagrees with American
policy. He also presses for greater j
application of Labor reform in Eng
land.
"The Bevanites on the left have
been farther from the official Labor
viewpoint than the two parties are
from each other," Brand added.
QUIET CAMPAIGN
"The campaign has been a fairly
quiet one because each candidate is
limited to about $800 for expenses. |
However, radio and television are i
playing a large role. . . . People can
sit at home and see the great na
tional leaders.
"As a result, only handfuls at- !
tend the meetings of local candi- j
dates."

The observer of the Thursday i
election can watch certain areas for ,
indication of party strength, Brand ;
declared. These are:
1. Areas where there is a floating
Liberal vote, such as Mid-Bedford
shire, and no Liberal candidate. The
Liberal party (with only 104 candi
dates) has been continually waning
in strength. Buck believes that
"they won't amount to much at all j
after this election . . . this is the end j
of them."
2. Areas on the fringe of large
industrial centers. These places ade
where the sentiment is likely to be
mixed between the industrial La- j
borites and the suburban Conserva- (
tives.
3. Discontented areas, including j
Lancashire where the cotton textile
industry is disturbed over prices.
TIDE MAY TURN
In these three areas, the tide may
be turned on such issues as housing
(the Conservatives can boast of j
building more houses than the La- j
borites), the cost of living (Labor j
points out a rise in prices), slight j
differences in health programs, and :
"greater equality" in the school
system (Labor is pressing for an
American - type comprehensive
school, while the Tories favor differ
entiation of students on three levels
determined by an examination at
age 11).
The?e domestic differences which
will influence the vote in the key
areas are of degree and method, not
of general ideas, Brand pointed out.
Thus, the observer can expect a
close election in terms of popular
vote.
But neither Brand nor Buck fore- !
sees anything but a Conservative
victory in light of British prosperity,
international hopefulness, and La
bor's internal struggle.

been done.' Bevan, on the other j
hand, has been more aggressive."
Beva n i t e views, according to
Brand, include (1) nuclear weapons |
—don't use them against aggression
with conventional weapons; (2)
"anti - Americanism" — British de- 1
pendence on America is not good.
Bevan disagrees with American
policy. He also presses for greater j
application of Labor reform in Eng
land.
"The Bevanites on the left have
been farther from the official Labor
viewpoint than the two parties are
from each other," Brand added.
QUIET CAMPAIGN
"The campaign has been a fairly
quiet one because each candidate is
limited to about $800 for expenses. |
However, radio and television are i
playing a large role. . . . People can
sit at home and see the great na
tional leaders.
"As a result, only handfuls at- !
tend the meetings of local candi- j
dates."

The observer of the Thursday i
election can watch certain areas for ,
indication of party strength, Brand ;
declared. These are:
1. Areas where there is a floating
Liberal vote, such as Mid-Bedford
shire, and no Liberal candidate. The
Liberal party (with only 104 candi
dates) has been continually waning
in strength. Buck believes that
"they won't amount to much at all j
after this election . . . this is the end j
of them."
2. Areas on the fringe of large
industrial centers. These places ade
where the sentiment is likely to be
mixed between the industrial La- j
borites and the suburban Conserva- (
tives.
3. Discontented areas, including j
Lancashire where the cotton textile
industry is disturbed over prices.
TIDE MAY TURN
In these three areas, the tide may
be turned on such issues as housing
(the Conservatives can boast of j
building more houses than the La- j
borites), the cost of living (Labor j
points out a rise in prices), slight j
differences in health programs, and :
"greater equality" in the school
system (Labor is pressing for an
American - type comprehensive
school, while the Tories favor differ
entiation of students on three levels
determined by an examination at
age 11).
The?e domestic differences which
will influence the vote in the key
areas are of degree and method, not
of general ideas, Brand pointed out.
Thus, the observer can expect a
close election in terms of popular
vote.
But neither Brand nor Buck fore- !
sees anything but a Conservative
victory in light of British prosperity,
international hopefulness, and La
bor's internal struggle.

Tomorrow is election day in Great Britain, and D-Day for Britain's
two major parties, Labor and Conservative. Several million voters
will cast ballots for 630 Members of Parliament, with the prize of
national leadership going to the party gaining a majority of seats.
At the time the British election was called, the Labor Party

seemed hopelessly split between the'*
right-wing moderation of Clement
Attlee and the left-wing aggressive
ness of Aneurin Bevan, according to
History Professor Carl F. Brand.
LABOK UNITED
"But now. Labor has closed its I
ranks. Bevan has made a written
apology and has promised to be |
good. For the purpose of the elec
tion, Labor stands united."
The position of Bevan has been
described as "militant" by Political!
Science Professor Philip W. Buck.
"The right wing moderates say
'let's go slow . . . let's be cautious
. . . let's build slowly on what has
been done.' Bevan, on the other j
