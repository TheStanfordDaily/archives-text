many events. Miss Barnes was a
member of the Stanford team that
defeated USC in debate and won a

ciation.
Hudson and Ardzrooni traveled to j
Moscow, Idaho, to participate in the!
recent Pacific Forensic League
tournaments, where Ardzrooni won |

a trophy in after-dinner speaking.
He also earned a prize in Western
Speech Association competition.
Hudson won impromptu speaking
honors in a Pi Kappa Delta invi
tational competition.

Ardzrooni pondered, "Our chances
of producing a winner are fairly
good.
The honor of winning a .TofTre de
bate is accorded to the school, but
| students do not speak as a team,
