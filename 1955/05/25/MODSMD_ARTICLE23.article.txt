ASSU Legislature will meet for a short ses
sion tonight in the annual "lame duck" period.
With u new administration, pledged to reform,
waiting to take office in the fall, ASSU President
Pete Bing is reluctant to take on a large volume
of new business.
"We've got the bulk of the year's work be
hind us," says Bing, "and the meeting will
cover laigely matters of routine." Matters of
routine will include consideration of a few
more organization by-laws and a report on
progress of the plans for the new student union.
Other than thai, Bing finds little on his agenda.
Looking ahead to working on the Legislature
again nexi fall are four members of the Legis
lature which will meet tonight. Class repre
sentatives Bob Bowden, lon Cosovich, Dave

Brownwood, and Jeanne Tabscott will fill out
their constitutional terms of office, which end
at the end of autumn quarter. Bowden, Coso
vich, and Brownwood have spent much of this
year in Excom and Legislature; all were elected
in the autumn quarter elections. Miss Tabscott
was only recently appointed to take the place
of Steve Voykovich in the Legislature. These
four will be the last class representatives to sit
on the Legislature under the present constitu
tion, which provides that in the future class
representatives will be members of the new
Cabinet.

So it's a process of winding up the year's
business and marking time for the Legislature.
The meeting will begin at '7:30 p.m. in the Ex
com room, Student Union.
