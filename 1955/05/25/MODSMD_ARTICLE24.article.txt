a point . . . missed

Referring to the recent ASSU election results,
the Daily's editorial comment, and ensuing letters
to the editor, the writer of the following letter said
"(his letter is representative of a much more widely
( xpressed feeling prevalent among my associates
over several years. For this reason, I believe that it
should he printed anonymously." He indicated that
"it is a combined opinion of some twenty persons."
â€”Ed.
To the Editor:
Generally, the point has been missed. Check your
I'.raduale and senior class vote; ask a few questions.
Gocr;jo, you are a bit unfortunate, for though we
marl: I 'George Ralph' on our ballots, we did not
vote for you.
We participated in high school politico, but time
and interest have shortened at Stanford. And we
i ave witnessed little maturity in politics and poli
ticians in four years. Several recent remarks on the
empty in-'gnificance of certain portions of student
government seemed appropriate when made.
No. we are not anarchists; obviously there are

worthwhile undertakings, both nebulous and concrete
in outward appearance. And we do not begrudge the
participants their interest and pleasure. Yet their
actions, assured compatible with the general dignity
o!' the University by an able administration, are oth
erwise of little interest to us. We have demon
strated this indifference through apathy toward a
new constitution.
We really shoulrl apologize to you, George. We
didn't think you either serious or sincere. Your early
remarks were, after all, quite succulent, and we
loved them. But we did not give you a "mandate for
reform," nor had we a "sweeping wave of optimism."
We had not even made an "agonizing reappraisal" of
the role oi student government. We merely had a
good laugh at the polls; each vote was a joke written
on the general ridiculousness of Stanford politics.
The "citizen's duty to vote" was not in our minds, for
the worthwhile activities of this government are
really independent of a politician's claims before the
polls. Yes, we really just had a good laugh.
"What now. George?" Sorry, but we really don't
give a damn anyway.
