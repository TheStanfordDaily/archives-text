BILL NICHOLS

In 1923 a coach left Berkeley to come to Stanford to handle minor sports
as gymnastics and wrestling. He's been here ever since, and is retiring this
June after 34 years of fathful service. His name is Ernest Paul Hunt,
better know as "Husky."
Husky's primary interest after coaching Indians is studying them. He is
an expert on the American Indians of the southwest.
The Atheltic department honored him last Saturday at the Block 'S'
banquet, with a richly deserved ceremony. Highlight of the event was
when Seraphim 'Dynamite' Post, an All-Ameiican guard at Stanford in
1928, presented the retiring mentor with a Block S blanket, which had 34
stars surrounding the big S in the middle.
Hunt's gymnastics teams haven't been too successful of late, mainly from

lack of emphasis leading to a dearth
of performers, but this year's team
certainly made up in spirit what it
lacked in quality.
The sidehorse men and ropeclimb
ers et al haven't beaten Cal in 26
years now, but this Spring they
thought they had a chance. How
ever injuries and draft tests knocked
out several key performers and
frustration was again the order of
the day.
Al Masters, however, is working
hard to lind a top gymnastics coach
to take over, and has promised the
performers a full time coach next
fall.

Incidentally, Dynie Post, who
played on Pop Warner's outstanding
teams of the late 1920's and early
'30's, was one half of a remarkable
team. Don Robesky, his running
mate at the other guard spot, was
also named to several All-American
teams that same year. Two A-A

guards from the same school in the same year is quite an honor.

You say that track is all individual effort, and that team morale has
no part? Bud Bradford, senior track manager wants you to know differ
ently. He says that one of the big factors in the Indians' successes this
season has been the tremendous team spirit that has been developed. Brad
lord states that one of the chief reasons for this improvement has been the
exchange dinners that the tracksters have had this year.
In order to get together as a group more often, four times this quarter,
the trackmen have "exchanged" with groups on campus. Breakers, und the
Deke, Fiji, and SAE dining quarters have been turned over to the Weier
shauser squad once each, and their regular occupants have eaten where
ihe trackmen regularly eat —spread out all over campus.
It's a two-way deal since the regular members of these organizations
get to eat with new people also, and Bradford rates it as a sparkling suc
cess. Unfortunately, chances of it being expanded too much more are
slight since it entails lots of work organizing the switch.
Don't underrate Bradford, himself, as a big factor in the morale boost
found in this year's spikers. Bradford was chosen as the person who had
contributed the most inspirationally to his sport.

Spring football practices are all over now. and after viewing the final
scrimmage last Saturday we can promise that Stanford will be a very
interesting team to watch next fall. The Taylormen have lacked out
standing runners during the last three years, and there is nothing prettier
to watch than a long broken field run. The runners were definitely
dominant in the scrimmage, although the passers, even without two top
ends, John Stewart and Joel Fries, looked fairly sharp.
Lou Valli was the most spectacular, buv he's only a soph and is behind
Bill Tarr, the leading ground gainer last fall. The most spectacular of
all, judging from the advance notices, is a back who hasn't donned a red
and white uniform yet. He's A 1 Harrington, a Hawaiian now at Menlo
J.C., who will be here in September. He's supposed to be the greatest
since Herman Wedemeyer, the post-war St. Mary's flash who was plenty
good. The running game will add much to the attack come next year.
As one of the Stanford coaches put it"The passing game will go much
better, if the defense has to pull in tight to guard against a run."

Word is also in from the other schools, and from the looks of it, the PCC
will have to send their second best team to the Rose Bowl again this year.
USC, who lost to Ohio State last Jan. Ist, is the top choice to walk off
with all the marbles* Jon Arnett will be back, and C. R. Roberts, up from
the frosh, almost tore the Varsity boys apart in Spring drills.
The Bruins lose most of their terrific line in June via graduation, and
their problem rests in whether Ronnie "How am I doin'. Dad?" Knox can
take up the slack. The golden one broke a finger on his throwing hand
midway through the Bruin drills, so didn't get too much chance to show
his stuff.
The Golden Bear seems headed for another lean year. (Last year,
4-4-4). Paul Larson, Matt Hazletine, and Jim Hanifan are gone, and we
beat their frosh 60-0, but Jerry Drew and some good linemen might make
it tough for Stanford on November 19 in the Stadium.
