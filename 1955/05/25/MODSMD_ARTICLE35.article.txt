# PCC Retains Spring Ball
## 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore., May 24 (UP) â€”
The Pacific Coast Conference today
decided to continue spring football
practice.
The PCC thus reversed a ruling
made late last year at which spring
practice was to be banned, effective
in 1956. H. P. (Dick) Everest, con
ference spokesman, said the move
was decided upon "in all fairness"
to West Coast athletes who compete
intersectionally against teams where
spring workouts are allowed.
The PCC, in the second day of its
spring meeting here, also named
members of a three-man athletic
code enforcement board. The board
will be empowered to do fact find
ing, call witnesses, and recommend
action to the conference commis
sioner.
There also was a hint that ath
letes might be allowed to make more
"cost-of-living" money doing work
while attending school.
Spring football practice will re
main under present rules in which
20 days of practice are allowed in
any 30 consecutive days. The deci
sion to continue spring workouts
was made by faculty athletic repre
sentatives, who pointed to the largo
number of intersectional contests
played by PCC elevens.
