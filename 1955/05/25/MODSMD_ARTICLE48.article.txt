# Theta Chi Gypsy Dance to Be Held
## 
### 
The Theta Chi house will hold its
annual all-campus gypsy dance Sat
urday night from 9 to 1. In an effort
to repeat its success of last year,
Theta Chi has secured much of the
same entertainment of past years,
including A 1 Schaaf and his orches
tra, Dare Stark McMullen's fortune
telling, and possibly guitarist-magi
cian Don Marteen.
Hay rides, dancing on the "Star
light" roof, and refreshments by the
courtesy of "Mr. Mac," the house
cook, will also be included.
