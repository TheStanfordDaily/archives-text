WASHINGTON, May 24 — Presi

a Russian proposal to convert Ger
many into a neutral barrier between
the free and Communist worlds,
Secretary of State John Foster Dul

The Secretary went on to say that
the U.S. view is that a policy of
neutrality has no application to a
country like Germany. He said it
was all right to talk about neutrality
for a small country like Austria.
But he doubted any realist believes
Germany's 70,000,000 people are des
tined for a neutral role.
