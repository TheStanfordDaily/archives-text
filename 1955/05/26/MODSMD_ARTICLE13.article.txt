# Sharp Timing and Color Highlight Farm Aquacade
## 
### ELLEN SPIEGL 
Split second timing and colorful movement highlighted last
night's 'Water Colors,' the Stanford Swim Club's annual aqua
cade. The final performance will be given tonight at 8:30 at the
v/omen's pool. Tickets are available and may be obtained from
swim club members or from the ASSU office. No admission is
charged.
Each of the 13 numbers presented was an abstract mood interpre-

tation of a color or combination of
colors. The show opened with a
sophisticated representation in wa
ter ballet of black and white. Un
usual stunts and precision timing
keynoted the number.
Syncopation was the theme of the
gold number. Katie Siever and Sue
Brady, dressed in oriental type gold
crowns and white suits, demonstrat
ed unusual use of the hands and
arms in adapted strokes.
The first half of the show closed
with a number representing indigo.
Members of Orchesis presented
their interpretation of the color at
the edge of the pool before the 12
members of the swim club presented
a floating interpretation of the color.
"Mood Indigo" was the musical.se
lection and the girls, dressed in in
digo suits and caps, moved through
the water by sculling into floating
patterns without rippling the sur
face.
During the intermission Karin
Opsahl presented a paddleboard
dance routine. Her Spanish red suit
and white face veil added to the
unusual dance which required grace
and balance while moving" through
the water.
Emcee Lee Holiday kept the show
moving at a rapid pace. Early in the
second half, Sally Phillips, Swim
Club president, presented her inter
pretation of chartreuse, to the mu
sic of "Oh, Susanna." She ably dem
onstrated the skill and poise which
helped her become a member of the
championship national synchronized
swimming team.
The kickboard novelty number, in
yellow, displayed remarkable adap
tability. The 12 girls who swam in
the number wielded the board with
skill and clockwork timing, and
their bright yellow costumes and
kickboards made the number one of

the most colorful of the show.
Set to the music of "The Brave
Bulls," the red number displayed
precision timing and difficult water
ballet techniques. Before entering
the pool the girls did a short exhibi
tion of modern dancing, using red
capes to carry out the theme of their
number.
The finale, swum by 32 members
of the club, represented a kaleido
scope of colors with the girls dressed
in red, yellow, blue, and green.
Their natural entry into the pool
and their precision swimming in
moving patterns showed the grace
and vitality which characterized the
whole show.
All choreography for the show, as
well as the direction and costuming,
was done by Swim Club members.
Judy Wharton and Janet Hill were
co-chairmen for the event. Marian
Ruch is adviser to the group.
