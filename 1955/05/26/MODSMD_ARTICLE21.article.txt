# Docs, Lawyers In Golf Grudge At Links Today

### DAN E. COHEN 
Continuing their fine old tra
dition of intrigue and abuse, the
lawyers and the medics will be
at each others throats today on
the golf course.
After a heated exchange of let
ters (nobody talks to anybody else),
it was mutually recognized that to
day's match, climaxed by a dinner
and presentation ceremonies at
Chez Yvonne's, would leave for pos
terity an undeniable record of the
physical, social, and spiritual supe
riority of one of the two professions.
Professor John Merryman, captain
of the law school golfers, attributes
last fall's humiliating defeat to the
inequalities of a decadent class sys
tem, reaching out to destroy his
overworked and underpaid charges.
"It is with this sort of social in
justice in mind that we propose to
conduct the match on a handicap
best ball basis. The purpose of the
handicap is to compensate for in
equalities arising from superior
wealth and leisure. ... I can well
understand that you (Med School)
would prefer to play in a match you
could not possibly lose. . . . How
ever, victory gained by the devious
means you propose will be ashes in
your mouth," said Merryman.
Not relying on the power of words
(or handicaps) alone to defeat the
powerful medics, the Law School is
fielding a team composed of newly
appointed professors.
Though the University Directory
fails to reveal any professor named
Sandy Tatum, emergency professor
of law, Merryman assures us that
Tatum's comparative obscurity in
academic circles will be more than
compensated for by his golfing skill.
Aside from the significant social
issues at stake, a cup presented by
Dean Spaeth of the Law School will
be awarded to the winning team.
Discarding his usually disdainful
attitude toward the legal profession,
Dr. G. B. Robson. captain of the Mod
School golf team, refers to the
award in a sweep of magnanimity.
"The donation of the cup by Dean
Spaeth was an act of generosity
unparalleled in our experience.
Never before in the memory of any
of us has a lawyer given something
freely, withoUt stipulation, and
without the posibility of receiving it
back in the foreseeable future. It is
pleasant to think that all of us can
cherish one contact with the legal
profession that has been pleasant
and cost us nothing." says Robson.
