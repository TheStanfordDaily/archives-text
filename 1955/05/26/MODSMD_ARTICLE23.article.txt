To ihe Editor:
The 23rd annual Alumni Conference held on the
Stanford campus last Saturday was an outstanding
.-.uccess. Fart of this success was due to the fine help
and cooperation the Alumni Association received
from Rally Com, John Leland, the ASSU, Rill Too ley,
the Stanford Daily, the Axe Society, and the Palo
Alto Horseless Carriage Club.
We especially wish to thank the Stanford Axe
Sonety whose member, worked throughout the day
providing t.'an portation for the alumni and acting
' guides and hosts. The Axe Society both furnished
the visiting alumni with needed services and gave
them the assurance that the Stanford students are
interested in the alumni which is an asset to the
maintenance of goo;! alumni relations with Stanford.
So, for thee reasons we thank again all those
people who helped us with the conference.
