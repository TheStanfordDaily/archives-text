To the Editor:
"Tho.-e whos personal dignity cannot stomach
;ittling on oiher .should net be forced to do so."
This was the irr.tin j >int of Mr. Olney's letter in
Tuesday's Dailv and, a« 1 his view is held by many
who do not understand Stanford's honor system, I
would like to try to explain it further.
Jn the fir t placo, one must recognize that to hold
: uch a view while attending Stanford is wrong.
Kvery person who enters this university signs a two
fold pledge: 1) that he will neither give nor re
ceivi d unpermitted aid, and 2) that lie will uphold
th« Honor Code by "-'psiting any violations that be
come known to him. These are not just, words. You
would no! have been able to get into Stanford unless
you signed this statement. Dean Winbigler once
made a statement to the effect that the Honor Code
i as much a part of the university as anything else;
and those who are unwilling to accepL it in its en
tirety are unworthy of belonging to the Stanford
oriety. Mr. Glney, as a law student, will surely
recognize that il you refuse to obey the laws of a
[/articular society, that society will seek to exclude
you from it. The same principle does, and must, apply
nt Stanford.
The fact that on: thing exists, however, does not
necessarily make it good. Should the "tattling re
quirement" be eliminated as Mr. Olney suggests?
Should we even have an Honor Code at all at Stan
lord? Mr, t people would agree that some kind of
Honor Code is desirable where the level of th? stu
dent body is as high as it is here. But I further main
tain that any honor system, in order to succeed, must
make prove ion for the occasional case when honor
alone fails 'I !ii■; is the reason lor the third person
twponsiljility clause ~i Stanford.
Ppreonal honoi unfortunately will not stop all
people hom violating the trust that an honor system
pU' es in tin in We face this: problem here as much
«i r . unywhete I'oi Stanford's system of the curved
grade scale give; special advantage to the dishonest
at the evjiense of the holiest. Therefore, for the
protection of the many who do uphold the Honor
rode, we have adopted the third person responsi
bility method ol restraining those who do not. This
is not "ratting ' as in high school, where those who
cheated were acclaimed for putting something over
on the teacher, and those who told were condemned.
This i* a mature attack at a problem which hurts
not the fa< ulty hi>t lather the individual student
directly. Without this practical approach there can
b n no honoi system at Stanford.
Part of our problem at Stanford lies in the lack of
■ i good flonoi Code orientation program, arid it is

easy to understand why Mr. Olney and others feel
as they do. I would like them to propose to Presi
dent Ralph in lieu of Mr. Olney's proposals that a
revamped and truly dynamic orientation program be
presented to the student body next year, giving not
only the laws, but the reason behind the laws.
Because there are reasons; and they are good
reasons; and if people could but know the reasons,
1 think they would accept the laws. Then when
everyone put as much effort toward making the
Honor Code work a th y have toward finding fault
with it, we would have a eood aij honor .system as
anyone could de in M

To the Editor:
In his letter to the editor on Tuesday, Mr. Jay
Olney put forth three suggestions for improving the
Honor Code: "Elimination of ihe 'tattling' require
ment; appointment of defense and prosecution rep
resentatives from students in the law school, and a
stiffer minimum penalty for violator .' These pro
posals are founded on an unclear picture of what
the Honor Code really is; we hope this letter will
help explain the system. In answer to his proposals:
First, "elimination of the tattling requirement."
We have no proctors here so it's up to the students
to maintain the system themselves. It is an unpleas
ant responsibility, granted, but it has to be carried
out by each student. Otherwise, the Honor Code
becomes a farce. I!' the individual student should not
be asked to report a violation, to whom would you
give the responsibility? (This year, there were no
students who reported themselves to the Judicial
Council; approximately 75 per cent of the cases were
reported by students, 25 psr cent by faculty and staff
members).
As a law student, Mr. Olney ought to see that a law
which is enforced only pari of the time and applies
to only part of the people is not worth the paper
it is written on. More important, the prime duty
of the student who witnesses a possible Honor Code
violation is to warn the offender that his behavior
looks suspicious. If this fails, or if there is no op
portunity to warn the person, then he should be
referred to the Judicial Council.
Second—'"Appointment of defense and.prosecution
representatives . . ." Council is not a court of law.
It is an unbiased board of inquiry and wants no
"prosecution" or "defense.'' It attempts to gather all
relevant material on a particular incident, without
aiming either at "conviction" or "acquittal." We
feel that it would make the Honor Code meaningless
if the sessions of Council were turned into a battle
of wits between competing "attorneys."
Council's "technique," described as "complacent"
by Mr. Olney. is one of open-mindedness and un
willingness to jump to conclusions. Mr. Olney would
be surprised at the amount of time and effort spent
in getting pertinent information and testimony for
Honof Code case . Assuming that a person is inno
cent until proven otherwise is not exactly "com
placency," rather the only sensible starting point.
Third, it i • ingested that Ihe minimum penalty
for violations should be suspension for one quarter
"to put some teeth into the Honor Code." Perhaps
this is a good idea, but on the other hand, would it
make the Honor Code more enforceable? Or what is
moie irn| ort.ant, would il decrease the number of vio
lations? Since violations are not uniformly serious
or uniformly premeditated, a wider range of penalties
seems more rational. It seems a better way to "put
teeth into the Honor Code'' would Ie to make it
universally enforced. The only way to do this is to
have every student realize his responsibilities if he
wants his privilege under the Honor Code to con
tinue,
