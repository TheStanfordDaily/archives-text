# I Hear Music ...
## ROGER HAGAN 
### 
There are probably more hi - fi
systems in Toyon, Stern, and En
cina these days than there are in
Beverly Hills. Anyone knows this
who has been caught between the
dorms during a war with "Davy
Crockett" and "Rock Around the
Clock."
This seems to disprove the general
fear that if you have to ask how
much hi-fi would cost you, sir, you
can't afford it. This summer, more
students than ever will probably
start building music systems, so they
j had better start now getting used to
j the palaver of hi-fi salesmen.
Hi-fi means absence of distortion
j (blare, fuzz, wow, hum, or anything
that doesn't sound like music). No
system is distortion-free, but some
are worse than others, depending
on the quality of the needle, pickup,
amplifier, pre-amp. speaker, and
j cabinet.
DIAMOND NEEDLE
The salesman will tell you to start
right ofi with a diamond needle, and
here he is right. All others wear fast
I arid a worn needle ruins records. A?
| for the cartridge, which converts the
needle's wiggles into a tiny electric
! impulse, the magnetic type is the
most popular and accurate for the
money, but some of the new ceramic
| types which many of the commer
cial sets (RCA, Columbia) use are
I good.
The amplifier must have a push
pull circuit (don't laugh, thai cuts
down hum) and ten watts or better,
because loud passages may use the

whole ten or more and would other
wise sound blary and inaccurate.
But when the salesman shows you
a 50-watter, move on unless you've
got a skating rink.
Some amplifiers have pre - amp
(the extra stage necessary for use
with magnetic pickups) and tone
controls in a .separate box. which is
then called a pre-amp. In any com
mercial phonograph, watch for sep
arate bass and treble controls. No
good amp is made with only one
tone control.
SPEAKER SYSTEM
Speakers and their cabinets are
the things most people get taken on.
To reproduce the full audible range
you need (1) a lot of .speaker cone
area to couple low-frequency vi
brations to the air, and (2) a low
mass speaker that can vibrate rap
idly to reproduce highs. The bizarre
ways this problem i.s attacked, at
prices running to over $800, would
be worth another column. Short of
that, I simply submit that anyone
spending much more than $75 on il
is passing the point of diminishing
returns.
In all components, watch for even
(flat, linear) response from about .'!()
to 18,000 cycles per second (cp.s).
Your ear can't hear much more than
that, but it's a real improvement
over AM radio, which goes from
about (i() to G.OOO cps Hat.
One last wor.u: in two years of
asking around, trying out, shopping
and building, 1 haven't fobiKl an
expert yet. Don't trust anybody.'
