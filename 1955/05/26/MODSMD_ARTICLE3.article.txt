# Sign-up Sheets Posted For Men's Glee Club
## 
### 
Sign-up sheets are now up in the Encina lobby and the ASSU
office for those interested in joining the Men's Glee Club next
year.
The glee club will eventually have about 40 members. It is
planning to do a variety of music from the standard men's choral

literature, ranging from spirituals'
and sea songs to classical and sa
cred music.
According to Dave Holton. one of
the student organizers, the club
plans to build up a repertoire that
will be suitable for concerts on and
off campus. A long-range aim is to
develop a concert schedule that will
include an annual tour.
GLEE ACTIVITIES
"Regular glee club activities are
scheduled to start with the begin
ning of school next fall with audi
tions and rehearsals, and concerts
as soon as possible in the year.
"For that reason," Holton said,
"we want to get the names of those
men interested in finding out more
about our plans and in singing with
us. so that we can get in touch with
them at the start of fall quarter.
"We have special need for tenors
with experience. Present plans call
for two meetings pfcr week for re
hearsal under a student director.
The total time needed per week
probably won't exceed three hours."
According to Jim Lerner, the idea

for the glee club was born after
last year's Spring Sing, when some
Encina men and Village frosh start
ed to make plans. Last fall an at
tempt was made to organize and 50
showed up, "which shows there was
great interest," Lerner declared.
"Those who signed up before are
definitely urged to come back
again."
LETTERS
During the last year many letters
have been written to successful glee
clubs in other colleges, and many
ideas have been received from them.
The only other California college to
have a successful men's glee â€¢ club
is Pomona.
The glee club constitution was
prepared early this spring and was
approved by the Legislature May 18.
Lerner explained that "the pur
pose of the glee club isn't just to get
a bunch of guys together to sing
like at Rudy's, but to gather togeth
er some men who enjoy singing be
fore groups and would be willing
to spend time on it."
