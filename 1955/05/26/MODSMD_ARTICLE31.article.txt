WKUKKND SUGGESTION—If yon happen to he in the traveling mood
this weekend and are in que.st of someplace to go, a good suggestion might
be the Newport-Balboa resort area south of Los Angeles. On Saturday, the
hustle and bustle of the world's greatest yacht harbor will ccme to a stand
still, and attention will be focused on the Fifth Annual Intercollegiate

Rowing Regatta to be held on Lido
Channel at Newport Beach.
The Regatta, which has recently
gained a chunk of prominence in
the national crew picture, will fea
ture a top-flight nine race program
that will be highlighted by the
Western. Sprint. Championship.
Among the entries in the race are
Navy, Washington, British Colum
bia, Stanford, and California. The
Navy eight will be defending their
championship which they won last
year in an easy victory. This year's
competition should be much closed
as the Middies are not quite as
strong, while the Huskies and the
Indians are considerably better. The
Canadians swept the British Empire
Gaines' chamuionships last summer
a factor that can certainly not be
discounted.
Besides the 2000-meter eight oared
sprints, the festivities will include
races by fours, singles, and —to add
a humorous touch to things — a

comedy relief act by the Balboa Island Sculling and Punting Club entitled,
"Crew Capers ol' 1955." According to Regatta officials, ample spectator
viewing facilities will be available to the fans. Grandstands will be set
up, and boat anchorages ready to accommodate the shipboard enthusiasts.
The Regatta itself will be well worth the trip—but for those who should
yet bored with the crew events, plenty of sand, surf, and sea are within
a clone's throw.
BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS—As the Newport Regetta is still in
its infancy, the committee is delving way into the future and is beginning
to formulate plans that may make the annual affair a much-acclaimed
■ports event. In fact, this reporter wouldn't be a bit surprised if their
long-range plans included the national intercollegiate championships—
now held at Syracuse each summer—to be a part of the Regatta. Already
lor next year, several big eastern eights have indicatd their intrest in com
ing to Newport. Among them are Princeton, Cornell, and Pennsylvania,
the latter being the crew which snapped Navy's string of 31 straight vic
tories recently.
A JOB WELL DONE—This corner feels that many congratulations are
in older for this year's new coach of the sweepswingers. Lou Lindsey, a
former California coxswain, took over the coaching reigns of the Indian
views in the fall and ever since, has been a leading contributor to the
.• port. Lou put in much time advising and helping with the new boathouse,
which was built entirely through the efforts of the crew members them
selves. Besides that, he has turned out what may turn out to be a lead
ing contender for the national eight-oared collegiate championship.
Incidentally, the new boathouse will be dedicated on June 4 in a cere
mony before the Cal race. The Stanford Crew Association will be putting
on quite a show themselves that clay. Besides the dedication and the
varsity, JV, and Freshman competitions, a complete between race program,
including rowing exhibitions and swimming races, has been scheduled.
Plenty of spectator and parking facilities are available, and the boathouse
i; located in Redwood City—a fifteen-minutes drive from campus. The
main feature of the afternoon will be the varsity race in which the Indians
will have a good chance to beat the Berkeley oarsmen—a trick that hasn't
been turned in a long time. It should be an interesting afternoon.
