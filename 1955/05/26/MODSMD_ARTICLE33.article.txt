# Swimming Coach Haynie Has Year-Long Schedule
## 
### JIM BAKER 
Other coaches may work only during a short season, but for Tom Haynie, Director of Swimming,
frosh and varsity water polo coach and frosh and varsity swimming coach, the season lasts all year.
Haynie came to Stanford in 1946 as assistant to Ernst Brandsten, who previously had been the
only coach in the history of Indian swimming, H? took over as head mentor in 1948 and ever since
then, the Card mermen have been regarded as the power of the Pacific Coast.
Haynie starts off the year by getting his water polo teams in shape. This year's team started off

| well, but ended up with a 5-5 won- j
lost record. In 1953, the Cards swept
j all opposition in their winning bid j
for the crown.
i |
After water polo season, Haynie i
begins work on his swimming teams. !
This year's team lost only one
dual meet—to the Pan American
Service team, a star-studded group. \
In that meet, the service team set |
one world record. By losing, the j
j Cards broke their winning streak of
I 35 victorious dual meets, but are
j still undefeated in collegiate dual i
I meet competition.
With the close of competition this
j year. Haynie's teams have to their
I credit 42 wins out of 43 dual meets, !
20 straight victories against the Cal
| swimmers, and six consecutive Pa
j cific Coast Conference champion
j ships.
This year's Hayniemen hold rec
ords in the 220- and 440-yard free
style events, the 1,500-meter dis
tance swim, the 150-yard individual
medley, the 220- and 100-yard back
stroke, and the 400-yard freestyle
and 300-yard medley relay events.
The varsity swimmers didn't do as
well as expected in the NCAA finals,
taking tenth place, but received two
thirds and two sixths.
From his fine record, Haynie, who
| has been a member of the Olympic
Committee for eight years, was cho
i sen as the coach for the U.S. swim
j ming team in the Pan American
■ Games, held this winter in Mexico
City. Haynie supervised the try
i outs, then tutored the 18 swimmers
arid divers entered in the games.
The balding, genial mentor should
| have no trouble in building another
I winning team next year with this
year's returnees and Robin Moore
I as a nucleus.

j still undefeated in collegiate dual i
I meet competition.
With the close of competition this
j year. Haynie's teams have to their
I credit 42 wins out of 43 dual meets, !
20 straight victories against the Cal
| swimmers, and six consecutive Pa
j cific Coast Conference champion
j ships.
This year's Hayniemen hold rec
ords in the 220- and 440-yard free
style events, the 1,500-meter dis
tance swim, the 150-yard individual
medley, the 220- and 100-yard back
stroke, and the 400-yard freestyle
and 300-yard medley relay events.
The varsity swimmers didn't do as
well as expected in the NCAA finals,
taking tenth place, but received two
thirds and two sixths.
From his fine record, Haynie, who
| has been a member of the Olympic
Committee for eight years, was cho
i sen as the coach for the U.S. swim
j ming team in the Pan American
■ Games, held this winter in Mexico
City. Haynie supervised the try
i outs, then tutored the 18 swimmers
arid divers entered in the games.
The balding, genial mentor should
| have no trouble in building another
I winning team next year with this
year's returnees and Robin Moore
I as a nucleus.

Other coaches may work only during a short season, but for Tom Haynie, Director of Swimming,
frosh and varsity water polo coach and frosh and varsity swimming coach, the season lasts all year.
Haynie came to Stanford in 1946 as assistant to Ernst Brandsten, who previously had been the
only coach in the history of Indian swimming, H? took over as head mentor in 1948 and ever since
then, the Card mermen have been regarded as the power of the Pacific Coast.
Haynie starts off the year by getting his water polo teams in shape. This year's team started off

| well, but ended up with a 5-5 won- j
lost record. In 1953, the Cards swept
j all opposition in their winning bid j
for the crown.
