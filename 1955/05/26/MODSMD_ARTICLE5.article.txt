# Ike's Highway Plan Rejected by Senate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Senate
handed President Eisenhower a
sharp legislative jolt tonight by re
jecting his $101,000,000,000 highway
program and then approving a Dem
ocratic substitute.
The Senate action still left some
chance, however, that the House
would salvage part of the Presi
dent's program. Many members of
the House Public Works Committee
lean more strongly toward Mr. Ei
senhower's plan than the Senate
Democratic version.
The Senate, with Democratic
forces firmly in control, passed a
five-year $18,000,000,000 roads plan
sponsored by Senator Albert M.
Gore (D., Tenn.).
