# Britain Retains Tory Majority
## Labor Secretary Morgan Phillips Concedes Defeat 
### 
LONDON, Friday, May 27—
(UP) — British voters have re
tained Prime Minister Anthony
Eden's Conservative party in
power, assuring continued close
cooperation with the United
States, returns from more than
half of Britain's 630 constituen
cies showed today.
Labor Party Secretary Morgan
Phillips conceded defeat.
When the vote-counting from
Thursday's general election was
suspended at 3:40 a.m. today (7:40
p.m. PDT) the Conservatives had
picked up a net gain of 11 seats
formerly held by the opposition.
The early morning count covered
357 constituencies, including the big
city vote which traditionally goes
strongly for labor.
POPULAR VOTE
But the trend changed this year
and the Laborites were able to pick
up only 179 seats compared with the
Conservatives 176. To win over the
strongly Conservative out-country
vote which is to come in later today,
the Laborites needed at this point a
lead of more than 30 seats.
In the popular vote, the Conserva
tives had 7,409,339 to the Laborites'
7,165.308.
The waning Liberal party won two
seats and the Communists none.
"It is now clear from the total
votes cast that we shall not reach the
poll of 14.000,000 which I regard as
essential for our victory," Phillips
said.
WON'T COMMENT
Former Laborite Prime Minister
Clement Attlee, who won his own
Commons seat but with a reduced
majority, shouldered his way through
the waiting newsmen at Labor party
headquarters and declined to com
ment on the results.
Eden himself was elected easily,
as was his predecessor, the 80-year
old Sir Winston Churchill.
