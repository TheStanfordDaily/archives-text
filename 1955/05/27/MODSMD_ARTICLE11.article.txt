# Igor Stravinsky's Music Sparks Production of 'The Rake's Progress'
## Rounseville Sings Lead Role With 'Verve, Mastery' 
### TERRY COMITO 
The star of the Stanford Play
ers-Music Department produc
tion of Stravinsky's "The Rake's
Progress" is without a doubt Mr.
Igor Stravinsky.
After much loose talk about the
"sterility" of his late music, one is
impressed most of all by the
"Rake's" variety and genuine life.
There are antique flourishes, Mo
zartian ensembles, tipsy marches,
and a florid, funny parody of the
Italian style for Baba, the bearded
Turk. Stravinsky ranges from the
genuinely lyrical, as in Anne's first
act love song, to the starkly expres
sionistic, as in the jagged, exciting
graveyard scene.
Musically, this whole terrain is
pretty well covered. Robert Roun
seville sings Tom with verve and an
at least semi-projected sort of in
tensity. It is a trying role, and
Rounseville's mastery is apparent.
Ruth Roehr, despite a tendency to
be shrill, manages the part of Anne
with considerable tenderness and
charm. Francis Barnes is compe
tent as Nick Shadow, though not
without a sense of strain, and San
dor Salgo's orchestra does a thor
oughly professional job.
Dramatically, the show is more
uneven. Wendell Cole's ingenious
and sometimes brilliant sets give the
rather disjointed scenes a remark
able sense of flow and continuity,
and director F. Cowles Strickland
handles the crowd scenes gracefully,
often excitingly.
But the fact remains that most
good singers are just not very good
actors. Even Rounseville, who gen
erally is effective, sometimes seems
forced and unagile. And for all the
cast, the operatic cliches seem hard
to part with.
If the current production falls
short of the opera's finished ele
gance, it comes close enough to let
Stravinsky speak for himself. This
is really what matters and this is in
itself a notable accomplishment.
The opera will play in Memorial
Auditorium tonight and tomorrow
at 8:15.
