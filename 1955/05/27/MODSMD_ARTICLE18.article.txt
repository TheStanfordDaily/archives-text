# Indian Crew to Race Top Shells at Newport
## Navy, Washington Also to Compete At Fifth Animal Collegiate Regatta 
### JIM PIGOTT 
Coach Lou Lindsey's two top boatloads of oarsmen embark to
j day for Newport Harbor where they will row against Ihe coun
, try's top shells Saturday in the Fifth Annual Intercollegiate Row
-1 ing Regatta.
The races, over the 2,000-meter North Lido Channel coursc,

will be a big factor in determining
the strength of the plucky Indian
shell which, so far this season, has
crushed all opposition in its first
four races.
The Indians will definitely be
rowing in the big leagues tomorrow
when they take on the likes of Navy,
Washington, California, and the
University of British Columbia in
a race that could well be an accurate
preview of the. National Champion
ships which will be held on June 18
at Lake Onandaga, New York.
FULL STRENGTH
The Stanford varsity boat will be
at full strength tomorrow, according
to Coach Lindsey. Dan Ayrault, co
captain and stroke in the Indians'
early season victories over Oregon
State and USC, will be back in the
first boat after a spell in the hospital
which resulted in his missing the
second USC race.
Ayrault was back in action last
Saturday for the first time since he
came out of the hospital and rowed
a strong race from the number 7
position. Lindsey said he expects to
keep Ayrault at 7 in an effort to
bolster the starboard side. Thi
means that Gordie Best, who stroked
last Saturday's win, will take over
that oar for the rest of the season.
JUNIOR VARSITY
The junior varsity eight, which
left yesterday by car, will also row
in the nine-race program that will
include everything from four-oared
races to a comedy l-elief event which
features the Balboa Island Sculling
and Punting Club in the "Crew Ca
pers of 1955."
The JV's will be pitted against
junior varsity shells from ÜBC,
OSC, and UCLA. The Indian sec
onds have come a long way since
their early season loss to Oregon
State, and Lindsey expects them to
avenge that loss with a victory in
tomorrow's four-way contest.
The order of the day in the var
sity races will be to stage two pre
liminary contests to determine four
finalists. These boats will then fight
it out for the day's championship
in the featured 2.000 - meter race.
The draw for positions in the pre
liminary heats pitted Stanford
against Washington. ÜBC, and USC
and California against Navy, UCLA,
and OSC. The latter four boats wili
have the advantage of rowing first

find thus having a longer interval
biTqre the championship contest and
their heat.
Jl' both Stanford and Cal get into
Ihe finals as expected, it would be
the first of three meetings between
the two rivals. Next week, the
Bears come down from Berkeley to
lace the Indians in a three-mile dual
meet on the Redwood City Harbor.
