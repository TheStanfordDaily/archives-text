## Cal Debater Wins Annual Joffre Medal 
### JIM PALMER 
Advocating & sweeping re
form in France's constitutional
structure, Stanford Lyman of the
University of California won the
"Medaille Joffre" Wednesday
night in verbal competition with
five other debaters in Cubber
ley Auditorium.
The 61st round of the annual
Stanford-Cal Joffre contest was
clinched by the stocky senior from
Berkeley on the negative side of the
topic "Resolved: that France should
return to the constitutional system
of the Third Republic.
'"France needs major change," Ly
man declared, '"but not a return to
the Third Republic . . . The parties
should be coerced to get together,
and the people should be forced to
elect a Premier of France."
U.S. SYSTEM
His contention for a system "like
the United States has" in addition
to a brilliant rebuttal speech, earned
Lyman the coveted Joffre medal
which was minted in France, ship
ped to the United States in time for
the debate, and awarded by the
sponsoring Alliance Francaise or
ganization of San Francisco.
Keith Jewell, a Cal junior, nabbed
second place speaking on the affirm
ative side and contending "the
French government of the Fourth
Republic does not accomplish the
basic purposes that any government
.should accomplish."
DEBATED BEFORE
Both Lyman and Jewell have par
ticipated in previous Joffre debates,
the former placing second and the
latter third in last year's competi
tion.
Stanford's Arliss Barnes won a
convincing third with' the negative
stand that "France should not go
back, but should progress ... to go
back would be a return to less effi
ciency and greater instability."
Other Stanford participants were
Michael C. Hudson and Leon Jon
Ardzrooni, while the third Cal man
was Thomas Shephard.
HUDSON'S CASE
Hudson based his negative case
on the fact that under the Third Re
public Constitution, a Senate would
be in the position to overturn gov
ernment and would cause failure.
Ardzrooni, an affirmative speaker,
charged the Fourth Republic was a
"mambo of ministries." (Jewell re
torted that the mambo was "nothing
more than the old French game of
musical chairs.")
Shephard claimed. "France does
not need a complete reversal to an
other form of republic ... it does
need political reform, but this re
form mast not come, suddenly."

ative side and contending "the
French government of the Fourth
Republic does not accomplish the
basic purposes that any government
.should accomplish."
DEBATED BEFORE
Both Lyman and Jewell have par
ticipated in previous Joffre debates,
the former placing second and the
latter third in last year's competi
tion.
Stanford's Arliss Barnes won a
convincing third with' the negative
stand that "France should not go
back, but should progress ... to go
back would be a return to less effi
ciency and greater instability."
Other Stanford participants were
Michael C. Hudson and Leon Jon
Ardzrooni, while the third Cal man
was Thomas Shephard.
HUDSON'S CASE
Hudson based his negative case
on the fact that under the Third Re
public Constitution, a Senate would
be in the position to overturn gov
ernment and would cause failure.
Ardzrooni, an affirmative speaker,
charged the Fourth Republic was a
"mambo of ministries." (Jewell re
torted that the mambo was "nothing
more than the old French game of
musical chairs.")
Shephard claimed. "France does
not need a complete reversal to an
other form of republic ... it does
need political reform, but this re
form mast not come, suddenly."
Advocating & sweeping re
form in France's constitutional
structure, Stanford Lyman of the
University of California won the
"Medaille Joffre" Wednesday
night in verbal competition with
five other debaters in Cubber
ley Auditorium.
The 61st round of the annual
Stanford-Cal Joffre contest was
clinched by the stocky senior from
Berkeley on the negative side of the
topic "Resolved: that France should
return to the constitutional system
of the Third Republic.
'"France needs major change," Ly
man declared, '"but not a return to
the Third Republic . . . The parties
should be coerced to get together,
and the people should be forced to
elect a Premier of France."
U.S. SYSTEM
His contention for a system "like
the United States has" in addition
to a brilliant rebuttal speech, earned
Lyman the coveted Joffre medal
which was minted in France, ship
ped to the United States in time for
the debate, and awarded by the
sponsoring Alliance Francaise or
ganization of San Francisco.
Keith Jewell, a Cal junior, nabbed
second place speaking on the affirm
ative side and contending "the
French government of the Fourth
Republic does not accomplish the
basic purposes that any government
.should accomplish."
