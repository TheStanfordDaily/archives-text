A wailing three - minute blast of a siren
screams over the campus. An air raid is com
ing. What would you do? Or, even, do you
know what the warning blast signifies?
Last week The Daily printed an explanation
of Air Raid Instructions. The instructions stated
that such a signal means a "red alert," that an
air attack is imminent. And the campus is cov
ered with posters also publicizing such instruc
tions.
In case of this signal University Fire Chief
John Marston warned that when students hear
this they should "run for cover."
But the pertinent question here is, have stu
dents become aware of what the signal means,
and of what to do when they hear it? In short,
are we prepared for an air raid if it should
come to Stanford?
On surveying the campus we've come up
with some interesting answers to these que
ries, as to what the three-minute wailing blast
means and as to what the student who hears it
will do:
"It's an air raid. I'd panic, just stand there."
. . Wouldn't know what to do. I wouldn't
realize the extent of the danger."
"... A civil defense emergency. I'd hide
under my bunk."
. . I'd go to shelter if one were near."
". . . I'd go to the little poster to find out what
it means. If there were no sign, I'd walk around
wringing my hands. On general principles I'd
go to a basement. I'd probably panic."
". . . I'd go to the nearest shelter, but I don't
know where that is."
"I'd probably go homo."
"I'd go for shelter, or drop on the floor."
"If I were in class I'd wait for my French in

structor to say 'vite, vite.' If I were at home
I'd climb under the desk."
"It means a trial air-raid test. I would do
nothing, since I wouldn't know if it were an air
raid siren or the lunch horn. And anyway it
would be just another test interfering with my
studies." ,
"It's an all-clear, so I wouldn't do anything."
"I don't know what it's supposed to mean,
but it would be just a practice drill anyway. I
would curse five minutes for being disturbed
and go back to my books."
"It means a red alert. I'd drop to the ground."
"My understanding is that this is an air raid
signal. I would seek some nearby under
ground shelter if possible; if not then I'd cower
in a ditch till someone came to rescue me."
"It means a yellow alert, an air raid. I per
sonally would go to the firehouse since I'm a
student fireman. If I were not, I'd bury my
face in my hands."
"I don't know what it means, but I think it'd
be an air raid warning. I'd stay right where I
was—l believe in predestined death."
"I'd turn on the radio and try to get a Conel
rad station (the only stations broadcasting dur
ing an air raid) to see what the situation was,
and then I'd go to the nearest basement."
"It probably means an atomic bomb. I'd grab
a white sheet and dive under the nearest table
or into a doorway, get as flat as possible, and
bury my face in rny arms, and lie prostrate until
three minutes after the blast, or until the all
clear."
In the case of today's column what you think
isn't important. It's what you know that may
mean the difference between life and death in
case of an air raid.

but it would be just a practice drill anyway. I
would curse five minutes for being disturbed
and go back to my books."

"My understanding is that this is an air raid
signal. I would seek some nearby under
ground shelter if possible; if not then I'd cower
in a ditch till someone came to rescue me."
"It means a yellow alert, an air raid. I per
sonally would go to the firehouse since I'm a
student fireman. If I were not, I'd bury my
face in my hands."
"I don't know what it means, but I think it'd
be an air raid warning. I'd stay right where I
was—l believe in predestined death."
"I'd turn on the radio and try to get a Conel
rad station (the only stations broadcasting dur
ing an air raid) to see what the situation was,
and then I'd go to the nearest basement."

a white sheet and dive under the nearest table

three minutes after the blast, or until the all
clear."

NEW FIRE SIREN: WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF IT SOUNDED?
A wailing three - minute blast of a siren
screams over the campus. An air raid is com
ing. What would you do? Or, even, do you
know what the warning blast signifies?
Last week The Daily printed an explanation
of Air Raid Instructions. The instructions stated
that such a signal means a "red alert," that an
air attack is imminent. And the campus is cov
ered with posters also publicizing such instruc
tions.
In case of this signal University Fire Chief
John Marston warned that when students hear
this they should "run for cover."
But the pertinent question here is, have stu
dents become aware of what the signal means,
and of what to do when they hear it? In short,
are we prepared for an air raid if it should
come to Stanford?
On surveying the campus we've come up
with some interesting answers to these que
ries, as to what the three-minute wailing blast
means and as to what the student who hears it
will do:
"It's an air raid. I'd panic, just stand there."
. . Wouldn't know what to do. I wouldn't
realize the extent of the danger."
"... A civil defense emergency. I'd hide
under my bunk."
. . I'd go to shelter if one were near."
". . . I'd go to the little poster to find out what
it means. If there were no sign, I'd walk around
wringing my hands. On general principles I'd
go to a basement. I'd probably panic."
". . . I'd go to the nearest shelter, but I don't
know where that is."
"I'd probably go homo."
"I'd go for shelter, or drop on the floor."
"If I were in class I'd wait for my French in

structor to say 'vite, vite.' If I were at home
I'd climb under the desk."
"It means a trial air-raid test. I would do
nothing, since I wouldn't know if it were an air
raid siren or the lunch horn. And anyway it
would be just another test interfering with my
studies." ,
"It's an all-clear, so I wouldn't do anything."
