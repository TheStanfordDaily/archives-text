## faculty and commencement 
### 
To the Editor: '
Willi Senior Week rapidly hearing down upon us,
perhaps you will ;dlow me space in your columns for
an appeal to my faculty colleagues who absent them
selves from the Commencement exercises. I venture
to speak on behalf of the graduating seniors. These
always discover too late for effective protest how
meagre is the faculty turn-out at Commencement.
It is not the length of the academic procession which
each year becomes th:> subject of disappointed com
ments from the seniors present. It is rather the ab
sence of individual professors for whom the students
look. Sometimes, indeed, a department will not be
represented at all. For many students such absences
deprive the occasion of some of its lustre.
This appeal is not directed, however, to any one
who cannot -afford the cost of academic dress or who
must find the annual rental of $8 a prohibitive price
lo pay for discharging what they would otherwise
regard as a duty. It is rather to thi- others, those who
have their rrbes or, not having them, can afford the

rental but nevertheless do not appear at Commence
ment. Is it too much to ask of these the further in
vestment of two hours on a Sunday afternoon in June?
Or if one must argue self-interest, even though in
direct, what, it may be asked, is the impression car
ried away from the exercises by an uninformed pub
lic which thinks it has just seen the Stanford faculty
in procession? Is it men or buildings that make a
university? If it is men, then "lor fifty summers"
(to quote a colleague), the riches of Stanford have
been poorly displayed for the visitors at Commence
ment.
Every one will concede, I presume, that the June
ceremonies in the Frost Amphitheatre are an im
portant part of the academic year. It may be an old,
if regrettable, Stanford custom that they have poor
faculty support. But perhaps this custom will follow
into oblivion other time-honored traditions if it is
more widely understood among the faculty members
that their absence from Commencement does make a
difference to their students.
