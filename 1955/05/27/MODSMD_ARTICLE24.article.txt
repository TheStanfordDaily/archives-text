# NEXT FALL'S PRODUCTION
## Director of Big Game Gaieties Faces Headache, Work, Worry' Lowry Seeks Ideas, Material for Annual Ram's Head Offering 
### JAE HUNLEY 
For most Stanford students,
Gaieties is a prelude to Big
Game and Big Game is the cli
max to the fall football season.
But for Bruce Lowry, who will
direct next fall's Gaieties, it is
nothing but headaches, work,
and worry —right now.
According to Lowry, the first
problem is beginning, getting the
fir.'t things first, and keeping every
thing thereafter in a logical order.
"You need a theme or an idea," he
said, "and then, you need material
to go along with that idea, and by
material, I mean music, lyrics, and
sketches. When you have those, you
have the form <5T your show and you
can proceed with orchestrating the
music and designing the sets and
costumes.
QUICK MATERIAL
"If you don't get your material
quickly, it means that your sets and
costumes will be less expertly de
signed. Your music will be less ex
pertly orchestrated and the show
will not be as good as it might have
been."
"Right now," Lowry stated, "I
have tons of material, but much of
it is not developed. It doesn't go
anywhere, and it needs rewriting.
Some of it may go onstage exactly
as it is now. Some of it will need to
be redone before it can go onstage,
and some of it will never appear.
HAS PLETHORA
"I have a plethora of music about
young ladies who are unhappy in
their romantic relationships and
about young gentlemen who are
equally distressed. I have a plethora
of sketches endeavoring to demon
strate a fact obvious on the surface—

certain art forms are ridiculous.
"People seem to want to kid eso
teric art forms more than anything
else. They also want to use local
jokes that mean nothing to new
freshmen or alumni coming back
for a visit. I don't want local jolces
in the 1955 Gaieties."
"In short." he said. "I have a pau
city of good show material—mate

ria 1 that is developed tmd will hold
a show together.
"I don't think i am hard to please.
I'll accept risque material if it is
clever. I'll accept naive material il
it is clever. Anything will do as long
as it is clever and will appeal to an
audience.
"Right now, 1 need writers and
that doesn't mean I want just people
who are majoring in speech and
drama. I think that the writer? ol
this show .'hould be from ivery de
partment of this University.
"Rani'.-: Head is offering abnit $251>
to be divided, according to the
amount of show-time the material
takes, among the writer: ol' mate
rial used in the 1H55 Gaieties. The
only requirement is that il be in
my hands in some written form by
June 19. Ihc writer; can revise an'J
improve it over the summer."
NEEDS MUSIC
"Despite this offer, however,"
Lowry pointed out, "1 still need all
kinds of music, sketches, and lyrics
—especially lyrics—and if 1 can't get
it at Stanford, I'll have to go else
where or write it myself. I'll do al
most; anything to get a good show.
"I don't see why the people who
complain about Gaieties being so
poor don't do something about it.
I know there are people here who
can write."

"You need a theme or an idea," he
said, "and then, you need material
to go along with that idea, and by
material, I mean music, lyrics, and
sketches. When you have those, you
have the form <5T your show and you
can proceed with orchestrating the
music and designing the sets and
costumes.
QUICK MATERIAL
"If you don't get your material
quickly, it means that your sets and
costumes will be less expertly de
signed. Your music will be less ex
pertly orchestrated and the show
will not be as good as it might have
been."
"Right now," Lowry stated, "I
have tons of material, but much of
it is not developed. It doesn't go
anywhere, and it needs rewriting.
Some of it may go onstage exactly
as it is now. Some of it will need to
be redone before it can go onstage,
and some of it will never appear.
HAS PLETHORA
"I have a plethora of music about
young ladies who are unhappy in
their romantic relationships and
about young gentlemen who are
equally distressed. I have a plethora
of sketches endeavoring to demon
strate a fact obvious on the surface—

certain art forms are ridiculous.
"People seem to want to kid eso
teric art forms more than anything
else. They also want to use local
jokes that mean nothing to new
freshmen or alumni coming back
for a visit. I don't want local jolces
in the 1955 Gaieties."
"In short." he said. "I have a pau
city of good show material—mate

ria 1 that is developed tmd will hold
a show together.
"I don't think i am hard to please.
I'll accept risque material if it is
clever. I'll accept naive material il
it is clever. Anything will do as long
as it is clever and will appeal to an
audience.
"Right now, 1 need writers and
that doesn't mean I want just people
who are majoring in speech and
drama. I think that the writer? ol
this show .'hould be from ivery de
partment of this University.
"Rani'.-: Head is offering abnit $251>
to be divided, according to the
amount of show-time the material
takes, among the writer: ol' mate
rial used in the 1H55 Gaieties. The
only requirement is that il be in
my hands in some written form by
June 19. Ihc writer; can revise an'J
improve it over the summer."
NEEDS MUSIC
"Despite this offer, however,"
Lowry pointed out, "1 still need all
kinds of music, sketches, and lyrics
—especially lyrics—and if 1 can't get
it at Stanford, I'll have to go else
where or write it myself. I'll do al
most; anything to get a good show.
"I don't see why the people who
complain about Gaieties being so
poor don't do something about it.
I know there are people here who
can write."


BRUCE LOWRY
For most Stanford students,
Gaieties is a prelude to Big
Game and Big Game is the cli
max to the fall football season.
But for Bruce Lowry, who will
direct next fall's Gaieties, it is
nothing but headaches, work,
and worry —right now.
According to Lowry, the first
problem is beginning, getting the
fir.'t things first, and keeping every
thing thereafter in a logical order.
