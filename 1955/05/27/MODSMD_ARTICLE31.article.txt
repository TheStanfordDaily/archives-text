# Trackmen Challenge PCC's Best
## USC, Is Favored In Oregon Meet 
### BOB DURAND 
Track coach Jack Weiershau
ser will lead a hopeful bunch sf
Indian warriors into action this
afternoon at Hayward Field in
Eugene, Oregon, when the Pa
cific Coact Conference Track
and Field Champ'onships get
under way at 3:30.
Once again the Card cindermen
will be up against their perennial
fee, the powerful Trojans of USC,
who will be rated top-heavy favor
ites to sweep the 25th annual meet.
The men of Troy have not been
beaten in the championships since
1928.
In the last 14 times that they have
dominated the meet, the Southern
Californians have recorded 95 indi
vidual championships and have
eight of the 15 meet records to their
credit.
Aside from SC's expected victory,
the big battle of the weekend ap
peal's to be between Stanford and
UCLA, which will fight it out for
second place. On the basis of best
times, the two schools seem to be a
toss-up.
FIRST PLACES
Barring some unexpected per
formance, all the first places should
be taken by the Cards and the Tro
jans. Only in the mile relay does
another team have the edge, as the
Bruins boast a quartet with a clock
ing two seconds better than their
cross-town rivals.
However, the Uclans will be able
to build up their point totals by
amassing second and third places
behind the Tribe and Troy.
Every competition in the track
events figures to be close on paper.
Even the mile and two-mile could
turn into thrilling finishes—a situa
tion unusual in this type of meet.
In the two sprint races, the In
dians' Keith Brownsberger and Jim
Saras will be giving their all to
break the tape ahead of USC's
speedy duo of Pat Coyle and How
ard Bugbee, Washington State's Bob
Gary, and Oregon's Bruce Spring
bett.
EXCITING RACE
In the 440-yard dash, the Tribe's
Walt Garrett will be attempting to
overcome the challenge of Troy
thinclad Mike Larrabee and Bruin
Russ Ellis in what should be one of
the top races for excitement.
The faur-lap event will be a close
contest between UCLA's Seaman
(4:10.8) and Bob Hunt (4:10.7),
USC's Sid Wing (4:09.5) and Marty
Montgomery (4:10.8), and Oregon's
Bill Dellinger (4:12.2).
A three-man race is developing in
the two-mile run with Troyman
Fenando Ledesma (9:09.5), Duck
Ken Reiser (9:11.3), and Hunt
(9:12.5) providing the competition.
CARD HURDLE WINS
The Cards should take a first in
each of the two hurdles events.
Sophomore Bernie Nelson will have
the toughest time winning in the
high sticks as he meets fleet Jim
Ball of UCLA. In the low hurdles,
Jim Luttrell will be favored over
SC's Leon Clarke.
In the field events, Ernie Shelton
will lead the powerful Trojans
again when he will make his ump
teenth attempt to pass the mythical
seven-foot mark in the high jump.
Shelton's teammates, Ron Morris
and Walt Levack, will be co-favored
in the pole vault and might even
reach the 15-foot standard. Shot
putter Ray Martin should give the
Figueroa Streeters another win, al
though the Bruins' Don Vick may •
push him.
Another USC victory is expected
in the discus where Des Koch will

be twirling the plate. However, Vick
will be right on his trail as his best
heave is only eight inches behind
Koch's.
Coach Weiershauser's forces
should earn firsts in two field events
—the javelin and broad jump. Bob
Kimball, John Bugge, and Hank
Roldan will be throwing the spear,
while Frank Herrmann will be aim
ing to better his 24-1 leap.

SEVEN FEET?—Ernie Shelton, the USC high jumper who jumps with one shoe on and one shoe
off, will make another try for the mythical seven-foot mark at the PCC meet in Eugene, Oregon,
this weekend. His best jump this year has been six feet ten inches, while last spring he leaped
6-1 IVi, which was just a fraction off the world's mark.

FIRST PLACES
Barring some unexpected per
formance, all the first places should
be taken by the Cards and the Tro
jans. Only in the mile relay does
another team have the edge, as the
Bruins boast a quartet with a clock
ing two seconds better than their
cross-town rivals.
However, the Uclans will be able
to build up their point totals by
amassing second and third places
behind the Tribe and Troy.
Every competition in the track
events figures to be close on paper.
Even the mile and two-mile could
turn into thrilling finishes—a situa
tion unusual in this type of meet.
In the two sprint races, the In
dians' Keith Brownsberger and Jim
Saras will be giving their all to
break the tape ahead of USC's
speedy duo of Pat Coyle and How
ard Bugbee, Washington State's Bob
Gary, and Oregon's Bruce Spring
bett.
EXCITING RACE
In the 440-yard dash, the Tribe's
Walt Garrett will be attempting to
overcome the challenge of Troy
thinclad Mike Larrabee and Bruin
Russ Ellis in what should be one of
the top races for excitement.
The faur-lap event will be a close
contest between UCLA's Seaman
(4:10.8) and Bob Hunt (4:10.7),
USC's Sid Wing (4:09.5) and Marty
Montgomery (4:10.8), and Oregon's
Bill Dellinger (4:12.2).
A three-man race is developing in
the two-mile run with Troyman
Fenando Ledesma (9:09.5), Duck
Ken Reiser (9:11.3), and Hunt
(9:12.5) providing the competition.
CARD HURDLE WINS
The Cards should take a first in
each of the two hurdles events.
Sophomore Bernie Nelson will have
the toughest time winning in the
high sticks as he meets fleet Jim
Ball of UCLA. In the low hurdles,
Jim Luttrell will be favored over
SC's Leon Clarke.
In the field events, Ernie Shelton
will lead the powerful Trojans
again when he will make his ump
teenth attempt to pass the mythical
seven-foot mark in the high jump.
Shelton's teammates, Ron Morris
and Walt Levack, will be co-favored
in the pole vault and might even
reach the 15-foot standard. Shot
putter Ray Martin should give the
Figueroa Streeters another win, al
though the Bruins' Don Vick may •
push him.
Another USC victory is expected
in the discus where Des Koch will

be twirling the plate. However, Vick
will be right on his trail as his best
heave is only eight inches behind
Koch's.
Coach Weiershauser's forces
should earn firsts in two field events
—the javelin and broad jump. Bob
Kimball, John Bugge, and Hank
Roldan will be throwing the spear,
while Frank Herrmann will be aim
ing to better his 24-1 leap.

SEVEN FEET?—Ernie Shelton, the USC high jumper who jumps with one shoe on and one shoe
off, will make another try for the mythical seven-foot mark at the PCC meet in Eugene, Oregon,
this weekend. His best jump this year has been six feet ten inches, while last spring he leaped
6-1 IVi, which was just a fraction off the world's mark.
Track coach Jack Weiershau
ser will lead a hopeful bunch sf
Indian warriors into action this
afternoon at Hayward Field in
Eugene, Oregon, when the Pa
cific Coact Conference Track

The men of Troy have not been

In the last 14 times that they have

eight of the 15 meet records to their

Aside from SC's expected victory,
the big battle of the weekend ap

toss-up.

Russ Ellis in what should be one of
the top races for excitement.
The faur-lap event will be a close
contest between UCLA's Seaman
(4:10.8) and Bob Hunt (4:10.7),
USC's Sid Wing (4:09.5) and Marty
Montgomery (4:10.8), and Oregon's
Bill Dellinger (4:12.2).
A three-man race is developing in
the two-mile run with Troyman
Fenando Ledesma (9:09.5), Duck
Ken Reiser (9:11.3), and Hunt
(9:12.5) providing the competition.
CARD HURDLE WINS
The Cards should take a first in
each of the two hurdles events.
Sophomore Bernie Nelson will have
the toughest time winning in the
high sticks as he meets fleet Jim
Ball of UCLA. In the low hurdles,
Jim Luttrell will be favored over
SC's Leon Clarke.
In the field events, Ernie Shelton
will lead the powerful Trojans
again when he will make his ump
teenth attempt to pass the mythical
seven-foot mark in the high jump.
Shelton's teammates, Ron Morris
and Walt Levack, will be co-favored
in the pole vault and might even
reach the 15-foot standard. Shot
putter Ray Martin should give the
Figueroa Streeters another win, al
though the Bruins' Don Vick may •
push him.
Another USC victory is expected
in the discus where Des Koch will

be twirling the plate. However, Vick
will be right on his trail as his best
heave is only eight inches behind
Koch's.
Coach Weiershauser's forces
should earn firsts in two field events
—the javelin and broad jump. Bob
Kimball, John Bugge, and Hank
Roldan will be throwing the spear,
while Frank Herrmann will be aim
ing to better his 24-1 leap.

SEVEN FEET?—Ernie Shelton, the USC high jumper who jumps with one shoe on and one shoe
off, will make another try for the mythical seven-foot mark at the PCC meet in Eugene, Oregon,
this weekend. His best jump this year has been six feet ten inches, while last spring he leaped
6-1 IVi, which was just a fraction off the world's mark.
