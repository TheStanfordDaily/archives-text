# Frost Leads Indians into Bear Match
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Tlu local tennis season will be
wrapped up here on the Farm .to
morrow" afternoon v. in n tlv Co n
Bear.-; froip Berkeley inv; de ti
var.-iiy courts f t J p.m. in a match
j that will decide who holds lown
; the bottom of the lea' ue.
The Cards will be gunning for
their first league win. If they ret it.
they will be sure of a tie for third
place. In 'fie'.r otiicr meeting this
year Cal flattened th? C; id . 7-2, for
their only league win to d;.te.
The top match of the day will fea
ture Stanford captain 1 ;.ck Fro I
and Cai's top man Clii' Mayne. In
their last meeting, at the state cham
pionships earlior in the month, Fro t
smashed Mayne in straight sets.
However, Mayne has always been
able to give Frost plenty of trouble,
j and the match could go either way,
despite Frost's b:ung t .>• betler
. player.
Stanford will be playing without
the services of Roger Keening, who
injured an ankle in last, week's USC
j match. This is a bad break for the
Cards, since Koesing has been a
steady singles winner and also was
; Frost's doubles partner.
Cal's lineup will probably con ;ist
of Mayne. Bill Demas, Buzay Sum
mers, Don Piinley, Ron Wood, and
j Larry Axtell or Stan Hack.
Cal has also had its share of mis
; fortunes as Herschel Hyde was
j dropped from the squad for disci
; plinary reasons.
Coach Bob Renker will stick with
j his usual Stanford lineup — Frost,
j Ernie DuBray, Dave DufT, Bob
Prince, Henry SutclifTe, and Bob
| Norton to replace Keesing.
