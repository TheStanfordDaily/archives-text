### 
MOSCOW—The Soviet Union to
day formally accepted the Western
invitation to a top-level Big Four
conference "in the nearest future."
At the same time Soviet notes to
the Western powers charged Amer
ican officials have shown by their
recent statements that the United
States is really opposed to the idea
of a Big Four meeting "at the sum
mit."
The United States is "already
making plans which doom in ad
vance the four-power conference to
failure," the Soviet notes said.
The Soviet insisted on Vienna as
the site for the conference in the
face of Western opposition. It said
the question of the date "requires
further discussion."
Soviet Foreign Minister V. M.
Molotov called in the envoys of the
United States, Britain, and France
and handed them almost identical
notes replying to the Western invi
tation of May 10.
