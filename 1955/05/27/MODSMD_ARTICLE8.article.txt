# Band Plans To Outclass USC Outfit
## 
### 
Next year the Stanford Band
will make an all-out attempt to
surpass the U.S.C. marching out
fit, in size and playing ability
according to band manager Don
Wells.
One hundred twenty new uni- |
forms have been purchased, and the
band is counting on the support of
the student body to help fill them, I
Wells said. Although the design of
the uniforms is still secret, they are j
supposed to be even flashier than j
those of the Trojans, he added.
Any student who can play an in- i
strument and is interested in play- '
ing for the ' band is invited to be
measured for a uniform tomorrow
morning from 9 to 12 in the band
shack. This will be the best oppor
tunity to try out for the band, the
manager said.
Wells reports that several special
features have already been planned
for next season's half-times. Some
of the half-time exhibitions will be
tributes to Dixieland, Glen Miller,
Walt Disney, and Stephen Foster.
To augment high school interest in
Stanford, Wells said that the band
has planned a High School Day.
Bands from over 50 high schools in
Northern California will combine
efforts in the execution of a single
stunt during the San Jose game
half-time this autumn.
The band manager said that all ,
efforts are being made for the band |
to obtain full co-operation with |
Head Cheer Leader Jim Walters and
the rooting section.
