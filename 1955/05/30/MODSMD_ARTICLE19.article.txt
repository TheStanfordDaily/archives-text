# Card Crew Nabs Second In Regatta at Newport
## Navy Shell Wins By One Length In Rowing Event 
### JIM PIGOTT 
Stanford's never say die crew
outrowed mighty Washington
and California last Saturday to
grab a close second in the fifth
annual Newport Harbor Inter
collegiate Regatta. Navy's
powerful Middies led the four
shell field across the finish line
as they covered the 2,000 meter
course in 6:44.5 minutes. Stan
ford in finishing a length behind,
was clocked at 6:47.9.
The surprising Indian shell shot
past the fading Bears at the 1,000-
meter point and collared Washing
ton in the stretch to bring about one
of the biggest upsets of the season
in crew circles. The distance be- J
tween the Indians and the Huskies
was a scant V4-boat length.
The Stanford junior varsity eight
trailed the University of British Co
lumbia Thunderbirds across the fin
ish marker to place second in the
finals of the collegiate JV races.
ÜBC was caught at 7:03.3 minutes I
with the Indians close behind at |
7:05.5.
TERRIFIC START
The featured varsity contest, be
tween the first two finishers in the
two morning preliminary races, saw
Navy and Washington get off to a
terrific start to establish a lead over
Cal and Stanford. Navy, rowing j
close to 38 strokes a minute at the
outset, built up a margin
over the Huskies who, in turn, led
Cal by about the same distance.
Stanford, as expected, brought up
the rear.

The relative positions of the four j
shells changed very little through- I
out the first half of the race as the I
crews settled down in their estab- j
lished positions. At the midpoint all j
the shells were within one boat
length of one another. It was Navy,
Washington, Cal, and Stanford in j
that order.
MAKE MOVE
At the end of the first half Stan- j
ford, with co-captain Rowd Davis at j
the tiller, started to make its move j
and the Indians quickly pulled even
with Ky Ebright's Bears. This was
the beginning of the crucial part of
the race in which the Cards would
have to move fast if they had any
hope of catching the flying Wash
ington Huskies.
The pressure was definitely on 1
Indian stroke Gordy Best, who was
rowing only his second race from
that position. The blond junior was
up to the task, however, as he took

I the stroke up first to 33 and then
| to 34. Cal was fading out of con
! tention now as the pace quickened
j with Washington and Stanford at
i tempting to catch Navy, the defend
ing champs.
FINISH LINE
The finish line was clearly in sight.
J as Coach Lou Lindsey's boys crept
! up on the giants from the Northwest
| and the 20,000 spectators lined along
the banks cheered in anticipation of
a down-to-the-wire battle between
the two evenly matched shells.
The rest of the story is in the lec
! ord book. The Indians managed
j to overtake the Washington crew,
which was previously unbeaten tin ,
year. The Cards, while recorded in
the record books as finishing second
1 to the outfit from Annapolis, can
! justly consider their race a vict.o
| rious one. It was back in 1915 that
I a Stanford crew last beat Washing-
