# GE Microwave Lab Dedicated
## 
### 
Over 300 people attended the I
formal dedication of General i
Electric's microwave laboratory
in Stanford's light industrial tract
Friday afternoon.
Accompanying the formal cere
monies was the announcement, that
GE has completed the first micro
wave tube developed and built at
the new laboratory.
In welcoming GE to the Stanford
community President Wallace Ster
ling said the close association of the
school and the company would reap
mutual benefits.
Dr. C. G. Suits. GE vice-president
and director of research, delivered a
brief keynote address in which he
also emphasized the big benefits of
a university co-operation program.
He said the original incentive for
research came from universities and
now co-operation had to be contin
ued in order to accelerate the coun
try's program of basic and applied
research.
While laboratory manager H. R,
Oldfield introduced the speakers, j
foundation forms were being read- j
ied for a 100 per cent expansion ol
the lab. The addition will add 10,000 I
square feet to floor space and the
staff will be doubled to include 140 !
employees by the end of the year.
In a dramatic demonstration of the

use of microwaves during the pro
gram, Irving M. Ellis, manager of
communications engineering in GE's
new Redwood City communications
center, spoke to the assemblage over
microwave relay. By remote, push
button control he opened a box on
the speakers' table which contained
the first microwave tube produced
in the laboratory.
The microwave tubes will be ap
plied to advanced military and com
mercial problems. Microwaves are

electrical radiations of such high
frequencies that they have many
properties of visible light. They
cannot be seen, however, and are
little affected by rain, fog, or dark
ness.
At a press luncheon held at Rick
ey's prior to the dedication, W. R. G.
Baker, vice-president of GE and
general manager of the electronics
division, said that when the com
pany decided to spread out across
i the nation it chose Stanford's site.

! because Stanford had the best
school in the area as a result of the
efforts of Dean F. E. Terman of the
School of Engineering.
He said personnel of GE will work
1 closely with Stanford's electronics
and microwave laboratories. Baker
also noted that Stanford had been a
good source for finding men and
added that many GE employees
! have an opportunity for advanced
study at the school, because of the
! microwave lab's close proximity.
