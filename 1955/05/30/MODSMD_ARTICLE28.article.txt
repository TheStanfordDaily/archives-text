### 
Well, it's the last week on Quad for a paper
called Daily as the quarter wends its memo
rable way to a close. And sooner than you
think this ol' surveyor of the scene and multi
farious seniors and grad students will move on
lo questionable bigger and better things.
Among the bigger and better things for this
week is the Tuesday Evening Series finale. Dr.
Ralph Waldo, "eh, eh, boy," Gerard will pre
sent a lecture on "Science and Democracy" at
7:30 in Mem Aud.
Wendell Cole, who designed the admirable
sets for "Hake's Progress," will be featured in
the Wednesday Matinee with an illustrated lec
ture aptly called "Scene Design." It's at 4:15
in that hovel of intellectual learning, the Little
Theater.

You've often heard that worn-out saying,
"Get yours before the Dean does." Well, the
Ol' Boy comes through with the final effort of
the season as Chappie's "Crash Comics" reach
the newsstands Wednesd >y morning for eager
readers. It's going to take a gung-ho, go-gettum
hustler to obtain a copy early, however, as the
Dean is repoite-l to Jje lirst in line. Be Prepared!
* * * «
"Waiting for Lefty," a Political Union and
Ram's Head effort, will be offered free of
charge tomorrow and Wednesday evening at
9 arid 0 respectively in the Little Theater.
The play has the strong tinge of Communism
and according to Hollywood mogul Warner
I.eßoy is "probably one of the most powerful
social plays ever written." W<:. Dare Them All.
The film seiies, the poor man's TV set, bows
out Thursday evening when Humphrey Bocjart

stars in Dashiel Hammett's whodunit, "The
Maltese Falcon." Also seen gadding about the
scene are Mary Astor and that top-drawer bad
man team of Peter Lorre and Sidney Green
street. Drawback, no tix, no pix. It's 7:30 in
Cubberley.

The crew, which has surprised everybody
but its followers, will move against Cal Satur
day noon at the Redwood City boathouse. The
Indian eight has compiled four wins in dual
meets and finished second to Navy in the New
port go. It's their last port of call before Syra
cuse and ihe nationals in lune.
Sunday flicks bowed out last week and thus
student film bugs will seek vicarious cinema
thrills elsewhere. Next week SIRO will hold
its clothes and books drive. Here's a chance
to carry out that bent you've had against Prof.
Snarf and his book, and a chance to cast away
those Eastern tweeds in a worthwhile way.
Dead week begins a week from today with
finals to follow Friday. Seniors will have a ball
June 16 at Castlewood and graduate Sunday,
the 19th.
SLEEPER OF THE WEEK —Here's the last
chance to take some sage advice which has
proved valuable, oh say once. . . . Don't miss
the Astronomy Club's presentation of a talk by
Hugh Haskel at 8:30 tonight in Room 380. The
topic is "Radio Astronomy." It will be followed
by a telescope observing period on the Row to
view the heavenly bodies. Ouch . . .
Well, as they say in the handbook, bye, In
dians. . . .
