## honor system

To the Editor:
I would like lo emphasize an aspcct of Stanford's
Hoiv.r Sy: tem that .-:c mr> to have I >en neglected.
For ;i .school of this size to have any form of honor
system i.s exceptional. But Stanford's system based
on individual and collective responsibility is unique.
Some critics .-ay that our system is not idealistic
enough, that the emphasis should he entirely on the
individual, and that the individual student should
h; ve no concern for the honesty of his fellow students.
I l.flifve that Stanford's system offers something
more to the development o! integrity and honesty in
the individual. It stresses the vitally important fact
that the individurd is also a member of a community
to which he should be responsible. To say that it is
difficult lor most human beings to feel this respon
sibility to others is merely to state an obvious fact.

A live-and-let-live attitude toward one's fellows is
far easier to take than to feel compelled to act in the
interest of the group or even the offender himself.
To be honest i.s to be consistent with principle. If
this be so, then to have the broadest, most inclusive
principle is to be desired.
Stanford's Honor System, under the Fundamnetal
Standard, offers something more. It is idealistic in
the extreme lor it regards honor as having more than
an individual value. All values have elements of in
dividual judgement. But the higher values of com
munity responsibility, of concern for others, and even
complete individual honestyâ€”demand consideration
of a broader concept of integrity.
To foster'this broader view is the aim of Stanford's
Honor System.
