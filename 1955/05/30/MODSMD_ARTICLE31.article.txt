# WILHELM G. FLUGGE
## Engineering Prof Has Varied Talents Outside of Own Field Other Learning Is 'Great Asset' 
### KEN GREEN 
Scientists and engineers are
: traditionally known to know
nothing about anything outside
of their own specialized field.
While Professor Wilhelm G.
Flugge, a Stanford professor in en
gineering mechanics, has been ob
taining his vast knowledge of engi
neering, he has also learned many
other helpful and useful subjects.
In the course of his work Flugge
has obtained a reading knowledge of
seven different European languages:
Spanish, German, English, French,
j Dutch, Danish, and Italian.
KNOWS SHORTHAND
In addition to the many languages
that he knows, Flugge also knows
shorthand. He contends that the
shorthand is a great asset to him,
and he thinks that all students, en
gineers included, should know it.
Flugge, a native of Germany, re
ceived an Engineer's degree at the
engineering university at Dresden,
Germany. This school concentrated
completely on engineering subjects,
since in Germany students receive
all of their humanities training in
J high school.
Flugge stayed on at the university
as an assistant. In this position, he
corrected papers, assisted in labs,
and held office hours to assist the
professor. During three years as an
assistant at Dresden, Flugge audited
some courses, and he wrote his the
sis for his doctorate.
STRUCTURAL WORK
Soon he went into structural work
I in industry. There he developed an
interest in shell roofs. A shell roof

is a curved, reinforced concrete
roof, and is usually between two
and three inches thick. These thin
rooT.s often span great distances,
sometimes over 150 feet.
Later Flugge went to the Univer
sity of Gcittingen and studied with
Professor Prandtl, who was a world
wide leader in engineering mechan
ics. While at the university, Flugge
accomplished many things.
He obtained his Dozent, which is
a special certificate giving him the
privilege to teach at the university;
he then began to lecture in mechan
ics. During these years he kept up
his interest in shell roofs, and in
1934 his book "Statics and Dynam
ics of Shells" was published.
WORK IN BERLIN
In 1938, Flugge went to work for
Berlin-Adlersh of, an aeronauical re
search laboratory called DVL. In
the laboratory, located just outside
of Berlin, he worked on aeronautical
research and became the head of the
structures division.
Toward the end of the war, the
research laboratory was moved to a
little town in southern Germany in
order to escape the terrific bombing
which was hitting Berlin.
When the war ended, so did DVL.
Flugge, along with some of his Ger
man companions, then joined a
French research organization. The
laboratory was under French lead
ership, but al>l of the research was
done by German personnel. At the
laboratory, which was located at the
town of Wasserburg in the French
Occupation Zone of Germany, they
had to work with very primitive ap
paratus.
DID RESEARCH
They did research in a horse shed
and a cow barn, and most of the
research had to be theoretical since
they had plenty of books, but very
little laboratory equipment. Not
only was it hard to get laboratory

equipment, but writing materials
such as ink and paper were scarce,
and even food was hard to get.
In 1947, Flugge went to work with
the ONERA, which is a French or
ganization similar to the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronau
tics in the United States.
Later, at the request of Professor
Stephen Timoshenko, a Sanford
professor of theoretical and applied
mechanics, Flugge came to Stanford.
GRAD COURSES
Since he has come to Stanford,
Flugge has been made a professor
and has taught graduate courses in
engineering mechanics and aeronau
tical engineering. Many undergrad
uates have come in contact with him
through statics or mechanics of
materials, courses which he also
teaches.
At the present, Professor Flugge,
working with two Ph.D. candidates,
is doing theoretical research in
thermal stresses in shells. For many
years he has been writing a new
book, "Stresses in Shells," which is
a theoretical book on shells, and it
will be finished soon.
Not only is Wilhelm Flugge active
in engineering circles, but so is his
wife. She is Dr. Irmgard Flugge-
Lotz, whom he married in 1937, and
who is also a professor here. She
teaches graduate courses in aerody
namics.

other helpful and useful subjects.
In the course of his work Flugge
has obtained a reading knowledge of
seven different European languages:
Spanish, German, English, French,
j Dutch, Danish, and Italian.
KNOWS SHORTHAND
In addition to the many languages
that he knows, Flugge also knows
shorthand. He contends that the
shorthand is a great asset to him,
and he thinks that all students, en
gineers included, should know it.
Flugge, a native of Germany, re
ceived an Engineer's degree at the
engineering university at Dresden,
Germany. This school concentrated
completely on engineering subjects,
since in Germany students receive
all of their humanities training in
J high school.
Flugge stayed on at the university
as an assistant. In this position, he
corrected papers, assisted in labs,
and held office hours to assist the
professor. During three years as an
assistant at Dresden, Flugge audited
some courses, and he wrote his the
sis for his doctorate.
STRUCTURAL WORK
Soon he went into structural work
I in industry. There he developed an
interest in shell roofs. A shell roof

is a curved, reinforced concrete
roof, and is usually between two
and three inches thick. These thin
rooT.s often span great distances,
sometimes over 150 feet.
Later Flugge went to the Univer
sity of Gcittingen and studied with
Professor Prandtl, who was a world
wide leader in engineering mechan
ics. While at the university, Flugge
accomplished many things.
He obtained his Dozent, which is
a special certificate giving him the
privilege to teach at the university;
he then began to lecture in mechan
ics. During these years he kept up
his interest in shell roofs, and in
1934 his book "Statics and Dynam
ics of Shells" was published.
WORK IN BERLIN
In 1938, Flugge went to work for
Berlin-Adlersh of, an aeronauical re
search laboratory called DVL. In
the laboratory, located just outside
of Berlin, he worked on aeronautical
research and became the head of the
structures division.
Toward the end of the war, the
research laboratory was moved to a
little town in southern Germany in
order to escape the terrific bombing
which was hitting Berlin.
When the war ended, so did DVL.
Flugge, along with some of his Ger
man companions, then joined a
French research organization. The
laboratory was under French lead
ership, but al>l of the research was
done by German personnel. At the
laboratory, which was located at the
town of Wasserburg in the French
Occupation Zone of Germany, they
had to work with very primitive ap
paratus.
DID RESEARCH
They did research in a horse shed
and a cow barn, and most of the
research had to be theoretical since
they had plenty of books, but very
little laboratory equipment. Not
only was it hard to get laboratory

equipment, but writing materials
such as ink and paper were scarce,
and even food was hard to get.
In 1947, Flugge went to work with
the ONERA, which is a French or
ganization similar to the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronau
tics in the United States.
Later, at the request of Professor
Stephen Timoshenko, a Sanford
professor of theoretical and applied
mechanics, Flugge came to Stanford.
GRAD COURSES
Since he has come to Stanford,
Flugge has been made a professor
and has taught graduate courses in
engineering mechanics and aeronau
tical engineering. Many undergrad
uates have come in contact with him
through statics or mechanics of
materials, courses which he also
teaches.
At the present, Professor Flugge,
working with two Ph.D. candidates,
is doing theoretical research in
thermal stresses in shells. For many
years he has been writing a new
book, "Stresses in Shells," which is
a theoretical book on shells, and it
will be finished soon.
Not only is Wilhelm Flugge active
in engineering circles, but so is his
wife. She is Dr. Irmgard Flugge-
Lotz, whom he married in 1937, and
who is also a professor here. She
teaches graduate courses in aerody
namics.
Scientists and engineers are
: traditionally known to know
nothing about anything outside
of their own specialized field.

shorthand is a great asset to him,
and he thinks that all students, en
gineers included, should know it.
Flugge, a native of Germany, re
ceived an Engineer's degree at the
engineering university at Dresden,
Germany. This school concentrated
completely on engineering subjects,
since in Germany students receive
all of their humanities training in
J high school.
Flugge stayed on at the university
as an assistant. In this position, he
corrected papers, assisted in labs,
and held office hours to assist the
professor. During three years as an
assistant at Dresden, Flugge audited
some courses, and he wrote his the
sis for his doctorate.
STRUCTURAL WORK
Soon he went into structural work
I in industry. There he developed an
interest in shell roofs. A shell roof

is a curved, reinforced concrete
roof, and is usually between two
and three inches thick. These thin
rooT.s often span great distances,
sometimes over 150 feet.
Later Flugge went to the Univer
sity of Gcittingen and studied with
Professor Prandtl, who was a world
wide leader in engineering mechan
ics. While at the university, Flugge
accomplished many things.
He obtained his Dozent, which is
a special certificate giving him the
privilege to teach at the university;
he then began to lecture in mechan
ics. During these years he kept up
his interest in shell roofs, and in
1934 his book "Statics and Dynam
ics of Shells" was published.
WORK IN BERLIN
In 1938, Flugge went to work for
Berlin-Adlersh of, an aeronauical re
search laboratory called DVL. In
the laboratory, located just outside
of Berlin, he worked on aeronautical
research and became the head of the
structures division.
Toward the end of the war, the
research laboratory was moved to a
little town in southern Germany in
order to escape the terrific bombing
which was hitting Berlin.
When the war ended, so did DVL.
Flugge, along with some of his Ger
man companions, then joined a
French research organization. The
laboratory was under French lead
ership, but al>l of the research was
done by German personnel. At the
laboratory, which was located at the
town of Wasserburg in the French
Occupation Zone of Germany, they
had to work with very primitive ap
paratus.
DID RESEARCH
They did research in a horse shed
and a cow barn, and most of the
research had to be theoretical since
they had plenty of books, but very
little laboratory equipment. Not
only was it hard to get laboratory

equipment, but writing materials
such as ink and paper were scarce,
and even food was hard to get.
In 1947, Flugge went to work with
the ONERA, which is a French or
ganization similar to the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronau
tics in the United States.
Later, at the request of Professor
Stephen Timoshenko, a Sanford
professor of theoretical and applied
mechanics, Flugge came to Stanford.
GRAD COURSES
Since he has come to Stanford,
Flugge has been made a professor
and has taught graduate courses in
engineering mechanics and aeronau
tical engineering. Many undergrad
uates have come in contact with him
through statics or mechanics of
materials, courses which he also
teaches.
At the present, Professor Flugge,
working with two Ph.D. candidates,
is doing theoretical research in
thermal stresses in shells. For many
years he has been writing a new
book, "Stresses in Shells," which is
a theoretical book on shells, and it
will be finished soon.
Not only is Wilhelm Flugge active
in engineering circles, but so is his
wife. She is Dr. Irmgard Flugge-
Lotz, whom he married in 1937, and
who is also a professor here. She
teaches graduate courses in aerody
namics.
