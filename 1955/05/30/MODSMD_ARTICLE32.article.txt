# POLI UNION
## Communist Propaganda Play Depicts Depression Unrest 
### 
Lefty may be an important figure in the Political Union's presen
tation of "Waiting for Lefty," but he never once appears on the
stage.
The Clifford Odets play, to be given tomorrow night at 9 and
Wednesday night at 8 in the Little Theater, opens with a taxi

drivers' union meeting in a targe
American city during the depression
of the 19305.
As the play opens one chair is
empty—that belonging to Lefty, the
union leader. The audience is taken
through a series of incidents involv
ing the taxi strike while the union
continues to wait for its leader,
Lefty.
The play, written during the de
pressed 'thirties, shows the appeal
that Communism had on many la
borers and labor leaders during that
period.
The play is considered frankly
Communist propaganda" by Warner
Leßoy, director of the performance.
Because it is considered usable
Communist propaganda, the play
may not be presented for an ad
mission charge under the existing
copyright law, according to Leßoy.
In view of its controversial na

ture, it has been banned from many
cities in the past. It will be pre
sented with no sets and in modern
dress.
The 16 participants in the play are
Doug Cook, Richard Learman, Car
olyn Cowan, Walt Blown, Hart
Sprager, Gary Waynesmith, Jim
Weilenman, Dave Pensallow, Ed
Crane, Joel Rogosin, Mary Gohan,
John Benedict, Nancy Widdas, Ma
ria Brierley, Serguey Kondratielf,
and Steve Sandburg.
