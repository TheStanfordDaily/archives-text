Sophomore Herrmann also was i
well under his best jump as his j
winning distance was 23-5%. Mar- |
in Perigo of Oregon was second with |
23-4's, while Wilbur Gary of Idaho j
surprised by taking third on a 23-1 j
leap.
Nelson, who is also a sophomore,
was beaten by UCLA's Dave Rossel
lini in the preliminary heats, but
came back to win when it counted
by edging Jim Ball and Rossellini in
a time of :14.7.
BROWNIE SECOND IN 100
Stanford captured the second
place spots in each sprint to put a
barrier in the way of any USC dom- j
ination. Keith Brownsberger fin
ished a yard behind Gary in the
100, while Walt Garrett likewise
crossed the line a yard behind the
WSC star.
Garrett, earlier in the meet, had
been upset by Mike Larrabee of SC
and Russ Ellis of UCLA in the 440, i
after he had registered the best time I
in the preliminaries.

The Troymen and the Bruins
staged a neck-and-neck battle in
the mile relay, but the Westwood
! runners managed to edge their
cross-town rivals by three-tenths of
j a second in 3:15.4. The Indians were
third 10 yards back.
In the high jump, another meet
record fell as expected. Trojan whiz
Ernie Shelton cleared the (5-10 bar
lor an easy victory, and then tried
three times lor the much-talked
! about seven-foot mark. On his final
I try, he managed to get completely
| over the bar, but then knocked the
; bar oft with his toe on the way
j down.
FOUR MORE POINTS
The Tribe's John Stewart, and
Phil Fehlen finished third and fifth
respectively in the high jump to
add another four points to the Stan
ford total.
Other meet winners were Jim
Bailey of Oregon in the 880 (1:52.0),
Leon Clarke of USC in the low hur
dles (:24.0), Ray Martin of USC in
