With a stirring display of
raw courage, the Stanford Law
School faculty swept the Med
faculty off the links 12 V2 to lIV 2
in an inspired effort on the golf
course Thursday.
In the words of Professor John
Merryman, head of the Law School
team, "It was truly neart-warming
to see this group of law professors,
using old borrowed clubs, wearing
tattered sweaters; gaunt, haggard,
overworked men, forced to carry
their own clubs, suddenly rise to
overcome the powerful Med School
golf machine."
The cause of this truly wonderful
performance can be found in an in
cident that took place a day pre
vious to the match in the office of
Law School Dean Carl Spaeth. "Sam
Thurman of our team was unable to
play in the tournament and when I
spoke to him before the match he

said to me, 'Carl, ask the boys to
win this one for Old Sam Thurman.'
When I told my men this, it was all
I could do to keep them from rip
ping the Med School team apart
bodily."
Dean Robson, strangely reluctant
to discuss the outcome of the match,
stated, "Of course there won't be
any publicity about all this."
In the words of the great poet
philosopher, "It matters not who
won or lost / But how they played
the game."
