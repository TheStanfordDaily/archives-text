### 
DETROIT—The CIO United Auto
Workers' Union, which has threat
ened a strike against Ford Motor
Co., today reduced its demands for
a guaranteed annual wage by more
than 10 per cent.
But company negotiators gave no
indication that they received the
cut - down version of the annual
wage any more favorably than they
had the union's original demand.
They refused to comment on the
new union demand and declined to
say whether they would accept any
form of the guaranteed annual
wage.
The union overture, spokesmen
said, would amount to a reduction
of about 11.5 per cent of the origi
