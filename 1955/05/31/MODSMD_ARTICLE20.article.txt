## 
### 
All students interested in joining
the Men's Glee Club are urged to
sign up now in the Encina lobby
and the ASSU office according to
Joe Lerner, one of the student or
ganizers.
Regular Glee Club activities are
planned for next fall. The Glee Club
constitution was prepared early this
spring and was approved by the
Legislature May 18.
College Glee Clubs have attained
prominence in the East and Middle
Atlantic states, while Pomona is the
only California college that boasts
such a singing organization.
