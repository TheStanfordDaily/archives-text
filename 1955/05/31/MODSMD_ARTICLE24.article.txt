# Starving Caterpillars Munching Campus Oaks
## 
### DICK MEISTER 
Have those little green caterpil- J
lars been bothering you lately? It
seems that every time someone
strolls under one of the oak trees on
campus he comes out of the expe
rience with a few souvenirs—some
of the green caterpillars.
But think of the oak trees. They're
being rapidly stripped of their foli
age by a veritable army of worms.
According to Dirk C. Schroder, Uni
versity gardener foreman, these
worms prefer to eat off the Califor
nia Live Oak trees, which are so
prevalent on the campus. Usually,

. . . Visitin.vr Gourmand
Schroder says, the caterpillars arc i
kept well under control, either by '
insects which live off these worms
or by poisonous insecticide applied
applied by University workmen.
However, Schroder commented, j
every six to eight years something
happens to upset the usual cycle and
the catcrpillar-cating insects don't
kill off enough of the worms. This
year is one of these ofT-cycle ones. 1
and despite all the spraying that is |
being done the bugs are running I

rampant. At times like this, Schro
der says, the caterpillars get so hun
gry that they will eat any plant life
which they can find.
No matter what amount of spray
ing is done, the caterpillars will
come back. Schroder explained that
spraying can only kill the worms
after they've been born; there is no
chemical developed as yet which is
capable of destroying the unhatched
eggs.
Although this year is an especially
bad one for the trees, there have
been worse. Schroder says he has
seen years when almost every tree
on campus was bare of foliage be
cause of the caterpillars' hunger.
Most trees have been sprayed
twice this year for added protection,
Schroder pointed out. noting that
this double-dosage is done only in
such off-cycle years as this one.
Just in case you would like to
know what to call those little in
sects'that drop on you, the name is
Phryganidia Californica.
