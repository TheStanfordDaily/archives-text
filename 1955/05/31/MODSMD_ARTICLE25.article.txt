Life is slowing down considerably on most
other campuses as graduation and finals move
onto the horizon; but the University of Southern
California is managing to kick up a consider
able storm over that.
According to the Daily Trojan, a campaign is
under way to encourage graduating seniors to
boycott their own graduation. And the cam
paign is being led by the USC student body
president.
The reason for all the furor lies in the fact
thctt Governor Allen Shivers of Texas is to be
the speaker and apparently his "policies are not
pleasing to many" of the USC seniors.
Letters are being sent to all members of the
Class of '55 and according to the USC student
body president the mailing costs are being de
frayed by "faculty members who wish to re
main anonymous."
USC also knows that it pays to advertise. The
Daily Trojan gleefully announced that in cele
bration of the USC Diamond Jubilee year, a
blimp equipped with banners and flashing
lights "saluting USC" would travel over the
entire Los Angeles area.
Do you wear Bermuda shorts? If so, you're
immoral. At least, you are in Stillwater, Okla
homa. The Daily Kansan recently reported that
two Oklahoma A&M students were arrested for
appearing in a "public" place clad in Bermuda
shorts, knee socks, shirt, and jacket.

The two policemen who made the arrest de
scribed the shorts as "indecent, immoral, and
foolish."
Self-improvement is a wondrous thing ac
cording to the Colorado Daily. And trying to
do it by means of student suggestions is even
more wondrous, they think.
Recently, the Daily staff placed a suggestion
box on campus and invited students to con
tribute. The resulting suggestions ranged from
"Fire the editor" to "Remove the suggestion
box" to "Don't be so nasty."
All the Daily said was, "We'll try."
At the beginning of 1955, the University of
Colorado was having parking problems and
they decided to ban all cars driven by fresh
men.
Well, the University of Colorado, like other
campuses, is almost at the end of this school
year and it is still having parking problems.
Therefore they have decided to ban all cars
from the campus. During the daytime, that is.
According to a story in the Colorado Daily,
the new approach would call for a parking lot
on the edge of the campus where students
could park during the daytime, thereby reliev
ing campus congestion.
The only problem left now is reconciling the
sophomores, juniors, seniors, graduates, and
professors to walking. The freshmen are used
to it.
