out of proportion
To the Editor:
It is regrettable that Stanford, which claims to be
a first-rate University, should begin economizing with
its libraries.
At the outset of this quarter it was announced that
the stacks would he closed during meal hours, as well
as Saturday and Sunday evenings. The Western Civ
library, moreover, is closed all of Saturday.
But why do the libraries lack the money to operate
on a full schedule? Is it because too much is being
spent on many arid wonderous physical improvements
—dormitories, roads, lawns (and possibly a basket
ball pavilion, in the future)? If so, then we feel some
thing is out of pioportion, and the administration has
a strange sense of values.

Interesting statistics in this regard are those
which showed 4 per cent of the University's total
operating expenditures going to the Libraries in a
recent yecr; this figure placed Stanford behind five
other Pacific Coast colleges in this department.
Remember also, however, that much of the money
given to Stanford for special projects is specifically
earmarked for use in specific departments or for

specific purposes. Apparently the Libraries' press
ing need for money should l>e made more evident
to both the University and to its benefactors. —Ed,
gross overcharge
To the Editor:
Movies in Palo Alto cost too much. A dollar and
twenty-five cents is a gross overcharge for this par
ticular type of entertainment, especially in view of
the fact that other theaters in the surrounding area
<lo not deem it necessary to charge so much.
The fact that both theaters in Palo Alto have raised
their admission fees, simultaneously, indicates that
they arc engaged in a monopoly, a somewhat passe
procedure in America. The theaters justify their
raise in prices by the fact that "it doesn't seem to
hurt our business any." Naturally it does not hurt
their business. They know that most of their patron
age comes from Stanford. They are also assured that
a student at Stanford for sake of convenience and
lack of transportation will attend theaters nearest to
the university, ft is unethical for these theaters to
take such unfair advantage of students looking for an
evening's entertainment.
These theaters do not deserve our patronage.
