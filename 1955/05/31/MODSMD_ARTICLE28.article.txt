# TALENT SHOW
## International Stew Offered By 'Potpourri' 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Cardboard chariots, paint pots,
| and man-made palm trees fill the
lIR shack as American and for
eign students throw their efforts
into the"I" Club's International
Talent Show entitled "Pot
pourri."
Tickets for the show, which will
play Thursday, Friday, and Satur
daw nights at 8:15 in tlie Little
1 heater, are now on sale at the
Cellar for $1 and will sell at the box
office the evenings of the perform
ance.
Several near "international inci
dents" have rocked casting and re
hearsals of the show, although di
rector Al Brouse, president of lIR,
figures that the emergencies will be
ironed out without any serious or
permanent repercussions.
Climaxing a series of international
skits, parodies, fongs, and dances
will be a mock meeting of the Unit
ed Nations Security Council.
The Security Council finds itself
in an embarrassed position in that
the "Potpourri" production at Stan
ford has so successfully mitigated the
world's ill-feeling tijat there is no
work left for the U.N. to do.
Current international crises are
now so relieved that delegates from
Communist and Nationalist China
are seated peaceably in a corner
playing chess for the high stakes of
Formosa.
Here the casting ran into a few
snarls, for it proved impossible to
find a Chinere student willing to
play the role of the Communist del
egate.
At present, the position still re
! mains open.
Casting difficulties also arose
I when the director found that there
j just weren't enough French students
j on campus to represent the French
ministerial fluctuations. Another in
! ternational crisis was only closely
I averted after a Belgian student who
spoke French was approached an I
, asked to play the part of one of
j the French delegates.
The director will now play the
I part.
Tibet also finds itself on the "Pot
i pourri" Security Council because
I the Council figures that it has a
I special propinquity to heavenly
| spirits, and Monaco because the U.N.
J figures that its capital, Montecarlo,
j can supply some much - needed
| finance.

Here the casting ran into a few
snarls, for it proved impossible to
find a Chinere student willing to
play the role of the Communist del
egate.
At present, the position still re
! mains open.
Casting difficulties also arose
I when the director found that there
j just weren't enough French students
j on campus to represent the French
ministerial fluctuations. Another in
! ternational crisis was only closely
I averted after a Belgian student who
spoke French was approached an I
, asked to play the part of one of
j the French delegates.
The director will now play the
I part.
Tibet also finds itself on the "Pot
i pourri" Security Council because
I the Council figures that it has a
I special propinquity to heavenly
| spirits, and Monaco because the U.N.
J figures that its capital, Montecarlo,
j can supply some much - needed
| finance.
