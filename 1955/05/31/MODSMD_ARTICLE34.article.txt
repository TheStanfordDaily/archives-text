## 
### JIM BAKER 
Editor's note. —Howie Dallmar was voted by the Daily Sports staff as Stanford's coach of the year. During
the rest of .the week two other articles in this series will appear. The series will contain Contest of the Year,
and Player of the* Year.

Howie Dallmar arrived at Stanford as head basketball coach last summer with one catch — he
hadn't seen his team. With one of the roughest schedules the basketball team had had coming
up in the winter, he faced a tough job. However, as can be seen by this year's team record, Dallmar
pulled another come-through performance—just as he had in the 1942 NCAA playoffs.
In the playoffs that year, Stanford had swept all opposition in the preliminaries and moved into

the final game with Dartmouth.
With two top stars out, Jim Pollard
and Don Burness, Dallmar took
command, rallied his mates and
blasted the Indians from the East
53-38 as Stanford became the toast
of the cage world. Dallmar was cho
sen the most valuable player of the
tourney for this performance.
For his fine coaching record in his
first year of being head mentor at
Stanford, Dallmar has been chosen
by the Daily sports staff 1955's
"Ctfach of the Year."
This year's team marked up a rec
ord of 17 wins against such teams as
Seton Hall, Vanderbilt, UCLA, and
USC. They suffered only eight
losses.
LONG CAREER
Dallmar's appointment was anoth
er triumph in a long string of vic
tories for him. One year after the
NCAA award, he was called into the
service. However, this did not stop
his basketball playing. As a naval
trainee at Penn, he captained the
Quakers to an Ivy League title, and
was voted the outstanding player to
visit New York in 1945.
Dallmar then turned professional
—for a reported $10,000—and starred
with the Philadelphia Warriors.
He made all-league his first season.
Dallmar returned to Stanford for
a short time in 1948 to finish getting
the degree he was working toward
before the war. and then was ap
pointed head basketball coach at
Penn.
His overall record at Pennsylvania
was 105 wins against 51 losses and
his record in Ivy League competi
tion was 48-26. His Quakers were
Ivy League champions in 1953, but
lost to Notre Dame in the NCAA
district playoffs.
APPOINTED IN 1954
In April of last year, Dallmar was
appointed head coach at Stanford
by Director of Athletics A 1 Masters,
to replace Bob Burnett, who retired
in order to go into private business.
Dallmar has had much experience
being coached—playing under some

•112
of the best coaches. He got his start
with Benny Neff, Lowell High's
coach, came under the tutelage of
Roy Hughes at Menlo, and devel
oped under Stanford's own Everett
j Dean, who is one of the few coaches
! to be selected to the Basketball
I Coaches' Hall of Fame.
As a coach, the Stanford mentor
has had plenty of experience too —
| guiding the Penn cage and baseball
i squads for six years. For several
! seasons he was coaching collegiate
basketball and playing pro at the
same time.
The pleasure with which Dall
mar's selection was received was a
| measure of his ability. As Dean said.
I "He's a player's coach and has the
ability to work with young fellows.
Our boys are fortunate to have the
| opportunity to play under him."

COACH SELECTED—Indian basketball coach, Howie Dallmar, has been named by the Stanford
Daily sporls staff as the Stanford Coach of the Year. Dallmar led his Indian five to a 17 won 8 lost
record last season in his first year as head coach. The 7-5 record compiled by his team in Southern
Division play was good enough for second place in the final standings. Also his squad was able
to take the measure of the Cal Bears four straight times during the course of the season. The last
Stanford team to do this was back in 1949.
