# In Class--or Asleep-Farm Firemen Ready for Action
## Twenty Men Run Campus Department 
### 
What do you have to have to
get a fire? According to chem
ists, all you need is fuel, oxygen,
and sufficient heat. Here at Stan
ford the usual reguirements are
faulty electrical eguipment,
pranksters, or a cigarette care
lessly dropped in a classroom,
in grass, or in bed.
Putting out these tires is the job
of Stanford's Fire Chief John Mars
ton and his crew of 20 firemen—six
full-time men and 14 students. His
base of operations is a big barnlike
building between the Corp Yard offi
ces and the service station.
At his disposal Chief Marston has
some of the latest equipment avail
able, plus trucks and equipment from
Santa Clara county on call through
the Santa Clara Fire Control center.
Stanford's firemen have four trucks
to help them extinguish almost any
type of fire.
The student firemen receive train
ing in firefighting techniques and
the use of equipment in weekly
training sessions. They are on call
24 hours a day—in class or asleep.
Most student firemen notify their

professors of their duties at the be
ginning of the quarter. When the
fire horn blows they are required to
leave class and get to tbe scene of
the fire as quickly as possible.
For their work, the student fire
men receive $20 per month, plus
room. Although no member of the
department has been injured within
the last five years, they all are fully
insured. Chief Marston said that the
waiting list for student firemen jobs
gets longer every year. "There are
at least fifteen now waiting for jobs,"
he said.
The job of the Stanford fire de
partment includes a number of things
besides just putting out the fires.
They are part of the Santa Clara
Civil Defense network, and have as
signed tasks in case of diasaster.
One of the biggest jobs, according
to Chief Marston, is fire prevention.
With most of the campus buildings
dating back several decades or of
dry frame construction, a close watch
must be kept to insure that fire haz
ards are held at a minimum.
The last serious fire which the de
partment had to fight was the Sharon
Estate fire two years ago on Sand
Hill Road. The old building, then
used as a stable, burned to the
ground after three teen-agers alleg
edly set fire to it.
When the firehouse bell rings, day
or night, the six paid firemen who
drive the trucks' start their engines
and roll out of the firehouse with
any of the student firemen on duty
at the time. Chief Marston explained
that three trucks—the squad truck,
a pumper, and a ladder truck—are
sent to every fire, with the other
truck being called out if necessary.
The chief has a radio in his car, a
radio hookup in his home, and an
alarm repeater system in the house
which calls him out on any fire.
Chief Marston explained that the
department has little trouble with
false alarms. "It's seasonal. Besides,"
he explained, "pulling a false alarm
is a violation of the Fundamental
Standard and I guess the students
stay pretty clear of that."


WAITING —Captain Harry Lund, one of Stanford's paid full-time firemen, keeps his shift of the
day and night fire watch. A pulled alarm box sets off a signal through the desk in front of him
which automatically registers four times, ringing a bell in the firehouse and blowing the horn
atop the firehouse after going through a delaying mechanism.


LET'S GO!—Student Firemen John Quinn, Dick Crepeau, Steve
Whipple, and Tom Talbott leap for the study-room door in a
simulated fire alarm. Moving fast, they can be on the trucks in
their fire suits by the time the engines are started. They wear
regular clothes under the fire gear. Standard firefighting suits
are the typical fireman's helmet, a long waterproof coat, and
hip-length boots.


AT THE FIRE—-One of Stanford's fire trucks rolls up on a grass
fire followed by the Fire Chief, John Marston. Marston ex
plained that grass fires account for a large part of the alarms
turned in at Stanford, especially in the spring and summer
months.


GOING DOWN—Student Fireman Tom Talbott hits the pole on
his way to the truck garage. The firemen sleep above the trucks.
When the alarm rings they pull on their boots and run for the
pole. The doors which are closed at night, swing open as the
first man hits the pole. All fifteen men upstairs can get into their
gear, on the trucks, and out of the station in little less than a
minute.


GANGWAY—Engine No. 2, the squad truck, rolls out of the firehouse with the crew in position.
The squad truck, usually driven by Captain Harry Lund, is a 185-horsepower White with an
auxiliary pump engine on the back capable of developing pressures up to 600 pounds per square
inch. It carries a 500-gallon water tank, rescue equipment, and several hundred feet of hose.
The truck, without extra equipment such as hose, cost about $17,500, and is one of four trucks
in the station.

gets longer every year. "There are
at least fifteen now waiting for jobs,"
he said.
The job of the Stanford fire de
partment includes a number of things
besides just putting out the fires.
They are part of the Santa Clara
Civil Defense network, and have as
signed tasks in case of diasaster.
One of the biggest jobs, according
to Chief Marston, is fire prevention.
With most of the campus buildings
dating back several decades or of
dry frame construction, a close watch
must be kept to insure that fire haz
ards are held at a minimum.
The last serious fire which the de
partment had to fight was the Sharon
Estate fire two years ago on Sand
Hill Road. The old building, then
used as a stable, burned to the
ground after three teen-agers alleg
edly set fire to it.
When the firehouse bell rings, day
or night, the six paid firemen who
drive the trucks' start their engines
and roll out of the firehouse with
any of the student firemen on duty
at the time. Chief Marston explained
that three trucks—the squad truck,
a pumper, and a ladder truck—are
sent to every fire, with the other
truck being called out if necessary.
The chief has a radio in his car, a
radio hookup in his home, and an
alarm repeater system in the house
which calls him out on any fire.
Chief Marston explained that the
department has little trouble with
false alarms. "It's seasonal. Besides,"
he explained, "pulling a false alarm
is a violation of the Fundamental
Standard and I guess the students
stay pretty clear of that."


WAITING —Captain Harry Lund, one of Stanford's paid full-time firemen, keeps his shift of the
day and night fire watch. A pulled alarm box sets off a signal through the desk in front of him
which automatically registers four times, ringing a bell in the firehouse and blowing the horn
atop the firehouse after going through a delaying mechanism.


LET'S GO!—Student Firemen John Quinn, Dick Crepeau, Steve
Whipple, and Tom Talbott leap for the study-room door in a
simulated fire alarm. Moving fast, they can be on the trucks in
their fire suits by the time the engines are started. They wear
regular clothes under the fire gear. Standard firefighting suits
are the typical fireman's helmet, a long waterproof coat, and
hip-length boots.


AT THE FIRE—-One of Stanford's fire trucks rolls up on a grass
fire followed by the Fire Chief, John Marston. Marston ex
plained that grass fires account for a large part of the alarms
turned in at Stanford, especially in the spring and summer
months.


GOING DOWN—Student Fireman Tom Talbott hits the pole on
his way to the truck garage. The firemen sleep above the trucks.
When the alarm rings they pull on their boots and run for the
pole. The doors which are closed at night, swing open as the
first man hits the pole. All fifteen men upstairs can get into their
gear, on the trucks, and out of the station in little less than a
minute.


GANGWAY—Engine No. 2, the squad truck, rolls out of the firehouse with the crew in position.
The squad truck, usually driven by Captain Harry Lund, is a 185-horsepower White with an
auxiliary pump engine on the back capable of developing pressures up to 600 pounds per square
inch. It carries a 500-gallon water tank, rescue equipment, and several hundred feet of hose.
The truck, without extra equipment such as hose, cost about $17,500, and is one of four trucks
in the station.
What do you have to have to
get a fire? According to chem
ists, all you need is fuel, oxygen,
and sufficient heat. Here at Stan
ford the usual reguirements are
faulty electrical eguipment,
pranksters, or a cigarette care
lessly dropped in a classroom,
in grass, or in bed.
Putting out these tires is the job
of Stanford's Fire Chief John Mars
ton and his crew of 20 firemen—six
full-time men and 14 students. His
base of operations is a big barnlike
building between the Corp Yard offi
ces and the service station.
At his disposal Chief Marston has
some of the latest equipment avail
able, plus trucks and equipment from
Santa Clara county on call through
the Santa Clara Fire Control center.
Stanford's firemen have four trucks
to help them extinguish almost any
type of fire.
The student firemen receive train
ing in firefighting techniques and
the use of equipment in weekly
training sessions. They are on call
24 hours a day—in class or asleep.

fire horn blows they are required to
leave class and get to tbe scene of
the fire as quickly as possible.
For their work, the student fire
men receive $20 per month, plus

WAITING —Captain Harry Lund, one of Stanford's paid full-time firemen, keeps his shift of the
day and night fire watch. A pulled alarm box sets off a signal through the desk in front of him
which automatically registers four times, ringing a bell in the firehouse and blowing the horn
atop the firehouse after going through a delaying mechanism.


LET'S GO!—Student Firemen John Quinn, Dick Crepeau, Steve
Whipple, and Tom Talbott leap for the study-room door in a
simulated fire alarm. Moving fast, they can be on the trucks in
their fire suits by the time the engines are started. They wear
regular clothes under the fire gear. Standard firefighting suits
are the typical fireman's helmet, a long waterproof coat, and
hip-length boots.


AT THE FIRE—-One of Stanford's fire trucks rolls up on a grass
fire followed by the Fire Chief, John Marston. Marston ex
plained that grass fires account for a large part of the alarms
turned in at Stanford, especially in the spring and summer
months.


GOING DOWN—Student Fireman Tom Talbott hits the pole on
his way to the truck garage. The firemen sleep above the trucks.
When the alarm rings they pull on their boots and run for the
pole. The doors which are closed at night, swing open as the
first man hits the pole. All fifteen men upstairs can get into their
gear, on the trucks, and out of the station in little less than a
minute.


GANGWAY—Engine No. 2, the squad truck, rolls out of the firehouse with the crew in position.
The squad truck, usually driven by Captain Harry Lund, is a 185-horsepower White with an
auxiliary pump engine on the back capable of developing pressures up to 600 pounds per square
inch. It carries a 500-gallon water tank, rescue equipment, and several hundred feet of hose.
The truck, without extra equipment such as hose, cost about $17,500, and is one of four trucks
in the station.
What do you have to have to
get a fire? According to chem
ists, all you need is fuel, oxygen,
and sufficient heat. Here at Stan
ford the usual reguirements are
faulty electrical eguipment,
pranksters, or a cigarette care
lessly dropped in a classroom,
in grass, or in bed.
Putting out these tires is the job
of Stanford's Fire Chief John Mars
ton and his crew of 20 firemen—six
full-time men and 14 students. His
base of operations is a big barnlike
building between the Corp Yard offi
ces and the service station.
At his disposal Chief Marston has
some of the latest equipment avail
able, plus trucks and equipment from
Santa Clara county on call through
the Santa Clara Fire Control center.
Stanford's firemen have four trucks
to help them extinguish almost any
type of fire.
The student firemen receive train
ing in firefighting techniques and
the use of equipment in weekly
training sessions. They are on call
24 hours a day—in class or asleep.
Most student firemen notify their

professors of their duties at the be
ginning of the quarter. When the
fire horn blows they are required to
leave class and get to tbe scene of
the fire as quickly as possible.
For their work, the student fire
men receive $20 per month, plus
room. Although no member of the
department has been injured within
the last five years, they all are fully
insured. Chief Marston said that the
waiting list for student firemen jobs
gets longer every year. "There are
at least fifteen now waiting for jobs,"
he said.
The job of the Stanford fire de
partment includes a number of things
besides just putting out the fires.
They are part of the Santa Clara
Civil Defense network, and have as
signed tasks in case of diasaster.
One of the biggest jobs, according
to Chief Marston, is fire prevention.
With most of the campus buildings
dating back several decades or of
dry frame construction, a close watch
must be kept to insure that fire haz
ards are held at a minimum.
The last serious fire which the de
partment had to fight was the Sharon
Estate fire two years ago on Sand
Hill Road. The old building, then
used as a stable, burned to the
ground after three teen-agers alleg
edly set fire to it.
When the firehouse bell rings, day
or night, the six paid firemen who
drive the trucks' start their engines
and roll out of the firehouse with
any of the student firemen on duty
at the time. Chief Marston explained
that three trucks—the squad truck,
a pumper, and a ladder truck—are
sent to every fire, with the other
truck being called out if necessary.
The chief has a radio in his car, a
radio hookup in his home, and an
alarm repeater system in the house
which calls him out on any fire.
Chief Marston explained that the
department has little trouble with
false alarms. "It's seasonal. Besides,"
he explained, "pulling a false alarm
is a violation of the Fundamental
Standard and I guess the students
stay pretty clear of that."
