DETROIT, May :!()â€”CIO President
Walter Reuther challenged Henry
Ford II today to allow Ford Motor
Co. workers to take a binding vote
on whether they want Ford's "pros
perity package" or Reuther's guar
anteed annual wage plan written
into their new contract.
Reuther's plan called for a com
pany-wide secret vote within two
weeks.
Ford replied by saying he would
give the proposal "full considera
tion."
Reuther said the union would
agree to extend the current five
year Ford contract on a day-to-day
basis if the company agreed to his
unprecedented vote plan. The con
tract expires at .midnight tomorrow.
