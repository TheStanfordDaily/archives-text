# C. Odets' Play Presented With 'Force, Feeling'
## 
### 
By the time "Waiting fot
Lefty" was through last night,
the audience almost felt like
getting up and yelling "Strike!
Strike! Strike" with the rest o{
the union members.
The presentation of Clifford Octets'
play was given with a force and
feeling that made everyone feel that
he was in the taxicab union suffer
ing under the evils of capitalism
during 1935.
The Warner Leßoy-directed play
opened with a bang with Fatt, the
union secretary, played by Doug
Cook, yelling to the packed "union"
audience to avert a strike. The
sense of participation was made
more realistic for the audience by
some half - dozen leather - lunged
members of the cast seated through
out the crowd, offering their com
ments to Fatt's oratory.
Each of the sloucmng union ofTi
cers on stage then had his time as
he moved to the front of the stage
for a scene to show how he hap
pened to be in the union.
First there was Joe, who couldn't
make enough money to support his
wife and two children because of
the boss cutting down on the wages.
Miller, who refused to manufac
ture poison gas and spy for his boss.
The boy friend Sid, who was un
acceptable in his girl friend's fam
ily—Phillips, who couldn't get an
acting job from the booking agent
Fatt —or Dr. Barnes Benjamin, who
was fired from his medical position
because the Senator's son worked in
the hospital and because he was a
Jew.
But the union meeting itself was
the most vivid. Leßoy's directing
rose to an exciting peak with a fight
on stage in which the union gang
sters were subdued.
The play will be presented agnin
tonight at 8, and a discussion of the
issues involved in the production
will be held immediately afterward.
