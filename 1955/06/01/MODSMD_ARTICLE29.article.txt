Legislature will meet tonight for what it
hopes will be the last time this year, and on the
agenda is the proposed ASSU master budget
for 1955- 56: 34 pages of facts and figures, plus
table of contents and introductory letter.
Mention "budget session" to the seasoned
student legislator and he'll start thinking about
sleeping through his Thursday classes. These
cessions have been known to go on into the
morning. Again, they have been known to last
less than an hour. It largely depends on the
degree of preparation.
Student Financial Manager Bob Gable and
his successor for next year, Bill Tooley, worked
in conjunction with ASSU President Pete Bing
to prepare the document for the Legislature,
and Bing presented the document through a
'phone poll' on Monday, to give the legislators
a chance to study their ciphers before 7:30 to
night when the session begins. Bing points
out that there will be many minor matters to
decide on in the document and the draft pre
sented will probably be quite altered in ap
pearance when it gets final Legislature ap
proval tonight ... or tomorrow morning.
It's largely up to the members of the Legis
lature when the approval will come. Hard work

today might mean less work in the full meeting
tonight, but budget study is dry work . . . and
finals are coming. It may be a long session.
Barring budget complications, there seems
little reason to doubt that tonight's will be the
last ASSTJ Legislature meeting of the year.
Looking back over its pre-referendum past as
Excom and the few weeks of its existence as
the brand-new ASSU Legislature, the group can
count achievements which have been long in
the making: a final decision on NSA, a clarifica
tion of the Honor Code, and revamping of stu
dent government stand out in retrospect. Who
has done the job? Why was this an especially
productive year? Strong leadership and an ac
tive, alert membership student government at
Stanford has had this year, but it has had such
before. A combination of circumstances includ
ing hard work in previous years, a few really
eager workers this year and Legislature ac
complished a few things it set out to do. This
hasn't always been the case.
Legislature's last 1954 55 meeting â€” ancf a
long one- will begin at 7:30 p.m. in the Excom
Hoom, Student Union.
