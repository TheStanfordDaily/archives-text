To the Editor:
1 appreciate your continuing, helpful interest in the
Library and its problems, a." indicated by your com
ment in yesterday's Daily in connection with the letter
from Stephen Fender, Brian O'Hara, and Mike Rob
erts. Tin Library does need money, as do many other
departments of the University, but I want to correct
the impression that the closing of the Western Civili
zation Library on Saturdays was due to financial pres
sure. In this instance library hours were curtailed
because of the lack ol enough student readers to
justify the former schedule. The Saturday schedule
will be resumed when hook use in We..l em Civiliza
tion has again returned to normal.

religious freedom?
To the Editor:
We, as Americans are very fortunate to possess re
ligious freedom. In fact, many of us take this hard
lought-for liberty for granted. We seldom realize
that there are many countries in the world which do

not grant their citizens this inalienable right, religious
freedom.
On the back pages of our large metropolitan news
papers, wc read, of an outrageous situation in Iran.
Government troops with fixed bayonets have demol
ished the Baha'i temple in Teheran. The military and
economic aid which the United States has .sent Iran
has been used for the persecution of the second largest
religion in that country. Two weeks ago in Iran, the
Baha'i faith was outlawed, a faith which preaches
that all religions are one—under one God.
The United States, which professes to be the world
leader in religious fredom, is still giving aid to Iran,
a country in which men, women and children are
being slaughtered every day because of their religious
belief.
As long as Baha'is are being murdered in Iran,
Catholics jailed in Hungary, Jews denied the rights
in Egypt, Hindus persecuted in Pakistan, and Protes
tants being lied about in Russia, it is our duty and
responsibility to speak out. If we, the youth of Amer
ica, do not side at once with the cause of religious
freedom all over the world, the day will come in our
own land when certain minority religions will be
pushed into the ground. Let us remember what they
said in Germany before the rise of Hitler: "It couldn't
happen here." RICHARD J. MEYER

from Stephen Fender, Brian O'Hara, and Mike Rob
erts. Tin Library does need money, as do many other
departments of the University, but I want to correct
the impression that the closing of the Western Civili
zation Library on Saturdays was due to financial pres
sure. In this instance library hours were curtailed
because of the lack ol enough student readers to
justify the former schedule. The Saturday schedule
will be resumed when hook use in We..l em Civiliza
tion has again returned to normal.

religious freedom?
To the Editor:
We, as Americans are very fortunate to possess re
ligious freedom. In fact, many of us take this hard
lought-for liberty for granted. We seldom realize
that there are many countries in the world which do

not grant their citizens this inalienable right, religious
freedom.
On the back pages of our large metropolitan news
papers, wc read, of an outrageous situation in Iran.
Government troops with fixed bayonets have demol
ished the Baha'i temple in Teheran. The military and
economic aid which the United States has .sent Iran
has been used for the persecution of the second largest
religion in that country. Two weeks ago in Iran, the
Baha'i faith was outlawed, a faith which preaches
that all religions are one—under one God.
The United States, which professes to be the world
leader in religious fredom, is still giving aid to Iran,
a country in which men, women and children are
being slaughtered every day because of their religious
belief.
As long as Baha'is are being murdered in Iran,
Catholics jailed in Hungary, Jews denied the rights
in Egypt, Hindus persecuted in Pakistan, and Protes
tants being lied about in Russia, it is our duty and
responsibility to speak out. If we, the youth of Amer
ica, do not side at once with the cause of religious
freedom all over the world, the day will come in our
own land when certain minority religions will be
pushed into the ground. Let us remember what they
said in Germany before the rise of Hitler: "It couldn't
happen here." RICHARD J. MEYER
