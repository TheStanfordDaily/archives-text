### DOROTHY CAMPBELL 
With the end of the quarter the ASSU's most recently created
commission. Student-Faculty Committee, is planning projects lor
next year on the basis of an evaluation of this year's activities.
These were designed to promote closer relations between students
and faculty.
Many new ideas were proposed by prospective new members

during the tryouts. "As many
ideas as new members were re
cruited at these tryouts," said Torn
Tilton, tryout chairman.
One suggestion was games of golf
or tennis in which both students and
faculty would participate. The idea,
according to Liz Livadary, commit
tee chairman, was enthusiastically
hailed by both student; and faculty
members'.
Other ideas which came un during
~., ' n I
the interviews were that Jaculty
members might eat at Wilbur Hall
on Monday nights, and that some
way for oil-campus groups to meet
the professors during lunch hours
could be arranged.
Departmental picnics were sug
gested and it was proposed that dur
ing the next year the administration
as well as the faculty be brought
into the program.
VISITS TO CLASSES
Perhaps classes could be opened
at the end of the quarter to inspec
tion by those students who might be
interested in taking them the next
quarter, suggested one new mem
ber. This would facilitate registra
tion at the beginning of the next |
quarter as the students would then
know what they would like io take, j
Other plans far student - faculty
projects include having living group
social chairmen meet to discuss ac- I

tivities in which living groups would
| get together with faculty members.
Student - Faculty Committee has
been put in charge of the advisers'
dinner to be held Sept. 2o and will
work with pre-registration commit
tee. In this way the professors will
have a list of students who come to
their houses during pre-registration
and may invite the same people back
later in the quarter.
The plan begun this quarter to
have faculty members to lunch at
living groups regularly has been
carried through in all the fraterni
ties which expressed a desire to par
ticipate. Most of the eating clubs
have also completed such arrange
ments. Row houses have gone ahead
to contact professors on their own.
NEXT YEAR
"The organization for next year
will be easier now that we have the
tabulations of student and faculty
preferences to work with," said Miss
Livadary. "Intellectual contact will
follow the social. First we want stu
i dents and faculty to meet on an in
! formal basis."
Student - faculty dessert get - to
j gethers are another successfully
j completed project of the committee.
I Response from both groups has been
favorable, according to Miss Liva
: dary. Material from the professors'
courses was discussed in an infor
mal way at the homes of the pro
fessors at these gatherings.
With a new set of by-laws Stu
| dent-Faculty Committee will now
I operate as a commission of the AS
' SU. Since the group has been re
organized and reduced, even more
progress is expected by Miss Liva
dary.
