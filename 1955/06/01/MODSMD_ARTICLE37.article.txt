# First Card-Bruin Court Tilt Voted Game of Year
## 
### BOB DURAND 
On February 7 of this year,
UCLA's basketball team was a
top-heavy favorite to wallop
Stanford in the Pacific Coast
Conference opener that night
and continue on to the southern
division championship in their
remaining games.
In their contests over the holidays,
the Bruins had beaten USF — the
only defeat that the national cham
pions suffered—and had taken the
runner-up position in the big holi
day tournament at Madison Square
Garden.
The Indian cagers, who were un
der the tutorship of a new coach,
had also done well for themselves
on an Eastern road trip by dumping
perennial powers like La Salle and
Vanderbilt. However, they were the
conference dark horse and a definite
underdog to UCLA.
The Pavilion was jam-packed that
night as the two teams took the
floor. Howie Dallmar started his
now famous "iron man five" against
the powerful visitors. The action
went fast and furious, and when the
smoke had cleared, the Tribe cagers
hjd won, 61-55.
TOP SPOUTS EVENT
On the basis of the many thrills
to be had during the game, the ex
citement caused by the upset, and
the importance of the win, this con
test was named as the top Stanford
sports event of the year.
For the many fans who pushed
their way jnto the Pavilion that
night, it was a great win. For the
next 24 hours, people could do noth
ing but talk about how Stanford

was destined for the Pacific Coast
championship—or better.
It was the first time since 1952
that a Stanford basketball team had
beaten the Westwood quintet, and
the "iron men" had done a crack job
of turning the trick. Each one of
the first five — Ron Tomsic, Bill
Bond, George Selleck, Russ Lawlcr,
and Barry Brown—had played his
part to the utmost.
The first half of the contest had
seen the two teams battle on even
terms. The visitors held a 32-30
lead at the half due to the deadly
accuracy of their ace Morris Taft.
In the second half, Taft cooled off
and the Indians went to town.
LEADS SCORING ATTACK
Tomsic, who later in the season
broke Hank Luisetti's all-time scor
ing record, led the scoring attack
for the Cards with 21 points. How

; ever, that was far from being the
j complete story of the Stanford suc
cess.
Center Lawler had as his assign
ment the guarding of Willie Naulls.
The gigantic pivot man from UCLA
was fully bottled up by the sparkling
play of Lawler in what was perhaps
the Card co-captain's greatest game.
Selleck's job was that of field gen
eral. The 5-8 guard was the play
maker, pace-setter, and court lead
er throughout the tilt. Although he
j did not register in the scoring col
| umn, his role of keeping the "five"
functioning was invaluable.
Sophomore Bill Bond came of age
; in the game by gaining his highest
varsity point total for a single game
! and turning in a top-notch defensive
game. Barry Brown consistently out
: rebounded the Bruins to fulfill his
! duties.
