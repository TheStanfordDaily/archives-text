## Rounding the Bases BILL NICHOLS

In just a few more days, Stanford will lose a number of outstanding
I people who have made big contributions to Stanford athletics. Most of them
I have received many headlines during their four-year stay on the Farm,
i but there were those who made their mark in other ways besides those
j which rate long newspaper articles.
The person who typifies the group

1 which has mads behin l-the-head
lines contributions is Gil Duncan.
Duncan has pitched for the JV base
. ball team for four seasons now and
j probably holds the all-time Univer
sity record for games pitched. Bui
his presence on the field and in the
dugout has done a lot to help Coach
Everett Dean's baseballers.
, Dune, or Dinkey as he is known,
1 has been ready and waiting to offer
his pinch-hitting services to Dean
i ever since he arrived on the Farm
from-Mountain View, where he was
an all-star athlete. Although pitch-
I ers aren't usually considered potent
j stickers, Duncan is the exception to
the rule. The scoreboard at the Uni
versity of California field still bears
the dents that Duncan placed in it
in 1953. Rightfielders back up to the
! bank in the Sunken Diamond when
j Dune advanced to the plate.
The championship baseballers of
j 1953 still remember with awe the
time that Gil challenged Ed "Strang-

ler" Lewis to a two out of three fall
match in the lobby of the Hotel Knickerbocker. Lewis backed out. Dun
can was never one to obey training rules on trips either. At 12:30 one
morning before an important UCLA game, Duncan was seen clandestinely |
sneaking into the hotel with a large berry pie which he shared with the
managers.
Duncan, who has pitched his Braves to many important wins over the
Cal Blues, probably is better known by the Bears than any other horse
hider they have faced in the last decade. They exchange frindly banter
before the game, but when the ump calls "Play Ball." Dinkey goes to work.
His trusty right arm throws aspirin tablets up to the dish, and the Indians
bring home another victory.
Duncan's only chance to pitch in a varsity game was in 1953. He came
in to pitch against USC in the 10th inning after the Cards tied up the game
10-10 with eight runs in the last two frames. Duncan had been wanning
up, and when the Stanford batters tied the game with three successive
triples by Jack Shepard. Chuck Essegian and Ray Swarts, the portly hurler
came in to pitch. Bob Murphy was also heating up in the bullpen, and
when Duncan walked Jin: Oros, Coach Dean had the gall to lift Dinkey
in favor of Murphy. The latter retired the side, but to those in the know,
it was Duncan who set up the Trojans for the effort, and when Stanford
went on to score in the bottom of the frame, it was apparent that Duncan
deserved much of the credit for the win.
Duncan plans to go into coaching and P.E. work when he graduates,
and we know that if he retains his present nerve and atttiude, he will be
a big success.

Lou Lindsey and the new boathouse seem to be a winning combo. The
Cards crews have overnight started to win races. Since the war, Indian
oarsmen have been faced with innumerable hardships—a new coach every
year, no financial support, and morning workouts—things that were enough
to scare away most people.
But now, afternoon workouts are the order since the tides at Redwood
City are such that you can row at 4:30 in the afternoon instead of 4:30 in
the morning as at Palo Alto. Lindsay has worked unceasingly for the crew,
and last weekend's second place behind Navy, and ahead of Washington and
Cal, means that the crew has arrived.
This Saturday should see the first victory over California since 1916,
and it will be a well-earned win.

The only other farm teams that still have events remaining are the
tracksters, golfers, and the Crew. The PCC-Big Ten trackmeet and the
NCAA championships are coming up after finals, as are the NCAA golf
tourney and the Syracuse crew regatta.
Stanford won the NCAA golf title two years ago, and this years team
swept all local opposition before it. The crew will meet Navy, Cornell,
Penn, and always tough Washington in their post-finals endeavors, and
although they have only a slim chance of coming out on top, will well rep
resent Stanford.
Keith Brownsberger, Walt Garrett, and the javelin throwers, John
Bugge and Bob Kimball will keep the Card name high on the list at Los
Angeles in the Nationals.
* *
Kimball's and Bugge's throws this season have served to put the Stan
ford name at the head of collegiate javelin ranks. Stanford's Bud Held,
recently ordained as a Presbyterian minister, holds the World Record, and
Stanford has the best 10 javelin throwers in record. Kimball's 239-foot
heave against USC put the Cards ten best several feet beyond California's
top 10 by just a few feet.
