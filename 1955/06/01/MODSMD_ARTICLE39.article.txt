# Indian, Bear Crews Have Long Rivalry
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
This Saturdays' crew race be
tween California and Stanford
will mark the 26th time that the
two arch-rivals have met on the
water. The long and colorful
rowing rivalry between the two
schools first began back in 1904
when California beat the Indians
on the Oakland Estuary.
Since that time, the Berkeley
Bears have managed to triumph 12
times while Stanford has been first
to the finish line on eight occasions. J
Washington was victorious the other
six times. All but one of Stanford's j
wins came in the 1907-1916 era I
when the Palo Altans chalked up
seven firsts in nine years. The other j
lone triumph was last Saturday's j
defeat which the Indians handed the j
Bears on the Newport Harbor.
FIRST WIN
The first time a Stanford shell 1
beat a Cal eight was in 1905, when
the Indian frosh paddled home to I
victory over the Cal frosh on Lake
Washington, in Seattle. In those
days, Washington, Stanford, and
Cal raced each other once a year in
a home-and-home series.
The first time a Stanford varsity
shell beat a Bear crew was in 1907.
The Indians turned the trick on the j
estuary. Two years later, in 1909, J
Stanford won the Pacific Coast j
championship by whipping Wash- ;
ington and California. That year's j
victory over the Bears was the first J
of four straight which the Cards
hung on the Berkeleyites as the
West Coast championship stayed in
Palo Alto until Washington finally
took it home in 1913.
The Huskies held onto the mythi- |
cal title for another year by van
quishing Cal and Stanford but the
Indians came back to win in 1915
when they assembled one of the |
most formidable eights in Stanford j
history. That year's squad went on i
in the national championships to
finish second to a great Cornell eight
by l/16th of a length.
LAST WIN
Enough of the 1915 stalwarts were
back the following year to lead the
Cards to victory over California for
the last time in 39 years.
Since that time, the powerful
Blue juggernaut has swept to vie- j
tory 10 straight times. Coach Kv |
Ebright's eights had never tasted :
defeat, at the hands of the Cards !
until last Saturday's contest which i
saw the vastly improved Indians |
sweep by the Bears at the half-way 112
marker to gain a second behind
Navy.
This time the odds favored the
underdog Indians, who were rated
the dark horse of the coast rowing
ranks. This was the year in which
they were equipped to pull the big
surprise and Coach Lou Lindsey's
boys didn't let the chance slip by.
Next Saturday will be a good
chance for the Indians to prove that
last week's win was no fluke.
Meanwhile, Ebright will be madly j
scrambling through his multitudes
of oarsmen to find the "right"' com
bination.

victory over the Cal frosh on Lake
Washington, in Seattle. In those
days, Washington, Stanford, and
Cal raced each other once a year in
a home-and-home series.
The first time a Stanford varsity
shell beat a Bear crew was in 1907.
The Indians turned the trick on the j
estuary. Two years later, in 1909, J
Stanford won the Pacific Coast j
championship by whipping Wash- ;
ington and California. That year's j
victory over the Bears was the first J
of four straight which the Cards
hung on the Berkeleyites as the
West Coast championship stayed in
Palo Alto until Washington finally
took it home in 1913.
The Huskies held onto the mythi- |
cal title for another year by van
quishing Cal and Stanford but the
Indians came back to win in 1915
when they assembled one of the |
most formidable eights in Stanford j
history. That year's squad went on i
in the national championships to
finish second to a great Cornell eight
by l/16th of a length.
LAST WIN
Enough of the 1915 stalwarts were
back the following year to lead the
Cards to victory over California for
the last time in 39 years.
Since that time, the powerful
Blue juggernaut has swept to vie- j
tory 10 straight times. Coach Kv |
Ebright's eights had never tasted :
defeat, at the hands of the Cards !
until last Saturday's contest which i
saw the vastly improved Indians |
sweep by the Bears at the half-way 112
marker to gain a second behind
Navy.
This time the odds favored the
underdog Indians, who were rated
the dark horse of the coast rowing
ranks. This was the year in which
they were equipped to pull the big
surprise and Coach Lou Lindsey's
boys didn't let the chance slip by.
Next Saturday will be a good
chance for the Indians to prove that
last week's win was no fluke.
Meanwhile, Ebright will be madly j
scrambling through his multitudes
of oarsmen to find the "right"' com
bination.
This Saturdays' crew race be
tween California and Stanford
will mark the 26th time that the
two arch-rivals have met on the
water. The long and colorful
rowing rivalry between the two
schools first began back in 1904
when California beat the Indians
on the Oakland Estuary.
Since that time, the Berkeley
Bears have managed to triumph 12
times while Stanford has been first
to the finish line on eight occasions. J
Washington was victorious the other
six times. All but one of Stanford's j
wins came in the 1907-1916 era I
when the Palo Altans chalked up
seven firsts in nine years. The other j
lone triumph was last Saturday's j
defeat which the Indians handed the j
Bears on the Newport Harbor.
FIRST WIN
The first time a Stanford shell 1
beat a Cal eight was in 1905, when
the Indian frosh paddled home to I
victory over the Cal frosh on Lake
