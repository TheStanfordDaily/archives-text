## (Compiled from dispatches of the United Press) Desegregation Start Ordered by Court 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 31â€”'The Su
preme Court today ordered a
"prompt and reasonable start" to
ward wiping out racial segregation
in the public schools but gave re
luctant Southern states time to work
out ticklish "local problems."
In the unanimous opinion, read by
Chief Justice Earl Warren, the high
court struck down all state and
local laws requiring separation of
races in school.
But it left enforcement of its 1954
non-segregation edict to local fed
eral courts. These were instructed
to require states and school author
ities to make a "prompt and reason
able start toward full compliance"
with the non-segregation order.
Reaction to the decision by South
ern state and Congressional leaders
was mixed. Senator James O. East
land (D., Miss.) said, "To resist is
the only answer." Governor Ray
mond Gary of Oklahoma called the
order "fair and reasonable."
