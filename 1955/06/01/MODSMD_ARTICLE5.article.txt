WASHINGTONâ€”President Eisen
hower said today the United States
has no word "at this moment"
whether Red China will free 51 oth
er Americans as a follow-up to its
release of four U.S. airmen.
He told reporters that the Com
munists said in releasing the four
fliers that the action was ''a token
on their part to do something" to
ease international tensions.
As the four fliers were being sped
home after two years of imprison
ment in Red China, U.N. Secretary
General Dag Hammarskjold was
sending a new message to Red Chi
nese Premier Chou En-lai urging
the release of 11 other U.S. airmen
held by the Communists as spies.
Hammarskjold and Indian Am
bassador Krishna Menon were said
to be instrumental in finally win
ning freedom for the four Ameri
cans.
