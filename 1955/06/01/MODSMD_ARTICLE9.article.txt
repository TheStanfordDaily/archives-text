# TUESDAY SERIES
## Gerard Speaks On 'Science, Democracy' 
### MARY ELLEN ROMNEY 
"Science and democracy are
inextricably related: what hap
pens to one will happen to the
other." Thus spoke Dr. Ralph
Waldo Gerard, setting the key
note for last night's Tuesday
Evening Series lecture, the last
of the quarter.
j Dr. Gerard, an internationally rec
ognized physiologist, is currently do
ing research at the Ford Foundation
Behavioral Sciences Center at Stan
j ford. "Science and Democracy" was
I the topic of his address.
What is science? Dr. Gerard be
j gan by defining the word. "Science
is organized and tested common
sense. It is an attitude and a method
I and the results of these." He quoted
j Coleridge in saying that scientists
| solve problems by the application of
| laws, "curbed and ruddered by sci
ence."
SCIENCE DEFINED
"Science* is a human creation,
j similar to a work of art. It is a way
j of life. If research were stopped now,
i science would be dead in five years.
Facts keep no better than fish."
Continuing his definition, Dr. Ger
ard said: "Science is the auto-cata
lyst of social change. It is public,
operational, empirical, rational, cum
i ulative, and universal." "Science
j may be compared with religion in
that both are quests. 'We must
carry from the altars of the past the
fire, not the ashes.' "
Dr. Gerard fears that we are at
present carrying ashes by our gov
| ernmental and social hindering of
i the free exchange of ideas. "Democ
racy and science are cut from the
| same cloth—both must have the free
; dom to know, the freedom to think,
J the freedom to act. Security regula
-1 tions must be handled verv care
fully."
QUESTION OF REALM
Examining the realm of science,
Dr. Gerard remarked that it is a
subject where scientists differ widely.
"The study of inorganic matter, the
study of the body, and now the mind
itself, have come under scientific
discipline. Can science be applied to
man's collective activity? Dr. Ger
ard believes that it can.
"The power of science will inevi
tably grow—the important thing is
to keep it in good hands. Democracy
i walks on the legs of science and edu
j cation."
Dr. Gerard concluded: "I think
that science will add to the science
| of means, which it already has given
us, a science of ends."

pens to one will happen to the
other." Thus spoke Dr. Ralph

Waldo Gerard, setting the key
note for last night's Tuesday
Evening Series lecture, the last
of the quarter.
j Dr. Gerard, an internationally rec
ognized physiologist, is currently do
ing research at the Ford Foundation
Behavioral Sciences Center at Stan
j ford. "Science and Democracy" was
I the topic of his address.
What is science? Dr. Gerard be
j gan by defining the word. "Science
is organized and tested common
sense. It is an attitude and a method
I and the results of these." He quoted
j Coleridge in saying that scientists
| solve problems by the application of
| laws, "curbed and ruddered by sci
ence."
SCIENCE DEFINED
"Science* is a human creation,
j similar to a work of art. It is a way
j of life. If research were stopped now,
i science would be dead in five years.
Facts keep no better than fish."
Continuing his definition, Dr. Ger
ard said: "Science is the auto-cata
lyst of social change. It is public,
operational, empirical, rational, cum
i ulative, and universal." "Science
j may be compared with religion in
that both are quests. 'We must
carry from the altars of the past the
fire, not the ashes.' "
Dr. Gerard fears that we are at
present carrying ashes by our gov
| ernmental and social hindering of
i the free exchange of ideas. "Democ
racy and science are cut from the
| same cloth—both must have the free
; dom to know, the freedom to think,
J the freedom to act. Security regula
-1 tions must be handled verv care
fully."
QUESTION OF REALM
Examining the realm of science,
Dr. Gerard remarked that it is a
subject where scientists differ widely.
"The study of inorganic matter, the
study of the body, and now the mind
itself, have come under scientific
discipline. Can science be applied to
man's collective activity? Dr. Ger
ard believes that it can.
"The power of science will inevi
tably grow—the important thing is
to keep it in good hands. Democracy
i walks on the legs of science and edu
j cation."
Dr. Gerard concluded: "I think
that science will add to the science
| of means, which it already has given
us, a science of ends."
"Science and democracy are
inextricably related: what hap
pens to one will happen to the
other." Thus spoke Dr. Ralph
