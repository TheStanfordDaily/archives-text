# Farm Grade 'Curve' Is Theory Only
## 
### 
Stanford students planning to
"hit the curve" and pull their
grades up are shooting at a more
and more elusive target, Univer
sity statistics reveal.
"The curve" is Stanford's standard
system of student evaluation, wjiich
in theory assigns grades on the
basis of a comparison of one student
with another. Students whose work
places them in the top 15 per cent of
a class get A, the the next 35 per
cent receive B, then 35 per cent get
C, aVid 15 per cent are graded D.
Failing grades are excluded from
this theoretical curve.
This is the curve of theory. The
curve of fact, tabulated for last au
tumn quarter, was shaped somewhat

differently:
A student in a lower division Eng
lish course had one chance in 10
of receiving an A. A student in an
upper division musi(^ course had one
chance in 10 of not receiving an A.
Students in upper division Ger
man courses received nothing but
A and B, discounting incompletes
and complications.
Almost two-thirds of all lower di
vision journalism course grades
were B. Nearly half of the students
in lower division geography courses
received a grade of C (while less
than one student in 10 in upper di
vision philosophy courses received
this "average grade").
All 12 students in upper division
social science courses received A.

Commenting on the Stanford
curve, Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler states that "almost every
college and university uses some
sort of curve."
"Although these curves do not
vary greatly," Winbigler says,"the
Stanford version tends to be more
generous than most since we allow
50 per cent A's and B's and since we
do not include a theoretical per
centage of failures."
In autumn quarter, 1954, eight of
a total of 60 scholastic groupings
gave less A's and B's than C's, D's,
and failures. In 11 groupings at least
three-fourths of the grades given
were A or B. Twenty-four group
ings showed no failures for the
quarter.

"At Stanford the curve is in
tended simply to give some reason
able consistency to grading," says
Winbigler. '.'lt is not hard-and-fast
or in any way mandatory, and out
analyses show that in actual prac
tice our students are receiving for
A's and B's and fewer C's and D's
than in the suggested (15-35-35-15)
distribution."
Overall percentages for the period
studied show that students in up
per division courses received twice
as many A grades and one-third as
many D grades as the theoretical
curve would dictate.
The statement printed on the back
of mid-term and end-quarter grade
report sheets points out that "This
(15-35-35-15) valuation of grades is

advisory ... It is understood to
admit of a certain degree of flexi
bility in the handling of small or
advanced classes."
Lower division departments offer
ing large, sometimes generally re
quired courses remained closest to
the theoretical curve during autumn
quarter. A typical percentage spread
of grades was in the lower division
history courses: A—15.2, 8—35.1,
C—35.7, D—13.7, F—o.2; 1,295 stu
dents.
At the same time, the Music De
partment, with 89.6 per cent of its
upper division course grades A and
only a little more than 1 per cent
C or below (with 412 students en
rolled), departed radically from the
curve.

"At Stanford the curve is in
tended simply to give some reason

Winbigler. '.'lt is not hard-and-fast
or in any way mandatory, and out
analyses show that in actual prac
tice our students are receiving for
A's and B's and fewer C's and D's
than in the suggested (15-35-35-15)
distribution."
Overall percentages for the period
studied show that students in up
per division courses received twice
as many A grades and one-third as
many D grades as the theoretical
curve would dictate.
The statement printed on the back
of mid-term and end-quarter grade
report sheets points out that "This
(15-35-35-15) valuation of grades is

advisory ... It is understood to

bility in the handling of small or
advanced classes."
Lower division departments offer
ing large, sometimes generally re
quired courses remained closest to
the theoretical curve during autumn
quarter. A typical percentage spread
of grades was in the lower division
history courses: A—15.2, 8—35.1,
C—35.7, D—13.7, F—o.2; 1,295 stu
dents.
At the same time, the Music De
partment, with 89.6 per cent of its
upper division course grades A and
only a little more than 1 per cent
C or below (with 412 students en
rolled), departed radically from the
curve.

Stanford students planning to
"hit the curve" and pull their
grades up are shooting at a more
and more elusive target, Univer
sity statistics reveal.
"The curve" is Stanford's standard
system of student evaluation, wjiich
in theory assigns grades on the
basis of a comparison of one student
with another. Students whose work
places them in the top 15 per cent of
a class get A, the the next 35 per
cent receive B, then 35 per cent get
C, aVid 15 per cent are graded D.
Failing grades are excluded from
this theoretical curve.
This is the curve of theory. The
curve of fact, tabulated for last au
tumn quarter, was shaped somewhat

differently:
A student in a lower division Eng
lish course had one chance in 10
of receiving an A. A student in an
upper division musi(^ course had one
chance in 10 of not receiving an A.
Students in upper division Ger
man courses received nothing but
A and B, discounting incompletes
and complications.
Almost two-thirds of all lower di
vision journalism course grades
were B. Nearly half of the students
in lower division geography courses
received a grade of C (while less
than one student in 10 in upper di
vision philosophy courses received
this "average grade").
All 12 students in upper division
social science courses received A.

Commenting on the Stanford
curve, Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler states that "almost every
college and university uses some
sort of curve."
"Although these curves do not
vary greatly," Winbigler says,"the
Stanford version tends to be more
generous than most since we allow
50 per cent A's and B's and since we
do not include a theoretical per
centage of failures."
In autumn quarter, 1954, eight of
a total of 60 scholastic groupings
gave less A's and B's than C's, D's,
and failures. In 11 groupings at least
three-fourths of the grades given
were A or B. Twenty-four group
ings showed no failures for the
quarter.
