# Encina Set To House Men, Offices
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Encina Hall has probably seen
its last freshman class—its 64th
—but the old dorm has many
years of service left as both a
residence hall and office build
ing.
Through a step-by-step process
the availability of Encina for Univer
sity offices will mean the removal oi
the temporary buildings, according
to Kenneth M. Cuthbertson, assistant
to the President.
Next fall 225 students will live in
the sandstone frosh fortress until
they can move into the new wing of
Stern in January. The entire build
ing will probably be used next year
with two men living in each room,
according to Mrs. Ellene Sumner,
director of Encina.
LONG-RANGE PLANS
Then the University hopes to be
gin rebuilding Encina from the in
side. Long-range tentative plans call
for a development of the center sec
tion for offices and the wings for
men's housing.
Cuthbertson said that the re-con
struction wouldn't be done all at
once, but one wing at a time. The
lounge and bull pen area of Encina
possibly will be converted into office
space also, he said. The fifth floor
won't be used.
Both east and west wings of floors
one. two, three, and four would be
used as a men's dormitory, probably
housing graduates in business.
BASEMENT OFFICES
The office area in the center and
the basement would be occupied by
the administrative departments now
located on Quad as well as the de
partments now in Encina. Cuthbert
son said the intention is to move the
offices which do not have a direct
contact with the students: the Gen
eral Secretary's Office, the Office of
tnformation and Publications, the
Planning Office among others.
These moves would relieve the
over crowding on the Quad and
create more classroom space. The
additional classrooms would permit
the occupants of the temporary
buildings to move to Quad, and the
University would then remove the
temporary buildings, Cuthbertson
said.
The University does not have the
funds available at the moment for
the development in Encina. Cuth
bertson said. He is hopeful that old
Encina residents will be willing to
donate an amount to cover the aver
age cost of one room.
