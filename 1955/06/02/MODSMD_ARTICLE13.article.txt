"I've got a fifth of potato chips
i | down here," said George Gobe'
j j over the phone. "Why don't you
come over and see me?"
And so we did.
Gobel, "just sitting around and
telling a few lies," was also spend
ing a few days vaeationing on the
Peninsula as the guest of an old
friend, Clay Ranibeau, manager of a
new Mountain View motel.
George wasn't able to celebrate a
victory over University Business
Manager Alt' E. Brandin in their
match at the Stanford golf course
I yesterday, but the 'five-foot-three
comedian had plenty of cause to be
jubilant after being recently elected
j entertainment's "Man of the Year"
! j by the Associated Press.
IMPRESSED WITH ROW
Though George isn't talking about
' | golf scores, he had a few compli
' ments for the golf course and the
i | University campus. Gobel was par
| ticularly impressed with fraternity
â€¢ | row and "all thom lovely cots hang
j ing out the windows and every- :
! thing." j

Gobel's wife, waiting inside their
motel room for George to finish the
interview, wasn't over-eager to be
photographed.
"She's not much for picture tak
ing," says Gobel. "It's my lot in life,
she tells me. There's just no rest for
the wicked, I guess, so I take the
pictures."
BACK TO L A.
After a few days in San Francisco,
Gobel will head into Nevada to visit
"a lew old friends." and then he'll
return to Los Angeles to resume his
television chores with Jeff Donnell
("She's a dandy," says Gobel).
Majestic in his red and black vel
vet sandals, Gobel related that he is
olanning to make a movie this sum
mer, a remake of the Barbara Stan
wyck. Henry Fonda flick, "The Lady
Eve."
"I'll give you something that'll
even scoop Hedda," said Gobel as
he told us that his leading lady will
be Mitzi Gaynor. "Hell," said
George, "two more scotches and I'll
tell you my life story."
You just, don't hardly hear them
kind no more.
