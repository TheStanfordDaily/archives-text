To the Editor:
To come to America from a foreign land
is always an experience: so also is a year's
study at Stanford University. To have been
able to do boih has been our lot for this
year. But we have been able to experience
far more than these few words would indi
cate: ior we have been able
to Lve i.i the vital core of the University,
its many and varied living groups, and
share the life within;
to study under men who are excellent
teachers, and from whom we have re
ceived knowledge and inspiration;
to share the non-academic life of the Uni
versity and the community at large, and
the full friendship that it holds;
to take part in the student life of this Uni
versity in the fullest sense of the word,
as if we were part of the Stanford tra
dition from the beginning, rather than
merely a conglomerate group of foreign
students from many parts of the world.
But the greatest experience of all has been
the fact that it was the students of Stanford
that made it possible for us to come to this
University and become a part of it for one
year. We are the seventh group of students
that have come to Stanford on its unique for
eign scholarship program: we do not and

cannot know of what worth our slay at Stan
ford has bean to those who have been our
sponsors and friends, but we do know it is
through a program such as this that inter
national student exchanges can be most use
ful.
Thank you, students of Stanford Univer
sity, for all that you have done for us whilst
we have been here, and we only hope that
you have received from us but one part of
the enjoyment, instruction, and inspiration
that we have by living here with you. Fare
well, Stanford football team, George Ralph,
the Libe, 8 o'clock classes, Lake Lag, ASSU,
end of quarter exams, Foreign Scholarship
Committee, Stanford women (and men), the
Honor Code, President Sterling, ID's . . . we
would rather not leave but we must, com
forted only by the fact that our year at Stan
ford will always remain one of the most
memorable in our whole lives.
