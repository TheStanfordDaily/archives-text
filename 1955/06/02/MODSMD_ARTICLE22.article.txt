To the Editor:
Thursday's golf match between the Law •School
and the Medical School was a marvelous example of
the good effects of sports on intra-mural relation
ships. In the end no one really lost and we all learned
a great deal.
Of the eight rm.tehes played, four were won by the
Medical School, three by the Law School, anrl one
was tied. The Law School was declared the winner
and captured the cup. This certainly represents a
legal victory c.f the first magnitude. There were no
serious injuries nor illnesses, which might be con
strued as a triumph of medicine. But of most sig
nificance was the feat of Dr. Sterling, who by a
stroke of his pen produced a law faculty of such
strength and breadth as to exceed our dreams. Dean
Spaeth ended up with a law faculty most of whom
were not only personally unknown to him, but whom
he had never even considered as potential law faculty
members until their golf handicaps were shown to
him. Thus his circle of acquaintanceships among
university members was greatly increased and in
addition his entire concept of legal pedagogy was
broadened.
To the Law School then, for its brilliant efforts
b')th on and oil the golf course, go our heartiest con
gratulations, and to Dr. Sterling, to whom the victory
really belongs, our best wishes.

To the Editor:
I am a first-year student in the School of Law. As
an elementary exercise in fact-finding and argumen
tation, Dean Spaeth has asked me to reply to Dr.
Robson's letter of May 27 (above).
Without exception members of the law faculty share
the doctor's enthusiasm for the golf match as a means
of promoting intra-mural relationships. One or two
suggested that Dr. Robson's letter will, so far as the

end of university harmony is concerned, be contra
productive. However, the majority are confident that
nothing he has written will adversely affect the pleas
ant relations which the Law School has established
with those departments of the University whose mem
bers joined the School in defeating the doctors.
There is regret concerning the suggestion that par
ticipation by members of other departments came as
a surprise to Dr. Robson. Under date of May IG, Dr.
Rofcson wrote to the Law School as follows:
"From your letter, it seems apparent that once
again the Medical School can field more able bodied
men than the Law School. Our men are all keen
competitors, and I would hate to disappoint them
by having to play against each other. Do you think
you could pick up some players from other schools?
Of course, we will flatter you by playing our best
men against the Law School."
The Law School did "pick up" some players from
other Schools and formalized their participation in
the match by having them appointed to the Law
School faculty for a twelve-hour period. The Presi
dent's edict, the stroke of the pen to which Dr. Rob
son refers, incorporated the names of the emergency
appointees nunc pro tunc in the University Directory
for 1954-55. Only by this action could the Law School
satisfy the condition laid down by Dr. Robson that
no player could participate in the competition unless
his name appeared in the University Directory for
the current academic year.
I have been asked why the Medical School is able
to field a team of 16 golfers, while the rest of the
University combined is hard put to equal the same
number. By careful examination of the University
Directory and by inquiry at the President's office I
found the answer. Officially listed as Clinical Profes
sors, and therefore qualified to play in the match by
the terms which Dr. Robson astutely stipulated, are
over 400 Clinical Professors of Medicine and 125 full
time Professors. I am reliably informed that Dean
Robson requested this small army of medicos to re
spond to a questionnaire directed to their experience
as golfers and requiring certification as to handicap.
Dr. Robson, we are told, has now come to know quite
intimately almost HO of his faculty of 525. The select
thirty are, of course, doctors with handicaps of less
than 10.
One final point: Dean Robson suggests that the
Law School won the cup this year bnly by reason of
a legal interpretation, and supports his position by
reference to the number of matches won by each
school. According to the Law School Captain. Pro
fessor Mcrryman, Dr. Robson has characteristically
omitted another point in the agreement between the
Schools. The understanding was explicit that the
match play should be scored as follows—one point for
each nine, and one for the eighteen, a total of three
points for the match. Three of the Law School vic
tories were won by a score of .'5 to 0, and only one
of the Medical School victories by the same score.
Hence the Law School victory by a score of 12V2 .to
11V2.
I am confident that Dean Spaeth would want me,
on behall of the Law School, to join in Dean Rob
son's hearty congratulations to Dr. Sterling.

To the Editor:
I am a first-year student in the School of Law. As
an elementary exercise in fact-finding and argumen
tation, Dean Spaeth has asked me to reply to Dr.
Robson's letter of May 27 (above).
Without exception members of the law faculty share
the doctor's enthusiasm for the golf match as a means
of promoting intra-mural relationships. One or two
suggested that Dr. Robson's letter will, so far as the

end of university harmony is concerned, be contra
productive. However, the majority are confident that
nothing he has written will adversely affect the pleas
ant relations which the Law School has established
with those departments of the University whose mem
bers joined the School in defeating the doctors.
There is regret concerning the suggestion that par
ticipation by members of other departments came as
a surprise to Dr. Robson. Under date of May IG, Dr.
Rofcson wrote to the Law School as follows:
"From your letter, it seems apparent that once
again the Medical School can field more able bodied
men than the Law School. Our men are all keen
competitors, and I would hate to disappoint them
by having to play against each other. Do you think
you could pick up some players from other schools?
Of course, we will flatter you by playing our best
men against the Law School."
The Law School did "pick up" some players from
other Schools and formalized their participation in
the match by having them appointed to the Law
School faculty for a twelve-hour period. The Presi
dent's edict, the stroke of the pen to which Dr. Rob
son refers, incorporated the names of the emergency
appointees nunc pro tunc in the University Directory
for 1954-55. Only by this action could the Law School
satisfy the condition laid down by Dr. Robson that
no player could participate in the competition unless
his name appeared in the University Directory for
the current academic year.
I have been asked why the Medical School is able
to field a team of 16 golfers, while the rest of the
University combined is hard put to equal the same
number. By careful examination of the University
Directory and by inquiry at the President's office I
found the answer. Officially listed as Clinical Profes
sors, and therefore qualified to play in the match by
the terms which Dr. Robson astutely stipulated, are
over 400 Clinical Professors of Medicine and 125 full
time Professors. I am reliably informed that Dean
Robson requested this small army of medicos to re
spond to a questionnaire directed to their experience
as golfers and requiring certification as to handicap.
Dr. Robson, we are told, has now come to know quite
intimately almost HO of his faculty of 525. The select
thirty are, of course, doctors with handicaps of less
than 10.
One final point: Dean Robson suggests that the
Law School won the cup this year bnly by reason of
a legal interpretation, and supports his position by
reference to the number of matches won by each
school. According to the Law School Captain. Pro
fessor Mcrryman, Dr. Robson has characteristically
omitted another point in the agreement between the
Schools. The understanding was explicit that the
match play should be scored as follows—one point for
each nine, and one for the eighteen, a total of three
points for the match. Three of the Law School vic
tories were won by a score of .'5 to 0, and only one
of the Medical School victories by the same score.
Hence the Law School victory by a score of 12V2 .to
11V2.
I am confident that Dean Spaeth would want me,
on behall of the Law School, to join in Dean Rob
son's hearty congratulations to Dr. Sterling.

Without exception members of the law faculty share
the doctor's enthusiasm for the golf match as a means
of promoting intra-mural relationships. One or two
suggested that Dr. Robson's letter will, so far as the

end of university harmony is concerned, be contra
productive. However, the majority are confident that
nothing he has written will adversely affect the pleas
ant relations which the Law School has established
with those departments of the University whose mem
bers joined the School in defeating the doctors.
There is regret concerning the suggestion that par
ticipation by members of other departments came as
a surprise to Dr. Robson. Under date of May IG, Dr.
Rofcson wrote to the Law School as follows:
"From your letter, it seems apparent that once
again the Medical School can field more able bodied
men than the Law School. Our men are all keen
competitors, and I would hate to disappoint them
by having to play against each other. Do you think
you could pick up some players from other schools?
Of course, we will flatter you by playing our best
men against the Law School."
The Law School did "pick up" some players from
other Schools and formalized their participation in
the match by having them appointed to the Law
School faculty for a twelve-hour period. The Presi
dent's edict, the stroke of the pen to which Dr. Rob
son refers, incorporated the names of the emergency
appointees nunc pro tunc in the University Directory
for 1954-55. Only by this action could the Law School
satisfy the condition laid down by Dr. Robson that
no player could participate in the competition unless
his name appeared in the University Directory for
the current academic year.
I have been asked why the Medical School is able
to field a team of 16 golfers, while the rest of the
University combined is hard put to equal the same
number. By careful examination of the University
Directory and by inquiry at the President's office I
found the answer. Officially listed as Clinical Profes
sors, and therefore qualified to play in the match by
the terms which Dr. Robson astutely stipulated, are
over 400 Clinical Professors of Medicine and 125 full
time Professors. I am reliably informed that Dean
Robson requested this small army of medicos to re
spond to a questionnaire directed to their experience
as golfers and requiring certification as to handicap.
Dr. Robson, we are told, has now come to know quite
intimately almost HO of his faculty of 525. The select
thirty are, of course, doctors with handicaps of less
than 10.
One final point: Dean Robson suggests that the
Law School won the cup this year bnly by reason of
a legal interpretation, and supports his position by
reference to the number of matches won by each
school. According to the Law School Captain. Pro
fessor Mcrryman, Dr. Robson has characteristically
omitted another point in the agreement between the
Schools. The understanding was explicit that the
match play should be scored as follows—one point for
each nine, and one for the eighteen, a total of three
points for the match. Three of the Law School vic
tories were won by a score of .'5 to 0, and only one
of the Medical School victories by the same score.
Hence the Law School victory by a score of 12V2 .to
11V2.
I am confident that Dean Spaeth would want me,
on behall of the Law School, to join in Dean Rob
son's hearty congratulations to Dr. Sterling.

To the Editor:
Thursday's golf match between the Law •School
and the Medical School was a marvelous example of
the good effects of sports on intra-mural relation
ships. In the end no one really lost and we all learned
a great deal.
Of the eight rm.tehes played, four were won by the
Medical School, three by the Law School, anrl one
was tied. The Law School was declared the winner
and captured the cup. This certainly represents a
legal victory c.f the first magnitude. There were no
serious injuries nor illnesses, which might be con
strued as a triumph of medicine. But of most sig
nificance was the feat of Dr. Sterling, who by a
stroke of his pen produced a law faculty of such
strength and breadth as to exceed our dreams. Dean
Spaeth ended up with a law faculty most of whom
were not only personally unknown to him, but whom
he had never even considered as potential law faculty
members until their golf handicaps were shown to
him. Thus his circle of acquaintanceships among
university members was greatly increased and in
addition his entire concept of legal pedagogy was
broadened.
To the Law School then, for its brilliant efforts
b')th on and oil the golf course, go our heartiest con
gratulations, and to Dr. Sterling, to whom the victory
really belongs, our best wishes.
