# I Hear Music...
## ROGER HAGAN

(Reporter's note: 11 you have en
joyed the music that precedes the
Sunday Flicks, you have been en
! joying the choices of Gil Klapper.
Flick Manager Klapper, who has
n't stopped seething since he read
Tommy Dorsey's "Look" article on
jazz, has contributed the hulk of
today's column.)
Walk into any record store
today and you will be crushed
by the number of new jazz LP's
of quality that have come out in
recent months. Tommy Dorsey,
Buddy Rich, and their Look mag
azine article notwithstanding,
modern jazz is not lifeless nor
are its performers "cool" and in
different.
Take, for example, Contempo
rary's Shelly Manne, Vol. 3—"The
Three." Shelly Manne (drums),
Shorty Rogers (trumpet), and Jim
my Giuffre (sax and clarinet), have
come up with a weird yet chal
lenging set. They apparently de
ckled to leave the piano and bass at
home for purposes of freedom. This
sections of! their solo work and mu
tual thinking from their usual quin
tet sound.
TWO-VOICE COUNTERPOINT
Flip, Shelly's first recorded com
position. uses a two-voice counter
point. in canonic imitation, played
by muted trumpet and clarinet. This
one swings. Whether the others are
strictly jazz or not is debatable.
Rogers' Three on a Row is in the
12-tone idiom of Schoenberg with
an instrumentation he would never
have used: baritone sax against
trumpet and drums. Giuffre's Pas
de Trois is a x-ondo with three dif
ferent subjects treated as three-part
canons.
Prestige—The Modern Jazz Quar
tet, Vol. 2. Unlike most other small
combos todav this groun is truly

chamber jazz. The idea of the en
semble is perfectly balanced with
solo improvisation, the one never
overshadowing the other. With this
balance, the composition is foremost.
The first side features two remark
ably lovely tunes by John Lewis —
Milano and Django.
Capitol — The Woody Herman
Band. Woody's third herd starts off
swinging with Wild Apple Honey i
and doesn't let up, shining when it
comes to Misty Morning. This is a |
very pretty Ralph Burns original
with a moving solo by Bill Perkins'
tenor sax. The band throughout |
has a fresh, vital sound, with good |
Burns arrangements.
SUPERLATIVE RECORDING
Contemporary — Dig Mel Henke.
All deserving pianists should get the
superlative recording job that is
here afforded to Mel Henke. His is
a highly individual style and his
mood ranges from Four Deuces
(from "A Streetcar Named Desire")
to Rubinstein's Kammenoi Ostrow, '
with plenty in between.
Whether you consider Frank Si
natra a jazz singer or not, his Wee
Small Hours—Capitol, is to be reck
oned with. It features 1G lesser
known standards of the type that
are often used as the basis for jazz
improvisation. It is enough to say
that the singing quality is equal to
his last two LP's on Capitol, the
fidelity is better, and Nelson Rid
dle's orchestra is the end in studio
groups. Try Deep in a Dream and
111 Wind.
If Peggy Lee's appearance at the
Fairmont starting next Tuesday is as
well presented as her two albums on
Decca—Black Coffee and Peggy—
the Fairmont will become as inti
mate as, in Billy Strayhorn's Lush
Life, "those very gay places, those
come what may places, where one
relaxes on the axis of the wheel of
life, to get the feel of life, with jazz
and cocktails."

SUPERLATIVE RECORDING
Contemporary — Dig Mel Henke.
All deserving pianists should get the
superlative recording job that is
here afforded to Mel Henke. His is
a highly individual style and his
mood ranges from Four Deuces
(from "A Streetcar Named Desire")
to Rubinstein's Kammenoi Ostrow, '
with plenty in between.
Whether you consider Frank Si
natra a jazz singer or not, his Wee
Small Hours—Capitol, is to be reck
oned with. It features 1G lesser
known standards of the type that
are often used as the basis for jazz
improvisation. It is enough to say
that the singing quality is equal to
his last two LP's on Capitol, the
fidelity is better, and Nelson Rid
dle's orchestra is the end in studio
groups. Try Deep in a Dream and
111 Wind.
If Peggy Lee's appearance at the
Fairmont starting next Tuesday is as
well presented as her two albums on
Decca—Black Coffee and Peggy—
the Fairmont will become as inti
mate as, in Billy Strayhorn's Lush
Life, "those very gay places, those
come what may places, where one
relaxes on the axis of the wheel of
life, to get the feel of life, with jazz
and cocktails."
(Reporter's note: 11 you have en
joyed the music that precedes the
Sunday Flicks, you have been en
! joying the choices of Gil Klapper.
Flick Manager Klapper, who has
n't stopped seething since he read
Tommy Dorsey's "Look" article on
jazz, has contributed the hulk of
today's column.)
Walk into any record store
today and you will be crushed
by the number of new jazz LP's
of quality that have come out in
recent months. Tommy Dorsey,
Buddy Rich, and their Look mag
azine article notwithstanding,
modern jazz is not lifeless nor
are its performers "cool" and in
different.
Take, for example, Contempo
rary's Shelly Manne, Vol. 3—"The
Three." Shelly Manne (drums),
Shorty Rogers (trumpet), and Jim
my Giuffre (sax and clarinet), have
come up with a weird yet chal
lenging set. They apparently de
ckled to leave the piano and bass at
home for purposes of freedom. This
sections of! their solo work and mu
tual thinking from their usual quin
tet sound.
TWO-VOICE COUNTERPOINT
Flip, Shelly's first recorded com
position. uses a two-voice counter
point. in canonic imitation, played
by muted trumpet and clarinet. This
one swings. Whether the others are
strictly jazz or not is debatable.
Rogers' Three on a Row is in the
12-tone idiom of Schoenberg with
an instrumentation he would never
have used: baritone sax against
trumpet and drums. Giuffre's Pas
de Trois is a x-ondo with three dif
ferent subjects treated as three-part
canons.
Prestige—The Modern Jazz Quar
tet, Vol. 2. Unlike most other small
combos todav this groun is truly

chamber jazz. The idea of the en
semble is perfectly balanced with
solo improvisation, the one never
overshadowing the other. With this
balance, the composition is foremost.
The first side features two remark
ably lovely tunes by John Lewis —
Milano and Django.
Capitol — The Woody Herman
Band. Woody's third herd starts off
swinging with Wild Apple Honey i
and doesn't let up, shining when it
comes to Misty Morning. This is a |
very pretty Ralph Burns original
with a moving solo by Bill Perkins'
tenor sax. The band throughout |
has a fresh, vital sound, with good |
Burns arrangements.
