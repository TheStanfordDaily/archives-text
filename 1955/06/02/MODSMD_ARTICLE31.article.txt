# STANFORD
## SPORTSCOPE 
### Bob Durand 
TIME FLIES. It seems like just yesterday that the Stanford gridders
were opening their 1954 season. And even sooner that the same team
journeyed to Berkeley to try and break Cal's Big Game winning streak.
(Alas —we'll try again next year.) And all of a sudden here it is the end
of another year.
For the last two years, two Sports Editors have taken office in the fall
with the resolution, "This will be tlu* year!" Yours truly will have the
privilege of holding the reigns of the sports staff next fall. Will this be
the year?
Quote Pete Grothe (Daily Sports Editor, 1953): "Someday, somewhere,
somehow, some Stanford team is going to beat some California team."

Quote Don Webster (Daily Sports
Editor, 1954): "For a change, they
(Stanford) didn't lose because they
were not trying; they lost because
they were not the best team." Need
less to say, these quotations were
made the day after the Big Game.
As it is still a little early, I am
not going to make a prediction. And
I am not going to make a resolution.
However, I personally feel that I will
be lucky enough to be the first
Sports Editor since 1946 to write a
winning story for Stanford. But more
about this next fall when the two
teams begin to shape up.
MEMORIES—It was an interest
ing year on the Farm in the pigskin
sport. The footballers started off
with a bang winning three straight
games. At that point, a great many
Stanford students were imagining
that they smelled roses. Two weeks
later, the roses had completely dis
integrated. The occasion: a smogg'y
afternoon in Los Angeles and a

merciless UCLA team. Again an
olher quote: "What it was was football."—Deacon Ancly Griffith.
The Tiibe gridders took the field at Berkeley on November with a 4-5
record and the ever-present hope for a win. At the end of the first half,
the situation looked mighty bad lor our side. After the intermission, coach
Chuck Taylor's Big Red Machine fought back gamely paced by several
sophomores. The final score was not too bad after all. 28-20.
Those sophomores plus many other lettermen will be back come fall.
Also back will be the group of freshmen who trampled the Cal Cubs, 60-0,
in the Little Big Game. You can bet that coach Taylor will be pounding
one thing into the heads of his gridders if nothing else. Beat Cal.
At any rate, next year's team should be very interesting. If this spring's
drills mean anything, the Indians should have depth, the likes of which
have not been seen in these parts in a long time. Depth has been one of
Chuck Taylor's big handicaps ever since he took over the coaching reigns.
From the looks of things, next fall's football season will be bigger and
better than ever before, what with a new cheerleader, a "new" band, and
most important an experienced team with one objective. Beat Cal.
Stanford's first two home games are College of Pacific on September 17
and Ohio State on October 1. Hope to see you there.

were not trying; they lost because
they were not the best team." Need
less to say, these quotations were
made the day after the Big Game.
As it is still a little early, I am
not going to make a prediction. And
I am not going to make a resolution.
However, I personally feel that I will
be lucky enough to be the first
Sports Editor since 1946 to write a
winning story for Stanford. But more
about this next fall when the two
teams begin to shape up.
MEMORIES—It was an interest
ing year on the Farm in the pigskin
sport. The footballers started off
with a bang winning three straight
games. At that point, a great many
Stanford students were imagining
that they smelled roses. Two weeks
later, the roses had completely dis
integrated. The occasion: a smogg'y
afternoon in Los Angeles and a

merciless UCLA team. Again an
olher quote: "What it was was football."—Deacon Ancly Griffith.
The Tiibe gridders took the field at Berkeley on November with a 4-5
record and the ever-present hope for a win. At the end of the first half,
the situation looked mighty bad lor our side. After the intermission, coach
Chuck Taylor's Big Red Machine fought back gamely paced by several
sophomores. The final score was not too bad after all. 28-20.
Those sophomores plus many other lettermen will be back come fall.
Also back will be the group of freshmen who trampled the Cal Cubs, 60-0,
in the Little Big Game. You can bet that coach Taylor will be pounding
one thing into the heads of his gridders if nothing else. Beat Cal.
At any rate, next year's team should be very interesting. If this spring's
drills mean anything, the Indians should have depth, the likes of which
have not been seen in these parts in a long time. Depth has been one of
Chuck Taylor's big handicaps ever since he took over the coaching reigns.
From the looks of things, next fall's football season will be bigger and
better than ever before, what with a new cheerleader, a "new" band, and
most important an experienced team with one objective. Beat Cal.
Stanford's first two home games are College of Pacific on September 17
and Ohio State on October 1. Hope to see you there.


THE AXE
TIME FLIES. It seems like just yesterday that the Stanford gridders
were opening their 1954 season. And even sooner that the same team
journeyed to Berkeley to try and break Cal's Big Game winning streak.
(Alas —we'll try again next year.) And all of a sudden here it is the end
of another year.
For the last two years, two Sports Editors have taken office in the fall
with the resolution, "This will be tlu* year!" Yours truly will have the
privilege of holding the reigns of the sports staff next fall. Will this be
the year?
Quote Pete Grothe (Daily Sports Editor, 1953): "Someday, somewhere,
somehow, some Stanford team is going to beat some California team."

Quote Don Webster (Daily Sports
Editor, 1954): "For a change, they
(Stanford) didn't lose because they
were not trying; they lost because
they were not the best team." Need
less to say, these quotations were
made the day after the Big Game.
