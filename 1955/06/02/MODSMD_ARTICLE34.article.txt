# Basketballer Ron Tomsic Wins Daily 'Athlete of Year' Award
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Hon Tomsic must have felt pretty uneasy about the first of December. Two seasons ago as a
sophomore he had been the hottest thing in the PCC as he won the scoring title. Last year with
more experience even greater things had been expected of him. However, a bad knee injury right
at the start of the season had benched him for the year.
Now he was back. It was his final chance to do the things that were expected of him,-since he

had played just enough the season
before to use up that year's eligibil
j ity. Things were a little different
! now. Ron was playing under a new
j coach, and with a large brace on his
knee. People shook their heads and
said that his old blinding court
I speed was gone. What would he do
j now?
The little dark-haired guard from
Oakland answered them in the first
game of the season. Tomsic walked
out onto the Pavilion floor with im
perturbable calmness and potted 29
points against the hapless San Jose
Spartans. Alter that display every
one knew that all was well with Ron
again.
40-P()INT SPLURGE
Indian fans had a feeling that
sooner or later in the season Tomsic
was going to ,break loose and do
something really spectacular. It
I came early in February. USC, the
| defending PCC champion with al
most all its same team back, invaded
the Pavilion for a pair of games.
Friday" night Tomsic was unstop
j pable. He went out and hit on every
kind of shot against the Trojan de
fense. Coach Howie Dallmar took
Ron out of the game with about a
minute remaining, thinking that
Tomsic had done enough for one
game. Stanford statistician Don
Webster ran down to the bench and
talked excitedly to Dallmar. Tomsic
had tied the PCC record for single
game scoring with 38.
Dallmar sent Tomsic back into the
game with scant seconds remaining.
SC put three men on the diminutive
Card. Tomsic got away one shot and
missed, but then was fouled by one
j of the over-eager Trojans. He step
| ped up to the free throw line and
calmly sank both shots.
NEW RECORD
Tomsic broke the old PCC record
of 38 jointly held by himself, Cal's
Dick Tamberg, and UCLA's Ed
Sheldrake. He did it by hitting on
14 for 18 field goal attempts, a blaz
ing 78 per cent, and 12 out of 13
free throws. The next night Ron
cooled off a little and only scored 27
points, but it was enough to smash
Hank Luisetti's Southern Division
three-year scoring record of 1,297
] points.
That weekend was the high point
| in the season, but there were count
j less memorable performances by
| Tomsic, such as the set shot he
I sank against Cal with two seconds
remaining in the game to win 59-57.
I That culminated a three-minute ball
| control stall by the Cards. Ron made
| the shot from about 30 feet out.
Tomsic ended up second to Cal's
Bob McKeen in the PCC scoring
battle as McKeen totaled 267 points
to Tomsic's 253. But to anyone who
I watched the two in action against

each other there was little question
as to who was the more valuable
player.
On the one side would be McKeen
grabbing desperately for the ball,
ineptly heaving it at the basket ev
ery time he got his hands on the
ball, scoring points more through
the law of averages than anything
else. On the other side would be
Tomsic, setting up plays, drawing
out the defense, then feeding the
ball to someone else, and making;
one out of every two field goal at- i
tempts when he did shoot.
Ron finished up the season with
482 total points for an average of
19.3 per game. He also averaged 48
per cent of his field goal attempts
j and 78 per cent of his free throws.
REWRITES RECORDS
In his career at Stanford he re
wrote the score books. His single
game record will never be broken
as this was the last year of division
play in the PCC. He has a Stanford
total of 1,416 points in 87 games for
a lifetime varsity avex-age of 16.2.
He holds the Stanford record for
most points in a season with 515. He
is second in all-time PCC scoring.
Ron Tomsic is honored by Stan
ford fans not only for his offensive
records, though. He will be remem
bered also as a team player who led
the Cards to second place in the
PCC, and as a member of the only
PCC team that stood up to UCLA
in the 1954-55 season.

| Tomsic, such as the set shot he
I sank against Cal with two seconds
remaining in the game to win 59-57.
I That culminated a three-minute ball
| control stall by the Cards. Ron made
| the shot from about 30 feet out.
Tomsic ended up second to Cal's
Bob McKeen in the PCC scoring
battle as McKeen totaled 267 points
to Tomsic's 253. But to anyone who
I watched the two in action against

each other there was little question
as to who was the more valuable
player.
On the one side would be McKeen
grabbing desperately for the ball,
ineptly heaving it at the basket ev
ery time he got his hands on the
ball, scoring points more through
the law of averages than anything
else. On the other side would be
Tomsic, setting up plays, drawing
out the defense, then feeding the
ball to someone else, and making;
one out of every two field goal at- i
tempts when he did shoot.
Ron finished up the season with
482 total points for an average of
19.3 per game. He also averaged 48
per cent of his field goal attempts
j and 78 per cent of his free throws.
REWRITES RECORDS
In his career at Stanford he re
wrote the score books. His single
game record will never be broken
as this was the last year of division
play in the PCC. He has a Stanford
total of 1,416 points in 87 games for
a lifetime varsity avex-age of 16.2.
He holds the Stanford record for
most points in a season with 515. He
is second in all-time PCC scoring.
Ron Tomsic is honored by Stan
ford fans not only for his offensive
records, though. He will be remem
bered also as a team player who led
the Cards to second place in the
PCC, and as a member of the only
PCC team that stood up to UCLA
in the 1954-55 season.


RON TOMSIC
Hon Tomsic must have felt pretty uneasy about the first of December. Two seasons ago as a
sophomore he had been the hottest thing in the PCC as he won the scoring title. Last year with
more experience even greater things had been expected of him. However, a bad knee injury right
at the start of the season had benched him for the year.
Now he was back. It was his final chance to do the things that were expected of him,-since he

had played just enough the season
before to use up that year's eligibil
j ity. Things were a little different
! now. Ron was playing under a new
j coach, and with a large brace on his
knee. People shook their heads and
said that his old blinding court
I speed was gone. What would he do
j now?
The little dark-haired guard from
Oakland answered them in the first
game of the season. Tomsic walked
out onto the Pavilion floor with im
perturbable calmness and potted 29
points against the hapless San Jose
Spartans. Alter that display every
one knew that all was well with Ron
again.
40-P()INT SPLURGE
Indian fans had a feeling that
sooner or later in the season Tomsic
was going to ,break loose and do
something really spectacular. It
I came early in February. USC, the
| defending PCC champion with al
most all its same team back, invaded
the Pavilion for a pair of games.
Friday" night Tomsic was unstop
j pable. He went out and hit on every
kind of shot against the Trojan de
fense. Coach Howie Dallmar took
Ron out of the game with about a
minute remaining, thinking that
Tomsic had done enough for one
game. Stanford statistician Don
Webster ran down to the bench and
talked excitedly to Dallmar. Tomsic
had tied the PCC record for single
game scoring with 38.
Dallmar sent Tomsic back into the
game with scant seconds remaining.
SC put three men on the diminutive
Card. Tomsic got away one shot and
missed, but then was fouled by one
j of the over-eager Trojans. He step
| ped up to the free throw line and
calmly sank both shots.
NEW RECORD
Tomsic broke the old PCC record
of 38 jointly held by himself, Cal's
Dick Tamberg, and UCLA's Ed
Sheldrake. He did it by hitting on
14 for 18 field goal attempts, a blaz
ing 78 per cent, and 12 out of 13
free throws. The next night Ron
cooled off a little and only scored 27
points, but it was enough to smash
Hank Luisetti's Southern Division
three-year scoring record of 1,297
] points.
That weekend was the high point
| in the season, but there were count

Oakland answered them in the first
game of the season. Tomsic walked
out onto the Pavilion floor with im
perturbable calmness and potted 29
points against the hapless San Jose
Spartans. Alter that display every
one knew that all was well with Ron
again.
40-P()INT SPLURGE
Indian fans had a feeling that
sooner or later in the season Tomsic
was going to ,break loose and do
something really spectacular. It
I came early in February. USC, the
| defending PCC champion with al
most all its same team back, invaded
the Pavilion for a pair of games.
Friday" night Tomsic was unstop
j pable. He went out and hit on every
kind of shot against the Trojan de
fense. Coach Howie Dallmar took
Ron out of the game with about a
minute remaining, thinking that
Tomsic had done enough for one
game. Stanford statistician Don
Webster ran down to the bench and
talked excitedly to Dallmar. Tomsic
had tied the PCC record for single
game scoring with 38.
Dallmar sent Tomsic back into the
game with scant seconds remaining.
SC put three men on the diminutive
Card. Tomsic got away one shot and
missed, but then was fouled by one
j of the over-eager Trojans. He step
| ped up to the free throw line and
calmly sank both shots.
NEW RECORD
Tomsic broke the old PCC record
of 38 jointly held by himself, Cal's
Dick Tamberg, and UCLA's Ed
Sheldrake. He did it by hitting on
14 for 18 field goal attempts, a blaz
ing 78 per cent, and 12 out of 13
free throws. The next night Ron
cooled off a little and only scored 27
points, but it was enough to smash
Hank Luisetti's Southern Division
three-year scoring record of 1,297
] points.
That weekend was the high point
| in the season, but there were count
j less memorable performances by
| Tomsic, such as the set shot he
I sank against Cal with two seconds
remaining in the game to win 59-57.
I That culminated a three-minute ball
| control stall by the Cards. Ron made
| the shot from about 30 feet out.
Tomsic ended up second to Cal's
Bob McKeen in the PCC scoring
battle as McKeen totaled 267 points
to Tomsic's 253. But to anyone who
I watched the two in action against

each other there was little question
as to who was the more valuable
player.
On the one side would be McKeen
grabbing desperately for the ball,
ineptly heaving it at the basket ev
ery time he got his hands on the
ball, scoring points more through
the law of averages than anything
else. On the other side would be
Tomsic, setting up plays, drawing
out the defense, then feeding the
ball to someone else, and making;
one out of every two field goal at- i
tempts when he did shoot.
Ron finished up the season with
482 total points for an average of
19.3 per game. He also averaged 48
per cent of his field goal attempts
j and 78 per cent of his free throws.
REWRITES RECORDS
In his career at Stanford he re
wrote the score books. His single
game record will never be broken
as this was the last year of division
play in the PCC. He has a Stanford
total of 1,416 points in 87 games for
a lifetime varsity avex-age of 16.2.
He holds the Stanford record for
most points in a season with 515. He
is second in all-time PCC scoring.
Ron Tomsic is honored by Stan
ford fans not only for his offensive
records, though. He will be remem
bered also as a team player who led
the Cards to second place in the
PCC, and as a member of the only
PCC team that stood up to UCLA
in the 1954-55 season.


RON TOMSIC
Hon Tomsic must have felt pretty uneasy about the first of December. Two seasons ago as a
sophomore he had been the hottest thing in the PCC as he won the scoring title. Last year with
more experience even greater things had been expected of him. However, a bad knee injury right
at the start of the season had benched him for the year.
Now he was back. It was his final chance to do the things that were expected of him,-since he

had played just enough the season
before to use up that year's eligibil
j ity. Things were a little different
! now. Ron was playing under a new
j coach, and with a large brace on his
knee. People shook their heads and
said that his old blinding court
I speed was gone. What would he do
j now?
The little dark-haired guard from
Oakland answered them in the first

out onto the Pavilion floor with im
perturbable calmness and potted 29
