# Students to 'Vote' on Next Year's Flicks
## 
### 
Sunday Flick Manager Gary Gie
low has released a list of 26 films,
from which next year's flick agenda
will be selected, in order to find out
what the students would like to see.
A "ballot box" will be placed in
front of the Cellar today, Gielow
said. He hopes students will "vote"
for their 10 favorites from the list of
26.
Possible Sunday Flicks for next
year include "The Yellow Sky,"
"Laura," "Titanic," "The Star,"
"Stars and Stripes Forever," "Best
Years of Our Lives," "Carnival
Story," "Susan Slept Here," "I'll See
You in My Dreams."
"House of Wax," "Hondo," "To
Have and Have Not," "The Treas
ure of Sierra Madre," "She's Work
ing Her Way Through College,"
"Miracle of Fatima," "April in Par
is," "Trouble Along the Way," "By
the Light of the Silvery Moon,"
"Desert Song."
"Calamity Jane," "Dial M for
Murder," "Dragnet," "Young at
Heart," "One Summer of Happi
ness," "Man on the Eiffel Tower."
Gielow wants to discover both the
type of movie in which the students
are interested (comedy, romance,
adventure) and the individual films
they would like to see.
Gielow also requests campus opin
ion on short subjects.
He would like this information
written on the "ballots" as well as
the list of 10 movies.
