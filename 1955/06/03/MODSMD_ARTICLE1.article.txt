# VILLAGE
## Government Makes Final Proposal 
### 
The Public Housing Authority
made its final proposal to Stan
ford yesterday offering to sell
Stanford Village for $1,170,833.
This was the same price that was
quoted in a preliminary offer
made last February.
Stanford's Board of Trustees will
rcach a final decision at its meeting
June 16, according to a University
source. Stanford will take possession
of the land July 1 if the Board ap
proves the transaction.
85 ACRES
The government will sell 78.72 of
the 85 acre plot to the University
and will, establish an addition to its
nearby U.S. Geological Survey Cen
ter on the remaining land.
The PHA made a $92,250 allow
ance to Stanford which is in keep
ing with the government's national
policy in dealing with dispositions
of housing projects. It is designed
to cover de-activation losses which
Stanford would in this ease incur.
The actual price without the allow
ance was $1,262,983.66 making each
acre worth $16,044. With the allow
ance each acre averages $14,872.14.
SRI LAB
Other interested parties in the land
are the Stanford Research Institute
which is seeking 35 acres for a per
mament laboratory; and the City of
Menlo Park which wants the Village
for expansion and development and
an elementary school site. Previous
University relations with these par
ties have indicated that Stanford will
eventually sell the Village to Menlo
Park and that SRI will obtain its
permanent home.
