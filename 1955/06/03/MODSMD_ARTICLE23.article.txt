As members of ihe Class of 1955 file in'.o
Frost Ampitheater for their graduation cere
mony, they can do so with the knowledge lhat
they have discovered the real moaning behind
the traditional laying cf the class stone on In
ner Quad.
Th-. Clas j of '55 Ins examined tradition and
custom with a new outlook, and the result is a
real heritage to p.:s c.:i to future generations
of students.
As a result of the efforts cf the Senior Class,
eleven students will attend Stanford next fall
on full tuition scholarships made possible by
the '55 Heri.age Fund, the class gift.
Money for the fund was contributed by six
teen businessmen m the area, and their gifts
came ah. r they had talked to members of the
seiror class who explained the idea behind
their proposed class gift.
The Fleritage Fund scholarships will go >o
students who show outstanding leadership
..bility, c ad by dividing the awards between
freshmen arid .sc.ph.jmores, a perpetual cycle

of scholarships can be developed. Student!
who have received a helping hand from a Heri
tage scholarship can carry on the idea.
But the Heritage Fund is not only a worth
while contribution to present students. It sai
also contribute to future university welfare, and
to improved business â–  education relations
The fund can serve as a catalyst to encourage
alumni and corporation support, when the stu
dents have shown a willingness to take the
initiative.
Future senior classes will have the oppor
tunity to put their money and efforts into this
lasting and significant gift. This heritage wi!
go nol only to the scholarship holders, but also
to the classes of '56, '57, and so on. It is a heri
tage which future seniors can be proud to ac
cept, io carry on, and to enlarge.
The cornerstone of a new tradition has beer
la>d this year, inscribed "Heritage Fund, 1955.'
To the graduating seniors we say a thank yoi.
for an outstanding finish to four years of con
tribution to Stanford life.
