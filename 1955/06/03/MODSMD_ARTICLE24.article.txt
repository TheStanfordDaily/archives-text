'throughout all our planning, we have regulated
oui' actions according to this principle of representa
tive government: Basing decisions upon the vote o!
popularly elected representatives who were willing
t> lully investigate those issues which could not
possibly be as thoroughly explained to the electorate
as a whole.
With the sort of principles sketched so far, we have
attempted to solve the problems as they arose, and
change our .setup where possible to anticipate some
of those which might arise in the future. In these de
cisions, we have been painfully aware that we were
really amateurs in the business of government, and
that a;: such, we often fell below our own and every
one else's "expectations." We only hope that the
governments in future years will receive the same
wonderful patience and help which we received from
the student b9dy throughout the pa£t three quarters.
The only way to express adequately the thanks we
feel for our privilege'of representing the Associate I
Students is to direct it to Stanford as a whole, most
warmly and most sincerely. We hope the Wind
of will always blow.
