Just last month the spirit of reform swept
the campus. George Ralph, the winning can
didate for the ASSI) Presidency, campaigned
on a reform platform. And Ralph was put into
office by an extremely large majority of the
voters, who comprised 60 percent of the stu
dent body.
Obviously then, as Ralph himself says, stu
dents do want some sort of "reform" in their
government. Next quarter we'll have to get
down to cases; to decide what, specifically,
students want to be reformed in their govern
ment.
Scrne student comments or; this:
Bob Collins, 'SS: "I think Ralph should fulfill
his campaign promises . . . he should abolish
the cabinet and combine committees."
David Hoedemaker, '55: "There is a great
mass of students who dont' really care about
the student government they had enough of
ii before they came here and are happy io get
away from it. I'm one of them. I think the most
important function of the student body presi
dent is to represent the University to outside
groups. Ralph is capable, I think, although I
don't know him personally."
Hal Tennant, '55i to see him (Ralph)
fulfill his campaign promise to dissolve the
ASSU I'm an apathetic student and see no
reason for student government.

Bob Collins, '57: "I think he should continue
to carry out his campaign promises—abolish
the cabinet and combine superfluous commit
tees or abolish them."
]im Flanagan, '56: "I'm net going to say that
Ralph won't do his darndest—l think he's sin
cere- but I don't think he'll be able to make
any shaking changes. There's a definite need
for improvement in student government."
Tilden Edwards, '57: "I voted for Ralph be
cause I fell he had some insight into the prob
lems of student government, unbiased by sirict
orthodoxy of thinking which you normally find."
At the beginning of the new Legislature's
term in the fall there will be four holdovers
from the old Excom. What reforms do they
think are necessary, if any? Their comments:
Bob Bcwden, frosh represenlativc: "Let's give
it (the new constitution) a try and see what its
inadequacies are."
Dave Brownwood, junior representative: ". .
the plan of more efficiency and greater parlici
pation is a good one."
lon Ccsovich, sophomore representative:
"The new constitution is a reform let's try it
before condemning it."
leanne Tabscctt, cjrad representative: "1 don't
see how we can talk about reforming .some
thing that hasn't been given a fair trial yet."

leanne Tabscctt, cjrad representative: "1 don't
see how we can talk about reforming .some
thing that hasn't been given a fair trial yet."
Just last month the spirit of reform swept
the campus. George Ralph, the winning can
didate for the ASSI) Presidency, campaigned
on a reform platform. And Ralph was put into
office by an extremely large majority of the
voters, who comprised 60 percent of the stu
dent body.
Obviously then, as Ralph himself says, stu
dents do want some sort of "reform" in their
government. Next quarter we'll have to get
down to cases; to decide what, specifically,
students want to be reformed in their govern
ment.
Scrne student comments or; this:
Bob Collins, 'SS: "I think Ralph should fulfill
his campaign promises . . . he should abolish
the cabinet and combine committees."
David Hoedemaker, '55: "There is a great
mass of students who dont' really care about
the student government they had enough of
ii before they came here and are happy io get
away from it. I'm one of them. I think the most
important function of the student body presi
dent is to represent the University to outside
groups. Ralph is capable, I think, although I
don't know him personally."
Hal Tennant, '55i to see him (Ralph)
fulfill his campaign promise to dissolve the
ASSU I'm an apathetic student and see no
reason for student government.

Bob Collins, '57: "I think he should continue
to carry out his campaign promises—abolish
the cabinet and combine superfluous commit
tees or abolish them."
]im Flanagan, '56: "I'm net going to say that
Ralph won't do his darndest—l think he's sin
cere- but I don't think he'll be able to make
any shaking changes. There's a definite need
for improvement in student government."
Tilden Edwards, '57: "I voted for Ralph be
cause I fell he had some insight into the prob
lems of student government, unbiased by sirict
orthodoxy of thinking which you normally find."
At the beginning of the new Legislature's
term in the fall there will be four holdovers
from the old Excom. What reforms do they
think are necessary, if any? Their comments:
Bob Bcwden, frosh represenlativc: "Let's give
it (the new constitution) a try and see what its
inadequacies are."
Dave Brownwood, junior representative: ". .
the plan of more efficiency and greater parlici
pation is a good one."
lon Ccsovich, sophomore representative:
"The new constitution is a reform let's try it
before condemning it."
