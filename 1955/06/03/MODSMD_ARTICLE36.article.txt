# Senior Heritage Fund To Provide 11 Grants
## 
### TACY ANN SMITH 
The Class of 1955 has set a precedent, and because of it, 11 stu
dents will attend Stanford next year on full tuition scholarships
from the first Heritage Fund.
The scholarships were donated by 16 businessmen in the Palo
Alto area, who responded to the "big idea" of senior class leaders
to leave a more significant class gift behind them.
The seniors were dissatisfied with the usual parting token of a
graduating classâ€”a stone bench or drinking fountain suitably in
scribed. Instead, they decided to establish the '55 Heritage Fund
to provide scholarships for undergraduates with outstanding lead
ership gualifications.
Working in pairs, nine men and nine women presented their

plan to a selected group of business
men in this area. They pointed out
that this was an opportunity to
make an investment in future lead
ers and to assist private enterprise
in higher education.
The 16 businessmen responded
with gifts ranging from $250 to
$ 1,500 for a total of more than $8,000.
This will cover the annual tuition of
11 students. The scholarships will
bear the names of the donors.
FOUR FOR SOPHS
Seven of the scholarships will be
awarded to incoming freshmen this
year, and four will go to sopho
mores. In the future, not more than
50 per cent of the funds will be used
for freshmen.
The scholarships will be available
only to freshmen and
but the recipients may apply for
regular University scholarships for
their last two years.
