## Mountaineer-Diplomat Will Deliver Graduation Address 
### JIM PALMER 
Dag Hjalmar Agne Carl Hammarskjold, Secretary-General of
the United Nations and a man who likes to climb mountains, will
address the Class of '55 on "The Nation and the World" at Stan
ford's graduation exercises June 19 in Frost Ampitheater.
As former chairman (1945-1952) of the Swedish Mountaineers

Club and as present (since 1953)
ecutive head of the United Nations,
Dag Hammarskjold has tackled all
kinds of mountains in his 50 years,
the most recent being of the inter
national and problematical variety.
Hammarskjold sees much similar
ity between mountain climbing and
international diplomacy; they call
for the same characteristics—-endur
ance rather than acrobatics, pa
tience, a fir;m grip on realities, care
ful planning, and awareness of
dangers. '"The safest climber is he
who never questions his ability to
overcome all difficulties," Hammar
skjold has 'said.
One of "mountains" that the 5-
foot-10, blond-haired diplomat has
tackled in recent months, his mission
to Peiping to request release of cap
tive airmen, has apparently ended
in a measure of success.
Four released American jet pilots
this week attributed their freedom
"much to the efforts of Hammar

skjold," according to the United
Press.
Hammarskjold, who directs activi
ties of the 60-nation organization
from his office on the 158 th floor of
the U.N. Building in New York, has
a wide background of experience.
At the age of 28, he became an
assistant professor of political eco
nomics at Stockholm University,
where he received his PhD. in 1934.
He served in Sweden as chairman of
the Bank of Sweden, Under Secre
tary of State to the Minister of Fi
nance, Minister of State, Under Sec
retary in the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, and as delegate to many in
ternational conferences.
The Secretary-General, who is the
son of Sweden's neutralist Prime
Minister of World War 11, is also the
I author of a volume on business
I cycles titled "Konjunkturspridnin-
I gen" (sic).

ecutive head of the United Nations,
Dag Hammarskjold has tackled all
kinds of mountains in his 50 years,
the most recent being of the inter
national and problematical variety.
Hammarskjold sees much similar
ity between mountain climbing and
international diplomacy; they call
for the same characteristics—-endur
ance rather than acrobatics, pa
tience, a fir;m grip on realities, care
ful planning, and awareness of
dangers. '"The safest climber is he
who never questions his ability to
overcome all difficulties," Hammar
skjold has 'said.
One of "mountains" that the 5-
foot-10, blond-haired diplomat has
tackled in recent months, his mission
to Peiping to request release of cap
tive airmen, has apparently ended
in a measure of success.
Four released American jet pilots
this week attributed their freedom
"much to the efforts of Hammar

skjold," according to the United
Press.
Hammarskjold, who directs activi
ties of the 60-nation organization
from his office on the 158 th floor of
the U.N. Building in New York, has
a wide background of experience.
At the age of 28, he became an
assistant professor of political eco
nomics at Stockholm University,
where he received his PhD. in 1934.
He served in Sweden as chairman of
the Bank of Sweden, Under Secre
tary of State to the Minister of Fi
nance, Minister of State, Under Sec
retary in the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, and as delegate to many in
ternational conferences.
The Secretary-General, who is the
son of Sweden's neutralist Prime
Minister of World War 11, is also the
I author of a volume on business
I cycles titled "Konjunkturspridnin-
I gen" (sic).
