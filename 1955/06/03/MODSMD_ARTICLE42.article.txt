# 1955â€” Better Than Most
## Football 
### 
Stanford came up with its first
10.-ing football season since 1947 this
past fall; the gridders won their first
three games, but then dropped six
of the next seven.
Injuries hurt the Cards all season
long; Matt Armitage's broken leg
I wa< the most serious. Taylor vacil
lated between two signal callers all
fail; John Brodie seemed to be the
top passer, while Jerry Gustafson
appeared to function best on the
| split-T options.
Biil Tarr was the top rusher on
I the coast, and John Stewart was
j second- in the nation in pass catch
: ing.
Next year, however, there should
be an improvement; an excellent
I freshman team will contribute some
players, and Jerry Goldberg is the
j only non-returnee from the lineup
i that started the Big Game.
