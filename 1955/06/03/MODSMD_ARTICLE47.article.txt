A new coach, an unusually hard
schedule, and a bunch of determined
players proved to be a winning com
bination for Stanford's basketball
team this year as the varsity cagers
compiled a 17-won, 9-lost record.
After an easy start against local

teams, the Indian cagers headed east
for an extended holiday trip. The
high point of this came in New Jer
sey when the Cards tripped Seton
Hall, 65-63, on a last-second goal
by co-captain Russ Lawler. The low
point was hit in the last game when
a weary Tribe was overcome by
lowa.
Stanford opened its conference
schedule by splitting two games with
UCLA, and then winning against
Cal twice. After a Hawaii trip the
Indians took USC twice, to remain
in a first-place tie with the Bruins.
But the southern trips were dis
astrous as Stanford lost twice to
UCLA and USC before recovering
to finish off Cal in two more games
and finish second in the league.
George Selleck, Barry Brown, and
Bill Bond return from the starting
five, and Hap and Ron Wagner,
Beppo Dy*r, JV hopefuls, and sev
eral frosh will be out on the floor
next winter for Dallmar's five.
