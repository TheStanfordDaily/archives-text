The Kmetovic - coached rugby
team did not have too outstanding a
record in the win column, although
they won a majority of their early

games. They lost to Cal and UCLA,
but the highlight of the season came
with the international game with
Oxford-Cambridge.
The O-C ruggers won by a 39-11
score, although the Cards tied it at
8-8 at one time.
