It wasn't a good year for Coach
Bob Renker's tennis squad, but it
ended on a note promising better
things for next season. The Cards
ended up in a tie with Cal for third
place in the Southern Division PCC
with a 1-5 record.
UCLA and USC were just too
tough for the young Indian team.
Even all the breaks seemed to be
bad ones as Stanford dropped
matches to USC and UCLA by 9-0,
7-2 scores on a southland tour, then
lost by identical scores to the same
two teams on the home courts.
Stanford lost to Cal 7-2 in the
first match but closed out the sea
son with a 6-3 win over the Bears.
Renker has his top seven players
all returning. These are headed by
the team captain, Jack Frosh. Be
sides Frost, Ernie Du√üray, Dave
Dufi, Bob Prince, Roger Keeisng,
Bob Norton, and Henry SutclifTe
return.
Jack Douglas led the fro h to a
successful year, culminating with a
9-0 win over Cal.
