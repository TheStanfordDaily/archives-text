Coach Tom Haynie's varsity swim
mers continued their fine record.
They remained undefeated in col
legiate dual meet competition, win
ning seven meets, and lost only to
a star-studded Pan American serv
ice team. In the NCAA champion
ships they took 10th place.
The Cards swept past U§C in the
meet and garnered their sixth
traight championship—an unprece
lented achievement.
Larry Heim was the individual
tar of the team —breaking the 159
ndividual medley record twice dur
ng the year.
Other stars for the Cards were
Dan Osborne, Phil Gay, breaststrok
?r Cole Wilbur, and backstroker
Grunt.
The Indians should have a good
season next year with Gay, Wilbur,
and Grunt all returning, and sensa
tional frosh Robin Moore.
