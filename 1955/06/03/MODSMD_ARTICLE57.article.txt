The 1955 baseball team partook of
a fair to middling season, winning
nine, losing seven in CIBA play.
Dean's hitters took Santa Clara four
times, split with Cal, 2-2, lost three
of four to the Trojans, and split
with UCLA. Like their basketball
brethren, the Cards lost four out of
four in Los Angeles.
The nine loses Rich Scramaglia,
Len Swartz, Sid Hall, Dick Work
man, and Tom Dandurand, and it
will be up to a none too potent frosh
group to replace them. Dutch Feh
ring faces a stern task.
