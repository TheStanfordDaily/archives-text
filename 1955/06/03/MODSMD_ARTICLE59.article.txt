# Frosh Baseball
## 
### 
Dick Clegg's freshman baseball
outfit pounded out 11 victories this
year against five setbacks, three of
the defeats by Cal's Cubs.
Bobby Flanders paced the Pa
poose hitters with a .400 batting
mark. Ron Jones (.375), Al Spur
geon (.353), and Al Shaw (.345)
also proved tough targets to pitch
to.
Gorge Avery, Ben Stevens, and
lefties Rick McElhenny and Don
McLoughlin were the workhorses of
the yearling mound staff.
