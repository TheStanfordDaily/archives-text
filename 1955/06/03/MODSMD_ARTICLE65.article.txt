There was a rebirth of interest in
gymnastics here this year. Under
the coaching of Seth Anderson the
gymnasts placed a man in the NCAA
finals for the first time, and also took
their first second place in the PCC
meet.
Bob Pierce accomplished the
above, and Ru-s Royden and Dick
Marquardt also were valuable men
