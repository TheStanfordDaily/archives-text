# IN REDWOOD CITY
## Oarsmen Test Cal Tomorrow 
### JIM PIGOTT 
The California Bears will bring their wounded legions to town
tomorrow to do battle with Coach Lou Lindsey's eight-oared crews.
The battle ground will be the Redwood City harbor and the time
will be 10:20 for the first contest, between the Junior Varsity shells.
The triple header will be the last chance for local rowing fans io

► Coach Ky Ebright, dean of Amer
ican rowing coaches, will bring a
revenge-minded squad down frorri
the East Bay tomorrow. The Bears
don't take lightly to losing to an up
start Indian eight. In fact, it was
39 years ago that a Stanford shell
beat the Berkeley Bears before they
turned the trick last Saturday. After
1917, Stanford never was given the
opportunity to catch a Bear shell as
Cal went all out to prove its supe
riority.
Tomorrow may see the Ebright
men strain in vain, however. Coach
Lindsey's boys have their confidence
now and they will be extremely
tough to catch, if they once get out
in front. The Cards are in top shape
according to Lindsey and, with co
captain Dan Ayrault moved from

stroke to number 7, the boat has
been going better than ever. Moving
I Ayrault up a notch has bolstered
the starboard side, which had caused
the coaches some anxious moments.
Tomorrow's scrap will only be the
i second three-mile test of the season
for the Indians. Stanford easily
whipped UCLA over the full dis—
