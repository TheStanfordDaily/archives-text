ONE OUT OF FOUR
Stanford applicants must be inter
viewed by a member of the local Ful
bright committee. Such an interview
can perhaps be arranged in summer.
Students not enrolled in a college or
university may apply as "at-large"
applicants.
Of the Stanford student body usu
ally 40 apply, Dr. Wagner told, and
one out of four have received awards.
Strongest competition for awards
is to England, France, and Italy, in
descending order. Dr. Wagner ad
vised that students who could com
plete their study in countries other
than these would have a better chance
of getting a grant.
