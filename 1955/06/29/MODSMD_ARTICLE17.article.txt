A collection of Japanese color
woodcut prints and sketches of
statesmen of the 'twenties are the
current exhibits at the Thomas Wel
ton Stanford Art Gallery.
The Art Gallery is open daily ex
cept Monday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
and Sunday from 12 noon to 4 p.m.
without charge. It is located north
of the Library, opposite History Cor
ner.
The color woodblock prints were
done by the modern Japanese artist
Hiroshi Yoshida. With black, white,
and pastel shades he depicts a vari
ety of subjects. His technique of
overprinting as much as 80 or 90
times gives the woodcuts an unusual
depth effect and subtle color grada
tions.
Included in this collection, lent by
Mr. and Mrs. H. E. Robison of Palo
Alto, are his six views of sailing
boats: mist, morning, forenoon, af
ternoon, evening, and night. Several
mountain scenes, as of Mt. Fuji
yama, are on display.
The black and white dry - point
portraits, entitled "Statesmen of the
Past, 1921-1922," belong to the Hoo
ver Library and Institute. These
portraits, done from life, are of 25
members of the 1921-1922 Washing
ton Conference on the Limitation oi
Armaments. All drawn by Walter
Tittle, and autographed by the sub
jects, they include internationally
known figures from France, China,
Britain, Italy, the United States, and
other countries.
These exhibits will remain at the
Art Gallery through July 17. Far
Eastern art and European paintings
and furniture are in the permanent
collection.
