# Bookstore Rebates May Be Redeemed Spring Quarter, '56
## 
### 
The green cash receipts given at
the Stanford Bookstore have mone
tary value! Not right now, but next
spring.
The Stanford Bookstore, a non
profit organization, divides its gains
among its clients by means of re
bates. In spring purchasers turn in
their green receipts and receive a
percentage of their spendings as re
bates. Returns are often around 20
per cent.
Summer students may turn in
their receipts at the end of summer
quarter in the envelope provided at
the Bookstore office. The Bookstore
will then send their shares home to
them in spring at the time of gen
eral distribution. Students may also
give their receipts to their friends
or deposit them in the red container
by the side entrance, so that a char
ity may receive their rebates.
