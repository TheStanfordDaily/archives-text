# Libe Installs New Loan Procedure
## 
### 
The Circulation Division of the
Main Library has installed a new
charging system at the Loan
Desk and has published a re
vised Lending Code, which be
came effective June 16. Copies
of the new Lending Code are
now available at the Loan Desk
so that students and faculty can
acquaint themselves with its pro
visions.
The new charging system is ex
pected to expedite the circulation of
books from the Main Library stacks.
According to Dr. R. C. Swank, direc
tor of University Libraries, the vol
ume of circulation has increased so
much over the past few years that it
became necessary to find a way to
charge out books faster, keep more
up-to-date and accurate records, and
get returned books back on the
shelves more quickly.
ONE MONTH LOANS
The new Lending Code increases
the length of time that undergradu
ates may keep books from two weeks
to one month. This action is expected
to reduce the number of renewals
that students will require and the
number of overdue fines charged.
Books loaned to graduate students
will also be due in one month, except
that doctoral candidates who have
begun work on their dissertations will
be granted limited faculty privileges
upon recommendation of their faculty
sponsors.
FACULTY
Faculty privileges will remain un
changed except that faculty members
will be requested to return all circu
lating books once each year before
the opening of the autumn quarter
for discharge or renewal.
All books will be subject to im
mediate recall at any time for reserve
purposes or after two weeks from
the date charged out when needed by
another student or faculty member.
