# All-University Reception To Be at Bowman Today
## Welcome to Stanford 
### 
Summer, it seems to me, heightens
the advantages of Stanford.
It brings together serious students
and a stimulating faculty in a highly
congenial atmosphere of common in
terest.
The traditionally informal pattern
of life at Stanford, enhanced by an
incomparable summer climate, fits
easily with any program for extra
curricular enjoyment.
You are welcome here and I look
forward to meeting many of you
personally.
WALLACE STERLING
President, Stanford University

May I welcome you to Stanford
Summer Quarter, 1955?
It is my wish, as well as that of
the Associated Students Excom, that
you take advantage of the educa
tional and social activities which
summer quarter offers, and that you
profit from them.
I hope that this summer quarter
will be a good introduction to our
new students of those traditions by
which this University and its stu
dents live. The Fundamental Stand
ard and Honor Code will, I hope,
earn your respect and allegiance.
