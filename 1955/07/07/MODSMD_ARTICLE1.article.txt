## 
### EDA MENDELS 
ASSU Summer Excom approved the summer budget Tuesday
night, determining the allocation of the $700 granted for the cur
rent quarter by the spring ASSU Legislature.
Excom adopted the budget nearly as presented by summer stu
dent manager Ken Cole. The only modification was a $20 increase

in the allotment to Education Coun
cil, with a corresponding decrease in
the dance fund.
Excom's main function in summer
is that of arranging social affairs for
the student body. All funds may be
utilized for recreational purposes.
Expenses incurred by the two AS
SU functions of the past week, the
all-University reception and Lagu
nita open house, were $305.05.
Projected budget items are as fol
lows:
Watermelon feast $ 40.00
Student police at Wednes
day folkdancing 8.00
Dance fund 266.95
Ed Council 80.00
Total $394.95
This amount, added to expendi
tures to date, is exactly $700.
In other action, Excom approved
the appointment of Gloria Ward as
graduate representative to Excom,
and the election of Eric Mitchell as
representative of the School of Edu
cation.
Bill Tooley, student financial man
ager for the '55-'56 school year, was
approved as member of Men's Coun
cil, in place of Art "Buzz" Varden
who had been appointed but did not
register this quarter.
A committee composed of Presi
dent Jerry Messner, Brenda Sorey.
and George Rice was appointed to
screen applications for ASSU lead
ership scholarships. A fund of $2,250
$1,500 of which is an ASSU appro
priation, $750 a special gift from the
Concert Series, will be divide
among four or five students. Under
normal circumstances, the sprinr
Legislature would have made the
awards, but because of other busi
ness, this was not accomplished.
