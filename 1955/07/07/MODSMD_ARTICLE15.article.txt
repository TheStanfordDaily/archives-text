# Blue Waters Bubble From Libe Fountain
## 
### RIC TEAGUE 
For the past few years the fountain in front of the Main Libe has
offered an opportunity for humor to some of the more gay young
blades here at Stanford. Now it's blue. The water in it, that is.
Who turned it blue is a mystery. Why anyone would turn it
blue is also a mystery. And when the Corp Yard will get around

to unturning it blue is the biggest'
mystery of all.
But after all, nothing is really
wrong with blue water. Artists all
paint their water blue. Beer com
panies advertise beer that comes
from geographical regions that boast
blue water (sky-blue water). Blue
water is pretty popular.
Stanford University, though, is a
pretty academic place. There is a
erious air of study and other noble
pursuits. Blue water in the library

fountain seems a bit frivolous.
Blue water isn't the first abnor
mality to assail the fountain. Last
quarter students passing the foun
tain early one morning noted a sign
advising biology students to examine
the mosquito larvae flourishing
therein. One of Stanford's brighter
souls had stocked the fountain with
the squirming larvae and had of
fered to Bio 3 students a demonstra
tion of "Mosquito Larvae in All
Stages of Development."
Prior to this, the fountain had un
dergone a number of humorous as
saults. A couple of years ago, a
chemistry student startled a torpid
noon-day group of sun-worshippers
by tossing two or three chunks of
odium in the water. It reacted, to
the young chemist's delight.
What fate will next befall the libe
fountain is anybody's guess. There
is, however, one phenomenon that
continually blights the fountain.
Some people seem to use it for a
garbage can. A sort of bubbling Dis
posall. That isn't even funny.

HE'LL DRINK ANYTHING—He must. Otherwise he wouldn't be
drinking the azure fluid in the fountain in front of the Main Li
brary. Man's best friend (at least this one) is well known to
students for his foraging at the Cellar. Here he forages for a
drink on a hot day.
