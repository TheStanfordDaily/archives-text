# Village Transfer Delayed by Title Insurance Snag
## 
### 
The formal transfer of Stanford
Village to the University from the
United States government has been
delayed and officials do not expect
it to be completed until Aug. 1.
The delay in obtaining the title to
the land was incurred by difficulties
in clearing title in urance, according
to University officials. However,
they said that they expect to take
over accounting and arrangements
by Aug. 1.
The University agreed earlier this
year to purchase the 78 acres of the
Stanford Village site from the gov
ernment for $1,070,733.
