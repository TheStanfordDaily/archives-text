## 
### NAN CERINI 
Henry S. Bennett described the correspondence of the English
family of Poston as comparable to "opening a window on the past
and watching the people move unselfconsciously through their
daily life."
Bennett, Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge University,

spoke on "The Medieval English
Family" in the first Tuesday Eve
ning Series lecture of the quarter.
Bennett, an authority on English
literary and social history of the
late Middle Ages, described these
"unvarnished records of the fifteenth
century," now kept in the British
Museum. These private letters con
tain correspondence of men of all
classes and, according to Bennett,
make them seem "not shadowy his
torical personages but men and
women with emotions as keen as our
own."
In political history, the corre
spondence shows the effect of the
Wars of the Roses on individual
families, when threatened by force
and having to use it to protect their
own property in a troubled time.
The unique value of the corre
pondence is "the light it throws on
details of everyday life, so difficult
to track down just because they are
so commonplace," Bennett said. For
example, in the important realm of
marriage there is a frankness as to
how matches are made, and an ever
present financial assessment of the
worth and market value of potential
pouses.
Other details of medieval life
how the cares and arrangements of
the medieval housewife, as she or
dered clothes and food from London.
Manorial agricultural affairs were
also depicted.
The relationships of the members
of the household were described by
Bennett. The father was always rec
ognized as the head of the house
hold, and subservience to parents
demanded; rebellion was sternly
dealt with, and corporal punishment
was Ã¼biquitous.
