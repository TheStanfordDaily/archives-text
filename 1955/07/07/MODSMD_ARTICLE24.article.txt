# At the Lagunita Open House
## 
### 
HAVE SOME PUNCH?â€”Lag residents stopped by at the punch bowl during their open house
Saturday. They and their many guests participated in an evening of dancing, roasting marsh
mallows in the fire, card games, singing, and watching television. Officers termed the party a
success.
