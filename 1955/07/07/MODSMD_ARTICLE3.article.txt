# U.S. Government Continues Plans For VA Hospital
## 
### 
One more step has been taken to
ward the construction of a $20 mil
lion Veterans Administration hospi
tal on campus lands.
Federal Judge Edward P. Murphy
signed an order directing the U.S.
government to pay $525,193 to Stan
ford trustees for 87.5 acres of land.
The next step is expected to be the
announcement from Washington of
the selection of an architect for the
project.
The action culminated a condem
nation suit required because Stan
ford trustees cannot sell the Uni
versity's deeded land and the VA
cannot build on any but federally
owned property.
