# Clarification to Honor Code Made Last Year
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
The Honor Code is an undertaking of the students, individually and
collectively:
(1) that they will do their share and take an active part in seeing
to it that others as well as themselves uphold the spirit and letter of the
Honor Code;
(2) that they will not give or receive aid in examinations; that they
will not give or receive unpermitted aid in classwork, in the preparation
of reports, or in any other work that is to be used by the instructor as
the basis of grading.
The faculty on its part manifests its confidence in the honor of its
students by refraining from proctcring examinations or otherwi e taking
special steps to prevent the forms of dishone ty mentioned above.
Provided that alternate seats are available, tests will only be taken
from the classroom with the con ent of the in tructor.
The students and the faculty will work together to establish those
conditions under which optimum academic performance can be achieved.

The Stanford Honor Code, enacted in 1921 as a privilege given
to the students by the faculty, has undergone several studies
and reinterpretations during its 34-year existence to improve its
effectiveness.
Foremost among these clarifications was that made last year

by the ASSU Excom specifying that
"providing adequate seating is avail
able, examinations will be taken
from the classroom only with the
consent of the instructor."
The student himself is free to
leave the exam room at any time,
but may remove his examination
only if given permission by the in
structor or if alternate seating is
not provided.
Professors are asked to remain
available to students for 10 minutes
after the beginning of the period and
to inform the students of their
whereabouts for the continuation of
the period.
Although for several years stu
dents have assumed that it is their
unquestionable right to take exams
wherever they wish, the Code has
never stipulated such a privilege. It
merely provic ed that alternate seat
ing or an alternate set of tests be
provided for all examinations.
To further confuse the issue, in
1945 the Honor Code Committee
published an orientation pamphlet
containing the boast that Stanford
students could take their exams
wherever they wished.
This statement was adopted un
questioningly as fact by the major
ity of Stanford students and the
problem was brought to the atten
tion of the students by the ASSU
Executive Committee five times in
recent years, but with no success
until last year.
The work done last year by the
special Honor Code Committee and
finally voted on and approved by
Excom is not considered to be an
amendment, but merely a clarifica
tion of a misunderstanding of the
Code itself.
