# Stanford Has Colorful But Tragic Background
## 
### ANN FITZGERALD 
During the fall of 1884, the American tourist in Europe might
have remarked on the presence of a noted Californian, his wife
and 15-year-old son, in Paris, Athens, and Constantinople.
The noted Californian was Leland Stanford, Sr.
He came to California in 1852, not to join the gold-miners in

the fabulous Mother Lode, but to
make his fortune by supplying the
miners with tools and food.
The strong, powerful man rapidly
became a leading figure in state
politics. With men like Mark Hop
kins, Collis P. Huntington, and E. B.
Crocker, Stanford organized the Re
publican party, which supported
Lincoln in the presidential election,
and elected Leland Stanford gover
nor of the state in 1861.
The~e same young men, enthusi
astic about the "radical" idea of a
transcontinental railroad, were the
founders of the Central Pacific. This
was the road, built east from San
Franci-co, that met the tracks of the
Union Pacific near Ogden, Utah, in
1869. The last, the Golden Spike,
which joined the two roads was
driven by Governor Stanford.
Leland Stanford was a wealthy
man, respected, even loved, by the
people of his adopted state. When,
after 18 years of marriage, Jane La
throp Stanford presented him with
a son, Stanford's main interest be
came the education and development
of Leland Stanford, Junior.
Young Leland's education was the
motive for the trip to Europe. While
the boy had all the interests normal
to his age, he was also precocious in
his attention to museums, the fine
arts, and natural history. Letters
from those who met him mention
his social ea r e, his interesting con
versation, and (this being the Vic
torian era), his graceful manners.
However, the European journey,

begun so happily, was to be the
setting for the Stanfords' great trag
edy. During the trip, Leland Stan
ford, Jr., contracted typhoid fever
and died in Florence, just two
months before his sixteenth birth
day.
Even before their son's death, Mr.
and Mrs. Stanford had been plan
ning to use some of their great
wealth to benefit the citizens of Cal
ifornia. Yet, for a while, life ap
peared purposeless to them. When
the time of stunning grief had
passed, the Stanfords decided, "The
children of California shall be our
children."
This mass adoption began in the
fall of 1891, when David Starr Jor
dan, as president, welcomed more
than 400 students to Leland Stanford
Jr. University. Since then, the Uni
versity has served as a living trib
ute, not only to the boy for whom
it was named, but to the father who
was active in the public welfare
until his death in 1893, shortly after
beginning his second term in the
U.S. Senate.

wealth to benefit the citizens of Cal
ifornia. Yet, for a while, life ap
peared purposeless to them. When
the time of stunning grief had
passed, the Stanfords decided, "The
children of California shall be our
children."
This mass adoption began in the
fall of 1891, when David Starr Jor
dan, as president, welcomed more
than 400 students to Leland Stanford
Jr. University. Since then, the Uni
versity has served as a living trib
ute, not only to the boy for whom
it was named, but to the father who
was active in the public welfare
until his death in 1893, shortly after
beginning his second term in the
U.S. Senate.


THE STANFORD FAMILY
During the fall of 1884, the American tourist in Europe might
have remarked on the presence of a noted Californian, his wife
and 15-year-old son, in Paris, Athens, and Constantinople.
The noted Californian was Leland Stanford, Sr.
He came to California in 1852, not to join the gold-miners in

the fabulous Mother Lode, but to
make his fortune by supplying the
miners with tools and food.
The strong, powerful man rapidly
became a leading figure in state
politics. With men like Mark Hop
kins, Collis P. Huntington, and E. B.
Crocker, Stanford organized the Re
publican party, which supported
Lincoln in the presidential election,
and elected Leland Stanford gover
nor of the state in 1861.
The~e same young men, enthusi
astic about the "radical" idea of a
transcontinental railroad, were the
founders of the Central Pacific. This
was the road, built east from San
Franci-co, that met the tracks of the
Union Pacific near Ogden, Utah, in
1869. The last, the Golden Spike,
which joined the two roads was
driven by Governor Stanford.
Leland Stanford was a wealthy
man, respected, even loved, by the
people of his adopted state. When,
after 18 years of marriage, Jane La
throp Stanford presented him with
a son, Stanford's main interest be
came the education and development
of Leland Stanford, Junior.
Young Leland's education was the
motive for the trip to Europe. While
the boy had all the interests normal
to his age, he was also precocious in
his attention to museums, the fine
arts, and natural history. Letters
from those who met him mention
his social ea r e, his interesting con
versation, and (this being the Vic
torian era), his graceful manners.
However, the European journey,

begun so happily, was to be the
setting for the Stanfords' great trag
edy. During the trip, Leland Stan
ford, Jr., contracted typhoid fever
and died in Florence, just two
months before his sixteenth birth
day.
Even before their son's death, Mr.
and Mrs. Stanford had been plan
ning to use some of their great
wealth to benefit the citizens of Cal
ifornia. Yet, for a while, life ap
peared purposeless to them. When
the time of stunning grief had
