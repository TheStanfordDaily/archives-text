# Burma's U Nu Visits Campus—'No Comment'
## 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
Burma's Prime Minister U Nu, wearing a broad smile, the native
dress of his country, and a tie-clasp from Agriculture Secretary
Benson, came to Stanford last Thursday.
Nearing the end of his four-week good-will tour of the United
States, the leader of one of Asia's foremost "neutralist" nations

spent about an hour and a half on
his visit to Stanford and Hoover
Library.
His warm smile and cheerful man
ner charmed members of the fac
ulty and administration, but a terse
"no quotes" frustrated local news
paper reporters intent on hearing
his views.
It appeared that the real purpose
of his visit here was for a confer
ence with officials from the Stanford
Research Institute, a conference
which consumed almost half of his
stay on campus.
SRI OFFICIALS
After a brief inspection of the
view from Hoover Tower, a look at
a Library display on Burma, and an
introduction to reception guests, the
stocky chief-of-state went into a
corner with SRI Director Jesse Hob
son and Weldon Gibson, SRl's di
rector of economic adn internaitonal
research.
Their discussion, joined occasion
ally by other top Burmese and Stan
ford officials, was conducted in a se
rious mood of intense facial expres
sions and frequent animated gestur
ing.
But it was anybody's guess what
the Prime Minister and the SRI of
ficials talked about during theii
conference. While it was in prog
ress, reporters and other guests were
restricted to the cookie and punch
bowl area of the main lobby.
All of the Prime Minister's party
including U.S. security and protoco
officials, seemed intent on keepinp
what was said during his visit out oi
local newspapers.
"NOT QUOTABLE"
Even the Premier's "Oh's" and
"Ah's" over the view from Hoover
Tower were, officially, "not quot
able."
The Burma leader's comments
were reserved, apparently, for a
speech delivered in San Francisco
on Thursday night and a City press
conference on Friday. On both oc
casions, he criticized the "mood of
distrust" existing between nations
today and called for a more "com
promising attitude" on the interna
tional scene.
But some curious observers were
critical even of these public utter
ances as being "diplomatic" but un
sub tantial expressions of U Nu'. ;
opinions and policies. He has been
known to be outspoken in his friend
ship with India's Pandit Nehru, hi
acceptance of the "sincerity" of Red
China's "peaceful intentions," and
his criticism of such American
sponsored defense blocs as SEATO
"GOOD-WILL"
But at Stanford, the Burmese Pre
mier confined his comments to pure
ly "good-will" statements.
At the reception given in his hon
or, U Nu spoke at length to George
Kerr, head of the Hoover Institute

Overseas Development Program,
vhich recently concluded a seminar
ittended by Burmese students stud
/ing in this country.
The two men discussed the prog
ress of the students in their training
lere, and the Prime Minister tenta
tively suggested the possibility of
ending a high-ranking Burmese of-
Icial or educator to Stanford for the
iext session of the Institute's Over
eas Development Program.
RECEPTION
Before his lengthy conference with
SRI officials, the Premier greeted
members of the University staff
A'ho had been invited to the recep
tion. He was introduced to each of
the 30 or more guests by his official
campus host and guide, University
President J. E. Wallace Sterling.
Occasionally the chubby-faced U
Nu appeared tired from the effects
of a grueling tour that has carried
him around the globe. But at each
ntroduction, his face would bright
en and he would speak enthusiasti
cally for several moments.
Emerging from his talk with SRI
directors, the Premier bid goodbye
by shaking hands with those guests
-vho still remained at the reception.
His party, which included the
3urmese ambassador to the United
States, a staff of top aides and secre
taries, Burmese and American se
:urity and protocol officers, and
vriters and photographers of the
Jnited States Information Agency,
vhen departed.
They left the campus as they had
irrived—in a line of black Cadil
acs paced by two police motorcycle
>nd heralded by two screaming si
rens.

view from Hoover Tower, a look at
a Library display on Burma, and an
introduction to reception guests, the
stocky chief-of-state went into a
corner with SRI Director Jesse Hob
son and Weldon Gibson, SRl's di
rector of economic adn internaitonal
research.
Their discussion, joined occasion
ally by other top Burmese and Stan
ford officials, was conducted in a se
rious mood of intense facial expres
sions and frequent animated gestur
ing.
But it was anybody's guess what
the Prime Minister and the SRI of
ficials talked about during theii
conference. While it was in prog
ress, reporters and other guests were
restricted to the cookie and punch
bowl area of the main lobby.
All of the Prime Minister's party
including U.S. security and protoco
officials, seemed intent on keepinp
what was said during his visit out oi
local newspapers.
"NOT QUOTABLE"
Even the Premier's "Oh's" and
"Ah's" over the view from Hoover
Tower were, officially, "not quot
able."
The Burma leader's comments
were reserved, apparently, for a
speech delivered in San Francisco
on Thursday night and a City press
conference on Friday. On both oc
casions, he criticized the "mood of
distrust" existing between nations
today and called for a more "com
promising attitude" on the interna
tional scene.
But some curious observers were
critical even of these public utter
ances as being "diplomatic" but un
sub tantial expressions of U Nu'. ;
opinions and policies. He has been
known to be outspoken in his friend
ship with India's Pandit Nehru, hi
acceptance of the "sincerity" of Red
China's "peaceful intentions," and
his criticism of such American
sponsored defense blocs as SEATO
"GOOD-WILL"
But at Stanford, the Burmese Pre
mier confined his comments to pure
ly "good-will" statements.
At the reception given in his hon
or, U Nu spoke at length to George
Kerr, head of the Hoover Institute

Overseas Development Program,
vhich recently concluded a seminar
ittended by Burmese students stud
/ing in this country.
The two men discussed the prog
ress of the students in their training
lere, and the Prime Minister tenta
tively suggested the possibility of
ending a high-ranking Burmese of-
Icial or educator to Stanford for the
iext session of the Institute's Over
eas Development Program.
RECEPTION
Before his lengthy conference with
SRI officials, the Premier greeted
members of the University staff
A'ho had been invited to the recep
tion. He was introduced to each of
the 30 or more guests by his official
campus host and guide, University
President J. E. Wallace Sterling.
Occasionally the chubby-faced U
Nu appeared tired from the effects
of a grueling tour that has carried
him around the globe. But at each
ntroduction, his face would bright
en and he would speak enthusiasti
cally for several moments.
Emerging from his talk with SRI
directors, the Premier bid goodbye
by shaking hands with those guests
-vho still remained at the reception.
His party, which included the
3urmese ambassador to the United
States, a staff of top aides and secre
taries, Burmese and American se
:urity and protocol officers, and
vriters and photographers of the
Jnited States Information Agency,
vhen departed.
They left the campus as they had
irrived—in a line of black Cadil
acs paced by two police motorcycle
>nd heralded by two screaming si
rens.


U NU

Burma's Prime Minister U Nu, wearing a broad smile, the native

Nearing the end of his four-week good-will tour of the United

his visit to Stanford and Hoover

His warm smile and cheerful man
ner charmed members of the fac
ulty and administration, but a terse
"no quotes" frustrated local news
paper reporters intent on hearing
his views.
It appeared that the real purpose
of his visit here was for a confer

what was said during his visit out oi
local newspapers.
"NOT QUOTABLE"
Even the Premier's "Oh's" and
"Ah's" over the view from Hoover
Tower were, officially, "not quot
able."
The Burma leader's comments
were reserved, apparently, for a
speech delivered in San Francisco
on Thursday night and a City press
conference on Friday. On both oc
casions, he criticized the "mood of
distrust" existing between nations
today and called for a more "com
promising attitude" on the interna
tional scene.
But some curious observers were
critical even of these public utter
ances as being "diplomatic" but un
sub tantial expressions of U Nu'. ;
opinions and policies. He has been
known to be outspoken in his friend
ship with India's Pandit Nehru, hi
acceptance of the "sincerity" of Red
China's "peaceful intentions," and
his criticism of such American
sponsored defense blocs as SEATO
"GOOD-WILL"
But at Stanford, the Burmese Pre
mier confined his comments to pure
ly "good-will" statements.
At the reception given in his hon
or, U Nu spoke at length to George
Kerr, head of the Hoover Institute

Overseas Development Program,
vhich recently concluded a seminar
ittended by Burmese students stud
/ing in this country.
The two men discussed the prog
ress of the students in their training
lere, and the Prime Minister tenta
tively suggested the possibility of
ending a high-ranking Burmese of-
Icial or educator to Stanford for the
iext session of the Institute's Over
eas Development Program.
RECEPTION
Before his lengthy conference with
SRI officials, the Premier greeted
members of the University staff
A'ho had been invited to the recep
tion. He was introduced to each of
the 30 or more guests by his official
campus host and guide, University
President J. E. Wallace Sterling.
Occasionally the chubby-faced U
Nu appeared tired from the effects
of a grueling tour that has carried
him around the globe. But at each
ntroduction, his face would bright
en and he would speak enthusiasti
cally for several moments.
Emerging from his talk with SRI
directors, the Premier bid goodbye
by shaking hands with those guests
-vho still remained at the reception.
His party, which included the
3urmese ambassador to the United
States, a staff of top aides and secre
taries, Burmese and American se
:urity and protocol officers, and
vriters and photographers of the
Jnited States Information Agency,
vhen departed.
They left the campus as they had
irrived—in a line of black Cadil
acs paced by two police motorcycle
>nd heralded by two screaming si
rens.
