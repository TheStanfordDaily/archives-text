# Bio Building Raises Roof
## 
### 
UPON THE HOUSETOPâ€”Workers of the Corporation Yard are
completing the re-roofing of Jordan Hall, the biology building.
Now professors in the upper stories may work uninterrupted by
rain drops during their studies. Similar needed repairs are in
progress for the Mechanical Engineering laboratory. A floor in
one of the physics rooms was revived with new timber, and
another of the Mem Church windows was cleaned. So the Corp
Yard works on.
