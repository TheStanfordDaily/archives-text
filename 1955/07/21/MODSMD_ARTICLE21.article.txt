# Freidel Hails European Outlook as 'Optimistic'
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
"A vigorous, self-confident, forward-looking youth" was the fac
tor that most impressed history professor Frank Freidel in his
recent trip to Europe and his four-week stay at the Salzburg Semi
nar in American Studies.
The young professor added in a Weekly interview that the gen-

eral attitude permeating Europe
was "not at all defeatist, but rather
optimistic."
The Salzburg Seminar, where Dr.
Freidel lectured and seminared on
Lhe "New Deal," is a privately spon
ored institution for the study of
American civilization, with over 300
students from 13 countries of West
ern Europe.
NON-PROFIT BODY
Its faculty representing specialists
from every field of American cul
ture, the Seminar runs on a non
profit basis with financial support
coming mainly from private dona
tions, annual contributions, and ed
ucational foundations.
Although empha izing that this
was his first trip to Europe and
.hat he had no comparison to judge

by, Dr. Freidel said that he was
"rather struck by the extreme signs
of prosperity, especially apparent in
the numbers of cars and motorbikes
on the roads."
OPTIMISM
He also stressed the fact that he
was dealing most of the time with
the 54 Europeans in his seminar,
most of whom were intellectual
Christian Democrats and decidedly
pro - United States, and that his
judgment of the satisfaction and
pro-American nature of the Euro
pean attitu e in general might be
colored by this.
Among the group that he was
working with, he sensed a feeling,
idealistically speaking, against Ger
man rearmament, one of the top is
sues of the day in Europe, but prac
tically speaking, reflecting a realiza
tion of its necessity.
FDR
In his discussions of the New Deal
at Salzburg, Dr. Freidel found that
the "political efforts in the United
States to repudiate Franklin D.
Roosevelt have been reflected in
Europe and are effective anti-U.S.
propaganda since most Europeans
associate Roosevelt and American
efforts in World War 11.
In the fall, Freidel will take up a
one - year appointment at Oxford
University before assuming a posi
tion at Harvard as professor of his
tory.
