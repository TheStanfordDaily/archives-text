# STANFORD HISTORY
## Farm Was Beset by Variety of Problems 
### ANN FITZGERALD 
A red paint job splashed on the makeshift post office was the
joyous tribute given by Stanford students to an 1893 Supreme
Court decision freeing the depression-rocked university from a
$15 million Federal claim.
The rollicking students had been told by President Jordan that

they could celebrate in any way ex
cept to "tear down the buildings or
paint the professors."
Such financial difficulties were
only a few of the many problems
faced by the struggling young Uni
versity—problems that were height
ened by Leland Stanford's death
only two years after the University's
founding.
The infant University had received
much adverse publicity. It was, for
example, criticized in many quar
ters out of fear that the University
of California would suffer from the
"competition." However, after the
first six hard years were past, the
future of Stanford University ap
peared secure.
Construction of new buildings
went rapidly, though many were
entirely destroyed in the earthquake
of 1906.
And Stanford was making a name
for itself in athletics, as well as in
academic pursuits.
The Stanford men were decided
underdogs when they won the first
"Big Game" with Cal, in 1892 in San
Francisco, but the tradition of the
"Axe" did not originate until a base
ball game in 1899. The Axe was not
until then an especially sacred sym
bol, but some roughnecks from Ber
keley stole it after the game, and
the war was on.
The University was attracting
ever - increasing numbers of stu
dents. By the fourth year, over a
thousand men and women were en
rolled; twice that number registered
in 1915.
Fearful that the women students
might one day outnumber the men,
Mrs. Stanford amended the Charter
to limit the number of women to
500, a rule in effect until 1933.
Year by year the University grew
in prestige, in size, and in the loy
alty of "the children of California,"
a growth which has not ceased as
the sound of tractors and pounding
hammers attests.
