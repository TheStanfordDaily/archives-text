WINDS OF FREEDOM BLOWâ€”A gift to the University from
the Class of '58, the first flagpole to be erected at Stanford since
1902, is shown taking its place on the lawn in front of the Main
Library. The 50-foot flagpole, which has gone through various
stages of construction this quarter, was raised last Friday and
the first flag on Tuesday, although the dedication will not take
place until fall quarter. The campus police will administer the
raising and lowering of the flag each day.
