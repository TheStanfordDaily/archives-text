of the Institute, will lead a round
table on "Can the Teaching of
American History Be Made More
Meaningful by Emphasis on the In
dividual?"
In the concluding session Saturday
afternoon a panel, led by Thomas A.
Bailey, director of the Institute, will
take up "The Role of Literature and
the Arts in American History."
