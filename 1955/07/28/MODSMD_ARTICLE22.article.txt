# Art Gallery To Exhibit Slinkard Works
## 
### 
An exhibition of drawings, water
colors, preliminary studies, and oil
paintings by Rex Slinkard opened
yesterday at the Stanford Art Gal
lery. This collection was bequeathed
to Stanford by the late Florence A.
Williams of Los Angeles, with $30,-
000 to maintain the collection and
provide for its periodic exhibition.
Slinkard, a Western rancher,
painter, and poet who died in 1918
while serving in the army, was called
by the modernist Marsden Hartley
"a lyi'ical painter of the first order."
His work has been exhibited pre
viously at the Knoedler Galleries in
New York, the Los Angeles Mu
seum, and the De Young Museum
in San Francisco.
Also on display at the Ai-t Gallery
will be water colors of California
scenes, done by Leslie Kiler. Kiler,
a Stanford graduate, was a land
scape architect. He now makes his
home in Santa Barbara.
Pages from "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" as designed and printed by
Dorothy Stewart, scheduled to be
displayed now, will not be shown
because of lack of space.
Art Gallery hours are 10 a.m. to
5 p.m. week days except Monday,
and noon to 4 p.m. on Sunday. The
present exhibition will remain open
through Aug. 28.
