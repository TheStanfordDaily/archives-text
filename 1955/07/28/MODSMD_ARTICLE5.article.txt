# 'Finland' to Be Series Topic
## 
### 
"Finland Between East and
West" will be the subject of the
Tuesday Evening Series lecture
of Professor Anatole G. Mazour
of the History Department Tues
day at 8 p.m. in Memorial Audi
torium.
Professor Mazour returned this
spring from a five months' stay in
Finland, where he collected material
for a new book. He found the Fin
nish people predominantly pro-
American. "But," he stated, "the
United States is far across the water
and the Russians are at their door
step."
The historian came to America
from Russia in 1923 after serving
with the Russian army during the
first World War and the civil wars.
He is the author of "Russia, Past
and Present," an analysis of Russian
culture and the forces which have
shaped the modern Red state.
Before joining the Stanford fac
ulty in 1947, Professor Mazour
taught at the universities of Nevada,
California, Wyoming, and Oregon,
and at Miami University and the
University of Chicago. He is a grad
uate of the University of Nebraska
and holds an A.M. degree from Yale
and a Ph.D. in history from the Uni
versity of California.
The lecture, sponsored by the
Committee on Public Exercises, will
be open to the public without
charge.
