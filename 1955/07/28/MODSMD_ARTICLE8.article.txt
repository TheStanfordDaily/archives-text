# Dean Terman Appointed New University Provost
## 
### 
Frederick E. Terman, Dean of the School of Engineering, has
been appointed provost of the University, President Wallace
Sterling announced last week.
Dr. Terman, an international authority in electronics, will fill
the position of Douglas M. Whitaker, provost since 1952, who

recently resigned to become a vice- -
president of the Rockefeller Insti
tute for Medical Research in New
York.
Beginning Sept. 1, Dr. Terman
will take over Dr. Whitaker's posi
tion and will, at the same time, con
tinue as engineering dean. He has
been a faculty member for 30 years.
He was graduated in 1920 and took
an engineering degree in electrical
engineering from Stanford before
going to MIT where he received a
Doctor of Science degree under
Vannevar Bush in 1925.
On returning to Stanford, Dr. Ter
man was appointed instructor in
electrical engineering. In 1927 he
became a full professor and head of
the Electrical Engineering Depart
ment and in 1945 was appointed dean
of the School of Engineering.
HARVARD RESEARCH
During World War 11, Dean Ter
man, on leave from Stanford, headed
the Office of Scientific Research and
Development's Radio Research Lab
oratory at Harvard University.
There he headed a staff of 800 re
searchers who comprised the chief
United States agency for the devel
opment of radar countermeasures.
In recognition for his work, he re
ceived decorations from the British
government in 194G and the United
States' highest civilian award, the
Medal of Merit, in 1948.
Following the war, Dr. Terman
returned with a nucleus of his young
electrical engineers to staff the new
Research Laboratory and Radio
Propagation Laboratory which had
been established in the School of
Engineering.
Since the war Stanford, under Dr.
Terman's leadership, has become
one of the nation's foremost schools
for the study of electrical engineer
ing. Partly because of this, the San
Francisco Peninsula has become one
of the major electronics industrial
centers in the United States.
Dean Terman has also developed
the school's civil and mechanical en
gineering departments to meet the
heavy postwar demand for engi
neers and a Department of Indus
trial Engineering is being formed.
ACADEMY OF SCIENCES
Dr. Terman was elected to the Na
tional Academy of Sciences in 1946,
this group being considered the most
select in American science. He has
been awarded honorary doctoral de
grees by both Harvard and the Uni
versity of British Columbia.
He is the author of five books
which are best sellers in the field.

They have been published in nine
foreign editions. In 1941 he was
elected president of the Institute of
Radio Engineers, an organization of
some 30,000 members. He was the
first president of the organization to
break its "East Coast" precedent.
The Institute awarded him its Medal
of Honor in 1950.
Dean Terman's father, Dr. Lewis
M. Terman, professor emeritus of
psychology and education, has
worked extensively with the Stan
ford-Binet intelligence tests.
