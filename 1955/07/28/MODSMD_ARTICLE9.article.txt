# Terman Tells Provost Duties
## 
### RIC TEAGUE 
Last week, Dr. Frederick E. Ter
man was appointed provost of the
University, climaxing his 30th year
as a faculty member: instructor,
professor, and, since 1945, Dean of
the School of Engineering.
Dean Terman himself is not com
pletely certain just what his duties
as provost will be. He said that he
will have to wait until he takes over
the position from Douglas M. Whit
aker on Sept. 1 to see exactly what
the position will entail.
"It concerns itself with internal
operations between the President's
Office and the deans, department
heads, and faculty members," ac
cording to Dr. Terman. The provost
deals directly with the faculty, ex
cept for the schools of law, business,
and medicine.
The position of provost is involved
with budgets, appointments, pro
grams, and other administrative and
academic functions. The new pro
vost feels that, in addition to the
routine work of the office, there will
be many special problems that will
be handled at that level.
In addition, the provost is, in ef
fect, a "vice-president." He is the
second ranking administrative offi
cer of the University, with respon
sibility principally in academic af
fairs. He acts for the president
when the president is absent from
the campus.
Dr. Terman will stay on as Dean
of the School of Engineering after he
assumes the position of provost. He
will, however, delegate certain of
the functions of that job that are,
by their routine nature, capable of
delegation.
