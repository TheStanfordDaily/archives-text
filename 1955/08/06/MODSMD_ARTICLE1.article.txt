# Ceremonies Herald Dorm Site Clearing
## 
### EDA MENDELS 
The groundbreaking for Flor
ence Moore Hall, new under
graduate women's dormitory,
took place Tuesday, in an infor
mal, Stanford-in-summer way.
Mrs. Robert S. Moore, whose gift
of $1 million made the long-awaited
dorm a possibility, sat in a garden
chair under a parasol, overlooking
the site in front of the Knoll where
the dorm will be erected. Standing
by were trustees, University admin
istrators and students, while dogs
and neighborhood children swarmed
about.
While the spectators stood in the
sweltering heat, President Sterling
presented Mrs. Moore with a shovel,
its blade inscribed with a memorial
message, the handle wrapped gaily
in red ribbon. "Its function now is
mainly symbolic," Sterling said.
"We will rely on a tractor to do
the main job.
He then handed Mrs. Moore a
neat red package. While a tractor
purred in the background, she
opened it and revealed a miniature
yellow tractor. With it came a little
gold plaque, also with a memorial
inscription.
Mrs. Moore looked pleased with
her gift, and the spectators came up
to examine it too, to chat with the
benefactress, and to pose for the
five photographers who squatted at
all sides. The children grabbed
their dogs out of the photographers'
way, then, when the formal picture
taking was over, clustered around

to get a close look at the tractor.
Then Mrs. Moore's chair was
turned to face the Knoll, and a
bulldozer ripped down the field in
the actual groundbreaking process.
A cloud of dust went in its wake.
The tractor operator, like Mrs.
Moore, was happily sheltered from
the blazing sun by a green garden
parasol.
A murmur went up from the on
lookers. "If the building proceeds
at this rate, it might be ready this
September." Actually, some 35 days
may be needed to prepare the site,
for 50,000 cubic yards of dirt will
be moved from the slooping field.
Plans for the dorm, which is
scheduled to be used in fall '56, in
clude seven separate wings for 50
women each. Every wing will have
its own dining room, lounge, kitch
enette, and patio, but all will be
centrally connected. Most of the
rooms will be doubles. •
Planning for the dorm has gone
at top speed since Mrs. Moore's gift
was announced at the end of March.
A student committee worked with
University officials, and in house
meetings all the women students
had a chance to offer their sugges
tions for the new building.
Milton T. Pfiueger, San Francisco
architect who is drawing up work
ing plans, was there to witness the
leveling of the site.
Trustees at the gathering were
Mrs. Allan E. Charles, Mrs. Robert
L. Lipman, Herman Phleger, Le
land W. Cutler, Ira S. Lillick, and
George Morell,
Undei'graduate women were rep
resented at the ceremony by Janet
Cline, summer AWS president;
Brenda Sorey, ASSU summer Ex
com member and freshman spon
sor; and Eda Mendels, Cap and
Gown member and Stanford Sum
mer Weekly editor.

The groundbreaking for Flor
ence Moore Hall, new under
graduate women's dormitory,
took place Tuesday, in an infor
mal, Stanford-in-summer way.
Mrs. Robert S. Moore, whose gift
of $1 million made the long-awaited
dorm a possibility, sat in a garden
chair under a parasol, overlooking
the site in front of the Knoll where
the dorm will be erected. Standing
by were trustees, University admin
istrators and students, while dogs
and neighborhood children swarmed
about.
While the spectators stood in the
sweltering heat, President Sterling
presented Mrs. Moore with a shovel,
its blade inscribed with a memorial
message, the handle wrapped gaily
in red ribbon. "Its function now is
mainly symbolic," Sterling said.
"We will rely on a tractor to do
the main job.
He then handed Mrs. Moore a
neat red package. While a tractor
purred in the background, she
opened it and revealed a miniature
yellow tractor. With it came a little
gold plaque, also with a memorial
inscription.
Mrs. Moore looked pleased with
her gift, and the spectators came up
to examine it too, to chat with the
benefactress, and to pose for the
five photographers who squatted at
all sides. The children grabbed
their dogs out of the photographers'
way, then, when the formal picture
taking was over, clustered around

to get a close look at the tractor.
Then Mrs. Moore's chair was
turned to face the Knoll, and a
bulldozer ripped down the field in
the actual groundbreaking process.
A cloud of dust went in its wake.
The tractor operator, like Mrs.
Moore, was happily sheltered from
the blazing sun by a green garden
parasol.
A murmur went up from the on
lookers. "If the building proceeds
at this rate, it might be ready this
September." Actually, some 35 days
may be needed to prepare the site,
for 50,000 cubic yards of dirt will
be moved from the slooping field.
Plans for the dorm, which is
scheduled to be used in fall '56, in
clude seven separate wings for 50
women each. Every wing will have
its own dining room, lounge, kitch
enette, and patio, but all will be
centrally connected. Most of the
rooms will be doubles. •
Planning for the dorm has gone
at top speed since Mrs. Moore's gift
was announced at the end of March.
A student committee worked with
University officials, and in house
meetings all the women students
had a chance to offer their sugges
tions for the new building.
Milton T. Pfiueger, San Francisco
architect who is drawing up work
ing plans, was there to witness the
leveling of the site.
