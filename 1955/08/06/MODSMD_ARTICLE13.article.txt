# 25th Anniversary For Sterlings
## 
### 
President and Mrs. Wallace
Sterling will celebrate their
twenty-fifth wedding anniversary
Sunday at their campus home.
They plan to observe the occa
sion with a party for their per
sonal friends Sunday afternoon.
The anniversary falls just one day
after Dr. Sterling's 49th birthday.
Dr. Sterling married the former
Ann Marie Shaver at a garden
ceremony at her father's farm,
Rosewood Farm, in Ancaster, On
tario, Canada, in 1930. That fall
he was football coach for the town
team of Calgary.
The Sterlings came to Stanford
for winter quarter of the 1930
school year, where Dr. Sterling
enrolled as a Ph.D. candidate in
history. After teaching positions
elsewhere, they returned to Stan
ford and have occupied the presi
dent's house on campus since
April 1949.
The Sterlings have three chil
dren, one son and two daughters.
The ASSU Excom has selected
the student body's gift for the
Sterlings, but declined to reveal
their choice to the Weekly, think
ing that the anniversary couple
might read about it.
