# Oregon to Honor Hoover's Birthday
## 
### 
Herbert Hoover, probably Stan
ford's most distinguished graduate,
will celebrate his 81st birthday next
Wednesday, Aug. 10, in the small
Oregon town of Newberg, where he
spent many of his early years until
he came to Stanford in 1891.
The former President will be a
guest in the same house where he,
lived as a boy from the time he was
10 years old until he became a
member of Stanford's first class.
That was when he was 16, shortly
after the death of his father.
The Governor of Oregon has
asked Mr. Hoover to take part in
the ceremonies honoring his birth
day, which will center around the
commemoration as a shine of the
houseâ€”a small cottage which has
been completely restored. In the
restoration of the little house, noth
ing has been overlooked. Even fur
niture of the type that was in the
house in the 1880's has been found
and restored.
Mr. Hoover's birthday address
will be broadcast over CBS radio
at 7:30 p.m. on Aug. 10. Following
his short stay in Newberg, he will
attempt to get in a Little fishing be
fore returning to the role of elder
statesman.
