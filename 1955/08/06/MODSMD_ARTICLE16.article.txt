# ESPRI to Focus On Philippines
## 
### 
The Philippines will be featured in
today's meeting of ESPRI (Educa
tional Society for the Promotion of
Relations Intercultural), to be held
in Room 57, Cubberley, at noon.
Professor Arthur Coladarci, who
was a paratrooper in the Philippines
during World War 11, will relate the
impressions he, an American, got of
the country at that time. Then Mrs.
Amparo Lardizabal, a native of the
Philippines, will give her views.
ESPRI is a new organization, or
ganized just last spring in the School
of Education. Its purposes are two
fold: to help orient students from all
over the world who are enrolled in
the Ed School, and to entertain the
many distinguished foreign visitors
who come to the Ed School.
Club officers feel that contacts
with the international students are
invaluable for education students,
who are likely to find students of
many national backgrounds in their
classes. Approximately 50 people
have taken advantage of these ses
sions in the past weeks.
