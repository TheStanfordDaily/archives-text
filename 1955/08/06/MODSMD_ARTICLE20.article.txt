# Mazour Gives Picture of Finland Past and Present
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Delicately balanced on the tightrope between East and West,
Finland has reached a fairly stable position in the past few years
despite wartime destruction and turmoil.
Dr. Anatole G. Mazour of the history department, recently re
turned from a visit to Finland, reflected this slightly optimistic

view before this week's Tuesday
Series audience, and went on to
say that the Finns have exhibited
"great skill, poise, and diligence in
pulling themselves through post
war problems."
Finland, Dr. Mazour warned, with
its foundation laid primarily on a
peacetime economy, depends large
ly on events entirely beyond the
power of the Finnish people for
the continuation of their new secu
rity and prosperity.
ACCESSIBLE MARKETS
The nation is now searching for
accessible markets in the "free
world," Dr. Mazour said, but if she
fails in this search and other na
tions will not buy from her or erect
impossible tariff barriers, she may
be driven in desperation to trade
with her eastern neighbor.
She will be faced with economic
catastrophe—an open door to Com
munism, and the Soviet Union may
be expected to come "with enticing
offers."
Straddled between the forces of
East and West, Finland has pursued
a policy of strict coexistence, striv
ing to remain in a neutral Scandi
navian bloc free from the vicissi
tudes of European politics. Dr. Ma
zour added that coexistence means
to the Finns "national existence and
survival."
Partly buoyed up by a "surprising
economic boom" in the past few
years, Finland has been partially
able to solve the legacy of prob
lems that faced the war-wearied
people at the end of the war.
WAR LOSSES
Among these were the loss of
manpower, territory, and capital,
economic damage from which the
country has significantly recovered,
the overbearing treaty obligations
and reparations which were finally
liquidated in 1952, and severe refu
gee and resettlement problems.
With an eye to the 443,000 reset
tled refugees in western Finland,
Dr. Mazour sees a latent economic
problem in the possible necessity of
subsidization for the thousands of
resettled farmers.
The Stanford professor, who was
born in Russia and served in the
counter-revolutionary forces during
the Russian Revolution, recalled the
history of the Finnish people, whom
he hailed as "the shock absorbers of
the ebbs and flows of military forces
across Europe" for many centuries.
The policy of peaceful coexistence
'having deteriorated during the 30's,
Finland was led by a few of her
leaders into co-belligerency with
Germany, "not so much from wick
edness, but rather a lack of fore
sight," Dr. Mazour advanced.
PANDORAS BOX
"This," Dr. Mazour stated,
"opened a Pandora's box for Fin
land." . The impression was made,
despite Finland's efforts, that the
country was engulfed in the entire
scheme of Hitler's expansion. The
"scorched earth" policy of the re
treating German army at the end
of the war was the unhappy price
paid for co-belligerency with Ger
many, he said.

Series audience, and went on to
say that the Finns have exhibited
"great skill, poise, and diligence in
pulling themselves through post
war problems."
Finland, Dr. Mazour warned, with
its foundation laid primarily on a
peacetime economy, depends large
ly on events entirely beyond the
power of the Finnish people for
the continuation of their new secu
rity and prosperity.
ACCESSIBLE MARKETS
The nation is now searching for
accessible markets in the "free
world," Dr. Mazour said, but if she
fails in this search and other na
tions will not buy from her or erect
impossible tariff barriers, she may
be driven in desperation to trade
with her eastern neighbor.
She will be faced with economic
catastrophe—an open door to Com
munism, and the Soviet Union may
be expected to come "with enticing
offers."
Straddled between the forces of
East and West, Finland has pursued
a policy of strict coexistence, striv
ing to remain in a neutral Scandi
navian bloc free from the vicissi
tudes of European politics. Dr. Ma
zour added that coexistence means
to the Finns "national existence and
survival."
Partly buoyed up by a "surprising
economic boom" in the past few
years, Finland has been partially
able to solve the legacy of prob
lems that faced the war-wearied
people at the end of the war.
WAR LOSSES
Among these were the loss of
manpower, territory, and capital,
economic damage from which the
country has significantly recovered,
the overbearing treaty obligations
and reparations which were finally
liquidated in 1952, and severe refu
gee and resettlement problems.
With an eye to the 443,000 reset
tled refugees in western Finland,
Dr. Mazour sees a latent economic
problem in the possible necessity of
subsidization for the thousands of
resettled farmers.
The Stanford professor, who was
born in Russia and served in the
counter-revolutionary forces during
the Russian Revolution, recalled the
history of the Finnish people, whom
he hailed as "the shock absorbers of
the ebbs and flows of military forces
across Europe" for many centuries.
The policy of peaceful coexistence
'having deteriorated during the 30's,
Finland was led by a few of her
leaders into co-belligerency with
Germany, "not so much from wick
edness, but rather a lack of fore
sight," Dr. Mazour advanced.
PANDORAS BOX
"This," Dr. Mazour stated,
"opened a Pandora's box for Fin
land." . The impression was made,
despite Finland's efforts, that the
country was engulfed in the entire
scheme of Hitler's expansion. The
"scorched earth" policy of the re
treating German army at the end
of the war was the unhappy price
paid for co-belligerency with Ger
many, he said.
Delicately balanced on the tightrope between East and West,
Finland has reached a fairly stable position in the past few years
despite wartime destruction and turmoil.
Dr. Anatole G. Mazour of the history department, recently re
turned from a visit to Finland, reflected this slightly optimistic

view before this week's Tuesday
Series audience, and went on to
say that the Finns have exhibited
"great skill, poise, and diligence in
