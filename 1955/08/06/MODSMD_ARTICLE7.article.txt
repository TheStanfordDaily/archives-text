# 'Camino Real' Opens Three-Day Run In Memorial Auditorium Tonight
## Williams' Drama Called 'Disturbing' 
### JAE HUNLEY 
The New York critics agreed
with Tennessee Williams, when
he called his play "Camino
Real," disturbing. Stanford audi
ences may decide for them
selves when the Stanford Play
ers open their production of
"Camino" tonight at 8:15 in Me
morial Auditorium.
Douglas Watson heads the cast as
"Kilroy," the ex-champion fighter
with a heart of gold as "big as the
head of a baby." He is the repre
sentative of the modern era in his
travels along the royal road to
reality.
The play is loaded with a host
of other characters from history—
among them are Casanova, Lord
Byron, Don Quixote, and Margue
rite Gautier. These parts are played
by Ray Fry, Douglas Cook, Ross
Durfee, and Priscilla Oliver.

'Canterbury Tales" in modern
dres-. It is played in a series of 16
blocks along the Camino Real, with
one basic set, done almost in Pi

tan Woman," provide variety in the
stage setting. "Camino" is a show
of special effects with different
signs and types of lighting.

ESMERELDA (JOAN HUNT) AND KILROY (DOUGLAS
WATSON) IN A SCENE FROM "CAMINO REAL."
The New York critics agreed
with Tennessee Williams, when
he called his play "Camino
Real," disturbing. Stanford audi
ences may decide for them
selves when the Stanford Play
ers open their production of
"Camino" tonight at 8:15 in Me
morial Auditorium.
Douglas Watson heads the cast as
"Kilroy," the ex-champion fighter
with a heart of gold as "big as the
head of a baby." He is the repre
sentative of the modern era in his
travels along the royal road to
reality.
The play is loaded with a host
of other characters from history—
among them are Casanova, Lord
Byron, Don Quixote, and Margue
rite Gautier. These parts are played
by Ray Fry, Douglas Cook, Ross
Durfee, and Priscilla Oliver.
MODERN CANTERBURY TALES'
The play has been described as a
'Canterbury Tales" in modern
dres-. It is played in a series of 16
blocks along the Camino Real, with
one basic set, done almost in Pi
casso style.
Lighting changes, as in "The Cre
tan Woman," provide variety in the
stage setting. "Camino" is a show
of special effects with different
signs and types of lighting.
Costumes are styled in keeping
with the stage-character of the per
son wearing them. Different sound
effects add to the characterizations.
The cast of characters includes
Joan Hunt as Esmerelda, Bere
Boynton as the Gypsy, Ralph Mc-
Cormick as Gutman, and Nancy
Simms as Rosita.
Among the other cast members
are Glenn Dußose, Joel Rogosin,
John Benedict, Nancy Widdas, Hal
Burdick Jr., Bill Burke, David
O'Brien, and Hugo Melchione.
