# STANFORD PLAYERS
## Aristophanes' 'Lysistrata' To Be Given Next Week 
### 
"Lysistrata" might well be called Aristophanes' version of the
battle of the sexes.
The play, which will be presented on Aug. 18, 19, and 20 by the
Stanford Players as the last one in their summer series, concerns
what happens when the women of Greece decide to stop all love

in order to force their husbands to'
stop all war.
Marian Seldes is cast in the title
role of Lysistrata. She is the per
son who persuades the Grecian
women to accept the plan to halt
hostility among the Greek tribes.
Miss Seldes played the title role
of Phaedra in "The Cretan Woman"
earlier this summer. She is one of
Stanford's artists-in-residence. She
has been seen on Broadway in "On
dine," "Tower Beyond Tragedy,"
and "Medea" with Judith Ander
son.
Ross Durfee, who played Cyrano
in "Cyrano de Bergerac," will play
Lysistrata's husband, Lykon. Mar
cia Wilson will appear as Lampito,
the leader of the Spartan women,
who has, in her own words, "a good
seat —on a horse."
Asher Wilson, last seen as the
tragic king in "The Cretan Woman,"
will portray the farcical old senator
who tries to persuade Lysistrata
that she should abandon her plan,
because to stop war will hurt busi
ness.
Nancy Widdas will appear as
Myrrhine, the young woman who
sneaks away from the ladies' camp
to see her husband, Kinesius, played
by David O'Brien, only to repulse
his advances.
Others in the cast are Meyme
Curtis, Joel Rogosin, Flora Kirsch
ner, Edith Strickland, Saint Clair
Williams, Alice Middlekauff, Bere
Boynton, Carolyn Cowan, Ralph
McCormick, Ray Fray, John Bene
dict, Alix Berlin, John Masterson,
Glenn Dußose, Betty Janns, and
Marilyn Feller.
The show's director is Theodore
Marcuse, another Stanford artist
in-residence. He was the directoi
of "The Cretan Woman." Set de
signer is Jack Sollers and lights are
designed by Robert Levin. Irene
Griffin is in charge of the costumes
and Douglas Cook is the stage man
ager.
"Lysistrata" was written over
2,000 years ago, and it has been one
of the favorite Greek comedies ever
since. There have been many
translations of it done, but the one
that the Players will use is the one
by Gilbert Seldes, Miss Seldes' fa
ther.
The play was first presented on
Broadway in 1934. It ran there for
two years. Seldes' version was
written two years ago when the
Theater Guild planned to revive
the comedy in New York. Seldes
has allowed the Stanford Players to
use this version, which will include
a new prologue to be spoken by
Lysistrata.
Tickets for the play are on sale
at the Memorial Auditorium box
office between 12:30 and 4:30 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, for $1 or
$1.50. Curtain time each night, at
Memorial Auditorium, will be 8:15.

2,000 years ago, and it has been one

ther.
The play was first presented on
Broadway in 1934. It ran there for
two years. Seldes' version was
written two years ago when the
Theater Guild planned to revive
the comedy in New York. Seldes
has allowed the Stanford Players to
use this version, which will include
a new prologue to be spoken by
Lysistrata.
