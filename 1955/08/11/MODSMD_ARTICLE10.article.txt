# TOWARD FINANCIAL SECURITY
## Stanford Is Developing Land for Added Income 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
Stanford is a university.
But while its academic head may be groping toward the heights
of the universe for new ideas and truths, its physical feet are
being planted firmly beneath the ground.
For Stanford is also a business, by necessity rooted in a con-

tinual effort to keep itself finan
cially secure for the progressive
conduct of its higher purpose.
Thus it is more than an entity of
ideas, knowledge, and educational
tradition. It is also an organization
of men who must be paid, buildings
which must be maintained, and
equipment which must be pur
cha ed. It is a system of plumbing,
an ordered maze of wiring, and a
mountain of files, papers, and rec
ords.
The cost of those physical neces
sities, of Stanford "the business,"
has shot up in recent years along
with the general economic spiral of

In a recent meeting, Stanford's
Board of Trustees took two fur
ther steps to '"guarantee the rural
and secluded atmosphere of the
campus" under the land develop
ment program.
The trustees officially ruled that
the area reserved for the campus
he set at 3,820 acres, leaving about
5,(100 acres to be leased for com
mercial, industrial, and residen
tial use.

campus—the hilltops, ridges, and
skylines visible from in front of
the campus.

our society and time. In the past
ten years, the annual operating cost
of the University has approximately
tripled.
For a time, Stanford endeavored
to sustain itself on its traditional
"fixed" income of endowment, gifts,
and tuition.
But the widening gap between
expenditures and "fixed" income
led to what administration leaders
called the "financially tightest two
years in the history of, Stanford"
and a "dangerous pattern" of defi
cit budgeting.
Today the situation Is considered
brighter, because of efforts of Uni
versity officers to increase the
"fixed" income. This year, tuition
was increased ("reluctantly") from
$220 to $250 a quarter per student.
And through efforts of volunteer
alumni groups and the University's
General Secretary Office, gifts to
endowment and operating expenses
have skyrocketed. Last year, a total
of almost $5.5 million was donated
to Stanford, an increase of almost
$1.5 million over the record of the
previous year.
The realm which offers perhaps
the greatest potential for increasing
Stanford's income is, however, just
beginning to be cultivated.

That realm is the commercial de
velopment of the University's al
most 9,000 acres of property.
Already, parts of a master plan
for land development have mate
rialized. Students driving along
Palm Drive or El Camino Real can
witness the construction of a new
hopping center which will house
such concerns as the Emporium,
Roos Brothers, and Magnin's. Far
ther south on El Camino, they will
see already completed buildings for
such light industries as electronics
(Varian Associates) and photo pro
cessing (Eastman Kodak).
The master plan for the 5,000
acres calls for much more than
these apparently isolated achieve
ments.
That land is gradually—and care
fully—being leased out to private
organizations for three types of de
velopment: light industrial, com
mercial and business, and residen
tial.
Prospective residential develop
ment calls for the use of over 4,000
of the acres and induces perhaps
the most intriguing predictions for
the future of Stanford's property.
One University report indicates the
possibility of an eventual commu
nity of 32,000 people living in homes
on the now barren, rolling hills be
hind campus. Modern schools,
parks, and shopping centers will be
included.
Stanford's financial needs are not
the only reason for the development
of its land. Population studies have
warned of a tremendous need for
space on the Peninsula in the next
several decades. The Stanford prop
erty is considered by many to be
the last large area of land on the
Peninsula suitable for residential
development.
The announcements of Stanford's
plans have not met with universal
approval, however. There has been
some criticism of the program in
that it might end in the Stanford
area becoming a scene of "belching
mokestacks" and "cracker - box"
housing tracts.
Alf Brandin, University business
manager and chief officer for land
development, has said that the re
sults of the program will be "es
thetically, as well as commercially,
first-class."
The University has indicated that
it will preserve the "esthetic beau
ty" of the Stanford area in two
ways:
1. To keep the campus itself from
becoming a "tight little island" in
the shadows of shoppirui centers
and housing tracts, Stanford is
guaranteeing almost 4,000 acres for
the campus itself. According to the
University Planning Office, this

hould allow for "any possible ex
pansion" of the present 1,200-acre
campus.
2. The University has demanded
nnd will continue to demand an au
thority not only over the lease of
land, but over the architecture,
layout, and types of buildings which
vill be constructed. An indication
of the "high quality" demanded has
been seen in the 43 "distinctively
styled" homes in the first residen
tial tract completed, near the Menlo
Park boundary of Stanford land.
The legal barriers to the develop
ment of Stanford land have, of
courre, been overcome. The Uni
versity's Founding Grant, under
which the University is compelled
to operate, stipulates that none of
Stanford's 9,000 acres can be sold.
The Board of Trustees, however,
has maintained the right of the Uni
versity to "lease" its land. The gen
eral lease type which has been used
is for 99 years.
At the apparent rate of progress
of the land development program in
just a few years, it is likely that
full development will take consid
erably less than 99 years. Business
Manager Brandin estimates tenta
tivefy that in between 25 and 50
years, the 5,000 acres will be "fully
developed."
There is substance to such a pre
diction. Stanford needs the money,
the Peninsula needs the space, and
University leaders have shown a fa
cility and a mood to achieve the
proper arrangements.
That "mood" is best expressed by
a saying which appears to have be
come a favorite of University offi
cers in recent years:
"Stanford is on the move."
The "move" is careful and con
sidered, but it is by no means slow.
To guarantee the fulfillment of its
functions as a "university," Stan
ford is quickly attempting to meet
its needs as a "business."

possibility of an eventual commu
nity of 32,000 people living in homes
on the now barren, rolling hills be
hind campus. Modern schools,
parks, and shopping centers will be
included.
Stanford's financial needs are not
the only reason for the development
of its land. Population studies have
warned of a tremendous need for
space on the Peninsula in the next
several decades. The Stanford prop
erty is considered by many to be
the last large area of land on the
Peninsula suitable for residential
development.
The announcements of Stanford's
plans have not met with universal
approval, however. There has been
some criticism of the program in
that it might end in the Stanford
area becoming a scene of "belching
mokestacks" and "cracker - box"
housing tracts.
Alf Brandin, University business
manager and chief officer for land
development, has said that the re
sults of the program will be "es
thetically, as well as commercially,
first-class."
The University has indicated that
it will preserve the "esthetic beau
ty" of the Stanford area in two
ways:
1. To keep the campus itself from
becoming a "tight little island" in
the shadows of shoppirui centers
and housing tracts, Stanford is
guaranteeing almost 4,000 acres for
the campus itself. According to the
University Planning Office, this

hould allow for "any possible ex
pansion" of the present 1,200-acre
campus.
2. The University has demanded
nnd will continue to demand an au
thority not only over the lease of
land, but over the architecture,
layout, and types of buildings which
vill be constructed. An indication
of the "high quality" demanded has
been seen in the 43 "distinctively
styled" homes in the first residen
tial tract completed, near the Menlo
Park boundary of Stanford land.
The legal barriers to the develop
ment of Stanford land have, of
courre, been overcome. The Uni
versity's Founding Grant, under
which the University is compelled
to operate, stipulates that none of
Stanford's 9,000 acres can be sold.
The Board of Trustees, however,
has maintained the right of the Uni
versity to "lease" its land. The gen
eral lease type which has been used
is for 99 years.
At the apparent rate of progress
of the land development program in
just a few years, it is likely that
full development will take consid
erably less than 99 years. Business
Manager Brandin estimates tenta
tivefy that in between 25 and 50
years, the 5,000 acres will be "fully
developed."
There is substance to such a pre
diction. Stanford needs the money,
the Peninsula needs the space, and
University leaders have shown a fa
cility and a mood to achieve the
proper arrangements.
That "mood" is best expressed by
a saying which appears to have be
come a favorite of University offi
cers in recent years:
"Stanford is on the move."
The "move" is careful and con
sidered, but it is by no means slow.
To guarantee the fulfillment of its
functions as a "university," Stan
ford is quickly attempting to meet
its needs as a "business."

"STANFORD IS ON THE MOVE"
Stanford is a university.
But while its academic head may be groping toward the heights
of the universe for new ideas and truths, its physical feet are
being planted firmly beneath the ground.
For Stanford is also a business, by necessity rooted in a con-

tinual effort to keep itself finan
cially secure for the progressive
conduct of its higher purpose.
Thus it is more than an entity of
ideas, knowledge, and educational
tradition. It is also an organization
of men who must be paid, buildings
which must be maintained, and
equipment which must be pur
cha ed. It is a system of plumbing,
an ordered maze of wiring, and a
mountain of files, papers, and rec
ords.
The cost of those physical neces
sities, of Stanford "the business,"
has shot up in recent years along
with the general economic spiral of

In a recent meeting, Stanford's
Board of Trustees took two fur
ther steps to '"guarantee the rural
and secluded atmosphere of the
campus" under the land develop
ment program.
The trustees officially ruled that
the area reserved for the campus
he set at 3,820 acres, leaving about
5,(100 acres to be leased for com
mercial, industrial, and residen
tial use.

our society and time. In the past
ten years, the annual operating cost
of the University has approximately
tripled.
For a time, Stanford endeavored
to sustain itself on its traditional
"fixed" income of endowment, gifts,
and tuition.
But the widening gap between
expenditures and "fixed" income
led to what administration leaders
called the "financially tightest two
years in the history of, Stanford"
and a "dangerous pattern" of defi
cit budgeting.
Today the situation Is considered
brighter, because of efforts of Uni
versity officers to increase the
"fixed" income. This year, tuition
was increased ("reluctantly") from
$220 to $250 a quarter per student.
And through efforts of volunteer
alumni groups and the University's
General Secretary Office, gifts to
endowment and operating expenses
have skyrocketed. Last year, a total
of almost $5.5 million was donated
to Stanford, an increase of almost
$1.5 million over the record of the
previous year.
The realm which offers perhaps
the greatest potential for increasing
Stanford's income is, however, just
beginning to be cultivated.

That realm is the commercial de
velopment of the University's al
most 9,000 acres of property.
Already, parts of a master plan
for land development have mate
rialized. Students driving along
Palm Drive or El Camino Real can
witness the construction of a new
hopping center which will house
such concerns as the Emporium,
Roos Brothers, and Magnin's. Far
ther south on El Camino, they will
see already completed buildings for
such light industries as electronics
(Varian Associates) and photo pro
cessing (Eastman Kodak).
The master plan for the 5,000
acres calls for much more than
these apparently isolated achieve
ments.
That land is gradually—and care
fully—being leased out to private
organizations for three types of de
velopment: light industrial, com
mercial and business, and residen
tial.
Prospective residential develop
ment calls for the use of over 4,000
of the acres and induces perhaps
the most intriguing predictions for
the future of Stanford's property.

our society and time. In the past
ten years, the annual operating cost
of the University has approximately
tripled.
For a time, Stanford endeavored
to sustain itself on its traditional
"fixed" income of endowment, gifts,
and tuition.
But the widening gap between
expenditures and "fixed" income
led to what administration leaders
called the "financially tightest two
years in the history of, Stanford"
and a "dangerous pattern" of defi
cit budgeting.
Today the situation Is considered
brighter, because of efforts of Uni
versity officers to increase the
"fixed" income. This year, tuition
was increased ("reluctantly") from
$220 to $250 a quarter per student.
And through efforts of volunteer
alumni groups and the University's
General Secretary Office, gifts to
endowment and operating expenses
have skyrocketed. Last year, a total
of almost $5.5 million was donated
to Stanford, an increase of almost
$1.5 million over the record of the
previous year.
The realm which offers perhaps
the greatest potential for increasing
Stanford's income is, however, just
beginning to be cultivated.

That realm is the commercial de
velopment of the University's al
most 9,000 acres of property.
Already, parts of a master plan
for land development have mate
rialized. Students driving along
Palm Drive or El Camino Real can
witness the construction of a new
hopping center which will house
such concerns as the Emporium,
Roos Brothers, and Magnin's. Far
ther south on El Camino, they will
see already completed buildings for
such light industries as electronics
(Varian Associates) and photo pro
cessing (Eastman Kodak).
The master plan for the 5,000
acres calls for much more than
these apparently isolated achieve
ments.
That land is gradually—and care
fully—being leased out to private
organizations for three types of de
velopment: light industrial, com
mercial and business, and residen
tial.
Prospective residential develop
ment calls for the use of over 4,000
of the acres and induces perhaps
the most intriguing predictions for
the future of Stanford's property.
One University report indicates the
possibility of an eventual commu
nity of 32,000 people living in homes
on the now barren, rolling hills be
hind campus. Modern schools,
parks, and shopping centers will be
included.
Stanford's financial needs are not
the only reason for the development
of its land. Population studies have
warned of a tremendous need for
space on the Peninsula in the next
several decades. The Stanford prop
erty is considered by many to be
the last large area of land on the
Peninsula suitable for residential
development.
The announcements of Stanford's
plans have not met with universal
approval, however. There has been
some criticism of the program in
that it might end in the Stanford
area becoming a scene of "belching
mokestacks" and "cracker - box"
housing tracts.
Alf Brandin, University business
manager and chief officer for land
development, has said that the re
sults of the program will be "es
thetically, as well as commercially,
first-class."
The University has indicated that
it will preserve the "esthetic beau
ty" of the Stanford area in two
ways:
1. To keep the campus itself from
becoming a "tight little island" in
the shadows of shoppirui centers
and housing tracts, Stanford is
guaranteeing almost 4,000 acres for
the campus itself. According to the
University Planning Office, this

hould allow for "any possible ex
pansion" of the present 1,200-acre
campus.
2. The University has demanded
nnd will continue to demand an au
thority not only over the lease of
land, but over the architecture,
layout, and types of buildings which
vill be constructed. An indication
of the "high quality" demanded has
been seen in the 43 "distinctively
styled" homes in the first residen
tial tract completed, near the Menlo
Park boundary of Stanford land.
The legal barriers to the develop
ment of Stanford land have, of
courre, been overcome. The Uni
versity's Founding Grant, under
which the University is compelled
to operate, stipulates that none of
Stanford's 9,000 acres can be sold.
The Board of Trustees, however,
has maintained the right of the Uni
versity to "lease" its land. The gen
eral lease type which has been used
is for 99 years.
At the apparent rate of progress
of the land development program in
just a few years, it is likely that
full development will take consid
erably less than 99 years. Business
Manager Brandin estimates tenta
tivefy that in between 25 and 50
years, the 5,000 acres will be "fully
developed."
There is substance to such a pre
diction. Stanford needs the money,
the Peninsula needs the space, and
University leaders have shown a fa
cility and a mood to achieve the
proper arrangements.
That "mood" is best expressed by
a saying which appears to have be
come a favorite of University offi
cers in recent years:
"Stanford is on the move."
The "move" is careful and con
sidered, but it is by no means slow.
To guarantee the fulfillment of its
functions as a "university," Stan
ford is quickly attempting to meet
its needs as a "business."

space on the Peninsula in the next
several decades. The Stanford prop
erty is considered by many to be
the last large area of land on the
Peninsula suitable for residential
development.
The announcements of Stanford's
plans have not met with universal
approval, however. There has been
some criticism of the program in
that it might end in the Stanford
area becoming a scene of "belching
mokestacks" and "cracker - box"
housing tracts.
Alf Brandin, University business

development, has said that the re

it will preserve the "esthetic beau
ty" of the Stanford area in two
ways:
1. To keep the campus itself from
becoming a "tight little island" in
the shadows of shoppirui centers
and housing tracts, Stanford is
guaranteeing almost 4,000 acres for
the campus itself. According to the
University Planning Office, this

hould allow for "any possible ex
pansion" of the present 1,200-acre
campus.
2. The University has demanded

thority not only over the lease of
land, but over the architecture,
layout, and types of buildings which
vill be constructed. An indication
of the "high quality" demanded has
been seen in the 43 "distinctively
styled" homes in the first residen
tial tract completed, near the Menlo
Park boundary of Stanford land.

ment of Stanford land have, of

which the University is compelled

of the land development program in
just a few years, it is likely that
full development will take consid

To guarantee the fulfillment of its

"STANFORD IS ON THE MOVE"
Stanford is a university.
But while its academic head may be groping toward the heights
of the universe for new ideas and truths, its physical feet are
being planted firmly beneath the ground.
For Stanford is also a business, by necessity rooted in a con-

tinual effort to keep itself finan
cially secure for the progressive
conduct of its higher purpose.
Thus it is more than an entity of
ideas, knowledge, and educational
tradition. It is also an organization
of men who must be paid, buildings
which must be maintained, and
equipment which must be pur
cha ed. It is a system of plumbing,
an ordered maze of wiring, and a
mountain of files, papers, and rec
ords.
The cost of those physical neces
sities, of Stanford "the business,"
has shot up in recent years along
with the general economic spiral of

In a recent meeting, Stanford's
Board of Trustees took two fur
ther steps to '"guarantee the rural
and secluded atmosphere of the
campus" under the land develop
ment program.
The trustees officially ruled that
the area reserved for the campus
he set at 3,820 acres, leaving about
5,(100 acres to be leased for com
mercial, industrial, and residen
tial use.
The group also adopted a pol
icy which intends to prohibit con
struction of buildings in the area
considered the "backdrop" of the
campus—the hilltops, ridges, and
skylines visible from in front of
the campus.

our society and time. In the past
ten years, the annual operating cost
of the University has approximately
tripled.
For a time, Stanford endeavored
to sustain itself on its traditional
"fixed" income of endowment, gifts,
and tuition.
But the widening gap between
expenditures and "fixed" income
led to what administration leaders
called the "financially tightest two
years in the history of, Stanford"
and a "dangerous pattern" of defi
cit budgeting.
Today the situation Is considered
brighter, because of efforts of Uni
versity officers to increase the
"fixed" income. This year, tuition
was increased ("reluctantly") from
$220 to $250 a quarter per student.
And through efforts of volunteer
alumni groups and the University's
General Secretary Office, gifts to
endowment and operating expenses
have skyrocketed. Last year, a total
of almost $5.5 million was donated
to Stanford, an increase of almost
$1.5 million over the record of the
previous year.
The realm which offers perhaps
the greatest potential for increasing
Stanford's income is, however, just
beginning to be cultivated.

That realm is the commercial de
velopment of the University's al
most 9,000 acres of property.
Already, parts of a master plan
for land development have mate
rialized. Students driving along
Palm Drive or El Camino Real can
witness the construction of a new
hopping center which will house
such concerns as the Emporium,
Roos Brothers, and Magnin's. Far
ther south on El Camino, they will
see already completed buildings for
such light industries as electronics
(Varian Associates) and photo pro
cessing (Eastman Kodak).
The master plan for the 5,000
acres calls for much more than
these apparently isolated achieve
ments.
That land is gradually—and care
fully—being leased out to private
organizations for three types of de
velopment: light industrial, com
mercial and business, and residen
tial.
Prospective residential develop
ment calls for the use of over 4,000
of the acres and induces perhaps
the most intriguing predictions for
the future of Stanford's property.
One University report indicates the
possibility of an eventual commu
nity of 32,000 people living in homes
on the now barren, rolling hills be
hind campus. Modern schools,
parks, and shopping centers will be
included.
Stanford's financial needs are not
the only reason for the development
of its land. Population studies have
warned of a tremendous need for
space on the Peninsula in the next
several decades. The Stanford prop
erty is considered by many to be
the last large area of land on the
Peninsula suitable for residential
development.
