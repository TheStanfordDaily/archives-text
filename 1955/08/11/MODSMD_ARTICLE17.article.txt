# Stanford Gets Public Aid For Med School Center
## 
### 
Stanford this week was awarded $435,000 in state and federal
hospital aid money for construction of a medical and psychological
rehabilitation center, but lost on requests for state aid in building
a four million dollar teaching hospital.
University officials say the award, made by the State Hospital

Advisory Council, will probably
mean that the rehabilitation center
will be the first unit of the proposed
campus medical school.
The center is expected to cost
about $973,000, with Stanford put
ting up the balance of the costs.
Present plans are for construction
to begin in about a year.
The rehabilitation center ties in
with Stanford plans to centralize on
campus the University clinics now
in San Francisco, physical therapy
facilities at Stanford Village, and
speech and hearing clinics already
on campus.
In making the award, the council
indicated that up to $100,000 more
might be given Stanford. Included
is a $500,00 grant to the state of
Nevada, which that state cannot
use.
Nevada has offered to transfer its
share to California if the federal
government approves.
President Sterling says the Uni
versity has asked for about $650,000
in state and federal aid for con
struction of the med school rehabil
itation center.
