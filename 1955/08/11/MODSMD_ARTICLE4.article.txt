# Farewell Statement
## 
### 
The quarter is near its end, and
it is now possible to look at the
past seven weeks with some de
gree of objectivity.
It has been a good, successful
quarter. A large share of the suc
cess belongs to a summer student
body that was probably more in
terested and more active than any
previous one we have had here at
Stanford.
Activity and interest were
shown in all of the student-body
affairs held this summer; every
one of them had attendance that
was significantly above compar
able affairs held in summers past.
In one case, that of the summer
dance held yearly at Lagunita
Court, four times as many tickets
were sold this year as last. Inter
est, too, has been demonstrated by
the large attendance at the Stan
ford Players' productions, and by
the occasional but interested stu
dents who attended our Execu
tive Committee meetings on Tues
day evenings.
We hope that you have enjoyed
your summer at Stanford, and
that you will return next year. It
has been a pleasure serving you.
JERRY MESSNER,
Chairman, Executive Committee
