# Quarter Report Heard by Excom
## 
### 
ASSU Summer Excom met last
night for its last session and heard
summary reports on the quarter's
budget and social activities.
Ken Cole, summer business man
ager, reported that $115 was still
left of the $700 budgeted by the
ASSU Legislature for summer
quarter social affairs. Excom then
passed a motion that ASSU pay
half of net costs of the Associated
Women Students dance at Lagunita
last Saturday, to an amount not to
exceed $75.
The remainder of the budgeted
$700, which will be a minimum of
$40 after the AWS expenses are
paid, will revert to the ASSU con
tingency fund.
Excom unanimously applauded
Kay Vinson, chairman of the AWS
dance, which was termed a "top
notch success" by President Jerry
Messner.
Messner gave a resume of the
quarter's social affairs. All five of
them—the all-University reception,
Lagunita open house, watermelon
feed, dance at Toyon, and AWS
dance—were well attended.
Messner told that the ASSU's gift
to President and Mrs. Sterling on
their anniversary was a nine-inch
vase of Steuben glass.
Gloria Ward. Graduate represen
tative, requested that next year
provision be made for functions for
the graduates.
