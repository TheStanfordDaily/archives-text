# Balch Moves To MIT for Athletic Post
## 
### 
Richard L. Balch, Chief Counselor
for Men at Stanford, has been ap
pointed Director of Athletics at
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy. He has been at Stanford since
1949.
A graduate of Pasadena JC in
1937, he received the A.B. degree at
Union College in 1941. At the age
of 27, after war duty in the Navy,
he became Assistant Director of
Admissions at Union College.
He did work with foreign stu
dents on the freshman advisory
program, and in the alumni office.
At Stanford Balch has led an ac
tive and varied career, supervising
men's dorms, acting as general aca
demic and personal adviser to men,
as faculty adviser to fraternities,
and as administrator of financial
aid.
In his efforts to get the draft
"panic" clarified for college - age
men, he worked as chairman of the
Committee on Military Affairs and
was quoted by Time magazine
(January 1951) in explaining that
"draft neurosis is not fear nor lack
of patriotism; it's a form of be
wilderment."
Balch has emphasized unity of
law interpretations by draft boards
and a more standardized level of
deferment.
He also developed a new Resident
Assistant system for fraternities
which will be voted on by Inter
fraternity Council this fall.
During his stay at Stanford he
was granted a visiting fellowship
to study at Harvard in admissions
and administration.
At MIT he will be the director of
athletics and will co-ordinate the
athletic program with dorm and
fraternity activities.
He feels that on the intramural
level there is a "great opportunity to
integrate superior intellectual ex
perience with amateur athletics,"
and hopes that MIT will help to re
establish this type of sports activity
for college students.
