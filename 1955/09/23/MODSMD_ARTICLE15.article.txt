# '59 Hereâ€”Chaos Reigns

They're fresh off the train, and I
they may look a little confused, and j
perhaps their clothes are unaccept- 1
ably clean and their faces a little I
too cheerful, but after all, the class
of '50 isn't too much different than
any other freshman class, finding j
themselves somehow caught in a
bewildering whirl of meetings, con- j
ferences, tests, and leering sopho
mores.
Like all its predecessors. '59 will
soon adapt itself to the situation.
White bucks will become properly
scuffed, wide-eyed anticipation will
quickly recede into a calculated
casualness, and anyone audacious j
enough to scream "To Hell with '5'.)" !
will be rapidly counterattacked with
the fury of an avenging savage.
They'll even begin to recognize
their classmates, but not early
enough to be able to prevent a few
hundred of the enemy from sneak- j
in l ' into the Jolly-up.
With the strength of the righteous,
they'll probably even be able to
whip the sophomores at the Frosh-
Sopli Jamboree, outvote every othei
class in the ASSU elections, and
pride themselves on the fact that
they've uot the prettiest bunch of
coeds Stanford has ever seen.
It'll be a lot of fun, maybe too
much, a lot of work, too much of
that too, but for the Class of '59, the
freshman year will l>v something to
remember.
