# stars in your eyes
## 
### 
You have stars in your eyes—if you follow
the pattern of previous freshman classes. There
are 1,290 of you in the Class of '59 and you are
all excited about your future at Stanford and
your future after Stanford.
You are now a member of the Stanford Fam
ily, of which you have heard so much. You
have achieved one of your most important
goals. We congratulate you and welcome you
to the Farm.
Now we suggest your next major goal: to
maintain your membership in the Stanford
Family. The responsibility for this rests prima
rily with you, but everyone at Stanford has an
obligation. The University is now engaged in
a detailed study of the entire undergraduate
program. A majority of the students are con
stantly striving to improve every aspect of cam
pus life. The single goal is a better Stanford,
a better Stanford Family.
A few—shall we call them the cynical sen
iors, the jaundiced juniors, and the sophomoric
sophomores—v/ill try to convince you through

word and deed that this thing called the Stan
ford Family is a lot of nonsense. They have
been disillusioned. Stanford did not hand them
exactly the things they were looking for, and
they were unable to find the real Stanford
They evidently didn't make it over the first
hurdle, and then instead of pushing ahead, be
gan to tear down behind and around them. The
stars are gone from their eyes.
But you have stars in your eyes. And there
is a Stanford Family, a Family bound strongly
by a common desire to develop a more versa
tile individual and to create a better world. The
members of the Stanford Family have their
heads in the clouds and their feet on the
ground; they shrug off discouragement and set
backs.
Yesterday you met many of the Stanford
Family — the Pre-Reg Committee, your spon
sors, the men in the black robes at the Convo
cation. They have stars in their eyes. When
you don the black robes four years hence, may
you have the same stars in your eyes.
