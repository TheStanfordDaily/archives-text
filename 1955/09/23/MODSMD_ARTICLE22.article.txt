Freshmen at Stanford don't have it so bad,
according to the news that is radiating out from
Oliver campuses.
The Foghorn at the University of San Fran
cisco recently published a story headlined "At
tention All Frosh" with five rules for the USF
class of '59.
They were (1) signs and dinks must be worn
at all times; (2) male frosh must wear ties; (3)
female frosh must wear NO makeup; (4) all
frosh must do double-time if requested to do
so; and (5) all school songs and yells must be
memorized and recited upon request of an up

On a more cheerful side, at least as far as
freshmen are concerned, the Daily Kansan al
the University of Kansas announced that they
would teach their freshmen the campus tradi
tions without the benefit of hazing. They, too,
planned a convocation but they had the new
class recite "... I will transmit the University

better, finer and stronger than it was transmit
ted to me."

The University of California Daily Calilornian
isn't so kind to their freshmen, however. As
the Daily said, "somebody goofed." The news
paper printed a story staling that there would
be a freshman rally when Iheze wasn't one at
all. Not at all.
According to the Daily, several freshmen
wandered around campus wondering where on
earth their freshman rally had gone to and
never did find it. "Oh, well," the Daily said,
"better luck next time."

And for the final tidbit, as if anyone really 5
cared, the University of California at Los An- 1
geles, according to the Doily Calilornian at UC, 1
lias discovered the longest garter snake ever to
be found.
The champion, the Daily said, is three and
one-half feet long.
