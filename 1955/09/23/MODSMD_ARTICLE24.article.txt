### 
A cheery greeting and an out
stretched hand are far from the only
tasks undertaken by the G1 busy
sponsors as they welcome and edu
cate the Class of '59 on the details
of Farm life.
For the past four days, sponsors
from Roble, Branner, Wilbur, Stern,
and Off-Campus have been attend
ing meetings, panel discussions, and
speeches intended to prepare them
for the responsibility of helping and
planning activities for the 1.290 new
fre h'men.
Junior and senior men and women
are selected to serve as sponsors and
freshman house officers during the
spring quarter by a Men's and Wo
men's Sponsor Choosing Committee,
composed of various student leaders.
Hours of preparation and discussion
of the criteria of choosing sponsors
precede the actual interviews and
selection.
Out of 144 women trying out for
sponsoring, 33 were chosen, 23 to
reside at Roble, eight at Branner,
and two to administer the functions
of the off-campus freshman women.
Roble's head sponsor Eleanor Friar
and Branner's sponsor president
Nancy Smalley were also named at

this time.
At the new Wilbur Hall, Jack
Pike leads the senior and 1(5 j
junior sponsors, and at Stern Hall
Robert Rutherford .verves as .' enior
sponsor over two junior spon ors.
At Roble. duties as-igned to senior i
sponsors are those of administrator |
and pre ident of the corridor and
wing, and junior iponsors are se
lected to serve as social chairmen.
Since Branner's sponsors work with
a imaller corridor, one sponsor
serves in both capacities. One senior
and two junior .sponsors administer
the eight hou..es comprising Wilbur
Hail.
The sponsors, arriving here on
Sunday, wore initiated into the
sponsor-preparation program by a j
talk by President Wallace Sterling, ;
who spoke in appreciation of the ;
work the spomori do in the student]
administration of fre::hman dormi- !
tory life.
Talks followed on the Fundamen- j
tal Standard and Honor Code, prin- !
ciples of leader hip, presentation oft
idetss, house governments, pre-regis- |
tration details, and social co-ordi- 1
nation.
In separate meetings held for men i
and women sponsors, it was decided
thai a drive would to made toward !
a more academic climate away from |
an over-emphasis, on social life in I
the freshman orientation.
