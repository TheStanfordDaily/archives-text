# Student Cards Not Pictorial
## 
### 
Despite announcements spring
quarter, Stanford students will not
find their faces beaming from plastic
ca es on their student body cards
this year, Assistant Registrar Elmer
C. Wagner announced yesterday.
Wagner said that due to the fact
that the equipment necessary for
printing the pictures on plastic eases
has not yet arrived, the University
will be unable to put tlvj system
into operation until winter quarter
or possibly even spring quarter of
next year.
Returning ,students will find a
change in their student body cards,
however.
They are h:-ing printed on thinner
material and have a tab for a cash
ier's stamp which will NOT be de
tached, but will fold under to form
the regulation size card. Also, Un
numbered "privileges" will not run
along the lower of the card
but along the right-hand side.
