Two important additions to
Stanford received their initiation

dence for men.
The occupancy of Wilbur was ;i
symbol of a Stanford victory in a
i race with time. The $.'5,2.i0,000 do: -

i.)! a I hy covered walkways

with the dining rooms and office in
the center of the quadrangle.
Close to each of the eight houses
are four-room homes for married
faculty couples who will serve as the
residence masters, a capacity simi
lar to that of the resident assistants
who have been the personal coun
selors for freshmen in the past.
Each house has been given a
Spanish name associated with this
area of California. Clockwise from
the left as one faces the hall they
are: Arroyo, Cedro, Junipero, Ma
dera, Otero, Rinconada, Soto, and
Trancos. Room numbers are based
on the first letters of the house
names; for example, M-201 is on the
second floor of Madera.
21 SPONSORS
Twenty-four sponsors are helping
the 072 freshmen in Wilbur become
acquainted with Stanford. Jack Pike
is head Wilbur sponsor.
The freshmen in Wilbur and the
three wings of freshmen in Stern
compose the Wilbur Club, and all
eat in the Wilbur dining hall. The
club constitution provides for a leg
islative body, and for the election
of a president, manager, and social
chairman of each floor of every
house.
