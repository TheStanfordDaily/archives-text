# Stanford Seeks Second Straight Against OSC
## 
### BOB MIEROW 
Oregon State's black uniformed Beavers test their unproved offense which worked so well last
week against Brigham Young when they step onto the Multnomah Stadium turf in Portland against
Stanford's Indians tomorrow night.
The Beaver single wing attack may well suffer a definite setback if hula-hipped Hawaiian half
back Joe Francis isn't able to work. Francis, sophomore tailback, sprained an ankle in the BYTj

debacle and has been out of action"
during practice this week.
Transfer Bernard Bruce is expect
ed to move into the important tail
back spot if Francis does not i;uil
up. Ray Westfall, unable to play in
the opener because of injuries, will
also see action. Westfall was num
ber two quarterback in Kip Taylor's
T formation last year a:.cl runs as
well as he passes.

The Beavers rolled all over the
Cougars from the Skyline Confer
ence in last week's opener. Tommy
Prothro's boys romped to five touch
downs that counted and three more
that penalties nullified in their 33-0
triumph. Behind a powerful ground
attack, the Beavers rolled 492 yards
against BYU while allowing only
215.
The redshirted Indians, as well as
the Corvallis outfit, are suffering
from injuries. Linemen Steve Doc
tor, John Kidd, Chris Plain, Don
Ocddes, Walt Eagle, and Russ Steele
and backs Bob Schmidt and Gordy
Young will miss the Beaver tilt.
Steele and Schmidt, both promis
ing sophomores, are out for the en
lire season. Geddes, first-string cen
ter until his wound cut him down,
and biggest man on the squad
at 241, will be out of action until the
Tribe travels to Michigan State.
Docter, rated one of the Redshirts'
1 top ends, and halfback Young, a
j starter last season, will miss only
; one more game. Kidd and Eagle are
j also expected to be ready for Ohio
State next week.
STEPHEN, FREIS PLAY
Roy Stephen, a transfer from
Santa Ana JC, should be back in
action for the Indians. The highly
' rated halfback has been suffering

from a back injury but will wear a
brace in the Beaver encounter.
Joel Freis, sophomore end from
Los Angeles, will bp back in uni
form against OSC. Freis pulled a
rib posing for a cameraman earlier
in pre-season practice.
Outside of the tailback, wingback
Sam Wesley and fullback Tom
Berry will do most of the work for
the Beavers. Bernie Bruce, who will
start should Francis' injury not re
spond, averaged 9.8 yards per run
in the first game. Wc 'ley averaged
14 yards in four carries against the
Cougars.
OSC is the first of .several single
wing teams which the Tribe will
oppose in the next lew we; ks. Mich
igan Slate interchanges the one
wingback style with the '1 in their
so-called "multiple offense." UCLA,
favored to capture the PCC gridiron
championship, also is a strong ex
ponent of the single wing.
OSC RESEMBLES UCLA
Actually ,the Beavers utilize al
most the exact same system as Bed
Sanders of the Bruins. Tommy
Prothro, OSC pilot, has been an as
sistant coach under Sanders in re
cent years. Assistant coach Terry
Debay anchored the Bruin line at
center last year, while line coach
Bob Zelinka played under Sanders
in 1950 and 1951.
Coach Chuck Taylor is expected to
start the same lineup as he did last
week against COP. Jerry Beatie, a
blond crew-cut junior, and John
Stewart, the PCC's leading pass re
ceiver, will open at the end spots.
Chris Marshall and Paul Wiggin
should be at tackle at the opening
kickofT. Joe Long will pivot the line
from his center position.
Guard Tony Mosich will captain
the Tribe against the Cnrvallis kids.
Donn Carswell will start opposite
Mosich at the other guard spot.
Jerry Gustafson seems to have
displaced John Brodie at tlie start
ing quarterback position. Brodie
was rated fourth in the nation in
passing last year, but Gus, the As
toria senior, completed 14 of 18 at
tempted passes' last Saturday to
prove his throwing ability.
Ernie Dorn, Paul Camera, and
Bill Tarr will round out the Card
backfield. *
NO NIGHT WORKOUT
The Tribe's . r !G - man traveling
squad will board a plane at noon
today en route t:i Portland. The
Cards had expected to work out un
der the lights ol' Multnomah Sta
dium tonight but this was postponed
because the greyhounds will be
running there.
KickofT time for the 25th renewal
of the Stanford-OSC series is set
for 8 p.m. Oregon State's ticket
manager has predicted a crowd of
"at least 20,000 for Portland's first
college game of the year."
Prothro has been experimenting
in practice this week to find the
right combination of players to
throw against the Indians. Last
week, the Beaver boss opened with
Dan Naranche and Norm Thiel at
ends, Howard Buettgenbach and
John Witte at tackles, Bob Riggert
and Vern Ellison at guards, and
Larry Stevens at center.
Along with Berry, Wesley, and
Francis of Bruce, Ron Siegrist will
round out the backfield, opening at
blocking back.
Stanford will be working on a
five-game winning streak when they
tackle the Beavers tomorrow. The
last time Oregon State topped a
tribe team was in 1947.
