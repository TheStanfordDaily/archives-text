Coach Chuck Taylor's gridders j
won't be the only Indian athletes j
huffing and puffing on the Farm this
fall. Lou Lindsey, Stanford crsw
mentor, will launch a full-scale con
ditioning and training program start
ing ;jt the end of next week, and he
and Phil Waters expect a large turn
out. Waters, veteran from last year's
var. ity, will take over Conn Finley's
position as frosh coach.
Lin:sey, in his first year as Indian
crew chief, recorded an outstanding i
record and ended the regular season J
by coaching his boys to a resounding
31/2 length victory over the Califor
nia Bears in the last dual race of
the reason.
DUAL VICTORIES
The Big Red eight went unde
feated in 6 straight dual races and
: cored an impressive second in the
Western Sprint Championships at
Newport and a fifth in the IRA re
gatta on Lake Onandaga in New
York. The Newport contest wit
nessed the Indian first boat beating
the powerful Washington Huskies
and the Bears to the wire. Navy
copped that title for the second year
in a row.
FROSH WANTED
Coach Lindsey and varsity cap
tain Gordie Best expressed a -sin
cere desire to have a large frosh
turnout this year to keep the fast
rising Indian eights in the national j
limelight. The acquisition of a new
shell will provide more and newer l
equipment, and the completed facili
ties at the Redwood City Yacht Har
bor make the rowing picture on the
Farm extremely bright.
Captain Best stated that no pre
vious crew experience is necessary
for frosh candidates and that size
and strength are great attributes.
Further information concerning the
Big Red eights can be obtained in
the pamphlet which is being distrib
uted by members of the Varsity
