# TAYLOR LESS OPTIMISTIC
## Cards Impress In Premiere 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Chuck Taylor is almost always cplimistic, but lie is less opti
mistic after a victory than a defeat. It's his psychology or some
thing. '
At any rate, Coach Taylor lias done the best he can to "pooh
pooh" Stanford's smashing triumph over an overrated, overconfi-

dent band of COP Tigf it. 33-14. Sat
urday in the Stadium.
At Monday's football luncheon in
San Francisco Taylor said, "I can't
get excited about our victory. We
made a lot of mistake."
But many observers Saturday felt
that the Indians made fever mis
takes than in any previous opening
game during Taylor's reign as head
coach.
Stanford appeared to be a sound,
well-balanced foothill team with
faster, harder - driving backs air!
•better pursuit and gang tackling
than in recent years.
Despite his attempts to 1 'little
the win ("You can't judge a sea-on
on the basis of the first game"),
Taylor admitted that winning the
opener "can't hurt us." "And I
think it did us a lot of good," he
continued. "The boys did a veal
workmanlike job and I think it ' ave
'em a lot of confidence."
Taylor was impressed with the
team's ability to bounce hack ait. r
COP scored suddenly at the 1 egin
ning of both halves. "They main
tained their poise when the tv/o
breaks went again I them and vnt
right to work," he said. This is a
sign of an experienced team, Taylor
added.
After the game, Taylor said h<
thought that the whole line did a
"pretty good defensive job." But he
said that the team really didn't get
a good defensive test because COP
passed only three times.
"I was surprised that they didn't
pass more," Taylor said. lis ex
plained, however, that it is diflicub
to pass from the tight T-formation
with the backs in normal positions
and the ends in close.
Stanford relies on a spread T with
one back (usually Paul Camera)
flanked wide and the era! on the op
posite side (usually J'.hn St' war:)
split out also. It was from this for
mation that Jerry Gustafson com
pleted 14 of 18 pass'es and the three
Card quarterbacks Custa on, John
Brodie, and Jack Don i is -connect
ed on l*7of 23.
Stewart drew high praise from
Ohio State .scout K co Kaarkin- en for
his ability to break into the t , n on
his pass patterns. Stevart caiM 'it
eight passes for hi • afternoon*'-, work
as well as playing strongly at de
fensive end. However. Oustal on',

[wo touchdown passes were thrown
i to Camera.
Taylor also had words of praise
for tiie offense. He explained that j
CCP was maneuvering in the line to |
break up the trap plays which are
a basic ingredient of the Indian at
tack. For that reason the Tribe used
i a lot of wide stuff and short passes ;
to Stewart and Camera.
"We had ball control in the second
half," Taylor said, "and that says a I
lot for our offense."
A 1 Harrington, the fleet fullback
from Hawaii by way of Menlo JC, J

was the subject of much interest.
Harrington handled the ball seven
iimes for 22 yards and six points on I
the Tribe's final touchdown march. '
Concerning Harrington's perform
ance, Taylor said, "He looked like he |
had a lot of potential—which we
know he has. He's just a youngster
and he has a lot of work ahead."
Taylor was very concerned about |
the knee injury to sophomore half
back Lou Valli. "That hurts," he !
: aid. "Valli had better speed and !
moves than any of our backs and
I was expecting him to move into I
the first string." Valli will fcj out
cd on 17 of 23.

CHUCK TAYLOR
Chuck Taylor is almost always cplimistic, but lie is less opti
mistic after a victory than a defeat. It's his psychology or some
thing. '
At any rate, Coach Taylor lias done the best he can to "pooh
pooh" Stanford's smashing triumph over an overrated, overconfi-

dent band of COP Tigf it. 33-14. Sat
urday in the Stadium.
At Monday's football luncheon in
San Francisco Taylor said, "I can't

made a lot of mistake."
But many observers Saturday felt
that the Indians made fever mis

game during Taylor's reign as head
coach.
Stanford appeared to be a sound,
well-balanced foothill team with
faster, harder - driving backs air!

Despite his attempts to 1 'little

Taylor admitted that winning the
opener "can't hurt us." "And I

After the game, Taylor said h<
thought that the whole line did a
"pretty good defensive job." But he
said that the team really didn't get
a good defensive test because COP
passed only three times.
