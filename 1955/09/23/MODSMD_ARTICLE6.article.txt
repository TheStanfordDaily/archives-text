# Remember: Turn Back That Clock
## 
### 
"Backward, turn backward, O time
in your flight.
Set the clock back again this Sun
day night."
Adding to the bewilderment of
getting prepared for another school
year, the gods have proclaimed that
the sun should slop at exactly 2 a.m.
Sunday, at which time we are ob
liged to set our* clocks back exactly
one hour signifying the end of Day
light Saving Time and the return
of St.-'.n lard Time.
Well, anyway, we can all sleep an
hour later Sunday morning.
