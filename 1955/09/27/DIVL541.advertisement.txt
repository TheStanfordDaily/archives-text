A fellow from the Business School camc in and said:
"I don't understand it. Gordon. How is it that you have such a and de
volcd following on campus? Why do all the students trade here?"
It is simple," I said. "Wc sell all our merchandise below cost, and the stu
dents like to cash in on that kind of a deal/'
"But you seem so prosperous. I low can you continually sell below cost and do
so well:' Is il that you make up for it by doing a large volume?"
"No. that is not our method," I answered. "Wc do it by juggling the books."
AND WE DO SELL AT WHOLESALE

needles, components, wc sell at catalogue net prices. Compare our prices with any
others nationally. Then SAVE WITH US.

Bay Area I M radio is just about the best in the nation. If you don't have a tuner or
radio, wc can fix you up for as little as $3500.
