# Craig, Terman Chosen to Fill Farm Administrative Positions
## New Dean of Men Is 'Still Learning’ 
### 
"I'm still learning a lot," says
Stanford's slightly bewildered
new Dean of Men William G.
Craig. Craig is starting his third
hectic week on campus as suc
cessor to Richard L. Balch.
Craig comes to Stanford from
Kansas State College where he was
clean of students. He fills the va
cancy created when Balch, chief
counselor for men, resigned to be
come athletic director at Massachu
setts Institute of Technology.
The title of Craig's office is new
but the duties are essentially' the
same as those undertaken by Balch.
Craig will have responsibility for
the counseling program in the resi
dences and general assistance to
students on personal and academic
problems.
• Craig has spent his first two weeks
trying to get adjusted to his new
surroundings. And he expects it
will take a couple of weeks more
before he is oriented to the Farm.
He still relies on his secretary to
tell him that his next meeting is
"two doors past Memorial Court,
upstairs and to the right."
But Craig is enthusiastic about his
now job and he "can't help but be
excited by the way the students
have taken over responsibility for
welcoming the freshmen." "They
show good organizational ability,"
he said, "and I am really impressed."
Craig received his A.B. degree at
Middlebury College in Vermont in
1037. He obtained his Master's from
Minnesota in 1946 and a doctorate
from Harvard, where he graduated
with Phi Beta Kappa standing.
From 194(5 to 1951 he was director
of the Washington State College
residence program, fraternity ad
viser, and dean of students.
As an undergraduate, Craig was
president of his senior class, captain
of the football team, and member
of the student council. Before doing
graduate work he spent four years
in the Navy as a personnel officer.
He is married and has three young
sons.
Craig is a member of the Ameri
can College Personnel Association,
the American Psychological Asso
ciation, and the National Association
of Student Personnel Administra
tors.
Balch, before leaving for MIT,
had been at Stanford since 1949. At
MIT he will be the director of ath
letics and will co-ordinate the ath
letic program with dorm and fra
ternity activities.
