## Two Dorms Made Ready for Living 
### DAVE BROWNWOOD Staff Editor, The Daily 
Students are viewing a chang
ing campus scene this fall, as
the biggest building program
since Stanford was opened de
velops around them.
Two dormitories were rushed to
completion over the summer and
ire now ready for ocupancy, with
the contractors still adding the fin
ishing touches as the new residents
move in.
Ray Lyman Wilbur Hall, the new
unit for 704 freshman men, was
opened last Thursday in time for
freshman pre-registration activities.
Although the $3,250,000 replacement
of Encina normally would require 18
months or more to construct, Wells
P. Goodenough, Palo Alto contrac
tor, and University officials have
rushed it to completion in 12 months.
Two wings of the new Crothers
Memorial Hall for graduate students j
in engineering opened yesterday.
The third wing will open in a few j
weeks. The $880,000 structure houses
216 men, and joins with the present
Crothers Hall for graduate students
in law to form a quadrangle. The !
addition is named for the late Mar
garet Jane Crothers, mother of
George E. Crothers, one of Stan
ford's great benefactors. Both struc- j
tures were developed through gifts i
from Judge Crothers.
In both these buildings construc
tion is not yet completed. The final
details and the major landscaping!
everything, including tree planting,
finished by the end of January, ac
cording to S. F. Post, assistant Uni
versity business manager.
STERN ADDITION
Construction is nearing comple- J

two wings which will house over 200 j
additional men, nearly doubling the j
present capacity, should be com

cupancy at the beginning of winter
quarter, said Post.
Site preparation for Florence j
Moore Hall, the new women's resi- \

NEW FACES—An altered campus scene greeted returning students this fall. Here bulldozers
complete the site preparation for the new Florence Moore Hall, a 350-unit dormitory for women
students to be built on the sloping field in front of the Knoll—part of the massive construction
program which includes the new Wilbur Hall and Crothers Memorial Hall, now essentially com
plete and occupied, and the Stern Hall addition, which will be ready for occupancy winter quar
ter. In addition to buildings, the program encompasses a road improvement program. A pe
ripheral road is under construction, Escondido Road is being improved, and Arguello Street is
being altered in one section to a pedestrian area.
