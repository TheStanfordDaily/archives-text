# Students View Largest Building Program Since Farm Was Opened
## Two Dorms Made Ready for Living 
### DAVE BROWNWOOD Staff Editor, The Daily 
Students are viewing a chang
ing campus scene this fall, as
the biggest building program
since Stanford was opened de
velops around them.
Two dormitories were rushed to
completion over the summer and
ire now ready for ocupancy, with
the contractors still adding the fin
ishing touches as the new residents
move in.
Ray Lyman Wilbur Hall, the new
unit for 704 freshman men, was
opened last Thursday in time for
freshman pre-registration activities.
Although the $3,250,000 replacement
of Encina normally would require 18
months or more to construct, Wells
P. Goodenough, Palo Alto contrac
tor, and University officials have
rushed it to completion in 12 months.
Two wings of the new Crothers
Memorial Hall for graduate students j
in engineering opened yesterday.
The third wing will open in a few j
weeks. The $880,000 structure houses
216 men, and joins with the present
Crothers Hall for graduate students
in law to form a quadrangle. The !
addition is named for the late Mar
garet Jane Crothers, mother of
George E. Crothers, one of Stan
ford's great benefactors. Both struc- j
tures were developed through gifts i
from Judge Crothers.
In both these buildings construc
tion is not yet completed. The final
details and the major landscaping!
everything, including tree planting,
finished by the end of January, ac
cording to S. F. Post, assistant Uni
versity business manager.
STERN ADDITION
Construction is nearing comple- J
tion on the Stern Hall addition. The
two wings which will house over 200 j
additional men, nearly doubling the j
present capacity, should be com
pleted by Dec. 1, and ready for oc- |
cupancy at the beginning of winter
quarter, said Post.
Site preparation for Florence j
Moore Hall, the new women's resi- \
dence, has been completed, and con
struction of the 350-unit dormitory
will begin by mid-October, officials
believe.

NEW FACES—An altered campus scene greeted returning students this fall. Here bulldozers
complete the site preparation for the new Florence Moore Hall, a 350-unit dormitory for women
students to be built on the sloping field in front of the Knoll—part of the massive construction
program which includes the new Wilbur Hall and Crothers Memorial Hall, now essentially com
plete and occupied, and the Stern Hall addition, which will be ready for occupancy winter quar
ter. In addition to buildings, the program encompasses a road improvement program. A pe
ripheral road is under construction, Escondido Road is being improved, and Arguello Street is
being altered in one section to a pedestrian area.
Stanford architecture," according to
Eldridge T. Spencer, F.A.1.A., di
rector of University planning. The
eight three-story units in Wilbur
are arranged in a quadrangle around
a central dining and administrative
area. The Stern addition is the sec
ond step in a similar final plan
for Stern. Crothers Memorial and
Crothers join to form a quadrangle.
Moore Hall, since it is composed of
seven units, follows a modified plan,
around a central administrative-din
ing area.
GIFT OF MKS. STERN
The addition to Stern is made pos
sible by new gifts from the estate of
Mrs. Louis Stern, known affection
ately as "Aunt Lucie" to three dec
ades of Stanford men whom she be
friended.
The existing portion of Stern Hall
was completed in 1949. It houses
229 students in four two-story wings.
Three of those wings are occupied by
freshmen now, realizing the Uni
versity goal of housing all the fresh
men on campus. The two new wings
are three stories in height.
Some of the facilities provided at
the time the first four wings were
built have sufficient capacity to serve
all eight. These include the kitch
ens, director's office and living quar
ters, employee living quarters, and
food storage basement.
As in the existing part of the hall,
two students will be in each room.
Each new wing will have a lounge
with fireplace and large glass areas
opening onto landscaped courts. A
cafeteria and dining room are being
constructed to serve both wings,
and there will be a storage basement
in one.
53,700 SQUARE FEET
The entire addition, comprising
53,700 square feet of floor space, is
being built of reinforced concrete.
The contemporary architectural de
sign of the original unit has been
followed.
Wilbur Hall is named for Ray Ly
man Wilbur, University president
for 27 years. It covers a 21-acre site
across Eseondido Road from Bran
ner Hall.

The central building houses the
kitchen, two cafeterias, and six din
ing rooms, and a I <> houses the ad
ministrative offices, the director's
living quarters, and five employees'
rooms.
Covered walkways, still under
construction, will connect all of (he
units, and the courtyards between
buildings will be landscaped.
RESIDENC E MASTER
In conjunction with each of the
eight "houses" is a home for th'e
residence master, a faculty member.
A student lounge adjoins each of
the houses.
The campus does not have a mo
nopoly on the construction in this
area, however. Things are taking
shape in the regional shopping cen
ter. One of the seven buildings is
ready, and Roos Bros, has opened.
Livingston's and J. Magnin's plan to
open soon.
The entire shopping center proj
ect is moving along on schedule and
will be completed by March of 1956
when the Emporium readies for bus
iness. Fifty stores in all will be es
tablished on the 55-acre lot.
INDUSTRIAL TRACT
The Stanford Tight industrial tract
features a new look this fall. Gen
eral Electric has finished a 100 per
cent expansion, a 10,000-foot addi
tion made necessary by GE's rapid
progress in microwave research.
Two book publishers, Scott Fores
man & Co. and Houghton-Mifflin,
have completed their plants. The
concerns are neighbors on Califor
nia Avenue. The former built on
10,000 square feet and the latter on
6,000 square feet, with a warehouse
on 20,000 square feet.


BEFORE Looking southeast fiom Hoover Tower is a view of the prospective dorm sites before
work began last year on Ray Lyman Wilbur Hall and on the Stern and Crothers additions. In
the foreground is fhe original Crothers Hall, in the upper left are Toyon and Branner Halls, and
in the upper right is Stern Hall. Work was rushed on all the buildings. Wilbur, for example,
normally an 18-month job, was completed in 12 months.


AND AFTER—In the same view from Hoover Tower today, just a little over a year later, the
changing campus is evident. Complete except for finishing touches are Ray Lyman Wilbur
Hall, in the middle of the picture at the top, and Crothers Memorial Hall, behind Crothers Hall
whi-h is in the immediate foreground. In the upper right can be seen Stern Hall and a portion
of the three-story addition which is nearing completion. Wilbur houses 704 men; Crothers, 156,
will be completed in a few weeks. Stern will house over 200, nearly doubling the present ca
pacity of the modern dormitory. Encina is now being used to house the men who will move into
Stern winter quarter.
