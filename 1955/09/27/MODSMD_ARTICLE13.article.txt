# Farm's Fifteenth Literary Magazine To Make Its Debut in December
## 
### 
The fifteenth in a long and thus far .ill-fated line of Stanford
literary magazines will make its debut in December.
After 14 unsuccessful attempts —enough to discourage most
anyone but Editor Linda Lovelace and Faculty Adviser Wilfred H.
Stone—Stanford's sleeping literati may yet get the answer to their

'dreams: a full-fledged, financially
sound quarterly litorary review.
Stanford has long been in the dol
drums of college literary circles. The I
first Farm literary magazine, "Se- j
quoia," was founded before the turn j
of the century. It collapsed soon
after.
LAST FAILURE
"Viewpoint," Stanford's last liter- |
ary effort, foundered in the sea of |
student apathy in 1952.
Now, backed by a financial grant J
from the English Department, Stone,
Miss Lovelace, and others are try
ing again—but this time with a sub
stantially better outlook for success
than their predecessors ever en
joyed.
The new magazine, the name of
which is as yet undecided, will be
the first to receive financial back
ing, assuring it of at least a year's
publication.
CONTENTS
The magazine will contain two or
three short stories, a "handful" of
poems, illustrations, and a number
of articles "based on fact."
Undergraduate students inter
ested in writing for the magazine
are urged to submit their work, ac
cording to Miss Lovelace. Deadline
for contributions is Oct. 14.
Interviews for positions on the
editorial board and on the art, busi
ness, and publicity staffs will be
held from 1 to 2 and from 3 to 5,
Thursday and Friday afternoons, in
Room 53 of the English Department.
