The Daily is pretty much the same old Daily.
Hut this is the beginning of a new school year
and the beginning of the term of a new Edito
rial Board. And with each new Editorial Board
there will undoubtedly be a different editorial
policy. Thus we will outline the policy of the
current volume, number 128:
The Daily, essentially, is a campus newspa
per. Its first responsibility is to present campus
news. This is a function no other paper can
adequately perform. We will endeavor to
cover all campus news sources and include
vvery item of student interest which space lim
itations permit.
for that reason, national and international
newe which does not have a close campus tie
in will be summarized in a special page-one
eolumn. Only exceptionally important stories
'/rill stray to the regular news space on page
one.
Another important fact: The Daily is an or
gan of the Associated Students. Thus the paper
must serve the students and represent them.
The Daily will provide an opportunity for the
studeYits to hear all viewpoints of any contro
versy. The Daily will interview both sides of
]*auy issues and will print letters in the "Cam
pus Opinion" column as well.
The Daily is controlled financially by the
A.SSU student government and technically
could be controlled editorially by the Legisla
turo, ihe owners' representative body. This
will bo resisted at all cost. We feel that The

Daily must remain independent of the Legis
lature in order to analyze its policies objective
ly and to report the meetings objectively to the
students.
Whenever The Daily takes an editorial stand
—and it will always be taken in the editorial
columns, not in the news columns—that stand
will be taken by the entire Editorial Board in
conjunction with the opinions of the rest of the
staff, and will be based on what the Editorial
Board feels is in the best interests of the stu
dents and the University. The Daily will pro
vide ample space for opinions which conflict
with its editorial stand.
Again we emphasize that The Daily is a cam
pus newspaper; its primary goal will be to in
form and serve the students.
good luck
During the summer Stanford appointed two
new administrative officials. Frederick E. Ter
man has undertaken the duties of Provost, as
sisting President Sterling in academic matters,
and has retained his position as Dean of the
School of Engineering. William G. Craig has
arrived from Kansas State to become Dean of
Men.
The University has continued its record of
placing outstanding educators in its top posi
tions. We wish both men success in their new
jobs.
