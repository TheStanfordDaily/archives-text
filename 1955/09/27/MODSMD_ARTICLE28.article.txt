Well, today's the last day to pay the piper
in the Pavilion. Reg is coming down to the
wire and the little girls with the green eye
shadow are still licking their lips. "Checkbook
to checkbook, diamond studs, sons of the
wealthy few . .

For a good look at the new women plus the
dubious attractions of unloaded punch, take
the spots off your celluloid dickey and paddle
over to Cur President's home this afternoon.
He and his wife are having a reception for new
fHudenis and, if you don't get shunted up to
the balcony, you can shake Dr. Sterling's hand.
Come early, it gets a little soiled and limp
• round 4:30.

Here's news for all you culture vultures (you
decide what kind): Tuesday Evening Series is
not, repeat NOT, scheduled to go before the
cameras till next week, so don't go breaking
the doors down at Mem Aud tonight. Anyone
for a round of "Authors"?
Here's a thought though: If you've seen "The
fihrike" and Frank won't serve you, why not
give a thought to the Reg Dance tonight? Of
• course, the Theta Xi Jazz Band will be there,
but ". . . in every life a little rain must fall."

Unless there's a beach party cooking or the
Pre-Reg strain is laying thee low, you ought
to plan to be on Quad tomorrow. Yeah, classes
Login, and a full lecture the first day should
gladden your prof's heart and make his face
to shine—if he runs out of IBM cards the first
day he'll look good to the chairman, and this
will make him happy. Gotta play the angles
around here.

If the Regatta didn't leave you sore but sated,
and you need a lift, hie yourself over to Mem
Church tomorrow night about 9:30 for the first
of the weekly meditation services. 'Tis one
of the be«ft deals around here, and we kid you
not.

Seems Joseph Magnin is opening a new store
Friday in the new Stanford Shopping Center
and, bless his generous heart, he's giving up
the first day's gate receipts for Stanford schol
arships. So, if you need a new dress or a thing
umabobble or something, and even if you
don't, go on over and give a look. The walk'll
be good for your figure.

Been worrying about your balance lately?
Chances are it wasn't that 59-cent applejack
Sunday night, but MYSTIC FORCES. Anyway,
T. Gold, Esguire (from the merrie old Royal
Observatory), will be on exhibit in Room 372
Friday at 4:15, and he's all worked up about
"The Instability of the Earth's Axis of Rotation."
It's free, and everybody's invited. Snag: no
refreshments.

Clutch your little donation from Roos Bros,
tightly and otherwise make plans to join the
throng at Stanford Stadium Saturday for the
big tussle with Ohio State. Word's out that it
otta be a slaughter. HEY! HEAR THIS though: !
the game time has been changed to 1 p.m.
Seems nasty ol' NBC was going to pick up its
cameras and go home unless Uncle A 1 changed
the hour. Course, all the ducats and all the ads
say 2 o'c. is the witching hour, but who is
Stanford to argue with the National Broadcast-1
ing Company? After all. Also hmmmph.

FLICKS NOTE: "Man on the Eiffel Tower" is
the title of Sunday night's offering. Stars C.
Laughton and F. Tone. Can't remember if it's
funny or a spine-tingler, it's been so long . . .
For 20 cents, though, how can you lose?

SLEEPER DEPT: Wind up your alarm clocks,
boys, and tune those noise-makers, there's a
rouser coming up. Thursday at 4, in Room 372,
you can hear all about "Physical Optics Ap
proximations to Diffraction Problems." Wake
the town and tell the people, hey.
