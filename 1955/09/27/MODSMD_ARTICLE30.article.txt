### 
Along with the tides of new and returning Farm students en
gulfing the dormitories, Row and fraternity houses in the past
few days, many new directors, assistant directors, and resident
assistants arrived much less conspicuously to greet the new ar
rivals.
Mrs. Ruby Hughes, newly initiated into the way of life at a coed
dorm, lias become director ut Ven- k

tura Hall. Finding her duties "very
enjoyable," Mrs. Hughes has also
found that her position is much as
she expected it to be.
Although never employed at Stan
ford before, Mrs. Hughes is not a
stranger to the campus. She re
ceived the A.B. degree from Stan
ford and has returned sum
mers to attend an annual confer
ence for high school teachers held

As the frosh class forsook old En
cina to hang up its shingle at new

formerly director at Encina, packed
her bags to accompany the new
frosh.
