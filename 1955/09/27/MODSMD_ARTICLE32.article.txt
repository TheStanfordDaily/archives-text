# Movie Version of 'Shrike' Loses Stage Impact, But Still Scores High
## 
### RICHARD MENDE 
"The Shrike" is a worth-while film
but somehow, in its adaptation from
the Pulitzer prize-winning stage pro
duction, it has lost some of its im
pact.
The story concerns a talented di
rector, pluyed by Jose Ferrer—re
creating the original role — whose
wife, June Allyson, works to under
mine his confidence in order to com-

pensate for her
own frustrated
ambitions. In the
story she succeeds
completely, caus
ing her victim ar
tistic and financial
disaster; he turns
to another woman
for sympathy, Joy

Page, but is final
ly driven to a suicide attempt and
ends up in a psychiatric ward. He
has the tragic choice of continuing
the demoralizing and degrading life
in an asylum or returning, under
custody, to his wife.
All this is in the film version, and
Jose Ferrer plays his role intelli
gently and sensitively, but, playing
next to Miss Allyson, his work loses
in effectiveness. Instead of a shrike
who rips and tears her victim, June

| Allyson seems almost harmless, a
good girl who has made a mistake
and been perfectly nasty; she was
just a little mixed up and will do
better in the future.
The tension built up in the origi
nal by the incessant, tortuous efforts
of a frighteningly hateful woman
just never comes about in the film
! version. Perhaps Miss Allyson is too
used to robust-American-girl parts
to accommodate herself to playing
a shrike. The ending of the movie,
changed from the original, is plausi
ble and suits Miss Allyson's playing;
it loses tremendously in impact.
Other things in the production just
don't come off. Like the flashback
| scene in which Ferrer decides to
| commit suicide. The discovery that
he was unable to afford dessert was
j supposed to trigger off the suicide
attempt. As the scene is directed,
instead of feeling pity, one is tempt
| ed to ask: so what? In general, how
! ever, the directing is intelligently
and effectively done.
Joy Page gives a pleasing per
formance, and the patients in the
asylum all do good work. With the
interesting story that "The Shrike"
is, and the commendable acting job
by Jose Ferrer, the picture is well
! worth seeing.

"The Shrike" is a worth-while film
but somehow, in its adaptation from
the Pulitzer prize-winning stage pro
duction, it has lost some of its im
pact.
The story concerns a talented di
rector, pluyed by Jose Ferrer—re
creating the original role — whose
wife, June Allyson, works to under
mine his confidence in order to com-

pensate for her
own frustrated
ambitions. In the
story she succeeds
completely, caus
ing her victim ar
tistic and financial
disaster; he turns
to another woman
for sympathy, Joy

Page, but is final
ly driven to a suicide attempt and
ends up in a psychiatric ward. He
has the tragic choice of continuing
the demoralizing and degrading life
in an asylum or returning, under
custody, to his wife.
All this is in the film version, and
Jose Ferrer plays his role intelli
gently and sensitively, but, playing
next to Miss Allyson, his work loses
in effectiveness. Instead of a shrike
who rips and tears her victim, June

| Allyson seems almost harmless, a
good girl who has made a mistake
and been perfectly nasty; she was
just a little mixed up and will do
better in the future.
The tension built up in the origi
nal by the incessant, tortuous efforts
of a frighteningly hateful woman
just never comes about in the film
! version. Perhaps Miss Allyson is too
used to robust-American-girl parts
to accommodate herself to playing
a shrike. The ending of the movie,
changed from the original, is plausi
ble and suits Miss Allyson's playing;
it loses tremendously in impact.
Other things in the production just
don't come off. Like the flashback
| scene in which Ferrer decides to
| commit suicide. The discovery that
he was unable to afford dessert was
j supposed to trigger off the suicide
attempt. As the scene is directed,
instead of feeling pity, one is tempt
| ed to ask: so what? In general, how
! ever, the directing is intelligently
and effectively done.
