# EIGHT ACTIVE WEEKS
## Enthusiasm and Busy Agenda Spark Farm's Leisurely Summer Quarter 
### EDA MENDELS Associate Editor, The Daily 
Summer is the casual, leisure
ly quarter at Stanford. But sum
mer 1955 had a full schedule of
educational and recreational ac
tivities in addition to classes.
School lasted only eight weeks, j
[ and the enrollment was just short
! of two thousand, but those who were
here availed themselves of the many
opportunities Stanford and the sum
mer weather provided. For many j
the usual "See ya on Quad" was re
placed by a cheery "See you ut the
pool."
An enthusiastic student body and
an active Excom, headed by Jerry j
Messner, combined to make the us
ual summer affairs unusually sue- j
cessful, breaking previous attend
| ance records.
ALL-CAMPUS RECEPTION
Registration lines were practically
nonexistent, but patient groups j
waited outside Bowman Alumni
House at the all-campus reception j
to shake hands and chat with Presi
dent Sterling and other members of
the University administration and I
top ASSU officers.
Music was not lacking; Marais
and Miranda, internationally known
folksinging stars, entertained a full
house at Mem Aud with their South
African ditties, Bantu chants, and
old European songs. The Chamber
Music Institute appeared in concert,
and the Stanford Symphony Or
chestra performed on the Tuesday
Evening Series program.
FOUR DRAMA PRODUCTIONS
The Drama Department offered
Stanford four unusual productions.
With three artists-in-residence and
a large cast of students, they pre
sented "Cyrano de Bergerac," "The
Cretan Woman" by Robinson Jef
fers, Tennessee Williams' "Camino
Real" (which those in the know
I were careful to pronounce "Camino
Reel), and Aristophanes' novel so

lution to continual wars, "Lysis
tiata."
Free v/atermelon attracted many
to the Women's Gym fieid when the
ASSU offered a watermelon feed
one fine Saturday afternoon. They
attended '"Heat Wave," all-campus
dance at Toyon, and "Mer Magic,"
the AWS dance at Lag.
Open house at Lag was another
popular affair, with Lag women and
their yuests roasting marshmallows,
singing, and dancing in the Inner
Court.
The School of Education organized
several activities for its students,
who comprised half the total .sum
mer student body. Pleased with the
large turnout for their picnic, Ed

Council provided coffee hours for
; the School. Institutes came uiul
went, crowding the loLhy with mini
| atvires of model schools.
A distinguished visitor was U Nu,
prime minister of Burma, who
l toured the campus and admired the
view from Hoover Tower.

ALL-CAMPUS RECEPTION
Registration lines were practically
nonexistent, but patient groups j
waited outside Bowman Alumni
House at the all-campus reception j
to shake hands and chat with Presi
dent Sterling and other members of
the University administration and I
top ASSU officers.
Music was not lacking; Marais
and Miranda, internationally known
folksinging stars, entertained a full
house at Mem Aud with their South
African ditties, Bantu chants, and
old European songs. The Chamber
Music Institute appeared in concert,
and the Stanford Symphony Or
chestra performed on the Tuesday
Evening Series program.
FOUR DRAMA PRODUCTIONS
The Drama Department offered
Stanford four unusual productions.
With three artists-in-residence and
a large cast of students, they pre
sented "Cyrano de Bergerac," "The
Cretan Woman" by Robinson Jef
fers, Tennessee Williams' "Camino
Real" (which those in the know
I were careful to pronounce "Camino
Reel), and Aristophanes' novel so

lution to continual wars, "Lysis
tiata."
Free v/atermelon attracted many
to the Women's Gym fieid when the
ASSU offered a watermelon feed
one fine Saturday afternoon. They
attended '"Heat Wave," all-campus
dance at Toyon, and "Mer Magic,"
the AWS dance at Lag.
Open house at Lag was another
popular affair, with Lag women and
their yuests roasting marshmallows,
singing, and dancing in the Inner
Court.
The School of Education organized
several activities for its students,
who comprised half the total .sum
mer student body. Pleased with the
large turnout for their picnic, Ed

Council provided coffee hours for
; the School. Institutes came uiul
went, crowding the loLhy with mini
| atvires of model schools.
A distinguished visitor was U Nu,
prime minister of Burma, who
l toured the campus and admired the
view from Hoover Tower.
Summer is the casual, leisure
ly quarter at Stanford. But sum
mer 1955 had a full schedule of
educational and recreational ac
tivities in addition to classes.
School lasted only eight weeks, j
[ and the enrollment was just short
! of two thousand, but those who were
here availed themselves of the many
opportunities Stanford and the sum
mer weather provided. For many j
the usual "See ya on Quad" was re
placed by a cheery "See you ut the
pool."
An enthusiastic student body and
an active Excom, headed by Jerry j
Messner, combined to make the us
ual summer affairs unusually sue- j
cessful, breaking previous attend
| ance records.
