# Trustees Insure Pastoral Look In Long-Range Farm Building Plan
## 
### 
The University trustees, engaged
iii a long-range program of develop

ine Stanford's surplus lr.nds for rev
enue, have taken two steps to guar
antee that the rural and secluded
atmosphere of the campus—which
has earned for Stanford the nick
name of "The Farm" —will not be
disturbed.
They have ruled that the area
reserved for educational use be set
I at an ample 3,820 acres, leaving ap
proximately 5,000 acres for the land
development program.
And they have adopted as poiicy
that there shall be no construction
on hilltops and ridges within the
campus boundaries that form sky
lines or on the slope of the foothills
which rise behind Junipero Serra
Boulevard and furnish the "back
drop" of the campus.
The area reserved for educational
j purposes forms one of the largest
J college campuses in the United
States. About 1,200 acres, less than
one-third, is currently in use.
The boundary of the campus pre
serve runs along El Camino Real
from Quarry Road (by the Palo
I Alto Hospital) to Stanford Avenue,
then along Stanford Avenue to the
top of College Terrace.
It follows a prolongation of the
back line of College Terrace to Page
Mill Road, out Page Mill to the
boundary of Stanford land, across
to Alpine Road, and along Alpine,
Sand Hill Road and the new section
of Willow Road. It jumps from
Willow to Quarry along the Palo
Alto city limits, then returns to the
starting point at Quarry and El
Camino.
