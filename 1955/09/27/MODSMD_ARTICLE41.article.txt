### 
Contrary to last spr in g's an
nouncement, Stanford students will
not have their pictures on their stu
dent body cards this year, Assistant
Registrar Elmer C. Wagner an
nounced recently.
Due to the late arrival of neces
sary photographic equipment, the
University will not be able to put
the new system into practice until
winter or possibly spring quarter.
Wagner said.
This year's cards will differ from
last year's however, in that they
will be printed on thinner paper and
will have a cashier's stamp tab which
may be folded under, rather than
being detached.
Also, the numbered "privileges"
will not run along the lower edge
of the card, but along the right-hand
side.
