# Jr.-Sr. Reunion To Be Tomorrow
## 
### 
For the first time in many years,
two classes are getting together to
stage a joint reunion.
The classes of '56 and '57 will meet
tomorrow from 3:30 to 6 p.m. at
Mangini's Barn, behind Rudy's Al
pine Inn.
Entertainment will be furnished
by Bob Scobey's "Frisco Jazz Band,"
which has appeared locally at the
Italian Village and the Tin Angel.
Tickets will be sold at the door
for 25 cents, and rides will be avail
able from the Post Office at 4 p.m.
The event is being held on the first
day of the quarter to avoid study
conflicts. Members of all classes are
invited to attend.
