# Oregon State Upsets Indians En Opening Conference Game
## Orangemen Triumph, 10-0; Stanford Wins Statistics Battle But Not Game 
### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
An alert, aggressive Oregon State football team pulled one of
the major upsets in a weekend of football upsets when they
stopped Stanford 10-0 in Portland last Saturday night.
The Beavers, under new coach Tommy Prothro, were fired up
from the start. They gave ground to Stanford's running attack in

the middle ofc the field but wheneverH
the Indians neared the goal, Oregon
State braced and held.
Stanford rolled up 363 net yards
and 23 first downs to the Beavers'
150 and seven and controlled the
ball on 89 of the game's 123 plays but
just could not score through a com
bination of tough OSC defense and
tough breaks.
Three times the Indians were on
the verge of scoring and once actu
ally did score only to have the play
called back because of a penalty.
PENALTY KILLS DRIVE
In the first half, on a play origi
nating from the Beaver 27, Indian
halfback Ernie Dorn'ran to Oregon
State's nine but the play and drive
were both killed on A clipping pen
alty . Just before half-time Stanford
had the ball on OSC's nine with
fourth down and one yard to go.
Fullback Bill Tarr, seeing the line
jam up in front of him, tried to get
the yard by going over the top but
he was caught and rolled back down
short of the first down.
In the fourth quarter the Indians
were twice more frustrated. Quar
terback Jack Douglas threw a 24-
yard touchdown pass to Jerry An
gove but the hankies were down
and Stanford, instead of a touch
down, got 15 yards for holding.
Late in the quarter, a Douglas to
Jerry Beatie pass gave Stanford a
first down on the Beaver two-yard
line. Four plays later, Stanford was
still on the two as Oregon State put
up a magnificent goal line stand.
STANFORD MISTAKES HURT
Stanford mistakes set up both
OSC scores. Tarr fumbled on the
Beaver 49 and OSC quarterback Ron
Siegrist recovered. On the first play
Beaver tailback Joe Francis stepped
back and fired a long pass. Tailback
Sam Wesley, 145-pound speedburn
er, turned on the jets, ran right by
the Stanford secondary, caught the
pass on the 10, and scored un
touched. OSC missed their first con
version attempt but a Stanford pen
alty gave them another chance and
this time the ball was kicked right
through.
The Beavers padded their touch
down with a third-quarter field goal.
This was set up by a Stanford hold
ing penalty which gave Oregon
State the ball on the Indian eight.
The Beavers were stopped so Ted
Searle kicked the three-pointer.

Stanford's passing attack which
blazed against COP in the first game
of the season wa> nullified against
Oregon State. Stanford quarter
backs Jerry Gustafson, John Brodie,
and Douglas completed only 13 out
of 34 passes attempted and had five
intercepted, two by the pint-sized
Wesley.
In addition to the five intercep
tions, Stanford fumbled into Oregon
State's hands three times. For this
the Beavers must be given credit for
they were tackling hard and in
swarms.
Oregon State had a deadly weapon
in the punting of tailbacks Francis
and Ray Westphall. The two punted
eight times for an average of 45
yards. On one occasion, Francis
booted one out of his own end zone
that went GO yards on the fiy. Three
times the Stanford safety men had
to turn and go back to get under
the ball and twice the Beavers got
out of a hole with long quick kicks.
OSC FIGHTS
Oregon State, by their sheer fight,
deserved to win the game. They
showed crisp blocking and tackling
and didn't give an inch when the go
ing got rough. Stanford, on the oth
er hand, was oil in this game. The
passing was inaccurate and the line
could not move the Beaver line
when the yards were really needed.
The Indians are going to have to
recover the pattern they had against
COP before tackling Ohio State this
Saturday.

intercepted, two by the pint-sized
Wesley.
In addition to the five intercep
tions, Stanford fumbled into Oregon
State's hands three times. For this
the Beavers must be given credit for
they were tackling hard and in
swarms.
Oregon State had a deadly weapon
in the punting of tailbacks Francis
and Ray Westphall. The two punted
eight times for an average of 45
yards. On one occasion, Francis
booted one out of his own end zone
that went GO yards on the fiy. Three
times the Stanford safety men had
to turn and go back to get under
the ball and twice the Beavers got
out of a hole with long quick kicks.
OSC FIGHTS
Oregon State, by their sheer fight,
deserved to win the game. They
showed crisp blocking and tackling
and didn't give an inch when the go
ing got rough. Stanford, on the oth
er hand, was oil in this game. The
passing was inaccurate and the line
could not move the Beaver line
when the yards were really needed.
The Indians are going to have to
recover the pattern they had against
COP before tackling Ohio State this
Saturday.
An alert, aggressive Oregon State football team pulled one of
the major upsets in a weekend of football upsets when they
stopped Stanford 10-0 in Portland last Saturday night.
The Beavers, under new coach Tommy Prothro, were fired up
from the start. They gave ground to Stanford's running attack in

the middle ofc the field but wheneverH
the Indians neared the goal, Oregon
State braced and held.
Stanford rolled up 363 net yards
and 23 first downs to the Beavers'
150 and seven and controlled the
ball on 89 of the game's 123 plays but
just could not score through a com
bination of tough OSC defense and
tough breaks.
Three times the Indians were on
the verge of scoring and once actu
ally did score only to have the play
called back because of a penalty.
PENALTY KILLS DRIVE
In the first half, on a play origi
nating from the Beaver 27, Indian
halfback Ernie Dorn'ran to Oregon
State's nine but the play and drive
were both killed on A clipping pen
alty . Just before half-time Stanford
had the ball on OSC's nine with
fourth down and one yard to go.
Fullback Bill Tarr, seeing the line
jam up in front of him, tried to get
the yard by going over the top but
he was caught and rolled back down
short of the first down.
In the fourth quarter the Indians
were twice more frustrated. Quar
terback Jack Douglas threw a 24-
yard touchdown pass to Jerry An
gove but the hankies were down
and Stanford, instead of a touch
down, got 15 yards for holding.
Late in the quarter, a Douglas to
Jerry Beatie pass gave Stanford a
first down on the Beaver two-yard
line. Four plays later, Stanford was
still on the two as Oregon State put
up a magnificent goal line stand.
STANFORD MISTAKES HURT
Stanford mistakes set up both
OSC scores. Tarr fumbled on the
Beaver 49 and OSC quarterback Ron
Siegrist recovered. On the first play
Beaver tailback Joe Francis stepped
back and fired a long pass. Tailback
Sam Wesley, 145-pound speedburn
er, turned on the jets, ran right by
the Stanford secondary, caught the
pass on the 10, and scored un
touched. OSC missed their first con
version attempt but a Stanford pen
alty gave them another chance and
this time the ball was kicked right
through.
The Beavers padded their touch
down with a third-quarter field goal.
This was set up by a Stanford hold
ing penalty which gave Oregon
State the ball on the Indian eight.
The Beavers were stopped so Ted
Searle kicked the three-pointer.

Stanford's passing attack which
blazed against COP in the first game
of the season wa> nullified against
Oregon State. Stanford quarter
backs Jerry Gustafson, John Brodie,

of 34 passes attempted and had five
intercepted, two by the pint-sized
Wesley.
