# Buckeyes ‘Can be Had’ Chuck Tells Grid Writers

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 2(5 (UP)
—Coach Chuck Taylor of Stanford,
looking anything but distracted by
his team's upset at the hands of
lightly regarded Oregon State, said
today he believes that Ohio State
"can be had" in this Saturday's na
tionally televised game with the In
dians.
Taylor earlier told the Northern
California Football Writers' Associ
ation, "We may not be the ones to
do it," then later amended this state
ment by asking the reporters to
knock out that qualification.
"Our kids have the ability to take
any team we play," the optimistic
Taylor declared, but agreed that
halfback Howard (Hopalong) Cas
sady of Ohio State was great.
TAYLOR INTERVIEWS MYERS
In a novel twist, Taylor also took
over the job of interviewing Coach
Jack (Moose) Myers of College of
the Pacific, who addressed the re
porters from Stockton via an am
plified long-distance hookup.
"We kept the pressure on pretty
good," Myers told Taylor while de
scribing how the underdog Tigers
held Purdue to a 14-7 victory. "We
gang-tackled the way you're sup
posed to do and dominated the sec
ond half after Purdue dominated
the first."
Myers wisecracked that the Pa
cific Coast Conference should stand
aside and let San Jose State go to.
Bowl if the Spartans, who
beat Hawaii 34-0, continue to show
well for the rest of the year.
Under Taylor's questioning, Myers
said that he expected a tough game
Saturday night against Cincinnati
despite the Bearcats' 15-14 loss to
Dayton.
WALDORF EXPECTING TOUGHIE
Lynn (Pappy) Waldorf of Cali
fornia, who will be seeking his first
win of the season when the Bears
play Pennsylvania at Berkeley, said
he was not underestimating the
Quakers even if they no longer, have
spring practice.
He said he would use a lot of
players this Saturday as he contin
ues to try to find out how his in
experienced club stacks up.
UCLA Coach Henry (Red) San
ders said that the Maryland team
that beat UCLA last Saturday was
the toughest defensive squad he had
ever encountered in all his years of
coaching.
The UCLA coach gave Maryland
credit for being "the better team"
but he also pointed out that a team

which can prepare for a single game
all year and then throw an entire
season's effort into that game has an
edge over squads that must prepare
from week to week for each clash.
"What has happened to us is what
happens wheri?ver you play a better
team," Sanders said. "We got beat.
The team that makes the fewest
mistakes wins and Maryland made
less."
Coach Jess Hill of Southern Cali
fornia, crosstown rival of UCLA,
told the Southern California football
writers that he honestly felt San
ders' team would win when he said
last week that it would beat Mary
land "in a walk."
"I couldn't conceive of any team
pushing UCLA around," Hill said.
"Maryland proved it has one of the
finest football teams in the country
when it bottled up the UCLA run
ning game."
