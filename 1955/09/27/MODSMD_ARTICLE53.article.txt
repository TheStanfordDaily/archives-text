# Cards Drill For Buckeye Contest
## 
### 
Both offense and defense were
stressed yesterday as the Cards went
through their first practice session
since being "upset by Oregon State
Saturday. Coach Taylor drilled the
Indians against plays which Ohio
State is expected to run here this
week.
Six players were not suited up
because of injuries. Halfback Lou
Valli, tackle Chris Plain, and end
Joel Freis are definitely out of the
Buckeye tilt Saturday.
Halfback Gordy Young, center
Don Geddes, and end Stave Docter
are expected to see limited action.
Young has been suffering from a
broken rib, while Geddes has an in
jured leg and Docter is having foot
trouble.
Back in uniform after missing the
Beaver contest because of injuries
were tackle John Kidd, guard Walt
Eagle, and Jack Taylor, halfback.
Several candidates turned out for
the first time yesterday. Among them
were Tom Kemp, Tony Serra, John
Harland, Jerry Hitchman, Dave
Bramble, Jerry Dunn. Larry Bishop,
Larry Williams, Rufus Jeffris, Carl
Fehring, Ken Savio and Ken Woods.
Woods, all-Northern California in
soccer last spring, has decided to
give the gridiron a fling. The husky
booter has been working out at a
guard spot.
