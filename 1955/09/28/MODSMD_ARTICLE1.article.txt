ELECTRONICS LAB EXPANSIONâ€”Gifts from Gilfillan Brothers Inc. and the Hewlett-Packard
Company have made possible a $90,000 expansion of the Stanford Electronics Research Labora
tory. Bricklayers here work on the extension of the Hewlett-Packard wing of the laboratory. A
new Gilfillan wing is also under construction. The expansion, construction of which began last
summer, will increase the present floor space of the laboratory by approximately one-fourth.
