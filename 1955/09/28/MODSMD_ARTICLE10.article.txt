# FOR LAB
## Two Gifts Finance Expansion 
### 
Construction is under way on
a $90,C00 expansion of the Stan
ford Electronics Research Labo
ratory, financed with gifts from
two electronics manufacturers.
"The extensions will remove the
worst aspects of our present con
gestion," Frederick E. Terman, Uni
versity Provost and Dean of the
School of Engineering, said recently.
The laboratory's floor space will be
feet, or by approximately one-fourth
its present size.
"We hope to move in before the
year is out," the Provost added.
The donors are GilfUlan Brothers
Inc. of Los Angeles and Hewlett-
Packard Company of Palo Alto.
Construction of a new Gilfillan wing
on the north end of the laboratory
and extension of its Hewlett-Pack
ard wing on the south will begin
next week.
STANFORD ALUMNI
The donor companies have close
ties with Stanford. Sennet W. Gil
fillan, a former Stanford baseball
team captain of the class of 1912,
founded the Los Angeles firm with
his brother before World War I.
Gilfillan Brothers Inc. became the
leading Western manufacturer of
home radios between the two wars.
During World War II Gilfillan led
the nation in producing GCA
(Ground Control Approach) radar
equipment to assist airplane land
ings under conditions of poor visi
bility.
Earlier gifts from Gilfillan have
provided engineering scholarships at
Stanford, and funds for a program
of instruction and research in tran
sistors. The transistor is a rugged,
simple device which promises to
revolutionize radio by taking the
place of delicate radio tubes and
other components.
After graduation from Stanford,
William R. Hewlett and David Pack
ard started business 15 years ago in
the latter's back-yard garage in Palo
Alto.
Now Hewlett - Packard employs
more than 700 persons, many of
them Stanford graduates. In addi
tion to building the laboratory's stu
dent instruction wing in 1951, the
company supports two engineering
fellowships.
Construction of the Gilfillan wing
is so planned that it can be further
extended at some future date, the
Provost said. It is expected even
tually to match the Hewlett-Pack
ard wing in length, making the floor
plan of the building resemble a huge
letter "E." An expansion of the lab
oratory's central wing was carried
out in 1952.

founded the Los Angeles firm with
his brother before World War I.
Gilfillan Brothers Inc. became the
leading Western manufacturer of
home radios between the two wars.
During World War II Gilfillan led
the nation in producing GCA
(Ground Control Approach) radar
equipment to assist airplane land
ings under conditions of poor visi
bility.
Earlier gifts from Gilfillan have
provided engineering scholarships at
Stanford, and funds for a program
of instruction and research in tran
sistors. The transistor is a rugged,
simple device which promises to
revolutionize radio by taking the
place of delicate radio tubes and
other components.
After graduation from Stanford,
William R. Hewlett and David Pack
ard started business 15 years ago in
the latter's back-yard garage in Palo
Alto.
Now Hewlett - Packard employs
more than 700 persons, many of
them Stanford graduates. In addi
tion to building the laboratory's stu
dent instruction wing in 1951, the
company supports two engineering
fellowships.
Construction of the Gilfillan wing
is so planned that it can be further
extended at some future date, the
Provost said. It is expected even
tually to match the Hewlett-Pack
ard wing in length, making the floor
plan of the building resemble a huge
letter "E." An expansion of the lab
oratory's central wing was carried
out in 1952.
Construction is under way on
a $90,C00 expansion of the Stan
ford Electronics Research Labo
ratory, financed with gifts from
two electronics manufacturers.
"The extensions will remove the
worst aspects of our present con
gestion," Frederick E. Terman, Uni
versity Provost and Dean of the
School of Engineering, said recently.
The laboratory's floor space will be
feet, or by approximately one-fourth
its present size.
"We hope to move in before the
year is out," the Provost added.
The donors are GilfUlan Brothers
Inc. of Los Angeles and Hewlett-
Packard Company of Palo Alto.
Construction of a new Gilfillan wing
on the north end of the laboratory
and extension of its Hewlett-Pack
ard wing on the south will begin
next week.

The donor companies have close

team captain of the class of 1912,
