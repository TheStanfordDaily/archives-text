officers have started plans for
this year's ASSU program.
Heading the ASSU will be Presi
dent George Ralph, whose unique
campaign last spring helped draw a
record 60 per cent of the student
body to the polls. Ralph, a senior
majoring in history, advocated a
"reform" of student government,
with emphasis on reduction of the
number of ASSU committees.
This fall Ralph has expressed in
terest in the completion of plans for
the new Union building. He would
favor setting up a "college union"
organization, patterned after those
found on other campuses, to plan
activities in the Union and co-ordi
nate other campus social functions.
The ASSU vice - president, in
charge of scheduling and co-ordi
nating all campus social activities,
is Jerry Fitzgerald. Miss Fitzgerald, |
