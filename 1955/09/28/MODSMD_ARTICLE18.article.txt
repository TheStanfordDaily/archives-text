LONG MAY SHE WAVE—The United States flag will be raised
and lowered daily on the new flagpole put up in front of the
Main Library. The 50-foot steel pole, a gift from the class of
'58, was erected during summer quarter without fanfare. Dedi
cation ceremonies may be scheduled later this quarter if the
sophomore class wishes to staqe them. The Library site was
chosen as the "center of student life," between the residences,
classrooms, and Cellar. The Stanford Police Department hikes
care of the flag raising.
