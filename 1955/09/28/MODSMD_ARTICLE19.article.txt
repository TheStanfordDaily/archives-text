# Magnin's Will Preview New Store Opening
## 
### 
Highlight of Friday night's fashion
show at Joseph Magnin's will be a
preview of the opening of the second
shop in Stanford's new $5V2 million
shopping center.
The fashions will be displayed for
the benefit of the Stanford scholar
ship fund and will be featured in a
two-hour show from 7:30 to 9:30
p.m. The program will also include
music and refreshments.
Tickets for the show, sponsored
by the Stanford Clubs of Palo Alto,
San Francisco and San Jose, are now
on sale at the Joseph Magnin store
in Palo Alto and at the door on the
night of the show. Tickets may also
be obtained at the Bowman Alumni
House on campus and at Rickey's
Studio Inn, on El Camino highway.
Price is $1 to students and $1.75 to
non-students.
This new Magnin store is twelfth
in a chain with the lower half being
constructed of imported Italian mar
ble. The store's parking lot has fa
cilities for 4,000 cars.
Mrs. Wallace Sterling, the presi
dent's wife, and Mrs. Allen Charles,
member of the University Board of
Trustees, are general chairmen of
the event.
The scholarships to be adminis
tared through the proceeds of the
affair will be awarded on the basis
of need as determined by the Stan
ford Scholarship Committee.
