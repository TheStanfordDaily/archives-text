# Three Farm Professors View Political Quandary Presented by Ike's Illness
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Along with a feeling of uni
versal regret, the recent illness
of President Eisenhower has left
the country with a curious puz
zle as to the political prospects
for 1956.
In a Daily interview yesterday of
three political science professors—
Thomas Barclay, Alfred de Grazia
and Robert A. Horn—views were

voiced on the political quandary |
arising from the President's illness
and the fact that it may prevent his
seeking a second term.
Stating that he feels that the Pres
ident will not seek re-election, Dr.
De Grazia believes that "no one will
want to exchange Eisenhower's
health for any kind of a political
victory." Although having heard that
hints at possible hats in the ring
involve Vice-President Nixon, Sen
ator Knowland, California's Gover

nor Knight, Chief Justice Warren,
Governor Stratton of Illinois, and
Harold Stassen, Dr. De Grazia senses
that the candidate on the GOP ticket
will "probably be whomever Tom
Dewey supports." Dewey, he said, is
still very powerful in New York
and is a respected politician.
Dr. de Grazia in a recent trip to
the East heard that Harold Stassen
is the President's top choice, with
Vice-President Nixon placed fourth
on the list.
Dr. Barclay, feeling that it is im- i
possible to predict now what name
will appear on the Republican bal
lot in November of '56, does predict,
though, a "spirited contest among
some half-dozen Republicans."
HAIIRIMAN SUGGESTED
Turning to the question of the
Democratic candidate, both Dr. De
Grazia and Dr. Barclay pointed to
Governor Averill Harriman of New
York as the man to watch.
Recalling that followers of Ten
nessee's Senator Estes Kefauver
were "roughly handled by Stevenson
people in 1952," Dr. De Grazia pre
dicts that Kefauver supporters will
be much more likely to switch over
to the New York governor than to
Adlai Stevenson.
In addition to this, De Grazia sees
a decline in Stevenson's popularity
in the past year and an increase in
Harriman's.
PEACE AND PROSPERITY
Turning to the chances for victory
in November, 1956, Dr. Barclay said
that "peace and prosperity are the
two greatest assets of the party in
power."
One particular facet of the prob
lem arising from the President's ill
ness interested Dr. Horn, assistant
professor of political science and an
expert on constitutional law.
The Constitution, although pro
viding that the Vice-President shall
assume the powers of President if
the latter is unable to discharge the
duties of office, coes not state how
and by whom the inability shall be
declared.
CONGRESS IS JUDGE
"The Constitution is completely
unclear," Dr. Horn stated, "and
leaves to Congress the duty of pro
viding a statute creating criteria for
judging the inability of a President." ;
Citing past instances in which !
Presidents Garfield and Wilson were
ill or incapacitated for long periods j
of time, Dr. Horn reminded that the I
problem created by a President too
ill to as.sum? the duties of office has
not yet been solved by a Congr.es- |
sional statute.

The Constitution, although pro
viding that the Vice-President shall
assume the powers of President if
the latter is unable to discharge the
duties of office, coes not state how
and by whom the inability shall be
declared.
CONGRESS IS JUDGE
"The Constitution is completely
unclear," Dr. Horn stated, "and
leaves to Congress the duty of pro
viding a statute creating criteria for
judging the inability of a President." ;
Citing past instances in which !
Presidents Garfield and Wilson were
ill or incapacitated for long periods j
of time, Dr. Horn reminded that the I
problem created by a President too
ill to as.sum? the duties of office has
not yet been solved by a Congr.es- |
sional statute.
Along with a feeling of uni
versal regret, the recent illness
of President Eisenhower has left
the country with a curious puz
zle as to the political prospects
for 1956.
In a Daily interview yesterday of
three political science professors—
Thomas Barclay, Alfred de Grazia
and Robert A. Horn—views were

voiced on the political quandary |
arising from the President's illness
and the fact that it may prevent his
seeking a second term.
Stating that he feels that the Pres
ident will not seek re-election, Dr.
De Grazia believes that "no one will
want to exchange Eisenhower's
health for any kind of a political
victory." Although having heard that
hints at possible hats in the ring
involve Vice-President Nixon, Sen
ator Knowland, California's Gover

nor Knight, Chief Justice Warren,
Governor Stratton of Illinois, and
Harold Stassen, Dr. De Grazia senses
that the candidate on the GOP ticket
will "probably be whomever Tom
Dewey supports." Dewey, he said, is
still very powerful in New York
and is a respected politician.
Dr. de Grazia in a recent trip to
the East heard that Harold Stassen
is the President's top choice, with
Vice-President Nixon placed fourth
on the list.
Dr. Barclay, feeling that it is im- i
possible to predict now what name
will appear on the Republican bal
lot in November of '56, does predict,
though, a "spirited contest among
some half-dozen Republicans."
HAIIRIMAN SUGGESTED
Turning to the question of the
Democratic candidate, both Dr. De
Grazia and Dr. Barclay pointed to
Governor Averill Harriman of New
York as the man to watch.
Recalling that followers of Ten
nessee's Senator Estes Kefauver
were "roughly handled by Stevenson
people in 1952," Dr. De Grazia pre
dicts that Kefauver supporters will
be much more likely to switch over
to the New York governor than to
Adlai Stevenson.
In addition to this, De Grazia sees
a decline in Stevenson's popularity
in the past year and an increase in
Harriman's.
PEACE AND PROSPERITY
Turning to the chances for victory
in November, 1956, Dr. Barclay said
that "peace and prosperity are the
two greatest assets of the party in
power."
One particular facet of the prob
lem arising from the President's ill
ness interested Dr. Horn, assistant
professor of political science and an
expert on constitutional law.
