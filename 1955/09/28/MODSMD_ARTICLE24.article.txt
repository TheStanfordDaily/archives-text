# quarter's worth
## 
### 
This is the day that summer ends — and
classes begin. This is the day you start to put
i< ;;l quarter's resolutions into practice. Remem
ber last spring when you said that "next quar
ter I'm going to keep up with my assignments
a;ul not try to read the v/hole course the night
before the midterm." And "next quarter I'm
going to start my term paper early so I won't
have to stay up all night before it's due."
Well, this is "next quarter." 4
And this is the time you make still more res
olutions. You won't go to the Sunday Flicks
the jiiqht before your English essay is due.
You will get up for your eight-o'clock every
morning, even on Saturday. You won't go out
on dates in the middle of the week. You will
j.tudy and get good grades.
You will go to the Libe that hour between
your nine and 11 o'clock classes—instead of
(ho Cellar. You won't waste your 30 cents on

the Chappie this month. You will get your Big
Game date in advance—with a girl who'll pay
her share. You will go to the Tuesday Evening
Series lecture once or twice.
Yep, you will hit the bocks in Dead Week.
You won't spend your study-in-the-Libe eve
nings in a bull session in the lobby. You will
do that additional but not required reading.
This is the quarter . . .
How much do you wanna bet?
coincidence
For some reason the University always man
ages to begin classes during World Series
week. Today, the first day of the Series, is
also the first day of signing blue cards. Base
ball is our national pastime. It seems rather
unpatriotic to run classes in competition. At
least they could set up TV sets in all 9, 10, and
11 o'clock classes.
