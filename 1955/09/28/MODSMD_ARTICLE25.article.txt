George Ralph presides over his first session
of the Legislature of the ASSU tonight (7:30 in
the Legislature room) in a meeting which will
be devoted primarily to details—financial and
appointive.
But it will be an important meeting for Ralph
and Ihe Legislature. Because the student gov
ernment is starting its first full year under the
new constitution, it is essential to initiate proce
dure which will speed the legislative meetings
and also machinery which will improve the
running of the entire ASSU set-up.
To meel the latter problem, according to
Ralph, it will be necessary to revamp com
pletely the by-laws of the ASSU and many of
lis affiliated organizations. At the present time
the by-laws are out-dated, confusing, conflict
ing generally a conglomerate mess.
To correct this situation, of course, is a tedi
ous, almost endless task. But if the Legislature
manages to straighten out the modus operandi
of the s:udent government, it should create the
basis for a productive year. The ASSU needs
r onstructive reform, and modernizing the by

laws to fit the principles of the new constitu
tion is a vital first step.
At the moment, Ralph's other concern—what
seems to be his long-range goal for the year—
is the often-discussed Tresidder Student Un
ion. Ralph and Bill Tooley, student financial
manager, have returned from the summer NSA
convention excited about the success of stu
dent unions at other universities. They feel
that Stanford should have a large, fully equip
ped union. And soon.
Approximately a million dollars is on hand,
about half what Ralph and Tooley feel is
needed to build an adequate union. Three
courses of action can be taken: (1) wait till an
c'.her million is accumulated in student fees
and accumulated interest; (2) start building a
skeleton building with the money now avail
able; (3) borrow another million and build it
complete now. Ralph and Tooley like the idea
of a loan.
The union has been in the talking stage too
long. It will be a successful year for the ASSU
if this situation can be changed.
