# EIGHT NEW LIVING UNITS
## Spanish Names for Wilbur Hall Units Add New Words to Farm Vocabulary New Dorm Features Houses, Not Corridors 
### FRANK HUNTRESS 
A new crop of words has been
gleaned into the Farm vocabu
lary this fall with the addition of
Ray Lyman Wilbur Hall.
The $3,250,000 dormitory which
houses most of the men in the Class
of 1959 has a colorful story behind
the names and new words associated
with it.
Unlike its predecessor, Encina
Hall, the new dorm is composed of
more than one -building. There are
eight student living units, an ad
ministration building with dining
halls, and four small houses for mar
ried resident assistants—all of which
are laid out in the form of a quad
rangle.
Tnis arrangement resembles La
gunita Court in that each building
was given a Spanish name. Flor
ence Moore Hall, the women's dorm
now under construction, will have a
similar arrangement with the living
area being separated into more than
one building.
This situation of having more than
one building results in the forma
tion cf more new term to be added
to the growing Farm dictionary. For
example: each building at Wilbur is
called a "house"; two connecting
houses are called a "group"; and
each floor in each Piouse is desig
nated a "floor."
QUESTION OF NAMES
By contrast, the older dormitories
such as Encina, Branner, Roble, and
Toyon are contained in one building
each. Separation of the living groups
in Encina, Stern, Crothers, and
Toyon is done by dividing each floor I
into "wings." At Branner and Roble |
they are called "corridors."
Ever since Stanford was opened
many new words have been added
to its dictionary. When Wilbur Hall
was completed a problem confronted
the administration as to how to label
each house in the quadrangle.
Should they number them, give
them letters, or name them after fa
mous persons associated with the
University?
In following with Stanford's tra
dition of naming most of the dormi- J
tories on the campus, the Board of j
Trustees decided to give each house j
a Spanish nainfe.
According to Assistant to the
President Frederic O. Glover, the !
University did not wfint to use j
names .of people in naming the j
houses since it would detract from
the person after whom the dormi
tory was named.
HISTORY AND NATURE
He said the names chosen were j
Stanford's history or with Dr. Wil-i
bur's great love of nature. Names !
had to be chosen that would not [
begin with the same letter, he added.
Glover stated that Cedro, Madera,
Rinconada, and Trancos were se
lected for their connection with
Farm history, while Arroyo, Juni
pero, Otero, and Soto were chosen
because they are all linked to na
ture, which was one of Dr. Wilbur's |
great loves.
The background history of the
eight houses as related by Glover is
as follows:

Cedro refers to a cottage by the
same name where Charles G. La
throp, Mrs. Lelami Stanford's broth
er, lived. It was used by the Stan
fords as a summer home on the cam
pus and was located where the
fourth tee at the golf course is now.
Cedro means cedar.
SPANISH WORDS
Madera was named after Rancho
El Coite Madera, one of the old lo
cal Spanish grants in this area. Ma
dera is Spanish for wood.
Rinconada was chosen as an ap
propriate name for one of the
houses, referring to Rinconada del
Arroyo de San Francisquito, another
one of the original Spanish grants.
This grant was part of what is now
Palo Alto. In English Rinconada is
translated to mean angle.
Trancos was a house known as
Los Trancos Villa which fell to the
Stanford estate in the course of its

growth. Translated it moans thresh
old.
Arroyo means rivulet or small
river bed.
I Junipero is another Spanish word
j keyed to natur*meaning juniper, an
; evergreen shrub or tree.
Otero is a Spanish word for hil
lock or small hill.
Soto is a Spanish word pertaining
to nature meaning thicket.

them letters, or name them after fa
mous persons associated with the
University?
In following with Stanford's tra
dition of naming most of the dormi- J
tories on the campus, the Board of j
Trustees decided to give each house j
a Spanish nainfe.
According to Assistant to the
President Frederic O. Glover, the !
University did not wfint to use j
names .of people in naming the j
houses since it would detract from
the person after whom the dormi
tory was named.
HISTORY AND NATURE
He said the names chosen were j
Stanford's history or with Dr. Wil-i
bur's great love of nature. Names !
had to be chosen that would not [
begin with the same letter, he added.
Glover stated that Cedro, Madera,
Rinconada, and Trancos were se
lected for their connection with
Farm history, while Arroyo, Juni
pero, Otero, and Soto were chosen
because they are all linked to na
ture, which was one of Dr. Wilbur's |
great loves.
The background history of the
eight houses as related by Glover is
as follows:

Cedro refers to a cottage by the
same name where Charles G. La
throp, Mrs. Lelami Stanford's broth
er, lived. It was used by the Stan
fords as a summer home on the cam
pus and was located where the
fourth tee at the golf course is now.
Cedro means cedar.
SPANISH WORDS
Madera was named after Rancho
El Coite Madera, one of the old lo
cal Spanish grants in this area. Ma
dera is Spanish for wood.
Rinconada was chosen as an ap
propriate name for one of the
houses, referring to Rinconada del
Arroyo de San Francisquito, another
one of the original Spanish grants.
This grant was part of what is now
Palo Alto. In English Rinconada is
translated to mean angle.
Trancos was a house known as
Los Trancos Villa which fell to the
Stanford estate in the course of its

growth. Translated it moans thresh
old.
Arroyo means rivulet or small
river bed.
I Junipero is another Spanish word
j keyed to natur*meaning juniper, an
; evergreen shrub or tree.
Otero is a Spanish word for hil
lock or small hill.
Soto is a Spanish word pertaining
to nature meaning thicket.


STILL WORKING ON WILBUR--Workers pour concrete and
lay bricks in one of the patios at Ray Lyman Wilbur Hall in an
effort to complete its landscaping by January.
A new crop of words has been
gleaned into the Farm vocabu
lary this fall with the addition of
Ray Lyman Wilbur Hall.
The $3,250,000 dormitory which
houses most of the men in the Class
of 1959 has a colorful story behind
the names and new words associated
with it.
Unlike its predecessor, Encina
Hall, the new dorm is composed of
more than one -building. There are
eight student living units, an ad
ministration building with dining
halls, and four small houses for mar
ried resident assistants—all of which
are laid out in the form of a quad
rangle.
Tnis arrangement resembles La
gunita Court in that each building
was given a Spanish name. Flor
ence Moore Hall, the women's dorm
now under construction, will have a
similar arrangement with the living
area being separated into more than
one building.
This situation of having more than
one building results in the forma
tion cf more new term to be added
to the growing Farm dictionary. For
example: each building at Wilbur is
called a "house"; two connecting
houses are called a "group"; and
each floor in each Piouse is desig
nated a "floor."
QUESTION OF NAMES
By contrast, the older dormitories
such as Encina, Branner, Roble, and
Toyon are contained in one building
each. Separation of the living groups
in Encina, Stern, Crothers, and
Toyon is done by dividing each floor I
into "wings." At Branner and Roble |
they are called "corridors."
Ever since Stanford was opened
many new words have been added
to its dictionary. When Wilbur Hall
was completed a problem confronted
the administration as to how to label
each house in the quadrangle.
Should they number them, give
them letters, or name them after fa
mous persons associated with the
University?
