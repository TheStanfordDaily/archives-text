# Lag's 'Farm Fair' Is Saturday Night
## 
### 
Dancing, concessions and an auc
tion will feature Saturday Night's
Farm Fair at Lagunita Court, the
annual foreign relief event. Paulette
Grantham, Fair chairman, has an
nounced that, as usual, the event is
open to all the campus.
Proceeds from the Fair are slated
for foreign relief, especially for the
village of St. Johann in Austria.
The village was adopted by Lagu
nita's women as a special project
shortly after World War 11.
Hugh Friedman's orchestra will
supply dance music, according to
Miss Grantham, and auctioneers will
be Elva F;iy Brown, Stanford dean
of women, and H. Donald Winbigler,
dean of students. One of the items
to be auctioned is a football auto
graphed by members of the Stan
ford varsity.
