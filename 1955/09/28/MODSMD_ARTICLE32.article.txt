## Ike's Illness Causes Drop In Market 
### DICK MEISTER 
The recent illness of President
Eisenhower has caused a con
siderable wavering in the stock
market. In fact, Monday the
market tumbled in one of the
heaviest falls in its history. Only
the drop in the great crash of
1929 was more severe.
But late yesterday the market
began climbing again, in the second
largest rise in its history; second
only to that of 1037. Economists
throughout the nation attributed the
fall and subsequent rise of the mar
health-
When it first became known that
the President was ill with a heart
condition the market began falling
but when it was announced that he
was gaining in his bout with the
attack it began to rise.
Roger Babson, the economist who
predicted the 1929 crash, said at the
bottom of the drop Monday that it
"may be the beginning of the end
of the bull market." A bull market
is one that rises on the fact that
people have faith in the basic sound
ness of the nation's economy.
But, despite this, other Wall Street
experts have been widely quoted in
saying that the nation's economy is
basically sound.
With the uncertainty caused by
Ike's illness many stockholders have
adopted the attitude of selling now
and analyzyig the news later. This
widespread selling came at a time
when the market was acutely vul
nerable. It's been booming ahead
with unprecedented strength for the
past two years, and last Friday
reached a historic peak.
Politics especially reared its head
in the Chicago grain market as
grains moved generally higher, trad
ers noting that Democrats have been
in favor of high, rigid price supports
for such basic crops.
Here at Stanford, Professor Joseph
K. Arrow, Economics Department
head, had this to say concerning the
current market situation:
"The market in general is rather
nervous, with rather high prices, tind
earnings are no more than 4 per cent
on good stocks, a very low return."
Dr. Arrow explained that buyers'
expectations of future price rises
feed on themselves and any shock,
such as the President's illness, will
cause repercussions. The professor
calls the recent developments "just
a flurry, nothing really significant."
He did note, however, that the
situation shows the general ner
vousness of the stock market.

vousness of the stock market.
The recent illness of President
Eisenhower has caused a con
siderable wavering in the stock
market. In fact, Monday the
market tumbled in one of the
heaviest falls in its history. Only
the drop in the great crash of
1929 was more severe.
But late yesterday the market
began climbing again, in the second
largest rise in its history; second
only to that of 1037. Economists
throughout the nation attributed the
fall and subsequent rise of the mar
health-
When it first became known that
the President was ill with a heart
condition the market began falling
but when it was announced that he
was gaining in his bout with the
attack it began to rise.
Roger Babson, the economist who
predicted the 1929 crash, said at the
bottom of the drop Monday that it
"may be the beginning of the end
of the bull market." A bull market
is one that rises on the fact that
people have faith in the basic sound
ness of the nation's economy.
But, despite this, other Wall Street
experts have been widely quoted in
saying that the nation's economy is
basically sound.
With the uncertainty caused by
Ike's illness many stockholders have
adopted the attitude of selling now
and analyzyig the news later. This
widespread selling came at a time
when the market was acutely vul
nerable. It's been booming ahead
with unprecedented strength for the
past two years, and last Friday
reached a historic peak.
Politics especially reared its head
in the Chicago grain market as
grains moved generally higher, trad
ers noting that Democrats have been
in favor of high, rigid price supports
for such basic crops.
Here at Stanford, Professor Joseph
K. Arrow, Economics Department
head, had this to say concerning the
current market situation:
"The market in general is rather
nervous, with rather high prices, tind
earnings are no more than 4 per cent
on good stocks, a very low return."
Dr. Arrow explained that buyers'
expectations of future price rises
feed on themselves and any shock,
such as the President's illness, will
cause repercussions. The professor
calls the recent developments "just
a flurry, nothing really significant."
He did note, however, that the
situation shows the general ner
vousness of the stock market.
