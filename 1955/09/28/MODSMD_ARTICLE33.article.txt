# Stanford Professor's Nixon Caricature Causes Controversy at S.F. Art Festival
## 
### FRANK HUNTRESS 
On Sept. 15 artist Victor M.
Arnautoff took an inconspicuous
10-by-14-inch color lithograph to
the San Francisco Art Festival
offering it for $25.
The cartoon hung on the wall all
that day. The next morning it wasn't
there.
What happened to the once un
publicized lithograph caused one of
the largest artistic and political con
troversies to take place in the Bay
Area.
Artist ArnautolT is an assistant
prolessor of art at Stanford Univer
sity. His drawing pictured Vice-
President Richard Nixon wearing a
mask and holding a paint brush and
a bucket labeled "SMEAR" in one
hand and a pumpkin in the other.
The pumpkin apparently is in ref
erence to Nixon's role in the Alger
Hiss case and Whittaker Chambers'
"pumpkin papers." Arnautoff titled
the lithograph "DIX McSMEAR"
and priced it at $25. He took it to
the festival, which lasted from Sept.
15 to 19 at the Civic Auditorium in
San Francisco.
The satiristic cartoon hung in the
auditorium during the first day with
out any public criticism.
The next day Harold Zellerbach,
president of the Art Commission
which stages the festival, ordered it
taken down. He stated that he had
acted after receiving a call purported
to be from the FBI. The caller called
iii.s attention to the picture, but did
not demand its removal.
Joseph P. McMahon, assistant spe

San Francisco, said, "It was none of

of no reason why we should make
such a call."
Upon hearing of the controversy,
Vice - President Nixon backed the
right of the artist.
Nixon in his telegram to Zeller
bach stated: "I have just received a
full report on the controversy over
the ArnautolT lithograph. I can un
derstand your position that a public
exposition sponsored and paid for
by all the people is not a proper

"Mr. ArnautofTs standing as an
artist is attested by the fact he is

ican universities. And because of
the position he holds, his view on
any subject has particular signifi

Last week Marion H. Kent of
Hillsborough, former chairman of
the Democrats' county central com
mittee, purchased the color cartoon
from Arnautoff. No price was dis
closed, but Kent said "the price
went up."
He added that he would put it to
some constructive use for the Demo
cratic party in San Mateo County.

ARNAUTOFF'S CONTROVERSIAL DRAWING OF VICE-PRESIDENT NIXON
On Sept. 15 artist Victor M.
Arnautoff took an inconspicuous
10-by-14-inch color lithograph to
the San Francisco Art Festival
offering it for $25.
The cartoon hung on the wall all
that day. The next morning it wasn't
there.
What happened to the once un
publicized lithograph caused one of
the largest artistic and political con
troversies to take place in the Bay
Area.
Artist ArnautolT is an assistant
prolessor of art at Stanford Univer
sity. His drawing pictured Vice-
President Richard Nixon wearing a
mask and holding a paint brush and
a bucket labeled "SMEAR" in one
hand and a pumpkin in the other.
The pumpkin apparently is in ref
erence to Nixon's role in the Alger
Hiss case and Whittaker Chambers'
"pumpkin papers." Arnautoff titled
the lithograph "DIX McSMEAR"
and priced it at $25. He took it to
the festival, which lasted from Sept.
15 to 19 at the Civic Auditorium in
San Francisco.
The satiristic cartoon hung in the
auditorium during the first day with

The next day Harold Zellerbach,

taken down. He stated that he had
acted after receiving a call purported
