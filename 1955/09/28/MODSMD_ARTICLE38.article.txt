# Ohioans Lose Nine Starters
## 
### IJv DIC K NIC HOLS 
Ohio State's Buckeyes invade the
Stanford Farm this Saturday to do
battle with Chuck Taylor's men. The
mythical national champions ol last |
year lost nine of their starting elev
en, but have retained the services
of Howard "Hopalong" Cassady, an
All-American candidate at left half
back.
Woody Hayes is starting his fifth
season as head football coach at
OSU. During his years with the '
Buckeyes his teams have won 26, !
lost only nine and tied two, for a
winning percentage of .743. An ad
herent of the split T attack, Hayes
stresses the perfection of a few plays j
rather than great variety in his of
fense .
BUCKS WHIP P.C.C.
The Buckeyes, in years past, have
played only three PCC schoolsâ€”
California, USC, and Washington j
State. In these encounters, Ohio i
State has fared well, winning nine,
losing four and tying one.
Ohio State University is located |
in Columbus and was founded in j
1873. The school has a camnus of j
over 2,000 acres and an enrollment
of nearly 20,000.
Prospects for this year's Buckeye
team appear to be rather dim. Only |
Cassady and tackle Francis Machin
sky return as starters. Other vet
erans include Bill Michael at end,
Jim Parker at guard, Ken Vargo at
center, Jerry Harkrader at right
half, and Jim Roseboro at fullback, j
BUCKEYES FAST
Inexperience predominates, but
this liability may partially be made j
up for by increased speed, both in :
the line and the backfield. DepLh is
lacking at tackle and guard, although
the team is well stocked with half
backs and centers. Again the run- [
ning game should be strong, but the j
passing attack only fair.
Last week at Columbus the Buck
eyes twice came from behind to de
feat Nebraska, 28-20. Only a week
before, Nebraska had been up.:et,
6-0, by a scrappy team from the
University of Hawaii. Cassady again
led the way, as he did last year, bv
scoring three touchdowns, two of
which regained the lead from the
Cornhuskers.
After facing Stanford, the Buck
eyes meet Illinois, Duke, Wisconsin,
Northwestern, Indiana, lowa, and
Michigan. The Indians, after facing
Ohio, will take on Michigan State,
UCLA, Washington, San Jose State.
Southern Cal, Oregon, and Cal.
