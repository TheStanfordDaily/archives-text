# Series Starts today at 9 If It Doesn't Rain in NY
## 
### NEW YORK, Sept. 27 (UP) 
The weather and Mickey Mantle
were the only question marks
toniqht as the New York Yan
' kecs and the Brooklyn Dodgers
prepared to meet in the World
i Series for the sixth time when
the 52nd annual baseball classic
smarts at 9 a.m. PST tomorrow.
It will be Don Newcombe, Brook
lyn's- 20-game winner, against Whi
ley (I've. Got Butterflies) Ford, who
won 1H games, when they start the
best-of-seven series at Yankee Sta
dium with the Yankees a 13 to 10
favorite to win their sixth workl j
championship in seven years.
Considerable cloudiness was fore
cast, with a c'lance of showers which
' might endanger the start, as the
Dodgers, U to 3 underdogs in the
! initial contest, started a quest for
their first title in eight tries.
Both teams were rallying from a
plague of illnesses and injuries but
there still was a question as to
vvliet h e r Mantle, the Oklahoma
strong man who is one of the Yan
kee siege guns, would be able to
i start.
Mantle suffered a pulled muscle in
! his right thigh on Sept. 23 and, when
the Yankees started a workout at
Ebbets Field today he was quite

chip'jer and said it "feels a lot bet
ter." But he was quite grim alter
a batting workout in which he belt
ej two balls over the right field wall
and then took a diathermy treat
ment.
"It still bothers me," he admitted.
"I just don't know right now wheth
er I'll he aide to play or not."
Gil McDougald. the Yankee thiul
baseman, and pitcher Don Larsen
both reported progress. McDougald
was nursing a leg injury which he
said "will be all right unless I have
to slide." Larsen felt "much better"
from a laryngitis attack.

'1 he Dodgers were more hopeful j
j.liy 'ically, t.io. Carl Furillo, the j
right fielder, missed the workout at
Yankee Siadium with a heavy cold
but reported he was feeling more
chipper. Relief pitcher Clem Labine
apparently was recovering from a
slight virus attack.
Also worrying Dodger pilot Walt j
Alston was the condition of pitchers
Carl Erskine and Billy Loes, two
sore arm victims, and Johnny Po- I
dres, recoving from a rib injury.
'"They may not be 100 per cent j
cfTfictive," Alston asserted, "but they I
should he close to it."
