# Chief Davis Says, 'Walk, Don't Drive, to Classes'
## 
### 
"Walk to your classes if you
live on campus." This is the
suggestion of Gordon Davis,
Chief of the Stanford Police.
"Parking space near the Quad is
very limited," Davis said, "and must
be used by those students who live
ofi campus and have to drive." lie
added that the traffic problem is es
pecially critical this quarter because
of the campus-wide road construc
tion program.
Chief Davis also suggests that stu
dents who live oil campus start to
class earlier and use parking areas
which are not usually filled to ca
pacity, such as the Chemistry lot,
Health Service lot, and the Triangle
lot between the Education building
and Stern Hall. "Park carefully,"
he added. "Careless parking results
in lost space and damaged vehicles."
There are approximately 200 park
ing spaces reserved for some faculty
members and the physically handi
capped. These areas are marked, and

students parking in them arc sub
ject to fine.
Every automobile owner at Stan
ford must securc from the police
department a registration sticker to
be displayed on the rear window.
The stickers serve to protect the re
stricted and reserved parking areas.
Black stickers indicate faculty own
ership; red stickers, students; and
red-black stickers, physically handi
capped.
All parking violations are subject
to a $2 fine unless permitted to be
come delinquent, then being subject
to $1 additional.
