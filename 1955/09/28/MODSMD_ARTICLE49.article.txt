# New Driving Laws Now in Effect
## 
### 
Driving evenings or at night with
only the parking lights on and driv
ing with headlights that discern ob
jects at less than 500 feet are now
unlawful, according to new state
laws.
These new statutes make it illegal
to drive with parking lights on un
less they are being used as signal
lamps and the headlights are also on.
It simply means that parking lights
are to be used for only parkingâ€”not
driving.
