# REPLACES HILGARD
## Steere Appointed Graduate Dean 
### DAVE SCOTT 
"It's a job that touches almost every area of the University,"
said William C. Steere, newly appointed Dean of the Graduate
Division.
Steere was appointed to the position Sept. 1 by President Wal
lace Sterling to succeed Dr. Ernest Hilgard who returned to teach-

in# psychology.
The new dean went on to explain
that his duties entailed much more
than just handling the graduate stu
dents and their degrees. His office
is in charge of such interdepart
mental research organizations as the
Food Research Institute.
PROMOTES RESEARCH GRANTS
"One of the major jobs is the pro
motion and screening of research
grants. Contrary to popular belief
much of our division's research
money is not put up by the Uni
versity itself but by outside organi
zations such as the Cancer Society
and the Rockefeller Foundation."
"But," stated the Dean, "a big
part of my job, I have found out, is
just talking to people. I aid in the
screening of teachers for the Grad
uate Division. Last Sunday I went
to the foreign students' picnic and
Monday I spoke to the new women
R.A.'s. Every day there is some
thing."
Steere made a name for himself in
the field of botany and has been a
professor of biology at Stanford
since 1950.
