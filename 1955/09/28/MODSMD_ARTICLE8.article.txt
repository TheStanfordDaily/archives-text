WASHINGTON—A Congi •essional
inquiry was launched today into
charges the Navy spent millions of
dollars on jet fighter planes that
won't fly and in which two test pilots
were killed.
Rep. Frank M. Karsten (D.-Mo.)
said the Navy accepted '56 F3H-1
"Demon"' jet fighter planes produced
by the McDonnell Aircraft Corpora
tion despite the fact that their West
inghouse jet engines were not pow
erful enough to carry them. He said
six of the planes crashed during
flight tests, killing two pilots.
