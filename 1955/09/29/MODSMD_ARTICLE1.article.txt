# Stanford Road Program to Recreate 'Restful Atmosphere,' Divert Traffic From Quad Area to Peripheral Route
## 
### DAVE BROWNWOOD Staff Editor, The Daily 
In these days of a car in every
garage —and one for every two
students on campus—road im
provement plays a major part in
the University construction pro
gram now under way.
Part of the roads program was
completed over the summer, creat
ine; a bypass of the campus by way
of the Stanford Shopping Center.
Now under construction Ls a portion
of the peripheral road which will
eventually circle the campus, and
changes and improvements on Es
condido Road and Arguello Street.
The main purpose of the new roads
and road improvements, according
to S. F. Post, assistant University
business manager, is not only to
improve the traffic flow on and
through campus, but to divert as
much traffic as possible from the
central campus area, in this way re
storing to some extent the "restful
atmosphere" that once was a part
of the Stanford tradition.
ORIGINAL STEP
One of the original steps in this
direction was taken last year by the
closure of Engineering Corner to

i traffic during class hours. A second
I step was the closure of Frenchman's
Road southeast of campus last year,
with the purpose of diverting
through traffic to Stanford Avenue
and Page Mill Road, both east of
campus.
The completion of the roads built
for the Shopping Center has made
a third step possible this fall. The
widening of Galvez Street near El
Camino Real and the construction
of Arboretum Road — which cuts
through the Arboretum, across Palm
Drive and connects with the new
Willow Road Extension at the Shop
; ping Center—have created a bypass
of campus to the west.
With this bypass available, Los
Arboles Road, west of Lagunita
Court and Lake Lagunita, has been
closed to prevent through traffic
i from coming onto campus.
Officials state that the' road has
been closed only on a trial basis, one
purpose being to show through traf
fic the advantages of using the Wil
low Road-Arboretum Road bypass.
Campus Chief of Police Gordon
Davis has said that he favors the
! permanent closure of Los Arboles if
i such action creates no pressing prob
lems, since the closure eliminates
| the great traffic hazard in front of
Lagunita Court and Roble Hall. Last
year a survey showed that 1,800 cars
a day turned down Los Arboles to
ward campus and passed in front of
the women's dormitories.
PERIPHERAL ROAI)
A second major development in
the road program is the beginning
: of the peripheral road which will
I divert on-campus traffic from the
Quadrangle area. The- portion now
under construction runs from the
corner of Alvarado and Arguello,
near the Theta Chi house, around
the Wilbur Hall parking lot, across
Escondido Road, and behind Branner
and Toyon to the Encina (Men's)
Gym. (See map.)
Officials expect this portion of the
road to be completed around Nov.
.'lO. Until that time Escondido Road
between Wilbur and Branner will
be closed, and traffic from Stanford
Avenue will be detoured onto Pine
Avenue, a gravel road, with a por
tion of the detour running behind
the ROTC area (see map).
For the benefit of persons using
the Wilbur parking lot, there will
be a temporary fill, making the lot
accessible from E«condido Road.
Escondido Road is now undergoing

a major reconstruction, Stern Hall
as far as the intersection of the new
peripheral road. The construction
work will close the roacl in the Wil
bur-Branner area for 45 to 60 days.
The plans include an asphalt surface,
curbing, sidewalks and storm drains,
according to Post.
PEDESTRIAN AREA
The third roads project is also in
the Wilbur - Branner - Toyon area.
Arguello Street, which runs between
Toyon and Crothers and Stern and
Wilbur, is now closed permanently
in the dorm area. Arguello runs be
tween Encina and the Eating Clubs
only far enough to give access to
parking area in front of Toyon. It
is closed from there to the Escondido
Road intersection and from the in
tersection to a point just south of
Stern Hall.
The construction now under way
in the closed areas will convert the
road to a curving pedestrian walk
way. Its function will be similar to
that of the street east of the Quad
in front of the Library—reserved for
pedestrians, but accessible to ve
hicles in emergencies. Traffic which
formerly used the street is expected
to use the new peripheral road sec
tion, thus 'furthering progress to
ward diverting as much traffic as
possible from the central campus
area.
Work on the reconstruction of Ar
guello is expected to finish some
time in November. A storm drain
is also being built in conjunction
with the new walkway.
FUTURE PLANS
The next step in construction of
the peripheral road will be to con
tinue it up Arguello Street past the
Chi Psi and Beta houses, to cross
Lasuen and the present site of Rus
sell House and create easy acccsS to
the new Florence Moore Hall, which
will be built this year on the sloping
field in front of the Knoll.
This additional construction is ex
pected to be completed by the tall ol
1956, when Moore Hall is scheduled
to open, according to officials. This
is the last year for Russell House,
for the construction program calls
for its demolition next, summer.
Later construction will continue
the peripheral road behind Moore
Hall, through the site of the Boat
house, along a dike on the north
(Roble) side of Lake Lagunita, and
then around Lagunita Court and
the west side of campus.

THE CHANGING ROADS—This
map and the one on Page (> show
the areas where the University is
making significant changes in the
campus road network.
From point A at the Theta Chi
house, around Wilbur Hail, past
point I), to the Encina gym: this
will he the route of the new per
ipheral road to enable through
traffic to bypass the Quad area.
By next fall the peripheral road
will extend along Arguello Street,
through the site of Kussell House,

and intersect with Lomita Drive
in front of the boathouse.
Between points Band C: This
section of Escondido Road will be
widened and improved. It will be
closed until the completion of the
peripheral road segment about
Dec. 1.
From point B to E to the Encina
gym: Through traffic from Stan
ford Avenue which usually uses
Escondido will be detoured into
Fine Avenue. This will be a' tem
porary gravel road.
Point E: A detour around the

ROTC Park so that construction
may be done at point D.
In the area of point C: Arguello
Street will be closed to through
traffic. It will be used as a service
entrance to Encina, Crothers. Wil
bur and Stern halls, and for emer
gency vehicles.
Point F: This cut-off between
Pine Avenue and Palm Drive has
been removed to reduce the num
ber of intersections on Palm Drive
and to move the main intersection
farther from the new stop signal.
near El Camino, the first section of
the route to the Shopping Center
and eainpus bypass, was a $29,723
contract handled by Freeman Pav
ing Company of Palo Alto. Traffic
islands and street lighting were in
stalled at Galvez and Arboretum.
The new Arboretum Road has ne
cessitated the erection of traffic sig
nals where it intersects Palm Drive.
The signals have been in operation
; ince Monday. University officials
agree that an underpass or overpass
would be more convenient, but such
a construction is financially pro
hibitive.
To help eliminate the traffic hazard
on Palm Drive created by a large
number of intersections, the cutoff
from Pine Avenue creating a short
cut to Palm Drive has been closed.
(See map.) A second safety measure
has been the painting of white lines
on Palm Drive 300 feet on either
side of the new traffic signals.
Arboretum Road connects with
Quarry Road, east of the Shopping
Center area, and continues past the
Convalescent Home to connect with
the new Willow Road Extension, also
completed over the summer.
The Willow Road Extension does
not have a direct connection with
Willow Road in Palo Alto, which
runs to Bayshore Boulevard. An
overpass or underpass of El Camino
at the Shopping Center has been
proposed which would make a direct
connection with Willow Road feasi
ble, but no definite action is under
way on this proposal.
BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION
A major hurdle which was finally
surmounted in the construction of
the Willow Extension was the span
ning of San Franeisquito Creek near
Sand Hill Road. With the construc
tion of the bridge—the only part of
the road program in San Mateo
County (the rest is in Santa Clara
County)—the connection with Sand
Hill Road was completed and the
bypass opened. (See map for loca
tion of the new roads and the
bridge.)
Since Los Arboles Road has been
closed because of the bypass, traffic
coming from the southwest (Sand
Hill Road) area onto campus must
continue up Foothill Road (south of
Lake Lagunita) to Mayfield Avenue,
and then go down Mayfield past the
Phi Sigma Kappa house to Lasuen
Street ("the Row"), which runs in
front of the Post Office.


NEW AND ( I.OS! I) ROADS —
Stanford lias opened one main ar
tery In entry through trallic around
the campus, and closed another
which carried trallic to the heart
of the Quad area.
Point A: This stretch of Los
Arholes Road, connecting Santa
Teresa—the road in front of La
gunita Court—with .lunipero Ser
ra, has heen closed. Santa Teresa
does not carry through traffic. This

may or may not he temporary.
From point IS to C: Willow Road
has heen opened from Sand I till
Road to the rear of Ihc shopping
center.
From point C to D: Arboretum
Road has been opened to carry
Willow Road traffic across Palm
Drive to the Stadium and GaJvez
Street. Galvez from Arboretum to
El Camino Real has heen widened
to four lanes.
