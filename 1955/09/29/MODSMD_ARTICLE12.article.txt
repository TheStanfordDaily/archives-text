AUSTIN, Tex.â€”Adlai E. Steven
son warned tonight that there are
| "serious flaws" in the nation's boo in
i ing prosperity.
He said he was not a "prophet of
gloom," but that certain economic
trends point to "trouble ahead" and
the nation's leaders should talk less
about how big the boom is and more
; about how to make it last.
The 1952 Democratic presidential
candidate charged that "farmers are
not sharing at all in tht> good times."
"Their prices continue to fall while
i prices to consumers do not, and the
profits of manufacturers rise to un
precedented levels," he said. "In the
past, such a trend has been an omi
nous warning of trouble ahead."
He said other "flaws" were the
tremendous rise in installment buy
ing of autos and homes and the s ec
ulative boom on the stock market.
