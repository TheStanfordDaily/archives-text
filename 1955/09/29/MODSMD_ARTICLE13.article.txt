# ASS Finances Discussed At LASSU Meet
## 
### EDA MENDELS Associate Editor, The Daily 
Financial matters were the
main topics of discussion at last !
night's meeting of LASSU, Leg
islature of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University.
This was the first meeting of the
current college year, the first meet
ing at which ASSU President
George Ralph presided.
Bill Tooley, student financial man- j
ager, reported $827 in the ASSU J
contingency fund. This amount. Too- j
ley said, created a "little bit of a J
tight spot," since usually appi'oxi
niately $2,000 is available for the
special appropriations which the
contingency fund should cover. By
the end of the evening the Legisla
ture had approved expenditures of
$396.88 and $55. bringing the con
tingency fund down to $402.12.
BOOKLETS
The appropriation of $396.88 was
made for the printing of 7,000 Fun
damental Standard and Honor Code
booklets. The new booklets have
been distributed among the fresh
men and other new students, but
additional copies are needed for pre
viously enrolled undergraduates and
graduate students.
Resident assistants will be asked j
to hand out the booklets in the resi- |
dences, but off-campus students will 1
also be assured of their copies. In
cluded in the appropriation was the
amount of $73.08 to cover mailing
costs for the off-campus addresses.
It was decided that no other way
of reaching the graduates, such as
distributing the booklets in class,
would be equally effective.
Mickey Marshek and Doug Kyle,
co-chairmen of Back to the Farm
Week sponsored by Cardinals, re
quested an appropriation of $55 for
their activity. This was granted
from the contingency fund, to sup
plement the amount granted them
in the budget. The funds will be
used to carry on two events of Back
to the Farm Week initiated last year,
"Farm Follies'' and student-faculty
exchange dinners.
EXCHANGES
While the exchange dinners cause
no expenditures, the staging of i
"Farm Follies" is costly. They will
be held in Frost Amphitheater,
where lights and public address sys
tems have to be installed for the
occasion.
The Legislature approved Tooley's
i-equcst that he be allowed to ap
point an assistant student financial i
manager for the 1955-56 term. Sal
ary for the job, $35 a month, was i
already budgeted. Interviews will !
be held for the position.
