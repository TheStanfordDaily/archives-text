# New ASSU Scholars View Farm
## Foreign Student's Sample U.S. Life 
### JIM PALMER 
Eleven ASSU foreign scholars
arrived on the Farm during the
past week to begin a year of
study in a strange land with
strange customs.
Orientation began immediately on |
arrival of the students, who hail
from such far-flung places as Mo- j
rocco, Japan, Australia, and Eu- |
rope.
•Under the guidance of the For
eign Scholarship Committee, co
chairmen Janet Linden and Dick
Woodward, the visitors from abroad
were briefed on a wide variety of
topics useful in life on an American j
campus — ranging from academic j
procedure to dating customs.
ASSU GUESTS
The scholars, who are all here on
funds provided by the ASSU and
two other student organizations, i
have witnessed the freshman convo
cation (which they say impressed I
them greatly), heard discussions on [
the Fundamental Standard and the
Honor Code, listened to lectures on
the American academic system and
their own ambitions and goals,
tasted of Stanford party life, and
ventured to the Sunday evening
flicks.
Some of the eleven have found
traces of their native land, even here
in a strange country. Bruce Mc-
Connach from Aberdeen, Scotland,
was delighted with the Scottish
brogue of Chaplain R. M. Minto.
Europeans enjoyed the French
speaking cartoon at the flicks Sun
day night. (And rather than being
taken aback at raucous audience re
action during the main feature, the
visiting scholars were amused—even '
participated.)
Included in the group are three ]
women and eight men students, I
all upper division or graduate stu- 1
dents. Their average age is 22.
