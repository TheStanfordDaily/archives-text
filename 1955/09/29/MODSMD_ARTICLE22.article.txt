### 
The road in front of Lag and * Dble is closed
to Ihrough traffic. This is the most conspicuous
and controversial aspect of the University's re
cent traffic control and road construction pro
gram. Will the road be blocked off permanent
ly? That depends. University officialdom is
not in agreement.
Police Chief Gordon Davis has for some
/
time advised the closing of Santa Teresa Sireet
to through traffic. A traffic count found that
1,400 cars used Santa Teresa when it was not
doad end. That created a serious traffic and
pedestrian hazard in front of Lag, particularly
'.It the dorm's rush hours. One girl was hit last
year.
When Willow Road — running along San
Francisquito Creek from the Sandhill, Alpine,
and Junipero Serra intersection to the rear of
the new shopping center—was opened during
the summer, the University barricaded the strip
ol road which connects Santa Teresa with Ju
nipero Serra and the road to the golf course.
I his was-—and still is—a temporary measure to
•Hvert cars from the campus roads to the faster
and more direct Willow Road.
Chief Davis recommends strongly that this
set up be made permanent. Other segments
of the administration feel that preventing
through traffic past Lag is an inconvenience
v/hich the students should not be made io suf

fer and an inconvenience which may create
more serious traffic problems.
Some of these problems are in the incu
bator stage. The daily tie-ups around the post
office are becoming more serious and more
frequent; next week, when this college really
gets down to business, probably will see still
more jams at the post office.
Traffic headed from the Quad area to the
golf course, Alpine Road, and the southerly
portions of Menlo Park and other cities to the
west must either drive around the post office
or use the curving road past the Knoll. Both
routes deposit their cars at the five-way inter
section in front of the Phi Sigma Kappa frater
nity. This places a great additional strain on
a dangerous intersection where speeding and
stop-sign-running is flagrant.
One other alternative is to drive from Quad
down Palm Drive, turn left at the new signal,
and use Willow Road. But Palm Drive has been
so busy lately that we may need a six-lane
freeway pretty soon. *
We agree with Chief Davis that preventing
through traffic past Lag in the interests of safety
is a fine plan. The inconvenience and slight
delay required in going the long way around
is incidental when lives are at stake. But will
the re-routing of traffic create more and more
serious safety hazards by overloading ciher
roads? That danger is real.

more serious traffic problems.
Some of these problems are in the incu
bator stage. The daily tie-ups around the post
office are becoming more serious and more
frequent; next week, when this college really
gets down to business, probably will see still
more jams at the post office.
Traffic headed from the Quad area to the
golf course, Alpine Road, and the southerly
portions of Menlo Park and other cities to the
west must either drive around the post office
or use the curving road past the Knoll. Both
routes deposit their cars at the five-way inter
section in front of the Phi Sigma Kappa frater
nity. This places a great additional strain on
a dangerous intersection where speeding and
stop-sign-running is flagrant.
One other alternative is to drive from Quad
down Palm Drive, turn left at the new signal,
and use Willow Road. But Palm Drive has been
so busy lately that we may need a six-lane
freeway pretty soon. *
We agree with Chief Davis that preventing
through traffic past Lag in the interests of safety
is a fine plan. The inconvenience and slight
delay required in going the long way around
is incidental when lives are at stake. But will
the re-routing of traffic create more and more
serious safety hazards by overloading ciher
roads? That danger is real.

The road in front of Lag and * Dble is closed
to Ihrough traffic. This is the most conspicuous
and controversial aspect of the University's re
cent traffic control and road construction pro
gram. Will the road be blocked off permanent
ly? That depends. University officialdom is
not in agreement.
Police Chief Gordon Davis has for some
/
time advised the closing of Santa Teresa Sireet
to through traffic. A traffic count found that
1,400 cars used Santa Teresa when it was not
doad end. That created a serious traffic and
pedestrian hazard in front of Lag, particularly
'.It the dorm's rush hours. One girl was hit last
year.
When Willow Road — running along San
Francisquito Creek from the Sandhill, Alpine,
and Junipero Serra intersection to the rear of
the new shopping center—was opened during
the summer, the University barricaded the strip
ol road which connects Santa Teresa with Ju
nipero Serra and the road to the golf course.
I his was-—and still is—a temporary measure to
•Hvert cars from the campus roads to the faster
and more direct Willow Road.
Chief Davis recommends strongly that this
set up be made permanent. Other segments
of the administration feel that preventing
through traffic past Lag is an inconvenience
v/hich the students should not be made io suf

fer and an inconvenience which may create
more serious traffic problems.
