## Practical mediocrity 
### 
T > fho Editor:
Stanford University's policies designed to eliminate
'.■•r land poverty are most commendable. Careful
planning has made it possible for her to create a li»ht.
industrial tract on her property without disturbing
.»-i- educational function. This has benefited Stanfo: I.
Die industry concerned, and the surrounding <om
iiiunities. Stanford's careful supervision of the choice
<il architects, and her insistence on relating the build
ing:, to their sites, have j.hown the value of planning
i nntrol.
But one mistake has been made, and le-t us hope it
not repeated. The first indication of this planning
.hcarriage was the difficulty workmen and bull
'lozers had in smashing some venerable oak trees on
the site of the new Stanford Shopping Center. This
va ; not as significant as it was unnerving.
Next came the grading. A tremendous area wa*;
flattened and treated with a corrosive agent dt'sigm I
f'i render the soil sterile, obviously to create a future
parking lot.
Then came the buildings. It appeared by the en I
oi .pring that the workmen were going to leave (hem
>.> the crating in which they arrived, and they did.
Worried, but still optimistic (it is dangerou; to be
;iy other way when you are developing land), p op!e
watched the final development during the summer.
Neat little palm trees, fresh from the architect's

drawing board, arrived, and were installed, just as
the buildings had been.
So there you have it. Acres of asphalt. Concrete
boxes blatantly set in the middle of a grey-black sea,
protecting a "wee bit of Los Angeles" in their bosom.
A cacophony of steel, concrete, and glass. Undoubt
edly an extremely efficient plan, but so very far from
home.
And even a small effort would help. Some vege
tation scattered through the sea of asphalt, or a small
building here and there. Anything to camouflage the
sterility of this materialism.
Where does the responsibility for this nonsense lie?
(J! viously with no one. The building is structurally
.sound; it will function as efficiently as a cash regis
ter. The architect acted in good faith. His renderings
and model showed just what the finished center wcu'd
be. The Stanford business office can be credited with
as nice a piece of remunerative economics as any
educational 'institution could want, The deficiency
follows the principle of sunk cost. The center is an
irretrievable esthetic investment. No person con
cerned with the decisions spent the extra effort to
free the project from practical mediocrity.
When time allows us to repeat this mistake, let's
not. It is not necessary to ship the building and its
environment from Los Angeles, or New York. We
can derive it from the things in our own back yard.
And 'the additional thought necessary is worth it.
