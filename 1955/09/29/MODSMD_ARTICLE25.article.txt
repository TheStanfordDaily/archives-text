# "CAME OF LOVE"
## Movie Is 'Standard' Adolescent Study French Film Shows First Love Of Helpless, Provincial Teen-Ager 
### RICHARD MENDE 
"Game of Love" is a sound it
somewhat standard study of
adolescence and first love. A lot
of its attraction for American au
diences comes ftom ihe scarcity
of that sort of thing among Hoi
lywood products.
1j j e action takes place during a
summer vacation on a Brittany

beach, Philip'.'
plight in facing
manhood, alone
an d helpless, is
well characterized
in the opening
seen e when lie
barely escapes

drowning and is left stark naked on
the beach.
To whom can he turn for help?
A provincial society? Of course not.
His family? As in Colette's novel
they are only "shadows." His child
hood companion Vinca, who wants
to help him, is without knowledge
or experience and Philip discerns
the futility cf turning to her.
As the story goes on Philip
chances upon Madame Dalleray,
aging, who performs almost an act
oi charity to the "beggar" in initiat
ing him into a knowledge of mature
relations. Edwige Feuillere does an

excellent job of making love to a 1(1-
year-old boy without making a fool
out of herself; it is a tricky part.
With Philip helped into manhood
by MaJame Dalleray the relation
ship between him and Vinca, his
leveled playmate, can achieve ful
fillment.
! The whole treatment is intelligent
a lid sympathetic and manages to |
keep from being ol • cene or huh- |
crous as easily it mi"ht have, Pieire-
Vlichel Beck exactly captures the
pirit of young manhood and is al- i
ways engaging not to say disarming.
Nicole Berger plays Vinca with the
proper persistence of a devoted
lover.
One camera technique foe used at
tention on each important detail, i
like the mark of Philip's n. w matu
rity; one could feel its significance
being digested and coul l see there- j
suiting relationships in the process !
of development.
There were some unfortunate mu
sical effects and one or two scenes !
seemed to drag but this is perhaps
being picayune about Claude - Au
tant's generally imaginative and in
telligent directing job.
The captions, thankfully, were
abundant.
Incidentally, the short cartoon
showing with the picture is very,
very funny and is worth the extra
: effort of getting there on time.
