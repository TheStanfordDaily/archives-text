# Fund for Republic Gives Study Grant to Stanford
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
A 525.000 gr&nt from the Fund for the Republic was accepted
this month by the University's Board of Trustees for the purpose
of a Lav/ School study of testimony given by key witnesses in
government inguiries into Communistic activity in the United
States.
Although the Law School study is to be undertaken as an im-

partial investigation of the testimo
nial statements, it has become sub
ject to attack by several radio com
mentators and newspaper columnists
who maintain that the study's find
ings will be colored by the already
stated purpose cf the Fund.
In a report published in May of
this year, the Fund, authorized and
originally endowed by the Ford
Foundation, stated as its object "the
advancement of the understanding
of civil liberties."
Stating that the Cold War has
created "unusual disorder" giving
rise to the current abridgment of
civil liberties, the Fund believes
that ''the citizen should know what
his rights are and what is happen
ing to them. This is the reason why
the Fund has used all the media of
communication ... to arouse an
interest in civil liberties and to en
courage debate about them."
STANFORD IN CHARGE
According to Frederic O. Glover,
assistant to the president, the study
grant was accepted by the Trustees
only on the condition that the re
search and method of publication be
completely under the University's
jurisdiction.
Herbert Packer, New York legal
expert under consideration since
1952 for the Stanford law faculty,
was suggested to head the study.
He has been nominated to the law
faculty, and his appointment is now
going through the normal academic
procedure, according to Glover.
One of the main points claimed by
the Fund's critics is that Packer,
supposedly a man hand-picked by
the Fund's director, Robert M.
Hutchins, is being added to the fac
ulty only to lead the Fund's study.
REBUTTAL TO ATTACK
This is not true, according to Glo
ver. but rather Packer had been of
fered a position on the lav/ faculty
just last year in addition to the fact
that the Fund's director was not
acquainted with Packer at the time
that Pecker's nomination was an
nounced to him.
According to a statement made
by Pre'ident Wallace Sterling ear
lier this month, "the University is
concerned only that its faculty
should adhere to those rigorous
standards of independence of judg
ment, exact inquiry, and impartial
evaluation of findings which have
always motivated true scholars.
These principles will be followed by
the faculty in carrying out the
research contemplated under this
grant."
Glover estimates that the Univeiv
sity has received 10 letters for and
30 letters against the study grant.
In addition to the $25,000 grant re
ceived by the University, the Fund
authorized $5,000 to finance a study
by members of the "Stanford Law

Review" last summer on a civil lib
erties topic.
Committees financed by the Fund,
which in 1953 assumed status as an
independent corporation, study and
publish their findings on such sub
jects as the loyalty-security pro
gram, Congressional investigations,
freedom of expression, representa
tion by counsel, immigrants and
aliens, racial discrimination, and
popular education.

by Pre'ident Wallace Sterling ear
lier this month, "the University is
concerned only that its faculty
should adhere to those rigorous
standards of independence of judg
ment, exact inquiry, and impartial
evaluation of findings which have
always motivated true scholars.
These principles will be followed by
the faculty in carrying out the
research contemplated under this
grant."
Glover estimates that the Univeiv
sity has received 10 letters for and
30 letters against the study grant.
In addition to the $25,000 grant re
ceived by the University, the Fund
authorized $5,000 to finance a study
by members of the "Stanford Law

Review" last summer on a civil lib
erties topic.
Committees financed by the Fund,
which in 1953 assumed status as an
independent corporation, study and
publish their findings on such sub
jects as the loyalty-security pro
gram, Congressional investigations,
freedom of expression, representa
tion by counsel, immigrants and
aliens, racial discrimination, and
popular education.
A 525.000 gr&nt from the Fund for the Republic was accepted
this month by the University's Board of Trustees for the purpose
of a Lav/ School study of testimony given by key witnesses in
government inguiries into Communistic activity in the United
States.
Although the Law School study is to be undertaken as an im-

partial investigation of the testimo
nial statements, it has become sub
ject to attack by several radio com
mentators and newspaper columnists
who maintain that the study's find
ings will be colored by the already
stated purpose cf the Fund.
In a report published in May of
this year, the Fund, authorized and
originally endowed by the Ford
Foundation, stated as its object "the
advancement of the understanding
of civil liberties."
Stating that the Cold War has
created "unusual disorder" giving
rise to the current abridgment of
civil liberties, the Fund believes
that ''the citizen should know what
his rights are and what is happen
ing to them. This is the reason why
the Fund has used all the media of
communication ... to arouse an
interest in civil liberties and to en
courage debate about them."
STANFORD IN CHARGE
According to Frederic O. Glover,
assistant to the president, the study
grant was accepted by the Trustees
only on the condition that the re
search and method of publication be
completely under the University's
jurisdiction.
Herbert Packer, New York legal
expert under consideration since
1952 for the Stanford law faculty,
was suggested to head the study.
He has been nominated to the law
faculty, and his appointment is now
going through the normal academic
procedure, according to Glover.
One of the main points claimed by
the Fund's critics is that Packer,
supposedly a man hand-picked by
the Fund's director, Robert M.
Hutchins, is being added to the fac
ulty only to lead the Fund's study.
REBUTTAL TO ATTACK
This is not true, according to Glo
ver. but rather Packer had been of
fered a position on the lav/ faculty
just last year in addition to the fact
that the Fund's director was not
acquainted with Packer at the time
that Pecker's nomination was an
nounced to him.
