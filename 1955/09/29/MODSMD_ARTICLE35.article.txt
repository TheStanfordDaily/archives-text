## 
### 
A 24-year-old Stanford student
suffered a badly injured eye in a
Tuesday night brawl in a Dumbar
ton tavern.
Confined to the Palo Alto Hospital
with a split oyelid and contusions of
the eyeball is Frederick Storke, 24,
of 1001 Cowper Street. Storke is
from Boulder, Colo.
The fight took place in a bar
known as The Cracked Pot, owned
by Stanford boxing coach Ray Lun
ny and one John Johnson.
Arrested after the dispute was
Marine Roger Hugh Staples, 20, as
signed to the Hunters Point Naval
Shipyard in San Francisco. Staples
was booked on investigation of as
sault and battery, but the charge
was later reduced to being drunk in
public view. Staples is the scion of
an Atherton manufacturing family.
With Staples in the bar were Mi
chael Horan, 20, of 635 Laurel Street,
Redwood City, and his wife, Mary,
also 20.
According to an investigator in
the San Mateo County Sheriff's of
fice, Storke apparently said some
thing which offended Mrs. Horan.
She dashed a glass of beer in his
face. Staples then left the bar with
Storke to fight outside.
Both the state Alcoholic Beverage
Control Authority and the Califor
nia Highway Patrol associated them
selves with the case. The ABC was
interested in the three minors drink
ing in the tavern, while the Highway
Patrol investigated Staples' car. Pa
trolmen said that the car might have
been involved in a hit-run accident
in Redwood City.
