### 
College students serve no good
cause if their faith is purchased at
the price of honesty.
This is the opinion of Stanford re
ligion lecturer Alexander Miller in
the just-published ''(Joing-to-Col
lege Handbook."
Dr. Miller calls upon students to
deal fairly with faith, first of all, for,
he says, the toughest questions have
already been met in ages past and
students simply need to do a bit of
exploring.
If faith seems to conflict with the
facts, he says, they also need to
know the facts better, for "No man
ever lost the way to God along the
road of honesty."
