# Earthquakes Have Always Been Threat to Stanford
## 
### JIM PALMER 
When the walls start to shake,
the windows give a rattle, and
the ceiling begins to roll, it may
not be just the party upstairs—
it might be an earthquake.
Stanford is situated in one of the
more tremulous areas in North
America, between two large faults
where earth shifts take place fre
quently.
Just five miles west of the cam
pus branches the famed San An- j
dreas split, birthplace of the disas- |
trous San Francisco shaker of 190(5.
The wicked Hayward tault runs up |
the east side of the bay.
Occasional earth movements have !
brought apprehension to the Penin- |
sula ever since the big one a half- j
century ago.
Latent of the tremors occurred at
7:01 p.m. Sept. 4, when the Santa
Clara Valley shivered and shook.
An aftershock at 7:25 a.m. three days
later quivered the San Francisco-
Daly City area, and Los Angeles, at
the southern end of the coast sec
tion of the San Andreas fault, |
quaked at 3:21 a.m. Sept. 14.
RECENT QUAKE HARD
The early September quake on the
Peninsula was rated from 5.5 to G
in intensity on the Charles F. Rich- i
lor scale. The 190G shake was 8.25
on the same scale.
Controversy has raged over the
exaot epicentef 1 of the Sept. 4
tremor. Some say it was in the
mudflats north of San Jose, others
disagree.
But nevertheless the Peninsula is
on the move, and whether the latest
quakes are normal adjustments or
indicative of more serious shifts "is
a question no one can answer.
No damage has been reported on
the campus as a result of the Sep
tember quakes, although extensive
minor damage was caused in. San
Jose.
The situation was quite different j
49 years back on April 18. Destruc- '
tion on the Stanford campus and the
Peninsula was appalling and the
Daily Palo Alto (predecessor of the
Stanford Daily) reported that day
in a special edition the following:
190(1 QUAKE
"Beginning at about seven min
utes past five this morning and last
ing for fully twenty seconds, the
greatest earthquake of modern times
shook the campus and affected the
entire Santa Clara Valley and prob
ably the whole Pacific Coast.
"The effect of the shake on the
campus was terrible. Two lives were
lost, six injured and the damage
done to buildings cannot be esti
mated."
Fraternity houses received great
damage, the Daily Palo Alto re
ported.
"The Chi P.si house was the hard
est hit of any on the campus. The
place is a complete wreck, ft was
thrown ten feet off its foundations
and the floors are torn out. The
house is condemned and the occu
pants are living in tents.
"The Phi Delta Theta house is
slightly damaged. Plaster is off
downstairs and the chimneys are
down.
"The interior of the Delta Kappa
Epsilon house is badly cracked . . .
chimneys are clown in the Sigma Chi
house and plaster is off on the first
floor . . . the Beta Theta Pi house
was hit hard. Windows are broken,
chimneys are down, as is the plaster
on the lower floor. The foundations
are sprung ... A handsome col
lection of steins, valued at $200, was
destroyed (at the Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon house)."
BUILDINGS HIT
Memorial Church, the Arch, Roble
Hall, Encina Hall, the library and
gymnasium and other campus build
ings were hit hard.
The 1907 Quad, which was near
ing completion at a publishing com
pany in San Francisco, was totally
consumed by the conflagration
which devastated the business sec
tion of the city.
A falling chimney at Encina killed
a sophomore. The Daily reported
that "the first shock in Encina Hall
brought .'lOO scantily clad men into
the corridors in a mad rush for
safety and the open air. The road

in front was filled with excited stu
dents, who broke through a rain oi'
falling stone. 1 - and plaster. As soon
as the shock subsided, the men be
gan to investigate the extent of the
damage. The cries of the victims
buried in the ruins of the collapsed
third floor were plainly audible.
"The greatest damage done to any
building on the quad wa suffered
by the Memorial Church. A c ock
tower was shattered in half, stones,
brickwork and timber 1 - falling into
the body of the church and piling
up a mats of wreckage. The works
of the clock were hft r< ting on
beams across the tower.
MOSAIC' DESTROYED
"The front mosaic of the church,
portraying the Seimon 011 the
Mount, was hurled on th; 1 pavement
of the inner quadrangle in total de
struction, leaving the interior of the
church exposed ami !i htl,\ damag
ing the organ.
"Memorial Arch w i lowered to
the frieze, while two lue-e crevices,
one on each side. split the arch open
to the interior."
More serious yet wa the news
that "there is no in: uranee which
will cover the loss the University
has sustained. Both the new library
and gymnasium buildings have been
accepted and their loss will fall
solely upon the University."

Nevertheless, Stanford survived
the disaster and settled down to co
existence with a score of minor
tremors in the years since. How
long this status will last is not pre
dictable— for who knows when the
earth will shake, rattle and roll
again?

that "the first shock in Encina Hall

Nevertheless, Stanford survived
the disaster and settled down to co

The situation was quite different j
49 years back on April 18. Destruc- '
tion on the Stanford campus and the
Peninsula was appalling and the
Daily Palo Alto (predecessor of the
Stanford Daily) reported that day
in a special edition the following:
190(1 QUAKE
"Beginning at about seven min
utes past five this morning and last
ing for fully twenty seconds, the
greatest earthquake of modern times
shook the campus and affected the
entire Santa Clara Valley and prob
ably the whole Pacific Coast.
"The effect of the shake on the
campus was terrible. Two lives were
lost, six injured and the damage
done to buildings cannot be esti
mated."
Fraternity houses received great
damage, the Daily Palo Alto re
ported.
"The Chi P.si house was the hard
est hit of any on the campus. The
place is a complete wreck, ft was
thrown ten feet off its foundations
and the floors are torn out. The
house is condemned and the occu
pants are living in tents.
"The Phi Delta Theta house is
slightly damaged. Plaster is off
downstairs and the chimneys are
down.
"The interior of the Delta Kappa
Epsilon house is badly cracked . . .
chimneys are clown in the Sigma Chi
house and plaster is off on the first
floor . . . the Beta Theta Pi house
was hit hard. Windows are broken,
chimneys are down, as is the plaster
on the lower floor. The foundations
are sprung ... A handsome col
lection of steins, valued at $200, was
destroyed (at the Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon house)."
BUILDINGS HIT
Memorial Church, the Arch, Roble
Hall, Encina Hall, the library and
gymnasium and other campus build
ings were hit hard.
The 1907 Quad, which was near
ing completion at a publishing com
pany in San Francisco, was totally
consumed by the conflagration
which devastated the business sec
tion of the city.
A falling chimney at Encina killed
a sophomore. The Daily reported
that "the first shock in Encina Hall
brought .'lOO scantily clad men into
the corridors in a mad rush for
safety and the open air. The road

in front was filled with excited stu
dents, who broke through a rain oi'
falling stone. 1 - and plaster. As soon
as the shock subsided, the men be
gan to investigate the extent of the
damage. The cries of the victims
buried in the ruins of the collapsed
third floor were plainly audible.
"The greatest damage done to any
building on the quad wa suffered
by the Memorial Church. A c ock
tower was shattered in half, stones,
brickwork and timber 1 - falling into
the body of the church and piling
up a mats of wreckage. The works
of the clock were hft r< ting on
beams across the tower.
MOSAIC' DESTROYED
"The front mosaic of the church,
portraying the Seimon 011 the
Mount, was hurled on th; 1 pavement
of the inner quadrangle in total de
struction, leaving the interior of the
church exposed ami !i htl,\ damag
ing the organ.
"Memorial Arch w i lowered to
the frieze, while two lue-e crevices,
one on each side. split the arch open
to the interior."
More serious yet wa the news
that "there is no in: uranee which
will cover the loss the University
has sustained. Both the new library
and gymnasium buildings have been
accepted and their loss will fall
solely upon the University."

Nevertheless, Stanford survived
the disaster and settled down to co
existence with a score of minor
tremors in the years since. How
long this status will last is not pre
dictable— for who knows when the
earth will shake, rattle and roll
again?
