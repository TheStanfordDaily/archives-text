before the Dodders jumped into, the
lead with two runs in the top of the
second inning.
Chief »blows in the outburst were

.truck by Carl Furillo, Jackie Rob
inson, and Don Zimmer. Furillo,
Brook right fielder, left a sick Led
lo play in today's game but didn't
let his severe cold get him down as
lie collet-led three safeties in four

collided with the lower right field

Two I.utters later, Robinson, who is
n aiing the end o!' his playing days,
showed his old power by belting a

At this point, Zimmer, who was

YANKS 'HE GAME
In their half of the second, the
Yanks came hack to score twice and
tie up the game. Don Newcombe,
:h'c of the Brooklyn mound staff and
20-game winner this year, opened
the way for Casey Stengel's troops
by giving up a walk to Collins with
one out. The next batter, Elston
Howard, took a called strike and
then leaned into a Newcombe fast
ball and hit it on a line 315 feet into
the lower left field tier. Howard,
first. Negro ever to appear in a
World Series in a Yankee uniform,
took over the left field chores today
as Irv Noren moved over into center
field to replace Mickey Mantle,
whose leg injury didn't come around
fast enough to allow him to get into
today's fray.
With the score reading two runs

apiece in the top of the third, Dodg
er eenterfielder Duke Snider got
hold of one o! Ford's pitches and
bflted it into the uj . er ii lit field
stands. Tie homer was Snider's
sixth in World Series play. This is
a record for National Leaguers, al
though Dale Euth holds the all
time record for Series homers with
If).
The Yankees were not to I • de
nied, however, as they once again
tifd up the fame with a si rude run
in their half of the inning. This
time Newcombe once aeain brought
about his own downfall by issuing
a walk to Ford to start th? inning.

ond and then I oth runners moved
up a la:e as Gil McDouyald hit a
slow roller to Pee Wee Reeve. With
one man out, For I brou' lit in the
tying run as Irv N.iian grounded
out to Zimmer.
YANKS LI-.'A I)
In the Npw York half c!' the
fourth, the Yanks took over to go
into the lead for the first time. After
this time the Dodgers could never
catch up. It was the first man to face
Newcombe in the inning, Joe Col
lins. Collins, who had earlier walked
and scored on Elston's homer,
smacked one himself this time. The
ball landed several rows back in the
lower right field stands some 315
feet from home plate.
Two innings later the Yankees
sewed up the game with two more
runs. With one out, Berra singled
to right and Collins followed with
his second homer of the game. This
gave the winners a G-.'i advantage
and the Dodgers were never able to
catch up even though they made it
uncomfortably close in the late in
nings.
In the top of the eighth, Gil Mc-
Dougald's error, the only one of the
game, paved the way for two un
earned Brooklyn runs. The first bat
ter of the jrame, Furillo. singled and
after Gil Hodges flied out, Robinson
whacked a hot grounder which the
New York third baseman couldn't
handle and by the time the ball was
retrieved, Furillo ended up at third
and Robinson at second.
Furillo came in on Zimmer's long
sacrifice fly and Robinson took third
on the play. At this point, the aging
Dodger third baseman brought the
crowd to its feet by taking advan
tage of Ford's long windup to race
down the base path and score on a
close play at the plate. The play
brought a heated protest from the
Yanks, especially catcher Yogi Ber
ra, but to no avail.
