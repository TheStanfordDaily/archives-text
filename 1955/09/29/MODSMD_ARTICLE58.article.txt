INDIAN BRAIN TRUSTâ€”Head gridiron coach Chuck Taylor gathers with his varsity assistants
to discuss the strategy they plan against Howard (Hcpalong) Cassady and his Ohio State team
mates this Saturday. From left to right are George Lynn, Pete Kinetovic, Taylor, Joe Ruetz, Eob
GhilcUi, and Dutch Fehring. Kmetovic was a mate of Taylor on the famous "Wow Boys" team
in 1940, returning a punt to pay dirt in the 1941 Rose Bowl against Nebraska. Ruetz is former
St. Mary's College head pigskin coach. Lynn is an ex-assistant of Bud Wilkinson in Oklahoma,
while Fehring won All-American recognition at Purdue in 1933. Ghilotti, Indian gridder in 1947
and 1948, succeeded Taylor as freshman mentor in 1950.
