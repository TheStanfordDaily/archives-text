# Halfback Lou Valli Will Play Against Buckeyes; Gordy Young to Miss Tilt
## 
### 
The announcement by trainer
Connie Jarvis that halfback Lou
Valli may see limited action against
Ohio State highlighted yesterday's
practice session. Valli, who has been
suffering from a knee injury, re
sponded to treatment and should be
ready to roll against the Buckeyes.
Bad news accompanied the Valli
disclosure, however, when it was
announced that Gordy Young, an
other halfback, will definitely miss
the battle with the Big 10 challen
gers. An injured rib has been keep
ing Young, a first stringer last year,
out of action.
Center Don Geddes, tackle Chris
Plain, and end Joel Freis are also
out of the Buckeye tussle.
The Indians worked mostly on de
fense yesterday. Coach Chuck Tay
lor claims he knows very little about
the Ohio State offense, but has been
working against a straight T forma
tion. The Buckeyes are reported to
run off of the straight T, featuring
the breakaway threat of halfbacks
Howard (Hopalong) Cassady and
Jerry Harkrader.
Coach Taylor plans to use his

ground game more against the mid
western visitor than in the two pre
vious tilts. Halfbacks Ernie Dorn
| and Paul Camera and fullback Bill
I Tarr can be expected to carry the
i brunt of the Card rushing attack.
"We plan no change at the quar
j terback position," declares Taylor.
Jackie Douglas completed the only
I touchdown pass against the Oregon
State Beavers, although the play
I was called back, and starter Jerry
! Gustafson had three tosses inter
cepted thus .starting some specula
tion as to who would draw the start
j ing role against the Bucks. Jolm
Brodie, the nation's fourth leading
i passer in 1954, was also consid
; ered.
Brave quarterback Jack Lewis
and tackle Gary Allen sustained in
i juries, but will probably see limited
! action aaginst Cal's Ramblers on
Saturday. Lewis suffered a frac
tured index finger in his left hand
j and will probably split the signal
| calling duties with sophomore Les
j Hopkins. Allen, a soph slated to
[ open against the Ramblers, was in
-1 jured with a shoulder separation.

Jackie Douglas completed the only
I touchdown pass against the Oregon

j ing role against the Bucks. Jolm
Brodie, the nation's fourth leading

j Hopkins. Allen, a soph slated to
