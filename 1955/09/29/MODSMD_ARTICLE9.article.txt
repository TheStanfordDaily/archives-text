MEXICO CITY, Sept. 28 (UP) j
â€”Killer hurricane Janet blasted
a 70-mile-wide path of death and
terror across the Yucatan penin
sula today and the presidential
office said first reports indicated
"at least 200 persons" were
killed.
The bodies of 97 persons, mostly
children, were reported found in j
Xcalak 200 miles southeast of Te
rida, Yucatan.
Hundreds of others were reported I
injured as the vicious tropical storm, j
the third to strike Mexico in 22 days, j
ripped at least two towns apart and
threatened to heap new death and
desolation on Mexico's battered Gulf |
coast.
The presidential oflice feared the
death toll might go higtier. Several
small towns were still out of com- *
munication with radio points
throughout the country although |
they were known to have portable !
generators for their transmitters.
