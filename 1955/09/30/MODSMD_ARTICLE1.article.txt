In June of 1947, a Greek Ortho

tered Eastern Christians in a district
of Salzburg, Austria, arrived in
England hoping to obtain food and
clothes for his people, many of
whom were displaced persons. He
was ill on arrival but after a few
weeks had recovered enough to go
about seeking aid.
While in England, he happened to
contact an English girl who lived in
Lagunita. She arranged for Lagu
nita to send St. Johann a few CARE
packages. These packages were so
well received that Lagunita ex
panded its aid and began holding
the Farm Fair since 1948 for just
that purpose.
The Fair has been continued with
great success since then. This year's
overall chairman of the Fair is Pau
lette Grantham.

The Farm Fair was instituted
shortly after World War II as a
method of raising money for foreign
relief, especially for the village of
St. Johann.
In June of 1947, a Greek Ortho
dox missionary in charge of scat
tered Eastern Christians in a district
of Salzburg, Austria, arrived in
England hoping to obtain food and
clothes for his people, many of
whom were displaced persons. He
was ill on arrival but after a few
weeks had recovered enough to go
about seeking aid.
While in England, he happened to
contact an English girl who lived in
Lagunita. She arranged for Lagu
nita to send St. Johann a few CARE
packages. These packages were so
well received that Lagunita ex
panded its aid and began holding
the Farm Fair since 1948 for just
that purpose.
The Fair has been continued with
great success since then. This year's
overall chairman of the Fair is Pau
lette Grantham.
