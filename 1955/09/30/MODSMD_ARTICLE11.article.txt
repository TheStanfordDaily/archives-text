# 'Back to Farm' Week Displays Begin Tuesday
## 
### 
Displays around campus, including
window dressing at the bookstore,
will kick off this year's "Back to the
Farm" week, originated in 1940. The
Cardinals-sponsored all-campus re
union will run from Tuesday through
Friday next week.
A display of old-time Stanford
fashions has been borrowed from
the Museum to provide the book
store decoration.
This year's Olympic Day races
will again feature the annual sheet
clad, torch-bearing relay from the
Cellar to Rudy's, while the T'heta Xi
jazz band leads an all-campus motor
parade out to Rudy's. Cars from
every living group on campus are
expected to join the Friday after
noon caravan.
Emphasis this year will be placed
on strengthening the traditionally
close relationships between students
and faculty. Some 200 professors will
dine at campus living groups or
have students in their homes Wed
nesday evening and will then attend
the "Farm Follies," a student-faculty
talent show, at 7:30 p.m. in Frost
Amphitheater.
Student-faculty games of volley
ball and softball will be played on
Thursday. For the charley - horse
conscious there will be bridge con
tests. Sign-up sheets are being post
ed in campus living groups for stu
dents participating.
