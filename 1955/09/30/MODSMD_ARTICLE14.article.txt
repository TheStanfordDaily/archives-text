# Reds Withdraw Korea Troops
## 
### 
TOKYO â€” Communist China an
nounced today it will withdraw six
of its ground divisions from North
Korea next month.
On the basis of estimates by U.S.
military officials this would amount
to about 90,000 troops, or a 20 per
cent cut in the force of 450,000 sol

diers Red China is believed to have
in North Korea.
Since United Nations and Com
munist armies in Korea are believed
to be numerically about the same
at the moment, the withdrawal
would leave the U.N. with the big
ger force. The announcement of the
withdrawal was made by Peiping
radio.
