# Ike's Condition Said Favorable

### 
DENVER—President Eisenhower's
physicians regarded his condition as
so favorable today that they gave
him permission to initial two state
documents by the end of the week.
This will be only a week after he
suffered a coronary thrombosis — a
blood clot in a heart muscle—at 1
a.m. (PST) last Saturday in the
home of his mother-in-law, Mrs.
John S. Doud.
Presidential Press Secretary
James Hagerty said today that if
the President's progress continues to
be satisfactory, he may be able to
do the lightest kind of official work
at the end of two weeks.
