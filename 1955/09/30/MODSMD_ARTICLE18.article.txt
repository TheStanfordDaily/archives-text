# Those Good OI' College Songs Are Back on the Farm Again
## 
### RIC TEAGUE 
Sometime between the time a student leaves Stanford and his
40th birthday, his interest in the Old College Songs flags. But
eventually he returns to the campus to see a football game and
asks: "Whatever became of some of the Old College Songs we
used to sing—they were real rousers."
If any old grads come to the Ohio State game tomorrow, they

will find that at least one Old Col
lege Song has been restored.
Head yell leader Jim Walters and
band director Julius Shuchat have
returned "The Stanford Victory
Song y to the band's book as the
first step in a restoration program
which Walters feels "will return a
lot of good songs to the football
games.
"One campus standard for many
years, 'The Drinking Song' (you
know, 'For it's beer, beer, beer, . . .'),
will also be added for the Ohio State
game, and we are planning to add
'The Cardinal Fight Song,' an inte
grated yell - song, for the UCLA
game.
"Both this one and 'The Stanford
Victory Song' were written by two
members of the class of '13. They're
a couple of real oldies."

Walters and Shuchat will offer
"The Stanford Victory Song" and
"The Drinking Song" at the rally
tonight. The head yell leader is an
xious that students J earn the words
to tonight's songs before the rally
because there will not be sufficient
light to read by at 7:30 p.m. in the
Sunken Diamond.
Some minor changes in the ar
rangement of "Come Join the Band"
and in "Hail Stanford Hail" are de
signed to add more punch to the or
chestrations but will not affect the
singers. Jon Elkus, who has done
considerable arranging for Cal's
football band, is handling most of
the arranging and rearranging in
this move to pep up Stanford's foot
ball song repertoire.
Among other Old School Songs,
Walters anticipates adding to the
book are "A Son of a Gambolier"
and"The Big Red Machine," the
latter from the 1950 Big Game Gaie
ties.
For tonight's rally, the band has
taken the old campus favorite about
beer, beer, beer, etc., and, for the
first time in its long and checkered
history, set it to gridiron music.
Walters will call out the key words
as it is sung.
After the familiar verse, the men
will sing chorus "A" and the women
will sing chorus "B."
CHORUS A
Mine eyes are dim,
I cannot see.
I have (HEY) not (HO)
Brought my spccs with me.
CHORUS B
Mine eyes are dim, I cannot
see.
I have not brought my specs
with me.
I have (HEY) not (HO)
Brought my specs with me.
In chorus "A" the men sing the
slow chorus while, at the same time,
the women sing chorus "B," the last
chorus. Any sophomore or above
can explain it.
"The Stanford Victory Song" is a
venerable piece of music. Written
12 years ago by a pair of seniors, it
used to go by the name "When Stan
ford Whips the Golden Bear Again."
Since Stanford hasn't whipped the
Golden Bear lately, the title was
shortened.
Here are the words. The song will
be sung tonight at the rally if a
sufficient*number of students know
the words.
When Stanford whips the Golden
Bear again,
And the Cardinal waves on high,
We'll a shout lor Stanford men,
And the spirit that will not die.
When Stanford fighting wins a vic
tory
And the Cardinal waves supreme,
We'll .shout again for Stanford men,
Give :< cheer for the Stanford tejin.

chestrations but will not affect the
singers. Jon Elkus, who has done
considerable arranging for Cal's
football band, is handling most of
the arranging and rearranging in
this move to pep up Stanford's foot
ball song repertoire.
Among other Old School Songs,
Walters anticipates adding to the
book are "A Son of a Gambolier"
and"The Big Red Machine," the
latter from the 1950 Big Game Gaie
ties.
For tonight's rally, the band has
taken the old campus favorite about
beer, beer, beer, etc., and, for the
first time in its long and checkered
history, set it to gridiron music.
Walters will call out the key words
as it is sung.
After the familiar verse, the men
will sing chorus "A" and the women
will sing chorus "B."
CHORUS A
Mine eyes are dim,
I cannot see.
I have (HEY) not (HO)
Brought my spccs with me.
CHORUS B
Mine eyes are dim, I cannot
see.
I have not brought my specs
with me.
I have (HEY) not (HO)
Brought my specs with me.
In chorus "A" the men sing the
slow chorus while, at the same time,
the women sing chorus "B," the last
chorus. Any sophomore or above
can explain it.
"The Stanford Victory Song" is a
venerable piece of music. Written
12 years ago by a pair of seniors, it
used to go by the name "When Stan
ford Whips the Golden Bear Again."
Since Stanford hasn't whipped the
Golden Bear lately, the title was
shortened.
Here are the words. The song will
be sung tonight at the rally if a
sufficient*number of students know
the words.
When Stanford whips the Golden
Bear again,
And the Cardinal waves on high,
We'll a shout lor Stanford men,
And the spirit that will not die.
When Stanford fighting wins a vic
tory
And the Cardinal waves supreme,
We'll .shout again for Stanford men,
Give :< cheer for the Stanford tejin.
Sometime between the time a student leaves Stanford and his
40th birthday, his interest in the Old College Songs flags. But
eventually he returns to the campus to see a football game and
asks: "Whatever became of some of the Old College Songs we
used to sing—they were real rousers."
If any old grads come to the Ohio State game tomorrow, they

will find that at least one Old Col
lege Song has been restored.
Head yell leader Jim Walters and
band director Julius Shuchat have
returned "The Stanford Victory
Song y to the band's book as the
first step in a restoration program
which Walters feels "will return a
lot of good songs to the football
games.
"One campus standard for many
years, 'The Drinking Song' (you
know, 'For it's beer, beer, beer, . . .'),
will also be added for the Ohio State
game, and we are planning to add
'The Cardinal Fight Song,' an inte
grated yell - song, for the UCLA
game.
"Both this one and 'The Stanford
Victory Song' were written by two
members of the class of '13. They're
a couple of real oldies."

Walters and Shuchat will offer
"The Stanford Victory Song" and
"The Drinking Song" at the rally
tonight. The head yell leader is an
xious that students J earn the words
to tonight's songs before the rally
because there will not be sufficient
light to read by at 7:30 p.m. in the
Sunken Diamond.
