# Stanford Will Meet Ohio State In Video ‘Battle of the Week'
## Cards Seek Upset of Visitors, But Odds Say 'Buckeyes by 7 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Tomorrow afternoon at about ten minutes to one, two group:!
of healthy young athletes will come trotting lightly out on the
greensward of Stanford Stadium. One of these groups is repr«
senting Ohio State University, defending national champions. Tlio
other is Stanford's band of Indians, still smarting from a 10-0 defeat
aaa, last weekend at the hands of lowly

Oregon State, a two-touchdown un
derdog.
Coach Chuck Taylor, whose con
stant optimism in the face of adver
sity prompts occasional tolerant
amusement but more often an un
easy watchfulness, thinks that the
Indians have an excellent opportu
nity of knocking off the Buckeyes.
At the last word available. Ohio
State's Coach Woody Hayes had not
committed himself.
Admittedly this Ohio State team,
winners of a 28-20 decision over
Nebraska, is not the Ohio State team

Guthrie and Roth will hold an
i pen house immediately after the
Ohio State game, at Roth House.

that Hayes guided to the Big Ten
title, the Rose Bowl, and the mythi
cal national championship last year.
Only two starters from that lineup
remain. This year the fortunes of
the Buckeyes seem to ride largely
on the back of one man. That back
has a large number 40 on it and the
man is All-American halfback How
ard Cassady.
With the notable exception of
Cassady, the Buckeye backfielrl it,
somewhat inexperienced. Woo rl y
Hayes lost two very fine plsyeii,

with the graduation of quarterback
Davy Leggett and the academic dif
ficulties of fullback Hubert Bobo.
HOPPY OHIO HERO
Ohioans hail "Hopalong" as one
of the greatest performers in Buck
eye grid history. He is rencwned as
i brilliant clutch performer on of
fense and also is regarded as a sound
defensive player.
Stanford's carrot - topped coach
plans nothing special to stop Ca.s
sady. "He's just another bail-play
er," Chuck says. "They've got a lot
of good bnys."
The other boys Taylor refers to
include Cassady's running mate al
left half, Jerry Haikrader, quarter
back Frank Ellwood, and fullback

Don Vicis. The Buckeye line will
probably consist of ends Leo Brown
i and Bill Michael, tackles Francis
Machinsky and Dick Guy, guards
Dave Weaver and Jim Parker, and
I center Ken Vargo.
CARDS READY
Despite Stanford's ignominious
loss to the Webfoots, this is still the
Stanford team that UCLA coach Red
Sanders thinks could go to the Rose
Bowl. The Cards are eager to get
back in the win column and this
nationally televised contest looks to
them like just the place to do jt.
Running through a light workout
yesterday, Stanford looked sharp.
For the Indians the injury situa
tion is just about the same. The
announcement came midweek that
soph halfback Lou Valli, who had a
knee injury, would be able to play.
It now seems certain that Valli will
be in top shape. Gordy Young, start
ing halfback last year, is still out
with a rib injury. End Joel Freis,
center Don Geddes, and tackle Cris
Plain are all definitely out also.
Back A 1 Harrington, a JC transfer,
is a question mark. Harrington has
been hampered by a bad foot.
INDIAN LINEUP
As it stands Taylor will start
John Stewart at left end; Chris Mar
-5 shall, left tackle; Tony Mosich, left

guard; Joe Long, center; Dunn Cars
well, right guard; Paul Wiggin, right
tackle; Jerry Beatie, right end. In
the backfield it will be Jerry Gus
tafson at quarter; Paul Camera, left
half; Ernie Dorn, right half; and Bill
Tarr, fullback.
Tarr, the Bellingham, Washing
ton, bomber, has been appointed
game captain.
There has been speculation over
the choice of a quai terback since !
Jack Douglas, the tennis player from
Santa Monica, parsed for the only
TD against Oregon State only to
have it called back on u penalty.
Taylor has indicated, though, that
he is solidly behind Gustafson, cur
rently the FCC leader iri passing of
fense. John Stewart leads the con
ference in pass receptions, and Tan
is second in rushing.
Douglas, a sophomore who looks
too little to be a quarterback, is the
latest in a long line of quarterbacks
from Santa Monica that includes
Ronnie Knox and Sandy Leder
mun.
PASSING WEAK
The Buckeyes work largely from
a straight T formation on offense and
Taylor has been preparing the Card
defense accordingly. Woody Hayes
depends largely on a running at
tack, and the C'hio State passing is
rated only fair.
With this information available it
will surprise no one very much if
Taylor gambles a little with his de
fense by going all-out to stop the I
Buckeye running and largely ig
nores the potential passing attack.
