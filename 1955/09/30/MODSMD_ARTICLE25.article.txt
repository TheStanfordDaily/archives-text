# the 						‘new look'

### 
The Stanford band unveils its "new look" at
the Ohio State game tomorrow. The "new
look" consists of West Point style uniforms and
an expanded company. But that isn't all that's
new with the band.
The organization has undergone an almost
complete revamping job replete with new ar
rangements to old songs and a sparkling re
vival of Stanford's classic drinking song.
| This reorganization was needed—that's ob
vious. The way in which it was accomplished
is worth noting. For years the band has been
financed completely through an athletic de
partment budget of $7,000 per annum. At UC
LA and USC ten times that amount is spent
yearly on the bands. At Southern California
they hire a professional arranger. Perhaps the
prestige these universities get from their bands
is worth the money. Still, that's guite an in
vestment even for the high prestige return.
The prestige of a top band is invaluable to
any university. However, if that prestige is
bought at so dear a price and with the aid of
outside, professional talent, then it may not be
truly worth while to students.
New, with the "new look" and all that goes
with it being brought to the Stanford band
wo can get that prestige. But not prestige

bought at the high price that some others have
paid.
It is coming here through the work of stu
dents, operating on a $7,000 budget. The only
added expense was the $10,000 needed for the
new uniforms, the first extra expense in ten
years.
All the new arrangements were written by
students, all the music is played by students.
Saturday afternoon we'll see and hear the
results of the band's revamping. So will na
tionwide television viewers. They'll see the
biggest band on the Pacific Coast. And prob
ably the best.
A band which is completely student organ
ized and operated.
an improvement, but . . .
Last autumn we stood in two long, long lines
for football tickets. This autumn we also stood
in long, long lines for football tickets. But in
three lines rather than in two.
This is an improvement of an extremely in
convenient situation. But the ticket selling set
up is still far from practical. Perhaps next au
tumn another line or two can be added.
It's worth a thought, and it's certainly
needed.
