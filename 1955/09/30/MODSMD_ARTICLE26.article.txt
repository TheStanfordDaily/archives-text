No through traffic.
That is the sign that greets Stanford stu
dents as they head down Santa Teresa Street
toward Roble and Lagunita. It means that, if
they want to get off campus, ihey must turn
around by Lagunita Court and either swing
past the Knoll, or up the Row by the Phi Siq
house onto Junipero Serra or down Palrri Drive
to El Carnino Real.
The road was blocked off only recently,
when construction crews completed the Wi!
low Road extension which runs from the new
Stanford Shopping Center along San I'rancis
quito Creek to the Alpine, Sandhill, Junipero
Serra intersection.
It was not blocked off permanently. Accord
ing to University officials, it was barricaded
only so people, who previously had been using
the campus as a "quicker" v/ay into Palo Alto,
could discover the advantages of the new part
of Willow Road.
However, University officials are not entirely
agreed as to whether this strip of road, in par
ticular the piece connecting Santa Teresa with
Junipero Serra Boulevard, should or should not
be blocked off permanently.
Police Chief Gordon Davis, whose staff
counted 1,400 cars using Santa Teresa as a
through street every day, believes it should
bo closed. Other officials believe that halting
through traffic past Lag is an annoyance to the
students and an annoyance that might create
more serious traffic problems. '
Students, with an eye to the fact that Ros
sotti's lies out Alpine Road, are inclined to
agree with the latter statement. Others fore

see new tieups at the Post Office and on the
How and still more find the new barricades
nuisances. Here are seme of the comments:
Tom Dant, '57—"Well, if they are planning
to close off the road by Branner for a while
when they put in the new road, they ought to
leave some way open for people to get off
campus besides the Row and Palm Drive. Olh
crwise, everyone has to go by the Post Office
and traffic is snarled up enough there as it is."
Another student, Carol Lynch, 'SG, raised an
other point -"What will the people who go to
Stanford and live in Menlo Park do? How do
they get onto campus in the morning?"
Chuck Arledge, '59, stated, "It only makes
it twice as difficult to get to the golf course,"
and Kent Kassady, '58, said, "This certainly
cramps the TGlP'ers' style and therefore, I
would label it a crisis."
Other students considered the problems
that might arise if the road by the Phi Sig house
were forced to carry more traffic and if Palm
Drive, already crowded, received a heavier
load of cars.
Most of them felt that, although traffic on
Santa Teresa might be hazardous, it would be
nothing compared to the Row and Palm Drive,
if the barricades were continued.
However, Nancy Wiser, '57, said, "It's a nui
sance and a bother to the kids who were here
when it was open, but I suppose we'll get used
to it if they leave it closed long enough"; and
Barbara Roche, '56, offered the suggestion that
"all cars be banned from the campus and ev
eryone could ride bicycles."

What do you think?
No through traffic.
That is the sign that greets Stanford stu
dents as they head down Santa Teresa Street
toward Roble and Lagunita. It means that, if
they want to get off campus, ihey must turn
around by Lagunita Court and either swing
past the Knoll, or up the Row by the Phi Siq
house onto Junipero Serra or down Palrri Drive
to El Carnino Real.
The road was blocked off only recently,
when construction crews completed the Wi!
low Road extension which runs from the new
Stanford Shopping Center along San I'rancis
quito Creek to the Alpine, Sandhill, Junipero
Serra intersection.
It was not blocked off permanently. Accord
ing to University officials, it was barricaded
only so people, who previously had been using
the campus as a "quicker" v/ay into Palo Alto,
could discover the advantages of the new part
of Willow Road.
However, University officials are not entirely
agreed as to whether this strip of road, in par
ticular the piece connecting Santa Teresa with
Junipero Serra Boulevard, should or should not
be blocked off permanently.
Police Chief Gordon Davis, whose staff
counted 1,400 cars using Santa Teresa as a
through street every day, believes it should
bo closed. Other officials believe that halting
through traffic past Lag is an annoyance to the
students and an annoyance that might create
more serious traffic problems. '
Students, with an eye to the fact that Ros
sotti's lies out Alpine Road, are inclined to
agree with the latter statement. Others fore

see new tieups at the Post Office and on the
How and still more find the new barricades
nuisances. Here are seme of the comments:
Tom Dant, '57—"Well, if they are planning
to close off the road by Branner for a while
when they put in the new road, they ought to
leave some way open for people to get off
campus besides the Row and Palm Drive. Olh
crwise, everyone has to go by the Post Office
and traffic is snarled up enough there as it is."
Another student, Carol Lynch, 'SG, raised an
other point -"What will the people who go to
Stanford and live in Menlo Park do? How do
they get onto campus in the morning?"
Chuck Arledge, '59, stated, "It only makes
it twice as difficult to get to the golf course,"
and Kent Kassady, '58, said, "This certainly
cramps the TGlP'ers' style and therefore, I
would label it a crisis."
Other students considered the problems
that might arise if the road by the Phi Sig house
were forced to carry more traffic and if Palm
Drive, already crowded, received a heavier
load of cars.
Most of them felt that, although traffic on
Santa Teresa might be hazardous, it would be
nothing compared to the Row and Palm Drive,
if the barricades were continued.
However, Nancy Wiser, '57, said, "It's a nui
sance and a bother to the kids who were here
when it was open, but I suppose we'll get used
to it if they leave it closed long enough"; and
Barbara Roche, '56, offered the suggestion that
"all cars be banned from the campus and ev
eryone could ride bicycles."
