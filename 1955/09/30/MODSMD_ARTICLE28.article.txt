# Indian Band to Display ‘New Look' In Televised Battle with Ohio State
## Members Exhibit Bright Uniforms 
### DAVE SCOTT 
* Television viewers from coast
to coast will get a treat during
the half - time cf tomorrow's
Stanford Ohio State game as a
completely revamped Stanford
oand will make its debut.
The featured item in the new
look will be $10,000 worth of new
band uniforms. The old uniform
tyle has been junked, and the new
jardinal-and-white attire will be
We >t Point style, complete with hat
plumes and coat tails.
The band will also be larger, hav
ing been expanded from 80 to 120
members. New arrangements of the
_>!d familiar pieces such as "Come,
Join the Band" will be presented.
And a rousing version of Stanford's
drinking Jong, "Beer, Beer, Beer,"
will be presented for the first time
to the public.
At this particular game the band's
urogram will consist of a medley of
Stephen Foster songs. The national
television viewers will miss hearing
a few of the old-time favorites be
cause the NBC -TV network has
ruled that no mention be made of
the Negro in such programs; so com
mercials will be shown during the
band's rendition of "Old Black Joe"
and "Swanee River," according to
a band spokesman.
In future games there will be ar
rangements of Walt Disney and
Glenn Miller songs. All special ar
rangements are planned by mem
bers of the band.
Also, in all future games the band
will move from its traditional seat
: ing place in front of the stands to
the front rows of the rooting sec
; tion.
The band is entirely financed
| through the Athletic Department
and has an annual budget of $7,000,
which is much less than either USC,
■ UCLA or Cal spend on their bands.
And $5,000 of this is spent on the
trip to Southern California alone.
The $10,000 spent on uniforms is the
first extra amount spent in about 10
| years.
Tentative future plans include the
building of a new band shack and
buying a complete new set of instru-
I ments.
Directing the band again this year
is Julius Schuchat. George Sheldon
is drum major and Don Wells band
I manager.
