# On Campus With Max Shulman
## ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH 
### Author of "Barefoot Boy With Cheek," etc 
Today 1 begin my second year of writing this column for
Philip Morris Cigarettes. Once every week during the coming
school year J will take up, without fear or favor, issues that
inflame the minds and quicken the hearts of college students
everywhere. I will grapple with such knotty questions as: "Is
compulsory attendance the reflection of an insecure faculty?"
and "Is the unmarried student obsolete?" and "Ar* room-mates
sanitary?"

While each week I make a bold assault upon these burning
issues, 1 will also attempt to beguile you into smoking Philip
Morris Cigarettes. Into each column 1 will craftily weave some

words in praise 01 rnnip
Morris. 1 will extol, ob
liquely, the benign mild
ness of Philip Morris's
well-born tobacco, its
soothing fragrance, its
tonic freshness, its docile
temperateness, its oh-so
welcome gentleness in this
spiky and abrasive world
of ours.
For saying these kind
things about their ciga
rettes, the Philip Morris
Company will pay me
money. This is the Ameri
can Way. This is De
mocracy. This is Enlight
ened Self Interest. This

is the System that Made
Our Country Great, and anybody who doesn't like it is
MALA D.I USTED.
Perhaps il would lie well in this first column of the year to
tell you a little about myself. I am 'M\ years of age, but still
remarkably active. 1 am squat, moon-faced, have all my teeth,
and am fond of folk dancing and Lotto. My hobby is collecting
mucilage.

I first took up writing because I was too short to steal. Bare
foot Iloii With Chick was my maiden effort, and today, fourteen

years later, 1 continue to
write about collcge students.
This is called "arrested de
velopment."
15ut I can't help it.
Though I am now in the
winter of my life, the prob
)t ms of undergraduates still
seem to me as pressing as
ever. How to pursue a blaz
ing romance with exams
coming up next Friday in
physics, history and French ;
how to convince your stingy
father that life is a bitter
mockery without a yellow
convertible; how to subsist
on dormitory food these
remain the topics that roil
my sluggish blood.

And in this column from now until next June you will read
of such tilings: of dating and pinning, of fraternities and sorori
ties and independents, of cutting and cramming, of athletes and
average-raisers, of extra-and intra-curriculum, of textbooks and
those who write them and those who sell them and those who
read them and those who don't.
And, slyly woven into this stirring tapestry, the story of
Philip Morris, America's gentle cigarette, in the handy Snap-
Open pack, in king-size or regular, at prices all can afford.
