## Spaeth Criticized By Commentator

The $25,000 grant given to
Stanford Law School by the
Fund for the Republic has be
come a main target of attack by
radio commentator and news
columnist Fulton Lewis, Jr., as
he levied bitter words against
the Fund and its activities.
The study grunt was offered to
the law school for an impartial anal
ysis of the testimony of witnesses
in legislative and judicial proceed
ings relative to Communism.
In addition to a broadside against
the University for permitting an in
vestigation of this sort to be con
ducted under its auspices, Lewis de
voted considerable radio time*to an
outspoken criticism of Dean Carl
Spaeth of the Law School, head of
the law school study Herbert Packer,
and the Fund's president Robert
Hutchins and vice-presient W. H.
Ferry.
Doubting the value and objec
tivity of the Fund's study, Lewis
questions the integrity of the organ
ization in using funds which are de
clared tax free because they are
used for the benefit of the public
at-large.
In singling out Dean Spaeth for
criticism, Lewis calls attention to
Spaeth's past State Department his
tory, and reported that he had be
come a "great friend" of Alger Hiss
and other liberals.
He also charged that the dean
"makes a great profession of his
close association and friendship with
Adlai Stevenson."
The radio commentator cited as
questionable various associates and
various organizations in which
Spaeth has been active, such as the
Ford Foundation and the Institute
of Pacific Relations.
In speaking on August 23 and 24
of Packer's appointment to the law
faculty, Lewis charged that Packer,
once a staff consultant for the Fund,
was brought onto the Stanford fac
ulty for the sole purpose of con
ducting the Fund's inquiry. Why, he
asks, if the inquest is to be impar
tial, does the law school itself not
conduct the survey?
"The obvious objective," Lewis
contends, "is to try to pick incon
sistencies or contradictions or flaws
in the testimony that has been given
by the various anti-Communist wit
nesses at various times before vari
ous committees, with a view to dis
crediting that testimony and those
who gave it."
Frederic O. Glover, assistant to
President Wallace Sterling, answered

that Packer was offered a position
on the faculty in 1953 and, contrary
to Lewis' charge, was not the Fund's

hand-picked choice and was not
even known to the Fund's president
at the time of his nomination to the
faculty.
Glover stressed the fact that the
inquiry will be purely objective and
that Stanford possesses the full re
sponsibility for the study and for
the publication of its findings.
Leveling a criticism against Stan
ford for nominating Packer to head
the study, Lewis asks: "Just why
should an institution-, as distin
guished and irreproachable as Le
land Stanford University, be allow
ing an outside individual to come in
and assume the dignity and prestige
of becoming a member of its faculty
in order to make such a study as
this one?

In answer to this, President Ster
ling issued a statement this month
which included the comment that
"the University reaffirms that one of
its chief , functions is to encourage
research into problems which indi
viduals or departments within the
University deem worthy of investi
gation."
