## 
### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 29 (UP)
Battling Tommy Byrne, showing
the class and the courage which
brought hirn back from baseball
oblivion, shattered the Brooklyn
Dodger jinx against left-handers
today by pitching and batting
the New York Yankees to a 4-2
second straight World Series
triumph.
Labeled l.y Manager Casey .Sten
gel as "tlii- name: l guy I've got,"

Byrne proved it before G4.707 roar
ing fans as he set the Dodgers down
with five scattered hits -and ham
mered home the two runs that
wrapped it up. It made him the first
southpaw to go the distance in beat
ing Brooklyn this season.
The cool Carolinian, whose wild
ness almost forced him out of base
ball two years ago, needed plenty
of help. But he got it as the Yan
kees contributed three double plays,
matched by the Dodgers, for a rec
ord of six in one Series contest.
The Yankees' 2-0 lead in the Se
ries put them in such a com

manning position that the Dodgers'
chances for taking their first classic
are without precedent. No team
ever has lost the first two games of
a seven-game series and gone on to
win the championship.
The loser, as the Dodgers shot des
perately for their first victory in this

classic and their...
initial overall So-,
lies triumph in '■
six tries, was';
young Billy Loos.J;
And the kid from t
Brooklyn was the *
victim of one of .
those typical,!
"big" Yankee in-J
nings. '
And it was

Byrne, the onetime "wild man from
Wake Forest, who broke their
backs with a bases - loaded single
that sent in the two final Yankee
runs. v
Loes was staggering by then as,
finally, Manager Walt Alston sent
him on the long walk to the shower
and brought in the second of four
Brooklyn pitchers.
It was too late, then. Because
while Brooklyn got one run back in

i the filth, Byrne's mixture ol' a blaz
j ing fast ball, a crackling curve, anci
I the new-found slider that brought
him back from Seattle shut them
| out the rest of the way with a tre-
I mendous assist from that air-tighl
J Yankee defense.
The Dodger pitching did not meas
ure up to the standard set by Byrne
Loes left the contest after Byrne hi I
his two-run single, and Don Bessenl
came on for Alston.
The Brooklyns scored first on <
double by Pee Wee Ree e and a sin
gle by Duke Snider, and ad.!ed then
final tally in the fifth. Jackie Robin
son walked, moved to third on ;
single and a double play, and scored
on Junior Gilliam's base hit.
The, jubilant Stengel, hugging
Byrne to him in an iron embrace
said happily that tomorrow it woulc
be "Bullet Bob" Turley with a 17-1-
season's record, shooting lor the
third straight Yankee win. Glumly
the Dodgers put the finger on sore
ribbed Johnny Podres, a 10-10 per
formed, to keep their hopes alive.
The Dodgers will make a switch
I too. Sandy Amoros will go into lef
i field and Gilliam to second base a
-1 Alston benches Zimrner, who madi
I two errors today.
i Brooklyn .... 000 1111 00ft—2 5 2
New York .... (100 10(1 000—1 S I)
LOES. Bessent, Spooncr, I abine
and Campanella; BYRNE and
Berra.
