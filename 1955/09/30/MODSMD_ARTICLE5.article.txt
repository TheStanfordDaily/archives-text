# Farm Scholarship Fund Will Benefit
## 
### 
Tonight's Joseph Magnin style
show at the Shopping Center is one
attempt to raise Stanford's scholar
ship fund, which has fallen far below
that of most comparable private in
stitutions.
Last year, out of the 1.300 fresh
men that appealed for scholarships,
the University could grant only 107.
Only nine per cent of Stanford un
dergraduates attend the University
on scholarship. At Princeton, 28 per I
cent of the enrollment are on some |
sort of scholarship; 27 per cent at
Yale. On the west coast, Cal Tech
has 27 per cent and Pomona 19 per
cent.
In order to put Stanford on a simi
lar basis, $400,000 a year is needed.
Most of the money for scholar
ships, which run from $125 to $1,650
each, must come from gifts of money
to be put to work right away. A
University committee then picks out
deserving students. However, many i
donors specify that their scholarships i
be given to specific departments. I
Tonight's Magnin show is one of â€¢
many attempts to bolster this cur- j
rent expense fund.
The other way that the University
raises its scholarship fund is through
endowments. Endowments are in
vested by the University, and the !
proceeds from them are used for !
scholarship. At present about $20,-
000 is needed for an annual full tui
tion scholarship.
