GUSHING WATER—Construction
crews working in the Eating Club
parking lot early yesterday after
noon broke a 4-inch water pipe
and the water burst forth. It filled
lip a 7-foot-deep trench before
the Corp yard was able to find
the shut-olf valve. Water ran for
about 40 minutes, and water serv
ice was not restored until 5:30
p.m.
