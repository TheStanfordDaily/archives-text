# 'Dix McSmear' Creator Says He Made 20 Prints
## Mystery Surrounds Disposition of Remaining Lithograph Caricature Banned at S.F. Art Show 
### FRANK HUNTRESS 
In the beginning there were 20. Somewhere along the line the
other 19 were forgotten.
Victor M. Arnautoff, an assistant professor of art at Stanford and
artist of the controversial caricature of Vice-President Richard
Nixon, said that he originally had made 20 color drawings labeled

"Dix McSmear." During the artistic
and political controversy, nothing
was mentioned of the other 19 car
toons picturing Nixon wearing a
mask and holding a paint brush and
a bucket labeled "smear" in one
hand and a pumpkin in the other.
ArnautofT stated that he entered
one of his 10-by-14-inch lithographs
in the San Francisco Art Festival,
Sept. 15 to 19, in the Civic Audi
torium.
His color cartoon hung in the au
ditorium only one day before Harold
Zellerbach, president of the Art
Commission which stages the festi
val, ordered it taken down. Zeller
bach stated that he had acted after
receiving a call purported to be from
the FBI.
GAVE FIVE AWAY
ArnautofT said that he gave five
cartoons away before the festival
began. He added that he is saving
the lithograph that hung in the audi
torium for one day for himself.
So far, he has sold eight of them—
seven for $25, and the other to a man
in Hillsborough for an undisclosed
price.
Marion H. Kent, the man from
Hillsborough to whom he sold one
of the 20 drawings, Sctid "the price
went up." Kent, a former chairman
of the Democrats' county central
committee, stated he would put the
drawing to some constructive use for
the Democratic party in San Mateo
County.
CARTOON PURCHASERS
Among the other purchasers of
the Nixon cartoon is a reputed writ
er, William Mandel, from New York
City.
ArnautofT said he received five of
the orders last Friday. He added that
the price is still $25, the same as in
dicated on the price tag when it hung
in the Civic Auditorium on Sept. 15.
Upon entering it in the Art Festi
val, he had to price it for insurance
reasons. He said he arbitrarily set
a figure of $25.
After the drawing had gained na
tional prominence, ArnautofT stated
that he had no intention of raising
the price. He still has no intention
of doing so.
ArnautofT explained that litho
graphs are labeled in much the same
way as rare editions of books—in
that only a prescribed number are
printed. In this case 20 prints were
made from stones with one color on
each. After he printed 20 with each
color, he destroyed the stones.
NO CRITICISM
During its brief stay in the audi
torium the color cartoon drew no
public criticism.
But after it was removed, it caused
one of the largest artistic and po
litical controversies to take place in
the Bay Area.
Joseph P. McMahon, assistant spe
cial agent in charge for the FBI in
San Francisco, said his office had
nothing to do with the telephone
call to Zellerbach. He added that
he knew no reason why his office
should make such a call.
Nixon, upon hearing of the draw
ing, backed the right of the artist
to criticize public officials.
Bay Area artists signed petitions
following the drawing's removal de
manding its return to his place in
the festival, demanding that "free
dom of expression" is a cherished
tradition in our country."

In the beginning there were 20. Somewhere along the line the
other 19 were forgotten.
Victor M. Arnautoff, an assistant professor of art at Stanford and
artist of the controversial caricature of Vice-President Richard
Nixon, said that he originally had made 20 color drawings labeled

"Dix McSmear." During the artistic
and political controversy, nothing
was mentioned of the other 19 car
toons picturing Nixon wearing a
mask and holding a paint brush and
a bucket labeled "smear" in one
hand and a pumpkin in the other.
ArnautofT stated that he entered
one of his 10-by-14-inch lithographs
in the San Francisco Art Festival,
Sept. 15 to 19, in the Civic Audi
torium.
His color cartoon hung in the au
ditorium only one day before Harold
Zellerbach, president of the Art
Commission which stages the festi
val, ordered it taken down. Zeller
bach stated that he had acted after
receiving a call purported to be from
the FBI.
GAVE FIVE AWAY
ArnautofT said that he gave five
cartoons away before the festival
began. He added that he is saving
the lithograph that hung in the audi
torium for one day for himself.
So far, he has sold eight of them—
seven for $25, and the other to a man
in Hillsborough for an undisclosed
price.
Marion H. Kent, the man from
Hillsborough to whom he sold one
of the 20 drawings, Sctid "the price
went up." Kent, a former chairman
of the Democrats' county central
committee, stated he would put the
drawing to some constructive use for
the Democratic party in San Mateo
County.
CARTOON PURCHASERS
Among the other purchasers of
the Nixon cartoon is a reputed writ
er, William Mandel, from New York
City.
ArnautofT said he received five of
the orders last Friday. He added that
the price is still $25, the same as in
dicated on the price tag when it hung
in the Civic Auditorium on Sept. 15.
Upon entering it in the Art Festi
val, he had to price it for insurance
reasons. He said he arbitrarily set
a figure of $25.
After the drawing had gained na
tional prominence, ArnautofT stated
that he had no intention of raising
the price. He still has no intention
of doing so.
ArnautofT explained that litho
graphs are labeled in much the same
way as rare editions of books—in
that only a prescribed number are
printed. In this case 20 prints were
made from stones with one color on
each. After he printed 20 with each
color, he destroyed the stones.
NO CRITICISM
During its brief stay in the audi
torium the color cartoon drew no
public criticism.
But after it was removed, it caused
one of the largest artistic and po
litical controversies to take place in
the Bay Area.
Joseph P. McMahon, assistant spe
cial agent in charge for the FBI in
San Francisco, said his office had
nothing to do with the telephone
call to Zellerbach. He added that
he knew no reason why his office
should make such a call.
Nixon, upon hearing of the draw
ing, backed the right of the artist
to criticize public officials.
Bay Area artists signed petitions
following the drawing's removal de
manding its return to his place in
the festival, demanding that "free
dom of expression" is a cherished
tradition in our country."
