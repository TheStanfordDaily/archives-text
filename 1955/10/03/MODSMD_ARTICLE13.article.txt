## 
### 
Freshman women will have an op
portunity to meet with women stu
dents active in campus functions
and women in key faculty and ad
ministration posts at a tea sponsored
by AWS Thursday at the Bowman
Alumni House from 3 to 5:30 p.m.
Hostesses for the get-together will
be students active in extracurricular
activities such as legislature, cap
and gown, and AWS cabinet mem
bers and presidents of living groups.
All freshman women are invited,
according to AWS president Harriet
Thomas. The tea is the first func
tion of its kind held at Stanford, but
AWS hopes to make it an annual
event. Miss Thomas said.
Co-chairmen of the tea are sopho
mores Betsy Adams and Lee Clinch,
who last year served as the repre
sentatives from the freshman wo
men dormitories to AWS.
The tea will be on an informal
basis, according to the chairmen,
with "refreshments and conversa
tion" the main order of the after
noon to give those attending a chance
to get to know each other.
The function is being held in co
operation with "Back to the Farm"
week, the goal of which is improv
ing faculty-student relations.
Other activities to bo held during
"Back to the Farm" week include
student-faculty dinners, the "Farm
Follies" and Olympic Day.
