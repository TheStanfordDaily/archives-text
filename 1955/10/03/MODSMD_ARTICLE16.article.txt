# Powerful Defense Holds Buckeyes, Howard Cassady
## Cards Score Early in Game on Pass, Then Hang On to Stop Visitors for Win 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
It might all be summed up this way: The Buckeye is a pictty
tough nut, but it can be cracked.
Stanford found this out by cracking Ohio State 6 to 0, much to
Ihe astonishment of several million people gathered iferound their
TV sets and the 30,000 in Stanford Stadium.
Many of the principals seemed stunned by this turn of events,

including the Cards' cheerful men-'
tor, Chuck Taylor. Taylor, of course,
expected to win, but a shutout of
the Buckeyes was something even
he hadn't dreamed of.
This underestimation of the In
dians on Chuck's part is easily ex
cused, however. The Indians' accom
plishment in beating and at the same
time holding scoreless the Bucks is
a feat rough comparable to beating
the Yankees in the World Series.
Coach Woody Hayes appeared to
be a ruined man as he began his
long trek back to tell the alumni
association at Columbus just why
his winning streak was broken at
12 and why his heralded star How
ard Cassady was held to a paltry
37 yards.
POOR IIOPPY!
None of the blame should be put
on Cassady's shoulders. Hoppy tried
hard, but there were just too many
bad Indians—Joe Long, Tony Mo
sich, Paul Wiggin, Donn Carswell.
And the biggest, baddest Indian of
them all was Bill Tarr.
Tarr, who was game captain for
the Cards, carried the ball for 102
yards, grinding off an average of 5.1
yards at a crack. Booming Bill's de
fensive work was nothing but solid,
too.
"We can do fetter on offense,"
Taylor said, "but I think this was a
real defensive test." The young
coach had nothing but praise for all
of his men. "The whole line gets
credit for a magnificent effort—Mo
sich, Wiggin, Tarr, everyone was
great."
ONLY TOUCHDOWN
Stanford won it this way. The
Cards took opening kickoff, were
set back a bit by a penalty, started
from their own 29, drove to the
Buckeye two; Gustafson set up the
Ohio Staters for a line plunge, faked,
then passed to Paul Camera in the
end zone. Mickey Raftery's PAT
attempt was blocked.
And that was the end of the scor
ing. The rest of the game featured
mostly unspectacular, sound defen
sive play. Occasionally excitement
would generate as one team would
drive down within scoring range,
but the defense always held.
Taylor's plan was to contain Cas
sady, give up ground through the
middle if necessary, but quell all
breakaway threats. The Indians did
this with splendid exactitude. Cas
sady revealed himself as a poten
tially dangerous runner, but it was
always only the potential danger.
He was never given the opportunity
to get loose. The breakaway never
came.
OHIO DRIVES FAIL
The Indians did give up ground
through the middle. Fullback Don
Vicic turned out to be a better run
ner than had been expected. Right
half Jerry Harkrader was a con
sistent gainer. But they never got
loose, and the Buckeye drives al
ways bogged down sooner or later.
The Cards drove themselves. It
looked like another sure TD in the
second quarter as Gustafson piloted
the Indians well down within Ohio
State territory, but then Gus had
the wind knocked out of him and
was forced to leave the game.
John Brodie came in and the drive
stopped cold while Brodie was get
ting his bearings and the team was
adjusting to the new quarterback.
The game was, by the way, some
thing of a personal triumph for Gus
tafson, who gave what was possibly
his finest all-around quarterbaeking
performance on the home turf. But,
as Taylor said, all the boys came
through.
The line was simply superb in
stopping Cassady. Mosich, Long or
Wiggin was right on Hoppy all after
noon. This game, Taylor cautiously
opined, should earn Tarr All-Amer
ica consideration.
INDIAN TALENT '
Paul Camera and A 1 Harrington
both left no doubt about the fact
that they are boys with a future.

Ernie Dorn, the veteran of the back
field, gave his usual competent dis
play. John Stewart was a man who
came through at just the crucial
time more than once to stop the
Bucks.
All in all, it was a thoroughly sat
isfying game. The surprise win over
Ohio State—rated a 7-to-10-point
favorite—served several purposes.
First of all, it re-established the
Cards' confidence in themselves as a
team. This was something badly

needed after the rude pasting they
took at the hands of lowly Oregon
State.
Then, it pushed Stanford right
back into the familiar role of PCC
darkhorse. This will give UCLA
something to think about.
But right now Taylor is just think
ing about Michigan State. Chuck
hasn't made a prediction yet, but
"we'd like to win them all."
