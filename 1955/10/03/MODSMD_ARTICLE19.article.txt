Rousing cheers and snappy
card stunts by thousands o(

healthy dose of Stanford spirit
Saturday during the "Game ot
the Week" with Ohio State.
Cheerleader Jim Walters mack.' ;i
; winning debut, and the large new
Stanford band sparkled over tli<
video networks during halftime.
Walters termed the rooting sec

that the card stunts "were the best
that I've never seen."
"The spirit was fantastic—the root -
ing section didn't need cheerleaders
really."
BIG RALLY
Friday night's rally at the Sunken
Diamond was one of the largest
turnouts at an early season event in
i quite a while.
"We didn't expect as great a turn
out as there was," Walters enthu.9ed.

Much credit should be given to the
freshman sponsors who arranged
rally exchanges, he said.
Walters and his assistants—Geoir.e
Connick, Don "Skip" Skipworth, Jud
McNamara and Johnny Hamlyn
made an unobtrusive entrance be
fore the start of the game Saturday
(unlike predecessor Ed Mahoney,
who used to come before the stand
in spectacular fashion).
WEST POINT TYPE
But the cheerleaders moved f;i-L
and the rooters responded well ;<
the band marched onto the field in
their spanking new West Point-style
uniforms.
