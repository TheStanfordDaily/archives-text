# a 						good day.

Stanford had to swallow a lot of pride and
give up a good hunk of cash at the gate to go
coast to coast on television Saturday. The
gamble was for prestige. A ceriain amount of
prestige .goes with just being on the hook-up.
There's more if you can contain in front of a
national audience the team which won the
liose Bowl.
Chuck Taylor's sguad did contain Ohio State
completely. The Indians made all the key
plays, and the visitors didn't put anything on
the scoreboard but a fat zero. John Stewart,
Tony Mosich, Paul Camera, Bill Tarr, Jerry
Guntafson—they all made the big effort in the
clutch. The whole team made a big effoit. For
a big victory.

The band with the new look did its part, too.
George Sheldon pranced in front of a precision
outfit—an outfit with good music and good !
routines. In addition, the card stunts glittered,
and the expanding Block S impressed.
Thus the decision to televise was rewarding.
Stanford had to humble herself by starting an
hour early to keep in step with NBC's color
programming from New York (Oklahoma-Pitt
would have been the alternate if game-time
hadn't been moved ahead). Few paid to come
and see because the game couldn't be blacked
out.
But it was a good day. It's always a good
day when you win. And when you bounce
back from a rough one to win. And when it
looks like you might win some more.
