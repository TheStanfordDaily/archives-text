a distaff, the Distaff Club is balling the jack
Wednesday noon in the Women's Clubhouse.
Come early, stay late, bring your own lunch ...
FOR THOSE OF US who are admirers of our
little feathered songsters, the Department of
Speech and Drama is planning an interesting
Wednesday afternoon matinee to feature a film
made under unusual circumstances in a foreign
land, and about a little-known natural phenom
enon. It's called "The Eagle with Two Heads,"
and it goes on Ihe screen at 4:15 in Little The
ater. This should be a good chance for all you
fans to log some really unusual specimens.
Seats will be available, but officials warn pa
trons to bring their own perches. We're com
ing with a shotgun —after all, Thanksgiving is
just around the corner . . .

WEDNESDAY NIGHT is Farm Follies night.
At 7:30 in Frost Amphitheater/ faculty and stu
dents will throw a monster talent fest as part
of the Back to the Farm Week celebration. It's
a lot of fun, you laugh yourself silly, and the
weekend's only two nights away, so why not
. . . ? One large warning: have a blanket
along when you hit the pit—it isn't called

Frost for nothing. I

THIS FRIDAY will be quite a day, a day to
recall nostalgic memories of its previous ob
servance, a day which will burn itself in letters
of fire on the innocent freshman heart. Friday j
is Olympic Day, its arrival heralded by the !
rumble of heavily loaded trucks heading out
Alpine Road. In certain respects it's one of the
damnedest things tyou ever saw. A Quad tra
dition of long, and honored standing, Olympic
Day is highlighted by the running of the annual
Marathon, from which inspiring event the day
takes its name. It has to be seen to be believed,
so sea you there . . .

THIS WEEK should prove to be a little gold
mine for connoisseurs of the sleeper. We have
three—count 'em, three—so step right up and
with one swift glance select the best. Tuesday
at 4:15 they'll be queueing up for Professor
Scheffe's "Alternate Models for Analysis of
Variance," while Thursday at 4 Professor Gar
tenhaus will regale the bulging-skulled with
"Nuclear Forces from the Cut-off Yakawa The
ory." But our choice, though, getting our
Beauty Rest Award of the Week, features Dr.
Gerhard Fankhauser, from Tigertown, N.J.,
speaking on "The Production of Salamanders
with Abnormal Chromosome Numbers and
Their Significance for Experimental Biology."
Tea will be served before the lecture. How
lucky can you get? . . .

FLICK SUNDAY is "Hondo," starring durable
ol' John Wayne in a movie which the Cellar
intelligentsia say isn't bad at all. If you didn't
see it the three or four times it was around
last year, now is the hour . . . There's also a
peachy-sounding short subject entitled "Mis
sissippi Traveler."
