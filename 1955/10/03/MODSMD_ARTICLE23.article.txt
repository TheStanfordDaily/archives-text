crude and vulgar
To the Editor:
We as freshmen wish to express our feelings con
cerning the Ohio State rally which we attended Fri
day night. We were completely disgusted by the
crude and vulgar jokes which were offered as enter
tainment. We feel that these jokes were absolutely
unnecessary and contributed nothing toward the
purpose of the rally. We were disappointed to think
that a University such as this should have only vul
;.;a' ity to offer as humor. It seems to us that with a
little more thought and planning an excellent rally
could be held, and it would not be necessary to resort
to obscenity to keep the crowd interested.

The closing of Santa Teresa Street to through
traffic involves the safety of over 650 girls living in
Lagunita and Roble, plus all the lower division girls
who must attend classes in the Women's Gym. In
the past thesr. girls have had to combat 40-mile-an
hour traffic at the rate of 1,800 cars a day. 1,400 of
which were merely transient between the Menlo
Park and Palo Alto areas.
We I eel that this situation alone is far more im
portant than the minor personal inconvenience of a

relatively few Menlo Park residents. But there are j
more far-reaching benefits to be derived from the i
closing of Santa Teresa. It is not only intended to |
eliminate the roar of traffic in the academic area of
the University, but also to allow permanent improve
ment of the roads on the campus. We all complain
about the condition of the roads, and this condition
is caused by those extra 1,400 cars a day.
This step has been taken for the benefit of the
students by officials who are aware of the Univer
sity's needs and are looking ahead to our welfare.
Let's leave the administration of the University to
those who are responsible and enjoy the benefits of
their competence.

hundred cars did use Santa Teresa as a through
road, luit it was not exclusively Menlo Park to
Palo Alto traffic. Many students and University

We as freshmen wish to express our feelings con
cerning the Ohio State rally which we attended Fri
day night. We were completely disgusted by the
crude and vulgar jokes which were offered as enter
tainment. We feel that these jokes were absolutely
unnecessary and contributed nothing toward the
purpose of the rally. We were disappointed to think
that a University such as this should have only vul
;.;a' ity to offer as humor. It seems to us that with a
little more thought and planning an excellent rally
could be held, and it would not be necessary to resort
to obscenity to keep the crowd interested.

The closing of Santa Teresa Street to through
traffic involves the safety of over 650 girls living in
Lagunita and Roble, plus all the lower division girls
who must attend classes in the Women's Gym. In
the past thesr. girls have had to combat 40-mile-an
hour traffic at the rate of 1,800 cars a day. 1,400 of
which were merely transient between the Menlo
Park and Palo Alto areas.
We I eel that this situation alone is far more im
portant than the minor personal inconvenience of a

relatively few Menlo Park residents. But there are j
more far-reaching benefits to be derived from the i
closing of Santa Teresa. It is not only intended to |
eliminate the roar of traffic in the academic area of
the University, but also to allow permanent improve
ment of the roads on the campus. We all complain
about the condition of the roads, and this condition
is caused by those extra 1,400 cars a day.
This step has been taken for the benefit of the
students by officials who are aware of the Univer
sity's needs and are looking ahead to our welfare.
Let's leave the administration of the University to
those who are responsible and enjoy the benefits of
their competence.

hundred cars did use Santa Teresa as a through
road, luit it was not exclusively Menlo Park to
Palo Alto traffic. Many students and University
personnel were included.)

Whatever happened to the even more traditional
chorus of the "Drinking Song," viz.:
Mine eyes are dim,
I cannot see.
