# 'Left Hand of God' Sidesteps Problem
## 
### JACK BYRNE 
"The Left Hand of God," now commanding $1.25 and up prices
at a local cinema palace, proves to be one of those pictures that
sidestep an issue which may be potentially uncomfortable.
The plot, for the benefit of those who came in late, concerns an
American-type flier (H. Bogart) who is forced down in China,

vintage 1947. A kindly and sadistic
old warlord drags him from the
wreckage, nurses him to health, and
puts him to work as second in com
mand.
In the spirit of camaraderie, the
warlord shoots craps with him every
Friday night for his paycheck. Bo
gie, it seems, is a consistent loser.
But to equalize things, old evil eye
has provided Humph with a fetching
young concubine, who strolls the

parapets of the
fort attired in yel
low silk pajamas.
Such is the notion
of Hollywood.
But one day,
when our ground
bound aviator

finds himself short of cash as a re
sult of losing a craps game for the
'nth consecutive time, and has seen
one of his tin soldiers wipe out a
passing Catholic priest, he says to
hell with it all, and strikes out over
the hills dressed as the priest.
In the middle of what is intended
to represent the biggest storm of the
season, the freshly - frocked one
strolls into a mission in the nick of
time to administer last rites to an
aged Chinese.
The next three reels are obvious.
He works a few apparent miracles,
the church is full of the devout, and
all is well. But down from the hills
comes the evil old warlord. He
wants the priest (nee flier) to come
home and run his army some more.
But our devout one has acquired

an interest for the safety of his vil
lage and parishioners, particularly
one young nurse. So he shoots a
craps game with the warlord for the
safety of the village against five
years of service. Naturally, he wins.
For a rousing encore, he rolls again
for the safety of a Protestant mis
sion on the other side of the moun
tains . . . winning again with a pid
dling pair of treys.
All of this is good situation, and
a story full of potential. But some
where alon;* the line, in the writing,
the screen play, or in the acting, the
story just doesn't develop.
Hollywood has always tended to
tread softly where a religious ques
tion is involved—which is lament
able. If a picture such as "The Left
Hand of God" is to be made at all,
it seems that the story should be
fully treated. Such situations as a
woman falling in love with what she
believes to be a Catholic priest may
be disconcerting to some, but, none
theless, worthy of exploitation.
This is the picture's big failing:
It never carries off a good potential.
And lacking in this respect, it lacks
reason to be seen.

tread softly where a religious ques
tion is involved—which is lament
able. If a picture such as "The Left
Hand of God" is to be made at all,
it seems that the story should be
fully treated. Such situations as a
woman falling in love with what she
believes to be a Catholic priest may
be disconcerting to some, but, none
theless, worthy of exploitation.
This is the picture's big failing:
It never carries off a good potential.
And lacking in this respect, it lacks
reason to be seen.

"The Left Hand of God," now commanding $1.25 and up prices
at a local cinema palace, proves to be one of those pictures that
sidestep an issue which may be potentially uncomfortable.
The plot, for the benefit of those who came in late, concerns an
American-type flier (H. Bogart) who is forced down in China,

vintage 1947. A kindly and sadistic
old warlord drags him from the
wreckage, nurses him to health, and
puts him to work as second in com
mand.
In the spirit of camaraderie, the
warlord shoots craps with him every
Friday night for his paycheck. Bo
gie, it seems, is a consistent loser.
But to equalize things, old evil eye
has provided Humph with a fetching
young concubine, who strolls the

parapets of the
fort attired in yel
low silk pajamas.
Such is the notion
of Hollywood.
But one day,
when our ground
bound aviator

finds himself short of cash as a re
sult of losing a craps game for the
'nth consecutive time, and has seen
one of his tin soldiers wipe out a
passing Catholic priest, he says to
hell with it all, and strikes out over
the hills dressed as the priest.
In the middle of what is intended
to represent the biggest storm of the
season, the freshly - frocked one
strolls into a mission in the nick of
time to administer last rites to an
aged Chinese.
The next three reels are obvious.
He works a few apparent miracles,
the church is full of the devout, and
all is well. But down from the hills
comes the evil old warlord. He
wants the priest (nee flier) to come
home and run his army some more.
But our devout one has acquired

an interest for the safety of his vil
lage and parishioners, particularly
one young nurse. So he shoots a
craps game with the warlord for the
safety of the village against five
years of service. Naturally, he wins.
For a rousing encore, he rolls again
for the safety of a Protestant mis
sion on the other side of the moun
tains . . . winning again with a pid
dling pair of treys.
All of this is good situation, and
a story full of potential. But some
where alon;* the line, in the writing,
the screen play, or in the acting, the
story just doesn't develop.
