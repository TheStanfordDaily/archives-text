# Woody Hayes Bitter After Buckeye Loss

### BOB MIEROW 
"They had their march and scored.
We had ours and didn't." That's the
way W. W. (Woody) Hayes put it
after his Ohio State Buckeyes
dropped a hard-fought 6-0 battle to
Stanford Saturday.
Hayes was quite bitter after the
nationally-televised upset, keeping
the sportswriters waiting for over a
half-hour before being interviewed.
"Stewart's tackle broke our back.
I thought we were going to score
on that drive." The Buckeye pilot
was speaking of John Stewart's driv
ing tackle of Lee Williams, seven
yards behind scrimmage in the
fourth period.
Asked if Howard (Hopalong) Cas
sady had had an off-day, Hayes re
marked, "Cassady was well de
fensed." The All - American half
back from Columbus was held to
only 37 yards.
Cassady himself stated after the
defeat, "We got the ball down there,
but we couldn't take it in."
Hayes was asked to comment on
Bill Tarr, the Tribe's great fullback.
"He's very good." Comparing Tarr
to Alan Ameche, the former Wiscon
sin line-crusher, Hayes stated, "He's
a different type than Ameche."
The Buckeye mentor declared he
was expecting a higher scoring game.
"Usually when we get inside the 40,
we score." Hayes felt that Stanford
had been well coached, but that
Ohio State may have been a little
better physically.
Hayes was very disheartened that
the Buckeyes had failed to intercept
a single Stanford aerial. "We were
hoping to pick off one or two of their
passes. Oregon State got five; we
should have gotten one."
