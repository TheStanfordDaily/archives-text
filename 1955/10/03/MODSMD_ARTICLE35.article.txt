# Dodgers Send Newk Against Yanks Today
## 
### 
Don Newcombe, the huge right
hander who suddenly came to life
early this season after being ordered
to pitch batting practice, has been
nominated by Brooklyn Dodger pilot
Walter Alston to whip the New
York Yankees today and win the
World Series.
Casey Stengel, clever old manager
of the Bronx Bombers, has called
upon southpaw Ed (Whitey) Ford
to try to stop the onrushing Bums.
Brooklyn's sluggegrs, paced by
dashing Duke Snider, pounded their
way to a 5-3 victory yesterday, thus
sweeping the three games played at
Ebbets Field.
Snider poled two home runs, tying
a World Series record of four hom
ers in one series previously held by
himself, Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.
Only Gehrig and the old Yankee
Clipper. Joe DiMaggio, have ever hit
more homers in series than the Duke.
Snider's nine four-ply blows, best
ever by any National League par
ticipant, compare with DiMag's 15
and the Iron Horse's ten.
Roger Craig, who had never even
seen a World Series game until last
week, and relief specialist Clem
Labine combined to limit the Yan
kees to six base knocks.
Sandy Amoros started the scoring
in the second inning with a two-

run blast over the right-field score
board, sending Gil Hodges in ahead
of him. Hodges had gotten on by
smashing a single to left.
Brooklyn added another in the
third when Snider walloped his first
homer of the day off of New York
starter Bob Grim.
The Yankees fought back in the
fourth when Yogi Berra singled, Ed
Robinson walked, and Bill Martin
singled Yogi home. •
Snider lengthened the Bums' ad
vantage to 4-1 with his second blast
off Grim in the fifth.
The gap was closed and Flatbush
starter Craig was chased in the sev
enth when Bob Cerv cracked out a
pinch-hit home run.
Labine's only trouble came in the
eighth when Berra, the squat little
backstop, rapped out a solo homer
to make the score: Brooklyn 4, New
York 3.
Singles by Carl Furillo and Jackie
Robinson, sandwiching Gil Hodges'
sacrifice, gave the Dodgers an in
surance tally in the bottom of the
eighth.

Labine combined to limit the Yan
kees to six base knocks.
Sandy Amoros started the scoring
in the second inning with a two-

run blast over the right-field score
board, sending Gil Hodges in ahead
of him. Hodges had gotten on by
smashing a single to left.
Brooklyn added another in the
third when Snider walloped his first
homer of the day off of New York
starter Bob Grim.
The Yankees fought back in the
fourth when Yogi Berra singled, Ed
Robinson walked, and Bill Martin
singled Yogi home. •
Snider lengthened the Bums' ad
vantage to 4-1 with his second blast
off Grim in the fifth.
The gap was closed and Flatbush
starter Craig was chased in the sev
enth when Bob Cerv cracked out a
pinch-hit home run.
Labine's only trouble came in the
eighth when Berra, the squat little
backstop, rapped out a solo homer
to make the score: Brooklyn 4, New
York 3.
Singles by Carl Furillo and Jackie
Robinson, sandwiching Gil Hodges'
sacrifice, gave the Dodgers an in
surance tally in the bottom of the
eighth.


DON NEWCOMBE
Don Newcombe, the huge right
hander who suddenly came to life
early this season after being ordered
to pitch batting practice, has been
nominated by Brooklyn Dodger pilot
Walter Alston to whip the New
York Yankees today and win the
World Series.
Casey Stengel, clever old manager
of the Bronx Bombers, has called
upon southpaw Ed (Whitey) Ford
to try to stop the onrushing Bums.
Brooklyn's sluggegrs, paced by
dashing Duke Snider, pounded their
way to a 5-3 victory yesterday, thus
sweeping the three games played at
Ebbets Field.
Snider poled two home runs, tying
a World Series record of four hom
ers in one series previously held by
himself, Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.
Only Gehrig and the old Yankee
Clipper. Joe DiMaggio, have ever hit
more homers in series than the Duke.
Snider's nine four-ply blows, best
ever by any National League par
ticipant, compare with DiMag's 15
and the Iron Horse's ten.
Roger Craig, who had never even
seen a World Series game until last
week, and relief specialist Clem
Labine combined to limit the Yan
kees to six base knocks.
