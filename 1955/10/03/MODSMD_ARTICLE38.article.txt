# Cleveland Wallops 49er Eleven, 38-3
## 
### 
The world' champion Cleveland
Browns rebounded from a* league
opening loss to the Washington Red
skins to mangle the San Franisco
49ers, 38-3, yesterday before 46,150
disappointed fans. It was the second
loss in a row for the impotent 49ers,
who suffered at the hands of the Los
Angeles Rams last week.
Otto Graham, fabled Cleveland
quarterback, came back to his pre
retirement form to lead the Browns
to their crushing win. San Francisco
never threatened seriously, and their
only points came on a second-quar
ter field goal by Gordie Soltau.
