# Frosh Take Achievement Tests Today
## First of 3 Exams Begins at 8:45 A.M. 
### 
How would Stanford rate in an
intercollegiate battle of wits?
Tests involving a broad scope
of subject matter will be given
today to all freshmen in order to
answer this and several other
questions regarding undergrad
uate planning.
Freshmen will be excused from all
their classes today in order to take
the series of three tests.
All freshmen will be given the
one-hour English test in the morn
ing, beginning at 8:45. In the after
j noon students will take two tests
! chosen from the subjects they took
as high school seniors.
Freshmen are to report to the fol
lowing places: those with last names
falling alphabetically between Ab
bott and Harker, to the Pavilion;
Harmon through Pearson, to the
Wilbur Hall dining rooms; Pedder
through C. Smith, in the Stern Hall
dining rooms; D. Smith through Vi
ola, to the Branner dining hall; and
Visel through Zwicker, to Encina
dining hall No. 8.
In addition to the use of the tests
in intercollegiate competition, Stan
ford will study them to decide
whether they are of value for future
use.
If considered valuable, they may
be added to the entrance tests now
in use and substituted for the locally
administered freshman tests in Eng
lish, foreign langauges, and mathe
matics.
The intellectual achievement test
is a part of the Study of Undergrad
uate Education, a long-range plan
ning department of the University
established last year.
Robert G. Hoopes, associate pro
fessor of English, is the new director
of SUE, appointed last summer.
SUE studies began last year to esti
mate the effectiveness of teaching,
intellectual climate, and course of
ferings.
A student committee was formed
to supplement the faculty work on
I this project.
