# North African Problem Is Discussed By Professor, ASSU Foreign Scholar
## Moroccan Claims Economic Chaos 
### GERRY SMITH 
"This tragic and dramatic Mo
ipccan civil war, like that of In
dochina, is leading to economic
chaos," Alain Coriat, ASSU for
eign scholar from Tangier, said
yesterday.
"Morocco can be a tremendous 1
country of the future," he contin
ued. "Conditions have improved very
much in the past few years. In a
country where there used to be
anarchy, now there are new roads,
hydraulic dams, schools, and hospi
tals.
"But the economic situation now
i( very bad. Progress is being held
nick by terrorism and bombs, use
less fighting that leads to nothing
positive," he commented. "Only a
fpw people are taking profit from the
situation. The terrorists act against
the real wishes of the population.
'Ihe man of the street there, as else
where, wants peace.
"The students of Morocco are lib
eral, with great capacity in all
fields," Coriat went on. "There is a
class of learned students forming
now—they will be the Morocco of
the future. Although they want the |
independence of their country, they j
would go about it slowly. But now j
they are few and can do little."
KAISEI) IN MOROCCO
Coriat was born in Tangier, lived
in Rabat and Casablanca, and then j
moved back to Tangier when he was

11. He attended high school in Mo
rocco, then went to Paris for four
years at the Ecole des Hec. At Stan
ford he is taking courses in the
Graduate School of Business and ;
the political science department.
'"I feel there is much to learn from j
other people," Coriat said. "In Eu- j
rope we don't know America well, j
I don't travel as a tourist; I want to
experience the American way of j
life."
Many things about Stanford life
have impressed Coriat, such as the !
buildings, landscape, and the friend
liness of "smiling California." He ;
feels the work done by the ASSU
foreign scholars committee has been '
wonderful.
STANFORD PROFS
The aspect of Stanford life which
impresses Coriat most is the near
ness of the students to the profes
sors. "Why, the professor looks at
the students as if they were his
kids!" he exclaimed.
In conclusion, Coriat had several
remarks to make about Tangier. He ;
characterized his country as "an in- {
ternational settlement where a mini
ature UN discusses local problems j
and everyone lives together nicely.
There are no military forces or taxes
and everyone is happy. It has the
Spanish aspect of leisure—life comes
very easily."
"Tangier is, indeed, 'a white dove
poised on the shoulder of Africa'."
