# Architect Appointed For Union
## Construction To Begin in Late '56 
### 
Appointment of an architect
for the Tresidder Memorial Un
ion at Stanford University yes
terday marked another forward
step in plans for a student ac
tivity center on the campus.
Eldridge T. Spencer. San Francis
co, will be the architect for the
building, which will honor t.he late
Donald B. Tie i der, fourth Stan
ford president, it was announced by
President Wallace Sterling.
The Tresidder Memorial Fund now
sxceeds $900,000, and, while total
cost of the ultimately developed
Union will be considerably more
than that amount, University offi
cials anticipate that construction can
go ahead on a first unit—possibly
during the latter part of 1956.
STANFORD COMMITTEE
A University-wide committee to
settle on what the Union should in
clude is working with Spencer. Dean
of students H. Donald Winbigler is
chairman and George Ralph, 1955-56
student body president, is a new
member.
Among facilities the Union is ex
pected to provide are student body
offices, recreation areas, a fountain,
and a ballroom which could be con
verted for receptions and banquets.
The Tresidder Memorial Fund was
started in 1948 shortly after the
death of Dr. Tresidder. It has been
built up largely through gifts of
alumni and University trustees, al
locations of profits from the existing
Union, and by $1 per quarter con
tributed by each Stanford student
as part of his student fee.
MUSIC BUILDING
Working plans are now being
drawn for another unit of the stu
dent activity center — a $400,000
music building to house the Flor
ence H. Dinkelspiel memorial audi
torium. Construction should begin
early next year.
The music building and the Tre
sidder Memorial Union are to be
located across a landscaped plaza
adjoining the present Stanford Union
buildings. Some of the existing
buildings, which are 30 to 40 years
old, are to be remodeled eventually
for a faculty clubhouse and other
uses.
