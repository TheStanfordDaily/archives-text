# Stanford 'Hell Week Opens; Initiation Begins with a Whack
## 
### DAN COHEN 
If the fellow you're sitting
next to in class next week hap
pens to be wearing last year's
sweat suit complete with this
year's grime, or a tweed jacket.
Levis, T-shirt, and necktie, the
chances are he's not more than
a little bit crazy, he's just going
through "Hell Week."
You probably won't want to sit
next to him for very lone though,
because he usually isn't allowed to
change his clothes or wash through
i out the ordeal.
"Hell Week" is an old fraternity
custom exercised on the pledges dur
ing the week before their formal
initiation into the fraternities, and
climaxing a lengthy period of house
work ancf study of the history and
j practices of their particular house.
Using the deferred rushing sys
' tem, Stanford pledges who accepted

fraternity bids last winter quarter
are now permitted, under the Uni
versity's regulations, to become ac
tive members of the house.
Unfortunately for the victims,
what you see of "Hell Week" targets
wandering sleepily around the Quad
in disheveled clothes doesn't begin
to indicate what the pledges have
in store for them once they get back
to the fraternity house.
The actual mechanics of "Hell
Week" are veiled in secrecy. Actives
are more than a little reluctant to
describe the exact nature of the
"Fun Games" their pledges partici
pate in, and the pledges themselves
are never told beforehand what will
be expected of them. Even the date
of "Hell Week" remains a mystery
to the pledges until they find them
selves hauled out of a warm bed
late one evening to begin the ac
tivities.
"Hell Week" practices vary from
fraternity to fraternity and campus
to campus. Some houses have modi
fied the festivities to a "Help Week,"

where pledges are required to do
extensive housework and extra re
quirments in the way of pledge du
ties. Other fraternities include pad
dles as basic working materials,
while still others vary the general
theme to suit their own tastes. Stan
ford regulations have modified some
of the exuberant activities, but, on
the whole, "Hell Week" has lost lit
tle of its flavor.
Yet, in spite of the outwardly for
bidding nature of "Hell Week." the
sleepless nights, dirty clothes, count
less push-ups, and mysterious aura,
fraternity men look upon the adven
ture as one of the funniest and most
exciting of their college careers.
The spirit of "Hell Week" is never
a malicious one. The anxiety that
pervades each pledge as he tries to
figure out when his "Hell Week"
begins often turns to shouts of
laughter as he finds himself faced
with one after another ingenious
indignity. Though "Hell Week" is
certainly hell, fraternity men will
agree that it is a lot of fun, too.

Unfortunately for the victims,
what you see of "Hell Week" targets
wandering sleepily around the Quad
in disheveled clothes doesn't begin

in store for them once they get back
to the fraternity house.
The actual mechanics of "Hell
Week" are veiled in secrecy. Actives
are more than a little reluctant to
describe the exact nature of the
"Fun Games" their pledges partici
pate in, and the pledges themselves
are never told beforehand what will
be expected of them. Even the date
of "Hell Week" remains a mystery
to the pledges until they find them
selves hauled out of a warm bed
late one evening to begin the ac
tivities.
"Hell Week" practices vary from
fraternity to fraternity and campus
to campus. Some houses have modi
fied the festivities to a "Help Week,"

where pledges are required to do
extensive housework and extra re
quirments in the way of pledge du
ties. Other fraternities include pad
dles as basic working materials,
while still others vary the general
theme to suit their own tastes. Stan
ford regulations have modified some
of the exuberant activities, but, on
the whole, "Hell Week" has lost lit
tle of its flavor.
Yet, in spite of the outwardly for
bidding nature of "Hell Week." the
sleepless nights, dirty clothes, count
less push-ups, and mysterious aura,
fraternity men look upon the adven
ture as one of the funniest and most
exciting of their college careers.
The spirit of "Hell Week" is never
a malicious one. The anxiety that
pervades each pledge as he tries to
figure out when his "Hell Week"
begins often turns to shouts of
laughter as he finds himself faced
with one after another ingenious
indignity. Though "Hell Week" is
certainly hell, fraternity men will
agree that it is a lot of fun, too.

"Hell Week" is an old fraternity
