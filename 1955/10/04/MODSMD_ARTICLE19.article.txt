A sign on the door at Wilbur Hall
proolaims "Please Do Not Let the
Cat Out."
Professpr W. H. Stone of the Eng
lish Department apologizes for end
ing the sentence with a preposition,
but he's having a much harder time
these days keeping his menagerie
under control titan he is with jug
gling grammar.
Though his errant pussy was lo
cated on Alvarado Row yesterday
by Mrs. Barbara Jessup, who recog
nized the description in Thursday's
Daily, Professor Stone reports that
his gray female angora forgot to sign
out again last night, climbing through
an open window with the other
Stone pussy. ,
It seenls that the only feline that's
safe around here is the SAE lion
(and that got tarred and feathered
a few weeks ago).
