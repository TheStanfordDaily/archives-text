childish complaint
To ihe Editor:
In answer to the childish complaint printed in the
Oct. !5 issue of The Stanford Daily written fcy a
group of fame-seeking freshmen, pertaining to the
rally of last Friday: we. also as freshmen, feel that
their opinion is not typical of an adult college mind.
We feel that any member of the Stanford Family
should either accept something as it is or ignore it
if it is not particularly sell-pleasing; for those looking
for filth can find it anywhere.
We were sorry to think that some of the members
of oiir class have not been able to adjust themselves
from the prudishness of high school and cannot enjoy
a well-planned function. We would like to congratu
late Jim Walters and his assistants on a job well done.
Keep it no!

ear muffs wanted
To the Editor:
We, as BMOC's, also wish to bx press our feelings
concerning the Ohio State rally, which we attended
Friday night. We, too, were absolutely sickened by
the crude display of vile vulgarity. We heartily agree
with the Four Freshmen that it would be just super
peachy to have a rally that has more to offer than
vulgarity as humor.
Our mommies always taught us to cover our ears
when someone told nasty jokesâ€”if nothing is done
about this situation, we shall lobby for an ear-muff
sale before the next rally.
So there! (Names withheld by request)
