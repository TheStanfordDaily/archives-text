Parking meters on campus. This is enough
to send shudders down the back of most Stan
ford students. But such a situation appears guite
possible at UCLA.
According to the Daily Bruin public sympo
siums are now being held "on the fee-parking
proposal, currently being considered as a rem
edy to the university's parking difficulties."
A committee composed of student members,
faculty, and the administration has made three
alternative proposals: (1) insertion of an al
ready-paid-for coded plastic card in a meter
which would permit entrance and exit from
a parking lot; (2) curbside parking meters,
which would allow students to park for 10
cents an hour; or (3) the parking pass system
now in use on campus.
Colorado A&M reports its solution to the
traffic problem.
Freshmen and sophomores will not be per
mitted to park on campus, while juniors and
seniors v/ill be allowed to park in designated
areas only, according to the Rocky Mountain
Collegian.
Parking permits are issued upon personal
application. Also automobile registration v/ill
be reported on the old familiar IBM card.

The big news from USC concerns the Kappa
Sig house which has been closed for the se
mester and had nine members suspended from
the university as a result of their "serious mis
conduct" last semester, according to the Daily
Trojan.
It appears the "serious misconduct" con
cerned entertainment offered by one Miss Patty
Waggin, known in the trade as an interpretive
dancer. The boys invited Miss Waggin to do
her revealing act at their house.
Miss Waggin kindly obliged. Following her
demonstration she was invited to a little soiree
upstairs and accepted. As a result Miss Wag

gin saw fit to call in the authorities.
According to the Trojan, the suspending
committee "mentioned the fraternity's poor
past record at the university, which referred to
its being involved in seven incidents begin
ning with the 1953 panty raids."
Going from fraternity men to plain ordinary
frosh, it appears that Wilbur Hall isn't the only
new frosh men's dorm on the coast. The Ore
gon Daily Emerald announced the opening of a
new 51,25G,000 dorm at the University of Ore
gon.
Named Earl Hall, it is greatly similar to Wil
bur, being divided into five units, each of
which contains 30 double rooms, a lounge, din
ing room, and recreation room in the basement.
At the University of Washington the presi
dent of the sophomore class is boiling mad.
Reports had been circulating that sale of green
beanies to the frosh had fallen cff almost com
pletely.
"We have sold $131 .80 worth of beanies this
week," president Gerry Alexander declared in
dignantly. "Last year's receipts totaled only
$107.91. This year's results compare well with
any since the war." Anybody wishing to
soothe the seething sophomore and get him
self a green beanie at the same time may send
poor Gerry 15 cents.

A rip-roaring debate v/as seen at the Cal
campus last week.
According to the Cal Daily, "A young So
cialist and a young evangelist competed for
attention from students passing through Sather
Gate at noon.
"The president of the Young Socialist League
and three Baptist evangelists stood within 15
feet of each other and independently ex
pounded their respective theories for the im- J
provement of life, this and the next."
