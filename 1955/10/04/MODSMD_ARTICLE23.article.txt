# IN BERLIN, GROPINGS
## 'I Am A Camera' Lacks Plot, Point 
### STEW TOY 
Struggling writers have a yen
to write about struggling writ
ers, and in "I Am a Camera,"
novelist Christopher Isherwood
yields to the temptation with the
worst of them.
First a story, then a stage play,
and now a movie running at San
Francisco's Bridge Theater, the epic
work concerns itself with Isher
wood's early gropings and hair
tearing while writing his first novel
in 1931 Berlin.
His mission, of course, is to show
the world that a novelist's life is not
all literary teas.
In the course of his well-taken
message, he also makes some other
interesting and profound observa
tions such*as his happy discovery,

in the midst of his
frustration, that a
writer's mind is
much the same as
a piece of photo
graphic equip
ment: "Why," he
say s to himself,
emerging from a
brown study, "I

am a camera!" (title). The movie's
action begins at a literary tea. Isher
wocd, now a successful writer, is
amazed to discover that the novelist
being honored is an old girl friend
(Julie Harris).
There's an interesting story con
nected with her, and he proceeds lo
tall it to some friends, while, during
(he next two hours' flashback, the
party in question waits patiently in
the next room.
In tho flashback Miss Harris, a
E:rlin night-club singer, loses her
money, her fiance, her job and her
apartment, all in one night's mad
gamboling. Where can she turn but
to Isherwood, an innocent but sym
pathetic night-club patron, who
takes her home with him —on a
strictly platonic basis.
She remains with him for the bet
ter part of a year, during which
time she latches on to an American
millionaire, who supports them both
in a lavish six months' spree. Isher
wood neglects his work shamefully.
The millionaire finally deserts
them, leaving the trappings for a
proposed Honolulu trip and a sup
posedly pregnant Miss Harris (she
later finds her mathematics to be
faulty).
And there an end. Isherwood sells
an article. Miss Harris gats a job in
Paris, and they go their several
ways.
The story's main trouble is its lack
of plot. The movie is nothing but
a series of contrived, amusing inci
dents—some of them truly funny,
like the scene in which the million
aire turns a hotel suite into a hospi
tal and hires a dozen medical crack
pots to cure Isherwood's disguised
hangover.

But there's no temblance of order,
nothing resembling a "point." Isher
wood should know better.
Julie Harris' acting is, of course,
beyond reproach. She carries off
ihe vivacious-blonde-wi th-a-heart
of-gold role in impeccable style,
When Isherwood ends his narra
tion and meets the new author, the
movie ends with an amusing coinci
dence: Miss Harris, it seems, is alone
without money or room. They leave
together for Isherwood's apartment.
