### 
STANFORD 6, OHIO STATE 0
Both Stanford and the Pacific Coast Conference gained tremendous
prestige because of this result. After Washington's 30-0 smash over Min
nesota, and Cal's tough light against Illinois, the Indians' shutout of Ohio
State makes the "PCC look like a real threat to the Big Ten Conference for
the first time since the prewar years.
Ohio State came into the game with an 11-game winning streak, in
cluding the Hose Bowl game on last New Year's Day. The Buckeyes were
last year's Associated Press mythical national champions and started this
year with a good nucleus of men from that team —halfbacks "Hopalong"
Cassady and Jerry Harkrader, tackle Francis Maehinsky, guard Jim Par
ker, and center Ken Vargo. *
Stanford, which last Saturday was upset by Oregon State, was not
awed by reputation, however, and put on a solid defensive show to contain
the Bucks. The vaunted Ohio State running attack, which last year and
against Nebraska this year averaged around 300 yards per game, was
slowed down to 187 yards by the Stanford defense. The Buckeyes made
yardage through the line but could not shake Cassady or Harkrader loose
on their normally explosive end runs.
Stanford fullback Bill Tarr gained himself All-American recognition
by picking up 102 yards on 20 carries and playing solid defense. The whole
Card team, in fact, played like tigers on defense, with center Joe Long and
tackle Paul Wigyin being particularly outstanding.
II Stanford can move into East Lansing. Michigan, next Saturday and
take Michigan State in its own camp, West Coast football fans can once
again look forward to the Rose Bowl.
UCLA 55, WASHINGTON STATE 0
The Bruins, beaten by Maryland last week, proved in this one that,
despite their loss last week, they are still nobody's pushover. The defeat
was the worst for Washington State in 33 years.
What is doubly impressive about UCLA's victory is the fact that the
Cougars are traditionally tough in their home stadium at Pullman and
that the Cougars were rated as a pre-season conference dark horse
although they have now lost their first three games.
WSC showed absolutely no punch while the Bruins scored practically
at will even though first-string tailback Ronny Knox sat out the entire
game. Second- through fifth-string tailbacks Sam Brown, Doug Bradley,
Chuck Holloway, and Gerry "IcDougall and fullback Bob Davenport all
played a big part in the Bruin offense, which rolled for 407 yards.
WASHINGTON 19, OREGON 7
The Huskies showed that their 30-0 win over Minnesota was no fluke
as they wore down an Oregon team which had beaten Utah and given USC
three quarters of trouble. The big Washington line gave up 153 yards
1o Oregon's speedy running backs but confined most of that yardage to
Oregon territory. The Ducks did, however, show a passing attack for the
first lime this season as they got 115 yards through the air.
The Huskies scored on three grinding marches with halfbacks Credell
Green and Jim Jones and fullback Mike Monroe moving behind their big
forward wall.
Washington, with two competent quarterbacks in Steve Roake and
Sandy Lederman to go with their line and running game, should make it
rough for the rest of the conference.
SOUTHERN CAL 19. TEXAS 7
The Trojans took their first intersectional game in stride after whip
ping Washington State and Oregon in their first two games. USC knocked
out Texas quarterback Joe Clements in the first quarter to just about kill
the Longhorns' whole offense. Clements was the nation's leading passer
going into the game.
The Trojans again showed power on the ground with tailback Jon Ar
nett and fullbacks Gordon Duval and C. R. Roberts leading the way.
Roberts scored one touchdown on a 19-yard run and Duval got thfe other
two on runs of five and 25 yards. Arnett contributed a 62-yard kickoff
return that was stopped on the Texas 18.
CALIFORNIA 27. PENNSYLVANIA 7
The Bears finally held onto the ball long enough to score three last
period touchdowns and beat a Pennsylvania team which has now lost its
last 15 games. Cal gained plenty of yardage throughout the game but
killed itself on three early drives with fumbles.
The Bears gained the distinction in this game of picking up their first
first down on the ground. In neither of their first two games were the
Bears able to do so.

Chuck Holloway, and Gerry "IcDougall and fullback Bob Davenport all
played a big part in the Bruin offense, which rolled for 407 yards.
WASHINGTON 19, OREGON 7
The Huskies showed that their 30-0 win over Minnesota was no fluke
as they wore down an Oregon team which had beaten Utah and given USC
three quarters of trouble. The big Washington line gave up 153 yards
1o Oregon's speedy running backs but confined most of that yardage to
Oregon territory. The Ducks did, however, show a passing attack for the
first lime this season as they got 115 yards through the air.
The Huskies scored on three grinding marches with halfbacks Credell
Green and Jim Jones and fullback Mike Monroe moving behind their big
forward wall.
Washington, with two competent quarterbacks in Steve Roake and
Sandy Lederman to go with their line and running game, should make it
rough for the rest of the conference.
SOUTHERN CAL 19. TEXAS 7
The Trojans took their first intersectional game in stride after whip
ping Washington State and Oregon in their first two games. USC knocked
out Texas quarterback Joe Clements in the first quarter to just about kill
the Longhorns' whole offense. Clements was the nation's leading passer
going into the game.
The Trojans again showed power on the ground with tailback Jon Ar
nett and fullbacks Gordon Duval and C. R. Roberts leading the way.
Roberts scored one touchdown on a 19-yard run and Duval got thfe other
two on runs of five and 25 yards. Arnett contributed a 62-yard kickoff
return that was stopped on the Texas 18.
CALIFORNIA 27. PENNSYLVANIA 7
The Bears finally held onto the ball long enough to score three last
period touchdowns and beat a Pennsylvania team which has now lost its
last 15 games. Cal gained plenty of yardage throughout the game but
killed itself on three early drives with fumbles.
The Bears gained the distinction in this game of picking up their first
first down on the ground. In neither of their first two games were the
Bears able to do so.
STANFORD 6, OHIO STATE 0
Both Stanford and the Pacific Coast Conference gained tremendous
prestige because of this result. After Washington's 30-0 smash over Min
nesota, and Cal's tough light against Illinois, the Indians' shutout of Ohio
State makes the "PCC look like a real threat to the Big Ten Conference for
the first time since the prewar years.
Ohio State came into the game with an 11-game winning streak, in
cluding the Hose Bowl game on last New Year's Day. The Buckeyes were
last year's Associated Press mythical national champions and started this
year with a good nucleus of men from that team —halfbacks "Hopalong"
Cassady and Jerry Harkrader, tackle Francis Maehinsky, guard Jim Par
ker, and center Ken Vargo. *
Stanford, which last Saturday was upset by Oregon State, was not
awed by reputation, however, and put on a solid defensive show to contain
the Bucks. The vaunted Ohio State running attack, which last year and
against Nebraska this year averaged around 300 yards per game, was
slowed down to 187 yards by the Stanford defense. The Buckeyes made
yardage through the line but could not shake Cassady or Harkrader loose
on their normally explosive end runs.
Stanford fullback Bill Tarr gained himself All-American recognition
by picking up 102 yards on 20 carries and playing solid defense. The whole
Card team, in fact, played like tigers on defense, with center Joe Long and
tackle Paul Wigyin being particularly outstanding.
II Stanford can move into East Lansing. Michigan, next Saturday and
take Michigan State in its own camp, West Coast football fans can once
again look forward to the Rose Bowl.
UCLA 55, WASHINGTON STATE 0
The Bruins, beaten by Maryland last week, proved in this one that,
despite their loss last week, they are still nobody's pushover. The defeat
was the worst for Washington State in 33 years.
What is doubly impressive about UCLA's victory is the fact that the
Cougars are traditionally tough in their home stadium at Pullman and
that the Cougars were rated as a pre-season conference dark horse
although they have now lost their first three games.
WSC showed absolutely no punch while the Bruins scored practically
at will even though first-string tailback Ronny Knox sat out the entire
game. Second- through fifth-string tailbacks Sam Brown, Doug Bradley,
Chuck Holloway, and Gerry "IcDougall and fullback Bob Davenport all
played a big part in the Bruin offense, which rolled for 407 yards.
