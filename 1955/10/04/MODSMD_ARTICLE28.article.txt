SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 3 (U.R)—
Coach Chuck Taylor, the least sur
prised man on the coast after Stan
ford's 6-0 upset of Ohio State, said
today his Indians might catch Michi
gan State at a low ebb after the
Spartans' 14-7 loss to Michigan.
"Michigan State probably was
pretty high for Michigan — which
could be to our advantage when we
show up at East Lansing on Satur
day," Taylor told the Northern Cali
fornia Football Writers Association.
"I think we have a good chance

ball practice session will be open

faculty. Open practice on Tues
day will be standard procedure
for (lie remainder of the season.

against them, although I don't know
how to figure the game at all. How
ever, if we can hold up against Ohio
State, we can hold up against any
body."
Coach Lynn Waldorf of California
served the usual notice that he was
not taking thrice-beaten Washington
State too lightly.
"Washington State has had the
misfortune to run into Southern
California and UCLA early in its
schedule," Waldorf declared. ''And I
understand from our scouts that
UCLA is on the way to being a bet
ter club than it was last year."
Waldorf said he expected to be
able to use only seven lettermen
against Washington State Saturday,
which is well steeped in veterans as
well as defeats.
Don Faris, the Cougars' publicist,
said his crowd was "just as confused
as the San Francisco Forty-niners
are."
Bob Bronzan, coach of San Jose
State, pointed out that 26 members
of Arizona (Tempe) State hail from
.rugged western Pennsylvania, and
that the Sun Devils have adopted
Michigan State's multiple offense—
which is just as rpugh.
