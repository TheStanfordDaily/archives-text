# Yanks Fight Black to Tie Series: Skowron Homers-Snider Injured
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 3 (UP) —The New York Yankees lived up to
their legend today when the back-to-the-wall pitching of Whitey
Ford and a three-run homer by Bill Skowron crushed the Brooklyn
Dodgers 5 to 1 and squared the World Series at three games each.
Five-time conquerors of the same long-frustrated Dodgers, the

i Yankees stood only one game from
defeat as they went grimly out into
the bright, brisk sunshine before
64,022 fans at Yankee Stadium. They
had lost three in a row at Ebbets
Field, and Dodger hopes were high
that they would beat the left-hand
ed Ford.
But the Yankees, swinging like
vaunted Bombers of the past, routed
' fire-balling Karl Spooner in the first
big innirvg—piling up five runs on a
| "wrong field" homer by the burly
Skowron, touted as "the new Lou
Gehrig."
And the blond, chunky Ford took
jit from there.
Little Whitey, who twice has need
ed ninth-inning relief to post World
i Series triumphs, including the first
game of this classic, was tremendous
today as he mowed down Brooklyn
with a sparkling four-hitter and
stranded six impatient Dodgers on
| the base paths.
It made him only the second left
hander this year to go all the way
in beating the Dodgers. Tommy
Byrne, another Yankee southpaw,
| did it for the first time in the second
j game of the classic.
Ford's crafty performance and
; Skowron's slicing homer into the
; lower right field stands to cap that
| shocking first inning made it a bad
j day all around for Brooklyn, be
cause the Dodgers—seven times pre
viously defeated in series play—had

hoped to end 52 years of baseball
bitterness by wrapping it up against
Ford. Instead, they went down to
defeat—and possibly lost the services
of Duke Snider in tomorrow's finale.
The Duke, hitting hero of the
series with four home runs, stepped
into a hole in the outfield in the
third inning while running for Skow
ron's fly ball, and "something popped
in my left knee." Gloomily he re
futed to guess whether he would be
available tomorrow.
YANKS HIT EARLY
The Yankees didn't wait long to
put up that big cushion for Ford. In
the opening frame little Phil Riz
zuto, playing in his 51st series game
to tie a Joe DiMaggio record, led
off with a walk. As Billy Martin
went down swinging, the "Scooter"
put the first run into scoring posi
tion by stealing second base.
That steal set it all up, and the
"goat" had to be Junior Gilliam,
standing entranced as he watched
the strikeout and momentarily for
getting to cover second so that Roy
Campanella had to check his throw.
Gil McDougald then drew a walk
as Spooner faltered.
YOGI SETS RECORD
Yogi Berra, setting another mark
by catching in his 39th series game
to surpass Bill Dickey by one,
rapped a single over second, sending
Rizzuto home with the first run and
putting McDougald on third. Hank
Bauer followed that with a single
to left, McDougald scampering home
and Berra holding up at second.
That's when Skowron, hailed as
the "new Lou Gehrig" before an
early-season leg injury checked his
tremendous hitting, stepped up and
polished off Spooner—and the Dodg
ers.
