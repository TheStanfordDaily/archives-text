# Card Gridders Off Sick List
## 
### 
Stanford's grid forces began a
we e k's preparation for Michigan
State's Spartans yesterday in about
the best physical shape of the season
so far.
Card trainer Connie Jarvis termed
the Indians '"in by far the best con
dition ever, after three games."
Centers Don Geddes and Russ
Steele, halfback Gordy Young, and
tackle Chris Plain were suited up
yesterday, after missing the Ohio
State contest. Geddes, Steele and
Plain have yet to see varsity action
this year.
No serious injuries hampered the
Tribe against Ohio State —termed by
some gridders as the cleanest oppo
nents played in some time. Only end
Joel Freis, with an injured rib, is
still on the varsity disabled list.
The Cards began working on a
defense to try to stop Michigan
State's multiple offense. Hugh (Duf
fy) Daugherty, for eight years an
assistant to Clarence (Biggie) Munn
at East Lansing, is beginning his sec
ond season as teacher of this com
plex offense.
Daugherty's 1954 Michigan State
team won three and lost six to wind
up in a tie for eighth place in the
Big Ten.
Movies of the Spartan eleven were
shown to the Indian gridders last
night following practice.
All those players who saw little
or no action against the Buckeyes
Saturday went through a game con
ditioning scrimmage in yesterday's
session. «
