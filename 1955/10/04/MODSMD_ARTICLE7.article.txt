# U.S. Tries Atomic Ocean Power Plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The United
States announced today it is pushing
a major five-front program to har
ness the H-bomb that might turn
oceans into almost inexhaustible
power mines "for the next million
years."
Chairman Lewis L. Strauss of the
Atomic Energy Commission took
some of the wraps ofT the U. S. hy
drogen-power program at a special
news conference.
He said work on the program,
known as "Project Sherwood," began
in 1951 and has been expanded rap
idly since. Research now is in prog
ress in five separate places by some
of the nation's most brilliant mathe
maticians and physicists.
Strauss did not indicate what
progress has been made, except to
make it clear that the scientific
"break-through" that may show the
way to taming the hydrogen bomb's
awful might has not yet come.
He said he would not be surprised
if science achieves such a "break -
i through" within 20 years, as pre
dicted by Dr. Homi Bhabha, head
of India's atomic energy agency, at
the August Atoms-for-Peace Con-
I ference in Geneva, Switzerland.
