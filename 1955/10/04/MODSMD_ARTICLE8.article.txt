# UN 						Withdrawal Called 'Political'
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Violent quest for autonomy
from French rule in North Africa
has attracted international atten
tion as France just stopped short
of withdrawal from the United
I
Nations and saw a new and
bloody revolt rising in Morocco.
Recently returned from Morocco
and European capitals, emeritus pro
fessor of political science Graham
H. Stuart, expert on French foreign
affairs, believes that France's stand
on temporary withdrawal from the
UN General Assembly was made
from a primarily political motive —
to strengthen the position of the
present government.
SHOWDOWN VOTE
Premier Edgar Faure is soon to
face a showdown vote in the Na
tional Assembly, according to Stuart,
on the same issue that brought Men
des - France tumbling from power
earlier this year.
A strong stand in the United Na
tions on the troublesome issue might
make Faure's position more secure
in light of the power and stubborn
ness of the conservative French co
lonials, who refuse to see France
lose her foreign territory.
France possesses the legal right
to insist that the Algerian issue is
a domestic one and therefore not
under the jurisdiction of the United
Nations, since Algeria is a part of

metropolitan France and not a pro
tectorate as is Morocco, Stuart point
ed out.
"Nevertheless," Stuart said, "it is
unfortunate that she took the stand
she did.
"In Morocco they were ready to
work out a compromise program,
but things such as this greatly
strengthen the nationalist cause and
make for new trouble.
MOROCCO MORE SERIOUS
In explaining the difference be
tween the Algerian, Moroccan, and
Tunisian problems, Stuart said that
| the Moroccan situation is more in
| tensified than that of Algeria or Tu-
I nisia because of the powerful French
j colonials there.
"The French made a great mistake
which they now realize," he said,
when they deposed the Morocca*
sultan last year and substituted a
pro - French figure, inciting fierce
new attacks.
The compromise, worked out be-
I fore the new fighting began in Mo
! rocco, provided that the French
[ puppet-sultan be recalled to France,
and that the battle-weary country
be ruled by a commission of three
[•men composed of one Moroccan, one
| colonial and one neutral.
Settlement of the Tunisian prob
! lem is now being worked out by
Faure under a program set up by
| Mendes-France before his deposi
tion.
The Algerian trouble was brought
j on only last November, when war
, ring rebels came down from the
j mountains and precipitated a pro
gram of more complete control and
I integration by the French.
"CHARTER VIOLATION"
France, calling the UN General
Assembly's 28-27 decision to take
up the Algerian question "a flagrant
violation of the UN Charter," has
withdrawn from the General Assem
bly, but retained technical member
ship by staying on the Security
Council and on the Disarmament and
Military committees.
The Communist bloc voted in
favor of the Arab-sponsored request
for consideration, but Stuart said
the Mipport was merely to take a
stab at Western powers. "There is
| no evidence of Communist influence
I in Africa," he said.

GRAHAM H. STUART
Violent quest for autonomy
from French rule in North Africa
has attracted international atten
tion as France just stopped short
of withdrawal from the United
I
Nations and saw a new and
bloody revolt rising in Morocco.
Recently returned from Morocco
and European capitals, emeritus pro
fessor of political science Graham
H. Stuart, expert on French foreign
affairs, believes that France's stand
on temporary withdrawal from the
UN General Assembly was made
from a primarily political motive —
to strengthen the position of the
present government.
SHOWDOWN VOTE
Premier Edgar Faure is soon to
face a showdown vote in the Na
tional Assembly, according to Stuart,
on the same issue that brought Men
des - France tumbling from power
earlier this year.
A strong stand in the United Na
tions on the troublesome issue might
make Faure's position more secure
in light of the power and stubborn
ness of the conservative French co
lonials, who refuse to see France
lose her foreign territory.
France possesses the legal right
to insist that the Algerian issue is
a domestic one and therefore not
under the jurisdiction of the United
Nations, since Algeria is a part of

metropolitan France and not a pro
tectorate as is Morocco, Stuart point
ed out.
"Nevertheless," Stuart said, "it is
unfortunate that she took the stand
she did.
"In Morocco they were ready to
work out a compromise program,
but things such as this greatly
strengthen the nationalist cause and
make for new trouble.
MOROCCO MORE SERIOUS
In explaining the difference be
tween the Algerian, Moroccan, and
Tunisian problems, Stuart said that
| the Moroccan situation is more in
| tensified than that of Algeria or Tu-
I nisia because of the powerful French
j colonials there.
"The French made a great mistake
which they now realize," he said,
when they deposed the Morocca*
sultan last year and substituted a
pro - French figure, inciting fierce
new attacks.
The compromise, worked out be-
I fore the new fighting began in Mo
! rocco, provided that the French
[ puppet-sultan be recalled to France,
and that the battle-weary country
be ruled by a commission of three
[•men composed of one Moroccan, one
| colonial and one neutral.
Settlement of the Tunisian prob
! lem is now being worked out by
Faure under a program set up by
| Mendes-France before his deposi
tion.
The Algerian trouble was brought
j on only last November, when war
, ring rebels came down from the
j mountains and precipitated a pro
gram of more complete control and
I integration by the French.
"CHARTER VIOLATION"
France, calling the UN General
Assembly's 28-27 decision to take
up the Algerian question "a flagrant
violation of the UN Charter," has
withdrawn from the General Assem
bly, but retained technical member
ship by staying on the Security
Council and on the Disarmament and
Military committees.
The Communist bloc voted in
favor of the Arab-sponsored request
for consideration, but Stuart said
the Mipport was merely to take a
stab at Western powers. "There is
| no evidence of Communist influence
I in Africa," he said.
