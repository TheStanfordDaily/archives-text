# Dean of Delhi University Law Faculty Visits Stanford Campus
## Thinks 'Moral India' Can Be Developed Through Education 
### STEW TOY 
With Stanford the "threshold"
of his Ford Foundation-spon
sored study, Dean L. R. Sivasu
bramanian of India's New Delhi
University law faculty has be
gun a tour of American law
schools, with an eye to helping
create, through education, what
he calls a "moral India."
"Some are trying to restore India
to what it was in the days of old,"
he says. "But merely that won't
work. We must build a moral India."
At Stanford, first of some dozen
law schools he will visit in this
country, Sivasubramanian has been
attending classes and seminars, try
ing to get first-hand knowledge of
American techniques in legal edu
cation, our modes of teaching, and
advanced theories.
He hopes to put this knowledge
to work in building Indian educa
tion and law research, now in a com
paratively undeveloped state.
Before its independence, he says,
India had no international part to
play. Its only claim to world atten
tion was through Gandhi, Nehru,
and other leaders of international
fame.
Now India must develop its edu
cation so it can better meet world
situations, as well as improve in
ternal conditions. Improvement in
legal education is the logical way to
do this, since virtually every Indian
leader comes from the legal pro
fession.
In his first American press con
ference, held yesterday in the Stan
ford Law School, Sivasubramanian,
who is traveling with his wife,
stressed that his opinions on po
litical matters are opinions, and

I nothing more.
But the ones he had were in
teresting, and perhaps typical of the
educated Indian.
Of Communism's influence in the
Indian government, he had this to
say: "At the moment (Communism)
is no more than of mere nuisance
value. To want to be neighborly and
friendly with a country across the
border is one thing. To be a Com
munist is another."
Indians, he says, will continue to
j be Indians, and -nothing else. "We've

continued that way for 2,000 years,
in spite of the Mohammedans and
the British. We shall always be In
dians above everything."
Sivasubramanian, as well as being
dean of the New Delhi faculty, is
on the faculty or board of examiners
of nine other North Indian univer
sities.
New Delhi University, one of 32
in India, was founded in 1923. Class
es, in accordance with the Indian
Constitution, are conducted exclu

sively in English, reflecting India's
long rule by Great Britain.
Although New Delhi is a Hindu
university, members of all religions
are admitted. This helps establish a
"sympathy" between the past and
the present, Sivasubramanian says,
j "so we won't get so completely mod-
I ernized that we'll forget about past
accomplishments." •
The Sivasubramanians have five
I children—two boys and three girls.
Their eldest son is now working for
the Ph.D. in economics at the Uni
j versity of Chicago.
That he should attend an Ameri
can university is in keeping with
the new trend in Indian advanced
education. Previously students, espe
cially those in law, studied in Eng
land, mainly to learn how to cope
with the rulers of their country.
But the English "didn't like trou
ble makers" and demanded explana
tions from students as to why they
| wanted to study law.
Most Indian students now' come to
the United States to study for de
grees, because of the availability of
financial assistance and because of
the more advanced courses offered
here.
Also, the similarities in law be
tween the two countries is an at
traction. The Indian Constitution is
based on those of the United States,
j Canada and Australia.
Although Stanford is the first uni
versity on his itinerary here, Siva
subramanian said of it,"I have a
feeling I have seen one of the best."
Stanford students he found to have
the "brightest faces" he has seen.
"They are the young flowers of hu
manity."
The Sivasubramanians will leave
Stanford Friday to visit the Univer
i sity of California, Columbia, Yale,
Harvard, Chicago, Michigan, and
j several other midwestern and south
• ern universities, each for about four
| weeks.
They may return here in February
or March, at the end of their six
j months' stay in the United States.

create, through education, what
he calls a "moral India."
"Some are trying to restore India
to what it was in the days of old,"
he says. "But merely that won't
work. We must build a moral India."
At Stanford, first of some dozen
law schools he will visit in this
country, Sivasubramanian has been
attending classes and seminars, try
ing to get first-hand knowledge of
American techniques in legal edu
cation, our modes of teaching, and
advanced theories.
He hopes to put this knowledge
to work in building Indian educa
tion and law research, now in a com
paratively undeveloped state.
Before its independence, he says,
India had no international part to
play. Its only claim to world atten
tion was through Gandhi, Nehru,
and other leaders of international
fame.
Now India must develop its edu
cation so it can better meet world
situations, as well as improve in
ternal conditions. Improvement in
legal education is the logical way to
do this, since virtually every Indian
leader comes from the legal pro
fession.
In his first American press con
ference, held yesterday in the Stan
ford Law School, Sivasubramanian,
who is traveling with his wife,
stressed that his opinions on po
litical matters are opinions, and

I nothing more.
But the ones he had were in
teresting, and perhaps typical of the
educated Indian.
Of Communism's influence in the
Indian government, he had this to
say: "At the moment (Communism)
is no more than of mere nuisance
value. To want to be neighborly and
friendly with a country across the
border is one thing. To be a Com
munist is another."
Indians, he says, will continue to
j be Indians, and -nothing else. "We've

continued that way for 2,000 years,
in spite of the Mohammedans and
the British. We shall always be In
dians above everything."
Sivasubramanian, as well as being
dean of the New Delhi faculty, is
on the faculty or board of examiners
of nine other North Indian univer
sities.
New Delhi University, one of 32
in India, was founded in 1923. Class
es, in accordance with the Indian
Constitution, are conducted exclu

sively in English, reflecting India's
long rule by Great Britain.
Although New Delhi is a Hindu
university, members of all religions
are admitted. This helps establish a
"sympathy" between the past and
the present, Sivasubramanian says,
j "so we won't get so completely mod-
I ernized that we'll forget about past
accomplishments." •
The Sivasubramanians have five
I children—two boys and three girls.
Their eldest son is now working for
the Ph.D. in economics at the Uni
j versity of Chicago.
That he should attend an Ameri
can university is in keeping with
the new trend in Indian advanced
education. Previously students, espe
cially those in law, studied in Eng
land, mainly to learn how to cope
with the rulers of their country.
But the English "didn't like trou
ble makers" and demanded explana
tions from students as to why they
| wanted to study law.
Most Indian students now' come to
the United States to study for de
grees, because of the availability of
financial assistance and because of
the more advanced courses offered
here.
Also, the similarities in law be
tween the two countries is an at
traction. The Indian Constitution is
based on those of the United States,
j Canada and Australia.
Although Stanford is the first uni
versity on his itinerary here, Siva
subramanian said of it,"I have a
feeling I have seen one of the best."
Stanford students he found to have
the "brightest faces" he has seen.
"They are the young flowers of hu
manity."
The Sivasubramanians will leave
Stanford Friday to visit the Univer
i sity of California, Columbia, Yale,
Harvard, Chicago, Michigan, and
j several other midwestern and south
• ern universities, each for about four
| weeks.
They may return here in February
or March, at the end of their six
j months' stay in the United States.

country, Sivasubramanian has been
attending classes and seminars, try
ing to get first-hand knowledge of
American techniques in legal edu
cation, our modes of teaching, and
advanced theories.
He hopes to put this knowledge
to work in building Indian educa
tion and law research, now in a com
paratively undeveloped state.
Before its independence, he says,
India had no international part to
play. Its only claim to world atten
tion was through Gandhi, Nehru,
and other leaders of international
fame.
Now India must develop its edu
cation so it can better meet world
situations, as well as improve in
ternal conditions. Improvement in
legal education is the logical way to
do this, since virtually every Indian
leader comes from the legal pro
fession.
In his first American press con
ference, held yesterday in the Stan
ford Law School, Sivasubramanian,
who is traveling with his wife,
stressed that his opinions on po
litical matters are opinions, and

I nothing more.
But the ones he had were in
teresting, and perhaps typical of the
educated Indian.
Of Communism's influence in the
Indian government, he had this to
say: "At the moment (Communism)
is no more than of mere nuisance
value. To want to be neighborly and
friendly with a country across the
border is one thing. To be a Com
munist is another."
Indians, he says, will continue to
j be Indians, and -nothing else. "We've

continued that way for 2,000 years,
in spite of the Mohammedans and
the British. We shall always be In
dians above everything."
Sivasubramanian, as well as being
dean of the New Delhi faculty, is
on the faculty or board of examiners
of nine other North Indian univer
sities.
New Delhi University, one of 32
in India, was founded in 1923. Class
es, in accordance with the Indian
Constitution, are conducted exclu

sively in English, reflecting India's
long rule by Great Britain.
Although New Delhi is a Hindu
university, members of all religions
are admitted. This helps establish a
"sympathy" between the past and
the present, Sivasubramanian says,
j "so we won't get so completely mod-
I ernized that we'll forget about past
accomplishments." •
The Sivasubramanians have five
I children—two boys and three girls.
Their eldest son is now working for
the Ph.D. in economics at the Uni
j versity of Chicago.
That he should attend an Ameri
can university is in keeping with
the new trend in Indian advanced
education. Previously students, espe
cially those in law, studied in Eng
land, mainly to learn how to cope
with the rulers of their country.
But the English "didn't like trou
ble makers" and demanded explana
tions from students as to why they
| wanted to study law.
Most Indian students now' come to
the United States to study for de
grees, because of the availability of
financial assistance and because of
the more advanced courses offered
here.
Also, the similarities in law be
tween the two countries is an at
traction. The Indian Constitution is
based on those of the United States,
j Canada and Australia.
Although Stanford is the first uni
versity on his itinerary here, Siva
subramanian said of it,"I have a
feeling I have seen one of the best."
Stanford students he found to have
the "brightest faces" he has seen.
"They are the young flowers of hu
manity."
The Sivasubramanians will leave
Stanford Friday to visit the Univer
i sity of California, Columbia, Yale,
Harvard, Chicago, Michigan, and
j several other midwestern and south
• ern universities, each for about four
| weeks.
They may return here in February
or March, at the end of their six
j months' stay in the United States.
