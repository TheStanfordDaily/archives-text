# TUESDAY SERIES
## Speaker Calls FDR Legend, Top Politician 
### SALLY TRAPNELL 
"History is pushed aside bv
politics when Roosevelt is eval
uated" was Emeritus Professor
Edgar E. Robinson's appraisal of
the Roosevelt legend in his lec
ture on "Franklin Delano Roose
velt" last night on the Tuesday
Series program.
# "Roosevelt will be a figure of
splendor only if the legend about
him is maintained, not if history is
brought in. . . . The great danger
is to report history in terms of his
legend. . . . Truth is not partisan,
partial, or personal."
It was Robinson's view that "no
king ever ruled more completely in
the hearts of his people" than did
Roosevelt among the American peo
ple. "He asserted the powers of a
dictator . . . but there is no doubt
that his policies were heartily sup
ported by the majority of the peo
pleâ€”at that time."
DOZEN DECISIONS
In Robinson's opinion. Roosevelt
made a dozen vitally important de
cisions during his terms. Among the
most important were his isolationist
policy at the 1933 World Economic-
Conference and his recognition of
Russia, both of which, in Robinson's
opinion, promoted the growth of
dictatorships.
According to Robinson, Roosevelt's
other important policies were the
New Deal, which helped millions but
left the United States with a large
national debt, and the "quarantine
for aggressors," which led America
into World War 11.
He also mentioned Roosevelt's
curbing of Supreme Court power,
his policy of unconditional surrender
and' the development of the atomic
bom b.
DEVELOPED U.N.
"Mr. Roosevelt was also responsi
ble for the development of the UN,
a structure which promotes national
ism. as exemplified by France, and
was mainly organized to fight Com
munism."
The speaker also commented on
Roosevelt's part in the Yalta con
ference, where "the basic policy, al
though not known to the public, was
to cooperate with Russia to end the
war and develop spheres of influ
ence." However, Robinson believes
that final judgment on the meeting
must wait until the Rusisan archives
arc made public and the "China
tangle" is better understood.
F.I).II. VERY TIRED
Robinson maintains that, while
Roosevelt was very tired during his
last year in office, "he was fully
able to formulate decisions and de
bate issues. It was hi.s responsibil
ity."
He concluded with the statement
that "everyone's life and thought
was influenced by Roosevelt." and
that each must judge him now and
in years to come. Robinson believes
that, whatever the verdict, FDR will
live in history as do Washington
and Lincoln.
