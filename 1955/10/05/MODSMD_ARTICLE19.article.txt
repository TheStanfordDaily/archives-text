# what about the rally?
## 
### 
These columns have been filled this week by
a number of letters concerning the Ohio State
rally Friday night at the Sunken Diamond. The
resulting controversy has spread beyond these
columns and beyond ihe campus to the pages
of the local professional press. It started with
a letter written by four freshman girls protest
ing "crude and vulgar jokes" at the rally. That
much is background.
What about tire rally, what about ihe jokes?
Well, the girls were right. One particular joke
was off-color, unnecessarily off-color. Prudish
or not, this is a feeling held by many students
including Head Cheer Leader Jim Walters. The
impropriety of the joke was felt immediately; a
letter was not needed for that.
But a letter was needed for other reasons.
On this campus where the activities are run by
students, it is obligatory that the students —
the students who lead and the sudents who
just observe —speak up. The authors of the let
ter felt that corrective measures were needed
and they did speak up. They spoke courage
ously; they spoke in the face of impending in
sults.
And they have been insulted. And they have

been told that they should just ignore and ac
cept the unpleasant and the crude, that it is
immature and against the Stanford tradition to
seek reform when you think reform is needed.
Take note, if you will, of which letters on the
subject were signed and which letters were
followed by "names withheld by request." And
come into this office sometime to see the file
of letters to which no names or phony names
were signed and thus not printed. You can
decide who is acting in the Stanford tradition
and who is not.
Where do we go from here? To better ral
lies, of course. All people concerned with last
weekend's rally regret the mistakes and have
taken the necessary steps to prevent repetition.
Jim Walters said, "We all believe the letter did
good. I commended them (the girls) for writing
it and said that we're lucky here at Stanford to
be able to voice our opinions."
Jim Walters, we know, felt worse about the
joke than anyone who has protested. He has
handled the-problem intelligently and straight
forwardly. We have confidence that under his
direction Stanford rallies and rooting sections
will rate great respect from all observers.

And they have been insulted. And they have

been told that they should just ignore and ac
cept the unpleasant and the crude, that it is
immature and against the Stanford tradition to
seek reform when you think reform is needed.
Take note, if you will, of which letters on the
subject were signed and which letters were
followed by "names withheld by request." And
come into this office sometime to see the file
of letters to which no names or phony names
were signed and thus not printed. You can
decide who is acting in the Stanford tradition
and who is not.
Where do we go from here? To better ral
lies, of course. All people concerned with last
weekend's rally regret the mistakes and have
taken the necessary steps to prevent repetition.
Jim Walters said, "We all believe the letter did
good. I commended them (the girls) for writing
it and said that we're lucky here at Stanford to
be able to voice our opinions."
Jim Walters, we know, felt worse about the
joke than anyone who has protested. He has
handled the-problem intelligently and straight
forwardly. We have confidence that under his
direction Stanford rallies and rooting sections
will rate great respect from all observers.
