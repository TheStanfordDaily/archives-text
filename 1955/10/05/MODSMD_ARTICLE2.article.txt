# Phantom Fran Found Flying From Flagpole
## 
### 
Officer Dan West of the Stanford
Police Department looked up at the
flagpole in front of the Main Library
at 1 a.m. yesterday and promptly
concluded something was wrong.
For there, hanging at the top of
the 50-foot pole, was a nude woman.
Of half a nude woman. Or, on closer
inspection, a fashion display dummy,
strung up by the neck.
Came the dawn and there she, or
it, was. The fashion show concluded
at 10 yesterday morning when those
sitting in front of the library craned
<
their necks to the sky to watch Corp
Yard employee Eugene Engleking
(descending ladder) cut the young
lady down and bear her off to less
conspicuous surroundings.
Engleking's chore was more than
embarrassing; it was downright dan
gerous. It seems that the ladder he
used and the flagpole he climbed
with it were of different heights.
He solved this dilemma with a
long pole, to which was attached a
long, sharp knife with which he cut
down the young thing.
What the Coip Yard wants to
know: Who, and how, and when?
And why?
