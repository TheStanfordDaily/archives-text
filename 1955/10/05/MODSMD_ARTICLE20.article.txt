Actually, last week should have been called
Back to the Farm Week. That's what it was.
The Great Matriculation, the return of the vet
eran Farmhands from their summer wander
ings to their academic loves and labors, and
all that.
But according to Cardinals, this week is Back
to the Farm Week and will be duly celebrated.
The activities begin tonight with student-fac
ulty dinners at most residences and many fac
ulty homes. Then Cardinals will hold the frol
icking Farm Follies in Frost about 7:30. Tomor
row is Games Day (not to be confused with
Kids' Day) and then the festivities conclude
Friday with Olympic Day (not to be confused
with anything).
Tonight's student - faculty dinners are the

most valuable part of the entire program. Al
though Stanford is a residence University,
there has been insufficient informal contact be
tween the students and their instructors. Con
tact between faculty and students has not been
completely lacking, but it has not been as
plentiful or as fruitful as it could be and should
be at a university of this sort.
Last year the Cardinals made strides in reme
dying this situation when they initiated the
dinners. Since that time the Student-Faculty
Committee has done much rewarding work in
the same field.
Tonight's dinners should help develop a
closer relationship between the students and
the faculty. We hope they can lead to more
spontaneous, informal associations.
