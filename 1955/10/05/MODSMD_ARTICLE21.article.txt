congratulations
To the Editor:
I would like to go on record as one of the possibly
two or three other people on campus who are in
agreement with the four freshman girls who were
disappointed in the quality and poor taste displayed
in last Friday's rally.
I was, however, amused by the answering letter in
the Daily of Oct. 4. It is amazing to note how in a
short period of two and a half weeks (including pre
rog) these girls were able to discover the workings of
"adult college minds." I would be among the first to
admit that tolerance has its place, but must one always
turn the other cheek to poor taste instead of trying
to remedy a foul situation? I say no, and offer my
congratulations to four freshmen that possess the
strength of conviction required to sign their letter.

a part of life
In answer to four girls, plus two:
By now it should be apparent that sex is an ac
ceptable part of life, and like everything else, has its
humorous aspects. If you are not mature enough to
be able to laugh at this side of life also, then you are
not ready for Stanford.
There certainly is a difference between humor and
obscenity. The ''nightie" joke approached the latter.
However, part of maturity is tolerance of other peo
ple':-; mistakes. It was enough that the crowd showed
their displeasure with the joke at the time.
National prominence has come your way and we
are sure your mothers will reward your apparent
show of virtue well. Only time and Stanford men will
decide the truth of the matter.

an ode
To the Editor:
This poem is written in the honor of four very im
mature freshmaif women who wrote a letter which
w.i.: printed in the Oct. 3 issue. This letter concerned
the "vulgarity" of speech in the Ohio State rally
Sept. MO. The following (in their honor) is our reply:
Ode to Four Freshman YY>imeu?
Mommie, IVIommie, gee oh golly

There were nasty jokes at the Stanford rally,
Those horrible boys, Mommie dear, â€¢
Told those jokes so all could hear.
We have been so sheltered all our lives,
When we heard those jokes, we nearly died!
Gee Mommie, gosh-a-rootie!
We were only trying to do our duty
By writing our letter to turn them in
Which we hoped would make them cleaner men.
Other girls tell us how much we miss
Darn, Mommie! You didn't tell us about this!

signs needed
To the Editor:
This may sound rather basic but there would be
far more popular support for the new Willow Road
extension if signs were erected at its beginning and
end pointing out where it goes. Travelers from the
northern part of the Peninsula using the campus roads
as thoroughfares east to Palo Alto and Bayshore have
a right to complain when signs on a barricaded road
direct them to double back a half-mile to a "secret"
cutoff.
Maybe after such a move, Chief Davis' traffic count
on the new road will be high enough to allow Santa
Teresa Street to be reopened to the Menlo Park
campus commuter, who like every other student en
joys a convenient way of getting to the Quad.

a new tradition?
To whom it may concern:
In behalf of the .'550 freshman girls of Stanford
whose luggage was efficiently ami courteously trans
ported free of charge Sept. 22, we would like to pub
licly thank Alpha Phi Omega for their excellent
service project.
At both Roble and Branner, A Phi O crews worked
all day helping the Ireshmen move in. Their prompt
service avoided luggage tangles, and greatly facili
tated the complicated moving-in procedure.
May we express the hope that Alpha Phi Omega
has initiated a new Stanford tradition?
Sincerely,
THE SPONSORS OF ROBLE
AND BKANNFK
