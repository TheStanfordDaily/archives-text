# Rally Com Behind Farm Rooters' Card Capers
## 
### FRANK HUNTRESS 
It's half time at a football game,
and you're one of the 2,0(10 Stan
ford roughs dressed in white shirts
and blue denims.
It is a time of rejaxation for
most of the people at the game.
Hut not for you. YOU are a mem
ber of the Stanford card stunt
section.
Before long the chairman of the
Rally Committee, which sponsors
the stunts, begins barking instruc
tions at you over a microphone.
He refers you to the instruction
card that is furnished along with
the six other colored cards under
your seat.
The instructions tell you what
color card to use for each of the
different stunts. The man on the
microphone tells you what stunt
is next and when to place the card
in front of your face.

Within 15 minutes it's all over.
You have received cheers and con
gratulations from the cvowd.
But actually you have only fol
lowed the simple instructions given
you. What about the master plan
ning that makes the expanding
"S" unfold in a neat, symmetrical
mamter? This has heen taken care
of for you by the stunt card divi
sion of the Rally Committee.
A junior by the name of Bill
Lackey heads the stunt card divi
sion. It is his job to see that the
12,000 cards which are used each
Saturday come out in the same
pattern as >hown on a master grid
sheet prepared by the avt division
of Rally Com.
Art Director Pete Scott, along
with his staff, thinks up ideas for
stunts one week prior to a game.
The suggestions that are chosen
to he used (usually 10 per game)

are drawn up on the master sheets
which are submitted to Lackey.
Members of Rally Com, who are
required to work eight hours per
week and Saturday mArnings for
the card division, begin stamping
the instruction cards. This stamp
ing of numbers and colors on to
the instruction lists must he com
pleted the Friday nitfht before
each game.
Each instruction card is stamped
at least 10 times, making a mini
mum of 20,00(1 stampings. These
instruction lists must lie- checked
twice. This makes a total of (50.000
handlings.
On Wednesday the 12.000 color
cards are sorted and made ready
for the game.
Lackey then must write a com
mentary of the stunts for radio
(and TV, if necessary) and submit
it to Stanford Athletic Director

Don Liebendorfer.
At 8 a.m. on Saturday, Rally
Com members—except the art di
vision members who are working
on the next week's stunts—begin
setting up the cards and instruc
tions according to the master plan
of each one. »
Now YOU come into the picture,
using the instructions found under
your seat and the voice directions
of Rally Com Chairman Don Cro
well. He's the guy who counts
out loud and tells you "when."
After the stunts are performed
the cards are passed to the rooters'
light. This is a new twist to begin
with the UCLA game. Last week
end they were passed to the left,
but it has been found that by pass
in,? them to the light, it puts the
cards closer to the storage room
and relieves the congestion caused
in the concession aisle.

Rally Com always wants all of
the 12,(100 cards hack in good con
dition, because to replace a card
it costs the ASSU—which means
the students—lo cents. The fund
allowed by ASSU for card stunts
has been depleted by the purchase
»if new color cards for this season,
according to Lackey.
Card Stunt Chairman Lackey
says:"I would like to tbank the
entire student body, and particu
larly the men's section, for the
great cooperation given last Sat
urday. The stunts are yours, and
last Saturday they were received
will by millions of TV viewers
across the nation."
As to future card stunts. Lackey
stated that the two that are always
used (the expanding "S" and the
"S" with the Stanford tree grow
ing through will he made into
one stunt.
