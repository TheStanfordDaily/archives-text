# IN BAR-ROOMS, FRUSTRATION
## Peninsula Theater Festival One-Acts Achieve â€˜Varying Degrees of Success' 
### RICHARD MENDE 
The 1955 Peninsula Community Theater Festival is currently presenting three original one-act
plays, "Dust," "John and Mary," and "Out of Track," all award winners in the annual Alliance
competition.
They achieve varying degrees of dramatic success but their chief contribution is the discovery
of Anna Marie Barlow, honors winner for "Out of Track."
"Dust," which received the top award, concerns a poetic wanderer passing through an isolated

roadside combination lunch and ga
rage in the Apache desert, New j
Mexico. While the play manages to
suggest the atmosphere of physical
and spiritual desolation, and has
some interesting prose-poetic pas
sages, it fails to build up any real
dramatic interest.
MARRIED COUPLE
"John and/or Mary" by John
Kelly is an entertaining bit about a
married couple who decide on their ;
31 st anniversary to exchange places,
Mary satisfying her executive crav- i
ings by taking over the successful
business, and John taking it easy
running the house.
While the exchange idea is not ex
actly original, it achieves sophistica- j
tion through skillful and sprightly
handling. The set displays unusual
ingenuity and taste and Jane Steckle
and Donn Selhorn are charming as
Mr. and Mrs.
But the chief item of interest for
the evening was the piece entitled
"Out of Track," which the producers
quite wisely selected for the final
place in the program. It is top-rate
stuff.
The play concerns a man of out- j
standing talent for whom life has j
lost its meaning. Although the j
theme is familiar in modern litera
ture, this treatment is fresh and
sure.
UNRESOLVED PROBLEM
Waily Gebhardt, an actor of abil
ity, expresses his frustration and re
bellion at a value-less world in pe
riodic drinking bouts and barroom ;
brawls which have come finally to
jeopardize his career. He accepts,
and in self-pity seems almost to
welcome, this as a part of his pun
ishment.
Although the play ends on a j
somewhat optimistic note the prob- j
lem is not completely resolved, j
