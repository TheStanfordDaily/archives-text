## Dodgers Beat Yanks, 2-0; Win First World Series 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 4 (UP)—Brooklyn's Dodgers of Destiny per
formed the "impossible" today when "Hard-Luck Johnny" Podres
oitched them to their long-awaited first world championship by
beating the New York Yankees, 2-0, in the now-or-never seventh
Series game.
Beaten in seven previous heart-breaking attempts to win the

World Series, the determined Dodg
ers ended 55 years of baseball bit
terness to the roaring acclaim of
62,465 frenzied fans as their 23-year
old southpaw shut out the mighty
Yankees with eight scattered hits.
It was a pulsating performance by
the kid from Witherbee, N. Y., as
he scored his second victory of the
classic and pinned the defeat on
favored Tommy Byrne. He had all
kinds of bad breaks, but gamely he
tightened his lips and mowed the
Yankees down the hard way—in
the yawning vastness of Yankee
Stadium, where the Bombers seldom
are beaten in a big one.
Rangy Gil Hodges, a patsy in the
past when he went hitless for 21
trips in 1952, drove in those two
runs that the oft-aching Johnny
needed.
Little Sandy Amoros made a des
perate running catch in the threat
ening Yankee sixth and turned it
into a double play that derricked
Johnny out of trouble.
FURILLO HOLDS RUN
Carl Furillo, the "arm" of Brook
lyn, raced in for a seventh-inning
catch and then—on the threat of his
throwing reputation and a rifle-like
heave to the plate—held a potential
run on third.
Young Johnny took it from there.
He fanned the menacing Hank
Bauer to close out the eighth, and
then, with the pressure riding high
on every pitch, sent those Bombers
down in order in the heart-choking
final inning to give the hilarious
Dodgers their first Series —and their
first win over a Yankee team, which
had beaten them five times previ
ously in the classic.
The Dodger triumph marked the
first time in World Series history
that a club which had lost the first
two of a seven-game series ever
came back to win the championship.
It also represented the first time the
National league had won the classic
two straight years since 1933 and
1934, when the Giants and the Cardi
nals did it.

Johnny was in trouble often, this
warm and sunny day, but never once
did he lose that bulldog courage
which finally carried the Dodgers to
the end of a long trail of heart
break.
As early as the second inning, the
Yanks were looking down his throat
when, with two out, burly Bill Skow
ron—who hit a big home run in the
equalizing sixth game—sliced a hit
to right field, which bounced into
the stands for a ground-rule double.
Podres got out of that one when
Bob Cerv grounded out to end the
inning.
BUMS' FIRST RUN
Brooklyn came up with its first
run in the fourth when, with one
away, pudgy Roy Campanella dou
bled down the left field line for the
first hit off the cagey Byrne. Fu
rillo grounded out, but Campy trun
dled down to third on the play. Then
it was Hodges who stepped in—the
man who couldn't buy a hit in that
losing 1952 series to these same Yan
kees—and big Gil slashed' a single
which sent Campanella across the
plate.
The blond Podres was in trouble
again as the Yankees came up in
the fourth when Yogi Berra got a
"gift" double to center. It was a
high, soaring shot, and Junior Gil
liam and Duke Snider —both racing
for the ball—did an Alphonse-Gas
ton as the ball dropped safely be
tween them.
But Johnny held them off.
Bauer lined to Furillo, and Berra
reached third as Skowron grounded
out. But Johnny fed a pop-up ball
to Cerv and went to the dugout with
his shutout still safe.

The blond Podres was in trouble
again as the Yankees came up in

NEW YORK, Oct. 4 (UP)—Brooklyn's Dodgers of Destiny per
formed the "impossible" today when "Hard-Luck Johnny" Podres
oitched them to their long-awaited first world championship by
beating the New York Yankees, 2-0, in the now-or-never seventh
Series game.
Beaten in seven previous heart-breaking attempts to win the

World Series, the determined Dodg
ers ended 55 years of baseball bit
terness to the roaring acclaim of
62,465 frenzied fans as their 23-year
old southpaw shut out the mighty
Yankees with eight scattered hits.
It was a pulsating performance by
the kid from Witherbee, N. Y., as
he scored his second victory of the
classic and pinned the defeat on
favored Tommy Byrne. He had all
kinds of bad breaks, but gamely he
tightened his lips and mowed the
Yankees down the hard way—in
the yawning vastness of Yankee
Stadium, where the Bombers seldom
are beaten in a big one.
Rangy Gil Hodges, a patsy in the
past when he went hitless for 21
trips in 1952, drove in those two
runs that the oft-aching Johnny
needed.
Little Sandy Amoros made a des
perate running catch in the threat
ening Yankee sixth and turned it
into a double play that derricked
Johnny out of trouble.
FURILLO HOLDS RUN
Carl Furillo, the "arm" of Brook
lyn, raced in for a seventh-inning
catch and then—on the threat of his
throwing reputation and a rifle-like
heave to the plate—held a potential
run on third.
Young Johnny took it from there.
He fanned the menacing Hank
Bauer to close out the eighth, and
then, with the pressure riding high
on every pitch, sent those Bombers
down in order in the heart-choking
final inning to give the hilarious
Dodgers their first Series —and their
first win over a Yankee team, which
had beaten them five times previ
ously in the classic.
The Dodger triumph marked the
first time in World Series history
that a club which had lost the first
two of a seven-game series ever
came back to win the championship.
It also represented the first time the
National league had won the classic
two straight years since 1933 and
1934, when the Giants and the Cardi
nals did it.

Johnny was in trouble often, this
warm and sunny day, but never once
did he lose that bulldog courage
which finally carried the Dodgers to
the end of a long trail of heart
break.
As early as the second inning, the
Yanks were looking down his throat
when, with two out, burly Bill Skow
ron—who hit a big home run in the
equalizing sixth game—sliced a hit
to right field, which bounced into
the stands for a ground-rule double.
Podres got out of that one when
Bob Cerv grounded out to end the
inning.
BUMS' FIRST RUN
Brooklyn came up with its first
run in the fourth when, with one
away, pudgy Roy Campanella dou
bled down the left field line for the
first hit off the cagey Byrne. Fu
