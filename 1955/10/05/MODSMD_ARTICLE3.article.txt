# Stanford Professor Is Consultant On New French Linear Accelerator
## 
### 
Professor Marvin Chodorow of Stanford University's Microwave
Laboratory is serving as consultant for the construction of a giant
electron linear accelerator at the University of Paris.
The Stanford scientist is noted for his part in developing, at
Stanford, the world's most powerful vacuum tubes, the super-

I klystrons which supply energy to
j Stanford's accelerator.
The Parisian atom smasher will
| be •hodeled after Stanford's 220-
! foot accelerator, and will have the
j same potential energy of one billion
volts.
Professor Chodorow will spend the
1955-56 academic year in Paris on
sabbatical leave from the Univer
sity. He was accompanied to Paris
by Mrs. Chodorow and their two
daughters.
