# Sam McDonald Confined to Hospital, His Condition Described as ‘Good’
## 
### 
Emmanuel McDonald—unofficial grandfather to the children of
the Stanford Convalescent Home and retired University groundskeeper
—is confined to the Palo Alto Hispital.
McDonald, better known as Sam, was admitted to the hospital on
Aug. 25 with an ulcerated ankle. His condition is described as "good."
The Stanford University Press recently published his book "Sam
McDonald's Farm," an autobiography and collection of reminiscences
of other Stanford personalities.
He is perhaps best known to the students for his "Sam McDonald
Barbecue," at the annual Con Home work day. He has personally
presided at the huge affair for years.
Date of his release from the hospital is not yet known.
