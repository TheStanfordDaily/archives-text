## Faure Risking All in Dispute on Morocco, Replaces Ousted Sultan with Throne Council 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 4 (UP) —Premier
Edgar Faure today ordered the
immediate formation of a throne
council to replace the ousted
sultan of Morocco In a move that
touched off a walkout threat by
Gaullist members of his totter
ing cabinet.
The harried premier was risking
a fall of his government as the Na
tional Assembly reconvened after a
summer recess. It faced problems
that included the new terrorist war
fare in Morocco and the French
walkout from the United Nations.
Faure instructed the French resi
dent general in Morocco, Pierre
Boyer de Latour, to proceed with
the formation of a three-man throne
council—as originally envisaged in
his reform program for the troubled
protectorate.
WARFARE SPREADS
In northwestern Morocco today
guerrilla warfare between French
troops and ferocious native warriors
spread like a .bush fire.
The French forces battled on two
fronts — against black - uniformed
Berbers along the frontier opposite
Spanish Morocco and against robed
tribesmen in the hills near Fez, the
Moslem holy city.
Resident General de Latour, who
has been fighting for and against
Moroccans for 40 years, left Casa
blanca for Fez, whose hinterlands
to the north and south have been
turned into battle grounds.
DE LATOIJK TO COMMAND
Observers said de Latour might
take personal command of the puni
tive forces.
To the south of the holy Moslem
city, Foreign Legionnaires, backed
by tanks and Vampire jets, were
reported in uneasy control after two
days of murder, arson and pillage.
The situation was more critical in
the north. Three French outposts
near the border of Spanish Morocco
were under almost constant attack.
The rebels assaulted a fourth out
post, but were beaten back and did
not try again.


FAURE FACES CRlSlS—Premier Edgar Faure (loft), shown talk
ing to newsmen, has followed through on his plan for Morocco
by ordering the formation of a throne council for the country.
Right-wing cabinet members has warned Faure that they would
resign if the plan were carried through.
