member schools form the official
voting body of approximately 600,
but participation in the congress is
not limited to delegates.
Student leaders, in addition to
delegates, from both member and
non-member schools, foreign stu
dents studying in the U.S., and rep
resentatives from foreign student
organizations joined in the activities
of the congress to bring the total
number of participants to nearly
900.
The congress was held from Aug.
21 to 31. Associated with the activi
ties were two pre-congress gather
ings, one of student body presidents
and the other of foreign student
leaders studying in the U.S.

George Ralph, ASSU president,
represented Stanford in the Student
Body President Conference, and Er

posed of the association staff officers
and regional presidents. A 1 Wilson
of Stanford, being president of the
California - Nevada - Hawaii region,
was a member of this group.
STANFORD DELEGATES
Tlie six voting delegates from

dent activities, such as the student
press, college unions, student-fac

Sub-commission discussions cen
ter around questions outlined in the

congress working papers, and often

resolutions to be brought up for
consideration in commission meet
ings.

fields of student interest: student
government, educational affairs, stu-
affairs, and international af
fairs. Resolutions initiated in sub
commissions are discussed in the

then presented for inclusion on the
agenda of the plenary sessions.

relations, and the McCarran Act.

Gene Preston, UCLA: vice - presi
dent, student government, is Ray
Farabee; and vice-president, inter

Eleven representatives from
Stanford were among the nearly
900 students who gathered at
the University of Minnesota at

the coming year. Delegates from
member schools form the official
voting body of approximately 600,
but participation in the congress is
not limited to delegates.
Student leaders, in addition to
delegates, from both member and
non-member schools, foreign stu
dents studying in the U.S., and rep
resentatives from foreign student
organizations joined in the activities
of the congress to bring the total
number of participants to nearly
900.
The congress was held from Aug.
21 to 31. Associated with the activi
ties were two pre-congress gather
ings, one of student body presidents
and the other of foreign student
leaders studying in the U.S.
RALPH ATTENDED
George Ralph, ASSU president,
represented Stanford in the Student
Body President Conference, and Er

eign Student Leader Conference.
Steering committee for the con
gress while in session is the NSA

posed of the association staff officers
and regional presidents. A 1 Wilson
of Stanford, being president of the
California - Nevada - Hawaii region,
was a member of this group.
STANFORD DELEGATES
Tlie six voting delegates from

The work of the congress begins
in the sub-commissions, composed
of a small group of students inter

campus international programs.
Sub-commission discussions cen

resolutions to be brought up for
consideration in commission meet
ings.
The four commissions cover broad
fields of student interest: student
government, educational affairs, stu-
affairs, and international af
fairs. Resolutions initiated in sub
commissions are discussed in the
