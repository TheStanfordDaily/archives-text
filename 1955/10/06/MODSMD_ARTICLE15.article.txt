FEZ. Morocco, Oct. 5 (U.R)—French
troops punched through the road to
Boured today and claimed initial
victory in the Riff mountain war
against rebeling Berber tribesmen.
Gen. Henri Bertron announced the
road had been cleared after Foreign
Legionnaires from the burned-out
post of Boured linked up with an
armored column of red-capped Spa
his from the main French opera
tional base of Aknoul.
Shortly after the legionnaires had
joined with the Spahis, white flags
floated over some villages along the
road to Boured. French authorities
said that one village already has
asked for pardon for its part in the
rebellion.
Three soldiers were killed and
nine wounded in today's operation,
bringing to at least 27 the number
of European soldiers and civilians
killed since the rebellion began last
Saturday night.
The break-through to the Boured
road came shortly after wild tribes
men recaptured the Nador Pass, key
to the northern defense triangle.
