## 
### 
(IKNEVAâ€”The United States re
newed demands on Communist
China today for the release of a
score of illegally-held American ci
vilians ;ind for information about
nearly 500 U. S. servicemen missing
in Korea.

i Informed sources said U. S. Am
bassador U. Alexis Johnson told the
Communist negotiator, Wang Ping
nan, that he will not even discuss
concessions demanded by the Reds
until the prisoner issue is settled.
So far, the Reds have rejected
every question about the 470 soldiers
and 11 Coast Guard airmen missing
in Korea. There appeared to be no
reason to expect them to change
their stand.
