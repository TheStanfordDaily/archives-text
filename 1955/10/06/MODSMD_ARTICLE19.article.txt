# President's Recovery Continues Unhindered
## 
### 
DENVERâ€”Fitzsimons Army Hos
pital bulletins today continued to
report satisfactory progress in Presi
dent Eisenhower's recovery from his
Sept. 24 heart attack.
Until yesterday, the President's
sickroom recreation had been de
cidedly on the subdued side. Today
he filled the hospital room with
laughter when he opened a gift box
of bubble gum from his three grand
children.
The President was well enough to
consult with Presidential Assistant
Sherman Adams for about 10 min
utes. The President signed four re
cess appointments and approved two
routine administrative documents.
