# Over 1,000 See 'Farm Follies' In Dew-Bedecked Amphitheater
## 
### JACK BYRNE 
Over a thousand students, faculty members, and interested
| spectators braved a chilly evening on the dewy terraces of Frost
, Amphitheater last night for the second annual "Farm Follies."
Co-masters of ceremonies Hart Sprager and Dean Winbigler
opened the revue with a cross-talk act in the finest vaudeville tra-

dition, and called upon the audience
for community singing of "I've Been
Working on the Railroad" . . . hon
oring the Stanford founding of the
Central Pacific and Southern Pacific
railways.
Professor of Chemistry and Reg
istrar Emeritus J. Pearce Mitchell,
who came to Stanford as a freshman
in the fall of 1899, recounted the
days of the Farm when it was a farm.
FIRST CAMPUS AUTO
Mitchell recalled that Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur, who later became pres
ident of the University, had the first
automobile on campus.
"It was one you cranked from the
side, not the front," Mitchell remi
nisced. "Mrs. Stanford banned cars

on the campus, so he had to leave it
parked at the gate and walk out to
campus. Later she allowed him to
drive to the Post Office, where hi.,
home was, but he had to go around
the back way to Mayfield" (now
South Palo Alto).
ASSU President George Ralph de
livered Marc Antony's funeral ora
tion, a la Marlon Brando . . . Brando
in "Wild One" costume.
"Brutus said Caesar was out of
it . . ." intoned Antony. "And Bru
tus is a real-gone daddy-o."
COMIC PRAYER
Charles Lyons amused the crowd
with his comic rendition of a dubi
ous pr»yer for "Auntie's face to
fall," followed by a vague story
concerning "A Debutante and Two
Horses." Kathy Franger of the
Stanford Reseai-ch Institute favored
the audience with Cole Porter's
ever-popular "So in Love," from
"Kiss Me, Kate."
Roberta Grant, a sophomore from
Union, sang "C'est si bon" and
"Waiting for My Dearie" from
"Brigadoon." Bill Lackey, a junior,
sang the old Scotch "Lord Randall,"
and an old folk ballad about the
birds and bees.
Bill Pratt, representing the SIM
Staff agaip, took up his guitar for
"Cool Water" and Tom Lehar's
"Song of the Wild West." Walt Pe
terson, of the University's Public
Relations Department, lived up to
his advance booking of telling "clean
stories," and, as tradition demands,
rendered a story of a Scotsman and
Two Famous Irishman, Pat and
Mike.
MEXICAN DISC-JOCKEY
Stuart Hyde, instructor in speech
and drama, gave one of his inimi
table pcirtrayals of "Dad Rango,"
defiler of the kilocycles from Ti■ • -
juana. Hyde, whose routine still
convulses crowds the third time they
hear it, was one of the joint plan
ners of the student-faculty presen
tation.
