# the
						first meeting
## 
### 
One of the main features of the new consti
tution goes into effect tonight. The ASSU Cab
inet meets for the first time.
The revised constitution which was ap
proved by a student referendum last spring
provided for a Cabinet to co-ordinate student
activities and serve as an advisory executive
body for the ASSU president.
The Cabinet will include the chairmen of
numerous administrative boards- —like the lIR,
Ham's Head, NSA, Publications Board—the un
dergraduate class presidents, a graduate repre
sentative, and the ASSU president and vice
president. There are also ex officio members
from the fraternities, the eating clubs,' Men's
arid Women's Councils, and The Daily, as well
as the administrative assistant to the president
and the student financial manager.
This group of students will sit down in Bow
man Alumni House tonight at 0 to hear brief

reports on the activities for the guarter of each
group represented. The Cabinet will also dis
cuss matters which it thinks should be brought
before the Legislature.
Just what authority and responsibility the
Cabinet will have in student government will
have to be worked out through trial and error.
As originally visioned, the Cabinet would have
been the "take charge" element in the ASSU—
on the theory that people with many years'
experience in student activities and proven
abilities in certain fields would be valuable
leaders among a Legislative body elected on
popularity.
The constitution, as agreed upon by last
year's Executive Committee, gives the Cabinet
no official function. It becomes a bulky advi
sory committee —with no effective powers. If
the Cabinet becomes useful, it will have to be
of its own doing. Tonight's meeting should
provide an important clue.
