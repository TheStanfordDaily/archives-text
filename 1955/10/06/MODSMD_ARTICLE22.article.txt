three corrections
To the Editor:
As a member of the Stanford law faculty who sat
in on the press interview with L. R. Sivasubramanian,
Dean of the Delhi University law school, I would rate
'1 he Daily's story of yesterday as interesting and in
formative, but I should like to make three corrections.
1. The Dean was quoted as saying that he was
helping through legal education to create a "moral
India." What he actually referred to was a "modern
India."
2. The story states, "Although New Delhi is a
Hindu university, members of all religions are ad
mitted." Delhi (not New Delhi, which is a separate
municipality) University is a secular institution. The
Dean in this reference was speaking of the Benares
Hindu University, where he had been on the Law
Faculty for 20 years before being appointed to his
present post at Delhi University in 1947.
3. The story stated that prior to Indian independ
ence the English required explanations from students
as to why they wanted to study law. My understand
ing of the Dean's remarks is that Indian law schools
were always open generally to Indian students, but
that during the British rule, the Government did not
encourage its civil servants to take legal studies in
India.
I trust you will agree that these points arc very
important to our distinguished visitor and that the
record can be set straight.

king solomon's next
To the Editor:
Unfortunately the freshman women who have ex
pressed themselves so immaturely in the Oct. 3 issue
of The Stanford Daily ate going to be much more
vipset as the school year progresses.
They will be asked to read in Western Civ about
King Solomon's "voracious sexual appetite" and will
meet up with Mr. Voltaire's "Candide." But the real
blow will come to these high schoolers when they
innocently buy their first Chappie.
So hail to the three freshman girls who have more
mature Stanford minds than their classmates! And
down with those who find Jim Walters (that nice
young man) crude and vulgar. He is doing a great job
and we should support him.

adult thinking
To the Editor:
I wonder if anyone else is getting as tired as I am
of seeing letters criticizing the four freshman girls
written by people who evidently don't have enough
courage of their convictions to sign their letters?
Certainly the "answer to four girls, plus two" in the
Oct. 5 Daily reached a new low by insinuating that the
four frosh girls aren't "mature enough" for Stanford
because they didn't see the humor in the filthy jokes
at the rally. If this is the case, then I doubt if very
many of us ARE "ready for Stanford."
It seems that the only really mature attitude demon
strated by anyone during this whole hassle was shown
by the four girls. They realized that the jokes told
at the rally were out of place, unnecessary, and very
off-color, and they had the courage to write a SIGNED
letter about it. By their attempt to correct (or at least
point out) an improper situation, they have proved
themselves to be mature women capable of adult
thinking and action, not merely anonymous letter
writers who stand in defense of filth!

high school carry-over
To the Editor:
For the benefit of the three little freshman girls
who enjoyed Friday evening's jokes—the four women
who wrote Monday's letter were fully justified in be-

ing opposed to vulgarity at a public University func
tion. The way to see such a situation as this improved
is not, as you suggest, to ignore it; but to speak
about it.
If everyone seeking improvement is to be labeled
derogatorily as "fame - seeking" by worldly - wise
freshman girls, we may never see anything achieved.
It is merely a carry-over of a high school attitude
to think that everything the big University yell leader
says is very funny. Some things are revolting. 1 hope
that in your four years here you learn the difference.

common decency
To the Editor:
We should like to know when toleration of vul
garity became a criterion for maturity. The exhibi
tion of distaste for Friday night's display shows nei
ther naiveie. childishness, nor a search for fame,
but rather, common decency. It would be
apathy to accept obvious vulgarity on the part of
Stanford's representatives as something which ought
to be tolerated. Why should sincere interest be la
beled immature?

porous logic
To the Editor:
I have just finished reading the letter to The Daily
of Oct. 4 which was written by "three freshman girls."
I feel compelled to answer their charges.
These three girls, in a plea for adult thinking, have
used rather porous logic. First they express the opin
ion that an adult mind must accept things as they
are or ignore them if they are not self-pleasing. If
the English Colonists of 179 years ago had been gul
lible enough to follow this line of thinking, there
would have been no American Revolution. For that
matter, our whole concept of freedom of speech is
based on what the three frosh girls seem to think is
childish reasoning.
Second, our three adult crusaders state that "pru
dishness" is strictly high school stuff. By this we
must assume that vulgarity is college level entertain
ment. To carry this argument to its logical conclu
sion, we could suppose that downright filth would be
appropriate fare for an oral exam for a Ph.D. candi
date. Let's set the record straight. There is a time
and olace for off-color humor. We get plenty of it
in the freshman dorm and nobody seems to object
strenuously. But such jokes in a football rally (to
which they add nothing) are definitely out of place.
If they were eliminated from the rally, they would
never be missed.
Friday night's football rally was a big success in
almost all respects. It's too bad it had to be spoiled
by off-color jokes and wisecracks. I, for one (and I
do not stand alone), hope that this situation will be
remedied.
VICTOR R. LA VIS
who is naive?
To the Editor:
Could it be that the committee members and upper
classmen who call the four coeds naive for objecting
to off-color stories at the rally are the truly naive
ones—naive to believe that they can fool God by ap
proving of such action? They will not learn, how
ever, about that from their instructors at school.
Someday they too will perhaps have daughters, and
would be proud of them for having the gumption to
call right right in His eyes, just as these coeds have
done.
Isn't it a shame that college breaks down ideals
such as these, rather than praise them?

ters on Friday's rally—unless new views are pre
sented. It will he Daily policy not to belabor points
in "Campus Opinion! 'which have been adequately
voiced.)
