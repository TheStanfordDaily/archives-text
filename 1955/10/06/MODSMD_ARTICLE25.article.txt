# HELP!
## Roble Frosh Perplexed By Pre-Reg Problems 
### ANNE JOHNSON 
"Someone come help me â€” I'm
locked in my closet!"
A freshman girl tearfully let out '
this wail last week at Roble. Final- |
ly rescued alter facing the fate of
suffocation for half an hour, her ex
perience was added to many col- j
lected during Pre-Reg week by new j
Roble women.
'"Brunch" brought a stampede to
the Cellar last Sunday morning,
when a large group came .downstairs
for that meal, only to find that it j
wasn't being served until the start
of classes. "And when classes start, j
who can go to brunch?" was the
perplexed comment.
The large group of men on cam
pus brought its problems, too.
Consider the plight of the brunette
who came home from the Jolly-Up j
to announce, "Four different guys

asked me to the Reg dance, and I
don't know any of their names." Or
the girl who sat in her room for over
an hour waiting for the freshman
who didn't know he was to have her
room buzzed.
Then, there were those who re
fused to go out at all because they
were afraid to use up any late leaves.
As the week progressed, a new
word began to be used. Perhaps not
a traditional Stanford term, but
"sheep" was applied by some Roble
girls to the little groups of guys and
the little groups of gals who marched
toward each other, said, "Hi," and
paired off.
Sponsors also became involved.
One woke up to find luggage from
her entire corridor piled against her
door. At 1 o'clock in the morning,
it had seemed like a very amusing
idea.
