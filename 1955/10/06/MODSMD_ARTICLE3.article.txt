# Rhodes Interviews To Be Held Today
## 
### 
Dean Carl B. Spaeth of the Grad
uate School of Law will interview
Stanford applicants for Rhodes
Scholarships today and tomorrow at
the Law School. Under these schol
arships, scholars-elect will enter Ox
ford University in October, 1956.
The value of the scholarship is
Â£600, or approximately $1,700. Those
who qualify under the GI Bill or
other military educational assistance
programs can expect to receive the
same benefits at Oxford.
Initial appointments are made for
two years under the Rhodes pro
gram. If, during his second year at
Oxford, a student decides he wishes
to remain for a third year, he will
be able to apply for extension only
if he can show that a third year is
eminently in the interests of his
immediate studies and his future
career.
To be eligible, a candidate must
be a male citizen of the United
States, unmarried, and with live
years' residence in this country. He
must be between the ages of 19 and
25 years, unless he has been on
active military service for 90 days
or more. Finally, he must have at
least junior standing in the Univer
sity.
