ANYONE FOR FOOTBALL?

Pancho Sigafoos, pale and sensitive, first saw Willa Ludovic,
iithe as a hazel wand and fair as the morn, outside a class in
money and banking. "Let us not hem and haw," said Pancho to
Willa. "1 adore you."
"Thanks, hey," said Willa, blushing prettily. "What nnsition
io you play?"
"Position?" said Pancho, looking at her askance. (The askance
is a ligament just behind the ear.)

'On the football team," £aid Willa.
"Football!" cried Pancho, his lip curling in horror. "Football
is violence, and violence is the death of the mind. 1 am not a
football player. I am a poet."
"So long, mac," said Willa.
"Wait!" cried Pancho, clutching her lissome young forearm.
She placed her foot on his pelvis and wrenched herself free.
"I only go with football players," she said and walked, shim
mering, into the setting sun.
Pancho went to his room and lit a cigarette and pondered his
vexing problem. What kind of cigarette did Pancho light? Why,
Philip Morris, of corris!
Philip Morris is always welcome, but never more than when
you are weary and sore beset. When a fellow needs a friend,
when the heart is dull and the blood runs like sorghum, when
darkness prevails, then, then above all, is the time for the mild
ness and gentleness that only Philip Morris can provide.
Pancho Sigafoos, his broken psyche welded, his fevered brow
cooled, his synapses restored after smoking a gentle Philip
Morris, came swiftly to a decision. Though he was rather small
for football (an even four feet) and somewhat overweight (370
pounds) he tried out for the team—and tried out with such pluck
and perseverance that he made it.
Pancho's college opened the season against the Manhattan
School of Mines. The Miners were always a mettlesome foe, but
this year, strengthened by four exchange students from Gi
braltar who had been suckled by she-apes, they were especially
formidable. By the middle of the second quarter, the Miners had
wrought such havoc upon Pancho's team that there was nobody
left on the bench but Pancho. And when the quarterback was
sent to the infirmary with his head driven into his ribcage, the
;oach had no choice but to put Pancho in.
Pancho's team-mates were not conspicuously cheered as the
little fellow took his place in the huddle. "Gentlemen," said
Pancho, "some of you may regard poetry as sissy stuff, but
now in our most trying hour I can think of no words more apt
than these lines from Milton's Paradise Lost: 'All is not lost;
thd unconquerable will and study of revenge, immortal hate, and
courage never to submit or yield!' "
So stirred was Pancho's team by this fiery exhortation that
they threw themselves into the fray with utter abandon.
As a consequence, the entire squad was hospitalized before
the half. The college was forced to drop football. Willa Ludovic,
not having any football players to choose from, took up with
Pancho and soon discovered the beauty of his soul. Today they
are seen everywhere together—dancing, holding hands, smok
ing, smooching.
Smoking what? Why, Philip Morris, of corris!

"I only go with football players," she said and walked, shim
mering, into the setting sun.
Pancho went to his room and lit a cigarette and pondered his
vexing problem. What kind of cigarette did Pancho light? Why,
Philip Morris, of corris!
Philip Morris is always welcome, but never more than when
you are weary and sore beset. When a fellow needs a friend,
when the heart is dull and the blood runs like sorghum, when
darkness prevails, then, then above all, is the time for the mild
ness and gentleness that only Philip Morris can provide.
Pancho Sigafoos, his broken psyche welded, his fevered brow
cooled, his synapses restored after smoking a gentle Philip
Morris, came swiftly to a decision. Though he was rather small
for football (an even four feet) and somewhat overweight (370
pounds) he tried out for the team—and tried out with such pluck
and perseverance that he made it.
Pancho's college opened the season against the Manhattan
School of Mines. The Miners were always a mettlesome foe, but
this year, strengthened by four exchange students from Gi
braltar who had been suckled by she-apes, they were especially
formidable. By the middle of the second quarter, the Miners had
wrought such havoc upon Pancho's team that there was nobody
left on the bench but Pancho. And when the quarterback was
sent to the infirmary with his head driven into his ribcage, the
;oach had no choice but to put Pancho in.
Pancho's team-mates were not conspicuously cheered as the
little fellow took his place in the huddle. "Gentlemen," said
Pancho, "some of you may regard poetry as sissy stuff, but
now in our most trying hour I can think of no words more apt
than these lines from Milton's Paradise Lost: 'All is not lost;
thd unconquerable will and study of revenge, immortal hate, and
courage never to submit or yield!' "
So stirred was Pancho's team by this fiery exhortation that
they threw themselves into the fray with utter abandon.
As a consequence, the entire squad was hospitalized before
the half. The college was forced to drop football. Willa Ludovic,
not having any football players to choose from, took up with
Pancho and soon discovered the beauty of his soul. Today they
are seen everywhere together—dancing, holding hands, smok
ing, smooching.
Smoking what? Why, Philip Morris, of corris!

ANYONE FOR FOOTBALL?

Pancho Sigafoos, pale and sensitive, first saw Willa Ludovic,
iithe as a hazel wand and fair as the morn, outside a class in
money and banking. "Let us not hem and haw," said Pancho to
Willa. "1 adore you."
"Thanks, hey," said Willa, blushing prettily. "What nnsition
io you play?"
"Position?" said Pancho, looking at her askance. (The askance
is a ligament just behind the ear.)

'On the football team," £aid Willa.
"Football!" cried Pancho, his lip curling in horror. "Football
is violence, and violence is the death of the mind. 1 am not a
football player. I am a poet."
"So long, mac," said Willa.
"Wait!" cried Pancho, clutching her lissome young forearm.
She placed her foot on his pelvis and wrenched herself free.
"I only go with football players," she said and walked, shim
mering, into the setting sun.
