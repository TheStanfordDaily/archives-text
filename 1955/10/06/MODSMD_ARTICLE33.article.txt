# Indians Drill for Spartans; Traveling Squad Named
## 
### 
Coach Chuck Taylor sent the
Indian football squad through
their final two-hour workout in
preparation for the Michigan
State game on Saturday. One
hour was spent on offense and
one hour on defense.
During the defensive drills, the
squad practiced stopping the Spar
tans' goal line plays and throwing
a monkey wrench into all phases of
the Michigan State multiple offense.
Ths last time Stanford faced the
Michigan State multiple-type offense
was in 1953 against Oregon Stat'-',
which used an identical system.
However, the Cards last year played
against the single-wing systems of
UCLA and Southern Cal, which are
somewhat similar to Michigan State's
offense.
