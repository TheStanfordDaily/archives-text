# Glee Club to Hold Freshman Tryouts
## 
### 
The Mon's Glee Club will hold
tryouts for freshmen this afternoon
from 4:15 to 5:30 in Woodpecker
Lodge.
Unlike the University Chorus and
the Choir, the Glee Club is not under
the supervision of the Music De
partment, but was organized last
year by a group of students. Almost
60 men from the sophomore class
alone have expressed their intention
of joining.
