# Village Rep Approved By LASSU
## 264 Undergrad Village Men Will Be Represented 
### DICK MEISTER 
Associate Editor, The Daily
ASSU Legislature last night
passed two motions designed
for better representation on the
body. The 264 undergraduate
men students at Stanford Village
now have the right to elect a
representative to the Legisla
ture.
In the other student representa
tion motion,- a "Toyon-Club" mem
ber, who would be elected to the
Legislature by the men at Toyon,
was approved. Eric Fricker, admin
istrative assistant, explained that, of
the 224 students living in Toyon
now, 200 of them are eating club
members. To this he added the fact
that eating club members who live
off-campus must vote for off-campus
j representation and have no real club
member representative in the Legis
lature. The new office of "Toyon
jCl u b" member, as approved by
LASSU, is to be elected by all the
men in Toyon, including the inde
-1 pendents.
There was debate on when this
new member should be elected, but
no agreement on the point was
reached.

lature approved:
(1) Hal John Hansen as business
manager of the new literary maga
zine.
