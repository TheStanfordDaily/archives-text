## Taylor Names Same Starters Who Defeated Strong Buckeye Eleven 
### LARRY JENSEN 
When Stanford meets Michigan State tomorrow at East Lansing,
Michigan, it will mark the first time that the two schools have ever
faced each other on the gridiron.
Fifteen times in the past, the Indians have played teams from
the Big Ten. In these contests, Stanford holds a creditable record

of seven wins, six losses, and two
ties.
The University of Chicago was the
first Bis Ten opponent that Stanford
ever met. That was way back on
Christmas Day of 1894 when the
Chicagoans beat the Cards, 24 to 4,
in San Francisco. The last Big Ten
opponent for Stanford was, of
course. Ohio State, which lost to
the Indians, 6-0, last Saturday. In
between these times, Stanford has
played Michigan, Minnesota, North
western, and Illinois.
Tomorrow's opponent, Michigan
State College, has an enrollment of
some 16,500. MSC's athletic teams
are called the Spartans and wear the
traditional green and white colors of
the school.
The site of tomorrow's game,
Macklin Field Stadium, was built in
10 48. With a capacity of nearly
51,000, it ranks as one of the largest
in the Midwest.
Michigan State, after World War
11, came into its own as a football
power. Under Coach Clarence "Big
gie" Munn, 1947-53, the Spartans
compiled an enviable record of 54
wins, nine losses, and two ties. Both
the 1951 and 1952 teams went unde
feated with the latter winning the
mythical national championship. In
1953 the Spartans tied for the con
ference title and went on to defeat
UCLA in the Rose Bowl.
Last year, under new head coach
Hugh "Duffy" Daugherty, the Spar
tans had only a 3-6 record, good for
a tie for eighth place in the Big
Ten.
This year, Daugherty is working
with 16 lettermen and a prize group
of sophomores. Three of the 1954
regulars are back. They are end
John Lewis, quarterback Earl Mor
rall, and fullback Gerry Planutis.

in San Francisco. The last Big Ten
opponent for Stanford was, of
course. Ohio State, which lost to
the Indians, 6-0, last Saturday. In
between these times, Stanford has
played Michigan, Minnesota, North
western, and Illinois.
Tomorrow's opponent, Michigan
State College, has an enrollment of
some 16,500. MSC's athletic teams
are called the Spartans and wear the
traditional green and white colors of
the school.
The site of tomorrow's game,
Macklin Field Stadium, was built in
10 48. With a capacity of nearly
51,000, it ranks as one of the largest
in the Midwest.
Michigan State, after World War
11, came into its own as a football
power. Under Coach Clarence "Big
gie" Munn, 1947-53, the Spartans
compiled an enviable record of 54
wins, nine losses, and two ties. Both
the 1951 and 1952 teams went unde
feated with the latter winning the
mythical national championship. In
1953 the Spartans tied for the con
ference title and went on to defeat
UCLA in the Rose Bowl.
Last year, under new head coach
Hugh "Duffy" Daugherty, the Spar
tans had only a 3-6 record, good for
a tie for eighth place in the Big
Ten.
This year, Daugherty is working
with 16 lettermen and a prize group
of sophomores. Three of the 1954
regulars are back. They are end
John Lewis, quarterback Earl Mor
rall, and fullback Gerry Planutis.
