### 
NEW CASTLE, Ind., Oct. 6
(UP) — Six hundred National
Guardsmen kept order at the
scene of a bloody strike riot to
day while negotiators bogged
down in their efforts to force a
truce.
Mayor Paul McCormack, who
called a gun battle between demon
strators and non-strikers at the Per
fect Circle Corp. plant yesterday
"the darkest day New Castle has had
since the 1917 tornado," announced
that the company and ClO-United
Auto Workers negotiators failed to
reach an agreement.
McCormack then extended the
"limited" martial law he invoked
early this morning when the Guards
men rolled into town with Sherman
tanks and halftracks and took up
positions at the foundry gates.
A strict curfew, roadblocks and
ban on sale of intoxicants were in
cluded in the mayor's order.

McCormack said he will keep the
i plant closed tomorrow to non-strik
ers who havfr kept production going
| on a partial basis during the strike,
j because "if I let them in we could
[ lose a degree of the peaceful situa
■ tion we have today, even with
| Guardsmen on the scene."
Union spokesmen made veiled
j threats during the negotiating ses
sions that they could not be respon
j >ible for what might happen if the
! plant, which state troopers closed
: shortly after the riot, were reopened.
No further meetings were sched
uled, but McCormack said, "I'm go
ing to keep trying to get these peo
! pie together—it's the only way we'll
| ever get this thing settled."
