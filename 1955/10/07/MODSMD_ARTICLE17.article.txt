## Athletic Ability Of Applicants Considered In Their Selection 
### RIC TEAGUE 
Vince Jones and Robert Anthony,
two second-year law students, are
living testimonials to the Rhodes
Scholarship program.
Jones left Stanford in 1953 to study
at Oxford University for two years
as a Rhodes scholar. Anthony went
to Oxford from Yale. Neither feels
that the benefits of the program can
be exaggerated.
Jones speaks of his two years at
Oxford as a "marvelous experience—
one of the highlights of my educa
tional experience, because the two
years provided so many unique ex
periences." Anthony. concurring,
said, "Yes. I'd agree with that," then
added carefully, "at least to date."
Athletic ability, as well as educa
tional achievements, is something
the Rhodes Selection Committees
look for, and Jones didn't disappoint
them. He is one of the very few
Americans to have ever made the
Oxford varsity rugby team.
"Not only that," Anthony broke
in, "but he once swam the Bos
porus." "It wasn't really anything."
said Jones; "I just happened to bo
in Istanbul without anything to do,
,-0 I decided to swim across." An
thony had to explain for the modest
Jones that the latter "just happened"
to be in Istanbul as a member of a
touring basketball team.
About their stay in the English
university, Anthony said that "Ox
ford is a wonderful place. Not only
do you meet really fine people from
England and the Commonwealth but
also one of the swellest groups of
Americans you'll find anywhere."
Jones nodded agreement and said
that "Oxford is so cosmopolitan that

i they take anybody as he is." An
thony commented that "an Ameri
| can, surprisingly enough, finds him
| relf very much at home in England.
The people arc at first a little re
served. but they soon become very
j friendly and you feel l ight away
I that you can trust them
Anthonv, who is at Stanford for
I the first time, was stiuck by "the
' air of ease and friendship that is

hard to m;>tch anywhere else in the
world." Jones said that Oxford life
i.s casual "in its own way, and Stan
ford is casual in another. Both places
are very friendly."
Jones, who lives at 220 Crothers.
and Anthony, 11(5 Crothers, offered
to help any of Stanford's Rhodes
Scholarship applicants in any way
thai they can. tell them to
give us a call."

A RUGGED RHODES—Vince Jones (light) is back at Stanford
after two years of rugby (and study) as a Rhodes Scholar at Ox
ford University. With him is Robert Anthony, who did his under
graduate work at Yale, a Rhodes classmate of Jones' at the Eng
lish university.
Vince Jones and Robert Anthony,
two second-year law students, are
living testimonials to the Rhodes
Scholarship program.
Jones left Stanford in 1953 to study
at Oxford University for two years
as a Rhodes scholar. Anthony went
to Oxford from Yale. Neither feels
that the benefits of the program can
be exaggerated.
Jones speaks of his two years at
Oxford as a "marvelous experience—
one of the highlights of my educa
tional experience, because the two
years provided so many unique ex
periences." Anthony. concurring,
said, "Yes. I'd agree with that," then
added carefully, "at least to date."
Athletic ability, as well as educa
tional achievements, is something
the Rhodes Selection Committees
look for, and Jones didn't disappoint
them. He is one of the very few
Americans to have ever made the
Oxford varsity rugby team.
"Not only that," Anthony broke
in, "but he once swam the Bos
porus." "It wasn't really anything."
said Jones; "I just happened to bo
in Istanbul without anything to do,
,-0 I decided to swim across." An
thony had to explain for the modest
Jones that the latter "just happened"
to be in Istanbul as a member of a
touring basketball team.
About their stay in the English
university, Anthony said that "Ox
ford is a wonderful place. Not only
do you meet really fine people from
England and the Commonwealth but
also one of the swellest groups of
Americans you'll find anywhere."
