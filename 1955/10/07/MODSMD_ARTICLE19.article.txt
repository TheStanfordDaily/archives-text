Dr. Edwin L. Zebroski, manager
of nuclear engineering at the Stan
ford Research Institute, said yester
day in a talk at Richmond, Calif.,
that peaceful atomic development
will have its first important effect
"in fields related to atomic power
such as radiation applications in
chemical process and food indus
tries."
Dr. Zebroski predicted that atomic
power will cause large-scale changes
in the patterns of personal living
and industry. He told his audience
at an "Atoms for Peace" show that
there are now some 60 operating
nuclear reactors in the United States
with another 30 under construction,
and that it seems likely that nuclear
propelled aircraft will be in opera
tion within the next five to 10 years.
