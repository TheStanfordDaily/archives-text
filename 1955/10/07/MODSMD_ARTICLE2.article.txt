# First Cabinet Doesn't Know What to Do
## 
### 
The ASSU Cabinet—sot up last j
spring by the new constitution —met J
for the first time last night and re
mained at a loss as to about what |
its powers and obligations are.
The group decided to meet at least !
once more this quarter.
Probably the most important item
considered by the Cabinet was a
discussion of what the Cabinet's j
functions should be. No one seemed
sure. The body did feel that it could
make recommendations to the Legis- j
lature, but the membership did not
feel that it should investigate any j
problems.
The Cabinet did urge the Legisla
ture to give serious consideration
to publishing an activities handbook
prepared by the Axe Society. The
Cabinet was of the opinion that a j
book describing all the activities, |
groups, honorary societies and other
campus organizations was desirable.
The Cabinet also discussed the tie- |
mendous pressures placed on the
freshmen in the first couple of weeks
of fall quarter, the lost-and-found j
situation on campus, and the lack of i
class representation on the Legisla
ture.
ASSU President George Ralph
presided. Attending were the under
graduate class presidents, a gradu- j
ate representative, representatives of
the various administrative boards,
the administrative assistant to the
president, and the student manager. |
