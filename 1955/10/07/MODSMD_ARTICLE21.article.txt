# Car Caravan To Greet Team At Airport
## 
### 
"It's never been done before" is
all the more reason why Rally Com
is hoping that the Car Caravan,
from Stanford to the International
Airport for the purpose of meeting
the football team as it returns home
from Michigan State tomorrow, will
have the full support of Stanford
students.
In the past, Rally Com and yell
leaders have been on hand to meet
the team, but never has there been
a student group present. Besides a
band, the Caravan planners have
also made arrangements to have the
Pompon girls there.
The Caravan will leave the Post
Office at 3:30 tomorrow afternoon
to arrive at the San Francisco air
port by 4:30, the scheduled time for
the team plane's arrival. All stu
dents with cars have been asked to
bring them, and those not having a
way over are assured of getting a
ride by Jim Walters, head yell
leader.
"Win, lose, or draw at Michigan
State, this is a good way for the stu
dent body to show our team we're
behind them all the way," Walters
said.
