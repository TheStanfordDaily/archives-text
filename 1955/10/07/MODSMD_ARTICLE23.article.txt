This fall, nine foreign students arrived at
S'.anford under the Associated Students of
Stanford University scholarship program.
They came from countries ranging from
Scotland to Morocco and Norway to Australia.
They came to study political science, econom
ics, journalism, and history, as well as the
American way of life, and they are now living
in nine different campus residences.
The ASSU program is designed not only to
help the loreign students, by offering them a
chance to acquire a year of American educa
tion, but also to help the Stanford students ac
quire knowledge of the attitudes and ways of
life iri other nations.
According to members of the Foreign Schol
arship Committee, these tv/o goals are impor
tant because it will aid in bettering interna
tional relations.
In support of this statement, a professor
pointed out that "America left many bad im
pressions in Europe and the rest of the world
and by programs like these, we can help to
clear up any misconceptions about American
intents, ideals, and purposes that were left be
hind."
Stanford students, on the whole, seem to
agree and to think the program is beneficial,
because none contacted felt that the program
should be discontinued or that it was complete
ly missing its purpose. However, many stu
dt-hts frcm all classes knew little about it and
expressed the wish that it be extended.
Here are some of the comments:
Charles Itte, '57 — "I think the program is
worth while. It gives us a chance to appraise
the quality of the students from abroad and by
the same token, gives them a chance to ap
praise us."
George Abel, '56 —"I think the program is
great because it obviously promotes interna
tional unity and understanding."

Don Tuthill, '56 —"I'm in favor of it . . . but
I think that we need to promote a similar pro
gram by which American students could go
abroad."
Dolores Morton, '59 "I think it is an excel
lent idea but it should be developed to give
more students a chance to participate."
That opinion was expressed by many stu
dents. They requested that the program be
given more publicity, that more students be
given a chance to take part in it, and that the
number of foreign scholars be increased.
Some of those opinions were:
Lina Fuller, '57 —"I think the program should
be enlarged. Unless students happen to go to
Cosmopolitan Club meetings, they rarely gel
a chance to meet the foreign students."
Barbara Jackson, '59 — "I think it provides
wonderful opportunities but also that more of
an effort should be made toward reaching the
students (Stanford students)."
However, a member of the Institute of Inter
national Relations voiced the opinion that
"Stanford students don't really try to take ad
vantage of the program."
The final comment came from Nancy Simms,
'56, who said, "I think the foreign student pro
gram is beneficial and I think it should be en- j
larged. However, as much as we want to meet
them, I think we should try to give some con
sideration to the foreign students. They hardly
get time to study because they are called here
and there to give talks and meet people. We
seem to forget that they have classes like the
rest of us, as well as language difficulties. If.
the program were enlarged to admit two or
more students from each country, more Stan-?
ford students could meet them and they would
be given a chance to learn something of Amer
ica on their own."

pressions in Europe and the rest of the world
and by programs like these, we can help to
clear up any misconceptions about American
intents, ideals, and purposes that were left be
hind."
Stanford students, on the whole, seem to
agree and to think the program is beneficial,
because none contacted felt that the program
should be discontinued or that it was complete
ly missing its purpose. However, many stu
dt-hts frcm all classes knew little about it and
expressed the wish that it be extended.
Here are some of the comments:
Charles Itte, '57 — "I think the program is
worth while. It gives us a chance to appraise
the quality of the students from abroad and by
the same token, gives them a chance to ap
praise us."
George Abel, '56 —"I think the program is
great because it obviously promotes interna
tional unity and understanding."

Don Tuthill, '56 —"I'm in favor of it . . . but
I think that we need to promote a similar pro
gram by which American students could go
abroad."
Dolores Morton, '59 "I think it is an excel
lent idea but it should be developed to give
more students a chance to participate."
That opinion was expressed by many stu
dents. They requested that the program be
given more publicity, that more students be
given a chance to take part in it, and that the
number of foreign scholars be increased.
Some of those opinions were:
Lina Fuller, '57 —"I think the program should
be enlarged. Unless students happen to go to
Cosmopolitan Club meetings, they rarely gel
a chance to meet the foreign students."
Barbara Jackson, '59 — "I think it provides
wonderful opportunities but also that more of
an effort should be made toward reaching the
students (Stanford students)."
However, a member of the Institute of Inter
national Relations voiced the opinion that
"Stanford students don't really try to take ad
vantage of the program."
The final comment came from Nancy Simms,
'56, who said, "I think the foreign student pro
gram is beneficial and I think it should be en- j
larged. However, as much as we want to meet
them, I think we should try to give some con
sideration to the foreign students. They hardly
get time to study because they are called here
and there to give talks and meet people. We
seem to forget that they have classes like the
rest of us, as well as language difficulties. If.
the program were enlarged to admit two or
more students from each country, more Stan-?
ford students could meet them and they would
be given a chance to learn something of Amer
ica on their own."

This fall, nine foreign students arrived at
S'.anford under the Associated Students of
Stanford University scholarship program.
They came from countries ranging from
Scotland to Morocco and Norway to Australia.
They came to study political science, econom
ics, journalism, and history, as well as the
American way of life, and they are now living
in nine different campus residences.
The ASSU program is designed not only to
help the loreign students, by offering them a
chance to acquire a year of American educa
tion, but also to help the Stanford students ac
quire knowledge of the attitudes and ways of
life iri other nations.
According to members of the Foreign Schol
arship Committee, these tv/o goals are impor
tant because it will aid in bettering interna
tional relations.
In support of this statement, a professor
pointed out that "America left many bad im
pressions in Europe and the rest of the world
and by programs like these, we can help to
clear up any misconceptions about American
intents, ideals, and purposes that were left be
