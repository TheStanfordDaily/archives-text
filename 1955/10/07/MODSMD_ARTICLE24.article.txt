As the country again gets set to embark on
the wave of campaign fanfare and pre-election
excitement, the Democratic and Republican
parties find themselves beset by serious, pe
culiar, and befuddling problems.
Not the least of these quandaries arises from
the situation surrounding the recent illness of
President Eisenhower, who up until two weeks
ago was the foundation for every campaign
hope and prayer of Republican leaders.
Now that the party is faced with the prospect
of uniting its manifold factions behind a com
mon candidate, Republican leaders are coming
to realize that Eisenhower's prophetic warning
against considering any one man indispen
sable to the party has ironically shown itself
to be true.
GOP Chairman Leonard Hall and other re
sponsible Republican leaders have broadly
hinted that Eisenhower was the only man who
could carry the party over the hurdles in next
year's political race. Now they are coming to
realize that the choice will probably have to
lie in other less fertile fields.
Before the President was stricken, Hall often
quoted a state chairman when asked what the
party would do if Eisenhower would not run.
"When I get to that bridge," he said, "I will
jump off it."
The bridge is pretty clearly in focus, and, in
addition to losing their "one and only" candi
date, GOP leaders are faced with the probabil
ity that Eisenhower's personal ability to hold
his splintering party together will lose much of
its power if he doesn't run again.
There is little chance that the President will
be given a free hand in selecting the Republi
can standard-bearer although his advice and
.active support will be valuable to party leaders.
Technically, Vice-President Richard Nixon,
now acting as Eisenhower's chief deputy,
stands in a sound position come the Republican
convention next August.
But the field lies wide open. Nixon has sev
eral political strikes against him as a possible
candidate, namely his violent attack against the
Democrats for being soft on Communism and
the opposition he will face in California's Gov
ernor Goodwin Knight.

Governor Knight has already avowed his in
tention to lead the California delegation as a
favorite son candidate if Eisenhower does not
run. It didn't take much time for sharp repri
sals to rise from other California GOP leaders,
many of whom are Nixon supporters.
Democratic planners face a different, but
equally puzzling, problem of whom to choose.
The 1952 standard-bearer, Adlai Stevenson,
was the favorite choice of Democratic Gover
nors in their conference in August, but since
then the name of New York's Governor Averill
Harriman has been appearing more and more
in the Democratic limelight.
Despite statements that he is firmly behind
Stevenson, Harriman appears ready to take the
nomination if it is handed to him. Behind him
he will have the support of the powerful New
York delegation and many who feel that Ste
venson, a one-time loser, could not carry the
load..
Other possibilities for the Republican ticket
lie in the two Californians, Governor Knight
and Senator William Knowland, Harold Stas
sen, Milton Eisenhower, Herbert Hoover, Jr.,
Eisenhower's personal friend Henry Cabot
Lodge, and a host of others.
Chief Justice Earl Warren, more liberal and
potentially more successful than many of the
other Republican candidates, has been sug
gested as a strong contender if he should
choose to run, but he has stated emphatically
that he will not re-enter political life.
Looking at the question of election issues,
you get a similarly uncertain answer: you can't
really tell until the candidates are chosen and
the political forces in each camp are better
organized.
It is obvious that peace and prosperity will
play a large part in the GOP platform; beyond
that, little is certain besides the usual defense
of administration policies.
The Democrats are fairly sure to base their
offense on the split between wings on foreign
policy even within the administration, the re
current farm problem, the slips in the adminis
tration's security program, and the transference
of much of the nation's public power to private
hands.

to be true.
GOP Chairman Leonard Hall and other re
sponsible Republican leaders have broadly
hinted that Eisenhower was the only man who
could carry the party over the hurdles in next
year's political race. Now they are coming to
realize that the choice will probably have to
lie in other less fertile fields.
Before the President was stricken, Hall often
quoted a state chairman when asked what the
party would do if Eisenhower would not run.
"When I get to that bridge," he said, "I will
jump off it."
The bridge is pretty clearly in focus, and, in
addition to losing their "one and only" candi
date, GOP leaders are faced with the probabil
ity that Eisenhower's personal ability to hold
his splintering party together will lose much of
its power if he doesn't run again.
There is little chance that the President will
be given a free hand in selecting the Republi
can standard-bearer although his advice and
.active support will be valuable to party leaders.
Technically, Vice-President Richard Nixon,
now acting as Eisenhower's chief deputy,
stands in a sound position come the Republican
convention next August.
But the field lies wide open. Nixon has sev
eral political strikes against him as a possible
candidate, namely his violent attack against the
Democrats for being soft on Communism and
the opposition he will face in California's Gov
ernor Goodwin Knight.

Governor Knight has already avowed his in
tention to lead the California delegation as a
favorite son candidate if Eisenhower does not
run. It didn't take much time for sharp repri
sals to rise from other California GOP leaders,
many of whom are Nixon supporters.
Democratic planners face a different, but
equally puzzling, problem of whom to choose.
The 1952 standard-bearer, Adlai Stevenson,
was the favorite choice of Democratic Gover
nors in their conference in August, but since
then the name of New York's Governor Averill
Harriman has been appearing more and more
in the Democratic limelight.
Despite statements that he is firmly behind
Stevenson, Harriman appears ready to take the
nomination if it is handed to him. Behind him
he will have the support of the powerful New
York delegation and many who feel that Ste
venson, a one-time loser, could not carry the
load..
Other possibilities for the Republican ticket
lie in the two Californians, Governor Knight
and Senator William Knowland, Harold Stas
sen, Milton Eisenhower, Herbert Hoover, Jr.,
Eisenhower's personal friend Henry Cabot
Lodge, and a host of others.
Chief Justice Earl Warren, more liberal and
potentially more successful than many of the
other Republican candidates, has been sug
gested as a strong contender if he should
choose to run, but he has stated emphatically
that he will not re-enter political life.
Looking at the question of election issues,
you get a similarly uncertain answer: you can't
really tell until the candidates are chosen and
the political forces in each camp are better
organized.
It is obvious that peace and prosperity will
play a large part in the GOP platform; beyond
that, little is certain besides the usual defense
of administration policies.
The Democrats are fairly sure to base their
offense on the split between wings on foreign
policy even within the administration, the re
current farm problem, the slips in the adminis
tration's security program, and the transference
of much of the nation's public power to private
hands.
As the country again gets set to embark on
the wave of campaign fanfare and pre-election
excitement, the Democratic and Republican
parties find themselves beset by serious, pe
culiar, and befuddling problems.
Not the least of these quandaries arises from
the situation surrounding the recent illness of
President Eisenhower, who up until two weeks
ago was the foundation for every campaign
hope and prayer of Republican leaders.
Now that the party is faced with the prospect
of uniting its manifold factions behind a com
mon candidate, Republican leaders are coming
to realize that Eisenhower's prophetic warning
against considering any one man indispen
sable to the party has ironically shown itself
to be true.
