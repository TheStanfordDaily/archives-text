To the Editor:
At the suggestion of the Bnck-to-the-Farm Com
mittee, we have set up an exhibit in the front lobby
of the Hoover Library. It is Way Back, to the First
Farm-y-mostly to acquaint the men and women of the
class of 1959 with their own background and ancestry.
But it is also for all the Back-to-the-Farmers who
have never seen how the ladies of Roble and the

gentlemen of Encina lived in the '90's. Or what a Big
Game ticket looked like in 1895. Or how politely the
first students were asked to pay their first student
body dues. Or who is the only permanent current
member of the ASSU.
Come in any time in the next couple of weeks.
Needn't bring your sponsor, or your sponsees.
