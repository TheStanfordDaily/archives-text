# Daily Had Humble Start 6 Decades Ago
## Paper Overcomes Difficulties Despite Predictions of Failure 
### JIM PALMER 
Clliis is National Newspaper Week—a period set aside in lion.tr of
America s fourth estate. The following article is a story <;!" Stanford's
(cntriluition to the wcrld of journalism.)

For ever six decades Stanford students have bean gathering and
reporting the news of the Farm and the world about it.
li was on a September day in 1892 when an old flat-bed press
coughed out four pages of printed matter proclaiming "The Daily
Palo Alto makes its first appearance today."
From these inauspicious beginnings in the back shop of the

ueuwoou city uemocrat 63 years
i«o, the daily newspaper of the cam
pus has «i'own and prospered in
service to the members of the ever
changing Stanford Family.
And today the "Daily" can look
back with amusement to those early
years of struggle and growing pains
—the most important period of any
newspaper's history.
There was much opposition to the
formation of a daily paper from
many sectors of the campus when
John C. Capron, Carl S. Smith,
lames F. Wilson, A. C. Trumbo, and
Archie B. Rice made the big plunge
into the publishing business.
FAILURE PREDICTED
It was argued that there was not
enough demand for it, the Univer
sity was too small, and that it would
be a financial failure.
Nevertheless, on Sept. 19, 1892, the
'Daily Palo Alto" was born—out
growth of a magazine known as the
"Palo Alto" which had been founded
in 1891 simultaneously with the
opening of the University.
And the demand soon developed.
The first issue resembled more a
magazine than a newspaper as we
know it today. There was no atten
tion given to top columns, no con
ception of newspaper makeup.
Purpose of the Daily Palo Alto (a
name which was abbreviated DPA,
th?n slurred into "Dippy" and finally
changed to the "Stanford Daily"
in 192G) was set forth in that first
issue: "It is to be the medium
through which all items of interest
may be published to the members
of the University. It will contain
items of interest, from other colleges
and thus span the distance between
this and other universities."
EDI'IOR RESIGNED
The first two weeks were the
hardest lW the "Dippy." Papers
were printed in Redwood City, sent
to Stanford by Wells Fargo messen
ger, and then distributed by news
boys. r
Editor Capron couldn't stand the
pace and he resigned.
In his first editomafr ory Oct. 3, new'
editor C. S. Smith summed up the
struggles of the new paper:
"The last two weeks, have not been
cxactly a season of joy.{o the editors'
and managers of the Daily P;ilo Alto.
In fact there were certain times
when, despite our hopes and ambi
tions, our days were full of woe and
we saw no pleasure in them.
WITHOUT EATING
"We see in our lexicon that in
Latin the word editor means to eat.
From our own experience we found
that editor meant to go without eat
ing, to cut recitations, to take mid
night trips to Redwood and do other
things that would harrow up our
feeling's to relate.
"However, there was one word
written on our shield — Hope. A
noble purpose was irt our heart and
wo determined to fight it out on this
line if it took a college course ..

That same day, it was announced
that the "Dippy" had acquired a
| cress of its own for the price of
$1,500. About 2,000 copics could be
printed an hour on it.
And came this announcement:
"Until a suitable building can be
erected for us, the plant will occupy
the vacant space in the southwest
end of the machine shops."
TUESDAY SERIES
News has changed greatly from
days in 1892—but even at that,
the lead news story in the first issue
was a review of a Tuesday evening
series lecture by a Professor Hud
son on Herbert Spencer.
Editorials were the real highlights
of the first Dippys. Lambasting and
campaigning, the editors never hesi
tated in speaking their piece.
San Francisco newspapers .partic
ularly j fell under the surveillance of
the'.fcditorials from the,very start.
EXAMINER BLASTED
In his second issue, Capron blasted
the "Examiner" for filling space with
some wood engravings: "We hope
that if it ever falls to our lot to
sacrifice anything for the sake of
mechanical effects that we may not
present such an appearance to our
readers as does the Examiner."
Smith editorialized often on foot
ball and track, commenting once:
"When the San Francisco daily pa
pers touch upon athletics they are
usually ignorant, and when they
come to football they are amusing."
Editorial campaigns were launched
to obtain a post office, increase social
activities, provide grad scholarships,
and condemn abusing of furniture in
Encina.
ON SOCIAL FTIQUETTE
On Nov. 1, 1892, the "Dippy" saw
fit to comment on social etiquette:
"We have been asked if the early
instructions given the young ladies
in Roble last year about not bowing
to young men are still in vogue.
"We ;i can not say. But.jt r seems to
us (that the first confused period of
cpllege life is past, and that the
young ladies can with the' utmost
propriety observe those little acts of
politeness and those forms of society
, which it certainly must have been
[heir custom to use and see used at
|- home."
And so the "Daily Palo Alio" was

launched. In the years to come it
was to move upward and outward.
In 1899. the first double-column was
used and a step upward in the heads
was reached.
MAKEUP CHANGED
In the 1905 editions was the first
regard to the makeup of the paper.
Another step was taken in 1914
when the paper was increased to a
five-column sheet. In 1920 came a
sixth column and in 1925, a sev
enth. Four years later the eight
column size came into existence.
An afternoon paper for 33 years,
the "Dippy" became "the Paninsula's
only morning newspaper" in 1923
when it changed its name.
In 1928, the Daily was admitted
as a member of the Associated
Press, but switched to United Pres?'
in 1936. Twice the Daily went tab
loid—in 1943 and again during 1948-
49.
STACKED IN CORNERS
Up until 1942 the paper was
delivered regularly by newiboys
Since that time it has been stacked
in convenient corners of the campus
and in living groups.
At least 132 editors have held
reins over the paper during the 6C
years—some of whom have gone on
to become well known in different
fields. Bill Leiser. present sports
editor of tlfe San Francisco "Chroni
cle," was editor in 1921, and Lloyd
W. Dinkelspiel, president of the
Stanford Board of Trustees, edited
in 1920.
As staffers have come and gone
throughout the years, the "Dippy"
has changed in form and content—
having been molded by each pair of
hands that touched it.
But the purpose is still there, and

perhaps the essence of the Daily can
.still be explained in words from that
first editorial back in 1892:
"True it is that the Daily will not
make a great university, but just as
true is it that the Daily is one of
the signs of a great university."

THE PRESSES ROLL—Here's the only permanent member of
the Daily staff—the ever faithful press. Day in and day out this
same press in the Daily "back shop" has printed "the Penin
sula's only morning newspaper" for over 20 years. In the photo
