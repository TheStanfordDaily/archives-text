Major George Racey Jordan, au
thor of "From Major Jordan's Dia
ries," will speak to Political Union
Independents on "Atomic Espion
age" at 4 p.m. today in Cubberley
Auditorium.
The retired Air Force major
served as liaison officer to the Rus
sian air force during World War II
and as Lend-Lease expediter at
Great Falls, Montana, the entrance
to the great secret pipeline by air
to Moscow.
His book created a mild sensation i
on the political scene with revela- j
tions of Lend-Lease deals with Rus- j
sia which he claimed gave atom and [
hydrogen bomb secrets away, in ad- j
dition to building up the strength
of Russian war potential.
He testified seven times before !
different congressional committees
on Lend-Lease swindles, such as
uranium shipments and giving mas
ter money plates to Russia.
In addition to his book, he has
lectured in more than 100 cities and j
written many articles in various j
magazines, including The Reader's
Digest.
Major Jordan was a top sergeant
in Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker's flying
group during World War I.
This will be the first meeting of
the Union Independents for the
quarter. President Ed Bar r has
urged all members and prospective
members to be present.
