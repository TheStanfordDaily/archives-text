# ‘Gate of Hell' Is Core Of New Type of Art
## 
### RICHARD MENDE 
Although "Gate of Hell" is notable because its virtues greatly
outweigh its imperfections, it is more significant because, along
v/ith "Roshomon" and "Ugetsu," it forms the core of a new art
genre, the Japanese art film. Now that the Daiei Studios have
added color to their pictures, all of the basic tools of movie-making

have been put into use (with the
exception of experimental techniques
such as stereophonic sound).
This new art form resembles an
animated Japanese print. It is as
different from the distinct French,
American or English type movies as
the print is unique among the sun
dry painting schools.
Vital difference between the new
form and European drama, both
filmed and staged, is that emotion

is conveyed in in
tellectual terms
rather than by al
lowing the audi
ence to associate
itself with one of
the principal char
acters. Here is a
restraint which
Americans, used'
tn Caster - movine

iu lazier- iiiuviiig
action pictures, may find disconcert
ing at first.
Two basically different types of
acting technique are used in "Gate
of Hell," and it will be interesting
to see what form may evolve for the
future. The principal characters,
Kesa and Moitoh, are played in a
highly stylized fashion, Kesa using
only her eyes and frightened quiver
ings of the mouth to express emo

tion, and Moitoh pondei'ous grim
aces and harsh grunts. The other
actors in the cast employ all the
naturalistic techniques of the west
ern tradition.
In "Gate of Hell" the legitimate
use of color in film has been re
stored. It has demonstrated that
color should not be used to make a
picture pretty—as Hollywood pro
ducers might do well to note—but
to heighten dramatic effect. The vio
lent reds of the battle scenes, the
purples and blues of the scene in
which Kesa sacrifices herself, per
form dramatically. They have be
come an integral part of the drama.
The Japanese art film calls heav
ily upon classical legends for its
material. This is a part of the intel
lectualization of the drama, and
again, action - seeking audiences
might become impatient as detail is
piled upon detail.
But it is all a part of the new and
very worthy art form. Within this
form, which its producers* helped to
create, "Gate of Hell" is masterfully
executed. It is done with a bold,
firm, and conscientious hand; yet it
displays delicacy and refinement of
taste. It is certainly worthy of at
tention.

acting technique are used in "Gate
of Hell," and it will be interesting
to see what form may evolve for the
future. The principal characters,
Kesa and Moitoh, are played in a
highly stylized fashion, Kesa using
only her eyes and frightened quiver
ings of the mouth to express emo

tion, and Moitoh pondei'ous grim
aces and harsh grunts. The other
actors in the cast employ all the
naturalistic techniques of the west
ern tradition.
In "Gate of Hell" the legitimate
use of color in film has been re
stored. It has demonstrated that
color should not be used to make a
picture pretty—as Hollywood pro
ducers might do well to note—but
to heighten dramatic effect. The vio
lent reds of the battle scenes, the
purples and blues of the scene in
which Kesa sacrifices herself, per
form dramatically. They have be
come an integral part of the drama.
The Japanese art film calls heav
ily upon classical legends for its
material. This is a part of the intel
lectualization of the drama, and
again, action - seeking audiences
might become impatient as detail is
piled upon detail.
But it is all a part of the new and
very worthy art form. Within this
form, which its producers* helped to
create, "Gate of Hell" is masterfully
executed. It is done with a bold,
firm, and conscientious hand; yet it
displays delicacy and refinement of
taste. It is certainly worthy of at
tention.

Although "Gate of Hell" is notable because its virtues greatly
outweigh its imperfections, it is more significant because, along
v/ith "Roshomon" and "Ugetsu," it forms the core of a new art
genre, the Japanese art film. Now that the Daiei Studios have
added color to their pictures, all of the basic tools of movie-making

have been put into use (with the
exception of experimental techniques
such as stereophonic sound).
This new art form resembles an
animated Japanese print. It is as
different from the distinct French,
American or English type movies as
the print is unique among the sun
dry painting schools.
Vital difference between the new
form and European drama, both
filmed and staged, is that emotion

is conveyed in in
tellectual terms
rather than by al
lowing the audi
ence to associate
itself with one of
the principal char
acters. Here is a
restraint which
