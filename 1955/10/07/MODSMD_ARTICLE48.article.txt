# Safety Sought In fireplaces
## 
### 
Fireplace Safety Week begins Oct.
9 in San Francisco and is expected
to last until Oct. 15, weather per
mitting.
'lhis may not be of interest to
many on the Stanford campus, but
some of the residences have fire
places and Stanford has a long rec
ord of safety in its fireplaces. The
only real calamity in the history of
Stanford fireplaces was in 1906 when
the San Francisco earthquake filled
Encina's fireplaces with bricks from
the crumbling chimneys.
The San Francisco Junior Cham
ber of Commerce and the San Fran
cisco Chapter of the National Safety
Council, co - sponsors of Fireplace
Safety Week, would, at any rate,
like to call Fireplace Safety Week
to the attention of the student body.
