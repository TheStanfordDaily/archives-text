# Summer NSA Discussion Topics Included Desegregation, Academic Freedom, Vote
## Congress Approved Resolution On Equal Educational Opportunities 
### DAVE BROWNWOOD Staff Editor, The Daily (Second in a Series) 
Discrimination in education, desegregation, the 18-year-old vote,
student-faculty-administration relations, academic freedom, and
the McCarran Act were among the issues brought before the
Eighth Annual National Student Association Congress this sum
mer.
The congress, which gathered at the University of Minnesota,

is the legislative body of the National''
Student Association, formed each
summer to make NSA policy for the
coming year.
The nearly 600 delegates to the
congress represented 281 schools and
nearly 600,000 students.
Among the significant resolutions
passed was the "Model Educational
Practices Standards." This document
outlined the areas in which undemo
cratic practices in education were
most common and stated the methods
by which such practices can be elim
inated.
"EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES"
The tone of the document is con
tained in the preamble: "The USNSA
will seek to secure . . . equal oppor
tunities for education at all levels, re
gardless of race, color, national ori
gin, sex, creed, and political belief
or economic circumstance, especially
by seeking the eventual elimination
of all forms of discriminatory educa
tional practices everywhere in the
United States . . ."
Areas in which this doctrine was
applied were admissions; scholar
ships, grants, and loans; college em
ployment policies; student place
ment; restrictive clauses in student
social organizations; campus hous
ing and boarding; off-campus ac
commodations and services; health
facilities; physical education; and
recreation.
Following the passage of this, the
congress mandated the educational
affairs vice-president to send all
member student governments the
MEPS and recommend that they
consider its adoption.
DESEGREGATION
They urged immediate desegrega
tion in higher education and "a
prompt and reasonable start" toward
desegregation in secondary and ele
mentary education in segregated
" â–  i

areas, in accordance with the 1954-
j 55 rulings of the Supreme Court.
Included in the desegregation res
! olution were suggestions for nation
al. regional, and campus action fur
thering the principle of integration.
18-YEAR-OLD VOTE
The 18 - year - old vote question
was presented to the congress, but
the resolution, stating that "the
USNSA believes that suffrage should
not be denied a group which evi
dences sufficient responsibility to
exercise its vote judiciously," was
i defeated.
The majority felt that, although
j 18-year-old college students could
meet this standard, such 18-year
olds were in the minority.
STU-FACT ADMINISTRATION
The group "recognized" that "an
educational community unifies those
who teach, learn, and administer in
the common purpose of improving
reciprocal educational experience,
j and thus their aims are best served
! when this unity is realized and ex
pressed in their mutual relationships
and respective activities."
Recognizing this, the congress re
solved that, on the academic level,
"the student government should ac
tively participate in co-operative
planning of policy" and on the ad
ministrative level should "actively
participate in certain administra
tive decisions."
ACADEMIC FREEDOM
The congress stood opposed to po
litical test oaths concerning stu
dents, faculty, or administration. It
also resolved that "the only grounds
on which a * professor should be
judged are his professional compe
tence and integrity," adding that
membership in an organization ad
vocating the violent overthrow of
the government often endangers the
ability of a professor to be profes
sionally competent.
A third resolution concerning ac
ademic freedom emphasized that at
the present certain barkers to the
free access to information essential

to a professor's or student's academic
role exist, such barriers placing "in
jeopardy the foundations upon
which rests an informed and intelli
gent society."
McC ARRAN - WALTER ACT
They urged the waiving of the
provisions of the McCarran-Walter
Act which limit access to the U.S.
to students seeking to study or visit,
to educators and scientists seeking to
exchange information, and to schol
ars seeking to teach temporarily or
to become citizens.
The principle upon which this ac
tion was based is that "the ex
change of students and scholars is
necessary for promoting the inter
national advancement of knowledge
and of mutual understanding."
In other action, the congress ap
proved an expansion of the foreign
exchange program "as a means of
furthering |the| objective of pro
moting international understanding
and fellowship," urged tax relief for
college students, commended the
World University Service, urged
greater international student co-op
eration and better relations with
other national student unions, and
stood opposed to universal military
training except in times of national
emergency.
