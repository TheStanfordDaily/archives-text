# Cards Have Top Athletic Plants
## 
### 
By JIM PIGOTT
Although studies are the chief
occupation of most of the under
graduates on the Farm throughout
the year, athletics play an important
part in the everyday curriculum. It
is well known that Stanford students
have available to them one of the
mo t modern and complete athletic
plants in America. The majority ol
these facilities are available to all
students and faculty, and not just
the athletes.
LARGE STADIUM
'1 he fall of each year brings thou
sands of fans tripping out to Stan
ford's huge football stadium. The
seating tfapacity ol the giant struc
ture is approximately 92,000. This
figure is the second highest for col
lege stadiums in America. The bow!,
which includes a track with a 220-
yard straightaway, was built back
in 1922, when the famous Pop War
ner was coaching the fearsome In
dian elevens.
Just outside the stadium lies An
gell Field, with a track which was
completely rebuilt a few years back
and which is without an equal on
the Pacific coast. The track and en
closed field are used for training
and are also the site of the lrosh
cinder meets and the Intramural
championships. Anyone wishing to
work out on his own may also use
the track.
OUTSTANDING LINKS
Perhaps the most impressive sin
gle piece of Stanford's athletic lay
out is the magnificent golf course.
The 18-hole layout, spread out over
200 acres of rolling hills, has pro
duced championship teams through
out the years with amazing regu
larity. This site is also open to all
students at a low rate.

The basketball pavilion, where In
dian cagers face their opponent l , is
not noted for its spacious seating
capacity, but does have a very fine
playing surface. The building only
seats about 2,700 spectators, but ap
proximately 3,000 have been known
to squeeze in for important contests.
The weight-lifting room and mats
i'or .vrestling are located next door
to the basketball court.
The center of activity for men is
the Encina gym, which houses the
lockers for Card athletes and one of
the int.amural basketball courts.
Al c o located inside the gym are fa
cilities for boxing, .handball and
fencing.
SWIMMERS SHINE
Outside are located three swim
ming pools which house the sensa
tional Indian aqua teams. Both Tom
Haynie's swimming squad and his
water polo team have run up out
standing records in the past few
years. There is also a women's pool
located by the Women's Gymnasium
and athletic field.
Another Stanford "best" is the
Sunken Diamond. Here Card nines
play on one of the best college dia
monds anywhere. The park is so
good that the Detroit Tigers trained
here back in 1935 when they were
challenging for the American League
pennant. The walls of the park are
both 350 feet down the line, thus
making home runs far and few be
tween.
MURAL FACILITIES
Other units in the athletic plant
on the Farm include the four foot
ball fields, 19 tennis courts, one soc
cer field, a polo field, several intra
mural fields, horseshoe pits, volley
ball courts, and nine other baseball
fields—all for student enjoyment.
Intramurals hold a major spot in
campus doings, with all men's living
groups entering the competition,
which includes football and table
tennis and just about any other sport
you can think of.

Although studies are the chief
occupation of most of the under
graduates on the Farm throughout
the year, athletics play an important
part in the everyday curriculum. It
is well known that Stanford students
have available to them one of the
mo t modern and complete athletic
plants in America. The majority ol
these facilities are available to all
students and faculty, and not just
the athletes.
LARGE STADIUM
'1 he fall of each year brings thou
sands of fans tripping out to Stan
ford's huge football stadium. The
seating tfapacity ol the giant struc
ture is approximately 92,000. This
figure is the second highest for col
lege stadiums in America. The bow!,
which includes a track with a 220-
yard straightaway, was built back
in 1922, when the famous Pop War
ner was coaching the fearsome In
dian elevens.
Just outside the stadium lies An
gell Field, with a track which was
completely rebuilt a few years back
and which is without an equal on
the Pacific coast. The track and en
closed field are used for training
and are also the site of the lrosh
cinder meets and the Intramural
championships. Anyone wishing to
work out on his own may also use
the track.
OUTSTANDING LINKS
Perhaps the most impressive sin
gle piece of Stanford's athletic lay
out is the magnificent golf course.
The 18-hole layout, spread out over
200 acres of rolling hills, has pro
duced championship teams through
out the years with amazing regu
larity. This site is also open to all
students at a low rate.

The basketball pavilion, where In
dian cagers face their opponent l , is
not noted for its spacious seating
capacity, but does have a very fine
playing surface. The building only
seats about 2,700 spectators, but ap
proximately 3,000 have been known
to squeeze in for important contests.
The weight-lifting room and mats
i'or .vrestling are located next door
to the basketball court.
The center of activity for men is
the Encina gym, which houses the
lockers for Card athletes and one of
the int.amural basketball courts.
Al c o located inside the gym are fa
cilities for boxing, .handball and
fencing.
SWIMMERS SHINE
Outside are located three swim
ming pools which house the sensa
tional Indian aqua teams. Both Tom
Haynie's swimming squad and his
water polo team have run up out
standing records in the past few
years. There is also a women's pool
located by the Women's Gymnasium
and athletic field.
Another Stanford "best" is the
Sunken Diamond. Here Card nines
play on one of the best college dia
monds anywhere. The park is so
good that the Detroit Tigers trained
here back in 1935 when they were
challenging for the American League
pennant. The walls of the park are
both 350 feet down the line, thus
making home runs far and few be
tween.
MURAL FACILITIES
Other units in the athletic plant
on the Farm include the four foot
ball fields, 19 tennis courts, one soc
cer field, a polo field, several intra
mural fields, horseshoe pits, volley
ball courts, and nine other baseball
fields—all for student enjoyment.
Intramurals hold a major spot in
campus doings, with all men's living
groups entering the competition,
which includes football and table
tennis and just about any other sport
you can think of.
