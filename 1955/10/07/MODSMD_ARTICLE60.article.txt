# Braves Test Air Force Eleven In Tough Home Tilt
## 
### JIM BAKER 
Tomorrow afternoon at 2 the
Stanford Braves will face their
toughest test of the young sea- j
son, playing Hamilton Field at
Stanford Stadium.
The Braves, tied 13-13 by the
California Ramblers last week in
their opening contest, will face a
star-studded eleven which includes j
such greats Dick Daugherty of
the Rams and Ed Pucci, formerly of
use.
GREEN LINE
"Inexperienced linemen will be!
our main handicap," stated Mai El- !
ward, Brave coach, "but the game
will be a good test for our boys."
Stanford will dearly miss Jack
Lewis, star quarterback for the
Braves the last two years, who flew
back to Michigan State with the
varsity. Taking Lewis' place will be
Les Hopkins.
The Hamilton Field eleven is
made up of former college and pro
fessional players.
FORMER CARD * I
Besides Pucci*and Daugherty, oth- !
er stars playing for the Hamilton
team are Ted Tanner, former Stan
ford gridder, and Ted Connolly, for
merly of the San' Francisco 49ers.!
With these players, the visitors |
should present a very formidable I
line.
Backing up the starting lineup
will be "plentiful reserves," accord
ing to Elward.
The Braves face San Jose State j
in their next game on Oct. 22, then
travel to Fort Or I on Oct. 2!).
