(Continued from page 1)
Other outstanding players on the
Spartan squad are tackle Norm
Masters, guard Buck Nystrom, half
back Clarence Peaks, who had the
best rushing average in the Big Ten
last year, and end Jim Hinesly, who
led the team in pass receptions in
1954.
Daugherty has stuck with Munn's
system on offense. The basis of the
system is a combination of the T
and single wing formations. The
Spartans come up over the ball lined
up in the T with an unbalanced

line. The play is then executed ei- i
| ther from the T or after the team j
I has shifted to the single wing. The j
system is probably the most com- j
plex in college football because it I
also incorporates elements of the j
j split-T, double wing, winged-T, and
short punt formations.
Stanford assistant coach "Dutch"
i Fehring, who watched the Spartans '
j fall to powerful Michigan. 14-7, last j
| Saturday, reported'to Coach Chuck :
Taylor that the Spartans this year
are sticking largely to the T. Feh.r- ;
: ing also reported that the Spartans I
j have a host of fine backs and / a r
i faster line than Ohio State's.
The Indian coaches feel, however, i
! that Michigan State does not have a !
breakaway threat of the caliber of I
Ohio State's "Hopalong" Cassady. j
i Therefore' Taylor does not plan to
i use a special defense as he did
against the Buckeyes where he had
the ends float to keep Cassady from
I turning the, corner on his end jruns. 1
Taylor plans to go with the same |
i lineup that started the Ohio State :
j game. That would be John Stewart.
! and Jerry Beatie at the ends, Chris
i Marshall and Paul Wi«gin at the]

tackles, Tony Mosich and Donn
Carswell at the guards, Joe Long at
center, Jerry Gustafson at quarter
back, Ernie Dorn and Paul Camerd
at the halfbacks, and Bill Tarr at
fullback.
Stanford will outweigh Michigan
State by about four pounds per man
in the line, and, if the Ohio State
game is any indication, the Spartans
are goiag to have a rough time mov
ing the Indians.
The game will start at 11 a.m.
PST and will be broadcast on sta
tion KYA.


HE'LL TOSS 'EM — Quarterback John Brodie limbers up his
throwing arm for the Stanford Indians' grid clash at Michigan
State College's Macklin Field tcmorrow at 11 a.m. PST. In three
campaigns to date, Brodie has made good on six of 15 aerials
for 89 yards to rank third among Card passers.


PRIME TARGET—End John Stewart displays the pass-catching
skill which ranks him as the foremost receiver in the PCC. Hav
ing pulled down 13 aerials for 145 yards in the Indians' first
three games of the year, Stewart is expected to carry much of
the load in the MSC game tomorrow.
