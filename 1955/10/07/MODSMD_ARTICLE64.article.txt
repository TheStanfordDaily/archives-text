ters by the count of 5 to 2.

Last week Coach Fred Priddle's
men edged past Hermania Athletic
Club ol' San Leandro, 3-2. Ned
Avery, Dick Babb and Bob Spare
all scored in last week's contest.

f>2 men on the squad, with four com
plete teams seeing action.
So far, Santa Clara has played
only one. game, San Jose State
whipped the Broncos, 3 to 1. Coach
Priddle expects the Broncos to show
several outstanding individual play

a whole.

for the Indians will be Babb and
Avery at wings, Clark and Annicq
and Bill Wren at center forward.

Mack will open at halfbacks, with
Skip Lord and Art Harlow at full
backs.

game, the Stanford JV's will meet
Balboa High School of San Fran
cisco. starting at 9 a.m. Balboa usu
ally is one of the powers of the AAA
in San Francisco and should give the
JV's a good battle.
A week from tomorrow the Indian
booters travel to San Francisco to
meet San Francisco State, with tho
JV's engaging the San Francisco
State JV.s
I.ETTERMFN MISSING
Last year the Indians played seven
lettermen out of a possible 11. Lead
ing them was All-American Sam
Suarez. Now the booters have lost
him and have fewer veterans, but
will rely on a new crop of lower
classmen and transfer students to
carry the load.
Several of these new men are
showing such great promise that the
first-stringers. are being forced to
fight hard in order to keep their po
sitions.
t ONFERFNCE (>PFNER
Tomorrow's game is the first in
conference play. Other teams that
the Indians will face in league play
i are California, San Jose State and
i USF.
