# LASSU Defeats Proposal For Student Parking Maps
## 
### DICK MEISTER Associate Editor, The Daily 
ASSU Legislature debated—and refused to approve—a propo
sal which, if put into effect, would supply 2,000 parking maps to
student drivers.
Cost of printing the multigraphed, three-color maps would be
S5O, according to Bill Tooley, student financial manager, who sub-

mitted the proposal at Wednesday
night's LASSU meeting.
"It's my opinion that with the
parking problem getting serious at
tention from everyone, something
like this may be needed," Tooley
commented.
Other members of Legislature ex
pressed some doubt as to whether
there was a student and/or campus
police demand for such maps suffi
oipnt to iustify the expenditure of
$50 on printing.
Tooley noted that University po
lice think they would be a good
thing, but how good the Legislature
didn't know, and so turned down
the proposal.
Members were given the constitu
tion of a new campus organization,
ESPRI (Educational Society for
Promotion of Relations Intercultu
ral) for their approval. The society
has been organized in the School of
Education arid, as ESPRI represen
tative Pedro Sanchez explained to
LASSU, has as its purpose "the
hosting of guests who come to Stan
ford, especially to the School of Ed
ucation."
Sanchez explained that this new
group would make up the visitors'
itinerary and do other preparation.
At next week's meeting LASSU is
scheduled to vote on approving
ESPRI as a campus organization.
The body also took under con
sideration changes in the WAA
(now officially WRA) constitution
and disbursement of funds for the
Fall Drive, giving an alternative of
either two-thirds of the money to
the Palo Alto Community Chest and
one-third to the Save the Children
Federation, or the entire amount to
the Community Chest, according to
recommendation of Drives Commit
tee.

ASSU Legislature debated—and refused to approve—a propo
sal which, if put into effect, would supply 2,000 parking maps to
student drivers.
Cost of printing the multigraphed, three-color maps would be
S5O, according to Bill Tooley, student financial manager, who sub-

mitted the proposal at Wednesday
night's LASSU meeting.
"It's my opinion that with the
parking problem getting serious at
tention from everyone, something
like this may be needed," Tooley
commented.
Other members of Legislature ex
pressed some doubt as to whether
there was a student and/or campus
police demand for such maps suffi
oipnt to iustify the expenditure of
$50 on printing.
