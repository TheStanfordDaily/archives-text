# Stanford Gridders Tumble Before Powerful Spartans
## MSC Capitalizes On Indian Fumbles To Get Early Lead 
### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford's football fortunes
nose-dived back down to rock
bottom Saturday as a classy and
alert Michigan State team thun
dered over the Indians, 38-14.
Stanford never could get back on
its feet after the Spartans scored on
a drive on the opening kickoff and
then, within a period of a few min
utes, recovered two Card fumbles
and eventually turned them into
touchdowns.
The Spartans displayed an all
around potent offense. The Big Ten
team operated smoothly from the T,
single wing, split T, and buck lat
eral series formations and moved
steadily both in the air and on the
ground.
A big surprise to Chuck Taylor
and his assistants was the effective
ness of Michigan State's passing at
tack. The Indian coaches were ex
pecting a powerful ground game but
not much in the way of an aerial
show. The Spartan quarterbacks,
however, surprised nearly every
body by completing seven passes in
nine attempts for 191 yards. When
the Stanford secondary backed up
to cover the long passes, the Spar
tans' speedy backs exploded through
the line for big chunks of yardage.
The Stanford quarterbacks, who
were supposed to do the passing in
the game, had a bad day in that de
partment. The quartet of Jerry Gus
tafson, John Brodie, Jack Douglas,
and Jack Lewis managed to com-


INDIAN ACE â€” Stanford quarterback John Brodie scored the
Cards' first touchdown against Michigan State on a two-yard
quarterback sneak. However, Brodie's touchdown was too little
and too late as the Spartans downed Stanford, 38-14, Saturday
at East Lansing.
plete only three of 15 attempts and [
had three intercepted. The second
Indian touchdown, however, came
on one of the pass completions as
Lewis threw 12 yards to end Bob
Gergen.
The one pleasant aspect of the
game from the Stanford viewpoint
was the Indians' ground game. The
Stanford backs rolled up 2H3 yards
along the ground to exactly match
Michigan State's total.
STANFORD GETS FIRST DOWNS
Due to this big piloup of yards
on the ground, Stanford came out
with 21 first downs compared to the
Spartans' 22.
Michigan State compiled an amaz
ing record on offense. The Spartans
gained control of the ball nine times
and on six of those occasions they
scored. One other time, the half
time gun caught the Spartans in the
middle of a drive. Only twice did
Michigan State punt, but one of
these was Earl Morrall's quick kick
that rolled dead on the Stanford
seven - yard line. The two punts
were forced largely by penalties
which repeatedly stymied the Spar
tans. They picked up 110 yards in
infractions compared to only five
for Stanford.
SPARTANS SCORE EARLY
The Spartans took the opening
kickoff and went light to the goal
line in nine plays. Morrall and end
Da ve Kaiser teamed up for 46 yards
on two completions in this march.
Stanford took the kickoff and
moved up to its own 36. Tarr burst
through the middle and picked up
14 yards, but he fumbled as he was
hit, and a burly MSC lineman fell
on the ball on the midfield stripe.
On the first play from there, Mor
rall hit end John Lewis on a 50-yard
scoring pass.
The Stanford fumble - Michigan
State score routine was repeated on
each of the ensuing two kickoffs and,
by the middle of the second quarter,
the Indians were down and all but
out at 26-0.
The Spartans picked up another
touchdown in the third quarter and
went into the final period with a
32-0 load.
Stanford finally mustered some
scoring punch in the final stage of
the game. The Indians started on
their own 18 and marched 82 yards
in 16 plays to get on the scoreboard.

Valli, Camera, and Harrington all
: did some fine running in this drive.
Brodie got the final two yards on a
quarterback sneak. ,
The Spartans took the kickoff and
marched down the field to rack up
another six points with a Jim Ni
nowski to Walt Kowalczyk pass be
ing the big gainer.
The Indians got their final TD in
the last minute of play as Lewis'
pass to Gergen capped a 71-yard
march.
Despite the outcome of the game,
Taylor told writers that he fully ex
pects Stanford to give UCLA a
rough afternoon next Saturday. The
Indians will be in top shape for that
game as there were no casualties
against Michigan State.
