Are you having a difficult
time getting your mail?
If you are, your letter is prob
ably one of hundreds piled up
at the Post Office which are in
correctly addressed.
According to Clerk-in-Charge E.
D. Nelligan, the Post Office has been
swamped the past two weeks with
hundreds of incorrectly addressed
letters, packages, newspapers, and
other periodicals.
Nelligan stated that there are
three major reasons for this mail
congestion.
One lies in the fact that students
who have changed their place of
residence since last year have not
filled out the change of address
cards. These cards, which are avail
able at the Post Office, help the of
ficials in delivering the mail to its
proper place.
The second trouble is that too
many persons are using general de
livery service to which they are not
entitled. Nelligan stated that only
students living in Branner. Encina,
Lagunita, Roble, Toyon, Wilbur, and
a few other exceptions where the
mail isn't delivered, are entitled to
general delivery service. All others
have either post office boxes or de
livery to the residence.
Nelligan added that students who
don't fall into any of the above clas
sifications will not be able to receive
mail from general delivery.
The final reason for the mail tie
up is an administration problem—
the need for a new, larger Post Of
fice—plans for which are now being
completed. The new post office will
be built across from its present lo
cation adjacent to the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fraternity house.
No construction date has been set,
although University officials hope to
have it completed by next fall.
The Post Office receives an aver
age of 9,000 letters, 50 sacks of pack
ages, plus hundreds of periodicals
every day. The government officials
are not equipped with electronic de
vices which can compute where the
mail should be delivered, therefore
it is up to the student to see that the
Post Office and his correspondents
address the letters properly.
Student?* can Tielp the Post Office

handle the mail more effectively
and thereby produce faster, more
effective service by paying' attention
to the six following suggestions:
1. Go to the post office and fill out
a change of address card, if you are
a new student not living in a fresh
man dormitory, or an old student
who has changed address.
2. Inform your correspondents of
your correct address. If you are en
titled to general delivery service the
mail should be addressed to Gen
eral Delivery. If you get your mail
delivered to a post office box or to
a residence receiving delivery serv
ice, the post office box or street ad
dress should be substituted for gen
eral delivery.
3. Be sure to include Stanford

University in the address. Stanford,
Calif., alone is confused frequently
with such California towns as Han
ford, Stratford, and even Stonyford.
Stamford, Conn., is the town to
which most of the vaguely addressed
mail goes.
4. If you are a Stern or Crothers
hall resident, be sure to have your
correct room number in the address.
This saves the Post Office time in
delivering the mail.
5. If you are a Village resident, be
sure your mail is addressed to your
building or apartment, Stanford Vil
lage, Stanford, Calif.
6. If you are not entitled to gen
eral delivery service, don't stand in
line for nothing, it only makes the
line longer.

SORTING MAIL—Bob Ike, directory clerk, sorts out the hun
dreds of letters which are incorrectly addressed to Stanford stu
dents. Ike's job is to work at the directory table sorting out each
letter to determine where it should be delivered.
