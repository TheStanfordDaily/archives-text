# Delegates Review NSA Meet with Mixed Feelings
##

(Last in a Series)
The eleven Stanford participants in the Eighth National Student
Congress returned with varied impressions regarding its value.
Nine hundred delegates, alternates, and visitors attended the
congress, held from Aug. 21 to 31, at the University of Minnesota.
The Congress is the legislative body of the National Student

Association. Six of the Stanford
participants went as delegates, three
as alternates, one as a regional offi
cer, and one as an observer.
All the participants agree that they
gained something from the congress
and that it was of some value. How
ever, all also saw weaknesses which
influenced, in varying degrees, their
general opinions of the meeting.
In the following observations,
some of the strengths and some of
the weaknesses which the partici
pants saw in the congress are ex
plained:
GEORGE RALPH
ASSU President George Ralph, a
j delegate, who took part in both the
! congress and the pre-congress Stu
-1 dent Body Presidents' Conference,
said: "I had rather mixed emotions
about NSA in general and the con
vention in particular.
"I did get something personally
, out of the Presidents' Conference,
and the session | sub-commission |
on college unions was valuable be
cause of our Union project, to begin
soon.
"As for the rest of the conference,
I do not think I learned much in
talking with representatives from
other schools, and I do not feel that
there was much opportunity for us
to contribute anything concrete for
the benefit of other schools.
"The association has a value as a
youth movement, in its concern for
creating student, interest in educa
tion and in world affairs, but I think
the connection with student govern
j ment is somewhat artificial."
BILL TOOLEY
Student Financial Manager Bill
Toolev, delegate, who also was in
I the college union sub-commission.
| pointed out that "this congress re
! quired an outlay of thousands of
j man-hours, thousands of dollars, and
j a tremendous amount, of planning
and organization. Was. it worth it?"
he asked.
"Many resolutions were passed by
the congress," he explained, "reso
lutions which ought to interest Stan
ford students because they deal with
; areas which should concern them.
But what value is there in just pass
ing a resolution if the students on
I the campus, or even that more in-
I terested group which forms the stu

dent government, don't respond?
"If the work of the NSA congress
is to become effective, then it will i
have to be discussed and acted upon
at the campus level. Each of the
delegates who attended the congress
gained experience and knowledge in
the fields which especially concerned
him.
''The work of the congress is done.
It is up to the NSA co-ordinator,
the delegates to the congress, and
indeed all students on the campus
to make this work worth while."
JIM SAMMET
NSA Co-ordinator Jim Sammet, j
delegate, said: "The importance of
the congress was twofold. First, it
provided the opportunity for student
leaders, not only from the United j
States but also from foreign coun- j
tries, to meet together to discuss j
their common problems," in this way
better preparing these people for
their campus jobs.
"The second important aspect of
the congress was the creation of the
policy which will guide the newly
elected national officers of NSA."
