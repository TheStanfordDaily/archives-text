# Delegates Review NSA Meet with Mixed Feelings
## 
### DAVE BROWNWOOD Staff Editor, The Daily 
(Last in a Series)
The eleven Stanford participants in the Eighth National Student
Congress returned with varied impressions regarding its value.
Nine hundred delegates, alternates, and visitors attended the
congress, held from Aug. 21 to 31, at the University of Minnesota.
The Congress is the legislative body of the National Student

Association. Six of the Stanford
participants went as delegates, three
as alternates, one as a regional offi
cer, and one as an observer.
All the participants agree that they
gained something from the congress
and that it was of some value. How
ever, all also saw weaknesses which
influenced, in varying degrees, their
general opinions of the meeting.
In the following observations,
some of the strengths and some of
the weaknesses which the partici
pants saw in the congress are ex
plained:
GEORGE RALPH
ASSU President George Ralph, a
j delegate, who took part in both the
! congress and the pre-congress Stu
-1 dent Body Presidents' Conference,
said: "I had rather mixed emotions
about NSA in general and the con
vention in particular.
"I did get something personally
, out of the Presidents' Conference,
and the session | sub-commission |
on college unions was valuable be
cause of our Union project, to begin
soon.
"As for the rest of the conference,
I do not think I learned much in
talking with representatives from
other schools, and I do not feel that
there was much opportunity for us
to contribute anything concrete for
the benefit of other schools.
"The association has a value as a
youth movement, in its concern for
creating student, interest in educa
tion and in world affairs, but I think
the connection with student govern
j ment is somewhat artificial."
BILL TOOLEY
Student Financial Manager Bill
Toolev, delegate, who also was in
I the college union sub-commission.
| pointed out that "this congress re
! quired an outlay of thousands of
j man-hours, thousands of dollars, and
j a tremendous amount, of planning
and organization. Was. it worth it?"
he asked.
"Many resolutions were passed by
the congress," he explained, "reso
lutions which ought to interest Stan
ford students because they deal with
; areas which should concern them.
But what value is there in just pass
ing a resolution if the students on
I the campus, or even that more in-
I terested group which forms the stu

dent government, don't respond?
"If the work of the NSA congress
is to become effective, then it will i
have to be discussed and acted upon
at the campus level. Each of the
delegates who attended the congress
gained experience and knowledge in
the fields which especially concerned
him.
''The work of the congress is done.
It is up to the NSA co-ordinator,
the delegates to the congress, and
indeed all students on the campus
to make this work worth while."
JIM SAMMET
NSA Co-ordinator Jim Sammet, j
delegate, said: "The importance of
the congress was twofold. First, it
provided the opportunity for student
leaders, not only from the United j
States but also from foreign coun- j
tries, to meet together to discuss j
their common problems," in this way
better preparing these people for
their campus jobs.
"The second important aspect of
the congress was the creation of the
policy which will guide the newly
elected national officers of NSA."
AL WILSON
A 1 Wilson, president of the Cali
fornia-Nevada-Hawaii region of the
NSA, who represented the region
on the 27-man National Executive
Committee, stated: "My observations
on the congress are, on the whole,
very favorable.
"There was an air of idealism
coupled with practicality through
out the entire affair. The congress
is the voice of the American student.
"The important principle of the
congress is the student movement
concept.
"The congress 'educated' the dele
gates from Stanford in this concept,
whether they are for it or against it.
With this 'education' the delegates
working for NSA on campus hope
to implement some or all of the con
gress ideas and principles."
ERIC FRICKER
Administrative Assistant Eric
Flicker, delegate, said, "It is unfor
tunate that the good things about
the convention are often clouded by
the poor ones." He pointed out that
he gained little from his sub-com
mission meetings and the discussions
on the plenary floor.
"The greatest advantage," he con
cluded, "was in meeting other stu
dents and talking with them about
student government and nearly ev

ery other subject. It was a wonder
ful experience, but I question wheth
er each Stanford student should
have to pay for my trip."
JOHN FLORIDA
Institute of International Relations
Vice-President John Florida, dele
gate, said: "Basically, I believe that
most of us, after meeting student
officers and exchanging ideas
throughout the conference, gradu
ally realized that NSA is the only
real national student voice in the
United States.
"Members of other national stu
dent unions throughout the world
are extremely eager -to establish re
lations with us.
"In establishing relations between
their respective schools, our student
leaders will not only show the work
ings of young democracy to foreign
visitors, but, equally important, will
get to meet each other and learn
more about their own country."
DAVE BROWN WOOD
Daily Staff Editor Dave Brown
wood, delegate, believes: "The con
gress is valuable to the extent that
the participant makes it valuable.
As with anything else, one benefits
in direct proportion to his contribu
tion.
"All the Stanford delegates con
tributed to the congress, and there
fore benefited from it. Here lies the
benefit to Stanford.
"The ideas and attitudes the par
ticipants contributed improved the
Stanford reputation; the new out
looks and new thoughts the partici
pants acquired should benefit the
campus at most levels of student
activity."
DICK ELKUS
Assistant NSA Co-ordinator Dick
Elkus, alternate, said: "Those who
attend the congress | are | greatly
| benefited | by the information and
experience gained.
"Though at many points it was

evident that parliamentary proce
dure and other implementation at
times overshadowed the basic issues,
all the seemingly wasted work was
justified by a more thoughtful, learn
ed and experienced student body.
"I endorse NSA. One may not
always agree with some of its policy,
but one must always agree with its
principle: a more nationally and in
ternationally minded student body
and, what is more important, a bet
ter understanding of student life and
problems throughout the world."
ELLIE KRONFELD
AWS Vice-President Ellie Kron
feld, alternate, points out that "when
the NSA congress is voting on mat
ters that are concerned with either
| student| activities or academics, the
vote does not represent the will of
students all over the nation, but ra
ther the will of a majority of stu
dent leaders."
Speaking of the congress in gen
eral, Miss Kronfeld said, "|lt | is a
marvelous opportunity to exchange
ideas with people from other schools
and to gain an understanding of na
tional issues |such as desegregation]
and their significance."
Other participants in the congress
were Political Union Vice-President
Dick Lee, alternate, and Cosmo Club
President Erdogan Altan, represent
ative to the pre-congress Foreign
Student Leaders Conference.
