girls add nothing
'Jo the Editor:
What is wrong wiih our pom-porn girl.-? At the
hit loo thai 1 game the stands displayed good spirit,
hut the girls, as usual, added nothing. The cheering
.'.oction of every -school that we play is supplemented
hy girls of greater enthusiasm and activity. Our girls
dunce at a walk. . . . They move their hands in
time to the music, but if this is all they can do, why
have them?
It is not our aim to cause the removal of pom-pom
■ iris from the entertainment of our future games but
rather to suggest the possibility of a more inspired
and active group of song leaders.

unprincipled suppression
To the Editor:
Deeply moved by the spirit of ''Back to the Farm''
Week. I rushed into training last Wednesday and con
tracted to appear on the Sunken Diamond on GAMES
DAY. Modesty, of course, forbids a faculty member
to publicize the score of the faculty-student softball
game, but I cannot condone your unprincipled sup
pression of the news.
You have betrayed your readers' trust in The
Daily as a newspaper which will keep them informed.
The Stanford Family has a right to know not only
that Major George Racey Jordan will address the
Political Union, that "Scientist Sees Uses for Atoms,"
that '"Runners will Carry Smudge Pot to Rudy's This
Afternoon," but also that GAMES DAY was a great
success.
You cannot suppress the facts. The people will
learn them. The game was played Thursday before
an enthusiastic throng: one faculty wife and one fac
ulty child. This partisan crowd, though perhaps un
sure of how the game welcomed the student body
back to the Farm, was at least not disappointed in
the outcome. *
The size of the audience demonstrates once again

that Stanford students —who, as 1 write, are compet
ing in Olympic Day games at Rudy's—are not ad
dicted to spectator .spoils; that they prefer athletics
to athleticism.

(Editor's note: We deny any attempt to suppress
the news. Bui was this news? And if so, was it an
item for page one or for sports page? Page one
staff insisted that an event's ability to draw at the
gate should be the criterion for page one coverage.
Sports staff refused to concede that the contest
could he classified as an athletic event.
(Obviously, the editorial column is not the place
to report the result. But for the sake of good, thor
ough journalism, and in case anyone besides Mr.
Levin cares: Faculty 11, Students D.)
a big thanks
To the Editor:
A big thanks to all faculty and students for joining
in "Back to the Farm" Week. We believe that this
week's potential has now been more fully realized,
thanks to all of you, and that the participation and
spirit developed are the very heart of "Back to the
Farm" Week.
We hope that in succeeding years "Back to the
Farm" Week and other similar activities will bring
us all closer to the original Stanford spirit, close stu
dent-faculty relations on all levels.
Thanks again.
