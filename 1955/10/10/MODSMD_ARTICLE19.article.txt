### 
THIS WEEK is Homecoming Weak at the
Farm, to be climaxed by the game Saturday
with UCLA, and to get the festivities off to a
flying start the social calendar square for today
is a nice, eye-catching empty white square.
But weep no more; the Biology Department has
not been idle. They have sheathed their scal
pels long enough to prepare an intriguing op
portunity for pleasure - jaded Indians, their
squaws and their papooses to beguile the idle
hours this afternoon with a seminar on "Ex
perimental Studies of Sensory Pathways in the
Spinal Cord."
The program is slated for 4:15 in Room 430
and will be presided over by E. D. Gardner,
M.D., an interloper from Wayne University.
Dr. Gardner, it may interest you to know, has
been compared by a reliable source in the de
partment to the immortal Bryan. But to learn
how the good doctor was compared to the Sil
ver-tongued O., you must attend the thing.
Sneaky, no?

THOSE OF US who have gone weekending
to Tijuana "just to look around, of course" will
be interested to learn that an asst. prof in min
eralogy has been down there doing a little
observing, too. Matter of fact, he (Dr. Mike
Wyatt) is going to give a little talk about his trip
this afternoon (this competition between de
partments for campus attention has got to stop)
at 4 in Room 320. It's called "Geologic Obser
vations in Baja California." Bring your I.D.
TUESDAY SERIES bill tomorrow night fea
tures Professor Rom Landau of the American
Academy of Asian Studies in a talk in "French
North Africa—Second Indochina." It's at 7:30
in Mem Aud and should be very interesting.
This guy's reputed to know whereof he speaks.

THERE IS a lecture of rather limited interest
planned for the Wednesday afternoon Matinee
in the Little Theater. Something to do with play
direction. Go if you want to, though . . .
THURSDAY IS another big day on Quad.
Aside from some intellectual horsing around
in the Physics Department, the sole attraction
is another of those exciting Distaff Club lunch
eons. Nothing like a big, week-long celebra
tion to crowd the old calendar.
FRIDAY, THOUGH, things begin to look up
(they just about got to, with only two days left
in the week). There's the float parade and judg
ing at 7:30 p.m., followed by the UCLA game
r — y (don't forget the cotton for your ears,
girls) at 9, and which in turn is followed by
something called the "ICC Dance" at 10.
SATURDAY AT 2, Coach Chuck's boys take
on the gang from UCLA, and what with one
thing and another it ought to be quite a game.
In addition to Mr. Shuchat's really impressive
Stanford Band, the winning Homecoming floats
will also be paraded during the half-time. Bet
ter plan to be there.
FLICK SUNDAY is "Laura," with Clifton
Webb and Gene Tierney. We haven't seen it
and to date haven't found anybody who has.
Regardless of the merits of the picture, this is
something new . . .

AND NOW, to cheer you up and send you
on your way with a smile on your face and a
song in your heart, we give you our Fact for
the Week. According to the Agriculture De
partment, North Dakota's cattle population con
tinued its upward trend for the fourth straight
year in 1954!

THIS WEEK is Homecoming Weak at the
Farm, to be climaxed by the game Saturday
with UCLA, and to get the festivities off to a
flying start the social calendar square for today
is a nice, eye-catching empty white square.
But weep no more; the Biology Department has
not been idle. They have sheathed their scal
pels long enough to prepare an intriguing op
portunity for pleasure - jaded Indians, their
squaws and their papooses to beguile the idle
hours this afternoon with a seminar on "Ex
perimental Studies of Sensory Pathways in the
Spinal Cord."
The program is slated for 4:15 in Room 430
and will be presided over by E. D. Gardner,
M.D., an interloper from Wayne University.
Dr. Gardner, it may interest you to know, has
been compared by a reliable source in the de
partment to the immortal Bryan. But to learn
how the good doctor was compared to the Sil
ver-tongued O., you must attend the thing.
Sneaky, no?

THOSE OF US who have gone weekending
to Tijuana "just to look around, of course" will
be interested to learn that an asst. prof in min
eralogy has been down there doing a little
observing, too. Matter of fact, he (Dr. Mike
Wyatt) is going to give a little talk about his trip
this afternoon (this competition between de
partments for campus attention has got to stop)
at 4 in Room 320. It's called "Geologic Obser
vations in Baja California." Bring your I.D.
TUESDAY SERIES bill tomorrow night fea
tures Professor Rom Landau of the American
Academy of Asian Studies in a talk in "French
North Africa—Second Indochina." It's at 7:30
in Mem Aud and should be very interesting.
This guy's reputed to know whereof he speaks.

THERE IS a lecture of rather limited interest
planned for the Wednesday afternoon Matinee
in the Little Theater. Something to do with play
direction. Go if you want to, though . . .
THURSDAY IS another big day on Quad.
Aside from some intellectual horsing around
in the Physics Department, the sole attraction
is another of those exciting Distaff Club lunch
eons. Nothing like a big, week-long celebra
tion to crowd the old calendar.
FRIDAY, THOUGH, things begin to look up
(they just about got to, with only two days left
in the week). There's the float parade and judg
ing at 7:30 p.m., followed by the UCLA game
r — y (don't forget the cotton for your ears,
girls) at 9, and which in turn is followed by
something called the "ICC Dance" at 10.
SATURDAY AT 2, Coach Chuck's boys take
on the gang from UCLA, and what with one
thing and another it ought to be quite a game.
In addition to Mr. Shuchat's really impressive
Stanford Band, the winning Homecoming floats
will also be paraded during the half-time. Bet
ter plan to be there.
FLICK SUNDAY is "Laura," with Clifton
Webb and Gene Tierney. We haven't seen it
and to date haven't found anybody who has.
Regardless of the merits of the picture, this is
something new . . .

AND NOW, to cheer you up and send you
on your way with a smile on your face and a
song in your heart, we give you our Fact for
the Week. According to the Agriculture De
partment, North Dakota's cattle population con
tinued its upward trend for the fourth straight
year in 1954!
