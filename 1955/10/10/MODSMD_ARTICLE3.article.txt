## Kremlin Struggle Looms 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 (UP) â€”A new struggle for Russia's top
leadership may be under way among the Kremlin's "collective"
rulers, diplomatic sources said today.
They said Soviet Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov's dramatic
public "apology" may be the latest step in a behind-the-scenes

battle to succeed the late Josef Sta-'
lin as Russia's No. 1 boss.
Molotov's "sin" was to say that
Russia has built only "the founda
tion" of a socialistic system, instead
of following Communist dogma that
this goal already has been achieved.
U. S. diplomats generally believe
Molotov is on the way out as one of
the triumvirate that has been re
garded as wielding most of the
power in Russia in recent months.
