HERLESHAUSEN, Germ a n y—
Some 800 German soldiers and civil
ians, crammed into cattle cars, rat
tled through the Iron Curtain to
freedom here today, dirty, unkempt
and half-starved after days without
food or water.
The harsh Communist treatment
of enlisted men and low-ranking
officers, freed after years in Soviet
slave camps, contrasted sharply with
the de luxe accommodations given
the 90 Nazi generals«who were re
turned here last week.
Red Cross girls circulated through
the cars with coffee for the return
ees, many of whom seemed unable
to speak. They sat, shocked and
staring, while silent tears poured
down their cheeks.
