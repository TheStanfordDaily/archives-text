From far-flung corners of Quad,
here's what professors are saying:
Alexander Naughton, associate pro
fessor of Romanic languages, on
King Henry IV of France: "He can
be compared to our own Herbert
Hooverâ€”| both believed in] a chick
en in every pot."
David C. Regnery, associate pro
fessor of biology, on chemists: "More
work has been done with carbo
hydrates and proteins than with fats,
because chemists don't mind being
called carbohydrate chemists and
protein chemists, but few want to
be called fat chemists."
James B. Whitlow, assistant teach
er of French, on the romance lan
guages: "Th e romance languages
have nothing to do with moonlight
and the cactus gardens."
Thomas A. Bailey, professor of
American history, on cigarettes: "We
beat our No Smoking signs into ash
trays. It's an American tradition."
