WASHINGTONâ€”HaroId E. Stas
sen all but said today that he would
be willing to accept the 1956 Rcpub

lican presidential nomination if Pres
ident Eisenhower tapped him for the
assignment.
The 48-year-old former Minnesota
governor, now Mr. Eisenhower's spe
cial adviser on disarmament, pref
aced his statement, however, with an
expression of hope that the Presi
dent will seek re-election.
He said the people want the Presi
dent's programs and policies "car
ried further."
Stassen, who appeared on the NBC
TV program "Youth Wants to
Know," was asked point-blank if he
would accept the Republican presi
dential nomination if Mr. Eisen
hower does not run.
Stassen, a GOP presidential con
tender at the last three conventions,
did not reply directly. But he said
he "would wish to do what the Pres
ident would want me to do."
