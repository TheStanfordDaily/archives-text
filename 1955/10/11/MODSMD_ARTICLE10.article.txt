WASHINGTONâ€”Two pioneers in
the coronary field urged President
Eisenhower's physicians today to
consider heart surgery to extend the
Chief Executive's life expectancy
and permit him to carry a bigger
work load.
The recommendation was advanc
ed by Dr. Claude S. Beck, professor
of cardio-vascular surgery at West
ern Reserve University in Cleveland,
and Dr. Bernard L. Brofman, direc
tor of cardio-vascular research at
Cleveland's Mount Sinai Hospital.
Brofman said that, on the basis of
statistics, Mr. Eisenhower probably
will suffer another heart attack.
