## 
### 
CASABLANCA. Morocco — Anti
nationalist French settlers closed
shops and offices in Moroccan cities
today in a "warning strike" against
Premier Edgar Faure's reform plan
for this protectorate.
The "strike" was called by the
powerful rightwing "Presence Fran
cais" (French Presence) organiza
tion, which claims to represent 88
per cent of all French residents in
Morocco.
The settlers' organization bitterly
opposed the ousting of Sultan Sidi
Mohammed Ben Moulay Arafa and
is now trying to block the formation
of a three-man throne council to
replace the Sultan.
Andre Franchi, military chief of
the Casablanca region, bluntly warn
ed settlers he would condone no vio
lence or interference with business.
But officials admitted privately the
army would not turn weapons on
Frenchmen, as was demonstrated
last July 15 when European mobs
roamed the city at will and lynched
a number of Moroccans.
The settlers' strike officially began
at midnight.
