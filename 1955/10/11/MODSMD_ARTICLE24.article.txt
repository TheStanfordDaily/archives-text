# Work Begins On New Roads
## 
### 
Work has started on the first link
of a peripheral road which will
eventually encircle the group of
Stanford buildings.
The University has let a $51,000
contract to Oscar C. Holmes, Inc.,
Redwood City, to construct 4,800
feet of two-lane road, beginning at
Arguello St.and Alvarado Row,
and curving around the men's resi
dence hall area until it joins Pine
Ave. near the men's gymnasium.
The work should be finished by
Nov. 30.
An existing section of Pine Ave.
will carry the route to Palm Drive,
the main entry road to the campus.
When completed as part of the
University's long-range campus de
velopment plan, the peripheral road
will follow the present Arguello
St.from Alvarado Row to La
suen, then embrace the women's
residence area and science buildings
on the west side of the campus, and
complete the circle by rejoining
Palm Drive at the Pine intersection.
Access roads from the peripheral
thoroughfare will carry traffic into
various campus areas.
The portion of Arguello running
between Wilbur and Stern halls and
between Toyon and Crothers Memo
rial halls has been closed to autos
and is being converted to a 16-foot
pedestrian path.
Bahr & Ledoyen, Palo Alto, are
reconstructing the section of Es
condido Road which runs in front
of Wilbur Hall. Curbs, sidewalks,
drainage, and street lighting at*e in
cluded in the $32,000 contract. The
job is expected to take about two
more weeks.
