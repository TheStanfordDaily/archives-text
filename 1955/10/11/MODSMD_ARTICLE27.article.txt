# an old story

### 
It's an old slory around here. Chief Gordon
Davis periodically pleads with the students.
Don't drive to class, he says. But people do
anyway. Then when they can't find a place to
"f.ark or they get tied up in traffic jams, they
scream and rant at the University for lack of
facilities.
The situation is not going to get better for
a few years. There are more cars, no more
parking spaces, fewer roads to drive on. Per
haps when the University gets its road network
realigned, much of the problem will be solved
- you won't be able to park close enough to
Quad to make the driving worth v/hile.
Even now, it's often not worth while. Diago
nal parking near the Quad can be found only
with luck. The library lot is usually packed and
passage is snarled. Spots are few and off in
the distance in the lot across from Physics
Corner and the lot near the Health Service

entrance. Only the triangular lot next to Stern
offers a place to park consistently—and that's
only because no one seems to want to park
there —too far to walk.
At ten minutes to the hour, the bell rings
and the rush is on. Drive to your next class.
Drive around in circles looking for a place to
park. Get tied up in traffic of a couple of hun
dred other people doing the same thing. You
could have walked it faster and it would have
been easier on the nerves.
Chief Davis just about covers it: don't drive
to classes. If you live on campus, don't drive
to classes. By the time you find a place to park,
you could have been in class already.
And the parking place you do occupy means
one less place for the student who lives in the
Village or off campus—the student who has
to drive.
