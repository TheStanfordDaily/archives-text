Students at the University of Washington
are hopping mad at the administration.
According to the University of Washington
Daily, "The controversy was prompted by Uni
versity action last spring when administration
officials presented a revised constitution to the
student Board of Control.
The move aroused an immediate storm of
protest since the document gives students vir
tually-no voice in approval of the ASUW budg
et nor does it allow student representatives an
active voice in the direction of Washington
athletics.
Kurt Karmin, Interfraternity Council presi
dent, declared, "Here the nation is crying for
leaders, and they v/on't let us handle anything
more vital than school dances and minor ac
tivities. I'd rather see a legal battle over the
administration's right to dictate our constitu
tion to us, than just sit back and continually
compromise."
However, last Thursday's Washington Daily
indicated that compromise between the two
rj/oups would be the probable outcome.

Our neighbors across the bay are having
their traditional troubles with the men's rooting
section. The Cal boys got a little out of hand
during the Penn game a week and a half ago.
As a consequence, the student executive com
n.ittoe came close to'abolishing the section.
The men's executive board responded by
voting in a program to better the lads' behavior.
The board voted (1) to accept'and support
the Interfraternity Council's plan for punishing
offending fraternity members sitting in the
men's section, (2) to encourage the Men's Resi
dence Association to follow a program similar
to the IFC's, and (3) to underscore rally commit
tee's authority to remove from the stadium root
ers who violate the good conduct expected of
them.

It seems that a University of Oregoa sopho
more is upset over the attire of Oregon's yell
leaders. In a letter to the Daily Emerald he de
clared in part:

"Those who attended the game Saturday at
Portland were probably as much surprised as
I was to see the boy cheer leaders wearing
short pants.
"A lady on my right commented, 'They've
got a lot of intestinal fortitude to get out there
before God and everyone else in those short
pants.'
"Here is one vote in favor of dropping the
short pants and otherwise representing our
school to the best of our ability."

Pat Morris, a USC coed, must still be beat
ing her head against the wall in anguish be
cause in 20 fateful seconds Friday night she
lost a chance to pick up $100,000.
As a stunt on the TV show "Truth or Conse
quences," Pat was placed in a chair next to a
table on which lay the SlOO.OOO. She was then
hynotized by a professional hypnotist and told
not to get up from the chair.
She then had 20 seconds to disobey the
order and pick up the money. She couldn't
get up from the chair and had to settle for a
$1,000 consolation prize.

Last week three USC students decided they'd
like to have a telephone chat with Russia's roly
poly Communist boss Nikita Kruschev and
were almost successful.
As one of them put it, "We thought we would
congratulate him on the lessening of tension
between our two countries and also tell him
of our hope for better student exchange pro
grams between America and Russia."
They got Kruschev's personal secretary who
answered, "Misier Kruschev is not in today.
May I take a message?"
