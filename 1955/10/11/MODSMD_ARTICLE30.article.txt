## Lee Expects Demos To Work at Local, State, National Levels

"The purpose of Young Dem
ocrats is to make people feel
that they are a part of the whole
political machinery," according
to Dick Lee, president of the
Stanford area group.
He emphasized the fact that in
order to have a full political life a
person must be part of all levels of
his party: local, state, and national.
In carrying out this philosophy,
Lee is planning work in various
fields relating to the coming elec
tion. Members will aid in registra
tion proceedings, participate in po
litical action workshops, and attend
several conventions, among them the
state platform convention to be held
in November.
On the question of the Democratic
nomination, Lee feels that the nomi
nating convention will be wide open,
and thai neither the Stevenson nor
the Harriman faction-is completely
confident of victory.
When asked his preference for
presidential candidates, Lee said he
considers Adlai Stevenson one of
the "great men of the, country," but
that, personally, his support goes to
the man who could win, "as it is
most important that the next Presi
dent be a Democrat."
As for the opposing party, he is
quite sure that President Eisenhow
er will not seek re-election, but that,
if he does, he will be incapable of
victory because of his health.
Lee also commented that ''it is
highly appropriate the convention
is being held in California, because
Lhe candidate will probably be from
California."
Lee, as he enters his junior year,
is carrying a double major in both
history and humanities as a prepar
ation for law school. He would like
to use his training "to work on the
political structure in a non-political
way."
Among his numerous activities,
the president of the Young Demo
crats of the Stanford Area includes
the vice-presidency of the Political
Union, manager of the Affiliations
Department of the lIR, and a mem
ber of the undergraduate comrtnittee
of the Study of Undergraduate Edu
cation.
