# Nye Plans Social, Educational Activities For GOP Supporters
## 
### 
Stanford's Young GOP sup
porters are scheduled for a year
of "social and educational ac
tivities" during the 1955-56
season, according to President
Steve Nye.
In an interview, Nye explained
that because this is an off-election
year the Republican group plans in
clude meetings with national Con
gressmen and committeemen, with
question - and - answer sessions de
signed to give an inside look at party
mechanics.
Nye describes the Stanford Area
group as "a training ground for fu
ture party leadership and also an
educational and social organization.
"Kids come to Stanford, and per
haps 95 per cent of them consider
themselves Republicans. Their par
ent?, most of their relatives are Re
publicans. Well, that's good.
"Then," he went on, "they take a
few Western Civ courses, or So
ciology courses, and they start get
ting confused." The Young GOP
group tries to remind them of what
Republicanism stands for.
This activity takes the form of
campaign work, doing the small,
time-consuming jobs so important in
any political race. Nye mentioned
a letter received last year from Con
gressman Do 11 wig thanking the
group and expressing the opinion
that their work was a deciding fac
tor in his campaign.
In past years, Nye said, the Stan
ford Area chapter has been very
active at county and state conven
tions, where the number of members
in each chapter determines the num
ber of delegates it may send.
Nye, backed up by Folly Mac Do
nald, vice-president; Gracia Blaettler,
secretary, and Ron Larson, treas
urer, is, by himself, holding down
the job of president, usually filled
by two students.
He gained the post last March
while still a freshman, drawing part
ly on his experiences before coming
to Stanford. He has served on vari
ous Republican organizations and
spent considerable time speaking be
fore service clubs around his home
in Medford County, Oregon.
