## HURRAY FOR THE RED, WHITE AND GOLD! 
### Author of "Barefoot Boy With Cheek," etc 
There's a new package on Philip Morris Cigarettes. It's red
and white and gold and pretty as a picture. You'd never guess
that behind anything so bright and cheerful is a saga packed
with action and passion, with love and romance and not a
few tears.
It started quietly enough. The makers of gentle Philip Morris,
as hale a bunch of fellows as you ever clapped your eyes upon, got
to talking last summer during their annual outing on Attu, a
secluded and unspoiled island, often called "The Capri of Alaska."
Capri, on the other hand, is often called "The of Italy."

But I digress. 1 was saying that the makers of Philip Morris,
jim-dandy fellows every man-jack of them, got to talking on their
last outing. "Don't you think," said one maker to the other
makers, "that our brown Philip Morris package, though in many
ways terribly fetching, doesn't quite reflect the basic quality of
today's Philip Morris—its happy gentleness, its jolly lightness?"
"Why, yes," replied the other makers to the first maker, "we
do think that our brown Philip Morris package, though in many
ways terribly fetching, doesn't quite reflect the basic quality of
today's Philip Morris-its happy gentleness, its jolly lightness."
"Let us have the pack re-designed!" suggested the first maker,
whose name is Laughing Ned.
"Yes, let us!" cried the other makers, whose name is Fun-
Loving Tom. "Let us! Let us! Let us!"
The makers forthwith engaged the prominent firm of package
re-designers, Sigafoos and Associates. It was with full con
fidence that the makers entrusted the task to Sigafoos* and
Associates, for Sterling Sigafoos, the senior member, is known
the length and breadth of the world as "The Grand Old Man of
Package Re-designing," and his partner, Fred Associates,
though a younger man, is everywhere regarded as a comer.
Sigafoos and Associates began their job by conducting inter
views from coast to coast to determine what kind of pack people
wanted for Philip Morris. The partners could not do the inter
viewing themselves — Sigafoos because of his advanced years;
Associates because he is subject to motion sickness — so they
sent our two trusted employees: Mr. Walker Nylet (Yale '51)
and Miss Felicia Sigafoos (Radclifife '52), daughter of the
senior partner. After canvassing the entire nation and tabulat ing
more than 90 million interviews, Mr. Nylet sent the following
communique to the home office:
"Dear Dad and Associates,
I call you Dad because Miss Sigafoos and I discovered
during our long and exhaustive survey that never were two
people so admirably suited. We have accordingly been
married and have accepted a position with the United States
Government keeping the lighthouse off Gay Head, Martha's
Vineyard.
I hope you are not too upset by this news. May I suggest
you look at it this way: you haven't lost a daughter; you've
gained a beacon.
Sincerely,
Walker Nylet"
Well sir, old Sigatoos fumed for a while, but at last he calmed
down and went to visit the newlyweds in their lighthouse, bring
ing them a suitcase full of twenties as a wedding gift. It was
there he learned that people want Philip Morris in the red, white,
and gold package which you are now, I trust, holding in your
very own hand. ® M " e " 1,llD,4n> 1955
The makers of PHILIP MORRIS who bring you this column beg to
remind you that for a uhile you'll still he seeing Philip Morris both
ways — in the bright new red, while anil gold package, and in the
friendly familiar brown.

and gold package which you are now, I trust, holding in your
very own hand. ® M " e " 1,llD,4n> 1955
The makers of PHILIP MORRIS who bring you this column beg to
remind you that for a uhile you'll still he seeing Philip Morris both
ways — in the bright new red, while anil gold package, and in the
friendly familiar brown.


There's a new package on Philip Morris Cigarettes. It's red
and white and gold and pretty as a picture. You'd never guess
that behind anything so bright and cheerful is a saga packed
with action and passion, with love and romance and not a
few tears.
It started quietly enough. The makers of gentle Philip Morris,
as hale a bunch of fellows as you ever clapped your eyes upon, got
to talking last summer during their annual outing on Attu, a
secluded and unspoiled island, often called "The Capri of Alaska."
Capri, on the other hand, is often called "The of Italy."

But I digress. 1 was saying that the makers of Philip Morris,
jim-dandy fellows every man-jack of them, got to talking on their
last outing. "Don't you think," said one maker to the other
makers, "that our brown Philip Morris package, though in many
ways terribly fetching, doesn't quite reflect the basic quality of
today's Philip Morris—its happy gentleness, its jolly lightness?"
"Why, yes," replied the other makers to the first maker, "we
do think that our brown Philip Morris package, though in many
ways terribly fetching, doesn't quite reflect the basic quality of
today's Philip Morris-its happy gentleness, its jolly lightness."
"Let us have the pack re-designed!" suggested the first maker,
whose name is Laughing Ned.
"Yes, let us!" cried the other makers, whose name is Fun-
Loving Tom. "Let us! Let us! Let us!"
The makers forthwith engaged the prominent firm of package
re-designers, Sigafoos and Associates. It was with full con
fidence that the makers entrusted the task to Sigafoos* and
Associates, for Sterling Sigafoos, the senior member, is known
the length and breadth of the world as "The Grand Old Man of
Package Re-designing," and his partner, Fred Associates,
though a younger man, is everywhere regarded as a comer.
Sigafoos and Associates began their job by conducting inter
views from coast to coast to determine what kind of pack people
wanted for Philip Morris. The partners could not do the inter
viewing themselves — Sigafoos because of his advanced years;
Associates because he is subject to motion sickness — so they
sent our two trusted employees: Mr. Walker Nylet (Yale '51)
and Miss Felicia Sigafoos (Radclifife '52), daughter of the
senior partner. After canvassing the entire nation and tabulat ing
more than 90 million interviews, Mr. Nylet sent the following
communique to the home office:
"Dear Dad and Associates,
I call you Dad because Miss Sigafoos and I discovered
during our long and exhaustive survey that never were two
people so admirably suited. We have accordingly been
married and have accepted a position with the United States
Government keeping the lighthouse off Gay Head, Martha's
Vineyard.
I hope you are not too upset by this news. May I suggest
you look at it this way: you haven't lost a daughter; you've
gained a beacon.
Sincerely,
Walker Nylet"
Well sir, old Sigatoos fumed for a while, but at last he calmed
down and went to visit the newlyweds in their lighthouse, bring
ing them a suitcase full of twenties as a wedding gift. It was
there he learned that people want Philip Morris in the red, white,
and gold package which you are now, I trust, holding in your
very own hand. ® M " e " 1,llD,4n> 1955
