## BACKTALK

MICHIGAN STATE 38, STANFORD It
. The Big Ten completely avenged its injured pride in this game but it
is difTi"ult to figure whether or not Michigan State is really a team that is
four touchdowns better than Stanford. According to Chuck Taylor, the
Spartans would have won by two touchdowns even if the Indians had
played as well as they did against Ohio State.
Stanford set up three MSC touchdowns by fumbling but the Spartans
got the bad breaks in the penalties department as they were set back 110
yards to only five for Stanford.
The score probably wouldn't have been so bad, however, if the Indians
had been expecting a passing attack. The Spartans, who before Saturday
had scared no one with their passing, really exploded against Stanford
with seven completions in nine attempts for 191 yards. The Spartans' aerial
successes also paved the way for their running backs as Stanford had to
open up its defense to cope with the accurate pitching of the MSC quarter
backs.
What the outcome means to Stanford is anybody's guess. So far this
year, the Indians have been playing cycle footballâ€”good one Saturday and
poor the next. The key to the cycle seems to lie in the Stanford passing
attack. In all lour games this season the Indians have put together a solid
ground offensive, but the passing has been alternately good and bad. When
the Indians have had a good day in the air, they've won and. vice versa,
when they've had a poor day in the air, they've lost.
If the cycle holds true, Stanford will be due for a good game against
UCLA next Saturday. The Indians will also have precedent on their side
as Chuck Taylor has never lost to the Bruins in Stanford Stadium.
WASHINGTON 7. SOUTHERN CAL 0
This was the real stunner on the Pacific Coast. What is really amazing
is that the Huskies' victory over heavily favored USC was no fluke. Wash
ington threw up a stone wall on defense and showed as much offensive
power as the Trojans.
Twice Troy moved inside the Huskies' JO and both times they were
stopped. Washington on one occasion got down to Southern Cal's seven
yard line before being halted. The game's lone touchdown came in the
final period on a spectacular 82-yard pass lateral play from quarterback
Steve Roake to end Jim Houston to end Corky Lewis.
Although it rained heavily throughout the game, the footing remained
good. Nevertheless, Troy could not spring its speedy backs loose against
the Huskies.
Washington is still unbeaten and now bears considerable, weight in the
Rose Bowl race.
UCLA :!S. OREGON STATE 0
Oregon State played a creditable game against the Bruins until superior
manpower wore them down in the last half. The Beavers, who went into
the game with two surprise victories under theh - belts, held the heavily
favored Bruins to a 13-0 half-time lead.
UCLA capitalized on three poor punts and a pass interception to score
twice in each of the last two quarters to sew up the game.
This game, as well as the UCLA State game last week, has
seen the emergence of Sam "First Down' 1 Brown as a consistently sharp
tailback. There is now considerable question whether even a healthy
Ronnie Knox is going to move Brown out of the first-string spot. What
would Harvey say?
CAL 20, WASHINGTON STATE 20
This battle of the have-nots figured to be close and close it was. Cal
battled back in the last quarter after trailing 20-13 to tie the score only
to see WSC march right back down to the Bears' six-yard line before
fumbling the ball away.
Cal had it all over the Cougars in the statistics column but, strangely
enough, it always was the Bears who were scrambling from behind.
Cal showed a sharp passing attack under the direction of quarterbacks
Hugh McGuire and Gus Gianulus and some good running. Washington
State had standouts in quarterback Bob Iverson, end Arnie Pelleur, and
tackle Tom Gunnari.
COLORADO 13, OREGON (5
Oregon missed a nice chance to pick up an impressive intersectional
win by fumbling the ball in crucial spots. Twice the Ducks fumbled over
the ball inside the Colorado 10-yard line. On both occasions the fumble
occurred as the Oregon quarterback was hit as he was moving out of the
split T formation to lateral out to his halfbacks.
Colorado tailback Homer Jenkins ran well as did Duck halfbacks Dick
James and Jim Shanley.
