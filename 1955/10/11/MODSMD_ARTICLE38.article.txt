# Harrington, Lewis Hurt In Rough Scrimmage
## 
### BOB MIEROW 
Sub fullback A 1 Harrington re-injured his aching ankle and re
serve quarterback Jack Lewis was spiked in the leg yesterday as
Coach Chuck Taylor sent his varsity substitutes through a rugged
scrimmage.
The recurring injury to the Samoan fullback has forced Taylor

to switch starting halfback Ernie
Dorn to full. The Tribe mentor dis
closed that Jeri McMillin may open
at Dorn's right half post against
UCLA Saturday.
Should McMillin start against the
Bruins from Westwood, it would
mark the first time this season that
a sophomore had dotted the Indians'
lineup at kickoff time.
Tackle Bob Seymour will miss
Saturday's contest with the Bruins
because of a broken hand sustained
in a scrimmage last week. Trainer
Connie Jarvis reported that no one
was injured in the Spartan en
counter.
Taylor declared after yesterday's
workout that he didn't know wheth
er UC L A's famed Ronnie Knox
would see action Saturday.
Should Knox figure in the Bruins'
plans, Stanford can expect a strong
Uclan passing game. Otherwise, Sam
(First Down) Brown, a strong run
ner but weak passer, will work at
tailback.
