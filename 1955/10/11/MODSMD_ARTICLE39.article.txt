# Held Suffers Ankle Injury
## 
### United Press 
The Rev. Franklin (Bud) Held,
who smashed his own world record
in the javelin throw last May despite
a bad ankle, said yesterday that bone
trouble has made him a question
mark in the 1956 Olympics.
"The doctor told me I was suffer
ing either from bone chips in the
right ankle or a growth," Held dis
closed. "As a result, I have been
favoring it ever since July. It aches
at nights sometimes."
Held said his physician indicated
it might be possible to perform an
operation, but added, "Not unless it
is absolutely necessary."
"My plan now is to test the ankle
for a few weeks, then go back to
the physician and see what we'll do
next," the young Presbyterian min
ister said.
Held said he became hobbled last
May during an all-comers meet in
San Jose while competing on hard
ground.
Yet he broke his old world mark
of 263 feet 10 inches a few days
after the San Jose meet with a heave
of 268 feet 2 7 /s inches at the Cali
fornia Relavs in Modesto.
