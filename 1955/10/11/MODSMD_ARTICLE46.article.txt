From far-flung corners of Quad,
here's what professors are saying:
Arnaud B. Leavelle, professor of
political science, describing Aris
totle: "| He was | a country boy who
made good in the big city."
Georges E. Lemaitre, professor of
Romanic languages, on contrasting
European values: "The English love
to write anonymous letters. It's a
national pastime. The French —they
would never do that."
Kurt Steincr, acting assistant pro
fessor of political science, on poli
tics: "There are usually more than
two sides to a situation, but in the
case of government offices there are
only two—inside and outside."
11. Lloyd Churchill, associate pro
fessor of journalism, after a poor
class showing on an advertising as
signment: "Don't worry about these
grades; they'll all come out in the
wash. ... I have a special sudsless
detergent that will clean up the
curve."
