# Lines Painted at Campus Corners To Straighten Out Traffic Tangles
## 
### 
White lines are being painted
at most campus intersections as a
part of the current program em
phasizing traffic safety.
The move is necessary because
of the great number of cars on
campus and the resulting traffic
danger, according to Chief of Po
lice Gordon Davis.
The program began recently
with the painting of white lines
300 feet on each side of the Palm
Drive stoplight. Before the lines
were painted, motorists tended to
pull around the stopped cars at

the light, across the middle of
Palm Drive, creating a danger to
oncoming traffic as the light
changed.
The success of the line at the
Palm Drive intersection prompted
University officials to continue the
program on campus, Davis said.
"The white lines," Davis con
tinued, "will help deter drivers
from dangerously cutting corners
at intersections. Lines are being
painted only at intersections, since
it is at these points that most
collisions occur."
Explaining the reasons for not

painting white lines the entire
length of Palm Drive, Chief Davis
said: "In the morning there are
two lanes of tralTic coming toward
campus on Palm Drive. In the
afternoon there are two lanes in
the opposite direction.
"Palm Drive could be made four
lanes, but it would he a rather
tight four lanes. With this set-up.
if one of the lanes should he
blocked, drivers would have to
pull out to the left, over the white
lineâ€”creating a more dangerous
situation than the one at present,
with no lines on the road."
