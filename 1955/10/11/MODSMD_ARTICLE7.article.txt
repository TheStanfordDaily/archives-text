## Wage Dispute Causes Phone Walkout In Northern California-Nevada Area 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 10
(UP)â€”Some 22,000 communica
tions workers went on strike
against the Pacific Telephone <S
Telegraph Company in Northern
California and Nevada today, fol
lowing failure to settle their wage
demands through negotiation.
The telephone company immedi
ately manned the switchboards with
supervisory employees, and the
walkout had no immediate effect on
service except for some delay in
long distance calls.
Three unions were striking against
the company, and their picket lines
were being observed by all other
PT&T unions, thus making the strike
virtually 100 per cent.
The striking unions were the huge
CIO Communications Workers, rep
resenting some 10.000 operators and
7,600 maintenance workers; the In
dependent United Brotherhood of
Telephone Workers, representing 1,-
700 accounting employees, and the
United Brotherhood of Telephone
Workers in Northern California and
Nevada, which represents some 2,500
others.
