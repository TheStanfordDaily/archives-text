# Grid Game Film Slated For Tonight
## 
### 
Toyon Hall will host the first
in a series of five showings of
football movies tonight at 7
o'clock in the lounge.
Sponsored by Cardinals, to
promote closer association between
the students, their football team, and
coaches, tonight's movies of the
Michigan State game will be supple
mented by a discussion session and
refreshments served by Toyon.
Coach Geoxge Lynn will narrate
the film, pointing out significant
plays. Reversing and slowing the
film will be done when necessary.
After the 35-minute movies, Lynn
will answer any questions about the
game.
Following the discussion session,
assistant yell leader George Koenig
will outline some of the plans the
yell leaders have for this year.
Each week the movies and discus
sion groups will be held in a differ
ent location. They are open to all
students free of charge; however,
chairman Bill Matthews urged that
"students living in the vicinity of
each showing are especially invited
to attend."
These movies are an annual proj
ect of Cardinals. Aim of this pro
gram is "to utilize an accurate nar
ration of the film and a discussion
session by assistant coaches to ex
plain the previous week's game, and
to put football personalities on a
more intimate basis with the stu
dents," Matthews said.
