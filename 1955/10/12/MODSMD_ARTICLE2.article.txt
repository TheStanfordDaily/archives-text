# ASSU Nominations Open, Zarifes Enters Veep Race
## 
### 
Fall ASSU nominations opened yesterday for the forthcoming
Oct. 24-28 primaries and finals.
Biggest news in the first day of nomination activities was Helen
Zarifes' entry into the vice-presidential race. Miss Zarifes was de
feated last spring for the office by Jerry Fitzgerald. In the biggest

ASSU election turnout in Stanford'
history, Miss Fitzgerald edged by
Miss Zarifes 1,930 to 1.851. Tonight
Miss Fitzgerald will present her for
mal resignation from the vice-presi
dency to the Legislature,
Campaigning for the offices will
begin Friday at 5 p.m., five hours
after filing for nominations has
closed and the candidates have been
briefed on election procedures.
COMMITTEE SET
An Election Judgment Committee
will be appointed to regulate the
activities and rule on infractions of
election codes. Campaign expendi
tures will be limited. Copies of the
rules and regulations governing the
campaigners' procedures are avail
able to all nominees at the ASSU
office until nomination closing time
at noon Friday. Expense accounts
and nomination blanks are also
available at the ASSU office during
filing hours.
Offices slated to be filled this fall
include legislative representatives
from Roble, Branner, Men's Row,
Village, and Toyon.
CLUB REPRESENTATIVE
The Toyon representative being
elected for the first time will serve
in the Legislature for all eating club
men both on and off campus as well
as the independents now living in
Toyon. Since Toyon will eventually
become a residence for eating club
men only, the ASSU in time hopes
to convert the Toyon representative
into the official eating club repre
sentative.
The only class election up for the
vote this fall will be the choosing of
freshman class officers: president,
vice-president, and business mana
ger.
Two Men's Council and two Wom
en's Council representatives will also
be chosen.
