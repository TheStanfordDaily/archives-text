# Premier Faure Faces Crisis in Assembly
## 
### 
I'AIIISâ€”The French National As
sembly today opened a critical "sec
ond front" debate on Algeria that
endangered the government of Pre
mier Edgar Faure for the second
time in a week.
Communist deputies led off the
assault in the Chamber by attacking
government maneuvers to put down
a revolt by a nationalist "army of
liberation" in the Algerian moun
tains.
The embattled Premier was in for
another fight, but observers saw his
chances of political survival en
hanced by his week-end confidence
victory on his Moroccan reform plan.
