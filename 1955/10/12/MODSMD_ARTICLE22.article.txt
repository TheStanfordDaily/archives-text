SA N FRANCISCO â€” Telephone
service continued at near normal
over most of California and Nevada
today despite a strike by some 22,000
employes of the Pacific Telephone &
Telegraph Co.
The second day of the two-state
strike found both sides hanging fast
to their positions, ancj issuing pre
dictions of victory in the contract
dispute.
The workers, mostly members of
the CIO Communications Workers
Union, representing operators and
maintenance employees, went on
strike at K a.m. yesterday in north
ern California and Nevada, after
negotiators failed to reach a rnntrart,
agreement after .some three months
of bargaining. >
