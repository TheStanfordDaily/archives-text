Twice the Legislature has met this fall. Rou
tine business has been attacked and handled
with reasonable dispatch. Aside from the rou
tine business, nothing else has been attempted.
Actually, there much to do.
Except for one big job: rewriting the by-laws.
That is on the agenda as a coming attraction.
President Gaorge Ralph has mentioned it a
couple of times and let it go at that.
Last year the Executive Committee drew up
a new constitution; the students approved it in
a referendum. With its passage, the new con
stitution made all the by-laws of the ASSU and
its organizations obsolete. At the moment, the
i>y l.iws conflict with the constitution. It's been

so long since they've been overhauled that j
some by-laws even contradict other by-laws.
A revision will require exhaustive work by
the Legislature. A special by-law sub-commit
tee, which Ralph plans to appoint, should be
named quickly and should begin to function
immediately. All organizations subsidiary to
the ASSU should be required to have the by
laws revised and brought up to date by a cer
tain time (say the end of the quarter). The Leg
islature should establish guides to be followed
so that the by-laws will have a semblance of
uniformity.
All this should be started now—before mid
terms—before an unforeseen major issue con
fronts the Legislature.
