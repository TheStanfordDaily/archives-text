From the appearance of Bill Tooley's ASSU
budget, the ASSU is going to come closer to
lipping into the red ink than it has in many
years. Only once in the last 10 years has the
ASSU gone in debt—that was in 1946-47 when
a payment of $25,000 on Memorial Auditorium
pushed the ASSU about 57,500 in the hole.
But this year the budgeting appears to be aw
fully close. Only $827 of the estimated ASSU
income was not budgeted among the various
student body groups, in normal years that un
budgeted surplus—known as the contingency
fund is two or three times as great.
It is the contingency fund with which the
Legislature does most of its work. The body is
constantly dealing with requests io spend Sl5
here and $25.38 somewhere else. The Legis
lature in the past few years has been able to
make special appropriations up to about $2,000.
Not so this year.
Student Financial Manager Tooley wants to
hold down spending from the contingency
fund; he wants to siay in the black. But already
about half of the original surplus has been de

pleted. However, higher registration (the AS
SU gets $1.25 a head) will replenish the fund
somewhat.
One of the most difficult aspects is that it is
impossible to tell at any time just how much
surplus is available. It can only be estimated !
until the year's books are closed in August and 1
added up. Tooley will have to s'ee how closely
income and expenditures correspond with j
budgeted amounts in order to advise the Legis-!
lature on its special allocations.
But throughout the year he will be telling the
Legislature to spend with care. That means it
will be more difficult for student organizations
to exceed their budgets and to receive more
money for new projects.
There will be no crisis, however, if the AS
SU goes into the red. The surpluses from the !
last few profitable years can take up the slack.
I; just isn't good business to allow this to hap
pen. And Tooley feels that when the new stu
dent union is built, the ASSU will need its cur
rent surplus to cover innumerable costs to be
encountered in the process of moving.

fund is two or three times as great.
It is the contingency fund with which the
Legislature does most of its work. The body is
constantly dealing with requests io spend Sl5
here and $25.38 somewhere else. The Legis
lature in the past few years has been able to
make special appropriations up to about $2,000.
Not so this year.
Student Financial Manager Tooley wants to
hold down spending from the contingency
fund; he wants to siay in the black. But already
about half of the original surplus has been de

pleted. However, higher registration (the AS
SU gets $1.25 a head) will replenish the fund
somewhat.
One of the most difficult aspects is that it is
impossible to tell at any time just how much
surplus is available. It can only be estimated !
until the year's books are closed in August and 1
added up. Tooley will have to s'ee how closely
income and expenditures correspond with j
budgeted amounts in order to advise the Legis-!
lature on its special allocations.
But throughout the year he will be telling the
Legislature to spend with care. That means it
will be more difficult for student organizations
to exceed their budgets and to receive more
money for new projects.
There will be no crisis, however, if the AS
SU goes into the red. The surpluses from the !
last few profitable years can take up the slack.
I; just isn't good business to allow this to hap
pen. And Tooley feels that when the new stu
dent union is built, the ASSU will need its cur
rent surplus to cover innumerable costs to be
encountered in the process of moving.
