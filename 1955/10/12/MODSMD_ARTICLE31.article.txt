# 'SUMMERTIME'
## Hepburn, Venice 'Swell,' But Drama Doesn't Jell 
### RICHARD MENDS 
Those who enjoy Venice and Kath
arine Hepburn should make a point
of seeing "Summertime," which man-

ages to display
both to consider
ab 1 e advantage.
Photographing the
story of a tourist
gives the camera
an opportunity toi
take some very

handsome pictures of the famous
city without being documentary
about it; and, playing the part of a
tourist, Miss Hepburn is able to dis
play that personality she has made
famous and, incidentally, do some
rather fine acting.
But as drama "Summertime"
comes off much less happily. The
film is an adaptation of Arthur Lau
rent's sensitive and intelligent play,
"Time of -the Cuckoo," which deals
more candidly and with greater
psychological insight into the prob
lems of spinsterhood. We never get
that ludicrous and painful concern
lor detail with which the spinster
attempts to protect herself from
reality. We don't get the feeling of
pity for those creatures who are
lonely and afraid, who are capable
of love and still selfish at the same
time.

But the story used in "Summer
time" is not without interest. On
that one big trip abroad that she has
managed to save up for—like count
less unmarried women with routine
jobs—Miss Hepburn is in search of
adventure and love. She finally finds
it with Rossano Brazzi, a good
looking, suave and slightly suspi
! cious antique dealer.
Following the course of their af
fair with the minor complications
that seem so important is diverting
and at times moving. It is, however,
no great shakes as drama.
In fact, there are several scenes
that border on the ridiculous, like
Brazzi's final mad chase for the
train with the all-symbolic gardenia
clutched in his hand. On the whole,
though, the director has kept things
pretty much in hand.
The views of Venice's narrow and
twisted canals and of the Piazzo
Sari Marco are swell. And so is Miss
Hepburn. One could only wish they
had a more dramatic vehicle through
which to perform.
