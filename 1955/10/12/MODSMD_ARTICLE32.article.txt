# Farm Endowment Is Over $47 Million
## Fund Invested in Securities, Property Yields Return of $2 Million Annually

Stanford University's endowment totals $47,709,469.82, a sum
which produces a yearly income ol about $2 million.
When the University was established by Senalor and Mrs. Stan
lord the endowment was something over $21 million. At the time
it was several times larger than the endowment ol any other uni-

j versity. the income was able to pro-*
' vide the full cost of the operation
! of Stanford in the early years, when
there were only a few hundred stu
dents and the top faculty salaries
were in the range of $2,000 to $11,000
annually.
With the growth of the University
and tha establishment of expensive ;
advanced courses, such as medicine,
and numerous research projects, the
cost of operation has far exceeded
the increase in income from endow
ment.
Today the income from the en
j dowmenl fund provides only about
20 per cent of tlie annual cost of
operation. About half of this cost is
supplied by tuition and the balance
by gifts from individuals, corpora
tions and foundations lor current
; expenditures.
ENDOWMENT
However, endowment income is I
approximately $2 million a year, and j
it plays a vital part in paying the j
University expenses.
Since the initial endowment, other '
j funds have been received slowly I
i through the years, but most of them j

have been for special purposes such
as scholarship and research. On
Aug. 31, 1954, the endowment of
Stanford totaled $47,709,4(59.82. (The
figures for the last year have not
been completed.)
The endowment funds may be j
broken down Into the following
major divisions: unrestricted for
general University use, $28 million; !
for scholarships and fellowships, $5
million; for use of various schools 1
and departments, $8.5 million, and
income subject to life interest of
Conors, $3.5 million.
The last item refers to funds that
are given to the University to hold
in trust for an individual, the income
from them to go to the University
only after the individual's death.
INVESTMENT
As endowment funds are received
they are invested to produce income
for the purposes designated. To
carry out this function, the Board
of Trustees has formed a seven- :
member committee. This committee
has working for it a full-time expert, i
with an office in San Francisco, who '
advises the committee on invest-* j
ments to make with new funds, and
carries through the actual function
of investing the money.
This man is Almon F. Manspeaker, '
a Stanford graduate, who has served
in this capacity for 20 years.
When .possible, individual funds
are pooled into the Merged Fund,
and its income is determined by the
average rate of return on the whole j
endowment, and its return is rated
in proportion to its size.
In recent years the rate of return
has run about 4.5 per cent. For ex
ample, a $10,000 fund established by
a donor for scholarships would have
an annual income for this purpose
of approximately $450.
INVESTMENT SUMMARY
The principal catagories of in
vestments may be summarized as
follows, in round figures:
Real estate loans—sl million. These
are principally to faculty and frater
nities for houses on campus.
Real estate and improvements— J
$2.3 million. Approximately half of
this represents the value at which
the 9,000-acre campus is carried.
The other half represents a few in

vestments in properties, principally
a portion of Hale Brothers store
property in San Jose and the Moore
store in Oakland. Some of the cam
pus acreage is now in the process
of development in the form of the
Stanford Shopping Center and the j
light industrial area south of the
campus.
1 n c o m e - producing institutional
properties—s3 million. This consists
of dormitories, dining halls, the
Stanford Lane Hospital, and such
facilities as are able to return the
investment during the life of the
provided structure.
Securities—s42 million. The bulk
of endowment funds is invested in

stocks and bonds. This figure, inci
dentally, represents the more recent
Aug. 31, 1955, total. It represents
an increase of $1 million over last
year's $41 million securities fund. Il
includes approximately $6 million of
profits which have been realized on
past transactions.
Common stocks constitute 57 per
cent of the securities expenditure.
The largest categories of common
stocks are: public utilities, 18 per
cent; insurance, 15 per cent; oils, 13
per cent; banks, 10 per cent, and
chemical and pharmaceutical, 8 per
cent. The remainder is distributed
over a wide range of industries.
