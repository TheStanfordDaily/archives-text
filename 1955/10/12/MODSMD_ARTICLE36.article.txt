# Indian Gridders Prepare for Uclans; Harrington, Lewis Will See Action
## 
### 
Fullback A 1 Harrington and quar
terback Jack Lewis yesterday were

declared ready to go on Saturday
against UCLA by Stanford trainer
Connie Jarvis.
Harrington has been suffering
from a pinched nerve in his leg.
Lewis, who threw a touchdown pass
against Michigan State last week,
suffered a possible fracture of a ver
tebra in Mondav's workout.
Halfback Lou Valli, who has been

on and off the varsity roster all sea
son, was named off again this week
because of his bothersome knee in
jury. The speedy sophomore had
been scheduled to see plenty of ac
tion this year until his knee was
hurt.
Coach Chuck Taylor sent his grid
ders through a defensive drill yes
terday in preparation for the touch
down-happy boys from Westwood.
Stanford has been unable to stop
any single-wing outfit this season
so far.
The Bruins can be expected to
throw either a strong running or a
passing attack against the Cards, de
pending on the status of Ronnie
Knox's shoulder and Red Sanders'
choice of a starting tailback.
The Indians also went through an
offensive drill yesterday, working on
both the running and passing games.
Stanford was not able to tally against
the Spartans from East Lansing until
the fourth quarter last Saturday.
