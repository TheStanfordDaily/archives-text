# KA's Down Sigma Nu's by 14 Points
## 
### 
Though playing the first half with
anly six men, Kappa Alpha's intra
mural gridders yesterday whipped
Sigma Nu 11, 20-ti, in a hard-fought
battle.
The tilt spotlighted Sel Beebe
Kappa Alpha's fiery little tailback.
Beebe passed for two touchdowns
â€¢and ran for a third.
Early in the game Beebe passed
or carried the bull on every play to
park a 73-yard drive to pay dirt
A Beebe-to-John Packard pass ate
up the final 5 yards, with Beebe
scooting over for the seventh point.
But Sigma Nu II came fighting
back. Paced by the passing combi
nation of Wes Marx to VVally Mac
kenzie, Sigma Nu marched 50 yards,

only to lose the ball on downs on
the 1-foot line.
In second-half action Beebe passed
to Hanko Viets on the Sigma Nu 30,
and Viets went the rest of the way
with beautiful broken-field running.
Beebe fired to Bill Bardin for the
extra point.
For Sigma Null's only score,
Marx then tossed an 11-yard aerial
to Joe Critchfield, climaxing a 75-
yard march. The extra point was no
good.
Just before the gun sounded. Kap
pa Alpha salted Sigma Nu's wounds
with an 80-yard triumphal drive,
Beebe dashing the final 20 yards.
The try for the extra point failed,
leaving the final score 20-(>.
