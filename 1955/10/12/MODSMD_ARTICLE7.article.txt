# North Africa Expert Blasts French Colonialists as 'Foreign Oppressors'
## 
### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
Leaning heavily on the Memo
rial Auditorium lectern and on his
wide experience in North Africa,
white-haired, stacatto Tuesday Se
ries lecturer Rom Landau charac
terized the French colonial ad
ministration of the North African
states as "foreign oppressors."
Leading off with a summary of
the North African situation, Lan
dau loosed a blast at the French,
whom he called "propagandists,"
and, incidentally, took a kick at
foreign press reports as he ex
ploded several "myths" which he
said have arisen through the
French policy of news control.
He mentioned in particular the
mistaken idea that the recent
North African uprisings were a
spontaneous "explosion" not ne
cessarily controlled by the leaders
of the Nationalist party, Istiqlal.
Landau sounded like a voice
from the past, repeating in almost
the same words pronouncements
which he made in articles and
newspapers two years ago. His
analysis of the North African news
repeated, fact by fact, predictions
he made while speaking at Stan

ford two years ago.
He pointed out that the danger
ous hair-trigger balance of politics
in Morocco and Algeria may light
the fuse on an upheaval in the
Arab world which could prove
disastrous to the Western powers.
"Bandung," he said, "should
have been a warning. Can we af
ford, for the sake of a small mi
nority of colonists, to aggravate
the whole Afro-Asian bloc?"
This minority of colonists, he
said, takes a reactionary position
to safeguard its investments in
the rich Mediterranean countries
of North Africa.
DISPARITY EXISTS
Pointing out the disparity be
tween the colonist and the native,
he mentioned that incomes of
"over a million pounds sterling"
were not unusual for French prop
erty owners, while the average ag
ricultural worker's wage, one of
the higher - salaried brackets, is
"around 65 cents per day."
"But the Moroccans are not
seeking their independence for
economic reasons," he went on;
"it is not because they live in the
economic cellar, not because they

make barely enough to live on."
The force behind the North Af
rican upheavals is more of a de
sire for liberation from French
domination.
FEW ACCEPTED
"And how many of the recent
proposals of | Premier Edgar |
Faure will be accepted by the
Moroccans?" Very few, according
to Landau.
"They've lost faith in promises
. . . they're using the only weapon
they think will be effective—the
weapon of economic boycott; the
weapon, unfortunately, of vio
lence. And they're getting re
sults."
PREDICTS VIOLENCE
He predicted that violence in
Morocco will continue until pres
sure from France and from out
side powers, particularly the Unit
ed States, throw over the short
sighted colonial policies and give
independence to the North Afri
cans, and he ended with a ques
tion to his listeners and to the
United States:
"Can this country, supporting as
it docs the ethical principles of
Christianity—or call it humanity
—can this country overlook the
legitimate demands of nine million
people for the sake of 'political
expediency'?"

sure from France and from out
side powers, particularly the Unit
ed States, throw over the short
sighted colonial policies and give
independence to the North Afri
cans, and he ended with a ques
tion to his listeners and to the
United States:
"Can this country, supporting as
it docs the ethical principles of
Christianity—or call it humanity
—can this country overlook the
legitimate demands of nine million
people for the sake of 'political
expediency'?"
Leaning heavily on the Memo
rial Auditorium lectern and on his
wide experience in North Africa,
white-haired, stacatto Tuesday Se
ries lecturer Rom Landau charac
terized the French colonial ad
ministration of the North African
states as "foreign oppressors."
Leading off with a summary of
the North African situation, Lan
dau loosed a blast at the French,
whom he called "propagandists,"
and, incidentally, took a kick at
foreign press reports as he ex
ploded several "myths" which he
said have arisen through the
French policy of news control.
He mentioned in particular the
mistaken idea that the recent
North African uprisings were a
spontaneous "explosion" not ne
cessarily controlled by the leaders
of the Nationalist party, Istiqlal.
Landau sounded like a voice
from the past, repeating in almost
the same words pronouncements
which he made in articles and
newspapers two years ago. His
analysis of the North African news
repeated, fact by fact, predictions
he made while speaking at Stan

ford two years ago.
He pointed out that the danger
ous hair-trigger balance of politics
in Morocco and Algeria may light
the fuse on an upheaval in the
Arab world which could prove
disastrous to the Western powers.
"Bandung," he said, "should
have been a warning. Can we af
ford, for the sake of a small mi
nority of colonists, to aggravate
the whole Afro-Asian bloc?"
This minority of colonists, he
said, takes a reactionary position
to safeguard its investments in
the rich Mediterranean countries
of North Africa.
DISPARITY EXISTS
Pointing out the disparity be
tween the colonist and the native,
he mentioned that incomes of
"over a million pounds sterling"
were not unusual for French prop
erty owners, while the average ag
ricultural worker's wage, one of
the higher - salaried brackets, is
"around 65 cents per day."
"But the Moroccans are not
seeking their independence for
economic reasons," he went on;
"it is not because they live in the
economic cellar, not because they

make barely enough to live on."
The force behind the North Af
rican upheavals is more of a de
sire for liberation from French
domination.
FEW ACCEPTED
"And how many of the recent
proposals of | Premier Edgar |
Faure will be accepted by the
Moroccans?" Very few, according
to Landau.
"They've lost faith in promises
. . . they're using the only weapon
they think will be effective—the
weapon of economic boycott; the
weapon, unfortunately, of vio
lence. And they're getting re
sults."
PREDICTS VIOLENCE
He predicted that violence in
Morocco will continue until pres
sure from France and from out
side powers, particularly the Unit
ed States, throw over the short

independence to the North Afri
cans, and he ended with a ques
