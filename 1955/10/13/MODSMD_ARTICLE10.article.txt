## 
### 
Two unexplained explosions—one
about 11:15 p.m., the other about
midnight—rocked the Stanford cam
pus Tuesday night.
The Stanford Fire Department had
no explanation to offer for the blasts,
and Police Chief Gordon Davis said
he had no idea where the noises
came from.
Davis said the first blast seemed
to be centered in the South Palo
Alto district, but that the second one
seemed nearer to campus. Two police
officers stationed in the men's dor
mitory area reported that both ex
plosions seemed to be somewhere
southeast of campus.
On campus, one Ventura resident
said the first shock rattled windows
there. The second blast reportedly
rocked Union residents and the Row
houses.
