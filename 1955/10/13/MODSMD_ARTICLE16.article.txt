## Eisenhower Would Accept Russ Arms inspection Teams 
### 
DENVER, Oct. 12 (UP)—Presi
dent Eisenhower has told Soviet
Premier Nicolai A. Bulganin that
the U.S. is willing to accept a
Russian proposal for disarma
ment inspection teams in both coun
tries "if you feel this would help
create a better spirit between the
two countries on disarmament.
The President's agreement to ac
cept the Soviet military inspection
proposal still appeared to be linked
to Soviet acceptance of some form
of his own plan for exchanging mili
tary "blueprints" and reciprocal aer
ial photographs.
However, at an Aug. 4 press con
ference Mr. Eisenhower said he had
told Bulganin he would accept both
proposals.
In his letter to Mr. Eisenhower,
Bulganin said the President's pro
posals do not go far enough and do
not meet the actual problem of dis
armament.
The exchange of letters, despite
the friendly tone in each, appeared
to leave the U. S. and Soviet posi
tions virtually unchanged.
But the fact that Mr. Eisenhower
expressed willingness to accept the
Russian inspection team proposal
along with some form of his own
suggestions was regarded as signifi
cant.
