The announcement this week by Harold E.
Stassen that he would be willing to accept the
1956 Republican Presidential nomination if
President Eisenhower gave the nod, was re
ceived by a certain segment of Republicans
v/ith much satisfaction.
To these Republicans, Chief Justice Earl
Warren would be the ideal candidate for the
GOP should Eisenhower bow out, and Stassen
a good second.
The fact is, they say, among the field of
Republican possibilities only Warren has the
great bi-partisan appeal with which Eisenhower
v/on in 1952 and without which no Republican
candidate can hope to triumph in 1956.
Neither Nixon, Knowland, nor Knight could
capture as great a portion of the independent
and "conservative-progressive" bloc as could
Warren.
The former California Governor is the man
that Harry Truman in 1948 said is "really a
Democrat and does not know it." Indeed, that
is what they said of Ike before he decided to
run.
Unfortunately for many Republicans, how
ever, there is the fact that Warren has avowed
fie will not be a candidate under any conditions
for the Presidency in 1956.
Read again his statement, made on April 15:
"My name has been used as a possible candidate
for the Presidency. This has been a matter of em
barrassment to me because it reflects upon the
performance of my duties as Chief Justice of the
United States.
"When I accepted that position it was with the
fixed purpose of leaving politics permanently for
service on the Court. That is still my purpose. It
is irrevocable. I will not change it under any cir
cumstances or conditions.
"Be there many or few, the remaining useful
years of my life are dedicated to the service ol the

Supreme Court of the United States, in which work
I am increasingly happy."
Today, 64-year-old Warren draws a 535,500
salary as Chief Justice, plus a California gov
ernment pension of SIO,OOO.
No Chief Justice has ever resigned to run
for President, although John Jay quit the Court
to become Governor of New York in the early
days of the country. An Associate Justice..
Charles Evans Hughes, was drafted off the
bench to go against Woodrow Wilson in 1916.
Warren has said, "To me, the Chief Justice
ship of the United States is the most important
job in the world."
Yet against these facts, Republicans still hold
hope that Warren can be persuaded to change
his mind.
They look to his great record compiled in
California, his vote-getting appeal and popu
larity.
They look to the stature he has received from
the segregation decision of May 17, 1954. In
28 minutes on that day, he laid down one of
the most important decisions in Court history
since Justice Taney's Dred Scott pronounce
ment in 1857.
And pausing to consider the feuds which
have erupted between the Nixon and Know
land factions, these Republicans conclude that
their man in '56 must come from the ranks of
men like Warren and Stassen, if Ike declines.
But the Chief Justice, unlike "reluctant" Ad
lai Stevenson in 1952, has much to lose and not
much to gain from the political arena—and he
is likely to remain one of the Nine Old Men.
Then this part of the GOP—supporters of
"middle-of-the-roaders"—will turn in search of
someone else. And Stassen will be there.

fie will not be a candidate under any conditions
for the Presidency in 1956.
Read again his statement, made on April 15:
"My name has been used as a possible candidate
for the Presidency. This has been a matter of em
barrassment to me because it reflects upon the
performance of my duties as Chief Justice of the
United States.
"When I accepted that position it was with the
fixed purpose of leaving politics permanently for
service on the Court. That is still my purpose. It
is irrevocable. I will not change it under any cir
cumstances or conditions.
"Be there many or few, the remaining useful
years of my life are dedicated to the service ol the

Supreme Court of the United States, in which work
I am increasingly happy."
Today, 64-year-old Warren draws a 535,500
salary as Chief Justice, plus a California gov
ernment pension of SIO,OOO.
No Chief Justice has ever resigned to run
for President, although John Jay quit the Court
to become Governor of New York in the early
days of the country. An Associate Justice..
Charles Evans Hughes, was drafted off the
bench to go against Woodrow Wilson in 1916.
Warren has said, "To me, the Chief Justice
ship of the United States is the most important
job in the world."
Yet against these facts, Republicans still hold
hope that Warren can be persuaded to change
his mind.
They look to his great record compiled in
California, his vote-getting appeal and popu
larity.
They look to the stature he has received from
the segregation decision of May 17, 1954. In
28 minutes on that day, he laid down one of
the most important decisions in Court history
since Justice Taney's Dred Scott pronounce
ment in 1857.
And pausing to consider the feuds which
have erupted between the Nixon and Know
land factions, these Republicans conclude that
their man in '56 must come from the ranks of
men like Warren and Stassen, if Ike declines.
But the Chief Justice, unlike "reluctant" Ad
lai Stevenson in 1952, has much to lose and not
much to gain from the political arena—and he
is likely to remain one of the Nine Old Men.
Then this part of the GOP—supporters of
"middle-of-the-roaders"—will turn in search of
someone else. And Stassen will be there.
The announcement this week by Harold E.
Stassen that he would be willing to accept the
1956 Republican Presidential nomination if
President Eisenhower gave the nod, was re
ceived by a certain segment of Republicans
v/ith much satisfaction.
To these Republicans, Chief Justice Earl
Warren would be the ideal candidate for the
GOP should Eisenhower bow out, and Stassen
a good second.
The fact is, they say, among the field of
Republican possibilities only Warren has the
great bi-partisan appeal with which Eisenhower
v/on in 1952 and without which no Republican
candidate can hope to triumph in 1956.
Neither Nixon, Knowland, nor Knight could
capture as great a portion of the independent
and "conservative-progressive" bloc as could
Warren.
The former California Governor is the man
that Harry Truman in 1948 said is "really a
Democrat and does not know it." Indeed, that
is what they said of Ike before he decided to
run.
Unfortunately for many Republicans, how
ever, there is the fact that Warren has avowed
fie will not be a candidate under any conditions
for the Presidency in 1956.
