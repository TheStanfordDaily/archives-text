# ‘Bus Stop’ Acting ‘Good,’ Production ‘Sound'
## Inge's Naturalism Leaves S.F. Cold, Audience Walks Out 
### RICHARD MENDE 
Throughout the whole first
act of "Bus Stop" a man across \
the aisle from me was making
caustic remarks, out loud, about
the performance. By the middle
oi' the second act a disturbed neiyji
bor said sharply ,"If you don't like j
the theater, why don't you let those !
who do enjoy it, by themselves?"
The unappreciative patron left
shortly after, but before the evening
was over, several others had walked I
out. When the final curtain came
down, there were visible signs of
relief from almost everybody except |
those who were resolutely deter- j
mined to abide by the favorable
i press reviews. J
This is a fairly standard audience
reaction to a bad production, but
the show at the Geary is not a bad
production; it is far above average.
The acting is unusually good, with !
Albert Salmi re-creating the original
Broadway role of a love-struck cow
boy; Peggy Ann Garner a worthy j
successor to Kim Stanley as the
"chantoosie" about to be rustled,
and everybody in general doing ev- !
erything they could think of to make
the evening a success. The set was
fine, and Harold Curlman's direc
tion is as found here as it was in
New York.
Certainly, some of the blame for
a trying evening must rest with Mr. j
Inge, whose characters are very,
very ordinary. But he endows them
with unusually activating sexual ap
petites (or maybe it is just that his
act less repressed); and
if for this reason they don't ring
quite true, they nevertheless become {
interesting enough in the hands of |
a skilled craftsman like Mr. Inge.
The play concerns the activities i
of some people stranded in a diner; j
the motivation of nearly everybody
—except the sheriff—is sexual. There
are three seductions being attempted
at once. But Mr. Inge has a thought- !
f.ul non-prudish moral about all \
this: . . People really in love, after j
the intensity of attraction is subdued !
. . . face the trembling time when
they must give up something of 1
themselves."
If the play isn't up to the stand
ards of "Come Back, Little Sheba"
or "Picnic"; if the characters are
too provincial to be immediately
and completely captivating; if the
wit is somewhat forced—there is ;
certainly an abundance of sympathy, j
good humor, and solid craftsman
ship.
So what is wrong? Why was there ;
so little enthusiasm for this polished 1
production? I would hazard two
answers. First, the form in which J
the play was written has been '
worked to death. The naturalistic
tradition which Ibsen introduced,
which Chekov refined, and which i
Shaw imposed on everyone else has
been hopelessly overworked; it is a
dead form. That the play voted by
many the "best of 1954" can be so
tedious may be a fine illustration of
this increasingly accepted thesis.

The second reason 1 think "Bus
Stop" failed to communicate beyond
the Geary footlights is because it is
not a part of a vital theater. It has
been imported reasonably intact
from a successful New York run;
the audience ought to be able to get
the same things to laugh and cry at
as the New York crowds. But dy
namic theater must he regional thea
ter —that doesn't mean there's no
such thing as universal drama; each

community builds up traditions that
are unique and untransplantable.
This applies to cities as it does to
time periods. IJ' San Francisco wants
vital theater, shi? will have to de
velop her own traditions and at
mosphere, like New York, or Lon
don, or Paris; she can never do this
by inviting louring groups.
That's why 1 thought "Bus Stop"
was dull, but you might go down
and have a look lor yourself.

down, there were visible signs of
relief from almost everybody except |
those who were resolutely deter- j
mined to abide by the favorable
i press reviews. J
This is a fairly standard audience
reaction to a bad production, but
the show at the Geary is not a bad
production; it is far above average.
The acting is unusually good, with !
Albert Salmi re-creating the original
Broadway role of a love-struck cow
boy; Peggy Ann Garner a worthy j
successor to Kim Stanley as the
"chantoosie" about to be rustled,
and everybody in general doing ev- !
erything they could think of to make
the evening a success. The set was
fine, and Harold Curlman's direc
tion is as found here as it was in
New York.
Certainly, some of the blame for
a trying evening must rest with Mr. j
Inge, whose characters are very,
very ordinary. But he endows them
with unusually activating sexual ap
petites (or maybe it is just that his
act less repressed); and
if for this reason they don't ring
quite true, they nevertheless become {
interesting enough in the hands of |
a skilled craftsman like Mr. Inge.
The play concerns the activities i
of some people stranded in a diner; j
the motivation of nearly everybody
—except the sheriff—is sexual. There
are three seductions being attempted
at once. But Mr. Inge has a thought- !
f.ul non-prudish moral about all \
this: . . People really in love, after j
the intensity of attraction is subdued !
. . . face the trembling time when
they must give up something of 1
themselves."
If the play isn't up to the stand
ards of "Come Back, Little Sheba"
or "Picnic"; if the characters are
too provincial to be immediately
and completely captivating; if the
wit is somewhat forced—there is ;
certainly an abundance of sympathy, j
good humor, and solid craftsman
ship.
So what is wrong? Why was there ;
so little enthusiasm for this polished 1
production? I would hazard two
answers. First, the form in which J
the play was written has been '
worked to death. The naturalistic
tradition which Ibsen introduced,
which Chekov refined, and which i
Shaw imposed on everyone else has
been hopelessly overworked; it is a
dead form. That the play voted by
many the "best of 1954" can be so
tedious may be a fine illustration of
this increasingly accepted thesis.

The second reason 1 think "Bus
Stop" failed to communicate beyond
the Geary footlights is because it is
not a part of a vital theater. It has
been imported reasonably intact
from a successful New York run;
the audience ought to be able to get
the same things to laugh and cry at
as the New York crowds. But dy
namic theater must he regional thea
ter —that doesn't mean there's no
such thing as universal drama; each

community builds up traditions that
are unique and untransplantable.
This applies to cities as it does to
time periods. IJ' San Francisco wants
vital theater, shi? will have to de
velop her own traditions and at
mosphere, like New York, or Lon
don, or Paris; she can never do this
by inviting louring groups.
That's why 1 thought "Bus Stop"
was dull, but you might go down
and have a look lor yourself.
Throughout the whole first
act of "Bus Stop" a man across \
the aisle from me was making
caustic remarks, out loud, about
the performance. By the middle
oi' the second act a disturbed neiyji
bor said sharply ,"If you don't like j
the theater, why don't you let those !
who do enjoy it, by themselves?"
The unappreciative patron left
shortly after, but before the evening
was over, several others had walked I
out. When the final curtain came
down, there were visible signs of
relief from almost everybody except |
