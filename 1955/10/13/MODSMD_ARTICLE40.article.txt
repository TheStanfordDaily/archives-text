# Gridders Drilled In Readiness For UCLA Crucial
## 
### BOB MIEROW 
Coach Chuck Taylor sent his grid
ders through drills without pads
yesterday in preparation for the In
dians' crucial game Saturday against
the UCLA Bruins.
The Cards reviewed the offensive
patterns which they have been using
this year and worked on defensive
formations to stop the talented ball
carriers from Westwood.
Taylor has a large problem in try
ing to defense the versatile Bruins.
Leading the UCLA attack is All-
American fullback Bob Davenport,
top PCC touchdown - maker last
year.
Sam Brown or Ronnie Knox could
open at tailback, the key position in
Red Sanders' single wing offense.
Brown is a tremendous runner,
while Knox starting would mean a
brilliant Bruin passing attack.
Rounding out the versatile West
wood backfield are Jim Decker at
wingback and Bob Bergdahl at
blocking back. Decker had the best
yard - per - carry average of any
player in the nation last year.
Stanford has opposed two single
wing type teams already this year.
Oregon State, using an offense prac
tically identical to that of the
Bruins, scored a 10-0 victory. Mich
igan State, mixing the single wing
with its other formations, tallied 38
points against the Indans.
A strong possibility exists that
Jeri McMillin will open at halfback
for Stanford in place of Ernie Dorn.
The speedy little sophomore was
working with the first string in prac
tice yesterday, while Dorn was be
hind Bill Tarr at fullback.
Should McMillin be in the lineup
at the opening kick-off, it would
mark the first time this year that a
sophomore has started. This is also
the first line-up change that Taylor
has made all season.
Only soph halfbacks Lou Valli and
Doug Dick will miss Saturday's con
test with the Southland gridders.
Valli has been bothered by a bad
knee all year, while Dick was cleat
ed in the leg Monday in practice.

preparation £or each upcoming game.
The hard work is done on Sunday,
Monday, and Tuesday for the con
test on Saturday. By Wednesday
only minor details can be worked
upon.
After the final gun goes off this
Saturday ending the UCLA-Stan
fird game, Taylor will spend about
half an hour facing the press, before
he can go home and rest. He doesn't
have anything to do until 1 o'clock
on Sunday afternoon, when the
movies of the Bruin game will be
available.
He and his staff will see the cellu
loid version of the game approxi
mately seven tunes before they are
through. On each running they will
watch a different position, and make
notes on the performance of their
material.
By 7:30 they usually are through
with the movies, so they will listen
to Dutch Fehring, who will be back
from Seattle and the Washington-
Baylor game. Under a new confer
ence ruling each school can request
movies of one game of their up
coming opponents.
Taylor has a movie of the Wash
ington upset of USC which he and
his staff will use to give all of them
a look at the surprising Huskies,
but movies don't show pass patterns
or downfield blocking too well, so
the scout report fills in these details
that the movie misses.
The coaches spend Sunday night
digesting the Washington style of
play and on next Monday they will
report at 8 a.m. for a meeting where
they will try to set up a suitable
defense for the Husky attack. At
Monday's practice session from four
to six, the rudiments of the defense
will be introduced to the team.
On Monday night the squad has a
meeting. At the meeting Fehring
will tell the players about the Husky
team, and will pass on individual
weaknesses and strengths that he
and the other coaches have gleaned
from the movie of the USC game.
After the talk, the Stanford players
will see a movie — either of last
year's Washington game or, more
likely, the film of the Washington
team, 1955 model.
STANDARD DEFENSES
This is to acquaint our players
with the style of the Husky they
will be playing against on Saturday.
After the movie the coaches will
set up the final defenses for Wash
ington. Taylor points out that all

teams use pretty much the same
basic defense from year to year.
As an example, Stanford's defense
this Saturday against UCLA will be
btTsically the same as was used last
year. There will be variations, de
pending upon UCLA personnel,
however.
By Tuesday the Stanford football
brain trust will be in session at
eight in the morning again, and by
the time they adjourn for lunch the
deck is cleared for offensive work.
In their afternoon session before
practice they start planning offen
sive strategy.
KNOCK OFF EARLY
By Wednesday Taylor says, "We
try to be all through, and knock off
early—about 10 o'clock." Thursday
and Friday are spent in brushing up
minor points. It's too late to make
any big changes for the game.
Thursday's practice usually con
sists of the fourth string running
opposition plays. Taylor states, "We
don't expect a fourth-string half
back to make like Ronnie Knox,
but at least the starters can get
some idea of what the UCLA's
attack looks like."
Come a week from Saturday in
Seattle, and the coaching staff may
gather around in the morning for a
meeting, but as Stanford's head
coach put it, "by that time the hay
is in the barn, and it's usually just
worrying."
At kickoff Pete Kmetovic will be
in the press box spotting as will the
coach who scouted the opponent, in
this case, Dutch Fehring. Kmetovic
has a steady job "topside" and is in
constant phone communication with
the Stanford bench where he talks
with one of the other coaches.
HALF-TIME ACTIVITIES
Taylor paces the sidelines and ob
serves what he can from there. At
half-time not a great deal can be
accomplished, he adds. "Six of the
15 minutes allotted us are spent in
letting the players wash their faces
and get a drink of juice. Then we
may suggest a play that may work
or slightly realign our defenses to
stop something unexpected that the
opposition may have come up with,
but it's impossible to do anything
radical."

Rounding out the versatile West

Stanford has opposed two single
wing type teams already this year.
Oregon State, using an offense prac

Bruins, scored a 10-0 victory. Mich

with its other formations, tallied 38
points against the Indans.
A strong possibility exists that
Jeri McMillin will open at halfback
for Stanford in place of Ernie Dorn.
The speedy little sophomore was
working with the first string in prac
tice yesterday, while Dorn was be
hind Bill Tarr at fullback.
Should McMillin be in the lineup
at the opening kick-off, it would
mark the first time this year that a
sophomore has started. This is also
the first line-up change that Taylor
has made all season.

The hard work is done on Sunday,
Monday, and Tuesday for the con
test on Saturday. By Wednesday
only minor details can be worked
upon.
After the final gun goes off this
Saturday ending the UCLA-Stan
fird game, Taylor will spend about
half an hour facing the press, before
he can go home and rest. He doesn't
have anything to do until 1 o'clock
on Sunday afternoon, when the
movies of the Bruin game will be
available.
He and his staff will see the cellu
loid version of the game approxi
mately seven tunes before they are
through. On each running they will
watch a different position, and make
notes on the performance of their
material.
By 7:30 they usually are through
with the movies, so they will listen
to Dutch Fehring, who will be back
from Seattle and the Washington-
Baylor game. Under a new confer
ence ruling each school can request
movies of one game of their up
coming opponents.
Taylor has a movie of the Wash
ington upset of USC which he and
his staff will use to give all of them
a look at the surprising Huskies,
but movies don't show pass patterns
or downfield blocking too well, so
the scout report fills in these details
that the movie misses.
The coaches spend Sunday night
digesting the Washington style of
play and on next Monday they will
report at 8 a.m. for a meeting where
they will try to set up a suitable
defense for the Husky attack. At

On Monday night the squad has a

will tell the players about the Husky
team, and will pass on individual
weaknesses and strengths that he
and the other coaches have gleaned
from the movie of the USC game.
After the talk, the Stanford players
will see a movie — either of last
year's Washington game or, more
likely, the film of the Washington
team, 1955 model.
STANDARD DEFENSES
This is to acquaint our players
with the style of the Husky they
will be playing against on Saturday.
After the movie the coaches will
set up the final defenses for Wash
ington. Taylor points out that all

teams use pretty much the same
basic defense from year to year.
As an example, Stanford's defense
this Saturday against UCLA will be
btTsically the same as was used last
year. There will be variations, de
pending upon UCLA personnel,
however.
By Tuesday the Stanford football
brain trust will be in session at
eight in the morning again, and by
the time they adjourn for lunch the
deck is cleared for offensive work.
In their afternoon session before
practice they start planning offen

KNOCK OFF EARLY
By Wednesday Taylor says, "We

minor points. It's too late to make
any big changes for the game.
Thursday's practice usually con
sists of the fourth string running
opposition plays. Taylor states, "We
don't expect a fourth-string half
back to make like Ronnie Knox,
but at least the starters can get

attack looks like."
Come a week from Saturday in
Seattle, and the coaching staff may
gather around in the morning for a
meeting, but as Stanford's head
coach put it, "by that time the hay
is in the barn, and it's usually just
worrying."
At kickoff Pete Kmetovic will be
in the press box spotting as will the
coach who scouted the opponent, in
this case, Dutch Fehring. Kmetovic
has a steady job "topside" and is in
constant phone communication with
the Stanford bench where he talks
with one of the other coaches.
HALF-TIME ACTIVITIES
Taylor paces the sidelines and ob
serves what he can from there. At
half-time not a great deal can be
accomplished, he adds. "Six of the
15 minutes allotted us are spent in
letting the players wash their faces
and get a drink of juice. Then we
may suggest a play that may work
or slightly realign our defenses to
stop something unexpected that the
opposition may have come up with,
but it's impossible to do anything
radical."

while Knox starting would mean a

Rounding out the versatile West
wood backfield are Jim Decker at
wingback and Bob Bergdahl at
blocking back. Decker had the best
yard - per - carry average of any
player in the nation last year.
Stanford has opposed two single
wing type teams already this year.
Oregon State, using an offense prac
tically identical to that of the
Bruins, scored a 10-0 victory. Mich
igan State, mixing the single wing
with its other formations, tallied 38
points against the Indans.
A strong possibility exists that
Jeri McMillin will open at halfback
for Stanford in place of Ernie Dorn.
The speedy little sophomore was
working with the first string in prac
tice yesterday, while Dorn was be
hind Bill Tarr at fullback.
Should McMillin be in the lineup
at the opening kick-off, it would
mark the first time this year that a
sophomore has started. This is also
the first line-up change that Taylor
has made all season.
Only soph halfbacks Lou Valli and
Doug Dick will miss Saturday's con

The hard work is done on Sunday,
Monday, and Tuesday for the con
test on Saturday. By Wednesday
only minor details can be worked
upon.
After the final gun goes off this
Saturday ending the UCLA-Stan
fird game, Taylor will spend about
half an hour facing the press, before
he can go home and rest. He doesn't
have anything to do until 1 o'clock
on Sunday afternoon, when the
movies of the Bruin game will be
available.
He and his staff will see the cellu
loid version of the game approxi
mately seven tunes before they are
through. On each running they will
watch a different position, and make
notes on the performance of their
material.
By 7:30 they usually are through
with the movies, so they will listen
to Dutch Fehring, who will be back
from Seattle and the Washington-
Baylor game. Under a new confer
ence ruling each school can request
movies of one game of their up
coming opponents.
Taylor has a movie of the Wash
ington upset of USC which he and
his staff will use to give all of them
a look at the surprising Huskies,
but movies don't show pass patterns
or downfield blocking too well, so
the scout report fills in these details
that the movie misses.
The coaches spend Sunday night
digesting the Washington style of
play and on next Monday they will
report at 8 a.m. for a meeting where
they will try to set up a suitable
defense for the Husky attack. At
Monday's practice session from four

On Monday night the squad has a

will tell the players about the Husky
team, and will pass on individual
weaknesses and strengths that he
and the other coaches have gleaned
from the movie of the USC game.
After the talk, the Stanford players
will see a movie — either of last
year's Washington game or, more
likely, the film of the Washington
team, 1955 model.
STANDARD DEFENSES
This is to acquaint our players
with the style of the Husky they
will be playing against on Saturday.
After the movie the coaches will
set up the final defenses for Wash
ington. Taylor points out that all

teams use pretty much the same
basic defense from year to year.
As an example, Stanford's defense
this Saturday against UCLA will be
btTsically the same as was used last
year. There will be variations, de
pending upon UCLA personnel,
however.
By Tuesday the Stanford football
brain trust will be in session at
eight in the morning again, and by
the time they adjourn for lunch the
deck is cleared for offensive work.
In their afternoon session before
practice they start planning offen
sive strategy.
KNOCK OFF EARLY
By Wednesday Taylor says, "We
try to be all through, and knock off
early—about 10 o'clock." Thursday
and Friday are spent in brushing up
minor points. It's too late to make
any big changes for the game.
Thursday's practice usually con
sists of the fourth string running
opposition plays. Taylor states, "We
don't expect a fourth-string half
back to make like Ronnie Knox,
but at least the starters can get
some idea of what the UCLA's
attack looks like."
Come a week from Saturday in
Seattle, and the coaching staff may
gather around in the morning for a
meeting, but as Stanford's head
coach put it, "by that time the hay
is in the barn, and it's usually just
worrying."
At kickoff Pete Kmetovic will be
in the press box spotting as will the
coach who scouted the opponent, in
this case, Dutch Fehring. Kmetovic
has a steady job "topside" and is in
constant phone communication with
the Stanford bench where he talks
with one of the other coaches.
HALF-TIME ACTIVITIES
Taylor paces the sidelines and ob
serves what he can from there. At
half-time not a great deal can be
accomplished, he adds. "Six of the
15 minutes allotted us are spent in
letting the players wash their faces
and get a drink of juice. Then we
may suggest a play that may work
or slightly realign our defenses to
stop something unexpected that the
opposition may have come up with,
but it's impossible to do anything
radical."
Coach Chuck Taylor sent his grid
ders through drills without pads
yesterday in preparation for the In
dians' crucial game Saturday against
the UCLA Bruins.
The Cards reviewed the offensive
patterns which they have been using
this year and worked on defensive
formations to stop the talented ball
carriers from Westwood.
Taylor has a large problem in try
