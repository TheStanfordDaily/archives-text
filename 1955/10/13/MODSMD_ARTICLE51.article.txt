NSA, which Stanford joined for
the second time in 1953, is attempt
ing to initiate an active program on
the student national and interna
tional levels, according to NSA co
ordinator Jitn Sammet.
Here in the Bay region, Sammet
said, NSA is looking into the possi
bilities of obtaining student discount
rates at Bay Area stores, which
would be available to all persons
holding NSA cards (all students at
Stanford are NSA members).
Sammet also cited possibilities that
NSA will hold an academic freedom
conference either at Stanford or in
the immediate area this winter.
Although nothing was done on
this campus, NSA sponsored "Aca
demic Freedom Week" thx'oughout
the nation last year.
Main activity in the international
program centers around the Asian
Subcommission, a regional project
(California, Nevada and Hawaii) to
exchange information, aid in the co
ordination of student projects, and
meet arriving Asian students.
NSA this year will help sponsor
the Winter Quarter Charity Drive,
from which all proceeds will go to
the World University Service Fund.
Another charity organization to
which the local NSA contributes is
the National Service and Scholar
ship Fund for Negro Students.
Student tours at a discount to
Europe, North Africa and the Near
East are furnished each year by
NSA. These 75-day tours, different
in many ways from ordinary tours,
are conducted and planned by the
students in the countries visited.
