# Professors Amaze Maria Scaglia, Italian Scholar

"Sometimes I've felt I have too
n>any .interests," Maria Scaglia,
ASSU - Cap and Gown scholar from
Italy, comments. "My mother often
tells me: 'Now, just slow down; you
have lots of time for everything.'"
And she does have a very wide
range of interests. High on the list
come interior decorating and moun
tain climbing. She also likes skiing,
tennis, swimming, ceramics, and
music—especially American jazz.
But Miss Scaglia's major interest
is political science, which she is tak
ing to give her understanding of
other countries. She will use this
for continuing her work at the Rome
branch of the Fulbright Scholarship
office, where she will be in charge
of Italian students who wish to get
grants for study in America. She
also plans to be active in the Fed
eralist Association, which works for
a unified Europe.
Miss Scaglia, who will soon be 24,
has spent all but one year of her
life in Italy. That one year abroad
was in Spain, where her father, a
general staff officer in the Italian
army, was stationed in 1939. In 1943
he went with the Italian army to
Russia and defeat at Kiev and never
returned.

Born in Asti, near Turin in the
Piedmont area of Northern Italy,
Maria and her family go there dur
ing the summers. But since the end
of the war she has lived with her
mother and an 18-year-old brother
in Rome.
She has attended the University
of Rome for two years while work
ing for the Fulbright office. Before
coming to Stanford she spent a
month with the Institute of Inter
national Education and the Depart
ment of State in Washington, taking
a Fulbright training program. She'll
be there another month just before
returning to Rome.
Miss Scaglia is not the only one
of her family now in the United
States. Her brother, Cesare, is here
on an American Field Service schol
arship and attends Roosevelt High
School in Portland, Ore.
Student life at the University of
Rome is very different from that at
Stanford, according to Miss Scaglia.
There are about 25,000 students, but
no campus residences. The students
must live with families or in apart
ments. Students are not required
to attend classes, but only to take
examinations, so there is little cam
pus life.

"But where I notice the most dif
ference is with the professors," Miss
Scaglia notes. "In Italy politics play
a large part in the universities—they
are all state-owned. The professor
is not just a professor. He may have
political titles and many meetings
to attend. So to us he is 'The Pro
fessor,' and we never talk to him.
"One of my most valuable experi

ences in Italy came one year when
some of us at the university organ
ized a student travel agency for for
eign students traveling in Italy,"
Miss Scaglia said. "We lived and
traveled with them during their
short trip through our country, and
acted as liaisons between our coun
try and them. We helped them to
understand us, and we learned to
understand them.

"But best of all is being at Stan
ford," she concluded, "a part of the
Stanford life. It's wonderful."

States. Her brother, Cesare, is here
on an American Field Service schol
arship and attends Roosevelt High
School in Portland, Ore.
Student life at the University of
Rome is very different from that at
Stanford, according to Miss Scaglia.
There are about 25,000 students, but
no campus residences. The students
must live with families or in apart
ments. Students are not required
to attend classes, but only to take
examinations, so there is little cam
pus life.

"But where I notice the most dif
ference is with the professors," Miss
Scaglia notes. "In Italy politics play
a large part in the universities—they
are all state-owned. The professor
is not just a professor. He may have
political titles and many meetings
to attend. So to us he is 'The Pro
fessor,' and we never talk to him.
"One of my most valuable experi

ences in Italy came one year when
some of us at the university organ
ized a student travel agency for for
eign students traveling in Italy,"
Miss Scaglia said. "We lived and
traveled with them during their
short trip through our country, and
acted as liaisons between our coun
try and them. We helped them to
understand us, and we learned to
understand them.

"But best of all is being at Stan
ford," she concluded, "a part of the
Stanford life. It's wonderful."

"Sometimes I've felt I have too
n>any .interests," Maria Scaglia,
ASSU - Cap and Gown scholar from
Italy, comments. "My mother often
tells me: 'Now, just slow down; you
have lots of time for everything.'"
And she does have a very wide
range of interests. High on the list
come interior decorating and moun
tain climbing. She also likes skiing,
tennis, swimming, ceramics, and
music—especially American jazz.
But Miss Scaglia's major interest
is political science, which she is tak
ing to give her understanding of
other countries. She will use this
for continuing her work at the Rome
branch of the Fulbright Scholarship
office, where she will be in charge
of Italian students who wish to get
grants for study in America. She
also plans to be active in the Fed
eralist Association, which works for
a unified Europe.
Miss Scaglia, who will soon be 24,
has spent all but one year of her
life in Italy. That one year abroad
was in Spain, where her father, a
general staff officer in the Italian
army, was stationed in 1939. In 1943
he went with the Italian army to
Russia and defeat at Kiev and never
returned.

Born in Asti, near Turin in the
Piedmont area of Northern Italy,
Maria and her family go there dur
ing the summers. But since the end
of the war she has lived with her
mother and an 18-year-old brother
in Rome.
She has attended the University
of Rome for two years while work
ing for the Fulbright office. Before
coming to Stanford she spent a
month with the Institute of Inter
national Education and the Depart
ment of State in Washington, taking
a Fulbright training program. She'll
be there another month just before
returning to Rome.
Miss Scaglia is not the only one
