# Wilbur Hall Has Intercom Speakers, Separate Numbers
## 
### 
A phone system completely new
to Stanford is now in use in Wilbur
Hall.
A more convenient intercom sys
tem has been installed. When a stu
dent in Wilbur is called, he is in
formed of the call by an intercom
speaker in his room. He then replies
that he will take it on the wing
phone through a speaker, also in the
room.
This system is also soon to be put
into effect in Crothers Memorial
Hall addition. There are also facili
ties in all rooms for putting in pri
vate phones. Private phones will be
used in the new women's dorm that
will be ready for occupancy next
fall.
Each student in Wilbur has his
own phone number. According to
Mickey Holzman, one of the student
switchboard operators, '"Those call
ing Wilbur occupants can get lots
faster service if they give the per
son's phone number along with his
name."
