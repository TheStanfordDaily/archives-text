Use of the transistor in Bell telephones
Shown here arc the parts of the small amplifying unit in
Western Electric's new Volume Control Telephone.
Because of the use of a transistor (shown above, extreme
left on index finger) this amplifying unit is no larger than an
ice cube and can fit inside the housing of a standard telephone.
Manufacturing of transistors on a commercial basis represents
a solid engineering achievement.. . for it means volume

controlled laboratory conditions. For example, harmful 112 V 3
impurity atoms in the germanium must be reduced to less than
1 for every 10,000,000.000 germanium atoms and then
helpful impurity atoms added until there is approximately
1 for every 50,000,000 germanium atoms'. volume controi telephone:
