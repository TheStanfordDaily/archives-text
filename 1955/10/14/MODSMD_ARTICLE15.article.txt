# Card Eleven To Meet Uclan On Gridiron
## Marshall Is Captain For Bruin Contest 
### JIM PIGOTT 
For those football fans who
are fortunate enough to wrestle
their way into Stanford's Sta
dium tomorrow, there will be a
top flight tussle going on from
2 to 4 in the afternoon.
Coach Henry (Red) Sanders
brings his always potent Bruins up
from the south this weekend to face
Chuck Taylor's revenge-happy In
dians. The game, which will be the
Cards' third home contest of the
year, is expected to draw some
45.000 spectators under clear skies.
Stanford, which has exhibited a
tendency to be erratic this year, is
likely to be hot this weekend and
if this happens, look out. Fans in
the area can remember when Gary
Kerkorian and Bobby Garrett led
their respective squads to victories
over other highly . favored Uclau
teams.
In fact, a Sanders-coached team
hasn't won a football game here
since 1949, the first year for the
Bruin boss, when the Cards were
eked out in a 14 to 7 thriller. To
morrow's game could be another up
set for ttho Big Red although the
chances aren't rated too good for
the Indians to come out on top.
TOP CONDITION
Physically, Stanford will be in al
most top shape. Only Cards who are
definitely labeled "out" for the con
test are Doug Dick, speedy -sopho-
more halfback, and Lou Valli, who
is still being troubled with a bad
knee. It appears that A 1 Harring
ton's ankle has responded to treat
ment well enough to let the husky
fullbeck get in the fray to replace
workhorse Bill Tair.
Taylor has been working his boys
hard this week on defense in an ef
fort to halt the single wing jugger
naut from the south which has tal
lied 90 points in the last two games.
The ease with which the Bruins can
score on a hot day is still vivid in
the minds 01 all who made the mis
take of going south last year for the
annual get - together between the
two squads.
While ii is true that Primo Villa
nueva and a couple of All-Americr
linemen such as Jim Salisbury and
Sam Boghosian are missing from the
picture this year because of gradu
ation, it must be remembered that
Sanders' eleven has only been scored
on once, by mighty Maryland, while
running up a total of 111 point. l
against four opponents.
UCLA, the pre-season pick lot
national championship honors, bar
dropped to ninth place in the weekly
United Press football poll as a result
o! its early season loss to the Terra
pins.
LEI TERM EN RETURNING
Back from last year's all-conquer
ing team are backs Bob Davenport
Sam Brown, Jim Decker, and Bruce
Ballard, all lettermen, and linemen
Rommie Loudd, Gil Moreno, Steve
Palmer, captain Hardiman Cureton.
Roger White, and John Hermann
Loudd, Moreno, and Hermann, who
make up the tackle and end posi
tions, are all two-year lettermen, af
is left guard Cureton, who is con
sidered sure-fire All-American ma
terial.
Stanford has been spending as
much time in preparing a defense
for the Uclan running game, which
works best with flashy senior Sam
Brown at the tailback position, as it
has in trying to halt the bullet-like
parses of Bruin passer Ronnie Knox
UCLA spokesmen announced that
Red Sanders will start Brown in to
morrow's contest off his fine .show
ing against WSC two weeks ago
and his last week's performance
against Oregon State.
BROWN SHINES
Brown scored the first two Bruin
touchdowns in their 35 to 0 thump
ing of the Beavers and eventually
ended up by netting 97 yards from
rushing in 14 carries for a 6.92 aver
age. After the first four games o!
the season, Brown leads his team
mates in scoring, having tallied 29
points which is substantially more
than runner-up Bob Davenport's 18.
Knox, the much-publicized pass
ing wizard, has been working out
regularly this week and apparently
is not suffering from his shoulder
injury which he sustained in the
Maryland contest three weeks ago
Knox has a commendable 20 passes
completed out of 30 attempts for 235
yards and four touchdowns.
While not the runner that Brown
is, the tall junior has picked up 85
yards in 21 carries for a 4.1-yard
average. The versatile back also
handles Coach Sanders' punting
problems, having averaged 37 yards
a try for 13 attempts.
CAPTAIN NAMED
As far as the Indians are con
cerned, they are still able to remem
ber last year's mismatch and are de
termined not to let it happen again.

Chris Marshall, 210 - pound senior
tackle, has been elected by the team
;ame captain and the veteran, along
vith 223-pound running mate Paul
Wiggin, will make the going plenty
•ough for Bruin backs.
George Diekerson, UCLA assistant
;oach who scouted the Indians last
veek, rates Marshall and Wiggin as
wa of (he best tackles on thfc coast.
I Jiekerson is also high on Jerry Gus
laf on as a passer, and rates Indian
I fullback Bill Tarr as one of the best
running backs in the country.
! COULD BE TOUGH
The Bruin coach reported last
week to Sanders that "the Indians
lave the runners, passers, and re
ceivers and need only put together
their best effort to be real', real
tough."
Bh' loophole in the statement con
cerns Stanford's lack of defense.
Bruin coaches feel that an inspired
Card eleven could tally often enough
but the intention is to alternate
Brown and Knox at the tailback po
sition until the right Bruin combi-
I nation is found and then score
enough points to salt the game away.
Stanford has had tough going de
| ensively against single-wing out-
I its this season. CSC didn't gain too
Hin.-istenlly but last week's outing
■ against Michigan State College con
vinced Taylor that something had to
be done if there was any hope of
upsetting Sanders' eleven.


| SAMOAN SLASHER — Both
ered by a pinched nerve in his
leg and forced to back up work
horse Bill Tarr at fullback, A 1
Harrington has not been able
to display his running talents
much this year. The 195-pound
ball-carrier from Samoa trans
ferred from Menlo JC this fall
with an outstanding reputation.
Harrington should be ready for
the Bruin battle tomorrow al
though he re-injured his leg
early this week in practice.


WINGBACK FLASH—Jim Decker,!
brilliant «vingback in UCLA's single
wing attack, will be in the starting
lineup tomorrow when the Bruins
go after a repeat of last year's vic
tory over Stanford.
