# Card Eleven To Meet Uclan On Gridiron
## Marshall Is Captain For Bruin Contest 
### JIM PIGOTT 
For those football fans who
are fortunate enough to wrestle
their way into Stanford's Sta
dium tomorrow, there will be a
top flight tussle going on from
2 to 4 in the afternoon.
Coach Henry (Red) Sanders
brings his always potent Bruins up
from the south this weekend to face
Chuck Taylor's revenge-happy In
dians. The game, which will be the
Cards' third home contest of the
year, is expected to draw some
45.000 spectators under clear skies.
Stanford, which has exhibited a
tendency to be erratic this year, is
likely to be hot this weekend and
if this happens, look out. Fans in
the area can remember when Gary
Kerkorian and Bobby Garrett led
their respective squads to victories
over other highly . favored Uclau
teams.
In fact, a Sanders-coached team
hasn't won a football game here
since 1949, the first year for the
Bruin boss, when the Cards were
eked out in a 14 to 7 thriller. To
morrow's game could be another up
set for ttho Big Red although the
chances aren't rated too good for
the Indians to come out on top.
TOP CONDITION
Physically, Stanford will be in al
most top shape. Only Cards who are
definitely labeled "out" for the con
test are Doug Dick, speedy -sopho-
