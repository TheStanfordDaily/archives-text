# the 						mistake

Visitors and players walked slowly and
: i jke softly in the Stanford dressing room in
til • Coliseum last fall. Chuck Taylor moved
among his team, offering praise and encour
agement to the battered footballers. "We can't
hi that bad," he said.
Next door, UCLA was living it up. Every
body v/as a hero. Practically everybody—or
y jit seemed—had scored a touchdown. Third
stringers had looked like All-Americans. Cele
bi.ilions were planned.

Someone reported the Bruin festivities to
Stanford's mourning partisans. A UCLA man
had been asked what mistakes the Indians had
made during the afternoon. "They made one
mistake," the Bruin replied, "beating us up
there last year" (21-20 in '53).
Coach Dutch Fehring was listening. He spun
toward his dressing room. His voice quiet, yet
almost harsh: "And we're just liable to beat
them up there next year, too."
Tomorrow, next year will have corne.


LAST YEAR. THIS HAPPENED
