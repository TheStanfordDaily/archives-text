Biggest problem in the minds of students,
faculty, and administration today is the same
one that's been in their minds all quarter, name
ly: the traffic problem. It's been bad before,
bat has been steadily getting worse with the
road work currently being done here.
One justifiable complaint against on-campus
student car owners is that too many of them
drive to class when they could just as well
v/alk. University officials and many student
leaders believe that the new traffic problem
with its safety hazards could be eased some
what if more students gave up their road-jam
ming habits of driving to class and walked in
stead.
The Daily has interviewed students on the
driving versus walking problem. Here are a
fi w of the comments:
Joan Peterson, '58, Lagunita Court, car owner:
"I only drive to class when I have a great dis
tance to go, like from the Knoll to History Cor
iicr and then I only attempt it when I have
I lenty of time to look for a parking place. I
(ion't see any reason to drive when my class
]â– : within easy walking distance. It's silly to
congest traffic unnecessarily."
Missy Tiss, '58, Branner, car owner: "I al
v.v ys drive to class if I can avoid walking, even
if it's only across the street. My only problem
is that I'm always late to my classes because
< veryone drives so slowly."
Colleen Redell, '58, Lagunita: "I don't own a
car, but if I did, I still wouldn't drive to class.
The one time that I borrowed a car to go to
class I was 15 minutes late to Civ because it
look me so long to find a parking place."
F.velyn Dees, '58, Ventura, car owner: "I feel
t!i ;t anyone who spends the money to buy and
maintain a car should have the right to drive
it to classes. What bothers me is the people
who wander out in the middle of the street and
ignore the cars, and those who stop you in the

middle of the street (and therefore in a long
line of cars) and ask for a ride."
A 1 Ferris, '58, Village, car owner: "I think it's
a good idea | to drive to class | if you live a little
ways to drive here, but I don't think it's any
more convenient or saves any time to drive
from one end to another after you get here."
Mike Waterman, '58, Stillman: "I don't think
they should drive to class. Most of us who live
at Stillman don't drive, except to chemistry."
Mickey Raitery, '57, off campus, car owner:
"Driving should be limited to off-campus stu
dents."
]uris Petriceks, '57, Palo Alto, car owner:
"Students shouldn't drive unless they live off
campus. I drive to school and then park off
somewhere. But I do think that something
could be done to improve parking in the tri
angle lot so that more cars could park there."
Clint Pooley, '56, Phi Kappa Sigma, car
owner: "Students should be allowed to drive
to classes but faculty should walk. The chain
in front of the Bookstore should be ripped down
so students could drive into the Quad. Also,
Chief Davis should make the road next to the
Geology and Engineering Corner a legal park
ing place."
George Wilson, '56, off campus, car owner:
"A special sticker should be made up for off
campus students allowing them to park in re
served sections near the Quad."
Jim Rudis, '56, Sigma Nu, car owner: "I park
as close as I can to Quad every morning and
then walk to the rest of my classes. One of the
biggest traffic problems is at the intersection
by Roble at noon. If the policeman who sits in
has car and watches would get out and direct
traffic at that time it would help a great deal to
relieve the congestion."
Darrell Johnson, '59, Wilbur Hall, car owner:
. . no problem at all if you don't mind get
ting seven tickets in two weeks."
