# Nominations to Remain Open Until Monday Noon
## Ten Candidates File for 16 Offices; Faulkner Blames 'Student Apathy' 
### 
"Due to the apparent apathy toward student government, nomi
nations will remain open until Monday noon," reports Chuck
Falkner, chairman of the Election Commission.
Only 10 persons had been nominated to fill the 16 offices on
the ballot in the Oct. 24-28 primaries and elections, when Falkner

made the decision at 5 p.m. yester-"
day to extend the nominations filing
until noon Monday.
"I'm very disappointed in the
whole turnout. It seems to me that
out of the several thousand students
at Stanford, quite a few more should
be interested in the workings of
their government. In the past by
this time, at least 10 to 15 freshmen
have turned out to file for the fresh
man class presidency.
"For the information of the frosh,
the offices of class vice-president
and business manager are designed
so that either a man or a woman can
handle them. Under the new consti
tution, no precedent has been estab
lished in regard to the sex of the
candidates," said Falkner.
MKETINCI POSTPONED
The nominations extension makes
it necessary to postpone the time of
the candidates' meeting scheduled
for 5 p.m. today until 9 p.m. Mon
day. No campaigning other than
word of mouth will be permitted
until after the candidates have been
briefed at the meeting.
ASSU vice-presidential candidate
Helen Zarifes still runs unopposed
in her second bid for the office. She
was defeated in a record election
turnout last spring by Jerry Fitz
gerald, who officially resigned her
post Wednesday owing to her early
graduation this March.
PIJOSH CANDIDATES
Biggest nomination turnout thus
far is in the race for frosh president.
The five candidates who have filed
are Douglas Brown, Stewart Erick
son, Don Proudfoot, Mike Willem
. en. and Alan Kenison.
Roger Lewis is a candidate for
freshman business manager; An
drew Kjos has filed for Village rep
resentative: Loube Larson, for La
gunita representative; and Ernie
Hartz, for Toyon-clubs representa
tive.
No candidates have filed for the
remaining offices, which include
representatives from Men's Row,
Branncr, Roble, and Wilbur. Two
candidates each will be elected from
those filing for Women's and Men's
Councils. The frosh vice-presiden
tial candidacy also remains unfilled.
