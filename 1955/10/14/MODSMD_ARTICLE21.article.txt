# The 						Dilemma of France and North Africa— An Algerian Foreign Student Presents His Views
## 
### 
(Editor's note: Stanford foreign student Jean-Louis Germain, from
Algeria, has written the following letter presenting a native's views
011 the important Freneh - North Africa dilemma. We feel that liis
views are an important contribution to the discussion of the issues,
liecau.se he has been more than an obstvver; as an Algerian, and as a
student in Paris, he has lived the problem.)
To the Editor:
An epidemic of op:nions seems all at once to have swept the campus.
The problem of North Africa makes the headlines and produces a rich
crop of articles, lectures and discussions, all more or less to the point so
far as i can judge. I do not claim to be an expert on North African affairs.
Never have 1 written anything about these intricate questions, nor have
I ever spoken publiciy about them. II I venture to write these lines, it is
in orcer to fight certain ideas which I consider wrong.
I am a French citizen, born in Algeria, where my family has resided
lor over four generations. My father has not only managed to cultivate
successfully his possessions in Algeria, but he has also gone to Morocco,
and. having arrived alone in the plain of Sous, he has succectled in estab
lishing a thriving cultivation in this arid region. So he is a settler as we
say, or a colonialist as we are branded, because both terms can be used
to translate the French word "colon. 'lhis introduction was neevssary
because you have the right to know who is speaking to you.
1 he question must be discussed on three levels: problems ol economy, j
human and social problems, and the part played by various external j
propagandas.
INSIDIOUS PROPAGANDAS
The most insidious of these propagandas is; the one with'which the
American public is best acquainted. France is weak, and the government
is never secure. France is a colonialist nation. She does not respect the
Rights ol Man. nor does she live up to American ideas and practices of
democracy. It is also said, and said again, thai any nation having reached
a certain degree of evolution must achieve its independence in spite ol' the
opposed interests represented by the colonial power exploiting the strug
gling young nation. All this is quite logical. However, 100 often one for

gets to ask the question whether this nation is truly capable of self-gov
ernment, whether the members of this nation constitute one or several
ethnic groups, and whether we are familiar with these problems other
than through the medium of newspapers and periodicals. Many French
people and even more foreigners must,' perforce, answer no. However,
the whole problem must be stated in these terms.
The great error of France in North Africa has been to try out the
principles of the French Revolution, namely, that all people are born equal
:>nd able to progress according to the same norms of reason. France ha
forgotten that its own civilization, a western and dynamic civilization, had
to clash with an Oriental and static civilization, the latter having its owr
set of values and merits which have withstood the test of several cen
turies. As a consequence, a revolution was achieved where an evolutior.
was intended.
Now to narrow down the discussion. North Africa is a country of great
potentialities. This is especially true of Morocco. Right now Moroect
barely emerges from economic nothingness. The country is extremely poor.
All the hopes lor its future are based on its immense mineral reserves
the existence of which is still dubious. If these hopes are justified, tht
problem of raising the capital needed for exploitation remains a majoi
issue.
NO ECONOMIC PROGRAM
If one wants to remain in the sober reality, one notices that the budge
of Morocco is based for the mo. t part on agriculture, which, in spite of it
shortcomings and misfortunes, sustains the country. A great effort ha.
been made in this field, and only the French settlers have initiated it am
carried it out. With governmental help, better success could have beer
achieved. But the government, in-tead of improving the soil, chose t(
spend vast sums on industrial as well as touristic ventures; canneries, sky
scrapers, and showplaces. Today most of these ventures have folded up. I
the government had developed the cultivation of cotton and wheat, Franct
would be able to clothe and feed the indigenous population. The govern
ment of Paris, having no political program, has deprived the French settle)
of an economic program.
The failure of developing the agricultural potentialities of the country
is directly responsible for the mass migration of country fellahs (Arabiai
agricultural workers) to the cities, where they swell the teeming nev,
proletariat. They live in slums called bidonvilles (a bidon is a gasoline car
from which these shanties are constructed). These bidonvilles are tht
focal points of all the unrest and the uprisings.
You can see now how the settlers have been truly put on the horn
of a dilemma between the unrealistic policy of the government in Paris
and the misguided rancor of the Arabs. In spite of the desperate effort
of the settlers and of the government to provide adequate quarters for the
population of the Arab slums, the problem cannot be solved, because new
waves ol fellahs pour into the shanties faster than lodgings can be provided
To top it all, the population as a whole is increasing rapidly. As such, t?u
righteous reproach to France that they should have provided in advanct
for this increasing population is empty rhetoric.
STIRRING UNREST
To make matters worse, all the unrest is sparked by the cultured oi
hall-cultured Arabian city-dwellers who read newspapers and listen to
Egyptian radio broadcasts, and who are a very small fraction of the total
population. Those Arabs who live in the country, and who are free from
the anti-French propaganda, consider the "colons" as masters unchallenged,
yet just and generous. To the Moroccans, justice is the cardinal virtue.
The part played by the various foreign propagandas is very important
and contributes to the embitterment of everyone. First, there is the na
tionalistic voice of a new Arab world, dreaming of a united Arabia undei
the green standard of the prophet. This Utopia is a welcome outlet for the
futilistic Arab leaders from Egypt to Iraq, from Yemen to Saudi Arabia.
Secondly, the Communistic propaganda peddles its wares in any place
where there is social unrest and strife. Finally, we must mention the
propaganda based on a distortion of the United Nations' ideas according
sovereignty to nations still in their infancy.
In conclusion, I do not try to offer any panacea, because at this time
there is no such medicine, and whoever advertises it is a quack. The truth
remains that the colon, now the scapegoat of old factions, has brought to
the backbone of North Africa—that is, to its agriculture and to its economy
—whatever improvements benefit the North African people today. If there
ever was an illustration of biting the hand that feeds you, North Africa
provides the perfect example.
