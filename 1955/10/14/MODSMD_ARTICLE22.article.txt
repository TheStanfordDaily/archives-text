## Blanchenay: 'Morocco Trouble Stems from 3 Major Causes' 
### WALLY SIMPSON 
Three major reasons have contributed toward the troubles in
Morocco.
This was the belief expressed by Henri Blanchenay, president
of the Societe Generale de New York" and yesterday's speaker
at the bi-weekly political talks conducted by the Institute of Inter
national Relations. According to Mr. I

Blanchenay, "The Moroccan troubles
came first with the errors the French !
themselves committed. We forgot to
turn the page."
Elaborating on the first major rea
son. Blanchenay pointed out that
the population of Morocco has dou
bled in the past 20 years. Production
of food and necessities has not in
creased proportionately. Also, the
French have created a class of high
ly educated Moroccans without cre
ating the positions for them to oc
cupy. The French Government erred
in this by supporting a sultan who
had religious but not true temporal i
authority.
Alt AH LEAGUE
The second reason for the troubles,
according to Blanchenay, was and
still is the influence of the Arab
League—especially Egypt, which has
only in the past few years attained
full independence from England, i
The Arab League has made a few
untactful mistakes in its desire to see
all colonial peoples achieve their in
dependence.
The spread of Communist propa
ganda in Morocco is possibly the j
third reason for the troubles there. j
However, Blanchenay stated that he
believed this influence is not of!
major importance.
"I personally believe," said Blan
chenay, "that we have done more j
than required in assisting those peo
ple."
MAJOR DIFFICULTIES
There have been major difficulties,
however. Tradition, he said, has
made the problem of educating the
natives very difficult. It has only
been within the past 15 years that
the French Government has been
able to convince the population that
women should be allowed to receive ,
an education.
Thus, the idea of democracy has
yet to be inculcated into the minds '
of the average native. It is for this
reason that "we do not believe full
independence at this time is possi
ble." Over three-fifths of the popu
lation—though they can read—will
not even look at a newspaper.
Blanchenay expressed the feeling
that the future of Morocco could be
bright. It is only natural that France

has been holding on to that state.
He expressed it in these words:
"Morocco is a pet of France, and
France is like a mother trying to
hold on to her daughter after she
has expressed the desire to marry."
But, according to Blanchenay, Mo
rocco still needs France.
Most intelligent Moroccans realize
that France is almost Morocco's only
market for goods and her only sup
plier of technicians and finance.
HOME RULE
A greater degree of home rule is
necessary, said Blanchenay. When
France established her protectorate
over Morocco in 1912, there was no
true government.
If a government can be set up in
Morocco, then the French Govern
ment will have a definite established
authority with which to deal, rather
than the nebulous authority of the
sultan. It will still be quite a few
years before full independence can
be achieved.
T'he French Government realizes
it cannot force democracy upon the
people of Morocco. Only through
education can this be done, but it
will take more than two generations
to accomplish this.
