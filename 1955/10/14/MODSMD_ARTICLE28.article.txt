# Mr. Winstead Sheffield Weaver, A Gentleman of Legendary Note
## Doodles' Deeds Defy Description 
### RIC TEAGUE 
When Winstead Sheffield
Weaver arrived at Stanford in
1931, he was, it can be assumed,
a little like most other freshmen.
Except for his name, and a pair
of bat-wing ears.
Weaver was from Los Angeles
and, with whatever motivation
moves Angelenos, decided to major
in philosophy. During his stay on
the Farm, he switched to psychol
ogy and was active in Ram's Head,
Hammer and CofTin Society, and
soccer, and was a member of Beta
T'heta Pi.
On that September morning 24
years ago, Winstead Weaver didn't
know that he was to become the
greatest of all college legends, any
where. To become a legend, though,
he had a natural start —his class
mates, a little nonplused by the
"Winstead," decided to call him
"Doodles."
ENTER DOODLES
Now that he was Doodles Weaver,
the rest came naturally. He became
the funniest thing in the history of
the University. But that doesn't
mean that he wasn't a student. In
1949 he was quoted in The Daily as
having "enjoyed myself at Stanford
while simultaneously playing two
parts—buffoon and student."
Doodles received tTie A.B. degree
in January, 1937—plus 83 for 183
units. He also did some graduate
work in psychology under Professor
Ernest R. Hilgard. En route to his
degree, Doodles built a legend that
was to grow and grow even after he
left the Farm.
Now, most of the stories about
Doodles have either been manufac
tured or embellished by someone
who knows someone who overheard
someone else . . . Doodles would
probably deny most of them, but
there is little doubt that some must
be pure fact. The puzzling thing is,
no one knows which are true.
For example: In the thirties when

the footballers traveled south to
meet either USC or UCLA, there j
would be general competition among I
a number of roughs lucky enough to I
have automobiles to see who could
get to Los Angeles soonest. The race
started from the Post Office.
One fall saw Doodles take off from
the Post Office followed by the
cheers of miscellaneous Betas and
other admirers. As he turned around
to wave, he smashed into a tree in
front of the Bookstore. Doodles
hailed a cab and the last his well
wishers heard him say was "L.A.—
and step on it!"
Or another: Weaver's professor of
chemistry never liked students who
arrived late to his lectures. This
feeling is relatively common among
professors with eight o'clock lec
tures. Doodles (the story goes) was
chronically a late arriver. The pro
fessor, to combat this tardiness,
locked the door at eight sharp.
DOODLES FIGHTS BACK
Doodles, to combat this enforced
punctuality, arrived at eight the
next morning armed with a bucket
of water for shaving and another
bucket full of breakfast food and
milk. He moved quietly to his seat
and shaved and breakfasted. He was
dressed in pajamas. (The professor
was reportedly outraged.)
One of the most ol'ten-told stories
describes a very solemn occasion
with a distinguished alumnus un
veiling a statue of Leland Stanford
before a large gathering. The crowd
had just heard a laudatory speech
and was quiet—waiting for the alum
to pull the string that would drop
a curtain from the statue. As he did,
the quiet turned to a startled hush.
Sitting in the Senator's marble lap
was Doodles, a beer in one hand, a
cigar in the other.
There are a lot more stories about
the man, Doodles Weaver. Like the
one about him disassembling a
Model T Ford—and later reassem
bling it in a friend's room while the

friend was home over spring vaca
' tion. Or the one about how he beat
| the long reg lines that strung from
I the Administration Building (now
the Law School) all the way to the
Bookstore.
In that anecdote, Doodles is re
ported to have arrived in front of
the building in a rented black li
mousine. Two cohorts rolled a red
carpet to the door as two others
trumpeted a fanfare. The four of
them then carried Doodles to the
head of the line on a sedan chair
made of two-by-fours and an old
toilet seat.
ATHLETIC, TOO
These weren't Weaver's only ex
tra-curricular activities if, indeed,
he did them at all. He played var
sity soccer in '33, '34, '35, and '36,
and coached it in '37. He was also
serious about his comic ability—and
a review of the 1935 Big Game Gaie
ties said that "of the old standbys,
only Doodles Weaver was up to
snuff, and he gave what was per
haps the best performance of his pe
culiar career."
Winstead Sheffield Weaver has
drifted, to a degree, from the com
edy that made him legendary. He is
now producer of the Horace Heidt
Band Wagon television show. May
be he'll be here for Homecoming.
Who knows? According to legend,
his actions never were very pre
meditated.


"I'VE BEEN FRAMED"—That might be Doodles Weaver's reac
tion to the accompanying chronicle of his legendary Stanford
career. Doodles is now a television producer but stories of his
exploits while a student run barefoot through the pages of Farm
undergraduate history. It wasn't the microwave lab that made
Stanford famous—it was Doodles.
