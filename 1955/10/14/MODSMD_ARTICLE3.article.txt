# Ralph Outlines Policy Plans To Legislature

Associate Editor, The Daily
ASSU President George
Ralph outlined the major areas
in which he would like to work
during the coming year in his
"State of the Union" message
delivered before the Legislature
Wednesday night.
The student union, public rela
tions, parking, and NSA will be the
four main concerns.
"Getting as much as we can in
the building, keeping in mind not to
include what we already have, will
be a main effort in union planning.
"For example, the Stanford union
would not need as many lounges as
other universities because on this
residence campus students have
lounge space in their dorms.
ORGANIZATION
"Another vital topic relating to
the union will be setting up a college
union organization. Many colleges
have a board of governors composed
of students, administrators, and
sometimes alumni, to determine un
ion policy and regulate all the cul
tural and social activities that go on
around it."
The new union would provide
many students a chance to work.
Ralph suggested a type of civil serv
ice system to select the student ad
ministrative head of the organiza
tion.
The .creation of a college union
could change the present system of
student government. If the union
would handle all social and cultural
affairs, the elected representatives
on the Legislature could concentrate
on formulating campus-wide policy
and working with the administra
tion and local groups.
CABINET DUTIES ,
Cabinet duties, Ralph suggested,
might be better filled by the cabinet
of the board of governors of the
college union.
Ralph proposed the expansion of
Public Relations Board. He saw this
as a vital area, with possibilities for
"a good deal of growth."
Some of the activities now under
taken by Student-Faculty Commit
tee, Student - Faculty Employment
Committee, and Speech Activities
Board, have public relations aspects
which might well be co-ordinated,
he said.
The parking problem has already
been attacked by a committee
formed recently with Bob Maddock
as chairman.
This quarter "may be essentially
the selling period" of NSA, Ralph
thinks. He expects the National
Students' Association to expand its
campus activities, and would like to
have a student referendum on Stan
ford's membership about the middle
of winter quarter.
The Legislature decided to have
weekly discussions of resolutions
brought up at the NSA Congress.
