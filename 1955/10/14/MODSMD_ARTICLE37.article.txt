An institute of higher learning has two principal methods of
bestowing rewards upon deserving scholars —endowed profes
sorships and scholarships.
The endowed professorship rewards the more mature talent,
while the scholarship awards the gifted student with recognition

for personal achievement. Both offer*
an opportunity to achieve more.
According to the office of the Uni
versity General Secretary, the his
tory of endowed professorships—or j
"chairs," as they are often called— j
lias been traced as far back as 1502.
It was Margaret of Richmond, the |
mother of Henry Vli of England,
who founded the Margaret Proles- 1
sorship of Divinity at Oxford in J
1502. This endowed professorship ]
still survives, after i l /n centuries.
A continuous line of distinguished
scholars has been honored by this
chair. In return, the professors re
ward Oxford and the world with
their knowledge.
Recognizing the importance of a
great teacher and the need ol free
ing him for his work, permanent
endowed professorships have been
established in institutions of learn
ing.
The teacher who holds an endowed
chair is chosen willi great care. Only 1

recognized achievement and person
al integrity are even selected as like
