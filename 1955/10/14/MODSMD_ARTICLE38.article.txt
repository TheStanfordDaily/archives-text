# Tribe Ends Drill For Uclan Game
## 
### 
Coach Chuck Taylor sent Stan
j ford's varsity gridders through an
other workout without pads yester
j day in preparation for UCLA's Bru
ins tomorrow.
The Cards drilled both on offense
j and defense, although not seeing
| any contact work. Taylor worked
| the backs and ends on pass patterns
which may be used against the
! Uclans.
The Indian mentor has not yet de
' cided whether he will start Ernie
Dorn or sophomore Jeri McMillin
jat halfback tomorrow. Dorn has
started every game this year, while
McMillin has been working with the
first string in practice this week.
