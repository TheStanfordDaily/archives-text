# Evans Faces Phi Sig Win
## 
### JIM PRICK 
Versatile Bob Evans flipped three
touchdown passes to lead his Phi Sig
teammates to an 18-6 intramural
football win over Sigma Nu. Evans,
a varsity baseballer in the spring,
completed 13 of 23 passes while com
pletely dominating offensive play.
The Phi Sigs rolled up a 12-0 lead
on two quick first-half touchdowns,
and fought off a second-stanza Sigma
Nu surge to win going away.
End Ted Herman set up the open
ing TD as he returned an inter
cepted pass 29 yards to the Sigma
Nu 11-yard line. Two plays later
Evans tossed his first 6-point, aerial
to Herman in the corner of the end
zone. On the try for point, Evans
was nailed behind the line.
Marching right back, the Sigma
Nil's appeared headed for the tying
marker. But after tailback Bob
Jackson had completed six passes in
the drive, the attack ran out of gas
on the Phi Sig 13-yard stripe.
Bob Evans retaliated quickly,
driving the PS seven to a second
touchdown in nine plays. A 1 Davis
made a diving catch of Evans' 17-
yard toss on the goal line.
Davis also latched on to a 50-yard
Evans aerial for the third Phi Sig
marker on the third play of the
second half.
Sigma Nu hit for their only score,
game, as Jim Brophy connected for
with five minutes remaining in the
three straight passes in a 39-yard
drive. Lee Miller grabbed the TD
on a 9-yard pass.
