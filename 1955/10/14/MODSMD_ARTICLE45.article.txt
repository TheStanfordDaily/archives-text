# Bob Maddock Heads New Traffic Committee In Formulating Plans to Relieve Congestion
## 
### STEW TOY 
Although it has had no time
to "gather facts and figures,"
the new special committee on
traffic problems, approved Wed
nesday by the ASSU, is formu
lating possible plans to relieve
campus traffic congestion.
Chairman Bob Maddock and
members Tom Tilton and Jane
Helm, who will be joined by fac
ulty consultant Anatole G. Mazour
and two other undesignated mem
bers, have arrived at one conclusion:
"Right now," Maddock stated,
"there's a bigger traffic problem than
there has ever been in the history
of the University. And telling peo
ple not to drive to class won't do a
thing."
T WO AI .TERN ATI VES
There are two alternatives, he
said, to solve the problem of traffic
congestion and parking in the Quad
area.
They are (1) outlaw all automo
biles from campus, (2) make those

who drive to class Tae handicapped ;
so they won't want to.
"We don't want to ban all cars," I
Maddock says, "so we're trying to !
do something along the latter line.
"One way is to install parking me- [
ters. They have the advantages of |
providing revenue for roads and
parking lots, making it easier for the
police to check overtime parking,
and making it harder for one car to
park in several spaces."
The daily cost and nuisance to
students would theoretically dis
courage them from driving to class.
"We don't know the cost of park
ing meters, though," Maddock con
tinued. "We would naturally have

to look into this extensively before
acting.
SUGGESTIONS WANTED
"I don't like parking meters.
They're a nuisance. But something
has to be done, and if anyone has
any better suggestions, let him come
forward."
Additional parking lots are al
ways a possibility, but. according to
Police Chief Gordon Davis, paved,
marked lots would cost $200 per car.
Another plan, to supplement
parking meters, would require stu
dents to purchase registration stick
ers for their cars in order to park
on campus.
After four or five parking or traf
fic offenses, the stickers might be
taken away completely, prohibiting
the student from parking anywhere
on campus.
VISITOR PARKING
A special area would be set aside
for visitors' parking—now a sore
spot in the campus traffic setup—in
front of the main Quad entrance.
Permits would be available to them
free at some central location.
A possibility to help eliminate
speeding in congested campus areas
would be the installation of "traffic
bumps." These concrete protrusions,
sunk into the asphalt at short in
tervals, would discourage speeds of
over five miles per hour.
"If you go any faster," Maddock
says, "they tear the bottom out of
your car."

ulty consultant Anatole G. Mazour
and two other undesignated mem
bers, have arrived at one conclusion:
"Right now," Maddock stated,
"there's a bigger traffic problem than
there has ever been in the history
of the University. And telling peo
ple not to drive to class won't do a

There are two alternatives, he
said, to solve the problem of traffic
congestion and parking in the Quad
area.
They are (1) outlaw all automo
biles from campus, (2) make those

who drive to class Tae handicapped ;
so they won't want to.
"We don't want to ban all cars," I
Maddock says, "so we're trying to !
do something along the latter line.
"One way is to install parking me- [
ters. They have the advantages of |
providing revenue for roads and
parking lots, making it easier for the
police to check overtime parking,
and making it harder for one car to
park in several spaces."
The daily cost and nuisance to
students would theoretically dis
courage them from driving to class.
"We don't know the cost of park
ing meters, though," Maddock con
tinued. "We would naturally have

to look into this extensively before
acting.
SUGGESTIONS WANTED
"I don't like parking meters.
They're a nuisance. But something
has to be done, and if anyone has
any better suggestions, let him come
forward."
Additional parking lots are al
ways a possibility, but. according to
Police Chief Gordon Davis, paved,
marked lots would cost $200 per car.
Another plan, to supplement
parking meters, would require stu
dents to purchase registration stick
ers for their cars in order to park
on campus.
After four or five parking or traf
fic offenses, the stickers might be
taken away completely, prohibiting
the student from parking anywhere
on campus.
VISITOR PARKING
A special area would be set aside
for visitors' parking—now a sore
spot in the campus traffic setup—in
front of the main Quad entrance.
Permits would be available to them
free at some central location.
A possibility to help eliminate
speeding in congested campus areas
would be the installation of "traffic
bumps." These concrete protrusions,
sunk into the asphalt at short in
tervals, would discourage speeds of
over five miles per hour.
"If you go any faster," Maddock
says, "they tear the bottom out of
your car."

Although it has had no time
to "gather facts and figures,"
the new special committee on
traffic problems, approved Wed
nesday by the ASSU, is formu
lating possible plans to relieve
campus traffic congestion.
