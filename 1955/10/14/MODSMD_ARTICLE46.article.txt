# Two Songs Added to Repertoire For Farm Homecoming Festivities
## 
### 
Two new songs have been added to the Stanford repertoire.
Next week yell leaders will distribute copies of these and other
songs and yells to the living groups. The booklets were not
ready in time for the UCLA game tomorrow, so the songs are re
printed here.
