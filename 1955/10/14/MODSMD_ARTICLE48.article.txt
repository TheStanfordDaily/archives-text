# SON OF A GAMBOLIER
## 
### 
Oh. I wish I had an ocean of rum, or
sugar a million pound;
The dear old Quad to mix it in, and
the town to stir it 'round.
I'd drink to the health of the Cardi
nal, so glorious and true;
And I'd join in the rollicking chorus,
To Hell with the Gold and Blue!
Chorus
I'm a son of a, son of a, son of a, son
of a, son of a gambolier;
Son of a, son of a, son of a, son of a,
son of a gambolier.
Like every honest fellow, I like my
lager beer;
I'm a rambling rake of poverty, a son
of a gambolier.
Oh, there's a road to Rossott's, as
plain as plain can be;
: And if you want to see a wreckâ€”
just take a look at me!
For I have been to Rossott's, and i
tasted of the beer.
| And this is why my eyes are weak, |
and I have to rest a year.

Oh, here's to dear old Stanford,
where the color of life is read;
We'll rise and give the Varsity, from
our coffins when we're dead.
And when we mount the Golden
Stairs we'll give St. Peter the cue
To join the rollicking chorus. To.;
Hell with the Gold and Blue!
