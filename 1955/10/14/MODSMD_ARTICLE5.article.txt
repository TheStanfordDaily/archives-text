### 
Tomorrow night Stern Hall will
present a dance to top off the activi
ties of Homecoming Week.
Chuck Travis' orchestra will pro
vide the music for the dance, to be
held at Stern Hall from 9 to 1. Tick
ets, priced at $1.50, are on sale today
and will be sold at the door Satur
day night. Appropriate dress is
"dressy sport."
Couples may dance either in the
Stern lobby or on the new patio,
completed on Sept. 15. This new
patio was provided by funds from
the Lucie Stern estate, at a total
cost of $10,400.
"It's in the Cards," theme for the
whole Homecoming week end, will
be the basis for decorations. The
dance is costing four times any pre

innovations is "black lighting" for
extra decorative effect.
This will.be an all-campus affair,
and, beside Stanford students, all
alumni and UCLA students are in
vited, according to the committee.
General chairman for the dance is

tions; Win Tyler, publicity; and
