# ‘Club the Cubs' Is Battle Cry For Homecoming Game Rally
## 
### 
"Club the Cubs" will be the battle cry this evening at the Rally
for the Stanford Homecoming game.
According to Ed Bordenkircher and Buzz McCoy, the program
is to be packed from start to finish with such things as announce
ment of the winning float entry and a yell by the UCLA yell sguad.

The rally will be held in Frost
Amphitheater directly after the float
parade. First on the program is a
combination yell and song known
as the Cardinal Fighting Song. Next
is a revival of an "oldie"—"Son of a
Gambolier."
After several yells by both the
Stanford yell leaders and UCLA yell
leaders, Joe Ruetz, assistant Stan
ford coach, will speak. Ruetz has
scouted for the Stanford - UCLA
game, so is expected to reveal just
how the teams stack up.
Stanford ball players will then be
introduced to the rally-goers, after
which will be entertainment in the
form of a skit from Gaieties. The
closing song will be "It's in the
Cards," the finale number of the
1952 Gaieties.
Rally Com has promised a special
closing ceremony tonight. Although
they will not reveal what it is, it
will be directed toward avengement
of last year's UCLA 72-0 defeat.
Rally Corn's plans for the rally
have been in progress for the past
few weeks. Besides the stickers
saying "Club the Cubs," which are
to be distributed at the Cellar this
morning, they also plan to send out
Dittoed song sheets to all the living
halls to be used tonight.
