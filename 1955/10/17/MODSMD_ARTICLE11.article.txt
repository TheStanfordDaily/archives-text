EARLY SCORES
UCLA didn't keep their \
offense under wraps for lony
barely worked up a jiood
running up three quick touch
almo.it at will through a confused
Card defense. On the first Bruin
play from scrimmage, Sam Brown,
brilliant Uclan tailback, gave warn
ing of what was to come by gallop
ing 2(J yards.
Brown's run put. the ball on Stan
ford's 40-yard line, and after six
plays UCLA had a fourth-and-four
situation on Stanford's 24. If the
Indians had held at this point, and
taken over the ball on downs, there
is no telling what might have hap
pened the rest of the afternoon.
But, as it was, Brown cracked
through the canter of the line for 21
yards and a first down on Stanford's
three.
From here it was child's play for
Ail-American Bob Davenport, Bruin
fullback, to plunge across over his
own left tackle position.
This was only the beginning as
the visitors applied unrelenting pres
! sure and battered the defense into
{ temporary submission. After Tarr
| received Brown's kickoff, and the
Indians worked the ball up to their
own 37, UCLA took over after Gus
tafson's punt on their own 42-yard
j line.
The 58 yards to Stanford's goal
were traversed in just four plays,
including a 15-yard Bruin penalty
for holding.
The big gainer in the drive was
Brown's pass to left end John Smith,
who took the ball on the Indian 34
and ran unmolested the rest of the
way. The burly tailback, who does
everything except handle the public
address system, converted after both
touchdowns to raise the score to
14-0.
LAST TOUCHDOWN
The last Bruin score of the quar
ter—and the game—came four min
utes later when Doug Bradley, sub
stitute tailback, passed and ran his
team 45 yards in nine plays for the
tally. The scoring play was an 18-
yard pass play to sub quarterback
Bruce Ballard. Brown replaced
Bradley and made the conversion
which turned out to be all-impor
tant.
The situation looked bad by now,
but the "never say die" Indians were
fighting for their lives, and soon fans
noticed that plays which had been
big gainers in the first quarter were
now being reduced to short gains.
McDougall, Bruin substitute, was
forced to kick on fourth down—the
first Bruin punt of the day—after an
alert Card defense had stiffened to
hold Jim Decker in the center of
the line.
A rejuvenated %tan 112 or d team
sprang Tarr for 11 yards at right

end, and then John Brodie, who
came in to replace Jerry Gustaf:on,
cranked up his throwing arm and
hit Jerry Angove for 19 more yards.
This put the ball on UCLA's 43-yard
line and marked the first time that
Taylor's charges had penetrated into
enemy territory.
The drive ended at this point,
however, as th-e defense stiffened
and Raftery was forced to kick.
After an exchange if kicks, Stan
ford took over again, and this time
the home forces were able to drive
to Ihe Bruin 31.
Brodie, who enjoyed one of his
greatest days, pitched for two first
downs und ran for another, in addi
tion to hitting Ernie Dorn, Card
halfback, and McMillin for short
gains.
Try as the Stanfords would, how
ever, Red Sanders' big, tough line
rose to the challenge, and Brodie's
drive bogged down on the Uclan 39.
UCLA fashioned a return drive of
their own, at this point, and the half
ended with the ball deep in Card
territory.
Although Stanford had come to
life during the second quarter of the
game, few people were ready for
what happened in the third and
fourth quarters. When asked what
made the difference between the
team's play in the first and second
halves, end Gary Van Galder stated
that it, was only "a few mental lapses
in the first quarter that beat us. We
beat them in three out of four quar
ters."
Taylor told reporters that he didn't
say anything out of the ordinary
during the halftime intermission.
TEAM SETTLES DOWN
Whatever it was that it took to
get the Big Red machine to settle
down happened, and the kids from
the Farm displayed a different brand
of football in the second half from
that shown during the first 30 min
utes.
Stanford kicked off and contained
the Bruins in their first series of
downs. After an exchange of punts,
Stanford started its first scoring
drive on their 34. After racking up
four first downs, which featured
Brodie's passes and McMillin's hard
running, reliable Bill Tarr caught
the defense flatfooted and raced the
final 7 yards over his own left tackle.
When Raftery came in to make the
conversion, things, looked considera
bly brighter.
The next time Stanford got the
ball they scored again, and fans in
the stands were wild with excite
ment. The drive started in Uclan
territory on the 37 and required only
four plays to be executed.
McMILLIN TALLIES
Alter Tarr got 1 yard at left tackle,
Brodie passed for 19 to Beatie on
the 17. On the next play McMillin,
who sparkled all day, ripped through
the Bruin secondary after sweeping
around his right end for the final 17
yards. John Stanton, Indian tackle,
contributed the key block for the
wiry halfback on his scoring jaunt.
After Tarr's placement went wide
in the second conversion attempt, it
was an uphill road toward victory
for the Indians, but they never gave
up. When the gun sounded the end
of the game, Stanford was knocking
at the door with the ball on the
Bruin 3-yard line.

EARLY SCORES
UCLA didn't keep their \
offense under wraps for lony
barely worked up a jiood
running up three quick touch
almo.it at will through a confused
Card defense. On the first Bruin
play from scrimmage, Sam Brown,
brilliant Uclan tailback, gave warn
ing of what was to come by gallop
ing 2(J yards.
Brown's run put. the ball on Stan
ford's 40-yard line, and after six
plays UCLA had a fourth-and-four
situation on Stanford's 24. If the
Indians had held at this point, and
taken over the ball on downs, there
is no telling what might have hap
pened the rest of the afternoon.
But, as it was, Brown cracked
through the canter of the line for 21
yards and a first down on Stanford's
three.
From here it was child's play for
Ail-American Bob Davenport, Bruin
fullback, to plunge across over his
own left tackle position.
This was only the beginning as
the visitors applied unrelenting pres
! sure and battered the defense into
{ temporary submission. After Tarr
| received Brown's kickoff, and the
Indians worked the ball up to their
own 37, UCLA took over after Gus
tafson's punt on their own 42-yard
j line.
The 58 yards to Stanford's goal
were traversed in just four plays,
including a 15-yard Bruin penalty
for holding.
The big gainer in the drive was
Brown's pass to left end John Smith,
who took the ball on the Indian 34
and ran unmolested the rest of the
way. The burly tailback, who does
everything except handle the public
address system, converted after both
touchdowns to raise the score to
14-0.
LAST TOUCHDOWN
The last Bruin score of the quar
ter—and the game—came four min
utes later when Doug Bradley, sub
stitute tailback, passed and ran his
team 45 yards in nine plays for the
tally. The scoring play was an 18-
yard pass play to sub quarterback
Bruce Ballard. Brown replaced
Bradley and made the conversion
which turned out to be all-impor
tant.
The situation looked bad by now,
but the "never say die" Indians were
fighting for their lives, and soon fans
noticed that plays which had been
big gainers in the first quarter were
now being reduced to short gains.
McDougall, Bruin substitute, was
forced to kick on fourth down—the
first Bruin punt of the day—after an
alert Card defense had stiffened to
hold Jim Decker in the center of
the line.
A rejuvenated %tan 112 or d team
sprang Tarr for 11 yards at right

end, and then John Brodie, who
came in to replace Jerry Gustaf:on,
cranked up his throwing arm and
hit Jerry Angove for 19 more yards.
This put the ball on UCLA's 43-yard
line and marked the first time that
Taylor's charges had penetrated into
enemy territory.
The drive ended at this point,
however, as th-e defense stiffened
and Raftery was forced to kick.
After an exchange if kicks, Stan
ford took over again, and this time
the home forces were able to drive
to Ihe Bruin 31.
Brodie, who enjoyed one of his
greatest days, pitched for two first
downs und ran for another, in addi
tion to hitting Ernie Dorn, Card
halfback, and McMillin for short
gains.
Try as the Stanfords would, how
ever, Red Sanders' big, tough line
rose to the challenge, and Brodie's
drive bogged down on the Uclan 39.
UCLA fashioned a return drive of
their own, at this point, and the half
ended with the ball deep in Card
territory.
Although Stanford had come to
life during the second quarter of the
game, few people were ready for
what happened in the third and
fourth quarters. When asked what
made the difference between the
team's play in the first and second
halves, end Gary Van Galder stated
that it, was only "a few mental lapses
in the first quarter that beat us. We
beat them in three out of four quar
ters."
Taylor told reporters that he didn't
say anything out of the ordinary
during the halftime intermission.
TEAM SETTLES DOWN
Whatever it was that it took to
get the Big Red machine to settle
down happened, and the kids from
the Farm displayed a different brand
of football in the second half from
that shown during the first 30 min
utes.
Stanford kicked off and contained
the Bruins in their first series of
downs. After an exchange of punts,
Stanford started its first scoring
drive on their 34. After racking up
four first downs, which featured
Brodie's passes and McMillin's hard
running, reliable Bill Tarr caught
the defense flatfooted and raced the
final 7 yards over his own left tackle.
When Raftery came in to make the
conversion, things, looked considera
bly brighter.
The next time Stanford got the
ball they scored again, and fans in
the stands were wild with excite
ment. The drive started in Uclan
territory on the 37 and required only
four plays to be executed.
McMILLIN TALLIES
Alter Tarr got 1 yard at left tackle,
Brodie passed for 19 to Beatie on
the 17. On the next play McMillin,
who sparkled all day, ripped through
the Bruin secondary after sweeping
around his right end for the final 17
yards. John Stanton, Indian tackle,
contributed the key block for the
wiry halfback on his scoring jaunt.
After Tarr's placement went wide
in the second conversion attempt, it
was an uphill road toward victory
for the Indians, but they never gave
up. When the gun sounded the end
of the game, Stanford was knocking
at the door with the ball on the
Bruin 3-yard line.

Brown's pass to left end John Smith,
who took the ball on the Indian 34
and ran unmolested the rest of the
way. The burly tailback, who does
everything except handle the public
address system, converted after both
touchdowns to raise the score to
14-0.
LAST TOUCHDOWN
The last Bruin score of the quar
ter—and the game—came four min
utes later when Doug Bradley, sub
stitute tailback, passed and ran his
team 45 yards in nine plays for the
tally. The scoring play was an 18-
yard pass play to sub quarterback
Bruce Ballard. Brown replaced
Bradley and made the conversion
which turned out to be all-impor
tant.
The situation looked bad by now,
but the "never say die" Indians were
fighting for their lives, and soon fans
noticed that plays which had been
big gainers in the first quarter were
now being reduced to short gains.
McDougall, Bruin substitute, was
forced to kick on fourth down—the
first Bruin punt of the day—after an
alert Card defense had stiffened to
hold Jim Decker in the center of
the line.
A rejuvenated %tan 112 or d team
sprang Tarr for 11 yards at right

end, and then John Brodie, who
came in to replace Jerry Gustaf:on,
cranked up his throwing arm and
hit Jerry Angove for 19 more yards.
This put the ball on UCLA's 43-yard
line and marked the first time that
Taylor's charges had penetrated into
enemy territory.
The drive ended at this point,
however, as th-e defense stiffened
and Raftery was forced to kick.
After an exchange if kicks, Stan
ford took over again, and this time
the home forces were able to drive
to Ihe Bruin 31.
Brodie, who enjoyed one of his
greatest days, pitched for two first
downs und ran for another, in addi
tion to hitting Ernie Dorn, Card
halfback, and McMillin for short
gains.
Try as the Stanfords would, how
ever, Red Sanders' big, tough line
rose to the challenge, and Brodie's
drive bogged down on the Uclan 39.
UCLA fashioned a return drive of
their own, at this point, and the half
ended with the ball deep in Card
territory.
Although Stanford had come to
life during the second quarter of the
game, few people were ready for
what happened in the third and
fourth quarters. When asked what
made the difference between the
team's play in the first and second
halves, end Gary Van Galder stated
that it, was only "a few mental lapses
in the first quarter that beat us. We
beat them in three out of four quar
ters."
Taylor told reporters that he didn't
say anything out of the ordinary
during the halftime intermission.
TEAM SETTLES DOWN
Whatever it was that it took to
get the Big Red machine to settle
down happened, and the kids from
the Farm displayed a different brand
of football in the second half from
that shown during the first 30 min
utes.
Stanford kicked off and contained
the Bruins in their first series of
downs. After an exchange of punts,
Stanford started its first scoring
drive on their 34. After racking up
four first downs, which featured
Brodie's passes and McMillin's hard
running, reliable Bill Tarr caught
the defense flatfooted and raced the
final 7 yards over his own left tackle.
When Raftery came in to make the
conversion, things, looked considera
bly brighter.
The next time Stanford got the
ball they scored again, and fans in
the stands were wild with excite
ment. The drive started in Uclan
territory on the 37 and required only
four plays to be executed.
McMILLIN TALLIES
Alter Tarr got 1 yard at left tackle,
Brodie passed for 19 to Beatie on
the 17. On the next play McMillin,
who sparkled all day, ripped through
the Bruin secondary after sweeping
around his right end for the final 17
yards. John Stanton, Indian tackle,
contributed the key block for the
wiry halfback on his scoring jaunt.
After Tarr's placement went wide
in the second conversion attempt, it
was an uphill road toward victory
for the Indians, but they never gave
up. When the gun sounded the end
of the game, Stanford was knocking
at the door with the ball on the
Bruin 3-yard line.

EARLY SCORES
UCLA didn't keep their \
offense under wraps for lony
barely worked up a jiood
running up three quick touch
almo.it at will through a confused
Card defense. On the first Bruin
play from scrimmage, Sam Brown,
brilliant Uclan tailback, gave warn
ing of what was to come by gallop
ing 2(J yards.
Brown's run put. the ball on Stan
ford's 40-yard line, and after six
plays UCLA had a fourth-and-four
situation on Stanford's 24. If the
Indians had held at this point, and
taken over the ball on downs, there
is no telling what might have hap
pened the rest of the afternoon.
But, as it was, Brown cracked
through the canter of the line for 21
yards and a first down on Stanford's
three.
From here it was child's play for
Ail-American Bob Davenport, Bruin
fullback, to plunge across over his
own left tackle position.
This was only the beginning as
the visitors applied unrelenting pres
! sure and battered the defense into
{ temporary submission. After Tarr

Indians worked the ball up to their
own 37, UCLA took over after Gus
tafson's punt on their own 42-yard

The 58 yards to Stanford's goal
were traversed in just four plays,

enemy territory.
The drive ended at this point,
however, as th-e defense stiffened
and Raftery was forced to kick.
After an exchange if kicks, Stan
ford took over again, and this time
the home forces were able to drive
to Ihe Bruin 31.
Brodie, who enjoyed one of his
greatest days, pitched for two first
downs und ran for another, in addi
tion to hitting Ernie Dorn, Card
halfback, and McMillin for short
gains.
Try as the Stanfords would, how
ever, Red Sanders' big, tough line
rose to the challenge, and Brodie's
drive bogged down on the Uclan 39.
UCLA fashioned a return drive of
their own, at this point, and the half
ended with the ball deep in Card
territory.
Although Stanford had come to
life during the second quarter of the
game, few people were ready for
what happened in the third and
fourth quarters. When asked what
made the difference between the
team's play in the first and second
halves, end Gary Van Galder stated
that it, was only "a few mental lapses
in the first quarter that beat us. We
beat them in three out of four quar
ters."
Taylor told reporters that he didn't
say anything out of the ordinary
during the halftime intermission.
TEAM SETTLES DOWN
Whatever it was that it took to
get the Big Red machine to settle
down happened, and the kids from
the Farm displayed a different brand
of football in the second half from
that shown during the first 30 min
utes.
Stanford kicked off and contained
the Bruins in their first series of
downs. After an exchange of punts,
Stanford started its first scoring
drive on their 34. After racking up
four first downs, which featured
Brodie's passes and McMillin's hard
running, reliable Bill Tarr caught
the defense flatfooted and raced the
final 7 yards over his own left tackle.
When Raftery came in to make the
conversion, things, looked considera
bly brighter.
The next time Stanford got the
ball they scored again, and fans in
the stands were wild with excite
ment. The drive started in Uclan
territory on the 37 and required only
four plays to be executed.
McMILLIN TALLIES
Alter Tarr got 1 yard at left tackle,
Brodie passed for 19 to Beatie on
the 17. On the next play McMillin,
who sparkled all day, ripped through
the Bruin secondary after sweeping
around his right end for the final 17
yards. John Stanton, Indian tackle,
contributed the key block for the
wiry halfback on his scoring jaunt.
After Tarr's placement went wide
in the second conversion attempt, it
was an uphill road toward victory
for the Indians, but they never gave
up. When the gun sounded the end
of the game, Stanford was knocking
at the door with the ball on the
Bruin 3-yard line.

EARLY SCORES
UCLA didn't keep their \
offense under wraps for lony
barely worked up a jiood
running up three quick touch
almo.it at will through a confused
Card defense. On the first Bruin
play from scrimmage, Sam Brown,
brilliant Uclan tailback, gave warn
ing of what was to come by gallop
ing 2(J yards.
Brown's run put. the ball on Stan
ford's 40-yard line, and after six
plays UCLA had a fourth-and-four
situation on Stanford's 24. If the
Indians had held at this point, and
taken over the ball on downs, there
is no telling what might have hap
pened the rest of the afternoon.
But, as it was, Brown cracked
through the canter of the line for 21
yards and a first down on Stanford's
three.
From here it was child's play for
Ail-American Bob Davenport, Bruin
fullback, to plunge across over his
own left tackle position.
This was only the beginning as
the visitors applied unrelenting pres
! sure and battered the defense into
{ temporary submission. After Tarr
| received Brown's kickoff, and the
Indians worked the ball up to their
own 37, UCLA took over after Gus
tafson's punt on their own 42-yard
j line.
The 58 yards to Stanford's goal
were traversed in just four plays,
including a 15-yard Bruin penalty
for holding.
The big gainer in the drive was
Brown's pass to left end John Smith,
who took the ball on the Indian 34
and ran unmolested the rest of the
way. The burly tailback, who does
everything except handle the public
address system, converted after both
touchdowns to raise the score to
14-0.
LAST TOUCHDOWN
The last Bruin score of the quar
ter—and the game—came four min
utes later when Doug Bradley, sub
stitute tailback, passed and ran his
team 45 yards in nine plays for the
tally. The scoring play was an 18-
yard pass play to sub quarterback
Bruce Ballard. Brown replaced
Bradley and made the conversion
which turned out to be all-impor
tant.
The situation looked bad by now,
but the "never say die" Indians were
fighting for their lives, and soon fans
noticed that plays which had been
big gainers in the first quarter were
now being reduced to short gains.
McDougall, Bruin substitute, was
forced to kick on fourth down—the
first Bruin punt of the day—after an
alert Card defense had stiffened to
hold Jim Decker in the center of
the line.
A rejuvenated %tan 112 or d team
sprang Tarr for 11 yards at right

end, and then John Brodie, who
came in to replace Jerry Gustaf:on,
cranked up his throwing arm and
hit Jerry Angove for 19 more yards.
This put the ball on UCLA's 43-yard
line and marked the first time that
Taylor's charges had penetrated into
enemy territory.
