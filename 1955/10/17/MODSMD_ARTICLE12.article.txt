# we'll blow our horn
## 
### 
Oh, these are dark, trying days lor UCLA's
fhumbled Rally Committee —dark days
indeed. Their big brothers, the Bruin football
loam, came and conquered and went home
dutch-rig their slightly haltered rosebud. But
Rally Com came and took gas and went home
without its precious air horn.
Doesn't that just break your heart?
Up in the rooting section we almost cried.
Particularly when UCLA's Rally Com chairman
told us we weren't nice guys. He told us that
this air horn was a tradition in Bruinville, that
it went to all the games. He threatened to tell
Coach Red and the team. He threatened to
send the UCLA rooters storming across the
field to retrieve their purloined noise-maker.
1! was touching.
Ye r .:, i.i a flash of traditional Stanford bril
liance and in a moment of stupendous Uclan
e.ui.'lessness, the air horn changed hands.

Hail and drinks on the house to Tom Gregg.
May the spirit of the Immortal 21 never die.
And hail to the glorious band vyhich carried
the horn to its Stanford sanctuary when UCLA
failed to keep its end of the bargain, its gentle
men's agreement to exchange the baton and
the megaphone for the horn.
As far as UCLA is concerned, the horn has
dropped out of sight. At the moment, we hear,
Alpha Sigma Phi retains possession. Soon,
we trust, it will be ceremoniously presented to
Rally Com. For this is now a Stanford air horn;
it belongs to all of us—in spirit if not in fact.
The air horn is not quite the Axe, but we
suggest that it would make a suitable perpetual
trophy. We'll carry it into the Coliseum under
armed guard next year, and if UCLA can beat
us, they can have the thing back—for a year.
But until the time comes that UCLA beats
us, we say, "Tough one to lose, Bruins."
