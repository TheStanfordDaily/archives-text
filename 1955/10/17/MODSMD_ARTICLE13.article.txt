The Astronomy Club is holding an organi
zational meeting tonight in Room 320 at 8:30.
A talk will be followed by "telescope observ

and Wilbur, not to mention the Row . . .
Tuesday Nighters will be interested to know
that PubExCom has engaged James Day, man
ager of area educational TV station KQED, to
talk on "The Future of Educational Television."
Hully gee, but look what the Air Force is
doin' for us kids. Today and tomorrow they're
gonna have a real F-86 Sabre jet fighter parked
out in front of the Pavilion. And what's more,
there'll be a display of real photygraphs there
too, called "The Mission of YOUR U.S. Air
Force." Geewhillikers Mumsy, can I wear my
Wheat Chex space helmet with the oxygen
tubes printed right on the side when I go?

Wednesday afternoon at 4:15, the Depart
ment of Speech and Drama is presenting "Love
and How to Cure It," a one-act play by Chris
topher Fry, in the Little Theater. In general
the quality of stuff presented in the Little Thea
ter on a midweek afternoon is apt to be a little
uneven, but this may well be pretty good. Be
sides it's free . . .
Those of us who managed to unload our old,
discontinued textbooks through the A Phi O
Book Exchange earlier in the quarter will be
happy to know that the treasurer of the same
organization is ready to divvy the take. Bring
your satchel to Room 106 in the Libe today
and tomorrow.
Wednesday night at 7, the Cardinals are
showing the UCLA-Stanford football flicks in

Cubberley Auditorium. This program will be
followed by the Candlelight service of medi
tation and prayer at 9:30 in Memorial Church.
Thursday morning could be an exciting one
for you, if you like to gawp at Famous Figures.
It seems that Prince Albert of Belgium is sched
uled to visit Hoover Tower and Library then,
as a part of an informal flying tour of this coun
try. . . . And if you're the Dean of the Taxi
dermy School, you may even get to meet the
guy.
Friday night at 8:15 in Memorial Church, a
man name of William Teague from Shreveport,
Louisiana, is giving an organ recital. If you've
ever wondered what a Louisiana organ player
sounds like, now's your chance.
Shut the windows, they're comin' through
the doors! — the cry will ring out Saturday
morning, as high school journalists from all
over Central California are due to swarm on
Quad for a conference sponsored by the Insti
tute for Journalistic Studies. Personally, we
plan to sleep in . . .

Flicks Note: The ASSU Flicks Manager, ap
parently and blessedly cursed with a weak
stomach, has double-shuffled the lineup for
Sunday night, sending in "Titanic" for Day. A
clear case of any port in a storm (yuk).
Thouqht for the Week (Guide to Our Feath
ered Friends Dept.): According to the United
Press, the domestic turkey in the United States
is a descendant of the Mexican turkey which
was taken to Europe by the Spanish in the 16th
century. From Spain the turkey went to Eng
land and then to the United States. And so
to class . . .
