action needed
To the Editor:
If is apparent that there is a general lack of knowl
edge of both the campus foreign student program
and the average student's participation in it.
In addition to the ASSU scholars, approximately
2fW foreign students from all over the world are
here at Stanford. Many of them are here with the
express purpose of meeting Americans. As they are
guests, the American students must generally take
the initiative. Opportunities arise to do this every
where: at the Cellar, in classes, in the fraternities
and living groups where some of them live, and
through the International Club and the Host Depart
ment activities. These foreign students always extend
an open invitation to Americans to join them at their
Ft iday afternoon coffee hours, from 4 to 6 at Bow
man, at the Friday evening parties, and on their
spceial tours. It is a shame that the student body
has been so apathetic.
Ther" has been some consideration of after-dinner
coffee hours at living groups, informal talks on all
ubjects, and other means of getting together.. One
of our program's objectives is a real and mutual ex
change of ideas and interests. Here the Americans
must obviously make the first move, but they will
n.cet with interest and co-operation. We urge you
who are interested to realize some of these goals. The
li.r i Department at the III? is ready with information
and naim ; . . . all that is needed now is action.

two seats . . . anywhere
To the Editor:
Many students and interested alumni find it hard
to believe that Stanford is so financially embarrassed
that it can send neither its yell leaders nor Prince
I.!i/htfoot to the football games away from home. It
i. nice lhat Mrs. Masters is able to go along with the
team, but aren't the yell leaders and Lightfoot the
student representatives of Stanford and thus the
logical people to take along to root for the team?

If Ohio State can send its head yell leader to Stan
ford and Washington State can send its pom-pom
girls to Cal—why doesn't Stanford try to find room
for at least one of its yell leaders on the team's plane?
Many of the alumni and fans in other states would
appreciate seeing one of these student body repre
sentatives at the games.
Even San Francisco sports writers remarked on
Stanford's inability to find one seat on the plane to
Michigan for Piince Lightfoot. Art Rosenbaum of
the San Francisco Chronicle states in his Oct. 10 col
umn that "friends of Prince Lightfoot say 'ugh' to
Stanford's losing football team. They complain Ath
letic Director A 1 Masters —no Indian, he—does not
appreciate the noble heart that beats under Prince
Lightfoot's breast nor the winged victory that is at
tached to his nimble feet."
Many people would like to see Lightfoot and Jim
Walters on that plane to Washington. Let's hope two
seats will be arranged somehow.

not only stassen
To the Editor:
It sounded very much as if your editorial of Oct. 13
was a campaign speech written for Stassen. Now I j
know, or at least hope, that this isn't so. You ;ilso ;
mentioned that only Warren, besides Eisenhower, has
the power to win for the Republicans in 1956. It just
so happens that as of now Nixon is preferred by more
Republicans including Ike himself.
Now I'll grant you Nixon is far from the nomina
tion and has plenty of opposition in and out of his
party. However, Stassen isn't the only man the GOP
can successfully run. I believe that if the voting
public considers the betterment of the nation and
international situations under Ike and his cabinet
(as compared to the previous administration), the
Democratic effort at victory will be useless.
