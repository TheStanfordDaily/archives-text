# 'Plain and Fancy' Proves Enjoyable
## Excursion Into Amish Community Provides Unique Entertainment 
### CHUCK CHESNUT 
Fresh vitality and spontaneous fun of the "plain" in the West
Coast version of Broadway's "Plain and Fancy"—now at San
Francisco's Curran Theater—make the musical enjoyable and
unique entertainment.
Taking an unusual subject for musical treatment, the writers

have fashioned a plot that traces"
two New Yorkers' temporary inva
sion into the Amish (pronounced
AHmish) community of Bird - in -
Hand, Pa.
Before their departure, the so
phisticated city folks — adequately
played by Hollywood's Alexis Smith
and Craig Stevens—have been in
volved in a memorable series of
comic episodes revealing the .sim
plicity and complete contentment of
the Yoders, Zooks, Stolzfusses, Pi
lersheims, and other Amish families.
MUSIC IS NATURAL
"Plain and Fancy" is unique
among musicals because it has a
mors engaging book than music.
Though most of the musical num
bers are uncontrived and emerge
quite naturally—an unusual attri
bute in musical comedy—even effec
tive choral arrangements only some
times compensate for the undistin
guished melodies — melodies which
too often fail to capture the true
gaiety of the Pennsylvania Dutch.
The numbers range from the well
heeled "Young and Foolish" and the
catchy "City Mouse, Country Mouse"
to complete trash which falls to
Miss Smith.
An unfortunate feature is that the
musical's high spots come in the
middle of the show, leaving the final
portions running down hill. A sec
ond-act excursion to a forbidden
carnival in the "outside world" (a
confusingly staged scene) disinte
grates th# last quarter of the show
into mediocrity.
LEAVES BAD TASTE
It is followed by a hasty tying up
of the loose ends so that all will end
well. As it stands, it leaves a bad
taste.
The show finally picks up after a
slow beginning, only to sag when
Miss Smith and Stevens—in a situa
tion uncomfortably close to Eve
Arden and "Our Miss Brooks"—re
ceive too much attention and their
jokes are sapped a little too long.
The show is at its unpretentious
best when the Amish way of life is
the center of attraction. The real,
warm comedy comes from their Un
usual customs and their odd twist
ings of the English language in such
expressions as "In the stove the fire
needs fixing" and "When we were
once children yet."
DRAN SIETZ STARS
The excellent vc.ce and comedy
talents of attractive Dran Sietz make
her the show's highlight. Her brash
frankness and bewilderment at the
city folks' ways were captivating.
A refreshingly choreographed "By

Lantern Light" number, a scene in
an antiquated kitchen, and a stirring
and dramatic finale to Act I are the
best scenes of the evening.
Fortunately deft acting, excellent
choreography, bright costumes, in
geniously designed set.-, and the di
rect simplicity of the Amish them
selves outweigh the drawbacks of
the often laborious pacing, the un
distinguished music and the disap
pointing resolution of the plot.
Still, the show has its excellent
moments and is most pleasant en
tertainment. As the Amish would
have put it,"The plain to be fancy
tried not." This is its success.

best scenes of the evening.
Fortunately deft acting, excellent
choreography, bright costumes, in
geniously designed set.-, and the di
rect simplicity of the Amish them
selves outweigh the drawbacks of
the often laborious pacing, the un
distinguished music and the disap
pointing resolution of the plot.
Still, the show has its excellent
moments and is most pleasant en
tertainment. As the Amish would
have put it,"The plain to be fancy
tried not." This is its success.
Fresh vitality and spontaneous fun of the "plain" in the West
Coast version of Broadway's "Plain and Fancy"—now at San
Francisco's Curran Theater—make the musical enjoyable and
unique entertainment.
Taking an unusual subject for musical treatment, the writers

have fashioned a plot that traces"
two New Yorkers' temporary inva
sion into the Amish (pronounced
AHmish) community of Bird - in -
Hand, Pa.
Before their departure, the so
phisticated city folks — adequately
played by Hollywood's Alexis Smith
and Craig Stevens—have been in
volved in a memorable series of
comic episodes revealing the .sim
plicity and complete contentment of
the Yoders, Zooks, Stolzfusses, Pi
lersheims, and other Amish families.
MUSIC IS NATURAL
"Plain and Fancy" is unique
among musicals because it has a
mors engaging book than music.
Though most of the musical num
bers are uncontrived and emerge
quite naturally—an unusual attri
bute in musical comedy—even effec
tive choral arrangements only some
times compensate for the undistin
guished melodies — melodies which
too often fail to capture the true
gaiety of the Pennsylvania Dutch.
The numbers range from the well
heeled "Young and Foolish" and the
catchy "City Mouse, Country Mouse"
to complete trash which falls to
Miss Smith.
An unfortunate feature is that the
musical's high spots come in the
middle of the show, leaving the final
portions running down hill. A sec
ond-act excursion to a forbidden
carnival in the "outside world" (a
confusingly staged scene) disinte
grates th# last quarter of the show
into mediocrity.
LEAVES BAD TASTE
It is followed by a hasty tying up
of the loose ends so that all will end
well. As it stands, it leaves a bad
taste.
The show finally picks up after a
slow beginning, only to sag when
Miss Smith and Stevens—in a situa
tion uncomfortably close to Eve
Arden and "Our Miss Brooks"—re
ceive too much attention and their
jokes are sapped a little too long.
The show is at its unpretentious
best when the Amish way of life is
the center of attraction. The real,
warm comedy comes from their Un
usual customs and their odd twist
ings of the English language in such
expressions as "In the stove the fire
needs fixing" and "When we were
once children yet."
DRAN SIETZ STARS
The excellent vc.ce and comedy
talents of attractive Dran Sietz make
her the show's highlight. Her brash
frankness and bewilderment at the
city folks' ways were captivating.
A refreshingly choreographed "By

Lantern Light" number, a scene in
an antiquated kitchen, and a stirring
and dramatic finale to Act I are the
best scenes of the evening.
