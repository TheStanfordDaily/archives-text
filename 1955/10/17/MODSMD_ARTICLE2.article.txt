# Bruin Air Horn Is Safe—We Got It!
## Stanford Keeps Stolen Air Horn When UCLA Fails to Keep Bargain 
### HELEN DEWAR 
UCLA'S brassy mascot, a 20-pound air horn, is safely nestled
"somewhere in the hills behind Stanford" and will remain there
indefinitely.
It has been smuggled there under custody of the Alpha Sigma
Phi house, according to Rally Committee and stunts chairman Bill

Lackey, who presided over the
bleating and tooting during the
game.
The horn, a tradition at all UCLA
games since 1947, was taken during
pre-game activities last Saturday by
senior Tom Gregg, who hastily ran
ofT with the momentarily neglected
horn.
The horn had been brought to the
southeast entrance of the stadium tc
greet the incoming UCLA team.
Tt already was bleating loudly
from the Stanford men's rooting
section by the time UCLA's Rally
Committee chairman had crossed the
field to talk with Stanford head yell
leader, Jim Walters.
BATON STOLEN
During this tete-a-tete a large red
and white megaphone and drum
major George Sheldon's baton were
snatched and taken back to the
UCLA side.
Then, according to Walters, he
and UCLA's Rally chairman agreed
that both side£ would return their
respective loot following the game.
Asking co-operation of the rooting
section. Walters pledged himself per
sonally responsible to return the
horn.
Trouble subsided until the end ol
the game when UCLA rooters flood
ed to the Stanford side to get their
horn, but failed to bring with them
the megaphone or the baton.
The horn began to sound, the
crowd grew larger, louder and more
impatient, and finally the horn was
escorted out and taken to its .secre
tive hiding place.
"We made an agreement and car
ried out our part," Walters said,
"but they never carried out theirs.'
"NOT CLEAR"
Walters heard that the rally chair
man did not make clear to the root
ing section the agreement he had
made, and that the megaphone wa:-
torn and the baton bent before the
end of the game.

♦
Walters waited to give the UCLA
crowd a chance to bring the mega
phone* and baton back, but finally,
according to Walters, "the crowd
; grew into a mob and made ofT with
the horn."
Estimating that the horn costs
about $40, Walters would not be sur
prised to see UCLA send Stanford
a bill for the horn—to which Stan
ford would reply, Walters said, by
sending them a bill for the mega
phone and the baton — amounting
i aho to $40.
"It's a matter of principle, not fi
nancial equality," Walters explained.
"We did our part; they didn't."
UCLA BLAMED
Casting considerable blame on the
UCLA rally chairman, Walters
! thinks the Stanford crowd would
have given the trophy back had it
| not been for the comments made by
tliL- rally chairman in an attempt to
; shame the rooting section out of
| keeping the horn during the game.
Horn-snatcher Tom Gregg yester
day said that he had been tracking
down the famous horn since 10 a.m.
! the morning of the game.
"I got to know the guys who were
i with the horn," he said, "and when
I saw them set it on the ground, I
! grabbed it and ran."
The air horn, having great possi
i bililies of becoming another Indian
football trophy, consists of two
trumpets based on a large tank con
taining 400 pounds' air pressure. By
action of a trigger, pressure is re
leased through the horns to pierce
through the air at touchdown time.

tliL- rally chairman in an attempt to
; shame the rooting section out of
| keeping the horn during the game.
Horn-snatcher Tom Gregg yester
day said that he had been tracking
down the famous horn since 10 a.m.
! the morning of the game.
"I got to know the guys who were
i with the horn," he said, "and when
I saw them set it on the ground, I
! grabbed it and ran."
The air horn, having great possi
i bililies of becoming another Indian
football trophy, consists of two
trumpets based on a large tank con
taining 400 pounds' air pressure. By
action of a trigger, pressure is re
leased through the horns to pierce
through the air at touchdown time.

UCLA'S brassy mascot, a 20-pound air horn, is safely nestled
"somewhere in the hills behind Stanford" and will remain there
indefinitely.
It has been smuggled there under custody of the Alpha Sigma
Phi house, according to Rally Committee and stunts chairman Bill

Lackey, who presided over the
bleating and tooting during the
game.
The horn, a tradition at all UCLA
games since 1947, was taken during
pre-game activities last Saturday by
senior Tom Gregg, who hastily ran
ofT with the momentarily neglected
horn.
The horn had been brought to the
southeast entrance of the stadium tc
greet the incoming UCLA team.
Tt already was bleating loudly
from the Stanford men's rooting
section by the time UCLA's Rally
Committee chairman had crossed the
field to talk with Stanford head yell
leader, Jim Walters.
BATON STOLEN
During this tete-a-tete a large red
and white megaphone and drum
major George Sheldon's baton were
snatched and taken back to the
UCLA side.
Then, according to Walters, he
and UCLA's Rally chairman agreed
that both side£ would return their
respective loot following the game.
Asking co-operation of the rooting
section. Walters pledged himself per
sonally responsible to return the
horn.
Trouble subsided until the end ol
the game when UCLA rooters flood
ed to the Stanford side to get their
horn, but failed to bring with them
the megaphone or the baton.
The horn began to sound, the
crowd grew larger, louder and more
impatient, and finally the horn was
escorted out and taken to its .secre
tive hiding place.
"We made an agreement and car
ried out our part," Walters said,
"but they never carried out theirs.'
"NOT CLEAR"
Walters heard that the rally chair
man did not make clear to the root
ing section the agreement he had
made, and that the megaphone wa:-
torn and the baton bent before the
end of the game.

♦
Walters waited to give the UCLA
crowd a chance to bring the mega
phone* and baton back, but finally,
according to Walters, "the crowd
; grew into a mob and made ofT with
the horn."
Estimating that the horn costs
about $40, Walters would not be sur
prised to see UCLA send Stanford
a bill for the horn—to which Stan
ford would reply, Walters said, by
sending them a bill for the mega
phone and the baton — amounting
i aho to $40.
"It's a matter of principle, not fi
nancial equality," Walters explained.
"We did our part; they didn't."
UCLA BLAMED

UCLA rally chairman, Walters

have given the trophy back had it
