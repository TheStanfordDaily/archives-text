# Coach Red Sanders Sits Through Long Afternoon
## 
### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
"This was one of the longest after
noons I've experienced in a long
while."
So said Henry ' - Red" Sanders after
his Bruins sweated out the last three
quarters of Saturday's game against
a determined Stanford comeback.
Sitting in the dressing room and
sipping a Coke, Sanders went on to
compare the game with the Stan
ford-UCLA game of two years ago,
which the Indians won, 21-20. The
UCLA mentor said that the Bruins
caught Brodie at his greatest Satur
day, just as they came up against
Bobby Garrett in his peak perform
ance of the 1953 season.
Sanders complimented the Stan
ford pass receivers for making some
great catches, but he thought that
the UCLA pass defense was not as
good as it should have been. He also
thought that the Bruins' defensive
line charge was not up to par.
PENALTIES HURT
In Sanders' opinion, the two fac
tors which really hurt UCLA in the
second half were a series of penal
ties which crippled several Bruin
<1 rives and the loss of center Steve
Palmer due to a leg injury. Accord
ing to Sanders, Palmer is the man
the Bruins can least afford to lose.
The Bruin coach compared him fa

vorably with Donn Moomaw, the
great UCLA center of several years
ago.
Of the Bruins, Sanders singled out
tailback Sam "First Down" Brown,
tackle Gil Moreno and fullback Bob
Davenport for special praise:
"Brown established himself today
as an authoritative passer. I never
saw him run any better. He's not
the same player he was last year.
"Although I haven't seen the pic
tures, I think Moreno played his
best game."
"Davenport played well. The other
teams have managed to defend him
pretty well, but he is a great blocker
on our option plays. I think he has
put more ends on the ground than
any fullback who ever played the
game."

When asked about the Knoxes—
Harvey and Ronnie — Sanders re
plied "I never see him | Harvey 1,
and I just judge the players as I see
them. Our players like Knox | Ron
nie | as well as any player we've ever
had. He's a quiet boy and tough.
We would never have beaten Texas
A&M without him."
The only complaint that Sanders
had with his signal callers was that
they did not try enough wide re
verses with wingback Jim Decker
carrying around the weak side.

tures, I think Moreno played his
best game."
"Davenport played well. The other
teams have managed to defend him
pretty well, but he is a great blocker
on our option plays. I think he has
put more ends on the ground than
any fullback who ever played the
game."
RONNIE WELL LIKED
When asked about the Knoxes—
Harvey and Ronnie — Sanders re
plied "I never see him | Harvey 1,
and I just judge the players as I see
them. Our players like Knox | Ron
nie | as well as any player we've ever
had. He's a quiet boy and tough.
We would never have beaten Texas
A&M without him."
The only complaint that Sanders
had with his signal callers was that
they did not try enough wide re
verses with wingback Jim Decker
carrying around the weak side.
"This was one of the longest after
noons I've experienced in a long
while."
So said Henry ' - Red" Sanders after
his Bruins sweated out the last three
quarters of Saturday's game against
a determined Stanford comeback.
Sitting in the dressing room and
sipping a Coke, Sanders went on to
compare the game with the Stan
ford-UCLA game of two years ago,
which the Indians won, 21-20. The
UCLA mentor said that the Bruins
caught Brodie at his greatest Satur
day, just as they came up against
Bobby Garrett in his peak perform
ance of the 1953 season.
Sanders complimented the Stan
ford pass receivers for making some
great catches, but he thought that
the UCLA pass defense was not as
good as it should have been. He also
thought that the Bruins' defensive
line charge was not up to par.
PENALTIES HURT
In Sanders' opinion, the two fac
tors which really hurt UCLA in the
second half were a series of penal
ties which crippled several Bruin
<1 rives and the loss of center Steve
Palmer due to a leg injury. Accord
ing to Sanders, Palmer is the man
the Bruins can least afford to lose.
The Bruin coach compared him fa

vorably with Donn Moomaw, the
great UCLA center of several years
ago.
Of the Bruins, Sanders singled out
tailback Sam "First Down" Brown,
tackle Gil Moreno and fullback Bob
Davenport for special praise:
"Brown established himself today
as an authoritative passer. I never
saw him run any better. He's not
the same player he was last year.
"Although I haven't seen the pic
tures, I think Moreno played his
best game."
"Davenport played well. The other
teams have managed to defend him
pretty well, but he is a great blocker
on our option plays. I think he has
