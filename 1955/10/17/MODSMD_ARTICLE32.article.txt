# 'Gaieties' Ticket Application Blanks Are Now Available
## 
### 
Application blanks for Ram's
Head "Big Game Gaieties" tick
ets are available now at the Me
morial Hall box office and at the
ASSU office in the Nitery.
For the first time this year, tickets
will be sold mainly on a mail-order
basis, Ram's Head manager Don
Yates announced.
Application blanks for individual
tickets will be distributed to presi
dents and social chairmen of all
living groups.
Order blanks for block tickets
have already been received by living
group officers. All block seats avail
able for Friday night's performance
have been sold out, but blocks are
still available for Tuesday and Wed
nesday nights. A discount will be
offered Stanford living groups on
these nights.
As orders will be filled in the
order*of their postmark, Yates urges
students to mail their applications
rather than bringing them to the
Ram's Head office. Any individual
tickets that are left will go on sale
Nov. 7.
Ten thousand ticket applications
have already been mailed by the
University to recipients of tickets
lor the UCLA- Stanford football
game, and 750 blanks have been
sent to persons on the Stanford
Players mailing list.
''We feel, however," said Yates,
"that our first responsibility is to
the student body. The mail-order
system will enable them to get a
fair chance at the tickets and to do
so with a minimum of inconven
ience."
