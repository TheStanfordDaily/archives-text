# We Came Close But Not Close Enough; Taylor Pleased by Strong Second Half
## The
						Scoreboard Said 'No,' But Stanford Won 
### JACK BYRNE 
Stanford's game — except on
the scoreboard.
But for the Stanford rooter, it
was a more than successful af
| ternoon.
It embodied all that football should
—a last-chance comeback; the theft
of a valued air horn (and the loud
and vain pleas for its return); the
omnipresent orange salesmen with
voices like nothing known: and the
omnipresent blinding autumn sun.
The joy of the rooter at such a
brilliant afternqon (and such a bril
liant coup as making off with an op
position air horn) was marred only
by the sad reality of a dismal first
quarter. Stanford, in that first 15
minutes, seemed to be making good
the writers' dire predictions of being
j 20-point underdogs.
In that first dismal quarter it
seemed as though the rooting section
had lost any hope of any game ever
developing. The entreaties of the
yell leader seemed almost a lone
voice in the wilderness. Fighting
yells were replaced with biting sar
casm.
But the second quarter saw the
mighty Bruin fail to punch a fourth
TD across the defenses of deter
mined Indians, and a new hope—
never voiced—was evident in the
great slope of humanity that covered
one side of the earthen bowl.
GREAT RALLY
A protracted third quarter saw
the start of a great rally, and the
enthusiasm of the rooting section
reached a new pitch as the team
became — without any prelude — a
mass of heroes.
No two groups had the same hero.
I In their individuality, groups singled
I out "one of the bros," or "the guy
j that hashes with me," as the object
j of his personal bellows.
And so through the last agonizing
minutes of the touchdown that
showed everywhere except on the
scoreboard. And when it was all
over, 110 one seemed to regard Stan
ford as losing. After the first dismal
quarter, Stanford Yooters called it
their game.
NOSTALGIA
And when the last notes of "Hail.
Stanford, Hail!" had strung their
way across the field, while alumni
watched with nostalgia, the great
while tide of the rooting section
•oiirsed from the stands and toward
the ramp.
Up the ramp, behind the band.
Into the sun along Sain McDonald
Road, up toward Encina Gym.
UCLA's air horn, safely in a car.
and m rounded by a horde of Stan
ford roughs. The yells in front of
the gym. the groups splitting off and
Lrodding home.
Stanford stadium left to the or
ange drink salesmen, Rally Com
members, the sinking sun, and a
scoreboard.
And the game Stanford won ex
, cept on that scoreboard.

BEATIE MAKES GRAB—Jerry Beatie, Stanford end, snares one of the 17 passes which Card
quarterback John Brodie completed against UCLA Saturday. Beatie was the receiver on three
of these occasions. Bruin halfback Chuck Hollo way (31), replacement for Jim Decker who was
removed from the game after an unnecessary roughness penalty, hits Beatie in an effort to dis
lodge the ball from his grasp.
