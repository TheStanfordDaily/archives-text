WE PREDICT: 1958's most infuriating magazine article will be
"THE NATURAL SUPERIORITY
OF IVY LEAGUE MEN"
in November HOLIDAY magazine
I. . and that its noted author, Henry Morton Robinson (Columbia '23) will be man most
burned in effigy on non-Ivy campuses this fall! It's guaranteed to enrage the letter men
of "Moline Subnormal" and "Turpentine Tech" ... redden the faces of state universities'
"professorlings" (that's what Robinson calls 'em) ... wound the tender feelings of every
drum majorette in America.
You'll smoulder at Robinson's gibes at courses in chain-store management and em
balming! Burn at his references to state universities as "educational rabbit warrens."
Explode at his views on mass education for the "denizens of Outer Mediocrity." It's one
ol a trio of provocative articles on Ivy League men, social life, sports. Don't miss it!
