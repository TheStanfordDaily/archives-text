# Parody of Bruin Card Stunt Draws Criticism from Alumni
## 
### DICK MEISTER Associate Editor, The Daily 
The UCLA game has left in its
aftermath a wake of protests over
the Stanford halftime stunt read
ing "U STINK," a take-off on the
Bruins' famous "UCLA" signa
ture stunt.
Protests have come mainly to
the President's office from alumni
who see the stunt as a completely
new idea in Stanford rooting sec
tions—and a poor one, in their
opinions.
Frederic O. Glover, assistant to
the President, had this to say
concerning the protests, and the
reasoning behind them:
"The President's Office has re
ceived complaints from alumni
who consider the 'U STINK' card
stunt in poor taste and a depar
ture from the long tradition of

good sportsmanship that has
marked not only the card stunts
of the Stanford rooting section,
but those of other institutions in
the Coast Conference."
Although the stunt was meant
to "razz" the UCLA rooting sec
tion, and their signature stunt in
particular, this wasn't clear to
some of the onlookers.
As Glover explained, "If the
purpose of the stunt was to criti
cize the UCLA card stunts, this
was not clear to the critics of the
stunt, who felt it was a direct slur
upon a distinguished university
and upon our guests at the game."
At a short meeting yesterday
in the President's office with
Raliy Committee representatives
and members of the President's
staff, the misunderstanding was
clarified.
A Rally Com spokesman ex

plained that the "U STINK" stunt
was a parody on UCLA's signa
ture stunt and was announced as
such before its execution at half
time. The stunt was in pre-game
stunt plannings, and at the time
of its use it was questioned, the
spokesman pointed out.
However, after the poor taste
shown by a UCLA speaker at last
Friday's rally and the poor han
dling of the air horn incident by
Bruin representatives, the major
ity of card stunt committee mem
bers decided to go ahead with
the "U STINK" stunt, according
to the spokesman.
Out of the meeting in the Pres
ident's office came an under
standing of the reasons for the
stunt, what led up to it, and the
recognition that it wouldn't set
a precedent for future Stanford
card stunts.

dling of the air horn incident by
Bruin representatives, the major
ity of card stunt committee mem
bers decided to go ahead with
the "U STINK" stunt, according
to the spokesman.
Out of the meeting in the Pres
ident's office came an under
standing of the reasons for the
stunt, what led up to it, and the
recognition that it wouldn't set
a precedent for future Stanford
card stunts.
The UCLA game has left in its
aftermath a wake of protests over
the Stanford halftime stunt read
ing "U STINK," a take-off on the
Bruins' famous "UCLA" signa
ture stunt.
Protests have come mainly to
the President's office from alumni
who see the stunt as a completely
new idea in Stanford rooting sec
tions—and a poor one, in their
opinions.
Frederic O. Glover, assistant to
the President, had this to say
concerning the protests, and the
reasoning behind them:
"The President's Office has re
ceived complaints from alumni
who consider the 'U STINK' card
stunt in poor taste and a depar
ture from the long tradition of

good sportsmanship that has
marked not only the card stunts
of the Stanford rooting section,
but those of other institutions in
the Coast Conference."
Although the stunt was meant
to "razz" the UCLA rooting sec
tion, and their signature stunt in
particular, this wasn't clear to
some of the onlookers.
As Glover explained, "If the
purpose of the stunt was to criti
cize the UCLA card stunts, this
was not clear to the critics of the
stunt, who felt it was a direct slur
upon a distinguished university
and upon our guests at the game."
At a short meeting yesterday
in the President's office with
Raliy Committee representatives
and members of the President's
staff, the misunderstanding was
clarified.
A Rally Com spokesman ex

plained that the "U STINK" stunt
was a parody on UCLA's signa
ture stunt and was announced as
such before its execution at half
time. The stunt was in pre-game
stunt plannings, and at the time
of its use it was questioned, the
spokesman pointed out.
However, after the poor taste
shown by a UCLA speaker at last
Friday's rally and the poor han
dling of the air horn incident by
Bruin representatives, the major
ity of card stunt committee mem
bers decided to go ahead with
the "U STINK" stunt, according
to the spokesman.
Out of the meeting in the Pres
ident's office came an under
standing of the reasons for the
stunt, what led up to it, and the
recognition that it wouldn't set
a precedent for future Stanford
card stunts.
