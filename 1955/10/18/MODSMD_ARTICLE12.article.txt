# Farm Community Chest Drive Continues; Goal Set at $3,500
## Activities For Raising Funds Are Scheduled 
### 
The goal of this year's Com
munity Chest drive is 53,500—
$1 for every student living on
campus.
Drive Chairman Fred Fortine an
nounced this goal at a special brief
ing session for Drive solicitors yes
terday. Today is the second day of
the week-long campus campaign.
In past years a number of dormi
tories have boosted their records in
the Drive by holding cookie, cake or
sandwich sales or auctions. This year
Roble is tentatively planning a cm
wash, and other dormitories are ex
pected to schedule similar fund-rais
ing activities.
The main work, however, will be
done by solicitors, who will comb
the dormitories, Row houses and
fraternities during the coming week,
each hoping to be the first to rack
up a 100 per cent donation score in
his area.
Before the Drive opened, the Drive
Committee computed the amount ol
money each living unit would have
if every member donated $1. From
day to day during the campaign, the
amount raised by each unit will be
compared with that figure, and the
living units ranked accordingly.
Drive Publicity Manager Bolt
Clemmer has arranged to keep The
Daily posted each day during the
Drive regarding which units have
achieved the highest percentages of
donors.
A special booth at the Cellar will
enable graduate students and off
campus students to contribute also,
since solicitors will visit only Uni
versity residences.
The money raised each year in
the Drive is given to public service
groups on campus and in Palo Alto.
One such organization is the PTA
Wardrobe, a service run by the local
PTA to help children of lower in
come families obtain suitable clothes
for school.
Another is the Family Service Or
ganization, which provides guidance
on problems of individual and fam
ily adjustment and on parent-child
relationships.
Other groups are the Stanford and
Palo Alto YWCA's, the YMCA, Boy
and Girl Scout and Campfire Girl
organizations, and other youth
groups.
