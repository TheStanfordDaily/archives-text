1:: pointing out the reasons lor the revolt in North
Africa Mr. Germain seemed to believe that without
l in' ur-e of the Arab League and the Egyptian Broad
, ii ; i • Station, the few North African rebels would
n< : have been inspired. It is strange how Mr. Ger
-111:,in could build such a structure of reasoning on
neb po.-r foundation. Everybody knows by now that
i... .. volt is a mass uprising and not a minority dis
■ •merit ami that a people would not and could
not light for long unless they did it as a result of
i.iitn in their cause and a genuine belief in their
action.
J would like to cut short this discussion by quoting
a pnsKge from the American Declaration of Inde
pendence issued as a consequence of similar circum
t M s prevailing new in North Africa:
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are created equal, that they are endowed by
! A• ii• Creator with certain unalienable rights, that
.••:n >n*j these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap
l>i s That t) secure these rights, governments are
ii : ituted among men. deriving their just powers
from the consent of the governed. That whenever any
form ol government becomes destructive of these
ends, it is the right of the people to alter and to
abolish it.and to institute new government, laying
i: , foundation on such principles and organizing its
powers in such form, as to them shall seem most
likely to effect their safety and happiness."
The North African Arabs are fighting for an inde

penitence, for a freedom they are fully entitled to.

egypt and morocco
To the Editor:
Many points of interest which were raised by Mr.
H. Blanchenay s* speech (Oct. 1!J) about Morocco need
explanation to avoid misunderstanding. I will try to
£0 through these intricate points quite simply, espe
cially those that are related to the part played by
Kt-ypt in Morocco troubles and the relation between
education and religion in thai part oi the world.
First, Mr. Blanchenay considered that Egypt, as a
member of the Arab League, played and is still play
ing an important part in arousing the troubles in
Morocco. This part, which is more accurately called
Egypt's sympathy, is not of primary importance com
pared with the other factors that result from the ac
tual conditions of Morocco. Egypt's sympathy for her
sister, Morocco, is expressed mainly in her radio
broadcasts. However, this feeling is but a belated
reflection of what Egypt learned from the revolt of
the Western people that began with the revolutions
of the U.S. and France for ideal purposes, "De
mocracy and Freedom."
Also, this feeling is the result of the unright con
ditions imposed on the Arabs of this country. I think
that this sympathy is not strictly Egyptian; it is- shared
and expressed differently by many countries toward
others which are still suffering from colonialism and
which cannot get for themselves governments, in
Lincoln's words, that are "of the people, by the
people, and for the people."
Secondly, the difficulty in educating the Moroccan
natives is claimed by Mr. Blanchenay to be another
factor of the continuing disagreement between
France and Morocco. This difficulty, as he considered,
is the result of their Islamic traditions. I would like
to say that Islam as a religion is not at all an ob
stacle against education, and with just a look at the
Kora'an (Moslems' Holy Book), one can feel the
emphasis placed on learning; as a matter of fact
"gaining knowledge from birthday to death" is one
of Islam's laws. Also, the Islamic civilization is a
sufficient criterion against his idea.
So this religion wholeheartedly supports educa
tion, but the lack of opportunities and facilities is
the main factor that hinders it. And as a rule, where
these opportunities are found, the men are the first
to be educated. This is a normal fact in all countries
of the world. So Morocco is not unique in that most
of its women are not educated considering all condi
tions present in Morocco.

air force display
To the Editor:
I would like to correct a section of "This Week on
Quad" (Daily. Oct. 17). It is true that the Air Force
is setting up a display at the Pavilion, but it will be
there Wednesday and Thursday from 8 to 4:30.
The author will be quite welcome to come in his
Wheat Chex space helmet with the oxygen tubes
printed on the side if that's the way he prefers to
travel. Space helmets are not required for those who
would like to view the display more informally.
