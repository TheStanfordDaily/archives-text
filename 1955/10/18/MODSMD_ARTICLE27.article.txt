They are having election board trouble down
at USC. According to the Daily Trojan, "An
ordinary lead pencil caused the ASSC Senate
to reject the results of two offices voted upon
in last week's election."
The chairman of the Senate Elections Inves
tigating Committee reported that a regular
graphite pencil was found in one voting booth
iit. r :lead of the special electrographic pencil
i ; i :ed for the IBM voting tabulating machine.
Becau e of the voided votes, the offices of
the already three-times contested commerce
presidency and that of frosh vice-president
we.'O due to be voted on again Friday.
The USC campus is still rocking from the
uproar caused by Patty Waggon, the artist
who entertained the Kappa Sigs last June.
Wampus, the campus humor magazine, was
temporarily curtailed in the publication of its
;'rr:t issue because of a revealing editorial
about the incident.
According to a front page Daily Trojan edi
tc. i.ll, the University would not allow the paper
; j print the irue story. Consequently the ex
pelled Kappa Sigs went around campus telling
how they were "done wrong," that after all
ihere was nothing wrong with having a quiet
c /ening's entertainment provided by an oblig
ing stripper.
The Warnpus got its editorial material from
one of the Kappa Sigs, who now admits he lied
to the writer. According to the Trojan editorial,
the situation "would never have happened if
the university had decided to 'come clean' with
the WHOLE story." <Â»
opeaking of intellectual activities, it appears
that students at Duke University are rushing
the spring season a bit. The Duke Chronicle
states, "A yelling mob of almost 500 under
graduates in search of women's panties raided
llanos House (a nurses' dorm) Wednesday
night. Police reported an actual invasion of the
nurses' home by some 20 students."
The spoils of the invaders, many of them

dressed only in pajamas, were estimated at 10
pairs of panties (one bright red pair) and at
least one slip.
The incident was quickly condemned by all
the university officials. Particularly disturbed
were the ROTC instructors. The ROTC captain
outrageously and bluntly declared, "Uprisings
and manifestations of such emotional phenom
ena are deplored. They represent irresponsi
bility and immaturity which will not be con
doned in members of this unit."
At UCLA more concrete steps are being
taken to eliminate the parking problem. Sev
eral alternate plans are now up before the re
gents of the university.
The most likely to be passed plan as passed
by the student parking committee calls for a
semesterly fee to be paid for the use of most
campus parking areas. Certain areas are to
remain as free parking lots.
From the money derived from the parking
fees, multi-level garages are to be built.
A further proposal is that parking meters be
installed on streets running through the cam
pus for short-time parking.
Western Civ appears to be a rather contro
versial course at the University of Kansas. Let
ters to the editor have been written to the uni
versity Daily Kansan about the course. The
paper in turn has published editorials pro and
con on the course.
The program has been charged with allow
ing those students who cram for the material
to pass, while students who study it legiti
mately fail.
One Kansan editor declared that all that was
needed to get a passing grade in the course
was to take a three-day exam course. These
charges were angrily denied by the Western
Civ director and instructors.
Avid supporters of the course are foreign
students at Kansas, say that the course closely
approximates many that they have had at their
European universities.
