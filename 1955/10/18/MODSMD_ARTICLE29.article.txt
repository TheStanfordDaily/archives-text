# Hartz Takes Over Faltering Poli Union
## Senator knowland To Speak Next Week At Political Union 
### JIM PALMER 
Next week the Stanford Po
litical Union will launch its third
year ol a somewhat precarious
existence, when Senator Wil
liam F. Knowland steps to the
Memorial Auditorium platform
Poli Union has struggled along for
two years, almost running out of gas
at several points. But this year a
confident new leader has taken the
reins and declares, "We're here to
stay."
'the new leader is Ernie Hartz, a
junior political science major from
Bethesda, Md.
His theory for putting new life
into the Poli Union: "Develop stu
dent participation through more cau
cus activity, and bring outstanding
speakers to the campus giving a
chance for students to see the people
who make the laws."
FINANCIAL REPORT
At the close of last year ASSU
Student Manager Bob Gable noted
in his financial report that the Poli
Union might be considered "one of
the multitudinous and driveling" or
ganizations on campus.
Poli Union operation from both
financial and achievement stand
points lent some justification to the
charge, it was said.
Not only that, but lack of student
participation and a certain amount
of apathy toward politics stunted the
Union's growth.
This was the situation that Hartz
faced as he took control this fail.
But all was not gloomy. A budget
of $392 —the highest in Poli Union
history—has been approved for the
year.
Two outstanding speakers—Sena
tor Knowland aind Senator Thomas
H. Kuchel—were quickly lined up.
And caucus activity got off to a slow
but promising start.
The Independent caucus drew ap
proximately 50 persons to hear Ma
jor George Racey Jordan speak (in
competition with Olympic Day). Re
publicans and Democrats were con
siderably less successful. The GOP
lacked a speaker, and the Demos
drew a handful to hear Robert A.
Horn of the political science depart
ment.
"We expect the caucus attendance
to pick up after the first big meet
ing," Hartz says.
As for the budget—"it has been
quite considerably raised, but in the
past it was not a true estimate of
costs." The expense of bringing a
speaker like Knowland to the cam
pus is about $25 —"really a bargain."
LAST YEAR'S SPEAKERS
Last year Poli Union featured such
speakers as Minnesota Senator Hu
bert Humphrey and anti-trust man
Stanley Barnes, but neither drew the
crowds they should have, according
to Hartz.
"It was quite amazing," he said,
"all the political science majors who
didn't show up for the speakers.
Apathy was partly our fault—we
didn't develop the caucus to its full
potential."
With the coming year of political
elections Hartz expects more interest
in politics and politicians, and thus a
more lively Poli Union.
The group's constitution orovides

for a student speaker to follow the
main speaker on the program. This
has brought about a problem that
has bogged down previous Poli
Unions, Hartz points out.
Hartz would like to put the stress
on informal debates alter the pro
gram and on use of caucus sessions,
in order to achieve the element of
student participation that Poli Union
needs for survival.
"But," he continues, "we are not
trying to turn it into a student de
bating society."
HE'S A DEMOCRAT
For the record, Hartz says he is a
Democrat —but of course non-parti
san so far as his position with Poli
Union goes.
On the national scene, he com
ments that the Democrats "would
be foolish to run anyone but Steven
son." As for the GOP: "Warren
would probably be the strongest
candidate—but he would have much
opposition in the South."
As for Poli Union, Hartz con
cludes: "People are just getting to
understand what it is. I still find
some who haven't the slightest idea
of who we are and what we're doing.
"But we're growing, and have two
years behind us. We're here to stay."
