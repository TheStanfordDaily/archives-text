UCLA 21, STANFORD 13
This game showed -that UCLA is not invincible. After being rushed off
its feet in the first half, Stanford came I aek in the second half full ol de
termination and had the powerful Bruins dandling on the ropes at the
finish.
Many of the- Indian second-stringers really came into their own in this
game. Quarterback John Brodie completely revenged himself for last year's
debacle by completing 17 of 28 passes for 188 yards and skillfully directing
the Stanford second-half attack. Sophomore halfback Jeri McMillin proved
himself to be an outstanding runner by repeatedly ripping off good gains
through the tough Bruin line.
Senior halfback Jerry Angove played exceptionally on defense and shook
loose on several occasions to take a Brodie pass, Ends Carl Isaacs and Gary
Van Galder came through on several clutch plays with outstanding catches
to keep Stanford drives alive.
But for the wild running of UCLA tailback Sam "First Down" Brown,
the Indians might well have won the game. The speedy Bruin accounted
for 119 of UCLA's 178 yards gained by rushing. Otherwise Stanford did an
outstanding job in containing the supposedly omnipotent Bruin ground
game. Fullback Bob Davenport picked up a respectable 56 yards on 13
carries but wingback Jim Decker was completely throttled on his feared
weak side reverses.
If the Indians can now just keep up the effort and continue to show the
100 per cent determination that they displayed in the second hall' Saturday,
Washington and USC will find the Indians to be a tough hurdle.
SOUTHERN CAL 33, WISCONSIN 21
The Trojans came back like a cyclone after their defeat at the bands
of Washington last week. Wisconsin came into the Coliseum with an un
beaten record and the reputation of being one of the top two or three
powers in the Big Ttn. They left the Coliseum a thoroughly battered team.
USC tailback Jon Arnett blew through the Badger line for great chunks
of yardage and the other Trojan backs gained consistently. Wisconsin
quarterback Jim Ualuska, a fine passer, kept the Badgers in the game for
three quarters with his accurate aerials. He completed seven for nine in
the first quarter and 12 for 21 for the game. In the third quarter, Haluska
threw a 78-yard touchdown strike to halfback John Bridgman.
BAYLOR 13, WASHINGTON 7
In another big intersectional game on trio Coast, Washington was rudely
dumped from the ranks of the unbeaten. The Huskies started strong in
the game. They drove to one touchdown in the first quarter and had a
90-yard drive stopped by a fumble on the Baylor one-foot line. Thereafter,
however, the game was dominated by the Bears from the Southwest Con
ference.
Baylor got a drive going late in the first half and scored on the last play
of the half to tie the game. The Bears took the opening kiekoff of the
second half, drove to another touchdown, and then hung on for the win.
OREGON 21, CALIFORNIA ft
The Bears were really inept in this one. In their first night game in
history, Cal was in the dark all the way. The speedy Oregon backs raced
through the Cal defenses for three touchdowns and narrowly missed get
ting a couple more.
The Bears showed a punchless offense. They gained 108 yards on the
ground but their passing attack, supposedly their best weapon, got the
Bears only 37 yards. Only twice did Cal even get into Oregon territory—
once to the 22 and once to the 45.
The Ducks scored twice in the second quarter and once in the third
quarter to administer the Bears their worst lacing from Oregon since 1917.

Senior halfback Jerry Angove played exceptionally on defense and shook
loose on several occasions to take a Brodie pass, Ends Carl Isaacs and Gary
Van Galder came through on several clutch plays with outstanding catches
to keep Stanford drives alive.
But for the wild running of UCLA tailback Sam "First Down" Brown,
the Indians might well have won the game. The speedy Bruin accounted
for 119 of UCLA's 178 yards gained by rushing. Otherwise Stanford did an
outstanding job in containing the supposedly omnipotent Bruin ground
game. Fullback Bob Davenport picked up a respectable 56 yards on 13
carries but wingback Jim Decker was completely throttled on his feared
weak side reverses.
If the Indians can now just keep up the effort and continue to show the
100 per cent determination that they displayed in the second hall' Saturday,
Washington and USC will find the Indians to be a tough hurdle.
SOUTHERN CAL 33, WISCONSIN 21
The Trojans came back like a cyclone after their defeat at the bands
of Washington last week. Wisconsin came into the Coliseum with an un
beaten record and the reputation of being one of the top two or three
powers in the Big Ttn. They left the Coliseum a thoroughly battered team.
USC tailback Jon Arnett blew through the Badger line for great chunks
of yardage and the other Trojan backs gained consistently. Wisconsin
quarterback Jim Ualuska, a fine passer, kept the Badgers in the game for
three quarters with his accurate aerials. He completed seven for nine in
the first quarter and 12 for 21 for the game. In the third quarter, Haluska
threw a 78-yard touchdown strike to halfback John Bridgman.
BAYLOR 13, WASHINGTON 7
In another big intersectional game on trio Coast, Washington was rudely
dumped from the ranks of the unbeaten. The Huskies started strong in
the game. They drove to one touchdown in the first quarter and had a
90-yard drive stopped by a fumble on the Baylor one-foot line. Thereafter,
however, the game was dominated by the Bears from the Southwest Con
ference.
Baylor got a drive going late in the first half and scored on the last play
of the half to tie the game. The Bears took the opening kiekoff of the
second half, drove to another touchdown, and then hung on for the win.
OREGON 21, CALIFORNIA ft
The Bears were really inept in this one. In their first night game in
history, Cal was in the dark all the way. The speedy Oregon backs raced
through the Cal defenses for three touchdowns and narrowly missed get
ting a couple more.
The Bears showed a punchless offense. They gained 108 yards on the
ground but their passing attack, supposedly their best weapon, got the
Bears only 37 yards. Only twice did Cal even get into Oregon territory—
once to the 22 and once to the 45.
The Ducks scored twice in the second quarter and once in the third
quarter to administer the Bears their worst lacing from Oregon since 1917.
UCLA 21, STANFORD 13
This game showed -that UCLA is not invincible. After being rushed off
its feet in the first half, Stanford came I aek in the second half full ol de
termination and had the powerful Bruins dandling on the ropes at the
finish.
Many of the- Indian second-stringers really came into their own in this
game. Quarterback John Brodie completely revenged himself for last year's
debacle by completing 17 of 28 passes for 188 yards and skillfully directing
the Stanford second-half attack. Sophomore halfback Jeri McMillin proved
himself to be an outstanding runner by repeatedly ripping off good gains
through the tough Bruin line.
