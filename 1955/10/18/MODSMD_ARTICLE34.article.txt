INDIAN COMPLETION â€” Bruin defenders close in but Stan
ford's Jerry Angove goes high into the air to snag one of John
Brodie's aerials in Saturday's Stanford-Uclan grid spectacle.
Coming up on the play is Bruin captain Hardiman Cureton (60)
and tackle Roger White (78), while reserve halfback Louis Elias
(32) attempts in vain to deflect the pass.
