# Taylor Hints at Changes In Next Week's Lineup
## 
### BOB MIEROW 
Coach Chuck Taylor yesterday
disclosed that a very good chance
exists for some changes in Stanford's
starting lineup Saturday against the
Washington Huskies in Seattle.
The red-headed Card mentor stat
ed that "it is too early in the week
to name a starting team."
Sub fullback A 1 Harrington and
reserve tackle Don Manoukian had
to miss yesterday's practice. Har
rington has been suffering from the
flu, while the stubby lineman has
had stomach trouble.
Final news on the season's outlook
for halfback Lou Valli will probably
be announced today, according to
trainer Connie Jarvis. The speedy
sophomore has had an injured knee
since the COP game, and it is doubt

ful that he will see any more action
this year.
Left halfbacks Paul Camera and
Jerry Angove, both suffering minor
injuries in the UCLA encounter,
were in uniform for yesterday's drill.
Camera has a* possible cracked rib,
while Angove injured his leg.
Jackie Douglas, third-string signal
caller, quarterbacked a varsity squad
consisting mostly of reserves against
the Braves in a scrimmage to end
the drill.
