# Pappy Waldorf Hanged in Effigy
## 
### 
Coach Lynn O. (Pappy) Waldorf
was hanged in effigy last Saturday
night after California lost its third
football game of the season to the
University of Oregon. The effigy,
made of straw and newspaper sports
pages, bore a piece of cardboard
with the inscription "Waldorf Was
Laid Here Oct. 15."
This year has .been Pappy's worst
since he took over the head coach
ing chores at Berkeley in 1946. His
team has only been able to win one
game in five starts, and still has to
face UCLA, USC. Oregon State,
Washington and—you guessed it—
Stanford!
