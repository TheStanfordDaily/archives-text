STANFORD'S Carl Isaacs (8:{) and
Jerry Angove (40) leam up to
stop UCLA tailback Gerry Mc-
Dougall in Saturday's action. An
gove, senior halfback, stood out
for Chuck Taylor's eleven on de
fen.se throughout the game, while
Isaacs made several brilliant
catches from his end position to
shine on offense. Both of these '
boys, on the basis of their play
against the Bruins, figure to see j
lots of action against Washington
next week.
