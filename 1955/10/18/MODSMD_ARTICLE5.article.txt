## 
### 
PITTSBURGHâ€”A walkout of 44,-
000 CIO Electrical workers has para
lyzed the sprawling Westinghouse
Corporation . It is the second strike
to hit Westinghouse in the past five
weeks.
The strike began at midnight Sun
day and pulled employees out of 28
Westinghouse plants across the na
tion. The walkout was called after
all-day sessions between company
and union negotiators here failed to
settle the dispute and reach agree
ment on a new contract.
International Electrical Workers'
Union President James Carey
charged that Westinghouse failed to
bargain in what he called "good
faith." But a company spokesman
said Carey's charge was "complete
nonsense."
