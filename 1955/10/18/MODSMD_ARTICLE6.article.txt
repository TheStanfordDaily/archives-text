# French Moroccan Plan Faces Big Tests Today

### 
PARIS â€” The French plan for
bringing peace to trigger-tense Mo
rocco goes into operation tomorrow,
but it faces two big stumbling
blocks.
Premier Edgar Faure is setting up
his four-man throne council amid
angry protests from both the na
tionalists and the French colonists
in Morocco.
The nationalists backed up their
protests by touching of! a new wave
of terrorism. Two Moroccans were
killed as riots broke out in three of
the protectorate's biggest cities.
The nationalists say the French
originally promised them a three
man council to rule until a repre
sentative government can be set up.
Meanwhile, die-hard French colo
nists in Morocco have warned the
government against establishing a
four-man throne council. They say
Iho makeup of the council will tilt
the balance of power against them,
and say it will lead to fresh trouble
in the protectorate.
