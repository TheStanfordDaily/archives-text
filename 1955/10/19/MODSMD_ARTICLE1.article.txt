### 
Roth House is the current
leader in the Community Chest
Drive competition, Chest drive
:reasurer Bob Clemmer report
ed yesterday afternoon.
In the first day of competition
Roth has turned in 41 per cent of
its share of the all-campus goal,
which is $1 a student,
Second place in the drive is shared
by Hurlburt House and Hawthorne
Cottage, both of which have turned
in 36 per cent of their goals. Their
solicitors are Marni Rogers for Hurl
burt and Ellen Kroh fov Hawthorne.
OTHER DONATIONS
The other living units which do
nated yesterday rank as follows: In
third place, Storey House with 27
per cent; in fourth place, Durand
with 23 per cent; in fifth place, Jor
dan with 20 per cent; and, in sixth,
Madrono, with 19 per cent.-
Clemmer explained that some so
licitors were late in starting their
collections, because they missed the
Monday briefing session.
LAGUNITA CASAS
Two groups who did donate, he
added, but were not included in the
final ranking, were casas Granada
and Olivo, at Lagunita Court. The
drive committee has not yet learned
the number of girls in each casa,
and cannot compute their percent
ages without that information. It
seems likely that both casas have
done well in the competition, how
ever, Clemmer said. Granada has
turned in $31, the largest amount re
ceived from a living group, and
Olivo has donated the third largest
sum, $11.
INDIVIDUAL DONORS
Individual donors who live in
areas not covered by the solicitors,
such as off-campus and graduate
students, are being encouraged by
the drive committee to contribute
their money at a special Roble booth j
at the Cellar. Clemmer will be in
the Student Union Nitery from 2 to I
3 p.m. to accept money from solici- I
tors, and students may give their
contributions to him also.

are: Fred Fortine, chairman; Kathy I
McAllister, co-chairman; Carol Ey
mann, publicity manager; and Bob
