JET DISPLAYED HEREâ€”A cutaway F-86 Sabrejet fighter is be
ing displayed in front of the Pavilion today and tomorrow be
tween 8 a.m. and 4:3 C p.m. by the Peter McArthur Cadet Society
of the Air Force ROTC. The plane is a wingless version of the
North American F-86 fighter and has been prepared so that
spectators may view the jet engine, flight controls, and other
intricate equipment in the craft. A special ramp has been built
on the plane's trailer so visitors may examine closely the cock
pit and ejector seat. Also to be seen is a theme exhibit, "Mission
of the Air Force." This half of the display is designed to show
how the Air Force is organized to defend the country.
