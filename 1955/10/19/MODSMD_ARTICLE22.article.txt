## 
### 
Stanford's enrollment stood at 7,-
591 students when autumn quarter
registration period ended yesterday,
according to Registrar Harvey Hall.
The total is exactly 300 higher
than the enrollment of a year ago,
with a large part of the increase
occurring at the graduate level.
In 1954 there were 5,254 men and
2,037 women enrolled, as compared
with this year's totals of 5,581 and
2,010, respectively.
The current figure, which includes
5,581 men and 2,010 women, boosts
registration back to where it stood
in 1951. The University's all-time
high is 8,365 students in 1948.
