the statement
To the Editor:
I have been asked by The Stanford Daily to
explain why Prince Lightfoot and the yell leader
were not invited to accompany the team on the
Michigan State trip.
'Ihe Athletic Department has never assumed
the financial responsibility for sending either one
of these parties on football trips. Therefore, in
planning a trip the following order of preferences
1 •;i been used since the teams started flying:
Category No. 1
I-layers—117 (maximum limit under Conference
regulations).
Coaches —4.
Trainer —1.
Doctor—1.

Managers—2.
Director—l.
News Service Director —1 (returning only).
Total—47.
Category No. 2
Press—s to (i (it happens to be six on the
Washington trip).
Category No.
Anyone who wants to may pay his way on the
charter, thus reducing" the cost of the trip to
the Athletic Department. It so happens on the
Washington and USC trips we have more re
quests in this category than we can accommo
date.
In setting up the trip, the Department cannot
count on more than 56 seats, although at times
the airline will furnish a 58-passenger plane.
The airline cannot determine this until almost
flight time, with the result that the Department
cannot gamble on the two seats being available
on either the going or the return trip.
Category No. 4
If after the foregoing categories have been
covered there are any remaining seats available,
the wives of the staff have drawn lots for the
privilege of accompanying the team, or the Di
rector has invited a University official to make
the trip.
As noted above, the first three categories have
filled the plane for both the Washington and
USC trips.
Sincerely yours,
ALFRED R. MASTERS
Director of Athletics
(Editor's note: We suggest that the time has
come for the Athletic Department to recon
sider its policy. Categories No. 1 and No. 2
total 5.'! seats, leaving three vacancies. Why is
it necessary for the Athletic Department to
take paying passengers to see the students'
football team play when the students evidently
want their own representatives?)

'Ihe Athletic Department has never assumed
the financial responsibility for sending either one
of these parties on football trips. Therefore, in
planning a trip the following order of preferences
1 •;i been used since the teams started flying:
Category No. 1
I-layers—117 (maximum limit under Conference
regulations).
Coaches —4.
Trainer —1.
Doctor—1.

Managers—2.
Director—l.
News Service Director —1 (returning only).
Total—47.
Category No. 2
Press—s to (i (it happens to be six on the
Washington trip).
Category No.
Anyone who wants to may pay his way on the
charter, thus reducing" the cost of the trip to
the Athletic Department. It so happens on the
Washington and USC trips we have more re
quests in this category than we can accommo
date.
In setting up the trip, the Department cannot
count on more than 56 seats, although at times
the airline will furnish a 58-passenger plane.
The airline cannot determine this until almost
flight time, with the result that the Department
cannot gamble on the two seats being available
on either the going or the return trip.
Category No. 4
If after the foregoing categories have been
covered there are any remaining seats available,
the wives of the staff have drawn lots for the
privilege of accompanying the team, or the Di
rector has invited a University official to make
the trip.
As noted above, the first three categories have
filled the plane for both the Washington and
USC trips.
Sincerely yours,
ALFRED R. MASTERS
Director of Athletics
(Editor's note: We suggest that the time has
come for the Athletic Department to recon
sider its policy. Categories No. 1 and No. 2
total 5.'! seats, leaving three vacancies. Why is
it necessary for the Athletic Department to
take paying passengers to see the students'
football team play when the students evidently
want their own representatives?)
