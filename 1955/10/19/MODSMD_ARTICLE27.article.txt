# action, not complaints
## 
### 
Traffic at Stanford University is a mess. We
all know that, we all complain about it. But few
of us are doing anything constructive about it.
Other than# blocking off certain roads Uni
versity officials have done little to help things.
"We are looking into it," they say. They are
looking into it. In the meantime they ask the
patience of students and advise merely, "Walk,
don't drive, to class." Good, sound advice,
which we heartily endorse.
But you can't expect students to suddenly
break their long standing habits of driving
anywhere and everywhere. Especially with no
explanation of future plans. Definite plans
must be formulated and presented to students
if the traffic mess, which is rapidly becoming
worse, is to be straightened out.
ASSU President George Ralph and the mem
bers of Legislature have taken this position and
have done something about bringing about
more action. They have formed a special com
mittee on traffic problems, which will look into
possible solutions to the mess.
We like this. A students' problem being
handled by students. Certainly the adminis
tration has plans and solutions, but they are
for the long run, not necessarily for the benefit

of today's students, the ones on Quad right
now.
Bob Maddock and his Traffic Com are acting.
They're not sitting around complaining about
"this terrible traffic," waiting for official Univer
sity action.
What will come of the committee's actions
we don't know. But we're certain that the ad
ministration will listen, and listen hard, to their
findings.
It would be justifiable for the University to
rule that no freshmen or sophomores be al
lowed to drive on campus; other colleges have
done that. Or they could ban all cars from
campus. That's not as far-fetched as it sounds.
But other alternatives are wanted, needed. Al
ternatives which the Traffic Com is investigat
ing.
Perhaps parking meters, perhaps new park
ing lots, or maybe special student parking
stickers. Whatever the correct solution, it is
being sought by the committee. Sought in the
interest of students.
Here's a group who've substituted com
plaints with work. Good constructive work. To
make Stanford a better, safer place in which
to drive, today.

bers of Legislature have taken this position and
have done something about bringing about
more action. They have formed a special com
mittee on traffic problems, which will look into
possible solutions to the mess.
We like this. A students' problem being
handled by students. Certainly the adminis
tration has plans and solutions, but they are
for the long run, not necessarily for the benefit

of today's students, the ones on Quad right
now.
Bob Maddock and his Traffic Com are acting.
They're not sitting around complaining about
"this terrible traffic," waiting for official Univer
sity action.
What will come of the committee's actions
we don't know. But we're certain that the ad
ministration will listen, and listen hard, to their
findings.
It would be justifiable for the University to
rule that no freshmen or sophomores be al
lowed to drive on campus; other colleges have
done that. Or they could ban all cars from
campus. That's not as far-fetched as it sounds.
But other alternatives are wanted, needed. Al
ternatives which the Traffic Com is investigat
ing.
Perhaps parking meters, perhaps new park
ing lots, or maybe special student parking
stickers. Whatever the correct solution, it is
being sought by the committee. Sought in the
interest of students.
Here's a group who've substituted com
plaints with work. Good constructive work. To
make Stanford a better, safer place in which
to drive, today.
