Judging from the story in Monday's Daily about
Stanford's new literary magazine, it seems to me that
this fifteenth attempt may fall as flat on its face as its
)4 predecessors; or if it does not, it won't be the fault
of its name.
Magazines with "clever" titles are a dime a dozen.
The least "Stanford One's" editors could do is give
il a fighting chance for survival.

disturbing secrecy
To the Editor:
In the past two weeks a large number of letters
have been printed in The Daily with "Name with
held by request" appended at the bottom. This rash
of secrecy seems to have started with the infantile
discussion over the so-called obscene story told at the
footbdll rally. It was continued on Monday by two
inoi r unsigned letters, neithey of which expressed any
traitorous, heretical, «r libelous statements which
expose the writers to legal action.
it seems to me that the expression of opinion in this
way is a disturbing thing. We live in a free country;
wo attend a well-known University. Here if any
where we are free to say what we think. And yet

many people who held an opinion strong enough to
write to The Daily about it seem to be afraid to let
their fellow students know they hold such an opinion.
I don't know—to me the whole thing smacks of
hypocrisy, with perhaps a touch of McCarthyism
thrown in for good measure.

(Editor's note: We agree that this trend is un
fortunate: il is perhaps The Daily's fault. If the
policy continues to be abused, the policy will be
changed.)
homecoming success
To the Editor:
As chairman of this year's Homecoming Week, I
would like to give my deepest thanks to all of the
students who helped to make the 1955 Homecoming
a great success.
With Homecoming taking place in only the third
week of the school year, the short time available for
planning and building floats was critical, but never
theless this year's floats were among the most unique
ever to be created.
Thanks are also due to the fraternities and eating
clubs for co-operating to make the Alumni Home
coming Luncheon a huge success. With nearly 200
guests attending, the luncheon was the largest in
many years.

To the Editor:
As chairman of this year's Homecoming Week, I
would like to give my deepest thanks to all of the
students who helped to make the 1955 Homecoming
a great success.
With Homecoming taking place in only the third
week of the school year, the short time available for
planning and building floats was critical, but never
theless this year's floats were among the most unique
ever to be created.
Thanks are also due to the fraternities and eating
clubs for co-operating to make the Alumni Home
coming Luncheon a huge success. With nearly 200
guests attending, the luncheon was the largest in
many years.

clever' titl es
To tlio Editor:
Judging from the story in Monday's Daily about
Stanford's new literary magazine, it seems to me that
this fifteenth attempt may fall as flat on its face as its
)4 predecessors; or if it does not, it won't be the fault
of its name.
Magazines with "clever" titles are a dime a dozen.
The least "Stanford One's" editors could do is give
il a fighting chance for survival.

disturbing secrecy
To the Editor:
In the past two weeks a large number of letters
have been printed in The Daily with "Name with
held by request" appended at the bottom. This rash
of secrecy seems to have started with the infantile
discussion over the so-called obscene story told at the
footbdll rally. It was continued on Monday by two
inoi r unsigned letters, neithey of which expressed any
traitorous, heretical, «r libelous statements which
expose the writers to legal action.
it seems to me that the expression of opinion in this
way is a disturbing thing. We live in a free country;
wo attend a well-known University. Here if any
where we are free to say what we think. And yet

many people who held an opinion strong enough to
write to The Daily about it seem to be afraid to let
their fellow students know they hold such an opinion.
I don't know—to me the whole thing smacks of
hypocrisy, with perhaps a touch of McCarthyism
thrown in for good measure.

(Editor's note: We agree that this trend is un
fortunate: il is perhaps The Daily's fault. If the
policy continues to be abused, the policy will be
changed.)
