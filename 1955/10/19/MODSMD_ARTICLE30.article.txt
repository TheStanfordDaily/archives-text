# From Another Viewpoint
## 
### WILFRED H. STONE Assistant Professor of English 
For a faculty member to speak
out about the nature and con
duct of Stanford's undergradu
ate social program may be con
sidered as improper from the
students' point of view and in
expedient from his own.
Aware of these dangers, I should
like to emphasize at the outset that
what I offer are only suggestions,
and that, aware of my own ignorance
about many phases of the under
graduate's life, I am only describing
the problem as it appears from the
teacher's side of the desk.
That problem is, briefly, this. Over
the past five years I have been in
creasingly impressed by the fact
that multitudes of students on this
campus have been genuinely op
pressed by the social demands upon
them to be "active," to serve on
committees, to keep their status with
the group. I have listened to in
numerable students who have felt
that the pressure to engage in "ac
tivities" was so intense that it be
came a genuine struggle to find time
to read or think—to say nothing of
finding an opportunity for that con
templation which all genuine learn
ing inevitably entails. These com
plaints have been so numerous and
insistent that I have come to suspect
that a mighty groundswell of dis
satisfaction prevails among the stu
dent body itself, and that it only
needs articulation for something to
be done about it. In no sense am I
trying to interfere in the students'
bailiwick, but if my observations
happen to coincide with popular
feeling, then perhaps they might be
regarded as constructive and not
just the wailings of a longhair.
In short, I think the social pro
gram must be curtailed if Stanford
is going to grow as an intellectual
institution. I suggest that the fol
lowing activities are eligible for
early treatment:
Hell Week. I think Hell Week
could be abolished or reduced—at
the most, to two days. The conflict
between this activity and a student's
studies is all too obvious, and in my
experience a great many students
expect the academic program to give.
Rally Com. I like football and am
all for a certain amount of rah-rah
stuff, but I think the physical and
intellectual labor spent on such
things as card stunts is entirely out
of proportion to the benefits re
ceived. Why not be a little less or
ganized, and take a chance that
natural high spirits and a good
cheering squad can provide enough
fanfare at a game to satisfy the most
jadsd alumnus? Rallies could, I
think, be limited to two to a quarter.
Floats. The money that is spent
on floats is one thing, and could be
used more usefully in buying books
for house or dormitory libraries, for
example. But the time spent on the
floats is even more important. Last
week literally hundreds of students
had no time for anything else, and
in some of the girls' houses the peiv
nicious practice of fining students for
non-cooperation is practiced. This is,
in my mind, immoral. If a student
is bored with floats, or wants to
study, that certainly is his privilege.
What's that about the winds of free
dom? Why not build one float? We
can't have Mardi gras every week,
but the fall social program suggests
that we're trying. And, in this con
nection—why can't Homecoming and
Big Game be made the same event?
Back-to-the-Furm Week. Except,
perhaps, for carrying the torch to

Rudy's, all other parts of this wilt
ing tradition could, I think, be
dropped. Games Day gets a laggard
response, and the Farm Follies were,
I gather, something less than satis
factory. Save a day, perhaps—but
why take a week?
These are just suggestions. You
take them from there. But, lest I
seem to be entirely negative, I'd like
to point out that I think many as
pects of the social program are good
and ought to be encouraged: ex

changes, house dances, intramural
athletics, etc. I have, too, been great
ly impressed with the work of cer
tain committees, .such as Pre Reg
Committee. But, nonetheless, there
is, in my opinion, an enormous
amount of useless "busywork" in
the average undergraduate's social
life. If this energy had more oppor
tunity lor expression in such areas
as debate, student publications, dis
cussion groups, political societies,
and the like, Stanford's undergradu
ate life would seem considerably
less adolescent than it now does in
comparison with student life on such
campuses as Harvard, Princeton and
Yale.
The assumption prevails, I think,
that to be "active" is a virtue en
tirely apart from what the purpose
of that activity may be. I think this
is a dangerous fallacy. "Personal
adjustment" is an intellectual as well
as a social matter, and when the
pressures to be "active" cause the
student to live in an unrelieved
manic state and—for those who want
to learn—in a state of perpetual
frustration, then I think the ideal
of "personal adjustment" is having
a rough ride.
I suggest these things only because
I suspect that you as students want
something done about them. If so,
why not start the cutting now—
either with my list or one of your
own devising?

ate social program may be con
sidered as improper from the
students' point of view and in
expedient from his own.
Aware of these dangers, I should
like to emphasize at the outset that
what I offer are only suggestions,
and that, aware of my own ignorance
about many phases of the under
graduate's life, I am only describing
the problem as it appears from the
teacher's side of the desk.
That problem is, briefly, this. Over
the past five years I have been in
creasingly impressed by the fact
that multitudes of students on this
campus have been genuinely op
pressed by the social demands upon
them to be "active," to serve on
committees, to keep their status with
the group. I have listened to in
numerable students who have felt
that the pressure to engage in "ac
tivities" was so intense that it be
came a genuine struggle to find time
to read or think—to say nothing of
finding an opportunity for that con
templation which all genuine learn
ing inevitably entails. These com
plaints have been so numerous and
insistent that I have come to suspect
that a mighty groundswell of dis
satisfaction prevails among the stu
dent body itself, and that it only
needs articulation for something to
be done about it. In no sense am I
trying to interfere in the students'
bailiwick, but if my observations
happen to coincide with popular
feeling, then perhaps they might be
regarded as constructive and not
just the wailings of a longhair.
In short, I think the social pro
gram must be curtailed if Stanford
is going to grow as an intellectual
institution. I suggest that the fol
lowing activities are eligible for
early treatment:
Hell Week. I think Hell Week
could be abolished or reduced—at
the most, to two days. The conflict
between this activity and a student's
studies is all too obvious, and in my
experience a great many students
expect the academic program to give.
Rally Com. I like football and am
all for a certain amount of rah-rah
stuff, but I think the physical and
intellectual labor spent on such
things as card stunts is entirely out
of proportion to the benefits re
ceived. Why not be a little less or
ganized, and take a chance that
natural high spirits and a good
cheering squad can provide enough
fanfare at a game to satisfy the most
jadsd alumnus? Rallies could, I
think, be limited to two to a quarter.
Floats. The money that is spent
on floats is one thing, and could be
used more usefully in buying books
for house or dormitory libraries, for
example. But the time spent on the
floats is even more important. Last
week literally hundreds of students
had no time for anything else, and
in some of the girls' houses the peiv
nicious practice of fining students for
non-cooperation is practiced. This is,
in my mind, immoral. If a student
is bored with floats, or wants to
study, that certainly is his privilege.
What's that about the winds of free
dom? Why not build one float? We
can't have Mardi gras every week,
but the fall social program suggests
that we're trying. And, in this con
nection—why can't Homecoming and
Big Game be made the same event?
Back-to-the-Furm Week. Except,
perhaps, for carrying the torch to

Rudy's, all other parts of this wilt
ing tradition could, I think, be
dropped. Games Day gets a laggard
response, and the Farm Follies were,
I gather, something less than satis
factory. Save a day, perhaps—but
why take a week?
These are just suggestions. You
take them from there. But, lest I
seem to be entirely negative, I'd like
to point out that I think many as
pects of the social program are good
and ought to be encouraged: ex

changes, house dances, intramural
athletics, etc. I have, too, been great
ly impressed with the work of cer
tain committees, .such as Pre Reg
Committee. But, nonetheless, there
is, in my opinion, an enormous
amount of useless "busywork" in
the average undergraduate's social
life. If this energy had more oppor
tunity lor expression in such areas
as debate, student publications, dis
cussion groups, political societies,
and the like, Stanford's undergradu
ate life would seem considerably
less adolescent than it now does in
comparison with student life on such
campuses as Harvard, Princeton and
Yale.
The assumption prevails, I think,
that to be "active" is a virtue en
tirely apart from what the purpose
of that activity may be. I think this
is a dangerous fallacy. "Personal
adjustment" is an intellectual as well
as a social matter, and when the
pressures to be "active" cause the
student to live in an unrelieved
manic state and—for those who want
to learn—in a state of perpetual
frustration, then I think the ideal
of "personal adjustment" is having
a rough ride.
I suggest these things only because
I suspect that you as students want
something done about them. If so,
why not start the cutting now—
either with my list or one of your
own devising?

For a faculty member to speak
out about the nature and con
duct of Stanford's undergradu
ate social program may be con
sidered as improper from the
students' point of view and in
expedient from his own.

Aware of these dangers, I should
like to emphasize at the outset that
what I offer are only suggestions,
and that, aware of my own ignorance
about many phases of the under
graduate's life, I am only describing
the problem as it appears from the
teacher's side of the desk.
That problem is, briefly, this. Over
the past five years I have been in
creasingly impressed by the fact
that multitudes of students on this
campus have been genuinely op
pressed by the social demands upon
them to be "active," to serve on
committees, to keep their status with
the group. I have listened to in
numerable students who have felt
that the pressure to engage in "ac
tivities" was so intense that it be
came a genuine struggle to find time
to read or think—to say nothing of
finding an opportunity for that con
templation which all genuine learn
ing inevitably entails. These com
plaints have been so numerous and
insistent that I have come to suspect
that a mighty groundswell of dis
satisfaction prevails among the stu
dent body itself, and that it only
needs articulation for something to
be done about it. In no sense am I
trying to interfere in the students'
bailiwick, but if my observations
happen to coincide with popular
feeling, then perhaps they might be
regarded as constructive and not
just the wailings of a longhair.
In short, I think the social pro
gram must be curtailed if Stanford
is going to grow as an intellectual
institution. I suggest that the fol
lowing activities are eligible for
early treatment:
Hell Week. I think Hell Week
could be abolished or reduced—at
the most, to two days. The conflict
between this activity and a student's
studies is all too obvious, and in my
experience a great many students
expect the academic program to give.
Rally Com. I like football and am
all for a certain amount of rah-rah
stuff, but I think the physical and
intellectual labor spent on such
things as card stunts is entirely out
of proportion to the benefits re
ceived. Why not be a little less or
ganized, and take a chance that
natural high spirits and a good
cheering squad can provide enough
fanfare at a game to satisfy the most
jadsd alumnus? Rallies could, I
think, be limited to two to a quarter.
Floats. The money that is spent
on floats is one thing, and could be
used more usefully in buying books
for house or dormitory libraries, for
example. But the time spent on the
floats is even more important. Last
week literally hundreds of students
had no time for anything else, and
in some of the girls' houses the peiv
nicious practice of fining students for
non-cooperation is practiced. This is,
in my mind, immoral. If a student
is bored with floats, or wants to
study, that certainly is his privilege.
What's that about the winds of free
dom? Why not build one float? We
can't have Mardi gras every week,
but the fall social program suggests
that we're trying. And, in this con
nection—why can't Homecoming and
Big Game be made the same event?
Back-to-the-Furm Week. Except,
perhaps, for carrying the torch to

Rudy's, all other parts of this wilt
ing tradition could, I think, be
dropped. Games Day gets a laggard
response, and the Farm Follies were,
I gather, something less than satis
factory. Save a day, perhaps—but
why take a week?
These are just suggestions. You
take them from there. But, lest I
seem to be entirely negative, I'd like
to point out that I think many as
pects of the social program are good
and ought to be encouraged: ex

changes, house dances, intramural
athletics, etc. I have, too, been great
ly impressed with the work of cer
tain committees, .such as Pre Reg
Committee. But, nonetheless, there
is, in my opinion, an enormous
amount of useless "busywork" in
the average undergraduate's social
life. If this energy had more oppor
tunity lor expression in such areas
as debate, student publications, dis
cussion groups, political societies,
and the like, Stanford's undergradu
ate life would seem considerably
less adolescent than it now does in
comparison with student life on such
campuses as Harvard, Princeton and
Yale.
The assumption prevails, I think,
that to be "active" is a virtue en
tirely apart from what the purpose
of that activity may be. I think this
is a dangerous fallacy. "Personal
adjustment" is an intellectual as well
as a social matter, and when the
pressures to be "active" cause the
student to live in an unrelieved
manic state and—for those who want
to learn—in a state of perpetual
frustration, then I think the ideal
of "personal adjustment" is having
a rough ride.
I suggest these things only because
I suspect that you as students want
something done about them. If so,
why not start the cutting now—
either with my list or one of your
own devising?

For a faculty member to speak
out about the nature and con
duct of Stanford's undergradu
ate social program may be con
sidered as improper from the
students' point of view and in
expedient from his own.
