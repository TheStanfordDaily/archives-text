# Taylor Holds Long Workout; Valli, Harrington May See Duty
## 
### BOB MIEROW 
Coach Chuck Taylor sent his
gridders through one of the
longest and toughest practice
sessions of the year yesterday
as the Cards prepared for their
pigskin battle with Washington
Saturday.
Everybody on the varsity roster
was suited up for the workout, in
cluding backs Lou Valli and A 1 Har
rington and tackle Don Manoukia'n.
Harrington missed the UCLA con
test Saturday because of the flu and
has also been suffering from an in
jured ankle. Manoukian was on the
sidelines in Monday's practice be
cause of a stomach disorder.
The return of Valli was a happy
surprise to the Indian mentor. The
speedy sophomore halfback has seen
very little game action since the
COP season opener. He has had a
knee injury.
Carl Isaacs and John Brodie were
working with the first string in yes
terday's practice. Brodij? .played one
of the outstanding'gamits of his ca
ret r, completing 17 of 28 passes
against the Bruins last week. Isaacs,
who has been battling for a starting
berth all year, saw quite a bit of

action against UCLA.
Should this duo start against
Washington Saturday, it would mark
the first time this year that Taylor
has made a change in his opening
eleven. John Stewart has started
every game at left end this season,
with Jerry Gustafson at the quarter
back slot.
The impressive showing by Brodie
Saturday marked the first time this
year that he has duplicated the fine
passing performances which made
him the No. 4 aerial-thrower in the
nation last year.
The Cards began yesterday's
workout with passing patterns. Gus
tafson, Brodie, and Jack Douglas
were doing the throwing for the
varsity eleven.
CARDS SCRIMMAGE
Following a defensive workout,
the Indians were sent through a 40-
minute scrimmage. The drill was
ended by a series of wind sprints.
The scrimmage was held in the
muddy sectipn of the practice fieldâ€”
preparing for a possible rainy after
noon this Saturday. Southern Cali
fornia fell victim of the Huskies on
a wet field in Seattle two weeks
ago, 7-0.
Stanford is drilling on defense to
stop, the T formation which Johnny
Cherberg teaches at the northern
school. The Huskies feature a heavy
backfield, headed by quarterback
Steve Roake.
The Indians have been rather suc
cessful against T outfits this year,
having shut out Ohio State's vaunted
attack.
