A MISFIREâ€”UCLA fullback Doug Peters climbs high but can't
reach a pass thrown by tailback Gerry McDougall in the fourth
quarter of last Saturday's football game. Watching the pass go
awry are Bruin wingback Chuck Holla way (31) and end Tom
Adams (81). The Stanford defender on the play is halfback Jeri
McMillin (18). Coming up behind McMillin to aid him if neces
sary is Card end Gary Van Galder.
