# SAE's Crush Phi Sigs, 31-2, In Intramural Football Action
## 
### KERMIT OLSON 
A rather stepped-up SAE of
fense managed to score almost
at will to defeat the Phi Sigs,
31-2, yesterday afternoon.
The SAE's took the ball at the
outset of the game, and moved it
quickly 40 yards uptieid on a Ray
Young to Bernie Nelson aerial. Jack
Van Bergen took Young's next of
fering out of the end zone, but on
the next play Ray Williamson tallied
the six. Shortly after,' Young again
loosened his tossing arm, first hitting
Nelson and then Van Bergen for the
score. No conversions were made
on these scores. In the waning mo
ments of the half, the vaunted of

fense of the Phi Sigs began to roll,
only to be halted by the gun on the
SAE 20.
Shortly after the opening of the '
second half, Phi Sig Skip Hauge
came in hard to block a punt, which j
shoved the SAE's into their own end j
zone for a safety. After receiving
the kickofT, the optimistic Phi Sig
seven failed to kick on fourth down !
on their own 25, and a quick capi- I
talization on the mistake by Young
and Nelson and an added point made
the score 19-2. At this point, the
SAE's switched wingback Bobby
Dwight to tailback, and lost nothing
by the move as he quickly flipped |
two scoring tosses â€”one to Nelson I
and the other to Young.
