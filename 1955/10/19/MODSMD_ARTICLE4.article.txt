# Educational Role of TV Discussed
## KQED Official Predicts Growth 
### SALLY TRAPNELL 
"One of educational televi
sion's most important future
roles may be as an answer to the
tidal wave of students which
will hit American universities in
the next 10 years," said James
Day, general manager of KQED,
San Francisco, in his speech at
the Tuesday Series last night.
According to Day, studies have
shown no difference in course grades
obtained by college students who
have heard lectures in classrooms
and those who have seen them over
TV. Television would also permit a
more effective use of present facul
ties, giving them more time for sem
inar and individual work.
"Another use of TV in education,"
he said, "would be to give two years
of college work for non-professional
students, and spread the rest out
over their lifetime through adult
education TV courses."
FUTURE PROGRAMS
Day added that studies are being
conducted in San Francisco now on
two subjects for future TV educa
tional programs. The first is on what
portion of lower - division college
work can be televised. The other is
to find out what TV courses would
be necessary to allow a teacher
turned-housewife to qualify for re
certification.
"Educational television is in an
experimental stage," stressed Day.
KQED did not start broadcasting
until 1954.
NOT COMMERCIAL
'"Our goal is not to compete with
commercial television. . . . We want
to reach, not one audience, but
many," Day said. "KQED wants to
provide viewers with the things that
make us individuals, such as special
interests and hobbies."
KQED is already presenting pro
grams in five fields — constructive
children's programs, adult education
courses, lectures by great teachers,
art and music, and community af
fairs .programs.
Day says that one of his next proj
ects is to increase reading through
television by presenting reading im
provement and book review pro
grams.
COMMUNITY AFFAIRS
Day considers that one of the most
interesting phases of future educa
tional television to be in the field of
community affairs. He feels that
television could help develop com
munication between- the Bay Area
communities. He would like to put
on a monthly examination of some
civic problem such as smog, traffic,
or business decentralization.

"Another use of TV in education,"
he said, "would be to give two years
of college work for non-professional
students, and spread the rest out
over their lifetime through adult
education TV courses."
FUTURE PROGRAMS
Day added that studies are being
conducted in San Francisco now on
two subjects for future TV educa
tional programs. The first is on what
portion of lower - division college
work can be televised. The other is
to find out what TV courses would
be necessary to allow a teacher
turned-housewife to qualify for re
certification.
"Educational television is in an
experimental stage," stressed Day.
KQED did not start broadcasting
until 1954.
NOT COMMERCIAL
'"Our goal is not to compete with
commercial television. . . . We want
to reach, not one audience, but
many," Day said. "KQED wants to
provide viewers with the things that
make us individuals, such as special
interests and hobbies."
KQED is already presenting pro
grams in five fields — constructive
children's programs, adult education
courses, lectures by great teachers,
art and music, and community af
fairs .programs.
Day says that one of his next proj
ects is to increase reading through
television by presenting reading im
provement and book review pro
grams.
COMMUNITY AFFAIRS
Day considers that one of the most
interesting phases of future educa
tional television to be in the field of
community affairs. He feels that
television could help develop com
munication between- the Bay Area
communities. He would like to put
on a monthly examination of some
civic problem such as smog, traffic,
or business decentralization.
