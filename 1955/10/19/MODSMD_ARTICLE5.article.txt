## French Crisis Avoided, Faure Still in Office 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 18 (UP) —Premier
Edgar Faure won a crucial con
fidence vote in the National As
sembly tonight, sparing France
a government crisis that would
have threatened her internation
al prestige.
The Assembly, by an official count
of 1308 to 254, approved Faure's poli
cies in Algeria and decided to keep
him in office.
The Radical Socialist premier had
staked the life of his government on
the vote—his first formal confidence
(est since he succeeded Pierre Men
des-France eight months ago.
In voting confidence the Assembly

also approved Faure's action in pull
ing the French delegation out of the
United Nations over the issue of
Algeria.
The premier specifically asked for
approval of the UN move in a speech
pleading for support just before the
confidence vote. ,
Faure won out over an opposition
that included both extreme Right
and Left wing Deputies, critical of
his policies in rebel-threatened
North Africa.
In his speech to a generally listless
Assembly, Faure explained his pol
icy of "integrating" Algeria with
France under a program of econom
ic, social and political reforms for
the vital North African territory.
