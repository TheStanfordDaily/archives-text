# Demand Continues For Federal Flood Control

### 
HARTFORD, Conn.â€”The cry for
a Federal Hood insurance program
grew louder in twice-stricken north
eastern states today with a three
strikes-out warning from all sides.
The demands for congressional ac
tion extended from a member of the
Eisenhower Administration down to
officials of the affected towns and
cities.
First proposed by U.S. Rep. Thom
as J. Dodd (D-Conn.) after the Aug.
19 disaster, it was estimated that a
Federal flood insurance program
would cost about $.'lOO million.
Meanwhile, with a seven-state toll
of 49 dead or missing, the job of
cleaning up the monumental mess
and unsnarling traffic congestion has
moved into high gear.
Connecticut, which suffered most
in the Aug. 19 floods, also got. the
worst of the week-end land and sea
storm assault.
