# Theta Xi Charged with Rule Violation, Seeks IFC Reconsideration of Penalty
## Council Sets Down 'Hell Week' Punishment at Special Meeting 
### 
Theta Xi fraternity is currently appealing an Interfraternity
Council decision penalizing the house lor violating the IFC's "Hell
Week" regulations.
IFC's judicial committee handed down its decision in a special
meeting Thursday. The punishment is reported to be a restriction
of rushing privileges. The exact pen- ,
alty has not been announced.

According to IFC President Ron
Wagner, Delta Tau Delta, the ju
dicial committee will reconsider the
case as soon as possible—probably
today.
"It still is an open question about
what the result is going to be," Dean
ot Students H. Donald Winbigler
said last night. Winbigler said the
implications of the case encompass
all 24 of Stanford's fraternities, and
thus the problem cannot be solved
by considering the Theta Xi case
alone.
Gordon Best, Theta Xi president,
said yesterday:"The whole incident
is an example of a problem that con
fronts all fraternities. The circum
stances that resulted in our difficulty
are just a part of a widespread situ
ation."
VIOLATIONS
The Theta Xi's have been accused
of violating the rushing regulations
on four counts, according to a house
spokesman.
The most important charge is that
they have brought disrepute and un
favorable publicity to the fraternity
and to the University. The complaint
is said to have been registered by
an off-campus person not directly
connected with the University.
The fraternity rushing rules state:
"Each fraternity shall conduct its
initiation practices in such a way as
to bring no unfavorable publicity,
either to itself or to Stanford's Fra
ternity System as a whole."
FAILURE TO REGISTER
Other alleged Theta Xi violations
are failure to register the "Hell
Week" with the Dean of Men's office,
failing to inform the IFC of the
nature of the hazing, and allowing
some elements of the hazing to
spread off the grounds of the house.
Pledges wore Davy Crockett coon
skin hats on Quad during the week.
The Theta Xi's reportedly feel that
the penalty set down by the IFC
judicial committee is too severe, and
have been in the process of appeal
ing the verdict since last week.
Winbigler has been working close
ly with the fraternity and the IFC.
But he said, "It is not anything that
I, as dean of students, can take offi
cial part in." It is a matter for the
IFC to handle, he said,
APPEAL DELAYED
Theta Xi had delayed its appeal
until a discussion could be held with
Winbigler. The dean was out of town
over the week end; he returned yes
terday. He met with a group of
Theta Xi's last night.
Winbigler was unhappy that the
problem has remained in an un
settled state for so long. He hopes
that it will not be drawn out much
longer.
The IFC judicial council, which
will rehear the case, is composed of
seven voting and one ex - officio
members. Members include Wagner
as president; Eck von Estorff, Delta
Upsilon, as secretary; John Hen
drickson, Sigma Chi, president of
the House Managers Association;
John Shields, Alpha Kappa Lambda,
head resident assistant; Pete Scott,
Sigma Nu; Eric Wittenberg, Zeta
Psi. Dean of Men William G. Craig
is the ex-officio member.
The IFC took over disciplinary
control of the fraternities officially
last year, after an ASSU constitu
tional referendum. Last spring the
IFC placed the entire judicial power
in the hands of a new eight-man
committee.

IFC placed the entire judicial power
in the hands of a new eight-man
committee.


THE THETA XI HOUSE ON UPPER ROW


RON WAGNER
Theta Xi fraternity is currently appealing an Interfraternity
Council decision penalizing the house lor violating the IFC's "Hell
Week" regulations.
IFC's judicial committee handed down its decision in a special
meeting Thursday. The punishment is reported to be a restriction
of rushing privileges. The exact pen- ,
alty has not been announced.

According to IFC President Ron
Wagner, Delta Tau Delta, the ju
dicial committee will reconsider the
case as soon as possible—probably
today.
"It still is an open question about
what the result is going to be," Dean
ot Students H. Donald Winbigler
said last night. Winbigler said the
implications of the case encompass
all 24 of Stanford's fraternities, and
thus the problem cannot be solved
by considering the Theta Xi case
alone.
Gordon Best, Theta Xi president,
said yesterday:"The whole incident
is an example of a problem that con
fronts all fraternities. The circum
stances that resulted in our difficulty
are just a part of a widespread situ
ation."
VIOLATIONS
The Theta Xi's have been accused
of violating the rushing regulations
on four counts, according to a house
spokesman.
The most important charge is that
they have brought disrepute and un
favorable publicity to the fraternity
and to the University. The complaint
is said to have been registered by
an off-campus person not directly
connected with the University.
The fraternity rushing rules state:
"Each fraternity shall conduct its
initiation practices in such a way as
to bring no unfavorable publicity,
either to itself or to Stanford's Fra
ternity System as a whole."
FAILURE TO REGISTER
Other alleged Theta Xi violations
are failure to register the "Hell
Week" with the Dean of Men's office,
failing to inform the IFC of the
nature of the hazing, and allowing
some elements of the hazing to
spread off the grounds of the house.
Pledges wore Davy Crockett coon
skin hats on Quad during the week.
The Theta Xi's reportedly feel that
the penalty set down by the IFC
judicial committee is too severe, and
have been in the process of appeal
ing the verdict since last week.
Winbigler has been working close
ly with the fraternity and the IFC.
But he said, "It is not anything that
I, as dean of students, can take offi
cial part in." It is a matter for the
IFC to handle, he said,
APPEAL DELAYED
Theta Xi had delayed its appeal
until a discussion could be held with
Winbigler. The dean was out of town
over the week end; he returned yes
terday. He met with a group of
Theta Xi's last night.
Winbigler was unhappy that the
problem has remained in an un
settled state for so long. He hopes
that it will not be drawn out much
longer.
The IFC judicial council, which
will rehear the case, is composed of
seven voting and one ex - officio
members. Members include Wagner
as president; Eck von Estorff, Delta
Upsilon, as secretary; John Hen
drickson, Sigma Chi, president of
the House Managers Association;
John Shields, Alpha Kappa Lambda,
head resident assistant; Pete Scott,
Sigma Nu; Eric Wittenberg, Zeta
Psi. Dean of Men William G. Craig
is the ex-officio member.
The IFC took over disciplinary
control of the fraternities officially
last year, after an ASSU constitu
tional referendum. Last spring the
IFC placed the entire judicial power
in the hands of a new eight-man
committee.
