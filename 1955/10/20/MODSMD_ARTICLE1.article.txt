Institute, acting in the absence of

of the Belgians, on a nation-wide
educational tour, will visit Stanford
in recognition of the warm feeling
existing between his country and

Library, who administered Belgian
relief work after World War I.
After a trip to the top of the tower
Prince Albert will visit with Belgian
students at Stanford and examine a
display of materials from Hoover
Library and Commission for Relief
in Belgium Archives.
Before walking across Quad with
Rothwell and Chaplain Robert M.
Minto to see Memorial Church, he
will attend an informal faculty re
ception in the Lou Henry Room of
the library.
He will leave at 12:15 for a lunch
eon in Hillsborough.

touring the United States as a part
of his education as a naval officer.

and, having graduated from college
in 1954, recently gained the rank of
lieutenant.
The prince has devoted time and
study to the development of a mer
chant marine, which Belgium has
not had in the past.


HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS—Prince Albert of Belgium, shown in
his uniform of lieutenant in the Belgian navy, will visit the cam
pus today in recognition of the friendly relations between his
country and Stanford.


BELLS, BELLS, BELLS—The carillon atop Hoover Tower will
peal today in honor of the visit of Prince Albert of Belgium,
whose country presented the bells to Stanford in 1941.
