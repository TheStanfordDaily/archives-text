# 3 ASSU Nominees Decline Candidacy
## 
### 
Three candidates in next week's
ASSU elections have withdrawn
their nominations.
Steve Conley and Wally Cummins,
entered as candidates for Wilbur
representative to the legislature, and
Carol McCarthy, nominated as Roble
representative, have declined to run.
Expense accounts are due from
the candidates tomorrow.
Individual pictures of the office
seekers are to be submitted at the
ASSU office for use in an election
display designed to prevent mix-ups
in identifying the entrants.
