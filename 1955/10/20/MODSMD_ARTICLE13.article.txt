## Theta Xi 'Hell Week' Draws No-Rushing Edict IFC Judicial Body Finds House Guilty on 2 Counts 
### 
Theta Xi fraternity was denied rushing privileges until at lcaut
spring quarter in a dacision announced last night by the Inter
lraternity Council's judicial committee.
Theta Xi had been found guilty last week of violating the IFC
initiation code during its "Hell Week" activities early in the guar-

ter. An appeal by the house brought i
no change in the penalty.
Bob Atwell, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
chairman of the seven-man IFC ju
dicial committee, announced the de
cision: "The penalty is a loss of
rushing privileges for the remainder
of the school year with the under
standing that the decision will be re
viewed at the beginning of spring
quarter and at that time the penalty
may be suspended."
Atwell said the principal charge
brought against the house was con
ducting its "Hell Week" in such a
manner as to bring the house and
the fraternity into disrepute.
OFFICIAL STATEMENT
Atwell's official statement says that
the penalty was based upon "the
conduct of informal initiation activi
ties within the house which are not
in accordance with the standards of
the University and which brought
discredit to the University."
Theta Xi also violated "the ban in
the IFC code on informal initiation
practices held off the house and
grounds of the fraternity."
Wearing of Davy Crockett coon
skin hats on Quad was the flagrant
violation of the "house and grounds"
restriction.
Atwell said, "The case uncovered
a definite problem within the whole
fraternity system. The extent of the
problem is unknown as yet." Atwell
indicated that his group would rec
ommend that the IFC explore the
entire "Hell Week" problem.
'WIDESPREAD SITUATION'
Gordon Best, Theta Xi president,
had said earlier that "The whole in
cident is an example of a problem
that confronts all fraternities. The
circumstances that resulted in our
difficulty are just a part of a wide
spread situation."
Best refused to comment on the
final decision last night.
The Theta Xi's appealed the de
cision because they felt the penalty

was unjust and would leave the
house as "deadwood" in the frater
nity system.
Atwell said last night that lie
thought the house could overcome
the disadvantages of missing formal
rushing in winter quarter, assuming
the IFC suspends the sentence in
spring quarter.
THETA XI PROPOSAL
He said that the committee saw ;i
lot of merit in a proposal for all fra
ternities advanced by Theta Xi last,
night when the sentence was re
viewed.
"We were thinking along the same
lines," Atwell said. "A combination
of the ideas will make the 'Hell
Week' system as a whole much bel
ter."
Atwell said that his committee
spent at least half its time discuss
ing the Theta Xi case's implications
on the rest of the fraternities.
The complaint was brought against
the house by an off-campus person
not connected with the University.
Atwell refused to elaborate on the
person's identity or the exact charges
listed. He did say that the charges
were substantiated.
COMMITTEE MEMBERS
The members of the judicial com -
mittee which heard the case include
Atwell; Ron Wagner, IFC president;
Eck von Estorff, IFC secretary; John
Hendricks, president of the House
Managers Association; John Shields,
head resident assistant; Eric Witten
berg, IFC; and Pete Scott, IFC.
The judicial committee has disci
plinary and judicial authority over
the 24 fraternities. The committee
was set up by IFC last year.
A constitutional referendum last
year had conferred these powers on
the IFC. Previously an Interfrater
nity Board of Control, composed of
faculty, alumni and students, held
the power.
Atwell said last night that he was,
pleased with the way his com mi tj.ee
had handled the situation.

JUDICIAL BODY—Four members of the IFC judicial committee
discuss the Theta Xi "Hell Week" case last night. From left
are Eck vonEstorff, IFC secretary; Ron Wagner, IFC president;
Bob Atwell, judicial committee chairman; and Eric Wittenberg,
an elected member.
Theta Xi fraternity was denied rushing privileges until at lcaut
spring quarter in a dacision announced last night by the Inter
lraternity Council's judicial committee.
Theta Xi had been found guilty last week of violating the IFC
initiation code during its "Hell Week" activities early in the guar-

ter. An appeal by the house brought i
no change in the penalty.
Bob Atwell, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
chairman of the seven-man IFC ju
dicial committee, announced the de
cision: "The penalty is a loss of
rushing privileges for the remainder
of the school year with the under
standing that the decision will be re
viewed at the beginning of spring
quarter and at that time the penalty
may be suspended."
Atwell said the principal charge
brought against the house was con
ducting its "Hell Week" in such a
manner as to bring the house and
the fraternity into disrepute.
OFFICIAL STATEMENT
Atwell's official statement says that
the penalty was based upon "the
conduct of informal initiation activi
ties within the house which are not
in accordance with the standards of
the University and which brought
discredit to the University."
Theta Xi also violated "the ban in
the IFC code on informal initiation
practices held off the house and
grounds of the fraternity."
Wearing of Davy Crockett coon
skin hats on Quad was the flagrant
violation of the "house and grounds"
restriction.
Atwell said, "The case uncovered
a definite problem within the whole
fraternity system. The extent of the
problem is unknown as yet." Atwell
indicated that his group would rec
ommend that the IFC explore the
entire "Hell Week" problem.
'WIDESPREAD SITUATION'
Gordon Best, Theta Xi president,
had said earlier that "The whole in
cident is an example of a problem
that confronts all fraternities. The
circumstances that resulted in our
difficulty are just a part of a wide
spread situation."
Best refused to comment on the
final decision last night.
The Theta Xi's appealed the de
cision because they felt the penalty

was unjust and would leave the
house as "deadwood" in the frater
nity system.
Atwell said last night that lie
thought the house could overcome
the disadvantages of missing formal
rushing in winter quarter, assuming
the IFC suspends the sentence in
spring quarter.
THETA XI PROPOSAL
He said that the committee saw ;i
lot of merit in a proposal for all fra
ternities advanced by Theta Xi last,
night when the sentence was re
viewed.
"We were thinking along the same
lines," Atwell said. "A combination
of the ideas will make the 'Hell
Week' system as a whole much bel
ter."
Atwell said that his committee
spent at least half its time discuss
ing the Theta Xi case's implications
on the rest of the fraternities.
The complaint was brought against
the house by an off-campus person
not connected with the University.
Atwell refused to elaborate on the
person's identity or the exact charges
listed. He did say that the charges
were substantiated.
