## 
### DICK MEISTER Associate Editor, The Daily

more failed to reach a clear-cut
decision on the Axe Society
Handbook question.
After extended debate on whether

campus activities—how many copies
should be distributed, and to whom
they should be given, President
George Ralph brought down his
gavel: "Tabled!"
LASSU and last year's student
governing body, Excom, have been
debating this issue since before the
past summer vacation.

Retiring Vice - President Jerry
Fitzgerald described ASSU social
procedures as being "bogged down
in a minutiae of detail" in giving
proposals to revamp Stanford's social
set-up.
Legislature resolved to send a let
ter to the Athletic department asking
their aid in sending the head cheer
