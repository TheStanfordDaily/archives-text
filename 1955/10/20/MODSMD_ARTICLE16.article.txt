WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 (UP)
The Defense Department to
day made public long - secret
documents stating that Gen.
Douglas IVfacArthur wanted Rus
sia brought into the war against
fapan as late as 15 days after the
i Yalta Conference.
Defense officials said, however,
that the 40,000-word report did not
conclusively settle the question of
Mac Arthur's views on Russian entry
in the Pacific war.
The newly released defense doeu
j merits showed that in early 1045
American military planners had
! reached the conclusion that Russian
| entry into the war no longer was
I needed to make an invasion of Japan
I successful.

But they did feel it would cut
down U.S. casualties. Mac Arthur
apparently shared this view.
However, Col. Paul A. Freeman,
Army staff officer, interviewed Mac-
Arthur on Feb. 13, 1945. three days
after the Yalta Conference. In his
summary of the conversation, Free
man said Mac Arthur "emphatically
stated that we must not invade
Japan proper unless the Russian
army is previously committed to ac
tion in Manchuria."
Freeman said Mac Arthur "under
stands Russia's aims—that they want
all of Manchuria, Korea, and pos
sibly part of North China." He said
the general felt "this seizure of ter
ritory was inevitable but that the
United States must insist Russia
"pay her way" by invading Man
churia.
