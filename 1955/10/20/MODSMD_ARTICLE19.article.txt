### 
UNITED NATIONS. NY. â€” The
United States succeeded today in
keeping alive the Philippines'
chances for a United Nations Secu
rity Council seat.
The Soviet bloc attempted through
a filibuster to delay United Nations
General Assembly procedures until
the fiO-nation group would suspend
today's session.
The British Commonwealth coun
tries, Benelux and Scandinavian na
tions opposed the U.S. parliamen
tary maneuver in roll call votes.
But, after four votes, the U.S.
succeeded in having the deadlocked
1 Security Council race between the
Philippines and Yugoslavia post
j poned while elections were held for
: the Economic and Social Council and
| the Trusteeship Council.
