# Wayward Owl Finds Museum Culture Deadly
## 
### 
A large barn owl with a thirst for
culture met with & violent end yes
terday in the Stanford Museum.
When Mrs. Helen Churchill, Mu
seum secretary, arrived at work yes
terday morning, she found a note
from the janitor advising her that
an owl was loose in the building.
She looked toward the skylightâ€”and
there he was, batting his head
against the glass panes.
Mrs. Churchill called the Corp
Yard for assistance after effort to
coax the bird through the front door
had failed. The University handy
men were able to do no better with
peaceable means.
Corp Yard artilleryman Sarge V.in
Osten responded to the situation
with military aplomb. Filling the
owl's feathered head with shot from
a .22-caliber rifle, he dispatched the
big bird to a happier land.
