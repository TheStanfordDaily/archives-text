category 2b
To the Editor:
Thi is 11 open lettei to Athletic Director Alfred 1'.
Masters:
Pcrli; p as The Daily suggests, it is time for the
Athleth- Department to reconsider its policy. Regard
in:.' your U tter, the cheer leader and Prince Lightfoot
were not mentioned in any of the four categories,
ixcept if. in addition to their time, they desire to take
an extra $50 or so out of their own pocket. Even then
they are riot assured of a chance to fly.
Ht garding the inclusion of newspaper men on the
plane (category 2), 1 realize that this is a necessity,
we always get wonderful publicity in the papers.
C';11, in not winning, seems to get better publicity even
thou 'h we may win eveiy game. Perhaps, however,
th' team may find that a yell leader or Prince Light
loot would he oi more value during a game. It also
make-; a difference to the spectators. As for cate
gory 3, the selling of tickets to anyone who wants to
I my tin l, may he 1 am naive, Mr. Masters, but aren't
there >ome things that come before money?
1 might suggest, Mr. Masters, that it is time for a
category 2B to be added, including Prince Lightfoot
aod the head cheer leader. Also the manager for
trips to Hawaii (if my memory serves me right—or
was that our basketball team?). I think also in cate
gory 2 for the press that the Daily sports editor
■ h mid be included with a top priority. He is the
i-pr. tentative of Stanford University and the student
body.
Maybe 1 am out of line, and my thinking is behind
tin times. If this is the day of professional football at
Stanford, then buy some more talent. If it is not, then
pive a little of the game back to the student body.
I think that there is room for improvement either
way.
Mr. Masters, in my opinion and that of others, your
letter was unsatisfactory. Further clarification is
w. nled and needed.

To the Editor:
I should like to call your attention to an error in
Tuesday's Daily, regarding my comments on the
A.SSU Political Union.
In my report as 1954-55 Student Financial Manager,
I did NOT say that "the Poli Union might be con
sidered 'one of the multitudinous and driveling' or
ganizations on campus." I first heard the phrase
"multitudinous driveling committee" last spring when
one of the candidates for student body president im
plied that the ASSU structure was made up of such
nroups. I borrowed the phrase from that campaign.
However, during the campaign and later when I
wrote the report, I firmly believed that the ASSU
supported NO "multitudinous |or| driveling" com
mittees!
In the report I stated that, in my opinion. "It [the
Political Union| is the closest thing we now have to
a "multitudinous driveling committee.' However, no
one can deny the need for student interest in political
affairs of the United States and of the world. A po
litical union is a definite need on the Stanford cam-

pus. I believe; but our present Union . . . |must|
yrouse student interest and grass-roots activity."
1 might add that this is exactly what they are now
trying u> do, and I wish them good luck in ovcrcom- ,
ing some growing pains.

thanks, team
To the Editor:
So I'm a frogh, see, and I'm sitting in the card sec- j
tion at the UCLA game all set to yell my head off.
And then UCLA scored 21 points like it was Mills
College they were playing.
St) 1 get real down on the team and am looking lor
bets from the guys around me. I'm saying it'll be 60-0
by half-time and 80-0 by the end of the game, if
anyone is waiting around to count.
And I quit yelling my head oft'. Right then and
there 1 was coming up with some real dandies—like,
"Hey, Taylor, send in the bench, maybe it can score
a TD," and "Whattaya mean. Big Red? I'll take the
little red school house." Boy. I was funny.
Then the second half starts and the footballers start
to shove it down UCLA's throat. Our team scored.
The other fellas began to look at me sheepish-like.
And I was feeling a little yellow at the gills, too.
And then our fellows scored again. And started
racing the clock to get down the field for another.
By this time I was screaming ... 1 was yelling for
the Big Red ... I was cheering for the team. . . .
And when the gun cracked that heart-wrenching
finish, I am like all the other fellas around me who
were pounding each other's backs—praising to the
skies our wonderful Stanford team.
For at that moment we had all learned the lysson—
the lesson of all time —we had picked up in a scant
half-hour what it is to never give up—learned what
it was to have honor and consideration for our lei- j
low-fellows.
Thanks so much, team—for righting a frosh in such !
a hurry. It is a lesson which will stay with me |
through life.

To the Editor:
As members of the universally sober and indus
trious Stanford graduate student body, we are dis
mayed to see 011!' graduate class president, Hugh L.
Smith, cited for "drunk and reckless driving" as
reported in yesterday's Daily.
While we sympathize with Mr. Smith in his pres
ent difficulties, knowing as we do that he was led
astray not so much by a craving for the fiery waters
as by his sociable nature and his liking for the com
panionship and harmony of male voices to be found
in many local establishments, nonetheless in these
days of preoccupation with problems of corruption in
high places we must demand a higher standard of
conduct of our democratically elected officials.
Before Mr. Smith again "inexplicably crosses the
white line," smashing four parked cars, we hope that j
he will take thought of the invisible white line of !
good conduct which the Fundamental Standard im- j
poses upon all of us and especially upon the officers j
of our student government.
