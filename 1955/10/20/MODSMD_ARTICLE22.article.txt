It may seem paradoxical to many students
that Senator William Knowland, oft-times an
acrid critic of the United Nations, is scheduled
to speak here on American foreign policy this
Monday—a day specifically set aside to com
memorate the U.N., its past endeavors, and its
future hopes.
Yet this immediately brings to mind two
very vital, pertinent issues:
(1) the inter-relation of American foreign
policy with the avowed goals of the U.N., to
maintain peace and security for all peoples;
„ (2) and the problems the U.S. faces in her
position of leadership in a world still struggling
under an East-West ideological split, but yet
brightened by an apparent easing of the cold
war tensions.
Many critics of American participation in the
U.N. point disapprovingly at the fact that the
U.S. contributes at least one-third of the U.N.'s
annual budget, approximately SB9 million in
1354.
Yet this amounts to approximately one-tenth
of one per cent of our national budget, 75 per
cent of which goes toward paying for past wars
and arming ourselves in case of future ones.
Including all voluntary relief and technical
assistance programs, the U.N. asks only 55
cents a year from each citizen.
In addition to the ever-increasing problem of
financing relief and technical assistance pro
grams, sticky political problems have been
thrust into the lap of the 10-year-old interna
tional body.
Thorny problems arising from recent bloody
bursts of nationalism, notably in the Near East,
North Africa, and Cyprus, are especially vex
ing to American foreign policy experts as well
as to U.N. officials.
We are bound to-the protection of our NATO
allies, but we unfortunately appear to* many
people to have fotsaken our traditional prin
ciple of self-determination for all nations.

We were duly embarrassed when our policy i
of sending arms to Israel .backfired with the
Arabs' acceptance of military aid from a Com-1
munist country.
Unless great diligence is used, an arms race
in the Middle East may occur.
The nationalist groups also charge that the
U.S. violated her principle of free discussion
when she voted in the U.N. against a plan to
consider the French-Algerian situation backed
by Arab delegates.
We thus find ourselves striving for middle
ground somewhere between expediency and
principle.
The number one question facing the U.S. and
the free world is, of course, are the Russian
smiles backed by sincerity or sneers.
Most American officials realize that we can
not afford to disregard the recent overtures of
friendship, but are also aware that they are j
not always to be taken at face value.
In any case, Russia may have us in a hot
diplomatic spot. If we slap her outstretched
hand, we have walked into the hands of her
propaganda manipulators.
If we blindly begin disarming ourselves and
our allies without mutual actions on the other |
side of the Iron Curtain, the dangers are
equally great.
NATO leaders are already attacking Great
Britain's projected armament slash of 100.000
troops by 1958 and French withdrawal of troops
from NATO legions to fight in North Africa as
contrary to the purposes of NATO and not jus
tified in view of current unsolved international
problems.
Warning that the U.S. must employ co-oper
ation as well as leadership within and without
the U.N., most American observers agree that
future Soviet actions must be viewed with
acuteness and broadmindedness that have not
always been employed in the past.
