# British Scholar: 'No Political Interest Here'
## 
### GERRY SMITH 
"The British Labor party is
definitely in the doldrums al
the moment," Peter Mackr.n,
ASSU foreign scholar from Eng
land, commented recently.
"The party lacks leadership and
inspiration. The Conservatives are
riding on the crest of an economic
wave" and making the most of it,
the red-headed Briton continued.
His sympathies lie with the Labor
ites.
Turning to the future of England
as a world power, Macken feels that
England has a definite role, "not so
much in terms of military and eco
nomic strength, but in terms of her
long experience as an industrial na
tion and a colonial power."

Macken, who has attended the i
London School of Economies for 1
thre-s years, plans to enter either j
the civil service or business after he !
completes his education. This quar
ter he is living at the Phi Delt house. '
Although his home is now in Lon- |
don, the 24 - year - old Briton has
travel sd a great deal. He was born
in Malta and has spent a year in
North Ireland, two years in Egypt,
and six years in South Africa.
When questioned about the South !
African problem, he said he thinks I
that "South African nationalists cor
rectly diagnose the problem a.s being
a question of whether there IS a
future for white people in Africa.
But their conclusion that there is a
future is wrong for most of Africa."
Noting that white control can con- ]
tinue for a long time in the Union

I of South Africa, he said: "It sort of
| frightens me, because what 1 can j
| visualize for the future is either a
bloody uprising or indefinite con
| tinuance of the present repressive j
policy. And I don't want to see this
I happen- I like South Africa."
With a smile, he changed the con
j versation to lighter topicsâ€”his im- 1
pressions of Stanford and the United
j States in general.
He likes America's football games,
scenic beauty, folk music, and the
variety of men's clothing styles very
! much. He also noticed the friendli
! ness of both students and those out
s.ide the University.
Discussing Stanford itself, Macken
commented on the wonderful fa
cilities both for research and. for
being a part of the University by
! actually living on campus. "Student

faculty relations are much superior
to my own school in England," he
said.
"American students take grades
and aLudies seriously," Macken went
on. "But I miss the atmosphere ol
intense political discussion I was
accustomed to in England. The stu
dents here lack both geographical
perception and political interest.
"The Stanford student is an iso
lationist, lacking interest in current
affairs," he concluded. "Often all he
can ask the representative of a for
eign nation is, 'Do you like orange
juice?'"
