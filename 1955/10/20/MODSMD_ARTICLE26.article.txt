# Ray Lunny Has Long Fight Experience; Now Coaches Card Boxers for Matches
## 
### JIM BAKER 
It was 1940. The young light
weight was battering his oppo
nent in a main-eventer at the
Oakland Auditorium. The
crowd was yelling, and his op
ponent was in bad shape, when
suddenly the ring was plunged
into dark less.
Someone had pulled the main light
switch, and by the time the lights
were turned on again, the young
fighter's opponent had rested and
was fresh again.
The young fighter quickly regained
control of his opponent and won on
a TKO four rounds later.
An unusual incident? Perhaps to
some, but just another of the many
happenings which mark the colorful
ring career of Card boxing coach
Ray Lunny.
"I have some idea that gamblers
pulled the light switch," Lunny says
confidentially but with a slight smile,
when talking of this particular
match.
STARTED I ROM UK,II SCHOOL
Right after graduation from Com
merce High School in San Francisco,
Lunny began his professional career.
He had won an 118 - pound class
Golden Gloves championship in 1936.
His first professional fight was in the
Hollywood Legion in Los Angeles.
He won it, and from there on until
1942 it was one victory after another
up and down the coast, the Bay Area
and Los Angeles being the main
stops.
It soon became apparent that Lun
ny was one of the best. From his
first bout in the Legion stadium he
went undefeated until his 35th fight!

In 1941 Lunny was ranked third
internationally, and his managers—
Joey Fox and Dutch Myers—sched
uled a fight with world feather
weight champion Chalky Wright.
Wright stung Lunny with his first
loss, capturing a 10-round decision.
But it wasn't a heartbreaker all the
way—Lunny pocketed $3,000 for the
bout.
Lunny continued to box 15 more
times, losing only three, and cli
maxed his spectacular career with
a record of 44 victories, two draws
and four defeats.
INTERRUPTED BY WAR
Lunny's prominence was at its
peak when he entered the service.
He fought professionally three times
while enlisted, but his hands started
giving him trouble and he finally
had to retire.
After the war Lunny entered the
real estate business, but shortly was
back on the other side of the rope.-,—
as a coach.
This year will be the ninth year
that Lunny has been boxing coach
at Stanford. His biggest thrill came
when he coached Bob Baldocchi to
the Pacific Intercollegiate light
heavy weight championship two years
ago. Lunny rates this "my most
gratifying experience."
Bespectacled Lunny, who is in his
early thirties, is the father of an 11-
year-old daughter, Carney Ann, and
a 4 - year - old son, Raymond 111.
Lunny has this to gay of boxing:
"I wouldn't want my son to be a
professional boxer, but I don't ob
ject to boxing in college. Amateur
boxing is all right. But professional
. . . it's a strange business.
"You can be good and make no
money, and be poor and make lots
of money. Purses depend on your
ability as a drawing card. Some guys
have a pleasing style and catch on
with the public. It's just like show
business."
Lunny praised the Stanford fa
cilities for boxing, and said, "Stan
ford has always had fine individual
boxers, but has been weak as a

team." Lunny blames this on lack
of student interest in the sport.
The coach rates this year's team
as "fair," with Bob Birkie, top
heavyweight, heading the list of re
turnees.
