# Prothro Is Hinted As Replacement For Pappy Waldorf
## 
### 
Tommy Prothro, Oregon State's
new coach who has done wonders
with the usually impotent Baavers,
may be headed for Berkeley.
In an v exclusive story in the Cor
v a 1 1 is Guardian-Times yesterday,
sports editor Chris Kowitz said he
had it on good authority that the
Southern Seas, the potent California
alumni group in Los Angeles, were
out to get Prothro in to replace Lynn
"Pappy" Waldorf as head coach.
He said that the Southern Seas
hoped to push Waldorf upstairs into
the job of athletic director, vacated
when Brutus Hamilton quit earlier
this fall.
Waldorf came to Cal in 1947 after
Cal had won only two games the
season before. He coached them to
a 9-1 season that year, losing only
to the PCC champs, USC.
In the following three seasons the
Bears went to the Rose Bowl three
times. They had only one blot on
their regular season record. That
was a 7-7 tie with Stanford in 1950.
Cal lost two games in 1951 and
has gone down hill slowly since then.
This season the Bears have won only
one game—a 27-7 win over inept
Pennsylvania. They have also tied
Washington State 20-20. And the
Bears could easily lose all the re
maining games on their schedule.
The Daily Cal, student newspaper
at UC, has had a series of articles
blasting the team for lethargy after
their 0-21 loss to Oregon, but has
emphasized that they have no criti
cism of Waldorf.
