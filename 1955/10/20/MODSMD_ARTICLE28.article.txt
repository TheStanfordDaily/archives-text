SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 19 (U.R)â€”
Washington Coach Johnny Cherberg
has moved halfback Creclell Green
and lineman Ed Sheron, both able
reserves in the past, up to varsity
positions.
Sheron, a 210-pounxler, started the
season at left tackle, was shifted to
end, and then back to tackle again
two weeks ago. Green, a left half
back, moved into the manpower
thin fullback spot on the strength
of his fine running in practice and
his performance from that position
against Baylor last Saturday.
Cherberg also reported that 233-
pound Don McCumby, a brilliant
sophomore reserve tackle, is on the
sick list with tonsillitis.
