# Stanton Sits Out Grid Drill; Al Harrington Question Mark
## 
### BOB MIEROW 
After a rugged practice Tuesday,
Stanford leveled off with no contact
work in yesterday's drill. The Cards
have been established 7-point un
derdogs in their battle with Wash
ington's Huskies at Seattle Saturday.
Tackle John Stanton missed yes
terday's workout because of a sore
knee. Trainer Connie Jarvis stated
that the 210-pound lineman will be
ready for the Huskies, however.
A 1 Harrington, sub fullback, is still
a question mark for Saturday's con
test. The speedy Samoan has been
weakened by the flu and has been
bothered by an injured ankle.
Lou Valli, out most of the year
with an injured knee, will be ready
at fullback whether or not Harring
ton makes the trip. Valli, a sopho
more from Bellarmine Prep, drew a
lot of attention in spring football
last season.
John Brodie and Carl Isaacs again
were working with the first eleven
in yesterday's drills. A possibility
exists that this duo will replace
quarterback Jerry Gustafson and
end John Stewart in the starting
team Saturday.
Coach Chuck Taylor also declared
that Jeri McMillin may open at half
back instead of Ernie Dorn. The lit
tle sophomore, one of the work
horses against UCLA, was drilling

with the first eleven yesterday.
The Indians stressed both offense
and defense in the workout. Brodie,
Gustafson, and Jack Douglas were
throwing as the Card backs and ends
went through pass patterns. The
possibility of a wet field in Seattle
could cut down the Tribe's overhead
game Saturday.
Taylor's 37-man traveling squad
will enplane for the Northwest to
morrow morning.

GLUE-FINGERED END—Carl Isaacs displayed such amazing
pass-catching talents against UCLA last Saturday thai he seems
to have moved veteran John Stewart out of the first-string posi
tion at left end. Isaacs, after a comparatively slow start, ranks
12th in the conference in pass receptions, having caught six for
a total of 83 yards.
