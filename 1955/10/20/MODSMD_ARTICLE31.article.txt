the end of the second half, the Phi
Kap I's got just 25 mote yards than
the Fiji II team in "sudden death"
play to give themselves a win in
intramural play yesterday. The Phi
Kaps thus avenged a loss to the
SAE's last week under similar cir
cumstances.
The first scoring was done by the
Phi Kappers on a pass from Dick
Pauletich to Jack Wilson. The PAT
attempt was no good, making the
score 6 to 0. Time ran out in the first
hall' before either team could get
much of a drive under way.

Bill Jennings of the Fiji squad inter
cepted a pass at midfield to halt any
plans the Phi Kaps had of scoring.

team to a first down, but then had
one of his passes go awry and drop
into the arms of J. D. North way of
the Phi Kaps.
EI JIS SCORE
To keep the interception racket
going, Bob McGrouther knifed in to
grab a Pauletich pass and give the
Fijis the ball just inside the midfield
stripe. Birkie then lateraled off to
his right halfback, who began a run
but quickly threw long to the left
end. Sam Ramburg. Ramburg gath
ered it in behind the defensive man
and went over for the score.
The Phi Kaps punted after failing
to make any progress, giving the
Fijis the ball once again. On second
down Birkie faded back and heaved
one to Ramburg far downfield. The
sticky-fingered end made a beautiful
diving catch to give his team the
balj with first and goal. The Fiji
attack bogged down with the end
zone just out of reach, and the ball
went over to the Phi Kappers with
less than three minutes remaining
in the game.
No large gains were made by
either team, and time ran out, ne
cessitating sudden-death play. The
Phi Kaps made 12 yards on their
second down of the alternated four
allotted each team. The Fiji squad
got 8 on a pass; then Pauletich hit
his left end for 21 big yards to

Climaxing a (i-to-(5 deadlock at
the end of the second half, the Phi
Kap I's got just 25 mote yards than
the Fiji II team in "sudden death"
play to give themselves a win in
intramural play yesterday. The Phi
Kaps thus avenged a loss to the
SAE's last week under similar cir
cumstances.
The first scoring was done by the
Phi Kappers on a pass from Dick
Pauletich to Jack Wilson. The PAT
attempt was no good, making the
score 6 to 0. Time ran out in the first
hall' before either team could get
much of a drive under way.
At the start of second-half action
Bill Jennings of the Fiji squad inter
cepted a pass at midfield to halt any
plans the Phi Kaps had of scoring.
Quarterback Bob Birkie directed his
team to a first down, but then had
one of his passes go awry and drop
into the arms of J. D. North way of
the Phi Kaps.
EI JIS SCORE
To keep the interception racket
going, Bob McGrouther knifed in to
grab a Pauletich pass and give the
Fijis the ball just inside the midfield
stripe. Birkie then lateraled off to
his right halfback, who began a run
but quickly threw long to the left
end. Sam Ramburg. Ramburg gath
ered it in behind the defensive man
and went over for the score.
The Phi Kaps punted after failing
to make any progress, giving the
Fijis the ball once again. On second
down Birkie faded back and heaved
one to Ramburg far downfield. The
sticky-fingered end made a beautiful
diving catch to give his team the
balj with first and goal. The Fiji
attack bogged down with the end
zone just out of reach, and the ball
went over to the Phi Kappers with
less than three minutes remaining
in the game.
No large gains were made by
either team, and time ran out, ne
cessitating sudden-death play. The
Phi Kaps made 12 yards on their
second down of the alternated four
allotted each team. The Fiji squad
got 8 on a pass; then Pauletich hit
his left end for 21 big yards to
cinch it.
