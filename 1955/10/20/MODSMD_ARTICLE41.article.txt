### BEV JOHNSON 
The most likely time lor an
accident to happen to a Stan
ford student is the
hours of 5 and 7 p.m. on a Tues
day or Saturday in October.
During these times the chance of
accidents resulting in injuries was
found to be most prevalent, accord
ing to a survey recently completed
by the Student Health Committee
of ASSU.
Headed by Malin Dollinger, chair
man, the committee compiled all
available data on student injuries
during the period from September
1, 1954, to August 31, 1955.
Results of the survey indicate that
Stanford students face an important
accident problem.
Of the 237 accidents reported, 153
occurred on campus. Dormitories
had a high rate of mishaps. Par
ticularly dangerous hours of the day
were from 2 to 8 p.m. Tuesday,
Wednesday and the week end were
the worst days, and October, Janu
ary and April had highest monthly
records.
Injuries of the head, face, legs and
arms resulted from 90 per cent of
the accidents; severity ranged from
mild lacerations to internal injuries
and fractures.
Intramural athletics was the cause
of 33 injuriesâ€”almost half the total
of reported athletic mishaps. Un
organized athletics sustained a high
rate also.
Vehicle traffic accounted for 31 of
the off-campus accidents; 34 other
ofT-campus mishaps occurred in res
idences or during recreation.
