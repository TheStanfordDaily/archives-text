# After a Year of Silence, The Carillon Tolls Again
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
While visiting Hoover Tcwer today, Prince Albert of Belgium
will inspect one of his nation's many gifts to the University—the
35-bell carillon, which began tolling again last Sunday after a
year of inactivity. As Stanford's royal visitor leaves the campus
around noon today, freshman John Mullen will peal out the Bel-

gian and United States national an
thems and the Stanford hymn.
Although an amateur at the pro
fession of carillon playing, Mullen
has played the powerful bells at
Grace Cathedral in San Francisco—
the only other carillon in Northern
California.
In addition to ringing the Sunday
"call to worship" every week, Mul
len will musically manipulate the
intricate instrument for special oc
casions, such as today and Sunday
in commemoration of United Nations
Day.
The carillon was rung last year
only on special occasions since Stan
ford lost her former carillonneur the
year before.
Stanford found that carillonneurs
are about as rare as the carillons
themselves, there being less than
100 of the latter in the United States
today.
The carillon, valued at $100,000,
consists of a bewildering network of
wires connecting the ancient-looking
clavier and pedals on the floor below
to the clappers of the bells above,
on the observation floor of the tower.
The 35 bells, cast in Tournai, Bel
gium, were presented to the Uni
versity in 1941 by the Belgian -
American Education Foundation in
honor of Herbert Hoover and the
Belgian relief work he did during
and after World War I.
Before its presentation to Stan
ford, the nine-ton "klokenspel," as

it is called by the Belgians, rang out
in the Belgian pavilion at the New
York World's Fair in 1939 and 1940.
To the man in the Tower sitting
behind the keyboard, the sounds of
the giant carillon may sound more
like the deafening crashes against a
blacksmith's anvil than the sweet
pealing of bolls.
Closer than a distance of 500 feet
from the Tower, dinning overtones
from the reverberating bells are
compounded to produce a jangling
confusion of sounds.

100 of the latter in the United States
today.
The carillon, valued at $100,000,
consists of a bewildering network of
wires connecting the ancient-looking
clavier and pedals on the floor below
to the clappers of the bells above,
on the observation floor of the tower.
The 35 bells, cast in Tournai, Bel
gium, were presented to the Uni
versity in 1941 by the Belgian -
American Education Foundation in
honor of Herbert Hoover and the
Belgian relief work he did during
and after World War I.
Before its presentation to Stan
ford, the nine-ton "klokenspel," as

it is called by the Belgians, rang out
in the Belgian pavilion at the New
York World's Fair in 1939 and 1940.
To the man in the Tower sitting
behind the keyboard, the sounds of
the giant carillon may sound more
like the deafening crashes against a
blacksmith's anvil than the sweet
pealing of bolls.
Closer than a distance of 500 feet
from the Tower, dinning overtones
from the reverberating bells are
compounded to produce a jangling
confusion of sounds.
