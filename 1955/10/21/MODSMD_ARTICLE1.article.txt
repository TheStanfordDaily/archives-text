# Indian Gridders Make Northland Trek, Seek First League Win Against Huskies
## Hosts Need Win In PCC Crucial 
### BILL NICHOLS 
Stanford seeks its first Pacific
Coast Conference win tomorrow
afternoon >n the University of
Washington Stadium at Seattle.
The Cards could have picked an
easier foe. The Husky from
Washington is tied for first place
in the conference with UCLA.
The Stanford football machine has
presented an enigma this season.
When they want to play, they look
great. When they don't, look out.
The Ohio State game and the second
half of the UCLA encounter bear
out the first, but against Oregon
State and Michigan State the Tay
lormen could do nothing right. And
there doesn t seem to be any formula
for determining in advance how the
boys are going to do.
Fullback Bill Tarr, a potent pass
ing attack, and a more than adequate
line give the Cards plenty of weap
ons. But Washington would appear
to have counters for the latter.
HEAVY LINE
Washington's line weighs an aver
age of 213 pounds a man. And it's
anchored by two real toughies —
tackle Fred Robinson and end Jim
Houston. These two anchor the
right side ol the Husky line and no
body has made very much yardage
around that side. And the left side
isn't much better. Guard Dick Day
is 245 and tackle George Strugar
weighs 230.
Weather conditions in Seattle are
at the best unpredictable. Rain is a
constant threat, and although the
Huskies haven't flooded the field to
create muddy turf in recent years,
the field is apt to be soggy.
But Chuck Taylor doesn't seem to
think that rain will hamper the In
dians' passing attack. "Garrett had
one of his best days ever against
Michigan in the rain in 1953. I don't
think it makes any difference," the
Card coach said.
But Bill Tarr, playing before a
"home town" audience, should put
on quite a show. The senior from
Bellingham is one of the top rushers
I in the nation.
BRODIE TO START
, John Brodie, recently elevated to
the starting role at quarterback on
| the basis of his passing show against


Smith Hawaii Studio
ACE PASSER—Stanford's John Brodie (12) goes up to throw a
pass behind a protective cup of (left, to right) Don Manoukian,
Joe Long, £nd Donn Carswell. Brodie is Stanford's leading
passer, with a total of 286 yards gained on 24 completed passes.
UCLA, will be running the team and
doing the passing when the Indians
take to the air. If it becomes evident
that passing won't work, Jerry Gus
tafson will be on hand to move the
running game.
.Carl Isaacs is the only other new
comer to the starting lineup, Isaacs
seems to have moved John Stewart
out. He, Jerry Beattie, and Paul
Camera are the chief pass receivers
for Brodie.
One halfback spot is still up for
grabs—Ernie Dorn and Jeri McMil
lin are in contention for the right
half position. Dorn, a superior mud
der, will probably get the call there.
The rest of the Stanford lineup
will be the same —Paul Wiggin and
Chris Marshall at tackles, Tony Mo
sich and Donn Carswell at guards,

and Joe Long at ccnter. Don Ged
des, however, is recovering last from
his enforced layoff with a bad knee'
and may see considerable action as
pivot man.
The Stanford line averages out to
205 pounds per man and the backs
weigh in at 189. Both are heavy, but
the Purple and Gold figures are
higher. Their backs weigh 195, and
the team average is 207.
HUSKIES SURPRISE
Washington is certainly the sur
prise team of the conference. From
a Husky squad which won only two
games in 1954, Coach John Cherberg
has developed a team which has won
four out of five this season, losing
only to Baylor by a close 13-7 mar
gin last Saturday.
Washington looked good but not
spectacular in its first three games.
They nipped Idaho 14-7 in their
opener, then upset two-touchdown
favoi ite Minnesota by 30-0. After
taking Oregon into camp, the Hus
kies pulled the upset of the season
when a Roake to Houston to Lewis
pass in the fourth quarter gave them
a 7-0 win over vaunted USC.
The game was played in a tor
rential downpour, but the field was
surprisingly firm. On an overall
evaluation, the nod would have had
to go to the Trojans, but that edge
was very slight, and besides UW
scored and the SCers didn't.
RUNNING BACKS
Aside from a very sturdy line,
Washington depends on a group of
running backs that aren't terrifically
fast, but are hard to stop. Injury

prone Mike Monroe is the top man.
He's a junior who lettered in foot'
ball, basketball, and track in high
school.
At Washington he has injured a
knee and a wrist in two opening
?ames (195.') and 1954), putting him
out for the season in football, and
the other leg went out two years
ago playing varsity basketball.
But Monroe has been the work
horse of the team this year. He has
carried the ball 57 times for an aver
age of 4.2 yards. He also is a de
fensive standout.
Jim Jones starts at the other half
back spot. He's a sophomore and
runs the 100 in 10.1. This makes
him the closest thing the Huskies
have to a breakaway threat.
HALFBACK RESERVES
Cherberg has capable reserves at
the halfback spot too. "Incredible'.'
Credell Green, a jaycee transfer, is
a little weak on defense, but a hard
runner, and Cherberg has indicated
he may get the nod over Jones this
Saturday. Bob Dunn, Washington's
counterpart of Ernie Dorn, is back
alter an injury in the Idaho game,
and got in more playing time than
any other Husky last season.
Dean Derby and Dunn do th<*
place kicking for the team, and both
are surprisingly accurate.
At fullback is Jim McCarter, who
is ahead of Bob McNamee. McNa
mee, the 1954 starter, has been
slowed up with injuries. McCarter
is another jaycee transfer, and a
good line plunger.
Husky passing is handled by Steve
Roake. He's been switched from end
to take up the slack left from the
departure of Bob Cox. Sandy Le
derman is back on the team, but not
seeing much Action. Roake has com
pleted 18 out of 37 passes for 290
yards so far this season, and has had
only one pitch intercepted.
NEW PCC RECORD
Washington passers have set a
new PCC record in the interception
department this year. They threw
59 passes before one was grabbed by
the defense.
The line is filled out with Corky
Lewis at left end, sturdy Earl Mon
lux at right guard, and Dell Jensen
at center.
Washington uses the T formation
exclusively, and runs option plays
from it. Many plays are run with a
spread line —split T. They line up
with a yard between the center and
guards, and almost a yard and a half
between the guards and tackles.
Defensively, Washington is rough,
Their big line gang tackles with fre
quency, and the Huskies are tops in
rushing defense.
Stanford isn't going too far in the
conference race this year, but can
be a spoiler. Washington, USC, and
UCLA are almost neck and neck for
the crown and the Huskies must win
to stay in the running.
Stanford is rightly the underdog,
but the margin is not too great and
if the Cards put on one of their
better efforts, they could and should
come home with a win, weather per
mitting.

Bill Tarr has been chosen team
captain for the Washington game,
Chuck Taylor announced yester
day. The game will he broadcast
over station KGO at 1:45 |i.tn.

Stanford seeks its first Pacific
Coast Conference win tomorrow
afternoon >n the University of
Washington Stadium at Seattle.
The Cards could have picked an
easier foe. The Husky from
Washington is tied for first place
in the conference with UCLA.
The Stanford football machine has
presented an enigma this season.
When they want to play, they look
great. When they don't, look out.
The Ohio State game and the second
half of the UCLA encounter bear
out the first, but against Oregon
State and Michigan State the Tay
lormen could do nothing right. And
there doesn t seem to be any formula
for determining in advance how the
boys are going to do.
Fullback Bill Tarr, a potent pass
ing attack, and a more than adequate
line give the Cards plenty of weap
ons. But Washington would appear
to have counters for the latter.
HEAVY LINE
Washington's line weighs an aver
age of 213 pounds a man. And it's
anchored by two real toughies —
tackle Fred Robinson and end Jim
Houston. These two anchor the
right side ol the Husky line and no
body has made very much yardage
around that side. And the left side
isn't much better. Guard Dick Day
is 245 and tackle George Strugar
weighs 230.
Weather conditions in Seattle are
at the best unpredictable. Rain is a
constant threat, and although the
Huskies haven't flooded the field to
create muddy turf in recent years,
the field is apt to be soggy.
But Chuck Taylor doesn't seem to
think that rain will hamper the In
dians' passing attack. "Garrett had
one of his best days ever against
Michigan in the rain in 1953. I don't
think it makes any difference," the
Card coach said.
But Bill Tarr, playing before a
"home town" audience, should put
on quite a show. The senior from
Bellingham is one of the top rushers
I in the nation.
BRODIE TO START
, John Brodie, recently elevated to
the starting role at quarterback on
| the basis of his passing show against


Smith Hawaii Studio
ACE PASSER—Stanford's John Brodie (12) goes up to throw a
pass behind a protective cup of (left, to right) Don Manoukian,
Joe Long, £nd Donn Carswell. Brodie is Stanford's leading
passer, with a total of 286 yards gained on 24 completed passes.
UCLA, will be running the team and
doing the passing when the Indians
take to the air. If it becomes evident
that passing won't work, Jerry Gus
tafson will be on hand to move the
running game.
.Carl Isaacs is the only other new
comer to the starting lineup, Isaacs
seems to have moved John Stewart
out. He, Jerry Beattie, and Paul
Camera are the chief pass receivers
for Brodie.
One halfback spot is still up for
grabs—Ernie Dorn and Jeri McMil
lin are in contention for the right
half position. Dorn, a superior mud
der, will probably get the call there.
The rest of the Stanford lineup
will be the same —Paul Wiggin and
Chris Marshall at tackles, Tony Mo
sich and Donn Carswell at guards,

and Joe Long at ccnter. Don Ged
des, however, is recovering last from
his enforced layoff with a bad knee'
and may see considerable action as
pivot man.
The Stanford line averages out to
205 pounds per man and the backs
weigh in at 189. Both are heavy, but
the Purple and Gold figures are
higher. Their backs weigh 195, and
the team average is 207.
HUSKIES SURPRISE
Washington is certainly the sur
prise team of the conference. From
a Husky squad which won only two
games in 1954, Coach John Cherberg
has developed a team which has won
four out of five this season, losing
only to Baylor by a close 13-7 mar
gin last Saturday.
Washington looked good but not
spectacular in its first three games.
They nipped Idaho 14-7 in their
opener, then upset two-touchdown
favoi ite Minnesota by 30-0. After
taking Oregon into camp, the Hus
kies pulled the upset of the season
when a Roake to Houston to Lewis
pass in the fourth quarter gave them
a 7-0 win over vaunted USC.
The game was played in a tor
rential downpour, but the field was
surprisingly firm. On an overall
evaluation, the nod would have had
to go to the Trojans, but that edge
was very slight, and besides UW
scored and the SCers didn't.
RUNNING BACKS
Aside from a very sturdy line,
Washington depends on a group of
running backs that aren't terrifically
fast, but are hard to stop. Injury

prone Mike Monroe is the top man.
He's a junior who lettered in foot'
ball, basketball, and track in high
school.
At Washington he has injured a
knee and a wrist in two opening
?ames (195.') and 1954), putting him
out for the season in football, and
the other leg went out two years
ago playing varsity basketball.
But Monroe has been the work
horse of the team this year. He has
carried the ball 57 times for an aver
age of 4.2 yards. He also is a de
fensive standout.
Jim Jones starts at the other half
back spot. He's a sophomore and
runs the 100 in 10.1. This makes
him the closest thing the Huskies
have to a breakaway threat.
HALFBACK RESERVES
Cherberg has capable reserves at
the halfback spot too. "Incredible'.'
Credell Green, a jaycee transfer, is
a little weak on defense, but a hard
runner, and Cherberg has indicated
he may get the nod over Jones this
Saturday. Bob Dunn, Washington's
counterpart of Ernie Dorn, is back
alter an injury in the Idaho game,
and got in more playing time than
any other Husky last season.
Dean Derby and Dunn do th<*
place kicking for the team, and both
are surprisingly accurate.
At fullback is Jim McCarter, who
is ahead of Bob McNamee. McNa
mee, the 1954 starter, has been
slowed up with injuries. McCarter
is another jaycee transfer, and a
good line plunger.
Husky passing is handled by Steve
Roake. He's been switched from end
to take up the slack left from the
departure of Bob Cox. Sandy Le
derman is back on the team, but not
seeing much Action. Roake has com
pleted 18 out of 37 passes for 290
yards so far this season, and has had
only one pitch intercepted.
NEW PCC RECORD
Washington passers have set a
new PCC record in the interception
department this year. They threw
59 passes before one was grabbed by
the defense.
The line is filled out with Corky
Lewis at left end, sturdy Earl Mon
lux at right guard, and Dell Jensen
at center.
Washington uses the T formation
exclusively, and runs option plays
from it. Many plays are run with a
spread line —split T. They line up
with a yard between the center and
guards, and almost a yard and a half
between the guards and tackles.
Defensively, Washington is rough,
Their big line gang tackles with fre
quency, and the Huskies are tops in
rushing defense.
Stanford isn't going too far in the
conference race this year, but can
be a spoiler. Washington, USC, and
UCLA are almost neck and neck for
the crown and the Huskies must win
to stay in the running.
Stanford is rightly the underdog,
but the margin is not too great and

better efforts, they could and should

The Cards could have picked an
easier foe. The Husky from

in the conference with UCLA.
The Stanford football machine has
presented an enigma this season.
When they want to play, they look
great. When they don't, look out.
The Ohio State game and the second
half of the UCLA encounter bear
out the first, but against Oregon
State and Michigan State the Tay
lormen could do nothing right. And
there doesn t seem to be any formula
for determining in advance how the
boys are going to do.
Fullback Bill Tarr, a potent pass
ing attack, and a more than adequate
line give the Cards plenty of weap
ons. But Washington would appear
to have counters for the latter.
HEAVY LINE
Washington's line weighs an aver
age of 213 pounds a man. And it's
anchored by two real toughies —
tackle Fred Robinson and end Jim
Houston. These two anchor the
right side ol the Husky line and no
body has made very much yardage
around that side. And the left side
isn't much better. Guard Dick Day
is 245 and tackle George Strugar
weighs 230.
Weather conditions in Seattle are
at the best unpredictable. Rain is a
constant threat, and although the
Huskies haven't flooded the field to
create muddy turf in recent years,
the field is apt to be soggy.
But Chuck Taylor doesn't seem to
think that rain will hamper the In
dians' passing attack. "Garrett had
one of his best days ever against
Michigan in the rain in 1953. I don't
think it makes any difference," the
Card coach said.
But Bill Tarr, playing before a
"home town" audience, should put
on quite a show. The senior from
Bellingham is one of the top rushers
I in the nation.
BRODIE TO START
, John Brodie, recently elevated to
the starting role at quarterback on
| the basis of his passing show against


Smith Hawaii Studio
ACE PASSER—Stanford's John Brodie (12) goes up to throw a
pass behind a protective cup of (left, to right) Don Manoukian,
Joe Long, £nd Donn Carswell. Brodie is Stanford's leading
passer, with a total of 286 yards gained on 24 completed passes.
UCLA, will be running the team and
doing the passing when the Indians
take to the air. If it becomes evident
that passing won't work, Jerry Gus
tafson will be on hand to move the
running game.
.Carl Isaacs is the only other new
comer to the starting lineup, Isaacs
seems to have moved John Stewart
out. He, Jerry Beattie, and Paul
Camera are the chief pass receivers
for Brodie.
One halfback spot is still up for
grabs—Ernie Dorn and Jeri McMil
lin are in contention for the right
half position. Dorn, a superior mud
der, will probably get the call there.
The rest of the Stanford lineup
will be the same —Paul Wiggin and
Chris Marshall at tackles, Tony Mo
sich and Donn Carswell at guards,

and Joe Long at ccnter. Don Ged
des, however, is recovering last from
his enforced layoff with a bad knee'
and may see considerable action as
pivot man.
The Stanford line averages out to
205 pounds per man and the backs
weigh in at 189. Both are heavy, but
the Purple and Gold figures are
higher. Their backs weigh 195, and
the team average is 207.
HUSKIES SURPRISE
Washington is certainly the sur
prise team of the conference. From
a Husky squad which won only two
games in 1954, Coach John Cherberg
has developed a team which has won
four out of five this season, losing
only to Baylor by a close 13-7 mar
gin last Saturday.
Washington looked good but not
spectacular in its first three games.
They nipped Idaho 14-7 in their
opener, then upset two-touchdown
favoi ite Minnesota by 30-0. After
taking Oregon into camp, the Hus
kies pulled the upset of the season
when a Roake to Houston to Lewis
pass in the fourth quarter gave them
a 7-0 win over vaunted USC.
The game was played in a tor
rential downpour, but the field was
surprisingly firm. On an overall
evaluation, the nod would have had
to go to the Trojans, but that edge
was very slight, and besides UW
scored and the SCers didn't.
RUNNING BACKS
Aside from a very sturdy line,
Washington depends on a group of
running backs that aren't terrifically
fast, but are hard to stop. Injury

prone Mike Monroe is the top man.
He's a junior who lettered in foot'
ball, basketball, and track in high
school.
At Washington he has injured a
knee and a wrist in two opening
?ames (195.') and 1954), putting him
out for the season in football, and
the other leg went out two years
ago playing varsity basketball.
But Monroe has been the work
horse of the team this year. He has
carried the ball 57 times for an aver
age of 4.2 yards. He also is a de
fensive standout.
Jim Jones starts at the other half
back spot. He's a sophomore and
runs the 100 in 10.1. This makes
him the closest thing the Huskies
have to a breakaway threat.
HALFBACK RESERVES
Cherberg has capable reserves at
the halfback spot too. "Incredible'.'
Credell Green, a jaycee transfer, is
a little weak on defense, but a hard
runner, and Cherberg has indicated
he may get the nod over Jones this
Saturday. Bob Dunn, Washington's
counterpart of Ernie Dorn, is back
alter an injury in the Idaho game,
and got in more playing time than
any other Husky last season.
Dean Derby and Dunn do th<*
place kicking for the team, and both
are surprisingly accurate.
At fullback is Jim McCarter, who
is ahead of Bob McNamee. McNa
mee, the 1954 starter, has been
slowed up with injuries. McCarter
is another jaycee transfer, and a
good line plunger.
Husky passing is handled by Steve
Roake. He's been switched from end
to take up the slack left from the
departure of Bob Cox. Sandy Le
derman is back on the team, but not
seeing much Action. Roake has com
pleted 18 out of 37 passes for 290
yards so far this season, and has had
only one pitch intercepted.
NEW PCC RECORD
Washington passers have set a
new PCC record in the interception
department this year. They threw
59 passes before one was grabbed by
the defense.
The line is filled out with Corky
Lewis at left end, sturdy Earl Mon
lux at right guard, and Dell Jensen
at center.
Washington uses the T formation
exclusively, and runs option plays
from it. Many plays are run with a
spread line —split T. They line up
with a yard between the center and
guards, and almost a yard and a half
between the guards and tackles.
Defensively, Washington is rough,
Their big line gang tackles with fre
quency, and the Huskies are tops in

exclusively, and runs option plays
from it. Many plays are run with a
spread line —split T. They line up
with a yard between the center and
guards, and almost a yard and a half
between the guards and tackles.
Defensively, Washington is rough,

Stanford isn't going too far in the

Stanford seeks its first Pacific
Coast Conference win tomorrow
afternoon >n the University of
Washington Stadium at Seattle.
The Cards could have picked an
easier foe. The Husky from
Washington is tied for first place
in the conference with UCLA.
The Stanford football machine has
presented an enigma this season.
When they want to play, they look
great. When they don't, look out.
The Ohio State game and the second
half of the UCLA encounter bear
out the first, but against Oregon
State and Michigan State the Tay
lormen could do nothing right. And
there doesn t seem to be any formula
for determining in advance how the
boys are going to do.
Fullback Bill Tarr, a potent pass
ing attack, and a more than adequate
line give the Cards plenty of weap
ons. But Washington would appear
to have counters for the latter.
HEAVY LINE
Washington's line weighs an aver
age of 213 pounds a man. And it's
anchored by two real toughies —
tackle Fred Robinson and end Jim
Houston. These two anchor the
right side ol the Husky line and no
body has made very much yardage
around that side. And the left side
isn't much better. Guard Dick Day
is 245 and tackle George Strugar
weighs 230.
Weather conditions in Seattle are
at the best unpredictable. Rain is a
constant threat, and although the
Huskies haven't flooded the field to
create muddy turf in recent years,
the field is apt to be soggy.
But Chuck Taylor doesn't seem to
think that rain will hamper the In
dians' passing attack. "Garrett had
one of his best days ever against
Michigan in the rain in 1953. I don't
think it makes any difference," the
Card coach said.
But Bill Tarr, playing before a
"home town" audience, should put
on quite a show. The senior from
Bellingham is one of the top rushers
I in the nation.
BRODIE TO START
, John Brodie, recently elevated to
the starting role at quarterback on
| the basis of his passing show against


Smith Hawaii Studio
ACE PASSER—Stanford's John Brodie (12) goes up to throw a
pass behind a protective cup of (left, to right) Don Manoukian,
Joe Long, £nd Donn Carswell. Brodie is Stanford's leading
passer, with a total of 286 yards gained on 24 completed passes.
UCLA, will be running the team and
doing the passing when the Indians
take to the air. If it becomes evident
that passing won't work, Jerry Gus
tafson will be on hand to move the
running game.
.Carl Isaacs is the only other new
comer to the starting lineup, Isaacs
seems to have moved John Stewart
out. He, Jerry Beattie, and Paul
Camera are the chief pass receivers
for Brodie.
One halfback spot is still up for
grabs—Ernie Dorn and Jeri McMil
lin are in contention for the right
half position. Dorn, a superior mud
der, will probably get the call there.
The rest of the Stanford lineup
will be the same —Paul Wiggin and
Chris Marshall at tackles, Tony Mo
sich and Donn Carswell at guards,

and Joe Long at ccnter. Don Ged
des, however, is recovering last from
his enforced layoff with a bad knee'
and may see considerable action as
pivot man.
The Stanford line averages out to
205 pounds per man and the backs
weigh in at 189. Both are heavy, but
the Purple and Gold figures are
higher. Their backs weigh 195, and
the team average is 207.
HUSKIES SURPRISE
Washington is certainly the sur
prise team of the conference. From
a Husky squad which won only two
games in 1954, Coach John Cherberg
has developed a team which has won
four out of five this season, losing
only to Baylor by a close 13-7 mar
gin last Saturday.
Washington looked good but not
spectacular in its first three games.
They nipped Idaho 14-7 in their
opener, then upset two-touchdown
favoi ite Minnesota by 30-0. After
taking Oregon into camp, the Hus
kies pulled the upset of the season
when a Roake to Houston to Lewis
pass in the fourth quarter gave them
a 7-0 win over vaunted USC.
The game was played in a tor
rential downpour, but the field was
surprisingly firm. On an overall
evaluation, the nod would have had
to go to the Trojans, but that edge
was very slight, and besides UW
scored and the SCers didn't.
RUNNING BACKS
Aside from a very sturdy line,
Washington depends on a group of
running backs that aren't terrifically
fast, but are hard to stop. Injury

prone Mike Monroe is the top man.
He's a junior who lettered in foot'
ball, basketball, and track in high
school.
At Washington he has injured a
knee and a wrist in two opening
?ames (195.') and 1954), putting him
out for the season in football, and
the other leg went out two years
ago playing varsity basketball.
But Monroe has been the work
horse of the team this year. He has
carried the ball 57 times for an aver
age of 4.2 yards. He also is a de
fensive standout.
Jim Jones starts at the other half
back spot. He's a sophomore and
runs the 100 in 10.1. This makes
him the closest thing the Huskies
have to a breakaway threat.
HALFBACK RESERVES
Cherberg has capable reserves at
the halfback spot too. "Incredible'.'
Credell Green, a jaycee transfer, is
a little weak on defense, but a hard
runner, and Cherberg has indicated
he may get the nod over Jones this
Saturday. Bob Dunn, Washington's
counterpart of Ernie Dorn, is back
alter an injury in the Idaho game,
and got in more playing time than
any other Husky last season.
Dean Derby and Dunn do th<*
place kicking for the team, and both
are surprisingly accurate.
At fullback is Jim McCarter, who
is ahead of Bob McNamee. McNa
mee, the 1954 starter, has been
slowed up with injuries. McCarter
is another jaycee transfer, and a
good line plunger.
Husky passing is handled by Steve
Roake. He's been switched from end
to take up the slack left from the
departure of Bob Cox. Sandy Le
derman is back on the team, but not
seeing much Action. Roake has com
pleted 18 out of 37 passes for 290
yards so far this season, and has had
only one pitch intercepted.
NEW PCC RECORD
Washington passers have set a
new PCC record in the interception
department this year. They threw
59 passes before one was grabbed by
the defense.
The line is filled out with Corky
Lewis at left end, sturdy Earl Mon
lux at right guard, and Dell Jensen
at center.
Washington uses the T formation
exclusively, and runs option plays
from it. Many plays are run with a
spread line —split T. They line up
with a yard between the center and
guards, and almost a yard and a half
between the guards and tackles.
