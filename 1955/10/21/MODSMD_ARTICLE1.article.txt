# Indian Gridders Make Northland Trek, Seek First League Win Against Huskies
## Hosts Need Win In PCC Crucial

Stanford seeks its first Pacific
Coast Conference win tomorrow
afternoon >n the University of
Washington Stadium at Seattle.
The Cards could have picked an
easier foe. The Husky from
Washington is tied for first place
in the conference with UCLA.
The Stanford football machine has
presented an enigma this season.
When they want to play, they look
great. When they don't, look out.
The Ohio State game and the second
half of the UCLA encounter bear
out the first, but against Oregon
State and Michigan State the Tay
lormen could do nothing right. And
there doesn t seem to be any formula
for determining in advance how the
boys are going to do.
Fullback Bill Tarr, a potent pass
ing attack, and a more than adequate
line give the Cards plenty of weap
ons. But Washington would appear
to have counters for the latter.
HEAVY LINE
Washington's line weighs an aver
age of 213 pounds a man. And it's
anchored by two real toughies —
tackle Fred Robinson and end Jim
Houston. These two anchor the
right side ol the Husky line and no
body has made very much yardage
around that side. And the left side
isn't much better. Guard Dick Day
is 245 and tackle George Strugar
weighs 230.
Weather conditions in Seattle are
at the best unpredictable. Rain is a
constant threat, and although the
Huskies haven't flooded the field to
create muddy turf in recent years,
the field is apt to be soggy.
But Chuck Taylor doesn't seem to
think that rain will hamper the In
dians' passing attack. "Garrett had
one of his best days ever against
Michigan in the rain in 1953. I don't
think it makes any difference," the
Card coach said.
But Bill Tarr, playing before a
"home town" audience, should put
on quite a show. The senior from
Bellingham is one of the top rushers
I in the nation.
