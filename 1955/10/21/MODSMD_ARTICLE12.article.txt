### 
University trustees voted yester
day to proceed immediately with de
velopment of an 875-acre residential
tract as part of Stanford's master
plan for its 9,000-acre land holding.
The University has directed its
land consultants, Skidmore, Owings
& Merrill of San Francisco, to draw
up a detailed plan for the 875 acres,
The tract is then to be subdivided
a section at a time in units of 50 to
100 acres. Construction on the first
increment is scheduled to get under
way a year from now.
"The University is grateful to the
Del E. Webb organization for sur
veying the project," Alf E. Brandin,
executive officer for land develop
ment. has declared. "Mr. Webb un
dertook this study in the interests of
Stanford, and his participation has
been of great assistance to us."
Webb, part-owner of the New
York Yankees, heads one of the
largest construction companies in
the country.
The 875-acre tract is bounded by
Sand Hill Road and San Francisco
quito Creek.
Of the University's 9,000 acres,
3,820 have been set aside for the ed
ucational campus. The remainder is
being developed under a long-range
plan for commercial, light industrial,
professional and residential uses.
