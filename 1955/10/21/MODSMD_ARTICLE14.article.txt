### 
By HELEN DEVVAR
The shyly smiling young
prince of Bslgium paid a hur
ried, informal visit to Stanford
yesterday as a part of his two
month nationwide tour.
The informal, relaxed atmosphere
I jf the group of faculty, students, and
quests who met Prince Albert in
1 Hoover Library differs markedly
from the formal protocol that is ob
served when the prince visits Bel
gian campuses, according to a stu
! dent who has attended both Stan
rord and Belgian schools.
Students asked the tall young
orince questions ranging from mili
tary programs in Belgium to his im
pressions of San Francisco, and the
prince responded eagerly.
This, according to Belgian foreign
! student Charles Annicq, would have
j been unbelievable in Belgium where
j questions are never asked so freely
and frankly of a membr of the royal
1 family.
Upon hearing a brief review of
Stanford student government and
campus life by George Ralph, Prince
i Albert smiled and said that "univer
sity life here appears much more
1 pleasant than on the Continent."

Having arrived shortly after 10:30
a.m. yesterday, the prince was im
mediately greeted by C. Easton
Rothwell, director of Hoover Insti
tute, and ushered to the top of Hoo
ver Tower where he got his first real
view of the campus and took a few
pictures.
The 21-year-old brother of the
Belgian monarch will leave tomor
row for Yosemite National Park and
I then proceed to Los Angeles.
He will tour the South continuing
his program of inspection of key
j United States naval installations,
I and plans to leave the country late
j in November.
Among the mementos given the
I prince during his two - hour visit
! were an engraved volume of the
Quad, a copy of the Fundamental
Standard booklet, and a booklet on
Memorial Church, which he visited
before he left the campus.
