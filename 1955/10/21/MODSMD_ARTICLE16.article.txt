Final bids for the construction of Florence Moore Hall wio

The University Board of Trusiees agreed to the bid of 52.5 mil

tion firm which is currently build-
I ing the new Stern Hall addition.
Building of the residence wn .
made possible by the $1 million gilt
it Mrs. Robert S. Moore of Atherton,
who donated the sum to Stanford
last March. Remainder of the money
is to be provided by the University.
Ground for the building was bro
ken this summer in ceremonies at
its site near Lake Lagunita. A
000 contract was let to Bahr & 1,0-doyen
doyen of Palo Alto to prepare On
site. Approximately 50.000 cubic
yards of dirt were moved by the
company.
ARCHITECT
Plans tor the hall were drawn by
Milton T. Pflueger, San Francisco
architect. Moore Hall will house .'i. r >o
women in seven separate wings,
each with its own dining room,
lounge, and outdoor court. There
will be a central kitchen and admin
istrative area in the three - story
building.
University officials say that the
hall will be ready for occupancy
next autumn quarter.
At the time of Mrs. Moore's do
nation President Sterling com
mented, '"Her gift will make it pos
sible for Stanford to build a resi
dence which will embody the most
advanced thinking in design of stu
dent living facilities and which will
be a model for others to follow."
ADVANTAGES
Milton F. Johnson of the Planning
Office commented, "Principally what
we're trying to do is recreate row
living conditions in a large dormi
tory." The proposed structure has
been described by University offi
cials as combining the advantages of
small-group living with the econo
mies of joint operation.
Exact location of Moore Hall is on
part of the gradually sloping open
field across frrtm the Knoll and fac -
ing the peripheral road which will
run east and west, north of the Zeta
Psi house and Lagunita Drive.
With completion of the hall the
University will be able to increase
its enrollment of women student: ,
At present only two of every seven
who apply may be accepted because
of lack of housing.
