attacking the myth
To the Editor:
Biavo and three cheers for Dr. Stunt 1 ! At last
mebo.'y has attacked the Stanford activities myth.
J i i to .tir tlit* problem, rather than to mention spe
at'livities to i.xc, is worth while. Having spent
!ui': years as a Stanford undergraduate in the usual
munds of activities ranging irom punching tissue
|. ;ji • in chicken-wire to some of the more prestige
i. i -.ded positions, 1 particularly appreciated Dr.
Stone's points.
I -iK.ily the reasons j. iven for justifying "activities"
an- that it develops the individual's ability to get
, hi • with othi rs and helps him let off steam. As for
t!:i_> ' ti am." 1 have seldom seen why it needed to be
I t i !T- usually the pressure in the boiler had been
hulk up through participation in other activtes
! at! than any academc pursuits.
Now ior the "getting along with people." Often,
\vhiie the "activities type" races around doing good
o. busy. rk. he misses the companionship and
i! ul.ii (it human understanding that might come if he
had •>' !)! more time with his own roommates or liv
ii, • ; r i j.p. It is also evident that in all this exertion,
th "acivities type" misses a lot that the University
ha to offer -items that cannot be made up in wom
i•:i'- ( labs or lodges later.
|'ve-y nnw and then to justify the belief that activi
ty s dot. t really hurt, someone will mention that "So
a ij- o is an A student" and "look at all he's in."
Such an argument misses the point that while the
l;.:JOC ( r BWG'C) might be keeping the curve up,
h! daily life is interrupted with hours and hours of
vmiK'le exertion —hours that might have been de-
J t i delving deeply into the academic subjects
, t brow.iing through those books that he always
v/. nLed to lead.
A Dr. Stone suggests, we should be able to pre
< v a mi: e <.F participation and fellowship while
<i v:■!(>(,im; our minds as well as our smiles. Certainly
■ iiir- tha. promote discussion, debate, or interest
i: •<>:>:( thing that is lasting are worth while.
Ii' w- there is another side to the coin, and that
i there are not only valueless student activities
I,iii a! o valueless academic activities. But this aspect
v. ouM lead us into suggesting that about half the
cj.ir in the catalog be dumped; more depth given
to what is left; and the adoption of a semester sys
t.".,: all arguments for a later day.

striking at the heart
To the Editor:
M . Stone ("From Another Viewpoint," Oct. 1 ( J) has
• . d a number of constructive suggestions which
unfortunately, entirely un-Stanfordian. He is
• i l ia 1 at the very heart of that social institution
known as Stanford University. Whoever heard of an
ii' titution devoted primarily to learning? Why, he
actually has the audacity to suggest that students
might better spend their time attending debates, po
litical societies, or discussion groups.
'I o akolish "Hell Week" would be to abolish the
fraternities, and where would we be without the

fraternities? Rallies, floats, card stunts, and various
assorted days and weeks are necessary to the iur
therance ot the Stanford reputation. Mr. Stone would
undermine that "adolescent" reputation with a
thoughtful, mature attitude toward, of all things,
learning.
A few people like Mr. Stone and who knows what
might happen. We might lose a reputation and gain
a wav of life devoted to the one thing we can least
afford to lose sight of—education.

a brave article
To the Editor:
Attention Mr. Stone:
May I congratulate you on your "brave" article
in Wednesday's Stanford Daily?
For the first time since I have taught at Stanford
University (194'J) I have read in our own newspaper
an article expressing the views and opinions of many
members of our faculty, including myself. Let's hope
that our students will find your article as worth while
and useful as I did.

wit and cowardice
To the Editor:
We should like to congratulate the "Four Disgusted
Students" on their letter published in The Daily yes
terday. Whether or not one agrees with their opin
ions, he can hardly but admire a magnificent example
of wit and cowardice.
It would be interesting to know who are these par
agons who feel morally obliged to cast the first stone,
and even more fascinating to understand how such
staunch supporters of democracy and their Funda
mental Standard reconcile their choice of anonymity
with their high ideals.
We must sympathize, however, with these gentle
men who were truly unfortunate in that the Daily
staff displayed such poor judgment as to publish
their communication.

joke or hypocrisy?
To the Editor:
The letter of "Four Disgusted Graduate Students"
about the incident involving the smashing of four
cars by Hugh Smith, the graduate class president,
shows either a warped sense of humor or a thor
oughly hypocritical attitude, since we are discounting
the possibility of finding four graduate teetotalers.
If the letter was intended to be funny, it missed
its point since there are some things one ought not to
joke about.
On the other hand, if the letter stems from hy
pocrisy we suggest respectfully that the authors (who
tlid not have the courage to sign their names) do
some soul searching themselves.
