Does the Bookstore adequately serve your
needs?
It probably does if you go there to buy beer
mugs, fingernail polish remover, stuffed dolls,
salt arid pepper shakers, and other novelty trin
kets which take up about one-fifth of the store.
Bui have you ever tried to buy books, espe
cially at the beginning of each quarter? You
can stand m line two hours and not even get
one book.
There are many students even now who
haven't got all their books for this quarter. The
student is faced with a dilemma —that of stand
ing in long lines at the beginning of registration
week or waiting until the line gets short when
there is a chance that the Bookstore will not
have the books.
The reason for the long lines is obvious: the
enrollment has outgrown the size of the store.
The same Bookstore served Stanford when the
enrollment was half of what it is today.
The reason for the lack of books is not so
clear. There are not enough books to go around
for many courses".
Why is this so? The professors admit that
they are partly to blame for some of the "mis
calculation" in the number of books necessary
for their students.
Are the professors fully responsible? What
do you think?
In an effort to find whether or not the Book
store does serve its purpose adequately, The
Daily interviewed students and faculty.
Here are seme of the views and suggestions
of those interviewed:
Greg McCurdy, '58: "I think that the campus
Bookstore adequately supplies the needs of the
tudent at all times except the initial week or
:.o of the quarter. Perhaps there should be a
br. rich store (such as the one set up for the
freshmen this year) for cach class at the begin
ning of the quarter."
Pro!asset David C. Qegnery, Biology: "The
mistakes that are sometimes made regarding
book supplies are often the result of mistaken
estimates of needed books on the part of the
departments involved."
Sandy Robbin, '59: "During registration time
when everyone wants to buy his books, two
Look lines could be used instead of only one."
Jerry Lenthall, graduate: "I have been wait
ing .since Oct. 1 for a book, "Numerical Calcu
lus," which I need for one of my classes. The

Bookstore doesn't seem to have the facilities to
handle the needs of a campus this large."
Jack Leider, '56: "The only thing I don't like
is standing in line."
Edward Forner, graduate: "The people that
work in there don't know their store. They
need a staff that knows what books are there."
Mary Jo Elliott, '57: "The Bookstore serves
my needs if I have the patience to wait to be
served."
Richard Cheu, '59: "The Bookstore fills all
ihe school needs but lacks personal items like
shoe laces, shoe polish, and Kleenex. You can
get these things at the Student Union, but you
can't get rebates."
Miss Grace Knopp, instructor in Spanish:
"Sometimes not enough books have been or
dered for a class. But that hasn't always been
the Bookstore's fault; sometimes it's been the
fault of us teachers."
Richard Cornew, graduate: "Occasionally
the Bookstore doesn't have all the books I need,
but that's usually the fault of the Eookstore's
suppliers, not of the store itself."
Carolyn Fratessa, '57: "I find that the Book
store is adequately equipped, but that some
thing should be done about the time one has
to spend in line. Perhaps this situation could
be remedied by more space."
Chris Houser, '58: "Perhaps some of the ex
tra services in the Bookstore such as novelty
sales and watch repair could be moved out in
order to make more room for book storage."
What is the Bookstore doing about the exist
ing problem of the lack of books?
For the answer to the question, The Daily
asked Professor George S. Parks, president ol
the Bookstore board of directors.
Parks said, "The board of directors feels that
the Bookstore needs about twice as much floor
space as it now has to adequately serve Stan
ford's needs."
He stated that a new building could be con
structed to the southwest of the existing build
ing to be financed by the Bookstore or built by
the University and rented to the Bookstore.
He added ihat another alternative of building
an addition to the present building in the adja
cent alley has been considered.
"A fund of SIOO,OOO has been set aside for
these projects," Parks continued. "The alter
native have been considered for about a year,
but they are still in the planning stage."

What do you think?
Does the Bookstore adequately serve your
needs?
It probably does if you go there to buy beer
mugs, fingernail polish remover, stuffed dolls,
salt arid pepper shakers, and other novelty trin
kets which take up about one-fifth of the store.
Bui have you ever tried to buy books, espe
cially at the beginning of each quarter? You
can stand m line two hours and not even get
one book.
There are many students even now who
haven't got all their books for this quarter. The
student is faced with a dilemma —that of stand
ing in long lines at the beginning of registration
week or waiting until the line gets short when
there is a chance that the Bookstore will not
have the books.
The reason for the long lines is obvious: the
enrollment has outgrown the size of the store.
The same Bookstore served Stanford when the
enrollment was half of what it is today.
The reason for the lack of books is not so
clear. There are not enough books to go around
for many courses".
Why is this so? The professors admit that
they are partly to blame for some of the "mis
calculation" in the number of books necessary
for their students.
Are the professors fully responsible? What
do you think?
In an effort to find whether or not the Book
store does serve its purpose adequately, The
Daily interviewed students and faculty.
Here are seme of the views and suggestions
of those interviewed:
Greg McCurdy, '58: "I think that the campus
Bookstore adequately supplies the needs of the
tudent at all times except the initial week or
:.o of the quarter. Perhaps there should be a
br. rich store (such as the one set up for the
freshmen this year) for cach class at the begin
ning of the quarter."
Pro!asset David C. Qegnery, Biology: "The
mistakes that are sometimes made regarding
book supplies are often the result of mistaken
estimates of needed books on the part of the
departments involved."
Sandy Robbin, '59: "During registration time
when everyone wants to buy his books, two
Look lines could be used instead of only one."
Jerry Lenthall, graduate: "I have been wait
ing .since Oct. 1 for a book, "Numerical Calcu
lus," which I need for one of my classes. The

Bookstore doesn't seem to have the facilities to
handle the needs of a campus this large."
Jack Leider, '56: "The only thing I don't like
is standing in line."
Edward Forner, graduate: "The people that
work in there don't know their store. They
need a staff that knows what books are there."
Mary Jo Elliott, '57: "The Bookstore serves
my needs if I have the patience to wait to be
served."
Richard Cheu, '59: "The Bookstore fills all
ihe school needs but lacks personal items like
shoe laces, shoe polish, and Kleenex. You can
get these things at the Student Union, but you
can't get rebates."
Miss Grace Knopp, instructor in Spanish:
"Sometimes not enough books have been or
dered for a class. But that hasn't always been
the Bookstore's fault; sometimes it's been the
fault of us teachers."
Richard Cornew, graduate: "Occasionally
the Bookstore doesn't have all the books I need,
but that's usually the fault of the Eookstore's
suppliers, not of the store itself."
Carolyn Fratessa, '57: "I find that the Book
store is adequately equipped, but that some
thing should be done about the time one has
to spend in line. Perhaps this situation could
be remedied by more space."
Chris Houser, '58: "Perhaps some of the ex
tra services in the Bookstore such as novelty
sales and watch repair could be moved out in
order to make more room for book storage."
What is the Bookstore doing about the exist
ing problem of the lack of books?
For the answer to the question, The Daily
asked Professor George S. Parks, president ol
the Bookstore board of directors.
Parks said, "The board of directors feels that
the Bookstore needs about twice as much floor
space as it now has to adequately serve Stan
ford's needs."
He stated that a new building could be con
structed to the southwest of the existing build
ing to be financed by the Bookstore or built by
the University and rented to the Bookstore.
He added ihat another alternative of building
an addition to the present building in the adja
cent alley has been considered.
"A fund of SIOO,OOO has been set aside for

space as it now has to adequately serve Stan
ford's needs."
He stated that a new building could be con
structed to the southwest of the existing build
ing to be financed by the Bookstore or built by
the University and rented to the Bookstore.
He added ihat another alternative of building
an addition to the present building in the adja
cent alley has been considered.
"A fund of SIOO,OOO has been set aside for
these projects," Parks continued. "The alter
native have been considered for about a year,
but they are still in the planning stage."
What do you think?
Does the Bookstore adequately serve your
needs?
It probably does if you go there to buy beer
mugs, fingernail polish remover, stuffed dolls,
salt arid pepper shakers, and other novelty trin
kets which take up about one-fifth of the store.
Bui have you ever tried to buy books, espe
cially at the beginning of each quarter? You
can stand m line two hours and not even get
one book.
There are many students even now who
haven't got all their books for this quarter. The
student is faced with a dilemma —that of stand
ing in long lines at the beginning of registration
week or waiting until the line gets short when
there is a chance that the Bookstore will not
have the books.
The reason for the long lines is obvious: the
enrollment has outgrown the size of the store.
The same Bookstore served Stanford when the
enrollment was half of what it is today.
The reason for the lack of books is not so
clear. There are not enough books to go around
for many courses".
Why is this so? The professors admit that
they are partly to blame for some of the "mis
calculation" in the number of books necessary
for their students.
Are the professors fully responsible? What
do you think?
In an effort to find whether or not the Book
store does serve its purpose adequately, The
Daily interviewed students and faculty.
Here are seme of the views and suggestions
of those interviewed:
Greg McCurdy, '58: "I think that the campus
Bookstore adequately supplies the needs of the
tudent at all times except the initial week or
:.o of the quarter. Perhaps there should be a
br. rich store (such as the one set up for the
freshmen this year) for cach class at the begin
ning of the quarter."
Pro!asset David C. Qegnery, Biology: "The
mistakes that are sometimes made regarding
book supplies are often the result of mistaken
estimates of needed books on the part of the
departments involved."
Sandy Robbin, '59: "During registration time
when everyone wants to buy his books, two
Look lines could be used instead of only one."
Jerry Lenthall, graduate: "I have been wait
ing .since Oct. 1 for a book, "Numerical Calcu
lus," which I need for one of my classes. The

Bookstore doesn't seem to have the facilities to
handle the needs of a campus this large."
Jack Leider, '56: "The only thing I don't like
is standing in line."
Edward Forner, graduate: "The people that
work in there don't know their store. They
need a staff that knows what books are there."
Mary Jo Elliott, '57: "The Bookstore serves
my needs if I have the patience to wait to be
served."
Richard Cheu, '59: "The Bookstore fills all
ihe school needs but lacks personal items like
shoe laces, shoe polish, and Kleenex. You can
get these things at the Student Union, but you
can't get rebates."
Miss Grace Knopp, instructor in Spanish:
"Sometimes not enough books have been or
dered for a class. But that hasn't always been
the Bookstore's fault; sometimes it's been the
fault of us teachers."
Richard Cornew, graduate: "Occasionally
the Bookstore doesn't have all the books I need,
but that's usually the fault of the Eookstore's
suppliers, not of the store itself."
Carolyn Fratessa, '57: "I find that the Book
store is adequately equipped, but that some
thing should be done about the time one has
to spend in line. Perhaps this situation could
be remedied by more space."
Chris Houser, '58: "Perhaps some of the ex
tra services in the Bookstore such as novelty
sales and watch repair could be moved out in
order to make more room for book storage."
What is the Bookstore doing about the exist
ing problem of the lack of books?
For the answer to the question, The Daily
asked Professor George S. Parks, president ol
the Bookstore board of directors.
Parks said, "The board of directors feels that
the Bookstore needs about twice as much floor
space as it now has to adequately serve Stan
ford's needs."
He stated that a new building could be con
structed to the southwest of the existing build
ing to be financed by the Bookstore or built by
the University and rented to the Bookstore.
He added ihat another alternative of building
an addition to the present building in the adja
cent alley has been considered.
"A fund of SIOO,OOO has been set aside for
these projects," Parks continued. "The alter
native have been considered for about a year,
but they are still in the planning stage."
