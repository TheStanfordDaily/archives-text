# Financial Assistance Is Aim of Farm Scholarships
## University Uses Dean's List to Reward Students for Scholastic Achievement 
### FRANK HUNTRESS 
One of the greatest misconceptions concerning scholarships is
that they are given only as awards for scholastic achievement.
According to Scholarship Secretary Mrs. Olivia B. Bvler, the pri
mary aim of the scholarship is to aid those who need financial
assistance and otherwise could not attend Stanford.

The annual dean's and honors at
j entrance lists are the means which
j the University uses to, reward all
the distinguished students for their
j achievement.
At Stanford there are three princi
pal classifications of scholarshipsâ€”
the graduate fellowship and scholar
ship, the undergraduate scholarship,
I and the loans and grants-in-aid pro
; gram.
All three classes of awards are
| handled by the committee on finan
j cial awards.
COMMITTEE
This committee judges the appli
cant's need, scholastic record and
personal qualifications as a basis for
| granting the scholarship.
Athletic grants are made through
i the alumni's Buck Club.
Thirteen hundred high school
graduates applied for scholarships to
Stanford this year.
The number that applied is even
greater than the total number of
I students admitted to the Class of
1959. Only 107 scholarships were
awalded.
There were 283 scholarships
! awarded to matriculated Stanford
students out of 517 persons applying.
This year approximately $300,000
I was awarded to students for under
j graduate scholarships. This money is
| doled out to individuals on the basis
| of need.
AVERAGE SCHOLARSHIP
The average scholarship runs from
$200 to $1,650 per year. Most of the
j money is used towarci tuition.

Mrs. Bylsr said that there are two
methods by which money is received
for scholarships: cash and endow
ments.
Endowments injure the scholar
ship perpetual existence through the
accumulation of interest on securi
t:33 purchased from the endowment.
These cash or endowed scholar
ships are received principally from
the board of trustees, corporations,
alumni clubs, bequeaths, and indi
vidual donations.
Most oi the undergraduate schol
arships are awarded on a one-year
basis. Renewal depends on whether
or not the student has maintained
at least a "B" average while at Stan
ford.
This year all the 157 renewal ap
plications were accepted.
