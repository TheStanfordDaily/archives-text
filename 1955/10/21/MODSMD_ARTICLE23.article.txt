# Ram's Head Revue Uses New Talent
## Acts Furnished On Short Notice 
### TERRY COMITO 
"What we're doing," said
Ram's Head President Bill Scott,
"is casting our Gaieties and our
Spring shows two years ahead."
He was talking about the new
Ram's Head Revue.
"Freshmen and even sophomores,"
he explained, "may not be able to
qualify for our big main-stage pro
ductions: for lack of time or of ex
perience— not for lack of talent.
That's where the Revue comes in.
It's a training ground, and it's set
up to involve a minimum of rehear
sal time."
The Revue will utilize the talents
of students in every aspect of the
theater — writers, designers, crew
members, musicians, actors, dancers,
singers, directors—"everything."
Individual acts will be put on file
and "dealt" into programs as calls
for entertainment come in from local
service clubs, high schools and cam
pus groups.
Revue members will work in close
collaboration with Ram's Head mem
bers, and every program will be
followed by "critiques" at which the
specific problems and solutions of
the show will be discussed.
"The scheduled interviews are
over," said Scott, "but we always
want to talk to anybody and at any
time. Right now, especially, we need
writers of all kinds—actual or po
tential, experienced or not."
But the training ground aspect of
the Revue is just one side of the new
system.
"The incorporation of the Revue
as a major Ram's Head production,"
Scott said, "means that for the first
time any club, any group or party
of any kind can. on short notice,
have virtually any kind of enter
tainment. And first-rate entertain
ment, at that. The opportunity of the
Ram's Head Revue is a double one."
