THE PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN THE SMOOCH

Back in my courting days (the raccoon coat was all the rage,
everybody was singing Good Morning, Mr. '/-tp, Z'P, Zip and
young Honaparte had just left Corsica) back, I say, in my court
ing days, the standard way to melt a girl's heart was to write
poetry to her.
Young men today have abandoned this gambit, and 1 must
say I don't understand why. Nothing is quite as effective as
.poetry for moving a difficult girl. What's more, poems are
ridiculously easy to write. The range of subject matter is end
less. You can write a poem about a girl's hair, her eyes, her nose,
her lips, her teeth, her walk, her talk, her clothes, her shoes
anything at all. Indeed, one of my most lambent love lyrics was
called To Mattel's Pencil Box. It went like this:
In your dear little leatherette pencil box
Are pencils of yellow and red,
And if yon don't tell we you lore me soon,
I'll hit you on top of the head.
Honesty compels me to admit that this poem fell short of
success. Nothing daunted, I wrote another one. 'lhis time I
nulled a switch; 1 threatened myself instead of Maud
Oh, Maud, pray stop this drivel
And tell me you'll be mine,
For my sweetbreads they do shrivel
And wind around my spine.
My heart doth cease its beating.
My spleen uncoils and warps.
My liver stops secreting.
Soon I needs be a corpse.
When this heart-rending ballad failed to move Maud, I could
only conclude that she was cruel and heartless and that 1 was
better off without her. Accordingly, I took back mv Hi-Y pin,
bid her adieu, and have not clapped eyes upon her since. Last I
heard of her, she was in North Scituate, Rhode Island, working
as a clam sorter.

But I did not mourn Maud long, for after Maud came Doris-
Doris of the laughing eyes, Doris of the shimmering hair, Doris
of the golden tibiae! Within moments of meeting her, 1 whipped
'jp a torrent of trochaic tetrameter:
Oh, my sweet and dulcet uor..
You're gentle as a Philip Morris.
With its mild and rich tobacco
And its white and scarlet pack-o,
Both in regular and king-size.
Doris, tell me please your ring size.
Well, of course, the poor girl couldn't resist a poem like that—
what girl could?—and she instantly became my slave. For the
rest of the semester she carried my books, washed my car, and
cored my apples. There's no telling where it all would have
ended if she hadn't been drafted.
So, men, you can see the efficacy of poetry as an aid to wooing.
Try it soon. All you need is a rhyming dictionary, a quill pen,
and a second-hand muse. © M " shuimtn, 1955

.poetry for moving a difficult girl. What's more, poems are
ridiculously easy to write. The range of subject matter is end
less. You can write a poem about a girl's hair, her eyes, her nose,
her lips, her teeth, her walk, her talk, her clothes, her shoes
anything at all. Indeed, one of my most lambent love lyrics was
called To Mattel's Pencil Box. It went like this:
In your dear little leatherette pencil box
Are pencils of yellow and red,
And if yon don't tell we you lore me soon,
I'll hit you on top of the head.
Honesty compels me to admit that this poem fell short of
success. Nothing daunted, I wrote another one. 'lhis time I
nulled a switch; 1 threatened myself instead of Maud
Oh, Maud, pray stop this drivel
And tell me you'll be mine,
For my sweetbreads they do shrivel
And wind around my spine.
My heart doth cease its beating.
My spleen uncoils and warps.
My liver stops secreting.
Soon I needs be a corpse.
When this heart-rending ballad failed to move Maud, I could
only conclude that she was cruel and heartless and that 1 was
better off without her. Accordingly, I took back mv Hi-Y pin,
bid her adieu, and have not clapped eyes upon her since. Last I
heard of her, she was in North Scituate, Rhode Island, working
as a clam sorter.

But I did not mourn Maud long, for after Maud came Doris-
Doris of the laughing eyes, Doris of the shimmering hair, Doris
of the golden tibiae! Within moments of meeting her, 1 whipped
'jp a torrent of trochaic tetrameter:
Oh, my sweet and dulcet uor..
You're gentle as a Philip Morris.
With its mild and rich tobacco
And its white and scarlet pack-o,
Both in regular and king-size.
Doris, tell me please your ring size.
Well, of course, the poor girl couldn't resist a poem like that—
what girl could?—and she instantly became my slave. For the
rest of the semester she carried my books, washed my car, and
cored my apples. There's no telling where it all would have
ended if she hadn't been drafted.
So, men, you can see the efficacy of poetry as an aid to wooing.
Try it soon. All you need is a rhyming dictionary, a quill pen,

THE PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN THE SMOOCH

Back in my courting days (the raccoon coat was all the rage,
everybody was singing Good Morning, Mr. '/-tp, Z'P, Zip and
young Honaparte had just left Corsica) back, I say, in my court
ing days, the standard way to melt a girl's heart was to write
poetry to her.
Young men today have abandoned this gambit, and 1 must
say I don't understand why. Nothing is quite as effective as
