# Gaieties Tickets Are Still Available
## 
### 
Ticket applications for the 1955
Big Game Gaieties continue to be
available now at the ASSU office in
the Nitery, Memorial Hall box office
and from social chairmen of all liv
ing groups.
"The new mail-order system," ac
cording to Ram's Head business
manager Don Yates, "is intended
purely as a student convenience.
"We felt, in view of" our greatly
expanded off - campus mail - order
drive, that something was needed to
give students a fair chance at tick
ets."
Orders are filled in order of their
postmark, Yates said, and no seats
are held back.
"We hope," he said, "that the bulk
of the tickets can be sold in this way.
Not many seats will still be available
when the box office sales begin on
Nov. 7."
