# Dramatic Movies Reach Peak in 'Trial'
## 
### STEW TOY 
If the dramatic motion picture
is considered as an evolutionary
phenomenon, the directors of
"Trial" seem to have gone about
as far as they can go.
For sheer suspense, this story of
race prejudice in a sex murder trial
is perfection. The technique used in
its production seems to be the cli
max of everything intelligent Holly
wood could glean from a long line
of would-be thrillers.
And its impact, achieved largely
through the enlightened use of raw
black - and - white photography, is

fc conclusive proof
of the now-old
adage: the wide
screen Technicolor
| extravaganza is not
the end of the
world. Nor is it
r even adequate.
'Color just isn't
profound, and
"T ri a l's" intense

courtroom scenes would lose most
of their edge if filmed a la Goldwyn.
FROM NOVEL
Now playing at the Varsity Thea
ter, "Trial" is an adaptation of Don
Mankiewicz's prize-winning novel.
Its plot concerns a 14-year-old
Mexican boy, Angel Chavez, on trial
in a small, narrow-minded town for
the murder of a white girl.
The boy (Juano Hernandez, hero
of "Blackboard Jungle"), as yet un
acquainted with the mechanics of
sex, is amazed that people think him
capable of the attempted rape-mur
der of one of his classmates.

Yet the town's power-mad brain
trust, mindful of property values,
endeavor to convict him so as to
spur the lethargic on to residential
segregation.
RED LAWYER
Aided by the boy's conniving
Communist lawyer, they succeed in
the conviction, notwithstanding some
effective grandstand playing by col
lege law professor Glenn Ford, who
is assigned to the case as a summer
exercise by the Commie.
The role of an idealistic professor,
thrown by his university's insist
ence for practicel experience into
the breach of dirty politicking, suits
Ford perfectly. It is his finest hour.
Sidelight of the picture, a perfect
little story in itself, is the "Free
Angel Committee's" fund-raising
rally in New York City. Ford naive
ly flies to the rally, sponsored by the
All Peoples' Party, only to discover
it a hotbed of fellow travelers.
"SEA OF GREEN"
The bickering behind the scenes
as to who gets what percentage of
the take, the all-too-typical "Sea of
Green" money-raising technique, and
the mercenary antics of an eager
woman member of the "original
Philadelphia eight" are hilariously
satiric but biting touches.
All around, "Trial" is a gigantic
and very successful effort.
