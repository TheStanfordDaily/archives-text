# $15,000 Grant Given to Print Terman Book
## Gift from Ford Education Fund

A $15,000 grant from the Fund for
the Advancement of Education will
finance preparation of a fifth volume
in the Terman studies of gifted chil
dren, President Wallace Sterling has
announced.
Lewis M. Terman, emeritus pro
fessor of psychology and education
here, said he expects the new vol
ume will be published some time in
1957. Previous books in the series
have become classic reference works.
Published by the Stanford Uni
versity Press, they have gone into
several printings and have influ
enced the thinking of psychologists
and educators about the true nature
and needs of gifted children.
In lieu of royalties to the authors,
all profits from the books have been
used to help finance the continued
research.
Professor Terman and his associ
ates have followed closely the ca
reers of his gifted subjects ever since
they were selected 34 years ago on
the basis of IQ tests that rated them
in the top 1 per cent of the school
population.
The new book will summarize ex
tensive information obtained during
the last 10 years from more than
1,400 men and women of the group
by repeated tests, personal inter
views and periodic reports covering
almost every aspect of their lives.
At a recent meeting of the Ameri
can Psychological Association in San
Francisco, the psychologist revealed
a few high points regarding the
present status of the group at the
average age of 44 years.
These included marked superiority
in physical and mental health and
great superiority in economic status,
education and all-around achieve
ment A great majority of the sub
jects recently scored higher on in
telligence tests than they had a
dozen years earlier.
Beside giving detailed information
about these and other matters, the
new book will examine the gifted
group in respect to their contribu
tions as citizens, their social and
marital adjustments, and the intelli
gence of their children as indicated
by Stanford-Binet tests.
The Fund for the Advancement of
Education is an independent corpo
ration established by the Ford Foun
dation.
