# Frosh Seek Bonfire Wood
## 
### 
With the Big Game fast approach
ing, freshmen are now seeking wood
donations for the traditional bonfire.
Members of the freshman class
will erect the huge pyre on the dry
bed of Lake Lagunita for lighting
at the rally Nov. 17 as part of a fes
tive week preceding the game.
Willard Harry of Woodside has
donated the brush cleared from an
850-acre subdivision, so the fresh
men will be well supplied with this
ingredient.
But Steve Ralph, chairman of the
bonfire, has issued a special request
for scrap lumber and cardboard car
tons. The students will particularly
need 2 by 4's, 2 by 12's and 4 by 4's.
Anyone who can donate is asked
to call DAvenport 4-0591 between 1
and 4 p.m. daily. Arrangements will
be made to pick up the lumber in
trucks beginning Saturday.
