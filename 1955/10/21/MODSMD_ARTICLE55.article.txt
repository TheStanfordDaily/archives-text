## 
### DICK NICHOLS 
The Stanford soccer team in
vades San Jose tomorrow to take
on the San Jose Stale Spartans.
The Indians will be looking for
their third straight conference
victory, whereas the Spartans
will be seeking their first.
So far the soccermen from the
Farm have edged Hermania AC of
San Leandro in an exhibition, after
which they defeated Santa Clara,
8-2, and San Francisco State, 3-2.
San Jose last week lost to USF,
6-1, but Indian coach Fred Priddle
says that this score is not a true in
dication of the Spartans' strength,
as USF is the conference defending
champion.
TOP FULLBACK
The Spartans boast one of the
league's top fullbacks by the name
oi Bub Critelli, who is reported to
be one of the best defensive men in
the nation. This is only the second
year since the end of World War II
that San Jose State has fielded a
soccer team, and the Spartans figure
to get better and better as they get
more experience.
The varsity tilt will start at 10:30
a.m. in San Jose, with the JV game
beginning at 9 a.m.
The probable Indian starting front
right wing, Peter Wong at inside
right, Bill Wren at center forward,
Charlie Annicq at inside left, and
Dick Bubb at left wing.
Peter Mack, Don Yates, and Bob
Spare will start at hallbacks, with
Skip Lord and either Art Harlow or
Danny Cortez at the fullback spots.
Jim Montgomery will open at goalie.
Next week will show the Indians
meeting USF in what could be the
most crucial game of the season for
the Stanford hooters. As defending
champions, USF will fielfl one of
the strongest teams in the league.
The Dons have already clubbed San
Jose, 6-1. Coach Priddle feels that
if the Indians could get by USF,
they would have the spirit possibly
to go all the way to an undefeated
season.
INDIANS MEET DONS
Stanford meets the Dons as part
of a double-header on Oct. 29 in
San Francisco on the Balboa Park
field. Also playing in this game will
be San Jose State and Cal.
The Indians, as of now, are tied
for the league lead with Cal. each
team having two conference victo
ries to its credit. Also undefeated
are USF and City College of San
Francisco, with one.,conference vie
! apiece.
