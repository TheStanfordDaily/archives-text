j student leaders believe the social
procedures are detailed and "un

Miss Fitzgerald explained that the

outmoded rules not because of
agreement but because students
have accepted them.
IMPROVEMENT MONEY
In approving the use of improve
ment fund money for Quad office
painting LASSU went round and
round on the question of whether or
not painting could be considered a
permanent improvement. (The hy
. laws read that improvement fund
I monies can be used only for per
j manent improvements.) Student
i Manager Bill Tooley didn't think so,
J but Tom Dant, Quad editor, did.
After some pleading by Dant and
Quad Business Manager Don Good
rich. LASSU passed the motion au
thorizing a $95 expenditure from the
I fund.

At Wednesday night's regular meeting the ASSU Legislature
began its new practice of devoting the first 15 minutes of each ses
sion to NSA discussion.

lature should discuss NSA problems on both the national and local

Ralph commented that he had men
tioned the matter to Athletic Direc

i tremely difficult" to get anything
done.
He pointed out that he had at
tempted to contact Alumni Associa
tion officers on the possibility of
financing the trips, but hadn't as yet
I been able to reach them.

Ralph also announced the ap
pointment of Jack Richardson as
head of a committee, as yet un
named. which is to look into the
general social life on eampus to as
certain whether there is too much
emchasis on activities, especially for
freshmen.
A last-minute attempt to get a
constitutional amendment on next
week's ballot failed. The proposed
amendment dealt with having the
head cheer leader be directly elected
rather than having nominees for the
post go through a screening commit
tee.
Administrative Assistant Erie
LFricker rushed through the propo
sal, it was passed by LASSU, and
Ralph noted it as "passed."
However, after the Legislature
had adjourned, Fricker checked the
constitution and found that a two
thirds vote of the Legislature was
necessary .to pass it, not two-thirds
of a quorum as he had supposed.
Hence, the last - ditch effort failed
and it may not come before the stu
dent body until spring.
