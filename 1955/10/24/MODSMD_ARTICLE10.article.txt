# I. Magnin Shop Construction To Start Nov. 1
## 
### 
Construction will begin Nov. 1 on
an I. Magnin branch store in the
Stanford Shopping Center, accord
ing to Eric Stanford, vice-president
of the I? Magnin organization.
The final lease, which includes de
tailed building plans, was signed last
week with Stanford, and bids were
opened Wednesday for the contract.
The contract will be awarded today
for the 50,000-square-foot project,
Stanford said.
When construction begins on the
I. Magnin building, eight of the nine
proposed buildings in the shopping
center will be under way, said Alf
E. Brandin, University business
manager. ,
Negotiations concerning the final
building, one of the smaller projects,
are not yet complete.
The nation-wide I. Magnin organi
zation, which specializes in women's
apparel, has several branch stores in
California, including one in San
Francisco.
Approximately 50 tenants are
scheduled to lease stores in the
shopping center, which is expected
to be completed sometime this
spring.
Brandin said that in planning the
landscaping, and especially tree lo
cation, a compromise has been found
between two problems, those of re
taining natural beauty in the campus
area without decreasing the effec
tiveness of the parking areas.
