## 
### 
WASHlNGTONâ€”Republican Na
tional Chairman Leonard W. Hall
accused Adlai E. Stevenson today of
"playing cheap politics" with farm
ers by doing a "flip-flop" on the
farm price support issue.
Hall, who also blasted Governor
Averell Harriman, another Demo
cratic Presidential possibility,
charged that Stevenson bowed to
pressure from party bosses and en
dorsed rigid HO per cent price props
after first rejecting them.
"Mr. Stevenson's retreat from his
oft-expressed criticism of rigid 90
per cent supports represents a tem
porary victory, at least, for the
Democrat bosses who may have felt
he was unveiling the party's real
orogram too early," Hall .said.
. . When pressure from the
Democratic National Committee and
other party heads became too strong,
he completely reversed himself."
