NEW YORK—Governor Goodwin
Knight of California said today the
Republican party has "a score or
more" of men who could win the
Presidency next year but he is for
President Eisenhower "first, last,
and always."
If Mr. Eisenhower decides not to
run he should pick the candidate he
wants if he thinks such a course is
wise, the Republican Governor said.
Because of the confidence reposed in
Mr. Eisenhower, his choice would he
accepted by the party, Knight added.
Knight said the "ideal" Republi
can candidate should be a "progres
sive moderate."
Asked if Viee-Presidcnt Richard
Nixon meets the description "pro
gressive moderate," Knight said he
had not thought about the matter
carefully. But he said the Vicc-
Prc: ident has followed the Eisen
hower program and is "a very dis
tinguished Californian."
