# Bay Area Rallies Give Gendarmerie Rough Night of It

### JACK BYRNE 
Pre - game exuberance for the
USC-Cal tilt made life interesting
—if a bit difficult—for Bay Area Jaw
enforcement officers.
Friday night a UC rally broke up
on schedule, but a crowd of 400
male scholars, intent on breaking up
Berkeley, carried on with their own
high spirits.
Before 20 Berkeley police, five
campus officials and a battalion of
firemen were through, four Cal men
were hustled off to the pokey for
charges ranging from "starting an
illegal bonfire" to disturbing II
peace and obstructing an officer.
The bonfire charges arose from the
indiscriminate torching of Berkeley
hedges by the overenthused .stu
dents.
Across the bay, San Francisco po
lice had their difficulties with the
USC delegation. Water service to
some student rooms in a downtown
hotel was shut off when water
bragging became an overpopular
sport.
Later, police answered a- riot rail
at Union Square as a rally there got
out of hand.
Thirteen squad cars were mobi
lized and rushed to the area, alon
with motorcycles, when students at
tempted to overturn a cable car in
front of the St. Francis Hotel.
Three paddy wagon loads of rev
elers were given the Haul of Justice
to the Hall of Justice, where two
students were booked.
