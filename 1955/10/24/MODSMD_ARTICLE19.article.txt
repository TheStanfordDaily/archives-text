# Knowland Called Mixture: Leader and Individualist
## 
### JIM PALMER 
"He charges down the track like an angry freight train."
This is how William F. Knowland was once characterized by
a fellow Senator, the late Blair Moody.
Today, California's senior solon will charge onto campus to
speak on "United States Foreign Policy," a subject about which

'he has very determined views.
A curious mixture of party leader
and individualist, the 6-foot, 200-
pound Republican has commanded
much attention in political ranks
during his 10-year stay on Capitol
Hill.
SUPPORTER AND CRITIC
Both a supporter and a critic of
the Eisenhower Administration dur
ing the last three years. Knowland
presents a voting record marked
with apparent inconsistencies—a rec
ord which makes sense only if you
know the man himself.
During the first session of the 83rd
Congress he voted in support of the
Eisenhower legislative recommenda
tions 87 per cent of the time—second
highest among all Republicans.
In the 1954 second session he post
ed the highest Administration sup
port of any senator—9l per cent.
As remarkable as this record
seems, there are a number of nota
ble exceptions that have set Know
land aside from the Administration.
He voted for the Brieker Amend
ment, opposed attendance at Geneva
in 1954. advocated Red China block
ade, and has called for breaking off
of diplomatic relations with Russia.
"GET TOUGH'
He has advocated a "get tough"
policy in the Far East and has ve
hemently stood against acceptance
of Red China in the United Nations,
the organization which will be com
memorated by tonight's program.
He once stated that if Communist
China is voted into UN membership
he would devote his full efforts "to
terminate United States membership
in that organization and our finan
cial support to it."
Now at the age of 46, he occupies
the U. S. Senate minority leader's
seat and is being mentioned as a
possible candidate for the Repub
lican nomination.
REACHED TOP YOUNG
In 1945 soldier Knowland picked
up a European edition of Stars and
Stripes and learned he had been ap
pointed to the Senate by Earl War
ren to complete the term of the late
Hiram Johnson.
And so he became the youngest
senator in the history of Congress.
He stayed there, too, winning in
1946 and 1952 elections.
It has been a long road that the
heir to the Oakland Tribune has
traveled in a short time. Republi
cans are wondering how much far
ther he will go.
