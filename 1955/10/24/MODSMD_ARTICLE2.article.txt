# Cop Pulls Gun In Bar Melee, Students Say
## 
### 
Offiicals of Stanford University
and the San Mateo County Sheriff's
office reported late yesterday that
they had not been officially notified
of complaints from a number of stu
dents that a law enforcement officer
held a gun on them at Rossotti's Beer
Garden Friday.
Reports that an officer brandished
his service revolver at a group of
about 50 students gained currency
across campus during the week end,
but a spokesman of the San Mateo
County Sheriff's office said no official
report had been turned in on the
incident.
University officials said they, too,
were in the dark about the affair,
which concerned a State Department
of Alcoholic Beverage Control search
for false identification cards and
under-age drinkers.
Eyewitnesses say that ABC in
vestigators reportedly found an il
legal drinker at Rossotti's, picked
up his false ID and a beer bottle for
evidence, but that in the melee that
followed lost not only the evidence
but the accused youth as well.
According to the reports, when the
youth was placed under ABC cus
tody other patrons began hurling
peanuts around the bar. In the con
fusion that followed, the bottle being
held as evidence was smashed and
apparently someone picked the
pocket of the agent holding the ID.
When law enforcement officers be
came aware that the under-age
drinker they had been holding under
custody had fled, they gave chase up
the hill behind Rossotti's. The crowd
followed, and at the base of the hill
one of the officers pulled his gun.
warning the crowd to "stand back."
However, reports say, the youth
got away and the ABC left empty
handed. Meanwhile someone had
let the air out of the tires of one of
(he officers' cars and removed the
key which he had left in the car.
The key was given back after the
Beer Garden owner asked the crowd
for its return. He said he was inside
the bar at the time of the trouble
and "hadn't seen a thing."
