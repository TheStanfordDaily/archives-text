Today Stanford participates in United Na
tions Day. A college campus is perhaps the
best location for such an occasion, for here is
youth with its ideal of a brighter world.
Here we find few world cynics, few sword
wa,vers. The enlightened, educated youth of
today look toward co-operation as the means
of easing world tensions.
And so this week we honor the tenth anni
versary of an organization devoted to mutual
co operation as the means of easing that ten
sion. There are many who see use of the
United Nations as a feeble way to solve world
problems. But is there any other body in the
world today doing anything as nQar effective
as the UN, can there be?
We're young, we're idealistic, and maybe a
bit naive. We believe in any organization
which brings representatives of the world'r
people into a common meeting place. Some
thing has been accomplished through + his
common meeting.
The UN has helped ease five regional con
flicts, in the Balkans, in Kashmir, Palestine, and
Indonesia—and in Korea. Maybe not as strong
and decisively as we'd like, but an end was
made to these conflicts. Is that such a poor
rocord? And these are some visible results.
There are other accomplishments that can't be
seen, but they are there.
A great UN weapon is world public opinion.
The force of this opinion was shown clearly
last week. Russia's UN representatives, in a
move to discredit the U.S., presented demands
(or a world armament debate. Russia knew
that the smaller nations, which represent much
of world opinion, had had no time to evaluate

U.S.-USSR armament proposals put before them
in the foim of a voluminous report just that
day.
The United States also knew this and made
no plea for a hurried debate which would
merely bring out uninformed windy propa
ganda, not solid representative ideas coming
out of conscientious study.
As a small nation delegate said, "We | the
representatives | have the duty to represent
our people, not just speak for our leadership.'
Russia's proposal was voted down.
A veteran correspondent said, "World public
opinion is stronger than any atom bomb against
Russia." The UN represents world public opin
ion, many of those who would do away with
ihe UN represent the "atom bomb heorists."
Obviously the United Nations is one of the
free world's greatest weapons against the to
talitarian schemes of Russia. And one of the
world's greatest weapons for keeping the
peace, for keeping the atom bombs in the stock
piles, out of the skies.
It's a young group, it's growing. Possibly it's
too new for us to have learned how to use it
properly. Often we misunderstand its purpose,
its strength, its weakness.
It has done much toward bettering the world.
It can do more. But not until we understand
how to properly use its vast potential. Much
of that need for understanding rests with the
college student, looking to that enlightened
world of the future.
The United Nations is only a 10-year-old
child, it's still growing, let's grow along with it.
And let's start today, on this, United Nations
Day.

United Nations as a feeble way to solve world
problems. But is there any other body in the
world today doing anything as nQar effective
as the UN, can there be?
We're young, we're idealistic, and maybe a
bit naive. We believe in any organization
which brings representatives of the world'r
people into a common meeting place. Some
thing has been accomplished through + his
common meeting.
The UN has helped ease five regional con
flicts, in the Balkans, in Kashmir, Palestine, and
Indonesia—and in Korea. Maybe not as strong
and decisively as we'd like, but an end was
made to these conflicts. Is that such a poor
rocord? And these are some visible results.
There are other accomplishments that can't be
seen, but they are there.
A great UN weapon is world public opinion.
The force of this opinion was shown clearly
last week. Russia's UN representatives, in a
move to discredit the U.S., presented demands
(or a world armament debate. Russia knew
that the smaller nations, which represent much
of world opinion, had had no time to evaluate

U.S.-USSR armament proposals put before them
in the foim of a voluminous report just that
day.
The United States also knew this and made
no plea for a hurried debate which would
merely bring out uninformed windy propa
ganda, not solid representative ideas coming
out of conscientious study.
As a small nation delegate said, "We | the
representatives | have the duty to represent
our people, not just speak for our leadership.'
Russia's proposal was voted down.
A veteran correspondent said, "World public
opinion is stronger than any atom bomb against
Russia." The UN represents world public opin
ion, many of those who would do away with
ihe UN represent the "atom bomb heorists."
Obviously the United Nations is one of the
free world's greatest weapons against the to
talitarian schemes of Russia. And one of the
world's greatest weapons for keeping the
peace, for keeping the atom bombs in the stock
piles, out of the skies.
It's a young group, it's growing. Possibly it's
too new for us to have learned how to use it
properly. Often we misunderstand its purpose,
its strength, its weakness.
It has done much toward bettering the world.
It can do more. But not until we understand
how to properly use its vast potential. Much
of that need for understanding rests with the
college student, looking to that enlightened
world of the future.
The United Nations is only a 10-year-old
child, it's still growing, let's grow along with it.
And let's start today, on this, United Nations
Day.
Today Stanford participates in United Na
tions Day. A college campus is perhaps the
best location for such an occasion, for here is
youth with its ideal of a brighter world.
Here we find few world cynics, few sword
wa,vers. The enlightened, educated youth of
today look toward co-operation as the means
of easing world tensions.
And so this week we honor the tenth anni
versary of an organization devoted to mutual
co operation as the means of easing that ten
sion. There are many who see use of the
United Nations as a feeble way to solve world
problems. But is there any other body in the
