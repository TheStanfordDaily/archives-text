# this week on quad ...... earl cilley
## 
### 
Today is United Nations Day, of all things,
and in its commemoration the Poli Union and
the lIR are sponsoring a lecture by Senator
Bill Knowland, of all people. He's speaking
on "Foreign Policy of the United States" at
8 tonight in Mem Aud, and you ought to
think about going. It should be interesting.
It's vox populi time on Quad again. Yas, this
week you get to vote twice in the big ASSU
elections, once in the primaries today or to
morrow and again in the finals Thursday or
Friday. On the ticket are candidates for Leg
islature representatives, Men's and Women's
Council members, and frosh representatives.
It's free, it's fun, it's educational, so vote . . .
If you think you can take a second dose of
the old UN, or if mid-terms keep you out of
Mem Aud tonight, Professor James T. Watkins,
IV, is prepared to refresh your memory in a
Tuesday Evening Series lecture on "A Decade
of 'he United Nations," 7:30, Mem Aud.
Little Theater Matinee Wednesday will con
sist of various people doing readings of things
like O. Nash, 'Horatius at the Bridge," Nuni
Ferenklan, and stuff like that. One of the par
ticipants has even shaved off the beard he was
growing, just so it won't be too hairy . . . Any
way, it's at 4:15.
If you giggle when the kid next door pulls
wings off flies, or if you make a point of hitting
all the local wakes and funerals, better plan
on being in Cubberley Auditorium Wednesday
night at 7; the Cardinals are showing movies
of Ihe Washington game.
Wednesday night the Stanford Players open
iheir season with a four-night production of
"Amphitryon 38," a play by Jean Giraudoux
translated by S. N. Behrman. This is a very
clever, very amusing play and is probably one
of the- best pieces of theater to come your way
this fall. It's being given in the Little Theater/
ko if you plan to attend, it would be a good
thought to look into the ma'ter of tickets almost
immediately.

Row Carnival is Friday night, and if there's
somebody in the house who doesn't know what
that means, you soon will, you soon will. The
dollies get all worked up over it, and the pro
ceeds are all lor sweet charily, and it's a tradi
tion, so maybe you ought to think about going.
What's one night, anyway?
★ * *
Saturday afternoon, Stanford meets San Jose
State in Stanford Stadium, and just because
they give you rooters' tickets for free is no rea
son why it won't be a good, exciting game.
And as an added attraction, every high school
band for miles around is coming to horse
around during the half-time. The word is out
that the're bringing their pom-pom girls, so
come early and bring your field glassee . . .
* * ★
Wilbur is having its first formal Saturday
night, and if it's anything like the Encina for
mals used to be, wurra-wutra. Also brrrrh.
But maybe it'll be different, with new surround
ings, new faces. Hope so, anyway . . .

If chamber music is your passion, ol' Sandor
Salgo and the Music Department are brewing
up a little concert for Sunday afternoon at 4,
in' Cubberley Auditorium. If you like musical
afternoons, this is for you.
* * *
This week's Beautyrest Award winner is a
function to be held today at 4 in Room 320,
and it's called "Ground Water Behavior in a
Limestone Valley—A Case History," a lecture
by Dr. R. M. Foose. We're taking our camera—
how about you?
* * *
FLICKS NOTE: This time we got Humphrey
Bogart, yet, and some other guy named Hous
ton in a thing called "Treasure of the Sierra
Madre." This is kind of an oldish picture, but
the quality is supposed to be unusually good.
There are also two cartoons.

FACT OF THE WEEK: There are 10,050

of the- best pieces of theater to come your way
this fall. It's being given in the Little Theater/

Row Carnival is Friday night, and if there's

What's one night, anyway?

Saturday afternoon, Stanford meets San Jose
State in Stanford Stadium, and just because
they give you rooters' tickets for free is no rea

come early and bring your field glassee . . .

Wilbur is having its first formal Saturday

FLICKS NOTE: This time we got Humphrey

FACT OF THE WEEK: There are 10,050
