the treadmill
To the Editor:
Professor Stone's comments in Wednesday's Daily
bring to mind several facts which I believe demand
examining. Stanford's yearly social calendar is not
unlike a treadmill; the value of our many, many tra
ditional events and activities should be assessed.
As for the traditional events, haven't most of them
lo.it any mass appeal which they perhaps once had?
Is tradition a valid enough reason to continue going
through the motions of celebrating such events as
"Games Day"and "The Farm Follies"? I believe that
the time has come to take an inventory of them, par
ticularly with regard to the amount of interest that is
actually generated, and then to put those to rest that
cannot capture the attention of more than, say, one
hall of the students.
Turning to activities, how many still serve any
valid function or fulfill any present need or demand?
New activities seem to come and come and come, but

never go . . . Is it better to have a great number of
activities, meaningless or not, in order to allow as
large a group as possible to have social septus as
"activity administrators"? Or should we support only
those activities that fulfill a present demand or need?
The new committee on parking, for example, or The
Daily, are performing necessary functions; others
seem to do things because they exist, rather than
exist to do things.
The sensing of a need for activities with a purpose
rather than activities lor social status seemed to me
to manifest itself in last year's ASSU elections. I am
ol the opinion that the surprising success of George
Ralph's early campaign was based on a widely felt
sensing of this need.
If I am correct, and the blush of political success
has not changed his ideas, then I suggest that he add
just one more event to the social calendar. Let him
declare "Burial Day" on which all events and activi
ties declared obsolete by a vote of the Legislature are
officially laid to rest.
