# ASSU Committee Presents Traffic Problem Proposals
## Chairman Bob Maddock Outlines Two Plans For Solution of Quad Area Traffic Congestion 
### DICK MEISTER Associate Editor, The Daily 
Chairman Bob Maddcck of the newly-formed Traffic Committee
outlined his committee's proposals for campus traffic problem so
lution to the ASSU Legislature at its meeting last week.
Maddock presented two plans, one which his committee favors
and an alternate plan.
"The problem," Maddock said, "is traffic congestion on campus

because of unnecessary driving to
classes." He explained that his group
has five theories for solution under
Plan One. They are:
1. Ban all automobiles.
2. Block off the Quad to all traffic.
3. Ban certain groups from use of
Quad parking areas.
4. Ban certain groups from pos
session of autos (such as all fresh
men, etc.).
5. Make it a nuisance to drive in
the Quad area during class hours.
The committee's recommendations
on the basis of the proposal to make
Quad driving a nuisance include the
immediate reopening of Santa Teresa
Road.
OBSTACLES RECOMMENDED
He recommends, in place of closing
off Santa Teresa, the construction of
obstacles or stop signs in front of
Lagunjta. Committee reports state
that the theory of closing roads to
improve the traffic situation is
wrong.
Another recommendation is park
ing meter installation. Advantages
of meters, according to the commit
tee. are easier police checking and
collection of revenue. The funds
would be used for road and parking
facility improvement.
Committee plans call for two types
of meters, to be placed in different
campus areas. The inexpensive ones,
costing $30 each, would be placed in
the oval in front of Quad, in front
of Memorial Auditorium and Hoover
Library, in the library lot, along
the street opposite the temporary
buildings (Escondido to the corner
of Lasuen).
GEOLOGY CORNER
The same type would be used from
the Geology Corner on both sides of
the street to Santa Teresa, along
Santa Teresa on the side of Bowman
Alumni House, with the exception of
in front of Bowman and the Cellar
area.
Time limit on the meters would
be four hours, the cost 10 Cents, ft
would take 675 meters to cover the
areas. They would operate from 8
a.m. .to # 4 p.m.
Expensive meters ($6O each) would
be placed from Geology Corner to
History Corner on both sides of the
street excepting reserved parking
areas.
These meters would have a one
hour limit and cost 1 cent for 12
minutes, 5 cents for the hour. Two
hundred of these meters would be
needed, operating from 8 a.m. to 4
p.m. also. t
The committee also recommends
improving the library parking lot,

extending the chemistry lot to in
clude 100 more autos, and painting
lines on the streets to designate
parking spaces.
They call for possible mandatory
registration of all autos, by issuing
three types of parking stickers. One
type of sticker, issued to on-campus
students and costing $1 a year, would
allow the student free parking any
where on campus from 8 a.m. to 4
p.m. with the exception of meter
zones.
Another sticker would be issued
to ofT-eampus students and .staff en
titling them to free parking any
where but in the expensive meter
zones. Cost would be $5 a year.
The third type of sticker would
go to faculty members and disabled
students. Gost would be $1 and al
low reserved area parking.
VISITOR PARKING
In the matter of visitor parking,
the committee suggests that daytime
visitors would be willing to use
meter areas.
Other recommendations:
1. Taking up of two parking spaces
to bring a $2 fine.
2. Third offense for speeding to
bring about removal of driving priv
ileges for three months in addition
to the usual fine. A fourth offense
to bring removal for six months, and
fifth, removal of privileges for rest
of time on campus.
3. Speed limit on Palm Drive to
be increased to 35 m.p.h. from 0 p.m.
to 7 a.m.
FOUR-WAY STOP
4. A four-way stop opposite Phys
ics Corner at intersection of Lomita
and Serra Streets and at the inter
section of Serra and Galvez, near
Encina Hall.
5. Slowing devices to be installed
in the area between Wilbur and
Branner halls (because of the safety
hazard they, believe will develop
there after the peripheral road is
completed).
, 6. Adoption of pay fine envelopes
to facilitate collection.
Plan Two, the alternative 1o the
above proposals, includes building a
new parking lot around the corner
of Serra and Lomita roads opposite
Physics Corner, to accommodate 100
to 150 cars.

go to faculty members and disabled
students. Gost would be $1 and al
low reserved area parking.
VISITOR PARKING
In the matter of visitor parking,
the committee suggests that daytime
visitors would be willing to use
meter areas.
Other recommendations:
1. Taking up of two parking spaces
to bring a $2 fine.
2. Third offense for speeding to
bring about removal of driving priv
ileges for three months in addition
to the usual fine. A fourth offense
to bring removal for six months, and
fifth, removal of privileges for rest
of time on campus.
3. Speed limit on Palm Drive to
be increased to 35 m.p.h. from 0 p.m.
to 7 a.m.
FOUR-WAY STOP
4. A four-way stop opposite Phys
ics Corner at intersection of Lomita
and Serra Streets and at the inter
section of Serra and Galvez, near
Encina Hall.
5. Slowing devices to be installed
in the area between Wilbur and
Branner halls (because of the safety
hazard they, believe will develop
there after the peripheral road is
completed).
, 6. Adoption of pay fine envelopes
to facilitate collection.
Plan Two, the alternative 1o the
above proposals, includes building a
new parking lot around the corner
of Serra and Lomita roads opposite
Physics Corner, to accommodate 100
to 150 cars.
Chairman Bob Maddcck of the newly-formed Traffic Committee
outlined his committee's proposals for campus traffic problem so
lution to the ASSU Legislature at its meeting last week.
Maddock presented two plans, one which his committee favors
and an alternate plan.
"The problem," Maddock said, "is traffic congestion on campus

because of unnecessary driving to
classes." He explained that his group
has five theories for solution under
Plan One. They are:
1. Ban all automobiles.
2. Block off the Quad to all traffic.
3. Ban certain groups from use of
Quad parking areas.
4. Ban certain groups from pos
session of autos (such as all fresh
men, etc.).
5. Make it a nuisance to drive in
the Quad area during class hours.
The committee's recommendations
on the basis of the proposal to make
Quad driving a nuisance include the
immediate reopening of Santa Teresa
Road.
OBSTACLES RECOMMENDED
He recommends, in place of closing
off Santa Teresa, the construction of
obstacles or stop signs in front of
Lagunjta. Committee reports state
that the theory of closing roads to
improve the traffic situation is
wrong.
Another recommendation is park
ing meter installation. Advantages
of meters, according to the commit
tee. are easier police checking and
collection of revenue. The funds
would be used for road and parking
facility improvement.
Committee plans call for two types
of meters, to be placed in different
campus areas. The inexpensive ones,
costing $30 each, would be placed in
the oval in front of Quad, in front
of Memorial Auditorium and Hoover
Library, in the library lot, along
the street opposite the temporary
buildings (Escondido to the corner
of Lasuen).
GEOLOGY CORNER
The same type would be used from
the Geology Corner on both sides of
the street to Santa Teresa, along
Santa Teresa on the side of Bowman
Alumni House, with the exception of
in front of Bowman and the Cellar
area.
Time limit on the meters would
be four hours, the cost 10 Cents, ft
would take 675 meters to cover the
areas. They would operate from 8
a.m. .to # 4 p.m.
Expensive meters ($6O each) would
be placed from Geology Corner to
History Corner on both sides of the
street excepting reserved parking
areas.
These meters would have a one
hour limit and cost 1 cent for 12
minutes, 5 cents for the hour. Two
hundred of these meters would be
needed, operating from 8 a.m. to 4
p.m. also. t
The committee also recommends
improving the library parking lot,

extending the chemistry lot to in
clude 100 more autos, and painting
lines on the streets to designate
parking spaces.
They call for possible mandatory
registration of all autos, by issuing
three types of parking stickers. One
type of sticker, issued to on-campus
students and costing $1 a year, would
allow the student free parking any
where on campus from 8 a.m. to 4
p.m. with the exception of meter
zones.
Another sticker would be issued
to ofT-eampus students and .staff en
titling them to free parking any
where but in the expensive meter
zones. Cost would be $5 a year.
The third type of sticker would
go to faculty members and disabled
students. Gost would be $1 and al
low reserved area parking.

be four hours, the cost 10 Cents, ft
would take 675 meters to cover the
areas. They would operate from 8
a.m. .to # 4 p.m.
Expensive meters ($6O each) would
be placed from Geology Corner to
History Corner on both sides of the
street excepting reserved parking
areas.
These meters would have a one
hour limit and cost 1 cent for 12
minutes, 5 cents for the hour. Two
hundred of these meters would be
needed, operating from 8 a.m. to 4
p.m. also. t
The committee also recommends
improving the library parking lot,

extending the chemistry lot to in
clude 100 more autos, and painting
lines on the streets to designate
parking spaces.
They call for possible mandatory
registration of all autos, by issuing
three types of parking stickers. One
type of sticker, issued to on-campus
students and costing $1 a year, would
allow the student free parking any
where on campus from 8 a.m. to 4
p.m. with the exception of meter
zones.
Another sticker would be issued
to ofT-eampus students and .staff en
titling them to free parking any
where but in the expensive meter
zones. Cost would be $5 a year.
The third type of sticker would
go to faculty members and disabled
students. Gost would be $1 and al
low reserved area parking.
VISITOR PARKING
In the matter of visitor parking,
the committee suggests that daytime
visitors would be willing to use
meter areas.
Other recommendations:
1. Taking up of two parking spaces
to bring a $2 fine.
2. Third offense for speeding to
bring about removal of driving priv
ileges for three months in addition
to the usual fine. A fourth offense
to bring removal for six months, and
fifth, removal of privileges for rest
of time on campus.
3. Speed limit on Palm Drive to
be increased to 35 m.p.h. from 0 p.m.
to 7 a.m.
FOUR-WAY STOP
4. A four-way stop opposite Phys
ics Corner at intersection of Lomita
and Serra Streets and at the inter
section of Serra and Galvez, near
Encina Hall.
5. Slowing devices to be installed
in the area between Wilbur and
Branner halls (because of the safety
hazard they, believe will develop
there after the peripheral road is
completed).
, 6. Adoption of pay fine envelopes
to facilitate collection.
Plan Two, the alternative 1o the
above proposals, includes building a
new parking lot around the corner
of Serra and Lomita roads opposite
Physics Corner, to accommodate 100
to 150 cars.
Chairman Bob Maddcck of the newly-formed Traffic Committee
outlined his committee's proposals for campus traffic problem so
lution to the ASSU Legislature at its meeting last week.
Maddock presented two plans, one which his committee favors
and an alternate plan.
"The problem," Maddock said, "is traffic congestion on campus

because of unnecessary driving to
classes." He explained that his group
has five theories for solution under
Plan One. They are:
1. Ban all automobiles.
2. Block off the Quad to all traffic.
3. Ban certain groups from use of
Quad parking areas.
4. Ban certain groups from pos
session of autos (such as all fresh
men, etc.).
5. Make it a nuisance to drive in
the Quad area during class hours.
The committee's recommendations
on the basis of the proposal to make
Quad driving a nuisance include the
immediate reopening of Santa Teresa
Road.
OBSTACLES RECOMMENDED
He recommends, in place of closing
off Santa Teresa, the construction of
obstacles or stop signs in front of
Lagunjta. Committee reports state
that the theory of closing roads to
improve the traffic situation is
wrong.
Another recommendation is park
ing meter installation. Advantages
of meters, according to the commit
tee. are easier police checking and
collection of revenue. The funds
would be used for road and parking
facility improvement.
Committee plans call for two types
of meters, to be placed in different
campus areas. The inexpensive ones,
costing $30 each, would be placed in
the oval in front of Quad, in front
of Memorial Auditorium and Hoover
Library, in the library lot, along
the street opposite the temporary
buildings (Escondido to the corner
of Lasuen).
GEOLOGY CORNER
The same type would be used from
the Geology Corner on both sides of
the street to Santa Teresa, along
Santa Teresa on the side of Bowman
Alumni House, with the exception of
in front of Bowman and the Cellar
area.
Time limit on the meters would
be four hours, the cost 10 Cents, ft
would take 675 meters to cover the
areas. They would operate from 8
a.m. .to # 4 p.m.
Expensive meters ($6O each) would
be placed from Geology Corner to
History Corner on both sides of the
street excepting reserved parking
areas.

hour limit and cost 1 cent for 12
minutes, 5 cents for the hour. Two
