# Students to Receive Honor Code Booklet
## 
### 
An extensively revised and rewritten Honor Code and Funda
mental Standard booklet will be distributed to students this week
by the Fundamental Standard and Honor Code Commission.
Harry Miller, choirman of the commission, urged all students to
take time to read the booklet. "We feel this is very important,

since the most recent clarifications*
and interpretations of the Funda- j
mental Standard and Honor Code,
including last year's ruling on taking
examinations from the test room, are
explained," he said.
There will be no other campus
wide Honor Code education pro
gram for returning students this
year, Miller added.
The booklet decsribes the special
interpretation and explanation
given to the Fundamental Standard
in the following specific areas: wom
en in men's residences, liquor, stu
dent productions and publications,
student affairs and dances, libraries,
and Honor Code.
The Honor Code is set down as
stated in the by-laws of the ASSU
Constitution. The clarification 'on
taking examinations from the room,
as given by last year's ASSU Ex
ecutive Committee (now Legisla
ture), says, "Provided alternate seats
are available, tests will be taken
from the examination room only
with the consent of the instructor."
The booklet also outlines the ori
gin and history of the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code, reasons
for having them, how and by whom
they are enforced.
The booklets will be distributed
on campus through the residences,
and to off-campus students by mail.
They were mailed to new students
prior to pre-registration.
The Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Commission functions
primarily as an educative group. In
addition to distributing the Code
booklets, they took part in this fall's
pre-reg program for new students. ;
and have recently distributed to fac- |
ulty members the first booklet to ex
plain the faculty's responsibilities
under the Code.
