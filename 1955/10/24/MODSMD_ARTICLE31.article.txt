# Cards Missed Opportunities To Score, Declares Taylor
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
Following Stanford's hard
fought football struggle with the
University of Washington Hus
kies which ended in a 7-7 tie.
Indian coach Chuck Taylor told
that his eleven should
have capitalized on their many
scoring opportunities and won
the game.
Taylor was referring to the 46-
yard Stanford drive which bogged
down one yard short of the Husky
goal line, the 68-yard drive which
ended on the opponent's 5, and the
58-yard drive which carried to the
Washington 17 - yard line. When
asked about these shortcomings.
Taylor said, "We should have scored
those times. I don't like a tie."

The Indian mentor went on to tell
about the specially designed Stan
ford '"goal line" defense which his
charges used against the widespread
Husky offensive line. The defense
consisted of throwing nine men into
the forward wall to combat the
vaunted Washington running game.
The effectiveness of the defense
was borne out by the fact that Wash
ington was forced to punt seven
times while Stanford, which did all
its kicking in the second half, was
forced to kick on only five occasions.
Taylor thought that much of the
credit for the Cards' fine defensive
showing belonged to Tex Long, cen
ter, and fullback Bill Tarr. Long is
the Indian who recovered the Wash
ington fumble on the Husky 10-yard
line which resulted in the lone Stan
ford touchdown.
