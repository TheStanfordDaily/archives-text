# Early 49er Lead Disintegrates As Bears Gain Win
## 
### 
Paced by local boys Ed Brown
(USF) and Bill McColl (Stanford),
the Chicago Bears gained revenge
with a 34-23 victory over San Fran
cisco in a game that was closer than
the score indicates.
The Windy City eleven was forced
to come from behind as the 49ers
led, 17-3, until late in the second
quarter.
Brown hit McColl for a 9-yard
scoring pass with five seconds re
maining in the initial half, and boot
legged 5 yards two minutes into the
second half to tie the score.
Bobby Watkins, former Ohio State
All-American, climaxed a 66-yard
Chicago drive later in the third pe
riod to give the Bears a lead they
never relinquished. John Helbig's
block of an extra-point attempt in
the fourth quarter kept the Bears
ahead 24-23.
Los Angeles took over undisputed
control of first place in the Western
Divison with a 24-13 victory over
hapless Detroit. The Rams exploded
with two touchdowns in the last
quarter to break a 10-10 deadlock.
Cleveland and Pittsburgh retained
top spot in the Eastern Division,
both having 4-1 records as does Los
Angeles. Cleveland walloped Green
Bay 41-10, while the Steelers barely
squeaked by New York, 19-17.
In other contests, Washington
edged Baltimore, 14-13, and Phila
delphia tied the Chicago Cards,
24-24.
