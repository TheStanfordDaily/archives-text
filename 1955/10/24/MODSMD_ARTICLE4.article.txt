# Community Chest Drive Reaches 30 Pct. of Its Goal
## 
### 
The Community Chest Drive,
which ends tomorrow morning, had
achieved roughly 30 per cent of its
goal of $3,500 on Friday afternoon
when the returns were last counted.
The reason for this low percent
age, according to drive chairman
Fred Fortine, is that many living
units are waiting until the drive
ends to turn in all their money at
once. The fraternities especially, ho
said, are waiting for their Monday
evening house meetings to collect.
"However, we are disappointed
with the poor showing of the fresh
man class," Fortine said, "as Bran
ner and Roble have turned in very
little." Toyon. he mentioned, has
also made a very poor showing.
Fortine stressed that there is only
one day left in which to contribute.
Groups that have reached the 100
per cent mark are Alpha Kappa
Lambda fraternity with 130 per cent,
Phi Kappa Sigma with 120 per cent,
and Lathrop and Guthrie houses
with 100 per cent each.
