# Vote Thursday On Amendment
## 
### 
George Ralph, ASSU president,
succeeded in an effort to get a pro
posed constitutional amendment on
the ballot at next Thursday's and
Friday's final election.
The proposed amendment, dealing
with election of head cheer leader,
was supposedly passed at last week's
Legislature meeting and slated to be
put on the ballot. After the meeting
Administrative Assistant Eric Frick
er found that it actually hadn't been
passed, since the two-thirds Legis
lature vote necessary to pass it had
not been posted.
Later, however, Ralph conducted
a phone vote, calling LASSU mem
bers until he received the necessary
two-thirds "yea."
On Thursday and Friday students
will have the opportunity to vote
on the following amendment to the
ASSU constitution:
"The Legislature shall have the
power to regulate and supervise all
student elections specified in this
Constitution and its Bylaws. The
right to elect by secret ballot shall
not be denied for any elective office."
A two-thirds voting majority is
necessary to pass the proposal.
Flicker explained that this gives
direct election of the cheer leader.
Previously this had to go through
a screening committee, which would
judge the proposed nominee's quali
fications. In direct election anyone
of sophomore standing or above is
eligible to run after having his peti
tion signed.
