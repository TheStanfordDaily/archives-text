# Huskies Tie Cards After Drives Fail
## Stanford Dominates, Can't Score Again

TON STADIUM—Nobody likes
ties. But this one, from a Stan
ford standpoint, was surprising
ly satisfactory.
The score was 7-7. and it was
Washington that had to fight for
that result. Stanford fumlbled on
the fourth play of the game, and
Washington went 19 yards in five
plays for its only score of the game.
The remainder of the first half was
all Stanford.
The Cards drove deep into Husky
territory three times without suc
cess. It took a Washington fumble
on their first play after stopping
Stanford's first penetration to give
Stanford its score.
Aside from its scoring series,
Washington never once had the ball
in Indian land during the first half.
That was how completely Stanford
controlled the first 30 minutes of
play.
COMPLEXION CHANGES
The third quarter was a different
story. Now it was Stanford's turn to
make a goal-line stand as Washing
ton drove 93 yards in 21 plays, only
to have Stanford take over on downs
on its own two.
The final 15 minutes found both
teams unable to get a sustained
drive going. The Huskies couldn't
get the ball past mid-field for their
part, and the Indians could only
penetrate to the Washington 35-yard
stripe, and that was the last play of
the game.
