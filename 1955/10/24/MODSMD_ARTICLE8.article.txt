# Huskies Tie Cards After Drives Fail
## Stanford Dominates, Can't Score Again 
### BILL NICHOLS 
UNIVERSITY OF WASHING
TON STADIUM—Nobody likes
ties. But this one, from a Stan
ford standpoint, was surprising
ly satisfactory.
The score was 7-7. and it was
Washington that had to fight for
that result. Stanford fumlbled on
the fourth play of the game, and
Washington went 19 yards in five
plays for its only score of the game.
The remainder of the first half was
all Stanford.
The Cards drove deep into Husky
territory three times without suc
cess. It took a Washington fumble
on their first play after stopping
Stanford's first penetration to give
Stanford its score.
Aside from its scoring series,
Washington never once had the ball
in Indian land during the first half.
That was how completely Stanford
controlled the first 30 minutes of
play.
COMPLEXION CHANGES
The third quarter was a different
story. Now it was Stanford's turn to
make a goal-line stand as Washing
ton drove 93 yards in 21 plays, only
to have Stanford take over on downs
on its own two.
The final 15 minutes found both
teams unable to get a sustained
drive going. The Huskies couldn't
get the ball past mid-field for their
part, and the Indians could only
penetrate to the Washington 35-yard
stripe, and that was the last play of
the game.
Offensively Bill Tarr anil UW's
Credell Green were the stars of the
day. Tarr picked up 117 yards rush
ing,, net during the day, and all but
10 came in the first half. The Stan
ford fullback was a very tired boy
by the time the gun sounded. Green
contributed over half of the 110 UW
rusfijng total.
LONG STANDS OUT
Defensively, there were many
standouts. Joe Long was tops lor
the Cards, but Paul Wiggin and
Chris Marshall weren't far behind.
Long recovered two fumbles, one of
which* gave the Indians the ball on
the Washington 10, from whence
Tarr scored on the first play.
Long was also the signal caller
for a defense which threw a "goal
line" formation against the Huskies
all up and down the field in the first
half. The defense had as many as
nine men charging through the UW
forward wall at times.
HOBINSON VERY TOUGH
For Washington, their big tackle,
Fred Robinson, and back Mike Mon
roe looked excellent when Stanford

i had the ball. Monroe was a deadly
tackier all afternoon and intercepted
a fourth-quarter Brodie pass on the
UW 20 to stave off a possible Stan
ford score.
As for Robinson, the Card playing
icross from him, Chris Marshall,
deemed him the roughest tackle he'd
| faced yet this season.
When John Brodie fumbled early
I in the first period and the Huskies
went on to score, all in the first three
minutes 53 seconds of the game,
things looked dark for the Cards.
Remember Michigan State?
BACKFIELD JINX
But Stanford shook off its misfor
tune and went to work on the Wash
ington tackles. Tarr and Jeri Mc-
Millin were moving well on cross
bucks and the ball moved to the
Washington 35. There a jinx hit the
Stanford right halfback spot.
McMillin got a knock on the head
and had to letire for the day. Ernie
Dorn came in to replace him, and
carried the ball once. He made a
big 14 yards to the UW 10, and left
the game with a broken clavicle
(shoulder). He's out for the year.
Lou Valli was the next one to fall.
He landed on his game knee and
also is out for the year.
SCORE TIED
After Dorn's run, Stanford moved
to the five, but the Huskies held.
Washington took over, fumbled, and
Tarr scored on the first play. Raf
tery's try for the extra point ap
peared to sail wide to the right but
Referee Lee Eisan threw up his
hands and the game was tied.
In the second quarter the Cards
drove twice more. Brodie, who
played almost the entire game at
quarterback, sent Tarr into the line
for one with first and ten on the
Husky 16 and then missed on three
passes. The second drive started on
the W 48 after Steve Docter recov
ered a Husky fumble.
YOUNG LOSES SHOE
Gordy Young got through center
from the 21 and was tripped up on
the four when he lost his shoe. If
his footgear had remained on he pos
sibly would have scored, but Wash
ington held. Tarr was spilled for a
loss of six yards on fourth down.
That ended all serious scoring
threats for the Palo Altans. Wash
ington's final push came early in
the third quarter.
The tie seemed to satisfy neither
of the coaches. Technically, Wash
ington is not eliminated from the
Rose Bowl race, but as Chuck Tay
lor put it."Washington looked good,
but they're just not in UCLA's class.
They have no Sam Brown."
Taylor was of the opinion that his
team should have scored twice more.
"We should have gone in there in
the second quarter."

Washington went 19 yards in five
plays for its only score of the game.
The remainder of the first half was
all Stanford.
The Cards drove deep into Husky
territory three times without suc
cess. It took a Washington fumble
on their first play after stopping
Stanford's first penetration to give
Stanford its score.
Aside from its scoring series,
Washington never once had the ball
in Indian land during the first half.
That was how completely Stanford
controlled the first 30 minutes of
play.
COMPLEXION CHANGES
The third quarter was a different
story. Now it was Stanford's turn to
make a goal-line stand as Washing
ton drove 93 yards in 21 plays, only
to have Stanford take over on downs
on its own two.
The final 15 minutes found both
teams unable to get a sustained
drive going. The Huskies couldn't
get the ball past mid-field for their
part, and the Indians could only
penetrate to the Washington 35-yard
stripe, and that was the last play of
the game.
Offensively Bill Tarr anil UW's
Credell Green were the stars of the
day. Tarr picked up 117 yards rush
ing,, net during the day, and all but
10 came in the first half. The Stan
ford fullback was a very tired boy
by the time the gun sounded. Green
contributed over half of the 110 UW
rusfijng total.
LONG STANDS OUT
Defensively, there were many
standouts. Joe Long was tops lor
the Cards, but Paul Wiggin and
Chris Marshall weren't far behind.
Long recovered two fumbles, one of
which* gave the Indians the ball on
the Washington 10, from whence
Tarr scored on the first play.
Long was also the signal caller
for a defense which threw a "goal
line" formation against the Huskies
all up and down the field in the first
half. The defense had as many as
nine men charging through the UW
forward wall at times.
HOBINSON VERY TOUGH
For Washington, their big tackle,
Fred Robinson, and back Mike Mon
roe looked excellent when Stanford

i had the ball. Monroe was a deadly
tackier all afternoon and intercepted
a fourth-quarter Brodie pass on the
UW 20 to stave off a possible Stan
ford score.
As for Robinson, the Card playing
icross from him, Chris Marshall,
deemed him the roughest tackle he'd
| faced yet this season.
When John Brodie fumbled early
I in the first period and the Huskies
went on to score, all in the first three
minutes 53 seconds of the game,
things looked dark for the Cards.
Remember Michigan State?
BACKFIELD JINX
But Stanford shook off its misfor
tune and went to work on the Wash
ington tackles. Tarr and Jeri Mc-
Millin were moving well on cross
bucks and the ball moved to the
Washington 35. There a jinx hit the
Stanford right halfback spot.
McMillin got a knock on the head
and had to letire for the day. Ernie
Dorn came in to replace him, and
carried the ball once. He made a
big 14 yards to the UW 10, and left
the game with a broken clavicle
(shoulder). He's out for the year.
Lou Valli was the next one to fall.
He landed on his game knee and
also is out for the year.
SCORE TIED
After Dorn's run, Stanford moved
to the five, but the Huskies held.
Washington took over, fumbled, and
Tarr scored on the first play. Raf
tery's try for the extra point ap
peared to sail wide to the right but
Referee Lee Eisan threw up his
hands and the game was tied.
In the second quarter the Cards
drove twice more. Brodie, who
played almost the entire game at
quarterback, sent Tarr into the line
for one with first and ten on the
Husky 16 and then missed on three
passes. The second drive started on
the W 48 after Steve Docter recov
ered a Husky fumble.
YOUNG LOSES SHOE
Gordy Young got through center
from the 21 and was tripped up on
the four when he lost his shoe. If
his footgear had remained on he pos
sibly would have scored, but Wash
ington held. Tarr was spilled for a
loss of six yards on fourth down.
That ended all serious scoring
threats for the Palo Altans. Wash
ington's final push came early in
the third quarter.
The tie seemed to satisfy neither
of the coaches. Technically, Wash
ington is not eliminated from the
Rose Bowl race, but as Chuck Tay
lor put it."Washington looked good,
but they're just not in UCLA's class.
They have no Sam Brown."
Taylor was of the opinion that his
team should have scored twice more.
"We should have gone in there in
the second quarter."
UNIVERSITY OF WASHING
TON STADIUM—Nobody likes
ties. But this one, from a Stan
ford standpoint, was surprising
ly satisfactory.
The score was 7-7. and it was
Washington that had to fight for
that result. Stanford fumlbled on

Washington never once had the ball
in Indian land during the first half.
That was how completely Stanford
controlled the first 30 minutes of
play.
COMPLEXION CHANGES
The third quarter was a different
story. Now it was Stanford's turn to
make a goal-line stand as Washing
ton drove 93 yards in 21 plays, only
to have Stanford take over on downs
on its own two.
The final 15 minutes found both
teams unable to get a sustained
drive going. The Huskies couldn't
get the ball past mid-field for their
part, and the Indians could only
penetrate to the Washington 35-yard
stripe, and that was the last play of
the game.
Offensively Bill Tarr anil UW's
Credell Green were the stars of the
day. Tarr picked up 117 yards rush
ing,, net during the day, and all but
10 came in the first half. The Stan
ford fullback was a very tired boy
by the time the gun sounded. Green
contributed over half of the 110 UW
rusfijng total.
LONG STANDS OUT
Defensively, there were many
standouts. Joe Long was tops lor
the Cards, but Paul Wiggin and
Chris Marshall weren't far behind.
Long recovered two fumbles, one of
which* gave the Indians the ball on
the Washington 10, from whence
Tarr scored on the first play.
Long was also the signal caller
for a defense which threw a "goal
line" formation against the Huskies
all up and down the field in the first
half. The defense had as many as
nine men charging through the UW
forward wall at times.
HOBINSON VERY TOUGH
For Washington, their big tackle,
Fred Robinson, and back Mike Mon
roe looked excellent when Stanford

i had the ball. Monroe was a deadly
tackier all afternoon and intercepted
a fourth-quarter Brodie pass on the
UW 20 to stave off a possible Stan
ford score.
As for Robinson, the Card playing
icross from him, Chris Marshall,
deemed him the roughest tackle he'd
| faced yet this season.
When John Brodie fumbled early
I in the first period and the Huskies
went on to score, all in the first three
minutes 53 seconds of the game,
things looked dark for the Cards.
Remember Michigan State?
BACKFIELD JINX
But Stanford shook off its misfor
tune and went to work on the Wash
ington tackles. Tarr and Jeri Mc-
Millin were moving well on cross
bucks and the ball moved to the
Washington 35. There a jinx hit the
Stanford right halfback spot.
McMillin got a knock on the head
and had to letire for the day. Ernie
Dorn came in to replace him, and
carried the ball once. He made a
big 14 yards to the UW 10, and left
the game with a broken clavicle
(shoulder). He's out for the year.
Lou Valli was the next one to fall.
He landed on his game knee and
also is out for the year.
SCORE TIED
After Dorn's run, Stanford moved
to the five, but the Huskies held.
Washington took over, fumbled, and
Tarr scored on the first play. Raf
tery's try for the extra point ap
peared to sail wide to the right but
Referee Lee Eisan threw up his
hands and the game was tied.
In the second quarter the Cards
drove twice more. Brodie, who
played almost the entire game at
quarterback, sent Tarr into the line
for one with first and ten on the
Husky 16 and then missed on three
passes. The second drive started on
the W 48 after Steve Docter recov
ered a Husky fumble.
YOUNG LOSES SHOE
Gordy Young got through center
from the 21 and was tripped up on
the four when he lost his shoe. If
his footgear had remained on he pos
sibly would have scored, but Wash
ington held. Tarr was spilled for a
loss of six yards on fourth down.
That ended all serious scoring
threats for the Palo Altans. Wash
ington's final push came early in
the third quarter.
The tie seemed to satisfy neither
of the coaches. Technically, Wash
ington is not eliminated from the
Rose Bowl race, but as Chuck Tay
lor put it."Washington looked good,
but they're just not in UCLA's class.
They have no Sam Brown."
Taylor was of the opinion that his
team should have scored twice more.
"We should have gone in there in
the second quarter."
UNIVERSITY OF WASHING
TON STADIUM—Nobody likes
ties. But this one, from a Stan
ford standpoint, was surprising
ly satisfactory.
The score was 7-7. and it was
Washington that had to fight for
that result. Stanford fumlbled on
the fourth play of the game, and
Washington went 19 yards in five
plays for its only score of the game.
The remainder of the first half was
all Stanford.
The Cards drove deep into Husky
territory three times without suc
cess. It took a Washington fumble
on their first play after stopping
Stanford's first penetration to give
Stanford its score.
