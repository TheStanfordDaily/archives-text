# Walters Terms Team Reception 'Disappointing'
## 
### 
Yesterday's car parade to meet
the Stanford football team on its
return from the Washington game
was less successful than the Michi
gan reception.
"I was extremely disappointed in
the turnout," commented head
cheerleader Jim Walters. "The yell
leaders and pompon girls were there,
but the band didn't appear and there
was sparse support otherwise."
There was a reception line, al
though songs and yells were absent.
Walters praised the pompon girls,
who, he said, have appeax-ed at every
function this year, despite criticism
leveled at them.
The Rally Committee was a spe
cial disappointment in Walters' opin
ion. Only about 10 members of the
group showed up. Said Walters, "If
the leaders don't lead, how do they
expect the others to follow?"
Walters termed this fiasco ex
tremely unfortunate because the
team had expected to be met.
Walters attributed some of the
student apathy to midterms, which
are coming up this week, especially
for freshmen. He felt this explained
the band's absence, which contrib
uted to the lack of spirit.
