# Song Sheets To Be Issued
## 
### 
Wallet-size song sheets, contain
ing yells as well as old and new
songs, will be passed out in living
groups tonight through Friday.
It was felt that these sheets were
needed, said Head Cheerleader Jim
Walters, because of complaints from
alumni that they "missed hearing
kids sing at the games."
He estimated that 50 per cent of
the students don't know the words
to football songs.
Tonight Valters hopes to cover the
fraternities, Row houses and Vil
lage.
Walters and Head Football Coach
Chuck Taylor will have dinner at
Roble Hall tomorrow night and hand
out the sheets after a short talk.
Assistant yell leaders and other
coaches will follow the same pro
cedure at Lagunita, Branner and
Union halls.
He will distribute the rest Thurs
day and Friday and would like ev
eryone to have a song sheet before
the San Joose rally Friday night.
