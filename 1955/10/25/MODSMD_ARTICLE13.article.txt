## Head Yell Leader Walters Dispatches Trophy Goes to UCLA—with Plaque 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Last Friday night a mysterious, bulky package was loaded on
a United Airlines plane bound southward from San Francisco.
Destination—UCLA.
Contents—one red and white air horn.
Decision to return the famous air horn was made by Head Cheer

Leader Jim Walters on Thursday'
night.
Considering the misunderstand
ings between the two schools and
the possibility of mutual retaliation,
Walters thought it best to avoid any
trouble by returning the source of
contention.
A FEW CHANGES
But UCLA was not to get its air
horn back exactly the way it left it.
Secretly. Friday afternoon, in the
basement of the Alpha Sig house,
the horn received a new coat of
paint—red and white—to replace the
blue and gold which had been re
moved earlier in the week.
The horn had also been bedecked
with a duly inscribed silver plaque,
and this too was sent down to the
Uclans.
A NARRATIVE
The following is the story of the
capture, six-day retention, and re
turn of the UCLA air horn:
Tom Gregg, Stanford's horn
snatcher. got the idea around 10 a.m.
Saturday of the UCLA game that he
would like to get his hands 011 the
famed UCLA trophy--a gaudy blue
and gold air horn.
He began to acquaint himself with
UCLA student officials and saun
tered down to the tunnel entrance
where the horn lay ready to greet
the team as it ran onto the field.
He took off his shoes so that he
could run faster, sneaked up to the
rn, grabbed it, and ran for the
Stanford stands.
Gregg, followed closely by .1

horde of UCLA rooters, ran to the
Stanford section and tossed his prize
to Rally Com member Bill Lackey,
who kept close tab on the horn dur
ing the game.
At the end of the game, the horn
was conveyed downward from the

nected wilh [we confiscation of UCLA's aii horn, take a "last look" at it Lefoie it was shipped back
