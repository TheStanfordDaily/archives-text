# Knowland: ‘Peace with Honor’ Far From 'Peace at Any Price'
## Senator Speaks to United Nations Day Crowd at Memorial Auditorium 
### 
Senator William F. Knowland called for "peace with honor" as
the goal of American foreign policy in a United Nations Day ad
dress last night before a large Memorial Auditorium audience.
"All Americans desire peace with honor," said the California
Republican, "which is far different from peace at any price."

* The senator made his position
clear on the issue of "preventive
war' during a question session which
followed.
"1 would not support a preventive
war. A preventive war is, in itself,
| a war.
"By the same token, I don't think
we should sit back until we are
nibbled away into a continental
| Dienbienphu."
LASHES OUT
Knowland lashed out at appease
ment as surrender on the installment
plan. "We want a free Germany, but
not at the price of enslaved other
I countries," he said.
"We are naive to believe that the
Communist leopard has changed its
spots," Knowland warned. "We must
not place too much stock in the
smiles of the Communists."
Knowland spoke on a program
sponsored by the Stanford Political
Union and the Institute of Interna
tional Relations in commemoration
of the founding of the UN 10 years
ago.
BROUSE SPEAKS t-
Student speaker A 1 Brouse, a
graduate student in political science,
followed Knowland's talk with a re
buttal speech in which he assessed
the role of the UN and criticized thee
Senate minority leader on some
points.
Brouse, speaking on the UN. drew
from experience he received this
summer while serving in the UN
secretariat.
Looking back on the last 10 years
since the founding of the UN. Know
land pointed out that the Commu
nist control has been extended from
200 million to 900 million people.
SOME FACTORS
"There are some factors that have
caused the UN not to function as it
should," he continued.
Out of 60 countries, only 17 con
j tributed to the collective effort in
the Korean conflict, he said, with
the U. S. dominating.
"Use any yardstick you want, it is
not a fair and equitable contribution
by other nations of the world. Other
nations should be prepared to carry
the full share of the load."
Knowland was introduced by llR's
president Die Lawson. Poli Union
President Ernie Hartz served as
emcee.
Previous to the program, the sen
ator had an informal coffee hour
with students and faculty at Bow
