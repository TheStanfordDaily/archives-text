## 
### JIM PALMER 
William F. Knowland, his
charming wife Helen and daugh
ter Estelle had steak dinner at the
Zeta Psi house last night and re
tired to another room for an after
meal tete-a-tete.
While the Senator answered ques
tions, Mrs. Knowland talked quietly
on the otht?r side of the Zete living
room.
The authoress of "Madame Balti
more" said she wasn't planning to
write any more books at this time.
"What I want to write about. I
can't. And what I can write about,
nobody is interested in," she ex
plained.
She went on to point out that the
life of a Senator's wife is not as ex
hausting as it might seem. "It all
gets to be routine after a while,"
she commented with a smile.
Mrs. Knowland met her husband
in early school days. Now the
Knowland family resides in Pied
mont, although from January to
June, the missus is in Washington
with the Senator.
Mrs. Knowland called Estelle "the
rebel in the family." (She is the
only one who has attended Stanford.
The Senator was graduated from Cal
in 1929.)
She said she doesn't help her hus
band with his many political
speeches—other than offering moral
support.
"His speeches are sort of a con
tinuing story. Each one adds on to
previous ones, bringing in new is
sues as they come up. They all be
come part of a large picture."
With that, the vibrant Mrs. Know
land, her daughter Estelle and her
husband Bill made their departure
for Memorial Auditorium,
