# sporting proposition
## 
### 
UCLA's air horn has gone back home, and
maybe it's a good thing. Maybe. But v/e hate
to think so. We liked that horn. It would have
made a wonderful trophy for the v/inning team
each year.
The atmosphere, however, was not condu
cive to a friendly, gentlemanly rivalry. UCLA
would have nothing to do with our proposal.
Give us back our air horn or we'll come up
there and take care of you, they said to us—
and through their administration yet.
Well, just for the record: We weren't wor
ried about them coming up here looking for a
scrap; we can handle situations like that. But
why precipitate a brawl? 'it wouldn't have been
worth the effort. Good collegiate fun would
have been fine; petty, hot-headed street fights
would have been pointless.
So v/e soothed their wounds and dried their
tears by shipping the horn in time for UCLA's
game Friday night.

But we're disappointed in UCLA. We're
sorry they couldn't appreciate the finesse with
which one man — Tom Gregg — captured the
horn. It was a beautiful thing.
We're sorry that UCLA didn't keep its agree
ment and return our megaphone. We had no
intention of keeping the horn until then.
We're sorry that UCLA students had to carry
on their negotiations through their administra
tion.
More than anything else, we're sorry that
UCLA was unable to agree with us that the
horn would make a fitting prize for the winner
each year. They have another one for their
very own, after all.
Jim Walters has proposed that UCLA keep
the horn this year since they won the game
the other week. Then next year put the horn
up as a trophy. We hope UCLA will consent
to such a sporting proposition.
