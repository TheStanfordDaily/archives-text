"Stanford Owes UCLA Apology" — that's
what the Daily Bruin sports editor declared in
a head in his column last week. He then went
on to say;
"The stunt that some irresponsible, immature
Stanford student pulled before the game can
not go by unnoticed.
"Before the game Bob Neilson and Stan
Hughes, vice-chairmen of the rally committee,
were bodily attacked as they waited in the
tunnel to greet the team and the famous UCLA
air horn was taken.
"There is nothing wrong with trying to get
the air horn, but the manner in which it was
taken was disgraceful not only to the few who
participated in the incident but for the entire
Stanford student body as well.
"This was not the only ridiculous and insipid
move Stanford pulled last weekend. The UC
LA song girls appeared at the Indian rally Fri
day night and the Stanford band consented to
play a UCLA song while the 200 Bruins in at
tendance sang.
"Thinking he would be quite big on campus
the band leader had the band play too slow and
too fast in an effort to get things balled up.
The girls went through their entire routine but
this bit by Stanford was quite childish and
showed their wonderful hospitality to the vis
iting Bruins.
"Also the Stanford card section spell-out of
'U-STINK' will go down in history as one of
the most repulsive incidents in Stanford his
tory."

They're having a different kind of ID trouble
at the University of Connecticut.
According to the Connecticut Daily Campus,
the assistant director of student personnel has
announced that any student under 21 reported
to the Office of Men's Affairs for the use of
profane or vulgar language will be suspended.
He clarified the University position, saying,
"Swearing is the least important aspect of the
recent ruling. The essential point concerns the
excessive usage of obscene and foul language.
The overexcessive display of this language
during the first few weeks of school forced the
administration to make an open public state
ment of the rules concerning student control."
So far only one violation case has been han
dled. The student involved was charged with
"openly addressing his residence counselor in
an obscene manner." He was suspended for a

day and then readmitted following a meeting
between the parents and the personnel direc
tor.

Another kind of ban has hit Syracuse.
The United Press states, "The banning of
shorts on the Syracuse University campus has
resulted in some long faces.
"Cries of dismay from coeds greeted the ac
tion of the women's standards council which
announced that it had banned the wearing of |
shorts in classrooms, university buildings, and
in downtown Syracuse."
And how did the Syracuse men feel? Senior
Robert H. Coon told the press, "Shorts are for
the Marilyn Monroe type, and there are few
like that on campus."

They're getting ail hot and bothered over
NSA down at USC. -
According to a Daily Trojan report of the stu
dent Senate meeting, "Senator Carl Terzian i
said that he felt that few of the voting members
of the Senate knew anything about the NSA
resolutions which they were to vote 6n. He
said, 'If it is made a political football as ir» pre
vious years, we should drop it.'
"At this charge Parliamentarian Joe Cerrell
leaped to his feet and proceeded to rip into the j
speech as 'totally irresponsible' and 'reeking |
of personal publicity.' He challenged that he
had yet to hear 'something possibly anti-NSA
on the Senate floor' and that the Senator's re
marks had no basis at the present time.' "

Oregon students are raising havoc on the
Oregon State campus.
Six Oregon University students are charged
with destruction of property at Oregon State
and face possible suspension.
The lads were caught burning "UO" in 12-
foot letters in the turf at the Oregon State cam
pus. The gasoline burns were deep enough
to require resodding of the area at a cost of
$100.
Yellow letters were painted on sidewalks
and steps adjacent to the Memorial Union the
same morning, but they couldn't pin this on the
boys.
Also a pile of rubbish, the beginning of the
Oregon State homecoming bonfire, was set off
and caused a fire that was visible for six miles.!
The discouraged Oregon State bonfire chair
men announced that double guards would be
posted in the future.

Oregon students are raising havoc on the
Oregon State campus.
Six Oregon University students are charged
with destruction of property at Oregon State
and face possible suspension.
The lads were caught burning "UO" in 12-
foot letters in the turf at the Oregon State cam
pus. The gasoline burns were deep enough
to require resodding of the area at a cost of
$100.
Yellow letters were painted on sidewalks
and steps adjacent to the Memorial Union the
same morning, but they couldn't pin this on the
boys.
Also a pile of rubbish, the beginning of the
Oregon State homecoming bonfire, was set off
and caused a fire that was visible for six miles.!
The discouraged Oregon State bonfire chair
men announced that double guards would be
posted in the future.
"Stanford Owes UCLA Apology" — that's
what the Daily Bruin sports editor declared in
a head in his column last week. He then went
on to say;
"The stunt that some irresponsible, immature
Stanford student pulled before the game can
not go by unnoticed.
"Before the game Bob Neilson and Stan
Hughes, vice-chairmen of the rally committee,
were bodily attacked as they waited in the
tunnel to greet the team and the famous UCLA
air horn was taken.
"There is nothing wrong with trying to get
the air horn, but the manner in which it was
taken was disgraceful not only to the few who
participated in the incident but for the entire
Stanford student body as well.
"This was not the only ridiculous and insipid
move Stanford pulled last weekend. The UC
LA song girls appeared at the Indian rally Fri
day night and the Stanford band consented to
play a UCLA song while the 200 Bruins in at
tendance sang.
"Thinking he would be quite big on campus
the band leader had the band play too slow and
too fast in an effort to get things balled up.
The girls went through their entire routine but
this bit by Stanford was quite childish and

speech as 'totally irresponsible' and 'reeking |
of personal publicity.' He challenged that he
had yet to hear 'something possibly anti-NSA
on the Senate floor' and that the Senator's re

Oregon students are raising havoc on the
Oregon State campus.
Six Oregon University students are charged
with destruction of property at Oregon State
and face possible suspension.
The lads were caught burning "UO" in 12-
foot letters in the turf at the Oregon State cam
pus. The gasoline burns were deep enough
to require resodding of the area at a cost of
$100.
Yellow letters were painted on sidewalks
and steps adjacent to the Memorial Union the
same morning, but they couldn't pin this on the
boys.
Also a pile of rubbish, the beginning of the
Oregon State homecoming bonfire, was set off
and caused a fire that was visible for six miles.!
The discouraged Oregon State bonfire chair
men announced that double guards would be
posted in the future.
