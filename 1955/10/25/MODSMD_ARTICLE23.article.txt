# Jim Walters' Statement on the Air Horn

(Editor's note: Head Cheer
Leader Jim Walters tells why
the UCLA air horn was re
turned J
I will attempt to explain the
events which led to the return 'of
the UCLA air horn. The decision
was mine alone and entirely free
from administrative jurisdiction.
The capture of the horn and the
incidents which follow e d will
probably never be entirely justi
fied in the eyes of either party.
For that reason we cannot aiyjue
the problem from a standpoint of
right or wrong, hut mainly in
terms of possible consequences.
If the situation were allowed to
develop, the horn might have cre
ated a rivalry surpassed only by
that existent between Stanford and
Cal.
We accept the Axe and the Cal
rivalry v as we do nearly all Stan
ford traditions, without a clear
appreciation of the implications,
heartaches, and unnecessarily de
structive acts from which the tra
dition evolved. It has only been
in recent years that the Axe ri
valry has subdued to proportions
satisfactory to all concerned.
The popular feeling after the
capture of the horn—and I was
in accord—was "e'est la guerre."
This would have been applicable
to Cal, perhaps, but not to a stu
dent body which acted like this:
1. Upon losing the horn (because
of faulty vigilance, not "bodily as

sault"), the Rail y Committee
chairman threatened to "turn loose
the entire UCLA rooting section"
and "tell Red and the boys . . ."
You heard the rest.
2. Our megaphone and baton
wive captured and upon a gentle
man's agreement were to be off
fired after the game in exchange
for the horn. Rather than comply
with the agreement of their lead
ers, the UCLA rooters in a frantic
frenzy, as a child who has a favo
rite toy taken from him, ripped
the megaphone to shreds and
damaged the baton sufficiently that
it will have to be replaced.
Naturally unable to return the
megaphone as previously agreed,
their head yell leader requested
that I bring the horn to Union
Square in San Francisco Saturday
at midnight. They agreed to ex
change only if they had the mega
phone and baton. Upon verifying
the megaphone's fate and in view
of the fact that I was an eligible
hostage, I decided against the trip.
This in UCLA's eyes was the
"'great betrayal"; yet their not
showing on our side of the field
directly after the game did not
constitute an infraction of their
code.
4. Upon returning to their cam
pus, UCLA students ran whim
pering to their dean rather than
voicing their opinions through
qualified student representatives.
The UCLA dean called Dean YVin

bigler, and the context of his con
versation was: "You'd letter re
turn our horn or within a week
I],UOO students will lie combing the
Stanford area for it." His emo
tions were no move mature than
the students'. 1 was sorry to see
thai university students couldn't
speak for themselves, hut had to
rely on administrative action. In
fact, we had to suggest that their
student body president call George
Ralph.
After this sequence of events, I
decided that the initial novelty
had worn olT; we had succeeded
in capturing a valuable trophy;
and if past conduct was indicative
of future repercussions, we want
ed nothing to do with UCLA's air
horn. If they had proceeded along
proper channels—rational student
channels—the picture might now
be different.
One broken arm or property
damage on either side would not
be worth the horn. If I have
averted any such conflicts, I feel
justified in my decision.
But I still think we should in
stigate a tradition — the winning
team keeps the horn for the year
following its victory. Therefore by
rights it is UCLA's now. The de
cision for coming years rests with
the UCLA student body. I have
faith that they will react in a
spirit exemplifying good sports
manship.
