# ISAACS, BRODIE START
## Cards Stress Goal Line Offense for SJS Tilt 
### 
Coach Chuck Taylor, still hav
ing nightmares over his team's
failure to push the ball over the
goal line after getting deep into
enemy territory, drilled his first
eleven on what he called "goal
line offense" during the major
part of yesterday's workout.
The Card varsity, with John Bro
die, Carl Isaacs and Gordie Young
all starting, ran through a brisk
dummy scrimmage with emphases
on plays to be used near the oppo
nent's goal line. Brodie, who fol
lowed up his brilliant performance
against UCLA with a sound signal -
calling job against the Huskies, ap
parently has the edge at the present
time in his race for the quarterback
slot with senior Jerry > Gustafson.
The Cards have driven the ball
inside the opponent's 20-yard line
on four occasions in their last two
games, only to have all their efforts
go awry when a score seemed in
evitable. Washington stopped Indian
drives on the 1, 5 and 17 yard lines
respectively, while UCLA held Stan
lord on the Bruin 3-yard line in the
waning minutes of their battle up
here two weeks ago.

Carl Isaacs, the fast - improving
junior from Stockton, started Satur
day's game in place of bedridden
John Stewart, and looked good
enough to warrant himself a varsity
position. Stewart was forced to miss
yesterday's practice since he hasn't
had time to fully recover from the
attack of flu which waylaid him last
Saturday.
According to Taylor, the right
halfback position is still up for
grabs between sophomore scatback
Jerri McMillin and veteran Gordie
Young. Young opened in the back
field yesterday, but McMillin was
around for a lot of action, too.
The Indians lo6t a couple of valu
able backs in Saturday's contest
when regular right half Ernie Dorn
was put out of commission with a
broken shoulder and Lou Valli, who
had already missed most of the sea
son after a first-game injury, was
reinjured. The speedy sophomore
will now be lost for the rest of the
season.
After the Cards finished with their
offensive maneuvers, Taylor stressed
fundamentals for half an hour and
then finished up some defense work
which he hopes will stop the high
scoring Spartan split-T attack.
