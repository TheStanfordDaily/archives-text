# El Campo Outlasts El Tigre In Hard-Fought Overtime Tilt
## 
### JOE RAMSEY 
El Campo outlasted El Tigre yes
terday by gaining 10 yards while
Tigre lost 6 in an overtime period
following a 6-6 deadlock in regula
tion time.
There were no points scored in
the first half as both teams got their
good and bad breaks. Tigre was
forced to punt in the early minutes
and a Campo back fumbled the ball.
Tigre then took over on Campo's 30-
yard line. Campo's line, rushing
hard, held to make it fourth and
about 25, and Tigre was forced to
punt again. This time Campo got the
break. A Tigre blocker got in his
teammate's line of fire and accident
ally blocked the punt.
It looked like a Campo TD when
Boyd Fattrell, quarterback, hit Don
Damuth for the first completed pass
of the game, but at this point Tigre
held and took over on downs.
Tigre quarterback, Bruce Evans,
completed one toss before he threw
the first ill-fated aerial attempt" of
the game. Bob Constible intercepted
the pass and Campo took over on the

midfield stripe. Neither team could
move the bail for the remainder of
the first half even though Fattrell
completed three more passes for
Campo in the last minutes.
On the first Campo attempt of the
second half. Fattrell put his team on
the scoreboard with a 60-yard brok
en-field run that provided the spec
tacular groundwork of the contest.
The conversion attempt was unsuc
cessful.
Campo seemed inspired by their
touchdown as Don Damuth inter
cepted another Tigre pass on their
first offensive play. Damuth then
completed a short pass to Dan Drom
berger for a Campo first, but Tigre's
defense tightened and they took
over on Campo's 35-yard line after
an interception by Niel MacPhail of
a touchdown-bound pass by Da
muth.
Tigre capped a 45-yard aerial at
tack when Evans hit Chuck Bayse
in the end zone. The all-important
point after touchdown attempt was
no good, and there was no more
scoring. Campo then went on to win
the see-saw contest in overtime.
