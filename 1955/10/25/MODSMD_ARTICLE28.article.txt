## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 24 (U.R)—
San Jose Coach Bob Bronzan told
writers yesterday that College of
Pacific players "roughed up" his star
quarterback, Tony Tei'esa, in last
Saturday's game between the two
schools.
Teresa came out of the contest—
which was won by the Tigers, 14 to
7—with a broken nose, two chipped
teeth, a five-inch face cut and an
injured kidney.-
Bronzan also told his audience at
the Northern California Football
Writers luncheon that ace fullback,
Joe Ulm, suffered a possible frac
tured cheekbone and end Stan Beas
ley sustained a lacerated scalp.
SPARTANS HURT
Stanford's Chuck Taylor, whose
Indians face the Spartans next Sat
urday on the Cards' home turf, said
that San Jose would be hurt badly
if Teresa and Ulm were both out for
next week's contest. Teresa has been
the main cog in the Spartans' split—
T offense which features the option
play, in which the quarterback can
cither run, pass or pitch out the ball.
WALDORF CONFIDENT
California's '"Pappy" Waldorf, who
takes his losing Bears to Los Angeles
to play UCLA, said the Bears turned
in their best 54 minutes of the sea
son last Saturday while losing to
USC. 33-6.
"Then we sagged in the last six
minutes and USC scored twice
more," Waldorf said. "However, we
were definitely up for the game, and
I think I can get them up again for
UCLA."
