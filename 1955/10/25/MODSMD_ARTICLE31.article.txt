STANFORD 7. WASHINGTON 7
The tie was somewhat unsatisfactory for all concerned, but the Tribe
can claim the moral victory in this one. The Huskies were favored and in
solid contention for the Rose Bowl before the Indians put some tarnish on
their hopes.
Washington was the team that was lucky to get off with the deadlock.
The Huskies scored early in the first quarter after recovering an Indian
iumble but thereafter could muster only one serious threat. That was in
the third period when a 93-yard Washington drive stalled on the Stanford
two-yard line.
Stanford completely dominated the first half. After the Huskies got
their touchdown, they didn't once penetrate into Stanford territory during
the remainder of the first half. Stanford meanwhile tied the score on a
10-yard smash by Bill Tarr and had two other drives stopped inside the
Husky 20.
The second half, but for Washington's one drive, resolved itself into a
punting duel. The Huskies ended the game with seven punts to their credit
while Stanford was forced to punt on five occasions.
Standouts for the Indians were fullback Bill Tsh r who gained 117 yards
on the ground and center Joe Long who played like a tiger on defense.
The game cost the Indians dearly at the right halfback position. Two
year letterman Ernie Dorn broke the clavicle bone in his shoulder and
sophomore Lou Valli reinjured his knee. Both will be out for the season.
The tie did not eliminate Washington from the Rose Bowl race, but it
did disillusion some of the Seattle people who thought that the Huskies
were a real power. The issue will be squared away in three weeks after
UCLA meets the Huskies in the Coliseum, but as Chuck Taylor said after
Saturday's game, "Washington looked good, but they're just not in UCLA's
class."
UCLA 33, lOWA 13
The Bruins roll on and chalk up another PCC victory over the Big Ten.
The lowans made it close in the first half, but the crunching Bruin power
finally wore them down.
Tailbacks Sam Brown and Ronnie Knox were the big guns for UCLA.
Brown scored three touchdowns, one on a sensational 67-yard punt return
in the third quarter. Knox scored his first touchdown as a Bruin in the
second quarter and hurled a 75-yard touchdown strike in the last 17 seconds
of the game.
The Hawkeyes out-gained and out-first-downed the Bruins but just
couldn't keep sustained drives going.
UCLA, after its early-season loss to Maryland, is rolling in high gear
and is quite probably the equal of any team in the country.
USC 33, CALIFORNIA 6
The poor old Bears take it on the chin again after a week of furor on
the Berkeley campus in which "Pappy" Waldorf was burned in effigy and
the Daily Cal's sports editors incited the students and team to fever pitch
with some blazing comments about the football apathy at Cal.
The Bear football followers got some solace out of this game, however,
as the Bears lost honorably. This was the big complaint at Berkeley after
last week's Cal-Oregon game. The Bears lost that one dishonorably.
Cal's good showing against the Trojans seems to have restored an air of
forgiveness around Berkeley. The Bears, amidst dire predictions of a
slaughter, held the Trojan horde to 12 points in the first half and to 19 until
late in the game. Meanwhile the Bears managed to muster enough punch
to get one touchdown on a pass from Hugh MaGuire to Jim Carmichael.
The game cost Cal the services of one of their "nonapathetic" players,
end Roger Ramseier, who is out for the remainder of the season with an
injury sustained en the fourth play of the game.
OREGON STATE 14, WASHINGTON STATE 7
The Beavers bounced back after defeats at the hands of UCLA and COP
to take their second Pacific Coast Conference win. Oregon State converted
two early WSC fumbles into touchdowns and then fought off three second
half Cougar drives to take the win.
Joe Francis, the fine sophomore OSC tailback, played another sharp
game as did fullback Arlo Wenstrand.
OREGON 4(», ARIZONA 27
The Ducks galloped out of a 14-14 half-time tie to run away with this
one. The speedy Oregon backs accounted for over 300 yards rushing with
fullback Jack Morris scoring three times, once on a 51-yard run. Halfback
Dick James intercepted three Arizona passes in the first half.
Arizona halfback Art Luppino retained his national rushing leadership
by rolling up 166 yards.

UCLA 33, lOWA 13
The Bruins roll on and chalk up another PCC victory over the Big Ten.
The lowans made it close in the first half, but the crunching Bruin power
finally wore them down.
Tailbacks Sam Brown and Ronnie Knox were the big guns for UCLA.
Brown scored three touchdowns, one on a sensational 67-yard punt return
in the third quarter. Knox scored his first touchdown as a Bruin in the
second quarter and hurled a 75-yard touchdown strike in the last 17 seconds
of the game.
The Hawkeyes out-gained and out-first-downed the Bruins but just
couldn't keep sustained drives going.
UCLA, after its early-season loss to Maryland, is rolling in high gear
and is quite probably the equal of any team in the country.
USC 33, CALIFORNIA 6
The poor old Bears take it on the chin again after a week of furor on
the Berkeley campus in which "Pappy" Waldorf was burned in effigy and
the Daily Cal's sports editors incited the students and team to fever pitch
with some blazing comments about the football apathy at Cal.
The Bear football followers got some solace out of this game, however,
as the Bears lost honorably. This was the big complaint at Berkeley after
last week's Cal-Oregon game. The Bears lost that one dishonorably.
Cal's good showing against the Trojans seems to have restored an air of
forgiveness around Berkeley. The Bears, amidst dire predictions of a
slaughter, held the Trojan horde to 12 points in the first half and to 19 until
late in the game. Meanwhile the Bears managed to muster enough punch
to get one touchdown on a pass from Hugh MaGuire to Jim Carmichael.
The game cost Cal the services of one of their "nonapathetic" players,
end Roger Ramseier, who is out for the remainder of the season with an
injury sustained en the fourth play of the game.
OREGON STATE 14, WASHINGTON STATE 7
The Beavers bounced back after defeats at the hands of UCLA and COP
to take their second Pacific Coast Conference win. Oregon State converted
two early WSC fumbles into touchdowns and then fought off three second
half Cougar drives to take the win.
Joe Francis, the fine sophomore OSC tailback, played another sharp
game as did fullback Arlo Wenstrand.
OREGON 4(», ARIZONA 27
The Ducks galloped out of a 14-14 half-time tie to run away with this
one. The speedy Oregon backs accounted for over 300 yards rushing with
fullback Jack Morris scoring three times, once on a 51-yard run. Halfback
Dick James intercepted three Arizona passes in the first half.
Arizona halfback Art Luppino retained his national rushing leadership
by rolling up 166 yards.
STANFORD 7. WASHINGTON 7
The tie was somewhat unsatisfactory for all concerned, but the Tribe
can claim the moral victory in this one. The Huskies were favored and in
solid contention for the Rose Bowl before the Indians put some tarnish on
their hopes.
Washington was the team that was lucky to get off with the deadlock.
The Huskies scored early in the first quarter after recovering an Indian
iumble but thereafter could muster only one serious threat. That was in
the third period when a 93-yard Washington drive stalled on the Stanford
two-yard line.
Stanford completely dominated the first half. After the Huskies got
their touchdown, they didn't once penetrate into Stanford territory during
the remainder of the first half. Stanford meanwhile tied the score on a
10-yard smash by Bill Tarr and had two other drives stopped inside the
Husky 20.
The second half, but for Washington's one drive, resolved itself into a
punting duel. The Huskies ended the game with seven punts to their credit
while Stanford was forced to punt on five occasions.
Standouts for the Indians were fullback Bill Tsh r who gained 117 yards
on the ground and center Joe Long who played like a tiger on defense.
The game cost the Indians dearly at the right halfback position. Two
year letterman Ernie Dorn broke the clavicle bone in his shoulder and
sophomore Lou Valli reinjured his knee. Both will be out for the season.
The tie did not eliminate Washington from the Rose Bowl race, but it
did disillusion some of the Seattle people who thought that the Huskies
were a real power. The issue will be squared away in three weeks after
UCLA meets the Huskies in the Coliseum, but as Chuck Taylor said after
Saturday's game, "Washington looked good, but they're just not in UCLA's
class."
