# Supremo Court Balks At Movie Censorship
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Supreme
Court struck another blow at movie
censorship today by outlawing a
Kansas ban on "Tlih Moon Is Blue."
Kansas censors had found the film
too sexy.
The high coy i t gave no reason for
its action in the movie case except
to cite its own 1953 ruling on "The
Miracle," a film banned in ;ome
states as sacrilegious.
