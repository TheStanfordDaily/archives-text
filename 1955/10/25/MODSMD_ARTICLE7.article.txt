# Farm Flayers To Give First Season Play
## 
### 
The sometimes ambling but al
ways amatory adventures of the typ
ical god, presented in a farcical blend
of the modern French and ancient
Greek, will be the opening presenta
tion of the Stanford Players for the
1955 season.
Opening tomorrow night, Jean Gi
raudoux's retelling of the classic
tale, "Amphitryon 38," is scheduled
for a series of eight performances
in Memorial Auditorium's Little
Theater.
A riotous melange of colored cos
tumes, complete with authentic, spe
cially-made headdresses and wigs,
has been concocted by the Theory
of Costumes classs under the direc
tion of Virginia Opsvig.'
The scenery, including several un
usual special effects, was designed
to resemble something like the Par
thenon viewed with a Gallic wink.
It includes three different views of
Amphitryon's palace. Wendell Cole
supervised the construction of the
sets.
The cast includes Judy Doty. Shir
ley Douglass, Glenn Du Bose, Bev
Glassford, Merritt Johnson, Charles
Lyons, Kelly Reynolds, Hart Spra
ger, Jeannie Tabscott and David
Whorf.
Some tickets are still available for
the performance at the Mem Aud
box office.
