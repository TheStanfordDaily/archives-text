## 
### 
Alcoholic Beverage Control
authorities in San Francisco
stepped in yesterday to help
clarify the reports that have
been circulating campuswide
over the "gun-pulling" incident
at Rossotti's last Friday.
Reports from many students allege
that a law enforcement officer drew
his gun in keeping order at the Al
pine Road establishment.
ABC officers say that the report
they received from one of their
agents who was on the scene indi
cates that, although an officer told
the crowd to disperse or he "would
find it necessary to draw his gun."
he didn't actually remove the side
arm from its holster.
The agent's report says that he
and a fellow investigator went to
Rossotti's Friday on a check for il
legal identification cards, placed
under arrest an under-age drinker,
identified as a University of South
ern California student, for possession
of a false ID and took up a bottle
of beer he was drinking as evidence.
A crowd gathered and in the con
fusion the youth ran off. At this
point the Woodside Patrol (a local
private law enforcement agency)
was summoned.
While the Woodside patrolman
was searching for the boy someone
slipped the key out of his parked
auto, and someone grabbed the bot
tle being held as evidence and
broke it.
Then the patrolman told the crowd
to disperse, threatening to pull his
gun. The Woodside patrolman was
armed, but didn't draw his gun, ac
cording to the ABC report.
State Highway Patrol officers re
port that they have no official report
on file concerning the incident. At
first they thought that the com
plaints that they did hear were from
residents near Rossotti's about the
noise at the bar.
Campus Police Chief Gordon
Davis says, "There's no doubt that
there was questionable activity at
Rossotti's," but that Stanford police
weren't called into the affair.
