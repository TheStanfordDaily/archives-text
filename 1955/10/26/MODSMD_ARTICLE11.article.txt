Reports that an officer held a
gun on a group of students at
Rossotti's Beer Garden last Fri
day afternoon were verified yes
terday by the patrolman who
pulled the gun.
Woodside Patrolman Charles Mc-
All«»* told The Daily he wa- forced
into the move because a crowd of
youths threatened to "gang up" on
him.
He said that Friday afternoon he
received a call from the state De
partment of Alcoholic Beverage
Control agents asking him to come
to Rossotti's.
McAller explained they were re
questing aid in chasing an under-age
drinker who had escaped from their
custody. He identified him as a
University of Southern California
student.
"EVERYTHING 0.K."
When he arrived at the bar, Mc-
Alier said, the ABC agents told him
that "everything was 0.K." He began
to leave but found that someone had
taken the key out of his parked car.
McAller asked for the key's return
and, while asking, someone removed
from his car a beer bottle which was
being held for evidence against the
escaped student.
PULLED GUN
"The crowd closed in on me and
the ABC men, threatening to gang
up and overturn the car. I had no
other recourse than to pull my gun
after I'd asked them to disperse and
they hadn't. When they saw the gun
they dispersed," McAller noted.
He said the ABC men saw the in
cident and told him they would re
port to their office.
Monday afternoon the ABC's San
Francisco office told The Daily that
one of their agents reported that
although the patrolman threatened j
to pull his gun he did not actually |
take it out of its holster.
