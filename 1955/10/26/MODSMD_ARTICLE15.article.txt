# Ex-British Diplomat Accused in Spy Case
## 
### 
LONDONâ€”A Laborite member of
Parliament charged today that Har
old Philby, former first secretary to
the British embassy in Washington,
was the "third man" in the Burgess-
Mac Lean diplomatic spy case.
M.P. Marcus Lipton referred to
Philby on the floor of Commons as
having "engaged in dubious third
man activities." His charge came
two days after the New York Sun
day News broke the story and iden
tified Philby as the man who tipped
off diplomats Donald MaeLean and
Guy Burgess in 1951 that they were
suspected of being Red spies.
MaeLean, a rising diplomat, and
Burgess, who had been fired for bad
conduct, fled the country and now
are believed to be in Moscow. They

escaped the day government agents
were to question them.
