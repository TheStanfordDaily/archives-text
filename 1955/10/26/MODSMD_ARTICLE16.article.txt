### 
WASHINGTONâ€”Senator Richard
B. Russell (D., Ga.) said that Gov
ernor Frank J. Lausche of Ohio
would make a "formidable" Demo
cratic Presidential nominee. But he
said he is "not committed" to
Lausche or anyone else.
Russell, a powerful voice among
Southern Democrats, mentioned
Lausche as a "dark horse" possibility
for the 1956 Democratic nomination
at a news conference following his
return from a two-month tour of
Europe.
He described Lausche as a "mid
dle-of-the-roader" who mjght. be
more acceptable to Southerners than
other potential candidates.
Russell, an unsuccessful contender
for the party's 1952 nomination, said
he considered other Democratic pos
sibilities "a little too far to the left"
for Southern tastes. He named Adlai
E. Stevenson, Governor Averell
Harrirpan of New York, and Senator
Estes Kefauver (D., Tenn.) as the
leading contenders.
