## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Air Force
wound up an eight-year study of
flying saucers today by concluding
there is no such thing. But it alerted
the public to expect radical new
planes soon that could give the "il
lusion of being saucers."
Air Secretary Donald A. Quarles
said an investigation of almost 5.000
"saucer" sightings produced "no evi
dence of the existence of the popu
larly termed flying saucers."
Quarles noted that several new
planes of radical design now are in
the works and cautioned that "we
are now entering a period of avia
tion technology in which aircraft of
unusual configuration and flight
characteristics will begin to appear."
He said new planes will rise ver
tically, without benefit of runway,
and will zoom away in level, super
sonic flight, possibly giving "the il
lusion of the so-called flying saucer."
Quarles also announced that the
Air Force's first jet-powered verti
cal-rising airplane will fly from Ed
wards Air Force Base. Calif., in a
few days.
