A mistake in instructions to
the voters and opening of the
polls .after tlv? appointed hour
decided ASSU Legislature last
night to void results of the pri
mary elections for three of the
13 contested positions.
The entire slate of candidates for
Women's Council, Men's Council and
Village legislative representative
will go before the voters again to
morrow and Friday, when final elec
tions for the other offices will be
held.
The only post that was definitely
decided by the primaries was I,lie
vice - presidency, for which Helen
Zarifes ran unopposed.
In those cases in which primary
election results were approved, the
two candidates who received the
most votes will appear on the final
ballot. An excepiton is the case of
the Wilbur representatives, of whom
two are to be elected.
REFERENDUM WITHDRAWN
Another major decision at the
LASSU meeting was to withdraw
the constitutional amendment per
taining to the election of the head
cheer leader from consideration in
a referendum in tomorrow's and
Friday's election.
Two posts were to be filled on
Women's Council, but instructions
on the ballot read, "Vote for one."
The mistake was noticed an hour
and a half after the polls had opened
and already 110 ballots had been
cast.
Ballots were corrected and voter:,
were given oral instructions, but
LASSU deemed the error cause fox
voiding the results.
VILLAGE POLLS
Representatives from the Village
told that their polls had not been
open the entire time they were
scheduled to be. Instead of two
hours each day, the booths had been
in operation only 30 to 45 minutes
each day.
Village men submitted that thi .
be sufficient cause to invalidate the
primary for their legislative repre
sentative, and LASSU concurred.
Men's Council results were de
clared void on the basis of the Vil
lage mishap.
SPONSOR QUESTIONS
The referendum on the constitu
tional amendment regarding head
cheer leader election was withdrawn
as a result of a question by Roble
sponsor Jo Davis.
Miss Davis appeared before the
Legislature to request clarification
and education on the head cheer
leader amendment.
The motion passed last week, pro
posing to present the referendum to
the student body.
In discussion of the proposal last
night, Legislature members found
that they themselves were not quite
sure of all the factors involved. They
moved to reconsider the motion they
had passed last week. This they did.
LASSU neither rejected nor re
passed their motion on presenting
the referendum. They tabled the
proposal, thereby making it. ineligi
ble to appear on the ballot in the
current election.
