rude slurs
To the Editor:
On Monday night the senior Senator from Califor
nia and minority leader of the United States Senate,
William F. Knowland, spoke at Stanford University.
The Memorial Auditorium was filled to capacity with
not only students of Stanford, but a great number of
people from surrounding communities.
Regardless of the political viewpoint it is an honor
and a privilege for Stanford to have so distinguished
a guest as a United States Senator, and it was to
hear the Senator's remarks that so many people at
tended.
And yet following the Senator's talk the audience,
as well as the Senator, was subjected to a "rebuttal"
speech given by an obscure student, with many per
sonal slurs and ungentlemanly remarks directed at
the Senator sitting by the speaker's rostrum. The
speaker, after having been invited to speak at Stan
ton! as its guest of honor, was, in effect, told right to
hi face in none too polite terms that he was all wet.
Such remarks were, in our judgment, rude, un
dignified, and in very poor taste, reflecting no credit
<<u the Stanford student body and the people respon
sible for planning the "rebuttal." Apparently a large
number of people in the audience also found this dis
tasteful, as they got up and departed as the "rebut
tal" proceeded.
It is, of course, true that we are all entitled to our
own opinions and the right to express those opinions.
But it seems to us that when the University has a
distinguished guest, whether the man be Stevenson,
Nixon, Truman, Hoover, Knowland, or another such
a one of these, the common courtesies of every-day
decency should be extended to him as a gentleman,
and the "rebuttals" savpd fof another night.

inappropriate
To the Editor:
I feel that all of us who heard Senator Knowland's
foreign policy talk last Monday evening were most
fortunate in securing the Senator as a speaker, and I,
and probably most present, found his address most
pertinent and informative.
However, in the rebuttal speech which followed, it
seemed to me that not all of the remarks of student
(Al) Brouse were in the best of taste. I imagine that
many of us felt he did not bring credit to Stanford
University as a result of his speech. Indeed, the
very fact of an extended rebuttal speech following
an address by the minority leader of the United States
Senate struck me as somewhat inappropriate to the
occasion.
The idea of students establishing political and for
eign policy groups and having the initiative to secure
outstanding speakers to address them and the stu
dent body is an excellent one. But students who par
ticipate in such talks and who ask questions from the
floor should remember they represent first of all
Stanford University and secondly the views which
they may espouse. . . .
In actions where the good name of Stanford Uni
versity will be involved 1 believe that Dr. Sterling
and the directors of the University have a duty to
exercise a supervisory control, particularly on occa
sions v/here such prominent men as Senator Know
land appear before the school. . . .

traffic suggestions
To Ihe Editor:
... I should like to make a few suggestions which
the Traffic Committee evidently did not consider,
and I should like to react to some of the suggestions
listed in the Daily of Oct. 24.
First of ail, why doesn't the University do away
with unnecessary red curbings (the ones at Alvarado
and Escondido and by Encina on the Galvez Street
side and also the "red zones" in the library lot)
which waste parking spaces? I'm speaking of such
areas as are not absolutely necessary for fireplugs,
building entrances, or pedestrian crossings.
The library lot "red zones" simply represent areas
which were really useful and in which parked cars
would not necessarily have blocked off others trying
to pass. ... In addition, the spaces just in front of
the entrances to the Temporary Buildings represent
lost spaces which are apparently never used either
by pedestrians or service vehicles, yet students are
tagged for parking in those spaces. Why?
Why doesn't the University either use the open
areas by the Hoover Libe and by the Temporary
Buildings to try to alleviate the parking situation, or
else come right out and start building classrooms on
them? . . .
As to the committee's suggestions, parking meters
may or may not prove to be the answer. Personally
1 believe that the University would spend its money
just as wisely by investing in traffic lights and more
parking lots, as outlined .below. But if we do have
meters, why penalize off-campus students by charg
ing them $5 while on-campus students pay only
SI? . . .
In addition, why hasn't the committee thought of
the possibility of traffic lights at Galvez and Serra
and I -omita and Serra, rather than stop signs, to speed
the flow of traffic and safeguard pedestrians? .
they would . . . likely aid the control and flow of
traffic during rush hours, rather than causing long
lineups at stop signs. . . .
But coming back to the parking lot-building idea
a;;ain, I would like to submit for the University's
consideration the building of more lots in diversified
areas of the campus as the University gets bigger and
the classrooms for different departments and schools
extend between the Quad area itself.
'I bus the problem might be solved partly by giving
one area to graduate students and faculty in law, en
gineering. humanities and sciences, education, etc.—
presumably that particular area nearest the location
o! the graduate department itself, but leaving other

areas nearby for off-campus undergrads in the vari
ous departments of all types. Diversification of fa
cilities and a sticker system for those entitled to priv
ileges in each department may help the situation.

(Editor's note: It should lie made clear that the
S.'. fee proposed for off-campus students would en
title them to park in more places than the on-ram
pus students who pay only ail.)
no books
To the Editor:
At the present time, I am enrolled in four courses;
in three of these there has been difficulty with the
Bookstore over lack of texts. (As far as I can see, the
only reason this problem did not arise in the other
course was that the required text was a 50-cent
Mentor book, available anywhere.)
In one of the courses, certain of the general books
were simply not ordered. In another, the trouble
seemed to be that the Bookstore had -ordered, instead
of the number of texts requested by the professor, a
number that sounded good to someone in the Book
store. In a third course, not only were an insufficient
number of books ordered, but the book list was mis
printed, so that many students purchased an un
necessary text.
I realize that the long lines are caused by lack of
space, but it is obvious that they are not shortened
by the efficiency of the Bookstore personnel. The
Bookstore may have been constructed for a student
body of half the present size, but this growth did not
take place during 1955. It is hoped that plans for ad
ditions will take into account possible future growth
of Stanford's student body.
I was amazed by the opinions expressed in Friday's
Daily on the subject of the Bookstore's service. I can
only assume that these people have never bought a
book anywhere else and don't realize how simple it
can be. •

stand up
To the Editor:
As fall quarter rolls around each year and football
season takes place, it is time for the famed "Stanford
Spirit" to be demonstrated. In the three years I have
attended Stanford, I have never experienced a finer
display of Stanford support than that which has taken
place in our last two home games.
I have heard that many years ago it was somewhat
of a tradition for the Stanford student section to stand
throughout the entire game—maybe the stadium had
no seats, or skirts were tighter—however, to me it
would be nothing short of spectacular to renew that
tradition. The team runs all week in practice and
then for two hours on Saturday; the cheer leaders
stand for two hours on Saturday; we sit for two hours
on Saturday.
Personally, I get tired of sitting through 19 hours
of classes during the week. There is no reason for
the student section to be too tired to stand for at least
the last quarter, if we must compensate, unless there
is too much TGIF —if this is the case, I will be most
happy to donate my beer money for the cause of
"tired rooters."
Of course, there will be a great many of those who
will disagree with my suggestion—this is to be ex
pected. However, I know that if each one of our ball
players could relate to us that which means most to
him on Saturday he would say: the support of the
student section. We have proved that we have the
"lung support"; how about the "arch support"? If I
must compensate further, why not all of us get a few
weeks' rest and then go all the way at the Big Game?
I sincerely congratulate Jim Walters and his asso
ciates on the finest job I have seen to date.

really
To the Editor:
The following statement appeared ... in today's
Daily (headline: "After a Year of Silence, the Caril
lon Tolls Again": "Mullen has played the powerful
bells at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco—the only
other carillon in Northern California."
Really?? As a UC-alumna-turned-Stanford-grad
student (with resulting mixed emotions), I feel duty
bound to inform you that: 1) Berkeley's famed Cam
panile contains a carillon; 2) said carillon is played
three times daily at 8 a.m., noon, and G p.m.; 3) ac
cording to my trusty Shell road map, Berkeley is in
Northern California.
I'm strongly in favor of both universities (excep
tion: Big Game), both carillons, and am a strong ad
vocate of Northern California, in general.
But I dislike unsupported categorical statements
in any type of reporting.
LILL WILLIAMSON
(Editor's note: Really. The bells that peel from
Berkeley's famed Campanile do not constitute a
carillon; they are chimes. This information comes
from Miss Marguerite Murdock who plays the
Campanile chimes. She says sometimes they are
played like a carillon, but technically they are
chimes. The difference, she said, lies in the octave
arrangement and number of the hells.)
appreciation
To the Editor:
Unaccustomed as we are to thanking people, we're
going to do so anyway.
To all those who so generously gave of their time,
effort, and money—we wish to say thank you one and
all.
(Names withheld by request)
P.S. —In all seriousness, we sincerely appreciate the
work expended by everyone to make the Fall Quarter
Drive a success.
