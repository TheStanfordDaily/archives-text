# MOVIE REVIEW
## Luscious Lovely Sparks Scandalous Murder Trial 
### JOHN A. BYRNE 
"She flies through the air, with the greatest of ease . .
Or, "The Girl on the Red Velvet Swing."
And so it is with the gal the ads called "the luscious lovely who
. . . sparked the most scandalous murder of the year." Our hero
ine, a show type gal, who comes to the big city and gets herself

seduced by prominent architect
Stanford White.
Perhaps the strangest thing about
the great seduction is that it re
volves around a rod velvet swing,

that sugar - daddy
White seems to
provide in his own
private hideaway.
But the fiddler is
to be pai d, and
the statement is
rendered when
show gal gets her
self hitched to so-,
ciety scion Harry

Thaw, with the fine family back
ground. And we are treated to a
noisy Wedding night altercation
when it becomes evident that a
white wedding dress was singularly
inappropriate.
HARRY PLANS REVENGE
Our Harry is not one to let this
sort of thing go unavenged. He is
none too subtly painted as a hot
head, a paranoid, and lord knows
what else.
In a mighty fifth reel climax, he
whips out a pistol and scrags White
on the roof of Madison Square Gar
den. A murder trial follows, of
course.
And for the sake of saving Harry,
our little show gal gets on the stand
and admits to illicit relations with
prominent architect, now deceased
by hubby's bullet. She has saved
hubby, and hubby's family name.
RETURNS TO SHOW BIZ
But all of this doesn't thaw the
Thaws. They kindly give her room
rent for the rest of the week, as
Harry is packed off the loony bin
(being not guilty by reason of in
sanity, of course).
And needless to say, she gets no
where when she accosts the widow
of late architect and announces that
it really wasn't the way it sounded
on the stand.
So back to show biz she goes, on
a red velvet swing in Atlantic City.
And thus to a moral, more obvious
than need be stated here.
REALLY NOT BAD
But in spite of an obvious moral,
it's really a well-acted and well
presented movie. Farley Granger
does an especially nice job of por
traying poor, little rich boy "Harry,
and Ray Milland is an adequate se
ducer, so nice that one has a hard
time thinking ill of him.
Joan Collins really isn't awfully
good, but somehow is fetching
enough to carry the movie off. All
in all, it's a rather good flick.

none too subtly painted as a hot
head, a paranoid, and lord knows
what else.
In a mighty fifth reel climax, he
whips out a pistol and scrags White
on the roof of Madison Square Gar
den. A murder trial follows, of
course.
And for the sake of saving Harry,
our little show gal gets on the stand
and admits to illicit relations with
prominent architect, now deceased
by hubby's bullet. She has saved
hubby, and hubby's family name.
RETURNS TO SHOW BIZ
But all of this doesn't thaw the
Thaws. They kindly give her room
rent for the rest of the week, as
Harry is packed off the loony bin
(being not guilty by reason of in
sanity, of course).
And needless to say, she gets no
where when she accosts the widow
of late architect and announces that
it really wasn't the way it sounded
on the stand.
So back to show biz she goes, on
a red velvet swing in Atlantic City.
And thus to a moral, more obvious
than need be stated here.
REALLY NOT BAD
But in spite of an obvious moral,
it's really a well-acted and well
presented movie. Farley Granger
does an especially nice job of por
traying poor, little rich boy "Harry,
and Ray Milland is an adequate se
ducer, so nice that one has a hard
time thinking ill of him.
Joan Collins really isn't awfully
good, but somehow is fetching
enough to carry the movie off. All
in all, it's a rather good flick.

"She flies through the air, with the greatest of ease . .
Or, "The Girl on the Red Velvet Swing."
And so it is with the gal the ads called "the luscious lovely who
. . . sparked the most scandalous murder of the year." Our hero
ine, a show type gal, who comes to the big city and gets herself

seduced by prominent architect
Stanford White.
Perhaps the strangest thing about
the great seduction is that it re
volves around a rod velvet swing,

that sugar - daddy
White seems to
provide in his own
private hideaway.
But the fiddler is
to be pai d, and
the statement is
rendered when
show gal gets her
self hitched to so-,
ciety scion Harry

Thaw, with the fine family back
ground. And we are treated to a
noisy Wedding night altercation
when it becomes evident that a
white wedding dress was singularly
inappropriate.
HARRY PLANS REVENGE
Our Harry is not one to let this
sort of thing go unavenged. He is
none too subtly painted as a hot
head, a paranoid, and lord knows
what else.
In a mighty fifth reel climax, he
whips out a pistol and scrags White
on the roof of Madison Square Gar
den. A murder trial follows, of
