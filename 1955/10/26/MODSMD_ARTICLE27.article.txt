# Addition Planned For Building On Inner Quad
## 
### 
University officials have announc
ed plans to build an addition to
Building One on Inner Quad. The
plan calls for double-decking of the
area which formerly housed the
Cashier's Office, which now is in
Encina Hall.
Building is scheduled to begin
soon, with officials hoping to have
the addition completed for winter
quarter occupancy.
On the main floor, where the cash
ier and other student accounts' of
fices were once located, there will be
two classrooms opening onto Me
morial Court, according to the plans.
There will also be two seminar
looms on the ground level, which,
officials comment, "a r e critically
needed."
