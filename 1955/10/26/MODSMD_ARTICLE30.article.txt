# Drama Classes Get Backstage Gaieties Tours
## 
### 
Members of. advanced drama
classes in local high schools will
have a chance to take a behind-the
scenes look at the Big Game Gaieties
Nov. 7 when Ram's Head institutes
the first of a series of good will
tours.
The classes will be conducted
through a series of demonstrations
of the various aspects of production:
makeup, sets, lights, costumes. They
will see, in detail, the workings of
the crews that make up a college
show. They will see the problems
as they arise and the solutions as
they are made.
Finally, the students will be in
vited back at night to sit in on a
working rehearsal.
"What we're aiming for," said tour
chairman Jeff Fadiman, "is a sort of
student-to-student preview. These
high school seniors are the people
who will be writing, directing, act
ing in next year's 'Gaieties.' This is
their chance to take a look right
now."
Classes from Castilleja are touring
the show on the 7th, Palo Alto High
on the 9th. Other high schools are
scheduled for later in the month.
