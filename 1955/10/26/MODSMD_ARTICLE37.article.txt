# Forbush Passes Lead Zetes To Mural Shutout
## 
### JIM PRICE 
John Forbush hurled two long
touchdown passes to lead the Zetes
to an 18-0 mural football win over
Kappa Sig 11. The Zetes rolled to a
12-0 half-time then added
an insurance tally midway through
the second half on a 43-yard aerial
from Forbush to John Kitsmiller.
Kappa Sig had threatened to get
back in the ball game after Bill Tay
lor had intercepted a Forbush toss
on the Zetes' 30-yard stripe.
After Taylor had returned to the
15, the Kappa Sigs moved quickly
within scoring distance on a second
down pass completion on the 7.
However, a fourth down pass was
batted down in the corner of the
end zone to preserve the shutout.
Zetes marched right back for the
insurance TD in four plays. Tailback
John Forbush completed a first down
pass on the Zetes' 15-yard line after
the Zetes took over on their own 7.
FORBUSH PITCHES
Forbush ran 6 yards for the first
down on the next play. Taking to
the air again, he flipped a 16-yard
aerial on first down and then the
43-yard payoff pitch to Kitsmiller.
It was a Forbush to Jim Byrer
heave that went for the first Zete
tally early in the game. The play
traveled GO yards to start the scoring
on a sensational note.
Halfback John Sevier galloped 10
yards for the second Zete touch
down. Both extra - point attempts
were unsuccessful. v
Except for the second-half threat,
the Zetes' defense kept the Kappa
Sigs pretty well stifled. In the second
half the Kappa Sigs were held to a
net gain of only 90 yards rushing
and passing.
