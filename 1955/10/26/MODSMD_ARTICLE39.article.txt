# Flu Strikes Indian Gridders; Taylor Holds folds Light Workout
## 
### BOB MIEROW 
Two more Stanford football players came down with the flu
yesterday, and another pair suffered finger injuries in practice as
the Cards went through a long, non-contact workout.
End Jerry Beatie and quarterback Jerry Gustafson were stricken
with the flu and are not expected to be back in uniform until to-

morrow. Although both should be'
ready for the San Jose State game
Saturday, they will miss the prep
aration for the tilt.
Should Beatie not be at full
strength Saturday, sophomore Gary
Van Galder could replace him at the
starting right-end spot. John Brodie
had already gained the inside track
for the signal-calling role before Gus
became ill.
Left end John Stewart, who sat
out the Washington game in a Se
attle hospital, was in sweat clothes
as the Tribe drilled yesterday. Stew
art is recovering from a flu attack.
« Halfback Bill Burget and end
Frank Hook both suffered rather
severe finger injuries. Hook caught
a football on the end of his finger
and had it fractured.
Burget bent his digit back, pulling
the ligaments .and possibly injuring
the nerves, during a passing drill.
The halfback was sent to the hospi
tal, since the skin had been broken
and he was bleeding profusely.
Trainer Connie Jarvis declared
that Lou Valli will not undergo any
operation on his knee until the sea
son closes. Jarvis stated that the

speedy halfback could return to ac
tion against either USC or Oregon.
Ernie Dorn was declared definitely
out for the remainder of the year.
Jarvis noted that if his shoulder had
been broken any earlier in the sea
son, he could have returned for the
Big Game.
Probably because of the many in
juries and illnesses, the Tribe was
not sent through its usual Tuesday
afternoon scrimmage. Coach Taylor
stressed offense,
