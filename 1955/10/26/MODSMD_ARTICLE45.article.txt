# Song Sheets Go To Roble Tonight
## 
### 
Football song sheets will be hand
ed out at Roble Hall tonight by Head
Cheer Leader Jim Walters and Head
Football Coach Chuck Taylor, who
will eat dinner there and give a
short talk.
Assistant yell leaders and other
coaches will follow the same proce
dure at Lagunita, Branner and
Union halls, distributing the wallet
size sheets, which contain old and
new football songs and yells.
Walters will distribute the rest to
morrow and Friday and would like
everyone to have one of the sheets
before the San Jose rally Friday
night.
He estimates that 50 per cent of
the students don't know the words
to football songs. These sheets can
be kept handy for games and rallies.
