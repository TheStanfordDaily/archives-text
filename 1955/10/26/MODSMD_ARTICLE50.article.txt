# ESPRI Promotes Cultural Exchange Between Americans, Foreign Students
## 
### CYNTHIA McMURTRY 
ESPRI to most students is a nonsense word of meaningless let
ters, but to those who are connected with this new organization.
ESPRI makes a lot of sense.
Literally, it means Educational Society for the Promotion of
Relations Intercultural. The purpose of ESPRI is to provide an

oppc-tunity for foreign students and*
other students at Stanford, primarily
within the graduate Sclfool of Edu
cation, to meet and acquire an un
derstanding of cultures other than
their own.
Although the organization didn't
receive approval of the ASSU legis
lature until Oct. 12, its history
reaches back to last spring quarter.
The idea for the group originated
from Harry Miller, a doctoral stu
dent in the ed school and now co
ordinator of ESPRI.
Miller met several foreign stu
dents from Japan, India, Thailand,
and ftalized that there were many
foreign students at Stanford who
could make a valuable contribution
to the other students. The foreign
students were anxious for the op
portunity to form friendships with
American students.
grad program
Miller considered tb* integration
program for undergraduate foreign
students to be adequate, but felt a
lack in the grad program. The av
erage grad student in the ed school
is older than the average grad stu
dent in the University, because the
ed doctoral students must have two
years of professional experience.
Most of the foreign grad students
live off campus, and so are limited
in their opportunities to meet Amer
ican students.
Miller expressed his opinion that
these foreign students did not re
ceive a proper welcome to Stanford.
As an example, he spoke of an ed
school grad student from Baghdad

who came to Stanford strongly pro-
American, but after two weeks here
was ready to go home believing the
Communist line.
The man had met no friendly
American students who would as
sist him in this strange country, and
had been refused a room for rent in
Palo Alto.
GROUP NEEDED
Miller decided a group was needed
to assist foreign grad students at
Stanford, and thus resulted a com
mittee of three students and two
faculty members to form the group
which is now ESPRI.
The organization was formed, re
ceived approval of the ed school,
and functioned "unofficially" last
spring and summer quarters.
ESPRI is not a University-wide
group; it has limited its purposes
and membership to the School of
Education. It was decided last spring
to limit active membership to a small
group which would be vitally in
terested and willing to work.
The exact number of members was
resolved at 20, with a minimum of
25 per cent international students.
Members are selected on the basis
of interest, professional experience
and scholarship.
