# Watkins Sees UN Achieving Charter Ideals
## Utility Demonstrated In Past Achievements 
### STEW TOY 
What will save the world is
not a defense against atomic
weapons but, through the United
Nations, a "higher level of inter
| national thought."
Speaking in a sparsely-filled Me
morial Auditorium at last night's
Tuesday Series, political science
Professor James T. Watkins IV saw
the UN's close arrival at the ideals
of justice, mutual respect and re
! sponsibility for the common good
which its charter expresses.
"The first decade has been a race
between education at the conference
table and preparation for war. Thus
far the conference table has been
winning."
NOT MERELY ALLIANCE
The UN sprang largely from a
revision of the League of Nations
covenant. But the UN is not merely
a league or alliance, nor is it a su
per-state of world government—a
fact which has disappointed many in
the decade following its "formation.
The UN cannot bind its members
to any line of action. It can only
recommend a common course which
it feels will best serve its members'
united interests.
Even its decisions on the Korean
situation in 1950 were only recom
mendations, Watkins stressed.
But UN members are learning to
see problems from a world point of
view and, to a large extent, are fol
lowing these recommendations.When
they agree on certain points they
soon see the advantages of agree
ment and concur on other problems.
TWO FRONTS
One trouble with the UN, Watkins
said, is that its founding fathers
"miscalculated" the world situation
which was to follow. In 10 years
the world powers have lined them
selves up in two common fronts,
creating many unforeseen problems.
Also in that time, one-fourth of
humanity has found itself facing
statehood for the first time, and an
other one-fourth has become sub
merged in the quagmire of Com
munist domination.
As a result, the UN has had to
evolve its practices "in the heat of
crisis."
Watkins cited the UN's usefulness
by examples of its many accomplish
ments. In one field alone—that of
disease control—it has saved 10 mil
lion lives annually.
UTILITY DEMONSTRATED
"Its mere survival demonstrates
its utility. Member countries may
walk out from time to time, but they
return. Where else have they to go?
It's dark outside."
Watkins does not feel revisions of
the UN charter are necessary. This
year's General Assembly session, by
charter stipulation, must decide on
the desirability of revisions.
"No revision is possible without
agreement, and where there's agree
ment no revision is necessary."
Watkins has been in the Political
Science Department since 1946, was
made executive head in 1953.
He spent a month this summer at
UN headquarters in New York City
studying operations.
