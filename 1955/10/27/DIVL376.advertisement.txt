ADVENTURES IN SOCIAL SCIENCE: NO. 1
"The proper study of mankind is man," said Geoffrey Chaucer
in his immortal Casey at the Bat, and I couldn't agree more.
In these tangled times it is particularly proper to study man
how he lives, how he functions, how he works. Accordingly, this
column, normally devoted to slapdash waggery, will from time
to time turn a serious eye on the social sciences.
In making these occasional departures, I have the hearty ap
proval of the makers of Philip Morris Cigarettes, whose interest
is not only in promoting the pleasure of young Americans by
providing them with a gentle cigarette, matchlessly blended of
vintage tobaccos, grown with loving care and harvested with
tender mercy, then cured with compassionate patience and rolled
into firm, tasty cylinders and brought to you in king size or
regular, wrapped in fetching packages of lively crimson and
pristine white, at prices that wreak no havoc on the most
stringent of budgets; but who are equally concerned with
broadening the minds and extending the intellectual vistas of
every college man and every college woman.
I, for one, am not unmoved by this great-heartedness in the
makers of Philip Morris, and though I know it is considered
chic these days to disparage one's employer, I shall not. Indeed,
I shall cry "Huzzah!" for the makers of Philip Morris. I shall
cry "Huzzah!" and "Bon appctit!" and "Stout Fellows!"
But I digress. For our first lesson in social science, let us turn
to the study of economics, often called the queen of the social
sciences. (Sociology is the king of the social sciences. Advertis
ing is the jack.) Economics breaks down into two broad general
classifications: 1) coins; 2) folding money. P»ut before taking
up these technical aspects, let us survey briefly the history of
economics.
Economics was discovered by the Englishman, Adam Smith.
He published liis theories in 1778, but everybody giggled so hard
that Smith, blushing hotly, gave up the whole thing and went
into the cough drop business with his brother. —•
For long years after that, economics lay neglected while the
world busied itself with other things, like the birth of Victor
Hugo, the last days of Pompeii, and the Runny Hug.
1 hen one day while flying a kite during a thunderstorm, the
American Henry George (also called Thorstein Veblen) dis
covered the l;!w of diminishing returns, and then, boy, the fat
was in the fire! Before you could say "knife," the Industrial
Revolution was on! Mechanization and steam power resulted in
prodigies of production. For example, a Welsh artisan named
Dylan Sigafoos before the Industrial Revolution used to make
horseshoes by hand at the rate of four a day. After the Indus
trial Revolution, with the aid of a steam engine, Sigafoos vat
*6lt to make entire horses.
And so it went-factories rising from the plains, cities bur
geoning around the factories, transport and commerce keeping
pace—until today, thanks to economics, we have smog, depres
sions, and economics textbooks at $5.50. ©m»* shuito«n. Ms
