# Final Elections to Start Today; Voided Contests to Be Re-run
## Primaries Called ‘Disappointing' by Election Officials 
### 
After what Election Board
Chairman Chuck 112 alkner termed
a "disappointing" turnout in the
primaries, students will return to
the polls today and tomorrow
to select the winners in this fall's
ASSU final elections.
Polls will be open in front of the
Mt:in Library today from 8:30 a.m.
to 3:30 p.m. and tomorrow from 8:30
a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
Village polls will be open from 11
a.m. to 1 p.m. both today and to
morrow.
Three of the 13 offices up for the
vote will undergo a re-run of the
primary contest, which was held
Monday and Tuesday.
Because of insufficient polling
hours at the Village and misprinted
ballots for the Women's Council
candidates, the LASSU decided on
Tuesday night that Men's Council,
Women's Council and Village pri
maries will be repeated today and
tomorrow and go up for the final
ballot Tuesday and Wednesday of
next week.
RUN-OFF
A run-off between three candi
dates on a closed ballot will be
necessary to determine the two final
candidates in the Branner legisla
ture representative contest.
Cynthia Ann Easley and Carolee
Houser tied at 25 votes apiece and
will enter with Joanne Savage, who
had 48 votes, to determine the two
candidates who will run in the final
election to be held next week.
A light touch in the primary pro
ceedings was supplied by a fictitious
candidate named Bob Wright, who
ran for frosh prexy and managed to
garner 21 votes and the reputation of
being an "all-around good guy."
WRITE-INS
Faikner reminded student voters
that, although no space is specifically
designated for write - ins on the
Women's Council, Men's Council
and Village ballots, write-ins are
permitted for those three offices.

dent are Douglas M. Brown and

dent, Judy Borg and Sue Solomon;
