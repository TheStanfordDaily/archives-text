# LASSU Vote Approves New Activity Book
## 
### EDA MENDELS Associate Editor, The Daily 
Printing of 500 copies of the
Axe Society activities handbook
was approved by the ASSU Leg
islature at its meeting Tuesday.
The exact method of raising the
$345.90 to finance the booklets has
not as yet been determined. The
Legislature has proposed charging a
subscription fee from every organi
zation to be listed in the booklet.
If the subscription fees can be
raised, they will cover half the cost.
The ASSU would pay the other half
from its contingency fund.
Unless the method of financing
the handbook is unsuccessful. Tues
day's action marks the last in a
year-long series of legislative dis
cussions and delays.
At a meeting of the old Executive
Committee in November last year,
the Axe Society was asked and
agreed to undertake the compilation
of a booklet listing all campus or
ganizations.
It was intended to be a complete
guide, including obscure honorary
societies as well as them more pub
licized major committees.
By March 1, the Axe Society had
completed its task of gathering and
writing data on 125 campus organi
zations. They were ready to print
the booklet, but held off to await
the fate of the new constitution.
Late in April the constitution was
passed, but the Axe Society Activi
ties Handbook never appeared be
fore the Legislature.
This fall the matter was raised
again, but financial difficulties de
layed publication. The ASSU has
only a small amount of unbudgeted
money in its contingency fund.
The Legislature debated exten
sively at several meetings regarding
the printing process to be used, the
number of copies to be printed, and
the recipients to whom the booklet
should go.
The Legislature approved mem
bers of a temporary Activities Eval
uation Committee. They are Jack
Kicliardson, chairman; and Yvonne
Irwin, Jerry Messner, Philip Olson.
Dr. Wilfred Stone and Harriet
Thomas.
Miss Adele Strogen, assistant dean
of women, and Kip Koss, chairman
of the student committee for the
Study of Undergraduate Education
and ASSU President George Ralph
are ex oflicio members.
