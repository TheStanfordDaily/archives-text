Rossotti's Beer Garden is facing a possible "keeping a disorderl ■
house" charge as an aftermath to last Friday's near-riot, in which
an officer was forced to hold a gun on the assembled crowd.
A State Alcoholic Beverage Control official revealed yesterday
that ABC agents are compiling a complete report of the incident.

It involved the arrest and subse-t
quent escape of an under - aged
drinker.
He was aided in his flight by the
crowd of more than 100 which had
gathered at Rossotti's.
Norbert L. Falvey said that no
accusation will be filed against Ros
sotti's <intil the report is completed.
Falvey is in charge of the ABC's
San Francisco District Office.
John F. Merrill, ABC assistant
area administrator, said the affair is
under "stern and intensive investi
gation" and that the student hang
out may lose its license.
OFFICIAL REPORT
The only official report which has
been filed is that of Woodside Pa
trolman Charles J. McAleer, who
held the gun on the crowd. McAleer
reports that when the crowd con
verged on him and the two ABC
agents and began threatening to turn
his car over he resorted to the re
volver.
The report states. '"I | McAleer |
pulled out my revolver, ordered them
not to take another step toward us,
and they immediately stopped, be
gan going backward, and dispersed."
McAleer's report explains that he
was called in by the ABC men alter
they had come upon an under-age
beer drinking student. They identi
fied him as from the University of
Southern California.
When the patrolman arrived at
Rossotti's, the report says, he was
told that the boy had escaped but
that the agents knew his name. It
goes on to say that when he was
leaving McAleer found his car key |
missing but that someone in the
crowd showed him where it had
been hidden, under the auto's seat.
Then the mob converged on the
car, shouting.
SHENANIGANS
"These shenanigans were simply
to divert attention from someone in
the mob, who went to the agents'
car and pulled the 'evidence' |a beer
bottle | therefrom and started to
run,"says the report.
The three gave chase but were
soon outdistanced, it notes. In the J
chase agent Cohn ripped his left
pants leg and had to retire from the j
quest.
Cohn commented that he'd "find
that kid if I have to go to the dean ;
of men and have a show-up of stu
dents."
Falvey said that the ABC is look- 1
ing for the run-away student and j
has "some kind of a lead." He.says j
his investigators have been checking i
with the Registrar's Office here. (It's ;
been alleged by some that the youth
was a Stanford student.)
DISCREPANCY
In explaining the discrepancy be
tween McAleer's report that he
pulled his gun and that of his agents ,
that he only threatened such action, j
Falvey says that his agents, "Might

►
not have seen everything that oc
cured."
The San Francisco News set the
scene like this:
"There |Rossotti's| they found .1
small horde of Stanford student:
nerving themselves on beer, for Sat
urday's game with the University < !
Washington, which ended in a 7-7
tie and could have been worse."
University administrators ha vi
commented that until they receive
a complete and true report of the
affair they will anticipate no action.
They point out that Rossotti's is oIT
campus, out of their jurisdiction,
and that there are only allegations
that Stanford students took part in
the affair.
H. Donald Winbigler, dean of j in
dents, had this to say:
"The University has received no
complaint from law enforcement
agencies regarding the incident. Our
information on the subject is limited
to the rumors and conjectures re
ported in press. This is nol an
adequate basis for action of the Uni
versity."
Meanwhile, the ABC search for
the fugitive with the false identifi
cation card and the Rossotti's patron
who smashed the beer bottle evi
dence continues.
