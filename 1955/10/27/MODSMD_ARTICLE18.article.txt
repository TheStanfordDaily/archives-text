Parliamentary procedure and rigmarole — the
common delaying factors in most Legislative
meetings -finally came to the aid of the AS
SU's legislative body Tuesday night.
By reconsidering a previously-passed motion
and then voting to table that motion, the Leg
islature managed to remove the proposed
amendment on the selection of the head cheer
leader from the final election ballot today and
tomorrow.
Without considering whether the proposed
change would be desirable or not, the Legis
lative wisely retracted an amendment which
would have baffled a completely uninformed
electorate. In fact, the amendment was ap
jvioved in such a rush partially by telephone

poll — that even members of the Legislature
weren't sure just what they were authorizing.
The situation, essentially, was this: Should
the candidates for head cheer leader be re
quired to have approval of a special selection
committee before they can run? That is the
way it stands now. Or should a nomination
petition alone—as for all other ASSU offices —
be sufficient? That is what the amendment
would have established.
Now there will be sufficient time for the
Legislature to weigh the issues. And for the
students to find out what is happening.
Since the purpose of the referendum was to
sound out student opinion on the issue, it is
only logical that the Legislature should allow
the students time to investigate both views.
