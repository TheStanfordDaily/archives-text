What do you think about Professor Wilfred
Stone's attack on such "wilting" traditions as
Back to the Farm Week and Rally Com just for
tradition's sake? ("From Another Viewpoint,"
Daily, Oct. 19).
Stone singled out four activities —rallies, Hell
Week, float building, and Back to the Farm
Week —as examples of student tradition which
require excessive student participation.
He cited these four as examples of activities
in which many students do not like to partici
pate and do not attend.
Students and faculty were contacted and
asked: "Do you agree with Stone? Why? If
you agree, what other activities would you
throw into the same category of useless activi
ties?
Points which were brought out in the inter
views were that:
1. There are useless activities being held on
the Stanford campus—such as Back to the Farm
Week and Row Carnival.
2. There are useful activities — such as
Spring Sing and Con Home Week.
3. Many students have been pressured into
working on these useless and time-consuming
activities.
4. Time spent on these useless activities de
tracts students from their main objective at
Stanford—an education.
Here are some comments of those inter
viewed:
Denny Murphy, '58, Phi Kappa Psi, Cardinals:
"I agree with Stone, because no one cares
about the activities he has mentioned and about
such activities as student elections and all Rally
Com activities."
Fred Krinard, '57, Encina: "It's a wonder to
me that we don't have a course in float building
and carnival managing here at Stanford. The
important traditions such as Spring Sing should
remain, but the insignificant ones that have
been mentioned plus Row Carnival should be
eliminated because of lack of interest and stu
dent participation which lead to wasted time."

John Hooper, History Department: "Some
studenis, I think, who have no interest in ac
tivities per se participate in them because of
social pressure. At the University of California
at Berkeley and the University of Washington,
both of which I have attended, there was less
pressure on students to join in activities."
Mark S. Ncmikos, graduate, off-campus:
"Such activities as he | Stone | mentioned might
be more profitably substituted by get-together
sessions which may promote Stanford's intel
lectual climate. Few of us should have any
trouble in finding occasions for unloading our
excess energy."
Lennart Palme, '56, Delta Tau Delta: "I do not
agree with Stone. I think most of the activities
he has mentioned appeal to «a good many
people. For instance, Back to the Farm Week's
get-together with the faculty was excellent."
Ed Munn, '57, Toy on, an ex-float chairman:
"Stone's article hits the nail squarely on the
head, particularly with respect to Back to the
Farm Week and the annual ordeal of float
building. The yearly spectacle in Frost | Am
phitheater |, where professors and students pa
rade wearing sheets, seems to be rather ridicu
lous."
Marilyn Kelly, '56, How Carnival worker: "At
our house there are steep fines for not partici
pating in some activities. They shouldn't be
compulsory."
Hobert M. Prockrass, Communications-Jour
nalism Department: "Students don't have time
for trivial activities. I don't mean to say stu
dents should work all the time, but such activi
ties as Hell Week are bad. Hell Week has
given Stanford a bad name."
Jody Moise, '58: "With things like Rally
Com, once you've got them set up, you can't
do much because we have to keep up our repu
tation with the other schools on the coast.
Things like Olympic Day are good chances to
go out and drink beer at Rudy's, but you can
do that any time."

Com activities."
Fred Krinard, '57, Encina: "It's a wonder to
me that we don't have a course in float building
and carnival managing here at Stanford. The
important traditions such as Spring Sing should
remain, but the insignificant ones that have
been mentioned plus Row Carnival should be
eliminated because of lack of interest and stu
dent participation which lead to wasted time."

John Hooper, History Department: "Some
studenis, I think, who have no interest in ac
tivities per se participate in them because of
social pressure. At the University of California
at Berkeley and the University of Washington,
both of which I have attended, there was less
pressure on students to join in activities."
Mark S. Ncmikos, graduate, off-campus:
"Such activities as he | Stone | mentioned might
be more profitably substituted by get-together
sessions which may promote Stanford's intel
lectual climate. Few of us should have any
trouble in finding occasions for unloading our
excess energy."
Lennart Palme, '56, Delta Tau Delta: "I do not
agree with Stone. I think most of the activities
he has mentioned appeal to «a good many
people. For instance, Back to the Farm Week's
get-together with the faculty was excellent."
Ed Munn, '57, Toy on, an ex-float chairman:
"Stone's article hits the nail squarely on the
head, particularly with respect to Back to the
Farm Week and the annual ordeal of float
building. The yearly spectacle in Frost | Am
phitheater |, where professors and students pa
rade wearing sheets, seems to be rather ridicu
lous."
Marilyn Kelly, '56, How Carnival worker: "At
our house there are steep fines for not partici
pating in some activities. They shouldn't be
compulsory."
Hobert M. Prockrass, Communications-Jour
nalism Department: "Students don't have time
for trivial activities. I don't mean to say stu
dents should work all the time, but such activi
ties as Hell Week are bad. Hell Week has
given Stanford a bad name."
Jody Moise, '58: "With things like Rally
Com, once you've got them set up, you can't
do much because we have to keep up our repu
tation with the other schools on the coast.
Things like Olympic Day are good chances to
go out and drink beer at Rudy's, but you can
do that any time."
What do you think?
What do you think about Professor Wilfred
Stone's attack on such "wilting" traditions as
Back to the Farm Week and Rally Com just for
tradition's sake? ("From Another Viewpoint,"
Daily, Oct. 19).
Stone singled out four activities —rallies, Hell
Week, float building, and Back to the Farm
Week —as examples of student tradition which
require excessive student participation.
He cited these four as examples of activities
in which many students do not like to partici
pate and do not attend.
Students and faculty were contacted and
asked: "Do you agree with Stone? Why? If
you agree, what other activities would you
throw into the same category of useless activi
ties?
Points which were brought out in the inter
views were that:
1. There are useless activities being held on
the Stanford campus—such as Back to the Farm
Week and Row Carnival.
2. There are useful activities — such as
Spring Sing and Con Home Week.
3. Many students have been pressured into
working on these useless and time-consuming
activities.
4. Time spent on these useless activities de
tracts students from their main objective at
Stanford—an education.
