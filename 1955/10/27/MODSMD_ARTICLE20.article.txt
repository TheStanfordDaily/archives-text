bike hazard
To the Editor:
As one who drives regularly between campus and
the Village. I would like to call attention to another
of our traffic problems which I hope* the Traffic Com
mittee will take into consideration.
• Palm Drive was very wide for the horse-anc!-buggy
days. However, it was not made wide enough for the
lour lanes of traffic it digests during rush hours in
1955. The street handles traffic very well as long as
the flow of cars moves evenly. But the traffic How is
disrupted by the bicycles, even though the cyclists do
their best to stay at the right. The road simply isn't
wide enough for comfort.
Many motorists pass the cyclists much too closely
for safety, while other cars veer into the left lane, a
lane which is already too full to take many more cars.
Either way—changing lanes suddenly or practically
sideswiping the bicycles—is not too healthy.
It occurred to me that pedestrian traffic could get
by well enough with one of Palm Drive's sidewalks,
and the other could be restricted to bicycle traffic.
I am suggesting this with the idea that it would serve
as a temporary safety measure until the new, over-all
traffic plan is put into operation.

speaking frankly
To the Editor:
Until Monday night I thought I was alone in my
political beliefs. Everywhere I had looked I saw
posters declaring what the UN should do, not what it
does. I overlooked the UN card stunt at the UCLA
"ame with the greatest difficulty, and my morale was
not helped by the special services and displays for
the UN during the last week.
I was happily surprised to see a large number of
supporters of Senator Knowland at Mem Aud. I don't
know il they were students or not; nevertheless, my
faith in this University was strengthened consider
ably.
Thanks to the Political Union and the lIR for pre
senting a speaker who spoke frankly and truthfully
about the UN, our "allies," and our foreign policy.
May I suggest that anyone disagreeing with me
visit me at Rineonada P»O9 and save The Daily space.
However, come early—my room holds only 400 and
my roommate hates crowds.

hypocrisy
To the Editor:
I should like to protest the frequent and not wholly
sincere political references to God's guidance and His
divine providence for the United States of America.
Senator Khowland's speech on campus Monday is a
case in point. For Senator Knowland, as for many
U.S. political figures, God is a supernatural ally in all
America's varied and inconsistent policies. Is God
really on our side? No one knows, of course, but I
suggest that God does not take sides at all but judges
every nation in terms of its particular righteousness.
Can we sincerely say that we Americans are so far
above self-interest, greed, and moral blindness that
we warrant God's complete support?
And as for the trust in God which Senator Know
land publicly avowed—is this a reality to us or do
we actually trust only in our guns and bombs? Very
few of us could honestly say with the Psalmist of the
Bible: "Thou are my King, G' God . . . through thee
will we push down our enemies . . . For I will not
trust in my bow, neither shall my s'word save me."
I, for one, do not believe in the sincerity of those
who use God's name so glibly. We should always re
member that, as Jesus pointed out to the Pharisees,
hypocrisy is hated hv God above all things!

no basis in fact
To the Editor:
Having been on the Stanford University campus
since the beginning of autumn quarter, I would like
to make a few conscientious remarks.
1 graduated from Ohio State University and served
in the United States Marine Corps for two years. I
have traveled enough and seen enough to make com
parisons on various aspects of life.
One observation that I made immediately upon ar
riving here was the attitude of the Stanford women.
It seems that the ratio factor has completely gone to
their heads and it's not because this isn't the natural
thing to do, but there isn't any basis in fact for such
action.
I have been told that the women students at the
University of California are a little conceited, but
that there is at least some basis for it.
If I am looking through the wrong color of glasses
I would welcome any and all comments.
