# Scholar Gaigg Is Proud of Austria's Freedom, Anti-Communist Sentiments
## Major Problem Now Is Economic, He Says 
### GERRY SMITH 
After living through his native
Austria's 17 years of foreign oc
cupation, ASSU foreign scholar
Gerfrid Gaigg is "very, very
glad" Austria is again frea.
'"Austria's major problem now is
economic — she must prove that,
though she is small, she can stand
on her own two feet," Gaigg com
mented.
The method by which the Austrian
government is now operating is al
mo-t a one-party system. Since 1945
the two major parties (Conservatives
and Socialists) have formed a coali
tion government.
There are big differences in the
aims of the two parties, the young
Austrian noted. But both parties
know that the only way to help the
country is to work together.
Gaigg is proud of the anti-Com
munist feelings of his country. "The
real success of the Austrian govern
ment was in pushing all Communists
out of office. Austria is the only
country occupied by Russia that
had no Communist government."
POLITICAL SCIENCE STUDENT
A 23-year-old graduate in politi
cal science, he already has a law de
gree from the University of Inns
bruck. After he finishes his educa
tion he plans to enter the foreign
office of the Austrian government.
Gaigg has traveled in France,
Great Britain and over most of the
Continent. He was born in Salsburg
and has lived in Austria most of
his life.
Although he likes the United

States very much, Gaigg, in common
with many other foreign students at
Stanford, misses the discussions on
topics common in European univer
sities.
But this is to be expected in the
United States for two reasons, ac
cording to Gaigg.
POLITICAL ISSUES
The first is that political issues
very important to Europe just don't
exist in the United States. Secondly,
the European younger generation
has been made critical because of
so many sudden political changes.

"Quick change breeds pessimism," |
he continued. "When a new policy
or government is introduced, the ,
people wait and see how it will work ;
before approving it. Besides, "there
is not the party difference here as
on the Continent."
After arriving in New York, Gaigg
Hew to Chicago, where he met a
friend and the two of them drove on
to Stanford. He is very impressed
with the "tremendous size" of the
United States, after seeing only the
small countries of Europe.
"EVERYONE IS FRIENDLY"
Gaigg feels Stanford is very dif- i
ferent from the University of Inns
bruck, but "ut the same time I like
it very much." There is a certain
spirit here—everyone is so friendly."
This quarter he is living at the
Theta Xi house, which he enjoys i
thoroughly.
He has noticed many differences j
between his university and Stanford i
and especially appreciates the "out
standing relationship between stu
dent and teacher. In Austria you
don't dare to bother the professor j
with your little problems."
In conclusion the young Austrian i
complimented the foreign scholar
ship program here. "It makes a real
contribution to international under
standing, not only for the foreign
scholar, but for the American stu
dent, who can hear of Europe's prob
lems as they actually are. It is a
chance to hear both sides and judge
objectively."
