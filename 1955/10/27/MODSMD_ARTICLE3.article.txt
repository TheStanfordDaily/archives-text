# Stanford Players' Opener Has ‘Sparking Moments'
## 'Plodding Production' Characterizes Stanford Version of Giraudoux Farce 'Amphitryon 38’ 
### RICHARD MENDE 
Paganism was given a good chance for revival when Jean Girau
doux wrote his delightfully depraved farce "Amphitryon 38" in
which Greek gods are once more shown romping around among
mortals.
But producing his play is hazardous because Giraudoux's chief
strength, his ability to combine a*

ribald wit with warm, human char
acterizations, is likely to end up as
either a collection of tawdry jokes
glibly spoken or a plodding produc
tion in which the sparkling wit rare
ly filters through.
BRIGHT MOMENTS
The Stanford Players' production
unfortunately tended to fall into the
latter trap but the evening was not
without its bright moments. Judith
Doty gave a convincing perform
ance as the faithful Alkmena, and
Merritt Johnson, when he didn't
have to contend with a menacing
beard, came through with some
highly entertaining scenes as an
amorous Jupiter, but both had diffi
culty in delivering the fast-paced
lines crisply. Hart Sprager was a
sound and at times even inspired
Amphitryon.
David Whorf was an especially
droll Mercury, and special thanks
ought to be given to Charles Lyons,
the Trumpeter whose instrument
could play only one note. Settings
designed by Wendell Cole left little
to be desired in that department.
The Theban legend — which ac
cording to Mr. Giraudoux had been
cast into play form 37 times before
"Amphitryon .'3B" was written —con-
cerns the problems that arise when
the object of Jupiter's latest mortal
love turns out to be not only faith
fully married but insistent upon re
maining so, divinity or no.
DECEPTION
Jupiter, who is somewhat taken
aback at this first outright and rath
er embarrassing refusal of his
charms, stoops to deception. This
works. But feeling lowered by any
thing so un-godlike, he decides to
offer himself in his unsullied majes
tic splendor—and is flatly refused.
Alkmena's fidelity triumphs over
everything, physical attraction, pres
tige, and even maybe love and the
play ends in a burst of typical
Giraudoux whimsicality.
You don't have to know Greek
mythology to understand the play,
but it might be something to think
about during some of the slower
moving scenes in this production.
