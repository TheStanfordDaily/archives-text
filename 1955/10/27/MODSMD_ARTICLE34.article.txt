# Indian Gridders Improve In Health; Beatie Out
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Stanford's football fortunes seemingly took an upswing yester
day afternoon as Chuck Taylor ran the Indians through a practice
session with the squad sick-list only about half the length it had
been the day before.
End John Stewart and quarterback Jerry Gustafson were both

suited up and apparently in good*
shape after bouts with flu.
Both will find that their troubles
are not entirely over, however. The
two seniors have been pushed out |
of first-string births by juniors Carl
Isaacs and John Brodie, and have
their work cut out to re-earn start
ing positions.
Guard Fritz Furlanic, another flu !
victim, also worked out yesterday I
and should be in top shape by the
end of the week.
HARRINGTON BETTER
Possibly the most encouraging
news of the day was the improve
ment shown by fullback A 1 Har
rington. Harrington, a J.C. transfer
with rave notices, has been ham
| per?d all season by a chronically
weak ankle.
Monday afternoon Harrington was
| given an injection in the sore ankle,
: ami, according to Trainer Connie
j Jarvis, has shown rather remarkable
improvement, since then.
On the debit side, starting right
i end Jerry Beatie is still out with the
flu virus. Whether Beatie will be all
right in time for the game is ques
tionable. Meanwhile soph Gary Van
Gal der has moved up into Beatie's
j position.
FEIIRING ILL
i The flu germ seems finally to have
i made a complete round of the squad,
j and is moving right up to the coach
j ing staff. Assistant coach Dutch
j Fehring missed yesterday's practice
I session with a dose of the same
malady.
Reserve halfback Bill Burget and
! starting JV erfd Frank Hook both
| are out for the week with finger in
i juries.
I
Casulties of a Monday passing
' drill are Hook with a split finger

and Burget with a pinkie that was
banged hard enough to require hos
pital attention.
BLOW TO BRAVES
If Hook is out of the Ford Ord
game Saturday it will be a severe
blow to the Braves' fortunes. He
has been a mainstay of the JV's this
year, and with two varsity ends ail
ing, Taylor probably will not be able
to spare another man for the Braves.
As announced earlier in the week,
halfbacks Ernie Dorn and Lou Valli
will be out for the remainder of the
season, Dorn with a broken shoulder
and Valli with a knee injury.
In yesterday's session Taylor
placed the emphasis on defensive
work, possibly anticipating more
trouble with the Spartan offense
now that it seems sure that quarter
back Tony Teresa and fullback Joe
Ulm will be able to play for San
Jose.
