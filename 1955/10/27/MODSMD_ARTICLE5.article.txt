## 
### WALLY SIMPSON 
The mock Security Council
session composed of 11 Stanford
foreign and American students
voted last night against placing
the Moroccan guestion upon the
agenda of the Security Council.
The decision to refuse to consider
the question was arrived at on the
grounds that the UN Charter forbids
consideration of internal questions.
The question was introduced by
the delegate representing Iran, Mar
wan Shihabi. It was Iran's conten
tion that it should be included be
cause French promises to the Mo
roccan people were not upheld; the
French administration has been
poor; and the Treaty of 1912, by
which France established her pro
tectorate over Morocco, was forced
upon the Sultan of Morocco.
The Peruvian delegate; Gregory
Loew, was quick to point out, how
ever, that in 1952 the International
Court had ruled that the treaty in
question was valid.
The Russian delegate. Bruce Mc-
Connach. who really hails from Scot
land, claimed that the Moroccan
dispute was definitely a threat to
the peace and security of the world
because, among other reasons, the
United States has established mili
tary and aii - bases in Morocco which
are intended for militarist purposes.
He also claimed that the Moroccan
peoples were also being burdened
by increased U. S. capitalistic ex
ploitation.
Walt Hays, the U. S. delegate,
countered the Soviet charge by as
serting that the United States be
lieves in the self-determination prin
ciple, not just with words but with
deeds. .
Those voting for placing the reso
lution on the agenda were China,
Iran, Turkey and the U. S. S. R.
Those against were Belgium, Brazil,
France, New Zealand, Peru, the
United Kingdom and the United
States.
