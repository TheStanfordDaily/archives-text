# Stanford Gridders Host San Jose State Spartans
## Hosts Seek Revenge for '54 Upset; John Stewart Named Game Captain 
### JIM BAKER 
Stanford's up-and-down gridders meet a once-beaten San Jose
State team tomorrow afternoon at 2 in Stanford Stadium.
The Indians, with their record of two victories, two losses, and
one tie, are 13-point favorites over the Spartans, who were unde
feated until last week.
John Stewart, who has been on the sick list for the last week,

was named team captain for the
contest.
When quizzed about the game,
coach Chuck Taylor said the Cards
will "have to play their best game"
in order to beat the Spartans.
In the past, Stanford had always
been able to beat the Spartans, a
fact which was attributed to the
Stanford "jinx."
But the jinx was broken last year,
when the Spartans, after a defeat by
COP. walked off with a 19-14 vic
tory over the Cards.
San Jose's only loss this year has
been to COP.
It all goes to show that Stanford
might have a tough battle on its
hands tomorrow.
TEAM HEALTHY
Taylor indicated that the team is
healthy to a man, but there is a
possibility that Jeri McMillin, start
ing halfback, may not play because
of a serious illness in his family.
McMillin spent most of the day
Wednesday at the bedside of his
sister, Donna, who was critically ill
following a tonsillectomy. She is
improved now, and McMillin has
declared that he would like to play.
Bob Bronzan, coach of the San
Jose team, stated that "Stanford can
be beaten by speed," an opinion
which has been held by other Card
opponents.
SAN JOSE HAS SPEED
"Except for Michigan State, we
have as much speed as Stanford has
faced this year," Bronzan also de
clared.
He said the Spartans will attempt
to make quick openings for his scat
backs to go through. The Spartans
use the split T formation.
A 1 Harrington, sophomore Indian
fullback, will be ready to go at full
speed tomorrow following special
treatment for the ankle which has
been giving him trouble all season.
Dutch Fehring, line coach, was
still sick with the flu, but is ex
pected to recover in time for the
game.
Spartan fullback Joe Ulm, half
back Stan Beasley, and quarterback
Tony Teresa were all injured last
week in the COP game. But they're
ready to go now, showing "rare
form" in practice, according to
Bronson.
In one last move calculated to sac
rifice weight for speed, Bronzan put
203-pound Bob Light in right tackle
replacing 244-pound A 1 Severino.

one tie, are 13-point favorites over the Spartans, who were unde
feated until last week.
John Stewart, who has been on the sick list for the last week,

was named team captain for the
contest.
When quizzed about the game,
coach Chuck Taylor said the Cards
will "have to play their best game"
in order to beat the Spartans.
In the past, Stanford had always
been able to beat the Spartans, a
fact which was attributed to the
Stanford "jinx."
But the jinx was broken last year,
when the Spartans, after a defeat by
COP. walked off with a 19-14 vic
tory over the Cards.
San Jose's only loss this year has
been to COP.
It all goes to show that Stanford
might have a tough battle on its
hands tomorrow.
TEAM HEALTHY
Taylor indicated that the team is
healthy to a man, but there is a
possibility that Jeri McMillin, start
ing halfback, may not play because
of a serious illness in his family.
McMillin spent most of the day
Wednesday at the bedside of his
sister, Donna, who was critically ill
following a tonsillectomy. She is
improved now, and McMillin has
declared that he would like to play.
Bob Bronzan, coach of the San
Jose team, stated that "Stanford can
be beaten by speed," an opinion
which has been held by other Card
opponents.
SAN JOSE HAS SPEED
"Except for Michigan State, we
have as much speed as Stanford has
faced this year," Bronzan also de
clared.
He said the Spartans will attempt
to make quick openings for his scat
backs to go through. The Spartans
use the split T formation.
A 1 Harrington, sophomore Indian
fullback, will be ready to go at full
speed tomorrow following special
treatment for the ankle which has
been giving him trouble all season.
Dutch Fehring, line coach, was
still sick with the flu, but is ex
pected to recover in time for the
game.
Spartan fullback Joe Ulm, half
back Stan Beasley, and quarterback
Tony Teresa were all injured last
week in the COP game. But they're
ready to go now, showing "rare
form" in practice, according to
Bronson.
In one last move calculated to sac
rifice weight for speed, Bronzan put
203-pound Bob Light in right tackle
replacing 244-pound A 1 Severino.
Stanford's up-and-down gridders meet a once-beaten San Jose
