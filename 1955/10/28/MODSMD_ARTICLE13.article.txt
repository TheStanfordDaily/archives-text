### 
Seven Journalists Plan
Visit to Farm Campus
Seven Russion journalists will
be among the spectators at the
Stanford-San Jose State football
game tomorrow.
According to Frederic O. Glover,
assistant to the president, the seven
newsmen have decided to visit the
Stanford campuß as part of their
month-long tour of the United
States.
Arriving in New York on Oct. 17. j
the delegation visited that city, Chi- I
cago and Cleveland.
According to Boris Nikolaevich j
Kanpov-Polevoy, secretary of the ;
governing board of the Union of
Soviet Writers and spokesman for
the group, the purpose of journal
ists' visit is to "see in America ev- :
erything worth seeing—the best of ;
things."
STOCK EXCHANGE
One of the places the Russian del
egation visited was the New York
Stock Exchange. There the theory
of supply and demand with its bear
ing on the fluctuating stock market
was explained in detail to the visit- I
ing newsmen.
The journalists themselves, how- I
ever, "appeared to be more interest
ed in the annunciator boards that
call members to their telephone
booths than in any other market
features."
The journalists also visited the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York, where a class of visiting
Brooklyn sixth graders promptly !
"overwhelmed them" with questions,
much to the delight of the delega
tion.
MUSEUMS IMPRESSIVE
The writers were impressed by
the use made of museums by Ameri
can schools, art students and pro
fessional peoples.
Yesterday the Russian newsmen
visited Reno, Nov., where they got
their first taste of gambling. One of
the writers spent a nickel in a slot
machine but won nothing.
Later that evening the delegation
visited the Palace Club and watched
the proceedings with interest. One
of the writers was escorted over to
a table of "21" by one of the owners
who gave him 20 silver dollars with
which to bet.
GAMBLING LOSS
The visiting journalist lost $3 on
the first hand and, confused, left the
table. The owner promptly garnered
the remaining $17 from him.
Still confused, the writer wanted
to know how much he owed, appar
ently thinking he had to pay money
for the mere privilege of gambling.
The Russians were then given
quantities of nickels to put in the
slot machines. None were observed
to be winning, however.
When asked political questions by J
newsmen the Russian journalists as
serted that they were neither min
isters nor politicians. They said they ■
were optimists.
LOWER BARRIERS
They said that they were hoping
to do everything they could to lower
the barriers between the United
States and Russia. They expressed
the hope that their American col
leagues would do the same.
Today the delegation will meet i
Governor Goodwin J. Knight in Sac
ramento before proceeding to San
Francisco. The governor delayed a
scheduled 7 a.m. departure for San j
Francisco to welcome the newsmen j
to California.

fessional peoples.
Yesterday the Russian newsmen
visited Reno, Nov., where they got
their first taste of gambling. One of
the writers spent a nickel in a slot
machine but won nothing.
Later that evening the delegation
visited the Palace Club and watched
the proceedings with interest. One
of the writers was escorted over to
a table of "21" by one of the owners
who gave him 20 silver dollars with
which to bet.
GAMBLING LOSS
The visiting journalist lost $3 on
the first hand and, confused, left the
table. The owner promptly garnered
the remaining $17 from him.
Still confused, the writer wanted
to know how much he owed, appar
ently thinking he had to pay money
for the mere privilege of gambling.
The Russians were then given
quantities of nickels to put in the
slot machines. None were observed
to be winning, however.
When asked political questions by J
newsmen the Russian journalists as
serted that they were neither min
isters nor politicians. They said they ■
were optimists.
LOWER BARRIERS
They said that they were hoping
to do everything they could to lower
the barriers between the United
States and Russia. They expressed
the hope that their American col
leagues would do the same.
Today the delegation will meet i
Governor Goodwin J. Knight in Sac
ramento before proceeding to San
Francisco. The governor delayed a
scheduled 7 a.m. departure for San j
Francisco to welcome the newsmen j
to California.
Seven Journalists Plan
Visit to Farm Campus
Seven Russion journalists will
be among the spectators at the

According to Frederic O. Glover,

Kanpov-Polevoy, secretary of the ;
governing board of the Union of
Soviet Writers and spokesman for
the group, the purpose of journal
ists' visit is to "see in America ev- :
erything worth seeing—the best of ;
things."
STOCK EXCHANGE
One of the places the Russian del
egation visited was the New York
Stock Exchange. There the theory
of supply and demand with its bear
ing on the fluctuating stock market
was explained in detail to the visit- I
ing newsmen.
The journalists themselves, how- I
ever, "appeared to be more interest
ed in the annunciator boards that
call members to their telephone
booths than in any other market
features."
The journalists also visited the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York, where a class of visiting
Brooklyn sixth graders promptly !
"overwhelmed them" with questions,
much to the delight of the delega
tion.
MUSEUMS IMPRESSIVE
The writers were impressed by
the use made of museums by Ameri
can schools, art students and pro
fessional peoples.
