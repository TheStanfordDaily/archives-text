# Sam McDonald Doing Well After Leg Amputation
## 
### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
In a sunlit, flower-filled room on the first floor of the Palo Alto
Hospital, Emanuel B. McDonald sits and rests and thinks about his
friends. Most of those friends know him as "Sam"—Sam Mc-
Donald.
Sam needs the rest, according to his doctors, for he's recovering

from a leg amputation performed 10
days ago.
The amputation was necessary,
according to Dr. Blake Wilbur, phy
sician in charge of the case, because
Sam had developed an ulcer on his
right ankle which refused to heal.
For some time it was feared that
infection might spread from the
right leg and infect his other one,
even after the amputation.
Dr. Wilbur explained that a "sym
pathectomy," an operation in which
the sympathetic nerve which con
trols the veins in the leg is severed,
had peen peformed and would rule
out the possibility of complications
occurring.
DIABETES
Besides his leg trouble, Sam was
found to have a diabetic condition,
something he had not suspected.
However, say doctors, he is doing
well and may be released in six to
eight weeks.
"He's old," said Mrs. Rosella With
gitt, one of three special nurses as
signed to him; "he's tired and he's
slowed down, but the doctors are
satisfied with his progress."
Sam hasn't had many visitors since
his operation. Cards, letters, and
telegrams have been pouring in from
his friends all over the country, but
doctors thought he was still too
weak to see anyone.
STUDENT INTEREST
Yesterday, however, he heard that
many of the students were asking
about him and wondering what his
condition is.
So Sam McDonald asked that he
be allowed to thank everyone for
their kindness and their concern.
Sam still won't be allowed to have
many visitors for a while, but he
managed to talk for 10 minutes
about his friends.
Sam has many friends. Some are
still here on the Farm, while others,
graduates and faculty of the last 50
years, are scattered all over the
United States.
More recent inhabitants of the
Farm probably reme m be r Sam
mostly as chief cook and presiding
spirit of the annual Con Home Ban
quet, as which he supervises the
mammoth barbecue which climaxes
a week of work and activities.
But Sam is much more intimately
related with the Stanford tradition—
for over 50 years hp has been a part
of it.
MANY FRIENDS
He made many friends during his
career here. Fifty-four of them re
turned here last year to attend a
testimonial banquet upon his re
tirement. The guest list reads like
a Who's Who of Stanford greats.
That year he published his auto
biography. "Sam McDonald's Farm,"
and. characteristically, turned all
the royalties over to the Con Home.
Now that Sam McDonald is away
from his beloved Con Home, the let
ters and good wishes keep coming
in by the thousands, hoping that
he'll be back there soon.
