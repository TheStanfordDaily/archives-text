A "one-party press"?
With election year drawing near again,
American newspapers are bsginning to handle
the mo: ass of news items which will chronicle
the campaign.
During the coming months, newspapers will
assume an editorial stand behind one candidate
or another.
Ans if the fourth estate is consistent with its
own record of previous elections, the Republi
can, candidate will be supported by three or
fblif to one.over the Democrat.
Herein lies the great freedom of the press -
expression of opinion on the editorial pages.
In this sense, a "one-pariy press" might con
ceivably exist.
But such an editorial "one-party press" is
qui.e different from the charges inferred by the
term during the 1952 elections.
It was the charge of slanted news writing and
prejudiced news play that has been implied by
"one-party press."
To this accusation, the vast majority of news
papers pleads not guilty. Facts back them up.
An extensive survey made by Nathan B.
Blumberg of activity of 35 representative news
papers during the 1952 campaign revealed a
high degree of impartiality and fairness.
Of 26 pro-Eisenhower newspapers, 11 actu

ally gave Democrats more front page space.
All of the pro-Stevenson papers studied gave
ths Democrats more front page room.
There were notable exceptions, of course.
No one can expect a newspaper like the Chi
cago Tribune to be impartial. (Those who read
the Tribune usually know what they have paid
for anyway.)
A half-dozen of the 35 newspapers studied
provided evidence of some partiality in their
handling of news.
The reader skeptical of such surveys can
inspect for himself the coverage given the 1952
campaign by newspapers such as the New
York Times, Philadelphia Evening Bulletin, Des
Moines Register, and many others.
Read again what candidate Adlai Stevenson
said in 1952: "I am glad to pay this tribute to
the press. It is true, and I think it should be
said, I am grateful for the impartiality and full
ness of your news columns. . .
Consider finally that in 38 presidential elec
tions in America, the candidate supported by
the majority of newspapers has won only 19
times.
Ponder these facts and then determine just
hew far the "one-party press" extends in Amer
ica, what its influence is, and how much truth
is in the whimpers from certain political fac
tions.
