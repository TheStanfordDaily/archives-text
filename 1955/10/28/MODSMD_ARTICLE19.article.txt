slap in the face
To the Editor:
We would like to question the editorial good sense
displayed by The Daily in running the series of articles
this week on last Fiiday's Alpine Road "gun-pulling''
incident. While appreciating the journalistic spirit
shown bv The Daily in an effort to "print the facts,"
we wonder whether in this case discretion might have
proved the better part of valoi.
While the particular staff of The Daily may not feel
that they owe Rossotti's any debt of gratitude, I think
it would not be an overstatement to say that the ma
jority of Stanford students do. Therefore we were
very sorry to see a publication that represents the
student body pay such sensationalized attention to an
unfortunate incident that could have been easily for
gotten.
The excessive adverse publicity created for Ros
sotti's by The Daily can only make a difficult job more
difficult for the owners. The crusading zeal can only
seem to them like a deliberate slap in the face from the
hand they fed.
We hope The Daily will consider the problem of
practical neighborly relations the next time it faces
a similar situation. We also hope that it will think
twice next time before commtting itself to an editorial
policy that a majority of the student body it repre
sents might disapprove of.

(Editor's note: If Rossotti's loses its liquor license,
we suggest that the cause lies with the Alcoholic
Beverage Control Department and the Stanford stu
dents who caused the near-riot last week.
(Why did the ABC invite itself to Rossotti's in the
first place? And do you expect any diligent law en
forcement agency to forget an escaped suspect, ef
forts to obstruct officers, a gun-pulling incident, a
near-riot—all in one package?
(Perhaps Rossotti's is owed a debt of gratitude.
If so, the patrons of last Friday should have been the
first to perform their obligations. The near-riot
appears to he a deliberate slap in the face from the
very ones who were partaking of Rossotti's service.
(In addition, the fact that a gun was drawn by an
officer on a group of students cannot he quickly
forgotten. This situation should be pointed out.
Unjustified, careless use of a revolver by an officer
is. to say the least, dangerous. Riots and nedt-riots
are also dangerous and are quite pertinent to The
Daily when they involve Stanford students. We
don't know whether the gun-pulling was justified or
not, but in any case, the incident should not he ig
nored.)
social insecurity
To the Editor:
In reference to Mr. Stone's article ridiculing vari
ou.; established student activities, and the following
urvey of student opinion (which was largely in ac
cord with him), I would- like to go on record as say
ing llial this anti-activity type of thinking is basically
immature, an expression of frustration.
If. seems to me that the people who constantly
knock activities are doin'* so not through intellectual
ch : i ion. but through their own social insecurity.
When I first came t<5 Stanford, I also felt hesitant
;.i).-)ut entering student activities. But I later discov
ered that my hesitance was caused by a fear of not
ueceeding, rather than any intrinsic aversion.
In general, student activities are as valuable to the
growth of the student as studies. Each has its place,
one for the development of a healthy social conscious
ness, the other for the development of the intellect.
I believe that the activity-knockers are exhibiting
a lack of the former.

misidentity
To the Editor:
I see my name erroneously used in yesterday's
Daily (in "What Do You Think?") as having ex
pressed an opinion of the worth of Rally Com and
student elections.
Your reporter would do well to assure himself of
the identity of those he interviews for publication.
DENNIS MURPHY
lack of familiarity
To the Editor:
The letters in The Daily criticizing A1 Brouse's re
buttal speech appear to be due to a lack of familiarity
with the operation of the Political Union on this and
other campuses. A free exchange of ideas between
the guest speaker and the students who participate
in the discussion is of essence in this organization.
Neither letter mentions specifically the remarks by
Brouse which they consider rude or inappropriate.
Certainly there was no disrespect in these remarks:
1) that the UN ought to be mentioned as a means of
achieving peace since it was UN day; 2) that Senator
Knowland had not defined his terms in "peace with
honor"; 3) that he (Brouse) could speak candidly
since he was not a candidate for public office.
There was nothing objectionable in the manner
Brouse made these remarks, and he should be com
mended for the sincere and successful effort made to
reveal the weaknesses in Senator Knowland's speech.
As to the specific criticism that "Stanford's good
name may be involved," it can be pointed out that
the University administration after the first year of
the union dropped the requirement that it be an
nounced that "the views expressed during the meet
ing do not represent Stanford University" because it
was obvious that they didn't represent the Univer
sity's view, but only the particular speaker's.
WAYNE FULLER
groping for poor taste
To the Editor:
The rebuttal of Senator Knowland's speech by Mr.
Brouse was the weakest, most ineffective public
speaking I've ever heard. The Senator did not discuss
any controversial issues, but Mr. Brouse thought it
necessary to grope for very pointed comments —in
poor taste—in order to build a feasible argument.
Cases in point are: 1) the justification for speaking
'"candidly" because he was not a candidate for any
office; 2) the remark about isolationist foreign policy
being gone and in the grave, an obvious attempted
pun aimed at the late Senator Taft; and 3) the refer
ence to Mr. Truman "not knowing what to do, but
doing what he thought was right" at the outbreak
of the Korean War.
These men are statesmen whether we like them or
not, and who is Mr. Brouse to publicly attempt to
discredit them at the expense of a weak rebuttal of
a fine speech? . . .
MARTIN J. BRUCKNER
not a chorus line
To the Editor:
The purpose of the pompon girls at Stanford is to
unify the girls and co-ordinate the movement of their
pompons, not to provide a chorus line for the pleasure
of the men's rooting section. Simplicity and conform
ity in the routines are necessary so that the pompon
girls may adequately guide the girls' rooting section.
Stanford has long held a position of respect and
esteem in its rating on the Pacific Coast. The pompon
girls can only attempt to represent Stanford students,
faculty, and alumni in a manner consistent with the
high reputation of the University.
