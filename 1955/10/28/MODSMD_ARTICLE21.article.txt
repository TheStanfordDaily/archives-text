# Propriety Highlights Stanford Courtship
## 
### DOROTHY CAMPBELL 
Throughout her life, lane La
throp Stanford, wife of Stan
ford's founder, had a fear of be
ing inspected and discussed by
a vulgar and curious public. For
this reason she remained a
stranger to many.
Jane Eliza Lathrop was born in
Albany, N.Y., on Aug. 25. 1828.
At 20 she had her first date with
a young man who called on her sev
eral times, and who had been ap
proved by her family. Unwilling to
go alone with him to the theater, she
insisted her sister accompany them.
Her sister, properly instructed in the
manners of the day, was told not to
laugh loudly during the perform
ance.
When the scene became amusing,
she reached into her pocket for a
handkerchief to smother her laugh
ter. Instead, to the horror of her sis
ter Jane, she pulled out a seemingly
endless long white stocking. Poor
Jane was so mortified that she re
fused to speak to the young man
again.
But young Leland Stanford
matched Jane's shyness and insist
ence on propriety. At that time he
was splitting cordwood for his fa
ther to earn money for school.
He made it a point never to drive
past Miss Lathrop's home for fear
she would see him in a red flannel
shirt and woolen muffler with his
face blue from cold.
They were engaged before he left

for the West, and married in 1850.
In Sacramento were they moved
after lour years, they lived in a small
hotel room. Only a stove and two
beds were bought. The rest of the
furniture was hand made from
packing boxes and boards.
This first home contrasted with
their later San Francisco residence.
Here signs of the zodiac were in
black mosaic on white stone in the
entrance hall. Ceilings had been
painted by famous Italian artists.
Included in the house were a library,
conservatory, art gallery, reception
room, and ball room.
Mr. Stanford had made a success
of the railroad business and been
elected Governor of California in
the meantime.
After 18 years of marriage, on
May 14. 1868, the son they had so
long desired was born. Mr. Stanford
was so elated that he prepared a
surprise one night at a large formal
dinner.
A large silver platter with a cover
over it appeared on the table. When
the cover was removed, and the
platter passed around from guest to
guest, on it lay little Leland on a
bouquet of blossoms. This was a
surprise even to Mrs. Stanford.
Young Leland died at 15 in Flor
ence. Mrs. Stanford fastened her
whole attention on the University
which was to be a memorial to her
son.
Her two special projects were the
museum and the church. She said
of the church, "While my whole
heart is in this University, my soul
is in that church.''

ance.
When the scene became amusing,
she reached into her pocket for a
handkerchief to smother her laugh
ter. Instead, to the horror of her sis
ter Jane, she pulled out a seemingly
endless long white stocking. Poor
Jane was so mortified that she re
fused to speak to the young man
again.
But young Leland Stanford
matched Jane's shyness and insist
ence on propriety. At that time he
was splitting cordwood for his fa
ther to earn money for school.
He made it a point never to drive
past Miss Lathrop's home for fear
she would see him in a red flannel
shirt and woolen muffler with his
face blue from cold.
They were engaged before he left

for the West, and married in 1850.
In Sacramento were they moved
after lour years, they lived in a small
hotel room. Only a stove and two
beds were bought. The rest of the
furniture was hand made from
packing boxes and boards.
This first home contrasted with
their later San Francisco residence.
Here signs of the zodiac were in
black mosaic on white stone in the
entrance hall. Ceilings had been
painted by famous Italian artists.
Included in the house were a library,
conservatory, art gallery, reception
room, and ball room.
Mr. Stanford had made a success
of the railroad business and been
elected Governor of California in
the meantime.
After 18 years of marriage, on
May 14. 1868, the son they had so
long desired was born. Mr. Stanford
was so elated that he prepared a
surprise one night at a large formal
dinner.
A large silver platter with a cover
over it appeared on the table. When
the cover was removed, and the
platter passed around from guest to
guest, on it lay little Leland on a
bouquet of blossoms. This was a
surprise even to Mrs. Stanford.
Young Leland died at 15 in Flor
ence. Mrs. Stanford fastened her
whole attention on the University
which was to be a memorial to her
son.
Her two special projects were the
museum and the church. She said
of the church, "While my whole
heart is in this University, my soul
is in that church.''
