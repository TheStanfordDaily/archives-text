# Stu-FAc Com To Start New Lunch Plan
## Professors Will Dine Weekly with Students 
### STAN GROSS 
Taking up a suggestion made
by interested professors last
year, the Student-Faculty Com
mittee is now beginning a stu
dent-faculty lunch plan.
The committee was organized last
year to increase friendly relations
between students and faculty mem
bers here.
Tom Tilton, senior and engineer
ing major, is chairman of the com
mittee. According to Tilton, the
committee's function is to "set the
stage for student-faculty relations,"
arranging places for them to meet
on a personal level.
Under the lunch plan a professor
will go to lunch once a week regu
larly for a quarter at a University
living group. It is hoped that the
professor will get to know everyone
in the living group by his first name.
POLL TAKEN
Last spring a poll was taken among
professors to find out which of them
would be interested in participating
in the lunch plan this quarter. A
tabulation was kept of the 135 re
plies to the inquiry. Any Univer
sity residence may apply for a pro
fessor to come to lunch.
Last week a suggestion form was
sent out to all University residences.
This week the Student - Faculty
Committee sent out financial direc
tives.
Those residences participating in
the lunch plan will receive limited
financial aid, the directive said.
COFFEE HOURS
Future plans of the Student-Fac
ulty Committee include department
wide coffee hours. All student and
department faculty will meet twice
quarterly in coffee hour get-togeth
ers.
Talks on subjects of recent in
terest are scheduled. The English
Department experimented with this
idea last year and found it highly
successful.
"The lunch plan is new," Tilton
.said. "Relations between students
and faculty at Stanford must be im
proved. The lunch plan can improve
them—if it works. Whether it works
will depend entirely on the co-oper
ation of everyone involved."
