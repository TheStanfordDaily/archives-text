# Stanford Club Has Most Of Its Activities in the Air
## 
### JACK HANDLEY 
"Keep your head in the
clouds" might well be the motto
of the Indian Flyers, a campus
airborne group.
For a change of scenery the club's
22 members prefer the aerial view.
They fly from San Jose's Municipal
Airport whenever they have the in
clination and the cash.
Most of the club's activities take
place 6,000 feet above the ground, al
though the boys come down to earth
once in a while to go on field trips
and to attend meetings and lectures.
In the offing for this quarter are a
trip to a United Airlines mainte
nance base, and a talk by Captain
Embree Rockwell, United Airlines
DC-7 pilot who has held many
transcontinental speed records. A
"low flight" of a social nature is also
on the agenda.
The secret dream of the Indian
Flyers is to have their own airplane.
The present policy is to rent planes.
With hundreds of flying hours
under their wing tips the Flyers
boast a perfect safety record.
Membership clues are $2.50 quar
terly. Each flyer pays a $5 guaran
tee to the airport when he starts
flying. Reduced hourly flying rates
on Aeronca Chaps and Piper Tri
pacers are an incentive for mem
bership.
The hourly rental rate for an Ae
ronca Champ is $4.50 and for a Tri
pacer, $11. Instruction is $4 an hour.
The group expects to receive re
duced rates on a Beechcraft Bo
nanza, recently purchased by the
San Jose Airport.

Flying instruction is readily avail
able for the novice, who can pick up
his private license in a quarter. Re
quirements for a license include 15
hours of dual flight, 25 hours of solo
flight, which comes to a cost of $240.
Some of the club's more experi
enced "fly boys" have enjoyed such
advantages as flying down to South
ern California for football games,
and flying home for vacations.
Piloting the Indian Flyers this
year is Dick Delafield, who Ls aided
by Jim Funsten, vice - president;
Stan Davis, treasurer; Pat Schulze,
secretary; and Dave Kirbach, social
chairman.

clouds" might well be the motto
of the Indian Flyers, a campus
airborne group.
For a change of scenery the club's
22 members prefer the aerial view.
They fly from San Jose's Municipal
Airport whenever they have the in
clination and the cash.
Most of the club's activities take
place 6,000 feet above the ground, al
though the boys come down to earth
once in a while to go on field trips
and to attend meetings and lectures.
In the offing for this quarter are a
trip to a United Airlines mainte
nance base, and a talk by Captain
Embree Rockwell, United Airlines
DC-7 pilot who has held many
transcontinental speed records. A
"low flight" of a social nature is also
on the agenda.
The secret dream of the Indian
Flyers is to have their own airplane.
The present policy is to rent planes.
With hundreds of flying hours
under their wing tips the Flyers
boast a perfect safety record.
Membership clues are $2.50 quar
terly. Each flyer pays a $5 guaran
tee to the airport when he starts
flying. Reduced hourly flying rates
on Aeronca Chaps and Piper Tri
pacers are an incentive for mem
bership.
The hourly rental rate for an Ae
ronca Champ is $4.50 and for a Tri
pacer, $11. Instruction is $4 an hour.
The group expects to receive re
duced rates on a Beechcraft Bo
nanza, recently purchased by the
San Jose Airport.

Flying instruction is readily avail
able for the novice, who can pick up
his private license in a quarter. Re
quirements for a license include 15
hours of dual flight, 25 hours of solo
flight, which comes to a cost of $240.
Some of the club's more experi
enced "fly boys" have enjoyed such
advantages as flying down to South
ern California for football games,
and flying home for vacations.
Piloting the Indian Flyers this
year is Dick Delafield, who Ls aided
by Jim Funsten, vice - president;
Stan Davis, treasurer; Pat Schulze,
secretary; and Dave Kirbach, social
chairman.
