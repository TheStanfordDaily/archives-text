From far-flung corners of Quad,
here's what professors are saying:
James I. McNelis, instructor of
English, on fire drills: "There's
nothing worse than other people
who worry about your safety."
Wilfred Stone, assistant professor
of English, on character building:
"How often have you heard someone
extol the virtues of working your
way through college? I worked my
way through college ... it stinks."
Thomas A. Bailey, professor of
history, on the reaction of a colonist
to a decoration on an Indian: "It
annoyed the young man—it was his
fiancee's scalp."
David C. Rcgnery, associate pro
fessor of biology, on plant hormones
called auxins: "An auxin—like Duz
—does everything."
