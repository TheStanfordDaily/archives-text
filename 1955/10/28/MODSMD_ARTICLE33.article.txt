An Ocean Research Laboratory,
newly established at Stanford by the
U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, will
try a different method of solving the
mystery of fluctuating fish popula
tions in the Pacific Ocean.
Initially the laboratory will have
a staff of six. The first task will be
to amass quantities of data about
fisheries, weather, and underwater
conditions.
