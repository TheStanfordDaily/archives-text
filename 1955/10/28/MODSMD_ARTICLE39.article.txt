# Original Standford Stadium Construction Cost $200,000, Completed in 160 Days
## 
### DAVE SCOTT 
Stanford Stadium was perhaps
the cheapest and quickest bar
gain the University has ever
had. Its initial cost was only
5200,000 and the entire construc
tion job took only 160 days.
When the construction of the first
Stanford Stadium was completed in
1905, it had a seating capacity of
15.000.
However, the stadium got smaller
and smaller every year. Even the
addition of 5,000 seats a few years
later was not enough to keep up
with the increasing number of peo
ple that flocked to the Big Game
each year.
Besides, the earthquake raised se
rious doubts as to the sturdiness of
stadium construction. Consequently,
tentative plans were made for a
stadium of 30.000.
Nothing was done until Nov. 20,
1920, when the Board of Trustees
announced a possible site for a sta
dium to be completed in approxi
mately two years.
Surprise and skeptism were great
on May 25 of the following year
when it was announced that plans
for a 60,000-seat stadium were drawn
and that the complete construction
of the stadium would be finished by
Nov. 19, Big Game day.
.The original 30,000 capacity sta
dium had been expanded and a run
ning track with a 220-yard straight
away had been added to the plans.
The earthquake factor had been
considered and it was discovered
that the earth embankment type of
foundation was the most steady. Be
cause of the late season warm
weather in the peninsula, one end
of the stadium was to be left open
for air circulation.
The contract was given to a San
Francisco firm, headed by two Stan
ford graduates, for the amazingly
low bid of $210,000.
On June 1 ground was broken on
the stadium sight by President Ray
Lyman Wilbur and work was done
moving some 255,000 cubic yards of
dirt for the stadium which was to
cover 20 acres.

In the meantime the rather neces
sary job was financing was being
carried on. The Stanford student
body kicked, things off by aryiounc
ing a goal of $10,000, asking $10 to
be given by each student. A few
coughed up as much as $500 apiece
to help raise the student total to
$15,000.
The rest of the money was raised
quickly from the alumni and from
the endowment fund.
By the time students had returned
in September digging had been al
most completed and seats were be
ing installed —seats that were to use
up 800,000 feet of lumber.
By Nov. 1 the lawn had been
planted and the landscaping com
pleted. The care of the stadium lawn
was turned over to Sam McDonald,
who declared, ''The stadium does
not look like the work of a few
months; it seems that it has been
here for years, and that it belongs
here."
Worried Stanford roughs placed
guards around the stadium for fear
of a Cal retaliatory raid upon the
new structure in revenge for paint
ing the California "C" red. But
nothing happened and the stadium
was in perfect condition for the Big
Game.
The Stanford team christened the
new stadium by scoring a touch
down upon the Blue and Gold be
fore the game had gone two minutes.
However, from then on the Cal team
rolled and the 65,000 jammed into
the stadium saw the Bears win, 42-7.
In the next 10 years many im
provements were added to the now
nationally famous stadium. By 1932
27,500 seats had been added, making

the stadium close to the present
90,000 capacity.
Some-the the seats were put in the
open end and 14 more rows were
added on the top rim of the stadium
superstructure all round the bowl.
In 1932 new seats were installed in
place of the orginal 60,000.
With the addition of 10,000 seats
in 1925 another famous sports field
was created. The dirt dug to fill in
the open end of the stadium for the
seats created a gaping hole. Univer
sity officials decided to put the hole
to use, and the result was the Sunk
en Diamond.
The two team houses were con
structed and permanent rest rooms
were installed. Landscaping was im
proved. By 1932 the total cost of the
stadium to the University had risen
from $200,000 to $723,000.
The stadium received its biggest
national prominance on Aug. 11 of
1928 when Herbert C. Hoover de
livered his Republican nomination
acceptance speech before 70,000 in
Stanford Stadium and a nation-wide
radio hook-up.
At present the University is in
the process of replacing all of the
seats in the stadium at a cost of
$600,000. Don Liebendorfer, athletic
news service director, says:
"Because of the staggering cost,
almost three times the original cost
of constructing the stadium, the
work has to be done bit by bit and
won't be completed for some time."

structed and permanent rest rooms
were installed. Landscaping was im
proved. By 1932 the total cost of the
stadium to the University had risen
from $200,000 to $723,000.
The stadium received its biggest
national prominance on Aug. 11 of
1928 when Herbert C. Hoover de
livered his Republican nomination
acceptance speech before 70,000 in
Stanford Stadium and a nation-wide
radio hook-up.
At present the University is in
the process of replacing all of the
seats in the stadium at a cost of
$600,000. Don Liebendorfer, athletic
news service director, says:
"Because of the staggering cost,
almost three times the original cost
of constructing the stadium, the
work has to be done bit by bit and
won't be completed for some time."


STANFORD'S 34-YEAR-OLD STADIUM SEATS 90,000
Stanford Stadium was perhaps
the cheapest and quickest bar
gain the University has ever
had. Its initial cost was only
5200,000 and the entire construc
tion job took only 160 days.
When the construction of the first
Stanford Stadium was completed in
1905, it had a seating capacity of
15.000.
However, the stadium got smaller
and smaller every year. Even the
addition of 5,000 seats a few years
later was not enough to keep up
with the increasing number of peo
ple that flocked to the Big Game
each year.
Besides, the earthquake raised se
rious doubts as to the sturdiness of
stadium construction. Consequently,
tentative plans were made for a
stadium of 30.000.
Nothing was done until Nov. 20,
1920, when the Board of Trustees
announced a possible site for a sta
dium to be completed in approxi
mately two years.
Surprise and skeptism were great
on May 25 of the following year
when it was announced that plans
for a 60,000-seat stadium were drawn
and that the complete construction
of the stadium would be finished by
Nov. 19, Big Game day.
.The original 30,000 capacity sta
dium had been expanded and a run
ning track with a 220-yard straight
away had been added to the plans.
The earthquake factor had been
considered and it was discovered
that the earth embankment type of
foundation was the most steady. Be
cause of the late season warm
weather in the peninsula, one end
of the stadium was to be left open
for air circulation.
The contract was given to a San
Francisco firm, headed by two Stan
ford graduates, for the amazingly
low bid of $210,000.
On June 1 ground was broken on
the stadium sight by President Ray
Lyman Wilbur and work was done
moving some 255,000 cubic yards of
dirt for the stadium which was to
cover 20 acres.

In the meantime the rather neces
sary job was financing was being
carried on. The Stanford student
body kicked, things off by aryiounc
ing a goal of $10,000, asking $10 to
be given by each student. A few
coughed up as much as $500 apiece
to help raise the student total to
$15,000.
The rest of the money was raised
quickly from the alumni and from
the endowment fund.
By the time students had returned
in September digging had been al
most completed and seats were be
ing installed —seats that were to use
up 800,000 feet of lumber.
By Nov. 1 the lawn had been
planted and the landscaping com
pleted. The care of the stadium lawn
was turned over to Sam McDonald,
who declared, ''The stadium does
not look like the work of a few
months; it seems that it has been
here for years, and that it belongs
here."
Worried Stanford roughs placed
guards around the stadium for fear
of a Cal retaliatory raid upon the
new structure in revenge for paint
ing the California "C" red. But
nothing happened and the stadium
was in perfect condition for the Big
Game.
The Stanford team christened the
new stadium by scoring a touch
down upon the Blue and Gold be
fore the game had gone two minutes.
However, from then on the Cal team
rolled and the 65,000 jammed into
the stadium saw the Bears win, 42-7.
In the next 10 years many im
provements were added to the now
nationally famous stadium. By 1932
27,500 seats had been added, making

the stadium close to the present
90,000 capacity.
Some-the the seats were put in the
open end and 14 more rows were
added on the top rim of the stadium
superstructure all round the bowl.
In 1932 new seats were installed in
place of the orginal 60,000.
With the addition of 10,000 seats
in 1925 another famous sports field
was created. The dirt dug to fill in
the open end of the stadium for the
seats created a gaping hole. Univer
sity officials decided to put the hole
to use, and the result was the Sunk
en Diamond.

In the next 10 years many im
provements were added to the now
nationally famous stadium. By 1932
27,500 seats had been added, making

the stadium close to the present
90,000 capacity.
Some-the the seats were put in the
open end and 14 more rows were
added on the top rim of the stadium
superstructure all round the bowl.
In 1932 new seats were installed in
place of the orginal 60,000.
With the addition of 10,000 seats
in 1925 another famous sports field
was created. The dirt dug to fill in
the open end of the stadium for the
seats created a gaping hole. Univer
sity officials decided to put the hole
to use, and the result was the Sunk
en Diamond.
The two team houses were con
structed and permanent rest rooms
were installed. Landscaping was im
proved. By 1932 the total cost of the
stadium to the University had risen
from $200,000 to $723,000.
The stadium received its biggest
national prominance on Aug. 11 of
1928 when Herbert C. Hoover de
livered his Republican nomination
acceptance speech before 70,000 in
Stanford Stadium and a nation-wide
radio hook-up.
At present the University is in
the process of replacing all of the
seats in the stadium at a cost of
$600,000. Don Liebendorfer, athletic
news service director, says:
"Because of the staggering cost,
almost three times the original cost
of constructing the stadium, the
work has to be done bit by bit and
won't be completed for some time."


STANFORD'S 34-YEAR-OLD STADIUM SEATS 90,000
Stanford Stadium was perhaps
the cheapest and quickest bar
gain the University has ever
had. Its initial cost was only
5200,000 and the entire construc
tion job took only 160 days.
When the construction of the first
Stanford Stadium was completed in
1905, it had a seating capacity of
15.000.
However, the stadium got smaller
and smaller every year. Even the
addition of 5,000 seats a few years
later was not enough to keep up
with the increasing number of peo
ple that flocked to the Big Game
each year.
Besides, the earthquake raised se
rious doubts as to the sturdiness of
stadium construction. Consequently,
tentative plans were made for a
stadium of 30.000.
Nothing was done until Nov. 20,
1920, when the Board of Trustees
announced a possible site for a sta
dium to be completed in approxi
mately two years.
Surprise and skeptism were great
on May 25 of the following year
when it was announced that plans
for a 60,000-seat stadium were drawn
and that the complete construction
of the stadium would be finished by
Nov. 19, Big Game day.
.The original 30,000 capacity sta
dium had been expanded and a run
ning track with a 220-yard straight
away had been added to the plans.
The earthquake factor had been
considered and it was discovered
that the earth embankment type of
foundation was the most steady. Be
cause of the late season warm
weather in the peninsula, one end
of the stadium was to be left open
for air circulation.
The contract was given to a San
Francisco firm, headed by two Stan
ford graduates, for the amazingly
low bid of $210,000.
On June 1 ground was broken on
the stadium sight by President Ray
Lyman Wilbur and work was done
moving some 255,000 cubic yards of
dirt for the stadium which was to
cover 20 acres.

In the meantime the rather neces
sary job was financing was being
carried on. The Stanford student
body kicked, things off by aryiounc
ing a goal of $10,000, asking $10 to
be given by each student. A few
coughed up as much as $500 apiece
to help raise the student total to
$15,000.
The rest of the money was raised
quickly from the alumni and from
the endowment fund.
By the time students had returned
in September digging had been al
most completed and seats were be
ing installed —seats that were to use
up 800,000 feet of lumber.
By Nov. 1 the lawn had been
planted and the landscaping com
pleted. The care of the stadium lawn
was turned over to Sam McDonald,
who declared, ''The stadium does
not look like the work of a few
months; it seems that it has been
here for years, and that it belongs
here."
Worried Stanford roughs placed
guards around the stadium for fear
of a Cal retaliatory raid upon the
new structure in revenge for paint
ing the California "C" red. But
nothing happened and the stadium
was in perfect condition for the Big
Game.
The Stanford team christened the
new stadium by scoring a touch
down upon the Blue and Gold be
fore the game had gone two minutes.
However, from then on the Cal team
rolled and the 65,000 jammed into
the stadium saw the Bears win, 42-7.
