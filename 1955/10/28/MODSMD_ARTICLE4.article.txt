# Beer Garden Riot Still Under Investigation
## 
### 
Rossotti's Beer Garden is still
under investigation as a result of
last Friday's near-riot at the Al
pine Road hangout, in which a
patrolman pulled a gun.
John F. Merrill, State Depart
ment of Alcoholic Beverage Con
trol assistant area administrator,
told The Daily yesterday that his
agents' complete report on the in
cident will be finished soon.
Until this is done, probably
Monday, the agency will take no
action against Rossotti's.
Merrill said early this week.
"Owner Clark [Edward J. Clark
Jr. who operates Rossotti's] had
better come up with a good expla
nation of his running such a dis
orderly place, or he may face
charges."
Enforcement agencies are still
searching for the under-age beer
drinker who escaped from their
custody Friday, and for the Ros
sotti's patron who broke a bottle
of beer being held for evidence.
