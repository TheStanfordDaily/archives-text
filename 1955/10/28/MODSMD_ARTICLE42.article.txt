# INTERPLAYERS EXCEL
## 'Madwoman' and Friends Make Drama a Success 
### STEW TOY 
San Francisco's on-again, off
again Interplayers have a smash
success on their hands in their
new production of lean Girau
doux's "Madwoman of Chaillot."
A play's fate in an amateur pro
duction is usually determined by
one personality, whose vibrancy or
sluggishness makes or breaks it; for
all too often supporting talent is of
questionable quality.
Joyce Lancaster is the polished
actress in this instance. Her throaty
performance as the "Madwoman" is
delightfully fantastic.
But, with a few exceptions, the
supporting cast is of equal stature—a
fact which makes the play, while
staged by amateurs, anything but
amateurish.
"Madwoman" opened Friday night
at Kearny Street's tiny Bella Union
Theater, oldest in San Francisco.
PLOT
Its plot deals with a group of Paris
corporation-promoters, the epitome
of oppressing capitalists, who meet
in the fabulous Chaillot sidewalk
cafe to arrange the corporate coup
of all time.
The financiers, played rather un
sure ly by John Church, Frank Fon
tana, and Bill Murphy, plan to drill
for oil in one of the world's few un
exploited areas: downtown Paris.
Joined by a Texas oil - smeller,
whose infallible nose has drawn him
to the cafe as the center of a rich
deposit, they make their clandestine
drilling plans among one of the mot
leyest crews ever assembled on a
stage together: the sti'ange denizens
of Chaillot.
Strangest of all is Countess Aure
lia, the Madwoman, owner of Cha
illot. Her Steinbergian carriage and
dress are wondrous to behold.
Incensed by reports from her loyal

Chaillot adherents of the chicanery
afoot, the Madwoman sets out to
right the world's ills.
OPPRESSION SYMBOLS
The financiers now become sym
bols of oppression, and are seen
again, happily, only in the play's
final scene, when Pied Piper Aure
lia herds them and other iniquitous
persons, after a strange ballet,
through a trap door into the Paris
sewers.
The play's piece de resistance is a
wonderful scene in which the Mad- I
woman and her even madder com
panions, Constance and Gabrielle,
hold an insane discussion which ri
vals the tea party in "Alice in Won
derland" for its weird, classic com
edy.
Both Miss Lancaster and Ruth
Lincoln, who plays Gabrielle, are
masters of the subtle nuances of
which Giraudoux. is so fond.
Their performances are made still
more subtle by the slight dimensions
of the Bella Union, which make
over - projection unnecessary and
give the play all the intimacy of a
television screen.
SEWERMAN-ATTORNEY
John Rajkovich does a fine job as
a sewerman who plays defense at
torney in a rollicking trial of the
financiers — another scene reminis
cent of Lewis Carroll's story.
Harry W. Smith, whose perform
ance in "The Shrike" was one of the
high spots of the Interplayers' sea
son last year, is disappointingly un-
Texan in his role as the oil-pros
pector.
He periodically forgets his accent,
then recovers it in an overdose to
atone for his past transgressions.
But he and the corporation men
are all but forgotten in the superb
fantasy of the Madwoman and her
friends. Miss Lancaster and Miss
Lincoln steal the show, to the thor
' ough delight of all.

in the fabulous Chaillot sidewalk
cafe to arrange the corporate coup
of all time.
The financiers, played rather un
sure ly by John Church, Frank Fon
tana, and Bill Murphy, plan to drill
for oil in one of the world's few un
exploited areas: downtown Paris.
Joined by a Texas oil - smeller,
whose infallible nose has drawn him
to the cafe as the center of a rich
deposit, they make their clandestine
drilling plans among one of the mot
leyest crews ever assembled on a
stage together: the sti'ange denizens
of Chaillot.
Strangest of all is Countess Aure
lia, the Madwoman, owner of Cha
illot. Her Steinbergian carriage and
dress are wondrous to behold.
Incensed by reports from her loyal

Chaillot adherents of the chicanery
afoot, the Madwoman sets out to
right the world's ills.
OPPRESSION SYMBOLS
The financiers now become sym
bols of oppression, and are seen
again, happily, only in the play's
final scene, when Pied Piper Aure
lia herds them and other iniquitous
persons, after a strange ballet,
through a trap door into the Paris
sewers.
The play's piece de resistance is a
wonderful scene in which the Mad- I
woman and her even madder com
panions, Constance and Gabrielle,
hold an insane discussion which ri
vals the tea party in "Alice in Won
derland" for its weird, classic com
edy.
Both Miss Lancaster and Ruth
Lincoln, who plays Gabrielle, are
masters of the subtle nuances of
which Giraudoux. is so fond.
Their performances are made still
more subtle by the slight dimensions
of the Bella Union, which make
over - projection unnecessary and
give the play all the intimacy of a
television screen.
SEWERMAN-ATTORNEY
John Rajkovich does a fine job as
a sewerman who plays defense at
torney in a rollicking trial of the
financiers — another scene reminis
cent of Lewis Carroll's story.
Harry W. Smith, whose perform
ance in "The Shrike" was one of the
high spots of the Interplayers' sea
son last year, is disappointingly un-
Texan in his role as the oil-pros
pector.
He periodically forgets his accent,
then recovers it in an overdose to
atone for his past transgressions.
But he and the corporation men
are all but forgotten in the superb
fantasy of the Madwoman and her
friends. Miss Lancaster and Miss
Lincoln steal the show, to the thor
' ough delight of all.
San Francisco's on-again, off
again Interplayers have a smash
success on their hands in their
new production of lean Girau
doux's "Madwoman of Chaillot."
A play's fate in an amateur pro
duction is usually determined by
one personality, whose vibrancy or
sluggishness makes or breaks it; for
all too often supporting talent is of
questionable quality.
Joyce Lancaster is the polished
actress in this instance. Her throaty
performance as the "Madwoman" is
delightfully fantastic.
But, with a few exceptions, the
supporting cast is of equal stature—a
fact which makes the play, while
staged by amateurs, anything but
amateurish.
"Madwoman" opened Friday night
at Kearny Street's tiny Bella Union
Theater, oldest in San Francisco.
PLOT
Its plot deals with a group of Paris
corporation-promoters, the epitome
of oppressing capitalists, who meet
in the fabulous Chaillot sidewalk
cafe to arrange the corporate coup
of all time.
