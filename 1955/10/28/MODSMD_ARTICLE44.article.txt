# Frosh Gridders Open Season Against UCLA
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
Coach Bob Ghilotti's frosh gridders open their three-game sea
son here tomorrow against the powerful UCLA Bruincubs. The
game, starting at 11 a.m., will be the preliminary to the Stanford -
San Jose Slate varsity contest and is expected to be one of the
toughest hurdles of the shortened season for the Papooses.

After the UCI.A game, the frosh
take on the potent USC frosh in Los
Angeles, anil the California Cubs at
Berkeley in the traditional Little
big game. The three contests are
scheduled for successive week ends.
Ghilotti's first eleven will give any
team on the schedule a rough after
noon of it but once these boys tire,
the Papoose second and third teams
will he inexperienced. To combat
this depth problem, Ghilotti has em
phasized conditioning more than
ever this year in an effort to get his
regulars ready to stand up for the
full four quarters of a game.
Alter experimenting with several
quarterbacks, the frosh mentor has
decided to start Jerry Reinhart, a
175-pounder from Hanlord High
School. The boy is over six feet tall
and can run and pass equally well.
This, of course, makes him well
suited for the split T type of offense
which the lrosh will employ this
vear.
HALFBACKS
The halfback positions find Salem
High's Neil Scheidel opening at left
half and either Bob Peterson or Dick
Mires at the opposite position. Pe
terson, hardest runner on the team,
probably will get the nod this Sat
urday after his crunching running
during the week.
The fullback slot will be handled
by chunky Dick Childs from Ala
meda High School. The 180 pound
back is a hard runner and also very
ehrsive. Last year Childs played for
tHe north in the all-star game in Los
Angeles' Memorial Coliseum after
breaking several rushing records for

Alameda High School during the
regular season.
In comparing this year's backs to
the (lashy 1954 hackfield which
wound up by scoring 60 points
against California, Ghilotti admits
that his present quartet isn't quite
as experienced as his former stars
but the coach feels that they will
come along fast anil may be equal
to any of his back fields by the cn:l
of the season.
BIG LINE
The Papoose line will be big and
rangy, averaging over 200 pounds
per man and standing six feet tall.
At the ends will be Denny Farrar on
the left side and either Phil Burk
land or Ty Polich at the right flank.
Troy Barbee and Don Crosby will
man the tackle positions and Glenn
Haden and Ralph Koldinger will
start at guards. The center is 195
pound John Thomas from Whittier
High School.
Barbee, weighing 220 pounds, will
anchor the right side of the Papoose
line. The big tackle starred for Hoo
ver High School in San Diego and
played opposite Childs in the North-
South all-star game. Another line
standout is Barbee's running mate,
Crosby, who played his prep ball for
Cathedral High, in Los Angeles, and
who also contested in the post-sea
son classic at the Coliseum. Crosby
stands 5-11 and weighs 205 pounds.
FROSH INJURIES
Ghilotti has his problems in the
injury department as both starting
right end candidates, Burkland and
Polich, are laid up with ankle inju
ries. The boys will probably both be
ready for action come opening kick
off time tomorrow, but if not, 6-4
Ben Robinson will step in. Also
slated to see plenty of action is new
comer Tad Prissor, who has only
been out for practice the last four
days but who has been going like a
ball of fire.
Biggest player on the squad, and
biggest Stanford athlete this year, is
300 pound, 6-3 Leon Horst. The
mammoth lineman is slated for duty
as a left tackle and has proven ca
pable as a hard blocker on pass plays
and punts.,

stands 5-11 and weighs 205 pounds.
FROSH INJURIES
Ghilotti has his problems in the
injury department as both starting
right end candidates, Burkland and
Polich, are laid up with ankle inju
ries. The boys will probably both be
ready for action come opening kick
off time tomorrow, but if not, 6-4
Ben Robinson will step in. Also
slated to see plenty of action is new
comer Tad Prissor, who has only
been out for practice the last four
days but who has been going like a
ball of fire.
Biggest player on the squad, and
biggest Stanford athlete this year, is
300 pound, 6-3 Leon Horst. The
mammoth lineman is slated for duty
as a left tackle and has proven ca
pable as a hard blocker on pass plays
and punts.,
Coach Bob Ghilotti's frosh gridders open their three-game sea
son here tomorrow against the powerful UCLA Bruincubs. The
game, starting at 11 a.m., will be the preliminary to the Stanford -
San Jose Slate varsity contest and is expected to be one of the
toughest hurdles of the shortened season for the Papooses.

After the UCI.A game, the frosh
take on the potent USC frosh in Los
Angeles, anil the California Cubs at
Berkeley in the traditional Little
big game. The three contests are
scheduled for successive week ends.
Ghilotti's first eleven will give any
team on the schedule a rough after
noon of it but once these boys tire,
the Papoose second and third teams
will he inexperienced. To combat
this depth problem, Ghilotti has em
phasized conditioning more than
ever this year in an effort to get his
regulars ready to stand up for the
full four quarters of a game.
Alter experimenting with several
quarterbacks, the frosh mentor has
decided to start Jerry Reinhart, a
175-pounder from Hanlord High
School. The boy is over six feet tall
and can run and pass equally well.
This, of course, makes him well
suited for the split T type of offense
which the lrosh will employ this
vear.
HALFBACKS
The halfback positions find Salem
High's Neil Scheidel opening at left
half and either Bob Peterson or Dick
Mires at the opposite position. Pe
terson, hardest runner on the team,
probably will get the nod this Sat
urday after his crunching running
during the week.
The fullback slot will be handled
by chunky Dick Childs from Ala
meda High School. The 180 pound
back is a hard runner and also very
ehrsive. Last year Childs played for
tHe north in the all-star game in Los
Angeles' Memorial Coliseum after
breaking several rushing records for

Alameda High School during the
regular season.
In comparing this year's backs to
the (lashy 1954 hackfield which
wound up by scoring 60 points
against California, Ghilotti admits
that his present quartet isn't quite
as experienced as his former stars
but the coach feels that they will
come along fast anil may be equal
to any of his back fields by the cn:l
of the season.
BIG LINE
The Papoose line will be big and
rangy, averaging over 200 pounds
per man and standing six feet tall.
At the ends will be Denny Farrar on
the left side and either Phil Burk
land or Ty Polich at the right flank.
Troy Barbee and Don Crosby will
man the tackle positions and Glenn
Haden and Ralph Koldinger will
start at guards. The center is 195
pound John Thomas from Whittier
High School.
Barbee, weighing 220 pounds, will
anchor the right side of the Papoose
line. The big tackle starred for Hoo
ver High School in San Diego and
played opposite Childs in the North-
South all-star game. Another line
standout is Barbee's running mate,
Crosby, who played his prep ball for
Cathedral High, in Los Angeles, and
who also contested in the post-sea
son classic at the Coliseum. Crosby
stands 5-11 and weighs 205 pounds.
