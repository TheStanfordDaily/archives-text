# KIA Team Gains Loop Lead with 19 to 0 Win
## 
### JOHN MOE 
One mighty sharp KA I offensive machine rolled over the SAE
ll's yesterday, 19 to 0, giving them an undisputed hold on first spot
in league three.
Something had to give when these two teams clashed. Both had
3 and 0 records and both had a jealous eye trained on the number

one berth. The KA's were not to beH
denied, however, and behind terrific
offensive and defensive play grabbed
the win.
The SAE squad threatened to
score only once in the entire con
test. Quarterback Bob Fisher heaved
a long, wobbly pass down the center
and Terry Badger, playing right end,
made a nice diving catch to give the
SAE's first and goal on the six.
But it ended right there after four
passes went incomplete.
KA'S SCORE
To get things underway Jon Meyer
hit his left end, John Packard, in
the end zone just two plays into the
first half. The play covered 40 yards
from scrimmage. A conversion made
it 7 to 0 where it stood at the half.
Fisher tossed one to Badger at
midfieid to open the second half. On
fourth down after no further gain
Fisher was nailed for a big loss by
Bill Bardon to give the KA's the ball
once again.
Meyer completed to Myron Hol
lister on the twenty for a first and
goal situation. Another pass, this
time to right half Seldon Beebe put
the ball on the four.
Hollister then went down and out
into the pay dirt zone end took a
Meyer pass, for,.six more., The try for
extra point was no good making the
score 13 to 0.
SAE GETS BALL
The SAE team got the ball after
the score but lost yardage on their
four downs to give the KA's the pig
skin on the 19.. With Bill Mclntyre
at the wheel the KA's set'out for the
goai once more.
On second down Mclntyre threw
to Beebe who hobbled the ball mo
mentarily on the five, but gained
control of it and stepped over for
the tally. Again the conversion at
tempt failed.
