# Card JV To Meet Fort Ord
## 
### 
The Stanford Braves, fresh
from a 48-13 victory over San
Jose State junior varsity, travel
lo Fort Ord tomorrow for their
-recond encounter with a service
team.
The game will start at 2 p.m.
The Fort Old team is made up of
former college all-stars and profes
sional players who are now in the
service.
The servicemen are unbeaten to
date, having even won a practice
game with the San Francisco 49ers.
Included in the lineup are such
names as Paul Larson, the passing
wizard from Cal, Paul Cameron from
UCLA and the Baltimore Colts, and
Rudy Bukich from Southern Cali
fornia and the Pittsburgh Steelers.
In their last encounter with a
service team, the Hamilton Air
Force Base, the Braves put up a
good fight but were finally beaten
by the greater experience qf those
former college and professional stars.
The Braves will be weakened by
the loss of two experienced ends,
Dick Stein and Bob Gergen. Stein
suffered a broken wrist last week,
and Gergen will be playing with the
varsity tomorrow.
Wes Idol at left tackle is also in
jured.
According to Mai Elward, coach,
the end situation will be the most
serious, as it leaves the Braves with
only one experienced player at that
position, Frank Hook.
The Braves face the San Diego
Naval Training Station in their next
game on Nov. 4 and then take on
Treasure Island here on Nov. 12.
