## 
### BILL MEANS 
Leonard Maizlich captured top
honors in the fourth annual Mar
ion Rice Kirkwood moot court
competition last night before a
packed "courtroom" in the Stan
ford Law School.
Placing second in the event was
Lee S. Pantell. Other finalists, cho
sen during rugged competition last
spring, were Marshall Foreman and
William Rinehart. All are third-year
law students.
SPLIT-DECISION
The verdict, a "split - decision,"
came from three distinguished Cali
fornia jurists—Jesse W. Carter, as
sociate justice of the Supreme Court
of California; Raymond E. Peters,
a District Court of Appeal justice;
and Murray Draper, San Mateo
County Superior Court judge.
The case involved a supposed vio
lation of the Clayton Anti-Trust Act
by the Superoil Corp. which had
purchased another company, Twin-
Cities.
Also raised was the question
whether the court can order Super
oil to sell Twin-Cities, or whether
it can only require Superoil to pay
Leopard a sum of money to com
pensate for the alleged loss.
WELL PRESENTED
Justice Carter rendered the ma
jority verdict, stating that briefs of
both sides had been extremely well
presented and that the result was
"very difficult" to decide.
A prize of $100 was awarded Maiz
lich, while Miss Pantell collected $50
and the other two finalists $25 each.
The awards were made possible by a
gift to the Moot Court Board by the
Stanford Law Society of Northern

SPLIT-DECISION
The verdict, a "split - decision,"
came from three distinguished Cali
fornia jurists—Jesse W. Carter, as
sociate justice of the Supreme Court
of California; Raymond E. Peters,
a District Court of Appeal justice;
and Murray Draper, San Mateo
County Superior Court judge.
The case involved a supposed vio
lation of the Clayton Anti-Trust Act
by the Superoil Corp. which had
purchased another company, Twin-
Cities.
Also raised was the question
whether the court can order Super
oil to sell Twin-Cities, or whether
it can only require Superoil to pay
Leopard a sum of money to com
pensate for the alleged loss.
