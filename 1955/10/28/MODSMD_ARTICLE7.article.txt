## Dulles Peace Plan Aired in Geneva 
### 
GENEVA, Oct. 27 (UP)—The
West today handed Russ 5 a a
nine-page "peace package" for
Europe that promised guaran
tees against any future German !
aggression in exchange for re- j
unification of Germany.
Secretary of State Dulles told So
viet Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov
the United States was willing to
enter into formal assurances that
Russia would be protected against
attack by a reunited Germany.
The West took the position at the
start of the Big Four foreign minis
ters' conference that the goal of
unity and security must be reached
if there is to be any further easing j
of the cold war undoi the "spirit of ;
Geneva."
Secretary of State Dulles proposed
that the guarantees against aggres- I
sion could be the bridge that would
bring the East and West together on
union of the two parts of Germany.
After introductory remarks were i
concluded at the opening session,
Dulles plunged immediately into the j
key issue.
Dulles told Molotov the guarantees
should "permit proceeding promptly
to achieve the reunification |of East
and West Germany | now long over
due."
Molotov agreed with the Western
premise that European security and
German reunification might be
brought about slowly, by stages. But
he warned against any settlement
under which "militarism would in
fact be resurrected throughout Ger
many."
