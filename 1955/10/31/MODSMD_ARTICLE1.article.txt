# Russians Sample the American Way—Stanford Style
## Cokes, Football, Pompons —Russian journalists Find Stanford 'Exciting' 
### JIM PALMER 
Smiling, clapping their hands and gulping down cokes, seven Russian
journalists witnessed their first American football game Saturday in Stan
ford Stadium.
Easily mistaken for alumni or businessmen with the day oft. the carna
tion-bedecked group filed inconspicuously into their seats below the press
box.
Immediately the Iron Curtain visitors were jotting down notations,
drinking in the spectacle and conversing with American newsmen.
"Exciting, very much fun," bubbled the leader of the traveling squad,
Boris N. Kampov-Polevoy, representing Pravda, after Stanford had scored
one of its four first-half touchdowns.
"LIKE ENGLISH FOOTBALL"
"Looks like English football. .They play very well. I like it very much."
A couple of seats away, personable Boris R. Izakov of the monthly
International Life, who looks like a Soviet counterpart of George Gobel,
was distracted by the San Jose pompon girls.
"Are they really students? They are very beautiful," he said in perfect
English, smiling.
Shiny-headed Nikolai M. Gribachev. noted poet and editor of the
Literary Gazette, was taking pictures of the crowd, his comrades and
.American newsmen.
Down the row, playwright Anatoly V. Sofronov was jotting down notes
on the "pageantry and the spectacle itself."
No doubt he was keeping track (as best he could) of the play on the
field too. As Bill Tarr dived over for a score, Sofronov noted number 30
on his pad followed by a comment that will remain a mystery to non-
Russian-speaking football fans.
AT END OF FIRST HALF
As the first half came to a close, the Russians, who are touring America
at their own expense, were treated to cokes by the American press and
sdttled back to watch the half-time stunts.
The Soviets were visibly impressed by the bands—"Are they profes
sional?" —and watched the card section with interest.
Polevoy, who lost an eye as a war hero, commented that the bands
"looked like military" and that there was similar pageantry at Russian
games.
As half-time activities ended, Stanford Information Director Peter C.
Allen escorted the visitors out of the stadium and over to Hoover Tower
where a group of faculty members waited to chat with them.
Passing through the parking lot. Izakov commented that Americans had
"better and more automobiles than we do."
"In some fields you are ahead of us, and in other fields we are ahead
of you," he explained diplomatically.
SWIM AT RICKEY'S
Earlier in the day, after lunch at Stickney's Hick'ry House, the Russians
had a dip in the pool at Rickey's. (Comrade Sofronov was too big to fit
into a swimming suit, so he remained a spectator.)
Passing the Encina pools, Izakov was asked if he liked to swim.
"Oh, yes, but I don't think I have time now," he said politely.
At Hoover Tower, the Soviets, through English-speaking Valentin M.
Berenzhkov, discussed the subject of criticism: "It has been directed to
improve the situation of our people in order to help our state go forward."
Letters to the editor are important Polevoy stressed, citing an example
where criticism led to establishment of a new tax system in agriculture.
As the conference proceeded, the Russians dispensed with the trans
lator and conversed with their bi-lingual hosts in the native tongue.
Everything continued amiably, with laughter bi'eaking out intermit
tently.
The Soviets whipped out a toy mouse and explained that it was awarded
to the person who told the best joke each day.
LITERARY FIELD
Then conversation turned to the literary field, and Russians discussed
American works and their own products. Throughout the conversation,
the conference seemed more like a living-room chat than a meeting of
Americans and Russians.
Polevoy summed up the purpose of the group's trip:
"We come on a friendly mission to see everything which is worth seeing
in America. We will try to do everything to promote a better understand
ing between the American people and the Soviets."
The Russians then climbed into Cadillac limousines and sped off to
dinner, leaving behind them the atmosphere of the big smile and taking
with them an experience which will be transported back to iron curtain
newspapers and magazines, and finally made part of a joint project of all
the tourists—a book on American life.

The Russians then climbed into Cadillac limousines and sped off to
dinner, leaving behind them the atmosphere of the big smile and taking
with them an experience which will be transported back to iron curtain
newspapers and magazines, and finally made part of a joint project of all
the tourists—a book on American life.

THE PAUSE THAT REFRESHES
A. V. Sofronov, playwright and editor, takes a break
Smiling, clapping their hands and gulping down cokes, seven Russian
journalists witnessed their first American football game Saturday in Stan
ford Stadium.
Easily mistaken for alumni or businessmen with the day oft. the carna
tion-bedecked group filed inconspicuously into their seats below the press
box.
Immediately the Iron Curtain visitors were jotting down notations,
drinking in the spectacle and conversing with American newsmen.
"Exciting, very much fun," bubbled the leader of the traveling squad,
Boris N. Kampov-Polevoy, representing Pravda, after Stanford had scored
one of its four first-half touchdowns.
"LIKE ENGLISH FOOTBALL"
"Looks like English football. .They play very well. I like it very much."
A couple of seats away, personable Boris R. Izakov of the monthly
International Life, who looks like a Soviet counterpart of George Gobel,
was distracted by the San Jose pompon girls.
"Are they really students? They are very beautiful," he said in perfect
English, smiling.
Shiny-headed Nikolai M. Gribachev. noted poet and editor of the
Literary Gazette, was taking pictures of the crowd, his comrades and
.American newsmen.
Down the row, playwright Anatoly V. Sofronov was jotting down notes
on the "pageantry and the spectacle itself."
No doubt he was keeping track (as best he could) of the play on the
field too. As Bill Tarr dived over for a score, Sofronov noted number 30
on his pad followed by a comment that will remain a mystery to non-
Russian-speaking football fans.
AT END OF FIRST HALF
As the first half came to a close, the Russians, who are touring America
at their own expense, were treated to cokes by the American press and
sdttled back to watch the half-time stunts.
The Soviets were visibly impressed by the bands—"Are they profes
sional?" —and watched the card section with interest.
Polevoy, who lost an eye as a war hero, commented that the bands
"looked like military" and that there was similar pageantry at Russian
games.
As half-time activities ended, Stanford Information Director Peter C.
Allen escorted the visitors out of the stadium and over to Hoover Tower
where a group of faculty members waited to chat with them.
Passing through the parking lot. Izakov commented that Americans had
"better and more automobiles than we do."
"In some fields you are ahead of us, and in other fields we are ahead
of you," he explained diplomatically.
SWIM AT RICKEY'S
Earlier in the day, after lunch at Stickney's Hick'ry House, the Russians
had a dip in the pool at Rickey's. (Comrade Sofronov was too big to fit
into a swimming suit, so he remained a spectator.)
Passing the Encina pools, Izakov was asked if he liked to swim.
"Oh, yes, but I don't think I have time now," he said politely.
At Hoover Tower, the Soviets, through English-speaking Valentin M.
Berenzhkov, discussed the subject of criticism: "It has been directed to
improve the situation of our people in order to help our state go forward."
Letters to the editor are important Polevoy stressed, citing an example
where criticism led to establishment of a new tax system in agriculture.
As the conference proceeded, the Russians dispensed with the trans
lator and conversed with their bi-lingual hosts in the native tongue.
Everything continued amiably, with laughter bi'eaking out intermit
tently.
The Soviets whipped out a toy mouse and explained that it was awarded
to the person who told the best joke each day.
LITERARY FIELD
Then conversation turned to the literary field, and Russians discussed
American works and their own products. Throughout the conversation,
the conference seemed more like a living-room chat than a meeting of
Americans and Russians.
Polevoy summed up the purpose of the group's trip:
"We come on a friendly mission to see everything which is worth seeing
in America. We will try to do everything to promote a better understand
ing between the American people and the Soviets."
The Russians then climbed into Cadillac limousines and sped off to
dinner, leaving behind them the atmosphere of the big smile and taking
with them an experience which will be transported back to iron curtain
newspapers and magazines, and finally made part of a joint project of all
the tourists—a book on American life.

where criticism led to establishment of a new tax system in agriculture.
As the conference proceeded, the Russians dispensed with the trans
lator and conversed with their bi-lingual hosts in the native tongue.
Everything continued amiably, with laughter bi'eaking out intermit
tently.
The Soviets whipped out a toy mouse and explained that it was awarded
to the person who told the best joke each day.
LITERARY FIELD
Then conversation turned to the literary field, and Russians discussed
American works and their own products. Throughout the conversation,
the conference seemed more like a living-room chat than a meeting of
Americans and Russians.
Polevoy summed up the purpose of the group's trip:
"We come on a friendly mission to see everything which is worth seeing
in America. We will try to do everything to promote a better understand
ing between the American people and the Soviets."
The Russians then climbed into Cadillac limousines and sped off to
dinner, leaving behind them the atmosphere of the big smile and taking
with them an experience which will be transported back to iron curtain
newspapers and magazines, and finally made part of a joint project of all
the tourists—a book on American life.

THE PAUSE THAT REFRESHES
A. V. Sofronov, playwright and editor, takes a break
Smiling, clapping their hands and gulping down cokes, seven Russian
journalists witnessed their first American football game Saturday in Stan
ford Stadium.
Easily mistaken for alumni or businessmen with the day oft. the carna
tion-bedecked group filed inconspicuously into their seats below the press
box.
Immediately the Iron Curtain visitors were jotting down notations,
drinking in the spectacle and conversing with American newsmen.
"Exciting, very much fun," bubbled the leader of the traveling squad,
Boris N. Kampov-Polevoy, representing Pravda, after Stanford had scored
one of its four first-half touchdowns.
"LIKE ENGLISH FOOTBALL"
"Looks like English football. .They play very well. I like it very much."
A couple of seats away, personable Boris R. Izakov of the monthly
International Life, who looks like a Soviet counterpart of George Gobel,
was distracted by the San Jose pompon girls.
"Are they really students? They are very beautiful," he said in perfect
English, smiling.
Shiny-headed Nikolai M. Gribachev. noted poet and editor of the
Literary Gazette, was taking pictures of the crowd, his comrades and
.American newsmen.
Down the row, playwright Anatoly V. Sofronov was jotting down notes
on the "pageantry and the spectacle itself."
No doubt he was keeping track (as best he could) of the play on the
field too. As Bill Tarr dived over for a score, Sofronov noted number 30
on his pad followed by a comment that will remain a mystery to non-
Russian-speaking football fans.
AT END OF FIRST HALF
As the first half came to a close, the Russians, who are touring America
at their own expense, were treated to cokes by the American press and
sdttled back to watch the half-time stunts.
The Soviets were visibly impressed by the bands—"Are they profes
sional?" —and watched the card section with interest.
Polevoy, who lost an eye as a war hero, commented that the bands
"looked like military" and that there was similar pageantry at Russian
games.
As half-time activities ended, Stanford Information Director Peter C.
Allen escorted the visitors out of the stadium and over to Hoover Tower
where a group of faculty members waited to chat with them.
Passing through the parking lot. Izakov commented that Americans had
"better and more automobiles than we do."
"In some fields you are ahead of us, and in other fields we are ahead
of you," he explained diplomatically.
SWIM AT RICKEY'S
Earlier in the day, after lunch at Stickney's Hick'ry House, the Russians
had a dip in the pool at Rickey's. (Comrade Sofronov was too big to fit
into a swimming suit, so he remained a spectator.)
Passing the Encina pools, Izakov was asked if he liked to swim.
"Oh, yes, but I don't think I have time now," he said politely.
At Hoover Tower, the Soviets, through English-speaking Valentin M.
Berenzhkov, discussed the subject of criticism: "It has been directed to
improve the situation of our people in order to help our state go forward."
