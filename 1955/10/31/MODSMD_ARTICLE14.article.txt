## Council Members and Village LASSU Representative Vote to Be This Week 
### 
Last Friday's ASSU election results decided a total of run:;
offices.
Only 1714 students voted in the two days of polling, showing
a small numerical increase over primary returns which Election
Board Chairman Chuck Falkner had termed "a poor showing."

Two members each for Men's andl
Women's Council and the Village !
Legislature Representative are to be i
chosen in tomorrow's and Wednes- I

Delay in final elections for these
offices was caused by election in
fractions which forced another pri
mary election.
