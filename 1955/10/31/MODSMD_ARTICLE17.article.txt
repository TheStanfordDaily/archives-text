Noimally, we have great faith in people, par
| ticularly the supposedly high-caliber Stanford
J people. Sometimes, however, this iaith is com
' pletely shattered. The card-throwing exhibition
at the last Big Game had that effect. But now
oui faith is at a lower ebb than ever belore. We
submit the following letter:
To the Editor:
1 have never been strongly moved to react to a
"letter to the editor" in the past, and it is disturb
ing that a letter signed in my name, and written
with the intelligence and ability of a small child,
hould so move me now.
I hold Mr. Stone in high esteem, and whoever
was so capable oi quoting my exact opposite re
:.ction to his letter must obviously be well ac
quainted with me. Were he as well acquainted
with discretion and good taste, readers oi this col
umn mivht have been spared his distorted sense
ol humor and inane manner ol' expressing himself.
DAVID W. KING
In addition to the letter to which Mr. King's
name was forged, we also printed Friday a com
plaint from Dennis Murphy to whom a quota
tion in "What Do You Think?" had been falsely
attributed.

To Mr. Mr. Murphy, The Daily
offers its most sincere apologies. We under
stand that because of the forgery Mr. King may
lose his job as a reader in the English Depart
ment; we hope this will not happen.
Because of this malicious misuse of the
Daily editorial columns, we will have to ini
tiate a new policy. The authenticity of every
quotation and every letter will have to be
checked by looking at student body cards.
Every letter to the editor which comes
through the mail will have to include name,
address and telephone number. Those facts
must correspond with University records. Then
we will call the person and check the authen
ticity.
Every person whose opinion is sought and
every person who brings in a letter must ex
pect to produce his student body card.
We must do this for your protection and for
ours.
We must resort to this system at a University
which entertains as its basic premise that its
students are of the highest integrity.
