Don't know if you've thought much about it,
what with it being the morning after and Blue
Monday, but today's Halloween. Yup, check
any calendar. Well, at least act interested.
Golly. Don't know just what to tell you to do,
though; drink an extra glass of orange juice,
maybe.

Sometime today a closed van will roll up in
front of Jordan Hall and disgorge a box or cage
of some sort, and pacing up and down in that
box will be . . . (well, that would be telling,
now). Anyway, this afternoon at 4:15 Dr. Pi
telka, from the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology
at Cal, will talk on "Some Population Charac
teristics of Lemmings in Northern Alaska," in
Room 430. This one is a must for the many lem
ming fanciers on Quad. The lecture will be
preceded by tea at 4, with lemming . . .
Tonight at 8:15 there's a real treat in store for
those who know a good thing when they hear
it. The Concert Series is presenting Leonard
Warren, the current lead baritone at the Met,
in a concert in Mem Aud. If you want to go, but
are sans tickets, try calling DA 3-3870.
And wonder of wonders, Tuesday Evening
Series has something scheduled which bodes
well to being a good thing. They're bringing in
one George Darling, Labor M.P. and wheel in
the 8.8.C., to speak on "Britain's Part in Eu
rope." It's tomorrow night, 7:30, and guess
where.
Boyoboyoboy! Look what we have on the

old calendar for Wednesday afternoon. Wow!
The Mothers' Club Chrysanthemum Tea!
Wow! Don't rush off, you haven't heard where
you get it. It's being held at ol' Doc Sterling's
house, and it costs two dollars. Personally,
we've never tried the stuffâ€”maybe it's like
the Jasmine tea you get at high-class chop-suey
joints. Anyway, why don't you put on your
puce fright wig and go sip a sample? After all,
your money's as good as the next one's.
Wednesday afternoon matinee is here again.
Uh-huh. This week it's Mr. Garff Wilson, talk
ing on "Emotionalism in Acting"; 4:15, Little
Theater.
"Amphitryon 38" is opening its second
week's run tonight. Don't know why. Sure is
a good play to read, though. Tickets are avail
able at Mem Aud box office, and it runs through
Saturday night.
Ram's Head is selling tickets for Gaieties this
week at Mem Aud box office. Next Monday,
what odds and ends remain will be sold on
Quad, so shop early while you still have a
choice.
Flicks Note: This time. it's the postponed
epic, "I'll See You in My Dreams," with that
popular siren, Doris Day. Recommend you
bring an empty ice cream carton, if you go . . .
Fact ot the Week: An important advantage
of the loose housing system for dairy cows is
the lowel- risk of injury to legs and udders.
