San jose import
To the Editor:
An open letter to Ram's Head:
Why is the San Francisco Chronicle able to print an
article (Oct. 26) stating that a San Jose student is
the leading man and writer of seven numbers in Stan
lord's Big Game Gaieties. Doesn't Stanford have
enough talent to put on its own variety show?
We would like to take pride in Stanford; after all,
we chose to attend Stanford, not San Jose. It would
seem preferable to allow our own students to cele
brate our Big Game Week. We certainly hope this
discouraging situation will not arise again.

ram's head answer
To the Editor:
We would like to clarity Ram's Head procedure in
casting Big Game Gaieties. In the past, Ram's Head
shows have been available to any talent that could
contribute to a successful production and could re
ceive training benefits in theater from work on the
shows.
Competition has been open to anyone, including
San Jose students, who offered such talent to our
productions. Ram's Head tryoutees have never been
forced into competition with professional talent, as is
common in other theatrical groups.
This year's Gaieties is an extremely big show, and
the number of Stanford students trying out (even if
as large a proportion as one out of two were suitable
for parts) was insufficient to cast the production.
However, San Jose students were not solicited for
tryouts; Stanford and San Jose tryoutees were ac
cepted or rejected on the same grounds.
Furthermore, we opened our show to numerous
other enthusiastic sources. We received the orches
tration for a cowboy number from Texas, our finale
irom Alaska, and an Indian hoop from the Midwest.
Ironically, even the University of California has made
a contribution to Big Game week in the person of the
Gaieties' musical director.
Stanford student help and support is gratefully re
ceived when volunteered. We have never turned
down a Stanford contribution; we simply have diffi
culty finding it. There is a place in this show for
every talent (construction and design crews, pub
licity, orchestra, cast), and we are anxious to give
these opportunities to any Stanlord student able and
willing to help us.

We must produce a show, we cannot do it with
talent that is not offered, and we are obligated to our
audience to do it with the best talent available.
It seems that people not contributing themselves are
in no position to complain about our producing the
show with help that is offered.
We wish to thank the people who brought this sig
nificant fact into focus: this Ram's Head show is not
being produced by a clique. On the contrary, it is
being produced by any and all people who are (1)
talented, (2) available, (3) dependable, (4) eager to
work on this, Stanford's greatest Big Game Gaieties.

mural news
To the Editor:
Several of us here in Wilbur have been wondering
why there is never any mention in The Daily of the
results in intramural activities. We thank that an ac
tivity in which so many boys take part should merit
some mention in The Daily, and we are sure that the
teams would like to see the results of their endeavors
in print.
Printing of information on intramural activities
would give them an idea of team standing in the Wil
bur leagues. Can something be done to remedy this
shortcoming?

(Editor's note: Whenever space permits, The
Daily prints the account of a mural game of the
previous afternoon. We have been lax, however,
in printing the other scores of the day. But Thurs
day we printed complete standings of the teams.)
a sad story
* To the Editor:
I cried and cried and cried. Your story is so sad,
Mr. Brewer. . . . You're trying very hard, too. I can
tell, I really can. (Almost everyone who writes a
campus opinion is trying) "I have traveled enough
and seen enough to make comparisons on various
aspects of . . ." And I can tell, I really canâ€”you
aren't happy here.
Why don't you fly up and see me and we can gobble
over comparisons and I can iron your hankies and I
bet you'll feel just a whole lot better.
