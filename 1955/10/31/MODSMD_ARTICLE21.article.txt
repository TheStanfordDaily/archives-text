# ‘To Hell and Back’--Hollywood Produces Convincing War Film
## 
### RIC TEAGUE 
When Hollywood undertakes
to film a true story, someone
usually ties. In any documen
tary film there has to be a con
vincing element, but it is fre
quently lacking.
"To Hall and. Back" is convincing
enough to bring on the re-enlist
ments.
The story of America's most deco
rated serviceman, appropriately an
infantryman, is technically without
fault. The acting is also excellent
•and it should be. It is the story of
Audie Murphy, played by Audie
Murphy.
If Universal - International had
chosen to tell only of Murphy's ex
ploits, it could have been excused.

But with a display
of good taste that
is rare in Holly
wood war stories,
the producer made
it the combat his
tory of the Third
Infantry Division
from North Afri
ca to the Rhine,
by way of Sicily.

Anzio beachhead, Casino and south
ern France.

More than the story of Murphy,
it is the story of a hard - hitting
American infantry division and,
more specifically, one platoon of one
company of one regiment of that
division.
In the memories of some, the Al
lied struggle through Africa, Italy

and France may be a little dim—
and to those, this may seem to be
little more than unjustifiable tub
thumping for Murphy by Murphy.
They should be reminded that the
story, "To Hell and Back," could
have been taken from the unit jour
nals of Third Division components.
Murphy is good. His plays his
own story, the tale of a young man
from an impoverished family who
quit grade school to support his
mother and a small crowd of broth
ers and sisters; a man who, by the
time he was 19 years old, had earned
every American decoration including
the Congressional Medal of Honor,
had won three French decorations,
and had risen from buck private to
first lieutenant in the field.
He plays the part as if he were a
little awed by what he did under
the pressure of battle, as if to say,
"This couldn't be me, could it?"
SUPPORTING CAST
He is supported by a number of
men who are bound to remain anon
ymous. They will be remembered by
people who see the picture as Bran
din, Johnson, Kovak, et al. They are
real and believable. They are more
like real soldiers than any other
actors on any other screen.
General Walter Bedell Smith
opens the film with a short intro
ductory talk on the benefits of in
fantry and the heroics of Murphy,
and if you have never seen General
Smith USA (Ret.) in Cinemascope,
you had better not miss it. He
worked himself up through the
ranks and has a great respect for
this man with the Congressional
Medal.

little more than unjustifiable tub
thumping for Murphy by Murphy.
They should be reminded that the
story, "To Hell and Back," could
have been taken from the unit jour
nals of Third Division components.
Murphy is good. His plays his
own story, the tale of a young man
from an impoverished family who
quit grade school to support his
mother and a small crowd of broth
ers and sisters; a man who, by the
time he was 19 years old, had earned
every American decoration including
the Congressional Medal of Honor,
had won three French decorations,
and had risen from buck private to
first lieutenant in the field.
He plays the part as if he were a
little awed by what he did under
the pressure of battle, as if to say,
"This couldn't be me, could it?"
SUPPORTING CAST
He is supported by a number of
men who are bound to remain anon
ymous. They will be remembered by
people who see the picture as Bran
din, Johnson, Kovak, et al. They are
real and believable. They are more
like real soldiers than any other
actors on any other screen.
General Walter Bedell Smith
opens the film with a short intro
ductory talk on the benefits of in
fantry and the heroics of Murphy,
and if you have never seen General
Smith USA (Ret.) in Cinemascope,
you had better not miss it. He
worked himself up through the
ranks and has a great respect for
this man with the Congressional
Medal.
NAKRATOR
General Smith narrates parts of
the film, which is in chronological
sequence of battles. From time to
time throughout the movie, a map
is shown to explain the current posi
tion of the Third and to better illus
trate its advances.

When Hollywood undertakes
to film a true story, someone
usually ties. In any documen
tary film there has to be a con
vincing element, but it is fre
quently lacking.
"To Hall and. Back" is convincing
enough to bring on the re-enlist
ments.
The story of America's most deco
rated serviceman, appropriately an
infantryman, is technically without
fault. The acting is also excellent
•and it should be. It is the story of
Audie Murphy, played by Audie
Murphy.
If Universal - International had
chosen to tell only of Murphy's ex
ploits, it could have been excused.

But with a display
of good taste that
is rare in Holly
wood war stories,
the producer made
it the combat his
tory of the Third
Infantry Division
from North Afri
ca to the Rhine,
by way of Sicily.

Anzio beachhead, Casino and south
ern France.

More than the story of Murphy,
it is the story of a hard - hitting
American infantry division and,
more specifically, one platoon of one
company of one regiment of that
division.
In the memories of some, the Al
lied struggle through Africa, Italy

and France may be a little dim—
and to those, this may seem to be
little more than unjustifiable tub
thumping for Murphy by Murphy.
