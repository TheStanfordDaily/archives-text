# Bonfire Com Seeks Two Scalped Cars
## 
### 
Beside searching for stray pieces
of timber for the annual Big Game
bonfire, the bonfire committee, under
the chairmanship of Steve Ralph, is
looking for two cars with the paint
scraped off the top.
At least, they are looking for the
owners of those two cars.
Saturday morning as the frosh
began hauling timbers for the bon
fire, it seems that the side gate on
their truck swung loose as the truck
went over a bump on Arguello
Street between Stern and Wilbur
Halls.
The swinging gate thoroughly
scraped the top of two cars parked
near the intersection of Arguello
and Escondido and scalped the con
vertible top from a British Morris
Minor.
Ralph said, "We found the owner
of the British car but we couldn't
locate the other two. The insurance
on the truck will cover the damages
and we wish the other two owners
would call me | Steve Ralph | at the
Alpha Delta Phi house or Bill Too
ley | student financial manager | at
the ASSU Office."
The truck was driven by Steve
Carr, a sponsor at Wilbur.
Freshmen will continue work on
the bonfire each afternoon, Monday
through Friday from 1 to 5 p.m.,
and each Saturday from 8 a.m. to
12 noon.
The "big push" will begin on
Nov. IG.
