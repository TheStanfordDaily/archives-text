Probably the most stilling episode
in the film is the repeated attempts
to break out of the perimeter at the
Anzio beachhead. Here a two-story
farm house is taken, lost, taken, lost
again and finally secured -at the
cost of several American soldiers.
One farm houseâ€”necessary as a lo
cation for an FO (forward observ
er).
With short bits of action such as
this, "To Hell and Buck'' tells the
infantry story.
This is a war picture that conveys
to the audience the mission of the
infantry, "to close with the enemy
and destroy him."
Audie Murphy closed with the
enemy and helped destroy him.
