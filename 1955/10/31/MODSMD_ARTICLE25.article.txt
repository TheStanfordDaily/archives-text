# Bronzan Thinks 'Jinx' No Factor In Cardinal Win
## 
### JIM BAKER 
"I'm just grateful that no one
got hurt," said San Jose State
coach Bob Bronzan after Stan
ford's 34-18 victory over the
Spartans.
When asked what the main factor
in the Stanford win was, Bronzan
replied, "I think it was Paul Wig
gin. Stanford's right tackle. Wiggin
raised a lot of Cain with our ball
carriers. We tried our captain, Jack
Adams, on him, but that didn't work,
so .we tried putting two men on him,
but that wouldn't stop him either.
He couldn't even be angle blocked."*
NO "JINX"
Bronzan was asked if the Stanford
"jinx" had anything to do with the
win. He answered: "I don't think
so. We | San Jose| would have
played that way if we had been
playing Podunk. There was no fire,
no zing to our plays."
Bronzan was disappointed with
several of the team members. "I
dpn't know what caused it, but there
seemed to be a lack of poise. The
Hankers and outside men were defi
nitely outplayed."
When asked if he thought Taylor
eased up after the Indians scored
several touchdowns, Bronzan said,
"There's no question about it. Chuck
eased up, held up a little, and took
us off the hook."
TERESA PKAISED
The Spartan mentor praised Tony
Teresa and Joe Ulm for their offen
sive and defensive play, "but the
two got tired out there because they
were making three out of every four
tackles and we didn't have enough
replacements."
Stanford should have a good
chance against USC, Bronzan
thought.
"If Stanford plays against USC
like they played against us the first
few minutes, and if their pass at
tack is functioning, they'll give the
Trojans a rough time."
