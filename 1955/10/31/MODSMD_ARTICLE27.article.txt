THE RUSH IS ON—Stanford's A 1 Harrington (29) has just fumbled a San Jose punt on the
Indian 25-yard line. Both he and Card quarterback John Brodie (12) are bearing down on the
ball as well as San Jose's Stan Beasley (behind Brodie). Spartan Joe Barrington (not in picture)
eventually recovered. Watching the action in the background are San Jose's Tom Powers (65),
Jack Adams (75), and Stanford's Donn Carswell (64). On the next play, Tony Teresa passed to
Mel Powell for the second Spartan touchdown.
