# Stanford Papooses Fall, 29-0, Before Powerful UCLA Frosh
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
The Stanford Papooses were outgunned on the ground and in
the air by the UCLA Brubabes last Saturday in the preliminary to
the Stanford-San Jose State encounter. When the total damage
was totaled up, the score read Stanford 0, UCLA 29.
The visitors from the south got off to a quick start by racking up
15 points in the first quarter. The* ——

scoring started when Denny Dressel
hit Stanford's Bob Pererson in the
Indian end zone for a safety and two
points. The play occurred after Stan
ford had halted the Brubabes on the
3-yard line.
UCLA then took the ensuing kick
off and proceded to march 53 yards
in five plays to score again. The big
play in the drive was Don Long's
pass to Craig Chudy for the final 20
yards and the tally. The score re
mained 8-0 as Chudy's extra-point
attempt went wide of the goal posts.
The Papooses hung on for one
exchange of downs but the Uclan
yearlings, rated one of the best frosh
outfits in Bruin history, were too
much for Coach Bob Ghilotti's elev
en and soon the scoreboard read
15 to nothing.
The second touchdown drive was
engineered by Long, who turned in
the best performance of the day. The
speedy tailback culminated the 33-
vard push by scampering around his
own right end for the last three
yards.
PAPOOSES HOLD
Stanford improved its defensive
play in the second quarter and held
the Brubabes scoreless. Troy Bar
bee, Papoose right tackle, and center
John Thomas were instrumental in
the defensive stands. One of the
standout defensive gems of the game
was turned in by Stanford halfback
Neil Scheidel who snared a Long
pass with a one-handed effort to

halt a potential Brubabe scoring
drive.
The second half found the visitors
back on the scoring trail, however,
with Long and quarterback Dick
Butler doing the most damage. With
a little over seven minutes remain
ing in the third quarter, Long lofted
a long pass to right end Dick Wallen
for the third UCLA touchdown. The
play covered 46 yards and raised the
score to 22-0 with the conversion by
Chudy splitting the uprights.
At this point, Stanford was des
perately attempting to get on the
scoreboard but the visitors' defense
was too strong and the Papoose
drive was stopped cold on the 43-
yard line. UCLA took over posses
sion of the ball there and scored for
the last time six plays later. The final
play was sub fullback Dick Molen's
3-yard plunge through the line.
UKROPINA PASSES
The game ended wuh Stanford
still trying to muster a drive With
Jim Ukropina passing to Scheidel
for 11 yards and to Fred Sehraub for
10 more.
The Papoose cause was hurt early
in the game when starting quarter

in five plays to score again. The big
play in the drive was Don Long's
pass to Craig Chudy for the final 20
yards and the tally. The score re
mained 8-0 as Chudy's extra-point
attempt went wide of the goal posts.
The Papooses hung on for one
exchange of downs but the Uclan
yearlings, rated one of the best frosh
outfits in Bruin history, were too
much for Coach Bob Ghilotti's elev
en and soon the scoreboard read
15 to nothing.
The second touchdown drive was
engineered by Long, who turned in
the best performance of the day. The
speedy tailback culminated the 33-
vard push by scampering around his
own right end for the last three
yards.
PAPOOSES HOLD
Stanford improved its defensive
play in the second quarter and held
the Brubabes scoreless. Troy Bar
bee, Papoose right tackle, and center
John Thomas were instrumental in
the defensive stands. One of the
standout defensive gems of the game
was turned in by Stanford halfback
Neil Scheidel who snared a Long
pass with a one-handed effort to

halt a potential Brubabe scoring
drive.
The second half found the visitors
back on the scoring trail, however,
with Long and quarterback Dick
Butler doing the most damage. With
a little over seven minutes remain
ing in the third quarter, Long lofted
a long pass to right end Dick Wallen
for the third UCLA touchdown. The
play covered 46 yards and raised the
score to 22-0 with the conversion by
Chudy splitting the uprights.
At this point, Stanford was des
perately attempting to get on the
scoreboard but the visitors' defense
was too strong and the Papoose
drive was stopped cold on the 43-
yard line. UCLA took over posses
sion of the ball there and scored for
the last time six plays later. The final
play was sub fullback Dick Molen's
3-yard plunge through the line.
