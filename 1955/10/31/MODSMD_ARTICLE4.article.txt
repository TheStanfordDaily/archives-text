# Card Gridders Strike Early, Belt Spartans
## Jack Taylor Sparks Easy Stanford Win 
### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford's Indians picked up their
first win since Oct. 1 when they
easily whipped their San Jose State
neighbors, 34-18, in the Stadium
Saturday.
San Jose capitalized on some loose
Card ball handling in the last half
to rack up their 18 points but were
never really in the ball game as the
Cards ran up 27 points in the first
half to sew up the contest early.
In that first half, the Cards moved
almost at will through the air, al
though they had some trouble get
ting anywhere on the ground. San
Jose was stacked up in the middle
to stop Stanford's ground game but,
in so doing, the Spartans left them
selves vulnerable to the aerials of
Card quarterbacks John Brodie and
Jack Douglas.
TWO TAKE ADVANTAGE
These two were quick to t?ike ad
vantage of the situation. Between
them. Brodie and Douglas, in the
first half, threw seven completions
in 13 attempts for 144 yards.
The Cards struck first early in
the game £s Brodie threw a screen
pass to Tarr who galloped from the
San Jose 23 to the 3. On the next
play the big fullback smashed over.
The second Card touchdown came
a few minutes later through the ef
forts of halfbacks Gordy Young and
Paul Camera and Brodie.
YOUNG RETURNS PUNT
Young picked up a punt on the
Stanford 30 apparently after the San
Jose defenders thought, that he was
going to let the ball roll dead. The
swift halfback zipped right by a
couple of surprised Spartans and
went for 22 yards to the San Jose
State 48.
After Young failed to gain on the
next play, Brodie dropped back to
pass. His receivers sucked the Spar
tan secondary over toward the east
sideline and left the west sideline
open for Camera who had momen
tarily delayed.
Camera easily hauled in the pig
