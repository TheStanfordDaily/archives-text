# Card Gridders Strike Early, Belt Spartans
## Jack Taylor Sparks Easy Stanford Win 
### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford's Indians picked up their
first win since Oct. 1 when they
easily whipped their San Jose State
neighbors, 34-18, in the Stadium
Saturday.
San Jose capitalized on some loose
Card ball handling in the last half
to rack up their 18 points but were
never really in the ball game as the
Cards ran up 27 points in the first
half to sew up the contest early.
In that first half, the Cards moved
almost at will through the air, al
though they had some trouble get
ting anywhere on the ground. San
Jose was stacked up in the middle
to stop Stanford's ground game but,
in so doing, the Spartans left them
selves vulnerable to the aerials of
Card quarterbacks John Brodie and
Jack Douglas.
TWO TAKE ADVANTAGE
These two were quick to t?ike ad
vantage of the situation. Between
them. Brodie and Douglas, in the
first half, threw seven completions
in 13 attempts for 144 yards.
The Cards struck first early in
the game Â£s Brodie threw a screen
pass to Tarr who galloped from the
San Jose 23 to the 3. On the next
play the big fullback smashed over.
The second Card touchdown came
a few minutes later through the ef
forts of halfbacks Gordy Young and
Paul Camera and Brodie.
YOUNG RETURNS PUNT
Young picked up a punt on the
Stanford 30 apparently after the San
Jose defenders thought, that he was
going to let the ball roll dead. The
swift halfback zipped right by a
couple of surprised Spartans and
went for 22 yards to the San Jose
State 48.
After Young failed to gain on the
next play, Brodie dropped back to
pass. His receivers sucked the Spar
tan secondary over toward the east
sideline and left the west sideline
open for Camera who had momen
tarily delayed.
Camera easily hauled in the pig
skin and trotted into the end zone
for the score. lie could have walked
in for lack of Spartans.
The Cards rounded out the first
half scoring with two second-quar
ter touchdowns. One came on a 1-
yaid buck by Tarr that was .set up
hy Brodie's 28-yard pass to Camera.
The second was the result of Doug
las' 11-yard pass to halfback Bill
Burget.
TAYLOR CONCERNED
"Stanford coach Chuck Taylor was
somewhat concerned over the In
dians' inability to move on the
ground in the first half. However,
he declared that SJS coach Bob
Bronzan "did a good job stopping
our running game" and disclosed
that Bill Tarr had a touch of the
flu u which took considerable steam
out of the line smashes of the coast's
leading ground gainer.
IJarr was able to pick up only 20

yards on nine carries.
In the second half, the ground
phase of the Indian attack improved
noticeably thanks to the efforts of
third-string fullback Jack Taylor.
Described by Taylor (Chuck) as "not
fast but a gutty player," Taylor
(Jack) got in the game and pro
ceeded to gobble up 63 yards in only
five carries to wind up as the leading
Card ball carrier lor the day.
One of Taylor's runs was a spec
tacular 29-yarder during which he
left three Spartan tacklers clutching
wildly at nothing.
The second half also found the
Cards attacked by a case of butter
fingers. The Tribe runners dropped
the ball five times, and on all *ve
occasions the Spartans recovered.
Two of these miscues lead to San
Jose touchdowns.
TARR FUMBLES
The first came only three minutes
into the second half. Spartan Tony
Teresa punted to Tarr on the Stan
ford 20. Tarr dropped the ball and a
wild scramble ensued for possession
of the elusive pigskin. After being
kicked by about five different play
ers, the ball ended up the Stanford
end zorie in the grasp of "San Jose's
Stan Bea^ley.
The second San Jose touchdown
came later in the third quarter after
Card fullback A 1 Harrington fum
bled the ball away. Teresa threw a
21-yard scoring pass to end Mel
Powell.
Stanford's final touchdown was
sandwiched in between the two San
Jose scores. Harrington got it with
a plunge over center from one yard
out.
SPECTACULAR TOUCHDOWN
The final Spartan touchdown came
in spectacular fashion. On the last
play of the game, halfback Walt
Ackemann gathered in a Card punt
on his own 34 and ran it back all
the way.
Aside from a slight rib injury to
center Joe Long, all 39 players who
saw action came out of the game
with nothing but the usual bumps
and bruises. Everyone will be ready
for Southern Cal next week end,
although Coach Taylor declared that
the Trojans "will probably be ready
for raw meat" after their loss to
Minnesota Saturday.
