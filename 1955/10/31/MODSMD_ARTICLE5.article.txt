TARR SCORESâ€”Stanford fullback Bill Tarr scores the third Card touchdown early in the second
quarter of Saturday's game against San Jose State. Vainly trying to stop Tarr are Spartan line
men Tom Powers (65) and Mel Powell (76). The touchdown was set up by a 28-yard pass from
John Brodie to Paul Camera. The Indians won the game, 34*18, for their third victory of the
season.
