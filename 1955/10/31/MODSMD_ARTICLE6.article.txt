# Men Forget Game, San Jose, As Sharon Steals the Show
## 
### DAVE SCOTT 
The football game itself wasn't
the only interest of the Stanford
men's rooting section at the San
Jose State game Saturday.
And for once the famed San Jose
pompon girls weren't the featured
attraction. As a matter of fact, they
seemed almost anti-clamactic. The
spotlight was stolen by a blonde
high school majorette.
The first inkling of what was to
come occurred when the high school
bands, along with many majorettes
entered the stadium. The men's sec
tion gave its hearty approval.
But there was a game to win first,
so the rooting section turned its
attention to the warriors on the
gridiron. With a fairly quick 20-0
lead the Stanford men turned their
eyes to more important things —
namely the high school majorettes
assembling in front of the rooting
section.
The cry immediately went up,
"We want the blonde." "The blonde,"
Sharon Williams from San Ramon
High School was the object of the
yells. When she responded with a

friendly, "Hello boys," into the mi
crophone generously supplied by
head yell leader Jim Walters, a rous
ing chorus of "hip-hip-hooray, pass
her up," resounded from the male
population.
Attention was diverted from the
young lady only for a few seconds
when the Stanford team Indians
again scored, making the rooting
section feel obligated to give a rather
unenthusiastic cheer.
Then the half - time ceremonies
started with 1600 high school band
members out on the football field,
and card stunts being performed by
both rooting sections. But again it
was Sharon who held the eyes of
the Stanford male population with
her agile contortion act while the
bands played on.
Just as the second half was about
to start a voice sung out, "My God,
we forgot about the San Jose pom
pon girls." This exhibition of shock
ing forgetfulness was soon rectified,
as the females in question made the
trip to the Stanford side of the field.
But somehow they weren't re
ceived as enthusiastically as in pre
vious years. Sharon had taken much
of the punch out of their routine,
but still there were howlS of an
guish when the San Jose delegation
left.
The afternoon ended on a happy
note as at the end of the game that
now familiar voice said, "Good-bye
boys," and the Stanford men filed
out of the stadium, hoping that Sha
ron would perhaps return next year.

now familiar voice said, "Good-bye
boys," and the Stanford men filed
out of the stadium, hoping that Sha
ron would perhaps return next year.
The football game itself wasn't
the only interest of the Stanford
men's rooting section at the San
Jose State game Saturday.
And for once the famed San Jose
pompon girls weren't the featured
attraction. As a matter of fact, they
seemed almost anti-clamactic. The
spotlight was stolen by a blonde
high school majorette.
The first inkling of what was to
come occurred when the high school
bands, along with many majorettes
entered the stadium. The men's sec
tion gave its hearty approval.
But there was a game to win first,
so the rooting section turned its
attention to the warriors on the
gridiron. With a fairly quick 20-0
lead the Stanford men turned their
eyes to more important things —
namely the high school majorettes
assembling in front of the rooting
section.
The cry immediately went up,
"We want the blonde." "The blonde,"
Sharon Williams from San Ramon
High School was the object of the
yells. When she responded with a

friendly, "Hello boys," into the mi
crophone generously supplied by
head yell leader Jim Walters, a rous
ing chorus of "hip-hip-hooray, pass
her up," resounded from the male
population.
Attention was diverted from the
young lady only for a few seconds
when the Stanford team Indians
again scored, making the rooting
section feel obligated to give a rather
unenthusiastic cheer.
Then the half - time ceremonies
started with 1600 high school band
members out on the football field,
and card stunts being performed by
both rooting sections. But again it
was Sharon who held the eyes of
the Stanford male population with
her agile contortion act while the
bands played on.
Just as the second half was about
to start a voice sung out, "My God,
we forgot about the San Jose pom
pon girls." This exhibition of shock
ing forgetfulness was soon rectified,
as the females in question made the
trip to the Stanford side of the field.
But somehow they weren't re
ceived as enthusiastically as in pre
vious years. Sharon had taken much
of the punch out of their routine,
but still there were howlS of an
guish when the San Jose delegation
left.
The afternoon ended on a happy
note as at the end of the game that
now familiar voice said, "Good-bye
boys," and the Stanford men filed
out of the stadium, hoping that Sha
ron would perhaps return next year.
