night won the first round in his Na

shaky government.
At the start of the three-day elec
toral debate, the assembly voted 441
to 77 against a motion proposing

outright rejection of Faure's plan
for elections in December instead
of next May.
The motion was drafted by Radi
cal Socialist Henri Caillavet, an all
