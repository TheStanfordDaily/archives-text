# Campus Road Construction Program Near Completion
## 
### 
Work is nearing completion
on the current campus road de
velopment program.
Under construction is a sec
tion of the proposed peripheral
road which will eventually cir
cle the central campus area. Ad
ditional construction is under
way on Escondido Road be
tween Wilbur and Branner and
on Arguello Street between En
cina, Toyon, Stern and Wilbur.
Officials expect work to be com

pleted this week on the section of
the peripheral road from the Men's
Gym to Escondido and on the Es
condido improvements.
The rest of the section of the pe
ripheral road now under construc
tion, from Escondido to the intersec
tion of Arguello and Alvarado, at
the Theta Chi house, is expected to
be completed in two, or possibly
three weeks.
Work is less advanced on the Ar
guello construction which will
change the street to a pedestrian
area from Encina to Stern and will
be completed later this quarter.
The peripheral road section leads

from the Men's Gym, behind the
Eating Clubs, Toyon and Branner,
around Wilbur and to the Theta Chi
coiner.
Future construction will continue
the road up Arguello, through the
site of Russell house, in front of the
future Moore Hall, along the edge of
Lake Lagunita behind Roble and
Lagunita Court and around to the
west of the central campus area.
The asphalt surface is being laid
this week on Escondido and on the
peripheral road from the Men's Gym
to the Escondido intersection. Both
roads have been leveled and oiled,
and have been in use temporarily
during the past week.
These roads will be opened perma
nantly as soon as the surfacing is
completed.
WILL BE OILED
The rest of the peripheral road
section, from Escondido to the Theta
Chi corner, will be oiled this week,
and surfacing is expected to begin
next week. Construction is to be
completed by the following week
end.
Officials emphasize that these ex
pected completion dates are subject
to many contingencies, and unex
pected problems might slow down
work. The important goal, sources
emphasized, is to complete the cur
rent road work before the rains
begin, which might halt work indefi
nitely.
If work is completed according to
schedule, by Big Game week end
the new system will offer three im
proved access points to campus from
the east.
TURN LEFT
Coming down Escondido from
Stanford Avenue drivers may turn
left on the peripheral road and drive
directly to the campus residential
area; they may turn right and drive
directly to Galvez, which leads to
Embarcadero and Palm Drive; or
they may continue on the widened
and improved Escondido between
Wilbur and Branner.
Arguello Street is closed perma
nantly from Encina to Stern, and
traffic has been diverted to Galvez,
which runs parallel one block west
of Arguello.
Officials emphasize that the pur
pose of the road construction pro
gram is not only to alleviate the
traffic problem, but also to divert
the main stream of traffic from the
central campus area.
BEGAN LAST YEAR
This program began last year with
the closing of Engineering Corner to
traffic during class hours. French
man's road, southeast of campus, was
also closed to keep through traffic
off the campus.
The closing of Los Arboles, west
of Lagunita, was a continuation of
this program. With the eventual
completion of the proposed periph
eral road, the major portion of cam
pus traffic will be diverted from the
Quad area.
