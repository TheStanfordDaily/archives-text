# Closing of Beer Garden Is Likely
## 
### 
A closed sign will probably be
hung on Rossotti's Beer Garden as
a result of the near-riot at the stu
dent hangout Oct. 21.
State Department of Alcoholic
Beverage Control authorities say
they will file an accusation of serv
ing liquor to a minor against Ros
sotti's license.
The minor himself has admitted
buying and drinking beer at the
Alpine Road bar on the afternoon
of melee, involving more than
100 students.
At the time ABC agents arrested
him but he escaped amid crowd
"shenanigans."
ABC's Area Administrator Frank
Fullenwider said that a hearing must
be held before the license can actu
ally be suspended. He said that no
date for the hearing has been set.
He pointed out that the usual pen
alty in such cases is a 15-day sus
pension.
Fullenwider said that Rossotti's
bartender had failed to ask the un
der-age drinker for proof of his age.
He did produce a "palpably false"
identification card for the ABC men,
according to Fullenwider.
Last week the ABC said that they
might file more serious "disorderly
house" charges against the beer gar
den. After investigation, Fullen
wider commented, "We think that
charge wouldn't be justified."
Rossotti's has been a favorite
hangout for many generations of
Stanford students.
