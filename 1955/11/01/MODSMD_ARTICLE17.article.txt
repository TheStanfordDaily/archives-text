of Taejon, closed out 32 years of
j Army service today in colorful re

A 13-gtin alule, full dress parade
by 2000 service men and women
and " flyover" by U. S. Air Force

jets honored the lepn, 56-year-old
deputy comamnder of the Sixth
Army.
But the highlight of the ceremo
nies for Dean came when Gen. Max

stepped up before the massed colors
and pinned the Combat Infantry
man's Badge on Dean's blouse.
The badge normally is given only
to infantrymen who have been in
close combat with the enemy for at
