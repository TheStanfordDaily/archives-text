Baritone Leonard Warren is gifted with a fine and flexible voice,
coupled with an easy-going manner which makes him a pleasure
to listen to . . . most of the time.
Last night's concert in Memorial Hall was an excellent example.
Mr. Warren presented a varied program, both in mood and con
sent. The sum effect was a bit un-

even.
In the style of all concert artists,
Mr. Warren devoted the first .section
of his program to the more showy
literature, choosing his selections
from Handel and Antonio Caldera.
HANDEL'S LARGO
The "Ombra mai fu," from "Xer
xes," better known to struggling
piano students as the Handel "Lar
go," gave Warren an opportunity to
display the smoothness and mellow
tone of his voice. "O. Ruddier Than
the Cherry," another of Handel's
works, provided contrast with the
rough and strong voice which War
ren is so capable of producing . . . a
strong voice which is still not harsh.
Turning to the French school for
his second set, Mr. Warren sang the
soft and lush "Les Berceaux," by
Gabriel Faure, again showing the
wide properties of his voice. A Ravel
drinking song and a Vincent D'lndy
madrigal were also warmly received.
Bizet's "Agnus Dei" completed the
second group.
PLEASES AUDIENCE
Turning to a role he played in
Giordano's "Andrea Chenier" for the
San Francisco Opera this year, Mr.
Warren sang the "Nemico delio Pa
tria," again pleasing the full house
at Memorial Hall. For a pre-inter
mission encore, he chose the popular
"Evening Star," from Wagner's
"Tannhauser."
In the second part of the program,
following Verdi's "Eri Tu," from
"Ballo in Maschera," Mr. Warren
turned to considerably lighter music."
Songs by Bridge, Tarrasch and Gi
annjni, along with Richard Hage
man's "The Donkey," completed the
printed program.
Encores included "Old Mother
Hubbard" (a parody on classical
aria) and a song of a man in a glue
pot.
In short, Mr. Warren's program
fell apart after the intermission. His
choice of absurdly light songs seem
ed to be a condescension to the sup
posed whims of his audience. The
alternative to this is falling prey to
his own whim.
Pianist Ralph Linsley, who played
solos following the intermission, has
an unfortunate tendency to override
Mr. Warren with the accompani
ment.

of his program to the more showy
literature, choosing his selections
from Handel and Antonio Caldera.
HANDEL'S LARGO
The "Ombra mai fu," from "Xer
xes," better known to struggling
piano students as the Handel "Lar
go," gave Warren an opportunity to
display the smoothness and mellow
tone of his voice. "O. Ruddier Than
the Cherry," another of Handel's
works, provided contrast with the
rough and strong voice which War
ren is so capable of producing . . . a
strong voice which is still not harsh.
Turning to the French school for
his second set, Mr. Warren sang the
soft and lush "Les Berceaux," by
Gabriel Faure, again showing the
wide properties of his voice. A Ravel
drinking song and a Vincent D'lndy
madrigal were also warmly received.
Bizet's "Agnus Dei" completed the
second group.
PLEASES AUDIENCE
Turning to a role he played in
Giordano's "Andrea Chenier" for the
San Francisco Opera this year, Mr.
Warren sang the "Nemico delio Pa
tria," again pleasing the full house
at Memorial Hall. For a pre-inter
mission encore, he chose the popular
"Evening Star," from Wagner's
"Tannhauser."
In the second part of the program,
following Verdi's "Eri Tu," from
"Ballo in Maschera," Mr. Warren
turned to considerably lighter music."
Songs by Bridge, Tarrasch and Gi
annjni, along with Richard Hage
man's "The Donkey," completed the
printed program.
Encores included "Old Mother
Hubbard" (a parody on classical
aria) and a song of a man in a glue
pot.
In short, Mr. Warren's program
fell apart after the intermission. His
choice of absurdly light songs seem
ed to be a condescension to the sup
posed whims of his audience. The
alternative to this is falling prey to
his own whim.
Pianist Ralph Linsley, who played
solos following the intermission, has
an unfortunate tendency to override
Mr. Warren with the accompani
ment.

Baritone Leonard Warren is gifted with a fine and flexible voice,
coupled with an easy-going manner which makes him a pleasure
to listen to . . . most of the time.
Last night's concert in Memorial Hall was an excellent example.
Mr. Warren presented a varied program, both in mood and con
sent. The sum effect was a bit un-

even.
In the style of all concert artists,
Mr. Warren devoted the first .section
of his program to the more showy
literature, choosing his selections
from Handel and Antonio Caldera.
