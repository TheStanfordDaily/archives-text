The horn is back on the UCLA campus.
The Daily Bruin records this momentous
event in Bruin history in this fashion: "A low
morose, throbbing honk emanated from KH
201 yesterday |Oct. 241 afternoon. It awak
ened several students and a Daily Bruin re
porter.
"They hurried to the spot and found (general
Manager William Ackerman contritely survey
ing a garish red horn which was lying on his
desk.
"I wanted to see if it still worked," he ex
plained; "it certainly does."
"Bystander Don White, chairman of rallies,
remarked that the air horn would hastily be
repainted Bruin |baby| blue."
Other exciting things are happening on the
UCLA campus. With the words, "So long,
honey. This is the last time I'm going to see
you," a man shot and killed his wife, a cafe
teria cashier, in a UCLA building. He then
ptaced the ,38-caliber revolver against his face
and killed himself.
The shooting occurred in the employees' din
ing room and very few students in the main
cafeteria even heard it.

Panty-raiding has now spread to the West
Coast.
According to the University of Oregon Daily
Emerald, "Three participants in Thursday
night's abortive 'panty raid' on three women's
dorms will probably be going home today.
Dean of Men Ray Hawk told the Emerald
Thursday the unidentified trio, nabbed by him
and counselors as they left the dormitories,
faced suspension for 'breaking and entering a
women's dormitory, and for profanity'."
It appsars that the crowd of 200 were spurred
on in their efforts by a trumpeter who alter
nately sounded the infantry "Charge" and
"Mighty Oregon." Coeds taunted the mob
from the windows of the dorms and hurled
scatterings of undergarments to the milling
group below.
Locked windows and doors, coed-wielded
water bags and warnings by the Dean kept the
mob somewhat under control. They were fi

nally dispersed by the Dean, and three were
captured as they came back down trom the
dorm fire escapes.
Six more trouble makers were suspended
from Oregon the day before. The group was
caught burning 12-foot-high "UO" letters on
the Oregon State College football stadium turf.
The group's living organization was charged
with paying the damages incurred, which ran
to about $5C a person.
Pranksters are also facing fine and suspen
sion at the institution across the bay.
Three of the four University of California stu
dents arrested last Thursday in connection with
the impromptu rally riot before the USC game
were given sentence before the Berkeley mu
nicipal court.
Two were given the choice of $75 or 15 days
in jail for lighting an illegal bonfire. A third
paid the whopping fine of $200 for malicious
mischief and fire feeding.
The Student Judicial Committee in a special
session ousted assistant yell leader John R.
Pelkan from office for his part in the rally.
Interfraternity Council is deciding what to do
with John G. Brown, a Deke, who set off a home
made bcmb near his house.
Brown stated that he made the bomb from
three-fourths of a stick of dynamite obtained
during the summer while working on a con
struction job in Sonora Pass. He said he in
tended no harm with the bomb and he meant
it to be all in fun.
The Board of Control at Washington State
College has voted to take serious measures
against reckless drivers from the college.
Those who would be convicted "of such driv
ing which would endanger lives, limb or prop
erty, could almost certainly face the penalty of
not being able to operate a vehicle in the WSC
vicinity."
Washington State's "box score" for the first
month of school is four accidents, two deaths,
five injuries and well over a thousand dollars
of property damage.
