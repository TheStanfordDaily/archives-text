collecting money
To the Editor:
Is everybody new around here except the Row
women and a few old-timers like me?
Last week someone listed the Row Carnival among
the activities that might be dumped, to streamline
Stanford for study time. Even our good Daily did not
protest the suggestion. The Row Carnival is an ac
tivity all right, but it supports the Row scholarship
as well as offering fun. It is difficult to collect money
inactively.
When any student group asks this volunteer gypsy
to read hands at a party, she says thank you very
much but what is it for? Unless it is one of the classic
occasions which are very high-style civics indeed. It
is fine to take care of the world, but helping in your
own neighborhood is the beginning of kindn'esses.
Row Carnival and Branner's hilarious scholarship
party are always accepted. So is the Strawberry
Brunch, when it remembers to invite. So was the
Sophomore Carnival before it went off campus.
(Gypsies are afraid of rows of bottles.) Other occa
sions turn up intermittently which help Stanford by
having fun.
The Gypsy Dance given annually by the Theta
Chis (and considerate hosts they are) is a double
play. The guests don't contribute but the brothers
present the gypsy with a retainer, which she presents
to Stanford for whatever fund benefiting Stanford
students- is appealing at the moment —the Tresidder
Union, or the Med School or whatever.
Fun with a purpose is well worth anybody's time,
student or alum—even spent sitting in a tent and
talking steadily from 8 p.m. to 12, or 9 to 4 a.m. If
any prolessors disagreee, they can get their paw
skinned tor nothing some benefit evening, and the
gypsy will contribute their fee to the fund.

card stunts, why?
To the Editor:
Does the card section contribute materially to the
enjoyment of the football games? Is the majority of
the student body really in favor of participating in
the stunt? Not having attended the University as an
undergraduate, I don t leel that I can answer these
questions, but I do think that they should be asked.
There is no doubt that the enjoyment which might
flow from the viewing of the section is not available
to the students, since it is invisible to most. It is not
reasonable to expect that the student enjoys holding
a colored card. The only enjoyment must flow from
entertaining the remainder of the stadium occupants.
The time and effort devoted by the students in the
section is nominal. The half-time doesn't last that

long. However, there is ordinarily a performance of
the band or seme other entertainment at this time.
Unfortunately the noise of the instructions coming
over the loudspeakers will drown out any music for
most of the spectators in the area. Those in the sec
tion itself view the performance over the top of a
cardboard card. If the performance on the field is for
the remainder of the stadium occupants then nothing
is lost.
The issue is whether the students wish to entertain
or be entertained at the half-time. The alternatives
in this case seem to be incompatible. I wbuld prefer
the latter. Perhaps the majority of the students feci
otherwise.
Must Stanford follow the other schools on the
coast in this custom? Or is it possible that an ac
tivity which has outlived its novelty is perpetuated
by misconstruction of student opinion?

standing practice
To the Editor:
We want to add our wholehearted support to Art
Bronson's idea of standing during the football games.
But we, too, feel that just as the football team and
the pom-pom girls need practice for their perform
t ance, so also should the rooting section get in shape
for their two-hour stand.
Maybe a few pre-game calisthenics would help
limber up the student body, and of course everyone
should be in bed by 10 Friday nights. Those with
Saturday morning classes will have a jump on every
one else as they can get in extra practice by standing
up in class.
We also accept Art's generous offer of "beer money"
to go toward free liquid refreshment (as the football
team receives free water). Yes, we feel that aside
from showing our enthusiastic team support, stand
ing during the game would improve the general
health of the student body.

It is the tradition of Stillman to invite guests to
dinner each week to discuss current issues. Since you
consider yourself so well-versed on the subject of
Stanford women, we would like to discuss this topic
with you quietly at dinner.
We guarantee you a favorable ratio. Do you

To Don Brewer:
It is the tradition of Stillman to invite guests to
dinner each week to discuss current issues. Since you
consider yourself so well-versed on the subject of
Stanford women, we would like to discuss this topic
with you quietly at dinner.
We guarantee you a favorable ratio. Do you
have the courage of your convictions?
STILLMAN HOUSE
collecting money
To the Editor:
Is everybody new around here except the Row
women and a few old-timers like me?
Last week someone listed the Row Carnival among
the activities that might be dumped, to streamline
Stanford for study time. Even our good Daily did not
protest the suggestion. The Row Carnival is an ac
tivity all right, but it supports the Row scholarship
as well as offering fun. It is difficult to collect money
inactively.
When any student group asks this volunteer gypsy
to read hands at a party, she says thank you very
much but what is it for? Unless it is one of the classic
occasions which are very high-style civics indeed. It
is fine to take care of the world, but helping in your
own neighborhood is the beginning of kindn'esses.
Row Carnival and Branner's hilarious scholarship
party are always accepted. So is the Strawberry
Brunch, when it remembers to invite. So was the
Sophomore Carnival before it went off campus.
(Gypsies are afraid of rows of bottles.) Other occa
sions turn up intermittently which help Stanford by
having fun.
The Gypsy Dance given annually by the Theta
Chis (and considerate hosts they are) is a double
play. The guests don't contribute but the brothers
present the gypsy with a retainer, which she presents
to Stanford for whatever fund benefiting Stanford
students- is appealing at the moment —the Tresidder
Union, or the Med School or whatever.
Fun with a purpose is well worth anybody's time,
student or alum—even spent sitting in a tent and
talking steadily from 8 p.m. to 12, or 9 to 4 a.m. If
any prolessors disagreee, they can get their paw
skinned tor nothing some benefit evening, and the
gypsy will contribute their fee to the fund.

card stunts, why?
To the Editor:
Does the card section contribute materially to the
enjoyment of the football games? Is the majority of
the student body really in favor of participating in
the stunt? Not having attended the University as an
undergraduate, I don t leel that I can answer these
questions, but I do think that they should be asked.
There is no doubt that the enjoyment which might
flow from the viewing of the section is not available
to the students, since it is invisible to most. It is not
reasonable to expect that the student enjoys holding
a colored card. The only enjoyment must flow from
entertaining the remainder of the stadium occupants.
The time and effort devoted by the students in the
section is nominal. The half-time doesn't last that

long. However, there is ordinarily a performance of
the band or seme other entertainment at this time.
Unfortunately the noise of the instructions coming
over the loudspeakers will drown out any music for
most of the spectators in the area. Those in the sec
tion itself view the performance over the top of a
cardboard card. If the performance on the field is for
the remainder of the stadium occupants then nothing
is lost.
The issue is whether the students wish to entertain
or be entertained at the half-time. The alternatives
in this case seem to be incompatible. I wbuld prefer
the latter. Perhaps the majority of the students feci
otherwise.
Must Stanford follow the other schools on the
coast in this custom? Or is it possible that an ac
tivity which has outlived its novelty is perpetuated
by misconstruction of student opinion?

standing practice
To the Editor:
We want to add our wholehearted support to Art
Bronson's idea of standing during the football games.
But we, too, feel that just as the football team and
the pom-pom girls need practice for their perform
t ance, so also should the rooting section get in shape
for their two-hour stand.
Maybe a few pre-game calisthenics would help
limber up the student body, and of course everyone
should be in bed by 10 Friday nights. Those with
Saturday morning classes will have a jump on every
one else as they can get in extra practice by standing
up in class.

We want to add our wholehearted support to Art
Bronson's idea of standing during the football games.
But we, too, feel that just as the football team and
the pom-pom girls need practice for their perform
t ance, so also should the rooting section get in shape
for their two-hour stand.
Maybe a few pre-game calisthenics would help
limber up the student body, and of course everyone
should be in bed by 10 Friday nights. Those with
Saturday morning classes will have a jump on every
one else as they can get in extra practice by standing
up in class.
We also accept Art's generous offer of "beer money"
to go toward free liquid refreshment (as the football
team receives free water). Yes, we feel that aside
from showing our enthusiastic team support, stand
ing during the game would improve the general
health of the student body.

To Don Brewer:
It is the tradition of Stillman to invite guests to
dinner each week to discuss current issues. Since you
consider yourself so well-versed on the subject of
Stanford women, we would like to discuss this topic
with you quietly at dinner.
We guarantee you a favorable ratio. Do you
have the courage of your convictions?

collecting money
To the Editor:
Is everybody new around here except the Row
women and a few old-timers like me?
Last week someone listed the Row Carnival among
the activities that might be dumped, to streamline
Stanford for study time. Even our good Daily did not
protest the suggestion. The Row Carnival is an ac
tivity all right, but it supports the Row scholarship
as well as offering fun. It is difficult to collect money
inactively.
When any student group asks this volunteer gypsy
to read hands at a party, she says thank you very
much but what is it for? Unless it is one of the classic
occasions which are very high-style civics indeed. It
is fine to take care of the world, but helping in your
own neighborhood is the beginning of kindn'esses.
Row Carnival and Branner's hilarious scholarship
party are always accepted. So is the Strawberry
Brunch, when it remembers to invite. So was the
Sophomore Carnival before it went off campus.
(Gypsies are afraid of rows of bottles.) Other occa
sions turn up intermittently which help Stanford by
having fun.
The Gypsy Dance given annually by the Theta
Chis (and considerate hosts they are) is a double
play. The guests don't contribute but the brothers
present the gypsy with a retainer, which she presents
to Stanford for whatever fund benefiting Stanford
students- is appealing at the moment —the Tresidder
Union, or the Med School or whatever.
Fun with a purpose is well worth anybody's time,
student or alum—even spent sitting in a tent and
talking steadily from 8 p.m. to 12, or 9 to 4 a.m. If
any prolessors disagreee, they can get their paw
skinned tor nothing some benefit evening, and the
gypsy will contribute their fee to the fund.

card stunts, why?
To the Editor:
Does the card section contribute materially to the
enjoyment of the football games? Is the majority of
the student body really in favor of participating in
the stunt? Not having attended the University as an
undergraduate, I don t leel that I can answer these
questions, but I do think that they should be asked.
There is no doubt that the enjoyment which might
flow from the viewing of the section is not available
to the students, since it is invisible to most. It is not
reasonable to expect that the student enjoys holding
a colored card. The only enjoyment must flow from
entertaining the remainder of the stadium occupants.
The time and effort devoted by the students in the
section is nominal. The half-time doesn't last that

long. However, there is ordinarily a performance of
the band or seme other entertainment at this time.
Unfortunately the noise of the instructions coming
over the loudspeakers will drown out any music for
most of the spectators in the area. Those in the sec
tion itself view the performance over the top of a
cardboard card. If the performance on the field is for
the remainder of the stadium occupants then nothing
is lost.
The issue is whether the students wish to entertain
or be entertained at the half-time. The alternatives
in this case seem to be incompatible. I wbuld prefer
the latter. Perhaps the majority of the students feci
otherwise.
Must Stanford follow the other schools on the
coast in this custom? Or is it possible that an ac
tivity which has outlived its novelty is perpetuated
by misconstruction of student opinion?
