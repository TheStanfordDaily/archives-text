## Dr. Hirschberg Says Attitude Progressive 
### HELEN DEWAR 
How sincere is the religious atmosphere at Stanford? What
can a university do to develop religious attitudes?
Rabbi Harris Hirschberg, a man with a broad variety of interests
including religion, philosophy and literature, explained that he
has seen at Stanford "a very pleasant, progressive approach" to

religion.
Dr. Hirschberg, rabbi at Temple
Beth Jacob in Redwood City for the
past three years, has now tempo
rarily joined the Stanford family to
teach a course in the Old Testament
and Religion in the Humanities De-
I partment. »
RELIGIOUS awakening
"There is definitely in the mak
ing," the rabbi continued, "an awak
ening to religion as a dynamic force
in everyone's daily life, thus keeping
it from becoming a mere social con
j vention and museum piece."
Having taught ( at Hood College in
Maryland and a military academy in
: Virginia before coming to California
lin 1952, Dr. Hirschberg concludes
| that who aim to present
religion "in its true spirit" m-eet a
strong response from many students.
"These students," he said, "are
those who are alert to the deeper
problems of our day and at the same
time are emotionally awake to what
the life of man could be in its high
j est relationships."
BERLIN PH.D.
Dr. Hirschberg, who took the Ph.D.
I degree at the University of Berlin
| and at the Hebrew Union College
in Cincinnati, listed as his primary
fields of interest the Old and New
Testaments, with Semitic language as
a background of the Old Testament
and classic Greek and post-biblical
Jewish literature as a background
of the New Testament.
His other interests, he said, lie in
the fields of comparative religion,
philosophy and history—with music
as a hobby.
"TIN PAN ALLEY"
His musical preferences center
around the classical and the roman
tic. On jazz he commented, "Every
human endeavor has its Tin Pan
Alley."
Considering religious attitudes in
universities and the function of a
university in developing religious
attitudes, the rabbi stated that he
believes that Stanford "can prepare
a religious lay leadership for tomor
row for those who understand and
valfie religion for its own sake as
one of the foremost driving forces in
the soul of man."
"This spirit," he observed, "is un
i mistakably conspicuous in those cir
cles at Stanford with whom I have
had contact."

in Cincinnati, listed as his primary
fields of interest the Old and New
Testaments, with Semitic language as
a background of the Old Testament

Considering religious attitudes in
universities and the function of a
university in developing religious
attitudes, the rabbi stated that he

one of the foremost driving forces in
the soul of man."

i mistakably conspicuous in those cir
