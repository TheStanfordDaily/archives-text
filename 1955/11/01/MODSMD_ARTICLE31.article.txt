From far-flung corners of Quad
here's what professors are saying:
David C. Regnery, associate pro
fessor of biology, after stating that
stomata on plant leaves are open
mors often in the day than at night:
"Of course, we can't tell for sure
because stomata are hard to sec in
the dark."
Bernard F. Haley, professor of
economics, on the government's plan
to distribute butter surplus through
school lunches: "While there are
undoubtedly many children who eat
school lunches, with 360 million
pounds to get rid of, this would
make only a soft spot in the butter
situation."
Thomas A. Bailey, professor of
history, on Napoleon: "He knew a
war with England would start soon.
He knew because he intended to
start it."
Wilfred Stone, assistant professor
of English: "It's quite paradoxical
to be a teacher and to also have a
passionate love of money."
Philip W. Harsh, professor of clas
sics, on a request to postpone a term
paper because of the USC game
week end: "When I first came to
Stanford many years ago, I soon dis
covered that what with Homecom
ing, the Los Angeles game, the Big
Game and the Thanksgiving holiday,
the fall quarter is pretty well shot."
