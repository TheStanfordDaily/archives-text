STANFORD HI. SAN JOSE STATE IX
The Spartans, after their upset of Stanford last year, reverted to their
little Ij i ( tlier role o! former years in this game. The Spartans played un
inspired ball and, for the most part, lacked considerably in poise, whereas
. the Indians handled the situation with the authority of a team used to
•tougher opposition.
t Stanford did not display a powerful ground offensive. For this the
.Spartans must be given credit although the Indians were hurt by the weak
ened condition of fullback Bill Tarr who normally constitutes at least half
]of Indian running attack.
y he Spnrtans sacrificed themselves to stop Stanford on the ground.
'They left themselves wide open in the secondary and Card quarterbacks
'John Brodie and Jack Douglas were quick to take advantage. The two of
them threw 13 completions in 24 .jttempts for 226 yards and two touch
-downs. /
! The game gave Stanford coach Chuck Taylor plenty of opportunity to
use his reserves and some of the substitutes showed surprisingly well.
fullback Jack Taylor came off the bench and rolled up 63
.yards in five carries for the leading Stanford effort of the day. One of his
•runs was a beautiful 29-yarder.
Third-string quarterback Jack Douglas got off to a shaky start but began
.to show more poise in the second half than he has all year.
Second-string fullback A 1 Harrington, although making one costly
'fumble, proved himself to be a real threat when operating on two healthy
.wheels. #
; Stanford's defensive line showed plenty of strength as they choked off
attack with only 65 yards on the ground.
|UCtA 47, CALIFORNIA 0
The Bears proved themselves as inept as ever this year as they took it
on the chin from the Bruins' second-, third- and fourth-stringers. It was
'the third worst defeat in Cal football history.
Despite the fact that "Red" Sanders used Bob Davenport on only one
•play and Sam Brown on only four, UCLA gained 469 yards net. Sanders
'even had to go into the bleachers at half-time to haul out fourth-string
fullback Ken Perry because second- and third-stringers Doug Peters and
'George Martin were all played out.
Cal put up as much of a fight as possible with their limited talents but
•cotild only manage to gain 129 yards. The closest the Bears got to the UCLA
"fcoal line was to the Bruin 44.
I Ronnie Knox turned the heat on his former teammates as he scored two
•touchdowns and completed ,six out of 10 passes for 80 yards. Knox also pro
vided Bear rooters with their biggest cheer when he got dumped for a
loss on one play.
MINNESOTA 25, SOUTHERN CAL 1!)
, This was a real upset as Minnesota had won only one game in five pre
vious attempts. However, the Gophers knew how to cope with the cold
lmd snow whereat the Trojans were out of their smoggy element.
* While the Trojans tried to slosh the ball out of their territory, Minne
sota kicked it out on third, second, or even first down and waited for the
"breaks.
j! Despite the cold, it is surprising that Minnesota, a heretofore punehless
<eam, smashed through the vaunted Southern Cal line for 273 yards on the
Wound. The Gophers really wanted it before a home-town crowd.
, USC kept in the game with spectacular third-quarter runs. Fullback
•Gordon Duvall returned a kickoff 73 yards for one touchdown and halfback
lirnie Merk returned a punt for 93 yards and a score, but these fireworks
'were not enough to offset Minnesota's relentless drives.
■ It will be a long while before the Trojans want to take another trip to
The Northern wilds. They lost to Washington in the rain in Seattle and
jiow to Minnesota in the snow in Minneapolis.
OREGON STATE 13. WASHINGTON 7
I Oregon State continues*to surprise everybody except perhaps them
selves. The team that won only one game all last year and which is now
Comprised mostly of sophomores and juniors holds a 3-1 record and is al
jpnost sure to end up in second place in the conference. The Beavers have
*iever ended up in second place in the conference. The Beavers have yet
"to face Cal and Idaho, the two weakest teams in the conference, and Oregon.
If the Beavers should win all three and USC should beat UCLA, not
far-fetched possibilities, Oregon State would end the season with a 6-1
record compared to UCLA's 5-1. There are better things to come at Cor
vallis.
OREGON 25. IDAHO ft
Oregon's attack again was led by their speed-burning backs, Dick
James, Jim Shanley, and Jack Morris. This trio accounted for the bulk of
the Ducks' 335 yards gained along the ground.
Idaho threatened several times in the first half but were effectively
checked after that as Oregon counted once in the first quarter and three
times in the second half.
The Ducks are rolling along now with three straight wins and promise
to give the remainder of their opponents a rough time.

Oregon's attack again was led by their speed-burning backs, Dick

the Ducks' 335 yards gained along the ground.
Idaho threatened several times in the first half but were effectively
checked after that as Oregon counted once in the first quarter and three

to give the remainder of their opponents a rough time.
STANFORD HI. SAN JOSE STATE IX
The Spartans, after their upset of Stanford last year, reverted to their
little Ij i ( tlier role o! former years in this game. The Spartans played un
inspired ball and, for the most part, lacked considerably in poise, whereas
. the Indians handled the situation with the authority of a team used to
•tougher opposition.
t Stanford did not display a powerful ground offensive. For this the
.Spartans must be given credit although the Indians were hurt by the weak
ened condition of fullback Bill Tarr who normally constitutes at least half
]of Indian running attack.
y he Spnrtans sacrificed themselves to stop Stanford on the ground.
'They left themselves wide open in the secondary and Card quarterbacks
'John Brodie and Jack Douglas were quick to take advantage. The two of
them threw 13 completions in 24 .jttempts for 226 yards and two touch
-downs. /
! The game gave Stanford coach Chuck Taylor plenty of opportunity to
use his reserves and some of the substitutes showed surprisingly well.
fullback Jack Taylor came off the bench and rolled up 63
.yards in five carries for the leading Stanford effort of the day. One of his
•runs was a beautiful 29-yarder.
Third-string quarterback Jack Douglas got off to a shaky start but began
.to show more poise in the second half than he has all year.
Second-string fullback A 1 Harrington, although making one costly
'fumble, proved himself to be a real threat when operating on two healthy
.wheels. #
; Stanford's defensive line showed plenty of strength as they choked off
attack with only 65 yards on the ground.
|UCtA 47, CALIFORNIA 0
The Bears proved themselves as inept as ever this year as they took it
on the chin from the Bruins' second-, third- and fourth-stringers. It was
'the third worst defeat in Cal football history.
Despite the fact that "Red" Sanders used Bob Davenport on only one
•play and Sam Brown on only four, UCLA gained 469 yards net. Sanders
'even had to go into the bleachers at half-time to haul out fourth-string
fullback Ken Perry because second- and third-stringers Doug Peters and
'George Martin were all played out.
Cal put up as much of a fight as possible with their limited talents but
•cotild only manage to gain 129 yards. The closest the Bears got to the UCLA
"fcoal line was to the Bruin 44.
I Ronnie Knox turned the heat on his former teammates as he scored two
•touchdowns and completed ,six out of 10 passes for 80 yards. Knox also pro
vided Bear rooters with their biggest cheer when he got dumped for a
loss on one play.
MINNESOTA 25, SOUTHERN CAL 1!)
, This was a real upset as Minnesota had won only one game in five pre
vious attempts. However, the Gophers knew how to cope with the cold
lmd snow whereat the Trojans were out of their smoggy element.
* While the Trojans tried to slosh the ball out of their territory, Minne
sota kicked it out on third, second, or even first down and waited for the
"breaks.
j! Despite the cold, it is surprising that Minnesota, a heretofore punehless
<eam, smashed through the vaunted Southern Cal line for 273 yards on the
Wound. The Gophers really wanted it before a home-town crowd.
, USC kept in the game with spectacular third-quarter runs. Fullback
•Gordon Duvall returned a kickoff 73 yards for one touchdown and halfback
lirnie Merk returned a punt for 93 yards and a score, but these fireworks
'were not enough to offset Minnesota's relentless drives.
■ It will be a long while before the Trojans want to take another trip to
The Northern wilds. They lost to Washington in the rain in Seattle and
jiow to Minnesota in the snow in Minneapolis.
OREGON STATE 13. WASHINGTON 7
I Oregon State continues*to surprise everybody except perhaps them
selves. The team that won only one game all last year and which is now
Comprised mostly of sophomores and juniors holds a 3-1 record and is al
jpnost sure to end up in second place in the conference. The Beavers have
*iever ended up in second place in the conference. The Beavers have yet
"to face Cal and Idaho, the two weakest teams in the conference, and Oregon.
If the Beavers should win all three and USC should beat UCLA, not
far-fetched possibilities, Oregon State would end the season with a 6-1
record compared to UCLA's 5-1. There are better things to come at Cor
vallis.
OREGON 25. IDAHO ft
Oregon's attack again was led by their speed-burning backs, Dick
James, Jim Shanley, and Jack Morris. This trio accounted for the bulk of
the Ducks' 335 yards gained along the ground.
Idaho threatened several times in the first half but were effectively
checked after that as Oregon counted once in the first quarter and three
times in the second half.
The Ducks are rolling along now with three straight wins and promise
to give the remainder of their opponents a rough time.
