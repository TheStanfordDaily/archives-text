# Waldorf Lauds SC and UCLA
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Northern Cal
ifornia Football writers, California
coach, Lynn (Pappy) Waldorf, said
that comparing USC, who beat him
two weeks ago 33-6, to UCLA, who
ran over the Bears last Saturday
47-0, was like "asking a man who
had been runover by a eight-wheel
ed truck which wheel hurt him the
most."
STRONGER SC LINE
The Bear mentor added that he
thought that the Trojans had more
depth at the tackle and guard posi
tions but that UCLA was stronger in
the backfield. California faces strong
Washington next Saturday but Wal
dorf was noncommittal on his team's
chances saying, "The Huskies are a
sturdy, tough team."
UCLA COMES NORTH
UCLA invades northern Califor
nia for the second time in three
weeks next Saturday when Coach
Henry (Red) Sanders brings his
awesome aggragation to Stockton to
face the College of Pacific Tigers.
COP coach. Jack Myers, said he
feared the Bruins but added that he
has a fine line this year which "can
hold its own against any other in
the country."
Coach Bob Bronzan, of San Jose
State, told the writers that if Stan
ford plays against USC like it did
for the first 12 minutes against his
team, "they will do all right." The
Spartan coach said that his own
team had been on the downgrade
ever since beating Arizona State
27 to 0.
