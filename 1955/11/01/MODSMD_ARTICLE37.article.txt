# MARSHALL TO BE ALL RIGHT FOR SC
## Indians in Top Condition For Troy After SJS Game 
### JIM PIGOTT 
Stanford and San Jose both had something in common after last
Saturday's contest: namely, no injured players. The Indians all
survived without damage and according to Coach Chuck Taylor,
everybody will be ready to go next Saturday against the Trojans.
The only question mark for the Cards was tackle Chris Marshall

who is still a little sore from ankle*
bruises which he took into the Spar
tan encounter. The hefty lineman,
who missed yesterday's practice,
should be able to play down south,
however, said trainer, Connie Jarvis.
DEFENSE STRESSED
The team went through a short
and snappy practice yesterday with
Taylor drilling his charges on de
fense. The regulars suited up as
usual but there was no contact work
for those who played much against
San Jose.
The Indian reserves ran through
a short scrimmage but most of the
day's emphasis was put on figuring
out a defense that will halt the pow
erful USC attack. Taylor said after
practice that he will work on defen
sive tactics throughout the week.
Stanford has yet to beat a single
wing team this season, having drop
ped contests to Oregon State, Michi
gan.State and UCLA. The Trojan
single-wing differs from the UCLA
offense in that the Bruins employ a
balanced line and use lots of re
verses and passes while USC runs
from an unbalanced line and uses
the buck-lateral series.

The Trojans are strong in the
guard and tackle positions and have
all-coast Jon Arnett, Gordie Duvall
and Jim Contratto back from last
year's backfield. Contratto was one
of the stars in last year's 21-7 SC
victory over the Indians in the Stan
ford Stadium.
TROJANS TOUGH
Taylor said yesterday that he ex
pected Southern Cal to be "very
tough" and went on to say that he
thought the Trojans are one of the
best teams in the country. The Card
mentor pointed out that Washington
and Minnesota both beat Coach Jess
Hill's squad with an assist from the
weather.
Stanford plays the men of Troy
on their own field at the Coleseum
where they will have dry footing,
essential to their running game, and
a home audience. The Cards will be
taking a three win, three loss and
one tie record in to the contest with
the southerners sporting a five winâ€”
two loss record.
