Schwaiger got it back right away
on a beautiful interception, and ran
it to the 24. Ryan took a pass and
made it to the 2-yard mark. Metcalf
passed to Ryan in the end zone on
fourth down but was over scrim
mage. The game ended before the
Betas could put the ball in play.
Racking up their fourth win
against one defeat, the Kappa
Sig li s downed their across-the
street neighbors, the Beta I's, 7
to C in intramural action yester
day.
RYAN SCORES
Although the Kappa Sigs drove to
within the Beta 10-yard stripe three
times, they could only push the ball
across once. That play was a pass
from Dale Metcalf to ReiVo Ryan
which covered three yards. The Beta
offense didn't click enough to get a
sustained drive under way at any
point in the contest.
To open the play Beta quarterback
Dan Feltham dropped back and
threw over the middle. Before the
intended receiver could get his hands
on the ball, Joel Adams cut in to
intercept the ball on the 25-yard
line. Metcalf hit his right half, Ryan,
for a first down, but Feltham inter
cepted a third down pass to give his
team the ball on the 15.
Three incomplete passes forced the
Betas into a kicking situation. Art
Pizznat did the booting, but had the
ball carrom off the side of his foot
to make it first and goal for the
Kappa Sigs. Metcalf ran it to the 3,
then passed to Ryan for the score.
A bullet pass over center to Adams
made it 7 to 0.
BETAS THREATEN
The Beta team got the ball after
the score and promptly got a first
down at midfield on a run by Don
Herring. Three passes gained a total
of only seven yards. Joe Turner bat
ted a fourth down pass aside in the
end zone to give his squad the ball
on their own 33-yard line.
The teams exchanged the ball after
failing to gain more than a few
yards. Scott Ferguson intercepted
one of Metcalf's passes as the half
ended with the score still at 7 to 0.
KAPPA SIG MARCH
In second-half play the Kappa Sigs
drove to the 3 on series of passes to
Dick Bean, Leo Schwaiger and Ryan.
Herring intercepted a fourth down
pass in the end zone to stop that
threat and give the Betas the pigskin
on their 17.
