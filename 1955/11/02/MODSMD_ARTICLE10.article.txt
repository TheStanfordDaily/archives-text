# Briton Talks On Country's Europe Role
## MP Urges Work Through Action Of Own Govt. 
### SALLY TRAPNELL 
George Darling toid a Tues
day Series audience last night
that Britain's role in Europe must
be played through the actions of
her own government.
Darling, a Labor Party M.P., em- j
phasized the importance of the
Brussels Pact, which he believes is
the most practical means to Euro
pean unity. It was first adopted in
1946, and after a lapse in popularity,
is again coming to the fore.
By this agreement, governments
of the various European countries
co-operate to break down national
boundaries in such matters as rail
roads, airlines, social security and
agricultural marketing.
"TOO DISSIMILAR"
"We are too dissimilar," Darling i
believes, "to achieve the complete
integration advocated by those who
would like to see a United States
of Europe. The ill-fated Council of
Europe proved this through its lack
of power to carry out recommenda
tions."
Darling mentioned his country's
colonial commitments as another ob
stacle to complete integration with j
Europe. "Many of us have relatives j
in such places as Australia and New
Zealand, and we don't want to lose
contact with these countries."
FUNCTIONAL UNITY
According to Darling the English
believe in a "functional unity" ex
emplified by the Western European
Defense plan. Under this Britain
contributes four divisions to Europe,
keeping them under the control of
her own government.
The non - democratic nations of
Western Europe such and
Yugoslavia prevent complete unifi
cation, however, as a provision pre
vents them from being included in
the plan.
Darling would also like to see the

countries of Eastern Europe included
eventually.
Darling gave his country's export >
problem as a reason for its failure
to join the European Coal and Steel
Community. England must have
control over its coal exports in order
to produce enough power and es
cape bankruptcy, he stated.
POWER SOLUTION
One answer to Britain's power
shortage, Darling suggested, would
be to import some of Europe's
abundant hydro-electric power into
England by cable. He said that IS
nuclear power plants are also being
built to meet this need.
# Darling stressed that many steps
have already been taken to unify
Europe under the Brussels Pact. A
program has already been under
taken which will permit workers to
their social security benefits
from country to country.
Many rail barriers have already
been broken down, Darling stated,
and plans are under way to establish
some sort of common language for
the whole continent." There would j
probably have to be two or three
languages taught because of strong j
national feeling.
INTERNAL PROBLEMS
Darling also touched on Britain's
internal problems. He stated that
the main one is to keep up with
the country's rapidly expanding in
dustry. There is over-employment,
with disabled persons and married
women being used to a great extent.
In answer to a question, Darling
expressed his satisfaction with his
country's colonial situation. Eng
| land's policy is to make the colonies
l self-governing as quickly as pos
sible, and he believes they are well
on the way in most cases.

"TOO DISSIMILAR"
"We are too dissimilar," Darling i
believes, "to achieve the complete
integration advocated by those who
would like to see a United States
of Europe. The ill-fated Council of
Europe proved this through its lack
of power to carry out recommenda
tions."
Darling mentioned his country's
colonial commitments as another ob
stacle to complete integration with j
Europe. "Many of us have relatives j
in such places as Australia and New
Zealand, and we don't want to lose
contact with these countries."
FUNCTIONAL UNITY
According to Darling the English
believe in a "functional unity" ex
emplified by the Western European
Defense plan. Under this Britain
contributes four divisions to Europe,
keeping them under the control of
her own government.
The non - democratic nations of
Western Europe such and
Yugoslavia prevent complete unifi
cation, however, as a provision pre
vents them from being included in
the plan.
Darling would also like to see the

countries of Eastern Europe included
eventually.
Darling gave his country's export >
problem as a reason for its failure
to join the European Coal and Steel
Community. England must have
control over its coal exports in order
to produce enough power and es
cape bankruptcy, he stated.
POWER SOLUTION
One answer to Britain's power
shortage, Darling suggested, would
be to import some of Europe's
abundant hydro-electric power into
England by cable. He said that IS
nuclear power plants are also being
built to meet this need.
# Darling stressed that many steps
have already been taken to unify
Europe under the Brussels Pact. A
program has already been under
taken which will permit workers to
their social security benefits
from country to country.
Many rail barriers have already
been broken down, Darling stated,
and plans are under way to establish
some sort of common language for
the whole continent." There would j
probably have to be two or three
languages taught because of strong j
national feeling.
INTERNAL PROBLEMS
Darling also touched on Britain's
internal problems. He stated that
the main one is to keep up with
the country's rapidly expanding in
dustry. There is over-employment,
with disabled persons and married
women being used to a great extent.
In answer to a question, Darling
expressed his satisfaction with his
country's colonial situation. Eng
| land's policy is to make the colonies
l self-governing as quickly as pos
sible, and he believes they are well
on the way in most cases.
George Darling toid a Tues
day Series audience last night
that Britain's role in Europe must
be played through the actions of
her own government.
Darling, a Labor Party M.P., em- j
phasized the importance of the
Brussels Pact, which he believes is
the most practical means to Euro
pean unity. It was first adopted in
1946, and after a lapse in popularity,
is again coming to the fore.
By this agreement, governments
of the various European countries
co-operate to break down national
boundaries in such matters as rail
roads, airlines, social security and
agricultural marketing.
