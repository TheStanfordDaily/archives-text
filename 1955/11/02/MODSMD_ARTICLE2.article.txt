## Dulles, Franco Meet in Spain 
### 
MADRID, Nov. 1 (UP)—Secre
tary of State John Foster Dulles
made an unprecedented flying
visit from Geneva to confer to
day with Generalissimo Fran
cisco Franco on problems in the
troubled Mediterranean area.
It was the first visit of an Ameri
can secretary of state to Spain since
the Spanish Civil War.
Dulles and two of his top advisers
conferred for one hour and 40 min
utes with Franco and Foreign Min
ister Alberto Martin Artajo, in the
Spanish chief of state's private study
at El Pardo Palace.
Informed sources said the talks
were "wide ranging," embracing
Mediterranean defense, the uneasy
North African situation and further
integration of Spain in Western plan
ning. They said the talks also dwelt
on spreading Soviet influence in the
vital Middle East.
Geneva reports said Dulles' main
purpose was to seek links between
Spain and NATO. He was believed
to have the same objective in mind
for his one-day call on Yugoslavia's
President Tito next Sunday.
The talks thus were believed to
have concentrated on how Spanish
influence can be extended and Span
ish cooperation with other Western
nations intensified. This could in
clude a possible Spanish link-up
with NATO or the Western Euro
pean Union.
In an impromptu speech over the
Spanish radio before his departure,
Dulles said the talks would serve to
make U.S.-Spanish relations "even
closer." He described the discussions
as "most valuable."
The Spanish foreign affairs min
istry said in a communique tonight
that Dulles and Franco "found them
selves in mutual understanding" on
"the principal problems which affect
the peace and security of the free
nations."
The communique said the talks
also dealt with relations between
the two governments in the frame
work of their agreements on mutual
defense assistance and economic aid.
