# IFC, ICC Groups Schedule Discussion of Rush Rules
## Mass Meeting in Cubberley Set for Monday Night; Representatives to Consider Spring Quarter Rushing 
### 
Representatives of Stanford's fra
ternities and eating clubs will gather
Monday night to decide whether for
mal rushing should be changed from
its present position early in winter
quarter to spring quarter.
Fifteen members of each house
and club on campus have been in

vited to attend the meeting by the
Interfraternity Council and Inter
club Council. The number must be
limited since Cubberley only ac
commodates 500.
Speeches will be given by Willicun
Craig, new dean of men, and repre
sentatives of the fraternities and

eating clubs. Following the talks,
those men attending the meeting
will be free to discuss the problem
from the floor.
The meeting has been set for 7:1)
p.m. next Monday in Cubberley Au
ditorium.
VOTE SCHEDULED
Those men who attend the meet
ing are expected to carry the infor
mation gathered back to their re
spective houses and clubs. A vote
will be taken the following Monday,
Nov. 14,. in fraternity and club meet
ings to find the consensus of opinion
of the members.
The vote in house meetings to
find the members' opinions will be
taken individually, stressed IFC
president Ron Wagner. Houses will
not make their recommendations in
blocs, but will send in the number
voting for rushing in each quarter,
COUNCILS MAY ACT
Nothing definite will be decided
by the balloting, but IFC and ICC
could act upon any recommendation
which the majority of the fraternity
and club men make.
Spike Lynch and Bob Wei> Hi
head the rushing committees of IFC
and ICC, respectively. Lynch's com
mittee made the recommendation for
the mass meeting. <
Because of Cubberley's limited
seating capacity, each club and
house has been asked to send only
15 members. IFC and ICC have rec
ommended that five representative
from each class attend -for each unit.
RUSHING PROBLEMS
Other problems besides the ques
tion of when formal rushing should
occur are expected to be discus, ed
at the meeting. A questionnaire
filled out by freshmen last yeai
shows that over one-half of them
desired a longer rushing period.
A hypothetical schedule of spring
quarter rushing has been posted in
the fraternities and eating clubs the
past week. This included four night
of open houses along the Row fol
lowed by five nights in which pat tie
could be held.
An orientation period for fresli
men late in winter quarter was also
included in the possible program.
QUESTIONNAIRE RESULTS
The freshman questionnaire
which was passed out by resident,
assistants last year, showed that 50
per cent desired more open house:-,
while only one-quarter wanted the
same number.
The present no-contact rule wa
desired by 45 per cent of all fresh
men, only 17 per cent asking for it
complete abolition.
Almost one-half of the freshmen
wanted formal rushing kept in the
winter. Those who remained inde
pendents, however, showed sum :
desire for a change to spring quarter.
