### 
Sorely needed new blood comes to the Legis
lature tonight. Seven representatives were
elected in last week s balloting; one more will
Le chosen today.
The new membership of the ASSU's most
important organ includes Louise Larson from
Lagun'ta, Joanne Savage from Branner, Sue
Thorson from Roble, Irv Hall from Men's Row,
Tom Kranz and Anoiew Randolph from Wilbur
and Curtis Rethmeyer from Toyon. Phil Euler
or Andrew Kjos will represent the Village.
Perhaps these eight people will be able to
shake up the Legislature, stir up some interest
and seme action. Even if the group wanders
far from the motion on the floor or hops aboard
its monotonous merry-go-round more often, it
will be better than lifeless disinterest.
The Legislature has not been interested
enough to perform its simplest, most routine
function—approving the minutes of the pre
vious meeting. The minutes are jllaced in the
ASSU Office and are to be read by the mem
bers before each Wednesday night meeting.

Last week a quorum finally had managed to
read the minutes of the Sept. 30 meeting and
they were approved.
Another example oi the Legislature's laxness
was the passage of the constitutional amend
ment before the members knew what the issue
was. Luckily, they realized their ignorance in
time to halt a hastiiy-planned student refer
endum.
President George Ralph has been delaying
the appointment of a sub-committee to handle
preliminary legislative work involved in chang
ing by-laws. Ralph has waited until the body
reached full strength; he was practically forced
to wait because none of the old members
showed any interest.
in the past, student government has been
justly criticized because people in high places
were too wrapped up in their own importance.
But they, at least, tried to do their jobs.
The current Legislature, however, has been
avoiding its obligations diligently. This is a
new twisl a step too far in the other direction.
