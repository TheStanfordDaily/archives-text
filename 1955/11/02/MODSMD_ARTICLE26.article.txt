# the
						time has come

### 
Construction of the east arc of the peripheral
road is progressing according to schedule. We
are glad to hear that encouraging news. It
means the University can start thinking about
other roads.
And not new roads, either. The campus pop
ulation has been reasonably patient and has
not complained too strenuously about the con
dition of the old roads. The University's finan
cial situation has been considered. The difficul
ties have been understood.
But now the time has come . . .
Two or three stretches of our road system
would be proud additions to any new-car test

ing course. Any car that can withstand a drive
from Physics Corner to Palm Drive would pass
any rough-road test at the head of its class.
That streich of road is practically an obstacle
course.
The road in front of the BAC is almost as dan
gerous. So are a couple of other stretches of
the main road around the south and west sides
of Quad.
These stretches should be torn out and re
paved as soon as the peripheral road is opened.
The University has been delaying the inevi
table with temporary measures too long. T)ie
inevitable is with us now.
