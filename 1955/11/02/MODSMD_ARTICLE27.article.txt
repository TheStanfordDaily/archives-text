not amusing
To the Editor:
Earl Cilley's column. ''This Week on Quad," has
steadily increased in poor taste. To me, the sarcastic
manner in which Cilley talks about events-to-come
is certainly not amusing and neither is it informative,
especially since he has taken to editorializing.
In Monday's column, for example, Cilley says that
he doesn't know why "Amphitryon 38" is running
for a second week, but that it "sure is a good play
to read, though." If someone had not seen the play
and had contemplated doing so, Cilley's comment
would hardly help him. The play is here and is ad
mittedly a fins comedy, one well worth seeing, and
that is all that Cilley should have said.
In the same column he speaks in an excessively
flippant fashion about the Mothers' Club Tea and the
Tuesday Evening speaker; and in previous columns
he has managed to heap various degrees of abuse on
President Sterling, "Treasure of Sierra Madre," out
standing scholars in fields about which Cilley evi
dently doesn't know much, and everything else that
he thinks lends itself to a labored joke.
Perhaps we are supposed to laugh at his comments,
but I don't see what is intrinsically funny about the
events he describes. If anything, the column should
serve the function of directing the reader toward
events he might otherwise overlook, not away from
them with a Cilley laugh.
As it stands, this column serves no useful purpose
and chooses instead the lamentable alternative of
evoking the cheapest of laughs (ami the most dan
gerous).

(Editor's note: Since "This Week on Quad" was
begun earlier this year, the preponderance of the
reaction lias been favorable. The purpose of the
column is both to inform the campus of what events
jive taking place and at the same time poke a little
friendly fun at them.
(Even the President's Office, we understand,
enjoyed the comments Mr. Cilley made about the
welcoming tea for freshmen. We are sorry Mr.
Vecsey does not find the column amusing.
(First Mr. Vecsey complains about editorializing:
then he suggests that Mr. Cilley say "Amphitryon
.'JN is "well worth seeing." That is editorializing—
only it is pro, not con. We allow Mr. Cilley to edi
torialize—either pro or con.
(Incidentally, we refer Mr. Vecsey to our page
one review Thursday of "Amphitryon," not written
by Mr. Cilley. It said that the play "tended to fall"
into the category of a "plodding production in
which the sparkling wit rarely filters through."
(We hope that people 011 the campus can be "big"
enough to take a little razzing now and then in
Mr. Cilley's column and that campus life and The
Daily's approach to campus life is not completely
formal and staid.)
no standard texts
To the Editor:
As an outsider I would like to comment on the
inadequacies of the Stanford Bookstore, and they are
<mious ones, too. Stanford is a great University in
many ol its departments, but as far as the Bookstore
is concerned, it is a disgrace to Stanford. There are
very few of the standard, classical textbooks in the

Bookstore. This is true in the fields of mathematics,
the natural and biological sciences and English.
I am sure that if any member of the staff were to
look into this matter as it concerns books in his field,
he would simply be shocked beyond words. There is
absolutely no excuse for this sad state of affairs.
At the present time one must waste precious time
by ordering from the East or from Los Angeles if he
wants anything except the textbooks currently in use.
(I am talking about textbooks only, and not current,
light reading which most students cannot afford any
way.) I would like to suggest that the members of
the student council start agitating for a textbook store
worthy of Stanford.

poor reporting
To the Editor:
The Stanford soccer team is a group of Stanford
students who play a little known sport for the fun
of playing it, not for the glory involved. Therefore
they expect nothing more from The Daily than that
it should fulfill its obligation to cover all aspects of
Stanford athletics. They do feel, though, that this
obligation extends to reporting the facts in an un
biased and truthful manner.
We refer to the article in The Daily of Oct. 31
entitled "Indian Soccermen Shut Out by Dons for
First Defeat." If space permitted, we would compare
quotes from this article with ones from an article in
the Oct. 30 San Francisco Examiner entitled "Don
Soccer Team Routs Injuns. 5-0" which indicate that
the Daily writer merely paraphrased the latter article
in doing his job of "covering" the soccer game.
This would not be so bad if the paraphrased article
had not been in turn provided by a USF writer (a
fact verified by a call to the Examiner reporter in
charge of the article). We do not expect The Daily
to cover personally all or any of our games. We do
believe they could take the time to check facts with
some member of the team. Had they done this, they
would have found that this article is loaded with
exaggerated statements which might be passed off
as good publicity. f
However, there is one description which cannot be
passed off as good publicity. This is the explanation
of how the Stanford fullback Skip Lord had his. leg
broken. According to USF, hence the Examiner,
hence The Daily, Skip broke his leg while sliding to
block a shot of the USF center forward.
In actuality, Skip had the ball and the USF player
jumped at the ball with both feet off the ground, a
foul play according to soccer rules. The ball was
missed, but the leg was not. We do not claim this
was intentional, but we do claim that the story was
a direct attempt to cover up the foul committed. And
we believe that good reporting should present the
exact facts.
People will say this letter is just poor sportsman
ship. The soccer team has lost games before by bigger
scores and can and have taken it. But it would like
The Daily to extend to it the courtesy of reporting
these defeats correctly instead of adding insult to
injury by incorrect stories from other papers
because it is too much trouble io make a phone call
to a Stanford player to check the facts.
