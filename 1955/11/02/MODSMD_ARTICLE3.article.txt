# General Strike Called Off in Argentina
## 
### 
BUENOS AIRES â€” The General
Confederation of Labor (CGT), bul
wark of the fallen Peron dictator
ship, today called off a scheduled
nation-wide strike by its members.
The walkout, which was an open

challenge to the new government of
President Eduardo Lonardi, was
called off after a meeting between
leaders of the CGT and Labor Min
ister Luis Cerrutti.
An official announcement said "a
satisfactory agreement was reached"
on the dispute between the govern
ment and the confederation.
The CGT ordered all workers to
return to their jobs.
They had been ordered out at one
minute past midnight yesterday
morning (7:01 p.m. PST Tuesday)
in an effort to force the government
to reinstate Peronist officials ousted
from the CGT's 2400 member unions.
Less than an hour later, the call
to return to work was issued by CGT
delegates Andrea Framini and Luis
Natalini as they emerged from a
meeting with the labor minister.
President Lonardi, who was in a
sanatorium because of a high blood
pressure condition, was scheduled to
return to his office today to deal
with the strike, the biggest threat
to his six-week-old administration.
