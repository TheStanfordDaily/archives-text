# ASSU Scholar Meier Compares Education in West, East Berlin
## 
### GERRY SMITH 
Her native Germany, its prob
lems and ils future are foremost
in the thoughts of Barbel Meier,
ASSU - Berlin Affiliation Com
mittee scholar from West Berlin.
She is a .strong advocate of Ger
man reunification, but since the Ge
neva Conference she has lost tome
of her optimism about the possibility
of achieving that goal.
Among the primary differences
-he notices between Fast and West
Berlin is tne way children are edu
cated. Communistic education be
gins in kindergarten for the children
of East Berlin.
"The Communists take old folk
tales and change them," she noted.
"For example, in the story of Little
Red Riding Hood, the wolf becomes
a capitalist and the heroic woods
man is a good Communist."
East Berlin parents try to help
change these ideas, but it's hard to
do. Often both parents have to work,
and the children are left in school
or at required Communist youth
meetings most of the time.
The strongest groups trying to
keep democratic ideals alive are the
churches, both Protestant and Cath
olic, Miss Meier commented.
Turning to other aspects of East-
West Berlin relationships, she told

of the difficulties of travel between
the two zones. She seldom goes to
East Berlin herself became "Free
University of Berlin students are
considered American agents, espe
cially those originally from East Ber
lin."
"When I was in Berlin, there were
500 refugees each day from the East
ern sector," Miss Meier said. More
people would flee, "but many lost

I everything by bombing during the
j war and hate to leave everything
! again after they have so recently
J regained it."
When anyone flees from East Ger
man y, the "Sovietists" confiscate
I their belongings.
Except ior two years during World
War 11, she has lived hoi 22 years
in Berlin. In 194.'} thousands of Ber
liners, including Mi s Meier and her
parents, fled to Poland to escape the
heavy Allied bombing.
They left Poland to return to Ber
lin only a few miles ahead of the
advancing Russians. Since the end
of the war her father has taught in
Berlin, and she has attended school
there.
As a graduate student at Stanford,
j Miss Meier is taking courses in his
| tory and political science. She will
have one more year at the Free
; University when she returns.
After she has completed her edu
cation, she would like to work in the
[ history or political science depart
ment of a publishing firm or enter
politics. But she i.s concerned with
j the difficulty of finding employment
| in a Germany so heavily populated
as well as unsettled.
Miss Meier likes being at Stanford
very much. She especially enjoys
meeting "so many students from so
j many countries—the Free University
is too poor to give many scholar
ships."

"The Communists take old folk
tales and change them," she noted.
"For example, in the story of Little
Red Riding Hood, the wolf becomes
a capitalist and the heroic woods
man is a good Communist."
East Berlin parents try to help
change these ideas, but it's hard to
do. Often both parents have to work,
and the children are left in school
or at required Communist youth
meetings most of the time.
The strongest groups trying to
keep democratic ideals alive are the
churches, both Protestant and Cath
olic, Miss Meier commented.

University of Berlin students are
considered American agents, espe

"When I was in Berlin, there were
500 refugees each day from the East
ern sector," Miss Meier said. More
people would flee, "but many lost

I everything by bombing during the
j war and hate to leave everything

Except ior two years during World
War 11, she has lived hoi 22 years
in Berlin. In 194.'} thousands of Ber
liners, including Mi s Meier and her
parents, fled to Poland to escape the
heavy Allied bombing.
They left Poland to return to Ber
lin only a few miles ahead of the
advancing Russians. Since the end
of the war her father has taught in
Berlin, and she has attended school
there.
As a graduate student at Stanford,
j Miss Meier is taking courses in his

have one more year at the Free

After she has completed her edu
cation, she would like to work in the
[ history or political science depart
ment of a publishing firm or enter
politics. But she i.s concerned with
j the difficulty of finding employment
| in a Germany so heavily populated
as well as unsettled.
Miss Meier likes being at Stanford
very much. She especially enjoys
meeting "so many students from so
j many countries—the Free University
is too poor to give many scholar
