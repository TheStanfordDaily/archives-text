but worked entirely on its running
game against Stanford's defenses.
The Trojan ineligible squad, the
Spartans, set up the, Stanford de-
I fense.
Following the scrimmage, the Tro
jans worked on defense against
Stanford's passing attack. It was not
a full contact drill although the
passers were rushed. Coach Jess
Hill used all his ends and backs in
an effort to find a defensive unit
capable of coping with the Indian's
passing attack.
Center Vern Sampson and half
back Don Hickman were both held
out of the contact work.
Stanford plays the Trojans on their
own field at the Coliseum where they
will have dry footing, essential to
their running game, and a home au

a three win, three loss and one tie
record, while the hosts are five and
