# Effigy Hangings Now Number 3; Kircher Victim
## 
### 
PULLMAN. Nov. 1 (UP)—Coach
A 1 Kircher of Washington State Col- j
lege was "hung in effigy" Tuesday
on the Pullman campus—to bring to
three the number of football mentors :
in the Pacific Coast Conference who i
have become the target of either
outraged students or pranksters.
Kircher, with a team that has
beaten only lowly Idaho this year,
was hanged in effigy from a tree in
the corner of the campus. A dummy
labled "Kircher" hung from the
limb, with an attached sign reading,
"It's time for a change."
Earlier in the season, coach Lynn
(Pappy) Waldorf was hunq in effigy
on the California campus; and Mon
day, Coach Johnny Cherberg of
Washington got the same treatment.
In the case of Cherberg, the hang
ing was thought to be pretty much
of a gag, in view of the fact that
Washington is having a fairly good
season, with victories over Southern
Califomis, Idaho, Oregon and Min
nesota. The Huskies have lost to
Baylor and Oregon State, and been
tied by Stanford.
