# 'Sequoia' Selected as New Name for Literary Magazine
## 
### 
'"Sequoia" instead of "Stanford 1"
will be the name of the new Stanford
literary magazine. The change came
as the result of a recent meeting of
the magazine's editorial board.
According to Don Shoup, member
of the Sequoia Editorial Board, the
change was made for "business rea
sons." Shoup pointed out that the
new name will not restrict the con
tent or policy of the magazine.
The Sequoia Editorial Board is
composed of the following named
members: Linda Lovelace, editor
in-chief; Hal Hansen, business man
ager; Les Millet, Luis Harss, associ
ate editors; Celia Barker, copy edi
tor; Karen Neubert, art editor; Mer
rill Carlsmith, Don Shoup and Suzi

Wile, advisory editors; and Wilfred
Stone, faculty advisor.
Shoup announced the formation
of a committee composed of faculty
and staff which will be independent
of Sequoia, but which will aid the
staff of the magazine in selecting
research papers that are worthy of
publication.
This committee will judge research
papers submitted to it that are a
result of research beyond that re
quired by University courses.
if the committee judges a research
paper to be worthy of publication it
will petition the University that the
student who wrote the paper be
given one unit of A credit.
The members of the committee are

Wilfred Stone, Charles Allen, James
McNelis and Jess Bell of the Stan
ford Press.
It should be made clear that there
is no formal connection between this
committee and the Sequoia, Shoup
noted.
Papers that receive one unit of A
credit will not necessarily be pub
-lis h e d by the literary magazine,
Shoup concluded. By the same token,
papers that are not judged to be
worthy of A credit may be pub
lished.
