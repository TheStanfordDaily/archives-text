FIRE CONSUMES BOOTH—As Director of Athletics Alfred R. Masters looked on, a 6-by-10-
foot ticket booth went up in smoke at noon yesterday near gate "G" of Stanford Stadium. Fire
trucks raced to the scene to quench the blaze which started inside and consumed the roof.
Firemen (1. to r.) Roger Anderson, John Quinn and Don Peterson found the door locked and had
to axe their way in. Chief John Marston thinks that the fine might have been started by a cig
arette butt left smoldering inside after Saturday's game. Masters ventured no guess as to the
amount of damage, but said he thought it was :overed by insurance. Marston estimated the
loss at from $200 to $300.
