### 
LONDONâ€”Prime Minister Antho
ny Eden sidestepped growing con
troversy over Princess Margaret's
choice of duty over love for Peter
Townsend today by disclosing lie >
may seek alterations of the royal
marriage law.
Asked in Parliament by M.P. Mar
cus Lipton if the government in
tended to amend the Act of 1772, |
Eden replied, "I have had this pos- ;
sibility very much in mind."
The Act, promulgated by King [
George 111, was designed to keep his j
two brothers in check and binds all j
his descendents, of whom Margaret j
is one, to get royal consent before
marrying prior to age 25, and to j
seek parliamentary approval after
age 25.
