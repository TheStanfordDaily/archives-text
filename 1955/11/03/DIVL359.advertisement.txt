Are you satisfied with your
sweater drawer? Does it hold the
downy, Huffy yarns unique, to this

daffodils, the muted tone of oxford
grey, the lavendered hue of French
blue, peek back at you from its
dark depths? Does every one of
your beautiful skirts have its
Heaven-joined sweater-mate?

come to Lunctin-Mcßride quickly,
via car, bus, or bike; see, feel the
colorful, cushiony collection in out
sweater bins. If you're a Califor
nia female, these are for you.
