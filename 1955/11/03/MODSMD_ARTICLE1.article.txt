Seeking clarification in Fun
damental Standard jurisdiction,
ASSU Legislature last night
moved to appoint a committee to
report on the judicial status of
the Interfraternity Council.
LASSU members heard Ron Wag
ner. IFC president,' and Men's Coun
cil chairmau Bill Allen report on the
possible problem of double jeopardy
involved in hearing Fundamental
Standard violations.
Wagner explained that the IFC
Judicial Council does handle viola
tions if they also involve infraction
of fraternity rules. He said they
only rule on the fraternity as a
whole, however.
It was pointed out that possibly
Men's Council could step in and try
individual members, or even the
house as a whole.
Allen suggested that a body be
drsienated which would decide
whether any particular violation
should come under Men's Council
as that of an individual or under the
IFC Judicial Council as being a
house violation.
Allen and Wagner favor making
Men's Council that body, while some
Legislature members mentioned the
possibility of a joint committee to
make such rulings.
' The new committee to report on
the situation will present to LASSU
their views on the system they
most favorable.
A motion was passed to send a re
quest to National Students' Associa
tion headquarters asking permission
to set up an honor system sub-com
mittee here.
Members approved final results in
the elections of Women's and Men's
Councils and Stanford Village Rep
resentative.
Last night marked the first time
LASSU has met in its new quarters
at Bowman Alumni House.

NEW MEETING PLACEâ€”The ASSU Legislature met in Bowman Alumni House lor the first time
last night. The changed meeting place was necessitated because of the new members elected
in the recent elections. The body, with full representation, is too large to meet in the ASSU Ex
com room, where past Excoms have met regularly. Permanent use of Bowman is subject to the
approval of the Alumni Association.
