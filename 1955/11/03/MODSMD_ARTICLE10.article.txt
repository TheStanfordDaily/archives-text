# DEAN CRAIG REPORTS
## ABC Said to Be Stepping Up Enforcement of Liquor Law 
### 
Office of the Dean of Students indicated yesterday that the State
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is stepping up is pro
gram of enforcing state liquor regulations.
Dean of Men William Craig said that hte ABC would probably
be cracking down on holders of liquor licenses who serve minors

in the Peninsula area.
ABC Area Administrator Frank
Fullenwider, Stanford graduate and
resident of Atherton, met with Dean
Craig yesterday morning.
Craig said they agreed that if any
cases develop which involve Stan
ford students, disciplinary action
against the students will be turned
over to the University, and thus
Men's Council.
Stanford's attitude is one of co
operation with any law enforcement
agency. Craig said, ''We will co
operate to the extent they wish us
to."
Craig added that Men's Council
should not feel that the ABC or any
other group is pushing them into a
decision.
Craig was refering to a statement
Fullenwider made earlier in the
week about the University's han
dling of the case of Jerome Jeffries,
who was suspended for the quarter
by Men's Council for violating the
Fundamental Standard at Rossotti's
Beer Garden Oct. 21.
Fullenwider had said: '"If their
| the University's | action is unsatis
factory, we will move in. Otherwise
it's in the hands of the University."
Craig indicated yesterday, that
Fullenwider seemed satisfied with
Men's Council's decision.
The ABC is the state agency with
legal authority over the administra
tion of California's liquor laws. It
was established early last year*after
California voters approved a "liquor
reform" proposition on the 1954 bal
lot.
Formerly, the powers of enforce
ment of liquor regulations were in
vested with the State Board of
Equalization (BOE).
The Department has authority to
issue and suspend licenses required
of all taverns and liquor stores in
the state and to initiate prosecution
of "youthful offenders" of liquor
regulations.
