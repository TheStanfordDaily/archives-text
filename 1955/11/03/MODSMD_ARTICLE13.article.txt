# Lamb Becomes Second Stanford Professor to Win Nobel Award
## 
### 
A 42-year-old Stanford profes
sor was named winner of the
Nobel Physics Prize yesterday,
becoming the second faculty
member in the history of the
University to be so honored.
Dr. Willis E. Lamb Jr., an expert
in electrodynamics'and atomic struc
ture, will share the prize with Co
lumbia University Professor Poly
karp Kusch.
Dr. Lamb received the award for
work in the same field in which
Stanford professor Felix Bloch did—
nuclear physics.
(Dr. Bloch won the prize in 1952
with his theory for measurement of
the magnetic properties of the neu
tron.)
The theory developed by the tall,
shy Dr. Lamb established a devia
tion from the previously accepted
Dirac formula involving the hydro
gen atom.
EXPERIMENTS
His experiments were conducted
at Columbia University beginning in
1946 and consisted of measuring with
microwaves the separation of two
levels of energy in the hydrogen
atom.
Kusch devised a very precise
means of measuring the magnetic
moment of the electron, principal
negative particle of the atom. He did
his work independently of Dr. Lamb.
Announcement of the prize win
ners came from the Swedish Acad
e-.iy of Sciences, which also named
Vincent du Vigneaud of Cornell as
recipient of the prize in chemistry.
Dr. Lamb will receive his share
of the prize ($18,360) in Stockholm,
Sweden on Dec. 10—the anniversary
of Alfred Nobel's death. Sweden's
King Gustav Adolf will make the
presentation.
A Stanford professor since 1951,
Dr. Lamb has received numerous
other scientific honors including the
Nineteenth Research Corporation
Award for Contribution to Science
(1955), the honorary degree of Doc
tor of Science from the University
of Pennsylvania (1954), election to
the National Academy of Sciences
(1954) and the Rumford Premium of
the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences (1953).
"LAMB SHIFT"
His discovery, termed the "Lamb
Shift," has paved the way for fresh
consideration of quantum electro
dynamics and an extension of its
domain of applicability. It removed
another barrier to knowledge about
the atom by providing one more im
portant clue in the search for under
standing the ultimate composition of
matter.
The Dirac theory of 1928 had ena
bled scientists to predict various
energy levels of the hydrogen atom.
This energy is believed to arise from
attractive forces between the hydro
gen atom's proton nucleus and its
single electron — forces similar to
those between the earth and the
moon.
Spectroscopic measurements of
these energy levels at first confirmed
the Dirac formula, but after a few
years the experiments of 'some in
vestigators began to show discrepan
cies.
Most physicists seemed to feel the
discrepancies were unimportant,
however, until Dr. Lamb in 1947
published a report of his direct
measurements of resonance absorp

tion by a beam of excited hydrogen
atoms.
Dr. Lamb had formed some of the
basic ideas for this work on the
atomic hydrogen spectrum in 1941,
but did not actually undertake il
until 1946.
DIRAC FORMULA
According to the Dirac formul.i
the measurement of the separation
of two levels of energy would co
incide. In fact, they did not.
As a result of Dr. Lamb's nvii, -
urements, scientists were able to
make exceedingly accurate test not
only of the physical laws for electri
cal charges, but also of any propose I
theory to account for the discrep
ancies.
Dr. Lamb performed his measun -
ments of the atomic hydrogen spec
trum while engaged in work on
microwave problems for the Otli i
of Scientific Research and Develop -
ment at the Radiation Laboraion <1
Columbia University during World
War 11.
His associate in the project \va
Robert C. Retherford, to whom Dr.
Lamb contributes a great deal ol the
success of the experiment.
WORK AT FARM
The project was continued after
the war at Columbia's Radiation
Laboratory until Dr. Lamb came to
Stanford in 1951. With his Stanford
associates, further research has been
carried on for higher energy level
of the hydrogen atom.
His Stanford associates have in
cluded T. H. Maiman, T. M. Sandet ,
Irwin Wieder and Lee Wilcox.
Dr. Lamb was born in Los An
geles, the son of an electrical en",. •
neer for the Southern California
Telephone Co.
His mother was an undergraduate
at Stanford at the time of the 1906
earthquake, and later received a
teaching degree. Both parents are
now dead.
He attended Los Angeles Hi: \
School, where he became more in
terested in chemistry than in ph; -
ics. His interested continued throi • ■!.
four years at the University of Cali
fornia, where he received a Bachelor
of Science degree in chemistry in
1934.
STUDIES AT CAL
During his undergraduate days in
chemistry, he was required to Ia It
numerous courses in physics. A a
result, he switched to the latter tud
ies and in 1938 earned the Ph.D. in
physics at Cal under Dr. J. Rob i t
Oppenheimer of atom bomb fame.
He became in instructor in phy u
at Columbia University in 1938,
where he rapidly rose to the rank
of full professor in 1948.

four years at the University of Cali
fornia, where he received a Bachelor
of Science degree in chemistry in
1934.
STUDIES AT CAL
During his undergraduate days in
chemistry, he was required to Ia It
numerous courses in physics. A a
result, he switched to the latter tud
ies and in 1938 earned the Ph.D. in
physics at Cal under Dr. J. Rob i t
Oppenheimer of atom bomb fame.
He became in instructor in phy u

A 42-year-old Stanford profes
sor was named winner of the
Nobel Physics Prize yesterday,
becoming the second faculty
member in the history of the
University to be so honored.
Dr. Willis E. Lamb Jr., an expert
in electrodynamics'and atomic struc
ture, will share the prize with Co
lumbia University Professor Poly
karp Kusch.
Dr. Lamb received the award for
work in the same field in which
Stanford professor Felix Bloch did—
nuclear physics.
(Dr. Bloch won the prize in 1952
with his theory for measurement of
the magnetic properties of the neu
tron.)
The theory developed by the tall,
shy Dr. Lamb established a devia
tion from the previously accepted
Dirac formula involving the hydro
gen atom.
EXPERIMENTS
His experiments were conducted
at Columbia University beginning in
1946 and consisted of measuring with
microwaves the separation of two
levels of energy in the hydrogen
atom.
Kusch devised a very precise
means of measuring the magnetic
moment of the electron, principal
negative particle of the atom. He did
his work independently of Dr. Lamb.
Announcement of the prize win
ners came from the Swedish Acad
e-.iy of Sciences, which also named
Vincent du Vigneaud of Cornell as
recipient of the prize in chemistry.
Dr. Lamb will receive his share
of the prize ($18,360) in Stockholm,
Sweden on Dec. 10—the anniversary
of Alfred Nobel's death. Sweden's
King Gustav Adolf will make the
presentation.
A Stanford professor since 1951,
Dr. Lamb has received numerous
other scientific honors including the
Nineteenth Research Corporation
Award for Contribution to Science
(1955), the honorary degree of Doc
tor of Science from the University
of Pennsylvania (1954), election to
the National Academy of Sciences
(1954) and the Rumford Premium of
the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences (1953).
"LAMB SHIFT"
His discovery, termed the "Lamb
Shift," has paved the way for fresh
consideration of quantum electro
dynamics and an extension of its
domain of applicability. It removed
another barrier to knowledge about
the atom by providing one more im
portant clue in the search for under
standing the ultimate composition of
matter.
The Dirac theory of 1928 had ena
bled scientists to predict various
energy levels of the hydrogen atom.
This energy is believed to arise from
attractive forces between the hydro
gen atom's proton nucleus and its
single electron — forces similar to
those between the earth and the
moon.
Spectroscopic measurements of
these energy levels at first confirmed
the Dirac formula, but after a few
years the experiments of 'some in
vestigators began to show discrepan
cies.
Most physicists seemed to feel the
discrepancies were unimportant,
however, until Dr. Lamb in 1947
published a report of his direct
measurements of resonance absorp

tion by a beam of excited hydrogen
atoms.
Dr. Lamb had formed some of the
basic ideas for this work on the
atomic hydrogen spectrum in 1941,
but did not actually undertake il
until 1946.
DIRAC FORMULA
According to the Dirac formul.i
the measurement of the separation
of two levels of energy would co
incide. In fact, they did not.
As a result of Dr. Lamb's nvii, -
urements, scientists were able to
make exceedingly accurate test not
only of the physical laws for electri
cal charges, but also of any propose I
theory to account for the discrep
ancies.

microwave problems for the Otli i

The project was continued after
the war at Columbia's Radiation

ments of the atomic hydrogen spec
trum while engaged in work on
microwave problems for the Otli i
of Scientific Research and Develop -
ment at the Radiation Laboraion <1
Columbia University during World
War 11.
His associate in the project \va
Robert C. Retherford, to whom Dr.
Lamb contributes a great deal ol the
success of the experiment.
WORK AT FARM
The project was continued after
the war at Columbia's Radiation
Laboratory until Dr. Lamb came to
Stanford in 1951. With his Stanford
associates, further research has been
carried on for higher energy level
of the hydrogen atom.
His Stanford associates have in
cluded T. H. Maiman, T. M. Sandet ,
Irwin Wieder and Lee Wilcox.
Dr. Lamb was born in Los An
geles, the son of an electrical en",. •
neer for the Southern California
Telephone Co.
His mother was an undergraduate
at Stanford at the time of the 1906
earthquake, and later received a
teaching degree. Both parents are
now dead.
He attended Los Angeles Hi: \
School, where he became more in
terested in chemistry than in ph; -
ics. His interested continued throi • ■!.
four years at the University of Cali
fornia, where he received a Bachelor
of Science degree in chemistry in
1934.
STUDIES AT CAL
During his undergraduate days in
chemistry, he was required to Ia It
numerous courses in physics. A a
result, he switched to the latter tud
ies and in 1938 earned the Ph.D. in
physics at Cal under Dr. J. Rob i t
Oppenheimer of atom bomb fame.
He became in instructor in phy u
at Columbia University in 1938,
where he rapidly rose to the rank
of full professor in 1948.
A 42-year-old Stanford profes
sor was named winner of the
Nobel Physics Prize yesterday,
becoming the second faculty
member in the history of the
University to be so honored.
Dr. Willis E. Lamb Jr., an expert
in electrodynamics'and atomic struc
ture, will share the prize with Co
lumbia University Professor Poly
karp Kusch.
Dr. Lamb received the award for
work in the same field in which
Stanford professor Felix Bloch did—
nuclear physics.
(Dr. Bloch won the prize in 1952
with his theory for measurement of
the magnetic properties of the neu
tron.)
The theory developed by the tall,
shy Dr. Lamb established a devia
tion from the previously accepted
Dirac formula involving the hydro
gen atom.
EXPERIMENTS
His experiments were conducted
at Columbia University beginning in
1946 and consisted of measuring with
microwaves the separation of two
levels of energy in the hydrogen
atom.
Kusch devised a very precise
means of measuring the magnetic
moment of the electron, principal
negative particle of the atom. He did
his work independently of Dr. Lamb.
Announcement of the prize win
ners came from the Swedish Acad
e-.iy of Sciences, which also named
Vincent du Vigneaud of Cornell as
recipient of the prize in chemistry.
Dr. Lamb will receive his share
of the prize ($18,360) in Stockholm,
Sweden on Dec. 10—the anniversary
of Alfred Nobel's death. Sweden's
King Gustav Adolf will make the
presentation.
A Stanford professor since 1951,
Dr. Lamb has received numerous
other scientific honors including the
Nineteenth Research Corporation
Award for Contribution to Science
(1955), the honorary degree of Doc
tor of Science from the University
of Pennsylvania (1954), election to
the National Academy of Sciences
(1954) and the Rumford Premium of
the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences (1953).
"LAMB SHIFT"
His discovery, termed the "Lamb
Shift," has paved the way for fresh
consideration of quantum electro
dynamics and an extension of its
domain of applicability. It removed
another barrier to knowledge about
the atom by providing one more im
portant clue in the search for under
standing the ultimate composition of
matter.
The Dirac theory of 1928 had ena
bled scientists to predict various
energy levels of the hydrogen atom.
This energy is believed to arise from
attractive forces between the hydro
gen atom's proton nucleus and its
single electron — forces similar to
those between the earth and the
moon.
Spectroscopic measurements of
these energy levels at first confirmed
the Dirac formula, but after a few
years the experiments of 'some in
vestigators began to show discrepan
cies.
Most physicists seemed to feel the
discrepancies were unimportant,
however, until Dr. Lamb in 1947
published a report of his direct
measurements of resonance absorp

tion by a beam of excited hydrogen
atoms.
Dr. Lamb had formed some of the
basic ideas for this work on the
atomic hydrogen spectrum in 1941,
but did not actually undertake il
until 1946.
DIRAC FORMULA
According to the Dirac formul.i
the measurement of the separation
of two levels of energy would co
incide. In fact, they did not.
As a result of Dr. Lamb's nvii, -
urements, scientists were able to
make exceedingly accurate test not
only of the physical laws for electri
cal charges, but also of any propose I
theory to account for the discrep
ancies.
