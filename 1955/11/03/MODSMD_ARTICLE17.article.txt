Which quarter do you think rushing should
be held—winter or spring?
In order to focus attention on this important
campus question, which particularly involves
all the men of the freshman class, The Daily
interviewed 14 students who previously had
been involved with rushing.
Monday night the pro and cons of both win
ter and spring quarter will be given at a discus
sion to be held in Cubberley Auditorium.
On Monday, Nov. 14, all club and fraternity
men will have a chance to vote on the issue.
Comments of those interviewed who were in
favor of winter quarter rushing are:
John Whalen, '56, Delta Tau Delia: "Since
there are as many reasons which support
spring quarter rushing as there seem to be
against it, Lam in favor of leaving rushing dur
ing winter quarter. Less emphasis should be
put on rushing and less pressure put on the
rushees."
Jim Messinger, '58, Alpha Sigma Phi: "Adop
tion of spring quarter rushing would reduce
sharply the essential period of integration be
tween the pledge class and the fraternity as
well as among the (pledge class) members."
Boh Hubhs, '57, Tigre: "Too many things are
going on in the spring. There's less pressure
on everyone in the winter."
Alan Wayte, '58, Delta Chi: "Winter quarter
rushing would give an opportunity for more
freshmen to join fraternities and clubs. I don't
think a spring rushing program will do any
thing but prolong this waiting."
Roger Carlisle, '58, independent: "Students
need spring quarter to catch up on their
studies. Also, if rushing were held in the
spring, it would conflict with the social calen
dar."
Dick Reyna, '56, Alpha Sig: "You can't expect
to enforce the no contact rule until spring; it's
hard enough for one quarter."
Walt Hays, '57, Theta Xi: "Being a fraternity
pledge doesn't interfere with studies as much
as some people claim. Our's will probably be
spring quarter anyway."
Bob Sprinkel, '56, independent: "Spring quar
ter rushing would put hardships on my friends
who like to go to the beach in spring quarter."
Comments in favor of spring quarter rushing:
Jack Pike, '56, Alpha Delta Phi: "Spring quar

ter rushing should be given an opportunity to
prove itself for one year and then either be
used or dismissed for good on its own merits.;
I would like to see spring quarter rushing put
011 trial."
Jack Grout, '57, Beta Theta Pi: "Since Stanford -
is more of a school of education than a social •
institution, I believe that rushing should be i
held in spring quarter. The emphasis for the
first two quarters then could be on learning
how to study and when to study. Rushing, then,
v/ould fit into a freshmen schedule with a little
more ease."
Joe Van de Water, '56, Los Arcos: "I believe
that it would be to She general benefit of every
one to postpone rushing until spring quarter. 1
This belief is based on Ihe results of the poll 1
taken among freshman men last year in which
they were in favor of waiting until spring quar
ter to begin rushing."
Bill Lund, '57, Sigma Chi: "Spring quarter
rushing will benefit ihe student by giving him j
a belter orientation to college life. The frosh I
would like to gel to know each other, and I can't j
see that class unity will hurt the fraternities."
Dwiqht Clark, '57, independent: "Spring!
quarter rushing means that there are two quar
ters—not one -in which to build a solid class
rpirit without dividing loyallies between class
and club or house."
Harv Christens-,en, '56, sponsor at Wilbur: "It
is obviously much too late in the year to 1
change the rushing plans for this year. I be
lieve it would be advantageous to try spring
quarter rushing next year."
For the University's point of view, The Daily
contacted Assistant Dean of Men Robert P.
Huff.
Huff said "The decision as to whether the
rushing of freshmen should take place in the
winter or spring quarter must be made by the
fraternities and eating clubs themselves."
He continued that any statement of prefer
ence made by him would "most certainly preju
dice the objective consideration" of the ques
tion.
"I am confident," Huff added, "that the clubs
and fraternities, in making this decision, will
bear in mind the welfare of the freshmen and
the University as well as themselves."

John Whalen, '56, Delta Tau Delia: "Since
there are as many reasons which support
spring quarter rushing as there seem to be
against it, Lam in favor of leaving rushing dur
ing winter quarter. Less emphasis should be
put on rushing and less pressure put on the
rushees."
Jim Messinger, '58, Alpha Sigma Phi: "Adop
tion of spring quarter rushing would reduce
sharply the essential period of integration be
tween the pledge class and the fraternity as
well as among the (pledge class) members."
Boh Hubhs, '57, Tigre: "Too many things are
going on in the spring. There's less pressure
on everyone in the winter."
Alan Wayte, '58, Delta Chi: "Winter quarter
rushing would give an opportunity for more
freshmen to join fraternities and clubs. I don't
think a spring rushing program will do any
thing but prolong this waiting."
Roger Carlisle, '58, independent: "Students
need spring quarter to catch up on their
studies. Also, if rushing were held in the
spring, it would conflict with the social calen
dar."
Dick Reyna, '56, Alpha Sig: "You can't expect
to enforce the no contact rule until spring; it's
hard enough for one quarter."
Walt Hays, '57, Theta Xi: "Being a fraternity
pledge doesn't interfere with studies as much
as some people claim. Our's will probably be
spring quarter anyway."
Bob Sprinkel, '56, independent: "Spring quar
ter rushing would put hardships on my friends
who like to go to the beach in spring quarter."
Comments in favor of spring quarter rushing:
Jack Pike, '56, Alpha Delta Phi: "Spring quar

ter rushing should be given an opportunity to
prove itself for one year and then either be
used or dismissed for good on its own merits.;
I would like to see spring quarter rushing put
011 trial."
Jack Grout, '57, Beta Theta Pi: "Since Stanford -
is more of a school of education than a social •
institution, I believe that rushing should be i
held in spring quarter. The emphasis for the
first two quarters then could be on learning
how to study and when to study. Rushing, then,
v/ould fit into a freshmen schedule with a little
more ease."
Joe Van de Water, '56, Los Arcos: "I believe
that it would be to She general benefit of every
one to postpone rushing until spring quarter. 1
This belief is based on Ihe results of the poll 1
taken among freshman men last year in which
they were in favor of waiting until spring quar
ter to begin rushing."
Bill Lund, '57, Sigma Chi: "Spring quarter
rushing will benefit ihe student by giving him j
a belter orientation to college life. The frosh I
would like to gel to know each other, and I can't j
see that class unity will hurt the fraternities."
Dwiqht Clark, '57, independent: "Spring!
quarter rushing means that there are two quar
ters—not one -in which to build a solid class
rpirit without dividing loyallies between class
and club or house."
Harv Christens-,en, '56, sponsor at Wilbur: "It
is obviously much too late in the year to 1
change the rushing plans for this year. I be
lieve it would be advantageous to try spring
quarter rushing next year."
For the University's point of view, The Daily
contacted Assistant Dean of Men Robert P.
Huff.
Huff said "The decision as to whether the
rushing of freshmen should take place in the
winter or spring quarter must be made by the
fraternities and eating clubs themselves."
He continued that any statement of prefer
ence made by him would "most certainly preju
dice the objective consideration" of the ques
tion.
"I am confident," Huff added, "that the clubs
and fraternities, in making this decision, will
bear in mind the welfare of the freshmen and
the University as well as themselves."
What do you think?
Which quarter do you think rushing should
be held—winter or spring?
In order to focus attention on this important
campus question, which particularly involves
all the men of the freshman class, The Daily
interviewed 14 students who previously had
been involved with rushing.
Monday night the pro and cons of both win
ter and spring quarter will be given at a discus
sion to be held in Cubberley Auditorium.
On Monday, Nov. 14, all club and fraternity
men will have a chance to vote on the issue.

going on in the spring. There's less pressure
on everyone in the winter."
Alan Wayte, '58, Delta Chi: "Winter quarter
rushing would give an opportunity for more
freshmen to join fraternities and clubs. I don't
think a spring rushing program will do any
thing but prolong this waiting."
Roger Carlisle, '58, independent: "Students
need spring quarter to catch up on their
studies. Also, if rushing were held in the
spring, it would conflict with the social calen
dar."
Dick Reyna, '56, Alpha Sig: "You can't expect
to enforce the no contact rule until spring; it's
hard enough for one quarter."
Walt Hays, '57, Theta Xi: "Being a fraternity
pledge doesn't interfere with studies as much
as some people claim. Our's will probably be
spring quarter anyway."
Bob Sprinkel, '56, independent: "Spring quar
ter rushing would put hardships on my friends
who like to go to the beach in spring quarter."
Comments in favor of spring quarter rushing:
Jack Pike, '56, Alpha Delta Phi: "Spring quar

ter rushing should be given an opportunity to
prove itself for one year and then either be
used or dismissed for good on its own merits.;
I would like to see spring quarter rushing put
011 trial."
Jack Grout, '57, Beta Theta Pi: "Since Stanford -
is more of a school of education than a social •
institution, I believe that rushing should be i
held in spring quarter. The emphasis for the
first two quarters then could be on learning
how to study and when to study. Rushing, then,
v/ould fit into a freshmen schedule with a little
more ease."
Joe Van de Water, '56, Los Arcos: "I believe
that it would be to She general benefit of every
one to postpone rushing until spring quarter. 1
This belief is based on Ihe results of the poll 1
taken among freshman men last year in which
they were in favor of waiting until spring quar
ter to begin rushing."
Bill Lund, '57, Sigma Chi: "Spring quarter
rushing will benefit ihe student by giving him j
a belter orientation to college life. The frosh I
would like to gel to know each other, and I can't j
see that class unity will hurt the fraternities."
Dwiqht Clark, '57, independent: "Spring!
quarter rushing means that there are two quar
ters—not one -in which to build a solid class
rpirit without dividing loyallies between class
and club or house."
Harv Christens-,en, '56, sponsor at Wilbur: "It
is obviously much too late in the year to 1
change the rushing plans for this year. I be
lieve it would be advantageous to try spring
quarter rushing next year."
For the University's point of view, The Daily
contacted Assistant Dean of Men Robert P.
Huff.
Huff said "The decision as to whether the
rushing of freshmen should take place in the
winter or spring quarter must be made by the
fraternities and eating clubs themselves."
He continued that any statement of prefer
ence made by him would "most certainly preju
dice the objective consideration" of the ques
tion.
"I am confident," Huff added, "that the clubs
and fraternities, in making this decision, will
bear in mind the welfare of the freshmen and
the University as well as themselves."
