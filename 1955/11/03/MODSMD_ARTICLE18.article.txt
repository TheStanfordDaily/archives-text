snide giggles
To the Editor:
This letter comes from a member of the unenlight
ened minority who do not applaud Earl Cilley's weekly
attempts to manufacture laughs out of worthwhile
campus events.
The good-natured "razzing" and "friendly fun" so
heartily enjoyed by the editors seems to those of us
with a less highly-developed sense of humor to degen
erate into snide giggles and uncalled-for sarcasm. Mr.
Cillcy, who obviously considers himself enough of an
all-around expert to pass judgment on lectures, plays
and social receptions, to mention but a few of the
events which have gained notoriety in his columns, is
evidently at a loss to devise a more tasteful way to
entertain his. readers.
To return to the pat on the back given Mr. Cilley
yesterday by the editors, it has been my impression
that such an "editor's note" is usually reserved for
corrections of factual error. The column in which this
letter appears is headed "Campus Opinion." Mutual
appreciation on the part of the Daily staff is not ap
propriate under this heading.

(Editor's note: We had a phone call this morning
fiun a woman praising the column; she said she
found no sarcasm at all. However, you may be sure
that Mr. Cillcy will do his (test to entertain those
who have found his column unsatisfactory while at
the same time maintaining his current following.
(Now, about editor's notes: Certainly, they are
used for factual clarification. But when Daily policy
is questioned in a letter, it is only fitting to clarify
that also. When a complete editorial is not needed,
v hat is a better place to run that statement than
directly below the letter?)
does it work?
To the Editor: .
The Fundamental Standard is supposed to influence
the conduct ol' all Stanford students at all times. This
includes students who hit parked cars when there are
no witnesses in the vicinity.
Is this standard in effect on this campus? If it is.
are we going to live by it? Fundamental Standard

or not, any human being should have the common !
decency to accept his responsibility for a liable acci
dent.

We would like to make a suggestion to the Stanford
yell leaders concerning the particular yell "Make That
Kick." This yell has been used at football games for
fourth-down punts, which certainly implies a negative
attitude toward the team's ability to complete such a
kick. Few. if any, college teams are unable to complete
a normal punt.
Granted, this "yell might be appropriate for a long
field goal or important try-for-point, but hardly for
a kick which is 99 per cent routine. Just a suggestion
which we hope will b" acted upon.

To the Editor:
In Tuesday's sports .column, "Backtalk," Larry Jen
sen stated that Oregon State never has finished second
in the Pacific Coast Conference in football. This may
be true, but I feel that it leaves the reader with the
idea that OSC therefore has never won the conference
championship either. This is not true.
As an Oregon State alum, I would like to point out
that the Beavers represented the PCC in the trans
planted Rose Bowl game against Duke in 1942.
One other thing that is irritating to a Northwest
erner is the fact that it is never mentioned that Oregon
State could go to the Rose Bowl next New Year's Day.
Jensen does mention that if Oregon State wins the rest 1
of its game-;, which are relatively easy ones, and if
Southern Cal defeats UCLA, then G'SC would have a
(!-l record while UCLA would have a 5-1 record.
Is it to be assumed that Californians just take for
granted that the Cal schools, with the aid of rebel
Washington, will vote against a Northwest school
going to the Rose Bowl just as they, did in 1948 when
Oregon tied California for the league championship ;
and Cal was sent to the Rose Bowl after a vote of the i
conference schools?

Jensen does mention that if Oregon State wins the rest 1
of its game-;, which are relatively easy ones, and if
Southern Cal defeats UCLA, then G'SC would have a

Is it to be assumed that Californians just take for

Washington, will vote against a Northwest school
going to the Rose Bowl just as they, did in 1948 when
Oregon tied California for the league championship ;
and Cal was sent to the Rose Bowl after a vote of the i

This letter comes from a member of the unenlight
ened minority who do not applaud Earl Cilley's weekly
attempts to manufacture laughs out of worthwhile
campus events.
The good-natured "razzing" and "friendly fun" so
heartily enjoyed by the editors seems to those of us
with a less highly-developed sense of humor to degen
erate into snide giggles and uncalled-for sarcasm. Mr.
Cillcy, who obviously considers himself enough of an
all-around expert to pass judgment on lectures, plays
and social receptions, to mention but a few of the
events which have gained notoriety in his columns, is
evidently at a loss to devise a more tasteful way to
entertain his. readers.
To return to the pat on the back given Mr. Cilley
yesterday by the editors, it has been my impression
that such an "editor's note" is usually reserved for
corrections of factual error. The column in which this
letter appears is headed "Campus Opinion." Mutual
appreciation on the part of the Daily staff is not ap
propriate under this heading.

We would like to make a suggestion to the Stanford
yell leaders concerning the particular yell "Make That
Kick." This yell has been used at football games for
fourth-down punts, which certainly implies a negative
attitude toward the team's ability to complete such a
kick. Few. if any, college teams are unable to complete
a normal punt.
Granted, this "yell might be appropriate for a long
field goal or important try-for-point, but hardly for
a kick which is 99 per cent routine. Just a suggestion
which we hope will b" acted upon.
