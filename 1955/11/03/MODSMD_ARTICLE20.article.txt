# BERLIN STUDENT
## Graduate Describes East-West Contrast Apparent in Berlin 
### DOROTHY CAMPBELL 
Berlin is a unique city because
there one can see the contrast
between a Communist govern
ment and a democratic one, de
clares Jim Rossier, now a grad
uate student here after a year at
the Free University of Berlin.
Rossier, who received the Ph.D.
degree in English, was awarded the
annual scholarship to the Free Uni
versity. The scholarship is awarded
by the Berlin Affiliations Committee,
u group that exchanges both stu
dents and ideas with Stanford.
The Free University is a refuge
for students from Eastern Germany
who wish to escape Communist
dogma.
EASTERN TEXTBOOKS
'"When I went to universities in
East Berlin, I was not permitted to
attend classes. I even had to get a
special permit to look in their li
brary," hs stated.
''Most interesting were the books
they didn't have," he continued.
"None of the old German histories
were available. Only recent ones by
East German professors were avail
able.
"Since all were communistic, many
important post - war works were
missing," Rossier noted.
STUDENTS OPPOSE ARMS
'"The students are interested in
every aspect of politics; they have
an opinion on every topic," he com
mented. "Newspaper accounts of
current events are followed day by
day."
In general German students are
opposed to rearmament. Many were
forced into Hitler's youth army near
the end of World War 11.
Then they were imprisoned for
these activities by the Allies. They
now feel that for Germany's sake it
must not happen again.
"In West Berlin one can see plainly
the evidence of American products,
cosmopolitan atmosphere and free
trade," Rossier said.
"Experiencing the difference bo

twcen this and East Berlin means
much more than merely theorizing
about the differences in the two
forms of government.
COMFORTABLE LIVING
"In the East are found poor hous
ing, remnants of rubble, high price-,
long hours of work. West Berlin is
a fashion center, has comfortable
living condition; and industryâ€” it's a
different world."
Governments of sectors en
courage cultural achievement. Each
sector is a showpiece for it's own
type of culture; and each tries to
outdo the other.
For example, Fast Berlin excels in
opera, West Berlin in orchestral
music.
Many visitors to the Free Univer
sity have spoken in favor of Western
democracy, Rossier said. Among
these have been Clement Atlee, Ar
thur Koestler, James Bryant Conant
and Arnold Toynbee.
PROPOGANDA RIVALRY
Propogancla methods in the two
sectors also differ. West Berlin sells
tickets to East EUnliners at reduced
prices tc see the products of the free
world.
East Berlin authorities wave flags,

use "hate" broadcasts and criticize
the Bonn government.
Rossier lived with foreign students
from France, Denmark, Norway, Yu
goslavia and England. By speaking
before German groups and attending
classes with them, he feels he got to
know the people.
Colored slides of West Berlin and
of the Communist May Day celebra
tions will be shown by Rossier at
8 p.m. Monday in els, Cubberley.
He will also comment on the pic
tures.
