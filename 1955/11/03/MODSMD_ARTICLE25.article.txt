From far-flung corners of Quad,
professors are saying:
Hubert R. Marshall, assistant pro
fessor of political science, on traffic
problems: "No one in his right mind
| tries to drive on Manhattan Island—
though hundreds of thousands do it
j every day."
Joac hi m Remak, instructor of
Western Civilizations, on whether
; infants at birth recollected events
before their birth: "Frederick II
tried an experiment. He took two
] new-born children and isolated them
from people to talk to them to see if
' they would speak any language. It
was an example of an ancient shaggy
j dog story."
Thomas Bailey on various subjects
in American history:
On digging of Panama Canal —
"Roosevelt made the dirt fly. More
kinds of dirt than he had antici
pated."
On protective tariffs—"The infant
industries were gigantic trusts with
bulging muscles."
On mid-term—"l do not believe in
people learning twice details they'll
forget anyway."
"Our painters had to go to Europe
to find people who had time to sit
still for portraits. Americans are in
clined to sit still for mass spectator
sports."
On forcible military induction for
the British army or navy—"Horizon
tally or perpendicularly they were
inducted into the army."
On ending of war in 1812—"We

of falling trees and Indians." ,
