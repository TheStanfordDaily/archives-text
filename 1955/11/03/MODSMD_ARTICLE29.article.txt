## 
### DAVE CANFIELD 
Unveiling a star southpaw passer, a :9.9 dash man, a lightning- !
like pass swiper, and a 50-yard punter, Breakers I broke El Cuadro

For Breakers, Wally Weissman spiraled three touchdown passes
and Mickey Holzman took one of them 71 yards to pay dirt. And

| vv i I h Zan Schleuning intercepting"
I four passes and Bob Webster getting
off two 50-yard punts, Breakers'
j jaugernaut rolled on undefeated.
CUADRO MARCHES
Breakers would have been scored
i against on the first series of plays
; if not for the "breaks." El Caudro
marched right down to the Breaker
j 10-yard line. Here Caudro lost the
j ball on downs when the pass from
center sailed five feet over tailback
Ben Stevens head.
However, as Breakers started
marching down the field, Stevens
came out of nowhere to intercept
a Breaker pass on his own 40. He
peddled it back 25 quick yards to
the Breaker 35.
Stevens continued to spark the
way, moving the ball to the 9-yard
mark on a series of pistol-shot passes
to stepladder-like end Rich Bray,
j Then El Caudro lost the ball on
j downs.
On Breakers' first play, Weissman
tossed a short fiat pass to Holzman,
who in high school reeled of a 9.9
100. Holzman pulled in the ball on
the Breaker 20 and took off. A key
block by Don Dußois on the 30 took
out the last man and sprung Holz
man loose, 71 yards for a touchdown.
Soon after this punt, Schluening

| swiped a Stevens pass on the El
Cuadro 30 and ran it back 10 yards
to set up another quick score. For
' the touchdown, Weissman hit
Schleuning with a 14-yard aerial.
The extra point was good, with
Weissman firing to Allen Panton.
No sooner had Cuadro gotten the
ball again but Zan the Man stole
another pass and set up another
march. • Stabbing the ball on the
losers' 40. Schleuning sped to the 35-
yard stripe. Then Weissman took
over, arching a beautiful 35-yarder
to Holzman in the clear in the end
zone. The extra point was no good, j
Three plays later, Schleuning
struck again. Stealing a pass on the
Cuadro 40, the slippery Schleuning
slithered 20 yards to the 20 and on \
the next play pitched to Dußoi.s for
the touchdown. Dußoi.s made a spec- I
tacular diving catch. Weissman shot
a quick pass to Turner Schley for
the extra point to make the final
score 26-0.

ped Phi Kap I, 12-0; KA II scored

CUADRO MARCHES
Breakers would have been scored
i against on the first series of plays
; if not for the "breaks." El Caudro
marched right down to the Breaker
j 10-yard line. Here Caudro lost the
j ball on downs when the pass from
center sailed five feet over tailback
Ben Stevens head.

marching down the field, Stevens
came out of nowhere to intercept
a Breaker pass on his own 40. He
peddled it back 25 quick yards to
the Breaker 35.
Stevens continued to spark the
way, moving the ball to the 9-yard
mark on a series of pistol-shot passes
to stepladder-like end Rich Bray,
j Then El Caudro lost the ball on
j downs.
On Breakers' first play, Weissman
tossed a short fiat pass to Holzman,
who in high school reeled of a 9.9
100. Holzman pulled in the ball on
the Breaker 20 and took off. A key
block by Don Dußois on the 30 took
out the last man and sprung Holz
man loose, 71 yards for a touchdown.
Soon after this punt, Schluening

Cuadro 30 and ran it back 10 yards
to set up another quick score. For
' the touchdown, Weissman hit
Schleuning with a 14-yard aerial.

ball again but Zan the Man stole
another pass and set up another
march. • Stabbing the ball on the
