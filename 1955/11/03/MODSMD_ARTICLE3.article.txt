## West Turns Down Russian 'All-German Council' Plan 
### 
GENEVA, Nov. 2 (UP) â€”Russia proposed today an "All-German
Council" to represent a divided Germany. The West turned down
the plan with a warning that without German unification, there
can be no settlement of the cold war.
Soviet Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov, under pressure to come

up with a yes or no answer to West
ern demands for immediate unifica
tion, offered a four-part program
that would establish a council from
the East and West German parlia
ments.
The four-point plan called for:
1. A council composed of members
of West and East German parlia
ments to discuss matters of common
interest.
2. Mixed committees to discuss
economic and cultural ties.
3. Agreement by the council on
the size of reduced armed forces.
4. Agreement by the council on
participation of the two Germanys
in "measures designed to consolidate
European security."
