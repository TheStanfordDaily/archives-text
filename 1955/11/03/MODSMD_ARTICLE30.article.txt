# Card Gridders Practice For Trojan Battle
## 
### 
The ever-present flu k*rg struck
again today, as Donn Carswell was
sidelined from practice. It hoped
that the 200-pound junior would be
ready for the Southern Cal game
this coming Saturday.
The only other player who was
sidelined was Lou Valli, whose re
current knee injury will keep him
out of action for two weeks. It is
possible that Valli will be ready for
the Big Game with California, how
ever.
A note of brightness was sounded,
as sophomore fullback Jeri McMillin
returned to the Indian fold. McMil
lin has been out because of the
death of his sister.
Gordy Young will start at left half
at the Coliseum in place of McMil
lin. Coach Chuck Taylor said McMil
lin will see action Saturday, although
he won't start.
The pigskinners worked tod a y
mainly on pass defense. Practice on
offensive pass patterns also occupied
the session.
