# Ducks Drill Defense
## 
### 
EUGENE, Ore., Nov. 2 (U.R)—The
Oregon Ducks spent most ol' their
practice session today working on
pass defense—possibly out of respect
for the passing arm of Washington
State's Bob Iverson.
The Webfoots, who meet the Cou
gar;. next Saturday at Pullman,
seemed to be concerned with the
fact that three Idaho quarterbacks
tossed for 173 yards' against them
last Saturday. That, plus the fact
that Iverson connected for 1(57 yards,
even though the Cougars suffered a
30-0 defeat.
