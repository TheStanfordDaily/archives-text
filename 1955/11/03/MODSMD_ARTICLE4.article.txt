# Faure Receives Confidence Vote
## 
### 
The French National Assembly
today approved Prem ie r Edgar
Faure's bid for early elections aimed
at saving his shaky government fjom
collapse.
It was Faure's fourth vote of con
fidence victory in four weeks and it
saved both his government and
France's voice at the Big Four Ge
neva Conference.
The vote was 330-211, a .surpris
ingly strong majority for the pre
mier, who narrowly missed being
ousted three times recently. The 94
Communist deputies threw their
votes to Faure just a few hours be
fore the ballot. This move virtually
assured him of victory .
The Communists swung the debate
in Faure's favor when they an
nounced they would support his mo
tion.
