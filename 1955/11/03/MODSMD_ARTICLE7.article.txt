# FOR WORK IN ELECTRODYNAMICS
## University Physicist Lamb Wins $18,000 Nobel Award for 1955 Modest Physicist Pays Tribute To Assistant's Work 
### JIM PALMER 
The winner of the 1955 Nobel
Physics Prize walked shyly into
a small office where a handful
of reporters and* photographers
waited to pounce on him with
questions and flash bulbs.
Outside, newsreel cameramen were
waiting to capture for the theater
goer the man who had answered an
$18,000 question in electrodynamics.
Dr. Willis E. Lamb sat down and
started talking.
"I got an idea that a certain ex
periment might be done. ... I think
it came while I was teaching during
the summer of 1945 at Columbia."
The idea led to an experiment in
1946, he continued. "I persuaded an
assistant, Robert C. Retherford, to do
all the mechanical work. . . . I'm
very clumsy with my hands.
"The experiment would very like
ly not have worked without Rether
ford. I would have no complaint to
split the prize with him," he added
modestly.
"It was a bold, theoretical step,
not easy to take," he surmised as he
discussed the project.
"As we know it today, the electron
interacts with the rest of the world—
and the world is a very complicated
place. Even empty space has prop
erties.
"A single electron is really a very
complicated environment."
The meaning of his experiment?
"It doesn't mean anything very
practical. ... It will help the theo
retical physicist to understand more."
The news that this project, begun
nearly 10 years ago, had won him
the famed prize came at 5 in the
morning, he said.
"I was a little sleepy at the time
when United Press called to tell me
the news. ... I went back to bed for
three-quarters of an hour after
wards."
His wife Ursula, who has written
a book soon to be published on the
life of a Spanish explorer, expressed
"great happiness and appreciation."
Turning to the prize money—his
share is one-half of $36,720 — Dr.
Lamb guessed he would "hold onto j
it lor a while" after he receives it i
on Dec. 10 in Stockholm.
The greying professor i6 an ama
teur sailor and swimmer, but said he
didn't find time for these activities
at Stanford. "I m too busy," he con- !
fessed.
After the press conference came
to an end and the newsreels had
taken their pictures, Dr. Lamb went
back to his tasks in a physics lab,
taking in stride the honor which had
come his way in the early hours of
the morning.

NOBEL WINNER—Dr. Willis E. Lamb Jr., who will share the
$36,720 Nobel Physics Prize with a Columbia University pro
fessor, sits in a physics laboratory on Quad. He was the second
Stanford faculty member to win the honor.
