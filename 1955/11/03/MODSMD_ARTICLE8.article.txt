# Stanford, Cal To Negotiate Big Game Pact
## 
### 
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler and ASSU president George
Ralph will travel to Berkeley today
to discuss the annual "Big Game
Agreement" or "non-aggression pact"
that Stanford traditionally makes
with the University of California.
Winbigler and Ralph will meet
with the University of California
Dean of Students Hurford E. Stone
and Student Body President Robert
Hamilton.
The primary purpose of today's
meeting, according to the Dean, is
to formulate a text for the agree
ment. However, he added that there
is a "possibility that we may also
sign it today."
Last year's pact stated that there
would be no raids by members of
either student body upon the other
campus and that anyone taking part
in such a raid would be subject t<>
"severe discipline."
The agreement also stated that
the term "raid" would include drop
ping leaflets or other material from
aircraft and that each student body
would attempt to educate its mem
bers regarding the spirit of the
agreement.
