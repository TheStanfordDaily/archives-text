No. I—Econ Made Simple
1. Supply — Kepler sells books (the inexpensive paper-bounds),
art prints, and studio cards.
2. Incentive—Kepler knows that man doesn't live by bread alone,
but he (and the little Keplers) do like to eat.
3. Demand — You read books (if required to do so), enjoy art,
and startle your friends with fantastic studio cards.
4. Free Market — Kepler wants to sell you his books, prints and
cards — but so do all other booksellers.
Hence ...
5. Advertising—Kepler prostitutes himself and the arts in order
6. Consumption —to sell to you
And that, students, is BUSINESS.
• TO SUM UP •
What helps Kepler helps business, and what helps Kepler's
business helps Kepler.
And, you ask, what about you?
WELL, YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO HELP YOURSELVES . . .
THAT'S FREE ENTERPRISE!
