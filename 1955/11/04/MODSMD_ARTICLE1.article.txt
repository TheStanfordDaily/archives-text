Going South?
Then you will want to know
the facts provided in The Daily's
Pocket Travel Gufde for The
Northern California Emigrant,
herein quoted fully.
Proceeding from a flowering fron
tispiece, describing Los Angeles as
"Seven Suburbs Searching for a Me
tropolis," a detailed description of
Life in the Southland is furnished
the rooter-commuter.
Los Angeles, home of Smogville
College, is a place of many delights
for the tourist (so the travel booklet
says).
Here we find the species Holly
woou'ia in its native habitat. Here
also is the rarified atmosphere com
posed of many parts ozone which
pleases the T-zone.
To the wandering traveler, Los
Angeles is a land of curious byways
on which it is possible to motor for
hours around magnificent curves,
under overpasses and over under
passes without achieving any desti
nation.
SPORTS THRILLS
Here also are special thrills for the
sports fan, what with two top-rank
ing schools located within the sub
urbial limits.
Near enchanting Figueroa Street,
lined with graceful traffic lights, is
found a 75-year-old institution
known as SC—we call it Smogville
College.
Nestled at the foot of a sweeping
freeway, Smogville College "pre
serves the atmosphere of a small
rural college" in the midst of the
city, according to publicity releases.
This quaint spot is located but a
stone's throw from a great athletic
arena, formerly known as the Coli
seum. now casually referred to as
either "Tsagalikas Tstadium" or
"The House that Harvey Built."
TKOYBOYS
Here on alternate week ends are
fielded the Smogville College Troy
boys and their rivals from across
the congested city, the Factory Ex
tension School Brownies.
After an afternoon of football, or
as they call it down there You Bet
Your Scholarship, the students (for
want of a better monicker) go out
tor a night on the town — er, the
suburbs.
Where to go? This is a difficult
question since there are so many hot
.spots within the area.
La Cienega Boulevard affords the
hearty appetite a pleasant repast at
such places as The Tail of the Cock,
House of Murphy, The Captain's
Table, Lowry's and others.
HIGHER PRICES
The higher price establishments,
such as Giro's, are there too. Those
on a limited budget may wish a
touch ol the Moulin Rouge—a most
inexpensive touch at that.
The evening having progressed, it
is time for that night ride up Mul
holland Drive, where they are heav
ily parked on Saturday. The view of
the suburbs is superb from here,
the lights twinkling up through a
layer of, ah, ozone.
Back down in a short while for a
drive through the city itself—and
then home. This is a week-end night
for the social cats.
That special date is reserved for
the Palladium or the Cocoanut Grove
—and maybe once, just once, a trip
to the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
Here one finds the utmost in lav
ishness—and price.
This is Los Angeles—the City of
ihe Angels, Land of the Freeways
and home of Smogville College.
