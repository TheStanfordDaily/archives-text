# Consul Says Unification Is Germany's Biggest Problem

### WALLY SIMPSON 
The biggest problem facing Ger
many at this time, according to Dr.
Erhardt Hesse, German Consul in
San Francisco, is unification.
Speaking in the second of the
series of political talks, sponsored
by the Consular Committee of the [
Institute of International Relations I
yesterday, Dr. Hesse said that the
large external problems such as Uni
fication with East Germany and West
European Community are problems
that must be largely settled by the j
Powers represented at the Potsdam
Conference.
NO MEETING
West Germany, according to Dr.
Hesse, will not sit down with East
Germany and integrate certain parts
of government for the sake of comity
because the German people remem
ber what happened to Czechoslo
vakia. It would be difficult to pre
vent the East German communist
government with a power of veto
from usurping or overpowering the
West German democratic govern
ment.
Dr. Hesse said that there is a pos
sibility that East Germany may be
sacrificed by the communist bloc na
tions. East Germany may be turned
over to West Germany without any
elections because Russia feels that
the outcome of free elections may
prove embarrassing to the commu- J
nists and set up repercussions in '

Poland and other communist domi
nated nations.
Touching on the results of the
Saar vote, Dr. Hesse maintained that
the vote outcome is not an indication
of a resurgence of German national
ism.
He believes, and he cited the re
sults of opinion polls taken in that
area, that should the question of a
United Europe be placed before the
Saar peoples they would favor it.
Most Germans, he said, are in favor
of a United Europe.
DOMESTIC PROBLEMS
Germany's greatest domestic prob
lems have been largely settled, ac
cording to Dr. Hesse. The country is
presently in the state of an economic
boom. Labor in Germany is cur
rently in the process of making a
transition from a 48-hour to a 40-
hour week.
The political refugee and immigra
tion situation, said Dr. Hesse, has
also been largely taken care of. Most
of these people are now settled and
employed.
