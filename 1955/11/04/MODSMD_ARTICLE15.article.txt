# out of our hands

### 
Big Game Gaieties is being taken out of the
Stanford students' hands. The annual produc
tion is still being done "for the students,'' but
not "by the students." At least not entirely by
Stanford students.
Gaieties has deteriorated into more of a Stan
ford spectator shew than a Stanford participa
tion show. Production directors condone this
.situation. They freely admit to the use of out
.r idtf talent saying, "Competition | for Gaieties
parts | has been open to anyone . . . who of
fered talent to our productions."
This admission shows a purpose contrary to
the real purpose of University activities. That
purpose being to provide an outlei for Stanford
talent as well as to provide relaxation and enter
tainnie. t for Stanford students.
They refer to this year's production as, "Stan
ford's greatest Big Game Gaieties." Yet a cast
member and writer of seven' numbers is from
San Jose State College. They say that since this
autumn's show is "extremely big and the num
ber of students trying out (even if as large a
proportion as one out two were suitable for

parts) was insufficient to cast the production."
All this boils down to is that a Stanford show
is being put on with use of non-Stanford talent.
Ram's Head owes its very existence to the
Stanford student body yel finds some of its tal
ent outside that body. Perhaps the fault for this
lies not only with Rarn's Head but also with
Stanford students. Their supporting body is
certainly capable of producing sufficient talent
for any top-flight university production.
Past Ram's Head shows have shown that this
talent is available here. Outside help is not
needed. Stan-ford students attend Stanford
shows to see their fellow students perform, not
outsiders.
Let's hope that in the future students here
will show enough interest in Gaieties to pro
vide their talents and that Gaieties directors
will search out that talent and use it.
Perhaps a good production this year will
drum up enough of that essential interest and
searching.
Essential if Big Game Gaieties is to remain in
the hands of those to whom it rightly belongs:
Stanford's students.
