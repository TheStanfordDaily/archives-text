It's been a long established fact that no one
can predict the political course that the Ameri
can mind will take in a national election.
But it's also been a national tradition that
everybody tries.
Actually, pre-election polling proves very
useful to party organizations and many times
indicates trends in opinion that otherwise
would not be noted.
One of the first and most recent surveys of
1956 political trends was thai taken by the Los
Angeles Mirror-News showing that in this state
Vice-President Richard Nixon and Adlai Stev
enson have far outdistanced all other possible
contenders in their parties at this time.
If this poll pf the 600 state committeemen
from both parties in California is to be taken as
indicative of popular feeling, it seems that, in
Republican ranks, Nixon has a five to two lead
over second place Senator William Knowland.
In this poll he also collected a six to two lead
over Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren,
who has stated he will not run, and an 18 to
two lead over Governor Goodwin Knight.
An even more puzzling fact was the nine to
one lead that the poll gave to Adlai Stevenson
over his nearest contender, Senator Estes Ke
fauver.
Stevenson appeared to have over a 20 to one
lead over third place Averell Harriman.
In the 1952 election California Republicans
backed Governor W T arren in the convention al
though in the end they switched their votes to
Eisenhower, and Democrats picked Kefauver in
the primaries.
Despite coy political hedging on both sides
of the fence, several major party choices have
been suggested, among these Stevenson, Har
rimari and Kefauver for the Democrats, and a

less well defined group for the Republicans in
cluding California's "Big Four" (Knowland,
Nixon, Knight and Warren), Stassen, Henry
Cabot Lodge and others.
Harriman supporters received a jolt earlier
this month when, immediately following a visit
of the Harriman-backed boss of Tammany Hall.
Carmine de Sapio, California Democratic lead
ers strongly endorsed Stevenson as their
choice for candidate.
The California vote in nominating conven
tions is especially important to prospective can
didates since California ranks second only to
New York in the number of delegates sent to
each convention.
State Attorney General Edmund G. Brown,
the only Democrat in a state-wide elective of
fice, recently turned down the possibility that
he would run for the Senate against incumbent
Thomas Kuchel.
Instead Brown is planning to devote his en
tire political energy to supporting Stevenson.
Knight may or may not entertain greater po
litical ambitions, but if he does he will have to
secure the support of California Republicans : n
the June primaries.
Although the governor usually leads the
delegation to his own party convention, Knight
may face others, such as Knowland and Nixon,
egually covetous of support by the large Cali
fornia Republican delegation.
Few dare to predict ai this early date who
will win in November.
In a poll reported in "Western Public Opin
ion" by Alfred de Grazia of Stanford, a fairly
small percentage of voters (36% of the Demo
crats and 27% for the Republicans) knew all
along which parly or candidate they were
going to support.

can mind will take in a national election.
But it's also been a national tradition that
everybody tries.
Actually, pre-election polling proves very
useful to party organizations and many times
indicates trends in opinion that otherwise
would not be noted.
One of the first and most recent surveys of
1956 political trends was thai taken by the Los
Angeles Mirror-News showing that in this state
Vice-President Richard Nixon and Adlai Stev
enson have far outdistanced all other possible
contenders in their parties at this time.
If this poll pf the 600 state committeemen
from both parties in California is to be taken as
indicative of popular feeling, it seems that, in
Republican ranks, Nixon has a five to two lead
over second place Senator William Knowland.
In this poll he also collected a six to two lead
over Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren,
who has stated he will not run, and an 18 to
two lead over Governor Goodwin Knight.
An even more puzzling fact was the nine to
one lead that the poll gave to Adlai Stevenson
over his nearest contender, Senator Estes Ke
fauver.
Stevenson appeared to have over a 20 to one
lead over third place Averell Harriman.
In the 1952 election California Republicans
backed Governor W T arren in the convention al
though in the end they switched their votes to
Eisenhower, and Democrats picked Kefauver in
the primaries.
Despite coy political hedging on both sides
of the fence, several major party choices have
been suggested, among these Stevenson, Har
rimari and Kefauver for the Democrats, and a

less well defined group for the Republicans in
cluding California's "Big Four" (Knowland,
Nixon, Knight and Warren), Stassen, Henry
Cabot Lodge and others.
Harriman supporters received a jolt earlier
this month when, immediately following a visit
of the Harriman-backed boss of Tammany Hall.
Carmine de Sapio, California Democratic lead
ers strongly endorsed Stevenson as their
choice for candidate.
The California vote in nominating conven
tions is especially important to prospective can
didates since California ranks second only to
New York in the number of delegates sent to
each convention.
State Attorney General Edmund G. Brown,
the only Democrat in a state-wide elective of
fice, recently turned down the possibility that
he would run for the Senate against incumbent
Thomas Kuchel.
Instead Brown is planning to devote his en
tire political energy to supporting Stevenson.
Knight may or may not entertain greater po
litical ambitions, but if he does he will have to
secure the support of California Republicans : n
the June primaries.
Although the governor usually leads the
delegation to his own party convention, Knight
may face others, such as Knowland and Nixon,
egually covetous of support by the large Cali
fornia Republican delegation.
Few dare to predict ai this early date who
will win in November.
In a poll reported in "Western Public Opin
ion" by Alfred de Grazia of Stanford, a fairly
small percentage of voters (36% of the Demo
crats and 27% for the Republicans) knew all
along which parly or candidate they were
going to support.
It's been a long established fact that no one
can predict the political course that the Ameri
can mind will take in a national election.
