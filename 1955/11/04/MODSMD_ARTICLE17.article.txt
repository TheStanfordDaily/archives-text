plot suspected
To the Editor:
112 suspect a plot against the faculty on the part of
car-owning students. The circumstances described
b< low could have arisen by chance only one in 1000
times.
A couple of days ago I arrived at the campus at
X:4.) a.m. but could not find a place to park in the
re erved lot at that late hour. Cars without permits
occupied many of the places. This situation had the
apparently desired effectâ€”l decided to try the tri
angle at E'condido and Galvez.
My. what a fiendish and diabolical arrangement of
vehicles! Cars parked sidewise used spaces for two
others. Autos forming lines of one car each blocked
some ol the lanes (il the driver o! ons had moved

four foot ahead he would have had forty others in
his line). Most interesting was the general pattern
of 'anes between rows of parked cars. Some straight
lanes suddenly twisted back on themselves. Curved
lanes soon developed into S-curves. and one of them
possessed some of the characteristics of a hairpin.
Some lanes had no openings. But the prize was an
area with no lares.
All was not lost. Eventually I found a parking
place. Getting into it was a simple matter of backing
through one of the crooked lanes and then pulling
ahead on a different tack.
It must be a plot. Some master mind must lie
awake nights thinking of ways to give the impres
sion that some Stanford students would park their
cars carelessly.
