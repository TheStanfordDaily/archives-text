# Farm Officials Will Consider Reopening Los Arboles Road
## 
### 
The ASSU Traffic Committee has asked the University to con
sider the reopening of Los Arboles Road between Santa Teresa
Street and Foothill Road.
The right of way was closed by the University at the beginning
of the guarter in what was labeled as a "temporary experiment."

Permanent barricades were erected 112
at both ends of the street a few j
weeks ago.
At a meeting last week, Univer
sity officials indicated they would
consider the matter after a poll of
Lagunita Court residents was com
pleted.
Since then, the results show that
of the 302 women casting votes, only
40 wished to see the road remain
closed. Ninety-eight wished to see
the road open from 5 p.m. to 7 a.m.,
while the rest of the residents voted
to have the road open full time.
In another action, the committee \

|
called on the University to improve
parking conditions in the so-called
"triangle lot" between Stern Hall
and the Education Building.
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler, Business Manager Alf Bran
din, Police Chief Gordon Davis and
representatives of the University
Planning Office agreed to try to do
something to improve the situation
before the start of winter quarter.
Another topic of discussion by the
committee was expanding parking
facilities on campus, including the
present chemistry building parking
lot.
Concensus at the meeting was that
addition of parking space would only
serve to aggrevate an already serious
traffic problem.
The committee discussed issuing
special parking permits to off-cam
pus motorists, allowing them to park
in some formerly restricted areas.
Another topic of discussion was
the possibility of posting the ends
of Palm D l- ive to the effect that bi
cyclists should drive on the side
walks in preference to the roadway.
Chief Davis showed considerable
interest in this proposal, and an
nounced that he would look into the
matter.
