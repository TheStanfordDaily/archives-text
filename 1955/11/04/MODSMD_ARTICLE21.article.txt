# JV's Tackle San Diego Navy Today
## 
### 
The Stanford Braves meet their
third service team in four weeks
today as they travel to San Diego to
meet the San Diego Naval Training
Center. The game will start at 2 p.m.
The Naval team is made up of
high school players with very little
college or service team experience.
Only one member of last year's team
was able to remain.
This game will be the second
meeting between a Stanford team
and the Servicemen. In 1942, Naval
Traing Center beat the Stanford
lrosh, 20-lli.
The Braves will go with their
usual lineup, running Jack Lewis at
the quarterback slot.
Having a record of one win, two
losses and one tie, the Braves would
like this one. They meet Treasure
Island here on the 12th, and then
meet the Cal Ramblers on the 19th.
