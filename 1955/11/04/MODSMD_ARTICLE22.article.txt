# Frosh Face SC Trobabes
## 
### 
The Fro-h gridders go after their
first win of the season tomorrow
when they travel to Los Angeles to
take on the highly touted USC year
lings. The contest, starting at 11:30
a.m., will be the preliminary to the
Sianford-USC varsity game in the
Coliseum.
Coach Bob Giiilotti, of the Pa- |
pooses, thinks his charges have an
excellent chance of upsetting the
dopesters by pulling out a win. The
situation is perfect for an upset, says
the frosh mentor, since Stanford was
thumped by UCLA last week end
and the Trobabes downed the Cal
yearlings, seemingly without effort.
The Papooses could catch the home
team napping and bring home the
bacon.
Ghilotti, after seeing the movies
of last Saturday's Frosh - UCLA
game, says that he will probable
start Jim Ukropina in the quarter
back slot. The boy came on well in
the second half against the Bruin
babes and has been leading the team \
this past week in practice. Ukropina j
replaces Jerry Reinhart who was in
jured early in Saturday's game and j
who will be out for the remainder |
of the season.
Another newcomer in the starting j
lineup will be Jim Sinnerud who
will take over the starting right half
back spot. Hard-hitting Bob Peter- j
son moved into the fullback position I
in lieu of Bob Childs who is also out
for the rest of the season with a
broken hand.
The rest of the Papoose lineup
will be the same with the possible j
exception of the right end berth
where Ghilotti may start either Ty j
Polieh or lanky Ben Robinson. Rob
inson impressed observers in his first
outing last Saturday both offensively
and on defense.
The tackle postions will have Troy
Barbee and Don Crosby starting, at
the guards will be Ralph Koldinger i
and Glenn Hayden, at center will be
John Thomas, and Denny Farrar has 1
nailed down the left end slot.
According to pre-game plans, the
Trobabes can look forward to having j
a busy afternoon on pass defense as
Ghilotti has been stressing the short,
pass which coach Chuck Taylor's j
varsity has been using so success- j
fully lately. Ukropina has the ability
to throw the ball and the yearlings'
pass defense has been one of their j
brighter points.

dopesters by pulling out a win. The
situation is perfect for an upset, says
the frosh mentor, since Stanford was
thumped by UCLA last week end
and the Trobabes downed the Cal
yearlings, seemingly without effort.
The Papooses could catch the home
team napping and bring home the
bacon.
Ghilotti, after seeing the movies
of last Saturday's Frosh - UCLA
game, says that he will probable
start Jim Ukropina in the quarter
back slot. The boy came on well in
the second half against the Bruin
babes and has been leading the team \
this past week in practice. Ukropina j
replaces Jerry Reinhart who was in
jured early in Saturday's game and j
who will be out for the remainder |
of the season.
Another newcomer in the starting j
lineup will be Jim Sinnerud who
will take over the starting right half
back spot. Hard-hitting Bob Peter- j
son moved into the fullback position I
in lieu of Bob Childs who is also out
for the rest of the season with a
broken hand.
The rest of the Papoose lineup
will be the same with the possible j
exception of the right end berth
where Ghilotti may start either Ty j
Polieh or lanky Ben Robinson. Rob
inson impressed observers in his first
outing last Saturday both offensively
and on defense.
The tackle postions will have Troy
Barbee and Don Crosby starting, at
the guards will be Ralph Koldinger i
and Glenn Hayden, at center will be
John Thomas, and Denny Farrar has 1
nailed down the left end slot.
According to pre-game plans, the
Trobabes can look forward to having j
a busy afternoon on pass defense as
Ghilotti has been stressing the short,
pass which coach Chuck Taylor's j
varsity has been using so success- j
fully lately. Ukropina has the ability
to throw the ball and the yearlings'
pass defense has been one of their j
brighter points.
The Fro-h gridders go after their
first win of the season tomorrow
when they travel to Los Angeles to
take on the highly touted USC year
lings. The contest, starting at 11:30
a.m., will be the preliminary to the
Sianford-USC varsity game in the
Coliseum.
Coach Bob Giiilotti, of the Pa- |
pooses, thinks his charges have an
excellent chance of upsetting the
dopesters by pulling out a win. The
