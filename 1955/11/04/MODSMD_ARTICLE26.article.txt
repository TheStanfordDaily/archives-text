# Hill Dismisses End for Rule Violation
## 
### 
USC's huge end, Chuck Griffith,
was dropped from the team Wednes
day by coach Jess Hill for breaking
training rules. Hill would not name
any specific violations, but sources
stated that the 239-pound wing
man had broken training more than
once this year.
Chuck Leimbach, a junior, is ex
pected to take over the starting job
given up by Griffith. The lanky Im
pounder gained experience last year
when he replaced the injured Leon

Clarke, his new running-mate.
Griffith is considered an excellent
pass receiver and fine ball-carrier.
Since he is a senior, the flanker
has seen his last action in a Trojan
uniform unless Hill should change
his decision.
