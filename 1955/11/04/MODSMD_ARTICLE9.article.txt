### JIM BAKER 
When the Stanford football
team takes the field against USC
tomorrow afternoon at 2 in Me
morial Coliseum, it will be will)
the determination to show
Southland football fans that last
year's 72-0 loss on the samo
field, to UCLA, was only a fluko.
A crowd of 70,000 is expected for
the game, which will mark the .'i.'li I
time the two teams have met. South
ern California holds the lead in the
series, 19 wins to Stanford's 12. Twd
contests have ended in ties.
Coach Chuck Taylor named Ton
Mosich and Joe Long co-captain, li
the game. Mosich, the number oil
man at right guard last season. • i
switched to left guard this year and
is having a tine season.
Long, first-string center, will h
remembered for his recovery of a
Washington fumble which ultimately
led to a Stanford score and a Stan
ford tie with the Northerners.
TAYLOR OPTIMISTIC
Taylor was optimistic over the
Indian's chances. "We have an ex
cellent chance of winning," he slate I
after practice. "Everything is goin.'
just fine." However, UCLA coach
Henry "Red" Sanders does not'hold
to this view. Alter the Uclans play<
Stanford, Sanders said "The Trojan
will eat Brodie alive."
The Indians are at full strength
for the tilt, as A1 Harrington, rex i \ <
fullback, is now running at I::. i
speed and appears to have his in
jured ankle under control.
Guard Donn Carswell, who wa
out with the flu, will be ready to
play tomorrow, according to trainer
Connie Jarvis.
McMillan ready
Halfback Jeri McMillan will a I >
be ready to play, although Gordy
Young will start at that position
The Indians will need to be al full
strength to battle the Trojans. The
Southlanders have been beaten, bu

picture.
In USC's 7-0 loss to Washin ton
the field was covered with wal(
and it rained during the whole game
At Minnesota, where the Troj. n
lost 25-19, it snowed.
But the chance for snow in the
Coliseum is remote.
COME-THROUGH
It appears that the Indians will
have to count on come-through per
formances, such as tackle Paul Wi;.;-
gin's in the San Jose State game.
Spartan Coach Bob Bronzan pr.ii - -
ed Wiggin and the whole Stanford
team after the game last week. If
said Stanford could move the hail
against any team in the country, in
cluding USC.
The Trojans are favored by l(J
points.
The Indian's traveling squad ol 'M
players will leave at noon today hy
plane for the Southland.
On paper, things look good for I lie
Cards. They are the top passing train
in the PCC with an average of !:;. <>
yards per game through the air. Tin
record also ranks them tenth in tin
nation.
USC SIXTH
On the other hand, USC rani;
