### JIM BAKER 
A pin-point passer and a rock-ribbed defensive line provided
the Stanford Indians with an upset win over the favored .(JSC
Trojans, 28-20, Saturday afternoon in a smog - filled Memorial
Coliseum.
It was shades of Bobby Garrett as junior quarterback John

Brodie put on tho best, passing . hi v
of his career, completing 11 out r.l'
2(5 pus: es for a total of 21(5 yawls aid
two touchdowns.
The crowd of 63,000 sat in am.iZf -
inent as the Indians stopped du\
after drive of the Trojans and inter
cepted five passes.
Paul Wiggin, Gary Van Galder,
Tony Mosich, Chris Marshall ;u«l
Bill Tarr all figured big on the • <•-
fensiye side. Wiggin, Mo ich ai i

USC coach .Jess Hill as the standouts
in a "very fine line."
Van Galder was brilliant on of
fense as well a.s defense, scorine on
touchdown, recovering a fumble ai; I
intercepting a pass.
TARR TALLIES
Tarr also scored once, after pick
ing a Frank Hall pass from the hand
of Jon Arnett and running it back
55 yards for the third Stanford
touchdown.
It seemed as if each time USC
would almost get a sustained diive
rolling, the Cards would come up
with an interception or a line be
bind-the-line tackle to stop the Tro
jans in their tracks.
There was no scoring in the rather
loosely played first quarter, a boiii
teams fumbled twice.
CARDS GET JUMP
The first score came after Van
Galder recovered an Arnett fumble
on the Stanford 45. Brodie's 19 yard
pass to Van Galder in the end zone
climaxed the Card drive. Mickey
Raftery's kick was good.
Four minutes later, Brodie inter
cepted an Ellsworth Kissinger pa.
on the Stanford 40 yard line. On
the next play Brodie reared ba. I
and threw a 40 yard pa.-s to :;d
John Stewart who was tackled on
the SC six for a gain of 54 yard.
Three plays later Brodie nc I. I

Doug Dick's kick (from the
due to a Stanford penalty) ban ,
cleared the uprights.
Southern California's first score
came minutes later after an nlei
ference call in the Stanford end /.one.
SC got the ball on the one, and H I
pushed over for the score. Bob
Isaacson's kick was wide to the right.
This one missed point gave the In
dians a very decided mental edj
for now the Trojans needed two
touchdowns to go ahead.
TROJAN COMEBACK
The Trojans took the second half
kickoff and marched downfiold froiti
their own 25 in a series of plays
highlighted by Arnett's 33 yard run
to the Stanford one. Two play later,
he plunged over for the second Tro
jan score. His conversion wa: eoc 1.
Late in the same quarter, Tarr
made his interception and score, nd
Raftery's kick again split the up

BRODIE FlRES—Stanford quarterback John Brodie jumps into
the air to toss a pass against USC's Trojans in the pigskin upset
Saturday in the Coliseum. The Indian signal-caller completed
14 passes against the leaky Troy pass defense and hit receivers
several other times when the ball was dropped. Coach Jess

Hill of the Figueroa Street eleven praised Brodie as the top
passer his team has faced this season. Charging the Tribe tosser
are a pair of USC linemen. Orlando Ferrante is No. 61. Doing
the blocking for Brodie on this play are guard Donn Carswell
(64) and fullback Bill Tarr (30).
Brodie pass on the Stanford 45, and
returned it to the two.
Gordie Duval 1 slipped over right
guard for the score and Zampese's
kick was good to make the score
21-20.
FURL A NIC GETS CLINCHER
However, Stanford's Fritz Furlanic
put the final damper on USC hopes
late in the last quarter as, with 3
minutes to go he intercepted a Jim
Contratto pass on the SC 30 and re
turned it to the 23.
The Indians scored again here as
Brodie completed a six yard pass to
Raftery in the end zone. Raftery's
kick was good, making the final
score 28-20.
The Cards suffered only one pos
sible injury—trainer Connie Jarvis
said that Tony Mosich may have a
fractured jaw. On the other side,
four Trojans were injured, including
star lineman Orlando Ferrante.
The turning point, in Taylor's
opinion, seemed to be Tarr's inter
ception, which turned a possible
USC score into a Stanford touch
down.

"It was our best game this year,"
Taylor said happily afterwards.
"Brodie is coming into his own."
Taylor also praised Gordie Young
for his fine offense and defense work.
Tarr, the leading rusher in the

the ball as often as usual. When
asked the reason for this, Taylor
said that since USC was laying for
Tarr, Stanford would have to pass.

the other tackle. Bill Tarr (30) helps protect the passer on the play. The protection for Brodie
was outstanding as he was not caught behind scrimmage once all afternoon. John had only
one heave intercepted, while Stanford's sparkling defensive backfield snared five USC passes.

BRODIE FlRES—Stanford quarterback John Brodie jumps into
the air to toss a pass against USC's Trojans in the pigskin upset
Saturday in the Coliseum. The Indian signal-caller completed
14 passes against the leaky Troy pass defense and hit receivers
several other times when the ball was dropped. Coach Jess

Hill of the Figueroa Street eleven praised Brodie as the top
passer his team has faced this season. Charging the Tribe tosser
are a pair of USC linemen. Orlando Ferrante is No. 61. Doing

(64) and fullback Bill Tarr (30).
Brodie pass on the Stanford 45, and

However, Stanford's Fritz Furlanic

The Indians scored again here as
Brodie completed a six yard pass to
Raftery in the end zone. Raftery's

The Cards suffered only one pos

four Trojans were injured, including

Saturday in the Coliseum. The Indian signal-caller completed
14 passes against the leaky Troy pass defense and hit receivers
several other times when the ball was dropped. Coach Jess

Hill of the Figueroa Street eleven praised Brodie as the top
passer his team has faced this season. Charging the Tribe tosser

Gordie Duval 1 slipped over right

However, Stanford's Fritz Furlanic
put the final damper on USC hopes
late in the last quarter as, with 3

The Indians scored again here as
Brodie completed a six yard pass to
Raftery in the end zone. Raftery's
kick was good, making the final
score 28-20.
The Cards suffered only one pos

said that Tony Mosich may have a
fractured jaw. On the other side,
four Trojans were injured, including
star lineman Orlando Ferrante.
The turning point, in Taylor's
