## 
### 
WASHINGTONâ€”Army Secretary |
Wilber M. Brucker today approved
a report urging development of a j
complete family of chemical, biologi
cal and radiological weapons for
"actual use" if necessary.
The report, drafted by a 4-man
civilian advisory committee which
was appointed earlier this year, de
cried the public conception that such
forms of warfare are "horrifying in

character" and said they hava a
"proper place" in military planning.
The committee proposed appoint
ing a top-ievel officer in the Chemi
cal Corps to keep tabs gn germ war
fare developments and fit. them into
overall military planning. It also
called for "aggressive" intelligence
to discover what other nations are
doing in the field.
The committee said these weapons
have "unique potential in warfare
without associated destruction of fa
cilities and the attendant problems
of rehabilitation.
"Recognition also must be given
to the ability of these weapons to
weaken the 'will to fight' of the en
emy's military personnel and civilian
population without attendant loss of
lives or permanent injury."
