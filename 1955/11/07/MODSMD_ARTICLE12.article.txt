## 
### 
Purposes, and methods of achieving them, were discussed by

last week.
This commiitee was set up by a measure passed by the ASSU
Legislature recently. Jack Richardson is chairman.

The formal statement of purpose 4
issued by Richardson yesterday is
•as follows:
"This committee was organized in
the hope that it might be a sounding
board for student opinion concerning
extracurricular functions and could
assimilate this information into a
form which would be of use to the

sponsoring groups and students at
large.
"We think that by working with
the various student comrr : ttees and
boards we can perform a function
that will help them evaluate their
own contributions to student life.
"The committee arose at a time
when there was quite a bit of public
sentiment expressed concerning the
role and purpose of extracurricular
activities at Stanford. A group which
will be working with activities and
their sponsors will no doubt be forc
ed eventually to deal with this ques
tion.
"The committee, because of its
"i" 00 association with the activity
program, wil deal with the theory
of activities and their relation to
academic life; but. such a small seg
ment of the Stanford student body
has no right to criticize specific
events or try to initiate reform.
"We shall serve specifically to in
vestigate student interests and in an
advisory capacity."
ASSU president George Ralph's
comments on the committee and the
reasons for it were stated as follows:
"The committee will be dealing
with such questions as the type of
activities the majority of students
want and will participate in and the
role of individual choice in a vital
extracurricular program (do stu
dents. for example, feel that there is
too much social pressure to take
part in activities?).
"It is hoped that two important
results of the committee's work will
be a general concensus of the type
of activity students find most mean -
ingful and an evaluation, based on
general student opinion, of the ac
tivities sponsored by various organi
zations.
"This evaluation should, be valu
able to each organization, whose of
ficers often have too little time and
no method to sample* student senti
ment before sponsoring an event, in
the planning of its social program.
"The important things is a student
appraisal of their own social life;
out of the study may grow an ex
pression of the main goals of Stan
ford as an academic institution and
the relationship to them of various
types of organization and activity."

ed eventually to deal with this ques
tion.
"The committee, because of its
"i" 00 association with the activity
program, wil deal with the theory
of activities and their relation to
academic life; but. such a small seg
ment of the Stanford student body
has no right to criticize specific
events or try to initiate reform.
"We shall serve specifically to in
vestigate student interests and in an
advisory capacity."
ASSU president George Ralph's
comments on the committee and the
reasons for it were stated as follows:
"The committee will be dealing
with such questions as the type of
activities the majority of students
want and will participate in and the
role of individual choice in a vital
extracurricular program (do stu
dents. for example, feel that there is
too much social pressure to take
part in activities?).
"It is hoped that two important
results of the committee's work will
be a general concensus of the type
of activity students find most mean -
ingful and an evaluation, based on
general student opinion, of the ac
tivities sponsored by various organi
zations.
"This evaluation should, be valu
able to each organization, whose of
ficers often have too little time and
no method to sample* student senti
ment before sponsoring an event, in
the planning of its social program.
"The important things is a student
appraisal of their own social life;
out of the study may grow an ex
pression of the main goals of Stan
ford as an academic institution and
the relationship to them of various
types of organization and activity."

The formal statement of purpose 4

•as follows:
"This committee was organized in
the hope that it might be a sounding
board for student opinion concerning
extracurricular functions and could
assimilate this information into a
form which would be of use to the

sponsoring groups and students at
large.
"We think that by working with
the various student comrr : ttees and
boards we can perform a function
that will help them evaluate their
own contributions to student life.
"The committee arose at a time
when there was quite a bit of public
sentiment expressed concerning the
role and purpose of extracurricular
activities at Stanford. A group which
will be working with activities and
their sponsors will no doubt be forc
ed eventually to deal with this ques
tion.
