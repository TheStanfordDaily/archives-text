# Hip Hooray— SC Chagrined As Indians Win
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
It was a hip-hip-hooray day
from start to finish.
Despite the customary blur of
Los Angeles smog which nes
tled inside the Coliseum, the
weather was clear and bright for
Stanford; the sun shone bril
! iiantly on the Tribe all day.
But for Jess Hill, it was dreary,
cloudy, thundering (that thunder |
you heard, Jess, yes, that came from
the old alums). Though many Tro
jan tears glistened from the north
side stands, the field remained dry,
the footing good—the weather didn't
beat Troy Saturday.
Stanford beat Troy. Stanford had
come to win. No question about it.
The Indians displayed an air of con
fidence, a purposefulness, a determi
nation, a disregard for bad breaks.
VENI, VIDI, VICI
They acted like conquerors—and
they conquered. They conquered
Troy for the first time in four years.
They conquered Troy for game little
Jeri McMillin, whose young .sister
died earlier in the week after ton
sillectomy complications.
This was after the Trojan section
had blared out its cocky, traditional
"Conquest." Most of the noise came
from the hustling Trojan band—lso
guys in yellow tails, 50 carrying
shields, 50 carrying pennants, 50
playing musical instruments.
Oh, yes, you can be sure that all
of Troy was there in full strength.
Tommy Walker's successor was bob
bing around in front of the band
(someday he's going to fall fiat . . .
and it's going to be worth waiting a
lifetime to see).
TROJAN HORSE
The Trojan horse appeared and
1 was given a stirring ride. Then there
were floats (didn't look like they
waste time building them at SC—
just buy 'em for a couple of thou
sand), queen and court for the 75th
anniversary and yell leaders in
khaki bermuda shorts. Collegiate all
the way.
Stanford also had an air horn all
its own (they say it's the loudest on
the coast). It got a good work-out
when the men of Chuck Taylor took
over. Then all that had gone before
the kickofT was forgotten.
PASS IN ENI) ZONE
Finally somebody managed to 1
hang on to 'a pass —it was Van Gal
der in the end zone. Then Stewart
I ran under that long heave along the
north sideline. Brodic slipped over
for six more. This was what we
came for.
Suddenly handkerchiefs were
down near the goal line. The ref
said interference. Stanford said
; otherwise. But . . . and the Tro
jans scored.
i And in the second half they scored
again; they look tough. Stanford
I was their equal. Tarr ran like
Nashua right by the SC bench with
an SC pass and that was it.
When it was all over, Walters said
the town was ours. It was. HIP- j
I HIP-HOORAY!
