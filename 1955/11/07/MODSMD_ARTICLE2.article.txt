# SPRING VS. WINTER
## IFC, ICC Schedule Meeting Tonight to Discuss Rushing 
### 
A mass meeting of fraternity and eating club men will be held
tonight in Cubberley Auditorium at 7:15. The purpose of the meet
is to discuss the possibility of changing formal rushing from win
ter to spring quarter.
Speaking to the fraternity and eating club members will be

William Craig, new Dean of Men. 4
nnd Mrs. Ellene Sumner, director of j
Wilbur Ilall.
Ron Wagner, president of IFC; j
Bob Webster, ICC prexy, and Spike [
Lynch, rushing chairman of IFC,
will discuss the various points favor
ing both winter and spring rushing.
The meeting will then be turned
over to open discussion by all those
present.
Each house and club on campus
has been requested by the two coun
cils to send 15 members to the open
meeting. It was suggested that five
from each of the sophomore, junior
and senior classes be present.
Following the meeting, which will
replace house and club meetings to
night, those representatives from
each unit will discuss their ideas
with those who cannot attend.
A vote, will be taken at house
meetings next Monday in order to
determine the sentiment of frater
nity and eating club members. The
vote will be taken individually,
units not sending in their results as
a bloc.
A hypothetical plan for spring
quarter rushing has been posted in
fraternities and clubs the past week.
It includes an orientation period
late in winter quarter for the fresh
men.
The idea of changing formal rush
ing to the spring comes from a resi
dent assistant poll taken among
freshmen last year. It showed that
many of the frosh were not con
vinced that rushing hrtd been han
dled in the best manner possible in
1955.
