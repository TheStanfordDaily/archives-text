Thursday afternoon at 4:15 in Cubberley, the
Germanic-Romanic Language Department's In
termezzo Series presents another free flick.
And wonder of wonders it's of interest to more
than just such embattled language students as
are coerced into going, too. To get to the nub:
it's a film version of G. Verdi's "II Trovatore,"
and even if perchance the film should .smell,
you can't lose on the music. Looks like a good
deal.

"Are Student Activities Overemphasized at
Stanford?" is the topic of a debate to be held
at 7:30 Thursday in Cubberley. Among those
taking part will be Professor Stone, the guy
who wrote the article in The Daily two weeks or

so ago. This mk,ht bo of real interest to Rally
Cemmers, et al„ butv they'll have to leave their
marbles and pea-shooters home.
If you're about to b_' a parent and care to in
form the University of this fact, there's a good
chance you could attend the big Parents Day
Chowder Party and Muffin Worry which the
Cardinals are sponsoring Saturday. Among
the events planned are a Welcome Assembly
(no kidding) at 9:30; a faculty panel on a not
immediately comprehensible topic; lunch at
Bowman; seats at the game with Oregon, and
to 0:1. A fine thing, if you can qualify.

Anti-Intellectual Corner: Biology Professor
Emeritus Smith is the big attraction at a liitle
session the Bio Department is throwing this
afternoon at 4:15 in Room 430. He's giving a
talk on "Some Factors Affecting Sexuality in
Chlamydomonas," so bring your ID if you go;
it ought to be a lulu.
Flicks Note: Things are looking up in the
Flicks Dept., too. Mast be the crisp fall weath
er. Anyway, this week it's "The Best Years of
Our Lives," with Frederic March and Myrna
Loy, also Dana Andrews. It's a touch old, but
according to semi-reliable grad students it's
really a great flick. NOW HEAR THIS: The
flick is starting at 7, a half hour early, so make
a mental memo if you figure on going.
The Lit Je Fact Corner: Hogs fed raw garbage
at any time in their lives may not be moved
across state lines after Jan. 1, 1956, except for
slaughter or special treatment. Sort of a porcine
Mann Act, maybe . . .

And wonder of wonders it's of interest to more
than just such embattled language students as
are coerced into going, too. To get to the nub:
it's a film version of G. Verdi's "II Trovatore,"
and even if perchance the film should .smell,

"Are Student Activities Overemphasized at
Stanford?" is the topic of a debate to be held

marbles and pea-shooters home.
If you're about to b_' a parent and care to in
form the University of this fact, there's a good
chance you could attend the big Parents Day

immediately comprehensible topic; lunch at
Bowman; seats at the game with Oregon, and
to 0:1. A fine thing, if you can qualify.
