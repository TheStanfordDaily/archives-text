the spotlight
To the Editor:
I would like to thank The Daily for having ex
pressed as much interest as they have in this year's
Big Game Gaieties. Your alert editorial has (while
not being entirely flattering to u.s) focused a spotlight
on a situation which rightly deserves the attention
of the student body.
The fact that the editoiial was not based on all the
facts in the case is not to your discredit. The previous
letter to the editor (written by two students who
criticized us for using out-of-school talent although
they had made no effevt to be included in a show
which would not only welcome them but needs them
desperately) was received as a "crank note." but a
letter from the editor deserves a sincere and fully
factual reply.
There is not one, but TWO "outsiders" in this show.
They are the son and daughter of a lady who has
worked for many years on the Stanford campus and
who works here now. They are members of the Stan
ford "family."
We have made every effort to "search" for talent.
I personally spent three days during registration
trying to personally contact people for this show.
Signs announcing tryouts were up as early as we
were allowed to post them. A greater concentrated
effort to attract Stanford students was made than
ever before. The result of all this campaigning was
that a smaller turn-out for tryouts than that in the
last five years presented itself on the four nights on
which we heard auditions.
The truth oi' the matter is this: Stanford talent has
largely chosen to remain aloof from Gaieties; pre
fering to keep their social life active, choosing to
contribute their time to other competing activities.
The only possible solution for this student apathy
that I can think of is this: We are going to do a
Gaieties that is as fine as we can make it. We are
going to keep the QUALITY of this production as
high as possible in an effort to attract people to this
show in the future.
The door has been closed to no one. Everyone
can't play third base, that's true, but we've said a
hundred times that this is an OPEN show, that we
can use ANYONE somewhere, and I'll state it again.
You're dead wrong when you say "Outside help is
not needed." The truth of the matter is,that INSIDE
help is not forthcoming!
We're making no unique decisions. Look at your
paper. The second page i.s one half advertising; pages
three and iour. three-fourths. Why? You've got toi
make the paper pay. I know you don't prefer it this
way, you're just trying to get you job done, trying
to fulfill your obligation to the student body while
making darn sure you get the show on the road. Well,
so am 1

(Editor's note: We recognize the conflict which
faces Rain's Head: quality performance or exclu
sively local participation. When you put this con
lliet lip against the ideal, Ram's Head cun't win.
(We sincerely hope that the quality of next
week's show will erase the misfortunes of the last
few easons. We hear from reliable sources that
I truce Low ry is the best director Ram's Head has
come across in many moons. And we understand
that Jim Kason of San Jose is an outstanding per
former and author of the bet songs in the pro
duction.
(We still, however, regret the need to use ofT
eampus talent. We hope it won't be necessary in
the future. The situation is not the fault of Rani's
Head of 1955; the po»ir shows of the past few years
have destroyed much of Gaieties' prestige. And the
problem which faces Rani's Head is the general
problem which faces all of Stanford: Apathy is
choking the life out of this campus.)
buck-shot fashion
To the Editor:
The Stanford Daily has uncovered a student prob
lem ii, its editorial dealing with the casting of Rarn's

Head's 1955 Big Game Gaieties. It has extended an
opinion which 1 can only believe to be founded on
the sparsest inve ligation, into the matter, as well as
no knowledgeable experience in the production of a
show as large and as complicated as Gaieties. (To
my knowledge, the writer of the editorial drew all
information and material used in the statement from
the unfortunate letter written by two young girls
some days ago and appears to have blended this with
a desire to crusade heroically while indulging in a
good, fast emotioual catharsis,)
None of the production staff of the 1955 Gaieties
(so soundly reprimanded by the editorial) was ques
tioned or spoken to by any member of the Daily
staff, prior to publishing the editorial. No investiga
tion was made, worthy of that title. The result,
lamentably, was a potpourri of fact., fiction, exagger
ation (as regards the students of Stanford . . . they
hold 70 of 72 cast positions in the 1955 Gaieties),
irresponsible slander and sophomorism.
In its buck-shot fashion, the editorial blasts hole?
all around a target which, if aimed at, certainly
deserves to be pierced cleanly through the bulls-eye
by a campus organ as supposedly responsible as its
daily paper. Having said everything that came to
mind with the greatest facility, the writer of the
editorial finally bumps into the crux of the problem
when he expresses ' hope that in the future students
here will shew enough interest in Gaieties to provide
their talents. . . ."
Through four years at Stanford, I have worked as
a member of Ram's Head on many of its shows and
in many capacities. With my first show, I became
aware of a fact which has annoyed me ever since.
There is enough talent of varied sorts on the Stanford
campus to present three Gaieties simultaneously,
were that talent to audition and then make rehear
sals. The problem: less than one-third of it ever
does so.
Why? That's the subject for another letter. But
surely not because the show's directors fail to "search
out talent and use it." It amazes me that a writer
qualified to express himself on this subject could have
betn totally ignorant of the strenuous campaign en
gaged in by this year's Gaieties staff to find, beg, lure,
seduce and, if necessary, kidnap Stanford talent for
this production.
I refer to all kind? of talent. I refer, for instance,
to writing (music, skits, lyrics, etc.). I cannot su
press a smile as I read of how, sudden as a lightning
boit from Olympus, The Daily and some Stanford
citizcns decided that Gaieties has "deteriorated" into
a "Stanford spectator show," and that the "produc
tion directors condone this situation."
I recall the all-night sessions of last summer quar
ter (the period during which Gaieties material was
prepared and sorted) on the part of a half-dozen in
dividuals interested enough to work, after pleas and
letters to many Stanford writers failed to produce
anything but apathetic procrastination or outright
refusal to work.
While the D-iily staff was tanning its upper-case
at the beach, and the student body was setting about
a summer's activity, a handful of people were doing
what they could to see to it that Stanford had a 1955
Gaieties. They had to have material, and they took it
when someone was interested enough to create it.
I smile, too, when I thumb back mentally through
the excuses of numerous people whom we needed
badly at the time of tryouts. Their excuses for not
working on the how ranged from mumbled explana
tions about "a blonde up in Berkeley," to the very
acceptable but hardly helpiui reason that it was a
heavy quarter scholastically. This does not include
the talented people we never met . . . those whom we
can scarcely use since we are unaware that they exist.
There are numerous i-acels to this problem. There is
no room to mention them here. These are the facts,
if you'ie a directing a show: If you want a show
you've got to have people who are capable and who
are there. If you haven't «ot capable people, and
they're nol tnere, then you find them. Or else not
have a show. Believe me, we wi«h Marilyn Monroe
went to Stanford.
