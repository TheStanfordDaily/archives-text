# Gaieties Tickets to Sell on Quad Today; More Variety, Not Just Comedy, Is Aim
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
Tickets for the 1955 Big Game Gaieties will go on sale today
at Engineering Corner from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. and at Memorial Hall
box office from 12:30 to 4:30 p.m.
The..show, which will play in Memorial Auditorium Nov. 15-18,
will, according to director S. Bruce Lowry, the traditional

efhphasis on comedy. But with a dif-'
ference, too.
"Often in the past," Lowry said,
"comedy has meant the same thing
endlessly repeated. Gaieties, how
ever, is a variety show, and we mean
to preserve that variety in all its
aspects. Comedy isn't one thing; it's
many."
Sketches, as a result, range from
What Lowry calls "genuine social
satire" to knock-down, drag-out low
comedy and farce, with an excur
sion into the stylized and grotesque.
Nor is subject matter limited by
time or space. One of the sketches
deals with progressive education, a
nightmare school of lecherous, de

structive and "sexually progressive"
types.
Another is, according to* Lowry,
designed for those who object to
Gaieties taking too many evenings
in Mem Aud. "It will feature," he
said, "all attractions, past, present,
or future, ever to appear in the au
ditorium."
'Other subjects include the chronic
irritation of the cocktail party and,
Lowry says, "a comic study of the
self-destructive mind."
Technical staging devices make
u; o of all possible playing areas,
and, to add further variety, the or
chestra participates in several of the
sketches.
