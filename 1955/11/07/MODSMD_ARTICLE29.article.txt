# Papoose Defense Shines In 19-18 USC Triumph
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
Not to be outdone by their varsity brothers, Coach Bob Ghi
lotti's freshman football team put on one of the finest defensive
demonstrations ever produced by a Papoose eleven to upset the
powerful USC Trobabes, 19-18.
The frosh, trailing 6 to 13 at the half and 6-18 after three guarters

of play, capitalized on two fourth-'
quarter breaks to stage a dramatic
come-from-behind finish to subdue
the previously undefeated Trobabes.
SCORE
USC got off to a quick start by
scoring two easy touchdowns in the
first quarter after recovering Pa
poose fumbles deep in Stanford ter
ritory. The extra - point attempts
were foiled as the red-and-white
shirted Stanford line poured through
gaping holes to block the second
placement while the initial attempt
went wide of the uprights.
The first USC score resulted from
a recovered Jim Ukropina fumble.
The Papoose quarterback was at
tempting an option play when hit
hard by a host of SC tacklers and
the pigskin squirted from his grasp.
The ball was put in play on the
Stanford 10-yard line and SC scored
shortly thereafter on a series of line
plunges.
The second Trobabe tally, scored
minutes later, came as easily as the
first. Stanford again fumbled deep
in their own territory and SC re

covered on the eight. An offside
penalty against Stanford put the ball
on the three - yard line and from
there the losers rammed across in
one play.
UKROPINA TALLIES
After spotting the Trobabes two
touchdowns, Coach Bob Ghilotti's
■plucky eleven, still smarting from
last Saturday's 29-0 loss to UCLA,
started the uphill task of getting
back in the game.
The Papooses recovered an SC
fumble and quarterback Ukropina
immediately took to the air lanes.
Two passes placed the ball on the
one-yard line of SC and then, on a
fourth and one yard to go situation,
the tall field general dove into the
line for the score.
Stanford started out in earnest to
catch their rivals after Rucker, who
starred both offensively and defen
sively all day, burst into the SC
backfield to block a punt and give
the Papooses the ball on Southern
Cal's 17-yard line.
Denny Farrar, who was another
fair-haired lad for Coach Ghilotti on
several occasions throughout the
game, was on the spot to recover the
blocked kick.
At this point in the contest, Ghi
lotti sent in Bob Nicolet, from
Whitefish Bay High School in Wis
consin, to quarterback his eleven.
Ben Robinson's nifty catch of a
difficult throw helped the drive.
From the one, hard-hitting Bob Pe
terson, who was the game's only 60-
minute player, rammed the ball
across for the score.
"The game was very well played,"
Priddle said. "I was pleased with the
way our team played today after
losing to USF last week."
AKTIILK'S KICK GOOD
The crucial extra-point attempt by
Arthur split the goal post and the
frosh were back in the running with
the score 13 to 18 and most of the
fourth quarter left to play.
The inevitable happened when end
Ty Polich duplicated Rucker's feat
of blocking an SC punt and Stan
ford recovered in the person of Far
rar on the Trobabe 20 - yard line.
This time Ukropina came in to throw
and Stanford soon had the ball on
the one as a result of Polich's catch
at that point.
As the game neared completion,
Ukropina sneaked across for the win
ning points and it didn't matter that
Arthur's kick was no good; Ghi
lotti's game eleven had already ac
complished its mission of beating the
mighty Trobabes.

The Papoose quarterback was at
tempting an option play when hit

The second Trobabe tally, scored

started the uphill task of getting
back in the game.
The Papooses recovered an SC
fumble and quarterback Ukropina
immediately took to the air lanes.
Two passes placed the ball on the
one-yard line of SC and then, on a
fourth and one yard to go situation,
the tall field general dove into the
line for the score.
Stanford started out in earnest to
catch their rivals after Rucker, who
starred both offensively and defen
sively all day, burst into the SC
backfield to block a punt and give

Denny Farrar, who was another
fair-haired lad for Coach Ghilotti on
