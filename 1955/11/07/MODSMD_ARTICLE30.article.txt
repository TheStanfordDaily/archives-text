# Hill Credits Upset Loss To Passing

USC head coach Jess Hill sat
glumly on the end of a rubdown
table chewing an apple follow
ing the Stanford upset of the
Trojans.
Hill, whose Trojans were upset
last week by Minnesota in the snow,
said, "I can't complain about the
weather this time.
"You can't beat a team if their
passer doesn't miss. Stanford is one
of the few teams that can have ball
control while passing. It's because
of their sharpshooting quarterbacks."
The coach praised Brodie, and the
Stanford line, especially tackle Paul
Wiggin. Wiggin's defensive play was
also praised last week, by San Jose
State coach Bob Bronzan.
He blamed injuries (four Trojans
were hurt) for part of the defeat,
and said that Arnett was too tired
towards the end to play up fo par.
Although Bill Tarr didn't carry the
ball as much as usual, Hill praised
him for keeping the defense "hon
est."
The dressing room was quiet, as if
the Trojans wouldn't believe their
defeat.
One writer asked Hill how he felt
about the game beforehand. Hill re
plied, "I thought we would win; I
felt our chances were good." When
asked how he felt about Notre Dame,
he replied, "I think our chances are
good. We just made too many mis
takes today, and Stanford was able
to capitalize on them."
