# New Symphony Seats Available
## 
### 
The Stanford Symphony Forum
has exchanged part of its allotment
of San Francisco Symphony student
season tickets with other Bay Area
schools, giving Stanford students a
wider choice of seats.
Season tickets for the 18 concerts,
are available in the orchestra and
grand tier, at $22.50, and in the bal
cony, at $17. Some $9 seats, are also
for sale.
The San Francisco Symphony is
the only orchestra in the country to
give students reduced rates on sea
son tickets. In many cases the re
duction amounts to half price.
First program of the season—the
traditional all - orchestra! opening
concert, conducted by Enrique Jor
da—will be Nov. 24.
Guest artists will appear with the
orchestra at all but its first and last
concerts. Stanford Symphony con
ductor Sandor Salgo will direct the
orchestra in March.
Other guests to appear include
Rudolf Serkin, Gregor Piatigorsky,
Isaac Stern, Bruno Walter and Grant
Johannesen.
Tickets are on sale at the Concert
Series office in the Nitery from 1 to
5 p.m., Monday through Friday.
