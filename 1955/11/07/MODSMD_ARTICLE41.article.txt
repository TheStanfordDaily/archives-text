# 'Stanford Sadie' Schedule Changed
## 
### 
Tonight's "Stanford Sadie" pro
gram on KZSU will go on the air
at 10:30 p.m. instead of 10 p.m. as
on previous Monday evenings, sta
tion officials announced.
"Stanford Sadie" is a feminine
disc jockey famed for her inimitable
style and voluptuous voice. She is
a woman of mystery, with her iden
tity remaining unknown until the
end of the quarter when it is re
vealed in a blaze of glory.
The "Stanford Sadie" show lasts
30 minutes every Monday night.
