NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING
#
. . . its place in the scheme of things
Advertising is news—plus. It is a statement of facts with an avowed
motive.
, Its usual purpose is to sell merchandise, but it helps elect Presidents and
put over Community drives as well.
♦
Newspapers are natural carriers of advertising,..for they possess prac-
tically every attribute that drives a business message home.
Newspaper advertising benefits from the prestige of the newspaper
that carries it. It enjoys "reflected glory" so to speak, and possesses a
"believability" in proportion to the confidence the public has in the
newspaper itself.
A good newspaper is a welcome and familiar visitor in practically
every home, and the advertising it contains is welcome, too.
Newspaper advertising is remembered, for it can be read and re-read;
or it can be put aside for later reference.
It has eye appeal by virtue of its illustrations.
It is flexible, permitting sudden changes of copy or schedule.
To be successful advertising must be truthful, and the product or cause
it represents must be honest. Exaggerated claims lead to disappoint
ment and failure. A dishonest product can be sold only once.
The unbeatable combination is an honest product, represented by truth
ful advertising in a medium in which the public has confidence and
respect — a good newspaper!
