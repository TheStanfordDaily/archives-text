# $90,000 ERL Construction Continues
## Two New Dormitories Also Rising Rapidly 
### 
Construction is continuing on
schedule on the Electronics Re
search Laboratory expansion,
begun early this fall.
The $90,000 expansion program in
corporates an extension of the Hew
lett-Packard wing on the Sou'Ji end
of the building, and the construction
of a new Gilfillan wing on the north
end.
The construction is being financed
with gifts from Gilfillan Brothers,
Inc., of Los Angeles and Hewlett-
Packard Company of Palo. Alto.
According to Jack Lynd of the
University Planning Office, con
struction is scheduled to be com
pleted by the beginning of January.
Officials hope to move into the
building by winter quarter.
CONGESTION
"The extensions will remove the
worst aspects of our present con
gestion," said Frederick E. Terman,
University Provost and Dean of the
School of Engineering.
The laboratory's floor space will
be increased by approximately 8000
square feet, or one-fourth its present
size.
Construction of the Gilfillan wing
is so planned that it can be further
extended at some future date, the
Provost added. It is expected even
tually to match the Hewlett-Pack
ard wing in length, making the flcor
plan of the building resemble a huge
letter "E."
The donor companies have close
ties with Stanford. Sennet W. Gil
fillan, who founded the Los Angeles
firm with his brother, was gradu
ated' in 1912, and both William R.
Hewlett and David Packard, who
founded the Palo Alto company, are
Stanford alumni.

and the Stern Hall extension. Both
are on construction schedule. The

The foundation is now nearing j
completion for Moore Hall. The
concrete for the foundations nas
