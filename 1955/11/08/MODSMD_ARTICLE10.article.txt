Mr. Eisenhower an enthusiastic 'bill j
of comparative good health following j
intensive examination of the Presi- j

But he emphasized that the chief
executive's decision as to his future j

make himself sometime late in the
winter.
Tentative plans call for Mr. Ei
senhower to leave Fitzsimmons
Army Hospital sometime Friday
morning. He will arrive in the capi
tal sometime Friday afternoon and
spend the weekend there before go
ing, probably Monday, Nov. 14, to
his Gettysburg. Pa., farm.
