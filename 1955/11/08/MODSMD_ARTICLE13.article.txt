| nity Clu'o President Ron Wagner
j and Interclub Council President Bob
Webster discussed the various as
pects of rushing lrom both point:, of
view.
Mrs. Sumner, d rector of Wilbur
Hall, spoke from the ftos.h point 01
view which favored giving M iing
quarter rushing a cl. mce.
"Why not postpone rushir, 1 until
spring quarter whe.i mo-t people
play anyway?" she argued. Mi
Sumner declared that pledging di
vides the interests and authority rT
the freshmen during -:pring quarter.
The former head >112 Encina Hall
stated that the idea of n bin:.'
brought before the f.'esh nen i•. <11:-
diateiy before their fii ;1 sf>t oi final
examinations.
CHRISTMAS CONFLICT
Another of Mrs. Sumner', points
was that freshmen return afii-r
Christmas vacation and its jnanv
parties wanting to settle dv>wn with
their studying. "Instead, rushing be
gins and many oi the .student '
behind in their classes."
Wagner spoke on the problem of
illegal rushing and pledge breaking
as well as comparing the merits of
the two possible times.
The IFC president questioned tlv
audience as to the advantages of a
"concentrated pledge training against
an sometime l - hapha iu d
training."

and pledge meeting attendance 'ni:h,!
improve should rushing 1 Itche :
to the spring. He also st< <.d that
unity among the freshman c 1 a
would remain intact lon •« i if tin
time were to be changed,
LONGER CHOOSING
The question as to whether the
longer wait before rushing would
aid freshmen in ma J. ing b r
choices was advanced by Wagr. r.
The IFC chief declared that flm
making wrong choices would have
little time to reverse them.
ICC President Bob Webster
brought up the questions involving
the comparative costs of spring and
winter rushing, and the conflict with
other activities.
"Winter has the busier social cal
endar," Webster pointed out in <1:
cussing the latter problem. He h',' I
that many of the spring pa. ti> ai
closed affairs.
SPRING ACTIVITIES
The only unavoidable coinliel in
either quarter is basket! it. th JCC
president stated.
Webster also raised the;,.<■ .-'ion
as to whether spring overni' lit par
ties and pledge foi.nals could be
combined.
"Rushing costs would rcn.ain tl,
same, provided the present no v -
tion-rushing idea is held ove,"
Webster said. "With spring
rushing, houses and clubs would
have to serve pledges me !s foi on
half the length of time."
