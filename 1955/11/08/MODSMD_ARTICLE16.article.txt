# Horn Blows At Midday-- It's All Ours
## 
### 
The auditory senses of Stan
ford rooters were treated to the
baptismal blasts of a shiny new
air horn at the USC game Satur
day . . . and the air horn is
Stanford's to keep.
The mellifluous vibrations are the
handiwork of Don Neuman, a Stan
ford Theta Xi, who set out to pro
duce tone that would shame Smog
land's finest.
Where the disputed instrument
returned to UCLA a few weeks ago
operated on a mere 800 pounds of
air pressure, Neuman built the Stan
ford Ferdinand to bellow with the
force of 1800 pounds of pressure.
The gravitational effect on the tank
makes the horn almost theft-proof:
It just plain weighs too much.
The super decibel-maker has a
second big featureâ€”a loud and clear
wolf - whistle. Neuman added this
for the benefit "of the San Jose pom
pon girls and girls who wear blue
sweaters in the rooting section."
The horn will be complete this
weekend when it assumes a brilliant
red hue, in keeping with a local
preference for that color.
