# UCLA Returns The Megaphone
## 
### 
Stanford's megaphone, thought to
be a victim of an angered UCLA
rooting section, turned up in good
shape at the Coliseum last Saturday.
Head Yell Leader Jim Walters
said he was approached before the
game by UCLA's Dick Borun, who
returned the disputed megaphone in
"good" condition.
Walters said that information that
the horn had been hopelessly torn
in the UCLA rooting section had
been substantiated by UCLA as well
as Stanford rooters.
"I wasn't just saying it was ripped
to be saying it," Walters said.
Walters said that Borun was pro
fuse in his apologies for the manner
in which the battle of the mega
phone vs. air horn had been waged.
"He was just tremendous," said
Walters. If I were handling it, that's
the way I would have wanted it."
Borun also told Walters a plan to
make the air horn a permanent tro
phy for the winner of the UCLA
game was under serious considera
tion in the southland.
