# Frosh Need More Supplies to Build Big Game Blaze
## 
### 
The Big Game bonfire is without
support—wooden support.
Steve Ralph, bonfire chairman, to
day issued a call for long planks—
telephone poles, two by fours, two
by sixes and two by twelves, 10 feet
long or longer.
Anyone possessing pieces of lum
ber of that description may call the
ASSU office at DA 4-0591 between
9 a.m. and 5 p.m. daily, to arrange
pick-up service.
Ralph said that the bonfire work
ers also need a one-and-a-half ton
truck for picking up lumber. Anyone
willing to donate a truck to the
freshmen fire-builders may contact
Pete Swan at DA 3-8848.
