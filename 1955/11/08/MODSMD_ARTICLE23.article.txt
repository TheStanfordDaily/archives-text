## 
### 
Law enforcement officials from all
Midpeninsula cities are meeting here
today to divise a plan for coping
with the Big Game traffic.
As 90,000 persons are expected to
attend the game, officials believe that
traffic conditions will be the worst
of all time.
Robert Young, manager of opera
tions for the Department of Athletics
called a meeting for the group, "So
that each will know what the other
is going to do."
