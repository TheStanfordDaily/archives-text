Movement is strong on the Northwestern
campus to quit the Big Ten.
Under a banner headline "Quit Big Ten?" the
Daily Northv/estem advocates withdi awing
from the Big Ten and playing such schools as
Stanford, Princeton. Vanderbilt, Holy Cioss and
SMU.
The paper points out that the Northwestern
team lias won but three out of its last 23 games
and stands to have won one conference game
ct home in the last four years.
The paper points out that Northwestern is the
only private school in the conference and has
an enrollment of 7GOO which is the smallest in a
conference which averages 15,000.
The paper states, "Our scholastic standards
are admittedly the highest in the Big Ten. We
have no S3parate physical education school in
which the athletes can enroll. Good football
players, who would never get into Northwest
ern bccause of poor high school grades, go on
to become stars at other conference schools."
Instead of lowering its standards for athletes
and developing a real recruiting program, the
paper believes that the school should withdraw
from the conference, "there being no shame in
playing schools such as Stanford, a similarly
endowed private institution."
Stanford men's interest in San Tose pompon
girls and utter scorn of their own feminine
cheerleaders does not seem to be a unique
situation.
The Washington Daily describes the Oct. 29
game with Oregon State in this fashion,
" 'Mama, get me some of these.'
"When the Oregon State College dancing
song girls performed their bopping gyrations
before the fans in the double-decked stands
Saturday, Husky students looked in dismay at
the spectacle some 80 yards away.
"Following a verbal pleading never before
heard in the stadium, the girls diplomatically
sallied across to the ASUW seats, got into a
curvaceous line, put Bill Haley's shake platter
on the turntable and bopped to the utter delight
of the male gentry.
"Members of the Bachelor's Club were ready
to forsake their club rules, men were ready to
move closer to the field, and the 'darling danc
ers' were most happy to entertain.
"Both OSC and the University of Oregon
have such dancing song leaders. Perhaps the
old alma mater could raise the hemline a little
and keep our rooters' interest at home."

According to the Oregon Daily Emerald, the
University of Oregon may join Stanford in hav
ing a peripheral road system.
'I he pi op osal has been made for a road which
would completely by-pass tne campus. Under
this system no automobiles would be allowed
on the campus grounds. This system would
supersede the present plan whereby cars are
closed from the campus grounds just during
the 10 minutes between classes.
They're having trouble with rallies over at
Cal.
The Daily Califcrnian states, "Charges of
poor taste arose yesterday (Oct. 31) as ASUC
President Eob Hamilton and several students
charged that Berkeley's skit at the All-U Week
end rally was offensive.
"The skit in question dealt with the life of
University President Robert Gordon Sproul and
was presented at the Oct. 28 rally in Los An
geles. The term 'Ex-lax' was used several times
during the eight-minute performance."
"The skit I approved was changed," Hamil
ton stated. He said that the references to "Ex
lax" just "weren't in good taste, and the per
formers must have gotten carried away." He
added no action would be taken against the
committee.
University of Texas men have done last
year's Stanford goat-nappers one better â€”
they've captured Baylor's Bear.
According to the Daily Texan the bear-nap
ping was carried on with great ease. Last
Wednesday four students in a car plastered
with Baylor decals drove over to Waco.
Quick scouting showed that the bear's sen
tries had retired for the night. The lock on the
bear's cage was cu'. One whiff of a can of sar
dines, and the 100-pound cub jumped peace
fully into the back of the car.
The cub behaved well until the sardines were
gone. Then he decided to ride up in the front
seat. Before the students got back to the cam
pus the upholstery and trunk compartment lin
ing was slashed to ribbons.
The bear was first bedded down in a Uni
versity fraternity house, but he didn't stay long.
"Smells like hell" is the reason one of the cap
tors gave for moving him.
The bear, who v/as being well guarded, was
going to be returned to the Baylor team during
the halftime of their game with Texas Saturday.
