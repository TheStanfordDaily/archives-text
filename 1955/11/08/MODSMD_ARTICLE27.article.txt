. . . but not forgotten
To the Editor:
I think our gopher is dead.
For two weeks he fought to keep his home in the
plowed ground between the old and new Crothers
buildings intact. Each time the bulldozer closed his
hole during the day, he opened it at night. Then a
steam roller was brought to the aid of the bulldozer,
and it took our gopher two or three days to dig his
way to the surface.
Last Monday morning, a group of early-risers, re
turning from breakfast at Encina, watched a large
rock emerge from a fresh hole, teeter on its brink,
and then roll back again out of sight. Again and
again this rock appeared, only to roll back again.
A ring cf fresh earth surrounded the hole and served
as a blockade for the rock. Finally, a scrawny, scrag
gly, furry creatine with bulging eyes followed the
rock out of the nole and pushed it over the pile of
loose earth. He watched with a dignified attitude
of grim determination as the rock rolled down the
opposite side of the mound and away from his hole.
Then, still ignoring the quiet and appreciative audi
ence, he scampered back into his hole.
By noon Monday, the hole had been filled once
again, the roller had made a final run, and the first
layer of tar had been sprayed over the surface. Now
our gopher must dig his way, with his two front
troth, through a compacted layer of rock and tar. It
seems iniposisble. We have a nice, newly-tarred
space, the University has another housing project
nearing completion, the Bay Area continues to grow,
but I think our gopher is dead.

tremendous spirit
To the Editor:
On behalf of the yell leaders and Rally Com, I
would like to congratulate and thank the students
iri the rooting section at the SC game for the tre
mendous display of spirit. The spirit at this game
surpassed anything we have seen to date.
We would also like to post this as a warning to
both Oregon and Ca!—we have a great team, a great
coach and the spirit to back it up. We want the Axe
and we're going to get it.

two considerations
To the Editor:
Re: Article in Friday's Daily about the reopening
of Los Arboles Road, which runs in front of Lagunita.
Your article implies that the University officials
will decide the issue based solely on the poll taken
at Lag. I would like to suggest two more considera
tions: first and of vital importance, the safety of the
faculty children who live at the end of the road past
the hockey field; and secondly and of lesser impor
tance, the prevention of non-Stanford through traffic
from further congestion of and wear on our streets, i
The possibility of a mangled child's body weighs i
heavily against the few-minute advantage to Rudy's, i
There were two serious accidents on the street next i
to the Stadium Inst year which brought about the j
safety factor of a white line, painted after the acci
dents occurred—sort of a "lock the barn after the
horse is stolen" proposition. We can help prevent ac
cidents—especially to children—by keeping the road
in front of Lag blocked off like it is now.
From the traffic viewpoint, why reopen the road '
and invite more traffic on campus: This seems like 1
it is defeating the purpose of the Traffic Committee. !

gaieties purpose
To the Editor:
The purpose of Gaieties is to aid the spirit of Big
Game week, produce a show for Stanford students, .
and give experience to those students who work on ;
the show. A poor show does not fulfill any of these '
purposes. It is not fair to the student body, to the 1
students who work on Gaieties, or to future Gaieties !
to give a second-rate production.
Thus when the lack of interest on the part of stu- '
dents in producing Gaieties drops to the level it has \
in recent years, it is necessary to consider outsiders
on an equal basis with Stanford students when plan- !
ning the show. The soluiton is not for Ram's Head j
to change its policy at the expense of the show, but !
rather for Stanford students to support the show so !
outside talent will not be needed.
