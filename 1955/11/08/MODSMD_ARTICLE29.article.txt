# Geography Majors Put Stanford Area on Map

### JACK HANDLEY 
Armed with maps, special
pens and huge aerial photo
graphs, fourteen geography ma
jors set out last spring on a for
midable mission—to survey 200
square miles of the Santa Clara
Valley.
Splitting up into pairs the 'mem
bers oi' Robert N. Young's field tech
niques class headed south towkrd
the target —the northeast corner of
the valley.
One member of the team drove,
while the other sat beside him dili
gently filling in the pertinent data
op their 18 by 24 in. aerial photos.
All roads, houses, schools, orch
ards and fields were inked onto each
photograph which covered a four
square mile area. Since the aerial
photos, which were supplied by the
Santa Clara Planning Commission,
were of 1951 vintage, many changes
in topography had to be noted.
To locate specific types of crops,
grain, trees and brush the members
of ths expedition had to forsake
their automobiles in favor of wear
ing out a little shoe leather.
Interviews with farmers yielded
information on soils and land use
which was later used in term papers.
After 840 man hours, the project
ground to a halt. The results had
been tabulated and the information

was turned over to the Santa Clara
Valley Planning Commission.
The Planning Commission was to
use the data for aid in zoning land
for residential, agricultural, com
mercial and industrial use.
Already the value of the study has
been proven. The site for a new in
dustrial plant was decided upon after
an inspection of the survey results
revealed that a certain area had a
sufficient population concentration
to support a factory.
Another area north of San Jote
was zoned for agriculture on the
basis of the information gathered by
the students. The findings of the
survey may ultimately be used for
aid in road planning.
"Studies like the one just com
pleted are essential for making long
range plans for this rapidly growing
area," commented Assistant Profes
sor Robert N. Young of the Geogra
phy department.
