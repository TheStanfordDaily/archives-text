## 
### MARTHA HAUGHTON 
"The Stanford Y WCA is based
on the belief that the Christian
faith can meet the needs of
people on this campus and de
velop an awareness of others'
needs everywhere."
This is how Miriam Brattain, new
YWCA executive director, sums up
the purpose of the organization.

Our Stanford "Y" tries to do this
through its discussion groups and
service projects," continues Mi s s
Brattain.
Miss Brattain arrived at the Stan
ford "Y" this fall, replacing
Hansen.
"In 1956 the YWCA aims to con
tinue its present busy program with
increased membership, and, most
important, to work for campus un
derstanding of the "Y's" goals ami
progress," she announced.
The YWCA, Stanford's oldest or
ganization, opened its doors to Stan
ford's women early in the history oT
the University.
Since that time it has contributed
much to student life. From it have
grown the lIR, the pre-reg program,
the student workshop, student-fac
u 1 t y socials, student employment
service and the sponsor system. As
these projects have become inde
pendent, the Y has turned to other
needs.
The program this year includes
community service through the in
ter-racial playground, Girl Scouts,
Y-Teens and the Puerto-Rican Sun
day school.
On cajnpus, groups discuss public
affairs, religion, marriage and the
family.
"The door is always open at the
YWCA office," says Miss Brattain.
The office is on the third floor of
the Women's Clubhouse.
