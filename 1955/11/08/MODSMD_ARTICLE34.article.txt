STANFORD 28. SOUTHERN CAL 20
The Indians got their finest win of the season in this one. Supposedly
"the strongest team in the West," the Trojans found themselves beatable
not only by weather but also by a hard charging line, an alert pass defense
and a pinpoint passer.
Paul Wiggin, Chris Marshall and Tony Mosich anchored the fierce
Stanford line which completely handled the USC forward wall. Wiggin
time and again bulled through the Trojan forwards to foul up the Southern
Cal option play. Mosich was of such an aggressive demeanor that he had
to be forcibly restrained from returning to the game after it was feared
he had broken his jaw.
The Indian pass defense came to life for the first time this year. Stan
ford, which had intercepted only four enemy passes this season, picked
off five Trojan aerials. Fullback Bill Tarr iced the game for the Indians
with his third quarter interception which he returned 55 yards for a touch
down.
Coach Chuck Taylor had the Stanfords working on pass defense all
week to the surprise of many, and this really payed oil against the Trojans.
Quarterback John Brodie played his finest game as he completed 14
out of 2(i for 21(j yards and two touchdowns. So good was his protection
that not once did he get dumped behind the line of scrimmage; this after
UCLA coach Red Sanders predicted that the "Trojan line will eat Brodie
alive."
USC's "strongest team" is now apparently doomed to end the season
with a mediocre 5-5 record. They have lost three and have yet to face
UCLA and Notre Dame who, barring upset, should beat the Trojans.
Next for Stanford is Oregon. It should prove to be an interesting game
as the Ducks will bring the Coast's most powerful rushing offense up
against the strong Stanford line.
C ALIFORNIA 20 WASHINGTON (i
Cal picked off their second win of the season against a Washington
team which is apparently headed rapidly downhill after its early season
•successes.
The Huskies have scored only one touchdown in each of their last five
games and their offense looks worse in each outing. The core of the Wash
ington attack, the ground game, netted only G2 yards against Cal against
whom everyone else has had little trouble moving.
Another supposedly strong Washington asset, its defense, let the usually
impotent Cal attack through for 240 yards, 188 by rushing.
The Bears got considerable help from their midget halfback duo of
Donn Smith and Nat Brazill, each of whom weigh little more than 140
pounds. Between them, they gained (50 yards and gave the Huskies fits
with their darting tactics.
OREGON STATE 33, IDAHO 14
Tommy Prothro's Beavers continue to head for their best season since
1946 when Oregon State wound up second in the conference. The Beavers
now have a 4-1 record and have yet to face Cal and Oregon.
Oregon State showed good offensive punch despite injuries to star tail
back Joe Francis and tackle John Witte. Second-string tailback Ray West
fall took over and did an outstanding job, completing five passes in seven
attempts for 95 yards and keeping Idaho in the hole with his long punts.
The Beavers scored once on an eighty yard punt return by halfback
Dick Mason and again on a 32-yard pass from Westfall to little Sam
Wesley.
OREGON 35, WASHINGTON STATE 0
Oregon ripped through the Cougars despite the fact that the game was
played at Washington State and that the Cougars had vowed to come up
with a good performance for coach A] Kircher.
The Ducks have now won four straight, and ir. all four they have rolled
up over 300 yards on the ground. Against the Cougars, Oregon rambled
for 329 yards with fullback Jack Morris and halfback Jim Shanley leading
the way.
The Ducks ran up 28 points in the first half and then coasted in with
their reserves as Washington State never did threaten seriously to score
UCLA 34, COP 0
The game was not as one-sided as the score might indicate. COP did
a creditable job of moving through the vaunted Bruin line, picking up
117 yards along the ground.
Ronnie Knox turned in his best game of the season as he gained 55
yaids on seven running plays and 39 yards on four pass completions in
lour attempts. Knox also got off a prodigious quick kick that traveled
from his own 16 to the COP 2, a-distance of 82 yards.

OREGON STATE 33, IDAHO 14
Tommy Prothro's Beavers continue to head for their best season since
1946 when Oregon State wound up second in the conference. The Beavers
now have a 4-1 record and have yet to face Cal and Oregon.
Oregon State showed good offensive punch despite injuries to star tail
back Joe Francis and tackle John Witte. Second-string tailback Ray West
fall took over and did an outstanding job, completing five passes in seven
attempts for 95 yards and keeping Idaho in the hole with his long punts.
The Beavers scored once on an eighty yard punt return by halfback
Dick Mason and again on a 32-yard pass from Westfall to little Sam
Wesley.
OREGON 35, WASHINGTON STATE 0
Oregon ripped through the Cougars despite the fact that the game was
played at Washington State and that the Cougars had vowed to come up
with a good performance for coach A] Kircher.
The Ducks have now won four straight, and ir. all four they have rolled
up over 300 yards on the ground. Against the Cougars, Oregon rambled
for 329 yards with fullback Jack Morris and halfback Jim Shanley leading
the way.
The Ducks ran up 28 points in the first half and then coasted in with
their reserves as Washington State never did threaten seriously to score
UCLA 34, COP 0
The game was not as one-sided as the score might indicate. COP did
a creditable job of moving through the vaunted Bruin line, picking up
117 yards along the ground.
Ronnie Knox turned in his best game of the season as he gained 55
yaids on seven running plays and 39 yards on four pass completions in
lour attempts. Knox also got off a prodigious quick kick that traveled
from his own 16 to the COP 2, a-distance of 82 yards.

STANFORD 28. SOUTHERN CAL 20
The Indians got their finest win of the season in this one. Supposedly
"the strongest team in the West," the Trojans found themselves beatable
not only by weather but also by a hard charging line, an alert pass defense
and a pinpoint passer.
Paul Wiggin, Chris Marshall and Tony Mosich anchored the fierce
Stanford line which completely handled the USC forward wall. Wiggin
time and again bulled through the Trojan forwards to foul up the Southern
Cal option play. Mosich was of such an aggressive demeanor that he had
to be forcibly restrained from returning to the game after it was feared
he had broken his jaw.
The Indian pass defense came to life for the first time this year. Stan
ford, which had intercepted only four enemy passes this season, picked
off five Trojan aerials. Fullback Bill Tarr iced the game for the Indians
with his third quarter interception which he returned 55 yards for a touch
down.
Coach Chuck Taylor had the Stanfords working on pass defense all
week to the surprise of many, and this really payed oil against the Trojans.
Quarterback John Brodie played his finest game as he completed 14
out of 2(i for 21(j yards and two touchdowns. So good was his protection
that not once did he get dumped behind the line of scrimmage; this after
UCLA coach Red Sanders predicted that the "Trojan line will eat Brodie
alive."
USC's "strongest team" is now apparently doomed to end the season
with a mediocre 5-5 record. They have lost three and have yet to face
UCLA and Notre Dame who, barring upset, should beat the Trojans.
Next for Stanford is Oregon. It should prove to be an interesting game
as the Ducks will bring the Coast's most powerful rushing offense up
against the strong Stanford line.
