tion, 36-14, in a played in
San Diego Saturday afternoon.

run of the day, returning an inter
cepted lateral f>2 yards for a touch

Bob Gergen was second in this
department, as he returned an inter
cepted pass 51 yards for another

even more than the score shows, as
they had two touchdowns called
back, and lost the ball on fumbles
four times.
Jack Lewis, the Braves' quarter-

teen passes to lead the Braves in
their offensive thrust.
Chuck Shea was the workhorse on
the ground, carrying the ball 13
times and gaining 105 yards. Shea
scored twice, but both times the
score was called back due to pen
alties.

ego's 11, and they gained a total of
377 yards to the host's 291.

Lewis, and Jeffries on a two yard
plunge.
