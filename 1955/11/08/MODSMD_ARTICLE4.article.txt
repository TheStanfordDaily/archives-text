### 
Democratic education is the
| one way to save a democratic
society in Japan, Monkichi Nam
ba, president of Kobe Women's
College in Japan, stated yester
day at an ESPRI meetina.
According to Namba, the .Japanese
people have lost hope and faith.
They are interested however in try
ing to renovate society and especial
ly in aspects of social economy.
The Japanese university is a bat
tleground of ideologies. Dr. Namba
stated. There are many communist
and socialist professors who preach
their doctrines in class.
Some departments have two types
of lecture on the same subject. One
professor will teach Marxist eco
nomics, while another takes the capi
talist viewpoint. Sociologists may
study Russian class structure or the
American status system.
NamK:\ stated that the number of
communist students is not large, but
they work from morning until night.
They are also very noisy, while the
democratic students tend to be quiet
and say nothing.
According to Namba, the teachers'
union in Japan is very strong. They
control most phases of education
from salary to school policy. Deans
ana presidents are mere figureheads.
If they disagree with "progressive"
ideas they are called reactionary.
Another problem in Japanese
schools, said Dr. Namba, is the over
crowded conditions. Some colleges
are able to take only one out of 20
applicants. Most schools have 10,000
to 20,000 students, running from kin
dergarten to university age.
This situation hr-: come about
I' rough the great stock that Jap-
I anese place on education, Namba
! stated. People consider schooling the
best investment for their children.
The Japanese have 99 per cent
literacy, higher than that of the
United States, Namba said with a
grin. They believe that while pos
session® can be lost during a war
education will always remain.
Increase in automation in Japan
has made jobs very hard to find for
college graduates, he said. Techno
logical unemployment is a great
problem, and only medical and en
gineering graduates are certain to
get employment.
Namba believes that foreign trade
must improve to relieve the job situ
| ation. At present there are three
people doing one person's work be
l cause of an overcrowded population.
He sj> id that the two main jobs of
Japanese education are to develop
J the i' »""ect and teach freedom. He
thinks that women, especially, must
| be taught to use the rights which
] they have obtained the Jap-
I anese constitution.

NamK:\ stated that the number of
communist students is not large, but
they work from morning until night.
They are also very noisy, while the
democratic students tend to be quiet
and say nothing.
According to Namba, the teachers'
union in Japan is very strong. They
control most phases of education
from salary to school policy. Deans
ana presidents are mere figureheads.
If they disagree with "progressive"
ideas they are called reactionary.
Another problem in Japanese
schools, said Dr. Namba, is the over
crowded conditions. Some colleges
are able to take only one out of 20
applicants. Most schools have 10,000
to 20,000 students, running from kin
dergarten to university age.
This situation hr-: come about
I' rough the great stock that Jap-
I anese place on education, Namba
! stated. People consider schooling the
best investment for their children.
The Japanese have 99 per cent
literacy, higher than that of the
United States, Namba said with a
grin. They believe that while pos
session® can be lost during a war
education will always remain.
Increase in automation in Japan
has made jobs very hard to find for
college graduates, he said. Techno
logical unemployment is a great
problem, and only medical and en
gineering graduates are certain to
get employment.
Namba believes that foreign trade
must improve to relieve the job situ
| ation. At present there are three
people doing one person's work be
l cause of an overcrowded population.
He sj> id that the two main jobs of
Japanese education are to develop
J the i' »""ect and teach freedom. He
thinks that women, especially, must
| be taught to use the rights which
] they have obtained the Jap-
I anese constitution.

Democratic education is the

society in Japan, Monkichi Nam

College in Japan, stated yester
day at an ESPRI meetina.
According to Namba, the .Japanese
people have lost hope and faith.
They are interested however in try
ing to renovate society and especial
ly in aspects of social economy.
The Japanese university is a bat
tleground of ideologies. Dr. Namba
stated. There are many communist
and socialist professors who preach
their doctrines in class.
Some departments have two types
of lecture on the same subject. One
professor will teach Marxist eco
nomics, while another takes the capi
talist viewpoint. Sociologists may
study Russian class structure or the
American status system.
