# Wolverines, Bruins Lead In Bowl Race
## 
### 
As the Rose Eowl race comes i
down to the final wire, it be- I
comes increasingly apparent
that UCLA will represent the Pa
cific Coast Conference against
either Michigan or Michigan
State from the Big Ten in the
New Year's Day classic.
The only challenger to the Bruins
is Oregon State. The Beavers have
lost only one game but that was to
UCLA; consequently the Bruins
would probably have to lose their
final two games to Washington and
USC to lose the bid,
BUCKEYES LEAD
Back in the Big Ten, the picture
is more jumbled. Ohio State actu
ally leads the conference with a 4-0
record, but the Buckeyes are ineligi
ble for the Bowl bid because they
appeared in it last year.
Michigan and Michigan State with
identical 4-1 records are tied for
second. Michigan's only loss came
last Saturday against Illinois while
the Spartans lost an early season
game to Michigan.
MSC STRONGER?
However, there are many observ
ers who feel that Michigan State is
now the st longer team because of
their tremendous improvement this
season compared to Michigan's
apparent stagnancy.
Michigan State has the easier
schedule coming up. The Spartans
face Minnesota, a conference weak
sister, and outsider Marquette. The
Wolverines meet Indiana Saturday
and, in the final g&me of the season,
they come up against Ohio State in
a game which will probably decide
the Big Ten championship as well
as the Rose Bowl representative.
