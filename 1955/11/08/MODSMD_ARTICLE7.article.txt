# ABC Will 'Concentrate Where Need Is Greatest'
## 
### 
"We will be enforcing the
law," Frank Fullenwider, area
administrator for the Depart
[ ment of Alcoholic Beverage
Control, said yesterday."And
we will try to hit the places
! where the need is greatest."
Fullenwider wouldn't say that the
ABC's enforcement policy would be
i more stringent than that of the old
! liquor-law enforcement agency, the
Board of Equalization. He just said
the law would be enforced.
Fullenwider said that ABC pa
trols have been active in this area
during the last two weekends: "All
the places were orderly while we
were there."
He said that the ABC will "hit"
bars and package liquor dealers
"from time to time as the need indi
cates."
The ABC visited Rossotti's last
Friday and also the previous week
end and found few people present
and everything in order, Fullen
wider said.
The hearing about the incident of
serving a minor at Rossotti's last
month isn't expected to come up
until January. Until that time, at
least, the beer garden will retain its
liquor license.
"Our hearing schedule is filled for
the rest of November," Fullenwider

I said, "and we won't schedule the
] case until Jerome Jeffries, the key
[ witness, is available."
Fullenwider thinks Jeffries has re
j turned to his Los Angeles home after
J being suspended for the quarter by
! Men's Council for purchasing liquor
I under age.
Fullenwider expressed approval of
J the Men's Council action. He thinks
the system of turning over student
; violators to the University is a good
I policy and wants to "give it a try."
"Our purpose is to secure observ
| ance of the law," he said. "In pur-
I suit of that purpose we will take ad
j vantage of any ways open to us.
"We are perfectly willing to fore
go on-the-spot arrest in cases where
the .man is a university student and
is co-operative. There is nothing to
i be gained by bringing him to trial
; and establishing a permanent crimi
j nal record for a first offense." .
Fullenwider didn't thin'.: there
was any particular problem with
Stan.ord students—just with college
students in general. He said the dif
ficulty is with the 17-21 age group,
which is away from home for the
first time.
He emphasized that there are
three points of law which are vio
lated in most cases: purchase of liq
uor by an under-age person, pos
session of liquor by an under-age
person in a public place, and posses
sion of a false identification card.

students in general. He said the dif
ficulty is with the 17-21 age group,
which is away from home for the
first time.
He emphasized that there are
three points of law which are vio
lated in most cases: purchase of liq
uor by an under-age person, pos
session of liquor by an under-age
person in a public place, and posses
sion of a false identification card.
"We will be enforcing the
law," Frank Fullenwider, area
administrator for the Depart
[ ment of Alcoholic Beverage
Control, said yesterday."And
we will try to hit the places
! where the need is greatest."
Fullenwider wouldn't say that the
ABC's enforcement policy would be
i more stringent than that of the old
! liquor-law enforcement agency, the
Board of Equalization. He just said
the law would be enforced.
Fullenwider said that ABC pa
trols have been active in this area
during the last two weekends: "All
the places were orderly while we
were there."
He said that the ABC will "hit"
bars and package liquor dealers
"from time to time as the need indi
cates."
The ABC visited Rossotti's last
Friday and also the previous week
end and found few people present
and everything in order, Fullen
wider said.
The hearing about the incident of
serving a minor at Rossotti's last
month isn't expected to come up
until January. Until that time, at
least, the beer garden will retain its
liquor license.
"Our hearing schedule is filled for
the rest of November," Fullenwider

I said, "and we won't schedule the
] case until Jerome Jeffries, the key
[ witness, is available."
Fullenwider thinks Jeffries has re
j turned to his Los Angeles home after
J being suspended for the quarter by
! Men's Council for purchasing liquor
I under age.
Fullenwider expressed approval of
J the Men's Council action. He thinks
the system of turning over student
; violators to the University is a good
I policy and wants to "give it a try."
"Our purpose is to secure observ
| ance of the law," he said. "In pur-
I suit of that purpose we will take ad
j vantage of any ways open to us.
"We are perfectly willing to fore
go on-the-spot arrest in cases where
the .man is a university student and
is co-operative. There is nothing to
i be gained by bringing him to trial
; and establishing a permanent crimi
j nal record for a first offense." .
Fullenwider didn't thin'.: there
was any particular problem with
Stan.ord students—just with college
students in general. He said the dif
ficulty is with the 17-21 age group,
which is away from home for the
