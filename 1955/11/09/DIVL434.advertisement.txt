Learning the words of all the latest popular songs—as anyone
must who wants to amount to anything on campus — becomes
more and more difficult. Take last night. I had the radio on
for no more than five minutes, and in that time heard two brand
spanking new songs—a jump tune called Rock With Me, Hymie
and a hillbilly ballad called They're Hanging Ralph T. Sigafoos
at Cock-crow.
And that's the way it goes. New tunes are absolutely flooding
the market. No wonder you're having trouble memorizing all
the lyrics.
But you don't have to be dull about it. I mean, when a song is
playing and you don't know the lyrics, don't just stand there #
singing dum, dum, de, dum or la, la, la or voom voom. That is
very dull. Pick more interesting syllables-like slimp gans or
kretch dinkle or mlath roke.
Take, for instance, That Old Black Magic. Let's say you
forirot some of the lyrics. Try singing this:
That old kretch dinkle
Has me in its mlath,
That old kretch dinkle,
That I slimp so gans,
Those icy dinkles
Running down my slimp,
That old kretch dinkle
When your roke meets mine ... etc.
See? Interesting? What did I tell you?
But knowing the lyrics-or interesting substitutes—is not nearly
enough. To really rate on campus, you must also V acquainted
with odd and interesting facts about the composers. For example:
1. Irving Berlin's name spelled backwards is Gnivri Nilreb.
2. Rodgers and Hammerstein can only write music while
whitewashing a fence.
u. Ludwig von Beethoven's hobby was collecting cold sores.
4. One of our greatest songs was written because the wife
of an impecunious composer came home one afternoon with a
"unteloupe and a dog named Lassie. "Why did you bring home a
canteloupe and a dog named Lassie?" said the composer to his
wife. "For the baby," she replied. The composer grew angry.
"Here we arc flat broke," he cried, "and you come home with
a melon for the baby, a collie for the baby!" Suddenly, struck by
an inspiration, he rushed to the piano and wrote Melancholy
Baby.

Learning the words of all the latest popular songs—as anyone
must who wants to amount to anything on campus — becomes
more and more difficult. Take last night. I had the radio on
for no more than five minutes, and in that time heard two brand
spanking new songs—a jump tune called Rock With Me, Hymie
and a hillbilly ballad called They're Hanging Ralph T. Sigafoos
at Cock-crow.
And that's the way it goes. New tunes are absolutely flooding
the market. No wonder you're having trouble memorizing all
the lyrics.
But you don't have to be dull about it. I mean, when a song is
playing and you don't know the lyrics, don't just stand there #
singing dum, dum, de, dum or la, la, la or voom voom. That is
very dull. Pick more interesting syllables-like slimp gans or
kretch dinkle or mlath roke.
Take, for instance, That Old Black Magic. Let's say you
forirot some of the lyrics. Try singing this:
That old kretch dinkle
Has me in its mlath,
That old kretch dinkle,
That I slimp so gans,
Those icy dinkles
Running down my slimp,
That old kretch dinkle
When your roke meets mine ... etc.
See? Interesting? What did I tell you?
But knowing the lyrics-or interesting substitutes—is not nearly
enough. To really rate on campus, you must also V acquainted
with odd and interesting facts about the composers. For example:
1. Irving Berlin's name spelled backwards is Gnivri Nilreb.
2. Rodgers and Hammerstein can only write music while
whitewashing a fence.
u. Ludwig von Beethoven's hobby was collecting cold sores.
4. One of our greatest songs was written because the wife
of an impecunious composer came home one afternoon with a
"unteloupe and a dog named Lassie. "Why did you bring home a
canteloupe and a dog named Lassie?" said the composer to his
wife. "For the baby," she replied. The composer grew angry.
"Here we arc flat broke," he cried, "and you come home with
a melon for the baby, a collie for the baby!" Suddenly, struck by
