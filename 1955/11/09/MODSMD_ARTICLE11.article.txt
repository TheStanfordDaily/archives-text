# Sets, Effects For Gaieties To Get Trial
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
, Tonight is "tech night" for
Gaieties — the first run-through
with sets, lights, and costumes.
This afternoon, before things get
under way, a group of Palo Alto
High drama students will take a
preview look.
The occasion is the second of a
series of goodwill tours sponsored
this year by Ram's Head: tours de
signed to acquaint students with
what really goes into a college show.
As always, a great deal of what
goes into it is the technical job.
"Sets," assistant technical director
Bob Levin said, "don't come ready
built; special effects don't just hap
pen."
ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT
Not that the show will be lacking
in special effects. Ultraviolet light is
used for the first time—a novelty
number with fluorescent painted ob
jects apparently floating through
space.
"Then," Levin said, "we have
stereophonic sound, an eight-foot
high bear's head, and an 18-foot
Maypole from which six people
swing."
Designers and technical people
around Gaieties in general are all
talking in superlatives.
YARDS OF RIBBON
One scene utilizes 250 yards of
varicolored ribbon; another features,
in refurbished form, "Of Thee I
Sing's" "juggernaut," the largest
(16xl2x9-ft.) single rolling unit ever
built at Stanford. This piece carries
the entire cast for the finale.
Set designer Dave O'Brien pointed
out a variety of techniques and in
fluences.
"One of the scenes," he said, "the
cocktail party, is all done with sur
face. A comic - strippish effect —
slightly satiric—with lots of color
and line.
DEPTH
"Then, in another number, we've
gone for depth. Many different lev
els of playing areas, each defined by
light and shadow, arranged more or
less abstractly."
Other sets include a nursery
school out of Mondrian and the out
side window of a modern skyscraper
done in a more realistic vein.
There is still an opportunity, ac
cording to technical director Bob
Brand, for students interested in
working backstage during the actual
show time to do so.
Persons interested in backstage
crews or in the costume crew may
report backstage at Mem Aud any
week night between 7 and 10.
