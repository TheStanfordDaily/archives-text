# Series Speaker Sees Behavior Study Advance
## Tyler Cites 5 Changes In Psychology Outlook 
### STEW TOY 
Behavioral scientists are mak
ing five major advances in the
study of human behavior, Dr.
Rcflph W. Tyler told a Memorial
Auditorium audience at last
night's Tuesday Evening Series.
They are:
1) Re-asessment of motivations in
individual actions.
2) Correlation of sccial group
pressures to individual actions.
3) Ee-eva!uation of theories of
perception.
4) Re-evaluation of communica
tion as related to perception.
5) Study of individual methods of
problem-solving.
Tyler, director of the Ford Foun
dation's Center for Advanced Stud
ies in the Behavioral Sciences, said
social scientists have previously as
sumed human beings are "moved
like pawns" by biological drives.
"DYNAMIC ORGANISM"
Researchers have now come to
view man as more of a "dynamic
organism." He is "directed also by
values, purposes and goals," which
are usually stronger even than bio
logical urges.
An individual's self-concept is of
prime importance in any evaluation
of his actions. "To understand any
individual," Tyler sad. "we need to
know who he thinks he is."
Social groups play an important
part in an individual's actions, he
said. Groups are governed by one
recognized purpose, the only reason
for their existence. Individuals, by
contributing to group thought, in
evitably orignt their actions to those
of the group.
COMMUNICATION
Behaviorists are concentrating
more and more on communication,
as related to perception. People
rarely understand intended meaning
in mass media, Tyler said.
This is due either to the commu
nicator not putting in the proper
meaning or the individual "reading
into it ideas and feelings which are
harmonious with his previous no
tions" on a subject.
Tyler feels modern education fails
students in the realm of problem
solving. People think of problem
solving as merely getting the an
swers from some omniscient author
ity. He calls this failing the "$64,000
Question notion."
UNIQUENESS OF INDIVIDUAL
To correct this error, he said, edu
cators must avoid their present
course of seeing only the "stereo
typed child."
They must search for and capital
ize on "the variety and uniqueness
of the individual."
Tyler preceded his main topic by
sketching the workings of the be
havioral science center of which he
is executive head.
The Center was founded in 1952
on a live-year trial basis. It oper
ates on a Ford Foundation grant of
$3.5 million.
