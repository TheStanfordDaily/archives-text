### JACK BYRNE 
Dr. Xavier Conde, Directoi of
the Institute for Political Studio .
at the University of Madrid, told
a Stanford seminar yesterd iy
/•hat the manner in which the
franco government came to
Spain was irrelevant to its pur
pose.
Dr. Conde based his argument on
the'terms that a country exist in
terms of the aspirations of its peo|>;i
and that the legitimacy of a govern
ment is determined by the way it.
represents these aspirations.
The Franco regime in Spain i
representative of these aspiration
according to Conde, and the way li
government came to power h;.
nothing to do with its legitimacy.
Concfe's Institute for Politic-:; L
Studies at the University of Madri I
serves in an advisory capacity to tho
Franco government.
The visiting professor told a semi ■
nar in Hispanic-American relation
that the Spanish government wa
not based on the theory of popu
sovereignty, as postulated by Lorl«
and reflected in Great Britain and
the United States.
Conde asserted that Spanish gov
ernment was based on Hobb's "L< -
viathan."
During his visit on the Stanford
campus, Dr. Conde toured the Stan
ford Research Institute and the Con

Sciences.
The visiting professor has born
making a tour of such center .s
throughout the United States.
