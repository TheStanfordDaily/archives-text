# Campus Social Activities Topic For Student-Faculty Debate
## 
### 
"Are Social Activities on the Stanford Campus Overestimated?"
will be the topic of a student-faculty debate tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.
in Cubberley.
Professor Wilfred Stone will introduce the topic. Professor Stone
wrote an article for The Daily on the subject of overemphasis of
student activities several weeks ago.*

Students Dave Jenks and Phil Ol
son will present differing points of
view. After stating their ideas, these
speakers will be given an opportu
nity to question each other.
The program will then be open
for audience participation and, ac
cording to the Speech Association,
"anything will go." The only limi
tations are that no one will speak
more than three minutes, and stu
dents who have not yet voiced their
opinions will be given preference
over those who have already spoken.
This will be the first in a series
of discussions entitled "Campus Con
troveries," sponsored by the Stanford
Speech Association. It will last no
more than one hour.
Students will be able to meet Pro
fessor Stone and discuss with him
his opinions concerning campus ac
tivities.
The Speech Association requests
the audience to sit in the following
manner: those who favor activities
on the right, those opposed on the
left, and those undecided in the cen
ter.
"This discussion will be a chal
lenge for Stanford students to defend
their opinion in open debate. It will
be a test of what Stanford students
really think about activities," said
Mark Hawkins of the Speech Asso
ciation.
