in joining ski club and learning of
its many benefits should try by all
means to come to this meeting."
He also stated that all individuals
interested in trying for Stanford ski
team or working on the ski patrol
at Squaw Valley should definitely
be there.

ski instructors.

members who desire rides to the
slopes during the snow season will
