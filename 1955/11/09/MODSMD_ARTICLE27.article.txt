# you guessed it—bureaucracy

### 
Things are never as bad as they seem—or
lo the saying goes. Scmetimes, howeve. they
are worse.
For example: In these pages last month, Pro
fessor Wilfred Stone courageously attacked a
number of fall quarter's lifeless activities and
"wilting" traditions. Response was prompt and
in accord with Professor Stone's sentiments.
Let's digress, let's go back to last spring.
George Ralph was tossed into the ASSU presi
dency midst a campus furor. Clean up the bu
reaucracy in student government. Down with
the com-coms. These thingc Ralph advocated,
and the voters agreed.
Thus Professor Stone's comments brought
the old campaign issues back into the rare glare
of student interest. Perhaps the approach was
a bit different —activities instead of committees
-but ths essentials were the same: chop away
the excess growth before it smothers what still
lives.
So now we get another committee. Since
this is a committee to study and evaluate ac
tivities, the irritatihg fact that it is another com
mittee per se can be overlooked.
So now we have a committee that is actually
going to do something, that is going to find out
what has been dead around here for so long,

that is going to get everything leady for "Burial
Day."
Or do we?
Read the statement of Jack Richardson, chair
man of Activities Evaluation Com: "The com
mittee . . . will deal with the theory of activities
and their relation to academic life; but such a
small segment of the Stanford student body has
no right to criticize specific events or to try to
initiate reform."
We thought this committee was set up by the
Legislature to deal with reform . . . and to hell
with theory only.
We thought a small group was the ideal. The
first requirement is efficiency; you get the op
posite with bulk.
What's more, this is a republican form of
government we have, a representative system.
The Legislature, which represents all the stu
dents, has appointed a committee of its own
representatives to investigate. That committee
has the right to criticize and to suggest reform.
The Legislature has the power to act.
Yes, now we have another committee. Yes,
from all appearances it's a study group to com
pile data to which activity-planners can refer.
More bureaucracy.
Let's do something, or let's forget the whole
matter and crawl back into our own little.holes
forever.

and the voters agreed.
Thus Professor Stone's comments brought
the old campaign issues back into the rare glare
of student interest. Perhaps the approach was
a bit different —activities instead of committees
-but ths essentials were the same: chop away
the excess growth before it smothers what still
lives.
So now we get another committee. Since
this is a committee to study and evaluate ac
tivities, the irritatihg fact that it is another com
mittee per se can be overlooked.
So now we have a committee that is actually
going to do something, that is going to find out
what has been dead around here for so long,

that is going to get everything leady for "Burial
Day."
Or do we?
Read the statement of Jack Richardson, chair
man of Activities Evaluation Com: "The com
mittee . . . will deal with the theory of activities
and their relation to academic life; but such a
small segment of the Stanford student body has
no right to criticize specific events or to try to
initiate reform."
We thought this committee was set up by the
Legislature to deal with reform . . . and to hell
with theory only.
We thought a small group was the ideal. The
first requirement is efficiency; you get the op
posite with bulk.
What's more, this is a republican form of
government we have, a representative system.
The Legislature, which represents all the stu
dents, has appointed a committee of its own
representatives to investigate. That committee
has the right to criticize and to suggest reform.
The Legislature has the power to act.
Yes, now we have another committee. Yes,
from all appearances it's a study group to com
pile data to which activity-planners can refer.
More bureaucracy.
Let's do something, or let's forget the whole
matter and crawl back into our own little.holes
forever.
Things are never as bad as they seem—or
lo the saying goes. Scmetimes, howeve. they
are worse.
For example: In these pages last month, Pro
fessor Wilfred Stone courageously attacked a
number of fall quarter's lifeless activities and
"wilting" traditions. Response was prompt and
in accord with Professor Stone's sentiments.
Let's digress, let's go back to last spring.
George Ralph was tossed into the ASSU presi
dency midst a campus furor. Clean up the bu
reaucracy in student government. Down with
the com-coms. These thingc Ralph advocated,
and the voters agreed.
