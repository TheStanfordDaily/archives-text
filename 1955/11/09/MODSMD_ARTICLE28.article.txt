a taxpayer suggests
To the Editor:
Finding myself in the position of a taxpayer sup
porting the LASSU, and an ex-ardent campaigner for
our president, the terrifying responsibility thrust upon
me by my status leads me to make a few timid sugges
tions. 1 can only hope that they have the same impact
as most of the other multifarious agitations current on
our amazing campus.
Since we now have a committee co-ordinating the
committees, and a committee studying the committees,
and a committee evaluating the activities sponsored by
the committees, it would seem only logical to form a
group of students into a committee to study and eval
uate the study and evaluation committees. It could
only be called the Eval Com of Eval Corns. It in turn
could be studied by all majors in Abnormal Psychol
ogy.
But I realize that all of the legislators must be too
busy with committee work to pass a resolution forming
this group. As an alternative, I humbly set down a few
thoughts which might at least ease the guilt complex
of our legislators when they find themselves unable to
create another vitally needed outlet for the adminis
trative urges of a miniscule minority of the student
body. These ideas are simple, and they follow an un
heard-of logical train of thought.
They are: That it is entirely possible that there is
no paradox in the cries of "Apathy" and "We want
reform," one coming from the leaders and the other
coming from the theoretically led; each claiming gross
malpractice on the part of the other. That the theoreti
cally led are merely expressing their desire to be left
alone to pursue other mundane matters such as the
academic disciplines, or sleeping in the sun. That the
cry of "Reform" is merely one of fear, fear of suddenly
linrling their whole collegiate lives enmeshed in the
web of committee politics and functions which they
have done little to encourage.
The system of limited student government exists,
and bccause it exists, the places within it will always
be filled by the minority of students who find no
greater pleasure than in legislating, administrating,
and dictating to the rest of their fellows. That these
students are a minority is witnessed by using only one
example of many, that not occasionally there is only
one candidate for an office when hundreds, or thou
sands, are eligible. This minority has a certain right
to its functions, but it has no more rights than the
majority of students who wish to be left alone, who
do not want to be prodded into activities, and who do
not like being castigated for not doing something they
did not care for, or about, in the first place. Neither
do they like an attempt on the part of a minority to
place a social stigma upon them for not engaging in
the activities the minority feels are important.
Robert Frost said, "I have always held that it is the
inalienable right of every man to go to hell in any
way he pleases." But Frost is a poet, not a politician,
and his opinion may be passed over by those who are
so busy running that they have no time to stop and
look around.

ram s head heresy
To the Editor:
I say, Bill Burke! What is this "strenuous campaign
1 ngaged in by this year's Gaieties staff to . . . seduce
. . . Stanford talent"? No wonder those sweet fresh
man girls—with or without talent—are afraid to show
their innocent li'l' faces around Mem Aud at tryout
time (does FunStanCom know about this?)!
Seriously, Bill, having spent no small amount of
time and energy as one of the Ram's Heads a few
years back, I appreciate the trials and tribulations in
volved in finding script material, actors and techni
cians and then molding them into a show. In exactly
your position just five years ago, those of us on the
Gaieties production staff thought more than once ol
importing talent to add polish to a sagging show.
But we were successors to a Ram's Head "Golden
Ago" that had seen an extraordinary surplus of Stan
ford talent in and around Mem Aud. Stanford stu
dents—and ONLY Stanford students—had made the
shows click from the first script idea to the final cur
lain. It seemed almost heretical, therefore, even to

think of going outside the University for talent. Of
course, there may have been a certain amount of
pride, too, in our feeling that we could STILL put on
a good show ourselves, despite the then prevailing
dearth of talent.
However, it seems that ever so slowly a change has
come about in the thinking of the old Ram. It might
well be likened to the change that has come about in
college football. Slowly, people have forsaken the
theory that the activity is primarily for the educa
tional development of the participants, and only inci
dentally for the benefit of the spectators. The feeling
seems now to be that the participants are performing
solely for the benefit of the spectators—and, further
more, the performance "had better damn well be first
class or heads will roll!"
Therefore, every show must be a hit. Each Gaieties
must be even better than the last. "If this doesn't
happen.'' I was told in 1950, "people will soon stop
coming to Gaieties; and then Ram's Head may start
losing money." . . , But here again, is the purpose
of Ram's Head to make money—or to help Stanford
students learn about the theater and dramatics?
I submit that Ihe dramatic endeavors of Stanford
students should be viewed in the same light as their
athletic endeavors. . . . People understand that tal
ent on both teams runs in cycles You can't ALWAYS
field a Rose Bowl champion; you can't ALWAYS pre
sent a smash hit Gaieties If you "don't have the
horses" one year, you just do the best you can and
try to build toward a winner in one 01* two years.
Bill, with a weakness in the Big Red's line, would
you suggest that we import one or two outstanding
San Jose State students to insure our having a "smash
hit" football team?
And with a weakness in the Gaieties chorus line
?

alien elements
To the Editor:
My sincere congratulations on a startling expose
of alien elements in Ram's Head. Real solid stuff just
like what I read in Confidential and Rave. One harm
less ?.nd talented refugee from San Jose has ente/ed
into a production along with several hundred Stan
ford students. Perhaps Senator McCarthy would be
interested.
In my three years at Stanford I have directed one
Gaieties, two Spring Shows and other assorted pro
ductions for Ram's Head. During that time I have
used the various talents of a cook, a real estate sales
man, the wife of a professor, a bookie, a student from
Northwestern, a chorus girl from a San Francisco
nightclub, the wife of a professor and Guisseppe
Verdi. All of them proved entertaining to an audi
ence and to those in the shows.
I would star the California Bear if it helped to
accomplish the aims of Ram's Head which are these:
to bring entertainment to its audience, enjoyment to
those who participate, and knowledge and experience
to all who are interested. We do not limit our audi
ence to students and we do not limit our production
to students. Mr. George Gershwin wrote last year's
Spring Show and Mr. Cole Porter wrote the previous
one. I'm sure the talents of these gentlemen were
duly appreciated.
If a Stanford student is interested in a Rani's Head
show, we welcome him or her with open arms, we
rejoice, we light candles, we sing hymns. No one
with any grain of talent has ever purposely been
turned down by Ram's Head. In the last few years
over a thousand Stanford students have participated
in and profited from Ram's Head shows. Not to men
tion an audience of tens of thousands.
We are continually searching the campus for all
available material and interested people, but when
a talented person from outside Stanford comes to us
and we feel it is in the interest of the audience, the
show and those participating in the show to utilize
the talents of this person, we use them.
Ram's Head has a debt to its audience and to its
cast to give them the best it has to offer—the best
show, the best talent and the best good time. When
it fails to do this, then write your expose. In fact,
I'll write it.
