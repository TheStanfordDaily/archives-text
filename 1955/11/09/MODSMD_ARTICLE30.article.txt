# MOVIE REVIEW
## Vista Vision Reviewer Records Strange Sights 
### RICHARD MENDE 
I am a camera, a VistaViÂ«ion
camera. No star is too big, no
talent too small, no plot too old
for me to record. Look at "The
Girl Rush." There is a threat
en e d mortgage foreclosure, a
rich man having a romance with
a poor girl, a musical on the
brink of success or failure when
the star walks out, a gambling
casino being built up and one
being burned down, people lost
in a forest, and a dumb bul beau
tiful blonde who exclaims,
whole herd of buffalo! Gee, I
wish I'd brought a bigger cam
era."
Material enough for seven shows.
And in that same picture I re
corded some very funny scenes like
a woman kicking a man in the shins
while they are dancing, and an old
man having dust blown in his face,
and well, I just can't remember what
all. But I do recollect that Rosalind
Russell started scintillating at one
end of that movie and eighty-five
minutes later she was still smiling
and grinning away, and not a bit
tired from it.
I like being a Vista Vision camera.
Many old-fashioned pictures relied
on plot, characterization, dialogue
and all that. Not me. Take ' Lucy
Gallant" for example. It has n't
enough of any of those things worth
mentioning. But it's got a fashion
show in my Vista Vision color, and

pictures of oil wells giving oil, and
plain ordinary Texas lolk just sorta
walking around a good bit not doing
much of anything connected with
anything.
There were Governor Allan Shiv
ers of Texas and Miss Edith Head
(playing themselves) although they
didn't do much of anything either.
But I did record the love of a
handsome cow-puncher for an east
ern beauty. And how this lucky
group of friends all found oil on
their land so they stood together
first at the bottom of the social lad
der and then at. the top.
And I recorded an eternal theme,
that no lady ought to have a career
that can be married to a cow-punch
er, or an oil millionaire, as the reel
may be. Ibsen didn't like this idea
but of course, he wasn't an Ameri
can.
So I, the Vista Vision cam
era have recorded two new movies.
Sometimes I wish though, I were a
bigger camera. Not so I could take
pictures of buffalo herds. But so I
could be like Cinema Scope.
