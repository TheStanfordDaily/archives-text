# Cap and Gown Entourages Leadership, Scholarship
## 
### 
Half a century ago the idea of a women's honorary society at
Stanford was conceived, and since that time Cap and Gown has
been active in furthering the interests of Stanford women and en
couraging an effective leadership among women on campus.
This year Cap and Gown is composed of 16 women who have

made what is considered an ''out-'*
standing contribution in leadership
and service" and have at the same
time maintained a 2.6 academic av
erage.
Cap and Gown's immediate pur
pose is to raise funds through Stan
ford Calendar and cookie sales for
several scholarships including the
joint ASSU-Cap and Gown foreign
scholarship held this year by Maria
Scaglia from Italy, and the domestic
scholarship held by Dotty Dunham.
Cap and Gown calendars will go
on sale next week'.
Each year a black-robed proces
sion of Cap and Gown members
moves from residence to residence
"tapping" new members. Juniors and
seniors are tapped in the spring, and
only seniors are chosen in the fall
ceremony.
Cap and Gown members this year
are president Connie Schulz, Soo
Chew, Jo Davis, Dotty Dunham, El
lie Friar, Sue Hirst, Liz McCollister,
Eda Mendels, Mary Sherman, Nancy
Smalley, Tacy Ann Smith, Carol
Straus, Harriet Thomas, Mary Anna
Watanabe, Claudette Yeoman and
Helen Zarifes.
The scholarship program was be
gun in 1924 after the University
made the first of its many tuition
hikes and Cap and Gown found that
many women students were unable

to attend Stanford for financial rea
sons.
One of the first jobs of the newly
created Cap and Gown in 19U8 was
to sponsor and initiate a fund drive
to build the Women's Clubhouse.
Each Friday members of this early
body attended classes decked in
black cap and gowns. This custom
was dropped during World War I.
Cap and Gown contributes to vari
ous campus service projects and is
available to other groups for help
and opinions during the year.
In addition to active members,
there is an alumnae board which is
concerned primarily with the plan
ning and organization of Cap and
Gown activities.
President Connie Schulz empha
sized that a campus office per se does
not qualify a person for Cap and
Gown. A member, she said, must
have the respect of her fellow stu
dents, maintain a perspective of the
over-all pattern of student life, and
go beyond the immediate demands
of her particular duties.
