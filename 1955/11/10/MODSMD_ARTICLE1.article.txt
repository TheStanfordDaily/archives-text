# 1955 Gaieties Carries On Fifty-Year Tradition
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
"Half a century is a long run for any show, but we hope this
year's Gaieties will top them all."
"Bucket" Christensen, who is production co-ordinator for the
1955 Gaieties, was talking about Ram's Head hictory. Talking
with enthusiasm, because after all Gaieties is less than a week off.

Then, too, there was a lot of his- -1
tory. The first on-campus football
show made its appearance in 1904,
but it was quite a different affair
from that of 1955.
Ram's Head in those days, to begin
with, was an all-male organization.
No chorus line. The show had a pro- j
fessional script: the typical turn-of
the-century review.
In fact it wasn't even Gaieties.
The show went by such names as
"Football Follies" and"The Varsity
Show" before the present title was
settled upon.
IN SPIRIT"
"Bucket" corrected herself: "Only
I guess it was Gaieties in spirit—the
same idea, you know, the same pur
pose."
The male tradition continued in
Gaieties' staffs even after the cast
became co-ed, until World War 11,
when the first woman director took
over and the U. S. Army band played j
accompaniment.
"Ram's Head has had it's share of j
celebrities, too." ''Bucket" said, j
"Lloyd Nolan, for instance, and of |
course, Doodles Weaver."
Doodles, surprisingly perhaps, was
invoived in one of Ram's Head's
most sentimental moments. It was
the last show to be held in the old
assembly hall before it was scrapped
to make way for Memorial Audi
torium.
RIP STAGE
Doodles, with one foot on a soap
box, recited Puck's speech from
"Midsummer Night's Dream" while
the rest of the cast literally ripped
the stage apart with axe and chisel.
"The whole audience was bawl
ing," "Bucket" said.
In recent years Gaieties has spread
out. Excerpts from the show were
taken last year to Park Air Force
Base and on a USO tour of army
bases, for which the Ram's Head
won a USO Outstanding Service
award.

same idea, you know, the same pur
pose."
The male tradition continued in
Gaieties' staffs even after the cast
became co-ed, until World War 11,
when the first woman director took
over and the U. S. Army band played j
accompaniment.
"Ram's Head has had it's share of j
celebrities, too." ''Bucket" said, j
"Lloyd Nolan, for instance, and of |
course, Doodles Weaver."
Doodles, surprisingly perhaps, was
invoived in one of Ram's Head's
most sentimental moments. It was
the last show to be held in the old
assembly hall before it was scrapped
to make way for Memorial Audi
torium.
RIP STAGE
Doodles, with one foot on a soap
box, recited Puck's speech from
"Midsummer Night's Dream" while
the rest of the cast literally ripped
the stage apart with axe and chisel.
"The whole audience was bawl
ing," "Bucket" said.
In recent years Gaieties has spread
out. Excerpts from the show were
taken last year to Park Air Force
Base and on a USO tour of army
bases, for which the Ram's Head
won a USO Outstanding Service
award.

GONG DANCER—Parodying the Tuesday Evening Series, Big
Game Gaieties actor Steve Sandberg representing an Asian

ant, interprets the meaning of the signal via la danse. Disinter

"Half a century is a long run for any show, but we hope this
year's Gaieties will top them all."
"Bucket" Christensen, who is production co-ordinator for the
1955 Gaieties, was talking about Ram's Head hictory. Talking
with enthusiasm, because after all Gaieties is less than a week off.

Then, too, there was a lot of his- -1
tory. The first on-campus football
show made its appearance in 1904,
but it was quite a different affair
from that of 1955.
Ram's Head in those days, to begin
with, was an all-male organization.
No chorus line. The show had a pro- j
fessional script: the typical turn-of
the-century review.
In fact it wasn't even Gaieties.
The show went by such names as
"Football Follies" and"The Varsity
Show" before the present title was
settled upon.
IN SPIRIT"
"Bucket" corrected herself: "Only
I guess it was Gaieties in spirit—the
same idea, you know, the same pur
pose."
