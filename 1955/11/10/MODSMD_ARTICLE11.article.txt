# Arguments Favoring Spring Rushing Given

(This is the first of two articles dealing with the pros and cons
of moving formal rushing from winter to spring quarter. The
second story tomorrow will outline the advantages of retaining
the present system.)
"Stanford's rushing system is one of the best in this area, but that
does not mean that it is the best possible," said Mrs. Ellene Sumner
at the open meeting on 'rushing Monday night in Cubberley Audi
torium.
This statement seems to typify the reasoning behind those people
who favor changing formal rushing from winter to spring quarter.
Mrs. Sumner, director of Wilbur Hall, argued that freshmen do
not have an adequate chance to become adjusted to Stanford before
the rushing season begins. The former head of Encina Hall, when
that dormitory contained freshman men, stated that an extra quarter
of freedom from affiliation could aid the frosh academically.
Many freshman sponsors and resident assistants claim that class,
dorm "and wing unity are broken following pledging.
As IFC president Ron Wagner pointed out at the meeting Monday
night, "Several wings in Encina gave up social activities after rushing
last year because of disunity."
This problem is especially important for those freshmen who do
not pledge since many have no other social units outside of their
class and wing.
From the standpoint of the fraternities and eating clubs, spring
rushing has several advantages.
First, the monetary problem of feeding pledges once a week as
is the habit of most units would be decreased.
A pledge training program which would be concentrated entirely
into spring quarter instead of being spread over two quarters could
have its advantages.
Along the same lines, attendance at pledge meetings and house
work days might be improved if it were not spread out over such a
long period.
The proponents of spring rushing argue that freshmen should be
better able to make correct choices concerning the group they select
after the extra quarter. This would cut down the large amount of
de-pledging which occurred last year.
Since Stanford's social schedule is very flexible, events of major
social importance could be switched around depending upon when
rushing occurs. The only events which cannot be moved are the
basketball games during the winter season.
A greater variety of types of rushing parties could be held in
spring quarter. Such events as beach parties can bx-eak up the usual
types of rushing parties.
