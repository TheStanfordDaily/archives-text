## 
### 
A record crowd of 300 students attended last night's movies of
Saturday's Stanford-USC game. They were shown in the Lagunita
Court dining room.
The traditional student showing of Stanford football movies is
one of the activities under investigation for uselessness by the

ASSU Activities Evaluation Com
mittee.
Quipped Head Cheer Leader Jim
Walters:
"I guess they'll have to take an
other look at it after tonight."
The showings are usually held in
Cubberley Auditorium with its su
perior motion picture facilities.
Walters opened tonight's program
with a five-minute talk, calling Stan
ford's performance against USC "by
far the best showing of the year."
Coach, Chuck Taylor, scheduled to
narrate the film, arrived late. He
began his commentary with the start
of the second quarter.
Taylor once ran the projector
backwards to reshow a sequence in
slow motion.
When the audience gave out with
the usual guffaws at the reverse ac
tion, Taylor commented:
"This reminds me of a play our
JV's perfected in 1950. It was a reg
ular play, but it looked like it was
being run backwards."
Taylor pointed out offensive and
defensive weaknesses of both teams,
calling the audience's attention to
exceptionally good plays.
He noted especially John Brodie's
pin-point passes which gained 216
yards to insure the Indians' upset
victory over USC.
He summed up the game's out
come by quoting one of the Stan
ford players, who said after the
game:
"It's always good to beat USC. I
guess it's because we just don't like
them."
