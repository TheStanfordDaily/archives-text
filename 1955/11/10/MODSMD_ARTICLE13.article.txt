# Traffic Com Devises New Road Plan
## One-Way Traffic For Los Arboles Road Suggested 
### 
The ASSU Traffic Committee
has formulated a new idea for
Los Arboles Road, closed by the
University at the beginning of
the quarter.
The new plan for the connecting
link from Santa Teresa Street to
Foothill Road calls for opening the
street to one-way outbound traffic.
Thus, cars could drive past Lagunita
Court and out to the Menlo Park
area, but would be unable to come
in the same way.
Reason for backing this plan in
cludes a litter problem in front of
the four professors' homes on Santa
Teresa Street. All four of the fami
lies have expressed satisfaction with
the closing of the road, but did not
originate the plan.
Another problem cited by the four
families is the speeding of cars along
Santa Teresa at night as students
rush to make lock-outs.
Traffic committee has suggested
that if the one-way plan is adopted
and speeding remains a problem,
traffic bumps be installed in the road
to restrict speed to ten miles an
hour.
The committee agreed that the
closing of Los Arboles Road has
placed a new and serious hazard on
the Row (Lasuen Street). The popu
lation of the Row, the committee
points out, is considerably more than
the population along Santa Teresa.
The committee also suggested that
signs be posted at all entrances to
the University stating that the roads
are private and subject to private
regulations.
This done, it would be possible to
post the streets for speed limits, and
permit the use of radar speed traps,
outlawed on state roads.
In another action, the committee
has completed its revision of parking
plans in the Quad area, and expects
to submit it to the University in the
near future.
