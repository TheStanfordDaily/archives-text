NEW CONCRETEâ€”A Corporation Yard workman prepares a
section of Inner Quad concrete block paving for resurfacing and
repouring. The old blocks, located in front of Memorial Church,
had been settling and cracking, Corp Yard officials said. Their
deterioration was due to water accumulating and standing in
depressions in the concrete during the winter months. The old
blocks must be torn up and the underlying surface area re
worked before the new concrete can be poured. The entire job
will be finished it) a few days, the Corp Yard said.
