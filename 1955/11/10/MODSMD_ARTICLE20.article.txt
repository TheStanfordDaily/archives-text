## Professor Will Voice 'Antiâ€™ Views, Jenks to Defend at Cubberley Tonight 
### DOROTHY CAMPBELL 
Student on campus
activities will be sought in to
night's debate on the topic, "Ar -
Social Activities on the Stanford
Campus Overemphasized?" at
7:30 in Cubberley Auditorium.
Professor Wilfred H. Stone will
summarize the opinions which he
expressed in a Daily column re
cently.
In the article he mentioned that
many lading and dying activities are
kept alive to give students busy
work; that students are distract* I
from studies and interesting conver
sations because the social pressure
to build floats and to participate in
other time-consuming and relatively
useless activities is so great.
JENKS TO DEFEND
Dave Jenks, last year's sophomore
class president will defend activities
in college as worthwhile.
Phil Olsen will take a stand dif
fering slightly from Stone's. He will
claim that activities, though over
emphasized, have their place.
He will not advocate regulation
of activities but will contend th.it if
the social pressure were lessened,
the useless ones would die of their
own accord.
The students will then cross-qua -
tion each other.
OPEN DEBATE
During the open debate which will
follow, students from the audience
will be asked to give their own opin
ions on activities rather than just
asking questions.
"Anything will go" in the ensuing
discussion, according to the Speech
Association.
The only limitations are that stu
dents are asked to speak no mon
than three minutes each, and tho o
who have not yet voiced their opin
ions will be given .preference over
those who have already spoken.
FIRST OF SERIES
This will be the first of a serie of
discussions on campus controversies
sponsored by the Speech Associa
tion. It is scheduled to last no lone r
than one hour.
Purpose of this series is to stimu
late interest in campus activities as
well as more participation in debate,
according to Mark Hawkins of the
Speech Association.
The association is building to he
come more active. A larger group
of students are desired to join in the
debates.
Students will have an opportunity
to meet Stone and discuss his opin
ions on student activities with him.
SEATING PLAN
The Speech Association requests
students to sit in the following nr.li
ner at tonight's debate: those who
favor activities on the right, those
opposed on the left, and those un
decided in the middle.
"This discussion will be a chal
lenge for Stanford students to de
fend their opinions in open debate.
It will- show what Stanford stu
dents really think about acti ti ,
and ought to aid the Activities Eval
uation Committee in its job," aid
Hawkins.
