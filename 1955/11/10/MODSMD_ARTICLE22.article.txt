Would you be in favor of collective action
by the Stanford student body, through the Leg
islature, to urge a change in the state liquor
laws to allow younger people to drink?
What should be the age limit and should it
apply to beer or all alcohol?
This is not a new idea. In the fall of 1952
a special referendum was placed on the ASSU
fall election ballet.
The referendum stated that the state set the
minimum legal age for the purchase of liquors
containing leso than 13 per cent alcohol at 18
years and provide persons between the ages of
18 and 21 with non-transferable personal iden
tification which includes a picture of the holder.
Two questions were asked: (1) Do you ap
prove? end (2) Do you approve of submitting
this idea to the State Legislature?
This referendum resulted in the then-largest
turnout in Stanford voting history â€” approxi
mately 4500 students. But the election was
void because there weren't enough
Lallo.s for the students wishing to vote.
So, the election was re-run (as usual) on the
next Wednesday when only 2847 went to the
polls. The first section of the referendum was
defeated by 257 votes and the second, by 414
votes.
Of the 13 students interviewed by The Daily,
only three believed that action by the ASSU
Legislature would be an effective means of
changing the liquor laws.
Five others believed that there should be
some change in the law but no't through the
student Legislature. The feeling was that:
1. It would be naive to think a move by the
Legislature would accomplish anything.
2. After the recent Rossotti's episode, the
Legislature would only get a bad name.
3. The should act only when
there are a majority of students wishing such
action.
Other comments by the five are:
Bcb Flaherty, '59, Wilbur: "I can see the
headlines now, 'Stanford Wants Beer.' I feel
that 18 would be a good legal age for the sale
of all alcchol, but I doubt very much if a reso
lution frcm the Legislature would carry much
weight in having the drinking age changed."
Reuben Mehling, graduate, San Mateo: "I'm
in favor of drinking for younger students. Our
laws on drinking are outmoded. The average
student leaves home at 18, joins the army, and
is independent enough so he shouldn't be
treated as a dependent. I would start by lower
ing the limit on beer and then go all the way."
Jon Cosovich, '57, Wilbur: "I am in favor of
letting an 18-ysar-old buy beer, because he is
going to buy it anyway. There are always
places that he can get it. I think the law should
fit the situation instead of making a mockery
of the law by trying to make the situation fit
the law."

Jchn Whalen, '56, Delta Tau Delta: "I would
favor a reduction of the age limit to not less
than 19 or, preferably, 20. If the age is 19,
then beer or other beverages with the same
alcoholic content should be the only beverage 3
allowed."
Danny Geld, '57, Breakers: "I would be in
favor of lowering the liquor age law to 18 for
beer only."
The students interviewed who are for Legis
lative action say:
Scnya Hamburg, '57, Laqunita: "I think the
limit should be lowered to 18 or 19, and I think
by the time students are in college they should
be mature enough to make their own decisions.
Any law which incites rebellion is bad, be
cause young people should be learning to obey
laws."
John Hill, '53, Encina: "I think that the limit
should be lowered to 13 for beer only and not
for other alcoholic beverages. Eighteen-year
clds are old enough to accept the responsibili
ties of drinking, as is shown by the fact that
many states allow them to drink."
Jack Scovil, '59, Wilbur: "I would be in favor
of such a change for bcth beer and liquor. The
age limit should ba lowered to at least 18. A
similar condition exists in this instance as ex
isted during the Prohibition era, in which the
law was being broken constantly anyway."
/ Comments of students who do not believe in
changing the state law are:
Ed McClanahan, graduate: "In Kentucky ihe
21-year-old age limit is honored only in the
breach. One drinks when one is old enough
to hold it."
Jack Rolls, '59, Wilbur: "Far more sensible
people than any of us have made the laws gov
erning the sale of liquor. Alcohol is like a drug
and can contribute to the degeneration of a
person's morals. Sure, it sounds stupid and
prudish, I know; and it's great fun to go out to
Rudy's and get plastered. But, if the age were
lowered, it would m?an more students would
take up drinking j'usi to be one of the gang.
Alcohol and foolishness of youth just don't
mix."
Barbara Mackeianz, '57, Oaks: "I don't think
people under 21 are quite ready to use alcohol
in as responsible a manner as older people
should. They are also less likely to use good
judgment on when to stop drinking."
Bob Hamrdla, '59, Wilbur: "I would not be
in favor of such an action because I think that
if a person undpr 21 wants to drink, he usually
does so in spite of the laws. Placing the age
limit at 21 is as satisfactory a policy as any."
Steve Fauly, '58, Stern: "The problem of al
cohol is purely a personal one and calls for re
sponsibility and discretion. I believe that with
the age of 21, such responsibility is present."
