intriguing facts
To the Editor:
I was quite interested in the reaction to some cur
rent campus activity, reflected in an editorial and a
letter to the editor in Wednesday's Daily. I thought
I might point out a lew intriguing facts.
In several campaign speeches last spring I main
tained that the really valid and vital organized groups
oi students—"committees"—were those which arose
Irom a general student need and interest. While the
right "to go to hell in any way he pleases" cannot be
denied anyone, especially in an institution devoted
theoretically to helping the student develop his indi
viduality, neither can he be denied the right to or
ganize.
This year two such groups arose, a committee to
investigate parking and one to evaluate the campus
social program. The first of these has proved in fact
to be one of our most vital organizations; .the second,
dealing with a concept to which Stanford students
who are generally activities-minded and product-ion
o: iented are unaccustomed, is of? to a slower and a
necessarily careful start. In both cases the commit
tees consist oi students who got together and said,
"We want to work on this problem."
It is interesting to note that there are no members
of the Legislature on these committees, with the ex
ception of one representative who agreed to serve on
the traffic committee at the chairman's request. Fur
thermore. the Legislature has not "appointed" either
committee. The approval of these committees after

they had organized, a matter purely of protocol, was
merely to get the members' names on the minutes for
future reference.
As for the work of the Activities Evaluation Com
mittee: We perhaps cannot deny the right of students
to go to hell independently, but we cannot deny them
the right to do it collectively, either. The committee
has chosen not to attempt to wipe out activities (a
power which, since they are not an official arm of
the student-elected Legislature, they do not have
anyway), but rather to sound out general student
opinion.
If they come up with a report of student sentiment
regarding specific campus events to which the organi
zations sponsoring these events can refer, that's fine.
If the Legislature can use this report to curtail ofli
cially-sponsored events when jt comes budgeting
time, that's fine. If the committee can prepare a gen
eral statement, based on student opinion, of what
Stanford University as an academic institution should
be striving for and of the place—if any—of activities
in meeting this goal, that may be in the long run
even better.
As an independent student committee the students
who formed it are entitled to do with it what they
wish. What Legislature (last night it had its second
meeting of the fully formed body) does in the same
area is another matter. If the student committee pro
duces some valuable results in the course of its study,
of course, the Legislature may well be glad that stu
dent inte?est was great enough that the study arose.

tained that the really valid and vital organized groups
oi students—"committees"—were those which arose
Irom a general student need and interest. While the
right "to go to hell in any way he pleases" cannot be
denied anyone, especially in an institution devoted
theoretically to helping the student develop his indi
viduality, neither can he be denied the right to or
ganize.
This year two such groups arose, a committee to
investigate parking and one to evaluate the campus
social program. The first of these has proved in fact
to be one of our most vital organizations; .the second,
dealing with a concept to which Stanford students
who are generally activities-minded and product-ion
o: iented are unaccustomed, is of? to a slower and a
necessarily careful start. In both cases the commit
tees consist oi students who got together and said,
"We want to work on this problem."
It is interesting to note that there are no members
of the Legislature on these committees, with the ex
ception of one representative who agreed to serve on
the traffic committee at the chairman's request. Fur
thermore. the Legislature has not "appointed" either
committee. The approval of these committees after

they had organized, a matter purely of protocol, was
merely to get the members' names on the minutes for
future reference.
As for the work of the Activities Evaluation Com
mittee: We perhaps cannot deny the right of students
to go to hell independently, but we cannot deny them
the right to do it collectively, either. The committee
has chosen not to attempt to wipe out activities (a
power which, since they are not an official arm of
the student-elected Legislature, they do not have
anyway), but rather to sound out general student
opinion.
If they come up with a report of student sentiment
regarding specific campus events to which the organi
zations sponsoring these events can refer, that's fine.
If the Legislature can use this report to curtail ofli
cially-sponsored events when jt comes budgeting
time, that's fine. If the committee can prepare a gen
eral statement, based on student opinion, of what
Stanford University as an academic institution should
be striving for and of the place—if any—of activities
in meeting this goal, that may be in the long run
even better.
As an independent student committee the students
who formed it are entitled to do with it what they
wish. What Legislature (last night it had its second
meeting of the fully formed body) does in the same
area is another matter. If the student committee pro
duces some valuable results in the course of its study,
of course, the Legislature may well be glad that stu
dent inte?est was great enough that the study arose.
