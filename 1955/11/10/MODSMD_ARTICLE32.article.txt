# Norwegian Student Proud Of U.S.-Norway Relations
## Scholar Calls Norway 'Most Pro-American Country in Europe' 
### GERRY SMITH 
With a sudden smile and
more than a touch of pride, AS
SU foreign scholar Truls Trei
der dubbed his native Norway
"the most pro-American country
in Europe."
Ties between Norway and the
United States are very strong, ac
cording to the 22-year-old ski en
thusiast. He says Norway consistent
ly supports U. S. policy.
Treider also feels that Norway has
much to contribute to the United
Nations. Their ideas are pacific and
very anti-militaristic, partly because
of the influence of Nazi occupation
during World War 11.
"Even now it is difficult for a
youth of Norway to even face a Ger
man," he continued. "But we follow
a humanitarian line of action.
CHARACTERISTICS OF NORWAY
"It is characteristic of Norway that
she supports international aid," Trei
der noted. During the war the Nor
wegian commercial fleet went to
England, carrying much-needed oil
during the Battle of Britain.
Underground resistance during the
Nazi occupation was strong and well
organized. Of the three million peo
ple in Norway, over 30,000 partici
pate d directly in the resistance
movement.
On the subject of Communist in

fluence in Norway, Treider noted
that it has diminished every year
since the war.
The "Reddest" area of the country
is the north, which was occupied by
the Russians after the Nazis had al
most totally demolished everything
there.
Norway has a history of state
ownership, Treider said. This is es
pecially true of the railroads which
cost so much to build in the moun
tainous country. Norway's govern
ment under the Social Democratic
party is similar to England's.
Discussing American prestiege in
Europe, Treider commented that it
is at a low ebb. He feels this is be
cause of too long occupation and the
inclination of Europeans to judge
the United States by American tour
ists.
McCarthy issue
"The McCarthy issue was very
disastrous for American popularity,"
the young Norweigan continued. "In
Norway we felt it represented a
turning to the narrow and reaction
ary view. We look at congressional
investigating committees as some
thing like the medieval Inquisition."
Treider was born in Copenhagen,
Denmark, and lived there four years
before moving to Norway. His par
ents are both in newspaper work.
He plans to enter either journalism
as a free lance writer or diplomatic
school.
Treider attended the University of
Oslo while in Norway. Last year he
went to the University of Grenoble
in France. He has traveled consid
erably in Europe.
IMPRESSIONS OF STANFORD
Turning to his impressions of
Stanford, where he is living at the
Alpha Tau Omega house this quar
ter, he noted that "wompn here give
the impression of being more intelli
gent and mature than men."
He particularly appreciates the
Honor Code and the informality be
tween professors and students. "A
Norwegian professor is a fellow with
a mustache who creeps out from
among his books, delivers a very dry
lecture and retires as quickly as
possible."
Treider thinks the foreign schol
arship program is an excellent idea.
"It's the most positive I've ever seen,
an ideal of international relations.
But the students themselves don't
really know what it is. If they did,
it would be perfect."
