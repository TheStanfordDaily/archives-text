# â€˜LIFE OR DEATH'
## Jordan Fought to Save Farm During 'Stone Age' 
### 
Alter Senator Leland Stanford's death in 1893, the University
was put into a "life or death" situation.
The entire Stanford estate was tied up in probate court for three
years and Mrs. Stanford was urged to close the University.
Jordan hoped she would have the courage to continue. Accord-

ing to Bertha Berner, Mrs. Stan
lord's private secretary, Dr. Jordan
felt that it would he best it' he did
not urge Mis. Stanford to continue.
Therefore, she recalled, when Mrs.
Stanford sent for him to come and
see her and told him she had no in
tention of closing the University,
the large man (he was 6 feet 3
inches tall) knelt and kissed her
hand, both with tears in their eyes.
MAKING PLANS
Both were deeply moved, and
when they had recovered their com
posure, they began to make plans
for carrying out the work.
During the three years in federal
court, Jordan never gave up hope.
After the Supreme Court decided
in Stanford's favor, one alumnus
wrote to Jordan: "In the years of
uncertainty, if you had faltered
once, everything would have been
lost."
The fiscal problems were far from
over. Large sums were paid for
what Jordan called "the stone age"
at Stanford. Outer Quad, Memorial
Church, and other structures were
being built.
EARTHQUAKE
The construction period was be
ing completed when, on April 18,
1906, the earthquake destroyed $2,-
500,000 worth of University property
in 56 seconds.
Dr. Jordan now realized that "the
rest of my administration must be
devoted simply t to solidifying what
had already been attained."
It was on. the same morning of
the earthquake that he received a
letter offering him the secretaryship
of the Smithsonian Institution, one
of the most prized positions in sci
ence.
The post had been held open fol
ium the preceding 10 years. But the
earthquake eliminated any desire he
might have had for the position. The
same day he sent the Institution his
final refusal.
