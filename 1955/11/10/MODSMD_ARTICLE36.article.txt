# Jordan Sought New Challenge At Stanford
## 
### 
In the spring of 1891, David
Starr Jordan, then president of
Indiana University, was speak
ing at the dedication of a science
building at the University of Il
linois.
He was interrupted by a messen
ger who handed him a telegram
which read:
"Decline no offer from California
till you hear from me." It was
signed by Andrew D. White, presi
dent of Cornell.
Just two days before, Senator and
Mrs. Stanford had sought White's
advice on the selection of a presi
dent for the University whose sand
stone quadrangle was then rising on
the plain of Menlo. President White
said to them:
"Go to the University of Indiana;
there you will find the president,
an old student of mine, David Starr
Jordan, one of the leading scientific
men of the country, possessed of a
most charming power of literary ex
pression, with a remarkable ability
in organization, and blessed with
good sound sense. Call him."
The Senator told the young edu
cator of his ideal for the schoolâ€”that
"he hoped to develop in California a
university of the highest order, a
cenfer of invention and research,
where students should be trained
for 'usefulness in life.'"
"The possibilities were so chal
lenging to one of my temperament
that I could not decline," Jordan
later wrote in his autobiography.
Within 10 minutes after they met,
Senator Stanford offered the presi
dency to Jordan.
