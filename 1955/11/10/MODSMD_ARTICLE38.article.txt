# Jordan Earned Renown As Expert Ichthyologist
## He Wrote More Than 500 Articles on Fish, Acquired Valuable Scientific Collections 
### 
During his days as President of a newly-founded University,
David Starr Jordan found time to make field trips to collect fish —
sometimes traveling halfway around the world.
Jordan was a biologist and one of the greatest living authorities
on ichthyology. He wrote over 500 books or articles on fish alone.

It was because of Dr. Jordan's
work in the field of ichthyology
that Stanford is the possessor of one
of the world's most valuable scien
tific research collections.
His deep interest in ichthyology
brought about his own Jong-stand
ing joke—that he could no longer
attempt to remember the name of
every Stanford student because for
every one he did remember, he
would have to forget the name of a
fish.
This statement appeared as a cari
cature in "Punch" many years after
his death.
JORDAN'S LAW
One of his fish investigations led
to what is known as Jordan's Law.
He had observed that the most
closely allied species are not found
in the same river system but in ad
jacent ones. From this fact he
reached the generalization that evo
lution of a new species is preceded
by separation of part of the popula
tion by a barrier.
During his later years Jordan
compiled a list of genera and species
of American, Mexican and Japanese
fish. His secretary, Ada Morse
Grose, tells this anecdote about the
day she was bored with the task of
copying the very fine print in the
catalogues.
At the end of a hard day's work,
she turned to him and said:
WHY SO MANY?
"Dr. Jordan, I can't understand
the ultimate purpose of knowing so
much about fish. Of course we have
to know which ones are edible and
we like to know the names of the
most beautiful specimens, but what

can be the 'ultimate purpose' of
knowing so much about so many of
them?"
He swung around in his swivel
chair, his kind eyes twinkling:
"When I die and go to Heaven," he
explained, "the Lord may ask me
what I learned down in this world
of His. Then I'll tell Him I know
about fish."
"But, Dr. Jordan," she interrupted,
"if you stop and tell the Lord all you
know about fish, you're going to
hold up the Heaven-bound proces
sion a long time."
"Not too long," he countered,
smiling. "In the sight 'of the Lord
a thousand years is as one day. It
won't take me longer than that."
