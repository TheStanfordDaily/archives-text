# Even Russians Cite Dr. Jordan As Authority
## 
### 
The Russians also recognize Dr.
Jordan's ability as an ichthyolo
gist.
One hundred years after his
birth, one of his pupils wrote a
centennial ~story about Jordan's
early life.
In the article Professor George
S. Myers, curator of Zoological
Collections at Stanford, revealed
that E. K. Sovorov had included
three of Jordan's works as author
ities in the Russian's latest text
book on fishes and their biology.
Few non-Russians are listed in
this bibliography.
