# LASSU May Raise Flicks Price 5 Cents
## CinemaScope Screen Would Be Installed With Extra Money 
### EDA MENDELS Associate Editor, The Daily 
Admission charge to the Sun
day Evening Movies may be
raised from 20 to 25 cents to
finance the installation of Cine
maScope equipment in Memo
rial Auditorium.
ASSU Legislature last night au
thorized its Financial Committee to
investigate the advisability of buy
ing CinemaScope projection appara
tus, and increased admission fees to
the Flicks was proposed as a means
of paying for the expenditui-e.
Student Financial Manager Bill
Tooley, who placed the subject be
fore the Legislature, suggested that
$2672, estimated cost of the new in
stallation, might be withdrawn from
the Reserve for Maintenance Fund
to buy the equipment. Increased
revenue from the Flicks might pay
ofT this expense in four to five quar
ters.
COMMITTEE REFERRAL
At Tooley's recommendation, the
matter was referred to the Finan
cial Committee for detailed study.
He explained that the change-over
is being considered now because of
the scarcity of outstanding current
pictures for the conventional type of
projection.
Sunday Evening Movie selections
have had to be made from films re
leased one to two years ago, and
those sources arc now drying up, he
said. If a CinemaScope installation
were available, more outstanding
features could be shown.
CIIEER LEADER EXPENSE
The Legislature approved the al
location of $15 from the head cheer
leader's trip expense account to be
given to Prince Lightfoot, Stanford
mascot, for expenses incurred in go
ing to the USC football game. Too
ley reported that Head Cheer Lead
er Jim Walters requested that this
be done.
ASSU President George Ralph re
ported that the search was still on
for means of financing the head
cheer leader's and mascot's trips to
out-of-town games.
The status of "commission" was
given to the Speech Activities Asso
ciation. The group's rank had been
disputed since last spring when it
was voted to be a commission by a
simple majority rather than by the
three-fourths necessary vote.
BOARD STATUS
The Speech Association had re
quested board status which carries
with it representation on the Cabi
net. The distinction between the
two types of organization is that a
board deals with a general student
interest while commissions are lim
ited to a specialized activity.
The decision was complicated by
the possibility of a revamping of the
activities set-up. Speech Activities
Association was mentioned as a pos
sible associate of the Political Union
or Public Relations Board.
