# David Starr Jordan—Teacher, Naturalist, Prophet of Freedom
## Stanford's First President Lived Three 'Lives' He Was Indiana's President for 6 Years 
### FRANK HUNTRESS 
David Starr Jordan separated
his own life into three "more or
less independent lives" — first,
as a naturalist and explorer; sec
ond, as a teacher; and third, as a
minor prophet of democracy.
Stanford's first president had a
biological 'law and a mountain peak
named for him. He won $25,000 for
the best plan of education to pro
mote international peace.
Jordan has been written about as
the "greatest fish expert of his life
time" and as "one of the major
prophets of his generation."
He was born on a farm in Gains
ville, N.Y., on Jan. 19, 1851.
After receiving his earliest educa
tion at home and local school, he was
one of two boys who were enrolled
for a time in the Gainsvifle Female
Seminary.
It was here at the age of 14 that
he studied algebra and geometry,
and learned to read French as well
as English.
At the age of 17 he taught village
school when he won a scholarship "to
Cornell University through competi
tive examination.
WORKED THROUGH CORNELL
He worked his way through Cor
nell as a lather, potato digger, corn
husker, hasher, and even a janitor
who swept the floors of the science
building.
While at Cornell he was a mem
ber of a club composed of youths
who had "financial difficulties"
known as "The Struggle for Exist
ence." He was also a member of the
Delta Upsilon fraternity.
In 1872 Jordan received the M.S.
degree from Cornell.
Three years later he received the
degree of M.D. from the Indiana
Medical College. Of the degree Jor
dan said that he had "scarcely
earned" it for his little study in
order to teach physiology.
During his first teaching assign
ment at Lombard College, he insti
tuted the method of teaching the
sciences by student participation
rather than by lecture.
TRUSTEE CRITICISM
He was criticized by a trustee be
cause he permitted the students "to
go into the cabinet to handle the
apparatus and waste chemicals."
He married Susan Bowen in 1878.
Before her death in 1885 she bore
him three children.
In 1887 Jordan married Jessie
Knight. His second wife bore him
three more children and remained
"her husband's helper and compan
ion" throughout the remainder of
his life.
At Butler University in 1879 he
received the Ph.D. degree. The fol
lowing year he became the head of
the natural science department at
Indiana University.
He didn't realize, then, that in six
years he was to become the univer
sity's president at the age of 34—the
youngest university president in the
country.
INDIANA PRESIDENT
His election to the presidency of
Indiana in 1885 was undesired by
him. He accepted the responsibility,
but at the same time filed a letter
of resignation "to take effect, if de
sired, at the end of the term."
Not only was it not desired for
him to resign, but he also gained
such recognition as an organizer and
executive that a certain Senator
from California reached halfway
across the nation to obtain him as
the first president of a newly estab
lished university.
Dr. Jordan became President of

Leland Stanford Junior University
in 1891.
He and his wife, Jessie, made a
hurried trip to Palo Alto in April of
that year in order to prepare the
University for its opening on Oct. 1.
Among his initial tasks was that
of installing the "major subject sys
tem" type of curriculum. This sys
tem is as we know it today—that of
generalizing in the first two years
and, then, choosing a major at the
beginning of the junior year.
•RADICAL SYSTEM"
Jordan's "system" was devised
while he was president of Indiana.
At the time it was called "radical."
At the offset he was an advocate
of co-education at Stanford. While
the Inner Quadrangle and Encina
Hall were being rushed to comple
tion, he suggested that work begin
immediately on Roble Hall (later
Sequoia) as a women's dormitory.
After the school's opening, Senator
Stanford wrote Jordan:'
"In reading over your address at
the opening of the University I find
these words: 'A generous education
should be the birthright of every
man and woman in America.' This
strikes me as a great truth, and of
such importance that I would like it
to be used as one of the mottoes of
the University. I have read your
address several times and each time
I read it I am better pleased."
Shortly after the 1893 commence
ment exercises, the Senator died.
STANFORD WILL
This left the University in des
perate financial straits. The settle
ment of the Senator's will was cost
ly. The government's suit against
Stanford took three years in federal
court before it was finally settled in
the University's favor in 1896.

It involved Stanford's share of the
loan to the Central Pacific Railway
Company. Bad business conditions
also prolonged the suit.
During the period when he was
president of Stanford, Jordan turned
down the secretaryship of the Smith
sonian Institute, the presidency of a
well-known eastern university and
the presidency of the University of
California.
In 1913 he resigned from his post
of president to assume the newly
created position of chancellor. He
remained at this post until 1916 when
he became chanecllor emeritus, hav
ing reached the age of 65.
During his life at Stanford — 40
years — Jordan continued to teach,
write and carry on research in ich
thyology.
On appointment by President
Cleveland he headed the American
division of a joint high commission
of investigation of the fur seal prob
lem of the Bering Sea.
His "Guide to the Study of Fishes"
appeared in 1905. This is still consid
ered the best in its field.
Jordan was a prolific writer. He

wrote over 1000 articles or books of
which over 500 were concerned with
fishes and fisheries.
He had a marvelous memory for
names, places and dates. His knowl
edge of the classics as well as mod
ern languages was remarkable.
After his retirement from active
administration of the University,
Jordan had more time for his "third
life" — that of a minor prophet in
democracy.
As early as 1898 he delivered his
first public address on international
arbitration as a means of adjusting
differences among different coun
tries. This belief became almost a
religion to him that he became an
ardent crusader for international
peace.
He was made chief director of the
World Peace Foundation in 1910.
When he reached his 71st birthday
Jordan added that if he had a chance
to live his life over again he would
probably choose the same three
lives.
In the summer of 1929 he suffered
a collapse which was followed by in
creased invalidism and inactivity up
to his death on Sept. 19, 1931.
