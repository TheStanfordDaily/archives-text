Even Edward M. Burns, author
of the Western Civ text "Western
Civilizations: Their History and
Culture," has written a book about
Stanford's first president.
The chairman of the Political
Science Department at Rutgers
University published a 256-page
book entitled "David Starr Jordan:
Prophet of Freedom."
In thiti book Dr. Jordan's views
on government, democracy, edu
cation, morals, war, education, he
redity, economics, and world or
ganizations are considered.
He is shown as a proponent of
political reform, a man who drew

up a complete and workable plan
for a world federal republic, a
forerunner of the (»<mkl Neighbor
policy and of international trus
teeships and one who foresaw that
education must be the foundation
of true democracy.
As a prophet he set forth the
view that communism and fascism
were alike in the long run.
In 1914 he urged that America
should join with her neighbors in
an agreement to hold the Western
Hemisphere. Two years later he
made a proposal which foreshad
owed the international trusteeship
principal as it has been adopted by

the United Nations.
Ilis greatest contribution, ac
cording to Burns, was "that he
disclosed the true causes of wars,
revealing them as iv»t merely eco
nomic but as rooted in the very
existence of sovereign nations act
ing on the theory that each must
play the role of a hyena in the
midst of a pack of wolves."
Even in the United States he
was almost an isolated figure lie
fore 191 X in exposing "the fallacies
of the balance of power, of armed
alliances to preserve peace and of
preparedness as a preventive of
wars."
