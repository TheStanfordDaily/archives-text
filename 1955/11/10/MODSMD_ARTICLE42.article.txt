On November 23, 194G, a group of athletes from Stanford trotted out onto
the floor of Memorial Stadium in Berkeley and took the Go! den Bcai;;
apart to the tune of 25-(>. Since that date, almost nine years ago. Cal has
been .supreme in the Big Game, except for two ties.
But. going a little farther back into tile records, do you know when Stan
foid last won here in our Stadium?
It was November 23, 1935. TWENTY YEARS AGO.
In the words of the Republicans in 1952, it's time for a change. And,
knock on wood, it looks as il this might be the year.
Cal admittedly has its weakest team since 1946, and the Cards have a
competent and at times great group of footballers going for them.
The only basis for comparison thai would seem to give Cal the edge is
the University of Washington. Stan lord tied the Husky, 7-7. Cal got its

second win of the year, 2U-(5, over
the same school. But, the deteriora
tion of that Husky team in the two
weeks between the game was appal
ling. I had to look hard at my pro
gram to tell that the Huskies playing
at Berkeley were the same Huskies
that I had seen two weeks before in
Seattle.
It's a bad thing to say, and I don't
want to be accused of jinxing our
chances, but Cal has a very weak
team this season. We SHOULD beat
them, but the Big Game has never
been a rivalry where the school that
should win. does win.
Back in 1935 Cal was undefeated
going into the Big G; me and Stan
ford hacl lost only one. L. B. "Stub"
Allison was in his first season as
Cal coach and the buildup for the
Thunder Teams of 1937-38 had start
ed. Stanford scored twice in the first
quarter, though, and hung on to win,

13-0, giving Allison the distinction of being the last Cal coach to lose a Big
Game at Stanford.
In 1941 Stanford was a heavy favorite here. Frankie Albert and Chuck
Taylor were back from the Rose Bowl team of the year before, and Cal had
a 3-5 record going into the game. But Bob Reinhard's punting kept Stan
ford in the hole all day and Cal won 1 (5-0.
The next year that the Big Game was played in Palo Alto was 1947.
By this time it was Cal that was up and Stanford, down. Cal had a dis
astrous season in 1946 and fired Coach Frank Wickhorst after he had the
helm for just one year.
Student and team pressure at Berkeley was too much for Wickhorst
and Pappy Waldorf came to Strawberry Canyon, amid much clamoring
including an article in the Saturday Evening Post entitled "Cal. Football
Coaches' Graveyard." But Waldorf coached Cal to an 8-1 record before
(he Big Game, and Stanford had lost all of her games, including a contest
with Idaho.
Cal was a 10-to-l favorite, and betters could get 40 points on Stanford.
But late in the fourth quarter the scoreboard read Stanford 18, Cal 14. The
Cal rooting section was deathly quiet, the only noise being the sound of
seats being ripped up in disgust.
From the Stanford side of the field came the derisive chant of
"Wickhorst's gone,
Pappy's great;
Who's your coach in '48?"
as the inspired Cardinal gridders pushed the Blue-and-Golders around.
But suddenly a wobbly Bear pass was completed to an injured sub halfback
who ran the length of the field for a touchdown.
The play covered 80 yards and deprived Stanford of what would have
been a well-earned win. and the upset of the decade. But more than that,
it perpetuated the era of Cal dominance in Palo Alto, and established an
other era which has lasted for eight straight games.
Let's put an end to both of these next weekend.

On November 23, 194G, a group of athletes from Stanford trotted out onto
the floor of Memorial Stadium in Berkeley and took the Go! den Bcai;;

been .supreme in the Big Game, except for two ties.
But. going a little farther back into tile records, do you know when Stan
foid last won here in our Stadium?
It was November 23, 1935. TWENTY YEARS AGO.
In the words of the Republicans in 1952, it's time for a change. And,
knock on wood, it looks as il this might be the year.
Cal admittedly has its weakest team since 1946, and the Cards have a
competent and at times great group of footballers going for them.
The only basis for comparison thai would seem to give Cal the edge is
the University of Washington. Stan lord tied the Husky, 7-7. Cal got its

second win of the year, 2U-(5, over
the same school. But, the deteriora
tion of that Husky team in the two
weeks between the game was appal
ling. I had to look hard at my pro
gram to tell that the Huskies playing
at Berkeley were the same Huskies
that I had seen two weeks before in
Seattle.
It's a bad thing to say, and I don't
want to be accused of jinxing our
chances, but Cal has a very weak
team this season. We SHOULD beat
them, but the Big Game has never
been a rivalry where the school that
should win. does win.
Back in 1935 Cal was undefeated
going into the Big G; me and Stan
ford hacl lost only one. L. B. "Stub"
Allison was in his first season as
Cal coach and the buildup for the
Thunder Teams of 1937-38 had start
ed. Stanford scored twice in the first
quarter, though, and hung on to win,

13-0, giving Allison the distinction of being the last Cal coach to lose a Big
Game at Stanford.
In 1941 Stanford was a heavy favorite here. Frankie Albert and Chuck
Taylor were back from the Rose Bowl team of the year before, and Cal had
a 3-5 record going into the game. But Bob Reinhard's punting kept Stan
ford in the hole all day and Cal won 1 (5-0.
The next year that the Big Game was played in Palo Alto was 1947.
By this time it was Cal that was up and Stanford, down. Cal had a dis
astrous season in 1946 and fired Coach Frank Wickhorst after he had the
helm for just one year.
Student and team pressure at Berkeley was too much for Wickhorst
and Pappy Waldorf came to Strawberry Canyon, amid much clamoring
including an article in the Saturday Evening Post entitled "Cal. Football
Coaches' Graveyard." But Waldorf coached Cal to an 8-1 record before
(he Big Game, and Stanford had lost all of her games, including a contest
with Idaho.
Cal was a 10-to-l favorite, and betters could get 40 points on Stanford.
But late in the fourth quarter the scoreboard read Stanford 18, Cal 14. The
Cal rooting section was deathly quiet, the only noise being the sound of
seats being ripped up in disgust.
From the Stanford side of the field came the derisive chant of
"Wickhorst's gone,
Pappy's great;
Who's your coach in '48?"
as the inspired Cardinal gridders pushed the Blue-and-Golders around.
But suddenly a wobbly Bear pass was completed to an injured sub halfback
who ran the length of the field for a touchdown.
The play covered 80 yards and deprived Stanford of what would have
been a well-earned win. and the upset of the decade. But more than that,
it perpetuated the era of Cal dominance in Palo Alto, and established an
other era which has lasted for eight straight games.
Let's put an end to both of these next weekend.
