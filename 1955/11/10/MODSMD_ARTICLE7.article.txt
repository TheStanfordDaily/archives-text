## South Africa Bolts UN General Assembly 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Nov.
9 (UP) — South Africa quit the
current session of the United Na
tions General Assembly today,
protesting the world organiza
tion's investigation of its racial
segregation policies.
W. C. Duplcssis, head of the South
African delegation, announced the
walkout in a dramatic speech im
mediately after the assembly's spe
cial political committee had voted,
37-7, with 13 abstentions, to con
tinue for the fourth year a commis
sion on the Apartheid (racial segre
gation) policies of South Africa.
It was the second boycott of the !
General Assembly this year. France J
walked out on Sept. 30 after the as- I
sembly voted to give full debate to
its relations with Algeria.
Both walkouts were based on the
same principle: the charter's prohi
bition, in its famous Article 2, Para
graph 7, of UN interference in the
internal affairs of any country.
"Many resolutions have been pass
ed," DuPlessis told the special po
litical committee, "not only on South
Africa's domestic affairs but also on
those of other countries, which
sought to give an interpretation to
this article at variance with what
the founders intended it to be and
with a clear intention to arrogate
to the assembly the right to inter
vene in matters which fall essential- i
ly within the domestic jurisdiction
of a member state. . . .
"It may be—or it may not be— j
that the resolution will be defeated j
I in the assembly, where passage re- !
quires a two-thirds vote], but that]
will only change the situation in a
technical .sense. What the majority
of member states of the UN organi
zation feels is embodied in this reso

lution and has secured the approval
of 37 delegations.
'"This means that a majority of the
total membership of the UN organi
zation continues to feel that this fla
grant intervention in South Africa's
domestic affairs is justified.
"My government is no longer pre
pared to accept this position or to
acquiesce in it. . . ."
