# Big Four Drop German Issue
## 
### 
GENEVA—The Big Four dropped
the entire deadlocked issue of Ger
man unification today after an angry
denunciation of Russia by the West.
The Western foreign ministers at
the Big Four conference warned that
Russia was losing the confidence of
the West by refusing all-German
elections and insisting on a unifica
tion that would turn the whole na
tion Communist.
The West demanded the issue be
set aside for the time being, at least.
Russian Foreign Minister V. M.
Molotov reluctantly agreed, after one
last restatement of his German posi
tion, to proceed to disarmament.
Disarmament was the second item
of the agenda drawn up by the Big
Four chiefs of state at the summit
conference last July under the now
rapidly dissipating "spirit of Ge
neva."'
