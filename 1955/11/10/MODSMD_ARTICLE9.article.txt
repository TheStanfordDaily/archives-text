### 
GREENWOOD. Miss. — A Leflore
county grand jury refused today to
indict two white half-brothers for
the kidnaping of Emmctt Till, a Chi
cago Negro boy slain in the notori
ous "wolf whistle" case.
"Gentlemen, in the case you are

interested in, there was a no bill re
turned," Circuit Judge Arthur Jor
dan told reporters at 3:08 p.m. EST,
after the grand jury submitted its
report.
J. W. Milam, 36, and Roy Bryant,
24. the two white men accused of
kidnaping Till in LcFlore county
after they were acquitted of mur
dering him in neighboring Talla
hatchie county, face no further state
charges in the case.
Till, 14-year-old visitor from Chi
cago, was abdusted from the home
of a relative last Aug. 28 after he
allegedly gave Bryant's pretty young
wife a "wolf-call" at a country store.
Three days later a body, battered
and shot through the head, and
weighted with a cotton gin fan, was
pulled from the Tallahatchie river
and identified as Till's by his uncle.
