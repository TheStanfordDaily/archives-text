Kepler's Kwik Kourse No. 2
Geography Weil-Grounded
Ceography describes the earth's
surfacc, its products, peoples, and
their distribution. For example, to
go from Quad to Kepler's Books
and Magazines 1 you head north
east by north down Palm Drive. At
El Camino Real, stop. Swing left,
ever so slightly right, then left
(avoid the underpass) (watch out
for on-coming and outgoing traf
fic) (stop for the bird lovers with
their Audobon bird calls )
Now head up El Camino Real in
a north-easterly direction (toward
Mcnlo Park, that is). One geo
graphical mile along the Real will
take you past Kepler's. So turn
around and go back 1 to the Cuild
Theatre. Directly to the southeast
of the Cuild Theatre is Kepler's
Books and Magazines, home of the
Peninsula's only complete collec
tion of papcrbound books.
If you've followed this lesson to
here, why not go on in and buy a
book?
I Whose products include all the
good papcrbound books, art prints
and portfolios, the quarterlies,
etc.
