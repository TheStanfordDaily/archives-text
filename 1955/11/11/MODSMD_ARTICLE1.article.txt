# Crothers Memorial Hall Dedication Is Planned for Tomorrow Morning
## 
### 
The million - dollar Crothers
Memorial Hall for graduate stu
dents in engineering will be
dedicated tomorrow.
The dormitory was occupied at
the beginning of the quarter when
some of the construction and land
scaping was still incomplete. Work
on the building is now complete.
Judge George E. Crothers of San
Francisco, Stanford alumnus whose
gifts have made the residence pos
sible, will cut a cardinal ribbon to
climax the brief dedication cere
mony, which has been set for 10:30
a.m.
President Wallace Sterling will
preside and talks will be made by
Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel, president of
the University trustees, and F. E.
Terman, provost and dean of the
School of Engineering.
Joseph Kullback of Washington,
D. C., president of the Crothers Me

morial Hall Club, will present to
Judge Crothers an autographed
group picture of the hall's first resi
dents.
Named in honor of Judge Croth
ers' mother, the late Margaret Jane
Crothers, the hall contains 50,000
square feet of floor space and houses
214 men, mostly in double rooms.
It is a U - shaped, three - story
structure of reinforced concrete with
a red-tile roof. It matches in ap
pearance the adjoining Crothers Hall
for law graduates and the two form
a quadrangle around a large land
scaped patio.
The law dormitory, completed in
1951, was also made possible by gifts
from Judge Crothers.
A typical room in the new engi
neering hall measures 13 by 16 feet
and provides built-in wardrobes and
bookshelves, a wash basin and medi
cine closet unit, desks, chairs and
beds. There are three tiled shower

rooms on each floor.
The ground floor is devoted large
ly to community rooms, including a
lounge, study and library rooms
opening onto a .small patio, TV room
and game room.
Other downstairs rooms are tai
lored to the needs of engineering
students. There are small drafting
and hobby workrooms, office space
for the secretaries of engineering
societies and a (50 - chair meeting
room.
In the service area are space for
luggage storage and a laundry room,
complete with automatic washers
and 'driers and .ironing boards.
Judge Crothers was a member of
the pioneer class of '95 and obtained
a master's degree in law in 18!)0. As
a young attorney he became a close
adviser of the widowed Jane Lathrop
Stanford, and he established the
University's complicated legal stand
ing.


READY FOR DEDICATION â€”The new Crothers Memorial Hall
will be dedicated in a ceremony tomorrow. In the foreground

landscaped patio area between them.
