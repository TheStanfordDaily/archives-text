# Arguments for Winter Rushing Presented
## 
### BOB MIEROW 
(This is the second of (wo articles I
concerning the possible change of
formal rushing from winter to spring
quarter. Yesterday's story contained
the advantages of spring rushing.)
Should a freshman's winter quar
ter be spent adjusting to Stanford
life or adjusting to the life of a fra
ternity or eating club pledge? This
is one of the main problems which
house and club men must face Mon
day when they decide the fate of j
winter quarter formal rushing.
Should rushing be moved to the
spring, houses and clubs would have
less time to help their pledges learn [
fraternity history and gain knowl- ;
edge about life in the house.
Pledges would have less time to
i get well-acquainted with actives. An
extra quarter's time for pledge train
ing is available under the present
j system.
Information must be learned about
| pulling off pledge sneaks. II only
! one quarter were available for the
' sneaks, it would be impossible to |

keep them from conflicting with
mid-terms.
Under the present winter rushing
system, a pledge can become more
certain that he has picked the house
or club best suited for him. Pledge
breaking and re-pledging a house
which is more suitable would be
much more difficult under the pro
posed system.
The busy spring social calendar
would be greatly multiplied, leaving
much less social activity in the win
ter if spring rushing came into being.
As Ron Wagner remarked at the
mass meeting Monday night, some
houses would bo forced to combine
their Spring overnight and pledge
formal parties. Several weeks early
in the quarter would be ruined for
the usual house parties because of
rushing.*
The present no-contact rule would
be put under an added strain if the
fraternity and club men vote to sus
tain it through another quarter.
Less of a strain exists under the
present system for the freshman who

wishes to pledge but is not bid dur
ing 'formal rushing. With winter
rushing, such a student would have
two quarters in which to try to gel
a bid.
This problem is 'especially impor
tant in the eating clubs where « j
large percentage pledge after formal ;
rushing ends.
Wagner, IFC president, declared |
that houses in which a large per- J
centage of members are athlete.s
would l ave a great advantage it [
rushing were put off another quar
ter. "The athletic field is a place
where fraternity men can associate
with freshmen without violating the
no-contact rule."
Mrs. Ellene Sumner, director of
Wilbur Hall, made the point Mon
day night tlu.-t freshmen could learn
more about houses and clubs in an
extra quarter.
This idea was opposed by a stu
dent. in the audience who declared
that much more is learned about the
individual houses dur in g formal
rushing.

would be greatly multiplied, leaving
much less social activity in the win
ter if spring rushing came into being.
As Ron Wagner remarked at the
mass meeting Monday night, some
houses would bo forced to combine
their Spring overnight and pledge
formal parties. Several weeks early
in the quarter would be ruined for
the usual house parties because of
rushing.*
The present no-contact rule would
be put under an added strain if the
fraternity and club men vote to sus
tain it through another quarter.
Less of a strain exists under the
present system for the freshman who

wishes to pledge but is not bid dur
ing 'formal rushing. With winter
rushing, such a student would have
two quarters in which to try to gel
a bid.
This problem is 'especially impor
tant in the eating clubs where « j
large percentage pledge after formal ;
rushing ends.
Wagner, IFC president, declared |
that houses in which a large per- J
centage of members are athlete.s
would l ave a great advantage it [
rushing were put off another quar
ter. "The athletic field is a place
where fraternity men can associate
with freshmen without violating the
no-contact rule."
Mrs. Ellene Sumner, director of
Wilbur Hall, made the point Mon
day night tlu.-t freshmen could learn
more about houses and clubs in an
extra quarter.
This idea was opposed by a stu
dent. in the audience who declared
that much more is learned about the
individual houses dur in g formal
rushing.
(This is the second of (wo articles I
concerning the possible change of
formal rushing from winter to spring
quarter. Yesterday's story contained
the advantages of spring rushing.)
Should a freshman's winter quar
ter be spent adjusting to Stanford
life or adjusting to the life of a fra
ternity or eating club pledge? This
is one of the main problems which
house and club men must face Mon
day when they decide the fate of j
winter quarter formal rushing.
Should rushing be moved to the
spring, houses and clubs would have
less time to help their pledges learn [
fraternity history and gain knowl- ;
edge about life in the house.
Pledges would have less time to
i get well-acquainted with actives. An
extra quarter's time for pledge train
ing is available under the present
j system.
Information must be learned about
| pulling off pledge sneaks. II only
! one quarter were available for the
' sneaks, it would be impossible to |

keep them from conflicting with
mid-terms.
Under the present winter rushing
system, a pledge can become more
certain that he has picked the house
or club best suited for him. Pledge
breaking and re-pledging a house
which is more suitable would be
much more difficult under the pro
posed system.
The busy spring social calendar
would be greatly multiplied, leaving
much less social activity in the win
ter if spring rushing came into being.
