# Stone Knocks Pressure From Student Activities
## Jenks, Olsen Vie In Debate Before Cubberley Crowd 
### STEW TOY 
A crowd of 175 students at
tended lest night's Cubberley
Auditorium debate on the over
emphasis of campus social ac
tivities.
Students Dave Jenks and Phil Ol
sen debated the controversial issue.
English Professor Wilfred H. Stone
opened the program with a general
discussion of the problem. Stone's
recent Daily article on social activi
ties sparked the sponsoring ASSU
Speech Association to stage the de
bate.
Stone stressed that he was merely
"speaking my piece" and not enter
ing into the formal discussion.
But he added he had seen too
many "bloodshot eyes imploring the
extension of a test or paper" to be
silent.
Stone said Stanford students have
a great intellectual potential, but
that "too much of their talent is used
in nothing more valuable than put
ting crepe paper through chicken
wire."
The most important thing for an
undergraduate to achieve here, he
said, is a "self-discovery," which is
often prevented by something verg
ing on a "social conspiracy" against
leisure time to "think things out."
He cited a plan to close the library
Big Game weekend as an example
of this "conspiracy." "If a student
wants to spend Big Game day in the
library instead of cheering for the
team," he said, "that's his business."
INTELLECTUAL CHANGE
But any change in the Stanford
intellectual atmosphere, Stone stress
ed, "must come from the students."
Junior Dave Jenks opened the de
bate, defending social activities but
admitting the need for some reform.
He said the question is whether or
not general student activities are
wanted. "I claim they are," said
Jenks.
He proposed lumping big all
school activities into one or two
"blow-outs," instead of spreading
them throughout the year.
"Everyone who stays on campus
would be expected to participate,"
Jenks said, "but they'll know exact
ly what's coming up and will be pre

pared for it. Students can study at j
the library ahead of time."
He advised students to complain j
if they don't like the way things are
now. "Don't wait till you've got your
finger stuck in the crepe paper to
gripe."
Phil Olsen, who spoke against so
ci a 1 overemphasis, commented on j
Jenks' proposal: "I'm wild for the
plan. No one could ask for more."
Olsen spoke against the social
pressures at Stanford which often
force students into activities against
their will.
"Sponsors," he said, "emphasize
social participation to freshmen.
They feel compelled to take part in
activities in which they are not in
terested just because everyone else
does.
"Social participation is a matter of
independent decision. No group can
be used for a model."
AUDIENCE DISCUSSION
Audience discussion followed the
debate. Some comments were:
Arliss Barnes, '56: "It's time we
learn to resist social pressure and
rise above this mass conformity."

Dick Gilbert. '58: "We have to
build up traditions. I enjoy them and
I'm sure others do. Without them the
school would be lacking in some
thing to break the habit of studying."
Jim Kennedy, '59: "I live at Wil
bur, where we are asked to miss
lunch and cut classes to gather wood
for the bonfire. I think bonfires and
floats should be left to those who
want to work on them. If there's not
enough interest, they should be
dropped."
Les Mazor, '58: "Our mistake lies
in the type of people who come here
because of our publicity. We often
give the impression that Stanford is
the place to come for stuffing floats
and going to parties."
Last night's debate was the first
in a series on campus problems to
be sponsored by the Speech Asso
ciation.
Commented Jack Hymans, campus
speech activities director: "We were
very pleased with the turnout. We
hope in the future to have a 'hotter'
program and to see some fireworks.
However it was an extremely good
beginning."
