Up and up she goes and where she stops no
body knows.
Such is the course of the volatile American
stock market today. And no ope can tell if it is
a lime for optimism or fear.
This week, as S anford students attendee! the
initial meeting of the campus investment plub,
tlnee developments made their impact on Wall
Street:
1. The Ford Foundation announced that
C,952,293 shares of common stock would be
issued by the famed auto company at the first
of next year. Immediately the market re
sponded in an upward move, and investment
houses tried to answer all the phone calls from
potential shareholders.
2. It was reported that the average American
corporation is making one-third more money
this year than last. The gain in earnings: 32.9
par cent.
3. General Motors, after announcing that it
would earn a profit exceeding $1 billion this
year, became the subject of a four-week inves
tigation by a Senate subcommittee headed by
Sen. Joseph C. O'Mahoney (D., Wyo.). Aim of
the probe is a "case study" of GM, no doubt
to find out if it is violating anti-trust laws.
Each of these occurrences provides an in
sight into the present market structure — a
Structure that eminent economist J. K. Galbraith
has testified could be as susceptible today as
it v/as in 1929.

In face of Galbraith's caution, the develop
ments indicate that the market at present is
fundamentally sound and healthy.
I! is, like the economy, a barefoot boy with
cheeks of tan who has grown by leaps and
bounds in the past few years.
The Ford announcement response showed
optimism—but not wild enthusiasm. The op
portunity to buy shares in the great rags-to
riches company is a bright one, indeed. Any
response less than the one which took place
would have raised doubts as to the health of
the barefoot boy.
The prosperity of American industry gives a
firm base to the rise in stock prices over the
past year. It indicates the "boom" is one
founded on reality, not wild speculation.
The General Motors investigation is a
healthy sign too. For it shows an element of
protective caution exists. It is wise to be in
guisitive as to the health of the barefoot boy —
to be watchful over all factors of the econ
omy.
For, while we have reason to be optimistic,
we must also temper our actions with caution
of the Galbraith variety. Today's prosperity
could become just as easily tomorrow's pov
erty if the young market gets out of hand in
an unguarded moment.
Right now, however, American industry is
one of the most promising investment outlets
available. The barefoot boy has real muscles.
Up and up she goes and where she stops no
body knows.

to be watchful over all factors of the econ
omy.
For, while we have reason to be optimistic,
we must also temper our actions with caution
of the Galbraith variety. Today's prosperity
could become just as easily tomorrow's pov
erty if the young market gets out of hand in
an unguarded moment.
Right now, however, American industry is
one of the most promising investment outlets
available. The barefoot boy has real muscles.
Up and up she goes and where she stops no
body knows.
Such is the course of the volatile American
stock market today. And no ope can tell if it is
a lime for optimism or fear.
This week, as S anford students attendee! the
initial meeting of the campus investment plub,
tlnee developments made their impact on Wall
Street:
1. The Ford Foundation announced that
C,952,293 shares of common stock would be
issued by the famed auto company at the first
of next year. Immediately the market re
sponded in an upward move, and investment
houses tried to answer all the phone calls from
potential shareholders.
2. It was reported that the average American
corporation is making one-third more money
this year than last. The gain in earnings: 32.9
par cent.
3. General Motors, after announcing that it
would earn a profit exceeding $1 billion this
year, became the subject of a four-week inves
tigation by a Senate subcommittee headed by
Sen. Joseph C. O'Mahoney (D., Wyo.). Aim of
the probe is a "case study" of GM, no doubt
to find out if it is violating anti-trust laws.
Each of these occurrences provides an in
sight into the present market structure — a
Structure that eminent economist J. K. Galbraith
has testified could be as susceptible today as
it v/as in 1929.

In face of Galbraith's caution, the develop
ments indicate that the market at present is
fundamentally sound and healthy.
I! is, like the economy, a barefoot boy with
cheeks of tan who has grown by leaps and
bounds in the past few years.
The Ford announcement response showed
optimism—but not wild enthusiasm. The op
portunity to buy shares in the great rags-to
riches company is a bright one, indeed. Any
response less than the one which took place
would have raised doubts as to the health of
the barefoot boy.
The prosperity of American industry gives a
firm base to the rise in stock prices over the
past year. It indicates the "boom" is one
founded on reality, not wild speculation.
The General Motors investigation is a
healthy sign too. For it shows an element of
protective caution exists. It is wise to be in
guisitive as to the health of the barefoot boy —
to be watchful over all factors of the econ
omy.
