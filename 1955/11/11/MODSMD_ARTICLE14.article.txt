To the Editor:
Some of us who must drive to campus are wonder
ing what genera! philosophy lies behind the Stanford
Police Department's traffic and parking regulations.
Parking violations can occur (1) through a student's
gross negligence, or deliberate intent to "get away
with it," or (2) through a student's lack of knowledge
about what constitutes a parking violation, though
he ha.s exerted reasonable effort to learn the proper
system. If my own experiences are a proper cri
terion, the Police Department apparently is not con
cerned with preventing violations of the second type,
though one can only guess at the reason.
Of the two parking tickets I have received this
quarter, one was for "blocking a lane" in the lot
behind the Ed building. I pointed out to the police
that it is difficult to park there properly at any time
because most of the white guide-lines are mostly or
completely obliterated, and that it is especially diffi
cult to guess the boundary lines in the early morning,
when there are not enough-other parked cars to serve
as reference points. To this, the police officer replied
that there was no point in repainting the lines be
cause "they wear out after awhile." If that is a logi
cal reason, then people should stop buying clothes,
because "they wear out after awhile."
The second ticket was for parking in a restricted
zone. Interestingly enough, the only parking sign I
later could find in either direction from where I
parked was one far behind me, at the end of the
block. That sign '-an be read from only one direction
(if one knows where to look for it), and it restricts
parking "ahead," although it is ambiguously planted

between two separate parking strips, one of which
apparently is not restricted.
True, when I registered my car, I was given a sheet
oi parking regulations, but after studying the accom
panying map I found it to lack sufficient detail to be
of use in the above situation.
1 also find myself wondering whether the Police
Department believes that traffic conditions have been
improved by shutting down several roads which, if
open, would remove some of the congestion from
roads now open. A certain number of students must
and/or will drive to classes, regardless of how many
roads are open.
In general, traffic and parking seem to have become
little more than games by which the Police Depart
ment collects fines on a grand scale, without visibly
playing fair with the drivers.

forbidden fruit
To the Editor:
The present liquor law defeats its own purpose by
creating a "forbidden fruit" out of a socially accept
able habit. Those who are permitted to drink exercise
far more moderation than those who come into pos
session of a forbidden item and have only a limited
time in which to enjoy it.
Also, prohibition pointed out that a law contrary
to public custom and desires fostered general dis
respect for all laws and law enforcement officers, not
only those dealing with prohibition, because the pub
lic became accustomed to breaking the law.

To the Editor:
Some of us who must drive to campus are wonder
ing what genera! philosophy lies behind the Stanford
Police Department's traffic and parking regulations.
Parking violations can occur (1) through a student's
gross negligence, or deliberate intent to "get away
with it," or (2) through a student's lack of knowledge
about what constitutes a parking violation, though
he ha.s exerted reasonable effort to learn the proper
system. If my own experiences are a proper cri
terion, the Police Department apparently is not con
cerned with preventing violations of the second type,
though one can only guess at the reason.
Of the two parking tickets I have received this
quarter, one was for "blocking a lane" in the lot
behind the Ed building. I pointed out to the police
that it is difficult to park there properly at any time
because most of the white guide-lines are mostly or
completely obliterated, and that it is especially diffi
cult to guess the boundary lines in the early morning,
when there are not enough-other parked cars to serve
as reference points. To this, the police officer replied
that there was no point in repainting the lines be
cause "they wear out after awhile." If that is a logi
cal reason, then people should stop buying clothes,
because "they wear out after awhile."
The second ticket was for parking in a restricted
zone. Interestingly enough, the only parking sign I
later could find in either direction from where I
parked was one far behind me, at the end of the
block. That sign '-an be read from only one direction
(if one knows where to look for it), and it restricts
parking "ahead," although it is ambiguously planted

between two separate parking strips, one of which
apparently is not restricted.
True, when I registered my car, I was given a sheet
oi parking regulations, but after studying the accom
panying map I found it to lack sufficient detail to be
of use in the above situation.
1 also find myself wondering whether the Police
Department believes that traffic conditions have been
improved by shutting down several roads which, if
open, would remove some of the congestion from
roads now open. A certain number of students must
and/or will drive to classes, regardless of how many
roads are open.
In general, traffic and parking seem to have become
little more than games by which the Police Depart
ment collects fines on a grand scale, without visibly
playing fair with the drivers.

forbidden fruit
To the Editor:
The present liquor law defeats its own purpose by
creating a "forbidden fruit" out of a socially accept
able habit. Those who are permitted to drink exercise
far more moderation than those who come into pos
session of a forbidden item and have only a limited
time in which to enjoy it.
Also, prohibition pointed out that a law contrary
to public custom and desires fostered general dis
respect for all laws and law enforcement officers, not
only those dealing with prohibition, because the pub
lic became accustomed to breaking the law.
