# Deep Shadows and Darkness Highlight Gaieties Dancers
## Flourescent Paint Against Solid Black Creates 'Spooky and Exciting' Effects 
### TERRY COMITO 
"Dancers in the 1955 Gaieties have to do their stuff not only
in deep shadows but, literally, in total darkness."
( .
Choreographer Maiy Sherman was not complaining: she was
just trying to give an idea of the range of dancing types in this

j year's show.
"The one number," she said, "is a
] sort of dance of shadows. Or, in
stead, a very exciting interplay of
shadows and the dancers. Those
whole things borrows a lot of its
j mood from progressive jazz.
"And the total darkness? Well,
that's the famous blacklight routine.
The audience sees just what has
been painted with florescent paint.
A very spooky effect, incidentally."
Just about every dance, and there
; are more of them than usual, seems
I to have a different gimmick.
MAY POLE
One, part of the first act finale, is
| a giant waltz around an 18 foot may
pole. Another, set in a playground,
| is full of cartwheels and somersalts.
In contrast to these is a relaxed
I softshoe routine by "a bunch of
| broken-down vaudeville comedians"
j in a number called "You Can Be
| Anyone on the Stage."
"And besides all this," Mary said,
"we have hundreds of dance bits
scattered all through other numbers,
including an authentic gong dancer
and, in a nursery school of all places,
one of the most torrid solos seen
here in a long time."
