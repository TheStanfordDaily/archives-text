CASANOVA EXPERIENCED
Last year, Oregon Coach Casanova
brought his team in to a third place
finish in PCC play. George Shaw,
now an outstanding quarterback
with the Baltimore Colts, did practi
cally everything for the Webfoots
but take tickets.
Casanova has an outstanding rec

of the East-West coaching crew both

last year and in this year's encoun
ter, Casanova is in his fifth year as
chief of the Oregon gridders.
Previous to coming to the Eugene
campus, Casanova toiled as head
mentor at Santa Clara and Pitts
burgh. The Broncos rang up 20 vic
tories against 13 defeats and four
ties while Casanova was at their

In 1950. Santa Clara whipped Babe
Pari 11 i and his Kentucky teammates,
21-13, in the Sugar Bowl under
Casanova's direction.

tackles. Backing up the first pair
are Jerry Nelson, a 202-pounder,
and Harry Johnson, 223. Both are
two-year lettermen as is Stiner.

the same high school in Coos Bay
open at guard for Casanova. Rean
ous Cochrane worked as a regular
last year and came right back to his
starting job this season. Eld on

Webfoot eleven.
Coach Chuck Taylor of the Cards
is expected to go with the same
starting lineup of Carl Isaacs and

Tony Mosich and Donn Carswell at
guard; and Joe Long at center in
the line.
Brodie. Gordy Young. Camera and
