# New Air Horn Will Echo Firehouse Whistle at Noon
## 
### JACK BYRNE 
If you hear a mellow two-tone echo to the Stanford Firehouse !
whistle at noon today, you'll know that Don Neumann's new air
horn is ready and willing to blow.
Neumann hopes to have the tank charged to a full 1800 pounds
air pressure by noon, then standing front of Bowman Alumni

House to deliver the answering blast.
'"I don't think I can beat it though,'"
he said. "You can hear it clear into
Palo Alto."
Neumann put about $100 worth of
material into the horn, and figures
that he can sell it at any time for
enough to repay him. The horn took
about twelve hours to build.
The biggest problem the senior
mechanical engineering major en- j
countered in the construction of the j
horn was finding a valve which j
would be easy to operate, yet would
withstand the terrific pressure. He
finally settled on rebuilding a valve
to suit.
Besides the two-tone trumpets, he
installed a wolf whistle for added
color.
Air for the horn must be secured
at an oxygen bottling plant or a
similar source, as no service station j
compressor is capable of packing the
1800 pounds of air pressure into the
reconverted skin divers' tank.
Neumann was apologetic for the ;
-bowing made by the horn at the !
USC game, where it operated at a
mere 1000 pounds pressure.
"Inferior Los Angeles air supply,"
he explains.
Neumann is a member of Theta Xi.
