# Deceased Feline, Telephone Calls Panic Libe Staff
## 
### JACK BYRNE 
Set your orange juice aside and
consider for a moment the case of
le chat mort, a deadly virus and a
number of mysterious telephone
calls.
Yesterday morning, a staff mem
ber of the Engineering Library dis
covered an "unquestionably dead"
cat lying on the floor of the stacks.
Beside the corpse was a bottle of
what claimed to be "schizoooeci
avirie."
Yesterday afternoon The Daily got
a call from a "Mr. Spencer," who
announced that a bottle of "B-Virus"
(also known as schizococci avirie)
had been stolen that morning.
The victim of the theft, he an
nounced, was his superior, Dr. Rus
sell of the San Jose Genetic Insti
tute.
Further, he announced, anyone
who had come in contact with the
virus should get over to the institute
for an innoculation or face meeting
the same unfortunate end as the cat.
"Mr. Spencer" also put in an ap
pearance at the Stanford Library to
announce that Dr. Russell would ar
rive shortly to supervise the sterili
zation of the area.
The library, to say the least, was
in a snit. The cat was removed in a
manner of a victim of the Black
Plague. The Health Service was
called in to fumigate the stacks.
But when people began asking
questions, the story took on strange
aspects. The Stanford Bacteriology
Department never heard of either a
"B-Virus" or "schizococci avirie."
Further, there ain't no such ani
mal as a San Jose Genetic Institute.
San Jose State College has no bac
teriology department, nor any De
partment of Genetics.
And when Library officials started
looking back on the whole thing, Mr.
Spencer did look a bit young; say in
his late teens.
