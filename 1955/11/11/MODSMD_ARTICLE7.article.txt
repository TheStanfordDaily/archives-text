# UCLA Air Horn Disappears Again
## 
### 
Well, the ill-fated UCLA air
horn is gone again. This time,
however, Stanford students can
disclaim any responsibility for its
disappearance from the Brui 11
clutches.
The Stockton Record reports
that the double-trumpeted horn
was pilfered last Saturday night
from the car of a southland stu
dent which was parked on the
College of the Pacific campus.
The horn had been vigorously
used in the COP game that day,
but there are no signs that it will
reappear in time for UCLA's battle
with Washington tomorrow.
