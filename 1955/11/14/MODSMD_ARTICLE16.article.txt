# Pompon Girls Overshadow Oregon Team
## 
### 
Oregon's pompon girls came
to visit Saturday. And oh, yes,
they brought a football team
along with them.
The football Ducks didn't look Loo
impressive in losing, but the girls—
that was another story.
Twisting, twirling and gyrating
through their routines they brought
loud ringing cheers from the highly
appreciative Stanford men's rooting
section.
Television viewers had a good look
at the bouncing belles from the
Northwest too, as technicians wheel
ed their cameras right up to the
scene of their dancing in front of
visiting Oregon's rooting section.
With all these eyes on them the
girls didn't falter—not one bit. The
Oregon yell leader, however, had his
problems — too many lookers, not
enough yellers. In desperation he
admonished the Duck section to
"talk .anyway, even if you don't want
to yell."
There were other visitors at the
game, about 1100 parents of Stanford
freshmen. This was the second an
nual Parent's Day on the Farm.
In a morning assembly they were
welcomed by President Wallace
Sterling and George Ralph, ASSU
president and heard a faculty panel
under the direction of H. Donald
Winbigler, dean of students.
