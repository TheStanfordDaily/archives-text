# rushing decisionâ€”long overdue
## 
### 
Hu' hing in spring quarter or rushing in win
ter quarter? We've heard the reasons why and
the reasons why not, from both viewpoints, for
a couple of years now.
The duration of the discussion indicates that
there are points of merit on both sides. But the
duration also indicates that the eating clubs
and the fraternities have been reluctant to
make a firm decision. The proposals for spring
ru .liing have never been defeated, just post
poned till "next year."
From the atmosphere at last week's meeting
to air the controversy and from the scuttlebutt
t!.at drifts in, we suspect that a firm, long-over
due decision will be made tonight. That is,
v/inter quarter rushing in a landslide vote.
Such a decision, we feel, would be the right
one. It's not because we're reluctant to change
(change is something we don't get enough of
around here) or because we can't see merit in

spring quarter rushing on a trial basis. It's sim
ply because, all aspects considered, we think
v/inter quarter is the best time.
The principal argument for spring quarter
says give the freshmen another quarter of aca
demic practice before submitting them to the
weeks - without - studying caused by rushing.
Admittedly, the winter grade-point average of
freshman men remains aoout the same as in
autumn, or even drops a little. But is this sig
nificant? In recent years there has been a cor
responding drop in Roble and Lagunita grades.
Conversely, we feel that compressing all the
activities and pressures involved in rushing
and pledging into one now-or-never quarter
will result in more serious harm to the scholar
ship of all freshmen, eating club and fraternity
men, than the current system.
But no matter which way the vote may go,
the most important need is to resolve the issue.
Let's not revive the same problem every year.
