Chuck Taylor and the footballers — along
with Rally Com, of course—are getting ready
for Big Game. Most of the rest of us are getting
ready lor after Big Game.
We don't know whether are aware of it
or not, but the Cardinals, Rally Corn's big
brothers and sisters, are also getting ready.
"Prepare for the Bear" is their motto.
Actually, they may have something. Get
your work done early so that you can go to the
bonfire-rally, see Gaieties, live it up in ihe City
Friday night, BEAT CAL Saturday afternoon,
then celebrate on into Thanksgiving vacation.
The basic idea is excellent: If you're going
to have a rally, a Gaieties, a beer (rather, Bear)
bust, a band in the city—make sure people
ccme so the events will be successful.
And Cardinals is implementing the whole
thing,, more or less. They've arranged to keep
ihe Libe open tonight through Wednesday

until 11 (that doesn't mean much, but it gets
the idea across).
They've contacted faculty and asked them
to schedule'no more midterms and term papers
for the end of this week. They say the faculty
rs in favor of the whole program.
Sounds great from here, too. Except we have
a midterm Friday morning, thank you.
At any rate, so far, so good. But what's this
talk about picketing the Libe Friday. Cardinals
can't be serious. If they are, Professor Stone
states the case: "If a student wants to spend
Big Game in the Library instead of cheering
for the team, that's his business."
But they can't be serious. And if they are,
whom are they going to find to waste the after
noon in front of the Libe when they could be
out at the Bear beer bust, ABC or no ABC.
That's the story about preparing for the Bear.
See you in the Libe tonight at 11?
