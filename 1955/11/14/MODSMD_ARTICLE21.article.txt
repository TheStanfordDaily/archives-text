Well, here it is the third week in November,
Big Game week, turkey-time coming up, and
only 36 shopping days till Christmas. Heavens
to Betsy, how tirna does fly . . .
* * *
Tomorrow night promises to be a thick one
at Mem Aud:
At 7:30, M. Ramaswamy, Indian leftfal hot
shot currently packing them in at the Law
School, will give a Tuesday Evening Series lec
ture on "The Supreme Court and Civil Liber
ties," to which the public is invited.
Later on in the evening (the calendar says
8:30, the tickets say 9:15; don't try to figure it
out, just follow the ticket):, Ram's Head's 61st
Big Game Gaieties takes to the boards for the
first of a four-performance series. Wednesday
and Friday it starts at 8:30; Thursday the cur
tain time is again 9:15.
On the basis of having given a jaundiced
and weary eye to the dress rehearsal, we'd
tend to recommend it. Gaieties does not have
that professional gloss, but it is a very good
college musical revue, and worth anybody's
price of admission. And with a Wagnerian
tuba and a Southern Pacific locomotive whistle
in the orchestra pit, you're guaranteed a wide
awake evening . . .
★ * *
Wednesday afternoon's Little Theater Mati
nee features Wendell Cole of the S&D Depart
ment with a collection of movies (some no
table, all old) and an accompanying talk en
titled "Pioneers in the American Film Indus
try." It's at 4:15.
★ * *
Exhibit Note: In case you've been so busy
living the gay life, gathering rosebuds while ye
may and all, and so haven't been Libe
lately, you should know about the exhibit
they've got in there now. Called "This Is the
American Earth," it's got some teriffic photo
graphs by Ansel Adams, and a conglomeration
of paintings, odds and ends, quotations, and
stuff, by various other talent. It'll be there until
the end of November, but it's well worth mak
ing a special trip over to see.
* * *
Reminder: Wednesday nights at 9:30 they're
having the Candlelight Service over in Mem
Church, and it's sort of a nice way to finish up

the evening. Little organ -music, little prayer,
lots of quiet. Runs about a half-hour.
* * #
Also Wednesday night at 8 in Cubberley,
the AAUP (American Association of University
Professors) is joining the crowd of aroused citi
zens taking pokes at Stanford life.
The profs are buttering up their tonsils for a
discussion on "Important Problems in Under
graduate Education at Stanford," to which "all
faculty are invited." If any of you peons want
to get in, rip the elbows out of your mossiest
sports jacket and turn your pipe upside down
before setting out.
* * *
If life is getting too much for you, if you've
got Peninsula nerves, hot flashes or cranial
charley horses, the Physics Department can
help. Professor Bloch can solve your prob
lems. The professor will reveal the secret
which has won him recognition at the courts
of ruling princes of Europe and offers to appear
on morning TV programs. It's Thursday after
noon in a lecture called "Nuclear Relaxation,"
Room 372 at 4.
Thursday night is bonfire night.
If (a) you can scrape the fur off your rooter's
cap, (b) you're a Stanford graduate and (c) you
can prove you're of age, you can go to cock
tail parties and such at the hotels in the City
and listen to the Stanford Band Friday night.
Saturday, we play Cal (oh, you've heard?).
And if it's a sunny day, no slips . . . just may
be .. . Say—it's been so long—what are we
supposed to do if we win?
* * *
Sunday at 4, if you feel the need of a little
soothing peaceful music after the celebration,
Herbert B. Nanney, from the Knoll, is giving
an organ recital in Memorial Church.
Oompah pa-pa, oompah pa-pa, and it's Clif
ton Webb in "The Stars and Stripes Forever"
Sunday night, plus one cartoon and a short.
What a program. And still 20 cents.
The Fact Corner: Market prices for dirty
eggs are lower than for clean eggs.
Well, here it is the third week in November,
Big Game week, turkey-time coming up, and
only 36 shopping days till Christmas. Heavens

8:30, the tickets say 9:15; don't try to figure it
out, just follow the ticket):, Ram's Head's 61st
Big Game Gaieties takes to the boards for the
first of a four-performance series. Wednesday
and Friday it starts at 8:30; Thursday the cur
tain time is again 9:15.
On the basis of having given a jaundiced
and weary eye to the dress rehearsal, we'd
tend to recommend it. Gaieties does not have
that professional gloss, but it is a very good
college musical revue, and worth anybody's
price of admission. And with a Wagnerian
tuba and a Southern Pacific locomotive whistle
in the orchestra pit, you're guaranteed a wide
awake evening . . .
★ * *
Wednesday afternoon's Little Theater Mati
nee features Wendell Cole of the S&D Depart
ment with a collection of movies (some no
table, all old) and an accompanying talk en
titled "Pioneers in the American Film Indus
try." It's at 4:15.
★ * *
Exhibit Note: In case you've been so busy
living the gay life, gathering rosebuds while ye
may and all, and so haven't been Libe
lately, you should know about the exhibit
they've got in there now. Called "This Is the
American Earth," it's got some teriffic photo
graphs by Ansel Adams, and a conglomeration
of paintings, odds and ends, quotations, and
stuff, by various other talent. It'll be there until
the end of November, but it's well worth mak
ing a special trip over to see.
* * *
Reminder: Wednesday nights at 9:30 they're
having the Candlelight Service over in Mem
Church, and it's sort of a nice way to finish up

the evening. Little organ -music, little prayer,
lots of quiet. Runs about a half-hour.
* * #
Also Wednesday night at 8 in Cubberley,
the AAUP (American Association of University
Professors) is joining the crowd of aroused citi
zens taking pokes at Stanford life.
The profs are buttering up their tonsils for a
discussion on "Important Problems in Under
graduate Education at Stanford," to which "all
faculty are invited." If any of you peons want
to get in, rip the elbows out of your mossiest
sports jacket and turn your pipe upside down
before setting out.
* * *
If life is getting too much for you, if you've
got Peninsula nerves, hot flashes or cranial
charley horses, the Physics Department can
help. Professor Bloch can solve your prob
lems. The professor will reveal the secret
which has won him recognition at the courts
of ruling princes of Europe and offers to appear
on morning TV programs. It's Thursday after
noon in a lecture called "Nuclear Relaxation,"
Room 372 at 4.
Thursday night is bonfire night.
If (a) you can scrape the fur off your rooter's
cap, (b) you're a Stanford graduate and (c) you
can prove you're of age, you can go to cock
tail parties and such at the hotels in the City
and listen to the Stanford Band Friday night.
Saturday, we play Cal (oh, you've heard?).
And if it's a sunny day, no slips . . . just may
be .. . Say—it's been so long—what are we
supposed to do if we win?
* * *
Sunday at 4, if you feel the need of a little
soothing peaceful music after the celebration,
Herbert B. Nanney, from the Knoll, is giving
an organ recital in Memorial Church.
Oompah pa-pa, oompah pa-pa, and it's Clif
ton Webb in "The Stars and Stripes Forever"
Sunday night, plus one cartoon and a short.
What a program. And still 20 cents.
The Fact Corner: Market prices for dirty
eggs are lower than for clean eggs.
Well, here it is the third week in November,
Big Game week, turkey-time coming up, and
only 36 shopping days till Christmas. Heavens
to Betsy, how tirna does fly . . .
* * *
Tomorrow night promises to be a thick one
at Mem Aud:
At 7:30, M. Ramaswamy, Indian leftfal hot
shot currently packing them in at the Law
School, will give a Tuesday Evening Series lec

price of admission. And with a Wagnerian
tuba and a Southern Pacific locomotive whistle
in the orchestra pit, you're guaranteed a wide
awake evening . . .

Exhibit Note: In case you've been so busy
living the gay life, gathering rosebuds while ye
may and all, and so haven't been Libe

they've got in there now. Called "This Is the
American Earth," it's got some teriffic photo
graphs by Ansel Adams, and a conglomeration
of paintings, odds and ends, quotations, and
stuff, by various other talent. It'll be there until
the end of November, but it's well worth mak
ing a special trip over to see.

Reminder: Wednesday nights at 9:30 they're
having the Candlelight Service over in Mem
Church, and it's sort of a nice way to finish up

the evening. Little organ -music, little prayer,
lots of quiet. Runs about a half-hour.

Also Wednesday night at 8 in Cubberley,
the AAUP (American Association of University
Professors) is joining the crowd of aroused citi
zens taking pokes at Stanford life.
The profs are buttering up their tonsils for a
discussion on "Important Problems in Under
graduate Education at Stanford," to which "all
faculty are invited." If any of you peons want
to get in, rip the elbows out of your mossiest
sports jacket and turn your pipe upside down
before setting out.

If life is getting too much for you, if you've
got Peninsula nerves, hot flashes or cranial
charley horses, the Physics Department can
help. Professor Bloch can solve your prob
lems. The professor will reveal the secret
which has won him recognition at the courts
of ruling princes of Europe and offers to appear
on morning TV programs. It's Thursday after
noon in a lecture called "Nuclear Relaxation,"
Room 372 at 4.
Thursday night is bonfire night.
If (a) you can scrape the fur off your rooter's
cap, (b) you're a Stanford graduate and (c) you
can prove you're of age, you can go to cock
tail parties and such at the hotels in the City
and listen to the Stanford Band Friday night.
Saturday, we play Cal (oh, you've heard?).
And if it's a sunny day, no slips . . . just may
be .. . Say—it's been so long—what are we
supposed to do if we win?

Sunday at 4, if you feel the need of a little
soothing peaceful music after the celebration,
Herbert B. Nanney, from the Knoll, is giving
an organ recital in Memorial Church.
Oompah pa-pa, oompah pa-pa, and it's Clif
ton Webb in "The Stars and Stripes Forever"
Sunday night, plus one cartoon and a short.
What a program. And still 20 cents.

eggs are lower than for clean eggs.
