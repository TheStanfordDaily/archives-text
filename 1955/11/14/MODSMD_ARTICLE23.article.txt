# Students Hear NSA Leader At Cal Meet
## Class Defines NSA, Student Govt. Roles 
### HELEN DEWAR 
The important role of the Na
tional Students' Association as a
nation-wide extension of student
government offering a "unique
contribution to the intellectual
community" was set forth by
NSA national president Stanford
Glass at the regional meeting
held last weekend at Berkeley.
Over 75 representatives from eight
California schools heard Glass solid
ly link the goals and potential ac
complishments of NSA with those of
the student community and espe
cially student government, which he
pointed to as a vital factor in the
success and development of higher
education.
Student self-government, G la s s
pointed out, is "in itself one of the
most important educational facili
ties," but, he said, very often student
activities are for the sole purpose of
"releasing steam," and we find that
too many campus functions serve
only this limited purpose.
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY
From a nation-wide study tour of
colleges and universities, Glass ob
served that many student govern
ments have recognized that the re
sponsibility for studying and re-or
ganizing student activities lies with
in the realm of campus governments
and added that he was "impressed
by the general awareness of the
problem and the acMve attempts to
solve it."
On the contention that it is the re
sponsibility of student governments
to see that the best interest of the
students are carried out, NSA is
dedicated to an attempt to solve
problems of student government.
"NSA," Glass said, "is not an or
ganization to supply | such things as|
a student discount service, but rather
to supplement student government
in exchanging information, creating
interest in the student community,
speaking for NSA schools in national
legislation, and perceiving and solv
ing student problems.
STUDENT APATHY
In a survey conducted by NSA
under a $30,000 Ford Foundation re
search project, it was found that in
terest in student government was
the most deficient in the most im
portant areas of the educational
community.
According to Jim Sammet, Stan
ford's NSA co-ordinator, the impor
tant work at the weekend conference
was done by the international, na
tional and campus affairs commis
sions who dealt with the details of
the regional program.
An International Student Relations
Seminar for the California-Nevada-
Hawaii region is scheduled for the
weekend of February 18, 19 and 20
at Mills College. Throe delegates
from each school will attend the
study sessions.
Deadline for *Once Around the
Quad" items is p.m. of the day
before publication.
