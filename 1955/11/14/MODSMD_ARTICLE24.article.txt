# Judge Crothers Returns To Dedicate New Dorm
## Gift for $680,000 Engineering Grad Dorm Culminates Half-Century of Stanford Service 
### JIM PALMER 
The judge was back on the Farm Saturday.
Sixty years ago the fourth son of a pioneer family that came
West in '83 had stepped forward with other members of Stanford's
first graduating class to receive a diploma.
Now George Edward Crolhers, still spry at the age of 85, was

back to dedicate the most recent pai t .i
of his vast contributions to the Uni- j
versity that had started him on the
way to a life of achievement and
success.
The former Superior Court Judge j
made his way slowly into Crothers
Memorial Hall for Graduate Engi- (
neers Saturday morning.
Dozens of alumni milled around in
the corridor and rooms of the spank
ing-new, $080,000 dormitory, admir
ing the beauty and utility of the
building which was dedicated in the
name of Margaret Jane Crothers,
mother of the Judge and his nine
brothers and sisters.
"Doesn't look like this place could
be as much fun us the old Encina,"
quipped two elderly cane-carrying
grads as they inspected one of the
rooms. "They wouldn't let you wreck
it."
It was back in 1898 when young
attorney Crothers, a close, personal
friend of Mrs. Stanford, became in
volved in the problems of settling
the Senator's estate and taxation
thereof facing the University.
His work led to an amendment of
the state constitution involving Uni- !
versity trusts, estates and endow
ment. It proved to be a life-saver
for Stanford.
Crothers, who had received the
master's degree in law in 1896, short
ly became the first alumnus to be
named a trustee of the University. ;
He served for 10 years in this posi- 1
tion, from 1902 to 1912.

Now here he was, after more than
a half-century of devoted service to
the University, back on the Farm.
President Wallace Sterling was the
first to speak as the ceremonies
began in the crowded meeting room
on the ground floor of the new dorm.
Then came Dean Terman, Hall
President Joseph H. Kullback ami
Board of Trustees President Lloyd
W. Dinkelspiel.
Each paid his tribute to the Judge.
Terman noted that the Crother's
residence halls had "revolutionized
campus living" since the earlier days
"B.C.â€”Before Crothers."
Then it was time for the Judge
himself to speak. Haltingly and with
pride, he described early life at the
University "when tuition, board,
lodging and the etceteras were only
$20 a month."
