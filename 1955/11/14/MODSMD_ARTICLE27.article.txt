# Casanova Calls Stanford Best Oregon Has Faced This Year
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
"Stanford, today, was the best team we have faced all year."
These were the words of Duck coach Len Casanova after his Web
foots had been whipped into submission by an alert Stanford
eleven.
Oregon, still clinging to a mathematical chance to represent the

PCC in the Rose Bowl, and fresh
from victories over Idaho, Washing
ton State, Arizona and California,
had gone into Saturday's contest the
darkhorse to pull an upset over the
Indians.
Such was not the case, however,
as John Brodie, Bill Tarr and Gordie
Young piled up tremendous yardage
early in the game to start what
turned out to be a rout. The graying
Oregon mentor said that Brodie is
the best passer that his team has run
up against this season. Then Len
went on to say that he considered
the present Card quarterback a more
accurate passer than former Indian
great, Bobby Garrett.
When asked how Oregon's per
formance Saturday stood up with
iheir play in previous games, Len
admitted that he was disappointed
and mentioned that the team's tac
kling was the worst he had seen all
year. "Our boys are young." said
Casanova, "and they got fooled a lot
of times they shouldn't have."
Casanova said that Stanford's pass
patterns had been well scouted but
that his secondary was just caught
flat footed time and time again.
"Our deep defense was usually a

stop or two behind the receiver," the
coach told reporters, and this was
why Chuck Taylor's passers were
able to complete 18 for 20 throws.
During the conference with the
coach, the inevitable question of a
comparison between California and
Stanford came up. Oregon walloped
Pappy Waldorf's squad, 21 to 0, four
weeks ago *to start their winning
streak.
Casanova simply said that he con
sidered the scores themselves the
best comparison between the two
teams. However, the Oregon mentor
agreed that California undoubtedly
has improved since his team beat
the Bears-

ANOTHER TOUCHDOWN —Stanford halfback Paul Camera (32) fights his way into the end
zone to account for Stanford's third touchdown Saturday. Camera took John Brodie's pass on
the Oregon 11-yard line and didn't stop until he got the six. An unidentified Webfoot attempts
to hold back Camera while Oregon quarterback Tom Crabtree (12) comes up too late to help.
