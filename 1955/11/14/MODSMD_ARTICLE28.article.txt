# Frosh Fall to Cal, 33-14, In Traditional Little Game
## 
### JIM PIGOTT 
It was a case of too little and too late when Stanford's Papooses
fought a losing battle with the California Cubs last Saturday in the
traditional Little Game. The final score was 33 to 14.
California, playing on its home field in the preliminary contest
to the Cal-Oregon State game, played a fired-up brand of football

throughout the game and. taking*
advantage of every Papoose miscue,
was able to tally five times.
The first touchdown of three
second quarter scores came when
sharp-shooting Cal quarterback Joe
Knapp threw a 35 yard scoring pass
to left half George Gillespie. The
latter ran untouched into the end
zone from the five yard line.
After the kickoff, Cal tallied im
mediately again when Jack Hart, the
other Cub half, recovered a Papoose
fumble on Stanford's 21-yard line
and scored on the second play from
i scrimmage.
ANOTHER FUMBLE
The third score of the half came
just before the gun went off and was
the result of another Stanford bob
ble. This time it was Cal end Dick j
Paige, who stood out as a receiver
of Knapp's passes all day, who re
covered the ball for the Cubs on the
visitor's 12-yard line.
The first play after the recovery
saw Knapp hit Bob Comartin in the
1 end zone for the six points. Bob
i Gonzales converted the twentieth
1 point with 40 seconds remaining to
be played.

Stanford's first score came on one
of the most spectacular plays of the
game. With Alameda's Chuck Butler
quarterbacking the club, the Pa
pooses sent speedy Denny Farrar
straight down the field, and the end
outdistanced all Cal defenders to
take Butler's perfect pass on the run
and race across the goal line.
The play was good for 43 yards.
Jim Arthur's conversion made it 7
to 20.
Shortly after Farrar's catch and
score, Stanford tallied again when
halfback Dick Mires took a Cal punt
in his own territory and ran nearly
60 yards through the entire Cal team
for the touchdown.
ARTHUR CONVERTS
Arthur converted and now Stan
ford was within striking distance of
the Cubs at 14 to 20.
The Papooses took over the ball
early in the fourth quarter and
worked to a first down on the Cal
eight, but here the winners stiffened
and eventually took over the ball on
the three.

It was a case of too little and too late when Stanford's Papooses
fought a losing battle with the California Cubs last Saturday in the
traditional Little Game. The final score was 33 to 14.
California, playing on its home field in the preliminary contest
to the Cal-Oregon State game, played a fired-up brand of football

throughout the game and. taking*
advantage of every Papoose miscue,
was able to tally five times.
The first touchdown of three
second quarter scores came when
sharp-shooting Cal quarterback Joe
Knapp threw a 35 yard scoring pass
to left half George Gillespie. The
latter ran untouched into the end
zone from the five yard line.
After the kickoff, Cal tallied im
mediately again when Jack Hart, the
other Cub half, recovered a Papoose
fumble on Stanford's 21-yard line
and scored on the second play from
i scrimmage.
ANOTHER FUMBLE
The third score of the half came
just before the gun went off and was
the result of another Stanford bob
ble. This time it was Cal end Dick j
Paige, who stood out as a receiver
of Knapp's passes all day, who re
covered the ball for the Cubs on the
visitor's 12-yard line.
The first play after the recovery
saw Knapp hit Bob Comartin in the
1 end zone for the six points. Bob
i Gonzales converted the twentieth
1 point with 40 seconds remaining to
be played.

Stanford's first score came on one
of the most spectacular plays of the
game. With Alameda's Chuck Butler
quarterbacking the club, the Pa
pooses sent speedy Denny Farrar
straight down the field, and the end
outdistanced all Cal defenders to
take Butler's perfect pass on the run
and race across the goal line.
The play was good for 43 yards.
Jim Arthur's conversion made it 7
to 20.
Shortly after Farrar's catch and
score, Stanford tallied again when
halfback Dick Mires took a Cal punt
in his own territory and ran nearly
60 yards through the entire Cal team
for the touchdown.
ARTHUR CONVERTS
Arthur converted and now Stan
ford was within striking distance of
the Cubs at 14 to 20.
The Papooses took over the ball
early in the fourth quarter and
worked to a first down on the Cal
eight, but here the winners stiffened
and eventually took over the ball on
the three.
