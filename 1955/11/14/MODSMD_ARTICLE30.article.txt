# Card Soccermen Come Back To Gain Tie with Teutonia AC
## 
### 
A second - half penalty shot
by Stanford's Charles Annicq
brought the Indian soccer squad
from behind and gave the Stan
fords a 3-3 tie with the strong
Teutonia AC team of San Fran
cisco Saturday.
Stanford drew first blood in the
game on first-half goals by Bill
Wren and Peter Huang and the half
ended with Stanford leading 2-0.
Teutonia came back in the second
half on three goals by Pat Foley to
take the lead until Annicq's penalty
counter tied the score.
Stanford got numerous shots at
Teutonia's goal in the second half
but couldn't drill the ball through
due to the fine work of goalie Ken
Woods, who last year was an Ail-
American for Stanford.
NON-LEAGUE GAME
The encounter was a non-league
affair so did not affect Stanford's
fourth place standing in the North
ern California Intercollegiate S.occer
Conference. The Indians will wind
up conference action against Cal
next Saturday at Stanford.
Cal beat City College of San Fran-

Cisco last Saturday to take third
place .behind the San Franciscans.
Should Stanford beat the Bears next
Saturday, the Indians, Cal and City
College will end the season in a
three way tie for second place be
hind champion University of San
Francisco.

The JV soccer team dropped a 3-2
decision Saturday to the Interna
tional Relations Club of San Mateo
for their first loss of the season.
The JV's will finish their season
next Saturday against the Cal JV's
in a preliminary to the varsity con
