# Stanford Librarian Quits Post After 32 Years' Service
## 
### 
After 32 years of service to Stan
ford University libraries, Miss Jean
nette M. Hitchcock has retired as
chief of the Division of Special Col
lections, emeritus.
Miss Hitchcock joined the Stan
ford Library staff as a cataloguer in
1923 and in 1933 she became senior
bibliographer. The idea of a special
room for rare books started in the
early 30's. In 193(3 Miss Hitchcock
was made keeper of rare books and
in 1938 the Bender Room, converted
from a storage area, was opened as
a rare book room.
In 1947, when the Bender Room
had expanded into several collec
tions, which are now housed on three
floors of the library, chief of the
Division of Special Collections was
added to her title.
Like many librarians, she has been
surrounded by books all her life but
just hasn't had time to read many
of them. '"Now," she declared, "I'll j
have time to do some more reading,
I'll rest, and I hope to do some trav- i
eling." She also plans to do some 112
bibliographical writing in the near j
future.
Although Miss Hitchcock has been
married for a number of years,/she
has been known professionally by i
her maiden name. Her married name j
is Mrs. Franklin L. Hopkins.
