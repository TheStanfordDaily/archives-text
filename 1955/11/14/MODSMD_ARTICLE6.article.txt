NEW YORKâ€”The United States
announced today that it will not
oppose United Nations membership
for four Soviet satellites provided
that 13 free nations are admitted as
new members to the world organiza
tion.
U. S. Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge Jr., in a rare Sunday news
conference, put forward the United
States' new proposal in a move to
break the seven - year East - West
deadlock on the admission of new
UN members.
Lodge said, ' The United States in
tends to vote for the admission of
the 13 and to abstain on the others."
He said the satellites would include
Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Ro
mania "since it is obvious that Outer
Mongolia cannot make the grade."
