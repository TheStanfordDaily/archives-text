from both sides, taking into consid
eration the best interests of Stanford
men, both as freshmen going
through rushing and as fraternity
and club men who have already
done so and can see both sides of
the question.
"We feel that our deferred rushing
set-up at Stanford has great advan
tages over those at many other col
leges. But since we are the first to
admit that it isn't perfect, we are
always open to suggestions toward
improving it.
WELCOME SUGGESTIONS

class of '59 will benefit from the
study which we are giving our rush
ing program, and we welcome all
suggestions."
