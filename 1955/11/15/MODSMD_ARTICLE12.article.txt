# RAM'S HEAD RAISES CURTAIN ON 1955 BIG GAME GAIETIES
## 51st Traditional Revue to Open Tonight in Memorial Auditorium Show Has ‘No Particular Slant,’ Says Lowry; Continuity, 'Something for Everyone' Stressed 
### TERRY COMITO 
Tonight at 9:15 in Memorial Auditorium Ram's Head will unveil
the 51st Big Game Gaieties. We were able, despite the cycloin
activity, to stop director S. Bruce Lowry for a last minute run
down on the show.
"My favorite subject," he said, "but there's been no single

'slant' we've followed. We've tried
to do everything a revue CAN do
and a couple of things that we're not
sure if a revue can do or not.
"When the show is funny, w< \ <
tried to make h VERY funny; wli i
it's sad, it's lugubrious. We only g< t:
arty twice, or a little arty, and v.e
make a sincere effort to keep it hoi L
and honest."
Then he did think of an angle
"A variety show," he said, "inn I,
by definition, sacrifice some unity
for the sake of the variety which i
its chief claim to fame. Any stric
tures would be an injustice to the
individual acts.
"So we've got a theme. Everythin •
is built,- in a very general way,
around 'Games,' and between a few
of the acts a "little man" type stum
bles on and off the stage, comment
ing on the show, the theme, and the
deplorable state of life in general.''
There are other innovations too.
"The death of any revue/' Lowry
said with heat, "is a lapse between
numbers. And nothing makes a
deader spot than fillers: tempori/in
antics on the part of some half
embarassed actor to cover a scene
change.
"We will, therefore, not fill, hut
play main numbers before the cur
tain in order to move swiftly in* >
the larger numbers behind it. Tin
means that almost twice as much
good material can be packed into i 1
show—featured, intrinsic materia] —
and everybody, actor and audience,
is saved a lot of embarassment.
Lowry stopped. "You want a
clincher?" he asked.
We did.
"Then you can «say that thin i.-,
something in this show for ev r
taste and a few "crowd pleaser lor
everybody: skits that range i'roi
"suggestive" to "prudish," mti; i"al
numbers including a 20-minute
discourse on love, a cowboy a
blues fugue, a ballad here and there,
an "inspirational type song," and a
three part salute to rah-rah week
and the team-team-team."
Tickets for the team-team-ti am
show are on sale for 90 cents, $1.2 >
and $1.50 at Mem Aud box oflice.
Curtain time is 9:15 p.m. tonight
and Thursday night, 8:30 Wednesday
