# the 						next step
## 
### 
The vote on winter versus spring quarter
rushing has been taken and is all but official.
The vole was decisive; in fact, it was over
whelming. The eating clubs and the fraterni
ties wan: winter quarter rushing almost to a
man.
As we indicated yesterday, we desired a
decisive vote, a clear-cut statement of rushing
policy from the Row and the clubs. Now that
such a policy has been established, we hope'
the houses and the clubs, this year end in the
future, will work from this policy and not try
to change the system every year.
But we hope that the implications of the con
troversy will not be forgotten. And with the
main problem settled, the implications can be
investigated.
While winter quarter rushing may be the
most practical, obviously the system is not

ideal. If it were, there would not have been
objections and the proposal to change to spring
would not have arisen.
Improvement of what we h&ve and what we
voted for is the next step. Make winter quarter
rushing work better.
Eliminate the serious conflict between fresh
man living group loyalties and pledge class
loyalty. The two affiliations per se ere not in
compatible.
The clubs and fraternities need to show more
consideration for the freshmen who have not
pledged v/hen time approaches. And
they must also be more considerate of the
academic requirements of their own pledges.
These are just a couple of the problems that
have been subordinate to the main issue.' Per
haps if sufficient improvements are forthcom
ing, the pressure-cooker effect of rushing itself
can be relieved.
