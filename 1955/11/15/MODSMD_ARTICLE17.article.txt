The Baylor Bear that was stolen Nov. 3 from
the Baylor campus is now back at home.
The cub was returned to Baylor on an ulti
matum from university deans. His four captors
drove the cub to Waco, staked him out in a
cemetery and phoned Baylor Dean W. C. Perry
to come and get the 100-pound mascot.
But upon returning from their mission, Texas
men discovered that their mascot, a 450-pound
steer named Bevo VI, had been stolen.
The gates to Bevo's stall and pen at a farm
near Austin were wide open when a caretaker
went to water him. The kidnapers were
warned that the steer was half wild and had
gone on a rampage during the Rice-Baylor
game earlier in the season.
However, damages caused by the steer were
covered by a liability policy purchased from
Lloyd's of London. The policy covers bodily
injury up to S5OOO and property up to $10,000.
The Texas men were also worried about the
fate of the steer itself. Predecessors to Bevo VI
that have been kidnaped in the past have suf
fered indignities ranging from dehorning to
being the main course of a Texas A & M barbe
cue dinner.
However, both animals showed up at the
Texas-Baylor game the following Saturday.
The bear cub guzzled cokes while sitting on
the sidelines of the football field.
Bevo VI spent most of the time munching
grass at the end of the stadium. Only in the
last quarter when Baylor was threatening to
come from behind and win did the steer paw
the ground and lower his head menacingly
Texas won the game, 21-20.
In the meantime Texas A & M students are
preparing for their university's game with
Texas in a different fashion.
Three A & M students were apprehended
last Tuesday morning while attempting to put
potassium permanganate in the big Texas foun
tain. The addition of this chemical would have
turned the water to a dark purple color.
They were kept in the Austin jail until the
next morning and then released to university
officials who suspended them until the end of
the semester.
Meantime work has begun on the Texas
A & M bonfire, which students claim will be

the world's largest. The blaze is set off the
night before the Texas game and is similar in
tradition to the Stanford Big Game fire.

Effigy hanging of coaches seems to be the
popular thing down at the USC campus.
Trojan coach Jess Hill did Cal coach Pappy
Waldorf one better as he was hung twice fol
lowing SC's loss to Stanford.
Following the 28-30 loss to the Indians, a
dummy, supposedly Jess Hill, was found hang
ing from the SAE house Saturday night.
Members of the house have all denied they
took part in the lynching party.
The following Monday morning another
dummy was found in front of the P.E. Building.
This time there was no mistaking the identity.
It was dressed in blue suit, wore glasses, and
its facial characteristics were similar to Hill's.
The was "no comment" from university of
ficials. The alumni organization is rumored to
be guite disgruntled over the Trojans' three
losses this year.
Hill wasn't the only SC coach to be hung in
effigy last week. Jim Decker, former USC half
back, took over the coaching of eight girls
from North Side of Sorority Row in preparation
for their touch football game with South Side,
coached by ex-place-kicker Sam Tsagalakis.
His girls lost the game, 13-0. Consequently,
Decker was hanged in effigy for all to see on a
telephone wire at a street intersection.

They're seriousfy thinking about doing away
with the Cal men's rooting section over at
Berkeley. Final decision will be postponed
until the end of the season when the Cal Excom
can review the situation.
Rally committee representative Dick Howard
is reported disturbed over the great destruction
of stunt cards this seaspn. Fines have been
levied against the fraternities most prominent
in the destruction in order to pay for new cards.
Howard had earlier predicted thai some of
the virtual riots in the men's rooting section at
the beginning of the season would lead to a
mixed section by the middle of the 1956 season.
Now, he declares, "If we're going to have a
mixed section, it must be started with the first
game next year."
