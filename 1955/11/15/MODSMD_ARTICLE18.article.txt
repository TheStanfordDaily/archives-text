sarcasm, mr. editor
To the Editor:
The sarcasm emanating from the editor's approach
on describing Big Game activities in yesterday's Daily
is indicative of his failure to accurately present the
facts.
There are several organizations planning activities
in the Big Game tradition: Ram's Head is producing
the Gaieties. The junior class is presenting Friday
afternoon's "Bear Bust." The Rally Committee is pre
senting the Rally, on Thursday night. Cardinals is or
ganizing the bonfire, a rally in the city Friday night if
possible, a theme for the week and publicity.
Cardinals is working in conjunction with these
aforementioned organizations in campus publicity in
order to achieve mutual success. Your statement, Mr.
Editor, "'And Cardinals is implementing the whole
thing, more or less," is inaccurate and is an affront
to Ram's Head, the Rally Committee and the junior
class.
We're not asking you. Mr. Editor, to attend Gaieties,
the rally, the "Bear Bust" and then win the Big Game
for us on Saturday. In fact, you do not have to attend
anything. But for those students who desire to take
part in one or more of these activities, they will be
available. No one is compelled to attend anything as
you suggested in your statement ". . . make sure
people come so that the events will be successful."
Yes, the Library will be open until 11 tonight and
tomorrow. It will also be open until 10 p.m. on Thurs
day, Friday and Saturday nights. See you there, Mr.
Editor?
The Cardinals will not picket the Library, but mem
bers of the junior class will publicize their "Bear
Bust," on Friday noon in front of Engineering Corner
with picket-type signs.
Incidentally, Mr. Editor, the theme is not "Prepare
for the Bear," but "This Is the Year."
As well as being sarcastic and critical, Mr. Editor,
your responsibility should also be to give credit where
it's due and to present facts honestly and accurately.
I suggest that you read last Sunday's San Francisco

Chronicle and Examiner for a professonal and accom
plished approach to one of Stanford's great traditions.
Yes, the Cardinal is waving in a sincere effort to
make a great tradition meaningful to Stanford stu
dents, alumni and faculty.

hit and run
To the Editor:
On Friday evening foreign student Hans Morowitz
was the victim of a hit-and-run accident on Palm
Drive. Hans suffered a mild concussion and serious
lacerations and bruises on his face and body.
Even though Hans' condition is considered to be
"satisfactory" by the Palo Alto Hospital, it does not
excuse the person who committed the act from in
forming the police of the accident.
In light of the evidence which has been gathered,
it would be very wise for the driver of the oar to
turn himself in at once, since he will then have a
chance of receiving a lighter penalty. If there was
another person present in the automobile which
struck Hans, he, as an accessory, will be just as re
sponsible as the driver, unless he voluntarily tells
the policc all he knows about the accident.
The Stanford Police are fairly certain that the
felony was committed by a student. They have five
witnesses to the crime, have a description of the car,
know approximately how fast it was going and have
a sample of paint from the automobile.
Under the circumstances it is only a matter of time
before the police will apprehend the driver. If there
still be doubt in this person's mind that he will re
main undetected, let him be reminded that 95 per
cent of all hit-and-run cases have been solved.
