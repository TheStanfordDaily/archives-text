# 'Mister Roberts' Termed 'Incompatible, Confusing'
## 
### RICHARD MENDE 
When Thomas Heggen originally wrote "Mister Robsrts," it
seemed inevitable that his novel would be worked over in Broad
way and Hollywood because it was vital and stimulating, and as
American as "Oklahoma" or "South Pacific."

The film is now at the Cardinal
Theater.
Joshua Logan conspired with the
original author, and the New York
version, a .solid piece of craftsman
ship, emerged with vigor and good
humor.
But the merit of the movie version
is far more limited. It leaves one
much less satisfied, and for those not

exposed to the
earlier versions,
probably confused.
The confusion
comes from an in
compatible mix
ture of tones. WhatJ
has Lt. (JG) Rob-

erts, who becomes panicky as the
war's end nears because he is con
fined to the endless drudgery of
transporting cargo, got to do with
the rowdy boisterous scense that
take place around him?
What has the paranoid captain, the
one who had to ciean up the mess
when college boys were sick but who
now is in command and out to set a
record, to do with the farce of a
motorcycle flying off the pier, the
telescope scene in which the crew

can peer into the nurses' shower
room, or the suds filling the ship
after an accident in the laundry
room?
And how is the ineffectual Ensign
Pulver to be regarded, first seriously
and then comically in the home
made Scotch-brewing episode, when
he is scampering out of sight of the
captain?
But there is another basic weak
ness in the movie version of "Mister
Roberts." In using the stage-play
instead of the original novel for their
source, the script writers unduly
confined the camera, and frequently
substituted conversation for action.
A most obvious example was the
shore-leave scene where nearly ev
erybody talked about what happened
instead of moving inland where
things had actually taken place. *
The acting, however, was out
standing; Henry Fonda, playing with
quiet, sure command, and James
Cagney, the harsh, embittered, petty
captain. The crew seemed like a
bunch of hero - worshiping Boy
Scouts, but maybe that's the way
American servicemen are.

has Lt. (JG) Rob-

erts, who becomes panicky as the
war's end nears because he is con
fined to the endless drudgery of
transporting cargo, got to do with
the rowdy boisterous scense that
take place around him?
What has the paranoid captain, the
one who had to ciean up the mess
when college boys were sick but who
now is in command and out to set a
record, to do with the farce of a
motorcycle flying off the pier, the
telescope scene in which the crew

can peer into the nurses' shower
room, or the suds filling the ship
after an accident in the laundry
room?
And how is the ineffectual Ensign
Pulver to be regarded, first seriously
and then comically in the home
made Scotch-brewing episode, when
he is scampering out of sight of the
captain?
But there is another basic weak
ness in the movie version of "Mister
Roberts." In using the stage-play
instead of the original novel for their
source, the script writers unduly
confined the camera, and frequently
substituted conversation for action.
A most obvious example was the
shore-leave scene where nearly ev
erybody talked about what happened
instead of moving inland where
things had actually taken place. *
The acting, however, was out
standing; Henry Fonda, playing with
quiet, sure command, and James
Cagney, the harsh, embittered, petty
captain. The crew seemed like a
bunch of hero - worshiping Boy
Scouts, but maybe that's the way
American servicemen are.
