STANFORD 14. OREGON 7
Stanford put on its finest show of offensive power of the season against
the Ducks, 'lhe air arm, provided by quarterbacks John Brodie, Jerry Gus
tafson and Jack Douglas, accounted lor 197 yards while the Indian backs
lolled for 273 yards on the ground.
Oregon displayed much the some kind of offense as Ohio State showed
against Stanford early in the season. The Ducks, like the Buckeyes, de
pended on an explosive ground attack featured primarily by sweeps around
the ends.
Again like the Buckeyes, Oregon just did not have the passing guns to
keep the defense honest. Stanford coach Chuck Taylor had his charges
playing practically a nine-man line throughout the afternoon, and this
defense effectively throttled the Oregpn sweeps.
As the Oregon quarterbacks slid along the line, Stanford's ends dropped
rait to check the laterals and forced the quarterback to keep the hall and
cut back into the waiting Indian linebackers. Even when the swift Duck
backs did take a lateral, the floating end forced them way out to the side
lines before they could turn the corner.
John Brodie came up with his third fine game in succession. The Indian
sharpshooter fired true on his first passes and wound up with 12
completions in 18 attempts. Substitute quarterbacks Jerry Gustafson and
Jack Douglas did not slow down the pace, either, as each completed three
out of four.
The game was also marked by the solid play of Stanford halfback Gordy
Young. Young ran well and on several occasions shot up from his defensive
wingbock position to cut down the Oregon backs on their end sweeps.
If the now jelled Indian offense goes as smoothly next Saturday as it did
against Oregon, the Big* Game should be strictly no contest.
OREGON STATE lfi, CALIFORNIA 14
Cal almost pulled off an upset against the favored Beavers, but once again
the Northerners came through in the clutch—this time on a field goal by
Ted Searle.
Cal, like almost eveiy other team that has played Oregon State this year,
just couldn't figure how it lost. The Bears controlled the ball on 78 plays
compared to the Beavers' 39 and pretty well dominated the statistics, but.
like six other teams this year, they came out under Oregon State on the I
scoreboard.
The Beavers' oft'ense against Cal was typical of the Northerners" play all
year. The attack sputters along until there is suddenly an explosion, and
the Beavers have six on the scoreboard. The same is true on defense. The ,
Orangemen usually make their opponents bitterly regret offensive errors, j
Oregon State apparently runs through a series of plays just to set one
play up. Realizing their limited offensive weapons, the instead of ;
going for long marches, waste several downs or even several sets of downs
just to set the defense up for one particular play.
When the defense gets in the position that is to Oregon State's liking,
the Beavers pull off their sucker play, and, as has happened on a number
of occasions this year, the defense suddenly realizes that there is a Beaver
racing to the goal line with nobody to stop him.
Against Cal, Oregon State gained over half of its yards on just two
plays—a 71-yard touchdown run by fullback Tom Berry and a 53-yard pass !
play from Bay Westfall to Sam Wesley.
Cal got in scoring position time and time again, but, with the exception j
of their two scores, the Bears couldn't solve the OSC defense which gets i
tougher as it is backed up to its own goal line.
Next for the Beavers is Oregon. A victory over the Ducks would give )
the Oregon Staters their best.season since 1946.
UCLA 1!). WASHINGTON 17
The Huskies came within one long breath of pulling the upset of the
year. Only Jim Decker's 25-yard field goal in the last 18 seconds pre
vented it.
This is the second year in a row that Washington has given the Bruins
fits. Last year, Washington came from way behind to get within one point
of UCLA at 20 to 21 and was knocking at the door again as the gun sounded.
This year the Huskies at one point held a 17-14 lead but couldn't quite
hold it. Quarterback Steve Roake allowed himself to be tackled in the
end zone to rule out the possibility of a blocked punt, but, on the ensuing i
kickoff, the Bruins came storming back down the field in a desperation !
drive.
Washington halted the drive on its own 14. but Decker's toe made 59
minutes and 42 seconds of a fantastic Husky effox-t just another good try
instead .of a near unbelievable upset.
WASHINGTON STATE 13, SAN JOSE STATE 13
Washington State finally scored a touchdown at last Saturday
when they tied favored San Jose State in a game played with the field
covered with snow. Temperature ranged from zero to 5 above, and one
San Jose end had to be hospitalized with frozen fingers. Only one ticket
was sold at the gate, and attendance was a meager 1000.
Bob Iverson scored both Washington State touchdowns on runs of eight
and one yards. Mel Powell. San Jose end, scored both of the Spartan tallies.
Tony Teresa kicked the San Jose conversion, while Frank Sarno, who
kicked a field goal against Stanford in their 30-26 win last year, kicked
the tying point for the Cougars in the third period. '

OREGON STATE lfi, CALIFORNIA 14
Cal almost pulled off an upset against the favored Beavers, but once again
the Northerners came through in the clutch—this time on a field goal by
Ted Searle.
Cal, like almost eveiy other team that has played Oregon State this year,
just couldn't figure how it lost. The Bears controlled the ball on 78 plays
compared to the Beavers' 39 and pretty well dominated the statistics, but.
like six other teams this year, they came out under Oregon State on the I
scoreboard.
The Beavers' oft'ense against Cal was typical of the Northerners" play all
year. The attack sputters along until there is suddenly an explosion, and
the Beavers have six on the scoreboard. The same is true on defense. The ,
Orangemen usually make their opponents bitterly regret offensive errors, j
Oregon State apparently runs through a series of plays just to set one
play up. Realizing their limited offensive weapons, the instead of ;
going for long marches, waste several downs or even several sets of downs
just to set the defense up for one particular play.
When the defense gets in the position that is to Oregon State's liking,
the Beavers pull off their sucker play, and, as has happened on a number
of occasions this year, the defense suddenly realizes that there is a Beaver
racing to the goal line with nobody to stop him.
Against Cal, Oregon State gained over half of its yards on just two
plays—a 71-yard touchdown run by fullback Tom Berry and a 53-yard pass !
play from Bay Westfall to Sam Wesley.
Cal got in scoring position time and time again, but, with the exception j
of their two scores, the Bears couldn't solve the OSC defense which gets i
tougher as it is backed up to its own goal line.
Next for the Beavers is Oregon. A victory over the Ducks would give )
the Oregon Staters their best.season since 1946.
UCLA 1!). WASHINGTON 17
The Huskies came within one long breath of pulling the upset of the
year. Only Jim Decker's 25-yard field goal in the last 18 seconds pre
vented it.
This is the second year in a row that Washington has given the Bruins
fits. Last year, Washington came from way behind to get within one point
of UCLA at 20 to 21 and was knocking at the door again as the gun sounded.
This year the Huskies at one point held a 17-14 lead but couldn't quite
hold it. Quarterback Steve Roake allowed himself to be tackled in the
end zone to rule out the possibility of a blocked punt, but, on the ensuing i
kickoff, the Bruins came storming back down the field in a desperation !
drive.
Washington halted the drive on its own 14. but Decker's toe made 59
minutes and 42 seconds of a fantastic Husky effox-t just another good try
instead .of a near unbelievable upset.
WASHINGTON STATE 13, SAN JOSE STATE 13
Washington State finally scored a touchdown at last Saturday
when they tied favored San Jose State in a game played with the field
covered with snow. Temperature ranged from zero to 5 above, and one
San Jose end had to be hospitalized with frozen fingers. Only one ticket
was sold at the gate, and attendance was a meager 1000.
Bob Iverson scored both Washington State touchdowns on runs of eight
and one yards. Mel Powell. San Jose end, scored both of the Spartan tallies.
Tony Teresa kicked the San Jose conversion, while Frank Sarno, who
kicked a field goal against Stanford in their 30-26 win last year, kicked
the tying point for the Cougars in the third period. '
STANFORD 14. OREGON 7
Stanford put on its finest show of offensive power of the season against
the Ducks, 'lhe air arm, provided by quarterbacks John Brodie, Jerry Gus
tafson and Jack Douglas, accounted lor 197 yards while the Indian backs
lolled for 273 yards on the ground.
Oregon displayed much the some kind of offense as Ohio State showed
against Stanford early in the season. The Ducks, like the Buckeyes, de
pended on an explosive ground attack featured primarily by sweeps around
the ends.
Again like the Buckeyes, Oregon just did not have the passing guns to
keep the defense honest. Stanford coach Chuck Taylor had his charges
playing practically a nine-man line throughout the afternoon, and this
defense effectively throttled the Oregpn sweeps.
As the Oregon quarterbacks slid along the line, Stanford's ends dropped
rait to check the laterals and forced the quarterback to keep the hall and
cut back into the waiting Indian linebackers. Even when the swift Duck
backs did take a lateral, the floating end forced them way out to the side
lines before they could turn the corner.
John Brodie came up with his third fine game in succession. The Indian
sharpshooter fired true on his first passes and wound up with 12
completions in 18 attempts. Substitute quarterbacks Jerry Gustafson and
Jack Douglas did not slow down the pace, either, as each completed three
out of four.
The game was also marked by the solid play of Stanford halfback Gordy
Young. Young ran well and on several occasions shot up from his defensive

just to set the defense up for one particular play.
When the defense gets in the position that is to Oregon State's liking,
the Beavers pull off their sucker play, and, as has happened on a number
of occasions this year, the defense suddenly realizes that there is a Beaver
racing to the goal line with nobody to stop him.
Against Cal, Oregon State gained over half of its yards on just two
plays—a 71-yard touchdown run by fullback Tom Berry and a 53-yard pass !
play from Bay Westfall to Sam Wesley.
Cal got in scoring position time and time again, but, with the exception j
of their two scores, the Bears couldn't solve the OSC defense which gets i
tougher as it is backed up to its own goal line.
Next for the Beavers is Oregon. A victory over the Ducks would give )
the Oregon Staters their best.season since 1946.
UCLA 1!). WASHINGTON 17
The Huskies came within one long breath of pulling the upset of the
year. Only Jim Decker's 25-yard field goal in the last 18 seconds pre
vented it.
This is the second year in a row that Washington has given the Bruins
fits. Last year, Washington came from way behind to get within one point
of UCLA at 20 to 21 and was knocking at the door again as the gun sounded.
This year the Huskies at one point held a 17-14 lead but couldn't quite
hold it. Quarterback Steve Roake allowed himself to be tackled in the
end zone to rule out the possibility of a blocked punt, but, on the ensuing i
kickoff, the Bruins came storming back down the field in a desperation !
drive.
Washington halted the drive on its own 14. but Decker's toe made 59
minutes and 42 seconds of a fantastic Husky effox-t just another good try
instead .of a near unbelievable upset.
WASHINGTON STATE 13, SAN JOSE STATE 13
Washington State finally scored a touchdown at last Saturday
when they tied favored San Jose State in a game played with the field
covered with snow. Temperature ranged from zero to 5 above, and one
San Jose end had to be hospitalized with frozen fingers. Only one ticket
was sold at the gate, and attendance was a meager 1000.
Bob Iverson scored both Washington State touchdowns on runs of eight
and one yards. Mel Powell. San Jose end, scored both of the Spartan tallies.
Tony Teresa kicked the San Jose conversion, while Frank Sarno, who
kicked a field goal against Stanford in their 30-26 win last year, kicked
the tying point for the Cougars in the third period. '
STANFORD 14. OREGON 7
Stanford put on its finest show of offensive power of the season against
the Ducks, 'lhe air arm, provided by quarterbacks John Brodie, Jerry Gus
tafson and Jack Douglas, accounted lor 197 yards while the Indian backs
lolled for 273 yards on the ground.
Oregon displayed much the some kind of offense as Ohio State showed
against Stanford early in the season. The Ducks, like the Buckeyes, de
pended on an explosive ground attack featured primarily by sweeps around
the ends.
Again like the Buckeyes, Oregon just did not have the passing guns to
keep the defense honest. Stanford coach Chuck Taylor had his charges
playing practically a nine-man line throughout the afternoon, and this
defense effectively throttled the Oregpn sweeps.
As the Oregon quarterbacks slid along the line, Stanford's ends dropped
rait to check the laterals and forced the quarterback to keep the hall and
cut back into the waiting Indian linebackers. Even when the swift Duck
backs did take a lateral, the floating end forced them way out to the side
lines before they could turn the corner.
John Brodie came up with his third fine game in succession. The Indian
sharpshooter fired true on his first passes and wound up with 12
completions in 18 attempts. Substitute quarterbacks Jerry Gustafson and
Jack Douglas did not slow down the pace, either, as each completed three
out of four.
The game was also marked by the solid play of Stanford halfback Gordy
Young. Young ran well and on several occasions shot up from his defensive
wingbock position to cut down the Oregon backs on their end sweeps.
If the now jelled Indian offense goes as smoothly next Saturday as it did
against Oregon, the Big* Game should be strictly no contest.
OREGON STATE lfi, CALIFORNIA 14
Cal almost pulled off an upset against the favored Beavers, but once again
the Northerners came through in the clutch—this time on a field goal by
Ted Searle.
Cal, like almost eveiy other team that has played Oregon State this year,
just couldn't figure how it lost. The Bears controlled the ball on 78 plays
compared to the Beavers' 39 and pretty well dominated the statistics, but.
like six other teams this year, they came out under Oregon State on the I
scoreboard.
The Beavers' oft'ense against Cal was typical of the Northerners" play all
year. The attack sputters along until there is suddenly an explosion, and
the Beavers have six on the scoreboard. The same is true on defense. The ,
Orangemen usually make their opponents bitterly regret offensive errors, j
Oregon State apparently runs through a series of plays just to set one
play up. Realizing their limited offensive weapons, the instead of ;
going for long marches, waste several downs or even several sets of downs
just to set the defense up for one particular play.
