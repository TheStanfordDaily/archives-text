Stanford's All - Coast tackle,
Paul Wiggin provided the most
heartening news for Indian grid
supporters yesterday, as Chuck
Taylor and Pappy Waldorf
opened fire with verbal salvos
concerning the upcoming Big
Game.
Wiggin suffered a painful hip
pointer last Saturday and it was
feared that the big tackle might bo
lost for this weekend. But Wiggin
reported in today and seemed to be
on the mend. The hip still bothers
him somewhat, but he can jog and
crouch, and trainer Connie Jarvis
gave him the green light for prac
tice today.
Waldorf started his annual spiel
on "why California should be the
underdog for this Big Game" only
this year he seems to have a point.
Taylor was forced to admit that
the Stanfords have had a little more
success this season than the Bears,
but quickly pointed out that the

favorites role meant nothing come
gametime.
Stanford team spirit was already
running high, as the gridders had
an air of quiet confidence about
them after they came into the dress
ing room last Saturday. That same
attitude was evident yesterday as
the Cards went through a light de
fensive drill.
It was picture day earlier as the
Stanford players donned their Big
Game uniforms for the camera men.

Next Saturday the Indians will be
wearing their regular home uni
forms with one exception—their red
jerseys do not have the white arm
stripes.
After their workout, the football
ers repaired to the BAC where they ■
got the lowdown on the University j
of California gridders. Line coach '
Joe Ruetz, who annually has the job j
of scouting the Bears, gave out with
his 1955 version of the strengths, j
weaknesses, etc., of the individual
Blue and Golders, as well as a run
down of the types of plays that Cal
likes to run.
Over at Berkeley, Waldorf sent his j
Bears through the first day of work- j
outs in a hectic week in preparation
for the game. He was greeted by j
the healthiest Cal squad of the year,

and indications are that Cal would
meet Stanford with its team in the
best physical shape in quite some
time.
Quarterback Gus Gianulias and
half John Stewart will see some
duty on Saturday.
The only two doubtfuls were tack
les Bob Oliver and Don Tronstein
who still'need the doctor's ok. The
three Bears who/-sustained injuries
against OSC were all in sweatsuits
yesterday, but expected to be ready,
were Ron Wheatcroft, Ralph Hoff
man and Mike White.
