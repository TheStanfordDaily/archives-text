HANDLE RETURNSâ€”John Lauritzen, class of '29, looks at place
where the Stanford Axe blade will go on the wooden handle.
Lauritzen has kept the handle ever since it was mailed to Stan
ford a week after the Immortal 21 regained the Axe from Cal on
April 3, 1930. Painted on the handle are the words "Until We
Meet Again, J. A. R. ( '30." Written in ink near the top of the
handle is the inscription, "You might need this to swing the
Axe."
