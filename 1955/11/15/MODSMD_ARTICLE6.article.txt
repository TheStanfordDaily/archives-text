# Axe, Missing Handle Set To Reunite
## 
### 
The handle to the Stanford I
axe, missing from the blade for j
25 years, will make its first pub- j
lie appearance at the Bonfire
rally here Thursday night.
At this time John Lauritzen, who
J has kept the handle since the Im-
I mortal 21 successfully regained the
' Axe blade in 1930. will return it to
| the Stanford student body.
"I've been thinking about return- !
ing the blade handle for some time
now," Lauritzen explained.
"Since this is the 25th anniversary
of the regaining of the Axe and it's
just about time to get the blade back,
| I figured I would return the handle
and make the Axe complete."
IMMORTAL 21
Lauritzen, class of '29, explained
that when the Immortal 21 showed
up with the Axe on the night of
April 3, there was no handle. "About
eight of them were bearing the Axe
on a cable car wire," he recalled.
"I was senior sponsor at Encina
at the time. The 21 went parading
through Encina, bearing the Axe in j
triumph. The dormitory emptied |
completely, the freshmen following j
the 21 in a parade up the Row.
KEPT IN VAULT
"Finally after a big rally in front j
of Roble about 4 a.m., the 21 be
gan to see the advisability of giv- j
ing up the blade, so we put it in a |

< at
vault in the BAC building, and took
it to a vault in Fa]o r Alto the next
day."
About a week later, in the midst
of the controversy, a mysterious long
package arrived addressed to Stan
ford Steinbeck, then ASSU presi
dent.

WOODEN. HANDLE
The package contained a wooden
axe handle with the painted mes
sage, "Until We Meet Again. J. A. R."
(Cal student body president) '30. In
ink on the upper end was written
the additional notation, "You might
need this to swing the Axe."
A new handle had been made
every year, as a trophy to be given
to the Cal student who was the
year's guardian of the Axe," Lau
ritzen explained. "This handle had
been recently made to give to the
1930 guardian of the Axe.
"We were having enough trouble
deciding what to do with the Axe."
Plans ranged everywhere from de
stroying the biade completely to
melting it down into 21 miniature
blades for the Immortal 21 to wear.
"I figured that the handle would
just cau.-e additional controversy.
The inscription, "Until we meet
again," sounded particularly omi
nous. There had already been many
fights between the schools.
"Consequently, I took the handle ,
home with mo and I have kept it
ever since." '

' Axe blade in 1930. will return it to
| the Stanford student body.
"I've been thinking about return- !
ing the blade handle for some time
now," Lauritzen explained.
"Since this is the 25th anniversary
of the regaining of the Axe and it's
just about time to get the blade back,
| I figured I would return the handle
and make the Axe complete."
IMMORTAL 21
Lauritzen, class of '29, explained
that when the Immortal 21 showed
up with the Axe on the night of
April 3, there was no handle. "About
eight of them were bearing the Axe
on a cable car wire," he recalled.
"I was senior sponsor at Encina
at the time. The 21 went parading
through Encina, bearing the Axe in j
triumph. The dormitory emptied |
completely, the freshmen following j
the 21 in a parade up the Row.
KEPT IN VAULT
"Finally after a big rally in front j
of Roble about 4 a.m., the 21 be
gan to see the advisability of giv- j
ing up the blade, so we put it in a |

< at
vault in the BAC building, and took
it to a vault in Fa]o r Alto the next
day."
About a week later, in the midst
of the controversy, a mysterious long
package arrived addressed to Stan
ford Steinbeck, then ASSU presi
dent.

WOODEN. HANDLE
The package contained a wooden
axe handle with the painted mes
sage, "Until We Meet Again. J. A. R."
(Cal student body president) '30. In
ink on the upper end was written
the additional notation, "You might
need this to swing the Axe."
A new handle had been made
every year, as a trophy to be given
to the Cal student who was the
year's guardian of the Axe," Lau
ritzen explained. "This handle had
been recently made to give to the
1930 guardian of the Axe.
"We were having enough trouble
deciding what to do with the Axe."
Plans ranged everywhere from de
stroying the biade completely to
melting it down into 21 miniature
blades for the Immortal 21 to wear.
"I figured that the handle would
just cau.-e additional controversy.
The inscription, "Until we meet
again," sounded particularly omi
nous. There had already been many
fights between the schools.
"Consequently, I took the handle ,
home with mo and I have kept it
ever since." '
The handle to the Stanford I
axe, missing from the blade for j
25 years, will make its first pub- j
lie appearance at the Bonfire
rally here Thursday night.
At this time John Lauritzen, who
J has kept the handle since the Im-
I mortal 21 successfully regained the
' Axe blade in 1930. will return it to
| the Stanford student body.
