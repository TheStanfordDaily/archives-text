# Lights, Action ... Big Game Week Is Underway

### 

ALL WORK, NO GLORY — Backbone of any show, the crew
backstage, building a "locomotive" for the nursery school scene
in this year's Gaieties. The 1955 show is the 51st Big Game
production. Ram's Head has sponsored these annual shows
since 1904.


WHAT THE ROUGHS COME TO SEE—Perennial favorite in all
productions—the girls in the chorus, high-stepping in "Take
What You Can Get When You.Can Get It." Ram's Head shows
originally were "men only" affairs, but they soon learned what
packs 'em in.


A FINALE—The stage gets crowded during "Hide and* Seek,"
the first-act finale of this year's show. Ram's Head stages have
been crowded with many a bright light during its 61-year his
tory, including Lloyd Nolan of "Caine Mutiny" fame, and the
irrepressible Doodles V/eaver.
