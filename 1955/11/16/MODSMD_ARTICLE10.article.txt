# Bill of Rights 'No Guarantee' Of Freedoms
## Indian Lawyer Says 'Vigilance' Essential 
### STEW TOY 
The American Bill of Rights
cannot guarantee a "regime of
freedom," Indian constitutional
expert M. Ramaswamy told last
night's Tuesday Series audi
ence.
"It can only be a first barricade of
defense. The people must exercise
vigilante to insure their freedoms."
Ramaswamy, senior advocate of
the Indian Supreme Court and cur
rent Fulbright lecturer at Stanford's
Law School, specializes in the study
of constitutional civil liberties.
Much of his advice on civil liber
ties, based largely on the U. S. docu
ment, was incorporated into India's
! 1948 Constitution.
Ramaswamy related U. S. Consti
tution clauses and Supreme Court
decisions to those of India on four
subjects—the freedoms of speech, re
ligion and education and the fail
trial ("Due Process") clause of our
14th Amendment.
He called freedom of expression
"the very basis by which progress
in this world is made possible."
In India, as in the United States,
the individual's freedom of speech
is not absolute but must conform to
the maintenance of state security
and public order.
In d i a'& Constitution guarantees
freedom of education in the school
of one's choice.
Almost identical to its American
model, it prohibits discrimination
because of "caste, religion, color or
language." Thus there is no religious
instruction in India's government
supported schools.
India's "fair trial" law is also sim
ilar to our own. Its Constitution
prohibits ex post facto criminal laws
and "double jeopardy" in criminal
cases and guarantees the right to
counsel.
Ramaswamy hoped a world gov
ernment would arrive soon.
When it does, he had "no doubt
Lhat its leaders will draw heavily
from the great reservoir of freedom
in the American Constitution."
