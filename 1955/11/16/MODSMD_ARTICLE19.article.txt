# 'Argentine Strike Larks Real Power"
## 
### 
BUENOS AIRES-The three-day
old government of President Pedro
E. Aramburu arrested hundreds of
strike organizers today in meeting a
challenge to its authority from the
labor organization of ousted Presi
dent Juan D. Peron.
A nation-wide general strike call
ed by the General Labor Confedera
tion (CGT) failed to disrupt public
services or to halt government and
business activities.
But. it dealt a blow to Argentina's
sagging economy by halting a great
part ol industrial production in the
Buenos Aiies area.
