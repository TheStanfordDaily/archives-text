# Student Confesses In Campus Hit-Run Case
## Stanford Junior Tells of 'Panic'; Morowitz Recovering from Injuries 
### 
The "panicked" driver who struck down a Stanford foreign
student last Friday night has confessed, according to campus
police.
Robin Read, a Kappa Alpha junior, said yesterday it was he
who was driving the car responsible for the hit-and-run accident

on Palm Drive, the police say.
In the accident Hans Morowitz
was struck while pedaling his bicy
cle down the drive. He is a Stanford
student from Austria.
According to the police, Read said
yesterday that as he was coming
down Palm Drive about midnight
Friday he saw the cyclist, swerved
sharply, but didn't quite miss him.
He realized he'd hit Morowitz, "pan
icked" and drove off.
The victim was taken to the Palo
Alto Hospital that night "badly in
jured." reported to have possible leg
and skull fractures and severe face
lacerations.
Reports said Morowitz was return
ing from a Palo Alto movie—and did
not have a reflector or light on his
bicycle.
Following the accident police con
ducted an extensive search for the
car, which campus Police Chief Gor
don Davis said ''was still on cam
pus."
Police authorities say "charges are
pending"' against Read and that the
case will be resumed today. After
his confession he was released on his
own recognizance, officers said.
Morowitz was reported as "doing
all right" by the Palo Alto Hospital
last night. Hospital spokesmen said
he'd escaped broken bones and any
serious complications.
He is living at the Chi Psi house
this quarter.
