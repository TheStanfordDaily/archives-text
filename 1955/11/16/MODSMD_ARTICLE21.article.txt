first things first
To the Editor:
I commend Cardinals upon applying the principle
of "business before pleasure" to Big Game Week.
In this first attempt, the plan may not operate uni
formly throughout the University. Even so, I believe
that on the basis of this trial the idea will commend
itself both to students and to faculty for the future.
Not only does it place first things first, but it should
give our traditional Big Game festivities added mean
ii." and added enjoyment.

time to rebel
To* the Editor:
Having sat idly by for four years watching the
"expert" critic staff of The Daily criticize every at
tempt at good entertainment made by the movie in
dustry. I feel it is finally time to rebel. Perhaps Mr.
Mende i; not the type to be entertained. In fact some
of his critical observations make that possibility ex
tremely likely.
Confining the camera, as he defines it, in the shore
I:'.:-rty scene was one of the outstanding merits of
the movie. This was a ship's crew, that had had no,
liberty for over a year. I have no doubt that the
ilours spent reminiscing their activities for the next
year would hold more satisfaction than the activities
themselves.
If Mr. Mende feels deprived of activity, and also
c nlused by "Mr. Roberts," I would like to suggest a
nod Johnny Mack Brown double feature. This would
not overtax his unimaginative mind, probably ofi'er
no insurmountable confusion and certainly fulfill his
action requirements.
I am sure the majority of The Daily readers attend
movies to be entertained and not confused. I am
equally as .sure that a run down on films that fulfill
t i, requirement would be appreciated. If none of
I lie critics are able to be entertained. I would like to
iij t they save their money and ask the usherettes
.ho are undoubtedly better at ascertaining public
opinion. WAYNE RAWLS
boy scouts? riot us
To the Editor:
We read The Daily this morning and were partieu
'• n■ 1 v incensed at an article by Richard Mende re
icwing the movie version of "Mr. Roberts."
We thought it was a pretty good picture, but you
are certainly entitled to your own opinions in review
columns.
However, it seems unlikely that American service
men can be compared to "hero - worshipping Boy
Scouts'' without >ome sort of beef from the fans.
We all answered the clarion call to duty during

our country's time of need, and we're not Boy Scouts.
Ike's no Boy Scout!

(Editor's note: Daily Editorial Hoard also thought
"Mr. Roberts" was a pretty good picture, in fact,
an outstanding one. However, our reviewers are
entitled to their own opinions, and we instruct them
to report those opinions in their reviews.)
fainting fit?
To the Editor:
Now Mr. Cilley, did you really mean what you said
last Monday? Did you intentionally write that clever
little item about scholar Ramaswamy in your column
"This Week on Quad"? Or did you suffer a fainting
fit and spell out the dirty little bit without any reali
zation that you had done it? I certainly hope that
this latter was the case, for it it was not, then we
must classify you into that large group of childish
journalists which works for The Daily*
Eirst, we do not describe an internationally famous
lawyer and scholar of the United States Constitu
tional government as a (and I quote from your ar
ticle) "Indian legal hotshot." "Hotshot" is an insult
even to the poorest small-town lawyer, and to call a
person as brilliant and well-known in the legal world
as M. Ramaswamy a "legal hotshot" is going farther
in poor taste and crude manners than we expect even
from your column.
Secondly, we do not "pack them in" at the Law
School. Perhaps your classes are run on the order
of a 50-minute revue and girly show, but over at the
Law School, we put our academic activities on a
much higher level, and we respect the activities
themselves, even as we respect the learned instruc
tors and lecturers that organize them.
Finally, Mr. Cilley, I think you owe M. Ramaswamy
an apology. Obviously you have been very rude to
him personally. You should meet a person like Rama
swamy sometime and discover that there is more in
the world than just you and your nasty little column.
Perhaps some of this scholar's culture and good taste
will rub off on you. Until then, we will go on re
garding you as that little boy who writes that dis
gusting article for The Dailv.

constant jabber
To the Editor:
Jim Walters has provided able and conscientious
leadership all year in directing the student body's
cheering at the games. Saturday, however, his con
stant jabber during the game and during the half
time ceremony was most irritating. We can appreciate
the band's music only if we can hear it.
Walters will find no lack of spirit this week. I hope
that he and Rally Com channel this spirit so as not
to expend the patience and the energv of the rooting
section uselessly. FRANK MILSTEAD
