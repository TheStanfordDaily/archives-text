# Scottish Scholar Feels 'Right at Home' on Farm
## Emphasis on Activities Here Differs From Purely Academic Attitude in Scotland 
### GERRY SMITH 
There's nothing of the traditional dour and close-mouthed Scots
man in ASSU foreign scholar Bruce McConnach from Aberdeen,
Scotland.
He likes Stanford, as well as the rest of the United States, and
is eager to talk about it.
"I don't feel at all like a foreign scholar," the 23-year-old Scots
man commented. "I feel light at

home here."
He notices several differences be
tween the University of Aberdeen
and Stanford.
Something he finds particularly
unusual here is the concern about
too many student activities. At Ab
erdeen the faculty is worried about
the lack of student interest in any
thing but studying.
McConnach noted, while there are
many useless activities, the good
training of just working together is
a value often overlooked.
"The opportunity to learn to fit
into a community is one of the most
striking things about American uni
versities," something not readily
available on the non-resident cam
puses of Europe, he said.
STANFORD WOMEN
Recalling Norwegian foreign schol
ar Truls Treider's comment in last
Thursday's Daily that Stanford
women are more mature and in
telligent than Stanford men, Mc-
Connach had this to add:
"I wouldn't say I find them more
intelligent, but they are certainly
more interesting than Scottish wom
en. It's very refreshing to a Scots
man—women in Scotland have fur
boots, long wool coats and frozen
noses."
Another difference between Aber
deen and Stanford is the great num
ber of cars here, he said.
"They're more necessary here, of
course, but they certainly illustrate
the wealth of the United States."
"The tremendous choice of courses,
» specially survey courses," amazes
him. Also the proportion oi people
in the United States who have the
opportunity to go to college.
FACULTY
As far as the student-faculty re
lationship goes, McConnach feels it
is even more informal at Aberdeen
than it is here. "We often go out
with our professors to the local pub
after classes," he noted.
This tall young Scotsman has a
great liking for "good music of any
■?ort, but especially modern jazz." He
plays in Stanford's marching band
and is very interested in playing his
tenor saxophone with modern jazz
groups on campus.
McConnach. a graduate student in
history, plans to go into newspaper
work when he returns to Scotland.
He's liv ng at Toyon all year and is
a member of El Capitan this quarter.
He feels that the eating club sys
tem is a very good one, "an aspect
of American college life not well
enough known abroad."
The dark-haired Scotsman is very
enthusiastic about the foreign schol
arship program here. One of his
reasons is that it encourages foreign
students to meet Americans rather
than just other foreign students.
"The foreign scholarship program
is one of the best things Stanford has
to offer," he said.

McConnach. a graduate student in

He feels that the eating club sys

The dark-haired Scotsman is very
enthusiastic about the foreign schol

reasons is that it encourages foreign

BRUCE McCONNACH
There's nothing of the traditional dour and close-mouthed Scots
man in ASSU foreign scholar Bruce McConnach from Aberdeen,
Scotland.
He likes Stanford, as well as the rest of the United States, and
is eager to talk about it.
"I don't feel at all like a foreign scholar," the 23-year-old Scots
man commented. "I feel light at

home here."
He notices several differences be
tween the University of Aberdeen
and Stanford.
Something he finds particularly
unusual here is the concern about
too many student activities. At Ab
erdeen the faculty is worried about
the lack of student interest in any
thing but studying.
McConnach noted, while there are
many useless activities, the good
training of just working together is
a value often overlooked.
"The opportunity to learn to fit
into a community is one of the most
striking things about American uni
versities," something not readily
available on the non-resident cam
puses of Europe, he said.
STANFORD WOMEN
Recalling Norwegian foreign schol
ar Truls Treider's comment in last
Thursday's Daily that Stanford
women are more mature and in
telligent than Stanford men, Mc-
Connach had this to add:
"I wouldn't say I find them more
intelligent, but they are certainly
more interesting than Scottish wom
en. It's very refreshing to a Scots
man—women in Scotland have fur
boots, long wool coats and frozen
noses."
Another difference between Aber
deen and Stanford is the great num
ber of cars here, he said.
"They're more necessary here, of
course, but they certainly illustrate
the wealth of the United States."
"The tremendous choice of courses,
» specially survey courses," amazes
him. Also the proportion oi people
in the United States who have the
opportunity to go to college.
FACULTY
As far as the student-faculty re
lationship goes, McConnach feels it
is even more informal at Aberdeen
than it is here. "We often go out
with our professors to the local pub
after classes," he noted.
This tall young Scotsman has a
great liking for "good music of any
■?ort, but especially modern jazz." He
plays in Stanford's marching band
and is very interested in playing his
tenor saxophone with modern jazz
groups on campus.
