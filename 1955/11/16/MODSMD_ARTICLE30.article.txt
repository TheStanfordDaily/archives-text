ership but his claim to the rushing lead. Sam Brown, the UCLA tailback, rambled 140 yards on
the ground against Washington Sat-*

urday to pull ahead of the dangerous
SC back.

yards. Camera paces the conference
in having scored on five of these
receptions.

race for the Pacific Coast Conference total offense lead Saturday.
Brodie and his favorite receiver, end John Stewart, also retained their holds on the passing
and pass reception departments over the weekend.
Arnett, whose Trojan team was idle over the weekend, lost not only his total offense lead
ership but his claim to the rushing lead. Sam Brown, the UCLA tailback, rambled 140 yards on
the ground against Washington Sat-*

urday to pull ahead of the dangerous
SC back.

yards this season, all but 14 having
been gained through the air.
Brown has rushed 679 yards and
passed for another 132 to pull within
31 yards of the Tribe ace. Arnett,
with one more game remaining than
his two opponents, has been respon
sible for 722 yards running and
passing.
BRODIE TOP TOSSER
Brodie is far ahead of the pack
in passing with 62 completions for
828 yards. The junior sharp-shooter
from Oakland has completed 54 per
cent of his tosses, hitting paydirt
five times with his heaves.
Stanford's second quarterback,
Jerry Gustafson, ranks fifth in the

conference with 29 completions,
As Stewart rambled farther ahead
as the conference's top pass receiver,
teammate Paul Camera jumped into
the number two position. Stewart
has pulled down 24 heaves for 316
yards and a single touchdown.
Camera, who went by WSC's Ar
nie Pelluer and Cal's injured Roger
Ramseier with his effort against
Oregon, has caught 19 throws for 290
yards. Camera paces the conference
in having scored on five of these
receptions.
