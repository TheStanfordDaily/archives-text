# Len Casanova Ailing; Cal In Good Shape
## 
### 
Oregon football coach Len Casa
! nova, who was hanged in eftiÂ«y
, Monday, went to a Eugene hospital
yesterday with a possible case of
! acute appendicitis.
Assistant coach Jack Roche took
1 over the reins of the Webfoot eleven
in practice. The effigy hanging came
just two days after Stanford's 44-7
pasting of the Ducks.
Oregon captain Lon Stiner said
the team was wholeheartedly behind
Casanova and that members were
"mighty disgusted to hear about that
effigy business."
California went through another
rugged workout in preparation for
the Big Game in probably the best
physical shape of the season.
Only tackles Bob Oliver and Don
Tronstein are :#ill question marks
for the Indian encounter.
Cal's quarterback situation is due
to improve as sophomore Gus Gia
nulias and senior Ralph Hoffman,
who was outstanding against Wash
ington two weeks ago, will rejoin
Hugh Maguire.
Washington and Washington State
are being forced indoors this week
by snow as they prepare for the an
nual renewal of their rivalry.
Husky coach Johnny Cherberg
said he may work his team on the
frozen practice field today. "We may
have to play under rugged condi
tions on Saturday. Wo might as well
get u,;ed to them.''
