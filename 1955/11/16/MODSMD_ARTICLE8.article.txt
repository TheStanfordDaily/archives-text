# Menlo Park To Negotiate For Village Site
## 
### 
Trustees of the Menlo Park Ele
mentary School District took steps
Monday evening to investigate the
possibilities of a permanent school
site in the Stanford Village.
Business Manager John Richert
will confer with Stanford officials in
an attempt to reach agreement on a
piece of property.
At the meeting Richert outlined
several possible sites, all located on
the eastern edge of the Village, in
an area bounded by Third and Fifth
Streets. Most of the tentative sites
mentioned we from 7 to 8 acres in
size.
ine trustees were told during the
meeting by District Attorney Keith
Sorenson of San Mateo County that
if necessary, condemnation â€¢of the
lot on the basis of "public necessity"
could be legal cause for suit.
However, the hope that negotia
tion with the Univeristy would bring
agreement was expressed.
