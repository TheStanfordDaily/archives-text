# Gaieties Called 'Rewarding, Less Raucous'; Show Features 'Best Music Heard in Years'
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
Gaieties this year had a hair
cut, its face washed, and speaks
in a decidedly less raucous voice.
If there is, as a result, a lack
of some of the old brashness and
fireworks—and some people may
feel this lack—it is more than
compensated for by the best mu
sic heard here in many a year.
Conversely but not to be sneered
at, there is an absence of the
noisily and embarrassingly bad.
Whether Jim Anderson is writ
ing show tunes like "Gaieties,"
dance music like the hippity
hopping "Playground," or more
ambitious forms like the jazz
piano concerto for "Shadow
Dance," his stamp is on it: play
ful but sophisticated; witty with
out once falling into cuteness.
Jim Kason scores with two first
rate sentimental ballads, and John
Boswell has knocked out a rah

rah song to end rah-rah songs,
"When It's Big Game Time."
High points: the voices of Don
Grey, Stan Throneberry and Bere
Boynton, the comic presence of
Bill Burke (if only he could make
himself heard), the frenetic gai
ety of a quintet of beery old grads
—Gene Carlson, Ed Crane, Wally
Cummins, Steve Sandberg and
John Weber.
"Passion" a blues study in de
cadence, is a suggestive experi
ment, though a little tightening
and tensing would help a great
deal.
"Playground Ballet," though
one is afraid for a while it might
turn arty, goes on to become an
exciting and, especially in the
last section, unusually inventive
piece. It's danced by Bill Davis,
Glenn Dußose, Lou Ann Har
graves, Corinne Kason and Mary
Sherman.

There are only four sketches in
the show but at least one, "Little
Man You've Had a Busy Day," is
an inspired and, from the look of
it, largely spontaneously bit of
nonsense about progressive
schools. The cast can only be
termed all-star: Bere Boynton,
John Jordan, Gary Waynesmith,
Bill Scott and Sue Marrin.
Gene Carlson and Bill Burke in
"Etude on an Interlude" manage
to squeeze several laughs out of
what is essentially a dead-end
idea and the opener, "Mem Aud
Melee," although far too long, is
sporadically very amusing.
The occasional sparseness of
staging, a sort of visual thinness
—the static finale, for instance,
and the bare-staged opener of
the second act —is unfortunate,
but by and large Gaieties '55
points in the right direction and
is in itself a rewarding show.

piano concerto for "Shadow
Dance," his stamp is on it: play
ful but sophisticated; witty with
out once falling into cuteness.
Jim Kason scores with two first
rate sentimental ballads, and John
Boswell has knocked out a rah

rah song to end rah-rah songs,
"When It's Big Game Time."
High points: the voices of Don
Grey, Stan Throneberry and Bere
Boynton, the comic presence of
Bill Burke (if only he could make
himself heard), the frenetic gai
ety of a quintet of beery old grads
—Gene Carlson, Ed Crane, Wally
Cummins, Steve Sandberg and
John Weber.
"Passion" a blues study in de
cadence, is a suggestive experi
ment, though a little tightening
and tensing would help a great
deal.
"Playground Ballet," though
one is afraid for a while it might
turn arty, goes on to become an
exciting and, especially in the
last section, unusually inventive
piece. It's danced by Bill Davis,
Glenn Dußose, Lou Ann Har
graves, Corinne Kason and Mary
Sherman.

There are only four sketches in
the show but at least one, "Little
Man You've Had a Busy Day," is
an inspired and, from the look of
it, largely spontaneously bit of
nonsense about progressive
schools. The cast can only be
termed all-star: Bere Boynton,
John Jordan, Gary Waynesmith,
Bill Scott and Sue Marrin.
Gene Carlson and Bill Burke in
"Etude on an Interlude" manage
to squeeze several laughs out of
what is essentially a dead-end
idea and the opener, "Mem Aud
Melee," although far too long, is
sporadically very amusing.
The occasional sparseness of
staging, a sort of visual thinness
—the static finale, for instance,
and the bare-staged opener of
the second act —is unfortunate,
but by and large Gaieties '55
points in the right direction and
is in itself a rewarding show.
Gaieties this year had a hair
cut, its face washed, and speaks
in a decidedly less raucous voice.
If there is, as a result, a lack
of some of the old brashness and
fireworks—and some people may
feel this lack—it is more than
compensated for by the best mu
sic heard here in many a year.
Conversely but not to be sneered
at, there is an absence of the
noisily and embarrassingly bad.
Whether Jim Anderson is writ
ing show tunes like "Gaieties,"
dance music like the hippity
hopping "Playground," or more
ambitious forms like the jazz
piano concerto for "Shadow
Dance," his stamp is on it: play
ful but sophisticated; witty with
out once falling into cuteness.
