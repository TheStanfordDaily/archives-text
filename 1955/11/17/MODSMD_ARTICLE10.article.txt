# Big Game Traffic Jam Predicted
## Heavy Game Traffic To Jam Area Roads 
### 
Big Game prediction—lB,ooo
more cars on campus Saturday
than there were last weekend
for the Oregon game.
This was the estimate made
yesterday by Bob Young, man
ager of operations for the Ath
letic Department. Young is in
charge of parking and traffic prob
lems for the football games.
He expects that the heavy influx
of cars will jam all available Sta
dium parking and strain the ca
pacity of Peninsula roads in the
Palo Alto area.
State, county, city and University
traffic experts have been working
for weeks on a system to handle the
flow, both to and from the Stadium.
RAIN INCREASES PROBLEM
And if the rains continue, the
problem, particularly for parking,
will be even more critical. Young
said that a steady rain the rest of
the week could make many of the
parking areas useless quagmires. He
recalled the Army game in 1950;
cars were stuck in the mud for
weeks.
Probably the first lot that would
be "rained out" is the field behind
Branner Hall, Young said. This is
one of the areas which will be used
to park any cars driving from the
immediate campus area.
Young also said that the new
peripheral road — from the Encina
Gym, around Branner and Wilbur, to
the Theta Chi house—has been oiled
and will be used for Big Game traf
fic.
In addition, Los Arboles Road will
be opened to permit to leave
campus on the road past Lagunita.
EXTRA OFFICERS
Off-campus state, county and local
highway authorities will have extra
men on duty, will station officers at
most important intersections and
will run most stop lights manually.
Captain Eddie Tressler, long-time
traffic expert for the California
Highway Patrol, said that cars on El
Camino to the south will pose the
most serious accident hazard in the
area because of all the left turns
into the eateries.
Southern Pacific will ' transport
much of the throng on its Peninsula
trdins. Five trains of 18 cars each
will carry 7000 fans after the game.
Young said that if it continues to
rain, the Athletic Department will
use available radio and television
outlets to urge greater use of trains
and busses, and less driving.

dium parking and strain the ca
pacity of Peninsula roads in the
Palo Alto area.
State, county, city and University
traffic experts have been working
for weeks on a system to handle the
flow, both to and from the Stadium.
RAIN INCREASES PROBLEM
And if the rains continue, the
problem, particularly for parking,
will be even more critical. Young
said that a steady rain the rest of
the week could make many of the
parking areas useless quagmires. He
recalled the Army game in 1950;
cars were stuck in the mud for
weeks.
Probably the first lot that would
be "rained out" is the field behind
Branner Hall, Young said. This is
one of the areas which will be used
to park any cars driving from the
immediate campus area.
Young also said that the new
peripheral road — from the Encina
Gym, around Branner and Wilbur, to
the Theta Chi house—has been oiled
and will be used for Big Game traf
fic.
In addition, Los Arboles Road will
be opened to permit to leave
campus on the road past Lagunita.
EXTRA OFFICERS
Off-campus state, county and local
highway authorities will have extra
men on duty, will station officers at
most important intersections and
will run most stop lights manually.
Captain Eddie Tressler, long-time
traffic expert for the California
Highway Patrol, said that cars on El
Camino to the south will pose the
most serious accident hazard in the
area because of all the left turns
into the eateries.
Southern Pacific will ' transport
much of the throng on its Peninsula
trdins. Five trains of 18 cars each
will carry 7000 fans after the game.
Young said that if it continues to
rain, the Athletic Department will
use available radio and television
outlets to urge greater use of trains
and busses, and less driving.
