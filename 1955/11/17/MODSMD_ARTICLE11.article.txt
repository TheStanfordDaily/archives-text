# Big Game Campus Traffic Advice Given Motorists
## 
### 
Foreseeing a large influx of traffic
for the Big Game, Bob Young, Ath
letic Department operations manag
er, gave the following advice to mo
torists:
—Driving to the game from cam
pus will probably be more difficult
than walking, Young said. Cars ap
proaching directly from campus will
not be permitted closer to the Sta
dium than Encina.
—If you do drive from campus,
Young said, the best way is Stanford
Avenue to Escondido, Escondido to
the peripheral road, the peripheral
road to the ROTC Park area. But
that route will be used by all traffic
from the south and most late traffic
when the lots near El Camino are
full.
—Palm Drive will be closed at
noon. To go to Palo Alto after that
time, Young advises California Street
in South Palo Alto or Menlo Park.
—Palm Drive traffic headed for
Palo Alto will be routed out Willow
Road, past the shopping center to
the intersection of Sand Hill Road
and Junipero Serra in Menlo Park.
This applies both before and after
the game.
—All traffic from the parking areas
after the game will be sent out the
way it came in.
—Galvez Street in front of the
BAC will be closed to all traffic after
the game. The road will be reserved
for pedestrians.
—To ho south towards Santa Cruz
from campus after the game, Young
recommends going the back way
through Los Altos. He thinks that
will be the least used of all exits.
To go to San Francisco after the
game, Young suggests heading to
wards Palo Alto on Palm Drive. You
will be sent out Willow Road to
Sand Hill Road, avoiding expected
bottlenecks near the Deke house and
at the turn - off to Alpine Road.
Young advises taking Skyline be
cause Bayshore and El Camino will
be jammed.
To cross El Camino in the local
area. Young says use the Palm
Di'i v e - Willow Road exit or go
thioui'h South Palo Alto.'
