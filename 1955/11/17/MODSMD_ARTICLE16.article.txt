# ABC Will Curtail Roadside Parties
## 
### 
"Celebrations" at roadside bars by
motorists coming from the Big Game
will be curtailed this year, according
!.o Frank Fullenwider, area adminis
trator for the Alcoholic Beverage
Control Department.
Sixty special ABC agents will be
stationed throughout the local tav
erns. The agents will police the bars
and make certain that bartenders do
not serve drinks to rooters who have
had too much already, Fullenwider
said.
The emphasis will be on motorists,
because of the obvious dangers of
mixing driving with drinking, said
Fullenwider. "If motorists are drink
ing, we want to prevent them from
driving."
The patrols will concentrate on
Bavshore and El Camino taverns,
both north and south of campus.
