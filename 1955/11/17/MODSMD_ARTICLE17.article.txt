# 'Bear Bust' Scheduled For Barn, Then SF
## All Campus Reunion To Held Friday 
### 
Celebrate the"day before."
That will be the byword for
tomorrow as Big Game Week
builds to its Saturday climax.
Tonight will be the annual Big
Game rally and bonfire at Lake
Lagunita. Tomorrow Stanford
students may "prepare for the Bear,"
not at the Library, but at the all -
campus reunion the junior class is
sponsoring at Mangini's Barn and in
the City.
From 3 until 6 p.m. tomorrow,
there will be an all-campus rally
reunion.
Wally Rose and his "Dixieland"
band wili provide the entertainment
at the first annual "Bear Bust." Rose
is currently appearing at the Tin
Angel in San Francisco and he was
previously associated with the bands
of Lou Waters, Bob Scobey and Turk
Murphy.
"BEAR BUST"
Admission to the "Bear Bust" will
be 50 cents. Juniors carrying class
cards will be admitted for 25 cents.
The rally is the first to be held
here since Cardinals discontinued
the policy of having "Olympic Day"
on the Friday before Big Game.
Cardinals mentioned that the "Bear
Bust" may become an annual affair.
Students may continue their cele-

brations on into the evening, how- j
ever.
The City—San Francisco—will be j
the site.
Cardinals has arranged with
Southern Pacific to have extra cars
added to the regular commuters' I
trains and they suggest that all stu- i
dents planning to celebrate in the
City meet at the corner of Post and J
Powell.
There are rumors afoot that Stan
ford celebrants will be assigned a
"special police escort" for the eve
ning and Cardinals requested that all
students planning to join in the
"event'' wear rooters' caps to per
mit easy identification."
