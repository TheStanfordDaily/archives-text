# ...for coach chuck

### 
Tonight Chuck Taylor will address the as
sembled ralliers in front of the Boathouse. At
the four previous Big Game rallies, Chuck has
been confident not that Stanford would win,
but that Stanford would play the game to the
hilt.
He will ba confident again tonight, quietly,
forcefully, with unaffected sincerity. And the
Indian footballers will respond to that confi
dence in the Stadium against Cal Saturday.
Win or lose, the Indians will play football for
Coach Chuck.
Win or lose, this is a mark of a great coach.
Greatness in the coaching profession, despite
the prevalent myth, is measured by more than
a won-lost tally in the record book.
Chuck Taylor unquestionably wins his share,
too Considering the football talent available
to him, he wins many more than his share. He
wins because he teaches "winning" football,
he thinks "winning" football.
He always has faith in Stanford's ability to
win, no matter the odds. He conveys that faith
to his players. He builds his players psycho
logically to tremendous heights, just as he
molds raw, unschooled players into better ath
letes than even the most optimistic could have
hoped for.
Tactically, Taylor is just as successful. From
year to year, he changes his "system" to fit his
personnel. From game to game, he gambles,
he compensates, he over-shifts, he concen
trates his punch as he adjusts to the strengths

and weaknesses of each foe.
Ohio State will attest to his ability.
For the fans, Taylor provides the most inter
esting, colorful offense this side of professional
ranks. His basic weapon, the forward pass, is
modeled on pro standards. He develops out
standing passers; he utilizes beautiful pass pat
terns.
His teams never quit. The last Big Game, the
last three UCLA games are evidence. Perhaps
the 72-0 disaster in Los Angeles last year is the
be3t example of all.
Everything was going wrong, but Stanford
kept coming back for more. Stanford refused
to play conservative fcolball when conserva
tive football would have helped hold the score
down.
But through it all, win or lose, Chuck Taylor
is always a gentleman. He never despairs in
defeat; he never gloats in victory.
He always has kind words for opponents.
When Stanford is winning easily, he tries to
hold the score down; then he graciously denies
such an attempt.
He doesn't complain about dirty football or
poor officiating, even when it is justified, even
when he is prompted. He maintains his sanity
and his principles despite the pressure to win
and the pressure to proselyte.
Chuck Taylor has won championships and
honors. He has attained greatness as a coach.
But he's nevei' coached a Big Game winner. He
deserves to win one Saturday.
