# East Part of Peripheral Road Completed; Open for Traffic
## 
### 
The new peripheral road east of campus is now open lor traffic.
Final blacktopping at the corner of Arguello Street and Alva
lado Row was completed yesterday. Minor work, such as filling
in the shoulders, remains to be done in some sections of the road.
The completion of the road in time for Big Game is expected

to lighten the traffic congestion. Par
tial use of the road for Oregon game
traffic last Saturday, officials report,
was valuable in improving the traf
fic flow.
Work on the peripheral road be
gan early this fall, and the final con
struction will be completed next
week, weather permitting.
The road runs from the corner of
Pine Avenue and Arguello Street, at
the Men's Gym. and around behind
the Eating Clubs, Branner, Toyon
and Wilbur to the corner of Alva
rado and Arguello at the Theta Chi
house.
The route of Arguello Street op
posite the Theta Chi house was
moved slightly west.
The area left by the moving of
the road will be filled in by the Uni
versity and added to the Theta Chi
lot. 'This addition will increase the
front yard of the fraternity by ap
proximately 125 square feet.
Also recently completed were the
improvements on Escondido Road
between Wilbur and Branner. The
road was widened and re-surfaced,
with curbings and storm drains add
ed. The peripheral road intersects
with Escondido east of Wilbur.

With the east section of the pe
ripheral road completed, drivers
coming down E.scondido from Stan
ford Avenue (College Terrace) can
enter the central campus area at
three points: at the Theta Chi cor
ner, providing access to the residen
tial area; at the Men's Gym corner,
providing access to Embarcadero and
Palm Drive; and at the corner of
Escondido and Arguello. providing
access to many dormitories and the
library area.
Under construction is Arguello
Street, which is being changed to a
pedestrian area between Encina and
Toyon and Stern and Wilbur.
Future construction on the periph
eral road will take it through the
present site of Russell house, in front
of the new wo m en's dormitory,
Moore Hall, through the site of the
boathouse, along the edge of Lake
Lagunita behind Roble and around
west of campus.
The construction as far as the
boathouse is planned for completion
this summer, so the road will be
open when Moore Hall is completed
next fall. This, therefore, is the last
year for Russell House.
