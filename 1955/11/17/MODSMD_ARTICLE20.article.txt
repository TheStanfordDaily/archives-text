What do you think about the recent Legis
lature proposal to raise the price of the Sun
day Evening Movies (flicks) from 20 to 25
cents in order to purchase CinemaScope equip
ment?
At their meeting on Nov. 9, the Legislature
authorized the financial sub-committee to in
vestigate the advisability of buying Cinema-
Scope projecting equipment.
According to the proposal there is a scarcity
of outstanding current pictures for the con
ventional type screen. Sunday-flick selections
have had to be made from films released one
to two ago.
More outstanding features could be shown,
it was suggested, if the CinemaScope equip
ment would be installed.
The Daily interviewed 12 students around
Quad in an effort to get their reaction to the
Legislature proposal.
Most of those interviewed said that they
would not mind a 25-cent price increase for
the Sunday flicks, since the price still would
be far below normal prices.
Some criticized the proposed price increase.
They feel that the CinemaScope flicks would
not be of good quality or that the 20-cent flick
is a tradition.
Comments are:
/o Davis, '56, Roble sponsor: "I think a Cin
emaScope screen would be a good idea since
it would increase the number of good movies
we could have. I think 25 cents is very rea
sonable for the caliber of flicks we have had
in the past."
Judy Thomas, '59, Branner: "If they could
obtain better films to be shown, such as the
foreign films shown in previous years, I think
that it would be belter to keep the present
screen. However, I would attend the 25-cent
flick if the new screen was installed."
Al Gulick, '56, Wilbur sponsor: "The Sun
day night flicks for 20 cents is a tradition on
the Stanford campus. I say let Hollywood keep
CinemaScope and give us the 20-cent flicks."

Doris Viola, '59, Branner: "If there is not a
more worthy project before the Legislature,
I think the CinemaScope screen would be very
nice. However, we can have just as much fun
ringing bells in a 'regular' flick as in a Cinema-
Scope one."
lean McCarter, '57, Roble sponsor: "Since
CinemaScope is here to stay, Stanford should
not be restricted to plain old regular movies
due to lack of proper CinemaScope facilities."
Alan Wayte, '58, Delta Chi: "I would attend
the flicks if the price were raised to 25 cents,
but I think a CinemaScope screen would be
an unnecessary addition."
Shingle Kolord, '59, Wilbur: "I definitely
would be ah advocate of raising the price to
25 cents because if we had CinemaScope we
would get better movies. A quarter is not much
to pay for such a movie that could not be any
older than a couple of years."
Donna Keyse, '56, Union: "I don't think
you're sure of getting any better movies by
having Cinema Scope. They would probably
be those Cecil B. DeMille spectaculars that are
produced for quantity, not quality. Anyway,
one can always see a CinemaScope movie
downtown. At the flicks, I'd rather see an old
time movie."
Edward Arlucie, '56, Theta Xi: "Keep the
price at 20 cents. We don't need Cinema-
Scope."
Tom Bewley, '59, Wilbur: "There's no point
in charging an extra nickel if they continue
to show old movies on the CinemaScope
screen. But if they show good CinemaScope
movies, I'm willing to pay 25 cents."
Doug Scribner, '59, Wilbur: #"I think that
the idea of installing a CinemaScope screen
in the flicks is really fabulous. A screen like
this would allow us to enjoy some great shows
that we can't see now."
Evelyn Griswold, '58, Guthrie: "Since most
new pictures are CinemaScope, I think it would
be a good idea. Twenty-five cents is still a lot
less than a regular admission."

What do you think about the recent Legis
lature proposal to raise the price of the Sun
day Evening Movies (flicks) from 20 to 25
cents in order to purchase CinemaScope equip
ment?
At their meeting on Nov. 9, the Legislature
authorized the financial sub-committee to in
vestigate the advisability of buying Cinema-
Scope projecting equipment.
According to the proposal there is a scarcity
of outstanding current pictures for the con
ventional type screen. Sunday-flick selections
have had to be made from films released one
to two ago.
More outstanding features could be shown,
it was suggested, if the CinemaScope equip
ment would be installed.
The Daily interviewed 12 students around
Quad in an effort to get their reaction to the
Legislature proposal.
Most of those interviewed said that they
would not mind a 25-cent price increase for
the Sunday flicks, since the price still would
be far below normal prices.
Some criticized the proposed price increase.
They feel that the CinemaScope flicks would
not be of good quality or that the 20-cent flick
is a tradition.

Judy Thomas, '59, Branner: "If they could

foreign films shown in previous years, I think
that it would be belter to keep the present

you're sure of getting any better movies by
having Cinema Scope. They would probably
be those Cecil B. DeMille spectaculars that are
