haphazard mixture
To the Editor:
I must disagree with Mr. Rawls' attack on both
Mr. Mende as a critic and on Mr. Mende's review of
"Mr. Roberts." I fesl tiiat Mr. Mende's reviews have
been honest and unaffected evaluations ol' the films
; nd stage-plays he has i,een, made on the basis of
their dramatic .soundness as well as "entertainment
v.ilue." In this 1 if^ht, I believe he has given valid
objection to "Mr. Roberts."
Mr. Rawls has obviously missed the major criticism

in the review, which was that the film was dramati
cally incongruous; serious and farcical 'elements were
haphazardly mixed. Those who have read the original
novel and have seen the play will realize that they
dealt with serious men facing real problems; in these
the story was told with good humor without stum
bling into sentimentality.
"Mister Roberts" was, of course, entertaining; had
the slapstick—which so thoroughly entertained Mr.
Rawls—been omitted the substantial merit of the
story would not have been obscured.
