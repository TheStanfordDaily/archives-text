### LOGAN PAZDRAL 
Sam McDonald thinks the
Cards will win it this year. In
fact, he's almost positive. And
Sum will be behind the team all
Ihe way, just as he's been be
hind them for innumerable sea
sons past.
But there's a difference this year.
Since the time when the Big Game
and Sam McDonald were just begin
ning to become traditions on the
Farm, Sam has been out to back the
team with rabbit's feet, moral sup
port and vocal cords.
He rooted for the Rose Bowl Teams
of '28 and '29, the Vow Boys, the
Wow Boys and all the other boys
on Stanford elevens since then.
But this year Sam can't make the
game. He's in the Palo Alto Hospi
tal. recovering from a .leg amputa
tion and general debility. Besides
the gangrenous ulcer which made
necessary his amputation, it was dis
covered that Sam was suffering from
diabetes and a heart condition.
Even though he won't be able to
leave the hospital, Sam will have a
chance to follow the game. Friends
have .arranged to have a TV set in
stalled in his room Saturday in
hopes that the game will be tele
vised.
In case the Big Game isn't tele
vised, his nurses said, Sam will

probably spend the afternoon with |
a radio beside his bed.
Stanford Athletic Director A 1 Mas
ters explained that the game may
not be televised, since according to
conference rules there can be no TV
coverage unless all seats are sold
out. He said there are about 1100
tickets still unsold.
Sam, who operates like a sort of
Uncle Remus - Thurston \he Great
combination, has always backed his
conviction in the Big Red Machine
with a little prayer and good old
conjuration a la rabbit's foot.
