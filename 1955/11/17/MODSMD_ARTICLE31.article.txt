Chuck Taylor, Stanford's optomistic j
mentor, stuck by his statement of j
Monday, insisting that "weather I
won't make any difference in the
Big Game."
Due to the constant drizzle and
the increasingly muddy condition of
the pratcice field, the Cards only
ran through the light dummy scrim
mage then went in •early.
Rugged Indian tackle Paul Wiggin
worked out a little in sweat clothes
then retired to the dry confines of
the training quarters. Wiggin suf
fered a hip pointer in last Saturday'?
Oregon gams. The injury seems to
be responding to treatment, accord
ing to Trainer Connie Jarvis, but
whether Wiggin will be ready to go
against Cal is unknown.
If Wiggin can play it is doubtful
that he will be near top efficiency.
This may have some bearing on the
outcome of the game as the big
tackle has been one of the stalwarts
of the Indian forward wall all sea
son.
Taylor still refuses to pick a win
ner in the impending tilt, saying the
game should be rated "even-up."
Deadline for "Once Around the
