# Campbell Jet Boat Sets New Record
## 
### 
BOULDER CITY, Nov. (U P)-Brit
ish speedboat c h amp i on Donald
Campbell, ever seeking to increase
the world's limits of speed like his
father before him, yesterday sent his
jet-propelled Bluebird II roaring at
a "fantastic" 210.2 miles an hour for
a new world's record.
Cracking the "water barrier" of
200 miles an hour for the second
time in less than six months, Camp
bell reached the fabulous speed of
239.5 miles an hour on his first run
but was slowed to 193.1 miles on the
return run as the waters of Lake
Mead behind Hoover Dam became
choppy.
