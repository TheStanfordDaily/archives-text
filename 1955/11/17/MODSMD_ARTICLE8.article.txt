Masters said, "I want to point out
that it has never been the responsi
bility of the Athletic Department to
pay the expenses of Prince Light
foot or the head yell leader to foot
ball games away from the campus.
"This has always been an activity
of the Associated Students because
they are appointed and controlled
by them."
The Legislature approved the new
members of the advisory committee
on judicial status. They are Charles
GofT, chairman, Richard Andrews,
Alan English, Laura Klauber, Louise
Larson, Paul Jewett, Curtis Reth
