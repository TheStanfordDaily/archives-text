# Farm Students Lose Estimated $4100 To Syndicate in National Football Pool
## 
### 
An unknown number of Stanford
students were bilked of an estimated
$4100 in winnings when the opera
tors of a national football pool
welched on the bettors.
The syndicated gambling device,
known as "parlay cards" or "point
spread pools" quoted Stanford as a
six-point favorite over Oregon.
Stanford won by a whopping 44-7,
more than enough to meet the six
points demanded for a winner on the
parlay card.
At least one Stanford student was
a big loser. He was the campus rep
resentative of the gambling syndi
cate that distributes the football pool
cards throughout the country.

He paid $800 to winners out of his
own pocket, according to a Univer
sity spokesman.
The football pool is a gambling
device that depends on mass distri
bution for its success. It is played
with a weekly card listing the top
20 games in the country and giving
a point spread (Stanford over Ore
gon by six points) for each game.
A bettor may place anywhere from
25 cents to a number of dollars. The
payoff is based on the number of
games correctly picked with the odds
ranging from 6-5 for one game to
150-1 for picking ten games.
A San Francisco newspaper re
ported yesterday that $4100 had been
lost by Stanford Students by whole
sale welching by the syndicate (be
lieved to be of the Minnesota-Min
neapolis-Louisville hook-up).
The University spokesman said
"we don't believe the losses are as
high as reported" but ''we are going
to investigate these reports and in
vestigate disciplinary action against
the student."
The Stanford student representa
tive visited William G. Craig (dean
of men) in his office three days ago
and told him of the welching and of

his part in the syndicates venture
into the campus.
The student was contacted by two
members of the syndicate and sold
the poo! cards for a total of $800. The
campus representative told Craig
that "these cards paid off to the tune
of $3300" but the syndicate men
failed to show up for the payoff.
Craig is not sure whether the $800
out of the student's pocket went to
pay back the original investment of
the bettors. Further, the dean is
"not prepared to say" what action
taken or by whom it will be
taken.
A Stanford spokesman said yes
terday that he felt that the student
"has already been penalized consid
erably financially."
The cards had first appeared on
the campus prior to the game with
USC when the Indians were quoted
as 20-point underdogs, according to
Dean H. Donald Winbig-ler. Stanford
students had made a minor killing
on that one and were ready to push
their luck on the Oregon game in
which Stanford appeared to be a
definite overlay.
