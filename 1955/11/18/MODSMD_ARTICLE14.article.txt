# No Parking Space, Students Warned
## 
### 
Bob Young, Athletic Department
operations manager, warns Stan
ford students that driving to the
Big Game tomorrow from campus
"will probably be more difficult
than parking."
Young said that cars approach
ing the Stadium directly from
campus will not be permitted any
closer than Encina.
He noted that Palm Drive will
be closed at noon and that the
"best routes into Palo Alto" will
probably be California Avenue in
South Palo Alto or Santa Cruz
Avenue in Menlo Park.
