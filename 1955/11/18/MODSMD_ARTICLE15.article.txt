## 
### 
Back in April 1930 a Stanford
Daily reporter sat down at his type
writer and began a story, "The Stan
ford Axe is Stanford's own once
more."
The writer was Dick Friendlich,
who later became Daily Editor and
still later a noted columnist-reporter
lor The San Francisco Chronicle.
Friendlich remembers the Immor
tal 21 Axe recovery well:
. . There had been several un
successful attempts to regain it.
"As a matter of fact, I think most
of the campus expected some wild
eyed Stanfords to try again that
year, but none'thought it had any
chance of succeeding. . . .
"In retrospect, it was so compli
cated in conception and so simple of
execution that it may stand as a
model of Commando tactics. The au
dacity of riding on the armored car
as part of the honor guard still awes
me.
"But as one of the 21 said: 'It was
easy—we just wore blue jeans and
a stupid look, and no one could tell
us from any other Cal frosh.'"
