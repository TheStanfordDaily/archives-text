# The 						Stanford Axe and the Immortal 21
## For 56 Years it's Meant Big Game Axe Has Had Violent History As Stanford-California Prize Has Symbolized 'College Days' Since 1899 When First Axe Theft Led to Cal Possession 
### DICK MEISTER Associate Editor, The Daily 
It's not much of a trophy, just an axe. And it's not in very good
condition, hasn't even got a handle.
But this trophy, this axe, has lain among the jeweled contents
of bank vaults, has had its praises sung in the far corners of the
world, has even caused bitter blood to be shed.

Above all this trophy, the Stanford"
Axe, has symbolized more than any
thing else that time in life which
none can forget—"the good old col
lege days." For more than 50 years
the Axe has meant college to tens of
thousands of graduates from two of
the world's most famous schools,
Stanford University and the Univer
sity of California.
It has q brilliant and spirit-ridden
past, has this Axe.
It all began with a Stanford yell,
"Give 'em the Axe," which Univer
sity roughs began shouting at their
foes way back when, in 1896. not
long after Senator Leland Stanford
had established his University.
In 1899 some bright young student
came up with the idea of backing up
the yell with a real axe. So, in that
year before an all important Cal-
Stanford baseball game, the first
Stanford Axe Rally was held.
The big (10 pounds) lumberman's
axe was sharpened on a grindstone
at the rally, then tested on an effigy
of a Cal man. When "Play ball"
sounded the next day in San Fran
cisco the Indian yell leader (Billy
Erb) proudly waved the new Stan
ford Symbol in the faccs of Cal men.
THE AXL DOOMED
Mr. Erb shouldn't have been so
arrogant. He seemed so proud of
that Axe that the Cal boys got ideas
—"Let's steal that Axe," quoth one
of the Bear supporters and with that
simple sentence doomed Stanford's
Axe to 30 years of imprisonment far
from home—in Berkeley, Calif.
After the game (which Stanford
lost) four Cal men jumped the un
suspecting Stanford Axe guardians.
And so was spilled the first blood in
the Axe's history. Fists flew while
police stood by saying, "Let 'em
fight, they're just college boys, let
'em fight."
Into the middle of the riot came
one Billy Dunn, the top collegiate
dash man on the Coast—and a Cal
man at that. They shoved the Axe
at him screaming, "Run, Bill, run."
And run Bill did, with a howling
mob of Stanford roughs on his tail.
In a moment of confusion Dunn
handed the Axe over to who he
thought were Cal men—they weren't.
GONE AGAIN
But a beautiful flying tackle once
again wrested the Axe from Stanford
hands. These capturers hastily
boarded a passing delivery wagon,
going toward the ocean by a zig-zag
route. They went into a butcher
shop, sawed off the handle and slip
ped the Axe head under an over
coat.
Then the Cal men hopped a cable
car, heading toward the ferry and
eventually Cal. But at the ferry the
police, with a covey of Stanford
supporters, were preparing a recep
tion—including searches of Cal men.
"I thought the jig was up," Miller
said after. But it wasn't—on the
scene came the heroine of the piece,
a girl friend of the Cal man who
held the Axe.
He spied her about to board a
ferry to Oakland and hastily joined
the girl while a compatriot rushed
up with a ticket. When the Cal man,
the girl and the Axe reached Oak
land, The Axe was nestled in its

first strongbox—the safe of Morris
the Photographer.
The next day San Francisco news
papers splashed the story over their
front pages; it wasn't the last time
the Axe was to get front page space,
not by ,a long shot.
"NO FURTHER USE"
Soon after the original theft Cal
named a "Grand Custodian of the
Ax." The California daily paper
suggested, "Palo Alto will have no
further use for it | the Axe yell |,
after the occurence last Saturday."
Didn't turn out to be much of a pre
diction at that.
California held it's first Axe Rally
that week and in front of a huge
bonfire thoroughly raked Stanford
over the coals. That very day came
the first Stanford attempt to regain
the Axe. A Stanford man rode up
to the Chi Phi House at Berkeley on
horse back with a forged note asking
that the Axe be turned over to him.
He failed when the Axe Custodian
wouldn't fall for the ruse. Later that
night 50 Stanford roughs broke down
the fraternity house doors, and tore
the house apart looking for the Axe.
They never found it. It was hidden
behind an out-of-the-way sliding
door. 1
Professors of both universities
stepped in and calmed down the
heated feelings that were flaring up
at both campus' and after many un
successful Stanford attempts at re
gaining the Axe California men de
cided that a bank vault was the
safest place for it.
So for 30 years the only time the
Axe saw the light of day was when
the custodians took it out for the
Annual Axe Rally. For those 30
years the Stanford Axe remained in
Cal hands, a symbol of supremacy
over the hated rivals from Palo Alto,
but then dawned • the morning of
April 3, 1930, and the legendary,
storied Immortal 21.
But that's another story-

fight, they're just college boys, let
'em fight."
Into the middle of the riot came
one Billy Dunn, the top collegiate
dash man on the Coast—and a Cal
man at that. They shoved the Axe
at him screaming, "Run, Bill, run."
And run Bill did, with a howling
mob of Stanford roughs on his tail.
In a moment of confusion Dunn
handed the Axe over to who he
thought were Cal men—they weren't.
GONE AGAIN
But a beautiful flying tackle once
again wrested the Axe from Stanford
hands. These capturers hastily
boarded a passing delivery wagon,
going toward the ocean by a zig-zag
route. They went into a butcher
shop, sawed off the handle and slip
ped the Axe head under an over
coat.
Then the Cal men hopped a cable
car, heading toward the ferry and
eventually Cal. But at the ferry the
police, with a covey of Stanford
supporters, were preparing a recep
tion—including searches of Cal men.
"I thought the jig was up," Miller
said after. But it wasn't—on the
scene came the heroine of the piece,
a girl friend of the Cal man who
held the Axe.
He spied her about to board a
ferry to Oakland and hastily joined
the girl while a compatriot rushed
up with a ticket. When the Cal man,
the girl and the Axe reached Oak
land, The Axe was nestled in its

first strongbox—the safe of Morris
the Photographer.
The next day San Francisco news
papers splashed the story over their
front pages; it wasn't the last time
the Axe was to get front page space,
not by ,a long shot.
"NO FURTHER USE"
Soon after the original theft Cal
named a "Grand Custodian of the
Ax." The California daily paper
suggested, "Palo Alto will have no
further use for it | the Axe yell |,
after the occurence last Saturday."
Didn't turn out to be much of a pre
diction at that.
California held it's first Axe Rally
that week and in front of a huge
bonfire thoroughly raked Stanford
over the coals. That very day came
the first Stanford attempt to regain
the Axe. A Stanford man rode up
to the Chi Phi House at Berkeley on
horse back with a forged note asking
that the Axe be turned over to him.
He failed when the Axe Custodian
wouldn't fall for the ruse. Later that
night 50 Stanford roughs broke down
the fraternity house doors, and tore
the house apart looking for the Axe.
They never found it. It was hidden
behind an out-of-the-way sliding
door. 1
Professors of both universities
stepped in and calmed down the
heated feelings that were flaring up
at both campus' and after many un
successful Stanford attempts at re
gaining the Axe California men de
cided that a bank vault was the
safest place for it.
So for 30 years the only time the
Axe saw the light of day was when
the custodians took it out for the
Annual Axe Rally. For those 30
years the Stanford Axe remained in
Cal hands, a symbol of supremacy
over the hated rivals from Palo Alto,
but then dawned • the morning of
April 3, 1930, and the legendary,
storied Immortal 21.
But that's another story-


THE SPOlLS—California Axe Custodians oblige the Stanford rooting section with their annual
glimpse of the Axe—this "look, don't touch" policy for Stanford has been a feature of every
Big Game since 1947. Cal's eight-year monopoly isn't the longest span of possession in their
history, however. They stole the Axe from Stanford in 1899 and it wasn't until 1930 and the
Immortal 21 that the Stanford Axe came home.
It's not much of a trophy, just an axe. And it's not in very good
condition, hasn't even got a handle.
But this trophy, this axe, has lain among the jeweled contents
of bank vaults, has had its praises sung in the far corners of the
world, has even caused bitter blood to be shed.

Above all this trophy, the Stanford"
Axe, has symbolized more than any
thing else that time in life which
none can forget—"the good old col
lege days." For more than 50 years
the Axe has meant college to tens of
thousands of graduates from two of
the world's most famous schools,
Stanford University and the Univer
sity of California.
It has q brilliant and spirit-ridden
past, has this Axe.
It all began with a Stanford yell,
"Give 'em the Axe," which Univer
sity roughs began shouting at their
foes way back when, in 1896. not
long after Senator Leland Stanford
had established his University.
In 1899 some bright young student
came up with the idea of backing up
the yell with a real axe. So, in that
year before an all important Cal-
Stanford baseball game, the first
Stanford Axe Rally was held.
The big (10 pounds) lumberman's
axe was sharpened on a grindstone
at the rally, then tested on an effigy
of a Cal man. When "Play ball"
sounded the next day in San Fran
cisco the Indian yell leader (Billy
Erb) proudly waved the new Stan
ford Symbol in the faccs of Cal men.
THE AXL DOOMED
Mr. Erb shouldn't have been so
arrogant. He seemed so proud of
that Axe that the Cal boys got ideas
—"Let's steal that Axe," quoth one
of the Bear supporters and with that
simple sentence doomed Stanford's
Axe to 30 years of imprisonment far
from home—in Berkeley, Calif.
After the game (which Stanford
lost) four Cal men jumped the un
suspecting Stanford Axe guardians.
And so was spilled the first blood in
the Axe's history. Fists flew while
police stood by saying, "Let 'em
fight, they're just college boys, let

wouldn't fall for the ruse. Later that
night 50 Stanford roughs broke down
the fraternity house doors, and tore
the house apart looking for the Axe.
They never found it. It was hidden
behind an out-of-the-way sliding
door. 1
Professors of both universities
stepped in and calmed down the
heated feelings that were flaring up
at both campus' and after many un
successful Stanford attempts at re
gaining the Axe California men de
cided that a bank vault was the
safest place for it.
So for 30 years the only time the
Axe saw the light of day was when
the custodians took it out for the
Annual Axe Rally. For those 30
years the Stanford Axe remained in
Cal hands, a symbol of supremacy
over the hated rivals from Palo Alto,
but then dawned • the morning of
April 3, 1930, and the legendary,
storied Immortal 21.
But that's another story-


THE SPOlLS—California Axe Custodians oblige the Stanford rooting section with their annual
glimpse of the Axe—this "look, don't touch" policy for Stanford has been a feature of every
Big Game since 1947. Cal's eight-year monopoly isn't the longest span of possession in their
history, however. They stole the Axe from Stanford in 1899 and it wasn't until 1930 and the
Immortal 21 that the Stanford Axe came home.
It's not much of a trophy, just an axe. And it's not in very good
condition, hasn't even got a handle.
But this trophy, this axe, has lain among the jeweled contents
of bank vaults, has had its praises sung in the far corners of the
world, has even caused bitter blood to be shed.

Above all this trophy, the Stanford"
Axe, has symbolized more than any
thing else that time in life which
none can forget—"the good old col
lege days." For more than 50 years
the Axe has meant college to tens of
thousands of graduates from two of
the world's most famous schools,
Stanford University and the Univer
sity of California.
It has q brilliant and spirit-ridden
past, has this Axe.
It all began with a Stanford yell,
"Give 'em the Axe," which Univer
sity roughs began shouting at their
foes way back when, in 1896. not
long after Senator Leland Stanford
had established his University.
In 1899 some bright young student
came up with the idea of backing up
the yell with a real axe. So, in that
year before an all important Cal-
Stanford baseball game, the first
Stanford Axe Rally was held.
The big (10 pounds) lumberman's
axe was sharpened on a grindstone
at the rally, then tested on an effigy
of a Cal man. When "Play ball"
sounded the next day in San Fran
cisco the Indian yell leader (Billy
Erb) proudly waved the new Stan
ford Symbol in the faccs of Cal men.
THE AXL DOOMED
Mr. Erb shouldn't have been so
arrogant. He seemed so proud of
that Axe that the Cal boys got ideas
—"Let's steal that Axe," quoth one
of the Bear supporters and with that
simple sentence doomed Stanford's
Axe to 30 years of imprisonment far
from home—in Berkeley, Calif.
After the game (which Stanford
lost) four Cal men jumped the un
suspecting Stanford Axe guardians.
And so was spilled the first blood in
the Axe's history. Fists flew while
police stood by saying, "Let 'em
fight, they're just college boys, let
'em fight."
Into the middle of the riot came
one Billy Dunn, the top collegiate
dash man on the Coast—and a Cal
man at that. They shoved the Axe
at him screaming, "Run, Bill, run."
And run Bill did, with a howling
mob of Stanford roughs on his tail.
In a moment of confusion Dunn
handed the Axe over to who he
thought were Cal men—they weren't.
GONE AGAIN
But a beautiful flying tackle once
again wrested the Axe from Stanford
hands. These capturers hastily
boarded a passing delivery wagon,
going toward the ocean by a zig-zag
route. They went into a butcher
shop, sawed off the handle and slip
ped the Axe head under an over
coat.
Then the Cal men hopped a cable
car, heading toward the ferry and
eventually Cal. But at the ferry the
police, with a covey of Stanford
supporters, were preparing a recep
tion—including searches of Cal men.
"I thought the jig was up," Miller
said after. But it wasn't—on the
scene came the heroine of the piece,
a girl friend of the Cal man who
held the Axe.
He spied her about to board a
ferry to Oakland and hastily joined
the girl while a compatriot rushed
up with a ticket. When the Cal man,
the girl and the Axe reached Oak
land, The Axe was nestled in its

first strongbox—the safe of Morris
the Photographer.
The next day San Francisco news
papers splashed the story over their
front pages; it wasn't the last time
the Axe was to get front page space,
not by ,a long shot.
"NO FURTHER USE"
Soon after the original theft Cal
named a "Grand Custodian of the
Ax." The California daily paper
suggested, "Palo Alto will have no
further use for it | the Axe yell |,
after the occurence last Saturday."
Didn't turn out to be much of a pre
diction at that.
California held it's first Axe Rally
that week and in front of a huge
bonfire thoroughly raked Stanford
over the coals. That very day came
the first Stanford attempt to regain
the Axe. A Stanford man rode up
to the Chi Phi House at Berkeley on
horse back with a forged note asking
that the Axe be turned over to him.
He failed when the Axe Custodian
wouldn't fall for the ruse. Later that
night 50 Stanford roughs broke down
