# Paul Speegle Tells Of 'The Presence'
## 
### 
Stanford head yell leader in 1930
who led the rallies for the 21 was
Paul Speegle who is now doing a
radio-TV column, "Strictly Speegle,"
for the San Francisco News.
He recalls the day the Immortal 21
brought the Axe back to Quad in
this way:
"The years have somewhat dim
med my memory of that frantic mo
ment in front of thp library when
"The Presence" was held aloft and
the students went out of their minds
with ecstasy, but if my college ca
reer had been brought to an abrupt
end at that moment I would have
felt as if I had achieved greatness,
just by being part of" the celebra
tion.
"It was a very all - consuming,
overwhelming experience â€” sort of
like being told by the nurse that
you have just become the proud
father of sextuplets, each weighing
eight pounds."
