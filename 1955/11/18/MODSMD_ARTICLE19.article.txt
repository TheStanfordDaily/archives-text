# After 31 Years Farm's Dream Was a Reality
## 
### 
On April 3, 1930, 21 men
brought back the Stanford Axe.
It had been in the hands of the
University of California since
1899.
Twenty-one men had accomplish
ed what thousands had only dreamed
of doing during those 31 long years.
The 21 became "immortal" and 19130
became THE YEAR.
The '21 had a well thought-out
plan. Don Kropp had organized a
group of Sequoia Hall men four
years previous to 'get the Axe. They
maintained strict secrecy.
On the day of recovery Kropp
and James Trimingham drove to
Oakland where they rented a car,
rigging a bogus movie camera on its
top. The others were awaiting the
camera car at the Berkeley bank
where the Axe was to be stored fol
lowing a Cal rally.
Here's how the 21 set the scene:
"The Stanford men moved ner
vously in their positions as they im
patiently awaited armed car
[carrying the Axe|. h: was not long
before, a black, steel-covered Stude
baker hove into sight. It carried the
Axe, Horner | Norm Horner, Cal Axe
Custodian |, an armed guard and a
driver."
Four Stanford men hung on the
Ccfr. The remaining 21 took positions
around it, near the bank door.
"To allow ample time for these
manuevers the fake cameramen were
loudly demanding, 'Let's have a good
shot at the Axe.' "
Publicity eager freshmen drew
back and Horner stepped out with
the Axo. Howard Avery dropped
from the top of the car onto the un
suspecting custodian. He seized the
Axe and passed it bucket brigade
fashion to Bob Loofbourow.
Loofbourow tucked the Axe under
his sweater and calmly sauntered to
the camera car where Trimingham
waited' to drive him away. As they
were leaving Arthur Miller dropped
a tear gas bomb into the crowd.
The incensed Cal mob violently
pushed Avery into the bank. Eric
Hill and Jerry Bettman rushed to
his aid and the three escaped when
tear gas swept into the bank.
Meanwhile, Louis Fcrrino and his
group helped delay chase. They
posed as Cal students, leading a wild
goose chase to the university's Cam
panile.
Within 50 minutes the Axe was
home. It was driven from Berkeley,
through Oakland, at speeds pushing
80 most of the way.
That night a huge impromtu rally
was held on the Farm. It lasted al
most till dawn.
The deed was done. Thirty-one
years after Cal had stolen the Stan
ford Axe it was back home. '
And 21 students had become "im
mortal."
