# Football's Greatest Rivalry To Resume Tomorrow
## 
### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
This is it. The big day is just around the corner. The question
will soon be answered. Can Stanford win back the Axe?
Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. upwards of 90,000 people will be jammed
into Stanford Stadium to find out the answer. At approximately
4 p.m. the answer will be known, and, barring just about ihe great
est upset in Big Game history, the answer will be yes.
The Indians are solid 20-point favorites to whip the Bears and
thus end nine long and bitterly frustrating years of defeat and
deadlock at the hands of California.
Not since 1946 have the Indians taken the Axe. Not since 1935
has Stanford won the Big One in Stanford Stadium. This should
bo the year that both losing skeins are broken.
The Big Red Machine has been rolling along in impressive style
for the last three weeks. Chuck Taylor's men have shown con
siderable strength in belting San Jose State, Southern Cal and
Oregon.
Earlier defeats at the hands of Oregon State, Michigan State
and UCLA and a tie v/ith Washington give the cards an unimpres
sive 5-3-1 record, but the team that handled USC and Oregon in
the last two weeks has looked anything but unimpressive.
The improvement of late in Stanford's grid fortunes is due
largely to the development of quarterback John Brodie, the steady
improvement of the line, and the continued excellence of full
j back Bill Tarr.
Brodie has come along fast in the last three weeks. He is now
a fine field general and has even improved his always sharp
i passing.
The rifle-armed Brodie is now ranked eighth in the nation in
passing and 12tn in total offense.
The line has been steadily improving all year long. Paul Wig
gin and co-captain Chris Marshall give Stanford as powerful a
tackle combination as will be found on the coast or, perhaps, any
wheie in the collegiate ranks.
Totiv Mosich and Donn Car.swell are touqh, reliable performers

at guard, and center Joe Long has done an outstanding lineback
ing job for Chuck Taylor all season.
Jerry Beatie has shown steady improvement in all phases and
his running mate at end, John Stewart, has made a great come
back from a midseason slump. Stewart now leads the conference
in pass receptions.
Tarr has been the ol' reliable for the Cards. He ranks 10th in
the nation in rushing and has carried the ball on more rushing
plays than any other player in the United States.
Paul Camera and Gordy Young have been solid at halfback
for Stanford. Camera, used primarily as a flanker, has caught
19 passes to rank second behind Stewart in the PCC. He has
caught five touchdown passes.
Young has started the last two games and has complemented
! his fine running ability with some outstanding defensive moves.
The Cards as a team have jelled into a powerful offensive and
defensive unit. Stanford is the Pacific Coast Conference leader
in total and passing offense. The Indians are third in the confer
ence in total defense and in rushing defense.
The Bec.rs will be hard pressed to contain the Stanford attack,
! let alone move well themselves.
Coach "Pappy" Waldorf of Cal has had trouble this year in
retaining a permanent starting lineup. The "Wise Walrus," in
•the midst of his v/orst season at Berkeley, has been plagued by
injuries all season.
Pappy's most reliable performer is end Jim Carmichael. Car-

Michael this year has caught 12 passes for 221 yards and has
been tough on defense.
The rest of Waldorf's line is fairly solid when healthy. Ron
Wheatcroft, a converted end, and big Bob Oliver hold down the
tackle positions while Don Mitchell and Carlos Fackrell or Nick
Poppin take over the guard spots. The center is Don Mitchell
and the end opposite Carmichael is Bill Vallotton.
Hugh Maguire will probably start at quarterback for Cal al
though he is being pressed by Ralph Hoffman. Maguire is a
capable signal caller and passer. Hoffman, just up from the
Ramblers, has done well in varsity competition, especially against
Washington two weeks ago.
Johnny Wilson and Ted Granger run from the halfback slots
with Granger being particularly dangerous. He broke away last
week against Oregon Stale for a 66-yard touchdown run.
Steve Dimeff is Waldorf's choice at fullback. Dimeff is a good
plunger and a fine blocker. He is also used frequently as a pass
receiver.
And so the battle .lin33 are drawn for tomorrow's game which
will be the 58th in the series. Cal now has the edge in victories,
24 to 23, with 10 games ending in ties.
The weatherman has not yet ventured a definite guess as to
the nature of Saturday's skies, but rain, snow, sleet or hail, both
teams will show.
Captains Tarr and Marshall of Stanford will meet with captains
Dimeff and Carmichael of California in the center of the field. |
The coin v/ill be tossed and the decisions made.
The referee v/ill blow his whistle, and both teams will huddle
hurriedly with their coaches. There will be the traditional grasp
ing of hands in the huddles, and the starting elevens v/ill break
onto the field to a roar of encouragement from their teammates.
Both teams will line up, the referee will again sound his whistle,
90,000 people will rise, and either Tony Mosich or Bob Oliver
will advance on the ball.
Toe will hit leather, the pigskin will fly into the November air,
and the greatest rivalry in ciil of college football will be ienewed.

90,000 people will rise, and either Tony Mosich or Bob Oliver
will advance on the ball.
Toe will hit leather, the pigskin will fly into the November air,
and the greatest rivalry in ciil of college football will be ienewed.
We want the Axe!
This is it. The big day is just around the corner. The question
will soon be answered. Can Stanford win back the Axe?
Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. upwards of 90,000 people will be jammed
into Stanford Stadium to find out the answer. At approximately
4 p.m. the answer will be known, and, barring just about ihe great
est upset in Big Game history, the answer will be yes.
The Indians are solid 20-point favorites to whip the Bears and
thus end nine long and bitterly frustrating years of defeat and
deadlock at the hands of California.
Not since 1946 have the Indians taken the Axe. Not since 1935
has Stanford won the Big One in Stanford Stadium. This should
bo the year that both losing skeins are broken.
The Big Red Machine has been rolling along in impressive style
for the last three weeks. Chuck Taylor's men have shown con
siderable strength in belting San Jose State, Southern Cal and
Oregon.
Earlier defeats at the hands of Oregon State, Michigan State
and UCLA and a tie v/ith Washington give the cards an unimpres
sive 5-3-1 record, but the team that handled USC and Oregon in
the last two weeks has looked anything but unimpressive.
The improvement of late in Stanford's grid fortunes is due
largely to the development of quarterback John Brodie, the steady
improvement of the line, and the continued excellence of full
j back Bill Tarr.
Brodie has come along fast in the last three weeks. He is now
a fine field general and has even improved his always sharp
i passing.
The rifle-armed Brodie is now ranked eighth in the nation in
passing and 12tn in total offense.
The line has been steadily improving all year long. Paul Wig
gin and co-captain Chris Marshall give Stanford as powerful a
tackle combination as will be found on the coast or, perhaps, any
wheie in the collegiate ranks.
Totiv Mosich and Donn Car.swell are touqh, reliable performers

at guard, and center Joe Long has done an outstanding lineback
ing job for Chuck Taylor all season.
Jerry Beatie has shown steady improvement in all phases and
his running mate at end, John Stewart, has made a great come
back from a midseason slump. Stewart now leads the conference
in pass receptions.
Tarr has been the ol' reliable for the Cards. He ranks 10th in
the nation in rushing and has carried the ball on more rushing
plays than any other player in the United States.
Paul Camera and Gordy Young have been solid at halfback
for Stanford. Camera, used primarily as a flanker, has caught
19 passes to rank second behind Stewart in the PCC. He has
caught five touchdown passes.
Young has started the last two games and has complemented
! his fine running ability with some outstanding defensive moves.
The Cards as a team have jelled into a powerful offensive and
defensive unit. Stanford is the Pacific Coast Conference leader
in total and passing offense. The Indians are third in the confer
ence in total defense and in rushing defense.
The Bec.rs will be hard pressed to contain the Stanford attack,
! let alone move well themselves.
Coach "Pappy" Waldorf of Cal has had trouble this year in
retaining a permanent starting lineup. The "Wise Walrus," in
•the midst of his v/orst season at Berkeley, has been plagued by
injuries all season.
Pappy's most reliable performer is end Jim Carmichael. Car-

Michael this year has caught 12 passes for 221 yards and has
been tough on defense.
The rest of Waldorf's line is fairly solid when healthy. Ron
Wheatcroft, a converted end, and big Bob Oliver hold down the
tackle positions while Don Mitchell and Carlos Fackrell or Nick
Poppin take over the guard spots. The center is Don Mitchell
and the end opposite Carmichael is Bill Vallotton.
Hugh Maguire will probably start at quarterback for Cal al
though he is being pressed by Ralph Hoffman. Maguire is a
capable signal caller and passer. Hoffman, just up from the
Ramblers, has done well in varsity competition, especially against
Washington two weeks ago.
Johnny Wilson and Ted Granger run from the halfback slots
with Granger being particularly dangerous. He broke away last
week against Oregon Stale for a 66-yard touchdown run.
Steve Dimeff is Waldorf's choice at fullback. Dimeff is a good
plunger and a fine blocker. He is also used frequently as a pass
receiver.
And so the battle .lin33 are drawn for tomorrow's game which
will be the 58th in the series. Cal now has the edge in victories,
24 to 23, with 10 games ending in ties.
The weatherman has not yet ventured a definite guess as to
the nature of Saturday's skies, but rain, snow, sleet or hail, both
teams will show.
Captains Tarr and Marshall of Stanford will meet with captains
Dimeff and Carmichael of California in the center of the field. |
The coin v/ill be tossed and the decisions made.
The referee v/ill blow his whistle, and both teams will huddle
hurriedly with their coaches. There will be the traditional grasp
ing of hands in the huddles, and the starting elevens v/ill break
onto the field to a roar of encouragement from their teammates.
Both teams will line up, the referee will again sound his whistle,
90,000 people will rise, and either Tony Mosich or Bob Oliver

hurriedly with their coaches. There will be the traditional grasp
ing of hands in the huddles, and the starting elevens v/ill break
onto the field to a roar of encouragement from their teammates.
Both teams will line up, the referee will again sound his whistle,
90,000 people will rise, and either Tony Mosich or Bob Oliver
will advance on the ball.
Toe will hit leather, the pigskin will fly into the November air,
and the greatest rivalry in ciil of college football will be ienewed.
We want the Axe!
This is it. The big day is just around the corner. The question
will soon be answered. Can Stanford win back the Axe?
Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. upwards of 90,000 people will be jammed
into Stanford Stadium to find out the answer. At approximately
4 p.m. the answer will be known, and, barring just about ihe great
est upset in Big Game history, the answer will be yes.
The Indians are solid 20-point favorites to whip the Bears and
thus end nine long and bitterly frustrating years of defeat and
deadlock at the hands of California.
Not since 1946 have the Indians taken the Axe. Not since 1935
has Stanford won the Big One in Stanford Stadium. This should
bo the year that both losing skeins are broken.
The Big Red Machine has been rolling along in impressive style
for the last three weeks. Chuck Taylor's men have shown con
siderable strength in belting San Jose State, Southern Cal and
Oregon.
Earlier defeats at the hands of Oregon State, Michigan State
and UCLA and a tie v/ith Washington give the cards an unimpres
sive 5-3-1 record, but the team that handled USC and Oregon in
the last two weeks has looked anything but unimpressive.
The improvement of late in Stanford's grid fortunes is due
largely to the development of quarterback John Brodie, the steady
improvement of the line, and the continued excellence of full
j back Bill Tarr.
Brodie has come along fast in the last three weeks. He is now
a fine field general and has even improved his always sharp
i passing.
The rifle-armed Brodie is now ranked eighth in the nation in
passing and 12tn in total offense.
The line has been steadily improving all year long. Paul Wig
gin and co-captain Chris Marshall give Stanford as powerful a
tackle combination as will be found on the coast or, perhaps, any
wheie in the collegiate ranks.
Totiv Mosich and Donn Car.swell are touqh, reliable performers

at guard, and center Joe Long has done an outstanding lineback
ing job for Chuck Taylor all season.
Jerry Beatie has shown steady improvement in all phases and
his running mate at end, John Stewart, has made a great come
back from a midseason slump. Stewart now leads the conference
in pass receptions.
Tarr has been the ol' reliable for the Cards. He ranks 10th in
the nation in rushing and has carried the ball on more rushing
plays than any other player in the United States.
Paul Camera and Gordy Young have been solid at halfback
for Stanford. Camera, used primarily as a flanker, has caught
19 passes to rank second behind Stewart in the PCC. He has
caught five touchdown passes.
Young has started the last two games and has complemented
! his fine running ability with some outstanding defensive moves.
The Cards as a team have jelled into a powerful offensive and
defensive unit. Stanford is the Pacific Coast Conference leader
in total and passing offense. The Indians are third in the confer
ence in total defense and in rushing defense.
The Bec.rs will be hard pressed to contain the Stanford attack,
! let alone move well themselves.
Coach "Pappy" Waldorf of Cal has had trouble this year in
retaining a permanent starting lineup. The "Wise Walrus," in
•the midst of his v/orst season at Berkeley, has been plagued by
injuries all season.
Pappy's most reliable performer is end Jim Carmichael. Car-

Michael this year has caught 12 passes for 221 yards and has
been tough on defense.
The rest of Waldorf's line is fairly solid when healthy. Ron
Wheatcroft, a converted end, and big Bob Oliver hold down the
tackle positions while Don Mitchell and Carlos Fackrell or Nick
Poppin take over the guard spots. The center is Don Mitchell
and the end opposite Carmichael is Bill Vallotton.
Hugh Maguire will probably start at quarterback for Cal al
though he is being pressed by Ralph Hoffman. Maguire is a
capable signal caller and passer. Hoffman, just up from the
Ramblers, has done well in varsity competition, especially against
Washington two weeks ago.
Johnny Wilson and Ted Granger run from the halfback slots
with Granger being particularly dangerous. He broke away last
week against Oregon Stale for a 66-yard touchdown run.
Steve Dimeff is Waldorf's choice at fullback. Dimeff is a good
plunger and a fine blocker. He is also used frequently as a pass
receiver.
And so the battle .lin33 are drawn for tomorrow's game which
will be the 58th in the series. Cal now has the edge in victories,
24 to 23, with 10 games ending in ties.
The weatherman has not yet ventured a definite guess as to
the nature of Saturday's skies, but rain, snow, sleet or hail, both
teams will show.
Captains Tarr and Marshall of Stanford will meet with captains
Dimeff and Carmichael of California in the center of the field. |
