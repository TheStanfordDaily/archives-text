# Knight 'May' Help In Axe Exchange
## 
### 
Among the throng at the Big Game
tomorrow there will be one well
known fan with divided loyalties.
He's Governor Goodwin J. Knight,
member of the University of Cali
fornia Board of Regents and a Stan
ford alumnus.
Knight was graduated from Stan
ford in 1919.
The governor may get in on the
first exchange of the Axe since Stan
ford turned it over to Cal in 1947.
