## Heroes' Silver Anniversary— Time Hasn't Dimmed the Spirit Legendary 21 Recall 1930 Axe Recovery; Twenty-five Years Later It's Still—'Beat Cal' 
### 
This year marks the silver anniversary of the legendary ex
ploits of the Immortal 21.
Right after the Axe recovery in 1930 they were the toast of the
campus. They were wined and dined, all were given a block S.
Even on their University record cards today one can see under
'"Honors" — "Recovery of the Axe"*

right along witli the Phi Beta Kappa
distinctions some earned.
Twenty-five years is a long time
and people change, perhaps even
"immortal" people, so The Daily has
contacted some of the Immortal 21
to see how the years since the re
covery have treated them, to see if
the old Stanford spirit is still there.
Robert Gordon says in looking
back, ". . . we did I't need much per
suading about a chance to embar
rass those Berkeley bums," but that
he didn't think anyone really ex
pected the project to be a success.
"If an old evil is to be righted,
you just have to keep swinging at
it—so in 1930 we took our turn de
termined to do the best we could."
"The Axe in Berkeley was a chal
lenge which we accepted," he says.
PERMANENT TROPHY
On making the Axe a permanent
trophy (which it hadn't been until
after the 21 had captured it) he said,
"We should probably congratulate
ourselves that our Stanford adminis
tration immediately took the oppor
tunity to make a decision which for
over 30 years previously, the UC
administration had lacked the forti
tude or good sense to make.
"The decision on Stanford's part
was both generous and practical. I
must admit at the time we all felt
very sad over this decision."
Back in those days students were
much opposed to making the Axe a
permanent trophy, feeling as a front
page editorial in a 1930 Daily said,
"The Axe is not and never was a
trophy to be passed from hand to
hand . . . the Axe and Stanford are
inalienable."
Gordon is currently on the mathe
matics faculty of California State
Polytechnic College in San Luis
Obispo, is married and has a two
year-old son.
Donald Kropp, who supervised the
recovery, says that even now "the
condition of my ulcers is in direct
relation to the Stanford success on
the field." and that he expects "to
be completely recovered from any
intestinal disturbance conje tomor
row."
Kropp is presently a trial lawyer
in San Francisco, and a life mem
ber of the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion.
George B. Likens, now assistant
chief attorney for the Veterans' Ad
ministration in San Francisco, says
he's "somewhat startled at the ripe
old age of 45 to be considered a leg
end."
"ROWDY. AT TIMES"
On the forming of the plan Likens
noted. "Our group for the most part
consisted of residents at the long
departed Sequoia Hall." It was a
close-knit and "rowdy, at times,'
family, he said.
Likens is married and noted, "Like
all good Stanford men, I took for a
bride other than one of the then
chosen 500. My wife, Florence,

comes from a school in Southern
California related in some fashion to
the Bears, whose name I haven't
mentioned for several years—maybe
next year though."
"You ask if I still follow Stanford
ford sports. Let's put it this way.
My boss, Joe Brodie, is the uncle of
John Brodie—you know darned well
I follow sports."
NOT A THEFT
When Robert Loofbourow, far
away in Minneapolis, was asked,
"Does the event still seem exciting,
do you still remember it?" he an
swered with an emphatic, "Of
course."
He stressed that his group did not
"steal" the Axe, that California stole
it and that the 21 "recovered it."
Loofbourow is a consulting min
ing engineer, married and has four
children. Two'of his offspring were
graduated from the University of
Minnesota. His wife, Melba Colm, is
a 1929 Stanford graduate.
Arthur L. Miller recalls that re
covery attempts were "traditional"
but that the 21's plan was to avoid
the use of force which had been
characteristic of prior attempts.
"The idea of failure or the factor j
of punishment from the adminis- j
tration, frankly, never entered our i
heads. We thought plenty, however, I
of what would happen to us if caught
by Cal students."
CLOSE BIND
He says the adventure, like that of
being on the 1931 championship j
baseball squad, makes him feel ;
prouder and binds him closer to
Stanford.
"Chuck Taylor has done an out- |
standing job of coaching and I agree I
that 'This is the Year'."
He's now principal of Sequoia I
Junior High School in Fresno and j
notes, "My students know nothing j
of my past history as a kleptoma-
niac."
Miller is married and has two j
children. He frequently visits the j
i Stanford campus.
YOUNGEST MEMBER
Robson Taylor, who now lives ;
! at the unlikely address of Stanford j
Avenue in Berkeley, was the young- |
est 21 member and the only sopho
more in the group. He said, "We '
members of the 21 were a mighty j
lucky bunch of Stanford students— j
jit was just our good fortune to be j
at the right place at the right time
j with the right equipment for the !
job."
"I have seen dry years in Stanford
football history as well as California
history but I believe our famine is
coming to an end this Nov. 19."
Taylor is an engineer with the
California Research Corp. in Rich
mond, married, has two boys and a j
girl and says his interest in Stanford \
sports is as great today as it ever j
was.
"HIGH POINT"
James Trimingham, mayor of j
Pleasanton, Calif., for four years, j
calls the Axe recovery "the high j
point of my college career." He 1
called the 21 "average loyal Stanford !

j men, who would rather play a rous
j ing game of touch tackle than attend
i an extracurricular discussion on a
| technical subject."
j "Probably another important fac
| tor in the decision to make the try
! was that none of our group were
j first-team athletes on a varsity team,
I but we were all athletes at heart.
This was a chance to do something
! for the glory of Stanford, just as the
: football and other teams did.
"Right after the theft we were as
I happy as our football team was after
beating USC this season. And don't
i think we aren't happy about that
either."
"After the theft," Trimingham said,
! "I got so far behind in my studies
| that at the end of the term I had
I mostly incompletes."
He said that making the Axe a
permanent trophy was wise. "Stu
dents would probably now use an
atomic bomb instead of our tear gas
bomb."
Trimingham has a son at Stan
! ford. Robert, living in Wilbur Hall.
| Trimingham Sr. has a season ticket
j every year for football and never
: misses a Big Game, he says.
! "POOR CAL"
Gerald Bettman said. "I certainly
j hope that we recover the Axe this
year. It was the year we stole the
! Axe that the call "Poor Cal" started

and I'd certainly like to chant that
one again. I don't care how large the
score is, as long as we're on the long
end.
"I believe that the Axe is serving
its best purpose as a Big Game tro
phy. Everyone knows that it was
originally Stanford's Axe and that it
was recovered. We can afford to be
generous with it."
Bettman now teaches school in Los
Molinos, Calif. His step-on, Charles
Cunningham, was graduated from
Stanford in 1951. Another son, Ger
ald Jr., is now a Stanford freshman.
Bettman hopes to send his youngest
son to Stanford soon.
Glenford Brunson, who also at
tended business school at Stanford,
is currently with the California Stale
Department of Finance.
Other 21 members couldn't be
reached and two, Raymond Walsh
and Gordon Snodgrass, are deceased.
So there's the 25th anniversary
story of some of the 21 Stanford men
who caused the Daily Californian to
bitterly moan one morning back in
1930: .
"Hate Stanford! Catch the eu
phony of that sentence, notice its
essential accuracy! Hate Stanford!
Repeat it over and over in your
mind; formulate it with your lips!
Hate Stanford!"
Things don't seem to have changed
in 25 years.

heads. We thought plenty, however, I
of what would happen to us if caught
by Cal students."
CLOSE BIND
He says the adventure, like that of
being on the 1931 championship j
baseball squad, makes him feel ;
prouder and binds him closer to
Stanford.
"Chuck Taylor has done an out- |
standing job of coaching and I agree I
that 'This is the Year'."
He's now principal of Sequoia I
Junior High School in Fresno and j
notes, "My students know nothing j
of my past history as a kleptoma-
niac."
Miller is married and has two j
children. He frequently visits the j
i Stanford campus.
YOUNGEST MEMBER
Robson Taylor, who now lives ;
! at the unlikely address of Stanford j
Avenue in Berkeley, was the young- |
est 21 member and the only sopho
more in the group. He said, "We '
members of the 21 were a mighty j
lucky bunch of Stanford students— j
jit was just our good fortune to be j
at the right place at the right time
j with the right equipment for the !
job."
"I have seen dry years in Stanford
football history as well as California
history but I believe our famine is
coming to an end this Nov. 19."
Taylor is an engineer with the
California Research Corp. in Rich
mond, married, has two boys and a j
girl and says his interest in Stanford \
sports is as great today as it ever j
was.
"HIGH POINT"
James Trimingham, mayor of j
Pleasanton, Calif., for four years, j
calls the Axe recovery "the high j
point of my college career." He 1
called the 21 "average loyal Stanford !

j men, who would rather play a rous
j ing game of touch tackle than attend
i an extracurricular discussion on a
| technical subject."
j "Probably another important fac
| tor in the decision to make the try
! was that none of our group were
j first-team athletes on a varsity team,
I but we were all athletes at heart.
This was a chance to do something
! for the glory of Stanford, just as the
: football and other teams did.
"Right after the theft we were as
I happy as our football team was after
beating USC this season. And don't
i think we aren't happy about that
either."
"After the theft," Trimingham said,
! "I got so far behind in my studies
| that at the end of the term I had
I mostly incompletes."
He said that making the Axe a
permanent trophy was wise. "Stu
dents would probably now use an
atomic bomb instead of our tear gas
bomb."
Trimingham has a son at Stan
! ford. Robert, living in Wilbur Hall.
| Trimingham Sr. has a season ticket
j every year for football and never
: misses a Big Game, he says.
! "POOR CAL"
Gerald Bettman said. "I certainly
j hope that we recover the Axe this
year. It was the year we stole the
! Axe that the call "Poor Cal" started

and I'd certainly like to chant that
one again. I don't care how large the
score is, as long as we're on the long
end.
"I believe that the Axe is serving
its best purpose as a Big Game tro
phy. Everyone knows that it was
originally Stanford's Axe and that it
was recovered. We can afford to be
generous with it."
Bettman now teaches school in Los
Molinos, Calif. His step-on, Charles
Cunningham, was graduated from
Stanford in 1951. Another son, Ger
ald Jr., is now a Stanford freshman.
Bettman hopes to send his youngest
son to Stanford soon.
Glenford Brunson, who also at
tended business school at Stanford,
is currently with the California Stale
Department of Finance.
Other 21 members couldn't be
reached and two, Raymond Walsh
and Gordon Snodgrass, are deceased.
So there's the 25th anniversary
story of some of the 21 Stanford men
who caused the Daily Californian to
bitterly moan one morning back in
1930: .
"Hate Stanford! Catch the eu
phony of that sentence, notice its
essential accuracy! Hate Stanford!
Repeat it over and over in your
mind; formulate it with your lips!
Hate Stanford!"
Things don't seem to have changed
in 25 years.


THE IMMORTAL 21 DEPOSITING THE AXE IN A PALO ALTO BANK


GEORGE LIKENS


GERALD BETTMAN


ARTHUR MiILER
This year marks the silver anniversary of the legendary ex
ploits of the Immortal 21.
Right after the Axe recovery in 1930 they were the toast of the
campus. They were wined and dined, all were given a block S.
Even on their University record cards today one can see under
'"Honors" — "Recovery of the Axe"*

right along witli the Phi Beta Kappa
distinctions some earned.
Twenty-five years is a long time
and people change, perhaps even
"immortal" people, so The Daily has
contacted some of the Immortal 21
to see how the years since the re
covery have treated them, to see if
the old Stanford spirit is still there.
Robert Gordon says in looking
back, ". . . we did I't need much per
suading about a chance to embar
rass those Berkeley bums," but that
he didn't think anyone really ex
pected the project to be a success.
"If an old evil is to be righted,
you just have to keep swinging at
it—so in 1930 we took our turn de
termined to do the best we could."
"The Axe in Berkeley was a chal
lenge which we accepted," he says.
PERMANENT TROPHY
On making the Axe a permanent
trophy (which it hadn't been until
after the 21 had captured it) he said,
"We should probably congratulate
ourselves that our Stanford adminis
tration immediately took the oppor
tunity to make a decision which for
over 30 years previously, the UC
administration had lacked the forti
tude or good sense to make.
"The decision on Stanford's part
was both generous and practical. I
must admit at the time we all felt
very sad over this decision."
Back in those days students were
much opposed to making the Axe a
permanent trophy, feeling as a front
page editorial in a 1930 Daily said,
"The Axe is not and never was a
trophy to be passed from hand to
hand . . . the Axe and Stanford are
inalienable."
Gordon is currently on the mathe
matics faculty of California State
Polytechnic College in San Luis
Obispo, is married and has a two
year-old son.
Donald Kropp, who supervised the
recovery, says that even now "the
condition of my ulcers is in direct
relation to the Stanford success on
the field." and that he expects "to
be completely recovered from any
intestinal disturbance conje tomor
row."
Kropp is presently a trial lawyer
in San Francisco, and a life mem
ber of the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion.
George B. Likens, now assistant
chief attorney for the Veterans' Ad
ministration in San Francisco, says
he's "somewhat startled at the ripe
old age of 45 to be considered a leg
end."
"ROWDY. AT TIMES"
On the forming of the plan Likens
noted. "Our group for the most part
consisted of residents at the long
departed Sequoia Hall." It was a
close-knit and "rowdy, at times,'
family, he said.
Likens is married and noted, "Like
all good Stanford men, I took for a
bride other than one of the then
chosen 500. My wife, Florence,

comes from a school in Southern
California related in some fashion to
the Bears, whose name I haven't
mentioned for several years—maybe
next year though."
"You ask if I still follow Stanford
ford sports. Let's put it this way.
My boss, Joe Brodie, is the uncle of
John Brodie—you know darned well
I follow sports."
NOT A THEFT
When Robert Loofbourow, far
away in Minneapolis, was asked,
"Does the event still seem exciting,
do you still remember it?" he an
swered with an emphatic, "Of
course."
He stressed that his group did not
"steal" the Axe, that California stole
it and that the 21 "recovered it."
Loofbourow is a consulting min
ing engineer, married and has four
children. Two'of his offspring were
graduated from the University of
Minnesota. His wife, Melba Colm, is
a 1929 Stanford graduate.
Arthur L. Miller recalls that re
covery attempts were "traditional"
but that the 21's plan was to avoid
the use of force which had been
characteristic of prior attempts.
"The idea of failure or the factor j
of punishment from the adminis- j
tration, frankly, never entered our i
heads. We thought plenty, however, I
of what would happen to us if caught
by Cal students."
CLOSE BIND
He says the adventure, like that of
being on the 1931 championship j
baseball squad, makes him feel ;
prouder and binds him closer to
Stanford.
"Chuck Taylor has done an out- |

This year marks the silver anniversary of the legendary ex
ploits of the Immortal 21.
Right after the Axe recovery in 1930 they were the toast of the
campus. They were wined and dined, all were given a block S.
Even on their University record cards today one can see under
'"Honors" — "Recovery of the Axe"*

right along witli the Phi Beta Kappa
distinctions some earned.
Twenty-five years is a long time
and people change, perhaps even
"immortal" people, so The Daily has
contacted some of the Immortal 21
to see how the years since the re
covery have treated them, to see if
the old Stanford spirit is still there.
Robert Gordon says in looking
back, ". . . we did I't need much per
suading about a chance to embar
rass those Berkeley bums," but that
he didn't think anyone really ex
pected the project to be a success.
"If an old evil is to be righted,
you just have to keep swinging at
it—so in 1930 we took our turn de
termined to do the best we could."
"The Axe in Berkeley was a chal
lenge which we accepted," he says.
PERMANENT TROPHY
On making the Axe a permanent
trophy (which it hadn't been until
after the 21 had captured it) he said,
"We should probably congratulate
ourselves that our Stanford adminis
tration immediately took the oppor
tunity to make a decision which for
over 30 years previously, the UC
administration had lacked the forti
tude or good sense to make.
"The decision on Stanford's part
was both generous and practical. I
must admit at the time we all felt
very sad over this decision."
Back in those days students were
much opposed to making the Axe a
permanent trophy, feeling as a front
page editorial in a 1930 Daily said,
"The Axe is not and never was a
trophy to be passed from hand to
hand . . . the Axe and Stanford are
inalienable."
Gordon is currently on the mathe
matics faculty of California State
Polytechnic College in San Luis
Obispo, is married and has a two
year-old son.
Donald Kropp, who supervised the
recovery, says that even now "the
condition of my ulcers is in direct
relation to the Stanford success on
the field." and that he expects "to
be completely recovered from any
intestinal disturbance conje tomor
row."
Kropp is presently a trial lawyer
in San Francisco, and a life mem
ber of the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion.
George B. Likens, now assistant
chief attorney for the Veterans' Ad
ministration in San Francisco, says
he's "somewhat startled at the ripe
old age of 45 to be considered a leg
end."
"ROWDY. AT TIMES"
On the forming of the plan Likens
noted. "Our group for the most part
consisted of residents at the long
departed Sequoia Hall." It was a
close-knit and "rowdy, at times,'
family, he said.
Likens is married and noted, "Like
all good Stanford men, I took for a
bride other than one of the then
chosen 500. My wife, Florence,

comes from a school in Southern
California related in some fashion to
the Bears, whose name I haven't
mentioned for several years—maybe
next year though."
"You ask if I still follow Stanford
ford sports. Let's put it this way.
My boss, Joe Brodie, is the uncle of
John Brodie—you know darned well
I follow sports."
NOT A THEFT
When Robert Loofbourow, far
away in Minneapolis, was asked,
"Does the event still seem exciting,
do you still remember it?" he an
swered with an emphatic, "Of
course."
He stressed that his group did not
"steal" the Axe, that California stole
it and that the 21 "recovered it."
Loofbourow is a consulting min
ing engineer, married and has four
children. Two'of his offspring were
graduated from the University of
Minnesota. His wife, Melba Colm, is
a 1929 Stanford graduate.
Arthur L. Miller recalls that re
covery attempts were "traditional"
but that the 21's plan was to avoid
the use of force which had been
characteristic of prior attempts.
"The idea of failure or the factor j
of punishment from the adminis- j
tration, frankly, never entered our i
heads. We thought plenty, however, I
of what would happen to us if caught
by Cal students."
CLOSE BIND
He says the adventure, like that of
being on the 1931 championship j
baseball squad, makes him feel ;
prouder and binds him closer to
Stanford.
"Chuck Taylor has done an out- |
standing job of coaching and I agree I
that 'This is the Year'."
He's now principal of Sequoia I
Junior High School in Fresno and j
notes, "My students know nothing j
of my past history as a kleptoma-
niac."
Miller is married and has two j
children. He frequently visits the j
i Stanford campus.
YOUNGEST MEMBER
Robson Taylor, who now lives ;
! at the unlikely address of Stanford j
Avenue in Berkeley, was the young- |
est 21 member and the only sopho
more in the group. He said, "We '
members of the 21 were a mighty j
lucky bunch of Stanford students— j
jit was just our good fortune to be j
at the right place at the right time
j with the right equipment for the !
job."
"I have seen dry years in Stanford
football history as well as California
history but I believe our famine is
coming to an end this Nov. 19."
Taylor is an engineer with the
California Research Corp. in Rich
mond, married, has two boys and a j
girl and says his interest in Stanford \
sports is as great today as it ever j
was.
"HIGH POINT"
James Trimingham, mayor of j
Pleasanton, Calif., for four years, j
calls the Axe recovery "the high j
point of my college career." He 1
called the 21 "average loyal Stanford !

j men, who would rather play a rous
j ing game of touch tackle than attend
i an extracurricular discussion on a
| technical subject."
j "Probably another important fac
| tor in the decision to make the try
! was that none of our group were
j first-team athletes on a varsity team,
I but we were all athletes at heart.
This was a chance to do something
! for the glory of Stanford, just as the
: football and other teams did.
"Right after the theft we were as
I happy as our football team was after
beating USC this season. And don't
i think we aren't happy about that
either."
"After the theft," Trimingham said,
! "I got so far behind in my studies
| that at the end of the term I had
I mostly incompletes."
He said that making the Axe a
permanent trophy was wise. "Stu
dents would probably now use an
atomic bomb instead of our tear gas
bomb."
Trimingham has a son at Stan
! ford. Robert, living in Wilbur Hall.
| Trimingham Sr. has a season ticket
j every year for football and never
: misses a Big Game, he says.
! "POOR CAL"
Gerald Bettman said. "I certainly
j hope that we recover the Axe this
year. It was the year we stole the
! Axe that the call "Poor Cal" started

and I'd certainly like to chant that
one again. I don't care how large the
score is, as long as we're on the long
end.
"I believe that the Axe is serving
its best purpose as a Big Game tro
phy. Everyone knows that it was
originally Stanford's Axe and that it
was recovered. We can afford to be
generous with it."
Bettman now teaches school in Los
Molinos, Calif. His step-on, Charles
Cunningham, was graduated from
Stanford in 1951. Another son, Ger
ald Jr., is now a Stanford freshman.
Bettman hopes to send his youngest
son to Stanford soon.
Glenford Brunson, who also at
tended business school at Stanford,
is currently with the California Stale
Department of Finance.
Other 21 members couldn't be
reached and two, Raymond Walsh
and Gordon Snodgrass, are deceased.
So there's the 25th anniversary
story of some of the 21 Stanford men
who caused the Daily Californian to
bitterly moan one morning back in
1930: .
"Hate Stanford! Catch the eu
phony of that sentence, notice its
essential accuracy! Hate Stanford!
Repeat it over and over in your
mind; formulate it with your lips!
Hate Stanford!"
Things don't seem to have changed
in 25 years.

baseball squad, makes him feel ;
prouder and binds him closer to
Stanford.
"Chuck Taylor has done an out- |
standing job of coaching and I agree I
that 'This is the Year'."
He's now principal of Sequoia I
Junior High School in Fresno and j
notes, "My students know nothing j
of my past history as a kleptoma-
niac."
Miller is married and has two j
children. He frequently visits the j
i Stanford campus.
YOUNGEST MEMBER
Robson Taylor, who now lives ;
! at the unlikely address of Stanford j
Avenue in Berkeley, was the young- |
est 21 member and the only sopho
more in the group. He said, "We '
members of the 21 were a mighty j
lucky bunch of Stanford students— j
jit was just our good fortune to be j
at the right place at the right time
j with the right equipment for the !
job."
"I have seen dry years in Stanford
football history as well as California
history but I believe our famine is
coming to an end this Nov. 19."
Taylor is an engineer with the
California Research Corp. in Rich
mond, married, has two boys and a j
girl and says his interest in Stanford \
sports is as great today as it ever j
was.
"HIGH POINT"
James Trimingham, mayor of j
Pleasanton, Calif., for four years, j
calls the Axe recovery "the high j
point of my college career." He 1
called the 21 "average loyal Stanford !

j men, who would rather play a rous
j ing game of touch tackle than attend
i an extracurricular discussion on a
| technical subject."
j "Probably another important fac
| tor in the decision to make the try
! was that none of our group were
j first-team athletes on a varsity team,
I but we were all athletes at heart.
This was a chance to do something
! for the glory of Stanford, just as the
: football and other teams did.
"Right after the theft we were as
I happy as our football team was after
beating USC this season. And don't
i think we aren't happy about that
either."
"After the theft," Trimingham said,
! "I got so far behind in my studies
| that at the end of the term I had
I mostly incompletes."
He said that making the Axe a
permanent trophy was wise. "Stu
dents would probably now use an
atomic bomb instead of our tear gas
bomb."
Trimingham has a son at Stan
! ford. Robert, living in Wilbur Hall.
| Trimingham Sr. has a season ticket
j every year for football and never
: misses a Big Game, he says.
! "POOR CAL"
Gerald Bettman said. "I certainly
j hope that we recover the Axe this
year. It was the year we stole the
! Axe that the call "Poor Cal" started

and I'd certainly like to chant that
one again. I don't care how large the
score is, as long as we're on the long
end.
"I believe that the Axe is serving
its best purpose as a Big Game tro
phy. Everyone knows that it was
originally Stanford's Axe and that it
was recovered. We can afford to be
generous with it."
Bettman now teaches school in Los
Molinos, Calif. His step-on, Charles
Cunningham, was graduated from
Stanford in 1951. Another son, Ger
ald Jr., is now a Stanford freshman.
Bettman hopes to send his youngest
son to Stanford soon.
Glenford Brunson, who also at
tended business school at Stanford,
is currently with the California Stale
Department of Finance.
Other 21 members couldn't be
reached and two, Raymond Walsh
and Gordon Snodgrass, are deceased.
So there's the 25th anniversary
story of some of the 21 Stanford men
who caused the Daily Californian to
bitterly moan one morning back in
1930: .
"Hate Stanford! Catch the eu
phony of that sentence, notice its
essential accuracy! Hate Stanford!
Repeat it over and over in your
mind; formulate it with your lips!
Hate Stanford!"
Things don't seem to have changed
in 25 years.


THE IMMORTAL 21 DEPOSITING THE AXE IN A PALO ALTO BANK


GEORGE LIKENS


GERALD BETTMAN


ARTHUR MiILER
This year marks the silver anniversary of the legendary ex
ploits of the Immortal 21.
Right after the Axe recovery in 1930 they were the toast of the
campus. They were wined and dined, all were given a block S.
Even on their University record cards today one can see under
'"Honors" — "Recovery of the Axe"*

right along witli the Phi Beta Kappa
distinctions some earned.
Twenty-five years is a long time
and people change, perhaps even
"immortal" people, so The Daily has
contacted some of the Immortal 21
to see how the years since the re
covery have treated them, to see if
the old Stanford spirit is still there.
Robert Gordon says in looking
back, ". . . we did I't need much per
suading about a chance to embar
rass those Berkeley bums," but that
he didn't think anyone really ex
pected the project to be a success.
"If an old evil is to be righted,
you just have to keep swinging at
it—so in 1930 we took our turn de
termined to do the best we could."
"The Axe in Berkeley was a chal
lenge which we accepted," he says.
PERMANENT TROPHY
On making the Axe a permanent
trophy (which it hadn't been until
after the 21 had captured it) he said,
"We should probably congratulate
ourselves that our Stanford adminis
tration immediately took the oppor
tunity to make a decision which for
over 30 years previously, the UC
administration had lacked the forti
tude or good sense to make.
"The decision on Stanford's part
was both generous and practical. I
must admit at the time we all felt
very sad over this decision."
Back in those days students were
much opposed to making the Axe a
permanent trophy, feeling as a front
page editorial in a 1930 Daily said,
"The Axe is not and never was a
trophy to be passed from hand to
hand . . . the Axe and Stanford are
inalienable."
Gordon is currently on the mathe
matics faculty of California State
Polytechnic College in San Luis
Obispo, is married and has a two
year-old son.
Donald Kropp, who supervised the
recovery, says that even now "the
condition of my ulcers is in direct
relation to the Stanford success on
the field." and that he expects "to
be completely recovered from any
intestinal disturbance conje tomor
row."
Kropp is presently a trial lawyer
in San Francisco, and a life mem
ber of the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion.
George B. Likens, now assistant
chief attorney for the Veterans' Ad
ministration in San Francisco, says
he's "somewhat startled at the ripe
old age of 45 to be considered a leg
end."
"ROWDY. AT TIMES"
On the forming of the plan Likens
noted. "Our group for the most part
consisted of residents at the long
departed Sequoia Hall." It was a
close-knit and "rowdy, at times,'
family, he said.
Likens is married and noted, "Like
all good Stanford men, I took for a
bride other than one of the then
chosen 500. My wife, Florence,

comes from a school in Southern
California related in some fashion to
the Bears, whose name I haven't
mentioned for several years—maybe
next year though."
"You ask if I still follow Stanford
ford sports. Let's put it this way.
My boss, Joe Brodie, is the uncle of
John Brodie—you know darned well
I follow sports."
NOT A THEFT
When Robert Loofbourow, far
away in Minneapolis, was asked,
"Does the event still seem exciting,
do you still remember it?" he an
swered with an emphatic, "Of
course."
He stressed that his group did not
"steal" the Axe, that California stole
it and that the 21 "recovered it."
Loofbourow is a consulting min
ing engineer, married and has four
children. Two'of his offspring were
graduated from the University of
Minnesota. His wife, Melba Colm, is
a 1929 Stanford graduate.
Arthur L. Miller recalls that re
covery attempts were "traditional"
but that the 21's plan was to avoid
the use of force which had been
characteristic of prior attempts.
"The idea of failure or the factor j
of punishment from the adminis- j
tration, frankly, never entered our i
heads. We thought plenty, however, I
of what would happen to us if caught
by Cal students."
CLOSE BIND
He says the adventure, like that of
being on the 1931 championship j
baseball squad, makes him feel ;
prouder and binds him closer to
Stanford.
"Chuck Taylor has done an out- |
standing job of coaching and I agree I
that 'This is the Year'."
He's now principal of Sequoia I

notes, "My students know nothing j
of my past history as a kleptoma-

Even on their University record cards today one can see under
'"Honors" — "Recovery of the Axe"*

right along witli the Phi Beta Kappa
distinctions some earned.
Twenty-five years is a long time
and people change, perhaps even
"immortal" people, so The Daily has
contacted some of the Immortal 21
to see how the years since the re
covery have treated them, to see if
the old Stanford spirit is still there.
Robert Gordon says in looking
back, ". . . we did I't need much per
suading about a chance to embar
rass those Berkeley bums," but that
he didn't think anyone really ex
pected the project to be a success.
"If an old evil is to be righted,
you just have to keep swinging at
it—so in 1930 we took our turn de
termined to do the best we could."
"The Axe in Berkeley was a chal
lenge which we accepted," he says.
PERMANENT TROPHY
On making the Axe a permanent
trophy (which it hadn't been until
after the 21 had captured it) he said,
"We should probably congratulate
ourselves that our Stanford adminis
tration immediately took the oppor
tunity to make a decision which for
over 30 years previously, the UC
administration had lacked the forti
tude or good sense to make.
"The decision on Stanford's part
was both generous and practical. I
must admit at the time we all felt
very sad over this decision."
Back in those days students were
much opposed to making the Axe a
permanent trophy, feeling as a front
page editorial in a 1930 Daily said,
"The Axe is not and never was a
trophy to be passed from hand to
hand . . . the Axe and Stanford are
inalienable."
Gordon is currently on the mathe
matics faculty of California State
Polytechnic College in San Luis
Obispo, is married and has a two
year-old son.
Donald Kropp, who supervised the
recovery, says that even now "the
condition of my ulcers is in direct
relation to the Stanford success on
the field." and that he expects "to
be completely recovered from any
intestinal disturbance conje tomor
row."
Kropp is presently a trial lawyer
in San Francisco, and a life mem
ber of the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion.
George B. Likens, now assistant
chief attorney for the Veterans' Ad
ministration in San Francisco, says
he's "somewhat startled at the ripe
old age of 45 to be considered a leg
end."
"ROWDY. AT TIMES"
On the forming of the plan Likens
noted. "Our group for the most part
consisted of residents at the long
departed Sequoia Hall." It was a
close-knit and "rowdy, at times,'
family, he said.
Likens is married and noted, "Like
all good Stanford men, I took for a
bride other than one of the then
chosen 500. My wife, Florence,

comes from a school in Southern
California related in some fashion to
the Bears, whose name I haven't
mentioned for several years—maybe
next year though."
"You ask if I still follow Stanford
ford sports. Let's put it this way.
My boss, Joe Brodie, is the uncle of
John Brodie—you know darned well
I follow sports."
NOT A THEFT
When Robert Loofbourow, far
away in Minneapolis, was asked,
"Does the event still seem exciting,
do you still remember it?" he an
swered with an emphatic, "Of
course."
He stressed that his group did not
"steal" the Axe, that California stole
it and that the 21 "recovered it."
Loofbourow is a consulting min
ing engineer, married and has four
children. Two'of his offspring were
graduated from the University of
Minnesota. His wife, Melba Colm, is
a 1929 Stanford graduate.
Arthur L. Miller recalls that re
covery attempts were "traditional"
but that the 21's plan was to avoid
the use of force which had been
characteristic of prior attempts.
"The idea of failure or the factor j
of punishment from the adminis- j
tration, frankly, never entered our i
heads. We thought plenty, however, I
of what would happen to us if caught
by Cal students."
CLOSE BIND
He says the adventure, like that of
being on the 1931 championship j
baseball squad, makes him feel ;
prouder and binds him closer to
Stanford.
"Chuck Taylor has done an out- |
standing job of coaching and I agree I
that 'This is the Year'."
He's now principal of Sequoia I
Junior High School in Fresno and j
notes, "My students know nothing j
of my past history as a kleptoma-
niac."
Miller is married and has two j
children. He frequently visits the j
i Stanford campus.
YOUNGEST MEMBER
Robson Taylor, who now lives ;
! at the unlikely address of Stanford j
Avenue in Berkeley, was the young- |
est 21 member and the only sopho
more in the group. He said, "We '
members of the 21 were a mighty j
lucky bunch of Stanford students— j
jit was just our good fortune to be j
at the right place at the right time
j with the right equipment for the !
job."
"I have seen dry years in Stanford
football history as well as California
history but I believe our famine is
coming to an end this Nov. 19."
Taylor is an engineer with the
California Research Corp. in Rich
mond, married, has two boys and a j
girl and says his interest in Stanford \
sports is as great today as it ever j
was.
"HIGH POINT"
James Trimingham, mayor of j
Pleasanton, Calif., for four years, j
calls the Axe recovery "the high j
point of my college career." He 1
called the 21 "average loyal Stanford !

j men, who would rather play a rous
j ing game of touch tackle than attend
i an extracurricular discussion on a
| technical subject."
j "Probably another important fac
| tor in the decision to make the try
! was that none of our group were
j first-team athletes on a varsity team,
I but we were all athletes at heart.
This was a chance to do something
! for the glory of Stanford, just as the
: football and other teams did.
"Right after the theft we were as
I happy as our football team was after
beating USC this season. And don't
i think we aren't happy about that
either."
"After the theft," Trimingham said,
! "I got so far behind in my studies
| that at the end of the term I had
I mostly incompletes."
He said that making the Axe a
permanent trophy was wise. "Stu
dents would probably now use an
atomic bomb instead of our tear gas
bomb."
Trimingham has a son at Stan
! ford. Robert, living in Wilbur Hall.
| Trimingham Sr. has a season ticket
j every year for football and never
: misses a Big Game, he says.
! "POOR CAL"
Gerald Bettman said. "I certainly
j hope that we recover the Axe this
year. It was the year we stole the
! Axe that the call "Poor Cal" started

and I'd certainly like to chant that
one again. I don't care how large the
score is, as long as we're on the long
end.
"I believe that the Axe is serving
its best purpose as a Big Game tro
phy. Everyone knows that it was
originally Stanford's Axe and that it
was recovered. We can afford to be
generous with it."
Bettman now teaches school in Los
Molinos, Calif. His step-on, Charles
Cunningham, was graduated from
Stanford in 1951. Another son, Ger
ald Jr., is now a Stanford freshman.
Bettman hopes to send his youngest
son to Stanford soon.
Glenford Brunson, who also at
tended business school at Stanford,
is currently with the California Stale
Department of Finance.
Other 21 members couldn't be
reached and two, Raymond Walsh
and Gordon Snodgrass, are deceased.
So there's the 25th anniversary
story of some of the 21 Stanford men
who caused the Daily Californian to
bitterly moan one morning back in
1930: .
"Hate Stanford! Catch the eu
phony of that sentence, notice its
essential accuracy! Hate Stanford!
Repeat it over and over in your
mind; formulate it with your lips!
Hate Stanford!"
Things don't seem to have changed
in 25 years.
