# Ruetz Chooses Stanford On Attack, Speed Depth

"We have more speed, depth and a more varied attack," stated
assistant coach Joe Ruetz who has been scouting California for
Card mentor Chuck Taylor. This was Ruetz' basis for choosing
Stanford to win the Big Game tomorrow.
"Cal has a good first unit, especially in the line," Ruetz ex-

plained. The former Ail-American
guard at Notre Dame said that the
Bear reserves leave much to be de
sired, however.
Besides depth, Cal lacks backfleld
peed and size, according to Ruetz.
The Indian assistant, who saw the
Bears against both Washington and
Oregon State, states he has a great
deal of respect for Cal's first unit
on offense.
"They have a real good passer in
Hugh Maguire and very fine receiv
ers in Jim Carmichael, Steve Dimeff,
Herb Jackson and Norm Becker,"
Ruetz pointed out.
GRANGER lIEST
"Ted Granger is their best running
back," Ruetz declared. He explained
that the 175-pound halfback is dan
gerous on draw plays, having run 66
yards for a touchdown on one
against Oregon State.
Tackle Ron Wheatcroft and guards
Don Gilkey and Carlos Fackrell are
very fine linemen, according to
Ruetz. "Wheatcroft is going to be
an outstanding tackle next year,
possibly All-Coast." The big tackle
is only a sophomore.
GOOD DEFENSE
In the backfield, Granger and
quarterbacks Maguire and Ralph
Hoffman are outstanding defensive
players, Ruetz commented. The
hortness of Cal's second line half
backs, 5-5 Nat Brazil! and 5-4 Donn

Smith, hinders the Bear pass de
fense, however.
The Indian coach declared that he
expects Waldorf to throw a variety
of defenses at the Cards. Ruetz feels
that the Bears will utilize five and
six man lines tomorrow on defense.
FOUL UP ATTACK
"They will probably try to foul up
our attack up the middle and our
long passing game," Ruetz predicted.
That would leave the Bear defense
open for wide running and short
passing.
Ruetz also expects the California
halfbacks to play our short receivers
very aggressively and the Bear line
backers to shoot the gaps in order
to put more pressure on the Card
passers.
On defense, Ruetz explained that
Stanford must stop the Cal roll-out
pass attack. This system, one of Wal
dorf's favorites, can be very impres
sive when run by a quarterback
such as Bob Celeri or Paul Larson,
two Bear stars of the Waldorf-era.
RELY ON PASSING
"They'll have to rely on passing
to beat us," Ruetz said.
The former St. Marys head coach
declared that a light rain would have
little effect on the game.
"If a real downpour should come,
the game will probably turn into a
battle of breaks, though," he stated.
