Beppo Schultz, boulevardier, raconteur, connoisseur, sports
man, bon vivant, hail fellow well met —in short, typical Ameri
can college man - smokes today's new Philip Morris Cigarettes.
"Why do you smoke today's new Philip Morris Cigarettes,
hey?" a friend recently asked Beppo Schultz.
"I smoke today's new Philip Morris Cigarettes," replied
Beppo, looking up from his 2.9 litre L-head Hotchkiss drive
double overhead camshaft British sports car, "because they
are neiv."
"New?" said the friend. "What do you mean-new?"
"I mean modern —up-to-date —designed for today's easier,
breezier living," said Beppo.
"Like this 2.9 litre L-head Hotchkiss drive double overhead
camshaft British sports car?" asked the friend.
"Exactly," said Beppof
"She's a beauty," said the friend, looking admiringly at the
car. "How long have you had her?"

"It's a male," said Beppo.
"Sorry," said the friend. "How long have you had him?"
"About a year," said Beppo.
"Have you done a lot of work on him?" asked the friend.
"Oh, have I not!" cried Beppo. "I have replaced the pushrods
and rockers with a Rootes-type supercharger. 1 have replaced
the torque with a synchromesh. I have replaced the tachometer
with a double side draft carburetor."
"Gracious!" exclaimed the friend.
"I have replaced the hood with a bonnet," said Beppo.
"Land o' Goshen!" exclaimed the friend.
"I have replaced the gasoline with petrol." said Beppo.
"Crim-a-nentlies!" said the friend.
"And I have put gloves in the glove compartment," said Beppo.
My, you have been the busy one!" said the friend. "You must
be exhausted."
"Maybe a trifle," said Beppo with a brave little smile.
"Do you know what 1 do when I'm tired?" asked the friend.
"Light a Philip Morris?" Beppo ventured.
"Oh, pshaw, you guessed!" said the friend, pouting.
"But it was easy!" cried Beppo, laughing silverly. "When
the eyelids droop and the musculature sags and the psyche is
depleted, what is more natural than to perk up with today's
Philip Morris in the red, white and gold package?"
"A bright new smoke in a bright new pack!" proclaimed the
friend, his young eyes glistening with tears.
"Changed to keep pace \fcith today's changing world!" de
clared Beppo, whirling his arms in concentric circles. "A gentler,
more relaxing cigarette for a sunnier age, an age of greater
leisure and broader vistas and more beckoning horizons!"
Now, tired but happy, Beppo and his friend lit Philip Morrises
and smoked for a time in deep, silent contentment. At length
the friend spoke. "Yes, sir," he said, "he certainly is a beauty."
"You mean my 2.9 litre L-head Hotchkiss drive double over
head camshaft British sports car?" asked Beppo.
"Yes," said the friend. "How fast will he go?"
'Well, I don't rightly know," said Beppo. "I can't find the
star ter. ©Mm Bbiilnain, 1955
