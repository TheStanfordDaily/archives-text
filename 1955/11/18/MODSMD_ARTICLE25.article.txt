# Pappy Suffering Worst Season Since Taking Up Reins at Cal
## 
### JIM BAKER 
Two years ago, Pappy Waldorf had great hopes for his 1955
California varsity gridders. Ronnie Knox had just completed a
great season with the Cal frosh, and was slated to lead the Cal
varsity to great heights.
But Ronnie transferred to UCLA, and Pappy was left without a'

quarterback for his 1955 gridders.
This fact, along with the injury
factor which has plagued the Bears
this season, partly accounts for the
Blue and Gold's worst season since
194G.
On the injury side, it seems as if
the Boars have had every injury
known to a football team. At one
time, four men were out with bad
knees.

As they go into Big Game, the
Bears carry a won-lost record of
two-six-one, a fact which prompted
Cal rooters to hang Pappy in effigy
earlier in the season.
In spite of the poor team record
shown by the Bears, several indi
vidual players have stood out for
Waldorf this year.
Tackle Ron Wheatcroft, guard
Carlos Fackrell, punter Don Gilkey
and end Jim Carmichael have all
been praised by rival coaches for
their fine play.
On the whole, the team is improv
| ing every game, as can be .seen by
j their upset win over Washington
two weeks ago, and their "moral"
| victory over Oregon Stats last week
end. The Bears had the edge in sta
tistics over the Beavers, but couldn't
seem to get that extra touchdown.
After the OSC tilt, Waldorf said
that he was pleased with the way
the team was improving and that
Cal would finally be in good physical
conditibn for the Big Game.


PAPPY TAKES GASâ€”After Cal lost to Oregon, 21-0, an effigy
of coach "Pappy" Waldorf was found swinging from Sather
Gate with a tombstone underneath. Police officer Richard Fasz
holz (above) discovered the "body."
