# UCLA, MSC, Michigan Fight For Bowl Bid
## 
### JOHN MOE 
Two conference races come
to a roaring finish this Saturday
as the Big Ten and PCC princi- !
pals battle it out for the much- j
coveted Rose Bowl bid.
Out here on the coast, the Uclans
look to be the choice with a 5 and 0
record in conference play. Right
behind them, breathing down their
necks, are the Oregon Staters with
a 5 and 1 mark.
In the midwest, Ohio State leads
the race with a 5-0 record, but the
Buckeyes are ineligible this year.
Either Michigan or Michigan State
could make the trip to Pasadena,
since both teams are deadlocked at
5 wins and a loss apiece.
OSC POSSIBILITY
"If" is still the big word in both
races. If USC should beat the Bruins
this Saturday, and if Oregon State
downs Oregon, then the State squad
could be the team reDresenting' the
FCC on New Year's Day.
UCLA has been on the downgrade
in its last few games even though it
hasn't been knocked from the win
ning trail. With a stronger line and
a better all-around attack, however,
the Bruins are still favored.
ONE GAME
One game decides who will repre
sent the Big Ten. That is the Michi
gan vs. Ohio State contest. Michigan
Slate, the other possibility, can only
sit by and hope about the outcome
of this one as it draws a bye in con
ference play taking on Marquette.
Hopalong Cassady and company
could eliminate Michigan from the
race if they defeat the Wolverines.
The experts pick this one as a toss
up; so ali eyes will be on the two
powerhouses this Saturday.
