No. Name Wt. Ht. Pos. Hf. Wt. NAME No.
84 STEWART 194 6-3 LER 6-0 210 VALLOTTON 80
Lanky John led the nation last year in yards gained pass receiving and cur
rently leads the conference. On a good day, Stewart, who is playing his last Stan
ford game, can make any passer look good, but is only fair on defense.
Vallotton, a converted 'halfback, has speed and desire to go along with his
experience. A good pass catcher, ho could get hot and give the Card secondary a
bad time.
75 MARSHALL 210 6-4 LTR 6-2 210 WHEATCROFT 79
A senior, Marshall has finally shaken off his injury jinx and played outstanding
ball this year. He i.s the top blocker on the team. He showed his excellent defen
sive abilities against the Ohio State Buckeyes and Red Sanders' UCLA Bruins.
He will be co-captain of the Indians tomorrow.
Wheatcrolt was shifted over to tackle from his end position, and though in
experienced, has received rave notices for his work. Still, the Bears miss Harry
Ghilarducci, who stood out last year; thus the Tribe rates higher at this position.
69 MOSICH 208 6-0 LCR 6-0 200 FACKRELL 69
Mosich will provide Indian runners with good blocking up front tomorrow as
he has all season. The stocky, rugged senior combines with Joe Long and Donn
Carswell to form the solid center of the Card line.
Fackrell is a newcomer on Waldorf's squad. He is rather inexperienced but
aggressive. He took over Nick Poppin's spot when the latter got hurt.
58 LONC 215 6-2 C 6-3 200 MITCHELL *50
Long has coma a long way this year and has established himself as one of the
best centers on the coast. He recovered a fumble which led to Stanford's lone
touchdown in the Washington game, and he was all over the field last week against
Oregon.
Mitchell has been the number one man at this position all season lor the Bears
and has come along well.'Mitchell .stood out defensively against UCLA and Wash
ington and will cau.-e problems for Card runnels.
64 CARSWELL 199 6-0 RCL 6-3 225 CILKEY 61
CarsweH's hustle has provided the necessary spark in the Indian line on several
occasions this year. He had standout days a'.ainst USC and San Jose State. Cars
well should give Bear passers a busy alternoon with his aggressive rushing, al
though he is best on offense.
Gilkey replaces big Charley Martucci at left guard and has led Waldorf's line
this season. He averaged over 40 yards per punt in nine attempts against UCLA
anrl is rugged on defense.
79 WICCIN 223 6-3 RTL 6-2 225 OLIVER 72
Wiggin is considered the toughest and most capable Card lineman this year
and has gained the.praise of all opposing coaches, especially Washington's Johnny
Cherberg. Southern Cal's Jess Hill and San Jose's Bob Bronzan. He is not too
strong a blocker, however.
A senior. Oliver is back for his third Big Game and has been a consistent per
former for Waldorf's squad. Oliver is the largest lineman on the team, but he is
being pushed for the starting assignment by Walt Senior, another converted end.

88 BEATIE 185 6-2 REL 6-2 210 CARMICHAEL 89
Beatie has shown tremendous improvement this year on both offense and de
fense. He stood out offensively against San Jose and UCLA, but his defense is not
up to par.
Carmichael, captain of the Bears, is a fine pass receiver and a crisp downfield
blocker. He was third nationally in passes received. He scored the Bears' only
touchdown against USC this season.
12 BRODIE 185 6-1 QB 5-9 169 MACUIRE 20
Brodic has improved with each contest, coming into his own against UCLA and
hitting his peak against USC and Oregon. The hard-throwing quartet back is amaz
ingly accurate and now has the experience to make him one of the most dangerous
backs in the country. He makes the Tribe go.
Maguire is back for his last collegiate effort, and, although not in Paul Lar
son's class, or Brodie's, he i.s a capable signal-caller and an adequate passer.
32 CAMERm 186 6-1 LHR 5-9 168 WILSON 44
Camera, a junior, has developed into a real threat offensively with five touch
downs on pass receptions. He also has turned in some good defensive work in the
Indians' last three games but is considered veiy weak against passes. He is a
sound, steady, reliable ball player.
Wilson could break up the ball game with his sp?ed and deceptiveness. With
little Donnie Smith threatening lo take his job away, Wilson has the pressure on
him to turn in a good pf>rfot manee.
44 YOUNC 174 5-11 RHL 5-11 175 CRANGER 47
Young surprised everyone with his exceptional improvement this year. Gain
ing a starting berth when Ernie Dorn was lost for the season, Young has made the
most of it by playing heads-up ball and utilizing his deceptive, although slow,
running style for several long gainers. He was coming up fast and effectively on
defense last week.
Although this is his third year of varsity ball, Granger will be getting.his first
Big Game starting assignmentâ€”if he starts. He is capable ol the long gainer, but
poor blocking has restricted his effectiveness.
30 TARR 190 5-11 FB 5-11 195 DIMEFF 35
Co-captain Tarr is the Cards' reliable, work-horse ball carrier. He currently
ranks second in the conference rushing statistics and is Stanford's leading scorer.
He's tough to stop, but weak on defense.
Dimeff is another bruising runner and a good blocker, too. He is a good pass
receiver and Cal's most versatile backfield man. He's Cal's best man for a crucial
