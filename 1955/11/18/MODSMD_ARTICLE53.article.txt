# Vow Boys Store Last Stadium Victory-in '35
## Grayson, Coffis, Moscrip Lead Indians In 13-0 Scalping on Way to Rose Bow! 
### BILL NICHOLS 
On Nov. 23, 1935, The Stanford Daily came out with an extra.
It was Saturday night and once-beaten Stanford had knocked off
unbeaten California, 13-0, to win a Rose Bowl bid.
Cardinal supporters were jubilant, but chances are, that if they
could have known that 20 years later, in 1955, Stanford still would
not have won another Big Game at Palo Alto, their enthusiasm
would have been dimmed.
Both Cal and Stanford, had very strong teams that year. Stan
ford's famed Vow Boys v/ere in their senior year, v/hile at Berke-

ley the first members of the
"Thunder Team" were getting
a taste of varsity football.
Stanford had gone to the Rose
Bowl in 1933 and 1934, losing
to Columbia and Alabama, and
was anxious to get one more
crack at Pasadena.
California was playing under
a new coach and had rolled
through nine straight games
without defeat. Only two teams
had managed to score on the
Blue and Gold. USC blocked a
Cal punt and fell upon it in the
end zone as the Eears won, 21-7;
and UCLA garnered a safety in
a 14-2 loss.
Thus, until the Stanford game,
nobody had scored on offense
against the Bears. Cal had three
close games, winning 6-0 over

Whither, Oregon and Santa Clara. The rest had been easy, in
cluding a surprising 14-0 win over Washington.
Stanford's season going into the Big Game was almost as bril
liant. The only blot was a 7-6 loss to UCLA. The only other team
to score on the Cards was Santa Claxa. But Tiny Thornhill's boys
won that one, 9-3.
Come game time, Stanford was a lukewarm favorile. On the
basis of comparative scores, Cal had the edge, but Stanford had
the experience.
Stanford won the toss and elected to kick off. Cal ran one play
and then punted. Jimmy Coffis fumbled the kick and the Bears
recovered on the Cardinal 35. California drove all the way to the
six where Flank Sparks, Cal's right end, missed a field goal.
Stanford took the ball on her own 20 and drove 80 yards in 13
plays. Stanford's Ail-American Fullback Bob Grayson opened
the drive with a 25-yard burst over tackle. Two Grayson passes
and some hard runn'ng by Bones Hamilton and Coffis moved
the pigskin to the California one, where Grayson bulled his way
over on fourth down.
A moment after the kickcff, Card center Wes Muller fell on a
Bear fumble giving Stanford the ball on the UC 29. This time it
took the Indians only five plays to score.
The big gainer v/as a pass frojn Grayson to Coffis who lateraled
to Bill Paulman who ran to the Bear 13. Two plays later Coffis
went nine yards for the score, but this time Moscrip's kick was
bad and the score read 13-0 for Stanford.
