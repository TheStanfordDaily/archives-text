# IT'S BEEN 9 LONG YEARS
## Cards Won Last Big Game In 1946, by 25-6 Score Belf and Anderson Paced Indian Attack As Stanford Triumphed in Dull Contest 
### BILL NICHOLS 
In 1946 Stanford rc'urned to the gridiron wars after a thr<
year layoff and trounced California, 25-6. From the "way Big
Games have been going, Stanford should have stayed re: 1.
The Tribe hasn't won since.
Stanford had a better than average team that year consice:-
ing the sguad had little experience because cf the war. 1 h
Indians had four v/ins, three

losses and a tia going into the
Big Game.
Meanwhile, Cal had been go
ing through one of its worst
seasons. The Bears had won two
out of eight before their Nov. 23
date with the Cards.
Stanford opened the season
with easy victories over Idaho
and U3F, before bov/ing to Rose
Bowl bound UCLA, 26-6. The
Cards took Santa Clara into
camp, 33-27, and then lost to
T JSC by a familiar-sounding 28-
20 margin.
In the rain at Corvaliis, Stan
ford and Oregon State battled
to a G-0 tie; then the Cards came
home to drop a 15-21 decision to

Washington and nip WSC, 27-26. Cal had beaten only St. Mr ) •
and WSC in a dismal season. But St. Mary's had Herman Wt
meyer, and WSC had lost, 47-17.
Stanford had Lloyd Merriman (later of baseball fame) running
from fullback and George Quist at half. These two did most < ;
the ball - carrying for the Indians while lgite - season discove
Ainslee Bell did the passing.
And pass he did come the Big Game.
Memorial Stadium in Eerkeley was packed. Stanford w. . i
seven-point choice. And it didn't take the Indians long to cJ-n:
onstrate why.
Cal fumbled on its own 22, and on the next play Quist br
loose to the Bear two-yard stripe where he was belted out c!
bounds.
Three plays made a yard. Then Bob Anderson swept w.
around end for the score and Marty Feldman converted.
Early in the second period Stanford started driving aq in.
Merriman was hurt during the drive, but Bell started pitel ■■;
to make up for the loss of ihe fullback. He threw once to Way •
Erickson for 27 yards and then again for six points.
Stanford scored again before the end of the half. Marty
derson intercepted a pass and carried it to the Bear seven. A
Bell-to-Brown pass made it 19-0.
Stanford's final score came in the third period. Anderson i
the final 27 yards.
Although Cal scored in the closing minutes to make the lin '
count 25-6, Cal rooters spent the latter part of the game ripp.' ]

The following year Pappy Waldorf reported to Berkeley </-i a
Cal hasn't lost a Big Game since.


LAST TO WlN—The 1946 Stanford gridders, pictured above,
were the last Indian team to bring home a victory in the Big
Game. Coach Marchie Schwartz's boys went up to Berkeley
with a 5-3-1 record and took the Bears, 25-6. Halfback Bob
Anderson (17), quarterback Ainslee Bell (26) and fullback Lloyd
Merriman (5) starred in the game. Anchoring the Stanford line

were tackle Fred Boensch (29), guard Bill Hachten (16) and guard
Dick Madigan (50). The Indians ran up a 19 0 halftime lead and
coasted in ahead of Cal. The Big Game of 1946 was the last
for California before the arrival of Lynn "Pappy" Waldorf who
has now gone eight straight years without losing to Stanford
in the Big Game.

LAST TO WlN—The 1946 Stanford gridders, pictured above,
were the last Indian team to bring home a victory in the Big
Game. Coach Marchie Schwartz's boys went up to Berkeley
with a 5-3-1 record and took the Bears, 25-6. Halfback Bob
Anderson (17), quarterback Ainslee Bell (26) and fullback Lloyd
Merriman (5) starred in the game. Anchoring the Stanford line

were tackle Fred Boensch (29), guard Bill Hachten (16) and guard
Dick Madigan (50). The Indians ran up a 19 0 halftime lead and
coasted in ahead of Cal. The Big Game of 1946 was the last
for California before the arrival of Lynn "Pappy" Waldorf who
has now gone eight straight years without losing to Stanford
in the Big Game.

In 1946 Stanford rc'urned to the gridiron wars after a thr<
year layoff and trounced California, 25-6. From the "way Big
Games have been going, Stanford should have stayed re: 1.
The Tribe hasn't won since.
Stanford had a better than average team that year consice:-
ing the sguad had little experience because cf the war. 1 h
Indians had four v/ins, three

losses and a tia going into the
Big Game.
Meanwhile, Cal had been go
ing through one of its worst
seasons. The Bears had won two
out of eight before their Nov. 23
date with the Cards.
Stanford opened the season
with easy victories over Idaho
and U3F, before bov/ing to Rose
Bowl bound UCLA, 26-6. The
Cards took Santa Clara into
camp, 33-27, and then lost to
T JSC by a familiar-sounding 28-
20 margin.
In the rain at Corvaliis, Stan
ford and Oregon State battled
to a G-0 tie; then the Cards came
home to drop a 15-21 decision to

Washington and nip WSC, 27-26. Cal had beaten only St. Mr ) •
and WSC in a dismal season. But St. Mary's had Herman Wt
meyer, and WSC had lost, 47-17.
Stanford had Lloyd Merriman (later of baseball fame) running
from fullback and George Quist at half. These two did most < ;
the ball - carrying for the Indians while lgite - season discove
Ainslee Bell did the passing.
And pass he did come the Big Game.
Memorial Stadium in Eerkeley was packed. Stanford w. . i
seven-point choice. And it didn't take the Indians long to cJ-n:
onstrate why.
Cal fumbled on its own 22, and on the next play Quist br
loose to the Bear two-yard stripe where he was belted out c!
bounds.
Three plays made a yard. Then Bob Anderson swept w.
around end for the score and Marty Feldman converted.
Early in the second period Stanford started driving aq in.
Merriman was hurt during the drive, but Bell started pitel ■■;
to make up for the loss of ihe fullback. He threw once to Way •
Erickson for 27 yards and then again for six points.
Stanford scored again before the end of the half. Marty
derson intercepted a pass and carried it to the Bear seven. A
Bell-to-Brown pass made it 19-0.
Stanford's final score came in the third period. Anderson i
the final 27 yards.
Although Cal scored in the closing minutes to make the lin '
count 25-6, Cal rooters spent the latter part of the game ripp.' ]
up seats and chanting, "Fire Wickhorst."'
