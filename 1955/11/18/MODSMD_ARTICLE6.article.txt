# AS BILL LEISER SEES IT
## Worm's Turning Usually a Beaut 
### 
(San Francisco Chronicle Sports Kclitor Uil! I.riser, class <1 '21. was
(■(litur-in-chief of Volume 15!) of The Daily. lie has written the following
cclmiin especially for today's Big Game edition.)
With Stanford students of today I have one experience in common.
( ir football team never won a Big Game while 1 was en undergraduate,
ci.thc r. 1 even stayed on two years, and still didn't get a winner.
Hut. today's students have a brighter outlook. Going into this one they
l'.iv'e the better eleven and it should stuv that way.
Going into the Big Game in my senior year. '21, we had high hopes that
)■ nuined high as Ram Schlaudermann dumped Perky Sprott right at his
own goal with a beautiful dive-over-blocker tackle on the first play. r fhat
\va all. We were up against the "Wonder Team" in its second great year.

It wasn't too bad. Cnly 42-7. The
year before it was 38-9 and we did
n't make a good tackle.
Like most California and Stanford
men I am a sophomore when the Big
Game comes up. Have missed just
one in the last 35. Didn't quite get
into the old bleachers from a ticket
taker's job io .see Dink Templeton
kick that long goal when we almost
won that 14-10 affair in 1919. That
was the first after World War I, also
i the first after rugby. 1 didn't see last
| year's big effort. Was too sick even
to listen more than a minute at a
time. But I've seen my share.
Long ago I wrote, "Odds mean
, nothing. Records mean nothing. Es
timated strengths mean nothing.
There's no game like The Big Game
in which anything can happen and
usually does."
It's a bromide now but still true.
Ifs one of the few contests in the
' country that are always sold out no
matter if the teams are fighting for
first or last place. It's the only such

game in the West. I think our guys
were the first to introduce cap stunts and later card stunts and all the
Uc;ichi :- pageantry that is copied everywhere now.
We built the first big stadium in the West —for the Big Game. Without
lit,. i-Jig Game, how could Leland Cutier and his associates of '21 have dared
to construct a bow! to seat 60,000 fans for a football team that wasn't win
i.in * and didn't look as if it ever would win? Or attract customers?
When it was completed a not unfriendly observer wrote. "Stanford now
h:. the finest football plant in the West. It would be nice if Stanford had
:■ ft am to play in it."
5,000 Tickets Remain in Safe During Game
Save for the Big Game the Stadium couldn't have been attempted. The
first Big Game played in it drew 55.000, paid. One whole section in the end
was bare while patrons were tightly packed up against the aisles lining
. ither side. Somebody at Berkeley had placed 5000 tickets in a safe some
where, had forgotten about them. "All, tickets were sold out," but 5000
remained hidden until after the game, and 835,000 flew away.
Haven't seen a blank space in a Big Game stadium since.
Stanford having shown the way, California followed and built a stadium,
100. The worm first turned for Stanford (in modern football) in that sta
dium in '24 after we had gone five years without a victory or tie. As has
oi'ten been the case with the worm's turning, it was a beaut.
The late Andy Smith was still riding high at Gal. The late Pop Warner
was in bis first year at Stanford. Stanford had the great Ernie Nevers, but
he was in the stands with two broken ankles. Stanford had a great half
back, Norm Cleaveland, but he had been declared ineligible (mistakenly).
Odds were 3-1 against us. "No chance."
Murray Cuddeback got us two field goals in the first half. California
knocked our guys half-way up Tightwad Hill in the third quarter, and it
was "all over," 20-G. People were filing down the aisles when Cuddeback
sailed one to Ted Shipkey among an end zone full of Bears. Everyone was
waiting for the final gun when Ed Walker, who "couldn't paes." got another
to the hard-working Cuddeback who took it over the goal. Cuddeback
calmly kicked the point for 20-20 while fans unintentionally mauled each
other in the stadium and a number actually fainted in the hysteria of the
moment.
»Iter Tie Indians Didn't Lose to Cal Untii 1931
I have never known another Big Game to hit that peak. Maybe we're
not quite so grid-crazy these days. On the other hand, no Big Game under
dog ever came up so spectacularly against greater odds. With that one in
(he books, Stanford never lost one until Bill Ingram arrived at California
in 1031.
So if our gang can turn the worm tomorrow, it's likely to stay turned
for a while. It usually does.
Tomorrow our athletes are favored, and maybe that's against them.
Ms the worm has done its best turning, both ways, against odds. Cap
tains Chris Marshall and Bill Tarr better make doubly sure against any
self-assuredness that can show in reduce punch and give-away breaks.
We have a really good football team, even if it isn't the fastest in the
world. The '55 gang played the way the '24 Big Game gang played in beat
ing USC. A duplicate of that game would beat anybody.
Such hoys as Bill Tarr, Paul Wiggin, Chris Marshall, Tony Mosich, John
Stewart and—well, our whole first eleven and several seconds—are not just
good football players. At their best they're as good as any. anywhere.
And if John Brodie passes in the Big Game as he was passing the last
two times I saw him, we 11 expect him to go through the whole lf)5G season
acting like a Bobby Garrett at his tops. Nobody gets better than that.
L'.'t them win this one. and we'll believe the Indians have started a
conference victory string likely to go, with Brodie, through all of next
on. We won't have the power nor the depth the UCLA Bruins and
the USC Trojans will have, but it has been proved we can have what it
trtkes to beat 'em.
We aren't through this Big Game, yet! Remember, "anything can hap
pen." But there's no sense in letting it happen to us.
