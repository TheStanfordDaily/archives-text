# Rough, Tough Cal Eleven
## H.C. Hoover Organized First Big Game Clash; Brawny Berkeleyites Lost St. Contest 
### DICK NICHOLS 
Football players v/ere a rough, tough and mean lei back in 1891,
and the roughest, toughest and meanest on the Pacific Coast
played their football for the University of California.
Cal was so tough, in fact, that few teams were willing to meet

j the Golden Bear on the gridiron. 4
In the fall of 1891, the brawny
| boys from Berkeley were forced to
• cast about the Bay Region in search
i of some fresh, unsuspecting oppo
nents to keep their bulging muscles 1
in condition. They had heard of the ;
new school across the Bay, Stanford
by name, so just for laughs they dis
patchsd a challenge to the boys down I
on the Farm.
The challenge was read publicly I
in Encina Hall and quickly became
the number one topic of conversa- j
| tion on the campus. After much de- ;
j liberation, it was finally decided that 1
Stanford would accept the challenge.
1 The date for the first not-so-big Big
i Game was set for March 4, 1892.
LONG DELAY
There was a good reason for the
I long delay between the acceptance
of the challenge and the playing .of
the game—Stanford didn't have a
football team in 1891.
However, most of the boys had
heard of the game of football; a few
j of them had even played it, and
every one of the lads posesssed an
ample supply of what has since come
to be known as the ' Stanford fight
j ing spirit."
There was no organization to this
spirit—all was chaos. An organizer
wr.:; needed quickly if there wa•>
going to bo a first Big Game.
Students cho£? a business-minded |
>ophomore for the job—Herbert C.
Hoover. He went al his work with a
i vengence, gambling on the success
| of a game between well-known Cal- 1
ifornia and his own obscure Stan
ford.
A captain was chosen in the per
son of J. R. Whittemore.
Scene of the first Big Game was j
the Sired bareball grounds
| in San Francisco.
HOOVERS GAMBLE
The Indians were clad in bright
cardinal jerseys, thanks to Hoover's i
business gamble of ordering them all
on credit, hoping for a crowd. He
ordered 5000 tickets printed.
Young Hoover's gamble paid off—
and how. After all the tickets had
been sold people still swarmed the <
booth. Frantically Hoover sent his
assistants scurrying around the

neighborhood for pot-;, pans, bath
tubs—anything to hold money.
Finally they were ready for the
kick oft' of the first Biy Game, with
California favored by 10-1 odds.
But there was one more delay. I
Nobody had remembered to bring a
football. So fans and players alike
cooled their heels while the Cal
manager hopped street car and !
bought a pigskin at a downtown |
sports shop. He finally returned—
breathless, but with a football—and :
the sluefest was on.
TWO FLAYS
During the first half, Stanford
quarterback T. K. Code must have
been more clever at mixing up his j
two basic plays than the Cal signal
caller. For the Indian ball-toters.
outweighed by 11 pounds to the man.
out-toted ths Berkeley)te.s by 14 to 0 1
up to the rest period.
Weight began to tell in ihe second
half, and Berkeley's brawny bruisers
definitely held the upper hand after i
the intermission. But the best they j
could do before time ran out was to :
pound over two touchdowns, which j
then counted for live points each; !
and at the final gun, whistle, or i
shout, as the case may have been, j
the haughty Bears had been whipped
by the upstart Stanford crew, 14 ;
to 10.
