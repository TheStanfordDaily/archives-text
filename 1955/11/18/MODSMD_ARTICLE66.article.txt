# Experts Name '47 Big Game as Top Thriller As Cards Missed Upset on Intramural Pass'
## 40-Point Underdogs Hold Lead Till Last-Minute Jensen Heave Deadlocks in '24, '50, '53 Games Also Tabbed as 'Most Thrilling' 
### DAVE CANFIELD 
What was the most thrilling Big Game you've ever seen?
Stanford*, not-quite-but-alrnost upset of a heavily-favored Cal
team in 1947 heads the list, according to a survey of veteran mem
bers of the Athletic Department and local newspapermen.
The 20-20 deadlock in 1924 runs a strong sccond, with the 1950
and 19.')3 battles also getting consid-*
eration. Ail three games were ties. [

1947
Athletic Director Allied R. Mas
ters, Publicity Director Don Lieben
dorfer and Palo Alio Times Sports
E. itor Wa't Gamage declared that
the 1947 game was their favorite.
Liebendorfer leaned back in his
chair and reflected: "It's a tough
question because I've seen a great
many Eig Games, many terrific one-.
I would have to vote for the 1947
game that we lost, 21-18.
"We were underdogs by 40 point. l ,
but led, 18-14, at one time. The,v
completed a touchdown pass an i
kicked the point with about two
minutes to go and won."
Masters agree..: "As in this year's
USC game, we were,big underdog. l :,
it was a thrilling encounter because
>ve weren't suppo ed to be in the
picture but we were. Those are the
kind of games I like to do weil in."
HOW IT HAPPENED
The game went something like
this:
Stanford was a 10-1 longshot and
hadn't won a game all year. But for
eight minutes in the fourth quarter
the Cards had mighty California
under submis ion, 18-14, and 85,000
in the Stadium were roaring with
delight.
After the Bears had drawn first
blood, two Indians named Anderson,
Wayne and Bob, shot Stanford into
the lead. Wayne Anderson cradlcd in
a four-yard pass from Ainslee Bell
for one TD and skirted end five
yards for another.
Then Bob Anderson climaxed a
76-yard scoring drive by catching an

11-yard pass from Don Campbell in
the end zone.
But with four minutes left in the
game, a scarred and scared Califor
nia made one last desperate play.
All-American Fullback Jackie
Jensen took a shovel lateral from
star quarterback Bob Ccleri. Run
ning to his right on his own 20, Jen
sen threw diagonally across the field
to Halfback Paul Keckley on the
Stanford 40.
SHOESTRING CATCH
The pass was short. Forced to re
trace his steps, Keckley made . a
shoestring catch. Then he whirled

and wriggled rapidly through the
Stanford secondary 40 heart-break
ing yards to pay diit.
r-endall Peck, Indian defender,
tried a valiant diving tackle of
KeckJey from behind on the five.
He mis e !. Bear Guard Jim Cullom
converted the un-needed point and
that was it.
Gamage said Coach Marchie
Schwartz referred to the play later
cS an "intramural pa is."
Gamage continued: "Two guys had
a shot at Keckley but he got away
As Schwartz .'■aid, 'Why couldn't the
guy have tripped?' Anyway, if Stan
ford had lasted a few minutes more,
it wouid have been one of the great
est upsets of all time."
1924
San Francisco Chronicle Sports
E itor Bill Lciser and Intramural
Director Elwyn Bugge cited the 1024
Big Game as the most spine-tingling
they'd ever witnessed. Liebendorfer
named it as his second choice.
This was the year that Stanford
came from behind in the final period
to gain a 20-20 tie. Both teams went
into the contest unbeaten.
Leber gave this description of the
game: "Stanford was an underdog
with Ernie Nevers and Norm Cleave
land out. Stanford scored six points
in the first quarter, but Cal practi
cally blew Stanford off the field by
taking a 20-6 advantage in three
quarters.
"Then Stanford, coached by the
great Pop Warner, came back.
"This was the first modern game,
the first gprne characterized by hys
teria. People fainted all over the
field and a couple of people died.
Many think it was the greatest game
they ever saw, anywhere, any time."
TWO FIELD GOALS
Liebendorfer was equally enthusi
astic: "When Cal led, 20-6, we hadn't

•cored a single touchdown; our six
points had come on two field goals.
Cal then took out its to.j backfield
combination with five minutes to j
play and under the substitution rules
they couldn't put them back in. We
scored two TD's and tied the score.
"Cal dominated piay until the last.
In fact, until we scored our first j
touchdown, we never got inside the I
Bears' 35-yard line."
Bugge reminisced: "It was the
first game played in Berkeley, and j
at the time I ju-t couldn't believe we
could lose. Even though we lost j
Norm Cleaveland the day before j
through ineligibility, I still couldn't j
believe we could lose. Even when |
we were behind, 20-fi, I still couldn't j
believe we could lose."
CUDDEBACK'S PLAY
"Another exciting part of this
game," Liebendorfer remembered, j
"was the great inrividual perform-i
ance by Murray Cuddeback, who j
died some years ago. He scored 14 I
of our 20 points. He kicked two field I
goals, caught one touchdown pass. {
and booted two extra points."
In describing Cuddeback's play,
the Daily Palo Alto (now The Daily) j
proclaimed: "From the starting kick- !
off to the final gun. Cuddeback was j
in every play, offensive and defen
sive, playing one of the greatest |
games of his career and outshining
even the sensational little 'Tut' Im- !
lay of California.
"If the Humane Society were not
so active a body, it might be sug
gested that Cuddeback's toe be
placed in some suitable place to !
commemorate the culmination of its j
education."
1950
As istant. Coach Pete Kmetovic,
who led the PCC in scoring J'or Stan
ford in 1940, picked the 1950 game,
a 7-7 tie, as his most thrilling Big
Game.
"Cal was favored," Kmetovic said.
"That was the year they went to the 1
Rose Bowl. But Stanford controlled ;
the ball most of the game, had one i

touchdown called back and would j
ha\'e won in the closing seconds if |
Bill MeColl's long pats to speedster
Bobby Bryan hadn't dribbled off his
fingers."
In this game, Cal struck first. Pete
Schabarum took a handoff and with
beautiful blocking scooted 31 yaid
down the sideline for the lone Cal
score.
Late in the third quarter, Stan
ford's captain and All-PCC line
backer Ru. c :s Pomeroy jarred Scha
<m ln<">so from the ball. The In
dians recovered. Five plays later. j
benson look a flat pass from
Gary Kerkorian and pounded the
last six yards. Kerkorian's conver
sion lied the count.
Then MeColl's long, long pass just
barely missed.
1953
Prescotl Sullivan, veteran column
ist of the San Francisco Examiner,
named the 21-21 tie in 1953 as his
top Big Game.
'"I don't know why I pick this
game over the 1924 game," Sullivan
said, "except that there were more j
points and there was more action in !
the 1953 game than in the 1924 bat
tle. Besides, back in 1924, I was just ]
a boy."



PRESCOTT SULLIVAN
More action in. '53.
