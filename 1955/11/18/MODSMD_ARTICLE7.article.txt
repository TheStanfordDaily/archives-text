## This Is The Year 
### 
In '47, the odds were 10 lo I—that Cal would
win the Big Game and take the Axe to Berke
ley. The Daily said, "We aren't predicting a
Stanford victory, but we do know that Stanford
can do the job." Stanford almost did the job,
but lost in the closing minutes, 21-18.
That was the beginning . . .
In '48, the sentiments were brief: "Truman
did it, so can we." But Cal didn't fold like
Dewey. Almost, though: 7-6.
In '49, under a headline "We're Confident,"
The Daily commented editorially: "We're not
out for a moral victory this year—lo lose, but
with honor. WVre going to win, and there's
b„arely a person on campus who'll tell you
differently. Get the Axe. We know you will."
Score: 33-14, Cal.
In '50, the underdogs were aiming high: "We
know we're not supposed to win. But we
weren't even supposed to be on the same field
in 1947. This is the Big Game, and upsets are
expected." There was an upset; Stanford man
aged to tie, 7-7.
In '51, there was reason for confidence:
"We're confident of the outcome. A team with
the heart plus the ability of the 1951 Stanford
eleven won't toss away the biggest one of the

year. Can anyone who saw the Cards run El
Trojan out of the Coliseum two weeks ago
doubt that we'll beat the Bear?" Stanford went
to the Rose Bowl; the Axe stayed at Berkeley,
20-7.
In '52, the plea was impassioned: "Because
here's a year that S'.anford doesn't have to roll
over and play patsy for the Bears, doesn't have
to rise halfway and be content with a tie, but
CAN—if it wants to—BEAT CAL." It was 26-0.
In '53: "Stanford, because it is healthy and
mentally-ready and has the best passing at
tack in the nation, will win. And about 5 p.m.
Saturday, long-faced Cal rooters will say "Wait
till next year'." But Stanford waited, 21-21.
Last year, it was poss'wsie: "The team doesn't
want to wait until next year. For them, particu
larly the seniors, the time is now. One of the
traditions cf the classic is that upsets are com
mon." No upset, another wait, 28-20.
Thus it's been nine years since we won. It's
been 13 years since Chuck Taylor, Ail-Ameri
can guard, was associated with a winner. It's
been 20 years since the Vow Boys won the
last Big Cams in the Stadium.
It's been too long.
But this is the year.
