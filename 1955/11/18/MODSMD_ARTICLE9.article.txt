# 'SEGDOGD' Is Tomorrow's Rule
## 
### 
Freshman girls (and upper class
women), take note.
A long time ago, some impecuni
ous and enterprising Stanford male
expounded a basic principle in the
Stanford dating behavior.
Years passed and Bull Sessioner
Vic Palmieri of The Daily, taking
note of the alphabet soup in the
ASSU government, endowed the
principle with the title SEGDOGD.
Roughly translated, the principle
of SEGDOGD is "she either goes
dutch or gets ditched."
So, freshman girls and upper class
women, just fork over one-half (50
per cent) of what Big Game might
cost him. No more, no less.
