# WE WON!
## Prodigal Axe Wends Its Way From Cal to Stanford to Bank Knight Presents Coveted Trophy To Big Game Co-Captain Marshall 
### 
The scoreboard read only seconds to go. The Indians were
ahead, 19-0. All of a sudden in the Stanford rooting section stu
dents began looking at one another. "We've got the Axe, we've
got the Axe."
Nine years of famine had ended.
"As Governor of the Board of Regents of the University of

California and as a graduate oH
Stanford University, 1919, I take
great pleasure in presenting to you,
Chris Marshall, the Axe."
And so after nine years the Axe
was home as Governor Goodwin J.
Knight took it from its Cal custo
dian, Harry Lohstroh, and presented
it to Marshall and yell leader Jim
Walters.
A mass of Starifordites crowded
around the presentation site in front,
of the Cal section wildly, deliriously

shouting "hip-hip-hooray." Cal re
sponded with chants of "it took nine
years" and "we'll get it next year."
Knight asked football co-captain
Marshall if he was tired. "I'm too
happy to be tired right now."
The Stanford crowd, exploding in
nine years of pent-up celebration
finally calmed down long enough to
sing the Stanford Hymn.
Rally Committee members impa
tiently extended eager hands up to
the Axe as if afraid that after so long
it might somehow get away.
After the Governor and Marshall
turned with the Axe to give Cal fans
their last look for at least a year,
raccoon - coated Walters handed it
down to the waiting arms of Santa
Clara County sheriff's deputies.
AXE BORNE AWAY
The four deputies led the way as
a throng of football players, Rally
Commers, student police, ASSU offi
cers, students—anybody who could
get hi.s hands on the Axe—bulldozed
their way through the solidly
packed mob to the open end of the
Stadium,
Anybody in the way was elbowed,
shoved, practically trampled as the
Axe was borne towards a waiting
sheriff's car. Every few yards the
trophy-bearers would stop, either to
regroup or to display the Axe for
fans and photographers.
Willi the photographers getting
one last shot, ASSU President
George Ralph took the Axe into the
sheriff's car and two husky deputies
moved in beside him.

THE AXE, THE STANFORD AXE-Governor Goodwin Knight
begins his presentation of the Axe to Stanford co-captain Chris
Marshall by recalling that he was a Stanford graduate, class of
'19. Head yell leader Jim Walters (far right), bedecked in raccoon
coat and clutching the Axe handle, responds by leading

Frank Huntress
the assembled Stanford rooters in a chorus of' "Hip-hip hoorays."
Between Knight and Walters is Cal's head yell leader,
Rod Friedman, who warned that the Bears would win back the
Axe next year. Knight's presentation marks the first time the
Big Game trophy has been transferred since 1947.

SAFETY FIRST — The Axe just before going into a familiar
home—a vault in the American Trust Company in Palo Alto.
In 1930 when the Immortal 21 first brought it back to Stanford
it was placed here. After Saturday's game Santa Clara County
deputies sped it to the bank. There Jim Walters, head cheer
leader (left), and ASSU President George Ralph (right) helped
put it under lock and key. In the center is one of the deputies,
John R. O'Brien.
T'ooley (he had the key to the special
bank deposit box) slid into the back
seat and was promptly surrounded
by the other two deputies.
TAKEN TO BANK
Then it was off to the American
Trust Company in Palo Alto for
safe-keeping.
Meanwhile, Walters, clutching the
Axe's handle which was returned to
Stanford only last week, was hoisted
on the shoulders of two students
who carried him out of the Stadium
to a waiting car which sped him
toward Palo Alto.
He arrived at the bank in time for
Big Game Day's final official act.
Carefully he laid the Axe in its safe
deposit box. He watched as Ralph
and Tooley locked it up. Then the
big vault door closed solidly.
The Axe had come back home.
