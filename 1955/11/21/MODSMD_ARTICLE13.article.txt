# Waldorf Pleased With Cal Performance, Butâ€”

### JIM BAKER 
"Well," said Pappy Waldorf following Stanford's 19-0 Big Game
win, "we always hate to lose to Stanford, but there's no question
that they were the better team in all departments today."
Was Pappy disappointed in Cal's performance? "No. I thought
we played pretty well, and did a fair job on Stanford's passers.

They completed their passes at the
crticial times."
Waldorf was asked what he
thought of John Brodie. "He was
very, very accurate, accurate enough
to hit a man who was covered, which
was the usual case."
PRAISES TARR
Beside Brodie, Waldorf also prais
ed Tarr. "Ho's a scrambling type of
runner that we could hit but couldn't
hold on to."
Waldorf praised the Indians as the
best team that he has seen at Stan
ford, and said the Cards were a
steady and good all around team.
Is Stanford the best team in the
conference? "I don't think so. UCLA
seems to me to be the strongest team
in the FCC." Pappy declined to pick
a winner in the Rose Bowl game,
where UCLA will meet Michigan
State.
The "Wise Walrus of Strawberry
Canyon," as Pappy was called dur
ing his Rose Bowl years, was asked
what his plans are for next year.
"I've no other plans. My contract
expires June 30, 1957, and I have no
plans after that.
BEST FROSH EVER
"We've had plenty of ups and
plenty of downs, and this year we're
down in all sports. But there's an
excellent group returning, plus the
group that was unable to participate
this year, plus the best freshman
team we've had in four years, so
we'll be on the rebound next year."
Pappy praised Mike White, Ron
Wheatcroft and Jim Carmichael for
their fine defensive play for the
Bears.
But as Pappy said, "You can sum
up the game by saying we just
weren't as good as they were."
