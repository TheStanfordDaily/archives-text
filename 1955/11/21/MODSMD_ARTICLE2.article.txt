# THE 						AXE IS HOME AFTER 8 SEASONS
## Brodie Leads Confident Cards In 19-0 Victory Over Bears Taylor Pleased with Effort, Praises Team, Players as 'Outstanding, Best I've Had Here 
### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
The long wait is over. Eight years of "wait till next year" ended
Saturday as the Stanford Indians finally regained the Axe by
handling outclassed Cal, 19-0.
Strangely enough, the victory did not set off any big dressing
room demonstration among Coach Chuck Taylor's crew. The
boys were confident that they were going to win the game, and
| they did without too much sweat.
End John Stewart probably summed up the attitude of most
of the players when he said "I felt happier after the SC game."
Co-captain Chris Marshall, who received the Axe after the
game from Governor Goodwin J. Knight, came into the dressing
rcom wearing a big grin, saying, "I don't know. It felt wonder
ful. Cal played it pretty tough in the line."
This was also the opinion of center Don Geddes and halfback
Gordy Young. Geddes thought that Cal played good defense
while Young said, "If the breaks had gone against us, it could
i have been a lot closer."
On the other hand, the score might have been worse but for
a Stanford drive that was barely stalled inside Cal's 10-yard line.
Cal Didn't Have Much But Spirit
Center Joe Long and guard Tony Mosich concurred that Cal
didn't have much, although the Bears played a spirited game.
Long said, "Just like San Jose State, they just didn't have it."
Mosich opined, "They were weak. We pushed them all around."
Just about the happiest looking man in the dressing room was
senior halfback Ernie Dorn. Dorn, who broke his shoulder in
the Washington game and was thought to be through for the
season, suited up anyway and made an unscheduled appear
ance in the game late in the fourth quarter.

On his one play, Ernie came
within an eyelash of having his
greatest moment in football.
Quarterback Jerry Gustafson
called for fullback Bill Tarr to
pass to Dorn. Dorn sped down
the field and Tarr threw what
would have been a perfect 30-
) yard stri'ke to the flying Ernie
! but for Cal defender Nick Papac
who suddenly came out of no
1 where to pick off the pigskin.
Almost a TI)
Had Papac not been there,
Dorn would have had himself a
Big Game touchdown.
Coach Chuck Taylor admitted
I that he felt "fine" after getting
his first Big Game win as Stan
ford's head coach although he
was somewhat disappointed that
Stanford did not cash in all of
' its scoring opportunities.
Taylor said his sguad this
year was the best he has had
at Stanford, "primarily because
of the line." Chuck also had
words of praise for halfbacks
Gordy Young and Paul Camera,
end Gary Van Galder, guard
Tony Mosich and for most of
the rest of the team.

think of them all as outstanding."
Taylor commented that the In
dians did not try a great variety of
pass plays. Despite this, the Stan
ford quarterbacks had* a field day at
Cal's expense.
Between them, John Brodie and
Jack Douglas hit on 19 out of 26 at
tempts for 248 yards. All in all, four
Indian tossers compiled an amazing
record of 20 completions in 31 at
tempts.
"FELT SAFE"
Chuck said that he felt safe at the
end of the third quarter with Stan
ford ahead, 12 to 0.
Taylor was impressed with the
size of the Bears—or rather then
lack of size. He said, "It sure is
strange to see Cal not loaded with
big players."
Upon the announcement that
Michigan State and UCLA are ap
parently now the Rose Bowl rivals,
the inevitable question was thrown
at Taylor, the only coach to face
both this year: "Who will win?"
Taylor replied that it will be "a
helluva game. Michigan State did
more things to us on offense but
UCLA showed a better defense."
The 58th Big Game, but for the
excitement generated by the event
itself, was not a thrilling game.
California never seriously threaten
ed Stanford's superiority, and the
Indians were just out to win the
game, not to pour it on.
Stanford was on the scoreboard
with six after the first two and one
half minutes of play. The big play
in the 70-yard drive was a screen
pass from Brodie to Young that cov
ered 62 yards.
Young ran beautifully on the play.
He used his interference nicely to
spring loose and then swept down
the sideline.
The last Cal man between Young
and the goal line, Ted Granger,
finally threw the speeding Indian
out of bounds on the 8-yard line.

Camera almost got Granger out
of the play but couldn't quite get a
good enough angle to throw a proper
block.
It took Stanford four plays to get
the ball over after Young's run with
Brodie finally doing the honors on a
one-yard sneak.
Cal almost tied the score before
the end of the first quarter. Cal end
Mike White picked off a Brodie pass
on the Cal 46 and headed for the

Stanford goal line with only Brodie
to stop him.
White obliged the Stanford cause
by running away from his interfer
ence, leaving Brodie with an open
shot. Brodie didn't miss as he horse
collared White on the 17.
The Bears flubbed their chance
when Cal quarterback Ralph Hoff
man fumbled on fourth down. Big
Paul Wiggin fell on the ball on
the 11.

i The Indians upped the count to
12-0 late in the first half on an 8-
play drive from the Cal 45. The three
big plays were Brodie passes to
; Young for 15, to Jerry Beatie for
nine and to Camera for 13.
It was at this time that Brodie,
the passing master, was in the mid
die of a streak of 10 consecutive
completions.
Brodie again got the touchdown
j with another one-yard sneak.
FINAL TD
The Indians got their final TD
| early in the fourth quarter with
: Jack Douglas running the attack.
Starting on its own 48, Stanford
got the score in eight plays.
Douglas continued Brodie's streak
. by hitting on his first two to make it
total of 12 straight bullseyes. Doug
! las then missed one but hit on his
next two, the last to Van Galder for
the touchdown. The play covered
13 yards.
Stanford, starting from its own
26, drove all the way to the Cal 5
j midway through the second quarter.
There, on a fourth down - two to go
! situation, Brodie elected to keep the
I ball and only got one yard although
! many of the fans thought that he
1 had made it before getting shoved
I back.

The Stanford Braves whipped
Cal's Ramblers, 26-13, in the pre

At the same time the Cal soccer

Taylor commented that the In
dians did not try a great variety of
pass plays. Despite this, the Stan
ford quarterbacks had* a field day at
Cal's expense.
Between them, John Brodie and
Jack Douglas hit on 19 out of 26 at
tempts for 248 yards. All in all, four
Indian tossers compiled an amazing
record of 20 completions in 31 at
tempts.
"FELT SAFE"
Chuck said that he felt safe at the
end of the third quarter with Stan
ford ahead, 12 to 0.
Taylor was impressed with the
size of the Bears—or rather then
lack of size. He said, "It sure is
strange to see Cal not loaded with
big players."
Upon the announcement that
Michigan State and UCLA are ap
parently now the Rose Bowl rivals,
the inevitable question was thrown
at Taylor, the only coach to face
both this year: "Who will win?"
Taylor replied that it will be "a
helluva game. Michigan State did
more things to us on offense but
UCLA showed a better defense."
The 58th Big Game, but for the
excitement generated by the event
itself, was not a thrilling game.
California never seriously threaten
ed Stanford's superiority, and the
Indians were just out to win the
game, not to pour it on.
Stanford was on the scoreboard
with six after the first two and one
half minutes of play. The big play
in the 70-yard drive was a screen
pass from Brodie to Young that cov
ered 62 yards.
Young ran beautifully on the play.
He used his interference nicely to
spring loose and then swept down
the sideline.
The last Cal man between Young
and the goal line, Ted Granger,
finally threw the speeding Indian
out of bounds on the 8-yard line.

Camera almost got Granger out
of the play but couldn't quite get a
good enough angle to throw a proper
block.
It took Stanford four plays to get
the ball over after Young's run with
Brodie finally doing the honors on a
one-yard sneak.
Cal almost tied the score before
the end of the first quarter. Cal end
Mike White picked off a Brodie pass
on the Cal 46 and headed for the

Stanford goal line with only Brodie
to stop him.
White obliged the Stanford cause
by running away from his interfer
ence, leaving Brodie with an open
shot. Brodie didn't miss as he horse
collared White on the 17.
The Bears flubbed their chance
when Cal quarterback Ralph Hoff
man fumbled on fourth down. Big
Paul Wiggin fell on the ball on
the 11.

i The Indians upped the count to
12-0 late in the first half on an 8-
play drive from the Cal 45. The three
big plays were Brodie passes to
; Young for 15, to Jerry Beatie for
nine and to Camera for 13.
It was at this time that Brodie,
the passing master, was in the mid
die of a streak of 10 consecutive
completions.
Brodie again got the touchdown
j with another one-yard sneak.
FINAL TD
The Indians got their final TD
| early in the fourth quarter with
: Jack Douglas running the attack.
Starting on its own 48, Stanford
got the score in eight plays.
Douglas continued Brodie's streak
. by hitting on his first two to make it
total of 12 straight bullseyes. Doug
! las then missed one but hit on his
next two, the last to Van Galder for
the touchdown. The play covered
13 yards.
Stanford, starting from its own
26, drove all the way to the Cal 5
j midway through the second quarter.
There, on a fourth down - two to go
! situation, Brodie elected to keep the
I ball and only got one yard although

1 had made it before getting shoved
I back.

Cal's Ramblers, 26-13, in the pre

tomorrow.
The long wait is over. Eight years of "wait till next year" ended
Saturday as the Stanford Indians finally regained the Axe by
handling outclassed Cal, 19-0.
Strangely enough, the victory did not set off any big dressing
room demonstration among Coach Chuck Taylor's crew. The
boys were confident that they were going to win the game, and
| they did without too much sweat.
End John Stewart probably summed up the attitude of most
of the players when he said "I felt happier after the SC game."
Co-captain Chris Marshall, who received the Axe after the
game from Governor Goodwin J. Knight, came into the dressing
rcom wearing a big grin, saying, "I don't know. It felt wonder
ful. Cal played it pretty tough in the line."
This was also the opinion of center Don Geddes and halfback
Gordy Young. Geddes thought that Cal played good defense
while Young said, "If the breaks had gone against us, it could
i have been a lot closer."
On the other hand, the score might have been worse but for
a Stanford drive that was barely stalled inside Cal's 10-yard line.
Cal Didn't Have Much But Spirit
Center Joe Long and guard Tony Mosich concurred that Cal
didn't have much, although the Bears played a spirited game.
Long said, "Just like San Jose State, they just didn't have it."
Mosich opined, "They were weak. We pushed them all around."
Just about the happiest looking man in the dressing room was
senior halfback Ernie Dorn. Dorn, who broke his shoulder in
the Washington game and was thought to be through for the
season, suited up anyway and made an unscheduled appear
ance in the game late in the fourth quarter.

On his one play, Ernie came
within an eyelash of having his
greatest moment in football.
Quarterback Jerry Gustafson
called for fullback Bill Tarr to
pass to Dorn. Dorn sped down
the field and Tarr threw what
would have been a perfect 30-

Taylor replied that it will be "a
helluva game. Michigan State did
more things to us on offense but
UCLA showed a better defense."
The 58th Big Game, but for the
excitement generated by the event
itself, was not a thrilling game.
California never seriously threaten
ed Stanford's superiority, and the
Indians were just out to win the
game, not to pour it on.
Stanford was on the scoreboard
with six after the first two and one
half minutes of play. The big play
in the 70-yard drive was a screen
pass from Brodie to Young that cov
ered 62 yards.
Young ran beautifully on the play.
He used his interference nicely to
spring loose and then swept down
the sideline.
The last Cal man between Young
and the goal line, Ted Granger,
finally threw the speeding Indian
out of bounds on the 8-yard line.

Camera almost got Granger out
of the play but couldn't quite get a
good enough angle to throw a proper
block.
It took Stanford four plays to get
the ball over after Young's run with
Brodie finally doing the honors on a
one-yard sneak.
Cal almost tied the score before
the end of the first quarter. Cal end
Mike White picked off a Brodie pass
on the Cal 46 and headed for the

Stanford goal line with only Brodie
to stop him.
White obliged the Stanford cause
by running away from his interfer
ence, leaving Brodie with an open
shot. Brodie didn't miss as he horse
collared White on the 17.
The Bears flubbed their chance
when Cal quarterback Ralph Hoff
man fumbled on fourth down. Big
Paul Wiggin fell on the ball on
the 11.

i The Indians upped the count to
12-0 late in the first half on an 8-
play drive from the Cal 45. The three
big plays were Brodie passes to
; Young for 15, to Jerry Beatie for
nine and to Camera for 13.
It was at this time that Brodie,
the passing master, was in the mid
die of a streak of 10 consecutive
completions.
Brodie again got the touchdown
j with another one-yard sneak.
FINAL TD
The Indians got their final TD
| early in the fourth quarter with
: Jack Douglas running the attack.
Starting on its own 48, Stanford
got the score in eight plays.
Douglas continued Brodie's streak
. by hitting on his first two to make it
total of 12 straight bullseyes. Doug
! las then missed one but hit on his
next two, the last to Van Galder for
the touchdown. The play covered
13 yards.
Stanford, starting from its own
26, drove all the way to the Cal 5
j midway through the second quarter.
There, on a fourth down - two to go
! situation, Brodie elected to keep the
I ball and only got one yard although
! many of the fans thought that he
1 had made it before getting shoved
I back.

The Stanford Braves whipped
Cal's Ramblers, 26-13, in the pre
liminary to Saturday's Big Game.
At the same time the Cal soccer
men were defeating Stanford, 2-0.
Detailed stories will be printed
tomorrow.
The long wait is over. Eight years of "wait till next year" ended
Saturday as the Stanford Indians finally regained the Axe by
handling outclassed Cal, 19-0.
Strangely enough, the victory did not set off any big dressing
room demonstration among Coach Chuck Taylor's crew. The
boys were confident that they were going to win the game, and
| they did without too much sweat.
End John Stewart probably summed up the attitude of most
of the players when he said "I felt happier after the SC game."
Co-captain Chris Marshall, who received the Axe after the
game from Governor Goodwin J. Knight, came into the dressing
rcom wearing a big grin, saying, "I don't know. It felt wonder
ful. Cal played it pretty tough in the line."
This was also the opinion of center Don Geddes and halfback
Gordy Young. Geddes thought that Cal played good defense
while Young said, "If the breaks had gone against us, it could
i have been a lot closer."
On the other hand, the score might have been worse but for
a Stanford drive that was barely stalled inside Cal's 10-yard line.
Cal Didn't Have Much But Spirit
Center Joe Long and guard Tony Mosich concurred that Cal
didn't have much, although the Bears played a spirited game.
Long said, "Just like San Jose State, they just didn't have it."
Mosich opined, "They were weak. We pushed them all around."
Just about the happiest looking man in the dressing room was
senior halfback Ernie Dorn. Dorn, who broke his shoulder in
the Washington game and was thought to be through for the
season, suited up anyway and made an unscheduled appear
ance in the game late in the fourth quarter.

On his one play, Ernie came
within an eyelash of having his
greatest moment in football.
Quarterback Jerry Gustafson
called for fullback Bill Tarr to
pass to Dorn. Dorn sped down
the field and Tarr threw what
would have been a perfect 30-
) yard stri'ke to the flying Ernie
! but for Cal defender Nick Papac
who suddenly came out of no
1 where to pick off the pigskin.
Almost a TI)
Had Papac not been there,
Dorn would have had himself a
Big Game touchdown.
Coach Chuck Taylor admitted
I that he felt "fine" after getting
his first Big Game win as Stan
ford's head coach although he
was somewhat disappointed that
Stanford did not cash in all of
' its scoring opportunities.
Taylor said his sguad this
year was the best he has had
at Stanford, "primarily because
of the line." Chuck also had
words of praise for halfbacks
Gordy Young and Paul Camera,
end Gary Van Galder, guard
Tony Mosich and for most of
the rest of the team.

pass plays. Despite this, the Stan

Cal's expense.

"FELT SAFE"
Chuck said that he felt safe at the
end of the third quarter with Stan

lack of size. He said, "It sure is

big players."

Michigan State and UCLA are ap

liminary to Saturday's Big Game.

Detailed stories will be printed
tomorrow.
The long wait is over. Eight years of "wait till next year" ended
Saturday as the Stanford Indians finally regained the Axe by
handling outclassed Cal, 19-0.
Strangely enough, the victory did not set off any big dressing
room demonstration among Coach Chuck Taylor's crew. The
boys were confident that they were going to win the game, and
| they did without too much sweat.
End John Stewart probably summed up the attitude of most
of the players when he said "I felt happier after the SC game."
Co-captain Chris Marshall, who received the Axe after the
game from Governor Goodwin J. Knight, came into the dressing
rcom wearing a big grin, saying, "I don't know. It felt wonder
ful. Cal played it pretty tough in the line."
This was also the opinion of center Don Geddes and halfback
Gordy Young. Geddes thought that Cal played good defense
while Young said, "If the breaks had gone against us, it could
i have been a lot closer."
On the other hand, the score might have been worse but for
a Stanford drive that was barely stalled inside Cal's 10-yard line.
Cal Didn't Have Much But Spirit
Center Joe Long and guard Tony Mosich concurred that Cal
didn't have much, although the Bears played a spirited game.
Long said, "Just like San Jose State, they just didn't have it."
Mosich opined, "They were weak. We pushed them all around."
Just about the happiest looking man in the dressing room was
senior halfback Ernie Dorn. Dorn, who broke his shoulder in
the Washington game and was thought to be through for the
season, suited up anyway and made an unscheduled appear
ance in the game late in the fourth quarter.

On his one play, Ernie came
within an eyelash of having his
greatest moment in football.
Quarterback Jerry Gustafson
called for fullback Bill Tarr to
pass to Dorn. Dorn sped down
the field and Tarr threw what
would have been a perfect 30-
) yard stri'ke to the flying Ernie
! but for Cal defender Nick Papac
who suddenly came out of no
1 where to pick off the pigskin.
Almost a TI)
Had Papac not been there,
Dorn would have had himself a
Big Game touchdown.
Coach Chuck Taylor admitted
I that he felt "fine" after getting
his first Big Game win as Stan
ford's head coach although he
was somewhat disappointed that
Stanford did not cash in all of
' its scoring opportunities.
Taylor said his sguad this
year was the best he has had
at Stanford, "primarily because
of the line." Chuck also had
words of praise for halfbacks
Gordy Young and Paul Camera,
end Gary Van Galder, guard
Tony Mosich and for most of
the rest of the team.
"In a game like this, I like to

think of them all as outstanding."
Taylor commented that the In
dians did not try a great variety of
pass plays. Despite this, the Stan
ford quarterbacks had* a field day at
Cal's expense.
Between them, John Brodie and
Jack Douglas hit on 19 out of 26 at
tempts for 248 yards. All in all, four
Indian tossers compiled an amazing
record of 20 completions in 31 at
tempts.
"FELT SAFE"
Chuck said that he felt safe at the
end of the third quarter with Stan
ford ahead, 12 to 0.
Taylor was impressed with the
size of the Bears—or rather then
lack of size. He said, "It sure is
strange to see Cal not loaded with
big players."
Upon the announcement that
Michigan State and UCLA are ap
parently now the Rose Bowl rivals,
the inevitable question was thrown
at Taylor, the only coach to face
both this year: "Who will win?"
Taylor replied that it will be "a
helluva game. Michigan State did
more things to us on offense but
UCLA showed a better defense."
The 58th Big Game, but for the
excitement generated by the event
itself, was not a thrilling game.
California never seriously threaten
ed Stanford's superiority, and the
Indians were just out to win the
game, not to pour it on.
Stanford was on the scoreboard
with six after the first two and one
half minutes of play. The big play
in the 70-yard drive was a screen
pass from Brodie to Young that cov
ered 62 yards.
Young ran beautifully on the play.
He used his interference nicely to
spring loose and then swept down
the sideline.
The last Cal man between Young
and the goal line, Ted Granger,
finally threw the speeding Indian
out of bounds on the 8-yard line.

Camera almost got Granger out
of the play but couldn't quite get a
good enough angle to throw a proper
block.
It took Stanford four plays to get
the ball over after Young's run with
Brodie finally doing the honors on a
one-yard sneak.
Cal almost tied the score before
the end of the first quarter. Cal end
Mike White picked off a Brodie pass
on the Cal 46 and headed for the

Stanford goal line with only Brodie
to stop him.
White obliged the Stanford cause
by running away from his interfer
ence, leaving Brodie with an open
shot. Brodie didn't miss as he horse
collared White on the 17.
The Bears flubbed their chance
when Cal quarterback Ralph Hoff
man fumbled on fourth down. Big
Paul Wiggin fell on the ball on
the 11.

i The Indians upped the count to
12-0 late in the first half on an 8-
play drive from the Cal 45. The three
big plays were Brodie passes to
; Young for 15, to Jerry Beatie for
nine and to Camera for 13.
It was at this time that Brodie,
the passing master, was in the mid
die of a streak of 10 consecutive
completions.
Brodie again got the touchdown
j with another one-yard sneak.
