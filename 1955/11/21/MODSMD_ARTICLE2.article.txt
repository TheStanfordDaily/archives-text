# THE
						AXE IS HOME AFTER 8 SEASONS
## Brodie Leads Confident Cards In 19-0 Victory Over Bears Taylor Pleased with Effort, Praises Team, Players as 'Outstanding, Best I've Had Here 
### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
The long wait is over. Eight years of "wait till next year" ended
Saturday as the Stanford Indians finally regained the Axe by
handling outclassed Cal, 19-0.
Strangely enough, the victory did not set off any big dressing
room demonstration among Coach Chuck Taylor's crew. The
boys were confident that they were going to win the game, and
| they did without too much sweat.
End John Stewart probably summed up the attitude of most
of the players when he said "I felt happier after the SC game."
Co-captain Chris Marshall, who received the Axe after the
game from Governor Goodwin J. Knight, came into the dressing
rcom wearing a big grin, saying, "I don't know. It felt wonder
ful. Cal played it pretty tough in the line."
This was also the opinion of center Don Geddes and halfback
Gordy Young. Geddes thought that Cal played good defense
while Young said, "If the breaks had gone against us, it could
i have been a lot closer."
On the other hand, the score might have been worse but for
a Stanford drive that was barely stalled inside Cal's 10-yard line.
Cal Didn't Have Much But Spirit
Center Joe Long and guard Tony Mosich concurred that Cal
didn't have much, although the Bears played a spirited game.
Long said, "Just like San Jose State, they just didn't have it."
Mosich opined, "They were weak. We pushed them all around."
Just about the happiest looking man in the dressing room was
senior halfback Ernie Dorn. Dorn, who broke his shoulder in
the Washington game and was thought to be through for the
season, suited up anyway and made an unscheduled appear
ance in the game late in the fourth quarter.

On his one play, Ernie came
within an eyelash of having his
greatest moment in football.
Quarterback Jerry Gustafson
called for fullback Bill Tarr to
pass to Dorn. Dorn sped down
the field and Tarr threw what
would have been a perfect 30-
) yard stri'ke to the flying Ernie
! but for Cal defender Nick Papac
who suddenly came out of no
1 where to pick off the pigskin.

Had Papac not been there,
Dorn would have had himself a
Big Game touchdown.
Coach Chuck Taylor admitted
I that he felt "fine" after getting
his first Big Game win as Stan
ford's head coach although he
was somewhat disappointed that
Stanford did not cash in all of
' its scoring opportunities.
Taylor said his sguad this
year was the best he has had
at Stanford, "primarily because
of the line." Chuck also had
words of praise for halfbacks
Gordy Young and Paul Camera,
end Gary Van Galder, guard
Tony Mosich and for most of
the rest of the team.
"In a game like this, I like to

BEATIE BOBBLES —Stanford end Jerry Beatie juggled this pass
from John Brodie, but finally brought it in for an eight yard
