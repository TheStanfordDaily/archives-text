### 
Palo Alto soprano Ruth Daniel

Miss Daniel, soprano soloist with
the Palo Alto First Congregational

She has completed three months'
study with New York's Juilliard
School of Music, as winner of a
scholarship audition.
During the past year Miss Daniel
has given major recitals at San
Francisco's De Young Museum, at
the Modesto Schola Cantorium and
at Palo Alto High School.
Miss Daniel was born in Okmul

BEGAN STUDY AT 20
Her family moved to Los Angeles,
then to San Mateo, where she began
formal voice study in 1947â€”at the
age of 20.

"It is rich in quality and her range
is wide and effortless. Musically, she
has .made great strides in the past
years. Her native musical sensitivity
gives her a ready grasp of even the

She has developed an especially
acute ability to grasp the modern
idiom."

dot." a group of English songs by
Purcell, arias from the operas "Cre
