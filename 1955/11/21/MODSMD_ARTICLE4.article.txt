# nineteen to nothing
## 
### 
You watched Stanford all season. You saw
them fight back against UCLA, aggressively
thump USC, explode against Oregon. You saw
- Tarr smash, Brodie pass. Young run, Camera
catch, Long and Mosich tackle.
You read about Cal all season. Pappy was
having real* troubles. The Bears could barely
score, let alone win.
You listened to the predictions. You read
about the final odds in Saturday morning's
papers. i
You walked into the Stadium about noon
to see the Braves finish off the Ramblers.
You saw the teams come out and warm up.
You enjoyed all the pre-game activity. You
, saw the flip of the coin and the teams take
the field.
You watched the kickoff, the fumble, the
poor pass. Then you stood as Young squirmed
62 yards. Moments later you saw the referee
raise both arms. Your voice joined the roar
of approval.
Soon you saw another touchdown. Then you
were hoisting cards in the rooting section.
Later, still another touchdown. You watched
the clock tick off the seconds. You saw the
seniors come back for one last fling. You
watch&d the goal posts tumble. Yoii heard the
gun- go off.
You looked up at the scoreboard to double
check. You looked again.
Then the other goal posts yielded to the
crowd. And you stormed across the field to
exchange friendly greetings with the Cal sec
tion.

You saw the Governor, the football captain,
the student body president, the head yell lead
ers. You watched the presentation. You bel
lowed "hip-hip-hooray" as Cal predicted "wait
till next year."
You saw the sheriff's deputies escort the
trophy out of the Stadium. You saw it safely
enclosed in the vault.
You were there as it happened.
But you couldn't believe it.
Not after all these years. It didn't seem real.
It hardly even seemed right.
The dream had come true, but you were
stiU asleep.
But there it was. Nineteen to nothing. You
just had to believe it.
The Axe was home.
take a bow
Yes, this was the year. Big Game was suc
cessful from start to finish. More people than
we can name deserve special commendation
for the outstanding work they did to make the
week memorable.
Ram's Head's Gaieties was exceptional. Jim
Walters was at his best. The band's perform
ance was tops, as it has been all year. Rally
Corn's card stunts were the best in years. The
rooting section was orderly and well behaved
(except for the "Good-bye Pappy" chorus).
The football team did its part.
But Sigma Alpha Epsilon went beyond the
call of duty. The SAE mural was original and
striking.
Everyone may take a bow.

But you couldn't believe it.
Not after all these years. It didn't seem real.
It hardly even seemed right.
The dream had come true, but you were
stiU asleep.
But there it was. Nineteen to nothing. You
just had to believe it.
The Axe was home.
take a bow
Yes, this was the year. Big Game was suc
cessful from start to finish. More people than
we can name deserve special commendation
for the outstanding work they did to make the
week memorable.
Ram's Head's Gaieties was exceptional. Jim
Walters was at his best. The band's perform
ance was tops, as it has been all year. Rally
Corn's card stunts were the best in years. The
rooting section was orderly and well behaved
(except for the "Good-bye Pappy" chorus).
The football team did its part.
But Sigma Alpha Epsilon went beyond the
call of duty. The SAE mural was original and
striking.
Everyone may take a bow.
You watched Stanford all season. You saw
them fight back against UCLA, aggressively
thump USC, explode against Oregon. You saw
- Tarr smash, Brodie pass. Young run, Camera
catch, Long and Mosich tackle.
You read about Cal all season. Pappy was
having real* troubles. The Bears could barely
score, let alone win.
You listened to the predictions. You read
about the final odds in Saturday morning's
papers. i
You walked into the Stadium about noon
to see the Braves finish off the Ramblers.
You saw the teams come out and warm up.
You enjoyed all the pre-game activity. You
, saw the flip of the coin and the teams take
the field.
You watched the kickoff, the fumble, the
poor pass. Then you stood as Young squirmed
62 yards. Moments later you saw the referee
raise both arms. Your voice joined the roar
of approval.
Soon you saw another touchdown. Then you
were hoisting cards in the rooting section.
Later, still another touchdown. You watched
the clock tick off the seconds. You saw the
seniors come back for one last fling. You
watch&d the goal posts tumble. Yoii heard the
gun- go off.
You looked up at the scoreboard to double
check. You looked again.
Then the other goal posts yielded to the
crowd. And you stormed across the field to
exchange friendly greetings with the Cal sec
tion.

You saw the Governor, the football captain,
the student body president, the head yell lead
ers. You watched the presentation. You bel
lowed "hip-hip-hooray" as Cal predicted "wait
till next year."
You saw the sheriff's deputies escort the
trophy out of the Stadium. You saw it safely
enclosed in the vault.
You were there as it happened.
But you couldn't believe it.
Not after all these years. It didn't seem real.
It hardly even seemed right.
The dream had come true, but you were
stiU asleep.
But there it was. Nineteen to nothing. You
