Tonight, to get the week off on a musical
note (umm), the Concert Series is sponsoring
a concert by Ruth Daniel, who is described in
all the press releases as being a "promising
young dramatic soprano." And she may well
be. Best way to find out is to go listen. If you
aren't a season ducater, call DA 3-3780 for
tickets. She'll be at Mem Aud at 8:15.
* * *
The Astronomy Club is meeting tonight and
Richard Tocher is speaking. Yes. Sort of an
inspirational-type talk, too. It's called "The
Life History of a Star." Lovely thought, isn't
it . . . Room 380, Physics Corner, 8:30.
* * *
If any Biz School men did a slow bum last
week at the sight of Dean Spaeth adorning the
Tuesday Evening Series platform, they can
unbutton their tatters all vests and lean back,
for Big Business is in the spotlight this week.
Tomorrow night, the Series lecturer is Elmer
G. Burland, advisor on capital markets to the

International Bank for Reconstruction and De
velopment, talking on "The Experience and
Future of the International Bank," and we're
snowed. Mem Aud, 7:30.
★ ★ ie
Wednesday night is Football Flicks time,
and the subject is last Saturday's little contest.
It'll be shown in Cubberley at 7.
* * *
And comes the long weekend. Things ought
to be pretty calm and peaceful, for which let
us give thanks . . . Mem Church services are
scheduled for Thursday at 10 and Sunday at 11.
* * *
And for the benefit of any of the musically
minded who are spending the vacation on the
Peninsula, the San Francisco Symphony has
its first concert of the season Thursday night.
* * *
Flicks Note: Sunday night we got "Carnival
Story," with Ann Baxter, plus two cartoons.
