# Crowd Is Jubilant As "The Drought' Is Over
## After a Riotous Night in the City, An Old Era Ends 
### JIM PALMER 
You pushed your way
through the milling crowds,
across the well - worn playing
field and out the exit.
Behind you thousands of red and
white clad rooters were beginning
to make their way out of Stanford
Stadium, victorious for the first time
in a generation of Big Games on a
field now covered with fans who had
seen history made that day.
It was all over. Twenty years of
frustration in the stadium had been
vindicated.
An era was dead, a new one had
been born.
You had thought about all these
things as you watched the Governor
of California hand the Axe over to
a victorious football player wearing
number 75 and a Stanford cheer
leader wearing a raccoon coat.
Now you wondered how it was
possible to describe it all—the night
before when Stanford rooters and
Stanford spirit had taken San Fran
cisco by storm, the rooting section
at the game itself, and the aftermath
of sweet triumph.
This would be a weekend to re
member.
BAND, ALUMS . . .
You would remember Big Game
eve in the City, from the Top of the
Mark down to Union Square. The
crov/ds, the band, the alums and
their partie|. . . .
How close Oskie came to losing
his head . . . the brawl in the St.
Francis as the Dirty Golden Bear
successfully eluded Stanford hunters
by ducking in the English Bar and
Grill room. . . .
The march of the Stanford Band
on Powell' Street and the rally after
wards led by the cheerleaders and
pompon girls from atop a bus. . . .
The Phi Delt "marching band"
taking the Mark Hopkins by storm,
clapping garbage can lids together
for cymbals, playifig toy trumpets
and drums, clad in weird apparel. . . .
President Wallace Sterling with a
purple lei around his neck, social
izing with the Class of '35. . . . The
devastation at the Sheraton-Palace
when Stanfordites became uninvited
guests at a Cal alumni celebra-r
tion. . . .
The 12:20 a.m. rooters train back
where it was evident that the eve
ning had taken its toll among ex
hausted but happy roughs.
MADE GAME
But they all made it to the game,
somehow or other. The stands were
filling rapidly at noon.
Everyonb was there. The band,
after a night at the hotels playing
for hospitable alumni, was in rare
form. Leader George Sheldon waved
his baton every bit as well as when
he had perched on the bar at the
Top of the Mark.
The yelling started early, and Jim
Walters was there to lead it, waving
the Axe handle.
"We want the Axe," yelled the
Stanford roughs.
"You'll get the shaft," came the
terse reply.
From then on it was an inter
change of wits and noise, with Wal
ters & Co. scoring heavily on "We
pay your tuition," "Hello, Cal Ram
blers" when the Bears took the field,'
joshings of incoherent Cal yells, and

a passel of "Hip-hip hoorays."
And then it was game time. Four
quarters of yelling your lungs out,
hoping that it would somehow help
the Big Red team on the field to
bring the Axe back home.
CRUCIAL POINT
And jmu believed that it helped.
There was the Axe yell at a crucial
moment when Cal was threatening
to score.
Stanford linemen heard it. They
held.
And on the other side of the ledger
was that "Goodbye Pappy" sung to
the tune of "Goodnight Ladies."
Coach Chuck Taylor heard that
one and he didn't like it. It was
quickly atoned for, however, by a
sporting cheer for the Golden Bear
mentor.

Then it was ail over. It had really
happened, 19-0.
The goal posts came down.
The New Generation scrambled
out of the stands and crossed over
to the front of the Cal section.
A few songs were sung, the Axe
was presented, then taken safely
away by football players, sheriffs and
rally-comers.
A sullen Cal rooting section tossed
a few milk cartons, apples, empty
beer cans, eggs and cards. To please
their ego they chanted' "Wait Till
Next Year" and dispersed into the
darkening gloom.
And then you were pushing your
way through the milling crowds,
across the well-worn playing field
and out the exit. You were damn
tired, but you felt good.


SAD DAY FOR OSKIE—The Cal mascot', Oskie, had a smiling
face on the outside Saturday, but underneath....Here one of
the Cal yell leaders consoles the downhearted Bear. But even
with the help of the pretty Blue and Gold pompon girls Oskie
couldn't be calmed down. For eight years Oskie had cavorted
while the Golden Bears beat or tied Stanford's Indians and kept
the Axe. Oskie is really a Berkeley businessman who's been

Jack Churchill

following Cal's football fortunes for years. Over the years many
students and other Cal supporters have played the role —but
whoever has acted as Oskie has represented the University of
California and the Bear's spirit. Yes, Oskie was sad Saturday—
and Cal was sad. The Axe was gone, the game was lost, and
as Prince Lightfoot, Indian mascot, danced with joy, Oskie sat
on his knees, dejected. No, not even the could help.


DOWN THEY COME - The game was over, the scoreboard
read 19-0 Stanford, the Axe was ours—and so the traditional
assault on the goal posts began. It seemed as if all 91,500 fans
wanted a chunk of the wooden standards. Down on the field
they swarmed but before most of them could get there only
a few splinters were left. As usual the kiddies corps beat
everyone else to it, but Stanford roughs got their share of a

Frank Huntress

souvenir of Stanford's first Big Game victory at home since
1935, when the Vow Boys beat Cal. This was only one of the
goal posts to fall—even before game's finish, with 50 seconds
remaining, the posts at the southern end hit the dirt. Surprisingly,
no one has been reported as injured in the melees
around the goal posts. Today many a fan possesses pieces of
the goal posts of first Stanford Big Game victory in nine years.

IN THE ENEMY'S HANDS—Cal rally commers give the Bear
rooting section a look at the Axe just before kick-off Saturday.
For sixty or so minutes more Cal kept possession of the trophy,
then it was gone—to Stanford. Blue and Gold rooters weren't
too happy about the exchange but soothed themselves with
chants of, "Wait till next year" and "It took nine years."

and Cal was sad. The Axe was gone, the game was lost, and
as Prince Lightfoot, Indian mascot, danced with joy, Oskie sat
on his knees, dejected. No, not even the could help.


DOWN THEY COME - The game was over, the scoreboard
read 19-0 Stanford, the Axe was ours—and so the traditional
assault on the goal posts began. It seemed as if all 91,500 fans
wanted a chunk of the wooden standards. Down on the field
they swarmed but before most of them could get there only
a few splinters were left. As usual the kiddies corps beat
everyone else to it, but Stanford roughs got their share of a

Frank Huntress

souvenir of Stanford's first Big Game victory at home since
1935, when the Vow Boys beat Cal. This was only one of the
goal posts to fall—even before game's finish, with 50 seconds
remaining, the posts at the southern end hit the dirt. Surprisingly,
no one has been reported as injured in the melees
around the goal posts. Today many a fan possesses pieces of
the goal posts of first Stanford Big Game victory in nine years.

IN THE ENEMY'S HANDS—Cal rally commers give the Bear
rooting section a look at the Axe just before kick-off Saturday.
For sixty or so minutes more Cal kept possession of the trophy,
then it was gone—to Stanford. Blue and Gold rooters weren't
too happy about the exchange but soothed themselves with
chants of, "Wait till next year" and "It took nine years."
You pushed your way
through the milling crowds,
across the well - worn playing
field and out the exit.
Behind you thousands of red and
white clad rooters were beginning
to make their way out of Stanford
Stadium, victorious for the first time
in a generation of Big Games on a
field now covered with fans who had
seen history made that day.
It was all over. Twenty years of
frustration in the stadium had been
vindicated.
An era was dead, a new one had
been born.
You had thought about all these
things as you watched the Governor
of California hand the Axe over to
a victorious football player wearing
number 75 and a Stanford cheer
leader wearing a raccoon coat.
Now you wondered how it was
possible to describe it all—the night
before when Stanford rooters and
Stanford spirit had taken San Fran
cisco by storm, the rooting section
at the game itself, and the aftermath
of sweet triumph.
This would be a weekend to re
member.
BAND, ALUMS . . .
You would remember Big Game
eve in the City, from the Top of the
Mark down to Union Square. The
crov/ds, the band, the alums and
their partie|. . . .
How close Oskie came to losing
his head . . . the brawl in the St.
Francis as the Dirty Golden Bear
successfully eluded Stanford hunters
by ducking in the English Bar and
Grill room. . . .
The march of the Stanford Band
on Powell' Street and the rally after
wards led by the cheerleaders and
pompon girls from atop a bus. . . .
The Phi Delt "marching band"
taking the Mark Hopkins by storm,
clapping garbage can lids together
for cymbals, playifig toy trumpets
and drums, clad in weird apparel. . . .
President Wallace Sterling with a
purple lei around his neck, social
izing with the Class of '35. . . . The
devastation at the Sheraton-Palace
when Stanfordites became uninvited
guests at a Cal alumni celebra-r
tion. . . .
The 12:20 a.m. rooters train back
where it was evident that the eve
ning had taken its toll among ex
hausted but happy roughs.
MADE GAME
But they all made it to the game,
somehow or other. The stands were
filling rapidly at noon.
Everyonb was there. The band,
after a night at the hotels playing
for hospitable alumni, was in rare
form. Leader George Sheldon waved
his baton every bit as well as when
he had perched on the bar at the
Top of the Mark.
The yelling started early, and Jim
Walters was there to lead it, waving
the Axe handle.
"We want the Axe," yelled the
Stanford roughs.
"You'll get the shaft," came the
terse reply.
From then on it was an inter
change of wits and noise, with Wal
ters & Co. scoring heavily on "We
pay your tuition," "Hello, Cal Ram
blers" when the Bears took the field,'
joshings of incoherent Cal yells, and

a passel of "Hip-hip hoorays."
And then it was game time. Four
quarters of yelling your lungs out,
hoping that it would somehow help
the Big Red team on the field to
bring the Axe back home.
CRUCIAL POINT
And jmu believed that it helped.
There was the Axe yell at a crucial
moment when Cal was threatening
to score.
Stanford linemen heard it. They
held.
And on the other side of the ledger
was that "Goodbye Pappy" sung to
the tune of "Goodnight Ladies."
Coach Chuck Taylor heard that
one and he didn't like it. It was
quickly atoned for, however, by a
sporting cheer for the Golden Bear
mentor.

Then it was ail over. It had really
happened, 19-0.
The goal posts came down.
The New Generation scrambled
out of the stands and crossed over
to the front of the Cal section.
A few songs were sung, the Axe
was presented, then taken safely
away by football players, sheriffs and
rally-comers.
A sullen Cal rooting section tossed
a few milk cartons, apples, empty
beer cans, eggs and cards. To please
their ego they chanted' "Wait Till
Next Year" and dispersed into the
darkening gloom.
And then you were pushing your
way through the milling crowds,
across the well-worn playing field
and out the exit. You were damn
tired, but you felt good.

sporting cheer for the Golden Bear
mentor.

Then it was ail over. It had really
happened, 19-0.
The goal posts came down.
The New Generation scrambled
out of the stands and crossed over
to the front of the Cal section.
A few songs were sung, the Axe
was presented, then taken safely
away by football players, sheriffs and
rally-comers.
A sullen Cal rooting section tossed
a few milk cartons, apples, empty
beer cans, eggs and cards. To please
their ego they chanted' "Wait Till
Next Year" and dispersed into the
darkening gloom.
And then you were pushing your
way through the milling crowds,
across the well-worn playing field
and out the exit. You were damn
tired, but you felt good.


SAD DAY FOR OSKIE—The Cal mascot', Oskie, had a smiling
face on the outside Saturday, but underneath....Here one of
the Cal yell leaders consoles the downhearted Bear. But even
with the help of the pretty Blue and Gold pompon girls Oskie
couldn't be calmed down. For eight years Oskie had cavorted
while the Golden Bears beat or tied Stanford's Indians and kept
the Axe. Oskie is really a Berkeley businessman who's been

Jack Churchill

following Cal's football fortunes for years. Over the years many
students and other Cal supporters have played the role —but
whoever has acted as Oskie has represented the University of
California and the Bear's spirit. Yes, Oskie was sad Saturday—
and Cal was sad. The Axe was gone, the game was lost, and
as Prince Lightfoot, Indian mascot, danced with joy, Oskie sat
on his knees, dejected. No, not even the could help.


DOWN THEY COME - The game was over, the scoreboard
read 19-0 Stanford, the Axe was ours—and so the traditional
assault on the goal posts began. It seemed as if all 91,500 fans
wanted a chunk of the wooden standards. Down on the field
they swarmed but before most of them could get there only
a few splinters were left. As usual the kiddies corps beat
everyone else to it, but Stanford roughs got their share of a

Frank Huntress

souvenir of Stanford's first Big Game victory at home since
1935, when the Vow Boys beat Cal. This was only one of the
goal posts to fall—even before game's finish, with 50 seconds
remaining, the posts at the southern end hit the dirt. Surprisingly,
no one has been reported as injured in the melees
around the goal posts. Today many a fan possesses pieces of
the goal posts of first Stanford Big Game victory in nine years.

IN THE ENEMY'S HANDS—Cal rally commers give the Bear
rooting section a look at the Axe just before kick-off Saturday.
For sixty or so minutes more Cal kept possession of the trophy,
then it was gone—to Stanford. Blue and Gold rooters weren't
too happy about the exchange but soothed themselves with
chants of, "Wait till next year" and "It took nine years."
You pushed your way
through the milling crowds,
across the well - worn playing
field and out the exit.
Behind you thousands of red and
white clad rooters were beginning
to make their way out of Stanford
Stadium, victorious for the first time
in a generation of Big Games on a
field now covered with fans who had
seen history made that day.
It was all over. Twenty years of
frustration in the stadium had been
vindicated.
An era was dead, a new one had
been born.
You had thought about all these
things as you watched the Governor
of California hand the Axe over to
a victorious football player wearing
number 75 and a Stanford cheer
leader wearing a raccoon coat.
Now you wondered how it was
possible to describe it all—the night
before when Stanford rooters and
Stanford spirit had taken San Fran
cisco by storm, the rooting section
at the game itself, and the aftermath
of sweet triumph.
This would be a weekend to re
member.
BAND, ALUMS . . .
You would remember Big Game
eve in the City, from the Top of the
Mark down to Union Square. The
crov/ds, the band, the alums and
their partie|. . . .
How close Oskie came to losing
his head . . . the brawl in the St.
Francis as the Dirty Golden Bear
successfully eluded Stanford hunters
by ducking in the English Bar and
Grill room. . . .
The march of the Stanford Band
on Powell' Street and the rally after
wards led by the cheerleaders and
pompon girls from atop a bus. . . .
The Phi Delt "marching band"
taking the Mark Hopkins by storm,
clapping garbage can lids together
for cymbals, playifig toy trumpets
and drums, clad in weird apparel. . . .
President Wallace Sterling with a
purple lei around his neck, social
izing with the Class of '35. . . . The
devastation at the Sheraton-Palace
when Stanfordites became uninvited
guests at a Cal alumni celebra-r
tion. . . .
The 12:20 a.m. rooters train back
where it was evident that the eve
ning had taken its toll among ex
hausted but happy roughs.
MADE GAME
But they all made it to the game,
somehow or other. The stands were
filling rapidly at noon.
Everyonb was there. The band,
after a night at the hotels playing
for hospitable alumni, was in rare
form. Leader George Sheldon waved
his baton every bit as well as when
he had perched on the bar at the
Top of the Mark.
The yelling started early, and Jim
Walters was there to lead it, waving
the Axe handle.
"We want the Axe," yelled the
Stanford roughs.
"You'll get the shaft," came the
terse reply.
From then on it was an inter
change of wits and noise, with Wal
ters & Co. scoring heavily on "We
pay your tuition," "Hello, Cal Ram
blers" when the Bears took the field,'
joshings of incoherent Cal yells, and

a passel of "Hip-hip hoorays."
And then it was game time. Four
quarters of yelling your lungs out,
hoping that it would somehow help
the Big Red team on the field to
bring the Axe back home.
CRUCIAL POINT
And jmu believed that it helped.
There was the Axe yell at a crucial
moment when Cal was threatening
to score.
Stanford linemen heard it. They
held.
And on the other side of the ledger
was that "Goodbye Pappy" sung to
the tune of "Goodnight Ladies."
Coach Chuck Taylor heard that
one and he didn't like it. It was
quickly atoned for, however, by a
sporting cheer for the Golden Bear
mentor.

Then it was ail over. It had really

filling rapidly at noon.
Everyonb was there. The band,
after a night at the hotels playing
for hospitable alumni, was in rare
form. Leader George Sheldon waved
his baton every bit as well as when
he had perched on the bar at the
Top of the Mark.
The yelling started early, and Jim
Walters was there to lead it, waving
the Axe handle.
"We want the Axe," yelled the
Stanford roughs.
"You'll get the shaft," came the
terse reply.
From then on it was an inter
change of wits and noise, with Wal
ters & Co. scoring heavily on "We
pay your tuition," "Hello, Cal Ram
blers" when the Bears took the field,'
joshings of incoherent Cal yells, and

a passel of "Hip-hip hoorays."
And then it was game time. Four
quarters of yelling your lungs out,
hoping that it would somehow help
the Big Red team on the field to
bring the Axe back home.
CRUCIAL POINT
And jmu believed that it helped.
There was the Axe yell at a crucial
moment when Cal was threatening
to score.
Stanford linemen heard it. They
held.
And on the other side of the ledger
was that "Goodbye Pappy" sung to
the tune of "Goodnight Ladies."
Coach Chuck Taylor heard that
one and he didn't like it. It was
quickly atoned for, however, by a
sporting cheer for the Golden Bear
mentor.

Then it was ail over. It had really
happened, 19-0.
The goal posts came down.
The New Generation scrambled
out of the stands and crossed over
to the front of the Cal section.
A few songs were sung, the Axe
was presented, then taken safely
away by football players, sheriffs and
rally-comers.
A sullen Cal rooting section tossed
a few milk cartons, apples, empty
beer cans, eggs and cards. To please
their ego they chanted' "Wait Till
Next Year" and dispersed into the
darkening gloom.
And then you were pushing your
way through the milling crowds,
across the well-worn playing field
and out the exit. You were damn
tired, but you felt good.


SAD DAY FOR OSKIE—The Cal mascot', Oskie, had a smiling
face on the outside Saturday, but underneath....Here one of
the Cal yell leaders consoles the downhearted Bear. But even
with the help of the pretty Blue and Gold pompon girls Oskie
couldn't be calmed down. For eight years Oskie had cavorted
while the Golden Bears beat or tied Stanford's Indians and kept
the Axe. Oskie is really a Berkeley businessman who's been

following Cal's football fortunes for years. Over the years many
students and other Cal supporters have played the role —but
whoever has acted as Oskie has represented the University of
California and the Bear's spirit. Yes, Oskie was sad Saturday—
and Cal was sad. The Axe was gone, the game was lost, and
as Prince Lightfoot, Indian mascot, danced with joy, Oskie sat
on his knees, dejected. No, not even the could help.


DOWN THEY COME - The game was over, the scoreboard
read 19-0 Stanford, the Axe was ours—and so the traditional
assault on the goal posts began. It seemed as if all 91,500 fans
wanted a chunk of the wooden standards. Down on the field
they swarmed but before most of them could get there only
a few splinters were left. As usual the kiddies corps beat
everyone else to it, but Stanford roughs got their share of a

souvenir of Stanford's first Big Game victory at home since
1935, when the Vow Boys beat Cal. This was only one of the
goal posts to fall—even before game's finish, with 50 seconds
remaining, the posts at the southern end hit the dirt. Surprisingly,
no one has been reported as injured in the melees
around the goal posts. Today many a fan possesses pieces of
the goal posts of first Stanford Big Game victory in nine years.

IN THE ENEMY'S HANDS—Cal rally commers give the Bear
rooting section a look at the Axe just before kick-off Saturday.
For sixty or so minutes more Cal kept possession of the trophy,
then it was gone—to Stanford. Blue and Gold rooters weren't
too happy about the exchange but soothed themselves with
chants of, "Wait till next year" and "It took nine years."
