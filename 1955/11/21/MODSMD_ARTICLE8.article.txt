# Cal Students Raid Campus Friday In Violation of Non-Aggression Pact
## 
### 
The Stanford campus was raided early Friday morning by what
has been estimated by campus police as 25 to 30 carloads of students,
presumably from California.
According to Police Chief Gordon Davis, occupants of three cars
who were definitely Cal students smeared paint on statuary at the
museum, wrote "profane and obscene" words on the walls of Hoover
Tower and burned an eight foot "C" on the Stadium turf.
In addition, "C's" were painted on the doors of several fraternity
houses.
The non-aggression agreement between Stanford and California
provides that each college will enforce "severe discipline" in the event
that members of either student body raid the other campus.
Stadium groundskeepers were able to repair the damage on the field
with new grass before Big Game started Saturday. Most of the other
damage was removed Friday.
