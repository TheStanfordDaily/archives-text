# WITH RED TIE AND BLUE SUIT
## Governor Knight Excited As Alma Mater Triumphs 
### DICK MEISTER Associate Editor, The Daily 
The old alum's eyes fairly sparkled with Big Game spirit: Cali
fornia's Governor Goodwin J. Knight, class of 1919, was obviously
enjoying every minute of the 58th renewal of the Stanford-Cali
fornia classic.
Knight is governor of the UC Board of Regents but said he was

viewing Saturday's game "as a Stan
ford alumnus."
"I predicted Stanford would win
this by three touchdowns," he
proudly pointed out, smiling broadly
at tlie pick's exactness. "But," he
hurriedly added, "I also predicted a
UCLA win down south—that should
keep my regency."
Knight bubbled with enthusiasm,
joining in the Cal "Varsity Yell" and
good-naturedly joking with the
group of students who surrounded
his seat in the Bear rooting section
shouting, "We'll get the Axe back
next year 'Goodie'."
BLUE SUIT, RED TIE
Shocked at the governor's red
necktie, a Cal supporter was calmed
down with a Knight reference to
"my blue suit."
"It's good for the game not to al
ways have the same team win year
after year." We suspect there were
other reasons—those of a Stanford
alumnus—but in his precarious po
sition in the Blue and Gold section
what else could the affable Knight
say?
Even in the comparative anonym
ity of Stanford's huge stadium the
responsibilities of a chief executive
dogged Knight. During a time out
a bright-eyed political science stu
dent tapped the governor's shoulder
and asked about a page boy's job at
the capitol. Knight smilingly <ex
plained how application could be
made then turned back to the game.
1924 GAME EXCITING
The governor said he'd "probably
seen 15 Big Games." He picked the
1924 thriller as most exciting. That
was the year Stanford scored three
touchdowns in the fourth quarter to
tie Cal at 20-20.
Just five seasons before that a
Stanford rugby star named "Goodie"
Knight had his nose broken — the
mark of which he still carries.
"Today Stanford was just too
heavy in the line, too fast in the
backfield. The Golden Bears played
desparately and very courageously."
That's how Knight summed up the
game as he sat watching "the goal
post come down. "They're certainly
excited, aren't they."
After it was all over and Goodwin
J. Knight, Stanford '19, stepped for
ward to present the Axe to his Alma
Mater he said, "It was a very fine
game but because Stanford was on
top all of the time it wasn't as excit
ing as some oi ;he others I've seen."
But as he hc<nde<j| over the Axe,
the governor was victoriously beam
ing exactly as one would expect of
a Stanford man, even if on the Board
of Regents at California.
