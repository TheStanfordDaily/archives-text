Why do more college
men and women smoke
than any other
filter cigarette?
Because only Viceroy
gives you 20,000 filler traps
in every filler tip, made
from a pure natural substance
— cellulose—found in delicious
fruits and oilier edibles!
IYes, only Viceroy lias this filter composed of 20,000 liny
filter traps. ou cannot obtain the same filtering action
in any other cigarette.
2 The Viceroy filter wasn't just whipped up and rushed to
market to meet the new and skyrocketing demand for fil
tered cigarettes. Viceroy pioneered. Started research more
than 20 years ago to create the pure and perfect filter.
Smokers en masse report that filtered Viceroys have a
• P# finer flavor even than cigarettes without fillers. Rich,
satisfying, yet pleasantly mild.
4 Viceroy draws so easily that you wouldn't know, without
looking, that it even had a filter lip . . . and Viceroys cost
only a penny or two more than cigarettes without filters!
That's why more college men and women smoke VICEROYS than
j any other filter cigarette . . . that's why VICEROY is the largest
selling filter cigarette in Iho world!
