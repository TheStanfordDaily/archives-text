# Axe Awaits Theft-Proof Cabinet for Safe Display
## Handle Suggested As Booby-Prize For Loser of Big Game 
### 
With legendary and often he
i roic efforts to gain and regain
i the Axe fresh in his mind, Bill
: Tooley. student financial man
ager, announced that the Axe
will be put on display in tho
Union as soon as a theft-proof
case can be obtained.
At present the Axe is resting in
the vaults of the American Trust
Company in Palo Alto. The engraved
plaque, too large for the vault con
taining the Axe, has been detached
and placed in an equally well
guarded vault.
Tooley is checking estimates on a
new case to be used now, and, if
possible, for use in the proposed
Tressider Union when it is com
pleted next year.
EXHIBIT, MAYBE
However, the Axe may see the
light of day before a new case is
purchased and it is put on official
display. A football banquet may be
given at which the Axe will be ex
hibited, Tooley said.
At any rate the Axe itself will re
main at Stanford at least until next
year's Big Game.
But the handle is a different story.
Suggestions have been made of
sending the handle to the University
of California as a loser's trophy, ac
cording to head cheer leader Jim
Walters, but no decision has been
made.
No immediate attempts to regain
the Axe are expected from Cal. The
Cal crowd at Big Game seemed
friendly, only chanting "you have it
now—we'll have it next year," Too
ley said.
HISTORY
The Axe has a history of turbu
lence and conflict. It first appeared
at Stanford in 1896 when it. w;i .
brought out in conjunction with the
famous Axe Yell.
Since then the Axe has changed
' hands several times, the most famou
Switch being pulled by the Immortal
21 in 1930. In 1933, despite much
Stanford opposition, the Axe became
the official Big Game trophy.
A penalty of suspension 112 i o m
school was placed on anyone caught
attempting to steal the Axe for either
Cal or Stanford. But this penalty
hasn't completely wiped out theft
attempts, the most recent being
made in 1953 when the Axe was
found in Stanford team captain
Norm Manoogian's car just before
Big Game.

Switch being pulled by the Immortal
21 in 1930. In 1933, despite much
Stanford opposition, the Axe became
the official Big Game trophy.
A penalty of suspension 112 i o m
school was placed on anyone caught
attempting to steal the Axe for either
Cal or Stanford. But this penalty
hasn't completely wiped out theft
attempts, the most recent being
made in 1953 when the Axe was
found in Stanford team captain
Norm Manoogian's car just before
Big Game.
With legendary and often he
i roic efforts to gain and regain
i the Axe fresh in his mind, Bill
: Tooley. student financial man
ager, announced that the Axe
will be put on display in tho
Union as soon as a theft-proof
case can be obtained.
At present the Axe is resting in
the vaults of the American Trust
Company in Palo Alto. The engraved
plaque, too large for the vault con
taining the Axe, has been detached
and placed in an equally well
guarded vault.
Tooley is checking estimates on a
new case to be used now, and, if
possible, for use in the proposed
Tressider Union when it is com
pleted next year.
EXHIBIT, MAYBE
However, the Axe may see the
light of day before a new case is
purchased and it is put on official
display. A football banquet may be
given at which the Axe will be ex
hibited, Tooley said.
At any rate the Axe itself will re
main at Stanford at least until next
year's Big Game.
But the handle is a different story.
Suggestions have been made of
sending the handle to the University
of California as a loser's trophy, ac
cording to head cheer leader Jim
Walters, but no decision has been
made.
No immediate attempts to regain
the Axe are expected from Cal. The
Cal crowd at Big Game seemed
friendly, only chanting "you have it
now—we'll have it next year," Too
ley said.
HISTORY
The Axe has a history of turbu
lence and conflict. It first appeared
at Stanford in 1896 when it. w;i .
brought out in conjunction with the
famous Axe Yell.
Since then the Axe has changed
' hands several times, the most famou
