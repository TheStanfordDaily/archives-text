# Rally Rioting Damages Band
## 
### 
After-effects of Friday night's Biq
Game rally in San Francisco includ
ed several hundred dollars of dam
age to Stanford band instrument ,
according to George Sheldon, stu
dent band director.
Several instruments, including
trombones costing from $200 to $250,
were broken in the pre-raily melt c
with Cal students at San Francisco's
Sheraton Palace Hotel.
The band is hoping to get money
to pay for the broken instruments,
Sheldon said. But they won't pi"
anything against Cal because C;il
also received some damage. They
hope that Rally Com may possibly
be able to pay for them.
The band, sponsored by variou
alumni groups to play at their pr<
game parties, wasn't too happy with
the whole situation. Sheldon contin
ued. "We couldn't perform as sched
uled because of what happened a I
Union Squareâ€”naturally the alumni
were upset.
