# Sheriff Feels Football Pool Not Syndicate
## PCC May Investigate Dangers of Situation 
### 
The Santa Clara Sheriff's of
fice * has found indication that
the gambling pool that milched
Stanford students of $1100 dur
ing the Oregon game is not
part of a national syndicate, ac
cording to Sheriff Melvin Haw
ley.
Although there is no evidence of
a big-time syndicate, Hawley said,
there are indications that the oper
ators have access to figures for han
dicapping from out of state.
A Stanford junior varsity football
player, Tony Serra, acting as runner
for the pool on campus, was put in
a tight spot when the gambling op
erators failed to make good on bets
totaling $800 placed by Stanford,stu
dents on the Oregon game. '
PERSONAL FORFEIT
The $3300 return on these bets
never appeared, and Serra, accord
ing to the San Francisco Chronicle,
paid back the original $800 to the
bettors from his own pocket.
This was not the first instance of
organized betting at Stanford this
year. The operators moved in dur
ing the University of Southern Cali
fornia game and collected bets add
ing up to $600, but this time they
paid off $800 the following Monday.
This is the first year that large
scale organized betting has taken
place on this campus, according to
the San Francisco Examiner.
Stanford's representative to the
Pacific Coast Conference, Admis
sions Director Rixford Snyder, em
phasized the danger of a high-pres
sured syndicate invading a college
campus and exerting pressure on
team members.
NYU EXAMPLE
As an extreme example of this,
Snyder cited the New York Univer
sity basketball team of a few years
ago which was pressured bÂ«y organ
ized bookies into purposely throw
ing away points.
The problem, he said, was not in
friendly personal betting which is
entirely natural, but rather in this
betting becoming so heavy and or
ganized that it threatens the exist
ence of clean athletics on an ama
teur level.
The Pacific Coast Conference, he
said, will meet in December and in
vestigate the situation if it merits
an inquest. There has been no ac
tion taken to date, Snyder said.
STUDENT CONFESSED
Serra confessed his part in the
gambling venture to Dean of Men
William G. Craig last week.
Serra said that he had been con
tacted by two members of the bookie
group who sold him the pool cards.
The cards quoted Stanford as a six
point favorite over Oregon, and that
weekend the team went well over
the margin with a victory of 44 to 7.
Serra told Craig that the pool was
to pay off $3300, but that the money
never appeared.
