# Pappy, 'Possum- Victims of Loss
## 
### 
California rooters brutally killed
a 'possum and made its still form a
part of another Pappy Waldorf effigy
hanging following the Big Game
Saturday.
Frank J. Herron, Palo Alto deputy
pound master, said yesterday that
the 'possum's corpse was found
hanging in a tree near the Newell
Road bridge in Palo Alto Sunday
with a rope around its middle.
The dead animal was part of a
display arranged in wrath against
California's coach Waldorf. Pappy's
effigy (the second of a series) was
adorned with signs which said "I
Hate. Waldorf" and ''Nix on Wal
dorf."
Hanging from the victimized 'pos
sum was a sign "19-0."
Herron was enraged at the "bru
tality" shown to the 'possum, which,
he said, was probably still alive
when the effigy-builders hung it in
the tree.
The furry animal's jaw had been
smashed, probably by a blow from a
bludgeon of some sort. "This is one
of the worst things anybody could
do," Herron said. It's just a crime
to treat an animal that way."
