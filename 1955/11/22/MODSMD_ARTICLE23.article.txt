After Big Game a band of Stanford rooters
hoisted a raccoon - coated figure onto their
shoulders. Head Cheer Leader Jim Walters
was carried out of Stanford Stadium hero
fashion.
This was a fitting tribute to the student who
so well organized the Stanford spirit this year.
Organized it into one of it's best-ever showings.
Cheer leaders have always been distinguish
ed for their pep and boundless energy. But
Walters brought more than that to his job. He
did more than leap and holler. He thought. He
was an idea man.
He had song sheets printed in easily handled
form. These sheets revitalized many of the old
Cardnial songs, too long dormant.
The "Hell - and - Yell" Club assured trained
leaders for Stanford sections. In this Walter's
organization students were trained as assist
ants, ready to fill in when needed. Rooters
always had the best of leadership.
Walters moved the band off the field, into
the Stanford section where they belong. Where
they could see the game, and v/here rooters
could hear them better.
He was especially adept at handling touchy
situations. The UCLA air horn being a good
case in point.
And the airport rallies. Walters made cer

tain the team was sent off and welcomed home.
He let 'em know: we were behind them, home
or away.
He brought the cheer leaders down onto the
field where they could move freely, using
original routines, unhampered by a narrow
platform.
Walters stressed the leadership element of
his job. No unnecessary clowning. He cor
rectly diagnosed his job as that of leading, not
merely en'tertaining.
And may we thankfully add that he avoided
short pants —something which can be said of
few cheer leaders on the Coast.
He possessed a great sense of timing. When
the team was down and needed that lift Wal
ters was there in front of the section exhorting
his rooters.
In a university such as Stanford with players
so close to the students this is important. Those
properly timed cheers realiy help.
Walters didn't attempt to get respect wear
ing short pants, doing odd stunts. He won his
respect and his resultant support by acting as
a leader, not a showboat.
Yes, it was fitting that the student in the rac
coon coat should have been carried off the foot
ball field on fans' shoulders just as any gridiron
hero.

Walters didn't attempt to get respect wear

a leader, not a showboat.
Yes, it was fitting that the student in the rac

ball field on fans' shoulders just as any gridiron
hero.


JIM WALTERS AND THE UCLA AIR HORN
After Big Game a band of Stanford rooters
hoisted a raccoon - coated figure onto their
shoulders. Head Cheer Leader Jim Walters
was carried out of Stanford Stadium hero
fashion.
This was a fitting tribute to the student who
so well organized the Stanford spirit this year.
Organized it into one of it's best-ever showings.
Cheer leaders have always been distinguish
ed for their pep and boundless energy. But
Walters brought more than that to his job. He
did more than leap and holler. He thought. He
was an idea man.
He had song sheets printed in easily handled
form. These sheets revitalized many of the old
Cardnial songs, too long dormant.
The "Hell - and - Yell" Club assured trained
leaders for Stanford sections. In this Walter's
organization students were trained as assist
ants, ready to fill in when needed. Rooters
always had the best of leadership.
Walters moved the band off the field, into
the Stanford section where they belong. Where
they could see the game, and v/here rooters
could hear them better.
He was especially adept at handling touchy
situations. The UCLA air horn being a good
case in point.
And the airport rallies. Walters made cer
