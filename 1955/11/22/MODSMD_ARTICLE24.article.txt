The students at Brigham Young University
definitely are not happy with their football
team, which has had a miserable record in
the last few years.
On Nov. 13 the student legislature unana
mously adopted a resolution urging the Brig
ham Young University administration and
board of trustees to take action to provide a
successful football team.
The resolution stated, "We, as a legislative
body representing more than 8000 students,
make this resolution in the belief that we are
reflecting the opinion of the majority of those
students in that:
"DA successful football team adds greatly
to the stature of any university.
"2) Brigham Young University does not have
a successful football team.
"Therefore, we encourage those who are in
authority to take any action that may be deem
ed necessary to provide a football team which
will reflect on the stature of this great uni
versity."
The resolution was heartily supported by
the student body president V/id Tingey, who
asked that it be in general terms since the legis
lators held no claim to being football experts.
"The attitude of the spectators at last Friday's
football game has indicated the feelings of
this siudent body to me," Tingley said.
Large sections of the BYU cheering section
were reported to have cheered on several oc
casions for the Idaho team, and during the
second half were said to have paid more at
tention to flying paper airplanes than to the
game.
No mention was made by either Tingey or
in the resolution about the possibilities of hang
ing the football coach in effigy.

University of Connecticut students a week
ago staged a mass riot that makes the Ros
sotti's incident look like a tea party.
Less than a week after a panty raid which
saw eight students expelled, the male occu
pants of Connecticut took to burning the rema

nents of homecoming displays in front of the
fraternity houses.
The mob went on a splurge Sunday evening
burning all the displays it could find. The only
ones that were saved were those that were
defended by fraternity men by poring water
on the 1000-man mob.
By 11:40 p.m. somebody called the authori
ties and a few minutes later the fire depart
ment and the campus police marched onto fra
ternity row as one of the mob played, "When
the Saints Come Marching In" on a trumpet.
The police arrested two of the leaders. Stu
dents started rocking the police car and shout
ing, "We want justice." Fearing that their car
would be overturned, the police released the
students as the crowd roared its approval.
Displays burned for the next hour as police
were helpless. As a parting gesture the mob
turned in a false fire alarm about 1 a.m.

The wrangle over the administration-spon-;
sored constitution revision is over at the Uni
versity of Washington.
At a mass meeting students gave the neces
ary two-thirds approval to a compromise docu
ment.
The compromise gives students control over
their finances, but allows the college president
to step in when he deems it proper.
This climaxed a long struggle in which stu
dent officers accused the faculty of tyrannical :
rule and threatened to take the case to court
rather than submit to administration rule.

UCLA's famous crackerbox baskeball gym
nasium may be nearing its end.
The Los Angeles City Council voted Nov. 14
to give the Coliseum Commission its approval
to begin construction on the 22,000 capacity
sports arena adjacent to the Coliseum.
It will take 12 months for the completion of
the $7 million project. It will be ready for use
by the middle of the 1956-57 basketball season.
The structure will be utilized by SC, UCLA,
Loyola and other nearby schools for such
sports as basketball, track and gymnastics.
