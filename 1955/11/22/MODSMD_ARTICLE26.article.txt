# 'THE DESPERATE HOURS'
## March, Bogart Struggle In Nerve-Tensing Show 
### RICHARD MENDE 
From earlier days cf colonial administration there is a story
oi a distinguished Anglo-Indian civilian, who returning home
on leave after a prolonged absence, passed the Houses of Parlia
ment on his way from Victoria to Charing Cross.
"What place is that?" he asked. "That sir," the ansv/er came,

"is Parliament —the Houses of Parli
jain en t." "Really," he exclaimed,
j "does that rubbish still go on?"
Some avant - garde estheticians
j might exclaim as they pass by the
j Stanford Theatre, where a melo-

drama, "The Des
perate Hours" is
being featured,
j "Does that rub
! bish still go on?"
| % If they venture
inside, however,
they will see one
of the neatest
J pieces of movie-

! making to come along in some time,
; and see why the novel and stage
play were great successes.
THREE DESPERADOES
The stcny concerns what happens
when three desperadoes descend on
a typical middle-class household.
There is the utter futility of a fa
ther's authority when he says, "Stop
pointing that gun at her." (his wife)
And the infuriating accusation of the
\ headstrong 10-year-old boy, "You're
afraid." The tension mounts as a
: struggle develops between the father
j and the mob leader.
The acting is all outstanding with
Fredric March as the tight-lipped
I courageous father and Martha Scott
! giving a remarkably fine perform -
j ance as his wife. Humphrey Bogart

►
as the mob leader, is even able to
make it seem plausible, after a fash
ion, that an escaping gangster might
hang around just to vent his hatred
on society.
CAMERA CATCHES
The camera catches the new
meaning of everyday activities under
the stress of imminent murder; there
is a fascination in watching such
ordinary activities as breakfast, or
the ash-man making an ordinary
stop on his rounds.
Occasionally a false note creeps
into the picture, especially when it
deviates into the realms of philoso
phy where it sounds like a polemic
ior the middle-class way of life.
Example: kid brother crook says
to leader crook, "You ttiught me
everything except how to live in a
house like this."
But that sort of thing won't keep
you from hanging on to the edge of
your chair in this nerve-tensing,
suspenseful Jittle movie.

everything except how to live in a
house like this."
But that sort of thing won't keep
you from hanging on to the edge of
your chair in this nerve-tensing,
suspenseful Jittle movie.

From earlier days cf colonial administration there is a story
oi a distinguished Anglo-Indian civilian, who returning home
on leave after a prolonged absence, passed the Houses of Parlia
ment on his way from Victoria to Charing Cross.
"What place is that?" he asked. "That sir," the ansv/er came,

"is Parliament —the Houses of Parli
jain en t." "Really," he exclaimed,
j "does that rubbish still go on?"
Some avant - garde estheticians
j might exclaim as they pass by the
j Stanford Theatre, where a melo-

drama, "The Des
perate Hours" is
being featured,
j "Does that rub
! bish still go on?"
| % If they venture
inside, however,
they will see one
of the neatest
J pieces of movie-

! making to come along in some time,
; and see why the novel and stage
play were great successes.
THREE DESPERADOES
The stcny concerns what happens
when three desperadoes descend on
a typical middle-class household.
There is the utter futility of a fa
ther's authority when he says, "Stop
pointing that gun at her." (his wife)
And the infuriating accusation of the
\ headstrong 10-year-old boy, "You're
afraid." The tension mounts as a
: struggle develops between the father
j and the mob leader.
The acting is all outstanding with
Fredric March as the tight-lipped
I courageous father and Martha Scott
! giving a remarkably fine perform -
j ance as his wife. Humphrey Bogart

►
as the mob leader, is even able to
make it seem plausible, after a fash
ion, that an escaping gangster might
hang around just to vent his hatred
on society.
CAMERA CATCHES
The camera catches the new
meaning of everyday activities under
the stress of imminent murder; there
is a fascination in watching such
ordinary activities as breakfast, or
the ash-man making an ordinary
stop on his rounds.
Occasionally a false note creeps
into the picture, especially when it
deviates into the realms of philoso
phy where it sounds like a polemic
ior the middle-class way of life.
Example: kid brother crook says
to leader crook, "You ttiught me
everything except how to live in a
house like this."
