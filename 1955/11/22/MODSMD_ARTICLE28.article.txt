# ABC Man Victim Of Effigy Hanging
## 
### 
There was another effigy hanging
last weekend. No, it wasn't Pappy
Waldorf. It wasn't even a football
coach.
It was Frank Fullenwider, area
administrator for the Department of
Alcoholic Beverage Control.
A dummy of Fullenwider—bearing
signs "ABC, R. I. P." and "Long Live
Rossotti's"—hung over the road in
front of the Phi Sigma Kappa frater
nity house Friday afternoon when
the campus-bound traffic returning
from the "Bear Bust" was heavy.
