STANFORD 1!). CALIFORNIA ()
Even though this was the Big Game, the contest ran true to form as
Stanford was favored by three touchdowns and won by just that.
The victory was routine as Stanford's superiority was evident from |
beginning to end.
The game was highlighted by the remarkable passing of quarterbacks
John Brodie and Jack Douglas. Brodie connected 14 times in 19 attempts
while Douglas hit on five of his seven passes. The two combined during
one stretch to hurl 12 successive completions.
Thus the Indians, despite a slow start, finished the season with a fine
6-3-1 record.
The Tribe picked up two notable victories in whipping Ohio State, who
Saturday clinched the Big Ten championship, and in surprising strong
USC, 28-20.
Stanford really got rolling during the last four games with successive
wins over San Jose State, Southern Cal, Oregon and Cal. And the Indians
have the returning material to keep that momentum going next season.
Returning are quarterbacks Brodie and Douglas, hall backs Paul Camera,
Gordy Young, Lou Valli, Jeri McMillin and Bill Burget and fullbacks A 1
Harrington, Jack Taylor and Mickey Raftery.
Back to bolster the forward wall are guards Donn Carswell and Noel
Robinson, tackles Paul Wiggin, Don Manoukian and the injured Chris
Plain, ends Jerry Beatie, Gary Van Galder and Carl Isaacs and center Russ
Steele who was laid up the entire season with injuries.
With a good start and just a normal run of good breaks, the Indians
may well be in the Rose Bowl come Jan. 1, 1957.
UCLA 17. SOUTHERN CAL 7
This was almost a personal victory for UCLA aces Sam First Down
Brown and Bob Davenport. The two, between them, gained 278 of UCLA's
total 295 yards.
Southern Cal got a brutal break when an offside penalty nullified Jon
Arnett's 97-yard return of the game's opening kickoff.
With passer Ronnie Knox sitting out the game with a broken ankle,
the Bruins attempted only two aerials, both of which were complete.
USC coach Jess Hill declared that the Bruins are not as strong as last
year and also said that UCLA was not necessarily the best team Southern
Cal has faced this year. He said that Stanford now would give UCLA a
real battle.
The Bruins clinched the Rose Bowl bid and won their third straight
PCC title by virtue of the victory.
UCLA has now gone undefeated in conference play for two years. Their
last conference ioss was to Stanford, 21-20, in 1953.
The Bruins were handicapped by the loss of Knox Saturday. They will
need him in the Rose Bowl to keep powerful Michigan State loosened up
by a sharp passing attack.
Stanford coach Chuck Taylor, the only coach to face both UCLA and
Michigan State this season, has said that Michigan State has the better
offense while UCLA has the better defense.
It should be a wild game especially since UCLA will be burning for
revenge after their 28-20 loss to MSC two years ago in the Rose Bowl.
OREGON 28, OREGON STATE 0
Oregon State finally got dumped, but it took a team that made no
mistakes to do it.
The Beavers were thoroughly beaten but still retained second place
in the conference with a 5-2 record.
Oregon by winning took fourth place in the final standings to give the
Oregon schools their best representation in the standings in many years.
Oregon State which had depended so much on pass interceptions and
fumble recoveries for scoring opportunities throughout the season found
that Oregon would not co-operate. The Ducks did not lose the ball once
on a fumble and threw only four passes, none of which were intercepted.
The closest Oregon State got to Oregon's' goal line was to the Oregon
37 whereas the Ducks kept alive lour long drives that resulted in touch
downs.
Oregon gained 344 yards and got 23 first downs compared to the Staters
77 yards and five first downs.
WASHINGTON 27, WASHINGTON STATE 7
Washington halfback Credell "Incredible" Green finally lived up to
his nickname as the Huskies finished an up and down season with an
impressive victory.
Green ran for a total of 258 yards—a national high this season—and
scored on runs of 18 and 50 yards.
Unbelievably enough. Green's 18-yard scoring run was the first time
in 41 games that Washington has scored on a rushing play longer than
17 yards. That's all the way back to the days of Hugh McElhenny.
Perhaps another McElhenny is budding in Seattle.

UCLA 17. SOUTHERN CAL 7
This was almost a personal victory for UCLA aces Sam First Down
Brown and Bob Davenport. The two, between them, gained 278 of UCLA's
total 295 yards.
Southern Cal got a brutal break when an offside penalty nullified Jon
Arnett's 97-yard return of the game's opening kickoff.
With passer Ronnie Knox sitting out the game with a broken ankle,
the Bruins attempted only two aerials, both of which were complete.
USC coach Jess Hill declared that the Bruins are not as strong as last
year and also said that UCLA was not necessarily the best team Southern
Cal has faced this year. He said that Stanford now would give UCLA a
real battle.
The Bruins clinched the Rose Bowl bid and won their third straight
PCC title by virtue of the victory.
UCLA has now gone undefeated in conference play for two years. Their
last conference ioss was to Stanford, 21-20, in 1953.
The Bruins were handicapped by the loss of Knox Saturday. They will
need him in the Rose Bowl to keep powerful Michigan State loosened up
by a sharp passing attack.
Stanford coach Chuck Taylor, the only coach to face both UCLA and
Michigan State this season, has said that Michigan State has the better
offense while UCLA has the better defense.
It should be a wild game especially since UCLA will be burning for
revenge after their 28-20 loss to MSC two years ago in the Rose Bowl.
OREGON 28, OREGON STATE 0
Oregon State finally got dumped, but it took a team that made no
mistakes to do it.
The Beavers were thoroughly beaten but still retained second place
in the conference with a 5-2 record.
Oregon by winning took fourth place in the final standings to give the
Oregon schools their best representation in the standings in many years.
Oregon State which had depended so much on pass interceptions and
fumble recoveries for scoring opportunities throughout the season found
that Oregon would not co-operate. The Ducks did not lose the ball once
on a fumble and threw only four passes, none of which were intercepted.
The closest Oregon State got to Oregon's' goal line was to the Oregon
37 whereas the Ducks kept alive lour long drives that resulted in touch
downs.
Oregon gained 344 yards and got 23 first downs compared to the Staters
77 yards and five first downs.
WASHINGTON 27, WASHINGTON STATE 7
Washington halfback Credell "Incredible" Green finally lived up to
his nickname as the Huskies finished an up and down season with an
impressive victory.
Green ran for a total of 258 yards—a national high this season—and
scored on runs of 18 and 50 yards.
Unbelievably enough. Green's 18-yard scoring run was the first time
in 41 games that Washington has scored on a rushing play longer than
17 yards. That's all the way back to the days of Hugh McElhenny.
Perhaps another McElhenny is budding in Seattle.
STANFORD 1!). CALIFORNIA ()
Even though this was the Big Game, the contest ran true to form as
Stanford was favored by three touchdowns and won by just that.
The victory was routine as Stanford's superiority was evident from |
beginning to end.
The game was highlighted by the remarkable passing of quarterbacks
John Brodie and Jack Douglas. Brodie connected 14 times in 19 attempts
while Douglas hit on five of his seven passes. The two combined during
one stretch to hurl 12 successive completions.
Thus the Indians, despite a slow start, finished the season with a fine
6-3-1 record.
The Tribe picked up two notable victories in whipping Ohio State, who
Saturday clinched the Big Ten championship, and in surprising strong
USC, 28-20.
Stanford really got rolling during the last four games with successive
wins over San Jose State, Southern Cal, Oregon and Cal. And the Indians
have the returning material to keep that momentum going next season.
Returning are quarterbacks Brodie and Douglas, hall backs Paul Camera,
Gordy Young, Lou Valli, Jeri McMillin and Bill Burget and fullbacks A 1
Harrington, Jack Taylor and Mickey Raftery.
Back to bolster the forward wall are guards Donn Carswell and Noel
Robinson, tackles Paul Wiggin, Don Manoukian and the injured Chris
Plain, ends Jerry Beatie, Gary Van Galder and Carl Isaacs and center Russ
Steele who was laid up the entire season with injuries.
With a good start and just a normal run of good breaks, the Indians

Oregon State finally got dumped, but it took a team that made no
mistakes to do it.
The Beavers were thoroughly beaten but still retained second place
in the conference with a 5-2 record.
Oregon by winning took fourth place in the final standings to give the
Oregon schools their best representation in the standings in many years.
Oregon State which had depended so much on pass interceptions and
fumble recoveries for scoring opportunities throughout the season found
that Oregon would not co-operate. The Ducks did not lose the ball once
on a fumble and threw only four passes, none of which were intercepted.
The closest Oregon State got to Oregon's' goal line was to the Oregon
37 whereas the Ducks kept alive lour long drives that resulted in touch
downs.
Oregon gained 344 yards and got 23 first downs compared to the Staters
77 yards and five first downs.
WASHINGTON 27, WASHINGTON STATE 7
Washington halfback Credell "Incredible" Green finally lived up to
his nickname as the Huskies finished an up and down season with an
impressive victory.
Green ran for a total of 258 yards—a national high this season—and
scored on runs of 18 and 50 yards.
Unbelievably enough. Green's 18-yard scoring run was the first time
in 41 games that Washington has scored on a rushing play longer than
17 yards. That's all the way back to the days of Hugh McElhenny.
Perhaps another McElhenny is budding in Seattle.
