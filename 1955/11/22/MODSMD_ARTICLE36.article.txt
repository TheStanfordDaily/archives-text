## 
### JIM PRICE 
SAE I moved to a methodical 26-0
victory over Cedro II in the first
round of the intra-mural football
playoffs. Ray Young and Bob Dwight
paced the win which eliminated Ce
dro II from the playoffs and moved
the SAE gridders into the next
round of the single elimination play
offs.
Tailback Young figured in all four
SAE touchdowns as he hurled passes
for two touchdowns and raced nine
and 25 yards on the ground for the
other two scores. Dwight, besides
being one of Young's principle re
ceivers, was a defensive standout,
intercepting three Cedro passes.
Each team failed to move the ball
on their first series of downs, but
the powerful SAE squad, now unde
feated in seven games, began to
move on their second try. Young's
first down pass which traveled near
ly 60 yards in the air was dropped
on Cedro's three yard line, but then
he got the yards back in five plays
by running for a 17 yard first down
and completing four straight passes.
After a short toss to Tom Watson
had set up the score on the seven,
Young flipped the TD pass to Bernie
Nelson and passed to Jack Adams
for the extra point. Watson also
played a major part in the second
touchdown when he blocked a Cedro
punt and an SAE man fell on the
ball on the Cedro 17 yard line. Two
plays later, Young scampered across
the goal from nine yards away and
passed for the conversion.
Young ran 25 yards for the third
score and lobbed a one yard aerial
to Jack Van Bergen for the final
telly in the last minute of the game.
