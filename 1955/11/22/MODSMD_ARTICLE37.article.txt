# Michigan State, UCLA to Meet In New Year's Day Grid Classic
## 
### 
The run for the roses is over. |
It's UCLA versus Michigan State
in the Rose Bowl next Jan. 2.
These are the two teams that
met in the 1954 Rose Bowl game
with Michigan State, led by Billy
Wells and Leßoy Bolden, whip
ping the Bruins and Paul Cam
eron, 28-20.
Michigan State's winning of the
bid was a definite surprise ii" one
goes by the predictions of pre-season
experts. However, even the Spartan
pressbook noted that MSC would
probably end up in the middle of
the Big Ten race.
But the team that won only one
conference game last season turned
around and lost only one this year
to win the bid. The Spartans, rated

third nationally, did not win the
Big Ten championship, however —
that honor going to Ohio State, but
Ihe two teams did not meet this year.
UCLA, rated fourth, was figured
by many experts to take the national
championship this year, but an early
season loss to Maryland ruined the
Bruins' chances for that honor.
That was UCLA's only loss during
the year, and Michigan State's only
loss was to then powerful Michigan.
The Rose Bowl game should be a
humdinger this year.
