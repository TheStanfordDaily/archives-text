"There are only about as many
active citizens as there are active
criminals in the United States," Dr.
Alfred de Grazia of the Political
Science Department points out in
the new book. "Research Frontiers

One of the gravest problems con
fronting democracies is developing a
large enough supply of ordinai'y
citizen leaders in the community and
nation, he said. v
Another conclusion he draws is
that most people who ultimately
vote in a presidential election have
their minds made up before the can
didates begin their campaigns.
"Those who make up their minds
after the nominating convention, un
der ordinary circumstances, number
enough votes to win an election, de
spite the 'premature' deciders," Dr.
de Grazia goes on to say. "This is
especially true if there is a heavy
turnout on election day, because the
nonvoters are more neutral and non
partisan in attitude than the rest, on
the whole."
