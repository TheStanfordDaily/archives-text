# Federal Employment Case to Be Heard
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€”The Supreme
Court today agreed to decide wheth
er the Federal Government may fire
an employe as a security risk even
though he has nothing to do with
defense secrets.
The case was brought by Kenrick
M. Cole, former New York food and
drug inspector, who was ousted as a
security risk from the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare in
1953.
Cole was accused of associating
with Communists and belonging to
the Nature Friends of America, an
organization on the Attorney Gen
eral's list.
A security risk under present def
initions may be a drunkard, a loose
talker, a sexual pervert or any other
person who might reveal secret- in
formation through carelessness or
under pressure of blackmail.
