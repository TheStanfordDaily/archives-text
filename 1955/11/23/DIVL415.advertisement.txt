HOW TO BE A BMOC
Any man who wishes to be a BMOC«-you show me one who
doesn't and I'll show you a misspent youth—will do well to fol
low the few simple rules listed below.
The first requisite of a BMOC is, of course, a letter in athletics.
This presents no great problem to the big, the strong, and the
hulking. But what do you do if you are a puny little chap with
a concave chest and muscles like tallow?
I'll tell you what you do: You go to the nearest letter store,
buy a letter, sew it on your sweater, and wear it.
This, perhaps, is not
strictly ethical, but chances
s/r/f are slim that anybody will
\ * question you about it. If
someone should, you have a
0\ tion. Simply say, "That '1'
\ 1 * \nn my sweater does not
y stand for 'lowa.' It stands
I*4/1 J 'I'' does not stand for
'Princeton.' It stands for
'W&L' does not stand for
/ / 'Washington and Lee.' It
OCMOke? ' stands for 'Withered and
Lumpy.'". . . Or, "That
'BG' does not stand for 'Bowling Green.' It stands for 'Badly
Gangrenous.'"
So, you see, getting the letter-sweater is no large task. But that
is only a part of BMOC-hood. Another, and equally important,
part is to join the right fraternity. Let me emphasize—the right
fraternity. Joining the wrnvg fraternity is worse than joining
no fraternity at all.
How can you be sure that the fraternity you join : s the right
one? Very simply. Just ask ihe rushing chairman. After all
why should he lie to you?

lished in the right frater

school — Hardtack Sigafoos
by name — did just that. After several semesters he discovered
to his surprise that he loved the girl. Today they are happily
married and run one of the biggest Turkish baths in Ida
Grove, lowa.)
We arrive now at the question: What does a BMOC smoke?
And the answer is —new Philip Morris, of corris!
Anybody—big man on campus or little man, big woman or
little woman- anybody who is able to discern between harsh and
gentle chooses new Philip Morris. Gentle is the word for Philip
Morris. (Actually, of course, it isn't, (cigarette is the word for
Philip Morris.) But gentle describes admirably the felicitous
blending, the smooth, mild, pleasureful flavor, the nobly born
and delicately nurtured tobaccos, that Philip Morris and onlv
Philip Morris—brings you.
