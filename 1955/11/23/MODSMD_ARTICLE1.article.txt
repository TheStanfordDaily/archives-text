# Daniel's Voice Pure But Lacks Training
## 
### STEW TOY 
Ruth Daniel's singing at Monday
night's Concert Series was young,
pure and pleasant enough—if some
what unsure at first.
Her voice had the sweetness and
quality of natural talent and showed,
in its more candid moments, her in
tuitive grasp of the essence of a
great variety of musical types.
But to understand music and to
have the ability to execute it in ac
cordance with this understanding are
quite different things.
Miss Daniel tried hard to break
through the barrier of mere unde
veloped talent to the husky elo
quence of operatic sureness.
She tried so hard that her young
voice simply could not take it, and
the result often sounded like the
wheezy thinness of a loosely-stopped
piccolo.
Her best efforts were those which
required no projection, when the
soft, Negroid sweetness of her voice
carried the song with plaintive emo
tion.
SPIRITUALS
Such successes were her rendi
tions of five Negro spirituals, at once
gay and moving.
Miss Daniel often seemed to sing
frdm her own feelings and for her
own pleasure.

She has said, "Music fills a need
in my life. I find expression and re
lease through singing in ways I
cannot express."
This subjectivity was especially
noticeable in the four songs by
Henry Purcell, in which, possibly
through nervousness, her voice was
thin and somewhat colorless.
She gave her best performances in
"Hear Ye, Israel" from Mendels
sohn's "Elijah," and "In Questa Reg
gia" from Puccini's "Turandot."
SUBTLE POWER'
Operatic though they were, Miss
Daniel managed to substitute quiet,
subtle power for projection. The
arias were thus stirring and alto
gether enjoyable.
Her accompanist, William Corbett
Jones, played the usual melange of
diverting little piano pieces (Scar
latti, Bartok, et al.).
Jones had technical polish, but
little else. His Scarlatti was espe
cially mechanical — even for Scar
latti.
The Bartok seemed to have been
chosen mainly for its weirdness,
which can often cover a lack of sen
sitivity on the performer's part.
Miss Daniel sang three encores,
"Summertime," "He's Got the Whole
World in His Hands" and "Let Us
Break Bread Together."
