### 
LONDON, Nov. 22 (UP)—The
Soviets announced today they
have executed six followers of
the late secret police chief Lav- 1
renti P. Beria in a new blood
purge in Stalin's native province
of Georgia.
The announcement broadcast by
radio Tiflis, in the capital of the
Georgian Soviet republic, abruptly
ended any notions that such purges
had been ruled out by the new Bul
ganin-Khrushchev regime.
The broadcast said the six men,
including top secret police officials,
were shot following a treason trial
in September. The date of the exe
cutions was not revealed.
The purged officials were charged
with "high treason, terrorist acts and j
participation in counter-revolution- j
ary organizations."
They also were accused of acting
as strong arm men for Beria, carry
ing out his plots, covering up his
misdeeds and framing his enemies.
Three of the executed men were
former Georgian cabinet members.
The others were interrogators for
the dreaded NKVD, the Soviet secret
police.
It was the biggest Soviet purge j
since Beria himself was fired during
the regime of Georgi Malenkov and
shot in December, 1953, for allegedly
plotting against the government and j
the Soviet Communist system.
It also brought to 10 the number
of Beria accomplices shot since last
December in the southern republic
of Georgia—home of both Beria and
the late Josef Stalin.
