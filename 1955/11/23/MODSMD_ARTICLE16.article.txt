LONDON â€” The British Foreign
| Office called Soviet Premier Nikolai
' Bulganin a hypocrite today in the
strongest blast against the Russians
since the disappearance of the "Ge
neva spirit" born at last summer's
summit conference.
The foreign office took off its dip
lomatic kid gloves to deliver a sting
ing reply to Bulganin's speech in
New Delhi yesterday accusing the
West of backsliding in the search for
peace.
An official British spokesman told
a news conference the Soviet leader
was being "thoroughly hypocritical"
in claiming Russia is pursuing a
hands-off policy in German affairs.
He also said Bulganin's charges
that the West was dragging its feet
on disarmament were "quite un
true."
Not since the summit, conference
relaxed East-West tension had such
a biting official statement come out
of the foreign office. It seemed to
signal clearly that Britain believes
the futile Big Four foreign ministers'
conference had justified a tougher
approach to the Soviets.
