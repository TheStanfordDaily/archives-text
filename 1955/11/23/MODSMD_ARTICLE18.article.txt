## 
### BOB MIEROW 
"The world bank aids underdeveloped countries, providing
capital for production purposes," declared Elmer G. Burland, capi
tal markets advisor for the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, last night.
Burland, speaking before a Tuesday Evening Series audience

at Memorial Auditorium, said that
the bank creates a higher standard
of living for the people within its
limits.
One of the affiliated agencies of
the United Nations, the International
Bank has as one of its main purposes
to stimulate international co-opera
tion, he pointed out.
The world bank loans out money
throughout the underdeveloped sec
tors of the world. The loans are
given both to governments and to
private firms which governments
have guaranteed.
SPECIFIC PURPOSES
Electric power, transportation and
communication, agriculture and in
dustry receive the most aid from the
world bank. The loans are given for
specific purposes, Burland "stated.
The International Bank was start
ed in 1946 and includes 56 member
nations. It is now worth over nine
billion dollars. Of the subscriptions
which the member nations have giv
en, 35 per cent was made available
by the United States.
The bank is run by a Board of
Governors, one from each member
state. A Board of Directors sets
down definite policy and carries it
out, according to Burland.
Although a member of UN, the
bank reserves the right to make or
turn down loans as they desire, he
mentioned.
TECHNICAL ADVICE
The bank gives technical advice to
the nations that receive their loans.
Since the bank often administers the
jobs which are done through the
loan, many states raise objections,
believing their internal sovereignty
has been interfered with.
"Some delicate situations have
Arisen," Bui-Land said.
The white-haired speaker showed
that the bank is more than self
supporting by declaring that it gains
a profit of approximately twenty
million dollars per year.
The bank is about to begin a com
plementary organization, the Inter
national Finance Corporation, ac
cording to Burland. The IFC will
participate with and encourage pri
vate capital in its aid to underdevel
oped areas.
