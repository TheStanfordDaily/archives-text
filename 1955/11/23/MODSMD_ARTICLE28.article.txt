# names in the news
## 
### 
In recent weeks The Daily has printed stories
dealing with Stanford students who have ad
mitted violating the law. One of these cases
v7G.it to Men's Council; two clhcrs were han
dled by the Dean of Students' Office.
In all three cases. The Daily printed ihe
names of '.lie students involved. We have been
asked why the names were used and what our
policy is in such matters.
Let's take Men's Council cases first. Nor
mally, The Daily does not use the names of
students who appear before Men's or Wom
en's Council on Fundamental S'.andard viola
tions or before the joint body, the "Judicial
Council, on Honor Code violations.
A Daily reporter usually attends the hear
ings and reports the violation and the punish
ment. This serves to educate the students on
the policy of the councils.
But the names of the students, whether found
guilty or not, are confidential. This is a basic
University policy with regard to disciplinary
matters. It allows a student to be reinstated
in the University and to resume a normal life
without a "record" hanging over his head.
Generally, The Daily follows Ihis procedure.
The name of the student is not used in the
story. But when the student's name is part
of the public record and is public knowledge,
then we use the name.
Thus the name of Jerome Jeffries, who ad
mitted drinking under age at Rossotti's, was
printed. A warrant had been sworn out for his
arrest; his name was released by the Alcoholic
Beverage Control Department and was used by
the local press.
S'milarly, v/e printed the name of the hit
and-run driver, which was released by Chief
Davis, and the name of the student agent in
the fociball pool, which became public knowl
edge and was ussd in the press.
Essentially, The Daily tries to be a news
paper, to inform the students as completely as
possible, to print the news which interests
them.

Suppressing news is not an aspect of that
job. II The Daily had a reputation for sup
pressing news, the students then could not
rely on their primary news source for the in
formation they need. Once suppression be
gins, where does it end?
In relation to this, it might be wel! to point
out that The Daily is not dictated to by the ad
ministration. We determine the news we will
print, where we will print it and what we will
say about it.
Because The Daily is a University newspa
per, we are not as independent as a metropoli
tan daily. But we are virtually independent.
Admittedly, we do not print everything we
know; we do not break confidences. If we did
not respect "off the record" information, we
would lose our news sources.
With respect to printing news, we feel that
one of , our most important jobs is clarifying
rumor. In a compact community such as this,
misinformation circulates rapidly. The Daily
seeks facts and corroboration so that the stu
dents will bd aware of the situation as it really
is, not as it is purported to be.
In summary, we repeat that The Daily is es
sentially a newspaper. Thus our job is to print
the news as completely and factually as pos
sible. That is our fundamental policy.
