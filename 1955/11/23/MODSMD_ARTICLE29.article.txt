# a 						strange sight

### 
We've got a parking problem. It's simple:
not enough parking places to go around.
Yet take a close look and you'll see a strange
sight; one car occupying two diagonal parking
places. And it's a common occurrence.
Campus police give few tickets for this of
fense. And the parking problem mounts and
mounts.
Why not park 'em between the two lines.
And how about the police keeping ihe ticket
books handy?
It might help the problem.
