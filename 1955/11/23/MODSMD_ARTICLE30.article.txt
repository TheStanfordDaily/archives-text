Democratic and Republican hats are flying
into the political ring, and in less than one year
the nation will choose the men who will lead
the country for the next two to four years.
But will you have a hand in choosing these
men?
Have the 18. 19 and 20-year olds reached
an age where they are mature enough to qual
ify for a vote in national elections?
This is a question that has bothered young
and older persons alike, especially in the past
few years when the international situation has
demanded ihat persons between the ages of
18 and 21 devote considerable time and pos
sibly their lives to a defense of their country
when they do not have a direct voice in the
formation of its policies.
Many argue that 18 is too young, that three
more years of maturation and education are
necessary before these persons can become
qualified judges of governmental policies.
On the other hand, others call to mind the
war-time axiom that "if you're old enough to
fight, you're old enough to vote."
They argue that laws creating minimum
voting age of 21 have been on state statute
records for many, many years, and 4 hat since
these laws were passed, the scope of educa
tioh"has been broadened to the whole level
of the population and greater demands have
been put on the youth of the country to pre
vent the United States from tasting her first
defeat from a foreign power.
Students graduating from high school at the
ages of 17 or 18 will enter college, the armed
services or some occupation, and many feel
that these citizens who are subject to military
induction, are civilly and criminally responsi
ble for their own actions, and are considered
as adults in civil service appointment and so
cial security, deserve as great a voice in gov
ernment as their immediate elders.
Backing this segment of opinion, President

Eisenhower in his State of the Union message
in 1953 asked Congress to reduce the voting
age to 18, saying that:
"For years our citizens between the ages of
18 and 20 have in time of peril been summoned
to fight for America. They should participate
in the political process that produces this fate
ful summons. I urge Congress to propose to
the states a Constitutional amendment permit
ting citizens to vote when they reach the age
of 18."
But Congressional proposals following Eis
enhower's request were as unsuccessful as
those preceding it. In March, 1954, a bill pro
posing the amendment was introduced into the
Senate and two months later the bill was killed,
failing to pass by five votes short of the neces
sary two-thirds majority.
The bill was caught in the middle of the row
over states' rights, the states' righters arguing
that this would be a formidable invasion of a
power rightfully belonging to the states.
This power has always belonged to the
states, and only Georgia permits 18-year olds
to vote.
It seems unlikely that the Senate can propose
such an amendment unless the strong opposi
tion of the Southern Democrats can be over
come.
It is also highly unlikely that the necessary
approval by three-fourths of the states can be
marshaled for the amendment until the South
backs down from its strong states' rights stand
on the issue.
But laws can be instituted by the states indi
vidually, as Georgia has done.
It is possible that Presidential advice will
become legal fact if citizens become convinced
that the present situation demands that the
6,330,000 citizens between 18 and 20 be al
lowed to share in the evaluation and formation
of governmental action.
