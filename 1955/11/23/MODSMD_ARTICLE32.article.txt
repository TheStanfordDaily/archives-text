# 2000-Year-Old American Art Objects Now on Display in Stanford Museum
## Pre-Columbian Jewels, Figures, Pottery From Stendhal Collection 
### 
A large number of pre-Colum
bian art objects is now on dis
play at the Stanford Museum
and will remain there until
Dec. 31.
The art objects were created dur- i
ing the two thousand year period j
from 500 B.C. to 1500 A.D. in Mexico
and Central America. Although this j
was a period of great warfare, it was i
also one of great artistic develop- .
rnent.
On exhibit are samples of deco
rated pottery, small terra cotta fig
urines, objects from burials, carved
stone, and jade and gold ornaments
believed to have been jewelry.
Many of the figurines on display
are made of hollow clay, both red |
and buff, and are painted with yel- j
low, black or white decorations.
There are a few stone carvings,
mostly in the shape of the human I
figure.
UTENSILS
The utensils, such as vases and
grinding stones, take the form of
animals. These utensils along with
stone yokes have been found in
burial sites and are of interest to the ;
archaeologist as well as the artist.
Included in the collection are four
polychrome dishes done in black, j
red, white and purple on red clay
and red, orange and black designs on j
tan clay.

dhal collection, has traveled all over
