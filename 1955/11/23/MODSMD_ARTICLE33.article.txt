# Violent Death Is Theme Of Frank 'Wages of Fear'
## 
### RICHARD MENDE 
A substantial portion of "Wages of Fear," a film which has
been heaped with av/ards as well as censored, scissored and sup
pressed is now at the Guild.
, Objection to the film has grown from its frank trealment of
sex (not unknown in French films) and its unfavorable view of
the effects of American capital*

abroad.
Its most arresting feature, how
ever, is not controversial; it is a
photographic account of the trans
portation of nitroglycerin over 300
miles of treacherous South Ameri
can roads. Four drivers steel them
selves against the idea of sudden
death; but they are hounded by fear.
Explosion seems imminent at ev
ery moment, when they are grimly
trying to overcome an obstacle in

the road, when
they are careless
ly or calculatingly
trying to relax,
when they are fa
talistically playing
pranks w i th the
truck.
Yet so central is
the idea of violent

death, so total and so prolonged is
the atmosphere of suspense and fear,
that other aspects of drama are over
shadowed.
It is true that the characters begin
to reveal themselves as people as the
tension tightens. The intense pres
sure brings out hidden qualities of
courage, of cowardice, of greed and
affection. But one feels that it is not
individual, real men that are in
volved, but a common denominator.
It is the idea of violent death that
captures interest.
For example, Mario, one of the
unhappy collection of down and out
ers, is portrayed as the soul of un
selfishness with an immense love for
his fellows. Yet as one of the vic
tims of capitalist greed, he is re
quired to cause the death of his
closest friend.
All this does not condone the cen
sorship of this film whose ideas are

worthy of consideration. Nor be
cause it falls short of complete dra
matic achievement is the fact altered
that "Wages of Fear" maintains ,a
suspense that leaves t one virtually
exhausted.
