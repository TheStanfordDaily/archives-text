### JOHN MOE 
With a strong forward wall to give him protection Bill Hinchy
passed Kappa Sig I to a decisive 19 to 6 victory over Ravens
wood in an intramural playoff contest yesterday.
It was a question cf a team against one player. The player was
a little speedburner by the name of John Ching of the Ravens-

wood club. The fleetfooted tailback*
gave his team their only touchdown
on a 45 yard runback of an inter
cepted pass behind a key block by
George "Hoot" Gibson and also made
several nice runs.
KAPPA SIG SCORE
The Kappa Sigs drew first blood
on a pass to Ted Shipkey who took I
the ball behind Ching and went into [
paydirt untouched. The PAT was j
good' on a pass to Tom Talbot.
Ching put his team right back in
the game with his interception, but
Tony Holzauer kept it at 7 to 6,
nailing Dave Pollack behind the line. |
In the second hall' the Kappa Sigs
were awarded the ball but were
forced to punt after gaining only |
seven yards. Ching ran it back to I
the 29 yard stripe. A pass to Pierre
Pickard gained about five yards and j
Ching got only two yards on third !
down. Instead of punting. Pollack !
went for the first down but the pass |
to Bob Hetrick was not enough.
ANOTHER TD
Hinchy hit Talbot for a fresh start J
on the 13 yard line and then tossed
one'to A 1 Tibbets at the right corner
for Kappa Sig's second score.
Ravenswood took over and met a
fourth and fifteen situation. Again
they elected to try it but Bob Camp
bell intercepted the attempt going
out on the 34 yard line. Hinchy
threw long to George Ghillarducci
but it fell in complete.
A pass to Talbot made it first and

goal on the 7 yard line, and a short
heave to Shipkey boosted the score
to 19 to 6.
Time ran out with the Kappa Sigs
driving goalward after taking over
on the 27 yard marker.
