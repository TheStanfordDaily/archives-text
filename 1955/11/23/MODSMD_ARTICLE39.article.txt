Rommie Loudd, guard Jim Brown, I

the second eleven.
Brodie, Wiggin, Jim Brown, Ar
nett and Witte all have one year of
eligibility remaining. Stewart, Pal
mer, Loudd, Davenport, Sam Brown
and Ferrante graduate this year.
The only controversial choice in
the backfield would be that of Dav
enport over Stanford's Bill Tarr,
named to the second team. Tarr has
been a consistently outstanding
player throughout his college career,
although handicapped by lack of
speed and defensive weaknesses.
