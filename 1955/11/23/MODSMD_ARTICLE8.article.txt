# Bears Lose Head
## 
### 
AMONG THE MISSING — The
smiling part of Cal's mascot Oskie
—the head—is missing from the
Bear lair. Last Friday night in the
pre-Big Game celebrations in San
Francisco someone (from Stanford
they say) made off with the head
piece.
Cal says the head is worth $125
and Jim Walters, Stanford cheer
leader yesterday made a plea for
its return. He said he had a "few
ideas" of its whereabouts and "is
looking."
Walters asked that the missing
head be turned in to him if pos
sible, stressing he'd "ask no ques
tions."
Stanford may have the Bear
head but it also has several bat
tered band instruments —results of
Cal destruction — §200 to $250
vrorth.
