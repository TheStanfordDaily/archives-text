## Eisenhower May Discuss Prospective Political Plans 
### 
GETTYSBURG, Pa , Nov. 27 (UP) â€” President Eisenhower re
sumes active command of the Republican party tomorrow with
an important political conference that could bear on his own plans
for the 1956 Presidential election.
The White House left open the possibility that Mr. Eisenhower

may discuss his availability for a
second term when he meets with
GOP National Chairman Leonard W.
Hall.
It will be his first admittedly po
litical talk since his Sept. 24 heart
attack.
The White House said only that it
did not know if the second term
question would come up. The meet
ing was billed as a discussion of
"matters dealing with the Republi
can party," however.
There has been speculation Hall
will get some idea of the President's
plans.
Mr. Eisenhower also meets tomor
row with Labor Secretary James P.
Mitchell to talk over "routine" Labor
Department matters. Next Saturday
he will meet with GOP House and
Senate leaders on his 1956 legisla
tive program.
Assistant White House Press Sec
retary Murray Snyder said the meet
ing with Hall was arranged to dis
cuss plans for the Republican Na
tional Committee meeting at Chicago
next Thursday.
The committee will formally issue
the call for the GOP nominating
convention in San Francisco Aug. 20.
