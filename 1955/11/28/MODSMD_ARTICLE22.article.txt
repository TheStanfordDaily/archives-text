Thanksgiving is over, and already final
exams, like Edgar's raven, cast a long shadow.
Two weeks left. In the words of one professor:
"To remove the possibility of any unpleasant
emotional scenes in the near future, be advised
that both the text and lectures in this course
re pregnant with testable material." You heard
the man.

T f you're tone-deaf or a Brubeck maniac, then
road no farther. But on the other hand, if you
T':e music, consider this week's Tuesday Eve
ning Series with some care. Tomorrow night
Harold Schmidt and the University' Chorus are
r: la ted to run through a variety of choral-type
music. If you've never heard massed voices,
outside of church, you ought to go listen. Most
;. ?ople figure it's guite an experience. Concert
b ins at 7:30, and as they generally get a good
.rnout for this, don't figure on finding an
r :jhth row center much after 7.
Wednesday afternoon is Little Theatre Mati
nee time, and this week the advance word is
pretty vague. They're calling it "A Program of
Readings," and this could mean almost any
thing, or nothing. But if you feel like rushing
•i, the program will start at 4:15.
If you can scrape the merest jot or tittle of
Lite-rest in "Paramagnetic Resonance Methods
ir Biochemistry," you will be glad to learn that
' Dta Sigma Pi and Phi Lambda Upsilon are join
ing forces to consider this matter in Rccm 20
of ihe Chem Palace at 8 Wednesday evening;
£sword: The Greeks are gathering.
Wednesday night, and running in competi
-1 on with our scientific friends, the Stanford
i : yers open the first of a series of four per
formances of Anthony Sharpe's adaptation of
i-'eacock's "Nightmare Abbey." A little fast
research reveals the whole thing is a big slash
a' such notables as Coleridge, Byron and Shel
ley. Satiric is the word. Haven't seen the re
hearsals, but the sets and stage dressings are
very neatly done. As one observer put it,"The
thing definitely has a potential." Best way to

see if it's realized is to go, no?

Although we should, celebrate it ihe other
361 days of the year too, Thursday has been

Safe Driving Day. The goal is fewer accidents,
no deaths. As you bounce along the campus
roads, you might give the whole thing a
thought.

Thursday afternoon it's the Intermezzo Se
riss, and if your ID is slightly spurious, we'd
recommend you kiss off the '56 Reunion and
head for the cool confines of Cubberley to see
"Reves d'Amour," a musical which has been
neatly re tilled for local consumption "Franz
Liszt." How's that for anti-eroticism?
Football is barely over and still not forgot
ten, but right away it's basketball season.
Howie Dallmar's basketeers open against the
Washington Huskies in ihe Pavilion Friday and
Saturday at 8:30. It's not a conference game
and maybe it's a good thing. Washington's first
string averages six inches above six feet, and
the Huskies are one of the favorites for the
PCC title.

Sunday night there's not flick, and after last
night, let us not carp but be thankful for small
blessings. In place of the weekly alarm-clock
session, we have a treat of a cultural nature.
To wit: The Stanford Symphony- Orchestra,
under the baton of Sandor Salgo, local music
professor and guest conductor with the San
Francisco Symphony. Contrary to popular ru
mor, this is not a gang of wistful refugees from
the Band Shack, but a group cf serious musi
cians from Stanford and neighboring areas who
gain considerable pleasure from playing sym
phonic music for a conductor of note. The con
cert is in Memorial Auditorium, and it begins
at 8:15. Dress is defnitely "dressy sport."
