# NSA Seeks To Improve U.S. Schools
## 24 Dedicated Students Organize in 1947 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Nine years ago a group of
American students returned
from Europe determined that the
United States should at last have
a national student union.
These 24 students had attended the
j conference forming the International
; Union of Students, where they dedi
| cated themselves to the task of or
ganizing the first truly representa
tive American student organization.
In less than a year, their hopes
materialized when representatives of
over half the students in the country
! met at the University of Wisconsin
| to form the United States National
j Students Association.
| Since that time, NSA has worked
actively for a better climate in the
educational community through ex
: change of information and concrete
! pro,, rams on the national, regional
I and district levels.
[cold war victim
Although the national organization
has progressed since its conception I
in 1947. it was not long before the
world body became a victim of the
i Cold War.
Soon after the International Union
I of Students was born, it became sub-
I ject to dominant communist influ-
I once, and with the disappearance of !
I its headquarters behind the Iron !
Curtain, student unions from the :
I Free World rapidly dropped out.
Now the only non - communist i
countries retaining membership in
j the lUS are Ecuador and Japan.
NEW CONFEDERATION
But refusing to give up the idea
! of a free international student union,
! students from Western countries re
' cently formed the Co - ordinating
Secretariat of National Unions of
Students in Leyden, Holland.
This group was set up as a confed
eration rather than a tight formal
organization in the hope, now ex- |
tremely dim, that lUS would even
tually become free of the communist
grasp.
The purposes and strength of the I
national unions vary greatly from :
country to country. In France, for
instance, at the nod of the national
headquarters, 95 per cent of the i
French students can be expected to I
go out on strike in protest against
offensive governmental action.
INFORMATION EXCHANGE
In the United States, the emphasis
is more on information exchange
and building within the university
group rather than pressure on gov
ernment bodies.
Reflecting NSA's interest in the
formation of national education poli
cies, national president Stanford |
Glass will attend the White House
Conference on Education to be held
this week.
This national meeting follows the j
pattern of similar meetings held by
state and territory governors dur- j
ing the past year, which regional and
district NSA representatives at
tended.
FORD GRANT
To aid in its leadership training '
program, NSA recently received a
$128,(375 grant from the Ford Foun
dation, the largest grant in NSA's
history.
The grant will provide funds for !
15 or more student leaders from !
Asia, Africa, the Near East and Lat
in America to spend a year at se
lected universities in this country.
NSA leaders have not hesitated to i
make their voices heard in govern
ment circles about issues directly af
fecting student life.
Protests from NSA schools over a
proposed cut in Fulbright scholar
ship aid two years ago played a part '
in the controversy over foreign aid '
in the education field and in the j
eventual restitution of the threat
ened Fulbright funds.
ACADEMIC FREEDOM
At last summer's national confer- i
ence, NSA published its beliefs on
the hot issue of academic freedom
saying that a professor should be
dismissed only on the grounds that
he has lost his professional compe- (
tence or integrity.
Mere membership in a question- j
able group, NSA said, is not ade- i
quate cause for dismissal. Nor is use I
of the Fifth Amendment or any oth
er part of the Bill of Rights in an- j
swering questions a justifiable rea
son for dismissal, they said.
In the field of school desegrega
tion, NSA urged all schools to un
dertake immediate action and set a
deadline for integration while at the
same time realizing that the difficult i
problem must be dealt with slowly I
and carefully.
