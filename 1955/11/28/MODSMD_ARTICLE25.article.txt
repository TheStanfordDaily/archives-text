# 'DEIRDRE OF THE SORROWS'
## Dialogue Endows Play With Dramatic Impact 
### RICHARD MENDE 
The most compelling quality cf (the latest Actor's Workshop
production—by itself worth the trip to San Francisco—is the lan
guage cf John Millington Synga's unfinished but actable tragedy,
"Deirdre of the Sorrows."
Although formally prose, Synge's language has a rhythmic

quality, an imagery, a lyric feeling'
which has a dramatic impact that is
nowhere rivalled by the naturalistic
idiom of the modern commercial
theatre; it is so compelling it seems
to carry along the young actors that
speak it.
Drawing on myth and legend o£
Irish folklore, "Deirdre" comes from
material which occupies about the
same position in Irish culture that
the Homeric epics do for the Greeks.
The theme, the importance of youth
and beauty to a meaningful life, is
told in a theatrically potent story,
displaying an art that made Synge's
death at 38 an immense loss.
Patricia Beverly achieved a cer
tain dignity and displayed a certain
wide-eyed—and at times wild-eyed
—charm as Deirdre.
Maurice Argent gave an outstand
ingly fine interpretation of the aging
monarch impatiently demanding the
youthful maiden.
Margoret Doyle revealed a solid
competence as Lavaracham and Eu
gene Roche played Owen to the hilt
resulting in a performance which
was not unsatisfying.

The second play in the production
was a ono-nct farce by Sean O'casey.
The wi<l e 1 y accepted premise of
commercial theatre, that pluys arc?
supposed to have a happy ending,
may have been the reason for in
cluding "Pound on Demand" on the
program.
Even by itself it would seem one
of Scan O'casey's trivial efforts and
1 think that is not simply a reflection
of my personal prejudice against
low-comedy efforts to find humour
in drunkenness.
In fairness, it should be mentioned
that Robert Haswell and Bill Sweeny
gave a sprightly performance as the
tipsies but after viewing "Deirdre" I
somehow wish this whole enterprise
had been omitted.
