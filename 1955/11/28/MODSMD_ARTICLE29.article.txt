## Dallmar Has Big Rebuilding Job Ahead; Selleck, Bond, Brown Top Returning Vets 
### JIM BAKER 
Coach Howie Dallmar faces a
major rebuilding job this year
as the Indian Basketballers pre
pare for their first game this Fri
day night with Washington.
The Cards have lost their major
scoring threats, Ron Tomsic and Puss
Lavvler, and several of the reserves.
Tomsic, who broke most of Hank
Luisetti's records, is now in the Air
Force, while Lawler is playing for
the Peoria Caterpillers.
Leading the Indians will be little
George Selleck, team's leading
scorer two years ago, and "holler
guy." Selleck is only 5-8 but is
praised by Dallmar as the best little
player in college basketball today.
Other returning starters from last
year's team are Bill Bond, a six foot
forward from Long Beach, and Barry
Brown, 6-4, from Venice, at the
other forward.
According to Dallmar, the two va
cated spots—at center and guard—
are still wide open. Carlos Bea, Clint
Waring, Nick Vojvodich, and Bob
McGrath are fighting it out for the
center slot, while Hap Wagner, John
Henderson, Dave Dunn and Beppo
Dyer are making the main bids for
the guard position.
UP FROM JV'S
Bea and Wagner both played on
the varsity last year, each seeing a
considerable amount of action. Voj
vodich, McGrath, Dunn and Dyer
were Junior Varsity members, while
Waring was starting center for the
frosh team.

Henderson transferred to Stanford |
from Mt. San Antonio Junior Col
lege, where he played center. He 1
is 6-2.
Bea and Bond both began practice
just last Monday, Bond being injured
before that time, and Bea was not
eligible until that time.
Carl Isaacs and Gary Van Galder.
both out for football, are expected
to begin practice today.
SEASON OPENS
The Indians have more five prac
tice sessions scheduled until-Friday j
night's game.
On the basis of the few practice
sessions which the team has had,
Dallmar praised Selleck and Bond
for looking good, but says that the j
team cannot be considered as a title
contender this year.
"The team lacks too much height
to be a real contender," says Dall
mar. "But it's a real good club, and
they'll be aggressive."'
SCRAPPY GROUP
"There is plenty of competition for
each position to keep the starters on
their toes," Dallmar added.
The coach rates Washington as one
of the co-favorites of the PCC this
year, along with Cal. He also said !
UCLA and Idaho will be contenders.
The PCC will have a new system
operating this year with respect to j
the games. Unlike past years, when
the Northern Division and Southern
Division played as separate leagues,
and used a playoff at the end of the
season to determine the PCC win

ner, the League this year will be a
round-robin.
This means that each team will
play every other team, and there
will be no separation between
Northern and Southern Division.
The winner of the most games at the
end of the season will be the title
holder of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence and will enter the NCAA play
offs.
The league appears to be fairly
well balanced this season. Wash
ington is the favorite up north, while
USC finds itself in the top spot in
the southern half of the loop. But
those two teams do not meet until
the first week of March, and by that
time, the title may be elsewhere.
Oregon State, last year's winners,
chances were hurt badly when
Swede Halbrook, 7-3 center, dropped
out of school because of -scholastic
difficulties.
All of the California schools were
hard hit by graduation except Cali
fornia, and the Bears won only one
conference game last year. USC will
be led by 'Bony Psaltis. Behind him
are several promising JC transfers,
and Larry Hauser a top soph pros
pect.
Washington goes for height this

season, as Tippy Dye, Husky coach,
feels he has his best team since the
Houbregs days, three years ago.
Washington's probable starting five
consists of Jim Coshow (G-6) and
Bruno Boin (6-8) at forwards, Gary
Nelson (7-0) at center, and two
shorties at guards, Doyle Perkins
((3-0) and Ron Orsen (6-4).
