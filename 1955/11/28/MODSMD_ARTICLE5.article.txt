CHAMBLAY, France, Nov. 27 (U.R)
â€”Premier Edgar Faure, facing pos
sible loss of his job in a confidence
vote Tuesday, urged reforms today
to end France's "everlasting merry
go-round of governments."
The hard-pressed Faure proposed
a constitutional change to make it
harder for the French National As
sembly to topple premiers.
The premier, addressing war vet
erans in this Jura mountain village
in eastern France, said government
"permanence" was necessary so that
France could face ''the demands of
the international situation.
''The republic has almost always
lived under a system of six-month
governments. It is a luxury which
we must renounce. Continuity is es
sential for executive power.
"I do not ask it for myself. I ask
it for every French government in
the future."
The 47-year-old Faure proposed
that the constitution provide auto
matic dissolution of the National As
sembly if it files a premier within
two years after it.s first session.
