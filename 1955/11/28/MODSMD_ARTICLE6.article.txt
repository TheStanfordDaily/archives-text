# Peaceful Thanksgiving Weekend Preludes Hectic Study 'Stretch Drive'

### 
It's just another Monday morning, and students are returning to
classes wondering what happened to all the studying they had planned
to do over the four-day Thanksgiving weekend.
After four peaceful days, the campus returns to the normal hustle
of academic pursuits—and the accelerated bustle of prc-finals prep
aration. This is the "stretch drive" for those who, like most, said "well,
I'll catch up over Thanksgiving."
If nothing happened in students' minds over the long weekend, less
happened on the campus. Thursday, most were either home or visiting
friends for the traditional turkey dinner. Some of those who stayed
on the campus saw the last football game of the year in Stanford
Stadium.

ditional Turkey-day Tussle" Palo Alto High School defeated Sequoia
of Redwood City by the slimmest of margins—7 to (».
Friday was probably the quietest day on the Farm since the sum
mer recess. Saturday was only a little noisier—cheering (or moaning)
TV viewers watching Army's 14-6 upset win over Navy.
Most students were hack by yesterday evening. The usual crowd
was on hand to watch — and provide audio-embellishment for — the
Sunday Flick, "Carnival Story" with Anne Baxter and Steve Cochran.
And now it's Monday.
