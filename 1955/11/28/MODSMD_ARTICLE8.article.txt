# Axe Still Awaits Theft-Proof Case
## 
### 
Plans for a new case for the new
ly-returned Stanford Axe are still
quite indefinite, Student Financial
Manager Bill Tooley said yesterday.
The problem, according to Tooley,
is to provide a case that is burglar
proof but will display the Axe as
well as possible.
The Axe used to be exhibited in
the Cellar, and after the Axe left
Stanford, a plaque remained to mark
the special spot. Tooley said that the
Axe may return to that spot, but
that no decision has been reached.
One old case is available, but it
does not seem appropriate for such
a warmly-disputed trophy. It is built
of plywood and glass, much like
cases used for rock displays.
One suggestion for Keeping the
Axe in its Stanford home was mere
ly lo chain it to the wall at the
Cellar.
Stanford had installed a special
950-pound case with double plate
unbreakable glass in 1946. This "for
tress" was built at a cost of $700
after four Cal men had walked out
of the Cellar with the Axe.
The Axe rested in that glorious
stronghold for only a few months
since soon after the Axe was recov
ered Cal won the privilege of hous
ing it by virtue of winning the Big
Game.
Stanford then lost sight of its spe
cial Axe case and for eight years
had no worries about the safety of
the Axe. But now the privilege of
providing a worthy case is hers,
along with the victory.
