## Truman Says He Didn't Use That Phrase Again 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 28 (UP)—Former President Harry S. Tru
man, stumping the country on a "non-controversial campaign" to
raise funds for his memorial library, became embroiled today in a
controversy over whether he referred to Vice-President Richard
M. Nixon as "that !"
The ex-chief executive flatly denied reports of two newsmen

that he used the epithet in reference
to Nixon when he was asked, as he
stepped ofT a plane from Seattle last
night, what he thought of the Vice-
President as a possible GOP Presi
dential candidate for 1956.
Truman's purpose in Los Angeles
was to help drum up funds for the
establishment of the Truman Memo
rial Library, a $lw 50,000 enterprise
which would collect the historical
records and papers of U.S. Presi
dents. He spoke at a $100-a-plate
dinner tonight, with the net proceeds
going into the fund.
But his dinner speech was over
shadowed by the dispute over
whether he used the same vulgar
reference in speaking of the Vice-
President that he once did in refer
ring to columnist Drew Pearson. The
affair was reminiscent of the caustic
language the often-candid Truman
once used in chastising an Eastern
music critic who gave a poor review
to a singing performance by Tru
man's daughter, Margaret.
Two reporters, from the Los An
geles Times and the Los Angeles Ex
aminer, reported they heard the ex-
President, "bristling with indigna
tion," answer their question:
l 'l don't even want to discuss that
! Don't even mention his
name to me!"
