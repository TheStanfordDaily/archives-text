# Prof Says Science Young Man's Game
## 
### 
Most of the major new scientific
discoveries will come from younger
men.
That's the opinion of Dr. Edward
L. Tatum, professor of biology here.
Dr. Tatum, internationally known
biologist, said recently that he be
lieved a scientist past his peak at 35.
His belief stems from two reasons:
First, he says that older men feel
a greater responsibility toward their
students and, second, these men
spend much time on administrative
duties.
Working with a former University
colleague, Dr. George W. Beadle,
Tatum founded a biology field now
called biochemical genetics.
