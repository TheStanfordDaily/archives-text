# Stanford Flayers Experiment with 'Nightmare Abbey'
## Show's West Coast Premiere to Run 4 Days; Produced Only Twice by Theatre Groups 
### JUDY VOLLMAR 
An experimental production
of "Nightmare Abbey" will be
presented by the Stanford Play
ers for four performances only
starting Wednesday night in the
Little Theater.
The play is an adaptation by An
thony Sharp of Thomas Love Pea
cock's novel; it has had only two
presentations, one by the London
Mask Theater in 1952 and one by an
Eastern college.
The various types of morbid gloom
in the novel are skillfully woven
into a neat melodramatic plot.
Ronald Bazarini will play the part
of Scythrop Glowry; Mr. Glowry
will be played by E. Ray Fry; Stella
will be portrayed by Astrid YVills
rud, and Marionetta will be played
by Almeda Wilbor.
Scythrop Glowry lives with his
father in damp melancholy in a part
ly ruined abbey. When the story
opens, he has recently had a dis
appointment in love, and has de
termined to devote the rest of his
life to writing pamphlets to reform
society.
Into this atmosphere of solemn
gloom comes his cousin, Marionetta
—a gay, coquettish and penniless
girl.
Scythrop is captivated, but his fa
thor disapproves, having recently ar
ranged with his friend MV. Toobad,
a still more morbid gentleman, that
Scythrop should marry Miss Toobad
—a young lady who has beauty and
a fortune in the bargain.
Scythrop, however, is all for gaiety

at the moment, and will have no one
but Marionetta, and by a display of
tantrums and mock suicide induces
his father to agree.
Meanwhile a mysterious, disguised
young lady, very intellectual and in
dependent seeks him out as the re
sult of reading one of his pamphlets
and demands his protection from op
pression.
He conceals her in the ruined
tower but he is haunted with the
fear that his second lady, who calls
herself Stella, will be discovered by
someone in the Abbey.
Tickets for the performance of
"Nightmare Abbey" may be pur
chased at the Memorial Auditorium
box office.
