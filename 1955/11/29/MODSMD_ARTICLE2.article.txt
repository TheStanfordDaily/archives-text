National Chairman Leonard W. Hall 1
said today after a 45-minute politi- [
cal conference with President Eisen

couraged" the President will seek

Hall, who found Mr. Eisenhower
"looking one million per cent," told
newsmen the President himself
"didn't say yes and he didn't say no"
to the big question of whether he
will head the 1956 GOP ticket.
But Hall, radiating confidence,
said Mr. Eisenhower's good health,
plus "his attitude and his interest"
in political developments, strength
ened his own optimism that the
President will run for re-election.
Asked specifically if he felt better
about prospects for Mr. Eisenhower's
candidacy after talking with the;
President, Hall replied bluntly:' "I
feel better about it after the confer
ence than before."
The GOP chairman also said he
expects Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon to be Eisenhower's running
mate in 1956.
