# Council Finds Student Guilty
## 
### 
Men's and Women's Councils,
meeting in joint session as the Honor
Code Committee, two weeks ago,
found a student in a history course
guilty of "premeditated deceit" and
sentenced him to an "F" in the
course.
The student claimed he was un
able to take the midterm in the
course because of a minor injury he
received on his way to the cla: s
room on the morning of the test.
Fearing this would not be a suitable
excuse to take the makeup, he ac
quired a copy of the test from an
other student, and took the test in
his room, under Honor Code condi
tions, and graded it himself.
He then took the test to the reader
for the course, and claimed that ap
parently somebody had taken his
blue book from the class after he
had handed it in, and had graded it
as a joke, since the mark on the
bluebook was higher than the top
grade on the curve, which had been
posted several days earlier.
He asked if the reader could give
him a makeup, since his original test
had not been graded.
Because the student had not tried
to pass the bogus test as a valid
exam, he was not found guilty on
this count, but sentence was passed
upon him for deliberately trying to
deceive the reader.
