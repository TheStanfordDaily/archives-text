Cal will have its men's rooting section next
year.
Last Tuesday by a lopsided 11-2 vote the Cal
Executive Committee voted to retain the much
debated* section.
Only ASUC President Bob Hamilton and an
Ex Com representative voted against it.
However, the Cal Rally Committee was
racked over the coals at a student forum the
same day.
Four of five student speakers in the forum
asked for a complete reorganization of Rally
Committee.
It was suggested that the head yell leader be
appointed by Ex Com instead of elected by the
student body.
"The actions of the rooting section repre
sented poor leadership," Scott Sherman, sopho
moie class president declared. "An unhealthy
hierarchy is developing in the yell leading po
sitions."
Sherman also blasted Rally Corn's use of
card stunts, stating, "I feel the University card
stunts did not come close to those of Stanford."
Washington's pompon girl.troubles are at an
end.
In the past Washington's rooting section has
yelled for the other team's pompon girls and
soundly booed its own, but this situation was
changed during Washington's game with
V/ashington State a week and a half ago.
The Washington Daily- describes it in this
fashion, "Just after the third quarter the girls
trooped out on the sidelines as the band
whipped up a number of tunes and started
dancing.
"A momentary hush fell over the male cheer
ing section, eyes quickly switched from the
bods on the field to the bods on the sidelines,
then the silence was broken by a frenzied yell
of approval.
"Members of the Bachelors Club, out of re

spect lor club rules, removed their derbies and
joined in the occult appreciation ol the swaying
girls."
Stanford pompon girls may take note.
They're still having disciplinary problems at
the University of Connecticut.
A few weeks ago the dean's office issued a
ban on swearing, and more recently a mob of
students practically overturned a policeman's
car. Now nine of the campus's 23 fraternities
have been suspended for the rest of the semes
ter for violating the university's po-liquor-on
campus rule during homecoming week.
Three liquor commissioners circulated
throughout the Connecticut campus Saturday
evening and caught nine fraternities with the
goods. Investigation is now underway to de
termine whether the men who purchased the
liquor and beer were of legal age.
â€¢ Reporters on the University of Santa Clara
Daily have won a fight for freedom of the press.
Killing an earlier decision banning reporters
from closed sessions, the ASUSC Student
Court ruled decently that all future judicial
proceedings will be open to members of the
press.
The privilege was granted, however, with
the stipulation that prees reports contain noth
ing which would reveal the identity of students
brought before the court on disciplinary
charges.
In October a reporter was refused admission
to the first hearing. At that time it was the opin
ion of the court that the presence of reporters
at the hearing would violae the rights of the
students involved to have their identity con
cealed.
In its latest ruling, the court recognized the
right of the student body as a whoie to know
what procedures are being followed in the
handling of disciplinary matters referred to the
court.
