# CinemaScope Bright Spot In 'Pompey'
## Dana Wynter Shines In 'Hackneyed Plot' 
### STEW TOY 
Once again, in "The View
From Pompay's Head," wonder
ful, magical CinemaScope
proves its ability to save the
most hackneyed plot from senti
mental oblivion.
The movie, now playing at the
Stanford Theater, tangles veteran
Richard Egan and newcomer Dana
Wynter—a blithe Audrey Hepburn
with a Southern accent—in one of
the oldest and intrinsically corniest
plots known to Hollywood.
Egan, a native of the fine old
Southern town of Pompey's Head,
has left his childhood girlfriend and
gone off to the Big City to bftcome a
lawyer.
It's "Point of No Return" all over
again as, 10 years and two kids later,
he returns home to solve an embez
zlement case involving a grizzled
island novelist.
Egan is immediately plagued by
old, nostalgic ghosts. Chiefest among
them, of course, is Miss Wynter, who
has never stopped loving him and
will always love him and why-, oh,
why did he ever go away?
Stung by her fatal Old South
charm, he realizes he is also in love
with her and tries to fix up two
divorces and remedy that great mis
take of so long ago.
He fails, and glides away to per
petual misery in a misty Pullman.
But in spite of the plot, the movie
is entertaining and extremely well
done.
The photography is 'excellent, full
of the wide-screen, technicolor moo
diness of Southern verandas and
beaches. Ihe scenery alone, in the
best Cinemascope tradition, is worth
the price of admission.
Egan's straightforward acting is at
oncc emotional and restrained, sav
ing the film from farcical or melo
dramatic elements which might oth
erwise have been present.
Miss Wynter, too, does an admir
able job avoiding the blight of over
zealousness, so often found in those
new to films. Her dark-eyed ex
pressiveness is naturally moody.
As a new personality, Miss Wynter
is * worth watching, in more ways
than one.
