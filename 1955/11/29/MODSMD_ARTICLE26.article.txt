# Throaty Siren of KZSU Is Ventura's Evelyn Dees
## 
### DAVE CANFIELD 
The mad love many Farm men have felt for "Stanford Sadie,"
sultry siren of KZSU, last night reached a fervid peak.
During Sadie's swan-song show of the fall quarter, her identity
was unveiled.
Sadie is Evelyn Dees, Ventura Hall sophomoroe who by co-

incidence hails from Ventura, Cali
fornia. For all those love-sick Wil
bur frosh, her phone number is DA
3-8731.
However, Evelyn slyly commented,
"If fallows I didn't know called me
up and asked for a date because they
knew I was Stanford Sadie, whether
I would go out with him or not
would depend on the fellow."
CURVACIOUS BLONDE
As far as other vital statistics go,
Miss Dees can knock even a sage
grad student's eye out with her
measurements of 35-24-34 on a 5-
l'oot 7-inch, 126-pound chassis. And
she is a hazel-eyed blonde.
But it was for her seductive voice,
not her shape, that KZSU chose
Evelyn for the coveted post of Stan
ford Sadie.
Miss Dees jokingly asserted, "I
won this job because I paid all the
guys at KZSU."
Hearing her voice, which is so
seductive its almost a croak, belies
this assertion.
•CHRONIC CONDITION"
Asked how she developed her un
usual voice, Evelyn put her tongue
in her cheek and quipped, "I have a
chronic thyroid condition. To de
velop my voice, I didn't put rocks in
my mouth or anything, only fillings."
When asked how other Stanford
women could learn to speak with
husky femininity, she was more
hslpful. "Just before you go out
every morning," Miss Dees advised,
"scream at the top of your lungs for
an hour."
The 13-year-old coed, who tried
out for the job on a dare, discussed
quite frankly how successful she was

at keeping her position a secret. "My j
Evelyn confided, "didn't
get suspicious when I was gone at
10:30 every Monday night because
she was always gone at 10:30 too."
"However," Miss Dees admitted, ■
"many of my friends guessed my
secret when they heard my voice on j
the air the first time."
FORMER DISK JOCKEY
Evelyn, who prepared for her
KZSU success by serving as a disc i
jockey on a radio stations in Ven- j
tura, admitted being Stanford Sadie
has its good and bad points. "Hear- i
ing people wonder who Stanford j
Sadie was, was what I enjoyed most |
about this job," she said. "The only
unpleasant thing about being Stan
ford Sadie was that all the KZSU
boys thought I was what I said I was
over the air." Now that the series
has ended, her "biggest thrill in con
nection with the Stanford Sadie job
is that its over."
On other aspects of her college j
career, Evelyn was confident. "Next j
quarter," she asid v "I intend to go
plus."

EVELYN DEES—ALIAS STANFORD SADIE
The mad love many Farm men have felt for "Stanford Sadie,"
sultry siren of KZSU, last night reached a fervid peak.
During Sadie's swan-song show of the fall quarter, her identity
was unveiled.
Sadie is Evelyn Dees, Ventura Hall sophomoroe who by co-

incidence hails from Ventura, Cali
fornia. For all those love-sick Wil
bur frosh, her phone number is DA
3-8731.
However, Evelyn slyly commented,
"If fallows I didn't know called me
up and asked for a date because they
knew I was Stanford Sadie, whether
I would go out with him or not
would depend on the fellow."
CURVACIOUS BLONDE
As far as other vital statistics go,
Miss Dees can knock even a sage
grad student's eye out with her
measurements of 35-24-34 on a 5-
l'oot 7-inch, 126-pound chassis. And
she is a hazel-eyed blonde.
But it was for her seductive voice,
not her shape, that KZSU chose
Evelyn for the coveted post of Stan
ford Sadie.
Miss Dees jokingly asserted, "I
won this job because I paid all the
guys at KZSU."
Hearing her voice, which is so
seductive its almost a croak, belies
this assertion.
•CHRONIC CONDITION"
Asked how she developed her un
usual voice, Evelyn put her tongue
in her cheek and quipped, "I have a
chronic thyroid condition. To de
velop my voice, I didn't put rocks in
my mouth or anything, only fillings."
When asked how other Stanford
women could learn to speak with
husky femininity, she was more
hslpful. "Just before you go out
every morning," Miss Dees advised,
"scream at the top of your lungs for
an hour."
The 13-year-old coed, who tried
out for the job on a dare, discussed
quite frankly how successful she was

at keeping her position a secret. "My j
Evelyn confided, "didn't
get suspicious when I was gone at
10:30 every Monday night because
she was always gone at 10:30 too."
"However," Miss Dees admitted, ■
"many of my friends guessed my
secret when they heard my voice on j
the air the first time."
FORMER DISK JOCKEY
Evelyn, who prepared for her
KZSU success by serving as a disc i
jockey on a radio stations in Ven- j
tura, admitted being Stanford Sadie
has its good and bad points. "Hear- i
ing people wonder who Stanford j
Sadie was, was what I enjoyed most |
about this job," she said. "The only
unpleasant thing about being Stan
ford Sadie was that all the KZSU
boys thought I was what I said I was
over the air." Now that the series
has ended, her "biggest thrill in con
nection with the Stanford Sadie job
is that its over."
On other aspects of her college j
career, Evelyn was confident. "Next j
quarter," she asid v "I intend to go
plus."
