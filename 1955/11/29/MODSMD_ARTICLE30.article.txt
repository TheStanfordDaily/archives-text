# Gary Glick Bonus Pick Of Steelers
## Big Names Shunned In Pro Grid Draft 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 28 (UP)
Gary Glick of Colorado A&M,
one of the best defensive backs
in college football, was grabbed
today as the bonus choice of the
Pittsburgh Steelers, to set off a
general pattern of by-passing
big-name players in favor of
"sleepers" in the National pro
league draft.
Click's surprise selection set the
pace of the owners as they all but
ignored All-America collegians in
the first picks of an early meeting
timed to offset any possible litiga
tion with Canadian owners over dual
inning of the college stars.
Howard (Hopalong) Cassady, Ohio
State's great back, and center Bob
Pellegrini of Maryland were the only
All - Americans am on g the first
round selections. Detroit took Cas
sady, and the Philadelphia Eagles
Pellegrini.
49ERS GET BOSLEY
All-America tackles Bruce Bosley
of West Virginia and Norman Mas
ters of Michigan State lasted until
the second round when they were
picked by San Francisco and the
Chicago Cardinals, respectively.
Coach Walt Kiesling of the Steel
ers said that Glick, rated a bearcat
on defense, would be placed on his
team's defensive platoon. He was a j
jack-of-all-trades quarterback at!
Colorado A&M.
"We drew to our weakness," Kies
ling explained. "We made the big
choice to fit our needs. We watched
him all season and believe he is the
player we need to fill our wants."
DAVIS OVER CASSADY
The Steelers also admitted they
ranked Art Davis, Mississippi State
back whom they took as their first
regular choice, above Cassady in
their immediate needs, in that they j
were expecting the return from
service of Johnny Lattner of Notre
Dame and Paul Cameron of UCLA.
The owners selected 37 players in
their first three picks and will finish
the normal draft of 25 players each
at the league's annual meeting in
Los Angeles next January. Southern
Methodist and West Virginia each
provided four of today's choices.
Michigan State and Auburn yielded j
three each, and Maryland and Ar
kansas two each.
