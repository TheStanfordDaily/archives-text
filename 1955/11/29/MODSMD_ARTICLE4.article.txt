# Red Sox Announce Purchase of Seals
## 
### 
COLUMBUS, Ohio â€”The Boston
Red Sox announced tonight they
have purchased the San Francisco
Seals of the Pacific Coast League
and will give up their Louisville
franchise in the American Associa
tion.
The Red Sox did not announce the
purchase price of the Seals, but said
they would assume about $220,000
in back debts owed by the Seals.
The Sox said they now would give
up Louisville because they cannot
keep two such high classification
teams stocked with suitable players.
They said they have two interested
bidders in the Louisville franchise,
one of them a major league team.
It was reported that this team was
the Cincinnati Redlegs, but general
manager Gabe Paul of the Redlegs
denied any interest.
