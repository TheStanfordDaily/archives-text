# Farm to Observe Safe-Driving Day
## 
### 
Stanford will join with the rest of
the United States on Thursday in
the observance of the second annual
"Safe-Driving" day, Police Chief
Gordon Davis announced yesterday.
The big goal of S-D day for each
community participating in the pro
gram is "not a single traffic accident
during the 24-hours of Dec. 1, in
daylight or darkness."
The program is sponsored by the
President's Committee for Traffic
Safety, with co-operation on the
local level throughout the country.
