THE GIFT HORSE
Today's column is about Christmas gift suggestions, and I
suppose you think I'll begin by suggesting Philip Morris. Well,
the joke's on you. I'll do no such thing. Why should I? Anyone
with two brains to knock together knows that Philip Morris
makes an absolutely smashing Christmas gift. Only a poor
afflicted soul with atrophied taste buds needs to be told about the
new Philip Morris; its bracing flavor; its freshness, lightness,
pleasantness, gentleness: its truth, its beauty, its brotherliness
in this discordant world of ours. So why should I waste time
telling you what you already know?
Let us, instead, turn to less obvious gift suggestions. Here's
one I bet you never thought of:
Christmas is the best time of year, but it is also the beginning
of winter. How about a gift that reminds one that though winter
has come, spring is not far behind? I refer, of course, to Easter
chicks. (Similarly, on Easter one can give Christmas chicks.)
Next, we take up the problem, common to all undergraduates,
of trying to buy gifts when you have no money. To this dilemma
I say—Faugh! It is not the price of the gift that counts; it is the
sentiment behind it.
Take, for example, the case of Outerbridge Sigafoos. Outer
bridge, a sophomore, finding himself without funds last Christ
mas, gave his girl a bottle of good clear water and a nice smooth
rock, attaching this touching message to the gift:
Here's some water
And here's a rock,
I love you, daughter,
Around the eloclc.
And the whole delightful gift cost Outerbridge less than a
penny!
I am compelled to report, however, that Outerbridge's girl did
not receive these offerings in the spirit in which they were
tendered. In fact, she flew into a fit of pique, smashed the bottle
on the rock and stabbed Outerbridge with the jagged edge. But
the experience was not without value for Outerbridge. First, he
discovered that the girl was not his type at all. Second, he learned
how to make a tourniquet.
But I digress. Let's examine now a common complaint of
Christmas shoppers: "What do you get for someone who has
everything?"
To this 1 reply, "Does he?" Does he, for instance, have a
unicycle? A sled dog? A serf? A burnoose? A hairball? A bung
starter? (The bung starter, incidentally, was invented by two
enormously talented men, Fred Bung and Otho Starter. Their
partnership thrived from the very start, and there is no telling
to what heights they might have risen had they not split up
over a silly argument. It seems that Bung was a firm believer in
reincarnation; Starter was just as firm a disbeliever. Bung in
sisted so violently on the truth of reincarnation and Starter
scoffed so positively that they finally decided to go their separate
ways. Singly, alas, the two fared badly. Starter gave up business
altogether, joined the army, and was killed at San Juan Hill in
1898. He is today buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Bung
drifted from job to job until he died of breakbone fever in
Elizabeth, N. J., in 1902. He is today a llama in Uruguay.)

has come, spring is not far behind? I refer, of course, to Easter
chicks. (Similarly, on Easter one can give Christmas chicks.)
Next, we take up the problem, common to all undergraduates,
of trying to buy gifts when you have no money. To this dilemma
I say—Faugh! It is not the price of the gift that counts; it is the
sentiment behind it.
Take, for example, the case of Outerbridge Sigafoos. Outer
bridge, a sophomore, finding himself without funds last Christ
mas, gave his girl a bottle of good clear water and a nice smooth
rock, attaching this touching message to the gift:
Here's some water
And here's a rock,
I love you, daughter,
Around the eloclc.
And the whole delightful gift cost Outerbridge less than a
penny!
I am compelled to report, however, that Outerbridge's girl did
not receive these offerings in the spirit in which they were
tendered. In fact, she flew into a fit of pique, smashed the bottle
on the rock and stabbed Outerbridge with the jagged edge. But
the experience was not without value for Outerbridge. First, he
discovered that the girl was not his type at all. Second, he learned
how to make a tourniquet.
But I digress. Let's examine now a common complaint of
Christmas shoppers: "What do you get for someone who has
everything?"
To this 1 reply, "Does he?" Does he, for instance, have a
unicycle? A sled dog? A serf? A burnoose? A hairball? A bung
starter? (The bung starter, incidentally, was invented by two
enormously talented men, Fred Bung and Otho Starter. Their
partnership thrived from the very start, and there is no telling
to what heights they might have risen had they not split up
over a silly argument. It seems that Bung was a firm believer in
reincarnation; Starter was just as firm a disbeliever. Bung in
sisted so violently on the truth of reincarnation and Starter
scoffed so positively that they finally decided to go their separate
ways. Singly, alas, the two fared badly. Starter gave up business
altogether, joined the army, and was killed at San Juan Hill in
1898. He is today buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Bung
drifted from job to job until he died of breakbone fever in
Elizabeth, N. J., in 1902. He is today a llama in Uruguay.)

THE GIFT HORSE
Today's column is about Christmas gift suggestions, and I
suppose you think I'll begin by suggesting Philip Morris. Well,
the joke's on you. I'll do no such thing. Why should I? Anyone
with two brains to knock together knows that Philip Morris
makes an absolutely smashing Christmas gift. Only a poor
afflicted soul with atrophied taste buds needs to be told about the
new Philip Morris; its bracing flavor; its freshness, lightness,
pleasantness, gentleness: its truth, its beauty, its brotherliness
in this discordant world of ours. So why should I waste time
telling you what you already know?
Let us, instead, turn to less obvious gift suggestions. Here's
one I bet you never thought of:
Christmas is the best time of year, but it is also the beginning
of winter. How about a gift that reminds one that though winter
has come, spring is not far behind? I refer, of course, to Easter
chicks. (Similarly, on Easter one can give Christmas chicks.)
Next, we take up the problem, common to all undergraduates,
