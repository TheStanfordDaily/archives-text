# Freshman Dorms Hear ST&T Talks
## Stanford Officials Tell Administration System at Roble, Wilbur and Brainier 
### 
In informal after-dinner sessions last night, freshmen were in
troduced to Stanford's administrative organization.
President Wallace Sterling, Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler, Kenneth Cuthbertson and Frederic Glover, assistants to
the president, and David Jacobson, general secretary, spoke in

freshman dormitories as a part of
the Stanford Today and Tomorrow
Committee program.
At Roble Hall, President Sterling
outlined functions of the Board of
Trustees, the President's office, the
faculty academic council and the
business office.
He praised the trustees for the
"devotion and time given without
recompense" to Stanford. The 23
members are kept fully informed of
everything happening on campus, he
explained, and meet once a month
to discuss school policies.
"The pipeline between the faculty
and the board of trustees is my of
fice," explained President Sterling.
"We operate on an open door policy
to everyone."
ACADEMIC COUNCIL
Representing the faculty is its aca
demic council composed of profes
sors and instructors who have been
at the university for some time.
He emphasized that all faculty ap
pointments and promotions go
through a seven man faculty board,
elected from the academic council.
Under Stanford's charter, if this
board disagrees with the president's
office over an appointment or pro
motion, President Sterling must re
port this disagreement to the Board
of Trustees.
"CENTRAL END"
"This organization leads to one
central end," concluded Stanford's
top executive, "to continue to pro
vide a good education and even to
improve that education."
"The right people can make a bad
blueprint work and the wrong peo
ple cannot make a good blueprint
work." This is why, President Ster
ling emphasized, Stanford wishes to
attract the best possible people and
hold them here.
At Wilbur Hall, Kenneth Cuth
bertson, assistant to the President,
told 30 students in Soto's lounge
about the phenomenal growth and
bright future of Stanford. Dave
Jenks introduced Cuthbertson.
Frederic Glover, assistant to the
president, talked before about 15
freshmen in Junipero lounge. He
was introduced by John Wiester.
In his 30-minute talk, Cuthbertson
told the undergraduates, "Whether
you become President or end up in
Alcatraz, you will always be identi
fied as a Stanford Man."
INDEPENDENT COLLEGES
The administrator declared inde
pendent colleges like Stanford spur
on state educational institutions.
To illustrate, Cuthbertson said,
"Because Stanford is free and inde
pendent, it makes the University of
California better."
Causing the "march to greatness"
of this private institution, according
to Cuthbertson, have been its fac
ulty, students and setting.
Cuthbertson outlined a number of
plans for improving this setting.
Since Stanford doesn't intend to
raise tuition fees, the money for
these plans, the former Stanford
student body president declared,
must come from gifts.
Another query concerned the Ros
sotti's brawl.
"The Rossotti's incident," pointed
out this member of the Stanford
Class of 1933. "was very foolish be
cause of the charges resisting arrest
and insulting an officer. How will
these charges look to a personnel
officer 10 years from now?"
