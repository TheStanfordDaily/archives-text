# Cap and Gown Chooses Six New Members
## 
### 
Women of Cap and Gown toured
several campus residences last night
and tapped six senior women as new
members.
New members of the senior wom
en's honorary are Diane Anderson,
Claire Carson, Marilyn Marshek,
Sally Phillips, Eleanor Wood and
Peggy Woolf.
Members are chosen on the basis
of scholarship (a 2.6 grade average
is required), leadership and service
to the Stanford community.
Led by president Connie Schulz,
Cap and Gown members made their
rounds of the dining halls dressed
in the traditional black robes. Gar
denias were given the six new mem
bers in the surprise tapping cere
mony.
The group met at the home of
Mrs. Jack Shoup for dessert, where
new members met Cap and Gown
alumnae and heard the history and
purpose of the organization.
Cap and Gown members have sold
Stanford calendars this month for a
scholarship fund which supports a
foreign and a domestic scholar each
year.
