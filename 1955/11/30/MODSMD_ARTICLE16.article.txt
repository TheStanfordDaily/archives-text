# Workers Convert Cashier's Office
## 
### 
Students wanting to pay their
room and board bills at the Cash
ier's Office next quarter, won't find
it where it used to be.
Building 1 is being remodeled, up
stairs and down, and according to
the Planning Office, will be put into
use winter quarter.
The downstairs section will be
made into two classrooms and two
seminar rooms, the Planning Office
said, and the upstairs portion will
be the new site of the News and
Publications Office.
History has repeated itself, and
the Cashier's Office has been moved
back to its previous location in the
Encina lobby in order to make room
for more classrooms and offices at
the Inner Quad spot.
