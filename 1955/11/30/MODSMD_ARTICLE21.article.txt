### 
Breaking up of a stolen car ring
operating on the Peninsula brought
sad news for at least one Stanford
student, who purchased a stolen ve
hicle.
Acting in good faith, the student
purchased a recent Ford convertible
for a price reported as $2000, only
to discover that the car was stolen.
According to Stanford Chief of
Police Gordon Davis, the student re
ceived a ''pink slip" for the car, al
though registration numbers on the
engine and body had been obliter
ated.
Identification of the car was made
through a frame number, well hid
den underneath the car.
The ring was reported to have
stolen at least three cars from the
Stanford campus, although the con
vertible was not among them.
