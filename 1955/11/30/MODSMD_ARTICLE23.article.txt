# today and tomorrow
## 
### 
Last night the freshmen had a chance to learn
a little about Stanford from the men who know
her best. The freshman women took advantage
of their opportunity; most of the men did not.
It was the first night of the Stanford Today
and Tomorrow program, and the four freshman
dorms were the scenes of the informal after
dinner talks and discussions. Speaking were
President Wallace Sterling, his executive as
sistants Frederic O. Glover and Kenneth Cuth
bertson, Dean cf Students H. Donald Winbigler
and General Secretary David Jacobson.
The program, now in its fourth, year, is de
signed to inform the students of current and
future University policies, to permit students
to help and understand the University as an
undergraduate and as a future alumnus and to
serve the administration as a sounding board of
student opinion.
In its first three years, Stanford Today and

Tomorrow has been warmly received, even by
many who ridiculed the original idea. The
talks have always been interesting and in
formative; often they have been extremely
stimulating. They have been valuable for both
students and administration.
We can almost understand those upperclass
men who don't attend the talks because "What
can these guys tell me about Stanford? I've
lived here three years."
But we can't understand the freshman men.
They know the least of any of us about the
University. And the more you know about
this school, the better the education you can
obtain.
Next quarter Stanford Today and Tomorrow
will be directed at the other three classes. We
suggest you attend. Not in order to make it j
"lock good" for your living group. But because
we sincerely feel that each of you will benefit.
