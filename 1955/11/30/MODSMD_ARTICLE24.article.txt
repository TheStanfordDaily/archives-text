big game tribute
To the Editor:
Do you think this item is worthy of publication in
The Stanford Daily?
The University of Pennsylvania recently acknowl
edged Stanford University for winning its Big Game
against the University of California. Penn did not
win one game this year, however. So in tribute before
the traditional Thanksgiving Day Penn-Cornell game,
the carillons of the campus cathedral rang out with
the Stanford Hymn and two choruses of "Come Join
the Band."
And how do I know this, you're asking? Well,
first I'm a dental student at the U. of Penn and an
alum of Stanford—Class of '55. Secondly, and more
important — I rang the bells (with permission, of
course)!

thanksgiving invitation
To the Editor:
The Wednesday before Thanksgiving, one of my

teachers invited anyone in the class who was going to
be on campus Thursday to come to dinner at. her
house. The stipulation "if you won't mind a houseful
of noisy children" was added, making the holiday
meal sound even more enjoyable.
I am really thrilled to think some of the faculty
feel that close to the students.
(Name withheld by request)
sincere commendation
To the Editor:
The success of the intramural sports depends a great
deal on student interest in the activities offered. And
that interest maty be sustained or lessened according
to the publicity attending the program.
I hearby offer a motion of sincere commendation,
seconded by my assistant Bob Ryan, to the Daily
sports staff for the fine intramural coverage so far
this year—specifically as to scheduling, coverage of
games and team standings. Our program has bene
fited thereby.
