# ASSU Scholar Says German Unification Only Answer
## Schrader Thinks United German Election Would Show Victory for Pro-West Group 
### GERRY SMITH 
Despite the Cellar's casual atmosphere, ASSU foreign scholar
Jurgen Schrader's attitude as he launched into a discussion of Ger
man reunification was one of intense interest.
"The only answer to Germany's problems is unification." The
young German is positive. ,And when unification comes, even

under Russian terms if they include
free elections, he's confident a dem
ocratic and pro-Western Germany
will result.
"Even if East Germany were to
vote ali communist, which I very
much doubt, West Germany would
outnumber them by several million
people," 23-year-old Schrader con
tinued.
"Russia feels Germany can't be re
united with such strong Western
proposals and backing," Schrader
noted. '"I think the Geneva Confer
ence was intentionally deadlocked
by Russia just to prove that point.
"Soon the Russians will approach i
West Germany separately and give I
her a much better offer than that j
given at Geneva. And any West!
German government is going to find !
such an offer hard to reject."
PROPAGANDA
Schrader thinks the strongest J
communist influence is East German j
propaganda. The power of this prop- |
aganda is evident to him since he i
and thousands of other German
youth were subjected to much the
same methods by Hitler.
Forced to become a member of
the Nazi youth movement, he was
drafted into military service at 14
and compelled to go into action
against American troops overcoming
Germany at the end of World War 11.
"In 1945 the whole system we had
grown up under was destroyed," he
recalled. "It was a great disappoint- j
ment at the time—we didn't realize
it was a bad system.
"A vacuum was created and some- !
thing was needed to fill it. But even
then it was difficult for many to |
adapt themselves to the new ideas."
Schrader is from Hamburg, 40
miles from the East German border, j
He graduated from the Hamburg
University law school and is taking j
political science courses as a gradu- !
ate here. He plans to enter German J
foreign service.
IMPRESSIONS OF U.S.
Turning to his impressions of the
United States and Stanford, Schra
der grinned and relaxed.
His first glimpses of America were
through the windows of a Grey- j
hound bus, which he rode from the
East to Stanford. He particularly
enjoyed the variety of people he had
as seat companions.
After Schrader finishes his year at
Stanford, he plans to get a job in
Chicago and see the Democratic Na
tional Convention if possible. He'd
like to see more of the United States,
especially the South, before he re
turns to Germany.
"I didn't realize various parts of
America are so different from each
other. In Europe we think of the
United States as a tremendous block
of similar country, not an area with !
diversities as great as those between j
countries in Europe."
He finds it hard to get information I

on his own country while at Stan
ford. "It makes you realize your do
mestic problems may not be as im
portant as they seemed at home—
other problems are more important
to the world."
Sehrader, who is living at the
Alpha Kappa Lambda house, feels
fraternities are a good idea. "It's part
of American university life to adapt
to a group and give up a certain
part of your individuality."'
COMMUNITY SPIRIT
In comparing the University of
Hamburg and Stanford, hs, like oth
er foreign scholars, noted the com
munity spirit here. The reason that
the residence university doesn't exist
in Germany is the idea education
should be acquired at home with the
family.
In a final comment, he mentioned
the political disinterest at Stanford.
He feels this is perfectly natural be
cause interest is no necessity here.
"In Germany politics are a matter
of everyday interest," he concluded.
"If Russian troops were in San Fran
cisco, I think the students here
would be interested, too."
