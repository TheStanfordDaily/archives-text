From far-flung corners of the
Quad, here's what the professors are
! saying:
Alexander Miller, lecturer in re
ligion, on introspection: "Introspec
tion can be a dangerous thing be
cause the insides of most of us are
untidy. There English limerick
that goes like this:
There was a young lady of Rid.?,
Who ate some green apples and died.
The apples fermented
Inside the lamented;
Made cider inside her inside."
Robert A. Walktr, professor of po
litical science, on neuroses in federal
service: "We're all neurotic; the
question is how much and what di
rection the neurosis takes,"
Wilfred 11. Stone, professor of
English, on logieul fallacies: "I could
probably put forth quite a convinc
ing argument on why you should r,o
and jump off Hoover Tower."
Philip VV. Harsh, professor of clas
sics, on the Roman system of having
two consuls: "Think what would
happen to us if both Eisenhower and
Stevenson had been elected."
