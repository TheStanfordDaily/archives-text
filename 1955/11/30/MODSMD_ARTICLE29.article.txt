# Seven Frosh Win Sloan Scholarships
## 
### 
Seven freshman men have been
announced as winners of Sloan Na
tional Scholarships.
Stanford is one of the 11 colleges
which is granted money for the
Sloan Scholarship program. Stanford
was included for the first time last
year when the program was ex
tended to liberal arts colleges. Only
four technological institutions had
been recipients of the original grants.
Criteria for awarding the scholar
ships to individuals are academic
record, character and leadership po
tential.
Stipends vary according to need.
In recognition of the fact that tui
tion does not cover all of the Uni
versity's costs, the Sloan program
gives the participating colleges a cost
of education allowance.
Six of last year's freshmen re
ceived Sloan scholarships.
The seven recipients this year are
Richard Coffing, Daryl Dawson, Wal
ter DeMeis, Val Frakes, Robert
Gwynn, James Morrison and Wil
liam Rupley.
