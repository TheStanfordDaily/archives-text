# Chorus Talent Is 'Top Notch' In Series Finale
## Offenbach Selections Evening's High Point 
### JACK BYRNE 
Last night's concert by the
Stanford Chorus and Chorale on
the Tuesday Evening Series
proved yet again that the local
singers need bow to none when
it comes to singing difficult
music.
But if the talent is top-notch, there
are times when it is thrown into the
listener's face. The first selections, a
group from Mozart's "Idomeneo,"
were prime examples. Mozart's mu
sic is far too delicate for a chorus of
150 voices.
As a soloist, Dorothy Foose was
not quite good enough to carry Mo
zart. Her voice had a tendency to
slide ever so slightly as she ap
proached the desired note.
MOZART MASS
The faults in the "Idomeneo"
groups were less noticeable in the
Mozart C minor Mass. Here the full
chorus did not seem so overwhelm
ing, nor did Miss Foose seem so
prone to stretch for notes.
Spelling the Chorus, the Chorale
sang a most pleasing group of mad
rigals, sampling Lassus, Thomas
Weelkes, Morley and Monteverdi.
The group was obviously well ac
quainted with its subject matter, and
sang with excellent feeling.
Aaron Copland's "The Lark" con
cluded the Chorale's portion of the
program, with the excellent baritone
solo rendered by Frederick Cone.
HIGH POINT
High point of the evening was the
group of six selections from Jacques
Offenbach's "La Belle Helene." The
chorus, along with soloists James
Nabhan, John Weber and Kean An
derson, tackled the tricky music
with a will.
Assistant Chorus conductor Kirke
Mechem led the chorus in the pre
mier performance of his own work,
"Rules for Behaviour," adapted from
a Virginia meeting house.
Mechem's work shows a great deal
of feeling for the potentials of a large
chorus, but the text of the rules gets
lost under the choral arrangement.
Ralph Vaughan Williams' Prologue
from the "Christmas Cantata" is not
Vaughan Williams at his best, and
seemed to be lost on the crowd which
filled Memorial Auditorium.
