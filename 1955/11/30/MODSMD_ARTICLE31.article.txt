## BACKTALK 
### 
Basketball season on the Pacific Coast gets under way this weekend and
PCC fans can expect to see an interesting race for the conference cham
pionship. *
The old North-South divisional set-up is no more as each team will
now play a round-robin schedule.
The pre-season favorites of most of the experts are UCLA and Wash
ington with Cal, USC, Oregon and Idaho considered as strong dark horses.
Also adding interest to the basketball picture is the new wide lane rule.
The rule, which widens the keyhole lane from six to 12 leet, is designed to
keep the big men away from the basket.
Here is how the conference teams shape up for the' coming season.
STANFORD
The Indians were hurt badly by the loss of Russ Lawler and Ron Tomsic
through graduation but have 5-9 George Selleck back to lead a fast and
accurate-shooting but small team.
Regulars Bill Bond and Barry Brown are back at their forward posts,
but the experience tapers off sharply behind them.
Clint Waring, Bob McGrath, Hick Vojvodich and Carlos Bea are in a
dogfight for the center position vhile the fifth position will probably go to
Hap Wagner or Jay Jackson.
Stanford is going to be handicapped considerably by lack of height.
WASHINGTON
The Huskies will floor a t/am averaging G-6 in height with,plenty of
scoring potential.
Stellar attractions will he '1-0 Gary Nelson at center and 6-8 Bruno Boin
at forward. Nelson, a junior does not have much experience and is fairly
clumsy, but he has shown spring ability and he will be rough to stop on
the boards.
Boin, a sophomore, was i high school All-American and the star of the
Washington frosh last year. jHe is smooth and has a near-unstoppable hook
shot from anywhere near tie basket.
Jim Coshow, 6-6; Karl \|oegtlin, 6-4; and Doyle Perkins, G-0, round out
the first string. /
WASHINGTON STATE
The Cougars are expected to wind up in the cellar of the nine-team cou
ference.
Coach Jack Friel lost almost his entire scoring punch when high-scoring
Ron Bennink and Bill Rehder graduated last year.
Returning veterans are Larry Beck, A 1 Kamps and A 1 Perry.
Friel has two 6-9 sophomores to work with in Bill Galbraith and Paul
Romhaar, but both are awkward and inexperienced.
It probably will be a long season in Pullman.
IDAHO
Idaho should be one of the best in the conference with two fine guards,
Bill Bauscher and Jay Buhler, returning and three 6-5 sophomore prospects
to man the front line. They are Jerry Jorgenson, Gary McEwen and Jack
Mitchell.
Coach Halan Hodges' men work from a set offense but have plenty of
speed and are tough on defense. If the big sophomores come through as
expected, Idaho will win more than their share of ball games.
OREGON STATE
Coach Slats Gill faces a rebuilding job after graduation practically deci
mated last year's coast championship squad. Besides those departed because
of graduation, Wade "Swede" Halbrook flunked out of school and Jay
Dean decided to give up basketball.
Best prospects for the Beavers are 6-6 sophomore Dave Gambee, 7-0
Fhil Shadoin and 6-0 Jerry Crimmins.
Shadoin has little besides his height, but Crimmins and Gambee are
potentially great. Crimmins holds the Oregon high school record for points
in a single game with 73, and Gambee is rated now as the equal of any
forward on last year's team.
Two other returning veterans are Larry Paulus and Bob Allord.
OREGON
The Ducks have a solid nucleus in 6-6 Max Anderson, Jerry Ross, Phil
McHugh and Ray Bell and a bunch of good JC transfers.
Oregon figures to have a good defensive club but may be shy on shooting
and rebounding.
Coach Bill Borcher will have trouble replacing Jim Loscutoff from last
year's team which finished second in the Northern Division.
Ross, in particular, has good potential and may blossom this year, and
Anderson is a steady performer at center.
CALIFORNIA
The Bears figure to be one of the stronger teams in the conference with
four returning regulars from last year. Gone is center Bob McKeen, but
ready to take his place is Duane Asplund, a JC transfer who missed all of
last year due to injuries.

Larry Friend and Bob Blake are back at forwards, and Mike Diaz, Gabe
Arrillaga and Frank Hess will take care of the guard situation.
Cal won't be strong on the backboards, but they have good shooters and
play tough defense.
UCLA
The Bruins are the best bet to take the conference championship. Al
though Johnny Moore and Don Bragg are gone from last year's Southern
Division champions, coach Johnny Wooden has high-jumping, hot-shoot
ing Morris Taft at guard and Willie Naulls at center.
Rounding out the first string are a trio of promising ability. They are
G-2 A 1 Herring, 5-10 Dave Hall and 6-6 Ben Rogers.
UCLA, as usual, will have a speedy, fast-breaking offense and will be
rugged under the boards.
The Bruins get a break in the schedule as they play Washington at home.
SOUTHERN CAL
The Trojans should have one of the better teams on the coast although
four regulars are gone from last year's squad.
Dependable Tony Psaltis, the one returning regular, will team at guard
with sophomore Larry Hauser.
A JC transfer, Ken Pearson, 6-5, will try to fill Roy Irvin's shoes at
center and lettermen Jim Kaufman and Jack Dunne will play the forwards.
The Trojan starters all stand between 6-2 and 6-5 in height so they
have the size. They also have the shooting, but a lot of the Trojan defense
was lost with the graduation of Dick Welsh.
If Kaufman, Pearson and Hauser come through, USC will be rough.
