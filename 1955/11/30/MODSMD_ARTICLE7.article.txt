# Truman Dodges issues At SF Press Conference
## Ex-President Hopes to Play Major Role In Campaign; Says He Likes All Demos 
### STEW TOY 
Former President Harry S. Truman, laughing and joking with
reporters, sidestepped most guestions in his San Francisco press
conference yesterday, but left no doubt that he would be an ardent
and eager campaigner in the 1956 political battle.
In the Bay Area to speak at last night's $100-a-plate fund-raising

banquet at the Fairmont Hotel for
his Memorial Library in Independ
ence, Mo., Truman again declined
to say whom he favors for the Dem
ocratic presidential nomination.
He said there are "more up-and
coming Democrats than ever before"
and that he "likes them all."
But his remarks, aimed at impar
tiality, nevertheless intimated his
possible preference for New York's
Governor Averell Harriman.
"I like the governor of New York
very, very much," Truman said,
grinning broadly. "He's a good Dem
ocrat."
Truman also liked Adlai Steven
son and Estes Kefauver, the two
other prominently-mentioned candi
dates, "very much."
"They've all been to see me, and
I had a good time talking to them.
I like all of them."
Truman sat at a low table in the
Fairmont's Cable Car Room, sur
rounded by reporters, newsreel cam
eras and microphones.
He wore a dark blue suit and a
blue and white four-in-hand tie—
not the familiar bow tie which was
a trade-mark while he occupied the
White House.
EVASIVE
He talked and quipped good-na
turedly with reporters as though
they were old friends, but managed
to avoid straightforward answers to
most of their questions.
Asked if he would consider ac
cepting the Democratic nomination
himself, the former Chief Executive
gave reporters an emphatic "no."
When they reminded him of his
previous statement that he "would

run if I were 90," he laughed and
said he had learned 1974 would be
an off-year.
Truman said he hopes to go to the
Democratic Convention as a dele
gate, and that if he does he will an
nounce his candidate preference be
fore the convention opens.
CAMPAIGN "FUN"
He said he also hopes to help write
the Democratic platform next year,
as well as to participate in the "fun"
of campaigning. There can't be "any
fun in a campaign" unless someone
puts on a good one, he said, "and I
intend to help put one on next year."
Asked whether he thought foreign
policy would be a major issue in the
campaign, Truman answered by
blaming Republicans for bringing
foreign policy into the partisan lime
light.
"It should never have been put
into politics. The Republicans put it
there, so we'll have to discuss it."
Refusing to pick a probable Re
publican nominee, Truman said he
was "not nominating for the Repub
licans."
But he saw "nothing wrong" with
a Republican "draft Warren" move
ment, citing the example of Supreme
Court Chief Justice Charles Evans
Hughes as a precedent for such ac
tion.
Truman refused to criticize the
Eisenhower Administration, saying
he had been President and thus
"knows how it feels" to be criticised.
Emphasizing his purpose in com
ing to San Francisco, he said he is
here only "for the purpose of pre
serving the history of the country."

and eager campaigner in the 1956 political battle.
In the Bay Area to speak at last night's $100-a-plate fund-raising

banquet at the Fairmont Hotel for
his Memorial Library in Independ
ence, Mo., Truman again declined
to say whom he favors for the Dem
ocratic presidential nomination.
He said there are "more up-and
coming Democrats than ever before"
and that he "likes them all."
But his remarks, aimed at impar
tiality, nevertheless intimated his
possible preference for New York's
Governor Averell Harriman.
"I like the governor of New York
very, very much," Truman said,
grinning broadly. "He's a good Dem
ocrat."
Truman also liked Adlai Steven
son and Estes Kefauver, the two
other prominently-mentioned candi
dates, "very much."
"They've all been to see me, and
I had a good time talking to them.
I like all of them."
Truman sat at a low table in the
Fairmont's Cable Car Room, sur
rounded by reporters, newsreel cam
eras and microphones.
He wore a dark blue suit and a
blue and white four-in-hand tie—
not the familiar bow tie which was
a trade-mark while he occupied the
White House.
EVASIVE
He talked and quipped good-na
turedly with reporters as though
they were old friends, but managed
to avoid straightforward answers to
most of their questions.
Asked if he would consider ac
cepting the Democratic nomination
himself, the former Chief Executive
gave reporters an emphatic "no."
When they reminded him of his
previous statement that he "would

run if I were 90," he laughed and
said he had learned 1974 would be
an off-year.
Truman said he hopes to go to the
Democratic Convention as a dele
gate, and that if he does he will an
nounce his candidate preference be
fore the convention opens.
CAMPAIGN "FUN"
He said he also hopes to help write
the Democratic platform next year,
as well as to participate in the "fun"
of campaigning. There can't be "any
fun in a campaign" unless someone
puts on a good one, he said, "and I
intend to help put one on next year."
Asked whether he thought foreign
policy would be a major issue in the
campaign, Truman answered by
blaming Republicans for bringing
foreign policy into the partisan lime
light.
"It should never have been put
into politics. The Republicans put it
there, so we'll have to discuss it."
Refusing to pick a probable Re
publican nominee, Truman said he
was "not nominating for the Repub
licans."
But he saw "nothing wrong" with
a Republican "draft Warren" move
ment, citing the example of Supreme
Court Chief Justice Charles Evans
Hughes as a precedent for such ac
tion.
Truman refused to criticize the
Eisenhower Administration, saying
he had been President and thus
"knows how it feels" to be criticised.
Emphasizing his purpose in com
ing to San Francisco, he said he is
here only "for the purpose of pre
serving the history of the country."
