## Those French Are At It Again: Faure Government Ousted 
### 
PARIS, Nov. 29 (UP) â€” The r
nine-month-old government of
Premier Edgar Faure fell to- j
night, under assault both by the
Communists and the followers
of ex - Premier Pierre Mendes-
France.
Faure was thrown from power
when he lost an Assembly confidence
vote on his plea for early new elec
tions by a crushing 100-vote margin.
The official tally was 318 to 238.
The decisive vote plunged France
into another government crisis. It
set President Rene Coty on a search
for someone to serve as the nation's
22nd postwar premier in what Faure i
himself termed the "eternal merry- ;
go-round" of French governments.
The Communists, who saved Faure
from defeat in a similar vote only
two weeks ago, scaled his govern
ment's fall today by throwing their
94 votes against him. But the fall of
the 47-year-old Faure was above all
a victory for his one-time friend
and fellow Radical Socialist, Men
des-France.
