## 
### 
WASHINGTON—Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles today tinn
ed a cold shoulder —at-least for now
—on a Russian offer'to stop testing
A-bombs and H-bombs if other

atomic powers will follow suit.
Dulles told a news conference that
many months of study by the United
States had failed to produce an ef
fective method for banning nuclear
tests and protecting the interests of
the free world.
Other American officials used
stronger language privately. They
termed the Soviet offer a propa
ganda gesture designed to counter
act adverse world reaction to Rus

sia's recent explosion of its most
powerful H-bomb yet.
