Tliere's a refreshing newness to Science in Sound's approach to
High Fidelity. It's in the dedication of their engineers to the
achievement of sound reproduction that duplicates all tonal
ranges. That's true high fidelity—not the usual by-product of
• copywriter's soaring enthusiasm.
Here, too, is the philosophy that sound reproduction systems
must be engineered to both the user's listening tastes and his
listening environment.
Visit their room of heavenly sound . . . you'll be amazed by
the absence of "selling." Listen to your heart's content to the
various sound systems. Achieve the balance and tonal effect you
like best, talk to the design engineers—and then if all factors
meet your specifications, get down to the business of purchasing
the ideal reproduction system for your needs.
