THE
ALUMINUM INDUSTRY
WAS BORN ON
SMALLMAN V In 1888, the aluminum industry consisted of one company
located in an unimpressive little building on the east side of
STREET Pittsburgh. It was called The Pittsburgh Reduction Company.
The men of this company had real engineering abilities and
viewed the work to be done with an imagineering eye. But
they were much more than that. They were pioneers . . ;
leaders ... men of vision.
A lot has happened since 1888. The country ... the
company . . . and the industry have grown up. Ten new
territories have become states, for one thing. T he total
industry now employs more than 1,000,000 people—
and the little outfit on Smallman Street? Well, it's a lot
bigger, too—and the name has been changed to Alcoa.
Aluminum Company of America ... but it's still the
leader—still the place for engineering "firsts."
