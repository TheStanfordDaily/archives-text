(A message from IBM —where progress is engineered)
Pioneer - jS,
{■' —'
v \S In simplest possible terms, there are two basic courses
open to you when you apply your engineering degree in
ft the business world...you can "routineer" or pioneer. As
a routineer you will fill in the details of other men's
O concepts. As a pioneer you will operate on the frontiers
of your chosen field—helping originate new concepts.
Which course you follow depends largely oil the field you
select and the company you join.
) vil/ There is underway today, in business, science, and govern
ment, a quiet but far-reaching revolution in the automation
Ii f\ of office equipment and procedures. The use of electronic
c> /, v, tl / data processing machines—for performing complex scien
| A \Y\j /> computations ... for handling huge volumes of business
\L /\ I / data—is still in its infancy. For engineers in data
J N <i-J / 112 \a processing, new horizons unfold in endless succession.
(j[ J IB\l's leadership in tjie field of data processing is due
irtgj|fc\ largely to our reliance on pioneer engineering. Many
years ago IBM deliberately set out to build the kind of
ll'/ engineering climate... the facilities, the freedom, the
, \ associations ... that would attract and stimulate the pioneer.
r If tjou want to pioneer in a dynamic new field, IBM offers
i\Y A\ an opportunity to make important and rewarding
i""»tJ \ contributions.
