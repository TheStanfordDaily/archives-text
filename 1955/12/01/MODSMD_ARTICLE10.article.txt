Today's goal for Stanford: Not a single traffic accident for 24 hours.
Stanford is participating in the second annual "S-D Day" (safe
driving) sponsored by the President's Committee for Traflic Safety.
Overall goal for the United States is to go without an accident in
the nation.
Stanford Police Chief Gordon Davis urged all students to drive with
extra caution, and all pedestrians to walk safely, keeping Stanford free
of accidents.
"Of course, we'd like to make every day S-D day," Davis said.
