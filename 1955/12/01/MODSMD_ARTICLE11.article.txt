# LASSU Votes to Purchase Cinema Scope Equipment
## Sunday Flicks Charge Climbs to 25 Cents To Finance Installation of New Apparatus 
### DICK MEISTER Associate Editor, The Daily 
ASSU Legislature voted in a "new look" for the Sunday Flicks
last night—a five-cent price rise and installation of CinemaScope
equipment.
New Flick admission of 25 cents will begin this Sunday night.
The new equipment, however, won't be completely installed until

beginning of winter quarter—at a
total estimated $3242.41 outlay.
Main CinemaScope item will be
"motorized masking," which is
sheeting which covers the screen
borders and can reduce the screen's
width to normal, non-CinemaScope
size when ordinary features are
shown.
Other innovations include new
lenses and projector modification.
At the new admission price Flick di
rectors estimate that about six quar
ters will be required to pay for the
CinemaScope additions.
They say that now Sunday night
shows can exhibit almost every
process of movie-making in opera
tion today. (With the exception of
Cinerama and Todd A-O, of course.)
Legislature went round and round
on the question of "anarchy" vs.

"ethics" in a Publications Board
discussion.
In the board's by-laws Aug. 15 is
set as the date for split of Quad
profits. Tom Waterhouse, last year's
Quad business manager, told the
group that this date was "unreal
istic."
ACCOUNTS OUTSTANDING
He pointed out that many adver
tisers' accounts were still outstand
ing at that date and hence disbursal
of profits to Quad staffers wasn't
fair. Legislature, on the other hand,
pointed out that "a by-law is a by
law" and could see no legal way
to give the Quad a fair profit split.
The group seemed to feel that it
was "ethically right" to present a
split of the money collected on de
linquent accounts after the Aug. 15
date to the staff, but was blocked
from that action because they could
find no legal way to do it.
They expressed worry about tak
ing matters into their own hands.
"Anarchy," one member put it.
"If someone can think of a legal
motion, it will be entertained—and
entertaining," President George
Ralph commented.
NO LEGAL MOTION
No one could and the matter was
put aside for later discussion.
The meeting was the last of the
quarter, with the next one sched
uled for the first Wednesday of win
ter quarter.
Branner Representative Joanne
Savage vacated her office because
she's moving to Hawthorne. The va
cant chair will be filled by Carolee
Houser, who was approved for the
post last night.
"Lame duck" Legislature mem
bers who finished their terms'last
night because of the removal of
class representatives from the body
were: Bob Bowden, freshman repre
sentative; Jon Cosovich, sophomore;
Dave Brownwood, junior, and Via
Porizky, graduate.

Other innovations include new
lenses and projector modification.
At the new admission price Flick di
rectors estimate that about six quar
ters will be required to pay for the
CinemaScope additions.
They say that now Sunday night
shows can exhibit almost every
process of movie-making in opera
tion today. (With the exception of
Cinerama and Todd A-O, of course.)
Legislature went round and round
on the question of "anarchy" vs.

"ethics" in a Publications Board
discussion.
In the board's by-laws Aug. 15 is
set as the date for split of Quad
profits. Tom Waterhouse, last year's
Quad business manager, told the
group that this date was "unreal
istic."
ACCOUNTS OUTSTANDING
He pointed out that many adver
tisers' accounts were still outstand
ing at that date and hence disbursal
of profits to Quad staffers wasn't
fair. Legislature, on the other hand,
pointed out that "a by-law is a by
law" and could see no legal way
to give the Quad a fair profit split.
The group seemed to feel that it
was "ethically right" to present a
split of the money collected on de
linquent accounts after the Aug. 15
date to the staff, but was blocked
from that action because they could
find no legal way to do it.
They expressed worry about tak
ing matters into their own hands.
"Anarchy," one member put it.
"If someone can think of a legal
motion, it will be entertained—and
entertaining," President George
Ralph commented.
NO LEGAL MOTION
No one could and the matter was
put aside for later discussion.
The meeting was the last of the
quarter, with the next one sched
uled for the first Wednesday of win
ter quarter.
Branner Representative Joanne
Savage vacated her office because
she's moving to Hawthorne. The va
cant chair will be filled by Carolee
Houser, who was approved for the
post last night.
"Lame duck" Legislature mem
bers who finished their terms'last
night because of the removal of
class representatives from the body
were: Bob Bowden, freshman repre
sentative; Jon Cosovich, sophomore;
Dave Brownwood, junior, and Via
Porizky, graduate.
ASSU Legislature voted in a "new look" for the Sunday Flicks
last night—a five-cent price rise and installation of CinemaScope
equipment.
New Flick admission of 25 cents will begin this Sunday night.
The new equipment, however, won't be completely installed until

beginning of winter quarter—at a
total estimated $3242.41 outlay.
Main CinemaScope item will be
"motorized masking," which is
sheeting which covers the screen
borders and can reduce the screen's
width to normal, non-CinemaScope
size when ordinary features are
shown.
Other innovations include new
lenses and projector modification.
