# Church to Recruit Frosh Distributors
## 
### 
Memorial Church Committee will
hold a meeting tonight at 7:15 in
Soto Lounge of Wilbur. All fresh
man men interested in helping to
distribute the new brochure, "Invi
tation to Worship," are invited.
According to Assistant Chaplain
David H. Romeis, the brochure's
purpose is to familiarize new stu
dents with church activities open to
student participation and with the
church services.
Brochures will be distributed next
week to all frosh men. Freshman
women will be able to receive copies
of "Invitation to Worship" later in
this quarter or early in Winter
Quarter.
