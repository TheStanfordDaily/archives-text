# Ghoultide Season Is Here
## 
### 
ADDAMSELS IN DISTRESS â€” Three carolers shiver as their
holiday spirits are dampened by Charles Addams-like ghoul
tiders preparing for the sophomore dance to be held in the
Women's Gymnasium tomorrow night. Johnny Vaughns Band
will provide music for the dressy sport dance, and tickets will
be sold at the door. The theme will be accentuated by black
Christmas trees and silver cobweb decorations.
