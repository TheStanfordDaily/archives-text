# safe driving every day
## 
### 
Today is national Safe-Driving Day.
The aims of S-D Day are these:
1. "Not a single traffic accident during the
24 hours of Dec. I—in1 —in daylight or darkness."
2. "Year-around public support for year-
traffic safety programs of proven ef
fectiveness."
But the immediate problem is an S-D Day on
the campus and, more important, safe driving
every day on campus.
We all contribute materially to one day's
successful traffic safety campaign just by
obeying campus speed limits, stopping at stop
signs and showing driver - pedestrian -cour
tesy.
But what about the "year - around traffic
safety program of proven effectiveness"? A
student committee is studying the immediate

traffic problems and has made positive sug
gestions which should lead to such a program
of effectiveness.
Stanford is close to the El Camino and Bay
shore traffic hazard, and it only took the Big
Game influx to show the need for effective
planning. The co-operative efforts of state and
local traffic officers resulted in a more smooth
ly-geared traffic flow than had been seer, in
many a year.
A single Safe-Driving Day can demonstrate
that accidents can be reduced when drivers
and pedestrians fulfill their personal responsi
bility for safety. Last year's S-D Day showed
a 15 per cent reduction in traffic deaths from
the previous year.
With a little effort, it can be done all 365
days.
