# one more meeting ...
## 
### 
The ASSU Cabinet is, constitutionally, an
organization with no powers and practically
no responsibilities.
It was created in the constitution ratified by
the student body last spring, and is author
ized to co-ordinate campus activities and to
advise the executive branch of the student
government.
The first time it met, early in the quarter, the
Cabinet did little more than go through the
motions. But none the less, there were indi
cations that the Cabinet could amount to some
thing, could be a constructive force, or perhaps
even a leading force on the campus.
Sufficient leadership, either from the chair,
or from the membership, was lacking and the
meeting fizzled.

In the first meeting the members made an
attempt. Many of them felt that accomplish
ments were possible. They started the ball
rolling, but nobody gave it an extra needed
push. The only real decision was to hold
one more meeting before the end of the
quarter.
Chairman and ASSU President George
Ralph has called that "one more meeting" for
tonight at 7:30 in Bowman.
It's too late in this quarter to do much more
than start working in the right direction. The
Cabinet can, however, formulate an agenda
to work on next year.
With a sound program as a foundation, a
vigorous, ambitious Cabinet could do a needed
job. We hope it will.
