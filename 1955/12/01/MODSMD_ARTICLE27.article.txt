What do you think should be done with the
Stanford Axe?
On Nov. 19, the Associated Students of the
University of California, through Governor
Goodwin J. Knight, presented the Axe to the
Associated Students of Stanford University.
Then it disappeared—right into the vaults of
the American Trust Company in downtown
Palo Alto.
After eight years the Axe is back home and
many feel that it should be displayed—some
where.
Here are some of the suggestions made by
students themselves. Most of those asked the
question-of-the-week agreed that the trophy
should be displayed where students could
admire it, some were apathetic and a few be
lieved it should remain out of sight.
Marilyn Stein, '56, Jordan: "The Axe should
be put on display in a place where everyone
goes—the Cellar. As long as the Axe is a tra
dition, we should display it."
Betty Klippstein, '58, off-campus: "I suggest
the library. Theoretically, the library is a well
visited place. And visitors are likely to come
into the library."
Per Reichborn, '56, off-campus: "I think
President Sterling should keep it in his home

or it should be put in the Stanford Museum."
John Shepard, '57, Encina: "The idea of dis
playing the Axe in a theft-proof case sounds
like a pretty good one to me. If we could
either locate the old case or have a new one
constructed, the Axe could be placed in the
Cellar where any student could take a look
at it."
Cleve Trauqhher, '59, Wilbur Hall: "Give it
to me. I know what to do with it."
Arthur Bosworth, '57, off-campus: "It ought
to be burned. I think the Axe is a let of non
sense."
Bob Taylor, '59, Wilbur Hall: "I think it
should be displayed in a prominent, yet theft
proof place. It ought to be put in the new
Student Union (Tresidder Union) v/hen it is
built."
Jack Martin, '59, Wilbur Hall: "I think it
should be locked up on top of Hoover Tower
where Cal can't get it.
Jack Brumbaugh, '57, off-campus: "My sug
gestion would be to put it in a bank vault
downtown and leave it there. This would min
imize its effect on the annual autumn mad
ness."
Those are a few suggestions. What do you
think?
