# Faure Turns Tables, Dissolves Assembly
## 
### 
PARlS—Premier Edgar Faure de
cided tonight to dissolve the Na
tional Assembly, which voted no
confidence in him, and order new
elections.

The defeated premier thus turned
the tables on the assembly which
had refused to go along with his re
quest for early elections and voted
no confidence in him for that very
reason.
At a stormy session lasting more
than three hours, Faure and his
center-rightist coaliiton cabinet de
cided not to resign as other premiers
have done on losing a confidence
vote, but to put the Deputies in the
assembly out of office instead.
Not since 1877 has a government
leader dared dissolve Parliament.
That attempt, by a President, so
weakened the power of the execu
tive it never was tried again—until
today.
