From far-flung corners of Quad,
here's what professors are saying:
Philip W. Harsh, professor of clas
| sic s, on natural law: "Natural law
t reminds me of our former president,
IVIr. Wilbur, whom I've heard say
from this platform, 'In your life at
Stanford, make your head rule your
life and not your glands.'"
Wilfred 11. Sioue, assistant profes-
I sor of English, on the atheistic: ten-
I dencies of Western Civ: "Everyone
should lose his religion at lea s t
! once."
Georges F. Lemaitre, professor of
Romanic language::, on equitation: "I
hate horses! I learned to ride a horse
in the French army and it left a
i permanent scar."
