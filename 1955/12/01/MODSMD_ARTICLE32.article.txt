4 i was born in the South 'fo de wah,' and as my parents were slave
holders, I grew up among the Negroes."
Branner heard many Negro folklore stories in their cabins of Ten
nessee during the 1850's. They were so interesting to him that he wrote
them into his "How and Why Stories" for children.
The book contains 22 stories written in Negro dialect. The titles of
some of the stories are "Why the Palms of Negroes' Hands Are White";
"Why the Snake Has No Feet"; "How the Cat Came to Have Nine
Lives"; and "Why the Good Lord Allows the Devil to Live."
Branner states in his introduction titled "A Mere Matter of the
Feelings (To be omitted by those who arc in a hurry)" that many of
the stories were later made famous by Joel Chandler Harris in Uncle
Renins' stories.
He wrote them down as nearly as he could recall having heard them
"in the hope that they may interest other generations of children." The
book was published in 1921.
He remembered that he was once punished l>y his mother for think
ing "Negroes were more interesting and better company than white
folks."
