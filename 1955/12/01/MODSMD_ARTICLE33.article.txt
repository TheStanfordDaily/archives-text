## Branner's Daughter Says He Almost Became Preacher 
### 
"And he almost became a Methodist preacher."
Those were the words of Branner's daughter, Mrs. F. H. Fowler
of 363 Kingsley in Palo Alto, who explained that her father was
studying for the ministry at Maryville College in Tennessee.
Her father studied Latin and Greek at Maryville in preparation

for becoming a Methodist preacher.
But after he entered Cornell he
became very interested in geological
investigation which made him drop
his preaching ambitions.
When asked whether she remem
bered whether or not Dr. Branner
continued to teach geology after
taking on the administrative duties
of vice-president in 1898, Mrs. Fow
ler answered by repeating an oft
quoted saying of her father:
"I wouldn't let anyone teach the
elementary course in geology but
myself. I want to introduce my own
course."
She recalls that "the classes were
held at 8 in the morning in one of
the large lecture rooms and some of
the students would come straggling
In late. To remedy this, he would
lock*the door at 8 sharp. But some
students would climb through the
windows."
