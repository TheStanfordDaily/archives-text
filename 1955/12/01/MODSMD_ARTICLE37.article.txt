# John Casper Branner Trained By Jordan for Farm Presidency
## He First Headed Geology, Mining Department 
### FRANK HUNTRESS 
When President David Starr
Jordan assumed the newly-cre
ated position of Chancellor of
Stanford University in 1913, he
did not leave the Board of Trus
tees without a more - than - ca
pable replacement.
There was only one man on the
Farm who could have handled the
job, and 'he was trained by Jordan
himself. In fact, he had been a fra
ternity brother and close friend of
the University's first President for
43 years .
The man —John Casper Branner.
He was born on the family farm
at New Market in Jefferson County.
Tenn., on Independence Day of IPL<U.
His family was among th~ early
settlers in the Shenandoah Valley of
Virginia where his ar.estors receiv
ed a grant of land j«m Lord Fairfax
in 1760.
Branner received his early educa
tion in local Schools "which were not
of a high grade, but of which he
made th_ most, being of an active,
energetic and inquiring disposition."
COLLEGE AT 16
At the age of 16 he entered Mary
ville College near Knoxville where
he .remained two years preparing for
the ministry.
In the fall of 1870 Branner enrolled
in Cornell University at Ithaca, N. Y.
It was here that he decided not to
continue in the ministry. Instead he
developed his natural scientific ten
dencies, which soon attracted the at
tention of his geology professor and
prompted the first of many geologi
cal expeditions to Brazil.
At Cornell he became acquainted
with Jordan. Both were members of
the Delta Upsilon fraternity and a
club known as "The Struggle for
Existence" composed of youths
working their way through college.
Branner received the B.S. degree
from Cornell in 1882 and the Ph.D.
degree from Indiana three years
later.
THREE CHILDREN
In 1883 he married Susan D. Ken
nedy of Oneida, N. Y., by whom he
had three children.
Mrs. Branner was the sister of one
of her husband's Cornell classmates.
She died in May, 1953, at the age of
97, having lived at her campus home
at 560 Alvarado Row for 61 years.
Upon receiving the Ph.D. degree,
Branner was made a professor of
geology at Indiana—the same year
his friend Jordan became its presi
dent. Branner remained at Indiana
until 1887 when he became state ge
ologist for Arkansas.
He was called upon by Jordan to
head the geology and mining de
partment at the newly-founded Le
land Stanford Junior University in
1891. He accepted and moved to the
West Coast University.
LEARNED DUTIES
At Stanford Branner organized the
geological studies' program and in
1898 he assumed the administrative
duties of vice-president. He con
tinued to teach geology at the Uni
versity throughout the remainder of
his active career.
During his term as vice-president
he became very familiar with duties
of the President, taking control

whenever Jordan had to leave the
University.
On Oct. 22. 1913—exactly 22 years
after Jordan's inauguration, Bran
ner took the oath of office, becoming
the second President of the Univer
sity.
It was at this Branner's inaugura
tion that the student body presented
him with the Presidential Chair, a
symbol of the office.
As he had more and more admin- I
istrative details piled on him, Bran
ner never forgot that he was first a
geologist and teacher.
His ideals of a geologist's training
were high: culture, history, philoso
phy, a good reading ability in Latin,
French and German, mathematics
and the foundations of chemistry
and engineering.
NO MONEY IN GEOLOGY
He was once quoted as saying:
"The man who goes into geology
because there is money in it, will in
nine cases out of 10 make a failure j
of it—he will get neither the money
nor the geology."
Being one of the top geologists in
the country, Branner was a member
of the National Academy of Sciences.
He was also a member of the Ameri
can Geological Society of which he
served a term as president.
He held membership in the foreign j
societies of London, Edinburgh and
Brazil.
Most of his writings were on geo
logical subjects, but being a good
linguist he wrote one of the first
grammars of the Portuguese lan
guage. He gained the knowledge of
Portuguese while on his geological
missions in South America.
He also translated from the Por
tuguese Alexander Herculano's "His
tory of the Origin and Establishment
of the Inquisition in Portugal."
SOUTHERN STORIES
The "How and Why Stories" pub
lished in 1921 for children reflect his
early days in the South.
Appended to the President's an

nual report of 1913 was the usual
list of publications. One noted was
President Branner's own '"Casper
Branner of Virginia and His De
scendents" — a 450-page volume of
genealogy.
Upon reaching the established
University age limit of 65 in 1915,
Branner retired with the title of
president emeritus which he held
until his death.
While working on a geological
project in Arkansas in 1920 Branner
injured his heart. Most of the fol
lowing one and a haif years he was
confined to his campus home as an
invalid.
He was very restless during this
period because he had planned an
other scientific expedition to Brazil,
but his health would not permit it.
On Valentine's Day of 1922 the
children of his neighborhood sent
little Valentine cards to him. These
cards were at his bedside when he
died on Mar. 1, at the age of 71.

Upon receiving the Ph.D. degree,
Branner was made a professor of
geology at Indiana—the same year
his friend Jordan became its presi

His ideals of a geologist's training
were high: culture, history, philoso

French and German, mathematics
and the foundations of chemistry
and engineering.
NO MONEY IN GEOLOGY
He was once quoted as saying:
"The man who goes into geology
because there is money in it, will in
nine cases out of 10 make a failure j

Most of his writings were on geo
logical subjects, but being a good
linguist he wrote one of the first
grammars of the Portuguese lan
guage. He gained the knowledge of
Portuguese while on his geological
missions in South America.
He also translated from the Por

At Cornell he became acquainted
with Jordan. Both were members of
the Delta Upsilon fraternity and a

JOHN CASPER BRANNER
When President David Starr
Jordan assumed the newly-cre
ated position of Chancellor of
Stanford University in 1913, he
did not leave the Board of Trus
tees without a more - than - ca
pable replacement.
There was only one man on the
Farm who could have handled the
job, and 'he was trained by Jordan
himself. In fact, he had been a fra
ternity brother and close friend of
the University's first President for
43 years .
The man —John Casper Branner.
He was born on the family farm
at New Market in Jefferson County.
Tenn., on Independence Day of IPL<U.
His family was among th~ early
settlers in the Shenandoah Valley of
Virginia where his ar.estors receiv
ed a grant of land j«m Lord Fairfax
in 1760.
Branner received his early educa
tion in local Schools "which were not
of a high grade, but of which he
made th_ most, being of an active,
energetic and inquiring disposition."
COLLEGE AT 16
At the age of 16 he entered Mary
ville College near Knoxville where
he .remained two years preparing for
the ministry.
In the fall of 1870 Branner enrolled
in Cornell University at Ithaca, N. Y.
It was here that he decided not to
continue in the ministry. Instead he
developed his natural scientific ten
dencies, which soon attracted the at
tention of his geology professor and
prompted the first of many geologi
cal expeditions to Brazil.
At Cornell he became acquainted
with Jordan. Both were members of
the Delta Upsilon fraternity and a
club known as "The Struggle for
Existence" composed of youths
working their way through college.
Branner received the B.S. degree
from Cornell in 1882 and the Ph.D.
degree from Indiana three years
later.
THREE CHILDREN
In 1883 he married Susan D. Ken
nedy of Oneida, N. Y., by whom he
had three children.
Mrs. Branner was the sister of one
of her husband's Cornell classmates.
She died in May, 1953, at the age of
97, having lived at her campus home
at 560 Alvarado Row for 61 years.
Upon receiving the Ph.D. degree,
Branner was made a professor of
geology at Indiana—the same year
his friend Jordan became its presi
dent. Branner remained at Indiana
until 1887 when he became state ge
ologist for Arkansas.
He was called upon by Jordan to
head the geology and mining de
partment at the newly-founded Le
land Stanford Junior University in
1891. He accepted and moved to the
West Coast University.
LEARNED DUTIES
At Stanford Branner organized the
geological studies' program and in
1898 he assumed the administrative
duties of vice-president. He con
tinued to teach geology at the Uni
versity throughout the remainder of
his active career.
During his term as vice-president
he became very familiar with duties
of the President, taking control

whenever Jordan had to leave the
University.
On Oct. 22. 1913—exactly 22 years
after Jordan's inauguration, Bran
ner took the oath of office, becoming
the second President of the Univer
sity.
It was at this Branner's inaugura
tion that the student body presented
him with the Presidential Chair, a
symbol of the office.
As he had more and more admin- I
istrative details piled on him, Bran
ner never forgot that he was first a
geologist and teacher.
His ideals of a geologist's training
were high: culture, history, philoso
phy, a good reading ability in Latin,
French and German, mathematics
and the foundations of chemistry
and engineering.
NO MONEY IN GEOLOGY
He was once quoted as saying:
"The man who goes into geology
because there is money in it, will in
nine cases out of 10 make a failure j
of it—he will get neither the money
nor the geology."
Being one of the top geologists in
the country, Branner was a member
of the National Academy of Sciences.
He was also a member of the Ameri
can Geological Society of which he
served a term as president.
He held membership in the foreign j
societies of London, Edinburgh and
Brazil.
Most of his writings were on geo
logical subjects, but being a good
linguist he wrote one of the first
grammars of the Portuguese lan
guage. He gained the knowledge of
