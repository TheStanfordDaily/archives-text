# Brazil Became 'Second Home' For Branner
## He Undertook Many Geological Surveys 
### 
While an undergraduate at
Cornell University, John Casper
Branner developed his natural
scientific tendency which at
tracted the attention of his geol
ogy professor.
The professor, Dr. C. I. Hartt, in
vited Branner to accompany him on
a scientific, venture to Brazil—the
first of many such trips which led
Branner to adopt the South Ameri
can country as his second home.
In 1874 he sailed with Professor
Hartt for Rio de Janeiro where he
remained for six years.
Brazil at this time was a country
which was little known geologically
and the expedition was of impor
tance in being the first serious at
tempt at systematic work.
GEOLOGY SURVEY
The Brazilian government, there
fore, established the Imperial Geo
logical Survey. Hartt was made di
rector and Branner, his assistant.
This work was discontinued in
1877 when Branner became associ
ated with a gold mine company in
the state of Minas Geraes.
He returned to New York in 1880,
but in a few months he was back
in Brazil—this time in the employ
of Thomas Edison. He went to South
America searching for a vegetable
fiber of a "quality suitable for in
candescent lights."
On his return to the United States
a year later he was commissioned
by the United States Department of
Agriculture to study the cotton cul
ture question in Brazil (1882-1884).
Back in this country after his third
Brazilian visit, Branner received an
appointment as topographer on the
Geological Survey of Pennsylvania.
He served there for two years.
THREE BRAZIL TRIPS
While connected with Stanford—
which was the last 30 years of his
life—Branner made three more trips
to Brazil. He went there to study
the ocean reefs lying off the coast of
Pernambuca (1899); to study the
black diamond areas of Bahia and
the geology of the states of Alagoas
and Sergipe (1907); and to study
further the Brazilian coast (1911).
His work in Brazil was "sufficient
to cause the Brazilian government
to foLlow it up." They employed an
other American as the official gov
ernment geologist for the state of
Sao Paulo.
The final geological work of im
portance in Branner's life came after
his retirement from the University
presidency. He compiled a geologi
cal map, with explanatory text, of
Brazil which was published in Eng
lish and Portuguese by the Geologi
cal Society of America.

Geological Survey of Pennsylvania.
He served there for two years.
THREE BRAZIL TRIPS
While connected with Stanford—
which was the last 30 years of his
life—Branner made three more trips
to Brazil. He went there to study
the ocean reefs lying off the coast of
Pernambuca (1899); to study the
black diamond areas of Bahia and
the geology of the states of Alagoas
and Sergipe (1907); and to study
further the Brazilian coast (1911).
His work in Brazil was "sufficient
to cause the Brazilian government
to foLlow it up." They employed an
other American as the official gov
ernment geologist for the state of
Sao Paulo.
The final geological work of im
portance in Branner's life came after
his retirement from the University
presidency. He compiled a geologi
cal map, with explanatory text, of
Brazil which was published in Eng
lish and Portuguese by the Geologi
cal Society of America.
While an undergraduate at
Cornell University, John Casper
Branner developed his natural
scientific tendency which at
tracted the attention of his geol
ogy professor.
The professor, Dr. C. I. Hartt, in
vited Branner to accompany him on
a scientific, venture to Brazil—the
first of many such trips which led
Branner to adopt the South Ameri
can country as his second home.
In 1874 he sailed with Professor
Hartt for Rio de Janeiro where he
remained for six years.
Brazil at this time was a country
which was little known geologically
and the expedition was of impor
tance in being the first serious at
tempt at systematic work.
GEOLOGY SURVEY
The Brazilian government, there
fore, established the Imperial Geo
logical Survey. Hartt was made di
rector and Branner, his assistant.
This work was discontinued in
1877 when Branner became associ
ated with a gold mine company in
the state of Minas Geraes.
He returned to New York in 1880,
but in a few months he was back
in Brazil—this time in the employ
of Thomas Edison. He went to South
America searching for a vegetable
fiber of a "quality suitable for in
candescent lights."
On his return to the United States
a year later he was commissioned
by the United States Department of
Agriculture to study the cotton cul
ture question in Brazil (1882-1884).
Back in this country after his third
Brazilian visit, Branner received an
appointment as topographer on the
Geological Survey of Pennsylvania.
He served there for two years.
