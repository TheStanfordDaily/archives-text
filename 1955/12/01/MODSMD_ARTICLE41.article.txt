## Taylor Effigy Handed at Banquet; Tarr Wins Honor for Second Time 
### 
For the second consecutive year senior fullback Bill Tarr was
named Stanford's outstanding football player.
.Tarr received the Zeimer Award, representing his selection, at
the second annual Stanford Football Awards banquet held last
night at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco.
More than 550 saw the Tarr presentation and heard President

Wallace Sterling's comment:
"I'm happy to add my compliments
to those which have already been
expressed. I am delighted to report
that on my travels throughout the
state and the country I've received
compliments for the football team,
no* only for their play but for their
conduct off the field.
"They are fine representatives of
Stanford University."
Tarr's award was voted on by the
players themselves as were those
given to Chris Marshall and Gary
Van Galder.
Marshall, senior tackle and hono
rary co-captain this year, received
the "Players' Player" Award do
nated by Roos Bros. Coach Chuck
Taylor said Marshall was "the man
I've been trying to sell to newspa
permen for some time" as the best
tackle in the conference.
The DeSwarte - Eller Most - Out
standing Sophomore Award went to
end Van Galder.
Senior quarterback Jack Lewis
was chosen as "Most Inspirational
Player" by the coaching staff, re
ceiving the Purcell Award.

When Taylor was introduced he
received a standing ovation and
when the crowd looked up there was
Taylor — hanged in effigy over a
Golden Room balcony.
The dummy of Taylor was in com
plete football uniform.
Said Taylor, "I'm very happy I
finally made the team."
Marshall and Tarr, season cap
tains, brought in Stanford's long
absent Axe. Student Financial Man
ager Bill Tooley was a little reluc
tant to let the Axe stray so far from
home, but felt "it's in good hands."
Block "S" awards were given to
all varsity lettermen, and JV cap
tain Lewis presented his coach, Mai
Elward, a special award—a golf bag
from the junior varsity.
Jack Shaw, Tidewater sportscaster,
gave the highlights of the Indians'
season, and Paul Speegle, San Fran
cisco newsman and former Stanford
yell leader, acted as master of cere
monies.
Sophomore halfback A 1 Harring
ton and his sister entertained with
a sword dance.
