# Birkie to Lead Boxers; Season Opens Next Month
## 
### JIM BAKER 
"As a team, we're only fair, but individually we have a few
standouts," stated boxing Coach Ray Lunny when quizzed about
this year's boxing team.
Leading the Card boxers will be heavyweight Bob Birkie, 6-2 Vi,
225-pound slugger. Birkie's father was a heavyweight contender.

Birkie went undefeated for twcH
years in intercollegiate competition
before bowing last year in the Pa
cific Coast Intercollegiate Boxing
Championships.
Lunny says that Birkie should
make an excellent showing this year,
but that his major handicap will be j
lack of a sparring partner.
"We just don't have anybody good i
enough to spar with Birkie, so he '
has to enter his matches cold," said :
Lunny.
Lunny also praised Bill Chertok,
a 165 pounder, as a "fine prospect."
Chertok, a transfer student, is from
Los Angeles.
team Filled out
This year the team will be filled
out a little more than last year, when
the Cards were forced to forfeit sev
eral bouts in every match due to
lack of men.
Each one of the bouts consists of
three two-minute rounds, and there
are eight weight classifications, 125-
lb„ 132-lb., 139-lb., 147-lb., 156-lb.,
165-lb., 178-lb. and heavyweight.
Stanford entries in each of these
divisions will be, 125 pound—Bill
Clark, 132 pound — no entry, 139
pound—Jerry Bibbens, 147—George
Batcabe, 156 pound—Ford Sims, 165-
pound—Dick Bolen, Doug Welpton,

John Norcross, Chertok, 178-pound
—Bill Sampson, Sherm Welpton, and
heavyweight—Birkie.
In the lighter divisions, Lunny said
Clark will "win a lot of his fights."
Stanford is a member of the Pa
cific Coast Intercollegiate Boxing
Association which includes Wash
ington State, Idaho State, San Jose
State, California, Cal Poly, Santa
Clara, Chico State and Nevada.
LACK OF FIGHTS
The Indians suffered l'ast year due
to a lack of fights, but this difficulty
has been removed this year. They
have six bouts scheduled, with Cal
on Friday, Jan. 12, santa Clara on
Friday, Jan. 20, Chico State on Fri
day, Feb. 3, Santa Clara again on
Saturday, Feb. 18, Cal Poly on Fri
day, Feb. 24, and Cal again on Thurs
day, March 1.
After the regular season, the team
will enter the Pacific Coast Cham
pionships, and the winners in each
division will enter the NCAA cham
pionships in April.
Idaho State is the perennial win
ner of the NCAA championships, and
Lunny rates them along with Wash
ington State and San Jose State as
the powers in the conference this
year.
