BOSTON, Nov. 30 (U.R) — Rugged
Carmen Basilio kept his welter
weight championship tonight by
coming from behind to score a TKO
over Tony DeMareo in the -12th
round of their return title fight.
Basilio, former onion farmer of
Chittenango, N. Y., scored his tech
nical knockout at 1:54 of the 12th
round.
That was only two seconds more
than the time required to score a
TKO over stocky DeMareo of Boston
when Basilio took the title at Syra
cuse, N. Y., last June 10.
DeMareo was on the floor twice
tonight, just as he was on the floor
twice in the Jvne bout.
Both trips to the canvas occurred
in the 12th round tonight. A right
to the chin dropped the tired and
staggering Tony for a count of eight.
DeMareo rose groggily. Basilio hit
him with a series of hooks. The
Mai banning of Boston, was
just stepping in to stop the fight as
Basilio dropped DeMareo again with
another right to the chin.
The referee raised his hands in a
gesture of "finish" over the prostrate
ex-champion.
It was an even more thrilling bat
tle tonight than their first go in
June. In the June fight,, young De-
Marco lost the 147-pound crown aft
er weal ing it for only 70 days.
Tonight the crowd of 13,373, which
paid a record indoor Boston gate of
$171,800, was on its feet screaming
encouragement in nearly every
round of the bruising battle.
In the first half of the fight, Basilio
weathered the most severe battering
of his career.
Basilio was almost knocked out in
the seventh round. In the eighth
round the champion was staggered
five times. Basilio was behind on
the scorecards of two of the judges
at. the end of the 11th round.
Basilio, whom the bookies had
given a 50-50 chance to retain his
crown, earned the largest purse of
his career—about $74,590.
