# Trucks Traded To Detroit For 'Bubba' Phillips

COLUMBUS, 0., Nov. 30 (U.R)â€”
The Detroit Tigers, believing that
there still is some fire left in the
right arm of Virgil Trucks, brought
him back today in a trade in which
they sent utility outfielder John
(Bubba) Phillips to the Chicago
White Sox.
Manager Bucky Harris of the Ti
gers declared that "I'm going to use
Trucks as a starter and he might be
the difference that would make us
real contenders."
"I feel that Virgil has at least one
good year left," he added.
Directly after their session with
the White Sox, the Tigers began
trade conferences with the Yankees
and indicated they might have an
additional announcement later in the
day.
"We managed to 'younger' our ball
club by acquiring Phillips and I'm
also convinced he can play third
base besides the outfield," said Mar
ion.
"Phillips is only 25 and Trucks is
36. That has to be a big considera
tion in any deal that you make."
Trucks last season won 13 games
and lost eight while Phillips, who
was used mainly at a utility man,
batted .234. Phillips, who hit .292
at Buffalo in 1952, returned to De
troit in 1955 after two years of mili
tary service.
