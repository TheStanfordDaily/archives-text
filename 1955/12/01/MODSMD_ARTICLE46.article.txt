# Daily Gridders Reject Shrine Bids
## 
### 
Four Stanford Daily seniors turned
down offers to play in the East-West
Sliline Ink BAwl classic because the
injured Harlan Stroud could not ac
company them for "inspirational
reasons."
The quartet of gridiron aces, who

paced The Daily to its grueling un
defeated season, will be replaced by
four journalists from the Slippery
Rock Abnormal School.
The West coach was reported
heading for the Golden Gate Bridge
after hearing the news.
