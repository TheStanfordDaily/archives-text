SOPHOMORE CENTERâ€”Big Clint Waring is battling it out
with Carlos Bea for the starting center position on Stanford's
varsity basketball team. The husky center was one of the
mainstays of the Papoose quintet last year. Waring, 6-5, is an
outstanding rebounder. He is one of three sophomores on the
varsity squad, the other two being forward lay Jackson and
guard Gary Van Galder. Waring hails from Stockton where he
was All-San Joaquin Valley as a high school eager. Although
Bea has been given the starting nod for tomorrow night's game.
Waring is expected to see plenty of action.
