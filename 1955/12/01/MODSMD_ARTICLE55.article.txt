### JOHN MOE 
Playing with both a hustling
offense and a spotless defense,
SAE I roared into the quarter
finals of mural play by blanking
the Fresh Medics 31-0 yester
day.
11 any one man stood out, it was
the SAE tailback, Ray Young. The
explosive ball handler ran for two
of his team's scores and unleashed a
talented passing arm to tally the
other three I >uehdown.s and a lone
extra point.
Ihe row club wasted no time in
getting on the scoreboard. Young
passed three times and ran once to
give SAE a first down on the Medic
18-yard line. After passing incom
plete twice, Young took the snap and
behind good b'ocking sprinted the
remaining distance for six points.
The attempt for the extra point
failed.

The Medics took over intending to
get right back in the game, but im
mediately lost the pigskin. Bob Mil
ton didn't get quite enough effort
into a pass intended for Dud Scott
and Young was right there to grab
it on his own 17-yard line.
A pass to Bernie Nelson got a first
down and then Young uncorked a
tremendous heave to Bob Dwiyht.
Dwight snagged it on the dead run
between two defenders and was
tagged on the 21-yard stripe one step
later.
Young ran for the first d'jwn and
on the next play hit Dwight in the
end zone. A toss to Nielsun added
the point to make it 13-0.

I:Â» the second stanza the Medics
moved to the SAE liH, a pass to Scott
comprising most of the distance. On
fourth down after making no yard
age on passes Bob Milton was nailed
10 yards behind scrimmage to give
SAE the ball on the Medic 36-yard
line.

The teams exchanged the ball anil
the SAE squad began another drive.
Alter moving to the 30-yard mark,
Young bolted around left end, cut
back beautifully at the 19 anil
threaded his way to the right corner
and six more points.
NELSON SCORES
After the score, the Medics relin
quished the ball on their own 39-
yard line. Passes to Dwight and
Ray Williamson moved the hall to
the 12. Young then faded back to
the 20 - yard stripe and threw to
Nielson in scoring territory.
The SAE team not their final score
on three successive passes to Dwight
after taking over on the 33-yard
line.
By virtue of their resounding vic
tory SAE will take on the Zetes to
day in what should prove to be a
real thriller.
