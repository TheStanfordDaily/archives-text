# 'Nightmare Abbey' Shines With Well-Paced Comedy
## Fry, Bazarini Spark Players' Production Of Sporadically Amusing Peacock Satire 
### TERRY COMITO 
If Thomas Love Peacock's satire on romantic gloom, "Nightmare
Abbey," makes for an only sporadically amusing play, it is, in
Wendell Cole's sharp and well-paced production for the Stanford
Players, the occasion of at least two spectacularly comic perform
ances.
Ray Fry, jerking about the stage like a bewildered but obsti-

nately rational marionette, and Ron
ald Bazarini, posturing, simpering
and pouting like a hugely over
grown boy of 10, are a constant
delight.
Their scenes have a crisp hard
ness of surface that carries them
along at a whirlwind rate. They are
filled' with a wealth of small move
ment and detail that gets every laugh
—and then some—suggested by the
lines.
Generally the lines, though often
clever enough, need whatever help
they can get. It's just that Peacock's
satire (mostly about the Gothic
novel) is too often dated, his epi
grams ("Marriage is a lottery") too

often dullish to play themselves.
"Nightmare Abbey" is, in fact, less
a play than a vehicle: a collection of
caricatures, each of which, given a
virtuoso performer, could be a tour
de force. But most of it depends on
the actor.
In many cases Fry and Bazarini
get fine support. Almeda Wilbor,
bouncing on stage like a Victorian
cherub, manages the almost impos
sible task of making the sweet-coy
young-thing likable and funny.
Astrid Willsrud, as the mysterious
dark-haired Stella, has a grace and
a dignity that verge happily be
tween the almost serious and the
downright farcical. Charles Lyons,
as the optimistic Mr. Hilary, and
Peter o\vens, as the old servant, add
their own neat comic touches.
Where the show drags, and it docs
in places—particularly in the first
act—the trouble seems to lie less
in the script than in several merely
ordinary performances.
Ordinary is not enough in a show
like "Nightmare." The people arc
not realistic, but they've got to be
people; declamation or grotesqueness
is not enough either.
The virtue of the current produc
tion is that so many of its prin
cipals succeed in creating a human
inside the stereotype and in making
both of them very funny indeed.

cipals succeed in creating a human
inside the stereotype and in making
both of them very funny indeed.
If Thomas Love Peacock's satire on romantic gloom, "Nightmare
Abbey," makes for an only sporadically amusing play, it is, in
Wendell Cole's sharp and well-paced production for the Stanford
Players, the occasion of at least two spectacularly comic perform
ances.
Ray Fry, jerking about the stage like a bewildered but obsti-

nately rational marionette, and Ron
ald Bazarini, posturing, simpering
and pouting like a hugely over
grown boy of 10, are a constant
delight.
Their scenes have a crisp hard
ness of surface that carries them
along at a whirlwind rate. They are
filled' with a wealth of small move
ment and detail that gets every laugh
—and then some—suggested by the
lines.
Generally the lines, though often
clever enough, need whatever help
they can get. It's just that Peacock's
satire (mostly about the Gothic
novel) is too often dated, his epi
grams ("Marriage is a lottery") too

often dullish to play themselves.
"Nightmare Abbey" is, in fact, less
a play than a vehicle: a collection of
caricatures, each of which, given a
virtuoso performer, could be a tour
de force. But most of it depends on
the actor.
In many cases Fry and Bazarini
get fine support. Almeda Wilbor,
bouncing on stage like a Victorian
cherub, manages the almost impos
sible task of making the sweet-coy
young-thing likable and funny.
Astrid Willsrud, as the mysterious
dark-haired Stella, has a grace and
a dignity that verge happily be
tween the almost serious and the
downright farcical. Charles Lyons,
as the optimistic Mr. Hilary, and
Peter o\vens, as the old servant, add
their own neat comic touches.
Where the show drags, and it docs
in places—particularly in the first
act—the trouble seems to lie less
in the script than in several merely
ordinary performances.
Ordinary is not enough in a show
like "Nightmare." The people arc
not realistic, but they've got to be
people; declamation or grotesqueness
is not enough either.
The virtue of the current produc
tion is that so many of its prin
cipals succeed in creating a human
inside the stereotype and in making
both of them very funny indeed.
