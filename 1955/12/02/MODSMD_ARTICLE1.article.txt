# A 						P Names Paul Wiggin First Team All-American
## Farm's Roster Of All-Americans Now Totals 16 
### 
Paul Wiggin became the 16th Ail-
American in Stanford history last
night. The Indian tackle was named
on the 1953 Associated Press All-
American squad.
Wiggin was the first Stanford
player honored with a first - team
berth since quarterback Bobby Gar
rett and end Sam Morley were cho
sen in 1953. The only other tackle
picked All-America from Stanford
was Eob Reynolds, the Vow Boy
who made it in 1934 and 1935.
This season was Wiggin's second
as a regular. His 6 - foot 3 - inch
height and 233-pound weight have
been described as the "near-per
fect" build for a tackle.
Wiggin has played outstandingly
all season, drawing special praise
for his play in the San Jose State,
UCLA and Ohio State games. The
Ohio State game, which was nation
ally televised, was an important fac
tor in giving Wiggin the national
reputation which put him on the
All-America team.
Coach Chuck Taylor, himself a
Stanford All - American guard in
1942, has described Wiggin as one
of the best tackles in the country,
concurring with the AP selection.
Assistant coach Dutch Fehring
called Wiggin "one of the finest kids
I've ever worked with, a tremen
dous football player.
"He is the type or player who is
never satisfied with his own per
formance and that will make him
even better next year, we hope."
Wiggin was exuberant over his
selection and described it as "un
doubtedly the greatest honor I've
ever received.
"1 was really surprised. I can't
put into words what I owe coaches
Taylor, Fehring and Joe Ruetz who
have helped me so much."
"There were others on the team
who could have easily got the selec
tion â€”like Chris Marshall," he said
modestly.
Wiggin is a senior majoring in
physical education but has one year
of eligibility left and said, "I'm very

much looking forward to placing
next year."
"I just feel great."
The All-America tackle transfer
red to Stanford from Modesto Junior
College in 1953, setting out that sea
son because of an injured shoulder.
Wiggin is a member of Phi Delta
Theta fraternity and lives in La
throp, Calif.
Only other Pacific Coast player to
make AP's first team is Jim Brown,
UCLA guard. Bob Davenport, Bruin
fullback, made the second team and
Jon Arnett, USC halfback was also
named to the number two squad.
John Witte, Or&gon State tackle,
made the third squad.
