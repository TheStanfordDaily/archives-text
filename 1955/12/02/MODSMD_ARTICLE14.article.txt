# Labor Strength Hit in Political Union Debate
## 
### JIM PALMER 
Unionism is becoming "a colossus
astride our economy and our way of
life," a Political Union audience was
warned last night during a debate
in Cubberley Auditorium on the
i question "Are labor unions becom
i ing too powerful?"
W. M. Caldwell, president o fthe
California Employers' Association,
and Stanford senior Mike Hudson
attacked labor groups as "involun
tary associations" which have used
I coercion and violence to achieve
their ends.
An impassioned rebuttal by for
mer labor lawyer I. B. Padway and
junior student John Falchi hit back
:at the critics of labor, pointing out
the achievements of the union
movement and its position relative
to business.
"It is not right that labor unions
can commit acts without restrictions
which would be illegal if committed
by others," charged Caldwell.
Padway countered, "Labor has
been told it could do certain things
within its rights, and labor has done
just that."
Falchi pointed out that the labor
, man "is not getting the entire bene
; lit of the highest standard of living
: in the world" and that the position
of business, not labor, was the pow
erful one,
An audience of 75 persons heard
Caldwell declare that restraint will
be necessary in the next two dec
ades to prevent unionism from "de
stroying the American system."
Hudson warned against a "slow
spread of labor power into govern
ment and society."
"I'm not so sure labor would want
to take over government," Padway
refuted. "Instead, labor's objectives
arc those of decent wages, decent
hours and decent working condi
tions."
