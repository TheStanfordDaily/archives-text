# Menâ€™s, Women's Council Rule On Liquor Violation
## 
### 
Men's and Women's Council, sit
ting together on a Fundamental
Stanford case last week, found a
man and a woman guilty of violat
ing the California liquor laws for
minors, the Councils announced.
Both minors were sentenced to 15
hours of work at the Con Home for
possessing and drinking alcoholic
beverages.
The two students were appre
hended at a fraternity party at Cha
teau Boussey in the Santa Cruz
Mountains last month by the State
Department of Alcoholic Beverage
Control.
The case was turned over to the
councils for action. This is the first
case referred to the University by
the ABC since the incident at Ros
sotti's last month.
Men's and Women's Councils nor
mally do not meet together on Fun
damental Standard cases, according
to Men's Council Secretary Jerry
Messner, but in this instance it wag
done because the violation and the
circumstances of the violation were
so similar.
