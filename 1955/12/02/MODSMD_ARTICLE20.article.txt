# Indians-Huskies Tip-off Basketball Season Tonight
## Varsity Tilts Begin at 8:30 In Pavilion Washington Quintet Is PCC Favorite 
### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford basketball fans will
have plenty to see this weekend
as all three Indian hoop squads
start the campaign with a pair of
games.
The main attractions, of course,
will be the varsity tilts against the
towering Washington Huskies who
have been named as pre-season fa
vorites for the Pacific Coast Confer
ence championship.
FROSH START
The frosh team under coach Dick
Clegg tangles with Bellarmine Prep
of San Jose tonight and meets strong
St. Ignatius High of San Francisco
tomorrow night. Both games, pre
liminaries to the varsity games, will
start at 5:45.
Coach George Lynn's Braves will
also see action in a pair of games.
The Braves face West Contra Costa
JC today at 3 p.m. in the Pavilion
and then take on the AJameda Coast
Guard tomorrow at the same time,
again in the Pavilion.
Varsity coach Howie Dallmar finds
himself considerably handicapped by
lack of height this year. Starting
center Carlos Bea and forward Barry
Brown both stand 6-4, but after

them the problem begins. Bill Bond,
the other forward, measures 6-1,
and starting guards Hap Wagner and
George Selleck check in at 5-11 and
5-8, respectively.
This gives the Cards a team aver
age of 6-1, probably the shortest of
any college team in the country.
But what the Cards lack in height,
they will try to make up in speed,
accurate shooting and tenacious de
fense.
SELLECK STARS
Leading the attack will be the
mighty mite, Selleck. Dallmar pre
dicts that his ace guard "will have a
great all-around year."
Selleck already has had two great
years. In his sophomore year, George
finished second behind center Russ
Lawler in the Southern Division
scoring race.
Junior Bill Bond will give the
Cards scoring punch from his for
ward post. Bond is only 6-1, short
for a forward, but he is strong and
uses his weight well under the
boards.
BROWN HAS SPRING
Brown at the other forward will
shoulder much of the backboard
burden. Dallmar says of Brown, "1
don't know what we would do with
out him. He is as good a jumper for
his size as there js in the league. His
shooting has improved a lot."
Clint Waring, 6-4 sophomore, will
share the, center spot equally with
Bea. Waring was a stalwart on the
frosh team last year but is, of course,
short on varsity experience.
•Wagner, a junior, gets the call at
the other guard because "he is ;t
hard worker, has improved tremen
dously and gets the most out of his
ability."
TWO-WAY MAN
Dallmar is high on the potential
shown by Gary Van Galder who just
reported in from the football squad.

Stanford students will be admit
ted free to the Stanford-Wash -
ington games tonight and tomor
row night upon presentation of
their student body cards.
The admission is $1 for non-
Stanford students.


WILL OPEN AGAINST HUSKIES—From left to right, Barry
Grown, Hap Wagner, George Selleck, Bill Bond and Carlos
Bea. Bond, Selleck and Brown are Coach Howie Dallmar's re
turning starters from last year and should provide the crowd
with some fine basketball. Bea, although inexperienced, is a
good rebounder and Wagner, as a reserve in 1955, had expe-

rience, ability and drive to win a starting berth. Stanford, one
of the shortest teams in major college basketball, will oppose
Washington with long shots from outside. However, this year's
new rule enlarging the keyhole area should reduce the effec
tiveness of giants like the Huskies' Gene Nelson and act to the
advantage of the little man.
