# Indians-Huskies Tip-off Basketball Season Tonight
## Varsity Tilts Begin at 8:30 In Pavilion Washington Quintet Is PCC Favorite 
### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford basketball fans will
have plenty to see this weekend
as all three Indian hoop squads
start the campaign with a pair of
games.
The main attractions, of course,
will be the varsity tilts against the
towering Washington Huskies who
have been named as pre-season fa
vorites for the Pacific Coast Confer
ence championship.
FROSH START
The frosh team under coach Dick
Clegg tangles with Bellarmine Prep
of San Jose tonight and meets strong
St. Ignatius High of San Francisco
tomorrow night. Both games, pre
liminaries to the varsity games, will
start at 5:45.
Coach George Lynn's Braves will
also see action in a pair of games.
The Braves face West Contra Costa
JC today at 3 p.m. in the Pavilion
and then take on the AJameda Coast
Guard tomorrow at the same time,
again in the Pavilion.
Varsity coach Howie Dallmar finds
himself considerably handicapped by
lack of height this year. Starting
center Carlos Bea and forward Barry
Brown both stand 6-4, but after

them the problem begins. Bill Bond,
the other forward, measures 6-1,
and starting guards Hap Wagner and
George Selleck check in at 5-11 and
5-8, respectively.
This gives the Cards a team aver
age of 6-1, probably the shortest of
any college team in the country.
But what the Cards lack in height,
they will try to make up in speed,
accurate shooting and tenacious de
fense.
SELLECK STARS
Leading the attack will be the
mighty mite, Selleck. Dallmar pre
dicts that his ace guard "will have a
great all-around year."
Selleck already has had two great
years. In his sophomore year, George
finished second behind center Russ
Lawler in the Southern Division
scoring race.
Junior Bill Bond will give the
Cards scoring punch from his for
ward post. Bond is only 6-1, short
for a forward, but he is strong and
uses his weight well under the
boards.
BROWN HAS SPRING
Brown at the other forward will
shoulder much of the backboard
burden. Dallmar says of Brown, "1
don't know what we would do with
out him. He is as good a jumper for
his size as there js in the league. His
shooting has improved a lot."
Clint Waring, 6-4 sophomore, will
share the, center spot equally with
Bea. Waring was a stalwart on the
frosh team last year but is, of course,
short on varsity experience.
•Wagner, a junior, gets the call at
the other guard because "he is ;t
hard worker, has improved tremen
dously and gets the most out of his
ability."
TWO-WAY MAN
Dallmar is high on the potential
shown by Gary Van Galder who just
reported in from the football squad.

Stanford students will be admit
ted free to the Stanford-Wash -
ington games tonight and tomor
row night upon presentation of
their student body cards.
The admission is $1 for non-
Stanford students.


WILL OPEN AGAINST HUSKIES—From left to right, Barry
Grown, Hap Wagner, George Selleck, Bill Bond and Carlos
Bea. Bond, Selleck and Brown are Coach Howie Dallmar's re
turning starters from last year and should provide the crowd
with some fine basketball. Bea, although inexperienced, is a
good rebounder and Wagner, as a reserve in 1955, had expe-

rience, ability and drive to win a starting berth. Stanford, one
of the shortest teams in major college basketball, will oppose
Washington with long shots from outside. However, this year's
new rule enlarging the keyhole area should reduce the effec
tiveness of giants like the Huskies' Gene Nelson and act to the
advantage of the little man.
Van Galder has made the adjust
! ment to basketball well and fast.
He will play in the JV game today
but will also suit up for the varsity
encounter.
Senior Bill Flanders will get the
1 as first reserve. He is a hefty 6-1
forward. When he comes in, Bond
vial move back to a guard position.
Other players counted on by Dall
mar for reserve duty are Ron Wag
ner, Dave Dunn, Beppo Dyer, John
Henderson, Carl Isaacs and Nick
J Vojvodich.
BIGGEST EVER
Dal 1 mar's immediate problem is
what to do with the Huskies. Coach
j Tippy Dye will floor the biggest
j team, at an average height of 6-6,
probably ever seen on the Pacific
I Coast —bigger even than the giant

squad of Oregon State last year.
Starting at center for Washington
will be 7-0 Gary Nelson. Nelson, a
junior, played behind Dean Parsons
last year but is ready to come into
his own this year.
The big boy is not a smooth bas
ketball player, but he is a pretty
good shot so won't be much handi
capped by the wide lane rule. He
should be a terror on the backboards
as he will have an eight-inch ad
vantage on Boa.
SOPHOMORE STAR
The Huskies' biggest threat is 6-8
forward Bruno Boin. Boin was a |
high school Ail-American at Frank- !
lin High in Seattle, and he did noth- |
ing on the Washington frosh squad
last year to dim his reputation.
He broke all of Bob Houbreg's j
scoring records and probably will j
continue to do the same throughout
his career at Washington.
He is a hooker in the Houbreg |
tradition—which 'means ho iS"dan
gerous,with that shot put to 25'fetft !
frorhi tly? basket. He also is a fine de
fensive player and an aggressive re-'.j
.buunder. ... «
( Tke ©thai- forward is;
6-6 Jim Coshow. Cc#how is used*
jprirrtfcrily as a rebounder, but he
does, hnVeia good set shot from along
the so merits close attentions
irom the defence.
Playing'one of tlie guards will b<3
Karl Voegtlin, a second-string all-
Northern Division forward last year.
He. like Co. c how, is primarily dan
gerous with long set shots.
•LITTLE" MAN
The "midget" of the team is thp
other guard, Doyle Perkins, who
stands at an even six feet. Perkins
is the driver and the playmaker on
j the Washington five.
The Huskies have no weakness on
| the bench as they are loaded with
lettermen reserves.
Following the Washington series,
Stanford plays only lour more non
conference games before heading up
to Seattle to open the PCC reason
against the Huskies on Jan. 6-7.
SC. DARTMOUTH COMING
The Indians take part in a pair of
doubleheaders on Dec. 21-22 in the
Cow Palace in San Francisco. On
Friday night, Stanford meets Dart
mouth with Southern Cal taking on
Santa Clara in the second game. On
Saturday night, Stanford and USC
switch opponents.
On Dec. 29, the Cards meet lowa
at Stanford. Last year the Hawk
eyes, who are the current favorites
to win the Big Ten crown, whipped
Stanford at lowa City at the tail end
of a grueling road trip for the Cards.
The following night, the Tribe five
meets another Big Ten opponent,
Wisconsin, to wind up the pre-sea
son schedule.

age of 6-1, probably the shortest of
any college team in the country.
But what the Cards lack in height,
they will try to make up in speed,
accurate shooting and tenacious de
fense.
SELLECK STARS
Leading the attack will be the
mighty mite, Selleck. Dallmar pre
dicts that his ace guard "will have a
great all-around year."
Selleck already has had two great
years. In his sophomore year, George
finished second behind center Russ
Lawler in the Southern Division
scoring race.
Junior Bill Bond will give the
Cards scoring punch from his for
ward post. Bond is only 6-1, short
for a forward, but he is strong and
uses his weight well under the
boards.
BROWN HAS SPRING
Brown at the other forward will
shoulder much of the backboard
burden. Dallmar says of Brown, "1
don't know what we would do with
out him. He is as good a jumper for
his size as there js in the league. His
shooting has improved a lot."
Clint Waring, 6-4 sophomore, will
share the, center spot equally with
Bea. Waring was a stalwart on the
frosh team last year but is, of course,
short on varsity experience.
•Wagner, a junior, gets the call at
the other guard because "he is ;t
hard worker, has improved tremen
dously and gets the most out of his
ability."
TWO-WAY MAN
Dallmar is high on the potential
shown by Gary Van Galder who just
reported in from the football squad.

Stanford students will be admit
ted free to the Stanford-Wash -
ington games tonight and tomor
row night upon presentation of
their student body cards.
The admission is $1 for non-
Stanford students.


WILL OPEN AGAINST HUSKIES—From left to right, Barry
Grown, Hap Wagner, George Selleck, Bill Bond and Carlos
Bea. Bond, Selleck and Brown are Coach Howie Dallmar's re
turning starters from last year and should provide the crowd
with some fine basketball. Bea, although inexperienced, is a
good rebounder and Wagner, as a reserve in 1955, had expe-

rience, ability and drive to win a starting berth. Stanford, one
of the shortest teams in major college basketball, will oppose
Washington with long shots from outside. However, this year's
new rule enlarging the keyhole area should reduce the effec
tiveness of giants like the Huskies' Gene Nelson and act to the
advantage of the little man.
Van Galder has made the adjust
! ment to basketball well and fast.
He will play in the JV game today
but will also suit up for the varsity
encounter.
Senior Bill Flanders will get the
1 as first reserve. He is a hefty 6-1
forward. When he comes in, Bond
vial move back to a guard position.
Other players counted on by Dall
mar for reserve duty are Ron Wag
ner, Dave Dunn, Beppo Dyer, John
Henderson, Carl Isaacs and Nick
J Vojvodich.
BIGGEST EVER
Dal 1 mar's immediate problem is
what to do with the Huskies. Coach
j Tippy Dye will floor the biggest
j team, at an average height of 6-6,
probably ever seen on the Pacific
I Coast —bigger even than the giant

squad of Oregon State last year.
Starting at center for Washington
will be 7-0 Gary Nelson. Nelson, a
junior, played behind Dean Parsons
last year but is ready to come into
his own this year.
The big boy is not a smooth bas
ketball player, but he is a pretty
good shot so won't be much handi
capped by the wide lane rule. He
should be a terror on the backboards
as he will have an eight-inch ad
vantage on Boa.
SOPHOMORE STAR
The Huskies' biggest threat is 6-8
forward Bruno Boin. Boin was a |
high school Ail-American at Frank- !
lin High in Seattle, and he did noth- |
ing on the Washington frosh squad
last year to dim his reputation.
He broke all of Bob Houbreg's j
scoring records and probably will j
continue to do the same throughout
his career at Washington.
He is a hooker in the Houbreg |
tradition—which 'means ho iS"dan

fensive player and an aggressive re-'.j

•LITTLE" MAN
The "midget" of the team is thp

stands at an even six feet. Perkins
is the driver and the playmaker on
j the Washington five.
The Huskies have no weakness on

lettermen reserves.
Following the Washington series,
Stanford plays only lour more non
conference games before heading up
to Seattle to open the PCC reason
against the Huskies on Jan. 6-7.

STAMFORD COACH — Howie Dallmar's Indian basketballers
meet Washington in their opening games tonight. This is
Dallrnar's second year at Stanford; before he came here he was
coach at the University of Pennsylvania.
Stanford basketball fans will
have plenty to see this weekend
as all three Indian hoop squads
start the campaign with a pair of
games.
The main attractions, of course,
will be the varsity tilts against the
towering Washington Huskies who
have been named as pre-season fa
vorites for the Pacific Coast Confer
ence championship.
FROSH START
The frosh team under coach Dick
Clegg tangles with Bellarmine Prep
of San Jose tonight and meets strong
St. Ignatius High of San Francisco
tomorrow night. Both games, pre
liminaries to the varsity games, will
start at 5:45.
Coach George Lynn's Braves will
also see action in a pair of games.
The Braves face West Contra Costa
JC today at 3 p.m. in the Pavilion
and then take on the AJameda Coast
Guard tomorrow at the same time,
again in the Pavilion.
Varsity coach Howie Dallmar finds
himself considerably handicapped by
lack of height this year. Starting
center Carlos Bea and forward Barry
Brown both stand 6-4, but after

them the problem begins. Bill Bond,
the other forward, measures 6-1,
and starting guards Hap Wagner and

dously and gets the most out of his
ability."
TWO-WAY MAN
Dallmar is high on the potential
shown by Gary Van Galder who just
reported in from the football squad.

Stanford students will be admit
ted free to the Stanford-Wash -
ington games tonight and tomor
row night upon presentation of
their student body cards.
The admission is $1 for non-
Stanford students.


WILL OPEN AGAINST HUSKIES—From left to right, Barry
Grown, Hap Wagner, George Selleck, Bill Bond and Carlos
Bea. Bond, Selleck and Brown are Coach Howie Dallmar's re
turning starters from last year and should provide the crowd
with some fine basketball. Bea, although inexperienced, is a
good rebounder and Wagner, as a reserve in 1955, had expe-

rience, ability and drive to win a starting berth. Stanford, one
of the shortest teams in major college basketball, will oppose
Washington with long shots from outside. However, this year's
new rule enlarging the keyhole area should reduce the effec
tiveness of giants like the Huskies' Gene Nelson and act to the
advantage of the little man.
Van Galder has made the adjust
! ment to basketball well and fast.
He will play in the JV game today
but will also suit up for the varsity
encounter.
Senior Bill Flanders will get the
1 as first reserve. He is a hefty 6-1
forward. When he comes in, Bond
vial move back to a guard position.
Other players counted on by Dall
mar for reserve duty are Ron Wag
ner, Dave Dunn, Beppo Dyer, John
Henderson, Carl Isaacs and Nick
J Vojvodich.
BIGGEST EVER
Dal 1 mar's immediate problem is
what to do with the Huskies. Coach
j Tippy Dye will floor the biggest
j team, at an average height of 6-6,
probably ever seen on the Pacific
I Coast —bigger even than the giant

squad of Oregon State last year.
Starting at center for Washington
will be 7-0 Gary Nelson. Nelson, a
junior, played behind Dean Parsons
last year but is ready to come into
his own this year.
The big boy is not a smooth bas
ketball player, but he is a pretty
good shot so won't be much handi
capped by the wide lane rule. He
should be a terror on the backboards
as he will have an eight-inch ad
vantage on Boa.
SOPHOMORE STAR
The Huskies' biggest threat is 6-8
forward Bruno Boin. Boin was a |
high school Ail-American at Frank- !
lin High in Seattle, and he did noth- |
ing on the Washington frosh squad
last year to dim his reputation.
He broke all of Bob Houbreg's j
scoring records and probably will j
continue to do the same throughout
his career at Washington.
He is a hooker in the Houbreg |
tradition—which 'means ho iS"dan
gerous,with that shot put to 25'fetft !
frorhi tly? basket. He also is a fine de
fensive player and an aggressive re-'.j

Karl Voegtlin, a second-string all-
Northern Division forward last year.
He. like Co. c how, is primarily dan
gerous with long set shots.
•LITTLE" MAN
The "midget" of the team is thp
other guard, Doyle Perkins, who
stands at an even six feet. Perkins
is the driver and the playmaker on
j the Washington five.
The Huskies have no weakness on
| the bench as they are loaded with
lettermen reserves.
Following the Washington series,
Stanford plays only lour more non
conference games before heading up
to Seattle to open the PCC reason
against the Huskies on Jan. 6-7.
SC. DARTMOUTH COMING
The Indians take part in a pair of
doubleheaders on Dec. 21-22 in the
Cow Palace in San Francisco. On
Friday night, Stanford meets Dart
mouth with Southern Cal taking on
Santa Clara in the second game. On
Saturday night, Stanford and USC
switch opponents.
On Dec. 29, the Cards meet lowa
at Stanford. Last year the Hawk
eyes, who are the current favorites
to win the Big Ten crown, whipped
Stanford at lowa City at the tail end

STAMFORD COACH — Howie Dallmar's Indian basketballers
meet Washington in their opening games tonight. This is
Dallrnar's second year at Stanford; before he came here he was
coach at the University of Pennsylvania.
Stanford basketball fans will
have plenty to see this weekend
as all three Indian hoop squads
start the campaign with a pair of
games.
The main attractions, of course,
will be the varsity tilts against the
towering Washington Huskies who
have been named as pre-season fa
vorites for the Pacific Coast Confer
ence championship.
FROSH START
The frosh team under coach Dick
Clegg tangles with Bellarmine Prep
of San Jose tonight and meets strong
St. Ignatius High of San Francisco
tomorrow night. Both games, pre
liminaries to the varsity games, will
start at 5:45.
Coach George Lynn's Braves will
also see action in a pair of games.
The Braves face West Contra Costa
JC today at 3 p.m. in the Pavilion
and then take on the AJameda Coast
Guard tomorrow at the same time,
again in the Pavilion.
Varsity coach Howie Dallmar finds
himself considerably handicapped by
lack of height this year. Starting
center Carlos Bea and forward Barry
Brown both stand 6-4, but after

them the problem begins. Bill Bond,
the other forward, measures 6-1,
and starting guards Hap Wagner and
George Selleck check in at 5-11 and
5-8, respectively.
This gives the Cards a team aver
age of 6-1, probably the shortest of
any college team in the country.
But what the Cards lack in height,
they will try to make up in speed,
accurate shooting and tenacious de
fense.
SELLECK STARS
Leading the attack will be the
mighty mite, Selleck. Dallmar pre
dicts that his ace guard "will have a
great all-around year."
Selleck already has had two great
years. In his sophomore year, George
finished second behind center Russ
Lawler in the Southern Division
scoring race.
Junior Bill Bond will give the
Cards scoring punch from his for
ward post. Bond is only 6-1, short
for a forward, but he is strong and
uses his weight well under the
boards.
BROWN HAS SPRING
Brown at the other forward will
shoulder much of the backboard
burden. Dallmar says of Brown, "1
don't know what we would do with
out him. He is as good a jumper for
his size as there js in the league. His
shooting has improved a lot."
Clint Waring, 6-4 sophomore, will
share the, center spot equally with
Bea. Waring was a stalwart on the
frosh team last year but is, of course,
short on varsity experience.
•Wagner, a junior, gets the call at
the other guard because "he is ;t
hard worker, has improved tremen
dously and gets the most out of his
ability."

forward. When he comes in, Bond
vial move back to a guard position.
Other players counted on by Dall
mar for reserve duty are Ron Wag
ner, Dave Dunn, Beppo Dyer, John
Henderson, Carl Isaacs and Nick
J Vojvodich.
BIGGEST EVER
Dal 1 mar's immediate problem is
what to do with the Huskies. Coach
j Tippy Dye will floor the biggest
j team, at an average height of 6-6,
probably ever seen on the Pacific
I Coast —bigger even than the giant

squad of Oregon State last year.
Starting at center for Washington
will be 7-0 Gary Nelson. Nelson, a
junior, played behind Dean Parsons
last year but is ready to come into
his own this year.
The big boy is not a smooth bas
ketball player, but he is a pretty
good shot so won't be much handi
capped by the wide lane rule. He
should be a terror on the backboards
as he will have an eight-inch ad
vantage on Boa.
SOPHOMORE STAR
The Huskies' biggest threat is 6-8
forward Bruno Boin. Boin was a |
high school Ail-American at Frank- !
lin High in Seattle, and he did noth- |
ing on the Washington frosh squad
last year to dim his reputation.
He broke all of Bob Houbreg's j
scoring records and probably will j
continue to do the same throughout
his career at Washington.
He is a hooker in the Houbreg |
tradition—which 'means ho iS"dan
gerous,with that shot put to 25'fetft !
frorhi tly? basket. He also is a fine de
fensive player and an aggressive re-'.j
.buunder. ... «
( Tke ©thai- forward is;
6-6 Jim Coshow. Cc#how is used*
jprirrtfcrily as a rebounder, but he

irom the defence.
Playing'one of tlie guards will b<3
Karl Voegtlin, a second-string all-
Northern Division forward last year.
He. like Co. c how, is primarily dan
gerous with long set shots.
•LITTLE" MAN
The "midget" of the team is thp
other guard, Doyle Perkins, who
stands at an even six feet. Perkins
is the driver and the playmaker on
j the Washington five.
The Huskies have no weakness on
| the bench as they are loaded with
lettermen reserves.
Following the Washington series,
Stanford plays only lour more non
conference games before heading up
to Seattle to open the PCC reason
against the Huskies on Jan. 6-7.
SC. DARTMOUTH COMING
The Indians take part in a pair of
doubleheaders on Dec. 21-22 in the
Cow Palace in San Francisco. On
Friday night, Stanford meets Dart
mouth with Southern Cal taking on
Santa Clara in the second game. On
Saturday night, Stanford and USC
switch opponents.
On Dec. 29, the Cards meet lowa
at Stanford. Last year the Hawk
eyes, who are the current favorites
to win the Big Ten crown, whipped
Stanford at lowa City at the tail end
of a grueling road trip for the Cards.
The following night, the Tribe five

Wisconsin, to wind up the pre-sea

STAMFORD COACH — Howie Dallmar's Indian basketballers
meet Washington in their opening games tonight. This is
Dallrnar's second year at Stanford; before he came here he was
coach at the University of Pennsylvania.
Stanford basketball fans will
have plenty to see this weekend
as all three Indian hoop squads
start the campaign with a pair of
games.
The main attractions, of course,
will be the varsity tilts against the
towering Washington Huskies who
have been named as pre-season fa
vorites for the Pacific Coast Confer
ence championship.
FROSH START
The frosh team under coach Dick
Clegg tangles with Bellarmine Prep
of San Jose tonight and meets strong
St. Ignatius High of San Francisco
tomorrow night. Both games, pre
liminaries to the varsity games, will
start at 5:45.
Coach George Lynn's Braves will
also see action in a pair of games.
The Braves face West Contra Costa
JC today at 3 p.m. in the Pavilion
and then take on the AJameda Coast
Guard tomorrow at the same time,
again in the Pavilion.
Varsity coach Howie Dallmar finds
himself considerably handicapped by
lack of height this year. Starting
center Carlos Bea and forward Barry
Brown both stand 6-4, but after

them the problem begins. Bill Bond,
the other forward, measures 6-1,
and starting guards Hap Wagner and
George Selleck check in at 5-11 and
5-8, respectively.
This gives the Cards a team aver
age of 6-1, probably the shortest of
any college team in the country.
But what the Cards lack in height,
they will try to make up in speed,
accurate shooting and tenacious de
fense.
SELLECK STARS
Leading the attack will be the
mighty mite, Selleck. Dallmar pre
dicts that his ace guard "will have a
great all-around year."
Selleck already has had two great
years. In his sophomore year, George
finished second behind center Russ
Lawler in the Southern Division
scoring race.
Junior Bill Bond will give the
Cards scoring punch from his for
ward post. Bond is only 6-1, short
for a forward, but he is strong and
uses his weight well under the
boards.
BROWN HAS SPRING
Brown at the other forward will
shoulder much of the backboard
burden. Dallmar says of Brown, "1
don't know what we would do with
out him. He is as good a jumper for
his size as there js in the league. His
shooting has improved a lot."
Clint Waring, 6-4 sophomore, will
share the, center spot equally with
Bea. Waring was a stalwart on the
frosh team last year but is, of course,
short on varsity experience.
•Wagner, a junior, gets the call at
the other guard because "he is ;t
hard worker, has improved tremen
dously and gets the most out of his
ability."
TWO-WAY MAN
Dallmar is high on the potential
shown by Gary Van Galder who just
reported in from the football squad.

Stanford students will be admit
ted free to the Stanford-Wash -
ington games tonight and tomor
row night upon presentation of
their student body cards.
The admission is $1 for non-
Stanford students.


WILL OPEN AGAINST HUSKIES—From left to right, Barry
Grown, Hap Wagner, George Selleck, Bill Bond and Carlos
Bea. Bond, Selleck and Brown are Coach Howie Dallmar's re
turning starters from last year and should provide the crowd
with some fine basketball. Bea, although inexperienced, is a
good rebounder and Wagner, as a reserve in 1955, had expe-

rience, ability and drive to win a starting berth. Stanford, one
of the shortest teams in major college basketball, will oppose
Washington with long shots from outside. However, this year's
new rule enlarging the keyhole area should reduce the effec
tiveness of giants like the Huskies' Gene Nelson and act to the
advantage of the little man.
Van Galder has made the adjust
! ment to basketball well and fast.
He will play in the JV game today
but will also suit up for the varsity
encounter.
Senior Bill Flanders will get the
