# licking the problem
## 
### 
Several times this quarter the Traffic Com
mittee has climbed out on the familiar limb
and then wielded its own saw. For the most
part, however, Bob Maddock and his group
have been ambitious, hard-working, inquisi
tive, creative, persistent. Which is more than
can be said for the general run of ASSU organi
zations.
This week the Traffic Committee submitted
a report on its quarter's work and outlined a
number of proposals. The report recommends
the cpening of Los Arboles Road, use of park
ing. meters in certain areas, creation of new
special reserve zones, mandatory registration
of cars and improvement of certain campus
parking facilities.
We'll quibble with some of the specifics.
But we'll endorse the document as a whole,

realizing that no one person or group will
ever like any traffic plan in its entirety.
The Legislature received the report Wednes
day night and proposed to study it. The report
should be discussed. And the Legislative
should use it as a basis for recommendations to
the University.
Student opinions on the traffic and parking
problem have been sought by the University.
The Traffic Committee's report is the first such
student action. But it shouldn't end there.
There should be an official response from the
students' representative body — the Legisla
ture.
Now that interest has been generated, both
the Legislature and the University should go
all the way to lick the traffic problem.
