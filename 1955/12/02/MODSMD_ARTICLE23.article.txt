The most smeared man in America received
another splat of mud this week.
Richard M. Nixon has been the target of a
slanderous and vicious campaign by certain
political factions ever since he became a candi
date on the Eisenhower ticket in 1952.
Now the Vice-President of the United States
has allegedly been the subject of ihe latest
outburst cf name-calling by a former President.
Not that it really matters to Mr. Nixon, for
ho has weathered the coarseness and rudeness
of the political arena for a long time. He has
been the subject of unflattering cartoons, cari
catures, jokes and hecklers.
The attack has been grossly unjust; in the
final analysis it has been an outlet for the un
successful who must criticize something and
find President Eisenhower too popular to be
a target.
Above the smog of political oratory rise the
undeniably outstanding achievements of the
man that President Eisenhower calls "the most
valuable member cf my team."
He has brought sweeping changes in the
concept of the role cf the Vice-President. Dur
ing Ike's recent illness he handled an increased
burden of duties very well indeed.
In fact, Nixon's record as Vice-President has
shown to be so strong and impressive that

his critics have found no grounds on
to base attacks against it.
He emerges as an experienced administrator
and a vital man in the nation's governmental
system. And yet they throw mud.
They resent the young politician who
pressed the case against Alger Kiss and later
pointed out that Adlai Stevenson was a char
acter witness by deposition for Hiss.
They resent Nixon's charge that Democratic
administrations had failed to adequately meet
the advance of Communism. They try to read
into his words an accusation that Democrats
are a party of treason (a la McCarthy), which
never was meant by Nixon.
This resentment, in addition to the yearning
to get back on the "inside," has been the basis
of the anti-Nixon propaganda flow which was
reportedly given an extra push along the gut
ter by Harry Truman this week.
Unfortunately Republicans have not acted
to successfully stem the tide. They have failed
to meet and counteract the propaganda flow.
It is curious to note the failure of the GOP
to protect the vulnerable position of the Vice-
President. As election year approaches, the
situation will become more intense and the
gutters will undoubtedly overflow.
And Nixon may be drowned politically.
