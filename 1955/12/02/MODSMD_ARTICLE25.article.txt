# From klamath Falls to Athens. Greece: Warren G. Wonka Really Gets Around
## Mythical Character Born Full Grown From Chappie Joke 
### JIM PALMER 
Herein lies the tale of a great
Stanford legend.
This is :he itory of Warren G.
Wonka, who has been many
places and done many things.
His itinerary has ranged from
Klamath Falls to Greece. He has
taken Western Civ at Stanford anil
ha-i been a guest at a royal recep
tion for a king and queen at Athens.
This is all very unusual, you see.
For there ain't no such person as
Warren G. Wonka.
He emerged full grown from the
imagination of a Chaparral jokester
in IIJ4Bl l J48 as a bra salesman in a story
now world famous.
Since then, the name of Warren G.
Wonka has gone from coast to coast
and around the world.
DRAFT REGISTRATION
Item 1: In 1948. Wonka was regis
tered in the draft registration here.
Item 2: An unnamed Chappie
staffer once filled out a blue card,
took midterms and the final in a
Western Civ course using the name
of Warren G. Wonka. (The Univer
sity caught on when they couldn't
find a transcript to record the B mi
nus grade.)
Item 3: On Friday; Oct. 2(5, 1951,
Wonka "narrowly escaped serious
injury in an auto accident near
Klamath Falls, Ore.," according to
the Associated Press and the Wat
son ville Register-Pajaronian.
(Members of the Stanford band on
their way to Seattle for a football
game had an accident, and police
took their names. One of them didn't
want to worry his parents, so he
used Warren's convenient monicker.
(The AP picked up the item as did
the paper in Warren's reported
'"home town," Watsonville. It went
page one there.)
Item 4: The Athens (Greece)
News reported a couple of years ago
a guest list of the Greek Royal Pal
ace. The list included ambassadors
and military brass. The last name
on the list was none other than Mr.
Warren G. Wonka.
Wonka has been registered in in
numerable classes, been a write-in
candidate in ASSU elections, ap
peared in several subsequent Chap
pies, and almost made the gradua
tion program in 1950.
'IMMORTAL 22'
The latest appearance of Wonka
was in an obscure item on the rear
page of the first section of The
Daily's 1955 Big Game edition. The
article purported that Wonka was
really the 22nd member of the Im
mortal 21.
Where Wonka will show up next,
no one can really tell.
But you can be sure that he will
be there, hidden in lists of names in
some obscure newspaper article' on
the inside pages.
He will be there.


WONKA WAS THERE—It's 1952. It's a parity raid at Roble—
and sneaking in to do his part is the ever-present Warren G.
Wonka (rear view). For many years now Mr. Wonka has found
himself embroiled in the great and near-great events in Stan
ford's pacing parade. This SLanfcrd hero has also popped up
in mcst unlikely places the world over.
