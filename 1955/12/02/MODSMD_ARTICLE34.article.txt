# LASSU Approves Winter Quarter Benefit Flick
## Receipts for 50-Cent Admission Flick Will Go to World University Service 
### DICK MEISTER Associate Editor, The Daily 
At its last meeting of the quarter Wednesday night ASSU Leg
islature approved a winter quarter benefit Flick.
Bill Crookston, Winter Charity Drive chairman, outlined his
plan to the group. It calls for showing a movie at the Sunday Night
Flicks the fourth Sunday in winter quarter.
Admission price will be 50 cents, with half the receipts going

to the drive to benefit World Uni
versity Service (WUS). Crookston
said this is part of a plan in which
Drives Committee hoped to raise
Stanford's charity donations from
ihe usual 75 cents a student average.
He compared the figure with the
University of California's $1.75 av
erage and Harvard's and Yale's $7.
He said that if this movie goes over
i certain limit his committee has
aet, all of Stanford's charity drives
may be combined into one, in win
ter quarter.
WEIGHT IN COINS
Other plans for Winter Drive in
clude donating Dean H. Donald
Winbigler's weight in coins (he will
be weighed on Quad by senior class
members) and a KZSU "radiothon."
Although Legislature okayed the
benefit Flick they pointed out the
danger of making the Flick a benefit
activity. Recently the graduate class
was turned, down in its request for
a benefit show,
Legislature wondered just where
to draw the line.
President George Ralph asked
permission to appoint two represen
tatives from the Graduate Depart
ment of Humanities anil Sciences.
No .yne had ever filled, the office
despite constixutiortal pVovifeions. so
Legislature members thought an ap
pointment illegal. Ralph didn't.
He said a vacancy existed and that
constitutionally he could appoint two
to fill that vacancy. Still Legislature

members insisted that since no one
had ever filled the post a vacancy
didn't exist and any representatives
would have to be elected.
An election can't be held for some
time and both Ralph and the mem
bers want representation from the
school. The problem was to find a
quick, legal method to secure that
representation.
Debate flew around the room until
someone came up with the motion:
"Appointment of two representatives
for the rest of the academic year or
until an flection is held."
Said Ralph: "This sounds legal as
hell."
But it didn't prove to be and the
Graduate School of Humanities and
Sciences still has no representatives
to Legislature.
NO DISCRIMINATION
The regular NSA discussion con
cerned admission policies. Jim Sam
met, NSA co-ordinator, told of
checking Stanford's policies, saying
he found no discrimination.
Another NSA matter brought up
was that of fraternity discrimination.
Sammet noted that Dartmouth Col
lege had made a ruling that any
fraternity practicing discrimination
after 1860 will be put off campus.
He noted that "about 20" other
U.S. colleges have put such rules
into operation.
Members agreed to put a referen
dum on next winter quarter's ballot.
Possible subjects will be clarification
of the fraternity judicial council's
status, possible direct election of the
head cheer leader and permanent
NSA membership.
Ralph read a Christmas card ex
tending greetings to the Legislature
and the student body from the Stan
ford University Affiliation Commit
tee of the Free University of Berlin.
Discussion on a graduate judicial
council was brought up. Members
want to make the graduates aware
of the application of the Honor Code
and the Fundamental Standard and
think establishment of the council
will help in that awareness.
Members also heard the ASSU
Traffic Committee's autumn quarter
report. (See Page 4 for the complete
report.)

Possible subjects will be clarification
of the fraternity judicial council's
status, possible direct election of the
head cheer leader and permanent
NSA membership.
Ralph read a Christmas card ex
tending greetings to the Legislature
and the student body from the Stan
ford University Affiliation Commit
tee of the Free University of Berlin.
Discussion on a graduate judicial
council was brought up. Members
want to make the graduates aware
of the application of the Honor Code
and the Fundamental Standard and
think establishment of the council
will help in that awareness.
Members also heard the ASSU
Traffic Committee's autumn quarter
report. (See Page 4 for the complete
report.)
At its last meeting of the quarter Wednesday night ASSU Leg
islature approved a winter quarter benefit Flick.
Bill Crookston, Winter Charity Drive chairman, outlined his
plan to the group. It calls for showing a movie at the Sunday Night
Flicks the fourth Sunday in winter quarter.
Admission price will be 50 cents, with half the receipts going

to the drive to benefit World Uni
versity Service (WUS). Crookston
said this is part of a plan in which
Drives Committee hoped to raise
Stanford's charity donations from
ihe usual 75 cents a student average.
He compared the figure with the
University of California's $1.75 av
erage and Harvard's and Yale's $7.
He said that if this movie goes over
i certain limit his committee has
aet, all of Stanford's charity drives
may be combined into one, in win
ter quarter.
WEIGHT IN COINS
Other plans for Winter Drive in
clude donating Dean H. Donald
Winbigler's weight in coins (he will
be weighed on Quad by senior class
members) and a KZSU "radiothon."
Although Legislature okayed the
benefit Flick they pointed out the
danger of making the Flick a benefit
activity. Recently the graduate class
was turned, down in its request for
a benefit show,
Legislature wondered just where
to draw the line.
President George Ralph asked
permission to appoint two represen
tatives from the Graduate Depart
ment of Humanities anil Sciences.
No .yne had ever filled, the office
despite constixutiortal pVovifeions. so
Legislature members thought an ap
pointment illegal. Ralph didn't.
He said a vacancy existed and that
constitutionally he could appoint two
to fill that vacancy. Still Legislature

members insisted that since no one
had ever filled the post a vacancy
didn't exist and any representatives
would have to be elected.
An election can't be held for some
time and both Ralph and the mem
bers want representation from the
school. The problem was to find a
quick, legal method to secure that
representation.
Debate flew around the room until
someone came up with the motion:
"Appointment of two representatives
for the rest of the academic year or
until an flection is held."
Said Ralph: "This sounds legal as
hell."
But it didn't prove to be and the
Graduate School of Humanities and
Sciences still has no representatives
to Legislature.
NO DISCRIMINATION
The regular NSA discussion con
cerned admission policies. Jim Sam
met, NSA co-ordinator, told of
checking Stanford's policies, saying
he found no discrimination.
Another NSA matter brought up
was that of fraternity discrimination.
Sammet noted that Dartmouth Col
lege had made a ruling that any
fraternity practicing discrimination
after 1860 will be put off campus.
He noted that "about 20" other
U.S. colleges have put such rules
into operation.
Members agreed to put a referen
dum on next winter quarter's ballot.
