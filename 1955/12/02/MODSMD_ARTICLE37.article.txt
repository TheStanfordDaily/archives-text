# Contract for Axe Case Made in ’47; Confusion, Plans Lost-Still No Case
## 
### 
In May of 1947 the ASSU Executive Committee passed a resolu
tion for $675 in payment for a new case for the Stanford Axe.
In December of 1955 the ASSU Legislature is still looking for
that case. Stanford has the Axe, but nothing (other th; j n a bank
vault) in which to put it.
Back in '47 representatives cf the Weber Showcase and Fix-

ture Co., Inc., of Los Angeles eamo<
to Stanford, measured the Axe's di
mensions, drew up a blueprint and
set to work constructing a special
theft-proof trophy case.
The case was to weigh 950 pounds
and have a covering of double plate
unbreakable glass.
All the extensive preliminary
work went for naught. After the
case had been delivered to the Farm
the firm received a letter from the
ASSU financial manager saying,
"The case has flow been delivered
and, unfortunately, we find that the
Axe will not fit in it."
CONFUSION
Seems they confused the width I
with the depth in their measure
ments.
The company wrote a hasty reply !
saying they'd send a new ease post
haste. And that was the last Stan- ,
ford heard of the Weber Showcase
and Fixture Co., Inc., of Los Ange- '

les.
Mounting Big Game fever in 1950
prompted the ASSU financial mana
ger to write the firm, asking about
the wayward case. Apparently
they'd lost the original Axe specifi
cations and to measure the Axe had
to go over to Cal where the Axe
then rested.
PERMISSION
Of course Stanford had to get per
mission to let the company take the
measurements. They got the per
mission and the following reply
came from Edward G. Welch, Cali
fornia director of Activities:
"I hope your plans with regard to
building a show case for the Stan
lord Axe are only optimistic
dreams." Th»jy were.
And that brings the case of the
case down to the present, since
nothing has been done about the
case since then.
