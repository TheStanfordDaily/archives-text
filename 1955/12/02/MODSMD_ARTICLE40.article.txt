Lomita, on both sides of the street
with the exception of the reserved
parking areas.
2. On Lomita from the corner of
Serra to the Geology Corner on both
sides of the street with the excep
tion of Reserve areas.
It is felt that the above areas arc
critical parking facilities and that
they should be neither reserved nor
restricted. They should be available
for all those willing to pay for the
privilege.
The meters should have a one hour
maximum, should cost no less than
five cents an hour, and should op
