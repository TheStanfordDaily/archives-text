# Japan Consul Sees Stable Government
## Ban Says Socialists Are Out of Power 
### DAVE SCOTT 
Shoichi Ban, Japanese consul
in San Francisco, yesterday ex
pressed his confidence in stable
government for his country in
the near future.
Speaking before nine people in
Bowman Alumni House Ban de
clared, "If the newly united Con
servative party does not break up,
Japan will have several years of
stable government.
"In my opinion the opposing So
cialist party, also recently reunited,
won't be in majority in the Diet for
several years. It still has too much
of a tendency to place idealism be
fore facts."
Tracing the historical develop
ment of right- and left-wing groups
in Japan, Ban declared that de
mocracy reached its peak in Japan
in the mid-1920's with the establish
ment of a parliamentary system of
government and giving the right to
vote to every male over 20.
During the depression, he stated,
both right- and left-wing groups ex
pressed doubt as to the capabilities
of Japanese democracy to run the
country.
"The police effectively controlled
the left-wing element, but unfortu
nately they couldn't control the right
wing. Ultra-nationalistic army and
navy officers took over, instigating
such incidents as the invasion of
Manchuria.
"Their appeal to the nation?was
quite influential and the Diet;was
relieved of all its authority and the
country was ruled by the cabinet
members and officers.
"After the occupation the political
parties were reorganized. That's
when the Socialists came in. They
were not entirely new. Most of the
groups that had left-wing tendencies
merely banded together.
"The right- and left-wing elements
of the Socialist party split over the
treaty with the United States signed
in San Francisco in 1950, but now
they arc reunited. The leading pow
er is in the hands of the left-wing
elements now."
Ban mentioned that the Socialists
had pledged opposition to Commu
nism, support of the parliamentary
system, and opposition to any alli
ances with cither the Eastern or
Western powers.
In answer to a question Ban de
nied that Japan would recognize
Red China in return for Russia giv
ing it the Kurile Islands. "We would
not wish to antagonize the United
States and other anti - Communist
nations with which we do important
trade," he said. "Right now exten
sive trade with Red China is nothing
more than a political platform."

Japan will have several years of
stable government.
"In my opinion the opposing So
cialist party, also recently reunited,
won't be in majority in the Diet for
several years. It still has too much
of a tendency to place idealism be
fore facts."
Tracing the historical develop
ment of right- and left-wing groups
in Japan, Ban declared that de
mocracy reached its peak in Japan
in the mid-1920's with the establish
ment of a parliamentary system of
government and giving the right to
vote to every male over 20.
During the depression, he stated,
both right- and left-wing groups ex
pressed doubt as to the capabilities
of Japanese democracy to run the
country.
"The police effectively controlled
the left-wing element, but unfortu
nately they couldn't control the right
wing. Ultra-nationalistic army and
navy officers took over, instigating
such incidents as the invasion of
Manchuria.
"Their appeal to the nation?was
quite influential and the Diet;was
relieved of all its authority and the
country was ruled by the cabinet
members and officers.
"After the occupation the political
parties were reorganized. That's
when the Socialists came in. They
were not entirely new. Most of the
groups that had left-wing tendencies
merely banded together.
"The right- and left-wing elements
of the Socialist party split over the
treaty with the United States signed
in San Francisco in 1950, but now
they arc reunited. The leading pow
er is in the hands of the left-wing
elements now."
Ban mentioned that the Socialists
had pledged opposition to Commu
nism, support of the parliamentary
system, and opposition to any alli
ances with cither the Eastern or
Western powers.
In answer to a question Ban de
nied that Japan would recognize
Red China in return for Russia giv
ing it the Kurile Islands. "We would
not wish to antagonize the United
States and other anti - Communist
nations with which we do important
trade," he said. "Right now exten
sive trade with Red China is nothing
more than a political platform."
