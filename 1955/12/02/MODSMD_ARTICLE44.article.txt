# Stanford Research Institute's Job— To Spur Economic Growth of West
## Central Offices Of $10.5 Million Project in Village 
### DAVE SCOTT 
A $10.5 million non-profit
business is being conducted
right in the Stanford Village.
Here are located the central of
fices of the nine-year-old Stan
ford Research Institute.
Back in early 194G Atholl Mcßean,
a Pacific Coast business man, de
cided that the West needed research
facilities to stimulate its economic
growth. Willi the aid of $100,000 he
had raised, he persuaded an already
interested Stanford University to
sponsor a laboratory for non-profit
research.
Now the Stanford Research Insti
tute has grown from its $100,000 be
ginning to an organization with 1185
permanent employees, about $2 mil
lion worth of research plant, and
offices in Los Angeles, Phoenix,
Portland, Honolulu and Washington,
D.C.
Institute Director Jesse E. Hobson
has employed some of the top young
scientists and research experts in
the country.
Stanford University has no oper
ational control over, SRI although
Stanford President Wallace Sterling
is chairman of the Institute's board
of directors and seven of the Uni
versity's trustees are also on the
board.
NON-PROFIT
The Stanford Research Institute is
a non-profit, public service organi
zation. Its main interest is still in
research facilities to stimulate the
economic growth of the West.
Its research spreads into three
main operating divisions — physical
science, engineering ?.nd industrial
economics, and one specialized stury

of effects of extreme pressures and |
explosive energy.
SRl's main offices and laboratories
are located in Menlo Park, so most
of the research is done either there
or in the five regional offices. How
ever, Institute men travel all over j
the world to find research data,
whether it be Israel or the atomic
proving grounds in the Pacific.
Altogether, SRI people have trav
eled more than four million miles.
CONTRACT PROJECTS
More than 1115 research contract
projects had been completed by the
Institute for public agencies and pri- i
vate companies. At present compa

nies and individuals occupy 58 per (
cent of the research, and govern
mcnt. 42 per cent.
All research activities are con
ducted under specific contracts that
provide that the research client will
reimburse SRI for the costs of re
search arid for administration.
Miv>t of this research is devoted to
developing and improving products
and processes. All results and find
ings leading to possible patents are
exclusive property of the clients.
The Institute has undertaken such

I projects as investigating the after
effects of the atom bomb, designing
of aircraft radio systems, planning a
walnut processing program, helping
lumber companies with future prob
lems of lumber shortage and giving
economic guidance to Israel.
Most awesome of SRl's equipment
is a whole radiation engineering lab
oratory built around a 2800 - curie
hunk of radioactive cobalt (JO. It's
one of the few large sources of ra
diation available to private industry.


ACCURATE MEASUREMENT—Stanford Research Institute scientists operate the Proton Bom
barder. This elaborate piece of equipment, developed by SRI physicists, is used for analytical
research. The device can measure thicknesses down to one-billionth of an inch. The equipment
is located in the area in back of the Institute's central offices in the Stanford Village.
