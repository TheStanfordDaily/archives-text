# Stanford Research Institute's Job— To Spur Economic Growth of West
## Central Offices Of $10.5 Million Project in Village 
### DAVE SCOTT 
A $10.5 million non-profit
business is being conducted
right in the Stanford Village.
Here are located the central of
fices of the nine-year-old Stan
ford Research Institute.
Back in early 194G Atholl Mcßean,
a Pacific Coast business man, de
cided that the West needed research
facilities to stimulate its economic
growth. Willi the aid of $100,000 he
had raised, he persuaded an already
interested Stanford University to
sponsor a laboratory for non-profit
research.
Now the Stanford Research Insti
tute has grown from its $100,000 be
ginning to an organization with 1185
permanent employees, about $2 mil
lion worth of research plant, and
offices in Los Angeles, Phoenix,
Portland, Honolulu and Washington,
D.C.
Institute Director Jesse E. Hobson
has employed some of the top young
scientists and research experts in
the country.
Stanford University has no oper
ational control over, SRI although
Stanford President Wallace Sterling
is chairman of the Institute's board
of directors and seven of the Uni
versity's trustees are also on the
board.
NON-PROFIT
The Stanford Research Institute is
a non-profit, public service organi
zation. Its main interest is still in
research facilities to stimulate the
economic growth of the West.
Its research spreads into three
main operating divisions — physical
science, engineering ?.nd industrial
economics, and one specialized stury

of effects of extreme pressures and |
explosive energy.
SRl's main offices and laboratories
are located in Menlo Park, so most
of the research is done either there
or in the five regional offices. How
ever, Institute men travel all over j
the world to find research data,
whether it be Israel or the atomic
proving grounds in the Pacific.
Altogether, SRI people have trav
eled more than four million miles.
CONTRACT PROJECTS
More than 1115 research contract
projects had been completed by the
Institute for public agencies and pri- i
vate companies. At present compa

nies and individuals occupy 58 per (
cent of the research, and govern
mcnt. 42 per cent.
All research activities are con
ducted under specific contracts that
provide that the research client will
reimburse SRI for the costs of re
search arid for administration.
Miv>t of this research is devoted to
developing and improving products
and processes. All results and find
ings leading to possible patents are
exclusive property of the clients.
The Institute has undertaken such

I projects as investigating the after
effects of the atom bomb, designing
of aircraft radio systems, planning a
walnut processing program, helping
lumber companies with future prob
lems of lumber shortage and giving
economic guidance to Israel.
Most awesome of SRl's equipment
is a whole radiation engineering lab
oratory built around a 2800 - curie
hunk of radioactive cobalt (JO. It's
one of the few large sources of ra
diation available to private industry.


ACCURATE MEASUREMENT—Stanford Research Institute scientists operate the Proton Bom
barder. This elaborate piece of equipment, developed by SRI physicists, is used for analytical
research. The device can measure thicknesses down to one-billionth of an inch. The equipment
is located in the area in back of the Institute's central offices in the Stanford Village.
The Institute merely does re
search. One SRI oflicial has stated,
"Our function is to dig and marshal
facts. We don't counsel and advise."
SRI also does a great deal of re
search on its own expense. The or
ganization is exempt from income
tax and it usually tries to do free
research at least to the amount that
it would have paid in taxes.
One recent project concerned the
Apache Indians in Arizona. The In
stitute was asked by the Indians how
they could best utilize their reser
vation land for self-support.
TEAM OF MKN
A whole team of SRI men de
scended on the reservation —an
economist, geologist, mining engi
neer, lumber expert, chemical engi
neer, agriculturist, social psycholo
gist and anthropologist.
The committee outlined a devel
opment program by which the Apa
che people could expect to attain
economic self-sufficiency.
The Institute sponsors symposiums
to focus attention on specific prob
lems. The most recent symposium
was the World Symposium on Ap
plied Solar Energy held in Phoenix
early this month. The meeting rated
an article in Life magazine and has
even made the comic strip "Gordo."
HANDBOOKS
Also for public service SRI peri
odically distributes handbooks of
reference information. The next one
to come out eai'ly next year will
concern air pollution. The Institute
has had investigators down in Los
Angeles investigating the smog situ
ation.
SRI, which is now the second larg
est organization of the kind in the
world next to Battelle Memorial In
stitute, Columbus, Ohio, is still
growing.
The Institute has purchased 35
acres of Stanford Village property
and soon expects to embark on a
$2.5 million building program.

ATOMIC BATH—Physicists inspect an item in SRl's "atomic
bathtub," where research is being carried on with a high-level
source of radioactive cobalt 60. Cold-sterilization of foods and
pharmaceuticals, control of fungus and pests, and speeding up
of chemical reactions are among the fields of research involving
the bathtub. The tub is located in the Institute's Radiation Engi
neering Laboratory.
