# Boeing engineers work with stimulating associates
## 
### 
Main engineering skills arc represented
in this picture. Mechanical, civil, elec
trical and aeronautical engineers—in al
most ec|ual proportion—work closely
together in planning and conducting the
structural test ol airplanes such as the
I! 52. I his stimulating contact among
experts in every lield is typical ol Hoeing
projects. It makes a good engineer even
better, and helps his professional growth.
In no other industry does the engineer
have the opportunity to evaluate so com
pletely—through destruction testing—the
structural integrity ol such a large and
complex product. It is a "classical' chal
lenge lor mechanical and ci\il engineers.
It tests*the instrumentation ingenuity ol
elect rieal engineers and gives aeronautical
engineers an opportunity to prool check

designs by translating theoretical air loads
into practical test loads.
Many immediate problems and "years
ahead projects involving these same
skills and their infinite variations are
under way at Boeing. Ihe application
ol rocket, ram jet and nuclear power to
current and Future aircralt and missiles
is typical ol projects in active study.
Applied research in developing materials
and components to wit list and the tremen
dous heat and stress ol Might at supersonic
speeds oUcrs even further opportunities
to express engineering talent.
More than twice as many engineers
are with Hoeing now than at the peak
ol World War II evidence ol the com
pany's solid growth. I Ins outstanding
group ol engineers has been responsible

lor such aviation landmarks as the 707
Stratoliner jet transport and its kt I >5
militarv tanker version, the Bomarc IM 1 '9
guided missile, the global I! 52 jet bomber
and the l> 47 jet bomher, present back
bone ol Strategic Air Command.
Graduates of top engineering schools
all o\er the country come t<> Hoeing. II
you, too, want breadth til contacts, job
variety and professional growth, it will
pav vou to investigate Hoeing. I here is
always room lor additional creative engi
neers on Boeing's research, design and
production teams.
