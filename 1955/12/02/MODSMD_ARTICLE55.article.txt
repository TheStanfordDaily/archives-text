# Widened Keyhole Stops Giants
## 
### 
College basketball will be played
under two new rules this year. The
more important of the two is the
wide lane rule which widens the
keyhole lane from six to 12 feet.
Under the rule, a player could not
remain in the key for longer than
three seconds. The same time limit
now applies to the wider lane.
HELPS LITTLE MEN
The purpose of the new rule is to
keep the big men from camping
under the basket and dominating
the backbpards. The new rule will
give the smaller men a better chance
to dart in under the bucket and pick
off the rebounds.
It will force the centpr to become
more mobile and develop a better

shooting eye from around the key.
The second new rule is the five
second stall rule. This new rule pre
vents a player from holding the ball
for longer than five seconds at one
time.
UCLA CONTEST
Still in effect is .the foul shooting
rule installed last year. That rule
allows a player shooting a free throw
to take a second shot if he makes
his first.
On a one shot foul, he does not
get the. second $hot if .he .misses,
first, hut, on a two shot foul, the
player,-of course, does get his second
shot.
During thÂ§ last three minutes of
play, all fouls are two shot fouls.
