# Cabinet Discusses Student Activities
## 
### 
A second—and more successful—
| meeting of the ASSU Cabinet was
I held in Bowman Alumni House last
night. Both ASSU President George
I Ralph and his administrative assist
j ant Eric Fricker expressed satisfac
' tion with the meeting.
The main discussion dealt with
the varied aspects of the work of
the Activities Evaluation Commit
tee. 'Committee chairman Jacjc Rich
ardson made a short report on the
study which is being made.
Richardson said his group was
dealing with two major problems.
The first is "social pressure and
pressures exerted by certain group
participation activities." The sec
ond is "general student apathy after
the first year."
Student Financial Manager Bill
Tooley felt that the problem was
not with social events of voluntary
individual participation in such ac
tivities as Ski Club, but with the
activities "designed by the few to
irritate the many."
Much of the discussion dealt with
the general intellectual atmosphere
on campus in relation to both group
activities and the change in attitude
after the freshman year.
