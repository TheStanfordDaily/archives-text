# Undefeated Card Cagers Host St. Mary's Tonight, Try for Seventh Straight
## Wagner Still Ailing But Bond Returns To Starting Lineup 
### BILL NICHOLS 
The Stanford basketball team
takes an unbeaten record to the
Pavilion floor tonight against St.
Mary's College. An apparently
underrated bunch of Cardinal
cagers have won six straight
games to date, and have jelled
into a good team.
The Cards were supposed to lack
height and reserves. But the short
Indians have outrebounded every
team to date. And this weekend,
against lowa and Wisconsin, they
played without two starters, and the
reserves came through in acceptable,
if not spectacular, style.
GALLOPING GAELS
St. Mary's has a better than aver
age squad which ranks about even
with San Jose State behind USF in
the California Basketball Associa
tion. The Gaels from Moraga are led
by Bill Sanchez and Mike Wads
worth and have a 6-3 record to date.
Their losses came on a road trip to
the Northwest, and their big win was
over California. It Is Cal's only loss.
Sanchez was runner-up to George
Selleck in 1952 for Southern Cali
fornia "High School Player-of-the-
Year" honors, while Wadsworth has
been a dependable performer for the
Galloping Gaels for the past two
seasons.
St. Mary's can also count on Bill
Bagley, who is just out of the serv
ice, and who was a top player for
the Moragans in past seasons, and
O'Dell Johnson, a JC transfer from
Fresno where he led all JC scorers
in California last season.
Bill Bond, who was out of the two
games last week with flu, has re
joined the team and is slated to see
action. Hap Wagner, whose foot is
in a cast, will not play, and Gary
Van Galder will replace him.
HUSKIES FALL
Stanford opened their season in
early December with two upset vic
tories over a tall Washingon team.
Stanford won the first game easily—
leading 42-21 at halftime. The final
