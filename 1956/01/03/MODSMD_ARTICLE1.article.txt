# Undefeated Card Cagers Host St. Mary's Tonight, Try for Seventh Straight
## Wagner Still Ailing But Bond Returns To Starting Lineup 
### BILL NICHOLS 
The Stanford basketball team
takes an unbeaten record to the
Pavilion floor tonight against St.
Mary's College. An apparently
underrated bunch of Cardinal
cagers have won six straight
games to date, and have jelled
into a good team.
The Cards were supposed to lack
height and reserves. But the short
Indians have outrebounded every
team to date. And this weekend,
against lowa and Wisconsin, they
played without two starters, and the
reserves came through in acceptable,
if not spectacular, style.
GALLOPING GAELS
St. Mary's has a better than aver
age squad which ranks about even
with San Jose State behind USF in
the California Basketball Associa
tion. The Gaels from Moraga are led
by Bill Sanchez and Mike Wads
worth and have a 6-3 record to date.
Their losses came on a road trip to
the Northwest, and their big win was
over California. It Is Cal's only loss.
Sanchez was runner-up to George
Selleck in 1952 for Southern Cali
fornia "High School Player-of-the-
Year" honors, while Wadsworth has
been a dependable performer for the
Galloping Gaels for the past two
seasons.
St. Mary's can also count on Bill
Bagley, who is just out of the serv
ice, and who was a top player for
the Moragans in past seasons, and
O'Dell Johnson, a JC transfer from
Fresno where he led all JC scorers
in California last season.
Bill Bond, who was out of the two
games last week with flu, has re
joined the team and is slated to see
action. Hap Wagner, whose foot is
in a cast, will not play, and Gary
Van Galder will replace him.
HUSKIES FALL
Stanford opened their season in
early December with two upset vic
tories over a tall Washingon team.
Stanford won the first game easily—
leading 42-21 at halftime. The final
score was 72-55, with Bill Bond scor
ing 22 points.
The second game was tighter.
Washington got off to an early lead
and it was not until almost halftime
that coach Howie Dallmar's cagers
could catch up. But, with Selleclc
and Bond each scoring 18 points, vic
tory came 73-GB.
GREEN INDIANS
Stanford bounced back after «
three week layoff to eke out a one
point victory over previously un
beaten Dartmouth College. Greenie
center Jim Farncis scored 13 points
in the first half, but Barry Brown
played magnificent ball, both on the
boards and shooting, to give the
Cards a 31-27 halftime lead.
The Easterners closed fast though
and with one minute, 40 seconds to
play Stanford was stalling with the
score 56-55. Suddenly, Selleck tried
to pass in under the basket, and
three Dartmouth Indians converged
on the ball. They called time, and
laid their strategy, but to no avail
as with 14 seconds to go. Bill Bond
grabbed the ball from Dave Car
ruthers as he went in for a layup,
and victory was assured.
Dartmouth was the nation's team
rebound leader, but Brown and his
mates got 39 to 20 loose balls. Brown
also scored 21 points, although Fran
cis was tops with 22.
BRONCSBUCKED
Winless Santa Clavn faced Stan
ford the next nigh; The Cards had
a 12 point lead at intermission over
an inept Bronco five, but then the
Broncs caught fire, sinking unbe
lievable shots, and eight minutes
later they led 47-46. The end came
there, however, as S.C. star. Rich
Montgomery, fouled out at this point
and Brown scored several quick bas
kets to ice the contest. The final
score was 62-55.
Last weekend Stanford took on
two Big Ten teams. lowa, fourth in
the NCAA tourney last spring,- and
Wisconsin. Bill Bond, recovered from

a blood ailment which had handi
capped him against Dartmouth and
Santa Clara, missed both games be
cause of flu, and Hap Wagner, start
ing guard, sprained his ankle in the
first six minutes and is doubtful for
the Washington series this weekend.
HAWKEYE THRILLER
The lowa game was a thriller. The
contest got off to a' slow start, with
lowa controlling the boards, but un
able to hit many shots. The score
was 4-4 with five minutes played.
The Hawkeyes got a slim lead, but
the Cards tied it at the half at 21-21.
Bill Flanders, subbing for Bond,
dumped in three key baskets during
the period, and Selleck scored eight
points.
Starting center, Carlos Bea, fouled
out right at the start of the second
half, so Stanford was playing with
three "subs"—Gary Van Galder at
guard, Carl Isaacs at center and
Flanders at forward. lowa pulled
out to a 34-27 lead and put in the
second string. This was a mistake,
as Stanford rallied for a 41-34 lead
which was enough to win. lowa nar
rowed the margin to 54-52, and
missed the tying shot as the buzzer
sounded.

The Wisconsin game proved much
easier. The lead see-sawed at the
beginning but with the Badgers
leading 14-13, Stanford ran off 12
straight points, and that was the
game. Stanford led 33-21 at the half,
and won by the same margin, 65-53,
although the visitors twice narrowed
the Card lead to six points. Brown
and Selleck led the scoring parade
with 18 and 16 respectively.
CARDS LOOK GOOD
Throughout the six games Stan
ford showed good hustle and amaz
ing rebound strength. Only once did
they look really bad, and that was
against Dartmouth in the early min
utes of the game, and after a three
week layoff for finals.
Bill Bond and Brown have devel
oped into potent scoring threats, and
Selleck has looked good for the most
part, although getting off some bad
passes in the Cow Palace games
with Dartmouth and Santa Clara.
Brown, however, has turned into a
junior-grade Bill Russell, blocking
shots, and outplaying taller men on
the boards, while leading the scoring
parade for the Indians.
Brown is leading the team in scor
ing and rebounds, while Selleck is

second in both departments. Brown
has grabbed 78 rebounds and Selleck
38. On a team basis Stanford has
outclassed its opposition in every
thing except free throw accuracy.
Stanford has made 65%, while Card
opponents have hit for 71%.
From the floor the Cards have hit
126 out of 306 shots for while
the opposition has connected on 113
out of 323 attempts for 35%.

HUSKIES FALL
Stanford opened their season in
early December with two upset vic
tories over a tall Washingon team.
Stanford won the first game easily—
leading 42-21 at halftime. The final
score was 72-55, with Bill Bond scor
ing 22 points.
The second game was tighter.
Washington got off to an early lead
and it was not until almost halftime
that coach Howie Dallmar's cagers
could catch up. But, with Selleclc
and Bond each scoring 18 points, vic
tory came 73-GB.
GREEN INDIANS
Stanford bounced back after «
three week layoff to eke out a one
point victory over previously un
beaten Dartmouth College. Greenie
center Jim Farncis scored 13 points
in the first half, but Barry Brown
played magnificent ball, both on the
boards and shooting, to give the
Cards a 31-27 halftime lead.
The Easterners closed fast though
and with one minute, 40 seconds to
play Stanford was stalling with the
score 56-55. Suddenly, Selleck tried
to pass in under the basket, and
three Dartmouth Indians converged
on the ball. They called time, and
laid their strategy, but to no avail
as with 14 seconds to go. Bill Bond
grabbed the ball from Dave Car
ruthers as he went in for a layup,
and victory was assured.
Dartmouth was the nation's team
rebound leader, but Brown and his
mates got 39 to 20 loose balls. Brown
also scored 21 points, although Fran
cis was tops with 22.
BRONCSBUCKED
Winless Santa Clavn faced Stan
ford the next nigh; The Cards had
a 12 point lead at intermission over
an inept Bronco five, but then the
Broncs caught fire, sinking unbe
lievable shots, and eight minutes
later they led 47-46. The end came
there, however, as S.C. star. Rich
Montgomery, fouled out at this point
and Brown scored several quick bas
kets to ice the contest. The final
score was 62-55.
Last weekend Stanford took on
two Big Ten teams. lowa, fourth in
the NCAA tourney last spring,- and
Wisconsin. Bill Bond, recovered from

a blood ailment which had handi
capped him against Dartmouth and
Santa Clara, missed both games be
cause of flu, and Hap Wagner, start
ing guard, sprained his ankle in the
first six minutes and is doubtful for
the Washington series this weekend.
HAWKEYE THRILLER
The lowa game was a thriller. The
contest got off to a' slow start, with
lowa controlling the boards, but un
able to hit many shots. The score
was 4-4 with five minutes played.
The Hawkeyes got a slim lead, but
the Cards tied it at the half at 21-21.
Bill Flanders, subbing for Bond,
dumped in three key baskets during
the period, and Selleck scored eight
points.
Starting center, Carlos Bea, fouled
out right at the start of the second
half, so Stanford was playing with
three "subs"—Gary Van Galder at
guard, Carl Isaacs at center and
Flanders at forward. lowa pulled
out to a 34-27 lead and put in the
second string. This was a mistake,
as Stanford rallied for a 41-34 lead
which was enough to win. lowa nar
rowed the margin to 54-52, and
missed the tying shot as the buzzer
sounded.

The Wisconsin game proved much
easier. The lead see-sawed at the
beginning but with the Badgers
leading 14-13, Stanford ran off 12
straight points, and that was the
game. Stanford led 33-21 at the half,
and won by the same margin, 65-53,
although the visitors twice narrowed
the Card lead to six points. Brown
and Selleck led the scoring parade
with 18 and 16 respectively.
CARDS LOOK GOOD
Throughout the six games Stan
ford showed good hustle and amaz
ing rebound strength. Only once did
they look really bad, and that was
against Dartmouth in the early min
utes of the game, and after a three
week layoff for finals.
Bill Bond and Brown have devel
oped into potent scoring threats, and
Selleck has looked good for the most
part, although getting off some bad
passes in the Cow Palace games
with Dartmouth and Santa Clara.
Brown, however, has turned into a
junior-grade Bill Russell, blocking
shots, and outplaying taller men on
the boards, while leading the scoring
parade for the Indians.
Brown is leading the team in scor
ing and rebounds, while Selleck is

second in both departments. Brown
has grabbed 78 rebounds and Selleck
38. On a team basis Stanford has
outclassed its opposition in every
thing except free throw accuracy.
Stanford has made 65%, while Card
opponents have hit for 71%.
From the floor the Cards have hit
126 out of 306 shots for while
the opposition has connected on 113
out of 323 attempts for 35%.

The Stanford basketball team
takes an unbeaten record to the

underrated bunch of Cardinal

games to date, and have jelled
into a good team.
The Cards were supposed to lack

Indians have outrebounded every
team to date. And this weekend,
against lowa and Wisconsin, they
played without two starters, and the

if not spectacular, style.
GALLOPING GAELS
St. Mary's has a better than aver
age squad which ranks about even
with San Jose State behind USF in
the California Basketball Associa
tion. The Gaels from Moraga are led
by Bill Sanchez and Mike Wads
worth and have a 6-3 record to date.
Their losses came on a road trip to
the Northwest, and their big win was
over California. It Is Cal's only loss.
Sanchez was runner-up to George
Selleck in 1952 for Southern Cali
fornia "High School Player-of-the-

been a dependable performer for the
Galloping Gaels for the past two
seasons.
St. Mary's can also count on Bill
Bagley, who is just out of the serv

the Moragans in past seasons, and
O'Dell Johnson, a JC transfer from
Fresno where he led all JC scorers

HAWKEYE THRILLER
The lowa game was a thriller. The
contest got off to a' slow start, with
lowa controlling the boards, but un
able to hit many shots. The score
was 4-4 with five minutes played.
The Hawkeyes got a slim lead, but
the Cards tied it at the half at 21-21.
Bill Flanders, subbing for Bond,

the period, and Selleck scored eight
points.
Starting center, Carlos Bea, fouled
out right at the start of the second
half, so Stanford was playing with
three "subs"—Gary Van Galder at
guard, Carl Isaacs at center and
Flanders at forward. lowa pulled

second string. This was a mistake,
as Stanford rallied for a 41-34 lead
which was enough to win. lowa nar

sounded.

The Wisconsin game proved much
easier. The lead see-sawed at the
beginning but with the Badgers
leading 14-13, Stanford ran off 12
straight points, and that was the
game. Stanford led 33-21 at the half,
and won by the same margin, 65-53,
although the visitors twice narrowed
the Card lead to six points. Brown
and Selleck led the scoring parade
with 18 and 16 respectively.
CARDS LOOK GOOD
Throughout the six games Stan

they look really bad, and that was
against Dartmouth in the early min
utes of the game, and after a three
week layoff for finals.
Bill Bond and Brown have devel
oped into potent scoring threats, and
Selleck has looked good for the most
part, although getting off some bad
passes in the Cow Palace games
with Dartmouth and Santa Clara.
Brown, however, has turned into a
junior-grade Bill Russell, blocking
shots, and outplaying taller men on
the boards, while leading the scoring
parade for the Indians.
Brown is leading the team in scor
ing and rebounds, while Selleck is

second in both departments. Brown
has grabbed 78 rebounds and Selleck
38. On a team basis Stanford has
outclassed its opposition in every
thing except free throw accuracy.
Stanford has made 65%, while Card

The Stanford basketball team
takes an unbeaten record to the
Pavilion floor tonight against St.
Mary's College. An apparently
underrated bunch of Cardinal
cagers have won six straight
games to date, and have jelled
into a good team.
The Cards were supposed to lack
height and reserves. But the short
Indians have outrebounded every
team to date. And this weekend,
against lowa and Wisconsin, they
played without two starters, and the
reserves came through in acceptable,
if not spectacular, style.
GALLOPING GAELS
St. Mary's has a better than aver
age squad which ranks about even
with San Jose State behind USF in
the California Basketball Associa
tion. The Gaels from Moraga are led
by Bill Sanchez and Mike Wads
worth and have a 6-3 record to date.
Their losses came on a road trip to
the Northwest, and their big win was
over California. It Is Cal's only loss.
Sanchez was runner-up to George
Selleck in 1952 for Southern Cali
fornia "High School Player-of-the-
Year" honors, while Wadsworth has
been a dependable performer for the
Galloping Gaels for the past two
seasons.
St. Mary's can also count on Bill
Bagley, who is just out of the serv
ice, and who was a top player for
the Moragans in past seasons, and
O'Dell Johnson, a JC transfer from
Fresno where he led all JC scorers
in California last season.
Bill Bond, who was out of the two
games last week with flu, has re
joined the team and is slated to see
action. Hap Wagner, whose foot is
in a cast, will not play, and Gary
Van Galder will replace him.
HUSKIES FALL
Stanford opened their season in

GREEN INDIANS
Stanford bounced back after «

boards and shooting, to give the
Cards a 31-27 halftime lead.
The Easterners closed fast though
and with one minute, 40 seconds to
play Stanford was stalling with the
score 56-55. Suddenly, Selleck tried
to pass in under the basket, and
three Dartmouth Indians converged
on the ball. They called time, and

Starting center, Carlos Bea, fouled
out right at the start of the second
half, so Stanford was playing with
three "subs"—Gary Van Galder at
guard, Carl Isaacs at center and
Flanders at forward. lowa pulled
out to a 34-27 lead and put in the
second string. This was a mistake,
as Stanford rallied for a 41-34 lead
which was enough to win. lowa nar
rowed the margin to 54-52, and
missed the tying shot as the buzzer
sounded.

The Wisconsin game proved much
easier. The lead see-sawed at the
beginning but with the Badgers
leading 14-13, Stanford ran off 12
straight points, and that was the
game. Stanford led 33-21 at the half,
and won by the same margin, 65-53,
although the visitors twice narrowed
the Card lead to six points. Brown
and Selleck led the scoring parade
with 18 and 16 respectively.
CARDS LOOK GOOD
Throughout the six games Stan
ford showed good hustle and amaz
ing rebound strength. Only once did
they look really bad, and that was
against Dartmouth in the early min
utes of the game, and after a three
week layoff for finals.
Bill Bond and Brown have devel
oped into potent scoring threats, and
Selleck has looked good for the most
part, although getting off some bad
passes in the Cow Palace games
with Dartmouth and Santa Clara.
Brown, however, has turned into a
junior-grade Bill Russell, blocking
shots, and outplaying taller men on
the boards, while leading the scoring
parade for the Indians.
Brown is leading the team in scor
ing and rebounds, while Selleck is

second in both departments. Brown
has grabbed 78 rebounds and Selleck
38. On a team basis Stanford has
outclassed its opposition in every
thing except free throw accuracy.
Stanford has made 65%, while Card
opponents have hit for 71%.
From the floor the Cards have hit
126 out of 306 shots for while
the opposition has connected on 113
out of 323 attempts for 35%.

The Stanford basketball team
takes an unbeaten record to the
Pavilion floor tonight against St.
Mary's College. An apparently
underrated bunch of Cardinal
cagers have won six straight
games to date, and have jelled
into a good team.
The Cards were supposed to lack
height and reserves. But the short
Indians have outrebounded every
team to date. And this weekend,
against lowa and Wisconsin, they
played without two starters, and the
reserves came through in acceptable,
if not spectacular, style.
GALLOPING GAELS
St. Mary's has a better than aver
age squad which ranks about even
with San Jose State behind USF in
the California Basketball Associa
tion. The Gaels from Moraga are led
by Bill Sanchez and Mike Wads
worth and have a 6-3 record to date.
Their losses came on a road trip to
the Northwest, and their big win was
over California. It Is Cal's only loss.
Sanchez was runner-up to George
Selleck in 1952 for Southern Cali
fornia "High School Player-of-the-
Year" honors, while Wadsworth has
been a dependable performer for the
Galloping Gaels for the past two
seasons.
St. Mary's can also count on Bill
Bagley, who is just out of the serv
ice, and who was a top player for
the Moragans in past seasons, and
O'Dell Johnson, a JC transfer from
Fresno where he led all JC scorers
in California last season.
Bill Bond, who was out of the two
games last week with flu, has re
joined the team and is slated to see
action. Hap Wagner, whose foot is
in a cast, will not play, and Gary
Van Galder will replace him.
HUSKIES FALL
Stanford opened their season in
early December with two upset vic
tories over a tall Washingon team.
Stanford won the first game easily—
leading 42-21 at halftime. The final
score was 72-55, with Bill Bond scor
ing 22 points.
The second game was tighter.
Washington got off to an early lead
and it was not until almost halftime
that coach Howie Dallmar's cagers
could catch up. But, with Selleclc
and Bond each scoring 18 points, vic
tory came 73-GB.
GREEN INDIANS
Stanford bounced back after «
three week layoff to eke out a one
point victory over previously un
beaten Dartmouth College. Greenie
center Jim Farncis scored 13 points
in the first half, but Barry Brown
played magnificent ball, both on the
boards and shooting, to give the
Cards a 31-27 halftime lead.
The Easterners closed fast though
and with one minute, 40 seconds to
play Stanford was stalling with the
score 56-55. Suddenly, Selleck tried
to pass in under the basket, and
three Dartmouth Indians converged
on the ball. They called time, and
laid their strategy, but to no avail
as with 14 seconds to go. Bill Bond
grabbed the ball from Dave Car
ruthers as he went in for a layup,
and victory was assured.
Dartmouth was the nation's team
rebound leader, but Brown and his
mates got 39 to 20 loose balls. Brown
also scored 21 points, although Fran
cis was tops with 22.
BRONCSBUCKED

ford the next nigh; The Cards had
a 12 point lead at intermission over
an inept Bronco five, but then the
Broncs caught fire, sinking unbe
lievable shots, and eight minutes
later they led 47-46. The end came
there, however, as S.C. star. Rich
Montgomery, fouled out at this point
and Brown scored several quick bas
kets to ice the contest. The final
score was 62-55.
Last weekend Stanford took on
two Big Ten teams. lowa, fourth in
the NCAA tourney last spring,- and
Wisconsin. Bill Bond, recovered from

Santa Clara, missed both games be
cause of flu, and Hap Wagner, start
ing guard, sprained his ankle in the
first six minutes and is doubtful for
the Washington series this weekend.

the Cards tied it at the half at 21-21.
