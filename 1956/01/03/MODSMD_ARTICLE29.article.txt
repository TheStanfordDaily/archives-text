# significant contributions of '55
## 
### 
This is the season for choosing the man of
the year, the woman of the year, the star of
the year in almost ell conceivable fields. It's
a good way to sum up the year and we think
we'll do it for the campus.
Even though we couldn't create much more
widespread displeasure than a national maga
zine, we won't restrict ourselves to one man,
hut we'll cover a number of people who made
significant contributions to the Stanford scene
in 1955.
If ycu were to select one student as Stanford
m-?.n of the year, you would probably have to
tr.lce our president, George Ralph. His story
was the mo~t dramatic and controversial of
th'? year. His ascent to prominence and his
overwhelming victory in the election were
nothing short of amazing.
The outstanding member of the faculty in
1955 was Dr. Willis E. Lamb Jr., the 42-year-old
physics professor who won the Nobel Prize in
nuclear physics.
The faculty member who probably had the
greatest impact on the student population was
Assistant Professor of English Wilfred H. Stone,
who authored a hard-hitting article on campus
activities in these pages.

For Stanford's woman of the year v/e nomi
nate Mrs. Florence Moore, whose million-dollar j
donation sparked the construction plans for a
greatly-needed new women's dormitory.
On the student level other people should be j
recognized for their contributions:
Pete Bing and Bob Gable, last year's ASSU
president and student manager, respectively, |
worked arduously and successfully to present
the students with a new constitution.
Jiggs Davis headed the Pre-ftegistration
Committee, which reappraised and success
fully improved its program for freshmen.
George Sheldon earned a spot on the honor
roll, first for his lively band which filled the ,
Pavilion with music during the basketball sea-1
son, and secondly for his work with the "new i
look" marching band during the football cam- 1
paign.
Bruce Lcwry and Bill Scott, Gaieties director j
and Ram's Head president, respectively, rate
accolades for the best Big Game Gaieties in j
many years.
That's last year. But now it's this year. And
we cam watch for the new contributions and
contributors.

Even though we couldn't create much more
widespread displeasure than a national maga
zine, we won't restrict ourselves to one man,
hut we'll cover a number of people who made
significant contributions to the Stanford scene
in 1955.
If ycu were to select one student as Stanford
m-?.n of the year, you would probably have to
tr.lce our president, George Ralph. His story
was the mo~t dramatic and controversial of
th'? year. His ascent to prominence and his
overwhelming victory in the election were
nothing short of amazing.
The outstanding member of the faculty in
1955 was Dr. Willis E. Lamb Jr., the 42-year-old
physics professor who won the Nobel Prize in
nuclear physics.
The faculty member who probably had the
greatest impact on the student population was
Assistant Professor of English Wilfred H. Stone,
who authored a hard-hitting article on campus
activities in these pages.

For Stanford's woman of the year v/e nomi
nate Mrs. Florence Moore, whose million-dollar j
donation sparked the construction plans for a
greatly-needed new women's dormitory.
On the student level other people should be j
recognized for their contributions:
Pete Bing and Bob Gable, last year's ASSU
president and student manager, respectively, |
worked arduously and successfully to present
the students with a new constitution.
Jiggs Davis headed the Pre-ftegistration
Committee, which reappraised and success
fully improved its program for freshmen.
George Sheldon earned a spot on the honor
roll, first for his lively band which filled the ,
Pavilion with music during the basketball sea-1
son, and secondly for his work with the "new i
look" marching band during the football cam- 1
paign.
Bruce Lcwry and Bill Scott, Gaieties director j
and Ram's Head president, respectively, rate
accolades for the best Big Game Gaieties in j
many years.
That's last year. But now it's this year. And
we cam watch for the new contributions and
contributors.
