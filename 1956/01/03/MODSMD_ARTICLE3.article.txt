# Farm Gets $2.3 Million Ford Grant
## 
### 
Stanford received its largest gift
since the original $20 million found
ing grant when the Ford Foundation
gave the University $2,344,400 last
month to help increase faculty sal
aries^
The University expects the income
from the grant to boost salaries,
which are now slightly below aver
age for large private institutions, by
about a total of $100,000 per year,
according to officials.
Stanford's yearly budget for teach
ing salaries now exceeds $4 million,
but this is about 28 per cent higher
than it was three years ago.
The grant to Stanford was part of
a half a billion dollar donation to
the nation's colleges and hospitals.
Of that sum, $210 million went to
the colleges and universities to raise
teaching salaries.
Hospitals throughout the country
received a total of $200 million to
increase their services to the public.
Alto Hospital received $129,200
which will be used to move two hos
pital barracks from Stanford Village
to provide 92 more beds at the hos
pital, almost a 50 per cent increase.
Ford also set aside $90 million to
be distributed among the medical
schools in the country. Stanford
hopes to receive a share of the
money for the Medical School which
will be moved to campus in the near
future, according to a University
official.
Included in the grant to Stanford
was a "bonus" for being among the
leaders in raising faculty pay in the
last few years. For the next 10 years,
Stanford may use only the income
of the main grant-, but the principal
of the supplementary "bonus" grant
may be used at University discre
tion.
President Wallace Sterling said:
"Stanford is tremendously grateful
for this grant from the Ford Foun
dation. We know that it will be very
helpful in further advancement of
faculty salaries. The grant is a major
contribution in one of the most criti
cal areas of higher education."
