Another year, another quarter, more books,
•nd a new toothbrush. Happy New Year.
Today is Reg Day, and there are just all sorts
of exciting things happening besides plain
humdrum reg books and long, long lines.
You're curious, we can tell; ,so here is the
roundup:
1. Registration: If you haven't figured it out
by now, try the back page of the Time Sched
ule for the complete, confusing dope. But if
you've lost your T.S., we'uns got a little sum
mary on page one.
2. Freshman men have a meeting to tell them
all about mean cl' Rushing, tonight at 7 in Mem
Aud. "Faint heart ne'er won fair lady"; and
try pinning that to your sweater instead of your
name to make a much stronger impression at
the open houses.
3. Speaking of nocturnal athletics, the bas
ketball team plays St. Mary's tonight at 8 in the
Pavilion, so guess where the Reg Dance will
be?
4. You can't? You don't care? Just for that
crack, we'll tell you. The Winter Quarter Reg
Dance will be held in Encina lounge. Uh-huh.
Entitled "Sno-Ball," it's sponsored by the Stan
ford Ski Club, from 9 to 1.
Tomorrow is the first day of classes, and ac
cording to the Registrar's Office, you must sign

a blue card for each class you plan on attend
ing. Wednesday night is the first night of rush
ing, and the schedule open house at
the Eating Club triangle to which all rushees
are invited. There's a similar sort of a project
starting on the Row Thursday night. . . . And
guys, be natural.
If you're a senior, 21 and a close personal
friend of Fullenwider, you are cordially invited
to the Senior Happy Hour down at Frank s
Steak House, tomorrow from 9 to midnight.
Friday and Saturday nights, there's red hot
basketball thrills at Seattle. Coach Howie's
boys are going north to tackle the large lads
from the tall timber in a real tough double
header to open the league season. Better gas
up and go.

Sunday night, the Flicks are on. To lead off,
there's that old CinemaScope favorite "Three
Coins in the Fountain," starring C. Webb and
Dorothy McGuire. Also Selected Short Sub
jects. Time: 7:30. •
If you've noticed the absence of our usual
quota of informal drama, inspirational talks,
and the strange disappearance of the Tuesday
Evening Series from these pages, laugh not too
soon, friends. Wait'll next week.
