h ightened of nixon
To the Editor:
Jim Palmer arched his back in the Dec. 2 Daily,
and vigorously chastised Harry S. Truman for sup
posedly whacking that nice chap and junior states
man, Richard M. Nixon, across his "chipmunk cheeks"
with u fistful of mud. Mr. Palmer's article was a
paraphrase of the eulogy of Nixon in the Oct. 10 issue
of Time magazine, and Mr. Palmer proves to be no
more adept at political analysis than does his inspira
t. Tim a , however, manages to donate its mistakes
■.v!ih a maximum of style.
matters not at all if Harry Truman called Nixon
n s.o.b. (he probably didn't), since he obviously
t.:.nks he is one. It is permissable, I believe, for Mr.
T 'iman to call a person who accused him of being a
ti. .tor an 5.0.b., but what we have to consider is
win ther anyone besides the admittedly-biased former
President has the right to add this subscript to the
Nixon name.
It's just not true to say that Nixon is the only one
the Democrats can find to criticize. The Republicans
1 been rather prolific in providing nominees to
.'■•vve as targets for Democratic blasts. Eisenhower's
jiolicie:; are being soundly attacked, and he is not
; onally attacked because of his popularity, but be
( .. .s. of hi;: integrity and esteem. Mr. Eisenhower i.s
.'.ected because we know what he stands for. He
' \ he -incere while waxing mightily about the most
id of platitudes, but when has Dicky taken a eon
tent and sincere stand on a matter involving prin
ciple?
Mr. Nixon had a totally undistinguished record as
<" legislator. He voted for many of the worst bills and
few of the best. No prominent legislation stems from
t genius. Hi.--, career shows that he is devoid of,
.'t does not seem interested in, any basic general
philosophy. He came into the public eye because of
one event . . . the Chambers-Hiss affair. Nixon ac
quitted himself well in that investigation, and has
i ioro:ighly capitalized on it. The Democrats do not
begrudge his activities in that trial, but they resent
<lt .-fly his linking Mr. Stevenson to Communism be
et n e that gentleman accepts the long-established
principle of a man being innocent until proven guilty.
T; 1 is action Ls hard for a man to understand who has
nrver endorsed anything but a cocker spaniel.
Many people have despised. Nixon from the time he
entered politics, and the reasons are as follows. In
1946 he ran for Congress against Jerry Voorhis, listed
v Washington correspondents as "the best Congress
ma" west of the Mississippi." Nixon yelled "Com
njuni.--t" and Voorhis lost. Nixon tried for the Senate
in 1950 against Mrs. Helen Douglas. He talked about
"Mr. . Douglas' friends, the Communists," and the
•' mmunists called her "a capitalist warmonger." Mrs.
Dougias was presented to the voters as a California
version of Vito Marcantonio, and wound up as the
'' ••:• in a campaign the Los Angeles Daily News

called "the dirtiest in state history." Nixon's report
on the cost of his lavish campaign was so absurdly
low that even the Republican press was shocked.
In the two years Dick was in the Senate he received
$18,235 from a group of California businessmen, be
cause they considered his salary as a senator to be
"pitifully inadequate for a salesman of free enter
prise trying to do a job for his people in California."
When the legality of these funds was questioned, Dick
got on television and said it was all right because he
didn't spend the cash on mink.
Richard M. Nixon earned his title as the "white
collar McCarthy" in the 1954 campaign. He grasped
the "twenty years of treason" Iheme to his bosom
and barnstormed across the country endorsing every
one who called hi-; opponent, a traitor. Look at those
speeches, Mr. Palmer! (He didn't seem to be too
effective, however, because most of his men lost.)
Mr. Nixon lias repeatedly embarrassed the Admin
istration during his term a.-; Vice-President—witness
Indochina and foreign aid. He did serve as the
"team's" hatchet man in the McCarthy squelch, but
even there he worked up little enthusiasm unLil it
locked as if Joe fancied sleeping in the White House.
"The undeniably outstanding achievements" Mr. Pal
mer speaks of probably refer to his good-will tours,
and to his ability as the Republican party fixer-up-er.
I'll agree that preventing the Republicans from axing
one another up is no mean feat, but I'm not persuaded
that such deeds are of merit to the country. The
"sweeping changes" he brought into the Vice-Presi
dency are so much bosh, since the phrase i.s nothing
but a gimmick to make him look big to the voters.
If Nixon does work harder than other people it is due
more to the President's love of golf than to his own
originality.
'I he President called Nixon "the moat valuable
member of my team" because Dick keeps politics and
politicians out of Ike's hair. Dick is a great "team
player," and the "Crusade" thinks highly of "team
players." There i.s little 'to indicate, however, that
Eisenhower looks to Nixon for much help concerning
policy decisions. This was shown during the Presi
dent's recent illness. Richard M. Nixon led the "team"
in prayer, but Assistant President Sherman Adams,
Secretary of the Treasury George Humphrey and
Press Secretary James Hagerty seemed, to run the
country.
If Mr. Palmer ever writes .about Richard M. Nixon
again, it i.s hoped that he will take his cue from
another Stanford man (Victor M. Arnautoff) who
drew a much truer portrait. The Nixon of the po
litical cartoon which created a fuss in the fall i.s the
Nixon of the flesh. Mr. Palmer sees the Nixon created
by the Administration's Madison Avenue myth-mak
ers, and it is because he and many others believe in
this legend that I am frightened of Mr. Richard M.
Nixon. Mr. Palmer ends by predicting that "Nixon
may be drowned politically." My hope is that this
last small sentence is very, very true.
