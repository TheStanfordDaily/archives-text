# 'RAINS OF RANCHIPUR'
## Show Has Good Plot — Plus Moral 
### RICHARD MENDE 
Louis Bromfield is of an older
generation of writers which be
lieved that a good plot and a
good moral are needed in a
novel. "The Rains Came," from
which the current movie "The
Rains of Ranchipur" was made,
had both.
This latest movie version has lost
j some of the mysterious atmosphere
o£ the novel, and chopped out some
| excellent story-telling of an earlier
black-and-white film, but it is still
an engaging production.
The story concerns a fabulously
j wealthy woman whose insatiable de
sires, mostly physical, keep her

I hunting for com
j panions, long hav-
I ing wearied of her
: husband. Lana
| Turner, who fills
this role nicely,
finally becomes
I enamoured with
ian "untouchable".
Hindu mystic. Af-

ter some minor intriguing, they

struggle to attain an ideal of unself
ishness in which '"it is not enough
for one to do good; one must be
good."
The conversion to unselfishness is
more plausibly represented in the
earlier film in which the heroine
contracts a fatal disease herself
while helping plague victims. In
this picture she renounces her Hindu
friend and goes back to her husband.
The philosophical messages are
somewhat long-winded in places and
tend to slow down the action.
And unfortunately there is too
close a correlation between the
moral or immoral decisions of the
principals and the behavior of the
elements. It is a little disconcerting
in our age—though it may have
seemed fitting in Mr. Bromfield's—
to have it rain every time someone
sins, necessitating a flood of the
province of Ranchipur before Lana
and her Hindu friend straighten
themselves out.
Fred Mac Murray's fine acting
nearly rescues his part from the pat
tern of disenchanted idealists drown
ing their sorrows in drink. Eugene
Leontovich is a convincingly stub
born Maharani whose only selfish-

ness "was for Ranchipur."
Although it is argued that the ul
i timate good is serving "the people"
; it is a weakness that these people are
| only represented symbolically.
But all things considered, this is
| a worth-while if somewhat glossy
production.
