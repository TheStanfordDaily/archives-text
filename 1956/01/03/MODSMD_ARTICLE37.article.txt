THE TRUE AND TRAGICAL TALE OF
HAPPY JACK SIGAFOOS
Who would have thought that Happy Jack Sigafoos, the boy
the sky never rained on, would ever teeter on the edge of a life
of crime?
Certainly there was no sign of it in his boyhood. His home
life was most tranquil and uplifting. His mother was a nice
plump lady who hummed a lot and gave baskets to the poor. His
father was a highly respected citizen who could imitate more
than four hundred bird calls and once saved an elderly widow
from drowning in his good suit. (That is, Mr. Sigafoos was in
his good suit; the elderly widow was in swimming trunks.)

Jinppy Jack's life was nothing short of idyllic—until he went
off to college.
In college Happy Jack quickly became a typical freshman
tweedy, seedy, and needy. He learned the joys of rounding out
his personality, and he learned the cost. His allowance vanished
like dew before the morning sun. There were times, it grieves
me to report, when he didn't even have enough for a pack of
Philip Morris—and you know how miserable that can be! To be
deprived of Philip Morris's gentle flavor, its subtly blended
tastiness, its trauma-repairing mildness, its ineffable excellence
—why, it is a prospect to break the heart in twain!
Happy Jack tried to get more money from home. He wrote
piteous and impassioned letters pointing out that the modern
large-capacity girl simply could not be maintained on his meagre
allowance. But all Jack got from home were tiresome homilies
about thrift and prudence.
Then one day a sinister sophomore came up to Jack and said,
"I know how you can get more money from home." Jack said,
"How?" and the sinister sophomore handed him a sheet of
paper. "For one dollar," said the sinister sophomore, "I will sell
you this list of fiendishly clever lies to tell your father when you
need extra money."
Jack read the list of fiendishly clever lies:
1. A bunch of lis fellotvs are getting together to buy a new
house for the Dean of Men.
2. A bunch of us fellows are getting together to buy a head
stone for Rover, our late, beloved dormitory watchdog.
3. A bunch of us fellows are getting together to buy the college
a new fullback.
4. A bunch of us fellows are getting together to endow a chair
of fine arts.
5. A bunch of us felloivs are getting together to build our own
space satellite.
For a moment, poor Jack was tempted; surely his father could
not but support all these worthy causes. Then Jack's good up
bringing came to the fore. He turned to the sinister sophomore
and said, "No, thank you. 1 could not deceive my aged parent so.
And as for you, sir, 1 can only say—Fie!"
Upon hearing this, the sinister sophomore broke into a huge
grin, lie whipped off his black hat and pasty face-and who do
you think it was? None other than Mr. Sigafoos, Happy Jack s
father, that's who!
"Good lad," cried Mr. Sigafoos. "You have passed your test
brilliantly." With that he gave Happy Jack a check for a half
million dollars and a red convertible containing four nubile
maidens.

In college Happy Jack quickly became a typical freshman
tweedy, seedy, and needy. He learned the joys of rounding out
his personality, and he learned the cost. His allowance vanished
like dew before the morning sun. There were times, it grieves
me to report, when he didn't even have enough for a pack of
Philip Morris—and you know how miserable that can be! To be
deprived of Philip Morris's gentle flavor, its subtly blended
tastiness, its trauma-repairing mildness, its ineffable excellence
—why, it is a prospect to break the heart in twain!
Happy Jack tried to get more money from home. He wrote
piteous and impassioned letters pointing out that the modern
large-capacity girl simply could not be maintained on his meagre
allowance. But all Jack got from home were tiresome homilies
about thrift and prudence.
Then one day a sinister sophomore came up to Jack and said,
"I know how you can get more money from home." Jack said,
"How?" and the sinister sophomore handed him a sheet of
paper. "For one dollar," said the sinister sophomore, "I will sell
you this list of fiendishly clever lies to tell your father when you
need extra money."
Jack read the list of fiendishly clever lies:
1. A bunch of lis fellotvs are getting together to buy a new
house for the Dean of Men.
2. A bunch of us fellows are getting together to buy a head
stone for Rover, our late, beloved dormitory watchdog.
3. A bunch of us fellows are getting together to buy the college
a new fullback.
4. A bunch of us fellows are getting together to endow a chair
of fine arts.
5. A bunch of us felloivs are getting together to build our own
space satellite.
For a moment, poor Jack was tempted; surely his father could
not but support all these worthy causes. Then Jack's good up
bringing came to the fore. He turned to the sinister sophomore
and said, "No, thank you. 1 could not deceive my aged parent so.
And as for you, sir, 1 can only say—Fie!"
Upon hearing this, the sinister sophomore broke into a huge
grin, lie whipped off his black hat and pasty face-and who do
you think it was? None other than Mr. Sigafoos, Happy Jack s
father, that's who!
"Good lad," cried Mr. Sigafoos. "You have passed your test
brilliantly." With that he gave Happy Jack a check for a half
million dollars and a red convertible containing four nubile
maidens.

THE TRUE AND TRAGICAL TALE OF
HAPPY JACK SIGAFOOS
Who would have thought that Happy Jack Sigafoos, the boy
the sky never rained on, would ever teeter on the edge of a life
of crime?
Certainly there was no sign of it in his boyhood. His home
life was most tranquil and uplifting. His mother was a nice
plump lady who hummed a lot and gave baskets to the poor. His
father was a highly respected citizen who could imitate more
than four hundred bird calls and once saved an elderly widow
from drowning in his good suit. (That is, Mr. Sigafoos was in
his good suit; the elderly widow was in swimming trunks.)

Jinppy Jack's life was nothing short of idyllic—until he went
off to college.
