# Joe Long Wins Spalding Award At Shrine Game
## 
### 
Stanford's Joe Long, who played
almost all of the game for the West
team, was named the best defensive
lineman of Saturday's East - West
Shrine game in San Francisco's
Kezar Stadium.
Long was given the Jack E. Spaul
ding Award. Previous winners have
been Carlton Massey of Texas and
Matt Hazeltine of California.
Stanford's two other players in the
annual game which the East won
easily, 29-6, expressed dissatisfac
tion with the offense taught by
Coach Jess Hill from USC.
Fullback Bill Tarr, who played
right half for the West, said: "I
thought we should have had a simple
offense. There was too much to ab
sorb in such a short time. A few
basic plays well executed are better
than a lot of stuff."
Guard Tony Mosich commented on
the length of time it took him to
learn the system: "It took us—me,
at least—lo days to learn it before
I could put it into practice. The sys
tem wasn't part of me. I couldn't
feel it. But that wasn't our down
fall. I guess we'd have lost anyhow."
Tarr carried the ball only once for
a six-yard gain.
