# 250 Undergraduate Men Will Move into New Stern Annex
## 
### 
Two hundred five undergraduate men will move into a million
dollar addition to Stern Hall today.
Two three-story wings and dining facilities were added to the

residence, nearly doubling its ca
pacity. The first units were com
pleted in 1949.
All of Stern Hall has been made
possible by gifts from the estate
of Mrs. Louis Stern, for many years
a resident of Palo Alto, who was
known affectionately as "Aunt Lu
cie" to three decades of Stanford
students. Walter A. Haas of San
Francisco is trustee of the estate.
Following the pattern of the exist
ing units, each new wing has its own
lounge with fireplace and large glass
areas opening onto courtyards. The
courts and surrounding grounds will
be landscaped when weather per
mits.
Built of reinforced concrete, the
addition comprises 53,700 square feet
of floor space. Two students will be
in each room.
Spencer and Ambrose, San Fran
cisco, were the architects and Wil
liams and Burrows, Belmont, the
contractor.
Stern Hall addition is the third
major Stanford residence project to
be completed in recent months. Cro
thers Memorial Hall for engineering
graduate students and Wilbur Hall
for freshman men were opened last
fall. Construction is under way on
Florence Moore Hall, which is to be
ready for 350 undergraduate women
next fall.
