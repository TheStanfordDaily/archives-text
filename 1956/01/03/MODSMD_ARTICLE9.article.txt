# Freshmen Flop In Panty Raid
## 
### 
Shortly before the freshmen had
their first dose of finals last month,
they decided to have their first ex
perience at a panty raid.
They could have done better, but
Wilbur Head Sponsor Jack Pike and
University officials are glad they
didn't.
The so-called "wild raid" amount
ed to little more than shouting and
milling around, according to Pike.
Very little damage v/as done and
few garments were purloined, he
said.
The frosh men breached the de
fenses of Branner and Roble only
slightly, making forays into the
laundries for an instant.
Reliable sources report that there
were loudspeakers set up, girls' legs
dangling out upstairs windows, up
per class men among the rowdy, but
very little happened.
There was no direct action taken
against the freshmen who instigated
the raid but freshman living groups
held meetings to discuss the prob
lem.
It was reported that the Branner
lawn was damaged and that a few
windows were broken at Roble.
Part of the pre-raid excitement
was generated by Stern frosh who
swiped the Christmas wreath from
Soto house in Wilbur while decoy
ing the Soto residents with fake
claims that a panty raid was in
progress.
Stern also appropriated a Christ
mas tree but returned it immediately
when they found it belonged to Mrs.
Ellene Sumner, Wilbur director.
