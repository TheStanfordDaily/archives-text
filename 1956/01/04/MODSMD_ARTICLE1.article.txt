# Cards Edge Gaels, 51-50, For 7th Win
## Missed Free Shots Almost Cost Game 
### BILL NICHOLS 
The Stanford basketball team,
which has made a habit of play
ing just hard enough to win, cut
the margin very close last night,
but managed to hang on for a
51-50 win over St. Mary's Col
lege. It was the Card cagers'
seventh straight victory.
Stanford had a seemingly safe
lead, 49-44, going into the final five
minutes, but inability from the free
throw line almost gave the contest
to the Galloping Gaels. The Indians
tried to stall out a five-point lead,
but Stanford missed five free throws,
and each time St. Mary's got the re
bound.
Finally Barry Brown got loose for
a "basket to make it 51-48, but the
visitors' Mike Wadsworth retaliated
with a jump shot with 15 seconds to
go. Bill Bond brought the ball down
and was fouled with three seconds to
play. He missed his shot and Odell
Johnson grabbed the ball, calling
time out.
The Gaels huddled around coach
Jim Weaver, while Howie Dallmar
mapped defensive strategy for his
Indians. But Stan Stewart, who put
the ball in play ,saved everybody
the trouble. He threw the ball out
of bounds under the Stanford bas
ket, nobody laying a hand on the
errant sphere.
That was the game, as the Cards
then put the ball in play.
EVEN BEGINNING
The tilt opened on a fairly even
basis. The scoring see-sawed back
and forth until Sclleck stole the ball
from Bill Bagley after a jump ball.
Sclleck,. Gary Van Galder and a
third white - shirted Indian came
down the court all alone and Van
Galder laid it up to give Stanford
a three-point lead at 12-9.
Brown, Selleck and Van Galder
then got hot and moved the score
to 21-13, but the Gaels came back
to trail by only two at the half, 29-
31.
It was Selleck who led the way
for Stanford in that first half. He
hit six shots in a row from the floor
at one point, and had 16 points at
the intermission. He also passed to
open teammates who scored four
other baskets that he was directly
responsible for.
INACCURACY SHOWING
Reliable Barry Brown tossed in
nine points to help hold the Gaels
at bay, but inaccuracy from the free
throw line was manifesting itself al
ready by halftime.
St. Mary's only made nine shots
from the floor, but hit 11 out of 14
one-pointers. The Cards had 14 from
I the floor but made only three for
seven from the foul line.
Bill "Weelo" Sanchez and John
j son, the two St. Mary's forwards,
i kept the Gaels in the game. They
j had 21 of the Moraga points, and
j Johnson was almost as deadly as
Selleck. missing only one shot in the
! period.
SLOW AND DELIBERATE
The first half seemed slow and
! deliberate, except for the shooting of
Selleck and Johnson, but the tempo,
if not the point-making, picked up
when the teams came back on the
floor.
Weaver pulled Gael center, Bill
J Getris, and put 5-9 guard Jerry
I Phillips in. Getris, who never mov'ed
1 much faster than a walk, had added
j nothing to the St. Mary's attack, and
little more to the defense, but Phil
lips was the key man in the zone
defense which slowed the Card of
fense greatly.

Stanford, playing deliberately,
pushed their lead to 47-35 with nine
minutes played in the second half,
thanks to baskets by Seileck, Brown,
Van Galder and Carl Isaacs, while
all of the Gael points came on free
throws by Johnson.
Fianlly, though. Bill Bagley swish
ed a set shot from about 25 feet out,
and the Gaels began their closing
drive, which was to carry, them so
close to victory.
Stanford brought the ball back
down, but Bond missed a free throw
and St. Mary's capitalized on the
break as Johnson cleared a Wads
worth shot. and threw it at the bas
ket as he fell of! to the left. It bounc
ed and went in to close the gap to
47-39.
FREE THROWS
Bill Flanders then made two quick
fouls sandwiched around a free
throw by .Isaacs, giving St. Mary's
four foul shots. Stewart made two,
and Johnson, who made 11 free shots
in a row before missing one, flicked
in two more.
Flanders' second miscue also forc
ed him from the game as it was his
fifth foul of the night, and Dallmar
took the opportunity to put Brown
and Seileck back in the game, with
the score now reading 48-43. There
were six minutes to play.
A free throw apiece set the stage
for the final thrilling climax.
The Gaels' Johnson led the scor
ing with 25; Seileck and
trailed with 20 and 15 respectively.
Both teams shot fairly well from
the floor—Stanford made 21 for 51
(41.1%), while the Gaels hit 13 for
40 (32.5%). But St. Mary's made up
for it. on free throws.


LAYS IT UP—Stanford's Gary Van Galder goes in for an easy
lay-up in the early stages of last night's basketball game with
St. Mary's. Looking amazed is Gael center Bill Getris.
