# Cards Edge Gaels, 51-50, For 7th Win
## Missed Free Shots Almost Cost Game 
### BILL NICHOLS 
The Stanford basketball team,
which has made a habit of play
ing just hard enough to win, cut
the margin very close last night,
but managed to hang on for a
51-50 win over St. Mary's Col
lege. It was the Card cagers'
seventh straight victory.
Stanford had a seemingly safe
lead, 49-44, going into the final five
minutes, but inability from the free
throw line almost gave the contest
to the Galloping Gaels. The Indians
tried to stall out a five-point lead,
but Stanford missed five free throws,
and each time St. Mary's got the re
bound.
Finally Barry Brown got loose for
a "basket to make it 51-48, but the
visitors' Mike Wadsworth retaliated
with a jump shot with 15 seconds to
go. Bill Bond brought the ball down
and was fouled with three seconds to
play. He missed his shot and Odell
Johnson grabbed the ball, calling
time out.
The Gaels huddled around coach
Jim Weaver, while Howie Dallmar
mapped defensive strategy for his
Indians. But Stan Stewart, who put
the ball in play ,saved everybody
the trouble. He threw the ball out
of bounds under the Stanford bas
ket, nobody laying a hand on the
errant sphere.
That was the game, as the Cards
then put the ball in play.
EVEN BEGINNING
The tilt opened on a fairly even
basis. The scoring see-sawed back
and forth until Sclleck stole the ball
from Bill Bagley after a jump ball.
Sclleck,. Gary Van Galder and a
third white - shirted Indian came
down the court all alone and Van
Galder laid it up to give Stanford
a three-point lead at 12-9.
Brown, Selleck and Van Galder
then got hot and moved the score
to 21-13, but the Gaels came back
to trail by only two at the half, 29-
31.
It was Selleck who led the way
for Stanford in that first half. He
hit six shots in a row from the floor
at one point, and had 16 points at
the intermission. He also passed to
open teammates who scored four
other baskets that he was directly
responsible for.
INACCURACY SHOWING
Reliable Barry Brown tossed in
nine points to help hold the Gaels
at bay, but inaccuracy from the free
throw line was manifesting itself al
ready by halftime.
St. Mary's only made nine shots
from the floor, but hit 11 out of 14
one-pointers. The Cards had 14 from
