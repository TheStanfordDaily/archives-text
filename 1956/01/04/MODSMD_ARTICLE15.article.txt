### STEW TOY 
Representatives of the three types
of campus men's living groups gave
freshmen a glimpse into the advan
tages of those groups on the eve of
rushing last night in Memorial Au
ditorium.
Ron Wagner represented the fra
ternity viewpoint, Bob Webster that
of the eating clubs and ASSU Presi
dent George Ralph the outlook of
the independent on the Stanford
campus.
Dean of Men William G. Craig
opened the discussion, describing
Stanford's deferred rushing system,
which gives freshmen an "opportu
nity to get their feet on the ground."
He gave freshmen this advice for
conduct during rushing: "Be objec
tive, take your time, be yourself.
And if you don't make it, it's not the
end of the world.
Intorfraternity Council President
Ron Wagner listed five advantages
of fraternity life and their "corre
sponding obligations."
Advantages, he said, are a "sense
of belonging," a place where close
friendships may be started, the chal
lenge of close day-to-day living, the
help of alumni and the opportunity
to visit fraternity chapters at other
schools.
The most important obligation,
Wagner said, is to "support frater
nity functions." He said that "what
people don't understand is that you
have an obligation to support your
fraternity."
Webster called the eating clubs a
"compromise between social organi
zation and none at all."
Eating clubs, he said, offer "small
group social organization" plus a
"degree of personal independence"â€”
an advantage which he termed the
"most important difference" between
fraternities and clubs.
The only responsibility a member
owes to his eating club, Wagner
said, is simply to "exercise his high
est potential."
Ralph, an independent, saw the
main difference between the three
systems as one of either falling into
a "ready-made group" or choosing
orie's own friends.
Under the eating club and frater
nity systems, Ralph said, one is
forced to "give up some of his in
dependence and individuality."
Ralph stressed that the rushing
freshman should above all make his
decision an individual one. "Wait a
while if you can't decide in the few
weeks of formal rushing," he said.
