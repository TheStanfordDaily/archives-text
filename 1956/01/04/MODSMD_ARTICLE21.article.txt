# here we go again

### 
Freshmen have all been wondering and
wailing. Fraternities, eating clubs, sponsors
and Mrs. Sumner have all been dreading its
arrival. Now it's here. Tonight. Rushing.
Hushing . . . which seems to embody all that
the cliche "a necessary evil" could ever hope
to mean. Rushing . . . with the vigorous hand
shake, the hearty smile, the guick tour. Rush
ing . . . with salesmanship and constant tries
at the "snow job." Rushing . . . with mounting
pressures and tensions. Rushing ... 11 days
of hell week in winter guarler.
But Ihe clubs and houses will ask, "How else
arc we going to get new members?" There's
no answer to that one. So we have rushing.
And so we have to try to live with it.
The point is that we don't live with it very
well. The week and a half of "being on your

best behavior" becomes a strain. The need to
pledge—and pledge now—and the need to be
pledged becomes almost an obsession. When
it really isn't. That the marriage must follow
so soon after the first meeting causes the slrain
and the pressure.
We urge both the freshmen and the clubs
and houses not to be overwhelmed by the
seeming urgency. Don't panic. The decisions
are conseguential, but not all-important.
The decision probably should be made dur
ing formal pushing, but the freshmen should
not fesl compelled to decide. Nor should the
clubs or fraternities feel compelled to fill their
pledge class next week. Rushing would be a
much more pleasant event without its pres
sures.
At any rate, it won't last forever.
