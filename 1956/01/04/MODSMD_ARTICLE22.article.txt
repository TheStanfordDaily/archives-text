The big news on the University of Washing
ton campus concerns the rehiring of head foot
ball coach Johnny Cherberg.
On Dec. 10 the Board of Regents decided to
keep the controversial Cherberg for another
year. However, the decision bucked the will
of the student government and many of the
players on the football team.
The whole situation, which the Washington
Daily termed "revolting," developed when the
majority of the starting eleven objected to
methods Cherberg had used during the season,
complaining that he overworked them and was
unusually harsh in many instances.
When the players took their complaints to
the administration, the coach denied the
charges and an assistant coach was fired.
A parley between the rebelling players and
the coach was canceled for the reason that
"nothing could be gained" and the situation
should be taken out of the hands of the players
and Cherberg.
A student public opinion poll conducted by
the Washington Daily showed that G5 per cent
cf the students were behind the football rebels
who brought their grievances to Athletic Di
rector Harvey Cassill.
At the annual football banguet Coach Cher
berg told reporters that he was going to "hang
lough." The next Wednesday morning a
dummy of Cherberg was found from
the top of the 125-foot flagpole near the admin
istration building. A sign was attached to the
effigy advising "Hang Tough, Cowboy." It
was Cherberg's third effigy hanging.
Those responsible for the hanging had man
aged to jam the flagpole pulley which made it
very difficult to remove the dummy.
On Dec. 7 the ASUW Board of Control voted
12 to 2 to go on record opposing the rehiring cf
Johnny Cherberg as football coach. "I feel the
decision is in keeping with the opinion of a
majority of the student body," ASUW presi
dent Frank Gustin declared.
However, the regents rehired Cherberg for
another year, much to the surprise of many at
the university. The majority of the protesting
players are graduating seniors, so it was felt
that Cherberg had a good chance to straighten
out his difficulties.

They are having difficulties of another na
ture at Columbia. *
A crime wave is occurring on campus with
thieves burglarizing office buildings, dormito

ries and fraternity houses. The Zeta Beta Tau
fraternity reported that over $1500 worth of
typewriters, phonographs, suits and other
articles of clothing had been stolen during
Thanksgiving vacation.
However, police believe they have a key to
the thefts which began last summer. A janitor
employed by the Residence Halls of Columbia
University was recently apprehended on a
check forgery charge. The man was found with
20 pawn tickets, most of them representing
articles of clothing. Campus police are now
checking to see if the shifty janitor has ab
sconded with any of the zoot suits of the fra
ternity men.

At the University of Connecticut they are â– 
still talking about the near-riots staged by al
most all the fraternities during Homecoming
Week.
Nine fraternities have already been sus
pended for the resi of the semester and charges
against a 10th were dropped because of insuf
ficient evidence. The charge was illegal pos
session of liquor. The remaining fraternities
have been limited to three social functions per
house for the rest of the semester.
Action is also being planned against the}
women's dormitories for the encouragement
many of the female residents gave during the i
mass Nov. 8 panty raid.

7'he Wampus, the University of Southern
California humor magazine, has won a long !
fight for recognition.
By a recent 23-to-3 vote the ASSC Senate
gave student sanction to the magazine.
In a prior Senate meeting the proposal was
voted down, but the proposal was re-submitted
by the chairman of the Board of Publications.
The proposal not to endorse the magazine was
thrown out, because magazine editor Arnold
Dierfer was net given a chance to speak in the
Wampus's behalf.
The Wampus will remain a self-supporting
publication. All losses are to be borne by the
staff of the Wampus.

San lose State has decided to remodel its
football stadium. A complete new lighting sys
tem will be installed in Spartan Stadium. Night
football games will now be played under three
times as much light, thanks to the $37,000 ex
penditure.
