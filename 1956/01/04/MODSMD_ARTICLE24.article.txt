# THE 						COURT-MARTIAL OF BILLY MITCHELL'
## Gary Cooper, Fine Supporting Cast Make Military Drama a Good Film 
### RIC TEAGUE 
Biily Mitchell was an Ameri
j can general who commanded
: the Army Air Service (later to
become the Air Corps and fi- 1
nally the Air Fcrce).
Gary Cooper is an American
movie a:-tor who has been, from time
to time, a cowboy, an infantry ser
geant, a New York Yankee first
baseman and a member of the
French Foreign Legion.
A combination of the two is coui t
martiabd in CinemaScope nightly at
the Varsity Theater for the benefit

lof local movie
! goers. And it's an
awfully good
movie — "The
Court - Martial of
Billy Mitchell."
Cooper is always
Cooper no matter
who he's playing,
but he is
ing as the stub-

born Mitchell who knocked himself
out trying to get recognition for the
military importance of the airplane
until, driven by exasperation at
hide-bound brass, lie charged the
War and Navy departments with
"incompetence, criminal ncgligence
and almost treasonable administra
tion."
Lots of soldiers have criticized

their superiors but not in the news
papers. The Army's case simple
—did or did not Mitchell make those
charges? The court-martial found
that he did.
Near the opening of th* film, the
wide CinemaScope screen gets a last
laugh at its many collegiate critics
as it combines with excellent pho
tography >to .'how several scenes of
early flying, a crash landing and
Gsneral Mitchell's sensational bomb
ing—for demonstration—of a cap
tured German battleship which had
been thought unsinkable.
A hot of fine supporting actors
carry large parts % of "Court-Mar
tial." Ralph Bellamy, as a congress
man friend, defended Mitchell in the
trial and did a beautiful job. Fred
Clark (Stanford, '35) presented the
Army's case until he was relieved in

the late innings by Rod Steiger who
made (he audience hate him as he !
cross-examined Mitchell.
Herbert Heyes was perfect as Gen
eral John (Blackjack) Pershing and
looked just like him. In fact, make
up was excellent on all the real per
sons the reviewer has seen pictures
of. Mac Arthur, Arnold, Coolidge, et
a!., looked very close to the original
article.
The weakest link in the cast was
the use of the very good young ac
tress Elizabeth Montgomery as the
Navy widow who was a friend of
Mitchell and testified for him in the
court-martial. She was too sweet
and pretty for the part.
All in all, "Court-Martial" is a j
good effort on the part of Warner
Eros. Milton Sterling and Emmett
Lavery turned out a great screen
play and the CinemaScope was used
to the best advantage.
And Cooper was Cooper.

Near the opening of th* film, the
wide CinemaScope screen gets a last
laugh at its many collegiate critics
as it combines with excellent pho
tography >to .'how several scenes of
early flying, a crash landing and
Gsneral Mitchell's sensational bomb
ing—for demonstration—of a cap
tured German battleship which had
been thought unsinkable.
A hot of fine supporting actors
carry large parts % of "Court-Mar
tial." Ralph Bellamy, as a congress
man friend, defended Mitchell in the
trial and did a beautiful job. Fred
Clark (Stanford, '35) presented the
Army's case until he was relieved in

the late innings by Rod Steiger who
made (he audience hate him as he !
cross-examined Mitchell.
Herbert Heyes was perfect as Gen
eral John (Blackjack) Pershing and
looked just like him. In fact, make
up was excellent on all the real per
sons the reviewer has seen pictures
of. Mac Arthur, Arnold, Coolidge, et
a!., looked very close to the original
article.
The weakest link in the cast was
the use of the very good young ac
tress Elizabeth Montgomery as the
Navy widow who was a friend of
Mitchell and testified for him in the
court-martial. She was too sweet
and pretty for the part.
All in all, "Court-Martial" is a j
good effort on the part of Warner
Eros. Milton Sterling and Emmett
Lavery turned out a great screen
play and the CinemaScope was used
to the best advantage.
And Cooper was Cooper.

Biily Mitchell was an Ameri
j can general who commanded
: the Army Air Service (later to
become the Air Corps and fi- 1
nally the Air Fcrce).
Gary Cooper is an American
movie a:-tor who has been, from time
to time, a cowboy, an infantry ser
geant, a New York Yankee first
baseman and a member of the
French Foreign Legion.
A combination of the two is coui t
martiabd in CinemaScope nightly at
the Varsity Theater for the benefit

lof local movie
! goers. And it's an
awfully good
movie — "The
Court - Martial of
Billy Mitchell."
Cooper is always
Cooper no matter
who he's playing,
but he is
ing as the stub-

born Mitchell who knocked himself
out trying to get recognition for the
military importance of the airplane
until, driven by exasperation at
hide-bound brass, lie charged the
War and Navy departments with
"incompetence, criminal ncgligence
and almost treasonable administra
tion."
Lots of soldiers have criticized

their superiors but not in the news
papers. The Army's case simple
—did or did not Mitchell make those
charges? The court-martial found
that he did.
