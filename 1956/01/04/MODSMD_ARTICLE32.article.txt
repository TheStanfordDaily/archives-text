# MSU Team Rests After Bowl Win; Kaiser in Hiding
## 
### 
I LOS ANGELES, Jan. 3 (U.R)—The
triumphant Michigan Stats team
rested in the sun today—at least as
much as it could with so many ad
mirers swarming around.
A phone call to the Spartan head
quarters at the Huntington-Sheraton
Hotel in Pasadena, asking for Kaiser,
brought this response from a secre
tary:
"I have been on the telephone all
day talking to reporters and other
persons who wanted to talk to Kai
ser. If he talked to all the people
who want to talk to him, he wouldn't
get any rest. In fact, he would be
driven completely crazy!"
