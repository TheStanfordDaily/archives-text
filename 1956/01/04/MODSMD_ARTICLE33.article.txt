# Former Card Rower Trains For Olympics
## 
### 
Navy Lieutenant (junior
grade) James T. Fifer, former
Stanford University varsity
crew member, is now in train
ing for the Olympic rowing
trials, it was announced by the
U.S. Naval Air Station at Quon
set Point recently.
Fifer, an oarsman in the 1952
Olympic Games at Helsinki, Finland,
began his rowing career at Stanford
in 1948 with the freshman crew. He
spent his final three years at Stan
ford on the varsity crew.
Duvall Hecht, a crewmate of Fi
fer's at Stanford and in the Helsinki
Games, is in training with Fifer at
Sanford, Fla.
Fifer and Hecht, along with Jim
Beggs, present coach of the fresh
man rowing crew at the University
of Pennsylvania, financed their 1952
Helsinki trip themselves, since the
Olympics is not an event in which
colleges compete. The thi*ee bought
a boat from a shell builder in Se
attle. Washington, George Pocock,
at a personal expense of $1000.
Their extensive preparations and
training paid off in Helsinki, how
ever, for their races proved two of
the closest of the games. They won
the first race against Belgium, Swe
den and Russia, only to lose the sec
ond to an Italian crew and the semi
final race by three feet to a German
crew which, on the next day, lost by
a length-and-a-half to the victorious
French crew.
Fifer is the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Lester Z. Fifer of Tacoma, Wash,
