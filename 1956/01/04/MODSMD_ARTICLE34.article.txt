## Luisetti Blasts 'Racehorse' Basketballers 
### 
Stanford's contribution to the bas
ketball world, Hank Luisetti, re
cently authored an article in a na
tional sport magazine entitled "Race
horse Basketball Stinks."
Luisetti, member of the Pacific
Coast Conference All-Southern Di
vision teams in 1936, 1 y37 and 1938,
denounced today's basketball as hav
ing only two rules: "one, to collect
five players who have the physical
stamina to jackrabbit up and down
the court for 40 minutes; two, to
give the player who wins the race
to the opponents' end of the court
the privilege of throwing a penny
in the wishing well."
The former coach of the Stewart
Chevrolet AAU team, who has oper
ated a basketball clinic in San Fran
cisco for the past ten years, blasted
rulesmakers and coaches for "legis
lating common sense out of the
game" and "teaching youngsters that
shooting is all that counts."
Luisetti, whose last record was
broken by Ron Tomsic last year,
emphasized that he wasn't trying to
be "sour grapes," but said that de
emphasizing defense took enjoyment
out of the game for the players.
