## 
### 
UCLA head basketball coach
Johnny Wooden rated USF "among
the best in recent years" yesterday,
after arriving back from New York i
where his Bruins were defeated by ■
the Dons.
"We enjoyed Monday (when we
beat St. John's) and Wednesday
(when we beat Duquesne)," said i
Wooden. "Then we ruined every
thing by playing USF on Friday." j
USF meets Pepperdine next, and
Wave Coach Duck Dowell isn't op- J
timistic about the contest.
"I've heard coaches say they re
spect, but do not fear, opponents," j
said Dowell. "We not only respect
but wo fear USF."
