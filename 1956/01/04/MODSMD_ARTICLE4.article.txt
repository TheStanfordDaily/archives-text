# AFTER 65 YEARS
## Encina, Dorm Since 1891, Abandoned by Roomers 
### 
Two hundred five undergraduate men yesterday completed the
great exodus from Encina Hall, hallowed home of Stanford men
for more than 60 years, to the new and smaller—but efficient—
rooms of the recently completed Stern Hall annex.
The move left Encina a sandstone shell of its former being, its
ornate windows dark for probably „ ,

the first time since the old dorm was
built in 1891.
Encin.a\s spacious rooms and foot
thick walls have seen their last
group of men residents until the
dorm is rebuilt from the inside.
The first floor of the building is
now occupied by University offices.
A far cry from Encina, the new
Stern addition is a modern building
of reinforced concrete, its rooms
boasting such improvements as built
in closets, drawers, bookcases and
medicine cabinets, and individual in
tercommunication units.
The addition, as well as the origi- !
nal units of Stern Hall, built in 1949,
were made possible by gifts from the
estate of Mrs. Louis Stern of Palo
Alto.
Each of the new wings has its own
lounge with fireplace and large glass
areas opening onto courtyards. The
counts and surrounding grounds are
to be landscaped when weather per
mits.
A large recreation room is planned
for the basement of the new build- {
ing, for which Stern Club has bought
a color television set and several re
freshment machines.
Each floor of the new wings has
its own study room.
A new apartment Tor Mrs. Hen
derson has been built on the first i
floor of Wing Six, numbered (iOl.
Her office remains in Room 201. .
Due to the recent heavy rains the
new parking lot at the rear of the
addition has not been completed. It
will be finished as soon as possible,
according to Mrs. Henderson.
Architects for the addition were
Spencer and Ambrose of San Fran
cisco. Williams and Burrows, of
Belmont, were the contmotors.
