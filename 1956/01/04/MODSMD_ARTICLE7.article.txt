Stanford's experiment in land de
velopment as an answer to the baf
fling financial problems of a large
private university is "no ivory-tower
dream for the future," according to
Falcon O. Baker in his Dec. 31 Sat
urday Evening Post article, "City on
the Campus."
Baker in his article deals with the
reasons for the University's financial
pinch following World War 11, the
solution that Business Manager Alf
Brarfdin and other University offi
cials found in the land development
program, and its current' manifesta
tion in new residential areas, indus
trial and business sites.
When ftJunded, Baker writes, Stan
ford's endowment, was more than
the combined endowments of Har
vard, Yale, Princeton and Columbia,
but following the last war the Uni
versity found itself caught between
sharply rising costs and a relatively
fixed income.
Brandin, with the help of real es
tate expert Colbert Coldwell and
John Cushing, member of the Board
of Trustees, launched the develop
ment program that has attracted
such firms as Varian Associates,
Eastman Kodak and General Electric
;>nd 50 stores in the new $15,000,000
shopping center.
In drawing up the blueprints for
this model city, Stanford's land de
velopers encountered hearty oppo
sition from some loyal alumni and
fearful local merchants.
Companies have sought the Stan
ford location, Baker said, because of
its attractive climate, the intellectual
environment and the academic tie-in
affording opportunities for scientists
to take advanced courses at the Uni
versity.
