# Reg Figures Exceed Last Year by 270
## Ratio Looks Worse For Male Students 
### 
Winter quarter enrollment,
expected to be the highest for
five years, exceeded last win-,
ter quarter's figures for the first
day by 270 yesterday.
A total of 6303 students filed
through the lines at Memorial Audi
torium and the Pavilion to turn in
their registration books. Last year
the corresponding number was 6333.
The ratio this year is worse, the
4848 men would say. Whereas last
year there was one woman for every
2.53 male students, this year 2.76
men have to compete for one wom
an. There are 1755 woman students
enrolled.
An unusually large number of stu
dents crowded the registration lines
in the last few hours of the day, after
the alphabetical schedule had run its
course. Many of those who picked
up their books then could not com
plete registration in time to turn
them in and were therefore not
counted in first day totals.
A fee of $2 will be assessed those
students who turn in their reg books
today and the rest of the week.
Starting Monday, the fee will be $10.
Students have almost two weeks
to turn in their study cards and the
class enrollment cards which each
instructor gives his classes.
