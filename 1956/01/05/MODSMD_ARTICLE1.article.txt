## Three Professors Give Forecasts for U.S. in '56 Housing Automobile Industries Decline Predicted This Year 
### JIM PALMER 
America's booming economy j
will face a decline in 1956 with!
the automobile and housing
industries leading the "slow
down," forecasts Stanford eco- 1
nomics professor Lorie Tarshis. J
"The economy is in a brittle con
dition and will require very careful
policy formation during the coming
year," declared the eminent econo
mist in an interview with The Daily
yesterday.
"We are almost at a point where
a little push can cause a deflationary
problem. We haven't licked the
problem of depression, and we are
not as welf equipped to handle the
kind of depression that could be j
brought about today as some people
think we are."
SLOW DOWN
The slow down, Tarshis believes,
will come during the second half
of the year and will be seen espe
cially in cuts in the "over-expanded"
auto industry and in the declining
housing tie Id.
"Income tax reduction is rather
likely, but should not go into effect
until the business slow down comes."
Tax change is particularly immi- j
nent since 1956 is election year, and
there is strong agreement for it |
among tax subcommittee members
in Congress.
He sees, however, not much effect
on the economy from election re
sults. "Neither political considera
tions nor out-of-date economics will
enter strongly into the formation of
policy," he stated.
AUTHOR
Tarshis, who came to Stanford in
1946 after serving on the Joint Board
of Economic Warfare in Washington,
D.C.. is author of "Elements of Ac
counts" and a contributor of numer
ous magazine articles and to a book
"Saving American Capitalism."
He has recently returned from a
research project in Europe and last
summer served on a five-man staff
of the American Studies Seminar at
the University of Tokyo sponsored
by the Rockefeller Foundation.
He compares the present situation
to that in 1953-54 when a slow down
fet in. As then, he believes that
"fortuitous Congressional policy"
and credit policy implementation
will help to counterbalance the de
cline.
NO DEPRESSION
"A lot of elements still make for
inflationary pressures, and we still
have a very substantial policy of ex
pansion." Thus there will be no
large-scale depression during 1956,
Tarshis asserted.
"The 16 per cent cut ordered by
General Motors President Curtice
indicates the slow down coming in
autos. I believe it will probably be
greater than that.
"Credit controls will move in the
opposite direction from the tighten
ing they have been receiving.
A $10 billion increase in gross na
tional produce will occur, I hope, or
else there will be an increase in the
growing problem of unemployment,
which is too big even now."
The boom will continue in certain
segments of the economy, he points
out. "Machine tools, the steel in
dustry and electronics, among others,
should all do quite well in 1956."

AUTHOR
Tarshis, who came to Stanford in
1946 after serving on the Joint Board
of Economic Warfare in Washington,
D.C.. is author of "Elements of Ac
counts" and a contributor of numer
ous magazine articles and to a book
"Saving American Capitalism."
He has recently returned from a
research project in Europe and last
summer served on a five-man staff
of the American Studies Seminar at
the University of Tokyo sponsored
by the Rockefeller Foundation.
He compares the present situation
to that in 1953-54 when a slow down
fet in. As then, he believes that
"fortuitous Congressional policy"
and credit policy implementation
will help to counterbalance the de
cline.
NO DEPRESSION
"A lot of elements still make for
inflationary pressures, and we still
have a very substantial policy of ex
pansion." Thus there will be no
large-scale depression during 1956,
Tarshis asserted.
"The 16 per cent cut ordered by
General Motors President Curtice
indicates the slow down coming in
autos. I believe it will probably be
greater than that.
"Credit controls will move in the
opposite direction from the tighten
ing they have been receiving.
A $10 billion increase in gross na
tional produce will occur, I hope, or
else there will be an increase in the
growing problem of unemployment,
which is too big even now."
The boom will continue in certain
segments of the economy, he points
out. "Machine tools, the steel in
dustry and electronics, among others,
should all do quite well in 1956."
America's booming economy j
will face a decline in 1956 with!
the automobile and housing
industries leading the "slow
down," forecasts Stanford eco- 1
nomics professor Lorie Tarshis. J
"The economy is in a brittle con
dition and will require very careful
policy formation during the coming
year," declared the eminent econo
mist in an interview with The Daily
yesterday.
"We are almost at a point where
a little push can cause a deflationary
problem. We haven't licked the
problem of depression, and we are
not as welf equipped to handle the
kind of depression that could be j
brought about today as some people
think we are."
SLOW DOWN
The slow down, Tarshis believes,
will come during the second half
of the year and will be seen espe
cially in cuts in the "over-expanded"
auto industry and in the declining
housing tie Id.
"Income tax reduction is rather
likely, but should not go into effect
until the business slow down comes."
Tax change is particularly immi- j
nent since 1956 is election year, and
there is strong agreement for it |
among tax subcommittee members
in Congress.
He sees, however, not much effect
on the economy from election re
sults. "Neither political considera
tions nor out-of-date economics will
enter strongly into the formation of
policy," he stated.
