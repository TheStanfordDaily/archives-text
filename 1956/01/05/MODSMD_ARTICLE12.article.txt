# Coalition Move Made by Faure
## 
### 
PARlSâ€”Caretaker Premier Edgar
Fauie today invited his bitter rival,
Pierre Mendes-France, to join him
in a coalition of moderates and "save
the republic" from Left and Right
wing extremists.
Faure failed to say whether he
wants to make up personally with
Mendes, once his best friend. But he
frankly admitted he had little hope
of continuing as premier of the next
government to be established by the
new General Assembly.
