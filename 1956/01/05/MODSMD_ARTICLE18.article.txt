# 'not in'
## 
### 
We know we've mentioned it before. But as
long as the problem exists, we'll continue to
mention it.
You can see by the picture above that the
Bo iksicre is in its quarterly dilemma. Texts by
I'i'■ following authors ary "not in." Ironically,
those missing texts are usually required for
courses with reading assignments due imme
diately.
To the student, the potential customer, the
problem is simply ono. of no bcoks. In his
mind, it'« the Bookstore's fault.
And in. many cases, the Bookstore is to
blarne. Insufficient books have been ordered;'
books have been ordered too late; often the
number of books ordered by the instructor is
drastically cut.
In addition, the Bookstore does not help its
r uise in this field because discourteous service
and an inadequate general' book department
incur such displeasure.
But the lack of texts at critical moments is

not the result of Bookstore deficiencies only.
Many of the Bookstore's orders for texts are
slow in arriving, and the Bookstore can't do
anything about it (except, possibly, to order
earlier).
The faculty, too, is often negligent. They
misjudge the number of books that are re
quired; they don't submit their requests early
enough.
Another contributing factor is the crowding
and cramping in the Bookstore. There just isn't
enough room in the existing building to oper
ate a bookstore as it should be operated. That
is the University's responsibility. They have
plans . . .
We do not have a solution to advance. How
ever, we feel that a solution be found,
and could be if the University, Bookstore, and
faculty work together.
And there must be a temporary solution be
fore the Bookstore's space is enlarged. The
students should not have to face the same old
problem every quarter.
