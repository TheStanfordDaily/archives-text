Regardless of party affiliation, most Ameri
can political figures agree that foreign policy
must not be strangled by partisan bickering,
realizing that strength and success in the field
of diplomacy can be achieved only if there is
an aura of unity and co-operation among gov
ernment leaders.
It was from this realization that the tradition
of bipartisan foreign policy grew.
But bipartisanship in foreign policy is cur
rently being twisted and warped by many Re
publican leaders into a protective shield with
which to hide themselves from Democratic crit
icism.
Fearful of criticism damaging to their party,
these leaders have expressed hopes (in the
name of bipartisanship) that the question of for
eign policy would not % enter the '56 Democratic
campaign.
but, ask many thoughtful political leaders,
are policies so vital to our very existence to
qo unquestioned when they appear to one
party of the "foreign policy coalition" to be er
roneous, weak and ill-formed?
An open debate exposing the failures of past
policy and offering new solutions to old un
solved problems indeed seems more profitable
than plodding along making more mistakes
and more enemies.
If criticism is of a constructive nature, what
time could be better for a thought-provoking
debate than that preceding a national election
when the issues will be vividly set before the
American people, affording them an opportu
nity to decide the paths American diplomacy is
! o take.
A study and discussion of our policies
abroad need not imply negativism and mud
si iiiging.
By assuming the privilege, or right, of chal

lenging the Republican administration in this
field, Democratic critics must assume the addi
tional responsibility of preventing damage to
our international position.
Many Democratic leaders, remembering
such Republican campaign outcries as "sellout
at Yalta" and "twenty years of treason," have
called for moderation in foreign policy discus
sions that will impress the world with our
awareness of past mistakes but yet assure it
that our goals of co-operation for world peace
remain the same.
There is little doubt that foreign policy will
be debated. To use Mr. Dulles' oft-quoted
phrase, there is a loud call for an "agonizing
reappraisal" in the handling of American for
eign policy.
Since the exuberancy of the Geneva spirit
has been snuffed, it has become increasingly
apparent that the United States is without a
policy in such vital areas as the Near East and
the Far East.
The Soviet Union is grabbing the diplomatic
initiative in offering military, economic and
technical assistance to areas that we have
blandly supposed to be within our orbit of in
fluence.
Meanwhile the Administration is caught be
tween the forces of President Eisenhower driv
ing for an increase in foreign spending and
those of Secretary of the Treasury Humphrey,
Budget Director Hughes and economic aid ad
ministrator John Hollister, a group valuing for
eign aid as secondary to a balanced budget.
A dynamic foreign policy is critically
needed, and if Democratic leaders have con
structive suggestions to offer, they should not
be silenced by Republican pleas of bipartisan
ship.
It is only right that partners in a policy
should have a voice in its formation.

If criticism is of a constructive nature, what
time could be better for a thought-provoking
debate than that preceding a national election

A study and discussion of our policies
abroad need not imply negativism and mud
si iiiging.
By assuming the privilege, or right, of chal

lenging the Republican administration in this
field, Democratic critics must assume the addi
tional responsibility of preventing damage to
our international position.
Many Democratic leaders, remembering
such Republican campaign outcries as "sellout
at Yalta" and "twenty years of treason," have
called for moderation in foreign policy discus
sions that will impress the world with our
awareness of past mistakes but yet assure it
that our goals of co-operation for world peace
remain the same.
There is little doubt that foreign policy will
be debated. To use Mr. Dulles' oft-quoted
phrase, there is a loud call for an "agonizing
reappraisal" in the handling of American for
eign policy.
Since the exuberancy of the Geneva spirit
has been snuffed, it has become increasingly
apparent that the United States is without a
policy in such vital areas as the Near East and
the Far East.
The Soviet Union is grabbing the diplomatic
initiative in offering military, economic and
technical assistance to areas that we have
blandly supposed to be within our orbit of in
fluence.
Meanwhile the Administration is caught be
tween the forces of President Eisenhower driv
ing for an increase in foreign spending and
those of Secretary of the Treasury Humphrey,
Budget Director Hughes and economic aid ad
ministrator John Hollister, a group valuing for
eign aid as secondary to a balanced budget.
A dynamic foreign policy is critically
needed, and if Democratic leaders have con
structive suggestions to offer, they should not
be silenced by Republican pleas of bipartisan

It is only right that partners in a policy
should have a voice in its formation.
Regardless of party affiliation, most Ameri
can political figures agree that foreign policy
must not be strangled by partisan bickering,
realizing that strength and success in the field
of diplomacy can be achieved only if there is
an aura of unity and co-operation among gov
ernment leaders.
It was from this realization that the tradition
of bipartisan foreign policy grew.
But bipartisanship in foreign policy is cur
rently being twisted and warped by many Re
publican leaders into a protective shield with
which to hide themselves from Democratic crit
icism.
Fearful of criticism damaging to their party,
these leaders have expressed hopes (in the
name of bipartisanship) that the question of for
eign policy would not % enter the '56 Democratic
campaign.
but, ask many thoughtful political leaders,
are policies so vital to our very existence to
qo unquestioned when they appear to one
party of the "foreign policy coalition" to be er
roneous, weak and ill-formed?
An open debate exposing the failures of past
policy and offering new solutions to old un
solved problems indeed seems more profitable
than plodding along making more mistakes
and more enemies.
