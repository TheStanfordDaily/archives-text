vole of thanks
To the Editor:
The Eating Clubs deserve, I think, a hearty vote
of thanks from all of us for opening their halls on a
rushing night to permit ihe dinner meeting, sponsored
by Sequoia magazine, at which Dr. Margery Bailey
is to speak.
It L-> unusual for an undergraduate social activity
to make room for an undergraduate intellectual ac
tivity, and the iael that the Eating Clubs did not con

sider Dr. Bailey's talk to be in competition with their
normal functioning but rather an advertisement and
enhancement of it speaks very well for the spirit
animating the Eating Clubs and the philosophy by
which they operate.
They have agreed to postpone rushing on the night
of January 7 until eight-thirty. It is a gesture that
ought not to go unrecognized.
