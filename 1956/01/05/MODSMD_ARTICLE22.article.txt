# 'Can-Can' Is Imaginative, Entertaining Production
## Musical Combines Stale Craftsmanship With Refreshing, Enthusiastic Eroticism 
### RICHARD MENDE 
One can lodge serious complaints against Messrs. Cole Porter
and Abe Burrows for their collaborative musical "Can-Can" but
one cannot walk away from the Curran Theater's production with
out the feeling that one has been generously and graciously en
tertained. The charm of the evening is supplied by the choreo-

graphic artistry of Michael Kidd, the
effervescence of Rita Dimitri as Pis
tache, and a certain jovial eroticism
that pervades the atmosphere.
Aiong with these are sundry dis
tinguished talents such as Jo Miel
ziner's set designs and Motley's lav
ish and imaginative costumes.
Perhaps it is best to dispatch with
Mister Burrows' book first. The plot
ting was surprisingly inept with plot
and sub-plot competing rather than
complementing one another.
CHARACTERS
The characters were standard, col
orless caricatures supplied with hu
mor that was probably not over
whelming for the period in which
the show was set, Montmartre, circa
1893.
But the Bulgarian sculptor was
reasonably comic especially with
George Irving inhabiting the role.
And a semi-naked model, who had
delightfully little to do with the
t;tory, brightened the festivities.
Which might bring us to Cole Por
ter. None of the music in "Can-Can"
is bad or even displeasing but it
echoes with tunes created in Mr.
Porter's greener years. In fairness,
"Allez-Vous-En" was vigorous and
Rita Dimitri singing "I Love Paris"
stopped the show.
BLBBLING
Miss Dimitri docs not seem espe
cially Gallic but she is bubbling
enough and in some scenes totally
captivating. Like when, as a dance
hall mistress afraid of having her
place closed because of the "licen
tious" can-can, she leans the judge
back in a long languorous kiss and
then asks, "Now what about the
license?"
The Garden of Eden, scene perhaps
incorporated more artistry than any
thing else in the show. It was a
choreographic number illustrating
the theme of the show, the dangers
of censorship, by revealing the "dis
astrous" effects of Eve's knowledge
after the forbidden apple has been
tasted.
It was imaginatively erotic as was
the Apache number.
APPLAUSE
The sets twice received a burst of
applause which was fair enough be
cause there were two outstanding
sets among many competent ones.
The evening was an odd combina
tion of stale, tired craftsmanship and
original, refreshing talent.
