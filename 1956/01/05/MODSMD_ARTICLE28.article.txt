# SAE's Smash Beta Biz, 39-0, To Win Mural Football Crown
## 
### 
SAE I walloped Beta Biz, 39-0, to win the intramural football
championship during last quarter's competition.
The SAE's showed a sensational aerial game with tailback
Ray Young doing most of the throwing. Young passed for all six
touchdowns, hitting Bob Dwight and Jim Luttrell twice each and

Bernie Nelson and Ray Williamson
once apiece.
Young's crisp passing made the
game fast. He repeatedly hit his
speedy ends, Luttrell and Nelson,
and halfback Dwight who made sev
eral outstanding catches.
Biz School displayed a spotty of
fense as the alert SAE defense inter
cepted six passes. Two of the inter
ceptions stopped drives inside the
SAE 10-yard Line.
SAE's defensive line of Nelson,
Jack Adams and Tom Watson did a
good job of pressuring Biz School
passer Bruce Murphy. The SAE de
fensive backfield, composed of Ron
McDiarmid, Jack Van Bergen,
Dwight and Young, also played fine
ball.
Young nailed Dwight for the first
touchdown and then followed with
two scoring heaves to Luttrell.
Young then kept the score mounting
with touchdown passes to William
sen, Nelson and Dwight again.
The Beta Biz defensive line did
not apply much pressure on Young,
thus giving him plenty of time to
spot his receivers.
Bob Thee looked good for Biz
School at his defensive halfback po-

sition and end Jack Dodds made
several fine receptions.
Other members of SAE's cham
pionship team were Mac Smith,
Hugh Johnson and Dave Edson.
