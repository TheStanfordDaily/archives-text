# Political Scientists Foresee Stevenson As Demo Candidate
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
A Democratic ticket led by Ad
lai Stevenson in the November
elections was predicted yester
day by political science profes
sors Hubert Marshall and Thom
as Barclay.
Marshall gives "slight odds" that
President Eisenhower will lead the
GOP in November. '"He is quite loy-

al to his party, and if he delays
much longer he will not be giving his
party a good chance."
On the presumption that Eisen
hower runs, Marshall predicts a Ste
venson victory unless a strong Vice-
Presidential candidate is ploposed.
VICE-PRESIDENT
More attention, he said, will be
paid the Vice-President than even
before if Eisenhower accepts the
GOP bid, adding that "it might well
be a race between the Vice-Presi
dential candidate and Stevenson.
If Eisenhower announces that he
will not run again, Marshall said, his
control over the present Congress
will diminish. As a candidate he can
control many patronage - seeking
Congressmen whose votes on im
portant legislation he might lose
were he not the party's candidate.
Observing that Stevenson appears
to be currently in the lead for the
Democratic nod, Barclay, an expert
in political parties, bases his predic
tion on the fact that the candidate's
"preconvention camp is ably directed
and adequately financed and that
Stevenson has the support of many
leaders in the Democratnc party."
TOUGH ROAD
Turning to issues, Barclay foresaw
a tough road ahead for the Demo
crats who will find it difficult "to
propose a satisfactory alternate to
the program unless
there is a change in economic con
ditions.
On the subject of suggested tax
cuts, both professors foresee the
Congress bending to political pres
sure and providing voters with mod
est tax reductions.
"They must do something for per
sons in the lower income brackets,"
Marshall said, and he speculated that
Congress may raise personal exemp- i
tions from $(>OO to $700 to balance the
reductions corporations and upper
bracket incomes have received.
NOT GOAL
This would not lead to the Ad
ministration's goal of a balanced j
budget, but Congress might help
counteract tax reductions, Marshall
commented, by plugging loopholes
in tax laws affecting corporations
and higher incomes.
The two professors disagree on
the potential success of President
Eisenhower's proposals for an in
crease in foreign aid.
Marshall believes that appropria
tions will increase somewhat, al
though expenditures will remain j
virtually the same.
The increased appropriations will
go into the depleted "carry - over
fund" to be used for long - range
projects. Their effect will not be
felt in the coming fiscal year.
Barclay contended that "Congress
will be very reluctant to increase ex
penditures in foreign aid, especially
in the non-military field. This op
position will come from important j
Congressmen in both parties."
FARM PROBLEM
It is the farm problem that Bar- !
clay views as the "most dangerous
issue confronting the Republicans."
"The Democrats," he said, "will
exploit this issue and promise agri
cultural states a return to earlier
policies which are responsible, in
considerable measure, for the pres
ent agricultural situation.
Marshall believes that the present
Congress will attempt to do some
thing for the farmer in the form of
a bill specifying continued flexible
price supports but with a "soil bank
scheme," removing land from pro
duction for conservation purposes
providing a "degree of subsidy with
out being offensive."
