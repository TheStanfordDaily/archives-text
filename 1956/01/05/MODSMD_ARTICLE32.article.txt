# Mural Basketball Signup Lists Must Be Completed Tomorrow
## 
### 
Signups are posted for intra
mural basketball teams and lists
must be in tomorrow according
to Elwyn Bugge, intramural' di
rector.
Intramural basketball has consist
ently been one of the most popular
intramural sports. One year, in fact,
81(5 contestants played on 102 teams
in 17 leagues.
Official cage rules will apply, with
these exceptions: five-minute half

time, two time outs per half per
team, five-minute overtime periods,
no time outs, clock not stopping on
charged time outs, unlimited substi
tutions, and no time outs in the last
five minutes of the games.
Intramural play will start on Mon
day, Jan. 16. The reason for the late
starting date is, according to Bugge,
to avoid a conflict with rushing and
to allow teams to practice.
If a team would like to reserve
space in the gym during an evening,
it may contact Bugge.
