## 
### STEW TOY 
Professor John W. Dodds of the
English Department flew east at
Christmas with a special cargo: a
jar of houseflies for his brother,
President Harold Dodds of Prince
ton University.
Or at~ieast that's what a story sent
over the Associated Press wire Dec.
20 said.
The Stanford professor's brother,
according to the AP story, was given
a Mexican wooden pig whose ears
were wiggled by an obliging fly
trapped inside.
The gift was made by the 8-year
old son of the Princeton president's
nephew.
In the course of his frustrating
travail the fly died, whereupon the
donor of the gift asked his uncle at
Stanford to send his brother some
more flies to keep ;the pig's ears wig
gling.
Dodds reportedly inquired of the
Department of Agriculture's Bureau
of Entomology the best way to send
flies 3000 miles.
The Bureau replied that the best
method of fly transportation would
be in a ventilated glass jar "trans
ported as speedily as possible on
one's person to insure warmth."
Dodds, who was flying east for
Christmas anyway, decided to take
the flies along.
But somewhere along the line the
AP went wrong: Dodds says he has
never even heard of his brother's
activated pig or of his nephew's in
tricate fly scheme.
"As far as Dr. Dodds knows," his
secretary fold The Daily, "none of
the things the Associated Press story
referred to exist at all—except his
brother and his nephew, of course."
But the existence of one thing at
least is certain: an overimaginative
Associated Press reporter.
