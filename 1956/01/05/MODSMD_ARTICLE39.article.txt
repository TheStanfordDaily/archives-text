# Jets, Hearts Have Failing in Common
## 
### 
Jet planes and human hearts can
and do fail for the same engineering
reasons, according to newly pub
lished lectures of an internationally
known Stanford surgeon.
Dr. Emile F. Holman, emeritus
head of Stanford Medical School's
Department of Surgery, cites engi
neering principles that govern jet
streams and structural fatigue to
explain blood circulation disorders.
If the disorder l'emains unchecked,
heart failure may result.
