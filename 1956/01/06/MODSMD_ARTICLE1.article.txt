# Cards Invade Huskies; PCC Opener Tonight
## Unbeaten Tribe Flies to Seattle For Pair with UW 
### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
Coach Howie Dallmar takes
his undefeated Indian cagers
into spacious "Hec" Edmundsen
Pavilion in Seattle tonight and
tomorrow night to battle it out
with the Washington Huskies in
the conference opener for both
teams.
In the opening games of the sea
son, Stanford plastered the Huskies,
72-55 and 73-68, in the cozy confines
of the Stanford Pavilion, but the
next two encounters figure to be
tougher for the Cards.
Washington, although holders of a
mediocre 4-5 record, are still rated
along with UCLA as co-favorites for
the coming season. Also the Huskies
have not loiit at home yet this year,
whipping Ba3'lor twice and lowa and
Wi: consin once each.
The Washington defeats came at
the hands of Stanford, twice; Kansas
State, Ohio State and St. Louis.
CARDS UNDEFEATED
Meanwhile Dallmar has led the
surprising Stanford squad through
seven games without a defeat. Be
side Washington, the Indians have
brushed aside Dartmouth, Santa
Clara, lowa, Wisconsin and St. Ma
ry's.
What is surprising about the Stan
ford showing thus far is that there
is scoring punch in only three posi
tions and that the Indians only av
erage about 6-1 in height.
So far Stanford has been able to
compensate for its lack of height and
unbalanced scoring by tremendous
hustle, tight defense and sharp pass
ing. Jn fact, in only one game have
the Indians been outrebounded.
SELLECK LEADER
Little George Selleck will lead the
attack from his guard position. Sel
leck dazzled the Huskfes earlier with
his remarkable passing and shooting.
Hap Wagner, if his ankle is suffi
ciently healed, will team with Sel
leck at guard. Wagner, although not
a big scorer, is an excellent floor
man.
Soph Gary Van Galder, who is be
ginning to show as much on the bas
kctfloor as he did on the football
field, will also see plenty of action
at guard.
BEA AT CENTER
Probable starter at center is Carlos
Bea, b-4, although Carl Isaacs has
been looking good lately. Bea does
little scoring but is tough on defense
and on the boards. Isaacs has been


Quad I'lioto
TIP IN ARTIST—•Big (6-6, 215 pounds) Jim Coshow, Washing
ton's top forward and co-captain, goes up between Husky co
captain Ron Olsen (20) and Stanford's Barry Brown (22) to help
the ball through the hoop for a quick two points. The high
scoring Seattle senior wasn't happy, though—he was supposed
to be defending this basket. The freak play took place in a game
here Dec. 2.
improving rapidly and will see plen
ty of action.
The Indians are strong at forward
with Barry Brown and Bill Bond.
Brown has improved tremendously
since last season. He is scoring very
well and is a demon on defense and

on the boards. He should prove to
be the best jumper in the confer
ence.
BOND READY
Bond was hampered by the flu
over the vacation and missed the
lowa and Wisconsin game?. He was
still weak during the St. Mary's
game Tuesday, but should be ready
to go full speed against the Huskies.
Bond was a power against the
Huskies earlier with his accurate
jump shots from around the key.
Tha Huskies will throw a big but
net particularly fast team at Stan
ford. Center Bruno Boin, 6-8, is
probably the key man for Washing
ton.
The big sophomore showed plenty
of promise with his long hooks
against Stanford earlier. Although
only average on defense and on the
boards, he can break up a game
when he gets hot with his hook.
HUSKIES' ACE
Forward Jim Coshow, 6-6, is the
Huskies' most reliable performer. He
is powerful on the boards, good on
defense and usually scores in double
figures.
Ron Olson, 6-4, the other forward,
is not too strong. Supposedly a good
outside shooter, he has not hit well
yeit this year. In the earlier meeting
between the two teams, Bond had
Olsen tied in knots.
Doyle Perkins is a solid player for
the Huskies at guard. Although not
a consistently heavy scorer, he is
capable of having a 20 point night.
Perkins is also a good passer and is
rough on defense.
GUARD SPOT OPEN
Husky coach "Tippy" Dye has not
settled his other guard position yet.
Ron Patnoe. a senior, will probably
get the nod although he is being
pressed by Don Sunitsch, a deadly
set shooter, and John Tuft, a sopho
more, who did not make the early
trip down to Stanford.
The Indians will face the Huskies
in the biggesit gym in the conference.
Edmundsen Pavilion seats 11,500 and
has a fine playing surface.
