# Cards Invade Huskies; PCC Opener Tonight
## Unbeaten Tribe Flies to Seattle For Pair with UW 
### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
Coach Howie Dallmar takes
his undefeated Indian cagers
into spacious "Hec" Edmundsen
Pavilion in Seattle tonight and
tomorrow night to battle it out
with the Washington Huskies in
the conference opener for both
teams.
In the opening games of the sea
son, Stanford plastered the Huskies,
72-55 and 73-68, in the cozy confines
of the Stanford Pavilion, but the
next two encounters figure to be
tougher for the Cards.
Washington, although holders of a
mediocre 4-5 record, are still rated
along with UCLA as co-favorites for
the coming season. Also the Huskies
have not loiit at home yet this year,
whipping Ba3'lor twice and lowa and
Wi: consin once each.
The Washington defeats came at
the hands of Stanford, twice; Kansas
State, Ohio State and St. Louis.
CARDS UNDEFEATED
Meanwhile Dallmar has led the
surprising Stanford squad through
seven games without a defeat. Be
side Washington, the Indians have
brushed aside Dartmouth, Santa
Clara, lowa, Wisconsin and St. Ma
ry's.
What is surprising about the Stan
ford showing thus far is that there
is scoring punch in only three posi
tions and that the Indians only av
erage about 6-1 in height.
So far Stanford has been able to
compensate for its lack of height and
unbalanced scoring by tremendous
hustle, tight defense and sharp pass
ing. Jn fact, in only one game have
the Indians been outrebounded.
SELLECK LEADER
Little George Selleck will lead the
attack from his guard position. Sel
leck dazzled the Huskfes earlier with
his remarkable passing and shooting.
Hap Wagner, if his ankle is suffi
ciently healed, will team with Sel
leck at guard. Wagner, although not
a big scorer, is an excellent floor
man.
Soph Gary Van Galder, who is be
ginning to show as much on the bas
kctfloor as he did on the football
field, will also see plenty of action
at guard.
BEA AT CENTER
Probable starter at center is Carlos
Bea, b-4, although Carl Isaacs has
been looking good lately. Bea does
little scoring but is tough on defense
and on the boards. Isaacs has been


Quad I'lioto
TIP IN ARTIST—•Big (6-6, 215 pounds) Jim Coshow, Washing
ton's top forward and co-captain, goes up between Husky co
captain Ron Olsen (20) and Stanford's Barry Brown (22) to help
the ball through the hoop for a quick two points. The high
scoring Seattle senior wasn't happy, though—he was supposed
to be defending this basket. The freak play took place in a game
here Dec. 2.
