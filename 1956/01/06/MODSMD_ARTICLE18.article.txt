Has Stanford lived up to your expectations?
In an effort to get seme idea of whether or
net the Stanford "way of life" is what the stu
dents had anticipated it to be, The Daily inter
viewed students around the campus.
liv Hall, '58, Phi Sigma Kappa: "Since my
preconception of Stanford was an extremely
nebulous cne, I find this question difficult io
answer. I think the best way to judge a univer
sity is by contrasting it with sister institutions.
From this viewpoint, I have yet to see any c;her
college surpass Stanford in quality in any
phase cf college life in areas ranging all the
way from the professional s'.aff to the fraternity
112 ystem."
Saxon Humwell, '56, off-campus: "Because
i,f previous educational experience, I had no
expectations whatsoever when I arrived at
Stanford but T was delightfully surprised to
find that the University takes an interest in its
s.udents. I had been to UCLA for two years.
At UCLA, the university as a whole wjrks as
a whole for the university as a whole. At Stan
ford, the University works for the student and
is geared to his needs."
Pdt McMillan, '59, Hoble: "For the most part
Stanford has lived up to my expectations. How
evet, the bored, devil-may-care attitude which
many of the students assume does disappoint
me. 112 surely hope we freshmen never lose the
sparkle and exuberance which seems to be our
special gift."
Betty Alden, '58, Lagunita: "Yes, because I
have found a good balance between social and
academic emphasis at Stanford. Students are
free to organize their own social and academic
lives and therefore they have more individual
responsibility. Hence, they can feel that what
they achieve is through their own initiative and
not a result of University pressure and restric
tions."
Bill Geyer, '57, Phi Sigma Kappa: "Stanford
offers an endless variety of opportunities to
those who will take the bother to explore and
make use of them. On the other hand, one can
spend four years here as a happy vegetable
and then accuse his alma mater of not giving
him anything. Stanford's main asset is its em
phasis on personal responsibility and inde
pendence. If one refuses to accept this chal
lenge to achieve personal maturity, one is
wasting one's tuition. A good junior college
would be better. ... In Stanford the 'do-it
yourself' method is used. All the tools are
here, but the individual must realize the initia
tive to use thern rests with himself."

Judy Lehman, '57, Rcble sponsor: "I think
much of the potential of entering students is
lost or is not developed fully at Stanford. How
ever, I feel that the school offers many chal
lenges academically and socially that are very
satisfying."
John Sturgeon, '57, Alpha Sigma Phi: "Yes,
it has good social life, and the quality of my
instruction in many cases has met rny expec
tations. I .like the atmosphere at Stanford; the
school is small enough so the student doesn't
feel lost in the shuffle, and yet Stanford can
compete in athletics and other activities on a
par with other universities on the coast."
Marjorie Coblintz, '57, Laguniia: '"I think
that generally, Stanford has not lived up to
most students' expectations socially. Boys feel
defeated by the ratio and hence don't use any
initiative to ask girls out. The fault lies in the
failure of the average boy to recognize the
problem. Stanford men should be educated to
the fact that many girls often spend weekends
in the dorm just as they do. They should also
be made to understand that the monetary value
of a date isn't as important in impressing a girl
as they think it is."
Dirk Van Nouhuys, '56, off-campus: "I'd say,
on the whole, Stanford has lived up to my ex
pectations. I came for specific reasons. I came
to Stanford to major in creative writing and
Stanford has a good writing department."
Mary Davison, '57, Madrono: "As far as gen
eral intellectual atmosphere goes, no. It seems
to be fashionable to put on a front of living it up
and groaning over any serious mental activity.
While I would net want Stanford to become a
campus of 7200 'ivory-tower eggheads,' it does
seem to me it would be improved by a de-em
phasis of the extra-curricular rat race and more
rigorous intellectual standards."
Janet Kleinman, '59, Hoble: "Yes, I've made
so many friends here, both among the faculty
and the student body, with whom I can ex
change ideas."
Rob Tremewan, '56, Alpha Sigma Phi: "No;
I do not believe that Stanford's upper-division
program is sufficient, considering the promise
of intellectual enrichment shown by the intro
ductory courses, such as Civ and the beginning
courses in the social sciences. The character
istic 'senior apathy' is partially a result of this
lack of inspiration in the upper-division course
of studies. Perhaps more emphasis should be
placed on the practical fields of study, such as
an undergraduate school of business."

Pdt McMillan, '59, Hoble: "For the most part
Stanford has lived up to my expectations. How
evet, the bored, devil-may-care attitude which
many of the students assume does disappoint
me. 112 surely hope we freshmen never lose the
sparkle and exuberance which seems to be our
special gift."
Betty Alden, '58, Lagunita: "Yes, because I
have found a good balance between social and
academic emphasis at Stanford. Students are
free to organize their own social and academic
lives and therefore they have more individual
responsibility. Hence, they can feel that what
they achieve is through their own initiative and
not a result of University pressure and restric
tions."
Bill Geyer, '57, Phi Sigma Kappa: "Stanford
offers an endless variety of opportunities to
those who will take the bother to explore and
make use of them. On the other hand, one can
spend four years here as a happy vegetable
and then accuse his alma mater of not giving
him anything. Stanford's main asset is its em
phasis on personal responsibility and inde
pendence. If one refuses to accept this chal
lenge to achieve personal maturity, one is
wasting one's tuition. A good junior college
would be better. ... In Stanford the 'do-it
yourself' method is used. All the tools are
here, but the individual must realize the initia
tive to use thern rests with himself."

Judy Lehman, '57, Rcble sponsor: "I think
much of the potential of entering students is
lost or is not developed fully at Stanford. How
ever, I feel that the school offers many chal
lenges academically and socially that are very
satisfying."
John Sturgeon, '57, Alpha Sigma Phi: "Yes,
it has good social life, and the quality of my
instruction in many cases has met rny expec
tations. I .like the atmosphere at Stanford; the
school is small enough so the student doesn't
feel lost in the shuffle, and yet Stanford can
compete in athletics and other activities on a
par with other universities on the coast."
Marjorie Coblintz, '57, Laguniia: '"I think
that generally, Stanford has not lived up to
most students' expectations socially. Boys feel
defeated by the ratio and hence don't use any
initiative to ask girls out. The fault lies in the
failure of the average boy to recognize the
problem. Stanford men should be educated to
the fact that many girls often spend weekends
in the dorm just as they do. They should also
be made to understand that the monetary value
of a date isn't as important in impressing a girl
as they think it is."
Dirk Van Nouhuys, '56, off-campus: "I'd say,
on the whole, Stanford has lived up to my ex

to Stanford to major in creative writing and
Stanford has a good writing department."
Mary Davison, '57, Madrono: "As far as gen
eral intellectual atmosphere goes, no. It seems
to be fashionable to put on a front of living it up
and groaning over any serious mental activity.
While I would net want Stanford to become a
campus of 7200 'ivory-tower eggheads,' it does
seem to me it would be improved by a de-em
phasis of the extra-curricular rat race and more
rigorous intellectual standards."
Janet Kleinman, '59, Hoble: "Yes, I've made
so many friends here, both among the faculty
and the student body, with whom I can ex
change ideas."
Rob Tremewan, '56, Alpha Sigma Phi: "No;
I do not believe that Stanford's upper-division
program is sufficient, considering the promise
of intellectual enrichment shown by the intro
ductory courses, such as Civ and the beginning
courses in the social sciences. The character
istic 'senior apathy' is partially a result of this
lack of inspiration in the upper-division course
of studies. Perhaps more emphasis should be
placed on the practical fields of study, such as
an undergraduate school of business."

would be better. ... In Stanford the 'do-it
yourself' method is used. All the tools are
here, but the individual must realize the initia
tive to use thern rests with himself."

Judy Lehman, '57, Rcble sponsor: "I think
much of the potential of entering students is
lost or is not developed fully at Stanford. How
ever, I feel that the school offers many chal
lenges academically and socially that are very
satisfying."
John Sturgeon, '57, Alpha Sigma Phi: "Yes,
it has good social life, and the quality of my
instruction in many cases has met rny expec
tations. I .like the atmosphere at Stanford; the
school is small enough so the student doesn't
feel lost in the shuffle, and yet Stanford can
compete in athletics and other activities on a
par with other universities on the coast."
Marjorie Coblintz, '57, Laguniia: '"I think
that generally, Stanford has not lived up to
most students' expectations socially. Boys feel
defeated by the ratio and hence don't use any
initiative to ask girls out. The fault lies in the
failure of the average boy to recognize the
problem. Stanford men should be educated to
the fact that many girls often spend weekends
in the dorm just as they do. They should also
be made to understand that the monetary value
of a date isn't as important in impressing a girl
as they think it is."
Dirk Van Nouhuys, '56, off-campus: "I'd say,
on the whole, Stanford has lived up to my ex
pectations. I came for specific reasons. I came
to Stanford to major in creative writing and
Stanford has a good writing department."
Mary Davison, '57, Madrono: "As far as gen
eral intellectual atmosphere goes, no. It seems
to be fashionable to put on a front of living it up
and groaning over any serious mental activity.
While I would net want Stanford to become a
campus of 7200 'ivory-tower eggheads,' it does
seem to me it would be improved by a de-em
phasis of the extra-curricular rat race and more
rigorous intellectual standards."
Janet Kleinman, '59, Hoble: "Yes, I've made
so many friends here, both among the faculty
and the student body, with whom I can ex
change ideas."
Rob Tremewan, '56, Alpha Sigma Phi: "No;
I do not believe that Stanford's upper-division
program is sufficient, considering the promise
of intellectual enrichment shown by the intro
ductory courses, such as Civ and the beginning
courses in the social sciences. The character
istic 'senior apathy' is partially a result of this
lack of inspiration in the upper-division course
of studies. Perhaps more emphasis should be
placed on the practical fields of study, such as
an undergraduate school of business."
What do you think?
Has Stanford lived up to your expectations?
In an effort to get seme idea of whether or
net the Stanford "way of life" is what the stu
dents had anticipated it to be, The Daily inter
viewed students around the campus.
liv Hall, '58, Phi Sigma Kappa: "Since my
preconception of Stanford was an extremely
nebulous cne, I find this question difficult io
answer. I think the best way to judge a univer
sity is by contrasting it with sister institutions.
From this viewpoint, I have yet to see any c;her
college surpass Stanford in quality in any
phase cf college life in areas ranging all the
way from the professional s'.aff to the fraternity
112 ystem."
Saxon Humwell, '56, off-campus: "Because
i,f previous educational experience, I had no
expectations whatsoever when I arrived at
Stanford but T was delightfully surprised to
find that the University takes an interest in its
s.udents. I had been to UCLA for two years.
At UCLA, the university as a whole wjrks as
a whole for the university as a whole. At Stan
ford, the University works for the student and
is geared to his needs."
Pdt McMillan, '59, Hoble: "For the most part
Stanford has lived up to my expectations. How
evet, the bored, devil-may-care attitude which
many of the students assume does disappoint
me. 112 surely hope we freshmen never lose the
sparkle and exuberance which seems to be our
special gift."
Betty Alden, '58, Lagunita: "Yes, because I
have found a good balance between social and
academic emphasis at Stanford. Students are
free to organize their own social and academic
lives and therefore they have more individual
responsibility. Hence, they can feel that what
they achieve is through their own initiative and
not a result of University pressure and restric
tions."
Bill Geyer, '57, Phi Sigma Kappa: "Stanford
offers an endless variety of opportunities to
those who will take the bother to explore and
make use of them. On the other hand, one can
spend four years here as a happy vegetable
and then accuse his alma mater of not giving
him anything. Stanford's main asset is its em
phasis on personal responsibility and inde
pendence. If one refuses to accept this chal
lenge to achieve personal maturity, one is
wasting one's tuition. A good junior college
