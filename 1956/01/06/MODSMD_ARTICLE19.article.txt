five-and-dime'
To the Editor:
The editorial in yesterday's Daily outlines most of
the causes of the Bookstore's inadequacy—but does
not mention the main one!
The chief difficulty with the Bookstore is that it is
not a bookstore at all but rather a high-priced "five
and-dime," which keeps just barely enough books in
tock to maintain its masquerade.
Replacement of the stationery, costume jewelry,
baby bibs, women's toiletries, bedspreads, men's bill
folds, toy animals, drinking glasses, red lace-trimmed
garters and all the other junk that has nothing to do
with scholarly pursuits by books is the improvement
most sorely needed ait the Bookstore.

a few questions
To the Editor:
This is the time of the year when many people
make resolutions, turn over new leaves, start with
clean slates, go on wagons, stop smoking, or generally
decide to lead better and more useful lives. It is,
therefore, an excellent time for some of the gents in
the offices with the high-sounding names in Encina
1,0 he asked a few questions:
1. Why is (here no adequate all-day and all-eve
ring heat supplied to Crothers Hall, the Crothers Hall
Lav/ Library and to some of the other University
residences [and the Daily Shack—Ed|? The reason
rornrnonly given (that i<t ain't cold in the Encina
offices) is felt to be completely inadequate.
2. Why is something not done abou:t the incredibly
fantastic (and even these adjectives or, indeed, any
words are pitifully impotent) parking problem on
campus?
There are about two acres of unused landscaped
in-assorted-weeds space adjacent to the Hoover edi
fice. There are about one and a half acres of unused
imilar type space adjacent to the "temporary" build
ings. There is, in addition, the space occupied by those
"temporary" buildings. . . .
3. Why was Crothers Hall closed during the
Christmas vacations of 1955 as well as 1954? That
had never been done before the present director of
University residences (the office of the director of
University residences happens to be in Encina) insti
tuted the new order.
I discussed this problem with General Yarborough
in 1954 as well as in 1955. I was told that the reasons
were "repairs." That was obviously a rather lame
pretext. The repairs which were done during those
periods consisted of dusting the Venetian blinds and
painting the floors in the basement. The floors were
painted on the last working day before this winter
quarter and they were still wet when the Crothers

residents started to move in on the day before regis
tration!
There are very many students at this University
whose homes are so very far from Palo Alto that it is
often physically or economically impossible for them
to go home for vacations. There are others who. be
cause of their own ineptness and stupidity, have no
other home than Stanford. This writer is one of the
inept and stupid latter group.
There used to be a time when students were en
couraged to think of Stanford Campus as their home.
There used to be a time when much was said, written
and sung about the "Stanford Family." Now Lt seems
that the only people this term refers to are Leland.
Jane Lathrop and Junior. The other day the director
of University residences, General Yarborough him
self, informed me that the students who live in
Crothers Hall have no "legal rights" beyond those of
hotel guests generally. They have to get out whenever
the management (commanding officer?) says so, and
they don't even have any rights to any explanations.
It is strictly a business proposition: You pays your
money and you takes your chance. . . .
And during the whole time |that the dorm was
closed to residents | there were lights burning in
Crothers Hall night and day; there was hot water
available in Crothers Hall; there was steam heat on
in Crothers Hall. Not only that, but the janitors were
around Crothers Hall (with the exception of the
Christmas weekend and the New Year's weekend)
all the time!
This shocks me. I wonder if it shocks anyone else.
Perhaps one of the student government committees
could forget about the price of bagels in Middle
Upper Lower Slobovia for a few days and look into
this matter. Perhaps they could even write and pub
lish a report on this matter. I hope they can.
4. Why is it necessary that we at Stanford pay for
the extra dividends that the Pacific Telephone and
Telegraph Company declares with such frequency?
Why can v/e not have proper telephone service?
Right after the Second World War there was a
shortage of telephone equipment. At that time it was
understandable that a few pay phones had to
to serve several hundred men. This shortage does not
exist now. . . . Then why is it that we still have to
feed those greedy one-armed bandits ten cents for
each wrong number?
Before writing and mailing this letter I was
warned by a number of friends not to write it. Itwas
warned that I would "get in trouble." I was warned
that I might even get booted out of school. . . . And
for a while I believed these things. I became timid.
I became afraid. Then I deckled that this kind of fear
is the worst enemy a great university can have. This
kind of fear, the fear of "getting into troi\ble," is the
greatest tool of authoritarians and dictators, and iit
would be a sad day indeed when free men have to
give way to it. . . .
