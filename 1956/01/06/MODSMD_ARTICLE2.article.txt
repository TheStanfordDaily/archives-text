## Ike: No Tax Cuts at Expense of Children 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (UP)â€”
President Eisenhower told the
election - year Congress today
ihat there must be no tax cuts
"at the expense of our children."
Eisenhower's state-of-the-Union
message was read to Congress by
clerks.
The President flatly ruled out
scheduled cuts in excise and corpo
rate levies.
He also said that he expects to
halance the budget this year and
"shall propose" a balanced budget
for the new fiscal year starting on
July 1.
Furthermore, he said, the budget
must provide for at least a "modest"
reduction in the "enormous" $280
billion national debt.

Some members of Congress, both
Democrats and Republicans, said
they thought the President had left
the door open for a tax cut later this
election year.
The President's message carried a
series of recommendations. Leaving
details to be spoiled out later, the
President called for a "soil bank"
farm program; more defense spend
ing; bigger foreign military-econom
ic aid; federal help for school con
struction; flood insurance and broad
er social security coverage.


PRESIDENT EISENHOWER
