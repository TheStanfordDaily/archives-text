# Fernandel Scores In Sextet Role
## Fly is Scene-Stealer In 'Sheep Has Five Legs' 
### STEW TOY 
"The Sheep Has Five Legs"
pulls the wool six times ever the
camera's eye and comedian Fer
nandel emerges from a plastic
sheep-dip as an equal number
of grinning, bug-eyed charac
ters.
Fernandel as quintuplets is at least
several times as funny as Fernandel
singly, mainly because there are
more of him.
His multiple assignment is further
complicated by his role as the
crotchety, provincial father of the

motley quintet.
Inevitably, the
film's writers saw
fit to make the six
apparitions as di
vergent in charac
ter and occupation
as possible, think
ing that in their
fantastic hetero
geneity lay their

amusement. Much of the comedy is
thus theoretically inherent in the
various situations, and potential
merriment through plot and dia
logue is glossed over and lost.
But Fernandel's expressive and
versatile face pulls things together
and the movie reaches great heights
of hilarity.
The main plot is a thin one: the
mayor of the towt> where the quints
were born tries to persuade their
invalid father, who has vowed to
blast them wiith his shotgun if ever
he sees them again, to reunite with
his sons on their 40th birthday.
The mayor plans a money-making
festival for the occasion, but father
Fernandel will have none of it.
So the mayor sets out on his own
to round up the five brothers.
The brothers Fernandel include a
ship's captain, an advice-to-the
lovelorn columnist, a priest, the pro
prietor of a fashionable Paris re
ducing salon and an impoverished
window-cleaner — the black leg of
the sheep.
Before the mayor captures the
brothers each has his moment in a
little drama.
The most fascinating of these in
volves the captain, whom the mayor
rows out to meet on his ship. The
mayor finds him losing his money
and his cargo in a card game.
When he has lost all but his ship
he proposes they catch a fly, set him
on a table between two lumps of
sugar and bot everything on which
lump he will land.
This is agreed upon, and the en
suing flight of the fly is one of the
most suspenssful sequences we have
ever seen in a movie.
In a miraculous bit of perseverant
photography, the fly flits about from
ceiling, to table, to naked chest of
native girl, to Fernandel's nose.
The whole episode was so fantastic
that there seems to be only one logi
cal answer: we suspect that Fernan
del played the fly too.

pulls the wool six times ever the
camera's eye and comedian Fer
nandel emerges from a plastic
sheep-dip as an equal number
of grinning, bug-eyed charac
ters.
Fernandel as quintuplets is at least
several times as funny as Fernandel
singly, mainly because there are
more of him.
His multiple assignment is further
complicated by his role as the
crotchety, provincial father of the

motley quintet.
Inevitably, the
film's writers saw
fit to make the six
apparitions as di
vergent in charac
ter and occupation
as possible, think
ing that in their
fantastic hetero
geneity lay their

amusement. Much of the comedy is
thus theoretically inherent in the
various situations, and potential
merriment through plot and dia
logue is glossed over and lost.
But Fernandel's expressive and
versatile face pulls things together
and the movie reaches great heights
of hilarity.
The main plot is a thin one: the
mayor of the towt> where the quints
were born tries to persuade their
invalid father, who has vowed to
blast them wiith his shotgun if ever
he sees them again, to reunite with
his sons on their 40th birthday.
The mayor plans a money-making
festival for the occasion, but father
Fernandel will have none of it.
So the mayor sets out on his own
to round up the five brothers.
The brothers Fernandel include a
ship's captain, an advice-to-the
lovelorn columnist, a priest, the pro
prietor of a fashionable Paris re
ducing salon and an impoverished
window-cleaner — the black leg of
the sheep.
Before the mayor captures the
brothers each has his moment in a
little drama.
The most fascinating of these in
volves the captain, whom the mayor
rows out to meet on his ship. The
mayor finds him losing his money
and his cargo in a card game.
When he has lost all but his ship
he proposes they catch a fly, set him
on a table between two lumps of
sugar and bot everything on which
lump he will land.
This is agreed upon, and the en
suing flight of the fly is one of the
most suspenssful sequences we have
ever seen in a movie.
In a miraculous bit of perseverant
photography, the fly flits about from
ceiling, to table, to naked chest of
native girl, to Fernandel's nose.
The whole episode was so fantastic
that there seems to be only one logi
cal answer: we suspect that Fernan
del played the fly too.
