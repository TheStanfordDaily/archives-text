LOS ANGELES, Jan. (i (U.R)—'The
world's greatest golfers, all hoping
to start the new year right, tee off
here today in the 30th renewal of the
Los Angeles Open—a $30,000 scram
ble that pays off with a $6,000 jack
pot to the winner.
The defending champion is Gene
Littler, the 24-year-old youngster
being boomed as the successor to
Ben Hogan—but he isn't even rated
as the favorite in this one.
If there are any favorites they
probably would be Dr. Cary Middle
coff, the most consistent winner of
1955, and Big Mike Souchak, the
long-hitting former Duke Univer
sity football star.
The site of the tourney is the Ran
cho Public Links. This is a long lay
out, measuring 7048 yards. It is wide
open, with very few trees or any
other type of hazard. So it appears
to be made to order for the long
driving Souchak.
