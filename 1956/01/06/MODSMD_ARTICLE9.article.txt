## 
### 
The "talking" plans for Union
Residence and the Union Units were
described to residents of the Units
yesterday in a special talk by Dean
of Women Eiva Fayc Brown.
Miss Brown emphasized that no
definite plans had been made, yet,
but. thait the University was consid
ering the po. -ibility of abandoning
all the Units as residences for un
dergraduate women.
She said that there was a possi
bility that Hnwthorne Cottage and
Elm Cottage might be remodeled for
research purposes; that The Oak.s
might be torn down to make way for
the new Union building; that Ma
drono would probably be abandoned
entirely; and that Manzanita would
be torn down to make way for the
new Alpha Kappa Lambda house.
The times for these changes ranged
all the way from "possibly next
year" to "sometime in the future."
