## Indians Bounce Back To Win Second Tilt 
### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford's Indians jumped
into Pacific Coast Conference
basketball warfare last Friday
and Saturday nights and emerg
ed with a split with the favored
Washington Huskies in Seattle.
Washington broke the Indians'
seven game winning streak with a
57-42 victory on Friday, but Stan
ford bounced back to take the sec
ond game, 58-4G.
Both games were marked by tight
defense and poor shooting on the
part of both teams. Only in the sec
ond half of Saturday's game did
Stanford show its usual hot shooting
form and, as a resulit, pulled the
game out after trailing at halftime.
CARDS IN HOLE
The Indians were thrown into a
hole from which they could not
emerge in the first game. The Hus
kies jumped out to a 10-0 lead in the
first six minutes of action, and that
was the ball game.
George Selleck and Bill Bond fi
nally began to score, but the Indians
still were battling an airtight Husky
defense as well as a lid on the bas
ket. Halftime found the Huskies still
possessing a commanding lead at
26-18.
Stanford picked up four points at
the outsel of the second half to close
the gap, but "Tippy" Dye's crew
suddenly took ofT on a 15 point burst
which left Stanford down 41-22.
Still the Indians weren't through
as sub center Carl Isaacs sparked a
comeback that brought the Cards
back within reach ait 44-36. Stanford
put a full-court press on the Huskies
and forced them into plenty of give
aways, but the hustling Indians also
fouled repeatedly, giving Washing
ton a number of opportunities to
hold their lead by accurate work at
the foul line.
HUSKIES CONNECT
The Huskies connected on 25 free
throws in 34 attempts while hitting
for 16 field goals while the Indians
could collect only 11 field goals.
Stanford tossed in 20 free pitches in
29 attempts.
Ron Patnoe of Washington took
scoring honors for the game with 12
points. He was followed by Selleck
and Huskies Bruno Boin and Doyle
Perkins who all got 10.
