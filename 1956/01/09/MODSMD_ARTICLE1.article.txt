## Indians Bounce Back To Win Second Tilt 
### LARRY JENSEN Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford's Indians jumped
into Pacific Coast Conference
basketball warfare last Friday
and Saturday nights and emerg
ed with a split with the favored
Washington Huskies in Seattle.
Washington broke the Indians'
seven game winning streak with a
57-42 victory on Friday, but Stan
ford bounced back to take the sec
ond game, 58-4G.
Both games were marked by tight
defense and poor shooting on the
part of both teams. Only in the sec
ond half of Saturday's game did
Stanford show its usual hot shooting
form and, as a resulit, pulled the
game out after trailing at halftime.
CARDS IN HOLE
The Indians were thrown into a
hole from which they could not
emerge in the first game. The Hus
kies jumped out to a 10-0 lead in the
first six minutes of action, and that
was the ball game.
George Selleck and Bill Bond fi
nally began to score, but the Indians
still were battling an airtight Husky
defense as well as a lid on the bas
ket. Halftime found the Huskies still
possessing a commanding lead at
26-18.
Stanford picked up four points at
the outsel of the second half to close
the gap, but "Tippy" Dye's crew
suddenly took ofT on a 15 point burst
which left Stanford down 41-22.
Still the Indians weren't through
as sub center Carl Isaacs sparked a
comeback that brought the Cards
back within reach ait 44-36. Stanford
put a full-court press on the Huskies
and forced them into plenty of give
aways, but the hustling Indians also
fouled repeatedly, giving Washing
ton a number of opportunities to
hold their lead by accurate work at
the foul line.
HUSKIES CONNECT
The Huskies connected on 25 free
throws in 34 attempts while hitting
for 16 field goals while the Indians
could collect only 11 field goals.
Stanford tossed in 20 free pitches in
29 attempts.
Ron Patnoe of Washington took
scoring honors for the game with 12
points. He was followed by Selleck
and Huskies Bruno Boin and Doyle
Perkins who all got 10.
The first half of the second game
looked like a replay of Friday's con
test. Stanford did not fall into a
hole, but the baskets came few and
far between for both teams.
Barry Brown of Stanford hit first,
and the lead see-sawed until mid
way through the first half. Selleck's
two pointer gave the Cards a 10-9
lead, but the Huskies bounced back
to grab a 21-18 halftime lead.
The second half found the Indians
exploding into their normal form of
play as they quickly knotted the
count at 22 all, played around with
the lead for a few minutes and fi
nally took it for good as Selleck
drilled in a shot from the corner to
make the score 31-30, favor of the
Cards.
The Indians went on a rampage
at this point as the shots began fall
ing through. Selleclf; Brown and
Bill Flanders all wreaked heavy
damage on the dismayed Huskies.
The Indians proved the old adage
that "the hand is quicker, than the

eye" to the Huskies as time and
again the alei t Stanford five swiped
the ball and cleared the boards.
Jim Coshow of Washington led the
,coring column with 21 points, al
most half of the Husky total. Sel
leck topped the Indians with 17
counters. He was helped considera
bly by Brown with 14 and Flanders
with 13.
Stanford connected on 3G per cent
of its shots compared to its misera
ble 21 per cent of Friday night.
