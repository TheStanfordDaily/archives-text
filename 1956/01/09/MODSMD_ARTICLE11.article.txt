# SUE Proposes Undergraduate Requirements
## Group Recommends Broader Program 
### 
A full year of freshman Eng
lish, broader humanities require
ments and a more specific natu
ral sciehce requirement are fo
cal points in the new lower divi
sion requirements proposal sub
mitted this quarter to the Study
for Undergraduate faculty com
mittee by the student commttee
for the Study of Undergraduate
Education.
In the reappraisal of lower divi
sion requirements, the 20-member
student committee, headed by chair
man Kip Koss, attempted to further
approach the stated LD goal of "giv
ing the student a well-proportioned
background for further thought and
study."
Working from their original criti
cisms of the program which was the
neglecting of many humanities fields
entirely and the inclusion of irrele
vant satisfiers in science and hu
manities, the committee has formu
lated a new six-category lower divi
sion program.
The proposed program totals 55
required units, in place of the exist
ing minimum of 45 units.
CATEGORIES
Category I, English, includes the
two presently required English
courses, 2A and 28, plus a third
quarter emphasizing literature. Eng
lish A would be eliminated, and re
placed by two-hour-a-week coach
ing sessions with an instructor for
those who fail to pass the matricu
lation test.
This additional help would con
tinue until the student reaches pro
ficiency in the fundamentals, in the
opinion of the instructor.
The foreign language category
brought a variety of alternative sug
gestions from the committee. The
most widely approved plan suggests
that students take the language
placement test as they do now.
Students passing the requirement
would be given six units of college
credit. Those placing in 23 courses
would be given three units of credit.
Placement in 3 or 21 courses would
be the same as now. No college
credit would be given for language 1
and 2 courses.
HUMANITIES
The humanities category proposes
10 units to be chosen from the fol
lowing: Humanities 61, 62. 63 (World
Literature), Music 1, Philosophy 2
or 5, Art 61 or 62 and language 23
courses. This would force the stu
dent into going into at least two
of the above fields.
Category IV, natural sciences and
mathematics, is similar to the ex
isting category, but unrelated
courses such as health, psychology,
and ROTC would be eliminated as
science satisfiers.
Only courses in biology, chemistry,
physics, physical sciences and geol
ogy would fulfill the basic require
ment, with electives to make up the
total of 14 units allowed in engineer
ing, mathematics, anthropology and
history of science.
History of science is presently be
ing given only as a graduate special.
The SUE student committee recom
mended establishing such a theoreti
cal science course on the under
graduate level.
WESTERN CIV
Western Civilization (History 10,
11 and 12) would fulfill Category V.
The sixth category, social science,
consists of 10 units to be chosen
from the following: Political Science
1 and 2. Economics 1 and 2, Sociol
ogy 1 and 2, Political Science 20,
Psychology 51, Anthropology 2 and
Geogrnphv 4.
