A university can insist that specific educa
tional reguirements be met before permitting
matriculation, and additionally, a university
can insir' that a certain academic record be
attained and maintained during enrollment and
that specific requirements be fulfilled prerequi
site to graduation. A private university can
esablish these standards as it sees fit.
Currently, Stanford is re-evaluating these
standards, particularly in regard to matricula
tion and graduation. The University commit
tees for the Study of Undergraduate Education
are in their second year of studying the admis
sions policy and the specific course require
ments for graduation.
On recommendation of the Executive Com
mittee of this study, the Academic Council
voted iasi spring to abolish the lower division
upper division classifications at Stanford and
to replace them with an over-all four-year pro
gram. Before that program can become effec
tive, general four-year educational require
ments for all undergraduates must be deter
mined.
The student committee studying undergrad
uate education, a 20-member group headed by
Kip Koss, has just made its recommendations,
recommendations founded on the philosophy
that all Stanford graduates should have a well
proportioned background in English, humani
ties, world civilizations, social sciences, lan
guage and laboratory sciences.
Many of the proposals are the same as those
now in force; many are new, some allow less
flexibility.
Two of the mo;e significant recommenda
tions concern the English requirements. The
student committee feels that a third quarter of
English, devoted to literature, should be re
quired. We feel that this is a vital need. Cor
rect use of the language is the most important

tcol in our civilization and currently it receives
glaringly insufficient attention.
The committee also suggests that English A,
"Bonehead," be dropped; in its stead, those
who fail the matriculation exam, in addition to
the required courses, would have a special
non-credit class with an instructor twice a week
until the students' ability to express themselves
met certain standards. The difficulty with this,
is that the deficient English students would be
placed in English 2a courses in which they
would be undertaking work designed for the
non-deficient English students.
As an addition to the list of courses now
required, the committee suggests 10 units in
humanities from specific courses from the Hu
manities, Art, Philosophy and Music Depart
ments. Language 23 courses would also fill
part of' this requirement. Except possibly for
allowing a language 23 course as an alternate,
we think this requirement is desirable.
In the field of laboratory spience, the com
mittee urges that 14 uniis of work be required
and, because the aim is to acquaint the stu
dents with natural science, that health, psy
chology and ROTC courses are not adequate
substitutes. We quite agree—both with respect
to the narrowing of electives and the need for
natural science education.
We agree with the committee that the old
lower division requirements fell short of their
goal, that they neglected important fields, that
they allowed "irrelevant alternatives" for the
requirements.
Stanford should insist, we feel, that her grad
uates have training in the liberal arts, that they
should have what the committee calls a "well
proportioned background for further thought
and study." To achieve this goal, the student
committee has made essentially-sound sugges
tions; we hope the Executive Committee con
siders them carefully.

humanities from specific courses from the Hu
manities, Art, Philosophy and Music Depart
ments. Language 23 courses would also fill
part of' this requirement. Except possibly for
allowing a language 23 course as an alternate,
we think this requirement is desirable.
In the field of laboratory spience, the com
mittee urges that 14 uniis of work be required
and, because the aim is to acquaint the stu
dents with natural science, that health, psy
chology and ROTC courses are not adequate
substitutes. We quite agree—both with respect
to the narrowing of electives and the need for
natural science education.
We agree with the committee that the old
lower division requirements fell short of their
goal, that they neglected important fields, that
they allowed "irrelevant alternatives" for the
requirements.
Stanford should insist, we feel, that her grad
uates have training in the liberal arts, that they
should have what the committee calls a "well
proportioned background for further thought
and study." To achieve this goal, the student
committee has made essentially-sound sugges
tions; we hope the Executive Committee con
siders them carefully.
A university can insist that specific educa
tional reguirements be met before permitting
matriculation, and additionally, a university
can insir' that a certain academic record be
attained and maintained during enrollment and
that specific requirements be fulfilled prerequi
site to graduation. A private university can
esablish these standards as it sees fit.
Currently, Stanford is re-evaluating these
standards, particularly in regard to matricula
tion and graduation. The University commit
tees for the Study of Undergraduate Education
are in their second year of studying the admis
sions policy and the specific course require
ments for graduation.
On recommendation of the Executive Com
mittee of this study, the Academic Council
voted iasi spring to abolish the lower division
upper division classifications at Stanford and
to replace them with an over-all four-year pro
gram. Before that program can become effec
tive, general four-year educational require
ments for all undergraduates must be deter
mined.
The student committee studying undergrad
uate education, a 20-member group headed by
Kip Koss, has just made its recommendations,
recommendations founded on the philosophy
that all Stanford graduates should have a well
proportioned background in English, humani
ties, world civilizations, social sciences, lan
guage and laboratory sciences.
Many of the proposals are the same as those
now in force; many are new, some allow less
flexibility.
Two of the mo;e significant recommenda
tions concern the English requirements. The
student committee feels that a third quarter of
English, devoted to literature, should be re
quired. We feel that this is a vital need. Cor
rect use of the language is the most important

tcol in our civilization and currently it receives
glaringly insufficient attention.
The committee also suggests that English A,
"Bonehead," be dropped; in its stead, those
who fail the matriculation exam, in addition to
the required courses, would have a special
non-credit class with an instructor twice a week
until the students' ability to express themselves
met certain standards. The difficulty with this,
is that the deficient English students would be
placed in English 2a courses in which they
would be undertaking work designed for the
non-deficient English students.
As an addition to the list of courses now
required, the committee suggests 10 units in
humanities from specific courses from the Hu
manities, Art, Philosophy and Music Depart
ments. Language 23 courses would also fill
part of' this requirement. Except possibly for
allowing a language 23 course as an alternate,
we think this requirement is desirable.
