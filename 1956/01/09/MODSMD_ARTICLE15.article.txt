Well, two more nights of open houses on
the Row and at the eating clubs, and then
formal rushing starts Tuesday evening at 9,
with fraternity pledge card signing dinners
scheduled for Sunday. Then things should
calm dcwn a little bit, and the shoveling-out
and the snow removal parties can get to work.

If you are a faculty woman v/ho missed hear
ing Dr. Bailey's pithy and mordant remarks on
Stanford personalities and life in general at the
Sequoia magazine dinner Saturday, you may
be interested to learn that she is speaking
again this afternoon at 2 at a Faculty Women's
Club caucus in the Women's Clubhouse, upper
lounge. Sounds like something to go to, if you
are either a bona fide member or are adept at
impersonating one.

Tuesday Evening Series lectures this guarter
promise to be unusually stimulating, and lead
ing off tomorrow evening will be Dr. Wallace
Sterling, speaking on the future of Stanford.
If you are the least bit curious as to what the
Administration has up its alpaca sleeve, the
President's predictions certainly should be an
authoritative revelation. Seance starts at 7:30,
in Memorial Auditorium.

Wednesday Afternoon Matinee time is with
us again, and to start''the guarter off the local
thespians are giving GBS's "The Man of Des
tiny," a one-act play, in Little Theater at 4:15,
under the aegis of the Department of Speech
and Drama. The cast is well chosen and expe
rienced, the play is proven theater, and the ad
mission is as usual non-existent, so it should be
a painless p.m.'s entertainment.

The Committee on Public Exercises, thinly

disguised as the Stanford Film Society, opens
the annual great films series this Thursday
night with "The Informer," starring Victor
McLaglen and directed by John Ford. After
this showing, you won't be able to get in un
less you purchase a season ticket ($1.65), and
since they always sell out, if you plan to deal
yourself in on this one, you'd better start look
ing into buying a ticket, available at Memorial
Auditorium box office, and at the door while
they last.

lege. Friday afternoon, Aaron Copland will
deliver a lecture at 4:15 in Cubberley Audito

concert at 8:15, Memorial Auditorium. And
Sunday afternoon at 4, the Department of Music
is sponsoring a concert of the music of Mr. Cop
land in Cubberley. The Stanford Symphony
Orchestra and the Stanford Chorale will par
ticipate in the program.

Sunday Evening Flicks: This week Gary Gie

guile the spare time of local roughs and their
witches. It's "Night People," starring Broderick
Crawford and Gregory Peck, plus shorts.

And to close our little calendar, we offer you
a bit of intelligence culled from the realm of
Mother Nature. To wit: "A canvasback duck
has been clocked at 72.2 miles per hour."
