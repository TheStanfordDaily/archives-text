# 'Artists and Models' Contains Models, But Little Artistry
## Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis Are Colorful But . . . Only in the Chromatic Sense 
### RICHARD MENDE 
A shrewd but tolerant observer of political - phenomena said
that civil liberties gave a person the right to ftiake a fool of him
self, It might be observed of our own society that certain people
abuse that privilege.
Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis have made another movie. It is

called "Artists and Models." Martin"
and Lewis are more colorful than
ever—if only in a chromatic sense—
with the addition of Technicolor.
The story itself is a riot. Jerry
Lewis (the zany one) has always
been mad about the Batgirl of Bat
girl comics. Who should he find liv
ing above him in his New York
apartment, and whose horoscope that
very day advised her she was going
to meet the man of her dreams?
Right. The Batgirl model. Well,
she, Shirley MacLaine, the Batgirl
model, starts pursuing him, Jerry
Lewis (the zany one) throughout
the movie.
TALKS IN SLEEP
At this point it is important to
know that Dean Martin draws a
comic strip and that Jerry Lewis
talks one in his sleep. One night
Lewis dreamed up this scientific se
cret which if it fell into enemy
hands would have grave consequen
ces. Unwittingly Martin prints half
of this secret formula in his comic
strip which is noticed by American
agents and foreign spies as well.
So at this artists' ball, Eva Gabor,
disguised as the REAL Batgirl, lures
poor Jerry to a secret place where
she tries to drug him into talkative
sleepfulness in order to recover the
second half of the secret formula.
Thankfully our government agents
come along with Dean Martin (the
other one) in the nick of time. Quite
a picture.
PARADING WOMEN
Incidentally, there are some mem
orably developed women parading
around the sets.
While it would be ungenerous to
complain about this abundant plot
ting, there keeps ringing in my head
a phrase, used in another context,
about "a tale told by an . . ."
Insiders may have noticed that the
songs are equally divided between
Dean Martin (the other one) and

Jerry Lewis (the zany one) accord
ing to the terms of their latest con
tract— which doesn't affect things
greatly.
By the way the second hit at the
Stanford is "The Warriors" with
Errol Flynn, CinemaScope and Tech
nicolor. Mr. Flynn has been known
as a colorful individual for some
time.
