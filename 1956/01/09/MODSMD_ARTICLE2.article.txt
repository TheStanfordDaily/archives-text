# Cal Bombs Ref And USC Wins --The Easy Way

"I'm ashamed of them," said
California Head Yell Leader Ron
Allbce after the antics of his root
ing section had caused forfeiture
of the Cal-USC basketball game
Saturday night.
When the Bear rooters found
their club on the short end of a
77-64 score late in the second half,
they took out their displeasure on
referee A 1 Lightner.
Lightncr was hit in the eye by
a flying object, then promptly an
nounced over the P.A. system that
the game would be forfeited un
less spectators stopped hurling
things.
They didn't. In fact Lightner
was smacked on the neck shortly
after his plea.
Then the bombarded ref called
the game, the first in Coast Con
ference history to be forfeited, at
least as far as any observers could
remember.
After calling the game Lightner
was led by the local police through
lines of big, bad, noisy—and un
happy—Bear rooters. At this point
the TV cameras turned away from
the scene because of "obscene ges
tures."
Commented Nibs Price, ex-Bear
coach: "I've seen things much
worse both at home and on the
road. . , . Things being thrown on
the floor are certainly no novelty
in this league."
Said Lightner: "This is the last
time I'll work here."
