# Papooses Edge Broncos In Wild Overtime Contest
## Pflueger, Neumann Pace Assault as Cards Come from Behind in Closing Minutes 
### DAVE CANFIELD 
As the rest of the freshman men were being rushed last Satur
day night, Stanford's freshman cage sguad was doing its own
rushing.
The Papooses rushed Santa Clara right out of the Pavilion with
a last ditch rally to win, 69-65, in overtime.

With four minutes left in the'
game, the home team trailed, 55-49.
Then they got hot. With 45 seconds
remaining, Paul Neumann hit a jump
.'.hot to tie the score at 57-57.
The overtime saw the Papooses
i not only ouitshoot but also outre
bouncl Santa Clara. The hero of the
rally was Captain John Pflueger. In
the final four minutes of regulation
play and the five-minute overtime,
the blond strong boy pumped in 10
points. For the game as a whole,
Pflueger sank 16 points.
NEUMANN HITS 15
Backing him up was Neumann
with 15 tallies but game scoring
honors went to Santa Clara's captain
and forward, lanky Jerry Bochich.
Bochich, a jump-shot and rebound-

ing expert, burst the nets by scoring
26 markers on 12 field goals and two
free, throws.
11' Bochieh had not been forced to
leave the court in the last minute
of regulation play with a leg cramp,
I the outcome might have been dif
ferent.
I As it was, Santa Clara started off
j like it intended to embarrass the
' Papooses in front of a paltry crowd
of some GO partisans.
After Neumann's free throw gave
the home team a 1-0 lead, the visi
tors weave netted them a 17-7 cush
ion. Guard Jim Taylor, guard Dave
Dawson,, center John Marshall and
Bochich each swished four points in
this splurge.
PAPOOSES MOVE â€¢
This was Santa Clara's biggest
bulge. With improved passing and
with the rebounding of guard Tom
Crawford, the home frosh finally
found themselves. At 4:45 of the first
half, Joel Newkirk's jump shot knot
ted the count at 21-21.
But the junior Broncos bucked

Stanford out of this secure posi
tion. Bochich was the wildest bronc
of all, pouring in five jump shots as
Santa Clara snatched a 32-2(5 half
time advantage.
BRONCS HOLD LEAD
For most of the second half, the
Broncos consistently stayed from
two to eight points ahead of the
Indians.
With about four minutes gone in
the half, Stanford looked good very
briefly. Fastbreaking their way to
four consecutive baskets, the Pa
pooses tied the score at 36-36.
It was the ballhawking of Craw
ford that sparked this rush but Tay
lor and Bochich hit and Santa Clara
was in control until Stanford's spec
tacular final spurt.
The home boys won on the free
throw line. Outscored in field goals,
27-25, the Papooses canned 19 of 28
foul shots to 11 of 15 for the junior
Broncos.
REBOUNDING EVEN
Rebounding in the game was about
even with both teams having abun
dant height.
The victory gives the Papooses a
creditable 2-1 record. Next Friday
night they will host San Jose State
College, and Saturday night Lowell
High of San Francisco will invade
the Pavilion. Game time will be
5:45 p.m. for both contests.

The Stanford Brave - Cal Ram
bler games, scheduled for last Fri

| team.
The Braves will meet Fort Ord
Friday and Moffett Field Satur
day. Both games will be played in
the Pavilion and will start at 3:45
