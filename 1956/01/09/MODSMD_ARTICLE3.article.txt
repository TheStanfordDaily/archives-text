# SEQUOIA BANQUET
## Bailey Says Intellectual Stimulus Lacking Here 
### STEW TOY 
Dr. Margery Bailey, shining regally, told a capacity crowd of
200 at Saturday night's Sequoia magazine banquet that true intel
lectualism is "not books, but a way of life."
The banquet was a benefit for Stanford's new literary magazine,

to appear Thursday.
Speaking on "The Intellectual
Vacuum at Stanford," Dr. Bailey
said the main difficulty in Stanford's
meager intellectual life is the lack
of stimulus.
"That's the faculty's fault. But you
can't blame the faculty entirely.
When they face classes of two and
three hundred, how can they stimu
late the students?"
Speaking largely autobiographi
cally, Dr. Bailey recalled her own
introduction to "intellectualism" —
intellectualism in the Bohemian
sense, "the sort most of you recog
nize most easily."
FIRST INTELLECTUAL
She said the first "intellectual" she
ever met was a Stanford professor.
When she was a student here she
took a seminar in which the profes
sor "insisted that the students should
smoke to show that we were free."
At these seminars the ladies "ei
ther sat on the floor or on the knees
of the gentlemen."
"Before lunch," she said, "we all
had to drink a glass of 'jackass
brandy.' I took a sip of mine and
hid the glass. The professor found it
and asked, 'Whose glass is this?' I

swallowed it all.
"But later I found that drinking it
was a good thing. After lunch every
body began feeling • very intellec
tual."
MORE INTELLECTUALS
Later on she met other intellec
tuals who "made flat remarks and
terrorized you."
After studying 17th and 18th cen
tury intellectuals Dr. Bailey found
that many of them were "too sacro
sanct and complacent. They had
something that nobody else had and
were very aware of it."
She took Ibsen as the perfect in
tellectual. "He enjoyed thinking,
which was the major thing of his
existence. But he was able to share
it. He didn't have to live in a cabin
locked up in a moat."
The intellectual, she said, "is what
the 17th century called a 'wit,' what
the Elizabethan era called a 'com
plete man.'
"Because of his specialization the
intellectual is narrow. He lives like
a saint in a life of his own."
MEDITATION
She said that "meditation and
consideration, not reading, makes an
intellectual."
"In my day," Dr. Bailey said, "it
seemed like there were intellectuals
on the campus. But there were also
activities.
''The real work of intellect is the
professor wording with his brighter
students, getting good ideas."
For this system to work, she said,
the faculty and students must get to
know each other. But to effect a
friendly relationship by "forced
feeding—the present method of stu
dent-faculty lunches—won't work.
But neither does the faculty have
time to meet the students in their
offices.
And in meetings, people are "rig
idly self-conscious" of what they
should say. "They feel they must be
a shining light and say something
tremendous. But they mustn't go
too far or they will be regarded as
'pushing characters'."
MAIN PROBLEM
The main trouble with Stanford,
she said, is that there are "many too
many here. Of our 7000 students,
5000 of them shouldn't be wasting
their time on—what is laughingly
called—higher education."
Dr. Bailey said that "a great many
of the thousands here were simply
shooed into college by their par
ents." \
"We are a sort of scrapbasket. Our
undergraduates are just a large
moving field, like Van Gogh's pic
ture of a moving wheat field.
All too often, she said, "law stu
dents take humanities courses and
sit in the next-to-the-last row and
watch you. When they don't turn in
their papers and can't take the final
it doesn't matter. They didn't care
about the course anyway.
WASTE OF TIME
"Oh, the waste of time!"
She said there are a great many
people here "hungry for the contact
with intellectuals which they know
is going on somewhere above their
heads."
Two things can be done to solve
this problem, she said. The Univer
sity can either "talk some million
aires into giving u.s a larger endow
ment so the enrollment can be cut"
or enlarge the faculty.
She thought the possibility of
achieving these goals is made great
er by our having a "scholar, a hu
| manist, a man of intellect in the
' President's chair."

The main trouble with Stanford,
she said, is that there are "many too
many here. Of our 7000 students,
5000 of them shouldn't be wasting
their time on—what is laughingly
called—higher education."
Dr. Bailey said that "a great many
of the thousands here were simply
shooed into college by their par
ents." \
"We are a sort of scrapbasket. Our
undergraduates are just a large
moving field, like Van Gogh's pic
ture of a moving wheat field.
All too often, she said, "law stu
dents take humanities courses and
sit in the next-to-the-last row and
watch you. When they don't turn in
their papers and can't take the final
it doesn't matter. They didn't care
about the course anyway.
WASTE OF TIME
"Oh, the waste of time!"
She said there are a great many
people here "hungry for the contact
with intellectuals which they know
is going on somewhere above their
heads."
Two things can be done to solve
this problem, she said. The Univer
sity can either "talk some million
aires into giving u.s a larger endow
ment so the enrollment can be cut"
or enlarge the faculty.
She thought the possibility of
achieving these goals is made great
er by our having a "scholar, a hu
| manist, a man of intellect in the
' President's chair."
Dr. Margery Bailey, shining regally, told a capacity crowd of
200 at Saturday night's Sequoia magazine banquet that true intel
lectualism is "not books, but a way of life."
The banquet was a benefit for Stanford's new literary magazine,

to appear Thursday.
Speaking on "The Intellectual
Vacuum at Stanford," Dr. Bailey
said the main difficulty in Stanford's
meager intellectual life is the lack
of stimulus.
"That's the faculty's fault. But you
can't blame the faculty entirely.
When they face classes of two and
three hundred, how can they stimu
late the students?"
Speaking largely autobiographi
cally, Dr. Bailey recalled her own
introduction to "intellectualism" —
intellectualism in the Bohemian
sense, "the sort most of you recog
nize most easily."
FIRST INTELLECTUAL
She said the first "intellectual" she
ever met was a Stanford professor.
When she was a student here she
took a seminar in which the profes
sor "insisted that the students should
smoke to show that we were free."
At these seminars the ladies "ei
ther sat on the floor or on the knees
of the gentlemen."
"Before lunch," she said, "we all
had to drink a glass of 'jackass
brandy.' I took a sip of mine and
hid the glass. The professor found it
and asked, 'Whose glass is this?' I

swallowed it all.
"But later I found that drinking it
was a good thing. After lunch every
body began feeling • very intellec
tual."
MORE INTELLECTUALS
Later on she met other intellec
tuals who "made flat remarks and
terrorized you."
After studying 17th and 18th cen
tury intellectuals Dr. Bailey found
that many of them were "too sacro
sanct and complacent. They had
something that nobody else had and
were very aware of it."
She took Ibsen as the perfect in
tellectual. "He enjoyed thinking,
which was the major thing of his
existence. But he was able to share
it. He didn't have to live in a cabin
locked up in a moat."
The intellectual, she said, "is what
the 17th century called a 'wit,' what
the Elizabethan era called a 'com
plete man.'
"Because of his specialization the
intellectual is narrow. He lives like
a saint in a life of his own."
MEDITATION
She said that "meditation and
consideration, not reading, makes an
intellectual."
"In my day," Dr. Bailey said, "it
seemed like there were intellectuals
on the campus. But there were also
activities.
''The real work of intellect is the
professor wording with his brighter
students, getting good ideas."
For this system to work, she said,
the faculty and students must get to
know each other. But to effect a
friendly relationship by "forced
feeding—the present method of stu
dent-faculty lunches—won't work.
But neither does the faculty have
time to meet the students in their
offices.
And in meetings, people are "rig
idly self-conscious" of what they
should say. "They feel they must be
a shining light and say something
tremendous. But they mustn't go
too far or they will be regarded as
'pushing characters'."

tellectual. "He enjoyed thinking,
which was the major thing of his
existence. But he was able to share
it. He didn't have to live in a cabin
locked up in a moat."
The intellectual, she said, "is what
the 17th century called a 'wit,' what
the Elizabethan era called a 'com
plete man.'
"Because of his specialization the
intellectual is narrow. He lives like
a saint in a life of his own."
MEDITATION
She said that "meditation and
consideration, not reading, makes an
intellectual."
"In my day," Dr. Bailey said, "it
seemed like there were intellectuals
on the campus. But there were also
activities.
''The real work of intellect is the
professor wording with his brighter
students, getting good ideas."
For this system to work, she said,
the faculty and students must get to
know each other. But to effect a
friendly relationship by "forced
feeding—the present method of stu
dent-faculty lunches—won't work.
But neither does the faculty have
time to meet the students in their
offices.
And in meetings, people are "rig
idly self-conscious" of what they
should say. "They feel they must be
a shining light and say something
tremendous. But they mustn't go
too far or they will be regarded as
'pushing characters'."
MAIN PROBLEM
The main trouble with Stanford,
she said, is that there are "many too
many here. Of our 7000 students,
5000 of them shouldn't be wasting
their time on—what is laughingly
called—higher education."
Dr. Bailey said that "a great many
of the thousands here were simply
shooed into college by their par
ents." \
"We are a sort of scrapbasket. Our
undergraduates are just a large
moving field, like Van Gogh's pic
ture of a moving wheat field.
All too often, she said, "law stu
dents take humanities courses and
sit in the next-to-the-last row and
watch you. When they don't turn in
their papers and can't take the final
it doesn't matter. They didn't care
about the course anyway.
WASTE OF TIME
"Oh, the waste of time!"
She said there are a great many
people here "hungry for the contact
with intellectuals which they know
is going on somewhere above their
heads."
Two things can be done to solve
this problem, she said. The Univer
sity can either "talk some million
aires into giving u.s a larger endow
ment so the enrollment can be cut"
or enlarge the faculty.
She thought the possibility of
achieving these goals is made great
er by our having a "scholar, a hu
| manist, a man of intellect in the
' President's chair."
Dr. Margery Bailey, shining regally, told a capacity crowd of
200 at Saturday night's Sequoia magazine banquet that true intel
lectualism is "not books, but a way of life."
The banquet was a benefit for Stanford's new literary magazine,

to appear Thursday.
Speaking on "The Intellectual
Vacuum at Stanford," Dr. Bailey
said the main difficulty in Stanford's
meager intellectual life is the lack
of stimulus.
"That's the faculty's fault. But you
can't blame the faculty entirely.
When they face classes of two and
three hundred, how can they stimu
late the students?"
Speaking largely autobiographi
cally, Dr. Bailey recalled her own
introduction to "intellectualism" —
intellectualism in the Bohemian
sense, "the sort most of you recog
nize most easily."
FIRST INTELLECTUAL
She said the first "intellectual" she
ever met was a Stanford professor.
When she was a student here she
took a seminar in which the profes
sor "insisted that the students should
smoke to show that we were free."
At these seminars the ladies "ei
ther sat on the floor or on the knees
of the gentlemen."
"Before lunch," she said, "we all
had to drink a glass of 'jackass
brandy.' I took a sip of mine and
hid the glass. The professor found it
and asked, 'Whose glass is this?' I

swallowed it all.
"But later I found that drinking it
was a good thing. After lunch every
body began feeling • very intellec
tual."
MORE INTELLECTUALS
Later on she met other intellec
tuals who "made flat remarks and
terrorized you."
After studying 17th and 18th cen
tury intellectuals Dr. Bailey found
that many of them were "too sacro
sanct and complacent. They had
something that nobody else had and
were very aware of it."
She took Ibsen as the perfect in
tellectual. "He enjoyed thinking,
which was the major thing of his
existence. But he was able to share
it. He didn't have to live in a cabin
locked up in a moat."
