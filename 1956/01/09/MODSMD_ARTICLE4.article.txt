## President Makes Decision But Declines to Reveal It 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (UP) â€”President Eisenhower indicated
ioday he has reached a tentative decision on whether to seek a
second term. But he made very clear that he could change his
mind.
The President, who gave no hint which way he was leaning.

had words which will provide com-'
fort both to Republiacns who hope
he will run and Democrats who hope
he won't.
He said, for example, that the
Presidency is the "most taxing" job
he ever had. But he added quickly
that it also has "its inspirations
which tend to counteract each oth
er."
Eisenhower's announcement failed
to change predictions by political
leaders on whether he will seek a
second term.
Republicans, who previously ex
pressed confidence the President
would run, pointed to certain por
tions of the news conference at Key
West, Fla., as evidence to bolster
their prediction.
Democrats, who have said he
would not be a candidate, pointed
to other statements to support their
views.
