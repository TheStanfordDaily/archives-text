# Senate Committee Reprimands Army

### 
WASHINGTON â€” Senate military
investigators sternly reprimanded
the Army for "waste and inefficien
cy" today in the way it "carelessly"
handled 1195 tents for Nike anti-air
craft centers.
The Senate Preparedness subcom
mittee said taxpayers stood to lose
as much as $2,500,000 if its investi
gators had not spotted some of the
tents lying out in the wind and rain
at Fort Meade, Md., last July.
The subcommittee declared that
the incident, if typical, "reflects a
deplorable laxness in the current
practice of cost consciousness in the
Army." The subcommittee is headed
by Senate Democratic leader Lyndon
B. Johnson of Texas.
The subcommittee charged that
through "careless errors" the Army
ordered far too many tents, includ
ing some for Nike centers where
permanent housing was available.
Then, it said, surplus tents were
stored away "where convenient."
