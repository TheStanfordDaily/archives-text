# Quiet Introduction For CinemaScope
## 
### 
CinemaScope made its bow at
Mem Aud last night before one of
the best behaved gatherings in the
history of the Sunday flicks.
The near capacity audience
seemed relatively unimpressed by
the wide screen recently initiated
by flick manager Garry Gielow.
There were a few favorable com
ments about the beauty of the
photography of Rome in the pic
ture "Three Coins in a Fountain."
As a matter of fact the plain old
narrow screen (cartoons, one a
UPA one about an imaginary ele
phant and one a Looney Tunes
road runner story, seemed to cap
tivate the audicncc much more
effectively.
They were a few remarks about
the raise in price from 20 to 25
cents, one Stanford man declaring,
"Good Lord, they're making us
pay through the teeth."
