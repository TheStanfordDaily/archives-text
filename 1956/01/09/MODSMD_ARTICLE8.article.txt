# Graduate Student Judged Guilty In Honor Code Case
## 
### 
The Judicial Council recently
found a graduate student guilty of
an Honor Code violation in work
done for a graduate English course
in education.
The instructor in the course ac
cused the student of plagiarism in
compiling a handbook of English
teaching techniques, as he directly
quoted and closely paraphrased ma
terial from textbooks without citing
ithe sources.
The student said his understand
ing of the assignment was that the
handbook was to be for his own fu
ture use in teaching, although he
would be graded on it. Since the
handbook was intended as a com
pilation rather than original work,
he did not consider it necessary to
cite all sources.
The Student also stated that he
had no intention of deceit, since he
was sure the instructor would recog
nize the material as coming from the
textbook.
The Council judged that his action
constituted plagiarism in that the
handbook was class work on which
he would be graded, and recom
mend that the student receive an
"F" in the course.
