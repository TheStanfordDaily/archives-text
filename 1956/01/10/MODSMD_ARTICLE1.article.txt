# Thieves Get Electronic Equipment
## U.S. Property Gone; FBI May Be Called 
### 
The second theft of electronic
equipment within the last five
days was reported to the Stan
ford Police Department yester
day afternoon, according to Po
lice Chief Gordon Davis.
Tl ie theft is the fifth since the be
ginning of the quarter.
According to Chief Davis, a "small
amount of Government radio equip
ment" was taken from the wave
measuring station located in back of
the Ford Center, near the 17th hole
of the golf course. No value has been
placed on the gear, yet.
The loss was discovered yesterday
afternoon when one of the Electron
ics Research Laboratory staff mem
bers went up to the station.
Entry was gained, according to
Chief Davis, by using some sort of
lever to pry the padlock off the sta
tion door. He guessed that the theft
took place on Sunday afternoon.
Last week, more than $500 worth
of electronic equipment was stolen
from the radio station behind the
Ryan Electronics Laboratory.
Chief Davis pointed out that the
equipment stolen from the radio sta
tion belonged to the University but
that the gear taken from the wave
measuring station is owned by the
United States Government.
He said that the Department will
notify the Federal Bureau of Inves
tigation and that they may take ac
tion on the case.
