# Judicial Council Acquits Seniors
## 
### 
Two seniors were recently found
not guilty of Honor Code violations
in two cases involving the same
chemistry final.
The Judicial Council found both
students not guilty of cheating on
the exam on the basis of insufficient
evidence.
In one case the instructor in the
course reported similarities in the
defendant's blucbook and those of
the students on either side of him.
There was no appearance of copying
during the tesit, and the Council
found the correlations not strong
enough to indicate cheating.
A second student was observed by
another member of the class appar
ently copying from the person next
to him. This witness reported his
suspicions to the instructor, who on
watching fropi the back of the room
also concluded copying was being
done.
The defendant said he had looked
around tihe room but not at the
paper next to him. He was warned
to avoid future actions which could
give the appearance of cheating.
The Judicial Council, which hears
cases of possible Honor Code viola
tions. consists of the combined mem
ber; hip of Men's and Women's coun
cils. Chairman this quarter is Ger
ald Messner.
