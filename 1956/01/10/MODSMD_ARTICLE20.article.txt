# Eating Clubs Hold Final Open House
## Webster Is Pleased With Rush Program 
### 
Stanford's seven eating clubs
host rushees at open houses for
the last time tonight from 7:15 to
9:45.
The clubs entered their formal
rushing period in Christmas vaca
tion, but the invitational parties and
meals will begin in earnest now that
the open house program is drawing
to a close.
Interclub President Bob Webster
stated yesterday that he was very
happy with the way the rushing pro
gram was going. "I'm very pleased
with the reasonable, logical attitude
toward rushing shown by this year's
frosh. They're not at all panicked."
Webster also added that to his
knowledge the turnouts that the
clubs ai'e hosting are the biggest in
history.
Tonight's program is the fourth
open house that the seven eating
clubs, El Cuadro, El Toro, Breakers,
El Campo, Los Arcos, El Capitan and
El Tigre, are hosting.
Club men at Stanford receive the
benefits of belonging to a social or
ganization, while still being inde
pendent enough to enjoy many other
University benefits, according to
Webster.
Eating clubbers may live at Toyon
Hall, reserved specifically for them,
or off campus. The cost of an eating
club is $165 a quarter for board bill
and social dues ranging from $3 to
$20 per quarter. In most clubs each
member serves on one work crew
each three months.
Hashing jobs are available at the
clubs also, so that cost of belonging
can be reduced.
Although intensive rushing will
stop soon, most clubs will continue
to pledge on a steady basis through
out winter and spring quarters.
