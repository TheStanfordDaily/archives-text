The Bookstore's well-known blackboard,
which has neatly listed the numerous required
texts that are "not in," has had avid, wide
spread readership during the past week.
Yesterday that blackboard v/as wiped clean.
What did it mean? Did it mean that the texts
were available ai long last? On this assump
tion, many students waited in the line for 15
minutes or more to buy their texts.
Only to find that the bocks they wanted were
still unavailable.
Why was the list erased? Why were stu

dents compelled to stand in line only to dis
cover that they were wasting their time?
A Bookstore official explained that some of
the books had been arriving. She further ex
plained that the Bookstore preferred to have
the students inquire over the counter about
which ones had or had not arrived, rather than
consult a list.
So . . . the Bookstore erases the list and the
students stand in line.
