A great change was ushered into the student
government of the University of California last
month as Ihe students approved a constitu
tional amendment which combined the posi
tions of business manager and athletic director
into one executive director.
The two positions had been separate ever
since 1946 when a student demonstration
against the football situation led to the separa
tion of the two posts. It is believed by many
that the crcation of this post will rule out the
possibility that head football coach Pappy Wal
dorf will be kicked upstairs to athletic director,
a position which has now been abolished.
In the same election Ron Allbee was elected
new head yell leader over Bill Bixby by the
slim margin of 35 votes.
Allbee found himself in the middle of a con
troversy almost immediately. The rooting sec
tion got a little out of hand Saturday afternoon
and the SC-Cal basketball game was forfeited
to SC before the game was over.
Allbee biasted his rooting section, declaring
to the press, "I'm ashamed of them. They be
haved like kids. They have no respect for the
other team or for the officials."
Allbee said that the only solution v/as to
police the rioting kiddies carefully. He thought
that this could be done best by having two big,
burly athletes from each fraternity serve on
rally committee and club the boys when they
get out of hand.

They took a poll at the University of Texas
on an interesting question —whether or not
milk dispensing machines should be placed all
over the campus.
Professors were almost unanimous for the
idea but the student body did not seem particu
larly excited about it.
The results of the poll, plus many student
comments, were printed in the Daily Texan
under the headline "With Men Who Know
Milk Best, It's Beer, 2-1."
"You drink milk at meals with food, that's
enough," declared one coed. "If they'd sell
beer, I'd be more alert in class," added another
girl. A Texan man endorsed the idea of beer
dispensers. "Good way for the university to
make money," he said.
Upon hearing the milk idea, one Texan*

yelled hysterically, "Texas is going dry," and
then fled.
A few extolled the health-giving qualities of
milk and heartily endorsed the dispensers.
However, about three-fourths of the students
agreed with the Texan who declared, "That is
absolutely ridiculous. The very thought of it
makes me sick."
One fraternity man stated, "My fraternity
doesn't allow anything but mixed drinks. I
can't think of anything I could mix with milk.
Can you?"
He's got a point there.

Effigy hanging continues to be the popular
thing on the West Coast and now they've got
ten down to fraternity house presidents at
Washington State.
A dummy of Bob Laßounty, Esquire Hall
president, v/as found hanging in the main cor
ridor cf the dorm recently along with a sign
declaring, "Laßounty must go." The culprits
had also raided Laßounty's room and had used
his personal clothes on the dummy to make the
hanging more realistic.

The University of Connecticut (which re
cently suspended 10 fraternities) isn't the only
college in the East which is having fraternity
trouble. At Johns Hopkins University the
Greeks are really in hot water.
The fraternities have been accused by the
community of having parties with excessive
drinking and noise. The dean of the college
told the Interfraternity Council recently, "I
think we're about at the end of the line. Unless
you find a way to regulate your own behavior,
I shall have to ask in succession for the with
drawal of the individual chapters from their
national fraternities."
Fraternity comment was "varied. The presi
dent of the Alpha Epsilon Pi house stated, "I
agree with the dean that this is a bad situation.
My fraternity will do everything to follow the
suggestions and to appease the complaining
neighbors within the realm of reason and prac
ticality."
However, the indignant president of the Al
pha Delta Phi house said, "We all know Alpha
Delt io be a society of gentlemen; we have no
such trouble with drinking or noise."
