two major errors
To the Editor:
In yesterday's feature article regarding rushing,
The Daily once again demonstrated, among other
things, its inability to accurately report the facts.
Although much of the tone of the article was hardly
appropriate, the average student is quite practiced in
sifting what he reads. I am pointing out two major
errors in your article—not for the benefit of the many
.students who seem to be better informed than The
Daily, but for the understanding of the men of '59, to
whom rushing is confusing enough without Thr»
Daily's errors.
First, I call attention to your sub-title [headline],
"Fraternities Begin Closed Rushing Parties," and
your words "Closed fraternity rushing began last _
night following open houses." A phone call to any
fraternity or to almost any freshman, and you would
have found that formal rushing pai ties do not start
until nine o'clock Tuesday evening | tonight |. The
fact th: t The Daily has in recent issues printed the
correct rushing schedule shows that it at least had
the information cn hand, whatever consolation that
may be to your readers.
A few paragraphs later, the truth once again took
gas. To quote your erroneous generality: "One black
ball, or 'ding', eliminates a rushee from further con
sideration." If you took the trouble to check into the
facts, you would have found that they simply don't
support your statement; and realizing that, you might
have hesitated to print it.
The particularly unfortunate thing about this last
error is thai, many people will believe it—not frater
nity men, or most upper classmen, for they know
better; but many freshmen who have no way of
knowing any better, and who .are only learning nefw
to sift what they read. It, Is for their enlightenment
that I am calling attention to The Daily's errors.

To the Editor:
Mr. Edward YV. Nelson's letter [The Daily, Friday,
Jan. 6| shows that he does not know all the facts.
By now he should have realized that, students are
admitted to Stanford primarily to allow the Director
of Residences Office to operate, expand and, what is
not known to the majority of the students, to conduct
vital studies into important aspects of group behavior.
Let me name only two of the studies already
almost completed by the office:
1. "The Resistance Threshold of an Average Male
Student to Being Pushed Around."
2. "The Emotional Stability of a Student as Af
fected by Petty Annoyances" (such as the extortion
of $15 for the privilege of staying in the Village over
the Christmas vacation).
The results of these and other imaginative and
bold research projects have far-reaching implications.
It now appears quite probable that by the year 19G0
il may be possible not only to turn off the hot water
completely and install coin toilets as it has been origi
nally planned, but also it may be feasible to close
University residences altogether and preserve them
in moth balls as a monument to our efficient admin
istration.
I would 1 like to point out also that the taxpayer
does not contribute a penny to the cost of the re
search. On the contrary, the Director of Residences
Office is self-supporting. So may the office continue
with its well-conceived program of research and
improvement.

University-operated residences are closed during
the Christmas holidays because of the prohibitive
cost of keeping them open, and that rooms are pro
vided in the Village because a greater percentage
of Village residents remain than do the residents
of other living units.)

By now he should have realized that, students are
admitted to Stanford primarily to allow the Director
of Residences Office to operate, expand and, what is
not known to the majority of the students, to conduct
vital studies into important aspects of group behavior.
Let me name only two of the studies already
almost completed by the office:
1. "The Resistance Threshold of an Average Male
Student to Being Pushed Around."
2. "The Emotional Stability of a Student as Af
fected by Petty Annoyances" (such as the extortion
of $15 for the privilege of staying in the Village over
the Christmas vacation).
The results of these and other imaginative and
bold research projects have far-reaching implications.
It now appears quite probable that by the year 19G0
il may be possible not only to turn off the hot water
completely and install coin toilets as it has been origi
nally planned, but also it may be feasible to close
University residences altogether and preserve them
in moth balls as a monument to our efficient admin
istration.
I would 1 like to point out also that the taxpayer
does not contribute a penny to the cost of the re
search. On the contrary, the Director of Residences
Office is self-supporting. So may the office continue
with its well-conceived program of research and
improvement.

two major errors
To the Editor:
In yesterday's feature article regarding rushing,
The Daily once again demonstrated, among other
things, its inability to accurately report the facts.
Although much of the tone of the article was hardly
appropriate, the average student is quite practiced in
sifting what he reads. I am pointing out two major
errors in your article—not for the benefit of the many
.students who seem to be better informed than The
Daily, but for the understanding of the men of '59, to
whom rushing is confusing enough without Thr»
Daily's errors.
First, I call attention to your sub-title [headline],
"Fraternities Begin Closed Rushing Parties," and
your words "Closed fraternity rushing began last _
night following open houses." A phone call to any
fraternity or to almost any freshman, and you would
have found that formal rushing pai ties do not start
until nine o'clock Tuesday evening | tonight |. The
fact th: t The Daily has in recent issues printed the
correct rushing schedule shows that it at least had
the information cn hand, whatever consolation that
may be to your readers.
A few paragraphs later, the truth once again took
gas. To quote your erroneous generality: "One black
ball, or 'ding', eliminates a rushee from further con
sideration." If you took the trouble to check into the
facts, you would have found that they simply don't
support your statement; and realizing that, you might
have hesitated to print it.
The particularly unfortunate thing about this last
error is thai, many people will believe it—not frater
nity men, or most upper classmen, for they know
better; but many freshmen who have no way of
knowing any better, and who .are only learning nefw
to sift what they read. It, Is for their enlightenment
that I am calling attention to The Daily's errors.
