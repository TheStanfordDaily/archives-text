# Stanford Students Enjoy Living Abroad Experiment
## Experiment in International Living Sends Americans to Live with Foreign Families 
### EDA MENDELS 
Twenty current Stanford students have had the opportunity to
live for a month as members of foreign families. They've been
abroad the Experiment way!
The Experiment in International Living, a nonprofit, nonsectar
ian corporation, sends groups of 10 students to different towns in

Europe, the Americas, Asia and the
Middle East, to live with the citizens
there. They try to promote better
understanding by letting the people
of different nations become ac
quainted and learn to see life from
each other's point of view.
For one month students live In
private homes sharing the life of
their foreign brothers or sisters.
Then the Americans and hosts make
an informal group trip through the
country during the second month of
their stay overseas.
NEW CHALLENGE
The Experiment has carried out
this program for the past 24 years,
but it is still an experiment for every
American and foreigner who partici
pates. Each individual has to work
out his own formula, to adapt him
self to his foreign family, to join in
their activities, to eat their meals
and to observe their customs. These
are often so different from the
American ways that this presents a
real challenge.
The Experiment is not sti-ictly an
exchange program in that the for
eign brothers and sisters do not come
to America automatically. But for
eign groups come to America on the
Experiment in reverse and live with
families in towns in the U. S.Â»
MOUNTAIN CLIMBING
Tom Peirce reminisced about his
experiences in Yugoslavia, which in
cluded mountain climbing with two
other Americans and three Yugo
slavs. "For four days we climbed
really tough mountains. We pretty
well forgot who were Yugoslavs and
Americans; we were all just trying
to stay on that mountain."
One of the most wonderful ex
periences, said Connie Schulz, was
coming home to her German family
after the big trip through the neigh
boring area. When she and her Ger
man sbter returned, "it was so good
to come home, like coming home
from school for vacation. They had
made special cakes, and we brought
presents. It was really grand. It
makes the family and you so close."
DANCING LESSONS
The Experiment is not built
around an itinerary, but around liv
ing experiences. Miss Schulz recalled
that on the trip her group and their
German hosts made, they visited
several large cities. But the best

days of the trip were the ones they
spent in a small town in the Aus
trian Alps. They picked blueberries,
climbed mountains and played
games. In the evenings, after the
Germans had taught some of then
folk dances, the Americans recipro
cated with lessons in jitterbugging.
The Experiment program now ex
tends to 28 countries. The costs vary
from $u5O for Mexico to $1500 for
Japan. Most European countries cost
about $750, which includes transpor
tation from New York.
SCHOLARSHIP
An unlimited number of Stanford
students may apply for membership
in an Experiment group, and one
will be awarded a $500 scholarship.
The only formal qualification for the
scholarship is freshman, sophomore
or junior standing. The Experiment
hopes that the winner will be back
ait Stanford next year to organize
campus publicity.
Such intangibles as interest in the
Experiment, international under
standing, people and living abroad
constitute the basis of selection.
Interviews will be held Thursday
and Friday from 3 to 5 p.m. at the
offices of the Institute of Interna
tional Relations, in the same build
ing with the Quad and Chappie of
fices. Three former Experimenters
will compose the interviewing panel.
For further information or appli
cations, interested students may con

past Experimenters can also tell
about the program.
