# Computing Center Gets New Machine
## 
### 
By the erfd of this week, the Uni
versity's Computing Center will be
ready to tackle more, bigger and
tougher math problems for science
and industry than ever before.
Professor John G. Herriot, direc
tor of the Center, said today that a
new electronic computer now being
installed will solve problems three
to five times faster than the Center's
previous equipment. It can also "re
member" far more information —up
to 2,000 10-digit numbers.
"Mo t important," lie added,- "it
will make possible the solution of
problems we couldn't even attempt
before."
Professor Herriot said the new
machine will be used jointly with
Stanford Research Institute, which
will share half its cost. The Center
will thus serve industrial researchers
as v/cll as investigators in all de
partments of the University.
The new computer is described as
a "type 650' magnetic drum data
processing machine" by its manufac
turer, the International Business
Machines Corporation. It can per
form calculations in a few hours that
a researcher might take weeks to
compute on his own—and do it while
he si'ts watching in a comfortable
chair.
Established three years ago, the
Center has been operating at full
capacity — eight hours a day, five
days a week. The new computer will
expand capacity as much as speed—
three to five times.
