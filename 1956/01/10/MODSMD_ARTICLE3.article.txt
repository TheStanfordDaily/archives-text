# French Psychologist Entertains Con Home Children with Legerdemain Feats
## 
### 
A real live magician visited Con
Home patients yesterday with ev
erything but the proverbial rabbit
in his f>at. However, so varied
were his tricks that no one no
ticed the omission.
In his off-hours this wizard is
Dr. Felix P. Cesselin. a French
man, who is visiting Stanford to
do psychological reesarch. He lias
developed the French version of

the Stanford-Binet test.
Magic is just a hobby with Dr.
Cesselin, who gave magic shows in
two of the Con Home wards,
showing his tricks to about 50
children altogether.
He started his show with fairly
routine sleight-of-hand. In rapid
succession four wooden balls ap
peared and vanished dizzily. They
jumped from place to place, final

ly turning into a large chicken
eg,g.
With his "now-you-sec-it-now
you don't" dexterity, the adroit
Frenchman kept the faces in his
little audience full of gleeful
smiles. The children contributed
to the show through their enjoy
ment of the deft visitor's clever
ness.
"Take a card, any card," were

Dr. Cesselin's next instructions to
the patients. This trick ran into
slight difficulties because many
children were too young to read
the markings.
The Chinese ribbon trick fol
lowed with two pieces of red satin
growing magically back together.
After other sleight-of-hand, the
show concluded with a display of
scarfs which fluttered in and out

of hats, came unknotted mysteri
ously, and finally turned into an
American flag.
Dr. C ess e 1 in encouraged the
children to participate in the act.
He showed thein how to do one
trick, involving a disappearing
egg, and they tested the reality
of many others.
Dr. Cesselin is here on a Ful
bright fellowship.
