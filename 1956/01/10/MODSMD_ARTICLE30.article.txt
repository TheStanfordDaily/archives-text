# Corpse Leads Grotesque Life In 'Diabolique'
## Film Is Grim Story Of Ghastly Murder 
### STEW TOY 
French film "Diabolique"
drags a battered corpse through
90 minutes of intrepid grotes
quely with the audience cling
ing breathlessly to its elusive
coattails.
Recently tied for the best foreign
film in the New York Film Critics
awards, the movie concerns the de-

> moniac proprietors
of a boys' school
(-outside Paris.
The school is
somehow reminis
ce nit of another
famous institution
—St. Trinian's of
' England.
But while the
"Belles of St. Tri-

nians" was conceived with tongue
in cheek, the residents of this dia
bolical French school are the real
thing.
SEMI-SADIST
The headmaster, a villainous semi
sadist type, has been leeching off
his rich wife, who owns the school.
In addition to batting her about
periodically, he requires her to pay
all his expenses—including fees for
his mistress.
The mistress and the wife, how
ever, both teachers at the school, are
bound by a strange cameraderie
which could well be the subject of
a first-rate character study.
But "Diabolique" is concerned
only with grating the nerves of its
audience.
MISTRESS
It does this well when the wife and
the mistress plot to murder the hus
band by drugging him and drowning
him in a bathtub.
They cart his gnarled corpse
through the French countryside in
a basket and dump it in a swimming
pool.
Bijt complications other than rigor
mortis set in, and the rest of the film
is a nightmarish trip through a psy
chological breakdown — the audi
ence's as well as the heroine's.
lIALF-NAKEI), SCREAMING
The finale is a magnificent and
high-powered bit of suspense as the
wife, half-naked and screaming . . .
but the theatre (San Francisco's
Larkin) enjoined everyone not to
divulge the ending, so the synopsis
must end here.
The movie is realistic, in the
French tradition.
Its director—the same who direct
ed "Wages of Fear"—has extended
the suspense in that picture to its
furthest conclusion; yet the fantastic
ingenuity of the plot makes it some
how humorous as well.
The French, they say, have a word
for it.
Apparently that word is "Diabol
ique."

The mistress and the wife, how
ever, both teachers at the school, are
bound by a strange cameraderie
which could well be the subject of
a first-rate character study.
But "Diabolique" is concerned
only with grating the nerves of its
audience.
MISTRESS
It does this well when the wife and
the mistress plot to murder the hus
band by drugging him and drowning
him in a bathtub.
They cart his gnarled corpse
through the French countryside in
a basket and dump it in a swimming
pool.
Bijt complications other than rigor
mortis set in, and the rest of the film
is a nightmarish trip through a psy
chological breakdown — the audi
ence's as well as the heroine's.
lIALF-NAKEI), SCREAMING
The finale is a magnificent and
high-powered bit of suspense as the
wife, half-naked and screaming . . .
but the theatre (San Francisco's
Larkin) enjoined everyone not to
divulge the ending, so the synopsis
must end here.
The movie is realistic, in the
French tradition.
Its director—the same who direct
ed "Wages of Fear"—has extended
the suspense in that picture to its
furthest conclusion; yet the fantastic
ingenuity of the plot makes it some
how humorous as well.
The French, they say, have a word
for it.
Apparently that word is "Diabol
ique."

French film "Diabolique"
drags a battered corpse through
90 minutes of intrepid grotes
quely with the audience cling
ing breathlessly to its elusive
coattails.
Recently tied for the best foreign
film in the New York Film Critics
awards, the movie concerns the de-

> moniac proprietors
of a boys' school
(-outside Paris.
The school is
somehow reminis
ce nit of another
famous institution
—St. Trinian's of
' England.
But while the
"Belles of St. Tri-

nians" was conceived with tongue
in cheek, the residents of this dia
bolical French school are the real
thing.
SEMI-SADIST
The headmaster, a villainous semi
sadist type, has been leeching off
his rich wife, who owns the school.
In addition to batting her about
periodically, he requires her to pay
all his expenses—including fees for
his mistress.
The mistress and the wife, how
ever, both teachers at the school, are
bound by a strange cameraderie
which could well be the subject of
a first-rate character study.
