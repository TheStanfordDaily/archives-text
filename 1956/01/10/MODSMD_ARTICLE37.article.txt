# Rounding the Bases

Last Saturday in the basketball game at Berkeley between USC and
California, Al Lightner, the referee, suddenly whistled the ball to a stop
and awarded the game to the Trojans by forfeit. This was, to say the least,
an unusual occurrence in Pacific Coa.'t Conference play.
Lightner's reason for the forfeit was that he had been made the target
of refuse and bits of legal tender by the stands. Earlier in the game he
was hit in the eye by a penny and had to stop the game for a moment to
recover.
Throwing pennies and/or wadded-up paper at officials, players, or on
the floor, is at best a childish pastime, and at worst a serious danger.
In my balmy high school days I can recall an incident that happened
at Jefferson High in Daly City. Some overzealous rooter threw a piece of
ice onto the count, and a visiting eager landed on it and ended up with a
broken leg. The loss of an eye is much more serious than a broken leg, but
neither is anything to joke about.
The University of California is adding to its reputation as a school with
an uncontrollable rooting section. Much has been said about their football
rooters, who act up before the TV cameras and when the team is losing.
Annually the UC administration threatens to set up a mixed rooting section
at the home football games, but this threat is never carried out. And the
situation seems to got no better.
Four years ago some Berkeley redhots set off an orange smoke-bomb
in the Cai rooting section during the Big Game. It was funny from the
Stanford side of the field, until the wind blew the smell across the field,
but reports are that Berkeley cleaners got rich on the incident. Last year
a Stanford coed was hit in the eye by an apple thrown by the Blue and
Gold mob that came over to taunt the losing Indians. She went to the hos
pital for a while, but luckily recovered.
This year was not any butter. Governor Knight was booed and shouted
down during the presentation ol the Axe to Chris Marshall and Jim Wal
lers, and apples, card-stunt squares and beer cans flew in profusion from
the Cal stands. Understandably, and yet regrettably, the Stanfords an
swered back, and I still wonder what might have happened if the police
had not intervened.
UC rowdiness has also evidenced itself in other places beside the stands
of Memorial Stadium. A few years back somebody threw a dead fish at
Julie Bescos, representing USC on the Cal basketball floor. Appropriately
enough, Bescos is now in the tuna business.
In 1947 Cal and Washington were engaged in a playoff for the PCC
cage title, and during the course of the first game, Husky guard Bill Jor
gensen, 5-10, ducked down as Cal's 6-6 Chuck Hanger bore down upon
him. Hanger went right over Jorgenson and landed on his back, and had
to retire for the remainder of the series. The reaction of the Cal students
almost resulted in Washington's breaking off athletic relations with Cali
fornia.
Last Saturday's incident was not an isolated happening, but just an
other in a long line of unhappy occurrences at UC athletic events.
Grow up, Cal.

the Cal stands. Understandably, and yet regrettably, the Stanfords an
swered back, and I still wonder what might have happened if the police
had not intervened.
UC rowdiness has also evidenced itself in other places beside the stands
of Memorial Stadium. A few years back somebody threw a dead fish at
Julie Bescos, representing USC on the Cal basketball floor. Appropriately
enough, Bescos is now in the tuna business.
In 1947 Cal and Washington were engaged in a playoff for the PCC
cage title, and during the course of the first game, Husky guard Bill Jor
gensen, 5-10, ducked down as Cal's 6-6 Chuck Hanger bore down upon
him. Hanger went right over Jorgenson and landed on his back, and had
to retire for the remainder of the series. The reaction of the Cal students
almost resulted in Washington's breaking off athletic relations with Cali
fornia.
Last Saturday's incident was not an isolated happening, but just an
other in a long line of unhappy occurrences at UC athletic events.
Grow up, Cal.
Last Saturday in the basketball game at Berkeley between USC and
California, Al Lightner, the referee, suddenly whistled the ball to a stop
and awarded the game to the Trojans by forfeit. This was, to say the least,
an unusual occurrence in Pacific Coa.'t Conference play.
Lightner's reason for the forfeit was that he had been made the target
of refuse and bits of legal tender by the stands. Earlier in the game he
was hit in the eye by a penny and had to stop the game for a moment to
recover.
Throwing pennies and/or wadded-up paper at officials, players, or on
the floor, is at best a childish pastime, and at worst a serious danger.
In my balmy high school days I can recall an incident that happened
at Jefferson High in Daly City. Some overzealous rooter threw a piece of
ice onto the count, and a visiting eager landed on it and ended up with a
broken leg. The loss of an eye is much more serious than a broken leg, but
neither is anything to joke about.
The University of California is adding to its reputation as a school with
an uncontrollable rooting section. Much has been said about their football
rooters, who act up before the TV cameras and when the team is losing.
Annually the UC administration threatens to set up a mixed rooting section
at the home football games, but this threat is never carried out. And the
situation seems to got no better.
Four years ago some Berkeley redhots set off an orange smoke-bomb
in the Cai rooting section during the Big Game. It was funny from the
Stanford side of the field, until the wind blew the smell across the field,
but reports are that Berkeley cleaners got rich on the incident. Last year
a Stanford coed was hit in the eye by an apple thrown by the Blue and
Gold mob that came over to taunt the losing Indians. She went to the hos
pital for a while, but luckily recovered.
This year was not any butter. Governor Knight was booed and shouted
down during the presentation ol the Axe to Chris Marshall and Jim Wal
lers, and apples, card-stunt squares and beer cans flew in profusion from
the Cal stands. Understandably, and yet regrettably, the Stanfords an
swered back, and I still wonder what might have happened if the police
had not intervened.
