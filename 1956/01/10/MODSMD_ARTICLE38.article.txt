I.OS AN«;EI.ES. Jan. !l (U.R) —
Coach Forrest Twogood said today
there was no animosity between the
Southern California basketball squad
and the California Bears during their
two-game series last weekend.
Twogood told the Southern Cali
fornia Basketball Writers and
Sportscasters Association that it waj
the attitude of the fans Saturday
night that caused a penny-tossing
incident in the Bear gymnasium.
"There is no animosity between
the two teams and there never has
been,"the SC coach said. "The ac
tion of the crowd is an administra
tive problem."
The Trojans won the second game
of the series by a forfeit after a ref
eree was hit in the eye twice by
coins thrown from the audience. The
Trojans were leading 77-64 at the
time of the forfeit.
Coach Johnny Wooden of UCLA,
who viewed the contest on televi
sion, said he saw nothing out of the
ordinary in the game. He said the
incident was a "black eye" to college
basketball.
