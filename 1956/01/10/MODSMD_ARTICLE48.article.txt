# Art Gallery Shows Prize-Winning Oils
## 
### 
Forty-five oil paintings running
the gamut from extreme realism to
abstract expressionism are now on
display at the Ait Gallery.
The exhibit is selected from the
(54 winning entries making up the
24th Corcoran Biennial of Contem
porary American Oil Paintings. The
Corcoran Biennial is considered to
be one of the finest exhibits of con
temporary American paintings in the
country because it represents a wide
variety of modern day schools of
thought and painting.
"Yellow Sky" by John Hultberg is
included in the collection. This was
the first-prize winner in the coin
petition and is an example of the
semi-abstract art which was preva
lent among the paintings submitted.
The display will remain through
the end of January.
