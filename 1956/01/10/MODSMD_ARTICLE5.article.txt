# Albert Is Elected To Football Hall
## 
### 
Frankie Albert has joined the
ranks of football's "immortals." The
former Stanford quarterback (1939-
41) was elected to the National Foot
ball Hall of Fame last week.
He joins three other Stanford grid
iron figures previously given the
honor. They are Ernie Nevers, full
back 3923-25; Bobby Grayson, full
back on the 1933-34-35 "Vow Boy"
teams; and the late Glenn (Pop)
Warner, coach here from 1924 to
1932.
Albert was named All-America for
his play with the Indians in 1940 and
1941, the year in which he led Stan
ford to a victory over Nebraska in
the Rose Bowl.
He later went on to play with St.
Mary's Pre-Flight School during
World War II and later with the pro
fessional San Francisco 49ers. Last
season he acted as an assistant coach
for the 49ers.
Eleven other collegiate stars were
elected with Albert, including Otto
Graham (Northwestern) and Kenny
Washington (UCLA).
The Hall of Fame is located at
Rutgers University, New Brunswick,
N. J.
