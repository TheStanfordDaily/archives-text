## Senate Group Demands Death Penalty for Heroin Peddlers 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (UP)—
A Senate judiciary subcommit
tee called today for the death
penalty for unregenerate heroin
peddlers who deal in "murder
on the installment plan."
The group, headed by Senator
Price Daniel (D,, Tex.), said in a
preliminary report to the Senate that
it was "shocked at the extent and
far-reaching effect of the illicit drug
traffic."
It urged stiffer penalties for all
narcotics smugglers and peddlers,
particularly those who sell to minors.
But it urged the most drastic crack

down on dealers in heroin, "the most
deadly of all narcotic drugs."
"Heroin smugglers and peddlers
are selling murder, robbery and
rape, and should be dealt with ac
cordingly," it said. "Their offense is
human destruction as surely as that
of the murderer. In truth and in
fact, it is 'murder on the installment
plan'."
The subcommittee, which is inves
tigating the narcotics traffic, said the
death penalty could be imposed in
"extreme cases such as the man who
started 40 high school students in
San Antonio, Texas."
