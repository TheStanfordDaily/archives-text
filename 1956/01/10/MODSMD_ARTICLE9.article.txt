# Eisenhower Urges 9-Point Farm Plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTONâ€”President Eisen
hower today sent the sharply-di
vided Congress a nine - point farm
program featuring a $1,000.000.000-a
-year soil bank plan aimed at reduc
ing "mountainous" crop surpluses.
Urging the election-conscious law
makers to approve it "with maximum
speed," he said his two-part soil
bank proposal was the best way to
cut the government's huge hoard of
surplus commodities. He termed this
the number one farm problem.
The "voluntary" plan is aimed at
an immediate 20 per cent cut in
acreage allotted to farmers for wheat
and cotton. It also called for a long
range diversion of about 25,000,000
acres of cropland to grass, trees and
other conservation planting.
