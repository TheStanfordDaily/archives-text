# Formal Rush Begins at 23 Fraternities
## Open Houses Close, Parties to Continue 
### 
Formal rushing began last
night at 23 of Stanford's 24 fra
ternities and will continue
throughout this week. Parties
will' be given by the 23 rushing
houses through Saturday night.
Over at the eating clubs the open
houses also drew to a close amid a
smattering of pledge pins. The seven
clubs did not differentiate between
formal and informal rushing this
year, and have been allowed to
pledge all during the week.
Intcrclub President Bob Webster
waxed enthusiastic again over the
club rushing program. "Turnouts are
holding up surprisingly well, and all
the individual club presidents that
I've talked to are also pleased," he
stated.
Chuck Wagner, El Cuadro presi
dent, added to Webster's comments,
saying that this year's rushing group
was by far the best he had encoun
tered at Stanford.
Fraternities are now allowed to
bid rushees and rush frosh at any
time of the day, and under any cir
cumstances. This is in sharp con
trast to autumn quarter when the
no-contact rule was in effect.
Although rushees may accept
pledge pins this week, they do not
officially become pledges until Sun
day. The no-contact rule will be in
effect again on Sunday until 5 p.m.,
but then pledge cards will be signed
at dinners given by the houses.
After the pledge cards are signed,
pledging is official, and if a pledge
breaks his pledge after signing the
card, he is not eligible to pledge
again for two full quarters of Uni
versity residence.
Only Theta Xi, among the Farm's
24 houses, is not rushing this quar
ter. Because of a Hell Week viola
tion, their rushing privileges for thiS
and next quarter have been sus
pended.
They can appeal the decision at the
end of winter quarter with spring
quarter rushing still a possibility.
The six nights of open houses
which ended last night marked one
of the longest open rushing sessions
in some years. During the 1955 sea
son, there were only four open house
sessions.
This extended open rushing period
can be credited partly to a resident
assistant report taken among fresh
men in Encina last year. According
to this report, freshmen felt that they
did not get enough chances to look at
fraternities during open houses.
Fraternity parties this week are
by invitation only. Rushees will also
be invited up to the houses for lunch
and dinner.

throughout this week. Parties
will' be given by the 23 rushing
houses through Saturday night.
Over at the eating clubs the open
houses also drew to a close amid a
smattering of pledge pins. The seven
clubs did not differentiate between
formal and informal rushing this
year, and have been allowed to
pledge all during the week.
Intcrclub President Bob Webster
waxed enthusiastic again over the
club rushing program. "Turnouts are
holding up surprisingly well, and all
the individual club presidents that
I've talked to are also pleased," he
stated.
Chuck Wagner, El Cuadro presi
dent, added to Webster's comments,
saying that this year's rushing group
was by far the best he had encoun
tered at Stanford.
Fraternities are now allowed to
bid rushees and rush frosh at any
time of the day, and under any cir
cumstances. This is in sharp con
trast to autumn quarter when the
no-contact rule was in effect.
Although rushees may accept
pledge pins this week, they do not
officially become pledges until Sun
day. The no-contact rule will be in
effect again on Sunday until 5 p.m.,
but then pledge cards will be signed
at dinners given by the houses.
After the pledge cards are signed,
pledging is official, and if a pledge
breaks his pledge after signing the
card, he is not eligible to pledge
again for two full quarters of Uni
versity residence.
Only Theta Xi, among the Farm's
24 houses, is not rushing this quar
ter. Because of a Hell Week viola
tion, their rushing privileges for thiS
and next quarter have been sus
pended.
They can appeal the decision at the
end of winter quarter with spring
quarter rushing still a possibility.
The six nights of open houses
which ended last night marked one
of the longest open rushing sessions
in some years. During the 1955 sea
son, there were only four open house
sessions.
This extended open rushing period
can be credited partly to a resident
assistant report taken among fresh
men in Encina last year. According
to this report, freshmen felt that they
did not get enough chances to look at
fraternities during open houses.
Fraternity parties this week are
by invitation only. Rushees will also
be invited up to the houses for lunch
and dinner.
Formal rushing began last
night at 23 of Stanford's 24 fra
