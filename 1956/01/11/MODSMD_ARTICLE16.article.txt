# Grant Interviews For Foreign Living Start Tomorrow
## 
### 
Interviews will be held tomorrow
and Friday to select the recipient of
a $500 scholarship for the Experi
ment in International Living.
A panel of three past Experimen
ters will interview applicants from
3 to 5 p.m. in the Institute of Inter
national Relations offices.
The Experiment is a travel pro
gram which sends groups of Ameri
cans to each of 28 countries to live
there with foreign families. They aim
to improve international relations'by
letting people from different coun
tries work and play together, thus
building for understanding.
The only formal requirement for
this scholarship is that the student
return to Stanford next year so that
he can organize Experiment pub
licity on campus. Personal qualities
are the basis for selection.
The Experiment has conducted a
scholarship program for many years,
but this particular scholarship is an
innovation. It is designated espe
cially for a Stanford student.
Stanford is the only university on
the West Coast that has been granted
a scholarship. This was done because
Stanford has the largest and most
active group of past Experimenters
on the coast, Cam Strong of the In
stitute of International Relations
said.
People who want more informa
tion about the Experiment program
and the scholarship may contact Miss
Strong at the lIR.
