## British Send 'Precautionary' Reinforcements to Cyprus 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 10 (UP)
Prime Minister Anthony Eden's
government ordered troop rein
forcements to the Mediterranean
island base of Cyprus today be
cause of the disturbed position
of the Middle East.
The War Office announced t he first,
troops will, leave by air Thursday
from London. The exact number of
troops being sent, was not disclosed.
The War Office said Britain con
sidered it desirable "as a precau
tionary measure to increase the
number of troops at the disposal of
the commander-in-chief for the pro
tection of British subjects in the area
should the need arise."
The sudden decision to build up
the Cyprus bastion, these sources
said, was directed chiefly against the
threat of chaos in Jordan, where
anti-Western rioting has flared in
rccent days.
