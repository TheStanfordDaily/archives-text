# Russia Urges UN To Condemn Israel
## 
### 
I'NITIJP NATIONS â€” Russia for
mally proposed today that Israel be
condemned by the United Nations
Security Council and ordered to pay
compensation for its attack last
month on Syrian forces at the Sea
of Galilee.
The Soviet Union thus backed the
Arab cause in submitting a draft
resolution which softened only

slightly Syria's demands for action
against Israel.
It. contained an ominous warning
that a repetition of raids such as
that of Dec. 12 could lead the Seeu

rity Council to order not only an
economic boycott, but military ac
tion against Israel.
