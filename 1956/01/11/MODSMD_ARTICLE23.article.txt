### 
WASHINGTON â€” Congresssional
tax experts today offered Congress
20 different plans for cutting personal
income taxes, most of them favoring
low-income croups.
The proposals ranged all the way
from one to grant relief to poorer
taxpayers only to another that would
give a break only to millionaires.
President Eisenhower told Con
gress last week he will oppose any
tax reduction until the budget is bal
anced and a "modest" payment can
be made on the national debt.
