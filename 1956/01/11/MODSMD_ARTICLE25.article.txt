# an immense task
## 
### 
Stanford's rushing system allows tho fresh
man men one quarter of residence before they
ore committed to the immense task of decid
ing whether they want to remain independent,
pledge a fraternity or join an eating club.
While this is probably the most satisfactory
time for rushing, all things considered, it is too
rjcon for the freshman. He needs more time to
discover more surely in, his cwn mind what he
wants to do at Stanford —where he wants to
live, which of the varied opportunities he wants
to take advantage cf, what he wants to devote
ihe majority of his time and effort to.
Deciding whether he wants to pledge or not
and if he wants to pledge, what to pledge—
is not the most important decision a student has
to make as an undergraduate, but it is a vital
one and one which may bear heavily on sub
sequent decisions.
Because of the need for a quick decision,
some men join clubs and houses when they
would be better off if they did not. Some men
have preconceived ideas that to join, particu
larly to join fraternities, is the end-all cf their

existence at a university. It's a fraternity or
bust. '
Txhis is not a discussion of whether fraterni
ties are "good" or "bad"; there are definite ad
vantages and definite disadvantages, oft - de
bated and not pertinent here. The point is this:
The fraternities offer only one way of life;
many enjoy it. There are many conveniences
and opportunities to be gained by being part
of a group. There are many inconveniences be
cause of group responsibility. An eating club
is similar to a lesser degree.
But fraternities and clubs are not the only
ways of life at Stanford. This fact has been
impressed upon the freshmen by sponsors
and other advisers, but for those who greatly
desire to join, it is difficult to assimilate.
We hope those who do not pledge this
will comprehend this, although we fear that
many will not have had enough Stanford expe
rience to do so. There is much to be said for
remaining independent. Perhaps the greatest
advantage is implied in the nomenclature—in
dependence.
