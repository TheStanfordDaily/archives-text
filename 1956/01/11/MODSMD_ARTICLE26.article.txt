fraternity advertising
To the Editor:
Recently in television's frenzied search for new
materia], it turned its lenr.es for a few moments on
a phase of college activities which is of considerable
significance to many of you. The theme revolved
around the selection of a member for a social living
t>roup. While the dramatic quality of the presenta
tion Was remarkably poor, even for video, the ideas
oppressed were, I believe, impoitant, and could well
bar repetition and elaboration.
For me, the television show succeeded in reinte
nting a raft of associations connected with my own
fraternity days—tthe anxiety connected with my own
ph !.',e period, the pride at initiation, the long and
often highly emotional controversial meetings and
hi'J.J sc . ions, the executive committee meetings at
which we wielded almost God-like power, the ideo
logical battles and finally the disillusionment and
growing away. More specifically, however, I recalled
with considerable embarrassment the many time:;
du:'.n > those years in which I took an active part in*
the selection of new members both at the pledging
nd initiation stages. In those days it seemed pretty
cut-and-dried. Legacies were automatically in; hoys
who had gained recognition within other college area:;
wre f.ous'ht;. and the remainder were selected be
cause we said, by mean?.'of ore euphemism or an
other, that they would fit in well wilh the group.
Now, in retrospect, I am convinced that we lost
,"ood men because we did not have clearly defined
•• iection criteria which were in accord wilh some of
ouf fundamental values. In lieu of such criteria, we
often reverted to selecting the "safct bets"—those
who, because they were most like us, would probably
at least maintain the status quo. Possibly it was as
a re suit of this selection policy, or, rather, because
<>112 the lack of it, that many of the groups on our
ompus became excessively inbred to the point, that
'■von the members characterized their own houses us
Icing predominantly "athletic," "political," ",'ocial,"
or "literary."
It is interesting to consider whether policies which
nurture homogeneity in member hip lead to' goals
which are consistent with m:>ny cf our other values.
Granted, the immediate effect of .such inbreeding
appears good, especially to the harried executive
member of the organization. The group is largely of
one mind, which facilitates both administrative and
social interact l on. Rushees are attracted to the group
I sure they find a place l'of them :elvt most readily
in a group whose values are consi tent with their

own. Thus there is a practically ready-made pledge
class. i
But setting aside for a moment the immediate
advantages of inbreeding, we must also consider the
long-range effects—and these, I propose, are pre
dominantly disadvantageous.
1. We are in agrement that college years provide
an opportunity for growth, not only intellectually but
socially as well. The process of growth is best real
ized in a dynamic environment where there are many
stimuli which lead an individual to constantly re
evaluate his own ideas or attitudes. And yet, in a
living group from which we often select our closest
friends, and with whom we are thrown together
during a large proportion of our college years by
sheer necessity, we often follow policies which actu
ally minimize the variety of stimulation available to
us —in order to make living as'<easy as possible.
Growth, unfortunately, isn't always easy.
2. It is quite understandable that the upper class
mcn often interest in their living groups. While
there are a variety of reasons to account for this, one
of t'hem is undoubtedly the fact that the group em
braces a set of values which he has outgrown. Since
he doesn't find o I hers in the group whose interests
are in accord with his own new interests, he must
turn elsewhere. In other words, the group has lost
the support of a member for the very reason that
made the going so easy in enrolling pledges. In view
of the fact that disinterested seniors often make dis
interested alumni, the group, on a material basis
alone, might find that it is paying a high price for
the initial ease in pledging and running the group.
So. let the new potential plcdfie be wary of joining
a group too readily in which lie "fits" too easily. He
might recall some of the ideals he had v/hen he filled
out his college application. Choosing a dynamic
group to associate with is a valuable way of realizing
some of those ideals. You may meet members of
groups that you don't immediately like or under
stand. That's a challenge—not a curse. To close one
i:elf off from people whom we don't understand at
the moment of meeting is the man.ifl- tation of an
unfortunately static individual.
And to the selectors, may I suggest that while
having a house full of diversity may make living
much more difficult in bhe immediate future—the
long-range effect may be worth the added effort ex
pended in maintaining a many-faceted membership.
Too often, group leaders fail to realize how much new
members can offer healthy stimulation to the group
if' the group is broad enough to let them.
