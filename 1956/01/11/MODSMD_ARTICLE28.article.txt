## Most Rate Stanford Intellectual Value High

What do graduating Stanford
seniors think cf the education
they have received?
This was the question that the
Study of Undergraduate Educa
tion student committee set out
to answer last spring. Some of the
answers they received have been re
leased by Student Chairman Kip
Kc. s.
For example: 86 per cer.t of the
seniors felt that Stanford had con
tributed considerably to their in
terest in many fields of knowledge.
Eighty per cent felt Stanford had
helped them to see relationships be
tween many fields of knowledge,
and 61 per cent said they received
help in development of personal phi
losophies.
Rating Stanford's contribution to
their powers of critical thinking, 75
per cent of the men rated it consid
erable or very great, but only (59
per cent of the women gave it a
similar rating.
(HEATER UNDERSTANDING
However, 83 per cent of the wom
en claimed Stanford had given them
greater understanding of group and
individual behavior, compared to 70
per cent of the men.
The information was gathered by
means of questionnaires distributed
to graduating seniors last spring.
More than GOO of the 865 graduates
replied. The SUE committee has
since tabulated the results and is
working on incorporating Abe find
ings in their over-all examination
of the Stanford undergraduate pro
gram.
Not all the opinion was favorable.
Approximately 50 per cent of the
students felt that Stanford had con
tributed only moderately or less to
the development of creative think
ing. Eighty per cent said they con
sidered their lower division advisor
to have been of little or no value.
Resident assistants fared little bet
ter, wiltih 67 per cent of the students
considering them of little value. Fif
ty-six per cent gave their major
advisors the same rating.
LITTLE STUDYING
Although some of the students
commented on the lack of "intellec
tual atmosphere," almost 50 per cent
of the graduates admitted spending
only half or less than half of the ex
pected 30 hours a week studying.
