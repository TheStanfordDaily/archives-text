## Foreign Scholar Stevens' Opinions Unusual – Especially About Women 
### GERRY SMITH 
You see Australian ASSU for- i
eign scholar Frank Stevens and
you think, "There's an ordinary
guy, probably rather quiet."
And then you talk to him.
Stevens' ideas on almost every
thing are anything buL ordinary,
lake, for instance, his views on
American women.
"American women are much more
self-confident than those in Aus
tralia," he commented. "But they're
not quite sure whether they want
equality, especially when it's follow
ed to its logical conclusion.
"If you don't leap out cf the car,
rush around, throw your ccat on
the ground and open the door for
them, they're insulted. If you talk
about what you're thinking, they
think you're a lecher, although they
are probably thinking about exactly
the same thing.",
VARIED LIFE
Stevens has spent a varied 25
years, all in Australia until he came
to North America last April.
He was graduated- lrom the Uni
versity of Sydney and is planning to
get the M.A. in economics here be
fore returning to Sydney to go into
law.
He lias a lot to say on the contrast
between his university and Stanford.
He describes the University of Syd
ney as "a Greek democracy with any
and every group having something
to say."
INTELLECTUALISM
He feels they are much more po
litically and intellectually conscious.
Each department of the university
has its society, formed by the stu
dents. The purpose of these societies
is to encourage interest in the stu- |
dents and to get good speakers,
whether they agree with the group
or not.
"If this were Sydney, Harry
Bridges would be speaking at least
once a quarter," Stevens said. "At
Sydney you're bewildered by so j
much going on at once—you get >
lather tired of it in four years. But

at Stanford ytui*re able to see its
value because there's a great lack
of it.
"Students here are never chal
lenged intellectually by their cours
es. All they talk about is what hap
pened last summer and where they
are going skiing next vacation. The
university system here is an expen
sive extension of adolescence—it's
the socially accepted thing to go to
college. In Australia it's a privi
lege."
Stevens also noticed the difference
between the University of Sydney
newspaper and The Daily. "In our
newspaper matters of theory keep
coming up ail the time, maybe on
religion, maybe on communism.
There's enormous pressure on the
editor to get things in. Maybe it's
adolescent but at least it shows the
kids are thinking."
Something else that bothers him
about Stanford is the lack of social
relationships between groups on
campus. "You talk of the Stanford
family—actually, it's a group of fam
ilies. And your chances of meeting
people outside your own group are
low."

"1 urning lo discussion of one of,
Australia's major problems, the
White Australia policy, Stevens had
several comments.
'"In Australia there has alv/ays
hsen a tremendous fear ol' Asian
expansion, especially by Japan. To
ward the Chinese people we feel
friendship and sympathy.
"The White Australia policy is
economic rather than racial. We fear
not utilizing the north part of the
continent and we feel someone else
may take over.
"The students at the University
of Sydney passed a measure con
demning this policy unanimously.
This may be o forerunner of a
change in government policy."
SWIMMING CHAMP
Stevens is well known in Aus
tralia and elsewhere in the British
Empire. In 1950 he represented Aus
tralia in the British Empire Games
in New Zealand as national back
stroke champion. He was also na
tional javelin champion.
In addition to his athletic activity,
Stevens has been active in student
political groups. In 1953-54 he was
president of the Australian Student '
Labor Federation, a national group ;
formed of all student radical clubs.,
