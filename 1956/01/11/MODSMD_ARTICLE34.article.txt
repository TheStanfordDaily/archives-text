### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 10 (U.R) â€”
Coach Joe Kuharich of the Eastern
squad in the Pro Bowl football game
today experimented with a back
field that contained three fullbacks.
The three players who normally
run from fullback and who worked
together as a unit today in practice
were Ollie Matson and Johnny Ols
zewski of the Chicago Cardinals and
Fred Morrison of the Cleveland
Browns.
Coach Sid Gillman of the West
again concentrated on a passing
game in practice, with Norm Van
Brocklin and Ed Brown both having
good success hitting receivers.
