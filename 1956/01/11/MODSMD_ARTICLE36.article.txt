## Crosby Also to Play In Own Pro-Amateur 
### 
PEBBLE BEACH, Jan. 10 (UP)
—The stage was set today for a
possible rematch of the stirring
playoff of the 1955 U.S. Open
with the announcement that Ben
Hogan was temporarily coming
out of retirement to play in Bing
Crosby's annual Pebble Beach
clambake.
The bantam golfer, who lost
the 1955 Open to little-known Jack
Fleck, will play his first round of
tournament golf when he tees off
Friday at 10 a.m. in the opening 18
holes of Crosby's National Pro-Ama
teur Golf Championship here.
This announcement set up the
Hogan-Fleck rematch. Fleck, who
previously accepted a Crosby invite,
took Bantam Ben's measure in an
i 18-hole epilogue to the regular 72-
hole Open medal play in San Fran
| ci'sco last June.
HOGAN RETIRED
Immediately thereafter, with some
; 10,000 fans ringing the 18th green of
the Olympic Club's Lakeside course,
Ben announced that henceforth he
! would be strictly a "Sunday golfer."
Tlie Crosby event is a combina
j tion pro-amateur best ball tourney
and a medal event for the pros. So,
it is conceivable, if Hogan is on his
pre-retirement stick and Fleck re
gains his open form — something
which has been amiss since he won
the championship—the two could be
J in the running for the 54-hole low
I pro score.
i Crosby, in making his announce
ment, said that Hogan had "per
! suaded" him (Crosby) to "come out
of retirement," too, to play as Ho
gan's partner.
BING TO PLAY
It has been several years since the
"Groaner" has played in his own
tournament. He sat out the past cou
ple of Pebble Beach affairs due to
ill health, but today he emphasized
that once again he is back in top
shape and raring to go.
Announcement that Crosby and
Hogan would play in the Pebble
Beadh event was expected to draw
I additional thousands of spectators,
i as well as dollars, to the Monterey
j Peninsula golf courses for the tour
j n ey.
Since Crosby picks up the entire
j tab, including golfers' expenses, pro
motion and the rest of the works,
j this means that many more thou
j sands of dollars will go to the vari
! ous Peninsula charities which have
realized some $300,000 in the past 10
I years.
