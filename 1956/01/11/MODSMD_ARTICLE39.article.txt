LOS ANGELES, Jan. 10 (U.R) -The
possibility of closed circuit televi
sion for college football games was
discussed today by the NCAA as a
cure for evils surrounding the at
tendance problems.
Asa Bushnell, director of the NC
AA TV program, said in his report
that "serious consideration" would
be given to this type of program
ming.
"There is the possibility that this
might be the cure for all our # prob
lems," said Bushnell.
EXPECTED FIREWORKS
Meanwhile, the expected fireworks
that might have been touched off by
the Big Ten, the Pacific Coast Con
ference, the small schools, or Notre
Dame failed to materialize â€” but
there still is a chance.
"They still can protest our plans
to continue the 1955 TV program
before we vote tomorrow," said
Bushnell.
There have been rumors around
the conference halls that the Big
Ten and the Pacific Coast Confer
ence will seek more regional control
of TV programming of football
games.
PROTESTS
And Ted (Spud) Harder, athletic
director at University of California
at Santa Barbara, has warned he
will protest on behalf of small col
leges if the NCAA attempts to ex
pand its televising program.
things stand now, the PCC and
Big Ten ideas would bring about the
formal protest from Harder and the
many small schools he represents.
