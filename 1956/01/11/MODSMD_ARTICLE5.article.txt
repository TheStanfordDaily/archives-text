# Farm Blocks Menlo Park Land Purchase Proposal
## Trustees Won't 'Disrupt Student Housing' To Make Property Available to School Board 
### 
University trustees have blocked a Menlo Park School District
proposal to buy a seven-acre chunk of Stanford Village.
In a letter to the Menlo Park group, Alf E. Brandin, Stanford
business manager, said the University rejected the offer on rec
ommendation of the buildings and grounds committee.

The University suggested the pos- -
sibility of further negotiations saying
that it "will be pleased to continue
discussions with the school board as
to how facilities in the Village can
be made available ultimately."
NO DISRUPTION'
But they must be "made available"
without "disruption of the Univer
sity's own student housing pro
gram."
At the same time, the Menlo Park
Planning Commission and City
Council have called a joint meeting
to be held Jan. 17 to plan future
development in the Village area.
Planning Commission administra
tive assistant John Johnson said re
development of the area is imminent
and the City Council is anxious for
a master plan of development to be
ironed out first.
A main point of consideration at
the meeting will be the location of
a new elementary school somewhere
in the Village. The area the school
board wanted for the school would,
according to Brandin's letter, "de
prive the University of 100 apart
ments."
UNIVERSITY SACRIFICE
"Recognizing the school" district's
needs," the trustees pointed out, "the
University made available at consid
erable sacrifice two buildings com- |
prising lfi apartments for the open
ing of the 1955 school year."
Those 16 apartments were in two
buildings now leased by the school
district for temporary Laurel School
which is located opposite the site
proposed for purchase.

When the Menlo Park body holds
its joint meeting, armed with a huge
study map of the Village, they will
also consider the following problems
pertaining to the embattled Univer
sity residence:
• The possibility of acquiring
property near the Ravenspood Ave
nue entrance for the construction of
a new city library.
• Construction plans of Stanford
Research Institute on 35 acres it has
purchased from the University.
• The location of a new Christian
Science Church on land the church
is hoping to buy from SRI.
• Development plans for a new
civic center in the Burgess Park
area.
• The street pattern through the
Village when the area is redevel
oped .
• Determination of which areas of
the Village will be left for develop
ment and construction of adminis- j
trn) i ve-office buildings.

LIBRARIES AND CHURCHES
When the Menlo Park body holds
its joint meeting, armed with a huge
study map of the Village, they will
also consider the following problems
pertaining to the embattled Univer
sity residence:
• The possibility of acquiring
property near the Ravenspood Ave
nue entrance for the construction of
a new city library.
• Construction plans of Stanford
Research Institute on 35 acres it has
purchased from the University.
• The location of a new Christian
Science Church on land the church
is hoping to buy from SRI.
• Development plans for a new
civic center in the Burgess Park
area.
• The street pattern through the
Village when the area is redevel
oped .
• Determination of which areas of
the Village will be left for develop
ment and construction of adminis- j
trn) i ve-office buildings.
University trustees have blocked a Menlo Park School District
proposal to buy a seven-acre chunk of Stanford Village.
In a letter to the Menlo Park group, Alf E. Brandin, Stanford
business manager, said the University rejected the offer on rec
ommendation of the buildings and grounds committee.

The University suggested the pos- -
sibility of further negotiations saying
that it "will be pleased to continue
discussions with the school board as
to how facilities in the Village can
be made available ultimately."
NO DISRUPTION'
But they must be "made available"
without "disruption of the Univer
sity's own student housing pro
gram."
At the same time, the Menlo Park
Planning Commission and City
Council have called a joint meeting
to be held Jan. 17 to plan future
development in the Village area.
Planning Commission administra
tive assistant John Johnson said re
development of the area is imminent
and the City Council is anxious for
a master plan of development to be
ironed out first.
A main point of consideration at
the meeting will be the location of
a new elementary school somewhere
in the Village. The area the school
board wanted for the school would,
according to Brandin's letter, "de
prive the University of 100 apart
ments."
UNIVERSITY SACRIFICE
"Recognizing the school" district's
needs," the trustees pointed out, "the
University made available at consid
erable sacrifice two buildings com- |
prising lfi apartments for the open
ing of the 1955 school year."
Those 16 apartments were in two
buildings now leased by the school
district for temporary Laurel School
which is located opposite the site
proposed for purchase.
