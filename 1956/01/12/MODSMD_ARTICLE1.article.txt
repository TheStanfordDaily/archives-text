# Healthy, Happy, Sam McDonald Returns to Farm
## Former Grounds Director Hospitalized 5 Months Redesigned Home, Plans for New Book Bring Desire for Life Where Death Was Once Wished 
### Pictures Story By FRANK HUNTRESS 
After five months in the hospital, Emanuel B. "Sam" McDonald
returned to his remodeled campus home yesterday to begin what
he called his "reincarnation."
The 72-year-old former athletic buildings and grounds director
moved into his new apartment at the track house on Angell Field

■•after being in the Palo Alto Hospital
where he had both of his legs ampu
tated.
Sam went to the hospital on Aug.
25 where one of his legs was ampu
tated on Oct. 28 and the other three
weeks later. While confined to the
hospital, he also was found to have
a diabetic condition.
"I did not want to live at one
time," McDonald reminisced yester
day about the long days in the hos
pital. He went on to explain that his
body was like a tree and it had to be
"pruned up like a tree and have all
the bad limbs trimmed off."
REINCARNATION'
Asked how he felt now, Sam an
swered, "I have never felt better in
all my life. He called this period in
his life his "reincarnation" and he
plans to write another book begin
ning with this year as "the year one."
Sam published his first autobiog
raphy, "Sam McDonald's Farm," last
year with all the royalties going to
the Stanford Convalescent Home.
The first floor of the track house
was completely remodeled recently
for Sam by the Stanford Athletic
Department. He formerly lived in an
apartment on the second floor of the
building while the lower floor was
used as a storeroom.
To assist McDonald whenever nec
essary, footballer Jeri McMillin and
his wife live in the apartment on the
second floor.
ESPECIALLY PLANNED'
The house was especially planned
for Sam's condition. There are ramps
leading to the front door to accom
modate his wheelchair. The stove
and refrigerator are low to the floor
so he can reach them. Sam still does
his own cooking.
He also has a television set in his
apartment, obtained through dona
tions collected mainly by the Stan
ford Convalescent Home. Sam be
came a TV addict after seeing the
last Big Game from his hospital bed.
CON HOME NURSE
During his first week at home from
the hospital he will have a nurse
from the Con Home, Mrs. Maureen
Maynard, looking after him.
The apartment has three rooms.
The large living-bedroom is where
Sam entertains his guests. On the
sofa in this room he has many differ
ent colored pillows—all with Stan
ford symbols and decorations. One
pillow with an Indian head was
given him by the late coach Pop
Warner. His desk, off in one corner,
is piled high with boxes containing
letters and correspondence with his
numerous friends.
